The year of 1984, coinciding with George Orwell’s dystopian masterpiece, seems to explain the perfect alignment between the vivid SciTech-driven imagination and the sometimes-poetic sophistication, frequently seen as the main theme of aaajiao’s work. Many of aaajiao’s works tap into the most current trends of thoughts around the Internet sphere, with a focus on the emerging controversies and phenomenon related to data processing, blogsphere/wemedia and filtered information. In his most recent projects, the artist has adopted a more extended scope of practices, borrowing elements from architecture, electronic music, performance arts, product design, even medicine, to portray the young generation harnessing the power of cyber technology and the ever-present social media.\n\nBeing one of the most frequently exhibited Chinese new media artists, aaajiao has been featured in both international and domestic scenes.

{"id": "31428926", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31428926", "title": "Action-specific perception", "text": "Action-specific perception\n\nAction-specific perception, or perception-action, is a psychological theory that people perceive their environment and events within it in terms of their ability to act. For example, softball players who are hitting better see the ball as bigger. Tennis players see the ball as moving slower when they successfully return the ball. Furthermore, the perceiver's intention to act is also critical; while the perceiver's ability to perform the intended action influences perception, the perceiver's abilities for unintended actions have little or no effect on perception.\n\nAction-specific effects have been documented in a variety of contexts and with a variety of manipulations. The original work was done on perceived slant of hills and perceived distance to targets. Hills look steeper and targets look farther away when wearing a heavy backpack. In addition to walking, many other actions influence perception such as throwing, jumping, falling, reaching, grasping, kicking, hitting, blocking, and swimming. In addition to perceived slant and perceived distance, other aspects of perception are influenced by ability such as size, shape, height, and speed. These results have been documented in athletes such as softball players, golfers, tennis players, swimmers, and people skilled in parkour.\n\nThe action-specific perception account has roots in Gibson's (1979) ecological approach to perception. According to Gibson, the primary objects of perception are affordances, which are the possibilities for action. Affordances capture the mutual relationship between the environment and the perceiver. For example, a tall wall is a barrier to an elderly person but affords jumping-over to someone trained in parkour, or urban climbing. Like the ecological approach, the action-specific perception account favors the notion that perception involves processes that relate the environment to the perceiver's potential for action. Consequently, similar environments will look different, depending on the abilities of each perceiver. Since abilities change over time, an individual's perception of similar environments will also change as their abilities change.\n\nThe claim that activity and intention influence perception is controversial. These findings challenge traditional theories of perception, nearly all of which conceptualize perception as a process that provides an objective and behaviorally-independent representation of the environment. The fact that the same environment looks different depending on the perceiver's abilities and intentions implies that perception is not behaviorally-neutral.\n\nAlternative explanations for apparent action-specific effects have been proposed, most commonly that the perceiver's ability affects the perceiver's judgment about what they see, rather than affecting perception itself. In other words, perceivers see the world similarly but then report their impressions differently.\n\nPerception cannot be measured directly. Instead, researchers must rely on reports, judgments, and behaviors. However, many attempts have been made to resolve this issue. One technique is to use many different kinds of perceptual judgments. For example, action-specific effects have been found when verbal reports and visual matching tasks. Action-specific effects are also apparent with indirect measures such as perceived parallelism as a proxy for perceived distance. Action-specific effects have also been found when using action-based measures such as Blindwalking.\n\n"}
{"id": "1227680", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1227680", "title": "Active ingredient", "text": "Active ingredient\n\nAn active ingredient (AI) is the ingredient in a pharmaceutical drug or pesticide that is biologically active. The similar terms active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) and bulk active are also used in medicine, and the term active substance may be used for natural products. Some medication products may contain more than one active ingredient. The traditional word for the API is pharmacon or pharmakon (from , adapted from pharmacos) which originally denoted a magical substance or drug. \n\nThe terms active constituent or active principle are often chosen when referring to the active substance of interest in a plant (such as salicylic acid in willow bark or arecoline in areca nuts), because the word \"ingredient\" in many minds connotes a sense of human agency (that is, something that a person combines with other substances), whereas the natural products present in plants were not added by any human agency but rather occurred naturally (\"a plant doesn't have ingredients\"). \n\nIn contrast with the active ingredients, the inactive ingredients are usually called excipients in pharmaceutical contexts. The main excipient that serves as a medium for conveying the active ingredient is usually called the vehicle. Petrolatum and mineral oil are common vehicles.\n\nThe dosage form for a pharmaceutical contains the active pharmaceutical ingredient (API), which is the drug itself, and excipients, which are the substances of the tablet, or the liquid the API is suspended in, or other material that is pharmaceutically inert. Drugs are chosen primarily for their active ingredients. \n\nPatients often have difficulty identifying the active ingredients in their medication, and are often unaware of the notion of an active ingredient. When patients are on multiple medications, active ingredients can interfere with each other, often resulting in severe or life-threatening complications. There now exist online services which can identify the active ingredient of most medications, such as the Medicines database providing information on medications available in Australia.\n\nIn phytopharmaceutical or herbal medicine, the active ingredient may be either unknown or may require cofactors in order to achieve therapeutic goals. This leads to complications in labelling. One way manufacturers have attempted to indicate strength is to engage in standardization to a marker compound. However, standardization has not been achieved yet: different companies use different markers, or different levels of the same markers, or different methods of testing for marker compounds. For instance, St John's wort is often standardized to the hypericin which is now known not to be the \"active ingredient\" for antidepressant use. Other companies standardize to hyperforin or both, although there may be some 24 known possible active constituents. Many herbalists believe that the active ingredient in a plant is the plant itself.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "151404", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=151404", "title": "Benny Hill", "text": "Benny Hill\n\nAlfred Hawthorne \"Benny\" Hill (21 January 1924 – 20 April 1992) was an English comedian and actor, best remembered for his television programme \"The Benny Hill Show\", an amalgam of slapstick, burlesque, and \"double entendre\" in a format that included live comedy and filmed segments, with him at the focus of almost every segment. \n\nHill was a prominent figure in British culture for nearly four decades. His show proved to be one of the great success stories of television comedy and was among the most-watched programmes in the UK; the audience peaked at more than 21 million in 1971.\n\nAlfred Hawthorne Hill was born on 21 January 1924 in Southampton, on the south coast of England. His father, Alfred Hill (later manager of a surgical appliance shop that mostly sold condoms), and grandfather, Henry Hill, had both been circus clowns. After leaving school, Hill worked at Woolworths, as a milkman, a bridge operator, a driver, and a drummer before becoming assistant stage manager with a touring revue. He was called up in 1942 and trained as a mechanic in the British Army. He served as a mechanic, truck driver, and searchlight operator in Normandy after September 1944 and later transferred to the Combined Services Entertainment division before the end of the war.\n\nInspired by the \"star comedians\" of British music hall shows, Hill set out to make his mark in show business. He changed his name to \"Benny\" in homage to his favourite comedian, Jack Benny.\n\nAfter the Second World War, Hill worked as a performer on radio. His first appearance on television was in 1950. In addition, he attempted a sitcom anthology, \"Benny Hill\", which ran from 1962 to 1963, in which he played a different character in each episode. In 1964, he played Nick Bottom in an all-star TV film production of William Shakespeare's \"A Midsummer Night's Dream\". He also had a radio programme lasting for three series called \"Benny Hill Time\", on BBC Radio's Light Programme, from 1964 to 1966. It was a topical show, such as a March 1964 episode which featured James Pond, 0017, in \"From Moscow with Love\" and his version of \"The Beatles\". He played a number of characters in the series, such as Harry Hill and Fred Scuttle.\n\nHill's film credits include parts in five full-length feature films including \"Who Done It?\" (1956), \"Light Up the Sky!\" (1960), \"Those Magnificent Men in their Flying Machines\" (1965), \"Chitty Chitty Bang Bang\" (1968), in which he played the relatively straight role of the Toymaker, and \"The Italian Job\" (1969). He also made two short-subject films, \"The Waiters\" (1969) and \"Eddie in August\" (1970), the latter being a TV production. Finally, a clip-show film spin-off of his early Thames Television shows (1969–73), called \"The Best of Benny Hill\" (1974), was a theatrically released compilation of \"Benny Hill Show\" episodes. \n\nHill's audio recordings include \"Gather in the Mushrooms\" (1961), \"Pepys' Diary\" (1961), \"Transistor Radio\" (1961), \"Harvest of Love\" (1963), and \"Ernie (The Fastest Milkman in the West)\", which was the UK Singles Chart Christmas number-one single in 1971. He also appeared in the 1986 video of the song \"Anything She Does\" by the band Genesis.\n\nHill had struggled on stage and had uneven success in radio, but in television, he found a form that played to his strengths. \"The Benny Hill Show\" had a music hall-derived format combining live on-stage comedy and filmed segments, and its humour relied on slapstick, innuendo, and parody. Recurring players on his show during the BBC years included Patricia Hayes, Jeremy Hawk, Peter Vernon, Ronnie Brody, and his co-writer from the early 1950s to early 1960s, Dave Freeman. Short, bald Jackie Wright was a frequent supporting player, who in many sketches had to put up with Hill slapping him on the top of his head.\n\nHill remained mostly with the BBC through to 1968, except for a few sojourns with ITV station ATV between 1957 and 1960 and again in 1967. In 1969, his show moved from the BBC to Thames Television, where it remained until cancellation in 1989, with an erratic schedule of one-hour specials. The series showcased Hill's talents as an imaginative writer, comic performer, and impressionist. He may have bought scripts from various comedy writers, but if so, they never received an onscreen credit (some evidence indicates he bought a script from one of his regular cast members in 1976, Cherri Gilham, to whom he wrote from Spain and told her he was using her \"Fat Lady idea on the show\" in January 1977).\n\nThe most common running gag in Hill's shows was the closing sequence, the \"run-off\", which was literally a running gag in that it featured various members of the cast chasing Hill, along with other stock comedy characters such as policemen, vicars, and old women. This was commonly filmed using \"under-cranking\" camera techniques, and included other comic devices such as characters running off one side of the screen and reappearing running on from the other. The tune used in all the chases, Boots Randolph's \"Yakety Sax\", is so strongly associated with the show that it is commonly referred to as \"The Benny Hill Theme\". It has been used as a form of parody in many ways by television shows and a small number of films. The Wachowskis used the same style (and musical theme) in a scene in the film \"V for Vendetta\" (2006). \n\nFrom the start of the 1980s, the show featured a troupe of attractive young women, known collectively as \"Hill's Angels\". They would appear either on their own in a dance sequence, or in character as foils against Hill. Sue Upton was one of the longest-serving members of the Angels. Jane Leeves appeared, as well. Henry McGee and Bob Todd joined Jackie Wright as comic supporting players, and the later shows also featured \"Hill's Little Angels\", a group of cute children including the families of Dennis Kirkland (the show's director) and Sue Upton.\n\nThe alternative comedian Ben Elton made a headline-grabbing allegation, both on the TV show \"Saturday Live\" and in the pages of \"Q\" magazine (in its January 1987 issue), that \"The Benny Hill Show\" was single-handedly responsible for the incidences of rape in England during the period in question, and also suggested the programme incited other acts of violence against women. A writer in \"The Independent\" newspaper, though, opined that Elton's assault was, \"like watching an elderly uncle being kicked to death by young thugs\". Elton later claimed his comment was taken out of context, and he appeared in a parody for \"Harry Enfield and Chums\", Benny Elton, where Elton ends up being chased by angry women, accompanied by the \"Yakety Sax\" theme, after trying to force them to be more feminist rather than letting them make their own decisions.\n\nIn response to the accusations of sexism, defenders of Hill have said the show used traditional comic stereotypes to reflect universal human truths in a way that was not malicious and fundamentally harmless. Hill's friend and producer Dennis Kirkland said it was the women who chased Hill in anger for undressing them, all of which was done accidentally by some ridiculous means. An article on 27 May 2006 in \"The Independent\" quoted Hill and Kirkland as saying they believed this misrepresentation demonstrated critics could not have watched his programmes.\n\nIn an episode about Hill transmitted as part of the documentary series \"Living Famously\", John Howard Davies, the head of Light Entertainment at Thames Television, who had cancelled the show, stated he did so for three reasons: \"The audiences were going down, the programme was costing a vast amount of money, and he (Hill) was looking a little tired.\"\n\nThe loss of his show was devastating for Hill (or, as one former supporting player put it, \"He started to die from there\",) and what followed was a self-inflicted decline in his health. In 1990, a new show was produced complete with Hill and his usual team, called \"Benny Hill's World Tour: New York!\".\n\nIn February 1992, Thames Television, which received a steady stream of requests from viewers for \"The Benny Hill Show\" repeats, finally gave in and put together a number of re-edited shows. Hill died on 20 April 1992, the same day that a new contract arrived in the post from Central Independent Television, for which he was to have made a series of specials. He had turned down competing offers from Carlton and Thames.\n\nJohnny Carson and side-kick Ed McMahon were both fans of Hill and tried several times to get him to come to Los Angeles and be a guest on Carson's \"The Tonight Show\". Hill always declined, citing not wanting to travel the great distance to California.\n\nClassic comedy producer Hal Roach was a fan. \n\nAs related on the BBC Program \"Living Famously\", Hill visited the home of Charles Chaplin after Chaplin's death. Chaplin's son Eugene took Hill into his father's private study and showed him several Benny Hill videotapes on a shelf. Eugene told Hill that his father was a great fan and used to watch the tapes with great enjoyment in his final years. Hill, a major fan of Chaplin, was reportedly moved to tears .\n\nRadio and TV host Adam Carolla claimed that he was a fan of Hill and that he considered Hill \"as American as the Beatles\". Indeed, during an episode of \"The Man Show\", Carolla performed in what was billed as a tribute to \"our favourite Englishman, Sir Benny Hill\" (Hill was never knighted) in more risqué versions of some of the sketches. Carolla played a rude and lecherous waiter, a typical Hill role, and the sketch featured many of the staples of Hill's shows, including a Jackie Wright-esque bald man, as well as the usual scantily clad women.\n\nMichael Jackson was a Hill fan: \"I just love your Benny Hill,\" the young Jackson told a bemused British music-press critic during a 1970s tour, \"he's so funny!\" During the decline in Benny Hill's health, he was visited by Jackson, who was in the UK at the time.\n\nThe British prog-rock band Genesis may have been fans of Hill. In 1987, they filmed a video for their song \"Anything She Does\", featuring Benny as his character Fred Scuttle, an incompetent security guard who lets a ridiculous number of fans backstage at a Genesis concert.\n\nIn \"Benny Hill: The World's Favourite Clown\", filmed shortly before his death, celebrities such as Burt Reynolds, Michael Caine, John Mortimer, Mickey Rooney, and Walter Cronkite, among others, expressed their appreciation of and admiration for Hill and his humour – and in Reynolds' case, the appreciation extended to the Hill's Angels, as well. More surprisingly, perhaps, the novelist Anthony Burgess made no secret of his admiration for Hill. Burgess, whose novels were often comic, relished language, wordplay, and dialect, admired the verbal and comedic skill that underlay Hill's success. Reviewing a biography of Hill, \"Saucy Boy\", in the \"Guardian\" in 1990, Burgess described Hill as \"a comic genius steeped in the British music-hall tradition\" and \"one of the great artists of our age\". A meeting between the two men was described in a newspaper article by Burgess and recalled in the \"Telegraph\" newspaper by the satirist Craig Brown.\n\nIn 2006, broadcaster and critic Garry Bushell launched a campaign to erect a statue of Hill in Southampton, with the support of Barbara Windsor, Brian Conley, and other British comedy favourites. Those taking part in the first fundraising concert included Neville Staple, Right Said Fred, and Rick Wakeman.\n\nIn a June 2011 interview with \"The Observer\", the American rapper Snoop Dogg declared himself to be a fan of Hill.\n\nHill never owned his own home in London, and instead preferred to rent a flat rather than buy one. He rented a double-room apartment in the London district Queen's Gate for 26 years until around 1986 when he moved to Fairwater House in Teddington. While looking for somewhere to live, he stayed at 22 Westrow Gardens in Southampton. He also never owned a car, although he could drive.\n\nDespite being a millionaire many times over, he continued with the frugal habits that he picked up from his parents, notably his father, such as buying cheap food at supermarkets, walking for miles rather than paying for a taxi unless someone picked up the tab for a limousine, and constantly patching and mending the same clothes even when the balance on his account at the Halifax Building Society reached seven figures. In one of his obituaries, a story was told of how he reportedly refused to mend his mother's leaky roof because it was \"too expensive\", and after she died, he kept the family home in Southampton as a shrine to her and did not change a thing at all. \n\nHill never married nor had children. He had proposed to two women, but neither accepted. Because of his eccentricity and reclusive lifestyle, rumours circulated that he was gay, but he always laughingly denied them.\n\nHill was a huge Francophile and enjoyed his visits to France, notably to Marseille, where until the 1980s, he could go to outdoor cafes anonymously, travelling on public transport and socialising with local women. He spoke French fluently and also knew basic German, Spanish, Dutch, and Italian. Foreign travelling was the only luxury that he permitted himself, and even then, he would stay in modest accommodations rather than five-star hotels.\n\nBenny Hill's health declined in the late 1980s. After a mild heart attack on 24 February 1992, doctors told him he needed to lose weight and recommended a heart bypass. He declined, and a week later was found to have kidney failure. He died at the age of 68 on 20 April 1992. On 22 April, after several days of unanswered telephone calls, his producer, Dennis Kirkland, climbed a ladder to the window of Hill's second-floor flat and upon seeing the body through a window, had the neighbours call the police. The police broke into the flat and found Hill, dead, sitting in his armchair in front of the television. The cause of death was recorded as coronary thrombosis. Hill's body was buried at Hollybrook Cemetery near his birthplace in Southampton on 26 April 1992. \n\nDuring the night of 4 October 1992, following speculation in the media that Hill had been buried with a large amount of gold and jewellery, grave robbers excavated the grave at Hollybrook Cemetery and broke open its coffin, the open grave's condition being found by a passer-by the following morning. After a police examination of the scene, the coffin was reclosed and the grave filled back in by cemetery workers, and as a security measure, a 1-ft-thick concrete slab was placed over it.\n\nIn 1998, Channel 4 featured Hill in one of its \"Heroes of Comedy\" programmes. On 28 December 2006, Channel 4 broadcast the documentary \"Is Benny Hill Still Funny?\" The programme featured an audience that comprised a cross-section of young adults who had little or no knowledge of Hill, to discover whether his comedy was valid to a generation that enjoyed the likes of \"Little Britain\", \"The Catherine Tate Show\", and \"Borat\". The participants were asked to watch a 30-minute compilation that included examples of Hill's humour from both his BBC and ITV shows. The responses and results demonstrated that none of the sample of viewers took offence at any of the sketches shown. His silent \"Wishing Well\" sketch was discovered to be the most popular.\n\nNotes\nBibliography\n\n"}
{"id": "28257096", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=28257096", "title": "Cave of Forgotten Dreams", "text": "Cave of Forgotten Dreams\n\nCave of Forgotten Dreams is a 2010 3D documentary film by Werner Herzog about the Chauvet Cave in southern France, which contains the oldest human-painted images yet discovered. Some of them were crafted around 32,000 years ago. The film premiered at the 2010 Toronto International Film Festival and consists of images from inside the cave as well as of interviews with various scientists and historians. The film also includes footage of the nearby Pont d'Arc natural bridge.\n\nHerzog's interest in the Chauvet cave was prompted by Judith Thurman's \"New Yorker\" article \"First Impressions\". Thurman is listed as one of the co-producers of the film.\n\nThe cave is carefully preserved and the general public is not allowed to enter. Herzog received special permission from the French Minister of Culture to film inside the cave.\nHaving received permission, Herzog nonetheless had to film under heavy restrictions. All people authorized to enter must wear special suits and shoes that have had no contact with the exterior. Also, because of near-toxic levels of radon and carbon dioxide, nobody can stay in the cave for more than a few hours per day.\n\nHerzog was allowed to have only three people with him in the cave: the cinematographer Peter Zeitlinger, a sound recorder (Eric Spitzer-Marlyn), and an assistant. Herzog himself worked the lights. The crew was allowed to use only battery-powered equipment they could carry into the cave themselves, and only lights that gave off no excess heat. The 3-D cameras were custom-built for the production, and were often assembled inside the cave itself. Herzog was allowed six shooting days of four hours each. The crew could not touch any part of the cave's wall or floor, and were confined to a walkway.\n\nThe production encountered several technical difficulties in working with the 3-D cameras in a documentary setting. At the time of production, 3-D films were typically shot on stages with heavy use of digital manipulation. Often, foreground and background elements would be shot separately and digitally composited into the finished shot. Techniques for 3-D filmmaking in natural environments with a single camera and no compositing were largely undeveloped, and had to be worked out experimentally by the crew in post-production.\n\nBefore production of \"Cave of Forgotten Dreams\", Herzog was skeptical of the artistic value of 3-D filmmaking, and had only seen one 3-D film (James Cameron's \"Avatar\"). Herzog still believes that 3-D is not suited for general use in cinema, but used it in \"Cave\" to help \"capture the intentions of the painters\", who incorporated the wall's subtle bulges and contours into their art. \nThe idea to use a 3-D camera for the film was first suggested by Zeitlinger, who had imagined before ever entering the cave that 3-D might be appropriate to capture the contours of the walls. Herzog dismissed the idea, believing 3-D to be (in Zeitlinger's words) \"a gimmick of the commercial cinema\". After visiting the cave, however, Herzog immediately decided that the film must be shot in 3-D. After the production, Herzog stated that he had no plans to use 3-D again.\n\nThe film had its debut on 13 September 2010, at the Toronto International Film Festival. It was finished at the last minute, with only 30 minutes of footage completed on the Wednesday before its showing. It was the first 3-D film to screen at the festival's Bell Lightbox theatre, and the digital projectors jammed only five minutes from the end, interrupting its debut.\n\nTwo days later, IFC Films announced that it had secured the rights to all US distribution of the film in a \"mid-six-figure deal\". Television rights had already been owned by the History Channel, who partially financed the film's production.\n\nAfter the film's premiere, Herzog was asked why the French Ministry of Culture, who sponsored the film, did not require its premiere to be in France. Herzog replied, \"They didn't know it was finished\".\n\nIn January 2011, a trailer for \"Cave\" was released which advertised a release date of Spring 2011. It premiered in cinemas in the United Kingdom on 25 March 2011. Also in March a second trailer was released for US distribution, which announced a US release date of 29 April 2011.\n\nThe film opened on 29 April 2011, shown in the US in five theaters in New York, Chicago, and Los Angeles. The ticket sales averaged $25,500 per theater for the opening weekend, which was Herzog's best-ever per theater opening, and the highest per theater average of any film in the US for the weekend.\n\nAs of 12 June 2011, the film had grossed $6.4 million, making it the highest-grossing independently released documentary of 2011, earning over 10 times more than the second-place film, \"The Last Lions\".\n\nThe film's reception was overwhelmingly positive, currently holding a 96% critic rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 128 reviews, as well as metacritic score of 86 on the Metacritic, based on 34 reviews.\n\n\n"}

At the time, he was superintendent of the Boston Lunatic Asylum, now the Boston State Hospital.\n\nStedman was born in Lancaster, Massachusetts. He attended Yale University but did not graduate. Later, Yale awarded him an honorary master's degree. He attended the Harvard Medical School earning his medical degree in 1828. For the following ten years, he was a resident surgeon at the Chelsea Naval Hospital. In 1840, he began his surgical practice in Boston. His surgical experience may have led to his interest in neuroanatomy. In 1834, he revised Johann Spurzheim’s book, \"Anatomy of the Brain\". Stedman noted in the book’s Preface that he revised the American edition since he believed the London translation from the original French was hurried, contained some ambiguity, and had typographical errors.\n\nIn 1839, the Boston Lunatic Asylum was opened, the first municipal asylum in the country. Dr. John Butler was its first superintendent. Butler left in 1842 to go to the Hartford Retreat. The superintendent position at Boston was offered to and accepted by Stedman.\n\nStedman left the Boston Lunatic Asylum in 1851 to return to his surgical practice. He served as a visiting then senior surgeon at the Boston City Hospital when it opened in 1864. He served as the first medical coroner in Massachusetts.\n\nHe died in 1866.\n\nSpurzheim, J.

Computational lithography has come to the forefront of photolithography in 2008 as the semiconductor industry grappled with the challenges associated with the transition to 22 nanometer CMOS process technology and beyond.\n\nThe periodic enhancement in the resolution achieved through photolithography has been a driving force behind Moore's Law. Resolution improvements enable printing of smaller geometries on an integrated circuit. The minimum feature size that a projection system typically used in photolithography can print is given approximately by:\n\nwhere\n\nformula_2 is the minimum feature size (also called the critical dimension).\n\nformula_3 is the wavelength of light used.\n\nformula_4 is the numerical aperture of the lens as seen from the wafer.\n\nformula_5 (commonly called \"k1 factor\") is a coefficient that encapsulates process-related factors.\n\nHistorically, resolution enhancements in photolithography have been achieved through the progression of stepper illumination sources to smaller and smaller wavelengths — from \"g-line\" (436 nm) and \"i-line\" (365 nm) sources based on mercury lamps, to the current systems based on deep ultraviolet excimer lasers sources at 193 nm. However the progression to yet finer wavelength sources has been stalled by the intractable problems associated with extreme ultraviolet lithography and x-ray lithography, forcing semiconductor manufacturers to extend the current 193 nm optical lithography systems until some form of next-generation lithography proves viable (although 157 nm steppers have also been marketed, they have proven cost-prohibitive at $50M each). Efforts to improve resolution by increasing the numerical aperture have led to the use of immersion lithography. As further improvements in resolution through wavelength reduction or increases in numerical aperture have become either technically challenging or economically unfeasible, much attention has been paid to reducing the k1-factor. The k1 factor can be reduced through process improvements, such as phase-shift photomasks. These techniques have enabled photolithography at the 32 nanometer CMOS process technology node using a wavelength of 193 nm (deep ultraviolet). However, with the ITRS roadmap calling for the 22 nanometer node to be in use by 2011, photolithography researchers have had to develop an additional suite of improvements to make 22 nm technology manufacturable. While the increase in mathematical modeling has been underway for some time, the degree and expense of those calculations has justified the use of a new term to cover the changing landscape: computational lithography.\n\nComputational lithography means the use of computers to simulate printing of micro-lithography structures. Pioneering work was done by Chris Mack at NSA in developing PROLITH, Rick Dill at IBM and Andy Neureuther at University of California, Berkeley from the early 1980s. These tools were limited to lithography process optimization as the algorithms were limited to a few square micrometres of resist. Commercial full-chip optical proximity correction, using model forms, was first implemented by TMA (now a subsidiary of Synopsys) and Numerical Technologies (also part of Synopsys) around 1997. \n\nSince then the market and complexity has grown significantly. With the move to sub-wavelength lithography at the 180 nm and 130 nm nodes, RET techniques such as Assist features, phase shift masks started to be used together with OPC. For the transition from 65 nm to 45 nm nodes customers were worrying that not only that design rules were insufficient to guarantee printing without yield limiting hotspots, but also that tape-out time may need thousands of CPUs or weeks of run time. This predicted exponential increase in computational complexity for mask synthesis on moving to the 45 nm process node spawned a significant venture capital investment in design for manufacturing start-up companies. \n\nA number of startup companies promoting their own disruptive solutions to this problem started to appear, techniques from custom hardware acceleration to radical new algorithms such as Inverse Lithography were touted to resolve the forthcoming bottlenecks. Despite this activity, incumbent OPC suppliers were able to adapt and keep their major customers, with RET and OPC being used together as for previous nodes, but now on more layers and with larger data files, and turn around time concerns were met by new algorithms and improvements in multi-core commodity processors. The term computational lithography was first used by Brion Technology (now a subsidiary of ASML) in 2005 to promote their hardware accelerated full chip lithography simulation platform. Since then the term has been used by the industry to describe full chip mask synthesis solutions. As 45 nm goes into full production and EUV lithography introduction is delayed, 32 nm and 22 nm are expected to run on existing 193 nm scanners technology. \n\nNow, not only are throughput and capabilities concerns resurfacing, but also new computational lithography techniques such as source mask optimization (SMO) is seen as a way to squeeze better resolution specific to a given design. Today, all the major mask synthesis vendors have settled on the term \"computational lithography\" to describe and promote the set of mask synthesis technologies required for 22 nm.\n\nComputational lithography makes use of a number of numerical simulations to improve the performance (resolution and contrast) of cutting-edge photomasks. The combined techniques include Resolution Enhancement Technology (RET), Optical Proximity Correction (OPC), Source Mask Optimization (SMO), etc. The techniques vary in terms of their technical feasibility and engineering sensible-ness, resulting in the adoption of some and the continual R&D of others.\n\nResolution enhancement technologies, first used in the 90 nanometer generation, using the mathematics of diffraction optics to specify multi-layer phase-shift photomasks that use interference patterns in the photomask that enhance resolution on the printed wafer surface.\n\nOptical proximity correction uses computational methods to counteract the effects of diffraction-related blurring and under-exposure by modifying on-mask geometries with means such as:\nadjusting linewidths depending on the density of surrounding geometries (a trace surrounded by a large open area will be over-exposed compared with the same trace surrounded by a dense pattern), \nadding \"dog-bone\" endcaps to the end of lines to prevent line shortening, \ncorrecting for electron beam proximity effects\n\nOPC can be broadly divided into rule-based and model-based. Inverse lithography technology, which treats the OPC as an inverse imaging problem, is also a useful technique because it can provide unintuitive mask patterns.\n\nBeyond the models used for RET and OPC, computational lithographics attempts to improve chip manufacturability and yields such as by using the signature of the scanner to help improve accuracy of the OPC model:\npolarization characteristics of the lens pupil,\nJones matrix of the stepper lens,\noptical parameters of the photoresist stack,\ndiffusion through the photoresist,\nstepper illumination control variables.\n\nThe computational effort behind these methods is immense. According to one estimate, the calculations required to adjust OPC geometries to take into account variations to focus and exposure for a state-of-the-art integrated circuit will take approximately 100 CPU-years of computer time. This does not include modeling the 3D polarization of the light source or any of the several other systems that need to be modeled in production computational photolithographic mask making flows. Brion Technologies, a subsidiary of ASML, the largest manufacturer of photolithography systems, markets a rack-mounted hardware accelerator dedicated for use in making computational lithographic calculations — a mask-making shop can purchase a large number of their systems to run in parallel. Others have claimed significant acceleration using re-purposed off-the-shelf graphics cards for their high parallel throughput.\n"}
{"id": "28249156", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=28249156", "title": "Conduit metaphor", "text": "Conduit metaphor\n\nIn linguistics, the conduit metaphor is a dominant class of figurative expressions used when discussing communication itself (metalanguage). It operates whenever people speak or write as if they \"insert\" their mental contents (feelings, meanings, thoughts, concepts, etc.) into \"containers\" (words, phrases, sentences, etc.) whose contents are then \"extracted\" by listeners and readers. Thus, language is viewed as a \"conduit\" conveying mental content between people.\n\nDefined and described by linguist Michael J. Reddy, PhD, his proposal of this conceptual metaphor refocused debate within and outside the linguistic community on the importance of metaphorical language.\n\nFellow linguist George Lakoff stated that\n\"The contemporary theory that metaphor is primarily conceptual, conventional, and part of the ordinary system of thought and language can be traced to Michael Reddy’s now classic essay... With a single, thoroughly analyzed example, he allowed \nus to see, albeit in a restricted domain, that ordinary everyday English is largely metaphorical, dispelling once and for all the traditional view that metaphor is primarily in the realm of poetic or 'figurative' language. Reddy showed, for a single, very significant case, that the locus of metaphor is thought, not language, that metaphor is a major and indispensable part of our ordinary, conventional way of conceptualizing the world, and that our everyday behavior reflects our metaphorical understanding of experience. Though other theorists had noticed some of these characteristics of metaphor, Reddy was the first to demonstrate them by rigorous linguistic analysis, stating generalizations over voluminous examples.\"\n\nThe genesis of Reddy's paper drew inspiration from work done by others in several disciplines, as well as linguistics. Research on information theory had led Norbert Wiener to publish the seminal book on cybernetics, in which he had stated, \"Society can only be understood through a study of the messages and communications facilities which belong to it.\" Social-systems theorist Donald Schön had examined the impacts of metaphorical speech on public-policy problems, putting forth the idea that people's conflicting frames of reference were often to blame for communication breakdown. Schön's frame-restructuring solution was similar in some ways to Thomas Kuhn's groundbreaking views on the shifting of scientific paradigms through what he called the \"translation\" process.\n\nResearch within linguistics (including the controversial Sapir-Whorf hypothesis and Max Black's arguments against it), coupled with Uriel Weinreich's assertion that \"Language is its own metalanguage,\" prompted Reddy to approach the conduit metaphor's exposition and its possible impact on language and thought with caution.\n\n\nReddy collected and studied examples of how English speakers talk about success or failure in communication. The overwhelming majority of what he calls core expressions involved dead metaphors selected from speakers' internal thoughts and feelings. Speakers then \"put these thoughts into words\" and listeners \"take them out of the words.\" Since words are actually marks or sounds and do not literally have \"insides,\" people talk about language largely in terms of metaphors.\n\nMost English core expressions used in talking about communication assert that actual thoughts and feelings pass back and forth between people through the conduit of words. These core expressions and the few that do not qualify as conduit metaphors are listed in the paper's extensive appendix, which itself has been cited by Andrew Ortony as \"a major piece of work, providing linguistics with an unusual corpus, as well as substantiating Reddy's claims about the pervasiveness of the root metaphor.\"\n\nThere are two distinct but similar frameworks in which the conduit metaphor appears. Four types of core expressions constitute the major framework. (In the following example sentences, the operative core expressions are italicized.)\n\nThese commonplace examples—\n—are understood metaphorically. In 1., people do not actually \"get across\" concepts by talking; in 2., feelings do not really \"come through to\" people; and in 3., people do not in fact \"give\" to others their ideas, which are mental states. Listeners assemble from their own mental states a partial replica of the speakers'. These core expressions assert figuratively that \"language literally transfers people's mental contents to others\".\n\nThese examples—\n—show that in 1., the speaker might be inexperienced in ensnaring meaning; in 2., be clumsy when putting it in; in 3., put it in the wrong place; in 4., compel words to accommodate meanings for which there is not enough room; in 5., fail to put in enough; or in 6., put in too much. These core expressions assert that \"speakers \"insert\" mental content into the \"containers\" represented by words with varying degrees of success.\"\n\nThese examples indicate that sounds and marks can be \"containers\" for mental content:\nThese core expressions assert that \"words contain or do not contain mental content, depending on the success or failure of the insertion process.\"\n\nThese examples—\n—indicate that speakers and writers are responsible to a large extent for the mental content conveyed by language, and that listeners and readers play a more passive role. However, in 7., a reader can add something to the container that was not originally there. Overall, these core expressions assert that \"listeners must \"extract\" mental content from words.\"\n\nInstead of words, an \"idea space\" between people's heads can be the container for mental content. The conduit is no longer a sealed pipeline between people, but an open pipe allowing mental content to escape into, or enter from, this space. Three types of core expressions constitute the minor framework of the conduit metaphor.\n\nThese examples—\n—show that \"speakers and writers can eject mental content into an external idea space outside people.\"\n\nThese examples—\n—indicate that \"mental content has a material existence in an idea space, existing outside people.\"\n\nThe following examples—\n—demonstrate that \"mental content from an idea space may or may not re-enter people.\"\n\nThe italicized words in the above examples are interchangeable with a wide array of terms that label mental content, the containers in which the content may be placed, and the ways in which these containers may be transferred in the conduit-metaphor paradigm.\n\nReddy developed a logical apparatus for diagramming the conduit metaphor's many permutations in both frameworks. Mental contents (feelings, emotions, ideas, etc.) are represented by RM, which stands for \"mental repertoire.\" Containers (words, phrases, sentences, etc.) are represented by S, which stands for \"signal.\" Thus, \"I need to \"put\" each \"idea into phrases\" with care\" can be rendered as the core expression \"put\" RM \"into\" S. Reddy uses this logical apparatus throughout the appendix to his paper to clarify distinctions between metalingual expressions that use the conduit metaphor and the minority that do not.\n\nIn order to examine the effects of the objectification of mental content in communication using the conduit metaphor, Reddy proposes an alternate, contrasting, \"radical subjectivist\" conception of communication called the toolmakers paradigm.\nA person's mental content is in fact isolated from others'. This isolation can be represented by a wheel-shaped compound, each wedge-shaped sector of which is an environment (a brain) bounded by two spokes and part of the circumference (\"right\"). They all contain differing amounts and types of plants, rocks, water, etc. (repertoire members). The wheel's hub has machinery that can deliver sheets of paper between sectors (communication). People use it to exchange crude blueprints (signals) for making tools, shelters, foods, etc., but they have no other contact whatsoever, and know of others' existence by inferences based on these blueprints.\n\nLiving in a forested sector, Alex builds a wooden rake, draws three identical blueprints, and drops them in the slots for Bob, Curt and Don. Bob finds a piece of wood for the handle, but because he lives in a rocky sector, starts making a stone rake head. (Alex had not considered wood to be unavailable or wrong for the rake head, so it was not specified.)\n\nWhen halfway done, Bob connects his stone head to the handle, realizes it will be heavy, and decides it must be a device for digging up rocks when clearing a field for planting. (He infers that Alex must be either very strong or has only small rocks in his sector.) Bob decides two large prongs will make his tool lighter, thus finishing with a two-bladed pickax. He makes three identical blueprints for his pickax and drops them in the slots for Alex, Curt and Don.\n\nAlex assembles a kind of rock-pick, but must modify the design if a wooden, two-pronged head is to be strong enough. (He cannot see much use for the tool in his largely rock-free sector, sensing that Bob has misunderstood his rake.) Alex draws a second blueprint for the rake head and sends it out as before. Curt crafts a hoe for slicing cleanly through roots to clear out a swamp. Don creates a gaff for fishing.\n\nBlueprint users (language users) in the toolmakers paradigm can converge by inference on accurate replications of others' tools (mental content) after a laborious series of exchanges. Using the same diagram for the conduit-metaphor paradigm instead, the hub is a duplicator that can transfer \"actual\" materials and constructions among sectors, ending the isolation. No guesswork or construction is needed: Alex puts the rake in a special chamber, pushes a button, and precise replicas appear instantly in similar chambers for Bob, Curt and Don.\n\nThe subjectivist toolmakers paradigm embodies a language requiring real effort to overcome failures in communication, whereas the objectivist conduit-metaphor paradigm embodies one in which very little effort is needed for success.\n\nAlthough the toolmakers paradigm is available as a more accurate model of communication, the conduit metaphor is pervasive and difficult to avoid in English syntax and semantics. Thinking in terms of another model of communication is generally brief, isolated and fragmentary because of an entrenched system of opposing attitudes and assumptions.\n\nReddy's tally of core expressions is about 140. Examining alternative ways of speaking about communication—either metaphorically opposed or neutral to the conduit-metaphor framework—results in a list of 30 to 40 expressions. Thus, 70% of the metalingual apparatus of the English language is based on the conduit metaphor. The influence of the remaining 30% is weakened by several factors.\n\n\nSpeaking carefully and attentively, it is possible to avoid conduit-metaphor expressions. For example, \"Did you get anything out of that article?\" might be replaced by, \"Were you able to construct anything of interest on the basis of the assigned text?\" Eschewing obvious conduit-metaphor expressions when communication is the topic is difficult. \"Try to communicate more effectively\" differs in impact from \"You've got to learn how to put your thoughts into words.\" Reddy proceeds to show that even if avoidance were possible, it does not necessarily free people from the framework.\n\nA semantic pathology arises \"whenever two or more incompatible senses capable of figuring meaningfully in the same context develop around the same name.\" \"I'm sorry\" is an example of two contextually relevant meanings in collision. A person may expect an apology when the other wishes only to sympathize, or anticipate sympathy but hear an apology instead.\n\nMany other terms are ambiguous between mental content and the words \"containing\" it. For instance the word \"poem\" denotes a particular grouping of the sounds or marks (signals) exchanged between people. However, its use in sentences reveals that it can refer to thoughts or feelings (repertoire members). In this example—\n—\"poem\" refers to a text. The word-sense can be labeled POEM. However, in this example—\n—\"poem\" refers to the mental content assembled in its reading. The word-sense in this case can be labeled POEM. Moreover, this example—\n—can be understood as either POEM or POEM (polysemy).\n\nThe ambiguity of \"poem\" is intimately related to the conduit metaphor. If words contain ideas, then POEM contains POEM. When two entities are commonly found together, one of their names—usually the more concrete—will develop a new sense referring to the other (the process of metonymy). Just as ROSE (the blossom) developed ROSE (a shade of pinkish red) by metonymy, so POEM gave rise to POEM.\n\nIn the toolmakers paradigm, words do not contain ideas, so POEM cannot contain POEM; therefore, a distinction between them must be preserved. Although there is only one POEM in most cases, the differences in mental content among people (and the difficult task of assembling it based on instructions in the text) mean that there are as many POEMs as there are people. These internal POEMs will only come to resemble one another after people expend effort comparing their mental content.\n\nIf language had been operating historically under the toolmakers paradigm, these two different concepts would not currently be accessed by the same word: talking about mental content and signals as if they were the same would have led to insoluble confusion. The ambiguity of \"poem\" would thus have been an incurable semantic pathology. However, the conduit metaphor can completely ignore it.\n\n\"Poem\" is a paradigm case for the entire class of English words denoting signals (\"word,\" \"phrase,\" \"sentence,\" \"essay,\" \"novel,\" \"speech,\" \"text,\" etc.), demonstrating that semantic structures can be completely normal in one view of reality and pathological in another. This lends support to the theory that language and views about reality develop together.\n\nEvidence of the biasing power of the conduit metaphor can be found in fields outside of linguistics. Information theory, with its concept-free algorithms and computers as models, would seem to be immune from effects arising from semantic pathology, because the framework shares many attributes with the toolmakers paradigm. Nevertheless, there is evidence that use of the conduit metaphor has hampered investigators' attempts to develop the theory.\n\nCommunication is the transfer of information (a selection from a set of alternatives). This set and a language (\"code\") relating the alternatives to physical signals are established. A copy of each (an \"\"a priori\" shared context\") is placed with the sender and receiver. A sequence of the alternatives (the \"message\") is selected for communication to the receiver, but the message itself is not sent. The selected alternatives are related by the code to energy patterns (the \"signal\") that travel quickly and unmodified. Mathematics is used to measure quantitatively how much the received signal narrows down the possible selections from stored alternatives.\n\nThe similarity between the frameworks of information theory and the toolmakers paradigm is that\nThis analogy has withstood information theory's utility in simple, technical applications, but in biology, the social sciences, human language and behavior, it has been historically less successful. These attempts foundered by misunderstanding the conceptual framework of the theory rather than its mathematics. Reliance on ordinary language has made the information theory's insights less clear.\n\nThe negative impact of ordinary language on information theory's use in other fields can be traced to terms the founders themselves used to label parts of their paradigm, telegraphy. The set of alternatives (repertoire members) were called the \"alphabet.\" While true for telegraphy, Claude Shannon and Warren Weaver used it as a nomenclature referring to any set of alternative states, behaviors, etc. The alphabet confuses the distinction between signals and repertoire members in human communication. Despite Weaver's particular interest in applying the theory to language, this fact went unrecognized.\n\nShannon and Weaver were also unaware that the choice of the term \"message\" to represent the selection of alternatives from the repertoire shared the same semantic pathology as \"poem.\"\nBecause MESSAGE is the \"signal\" and MESSAGE is the \"repertoire members\" in communication, the reasoning is faulty. The ambiguity is trivial in the conduit-metaphor framework, but fatal for information theory, which is based on the idea that MESSAGE cannot be transmitted. Although Shannon and Weaver noted the distinction between \"received\" and \"transmitted\" signals based on possible distortion and noise, they wrote the word \"message\" on the receiving end of their paradigm.\n\nWeaver employed many conduit-metaphor expressions; for example, \"How precisely do the transmitted symbols \"convey\" the desired meaning?\" [italics Reddy's]. He also contrasted two \"messages, one of which is \"heavily loaded with meaning\" and the other of which is pure nonsense.\" Weaver wrote as if repertoire members are sent, adding that the sender \"changes the \"message\" into the \"signal\"\" [italics Weaver's]. A code specifies how two systems relate, without changing anything; it preserves in the receiver the organizational pattern of the sender. Marks and sounds do not change into electrons, just as thoughts do not change into words.\nShannon correctly wrote, \"The \"receiver\" ordinarily performs the inverse operation of that done by the transmitter, reconstructing the message from the signal.\" But conduit metaphorisms continue to appear in the form of \"encode\" and \"decode,\" defined as putting the repertoire members \"into\" code and taking them \"out,\" respectively. In addition, because the theory conceives of information as the ability to copy an organization via nonrandom selections, the term \"information content\" is itself a misnomer: signals do something but cannot contain anything. The conduit metaphor has thus influenced the thinking of information theorists in a counterproductive way.\n\nConfusion between the message and the signal persisted for two decades as theorists in other fields of inquiry drew on the insights of information theory. Kenneth K. Sereno and C. David Mortensen wrote that \"investigators have yet to establish a completely acceptable definition of communication\".\n\"Those models based upon a mathematical conception describe communication as analogous to the operations of an information processing machine: an event occurs in which a \"source\" or \"sender transmits a signal\" or \"message\" through a \"channel\" to some \"destination\" or \"receiver\".\" [italics Sereno & Mortensen's] \nAdditionally, when they state, \"The theory was concerned with the problem of defining the quantity of information contained in a message to be transmitted...,\" information is contained in a transmitted \"message\". If it refers to MESSAGE, it is the conduit metaphor asserting that information is contained in the signals. If it is MESSAGE, it is the repertoire members that are sent in signals, which contain measurable information. The insights of information theory have been challenged by using the conduit metaphor instead of the more accurate toolmakers paradigm, upon which its premises were initially based.\n\nThe conduit-metaphor paradigm states that communication failure needs explanation, because success should be automatic: materials are naturally gathered, but misguided people expend energy scattering them. Conversely, the toolmakers paradigm states that partial miscommunication is inherent and can only be fixed by continuous effort and extensive verbal interaction: materials are gathered using energy or they will be naturally scattered.\n\nReddy explores some of the potential social and psychological effects of believing that communication is a \"success without effort\" system, whereas it is an \"energy must be expended\" system. The conduit metaphor objectifies meaning and influences people to talk and think about mental content as if it possessed an external, inter-subjective reality.\n\nHaving discussed the conduit metaphor's impact on theorists within and outside of linguistics, Reddy speculates about its distorting potential in culture and society. He points out that\nis a conduit metaphor asserting that ideas are in words, which are on pages, which are in books, which are in libraries—with the result that \"ideas are in libraries.\" The implication of this minor-framework core expression is that libraries full of books, tapes, photographs, videos and electronic media contain culture.\n\nIn the toolmakers-paradigm perspective, there are no ideas in the words; therefore, none in libraries. Instead, there are patterns of marks, bumps or magnetized particles capable of creating patterns of noise and light. Using these patterns as instructions, people can reconstruct mental content resembling that of those long gone. Since people in the past experienced a different world and used slightly different language instructions, a person unschooled in the language and lacking a full reservoir of mental content from which to draw, is unlikely to reconstruct a cultural heritage.\n\nBecause culture does not exist in books or libraries, it must be continually reconstructed in people's brains. Libraries preserve the opportunity to perform this reconstruction, but if language skills and the habit of reconstruction are not preserved, there will be no culture. Thus, Reddy asserts that the only way to preserve culture is to train people to \"regrow\" it in others.\n\nHe stresses that the difference of viewpoint between the conduit metaphor and the toolmakers paradigm is profound. Humanists—those traditionally charged with reconstructing culture and teaching others to reconstruct it—are increasingly rare. Reddy proposes that, despite a sophisticated system for mass communication, there is actually less communication; and moreover, that people are following a flawed manual. The conduit-metaphor influenced view is that the more signals created and preserved, the more ideas \"transferred\" and \"stored.\" Society is thus often neglecting the human ability to reconstruct thought patterns based on signals. This ability atrophies when \"extraction\" is seen as a trivial process not requiring instruction past a rudimentary level.\n\nReddy concludes that the conduit metaphor may continue to have negative technological and social consequences: mass communications systems that largely ignore the internal, human systems responsible for the majority of the work in communicating. Because the logical framework of the conduit metaphor indicates people think in terms of \"capturing ideas in words\"—despite there being no ideas \"within\" the ever-increasing stream of words—a burgeoning public may be less culturally informed than expected.\n\nSince the publication of Reddy's paper in 1979, it has garnered a large number of citations in linguistics, as well as a wide spectrum of other fields of inquiry. In 2007, a search at Web of Science revealed 354 citations broken down roughly as follows: 137 in linguistics; 45 in information science; 43 in psychology; 38 in education; 17 in sociology; 15 in anthropology; 10 in law; 9 in business/economics; 8 in neurology; 7 in medicine; 5 in political science; 4 each in the arts, biology, environmental science, and mathematics; and 1 each in architecture, geography, parapsychology and robotics.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "49899", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=49899", "title": "Courage", "text": "Courage\n\nCourage (also called bravery or valour) is the choice and willingness to confront agony, pain, danger, uncertainty, or intimidation. Physical courage is bravery in the face of physical pain, hardship, death or threat of death, while moral courage is the ability to act rightly in the face of popular opposition, shame, scandal, discouragement, or personal loss.\n\nThe classical virtue of fortitude (\"andreia, fortitudo\") is also translated \"courage\", but includes the aspects of perseverance and patience.\n\nIn the Western tradition, notable thoughts on courage have come from philosophers, Socrates, Plato, Aristotle, Aquinas, and Kierkegaard.\n\nMuch earlier, in the Hindu tradition, mythology has given many examples of bravery, valour and courage. Ramayana and Mahabharatha have in them many examples of both physical and moral courage.\n\nIn the Eastern tradition, some thoughts on courage were offered by the \"Tao Te Ching\". More recently, courage has been explored by the discipline of psychology.\n\nDaniel Putman, a professor at the University of Wisconsin - Fox Valley, wrote an article titled \"The Emotions of Courage\". Using a text from Aristotle's \"Nicomanachean Ethics\" as the basis for his article, he discusses the relationship between fear and confidence in the emotion of courage. \n\nHe states that \"courage involves deliberate choice in the face of painful or fearful circumstances for the sake of a worthy goal\". With this realization, Putman concludes that \"there is a close connection between fear and confidence\". \n\nFear and confidence in relation to courage can determine the success of a courageous act or goal.They can be seen as the independent variables in courage, and their relationship can affect how we respond to fear. In addition, the confidence that is being discussed here is self-confidence; Confidence in knowing one's skills and abilities and being able determine when to fight a fear or when to flight it. Putman states that:\nWhen trying to understand how fear and confidence play into courage, we need to look back at Aristotle's quote. According to Putman, Aristotle is referring to an appropriate level of fear and confidence in courage. \"Fear, although it might vary from person to person, is not completely relative and is only appropriate if it \"matches the danger of the situation\".\"The same goes for confidence in that there are two aspects to self-confidence in a dangerous situation.\n\nWithout an appropriate balance between fear and confidence when facing a threat, one cannot have the courage to overcome it. Putman states \"if the two emotions are distinct, then excesses or deficiencies in either fear or confidence can distort courage.\"\n\nAs noted above, an \"excess or deficiency of either fear or confidence, can distort courage\". According to Putman, there are four possibilities:\n\nPutman explains each of these possibilities accordingly: an individual in the first possibility is perceived as a coward; in the second possibility a rash person. . For the remaining two possibilites, he uses analogies to explain them. The third possibility can occur if someone experienced a traumatic experience that brought about great anxiety for much of their life.Then the fear that they experience would often be inappropriate and excessive. Yet as a defensive mechanism, the person would show excessive levels of confidence as a way to confront their irrational fear and \"\"prove\" something to oneself or other\". So this distortions could be seen as a coping method for their fear. For the last possibility, it can be seen as hopelessness. Putman says this is similar to \"a person on a sinking ship\". \"This example is of a person who has low confidence and possibly low self-regard who suddenly loses all fear\". The distortion of low fear and low confidence can occur in a situation where an individual accepts what is going to happen to them. In regards to this example, they lose all fear because they know death is unavoidable and the reason it is unavoidable is because they do not have the ability to handle or overcome the situation.\n\nThus, Daniel Putman identifies fear and courage as being deeply intertwined and that they rely on distinct perceptions: \n\nThe early Greek philosopher Plato (c. 428–348 BCE) set the groundwork for how courage would be viewed to future philosophers. Plato's early writings found in \"Laches\" show a discussion on courage, but they fail to come to a satisfactory conclusion on what courage is.\n\nDuring the debate between three leaders, including Socrates, many definitions of courage are mentioned.\n\nWhile many definitions are given in Plato's \"Laches\", all are refuted, giving the reader a sense of Plato's argument style. \"Laches\" is an early writing of Plato's, which may be a reason he does not come to a clear conclusion. In this early writing, Plato is still developing his ideas and shows influence from his teachers like Socrates.\n\nIn one of his later writings, \"The Republic\", Plato gives more concrete ideas of what he believes courage to be. Civic courage is described as a sort of perseverance – \"preservation of the belief that has been inculcated by the law through education about what things and sorts of things are to be feared\". Ideas of courage being perseverance also are seen in \"Laches\". Plato further explains this perseverance as being able to persevere through all emotions, like suffering, pleasure, and fear.\n\nAs a desirable quality, courage is discussed broadly in Aristotle's \"Nicomachean Ethics\", where its vice of shortage is cowardice and its vice of excess is recklessness.\n\nIn the Roman Empire, courage formed part of the universal virtue of \"virtus\". Roman philosopher and statesman Cicero (106–43 BCE) lists the cardinal virtues does not name them such: \n\nIn medieval virtue ethics, championed by Averroes and Thomas Aquinas and still important to Roman Catholicism, courage is referred to as \"Fortitude\".\n\nAccording to Thomas Aquinas:\n\nPart of his justification for this hierarchy is that:\nOn fortitude's general and special nature, Aquinas says:\nAquinas holds fortitude or courage as being primarily about endurance, not attack:\n\nIn both Catholicism and Anglicanism, courage is also one of the seven gifts of the Holy Spirit. For Thomas Aquinas, Fortitude is the virtue to remove any obstacle that keeps the will from following reason. Thomas Aquinas argues that Courage is a virtue which, along with the Christian virtues in the Summa Theologica, can only be exemplified with the presence of the Christian virtues: faith, hope, and mercy. In order to understand true courage in Christianity it takes someone who displays the virtues of faith, hope, and mercy. Courage is a natural virtue which Saint Augustine did not consider a virtue for Christians. Thomas Aquinas considers courage a virtue through the Christian virtue of mercy. Only through mercy and charity can we call the natural virtue of courage a Christian virtue. Unlike Aristotle, Aquinas’ courage is about endurance, not bravery in battle.\n\nThe \"Tao Te Ching\" contends that courage is derived from love (\"慈 loving 故 causes 能 ability 勇 brave\"), explaining, \"One of courage, with audacity, will die. One of courage, but gentle, spares death. From these two kinds of courage arise harm and benefit.\"\n\nIn Hindu tradition, Courage (shauriya) / Bravery (dhairya), and Patience (taamasa) appear as the first two of ten characteristics (lakshana) of dharma in the Hindu Manusmṛti, besides forgiveness (kshama), tolerance (dama), honesty (asthaya), physical restraint (indriya nigraha), cleanliness (shouchya), perceptiveness (dhi), knowledge (vidhya), truthfulness (satya), and control of anger (akrodh).\n\nIslamic beliefs also present courage and self-control as a key factor in facing the Devil (both within and external); many believe this because of the courage the Prophets of the past displayed (through peace and patience) against people who despised them for their beliefs.\n\nThomas Hobbes lists virtues into the categories of moral virtues and virtues of men in his work \"Man and Citizen.\" Hobbes outlines moral virtues as virtues in citizens, that is virtues that without exception are beneficial to society as a whole. These moral virtues are justice (i.e. not violating the law) and charity. Courage as well as prudence and temperance are listed as the virtues of men. By this Hobbes means that these virtues are invested solely in the private good as opposed to the public good of justice and charity. Hobbes describes courage and prudence as a strength of mind as opposed to a goodness of manners. These virtues are always meant to act in the interests of individual while the positive and/or negative effects of society are merely a byproduct. This stems forth from the idea put forth in \"Leviathan\" that the state of nature is \"solitary, poor, nasty, brutish and short.\" According to Hobbes courage is a virtue of the individual in order to ensure a better chance of survival while the moral virtues address Hobbes's social contract which civilized men display (in varying degrees) in order to avoid the state of nature. Hobbes also uses the idea of fortitude as an idea of virtue. Fortitude is \"to dare\" according to Hobbes, but also to \"resist stoutly in present dangers.\" This a more in depth elaboration of Hobbes's concept of courage that is addressed earlier in \"Man and Citizen.\" This idea relates back to Hobbes's idea that self-preservation is the most fundamental aspect of behavior.\n\nDavid Hume listed virtues into two categories in his work \"A Treatise of Human Nature\" as artificial virtues and natural virtues. Hume noted in the Treatise that courage is a natural virtue. In the Treatise's section \"Of Pride and Humility, Their Objects and Causes\", Hume clearly stated courage is a cause of pride: \"Every valuable quality of the mind, whether of the imagination, judgment, memory or disposition; wit, good-sense, learning, courage, justice, integrity; all these are the cause of pride; and their opposites of humility\".\n\nHume also related courage and joy to have positive effects on the soul: \"(...) since the soul, when elevated with joy and courage, in a manner seeks opposition, and throws itself with alacrity into any scene of thought or action, where its courage meets with matter to nourish and employ it\". Along with courage nourishing and employing, Hume also wrote that courage defends humans in the Treatise: \"We easily gain from the liberality of others, but are always in danger of losing by their avarice: Courage defends us, but cowardice lays us open to every attack\".\n\nHume wrote what excessive courage does to a hero's character in the Treatise's section \"Of the Other Virtues and Vices\": \"Accordingly we may observe, that an excessive courage and magnanimity, especially when it displays itself under the frowns of fortune, contributes in a great measure, to the character of a hero, and will render a person the admiration of posterity; at the same time, that it ruins his affairs, and leads him into dangers and difficulties, with which otherwise he would never have been acquainted\".\n\nOther understandings of courage that Hume offered can be derived from Hume's views on morals, reason, sentiment, and virtue from his work \"An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals.\"\n\nSøren Kierkegaard opposed courage to angst, while Paul Tillich opposed an existential \"courage to be\" with non-being, fundamentally equating it with religion:\nJ.R.R. Tolkien identified in his 1936 lecture \"\" a \"Northern 'theory of courage'\" – the heroic or \"virtuous pagan\" insistence to do the right thing even in the face of certain defeat without promise of reward or salvation:\nVirtuous pagan heroism or courage in this sense is \"trusting in your own strength,\" as observed by Jacob Grimm in his \"Teutonic Mythology\":\n\nErnest Hemingway famously defined courage as \"grace under pressure.\"\n\nWinston Churchill stated, \"Courage is rightly esteemed the first of human qualities because it is the quality that guarantees all others.\"\n\nAccording to Maya Angelou, \"Courage is the most important of the virtues, because without courage you can't practice any other virtue consistently. You can practice any virtue erratically, but nothing consistently without courage.\"\n\nIn \"Beyond Good and Evil\", Friedrich Nietzsche describes master–slave morality, in which a noble man regards himself as a \"determiner of values;\" one who does not require approval, but passes judgment. Later, in the same text, he lists man's four virtues as \"courage, insight, sympathy, and solitude,\" and goes on to emphasize the importance of courage: \"The great epochs of our life are the occasions when we gain the courage to re-baptize our evil qualities as our best qualities.\"\n\nAccording to the Swiss psychologist Andreas Dick, courage consists of the following components: \n\n1. put at risk, risk or repugnance, or sacrifice safety or convenience, which may result in death, bodily harm, social condemnation or emotional deprivation;\n\n2. a knowledge of wisdom and prudence about what is right and wrong in a given moment;\n\n3. Hope and confidence in a happy, meaningful outcome;\n\n4. a free will;\n\n5. a motive based on love.\n\nResearchers who want to study the concept and the emotion of courage have continued to come across a certain problem. While there are \"numerous definitions of courage\", they are unable to set \"an operational definition of courage on which to base sound explicit theories\". Rate et al. states that because of a lack of an operational definition, the advancement of research in courage is limited. So they conducted studies to try to find \"a common structure of courage\". Their goal from their research of implicit theories was to find \"people's form and content on the idea of courage\". Many researchers created studies on implicit theories by creating a questionnaire that would ask \"What is courage?\". In addition, in order to \"develop a measurement scale of courage, ten experts in the field of psychology came together to define courage. They defined it as:\nAlso, because courage is a \"multi-dimensional construct, it can be \"better understood as an exceptional response to specific external conditions or circumstances than as an attribute, disposition, or character trait\". Meaning that rather than being a show of character or an attribute, courage is a response to fear \n\nFrom their research, they were able to find the \"four necessary components of people's notion of courage\"..They are:\n\nWith these four components, they were able to define courage as:\nTo further the discussion of the implicit theories of courage, the researchers stated that future research could consider looking into the concept of courage and fear and how individual's might feel fear, overcome it and act, and act despite of it. \n\nIts accompanying animal is the lion. Often, fortitude is depicted as having tamed the ferocious lion. Cf. e.g. the Tarot trump called Strength. It is sometimes seen in the Catholic Church as a depiction of Christ's triumph over sin. It also is a symbol in some cultures as a savior of the people who live in a community with sin and corruption.\n\nSeveral awards claim to recognize courageous actions, including:\n\n\n\n"}

Because of Old Douglas, the 43rd Mississippi Infantry came to be known as the Camel Regiment, Douglas was originally part of a U.S. War Department program called the Texas Camel Experiment, which aimed to experiment with camels as a possible alternative to horses and mules, which were dying of dehydration in vast numbers. Jefferson Davis, who had ascended to the position of United States Secretary of War in 1853, was a strong proponent of the program, and used his political influence to make the experiment happen. Although the details are unknown, Douglas somehow made his way to Mississippi, and eventually died at Davis's hometown of Vicksburg, Mississippi. He was initially given to Colonel W. H. Moore by 1st Lt. William Hargrove. Besides being a mascot, Moore assigned Douglas to the regimental band, carrying instruments and knapsacks.\n\nThough the men tried to treat Old Douglas like a horse, the camel was known to break free of any tether, and was eventually allowed to graze freely. Despite not being tied up, he never wandered far from the men. The Infantry’s horses feared Old Douglas, and he is recorded to have spooked one horse into starting a stampede, which reportedly injured many, and possibly killed one or two horses.\nOld Douglas’s first active service was with General Sterling Price in the Iuka campaign. He also participated in the 1862 Battle of Corinth. He remained with the regiment until the Siege of Vicksburg, where he was killed by Union sharpshooters. Enraged at his death, the men swore to avenge him. Col. Bevier enlisted six of his best snipers, and successfully shot the culprit. Of Douglas's killer, Bevier reportedly said, “I refused to hear his name, and was rejoiced to learn that he had been severely wounded\".\n\nDouglas is currently honored with his own grave marker in Cedar Hill Cemetery, in Vicksburg, Mississippi. He, along with other camels used during the war, is not overlooked by historians, nor by Civil War Reenactors. There is currently a group called the Texas Camel Corps, whose mission is to promote the stories of camels, like Old Douglas, used during the Civil War.\n"}

March 1900 – September 14, 1929) was a union organizer and balladeer who was killed during the Loray Mill Strike in Gastonia, N.C. \n\nAccording to \"Like a Family\", a 1987 account of \"the making of a Southern cotton mill world,\" the Gastonia protest collapsed in the aftermath of Wiggins's death. Her union, the National Textile Workers Union, ultimately was \"too weak to challenge the economic and political power of the cotton manufacturers and to organize the labor force.\"\n\nA native of Sevierville, Tennessee, Wiggins by 1926 settled in Gaston County, NC, living in an African-American neighborhood outside Bessemer City known as Stumptown. Her neighbors would look after her children as she worked as a spinner at American Mill No. 2. According to an article published online by the North Carolina Museum of History, \"she worked twelve-hour days, six days a week, earning about nine dollars a week.\"\n\nShe became a bookkeeper for the union, which was Communist run, and traveled to Washington, D.C., to testify about labor practices in the South. She also told her story: “I’m the mother of nine. Four died with the whooping cough, all at once. I was working nights, I asked the super to put me on days, so’s I could tend ‘em when they had their bad spells. But he wouldn’t. I don’t know why. ... So I had to quit, and then there wasn’t no money for medicine, and they just died.”\n\nShe also sang her ballads, including her best-known song, “A Mill Mother’s Lament,” which has been recorded by Pete Seeger, among others.\n\nWiggins believed in organizing African-Americans along with whites, and in a close vote, her local NTWU branch voted to admit African-Americans to the union.\n\nOn September 14, 1929, she and other union members drove to a union meeting in Gastonia. They were met by an armed mob, and turned back. They had driven about five miles toward home when they were stopped by a car; armed men jumped out and began shooting. Wiggins was shot in the chest and killed. Her five children were sent to live in orphanages.\n\nFive Loray Mill employees were charged in Wiggins’s murder but were acquitted after less than 30 minutes of deliberation in a trial in Charlotte in March 1930 despite the fact that the crime was committed in daylight and more than 50 people witnessed it.\n\nHer life—and death—became the grist for many works of fiction inspired by true events, including \"Strike!\", a 1930 work by Mary Heaton Vorse, where Wiggins is given the name Mamie Lewis.\n\nShe was buried in the Bessemer City Cemetery on North 12th St. Hers is one of the biggest markers there, after being expanded by the A.F.L-C.I.O. in 1979 to include a marker inscribed, \"She died carrying the torch of social justice.\" Her maiden name is misspelled on the marker at her gravesite.\n\nThree of her children were later buried near her.\n\n"}

Harris argues that the truth about the human mind (that free will is an illusion) does not undermine morality or diminish the importance of political and social freedom, and can as well as should change the way we think about some of the most important questions in life.\n\nHarris says the idea of free will \"cannot be mapped on to any conceivable reality\" and is incoherent. According to Harris, science \"reveals you to be a biochemical puppet.\" People's thoughts and intentions, Harris says, \"emerge from background causes of which we are unaware and over which we exert no conscious control.\" Every choice we make is made as a result of preceding causes. These choices we make are determined by those causes, and are therefore not really choices at all. Harris also draws a distinction between conscious and unconscious reactions to the world. Even without free will, consciousness has an important role to play in the choices we make. Harris argues that this realization about the human mind does not undermine morality or diminish the importance of social and political freedom, but it can and should change the way we think about some of the most important questions in life.\n\nThe book has undergone some critique.\n\nThe author uses the Libet argument, which has been challenged by Adrian G. Guggisberg and Annaïs Mottaz. A study by Aaron Schurger and colleagues published in PNAS challenged assumptions about the causal nature of the readiness potential itself (and the \"pre-movement buildup\" of neural activity in general), thus denying the conclusions drawn from studies such as Libet's and Fried's.\n\n"}

Some contemporary news reports stated that he had suffered the heart attack while on camera, although most references claim that he was stricken while in a make-up chair, between scenes. However, actor Peter Bowles, also in the cast, recalled that \"During transmission, a little group of us was talking on camera while awaiting the arrival of Gareth Jones's character, who had some information for us.

{"id": "5138823", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5138823", "title": "Ghost hunting", "text": "Ghost hunting\n\nGhost hunting is the process of investigating locations that are reported to be haunted by ghosts. Typically, a ghost-hunting team will attempt to collect evidence supporting the existence of paranormal activity. Ghost hunters use a variety of electronic devices, including EMF meters, digital thermometers, both handheld and static digital video cameras, including thermographic and night vision cameras, as well as digital audio recorders. Other more traditional techniques are also used, such as conducting interviews and researching the history of allegedly haunted sites. Ghost hunters may also refer to themselves as \"paranormal investigators.\"\n\nGhost hunting has been heavily criticized for its dismissal of the scientific method. No scientific study has ever been able to confirm the existence of ghosts. The practice is considered a pseudoscience by the vast majority of educators, academics, science writers, and skeptics. Science historian Brian Regal described ghost hunting as \"an unorganized exercise in futility\".\n\nParanormal research dates back to the 18th century, with organisations such as the Society for Psychical Research investigating spiritual matters. Psychic researcher Harry Price published his \"Confessions of a Ghost-Hunter\" in 1936.\n\nGhost hunting was popularised in the 2000s by television series such as \"Most Haunted\" and \"Ghost Hunters\", combined with the increasing availability of high-tech equipment. The Atlantic Paranormal Society reported a doubling in their membership in the late 2000s, attributing this to the television programs. Despite its lack of acceptance in academic circles, the popularity of ghost-hunting reality TV shows has influenced a number of individuals to take up the pursuit.\n\nSmall businesses offering ghost-hunting equipment and paranormal investigation services increased in the early 2000s. Many offer electromagnetic field (EMF) meters, infrared motion sensors and devices billed as \"ghost detectors\". The paranormal boom is such that some small ghost-hunting related businesses are enjoying increased profits through podcast and web site advertising, books, DVDs, videos and other commercial enterprises.\n\nOne ghost-hunting group called \"A Midwest Haunting\" based in Macomb, Illinois, reported that the number of people taking its tours had tripled, jumping from about 600 in 2006 to 1,800 in 2008. Others, such as Marie Cuff of \"Idaho Spirit Seekers\" pointed to increased traffic on their websites and message boards as an indication that ghost hunting was becoming more accepted. Participants say that ghost hunting allows them to enjoy the friendship of like-minded people and actively pursue their interest in the paranormal. According to Jim Willis of \"Ghosts of Ohio\", his group's membership had doubled, growing to 30 members since it was founded in 1999 and includes both true believers and total skeptics. Willis says his group is \"looking for answers, one way or another\" and that skepticism is a prerequisite for those who desire to be \"taken seriously in this field.\"\n\nAuthor John Potts says that the present day pursuit of \"amateur ghost hunting\" can be traced back to the Spiritualist era and early organizations founded to investigate paranormal phenomena, like London's The Ghost Club and the Society for Psychical Research, but that modern investigations are unrelated to academic parapsychology. Potts writes that modern ghost hunting groups ignore the scientific method and instead follow a form of \"techno-mysticism\".\n\nThe popularity of ghost hunting has led to some injuries. Unaware that a \"spooky home\" in Worthington, Ohio was occupied, a group of teenagers stepped on the edge of the property to explore. The homeowner fired on the teenagers' automobile as they were leaving, seriously injuring one.\nA woman hunting for ghosts was killed in a fall from a University of Toronto building.\n\nAn offshoot of ghost hunting is the commercial ghost tour conducted by a local guide or tour operator who is often a member of a local ghost-hunting or paranormal investigation group. Since both the tour operators and owners of the reportedly haunted properties share profits of such enterprises (admissions typically range between $50 and $100 per person), some believe the claims of hauntings are exaggerated or fabricated in order to increase attendance. The city of Savannah, Georgia is said to be the American city with the most ghost tours, having more than 31 as of 2003.\n\nAccording to a survey conducted in October 2008 by the Associated Press and Ipsos, 34 percent of Americans say they believe in the existence of ghosts. Moreover, a Gallup poll conducted on June 6–8, 2005 showed that one-third (32%) of Americans believe that ghosts exist, with belief declining with age. Having surveyed three countries (the United States, Canada, and Great Britain), the poll also mentioned that more people believe in haunted houses than any of the other paranormal items tested, with 37% of Americans, 28% of Canadians, and 40% of Britons believing.\n\nIn 2002, the National Science Foundation identified haunted houses, ghosts, and communication with the dead among pseudoscientific beliefs.\n\nCritics question ghost hunting's methodology, particularly its use of instrumentation, as there is no scientifically proven link between the existence of ghosts and cold spots or electromagnetic fields. According to skeptical investigator Joe Nickell, the typical ghost hunter is practicing pseudoscience. Nickell says that ghost hunters often arm themselves with EMF meters, thermometers that can identify cold spots, and wireless microphones that eliminate background noise, pointing out the equipment being used to try to detect ghosts is not designed for the job. \"The least likely explanation for any given reading is it is a ghost,\" maintains Nickell. Orbs of light that show up on photos, he says, are often particles of dust or moisture. \"Voices\" picked up by tape recorders can be radio signals or noise from the recorder, EMF detectors can be set off by faulty wiring, microwave towers, iron, recording equipment, or cell phones, and heat sensors can pick up reflections off of mirrors or other metal surfaces. Nickell has also criticized the practice of searching only in the dark, saying that since some ghosts are described as \"shadows or dark entities,\" he conducts searches in lighted rather than darkened conditions.\n\nAccording to investigator Benjamin Radford, most ghost-hunting groups including The Atlantic Paranormal Society make many methodological mistakes. \"After watching episodes of \"Ghost Hunters\" and other similar programs, it quickly becomes clear to anyone with a background in science that the methods used are both illogical and unscientific\". Anyone can be a ghost investigator, \"failing to consider alternative explanations for anomalous ... phenomena\", considering emotions and feelings as \"evidence of ghostly encounters\". \"Improper and unscientific investigation methods\" for example \"using unproven tools and equipment\", \"sampling errors\", \"ineffectively using recording devices\" and \"focusing on the history of the location...and not the phenomena\". In his article for Skeptical Inquirer Radford concludes that ghost hunters should care about doing a truly scientific investigation \"I believe that if ghosts exist, they are important and deserve to be taken seriously. Most of the efforts to investigate ghosts so far have been badly flawed and unscientific – and, not surprisingly, fruitless.\"\n\nAlthough some ghost hunters believe orbs are of supernatural origin, skeptic Brian Dunning says that they are usually particles of dust that are reflected by light when a picture is taken, sometimes it may be bugs or water droplets. He contends that \"there are no plausible hypotheses that describe the mechanism by which a person who dies will become a hovering ball of light that appears on film but is invisible to the eye.\" He does not believe there is any science behind these beliefs; if there were then there would be some kind of discussion of who, what and why this can happen. In his investigations he can not find any \"plausible hypothesis\" that orbs are anything paranormal.\n\nScience writer Sharon Hill reviewed over 1,000 \"amateur research and investigation groups\" (ARIGs), writing that \"879 identified with the category of “ghosts”. Hill reports that many groups used the terms “science” or “scientific” when describing themselves; however \"they overwhelmingly display neither understanding of nor adherence to scientific norms\". \n\n\"ARIGs often promote their paranormalist viewpoint as scientifically based, especially in community presentations or lectures at educational facilities. While scientifically minded observers can readily spot the anemic and shoddy scholarship of popular paranormal investigation, the public, unaware of the fundamental errors ARIGs make, can be persuaded by jargon and “sciencey” symbols.\"\nHill sees the supernatural bias of such groups as an indication of how \"far removed ARIG participants really are from the established scientific community\".\n\nIn Hill's 2017 book \"Scientifical Americans\" reviewed by historian Brian Regal for \"Skeptical Inquirer\" magazine, Regal writes, that this is a timely book as it comes during an era when many question science. Regal wonders why believers think that \"untutored amateurs know more (and are more trustworthy) than professional scholars\". He asks why there is little discussion on \"philosophical and theological aspects of their work\" for example he theoretical questions like \"What is a ghost?\" and \"Does one's religion in life determine if they can become a ghost in death?\". Hill gives a historiography of the field of \"modern paranormal interest: monsters, UFO's, and ghosts.\" She does not insult or ridicule the people she writes about, but explains their stories through case studies. Regal feels that this book will not deter believers in the paranormal, but it is an important part of a \"growing literature on amateur paranormal research\". Regal states that paranormal researchers are not engaging in scientific discovery but are engaging \"blithely in confirmation bias, selective evidence compiling, and the backfire effect while all the time complaining that it is the other side doing it. ... They, like all of us, are ultimately not searching for ghosts ... they are looking for themselves.\"\n\nGhost hunters use a variety of techniques and tools to investigate alleged paranormal activity.\nWhile there is no universal acceptance among ghost hunters of the following methodologies, a number of these are commonly used by ghost hunting groups.\n\nAccording to ghost hunters, a cold spot is an area of localized coldness or a sudden decrease in ambient temperature. Many ghost hunters use digital thermometers or heat sensing devices to measure such temperature changes. Believers claim that cold spots are an indicator of paranormal or spirit activity in the area; however there are many natural explanations for rapid temperature variations within structures, and there is no scientifically confirmed evidence that spirit entities exist or can affect air temperatures.\n\nSome ghost hunters claim that circular artifacts appearing in photographs are spirits of the dead or other paranormal phenomena, however, such visual artifacts are a result of flash photography illuminating a mote of dust or other particle, and are especially common with modern compact and ultra-compact digital cameras.\n\n\n"}

Nosaka won the Naoki Prize for best popular literature for this story and \"American Hijiki\", which was published a month before. Both short stories along with four others were bundled as a book in 1968 published by Shinchōsha (). The short story was later adapted into the 1988 animated film \"Grave of the Fireflies\", directed by Isao Takahata. The film was released on April 16, 1988, over twenty years from the publication of the original work. It was adapted again into a live action television film \"Grave of the Fireflies\".\n\nNosaka explained that \"Grave of the Fireflies\" is a \"double-suicide story.\" Isao Takahata, the film director, said that he saw similarities to Chikamatsu Monzaemon's double-suicide plays.\n\nAkiyuki Nosaka wrote the book in 1967, during a period of high economic growth. Nosaka said that the era felt strange to him and that \"the real spirit of humanity was different\" and so he wished to depict an \"idealized humanity\" between a brother and sister, or \"ultimately, of a man and a woman.\" He added that he wished to place Seita, the main character, \"in an idealized situation.\" Nosaka said that he himself had been in such a scenario until fourteen and then had to grow up very quickly, becoming \"worse off\" than other children.\n\nAkiyuki Nosaka explained that Seita and Setsuko survive the wartime environment by \"locking themselves up in a world of their own.\" Nosaka added that after their mother, their sole guardian, dies, Seita \"decides to become the guardian of his little sister, even if it means making an enemy out of the world.\" At one point, Seita has a favorable reception to making himself a source of food for his sister. Nosaka argued \"On the one hand, that's very tragic, but it's also a blessed situation. For Seita, it's like he can try to build a heaven for just the two of them.\" Nosaka argued that while Seita is \"when it comes to reality\" not a romanticist for he also becomes hungry, \"objectively speaking\" Setsuko, at age four, is at the period when \"a girl looks the cutest\" and Seita is just becoming aware of his masculinity in his adolescent period. Nosaka said that the two have an \"obvious consanguineous relationship\" and that Setsuko is the only person Seita can confide in. Nosaka added that \"while there's a strong blood tie, he's shut out from being able to love her as a girl\" and that his tension increases to high levels and therefore sublimation takes place.\n\nNosaka explained that Seita \"is rather spoiled for a wartime child\" and therefore the children of 1987 would act like he would if they were put in that situation. Isao Takahata said that he was compelled to adapt the story into an animation after seeing how Seita \"was a unique wartime ninth grader.\" He previously believed that boys always developed the will to live, but Seita instead chooses not to endure difficult feelings; when his aunt insults him, Seita does not act in a stoic manner and instead withdraws from the situation. Takahata argued that Seita's feelings are better understood by the children in 1987, who often base decisions on whether or not they are pleasant, while during that year his generation had the belief that Seita needed to endure it. Takahata argued that \"It's not only the children...I think the times are becoming that way, as well\" and therefore he liked the idea of adapting the story as a film.\n\nNosaka said that in the story, Seita \"got increasingly transformed into a better human being\" since he was trying to \"compensate for everything I couldn't do myself\" and that he was never \"kind like the main character.\" Nosaka explained that \"I always thought I wanted to perform those generous acts in my head, but I couldn't do so.\" He believed that he would always give food to his sister, but when he obtained food, he ate. The food tasted very good when it was scarce, but he felt remorse afterwards. Nosaka concluded \"I'd think there is no one more hopeless in the world than me. I didn't put anything about this in the novel.\"\n\nNosaka said that Setsuko also has to grow up quickly, and she takes the role of Seita's mother, \"and at other times, the role of his lover.\" Setsuko acts as Seita's spiritual support while Setsuko relies on Seita for nourishment. Nosaka said that \"[i]n the end, it turns out that the days leading up to their death are like the development of a love story.\"\n\nNosaka said that the death of his sister was \"an exact match with the novel.\"\n"}

The science that examines human nature is known as psychology and more recently also neuroscience. The concept of human nature is traditionally contrasted not only with unusual human characteristics, but also with characteristics which are derived from specific cultures, and upbringings. The \"nature versus nurture\" debate is a well-known modern discussion about human nature in natural science.\n\nThese questions have particularly important implications in economics, ethics, politics, and theology. This is partly because human nature can be regarded as both a source of norms of conduct or ways of life, as well as presenting obstacles or constraints on living a good life. The complex implications of such questions are also dealt with in art and literature, the question of what it is to be human.\n\nThe concept of nature as a standard by which to make judgments is traditionally said to have begun in Greek philosophy, at least as regards the Western and Middle Eastern languages and perspectives which are heavily influenced by it.\n\nThe teleological approach of Aristotle came to be dominant by late classical and medieval times. By this account, human nature really causes humans to become what they become, and so it exists somehow independently of individual humans. This in turn has been understood as also showing a special connection between human nature and divinity. This approach understands human nature in terms of final and formal causes. In other words, nature itself (or a nature-creating divinity) has intentions and goals, similar somehow to human intentions and goals, and one of those goals is humanity living naturally. Such understandings of human nature see this nature as an \"idea\", or \"form\" of a human.\n\nHowever, the existence of this invariable and metaphysical human nature is a subject of much historical debate, continuing into modern times. Against this idea of a fixed human nature, the relative malleability of man has been argued especially strongly in recent centuries—firstly by early modernists such as Thomas Hobbes and Jean-Jacques Rousseau. In Rousseau's \"Emile, or On Education\", Rousseau wrote: \"We do not know what our nature permits us to be\". Since the early 19th century, thinkers such as Hegel, Marx, Kierkegaard, Nietzsche, Sartre, structuralists, and postmodernists have also sometimes argued against a fixed or innate human nature.\n\nCharles Darwin's theory of evolution has changed the nature of the discussion, supporting the proposition that mankind's ancestors were not like mankind today. Still more recent scientific perspectives—such as behaviorism, determinism, and the chemical model within modern psychiatry and psychology—claim to be neutral regarding human nature. As in much of modern science, such disciplines seek to explain with little or no recourse to metaphysical causation. They can be offered to explain human nature's origins and underlying mechanisms, or to demonstrate capacities for change and diversity which would arguably violate the concept of a fixed human nature.\n\nPhilosophy in classical Greece is the ultimate origin of the Western conception of the nature of a thing. According to Aristotle, the philosophical study of human nature itself originated with Socrates, who turned philosophy from study of the heavens to study of the human things. Socrates is said to have studied the question of how a person should best live, but he left no written works. It is clear from the works of his students Plato and Xenophon, and also by what was said about him by Aristotle (Plato's student), that Socrates was a rationalist and believed that the best life and the life most suited to human nature involved reasoning. The Socratic school was the dominant surviving influence in philosophical discussion in the Middle Ages, amongst Islamic, Christian, and Jewish philosophers.\n\nThe human soul in the works of Plato and Aristotle has a divided nature, divided in a specifically human way. One part is specifically human and rational, and divided into a part which is rational on its own, and a spirited part which can understand reason. Other parts of the soul are home to desires or passions similar to those found in animals. In both Aristotle and Plato, spiritedness (\"thumos\") is distinguished from the other passions (\"epithumiai\"). The proper function of the \"rational\" was to rule the other parts of the soul, helped by spiritedness. By this account, using one's reason is the best way to live, and philosophers are the highest types of humans.\n\nAristotle—Plato's most famous student—made some of the most famous and influential statements about human nature. In his works, apart from using a similar scheme of a divided human soul, some clear statements about human nature are made:\n\nFor Aristotle, reason is not only what is most special about humanity compared to other animals, but it is also what we were meant to achieve at our best. Much of Aristotle's description of human nature is still influential today. However, the particular teleological idea that humans are \"meant\" or intended to be something has become much less popular in modern times.\n\nFor the Socratics, human nature, and all natures, are metaphysical concepts. Aristotle developed the standard presentation of this approach with his theory of four causes. Every living thing exhibits four aspects or \"causes\": matter, form, effect, and end. For example, an oak tree is made of plant cells (matter), grew from an acorn (effect), exhibits the nature of oak trees (form), and grows into a fully mature oak tree (end). Human nature is an example of a formal cause, according to Aristotle. Likewise, to become a fully actualized human being (including fully actualizing the mind) is our end. Aristotle (\"Nicomachean Ethics,\" Book X) suggests that the human intellect (νούς) is \"smallest in bulk\" but the most significant part of the human psyche, and should be cultivated above all else. The cultivation of learning and intellectual growth of the philosopher, which is thereby also the happiest and least painful life.\n\nHuman nature is a central question in Chinese philosophy. Human nature was considered by Confucius and Mencius to be essentially good. From the Song dynasty the theory of the original goodness of human beings dominated Confucian thought. However, Hsun Tzu taught that human nature was essentially evil. As suggested by these contrasting views, the question of human nature has generated a long debate among Chinese thinkers.\n\nIn Christian theology, there are two ways of \"conceiving human nature\". The first is \"spiritual, Biblical, and theistic\", whereas the second is \"natural, cosmical, and anti-theistic\". The focus in this section is on the former. As William James put it in his study of human nature from a religious perspective, \"religion\" has a \"department of human nature\".\n\nVarious views of human nature have been held by theologians. However, there are some \"basic assertions\" in all \"biblical anthropology\".\nThe Bible contains no single \"doctrine of human nature\". Rather, it provides material for more philosophical descriptions of human nature. For example, Creation as found in the Book of Genesis provides a theory on human nature.\n\nCatechism of the Catholic Church in chapter \"Dignity of the human person\" has article about man as image of God, vocation to beatitude, freedom, human acts, passions, moral conscience, virtues and sin.\n\nAs originally created, the Bible describes \"two elements\" in human nature: \"the body and the breath or spirit of life breathed into it by God\". By this was created a \"living soul\", that is, a \"living person\". According to Genesis 1:27, this living person was made in the \"image of God\". From the biblical perspective, \"to be human is to bear the image of God\".\n\nGenesis does not elaborate the meaning of \"the image of God\", but scholars find suggestions. One is that being created in the image of God distinguishes human nature from that of the beasts. Another is that as God is \"able to make decisions and rule\" so humans made in God's image are \"able to make decisions and rule\". A third is that mankind possesses an inherent ability \"to set goals\" and move toward them. That God denoted creation as \"good\" suggests that Adam was \"created in the image of God, in righteousness.\"\n\nAdam was created with ability to make \"right choices\", but also with the ability to choose sin, by which he fell from righteousness into a state of \"sin and depravity\". Thus, according to the Bible, \"humankind is not as God created it\".\n\nBy Adam's fall into sin, \"human nature\" became \"corrupt\", although it retains the image of God. Both the Old Testament and the New Testament teach that \"sin is universal\". For example, Psalm 51:5 reads: \"For behold I was conceived in iniquities; and in sins did my mother conceive me.\" Jesus taught that everyone is a \"sinner naturally\" because it is mankind's \"nature and disposition to sin\". Paul, in Romans 7:18, speaks of his \"sinful nature\".\n\nSuch a \"recognition that there is something wrong with the moral nature of man is found in all religions\". Augustine of Hippo coined a term for the assessment that all humans are born sinful: original sin. Original sin is \"the tendency to sin innate in all human beings\". The doctrine of original sin is held by the Catholic Church and most mainstream Protestant denominations, but rejected by the Eastern Orthodox Church, which holds the similar doctrine of ancestral fault.\n\n\"The corruption of original sin extends to every aspect of human nature\": to \"reason and will\" as well as to \"appetites and impulses\". This condition is sometimes called \"total depravity\". Total depravity does not mean that humanity is as \"thoroughly depraved\" as it could become. Commenting on Romans 2:14, John Calvin writes that all people have \"some notions of justice and rectitude ... which are implanted by nature\" all people.\n\nAdam embodied the \"whole of human nature\" so when Adam sinned \"all of human nature sinned\". The Old Testament does not explicitly link the \"corruption of human nature\" to Adam's sin. However, the \"universality of sin\" implies a link to Adam. In the New Testament, Paul concurs with the \"universality of sin\". He also makes explicit what the Old Testament implied: the link between humanity's \"sinful nature\" and Adam's sin In Romans 5:19, Paul writes, \"through [Adam's] disobedience humanity became sinful\". Paul also applied humanity's sinful nature to himself: \"there is nothing good in my sinful nature.\"\n\nThe theological \"doctrine of original sin\" as an inherent element of human nature is not based only on the Bible. It is in part a \"generalization from obvious facts\" open to empirical observation.\n\nA number of experts on human nature have described the manifestations of original (i.e., the innate tendency to) sin as empirical facts.\n\nEmpirical discussion questioning the genetic exclusivity of such an intrinsic badness proposition is presented by researchers Elliott Sober and David Sloan Wilson. In their book, \"Unto Others: The Evolution and Psychology of Unselfish Behavior\", they propose a theory of multilevel group selection in support of an inherent genetic \"altruism\" in opposition to the original sin exclusivity for human nature.\n\nLiberal theologians in the early 20th century described human nature as \"basically good\" needing only \"proper training and education\". But the above examples document the return to a \"more realistic view\" of human nature \"as basically sinful and self-centered\". Human nature needs \"to be regenerated ... to be able to live the unselfish life\".\n\nAccording to the Bible, \"Adam's disobedience corrupted human nature\" but God mercifully \"regenerates\". \"Regeneration is a radical change\" that involves a \"renewal of our [human] nature\". Thus, to counter original sin, Christianity purposes \"a complete transformation of individuals\" by Christ.\n\nThe goal of Christ's coming is that fallen humanity might be \"conformed to or transformed into the image of Christ who is the perfect image of God\", as in 2 Corinthians 4:4. The New Testament makes clear the \"universal need\" for regeneration. A sampling of biblical portrayals of regenerating human nature and the behavioral results follow.\n\nOne of the defining changes that occurred at the end of the Middle Ages was the end of the dominance of Aristotelian philosophy, and its replacement by a new approach to the study of nature, including human nature. In this approach, all attempts at conjecture about formal and final causes were rejected as useless speculation. Also, the term \"law of nature\" now applied to any regular and predictable pattern in nature, not literally a law made by a divine lawmaker, and, in the same way, \"human nature\" became not a special metaphysical cause, but simply whatever can be said to be typical tendencies of humans.\n\nAlthough this new realism applied to the study of human life from the beginning—for example, in Machiavelli's works—the definitive argument for the final rejection of Aristotle was associated especially with Francis Bacon. Bacon sometimes wrote as if he accepted the traditional four causes (\"It is a correct position that \"true knowledge is knowledge by causes\". And causes again are not improperly distributed into four kinds: the material, the formal, the efficient, and the final\") but he adapted these terms and rejected one of the three: But of these the final cause rather corrupts than advances the sciences, except such as have to do with human action. The discovery of the formal is despaired of. The efficient and the material (as they are investigated and received, that is, as remote causes, without reference to the latent process leading to the form) are but slight and superficial, and contribute little, if anything, to true and active science.This line of thinking continued with René Descartes, whose new approach returned philosophy or science to its pre-Socratic focus upon non-human things. Thomas Hobbes, then Giambattista Vico, and David Hume all claimed to be the first to properly use a modern Baconian scientific approach to human things.\n\nHobbes famously followed Descartes in describing humanity as matter in motion, just like machines. He also very influentially described man's natural state (without science and artifice) as one where life would be \"solitary, poor, nasty, brutish and short\". Following him, John Locke's philosophy of empiricism also saw human nature as a \"tabula rasa\". In this view, the mind is at birth a \"blank slate\" without rules, so data are added, and rules for processing them are formed solely by our sensory experiences.\n\nJean-Jacques Rousseau pushed the approach of Hobbes to an extreme and criticized it at the same time. He was a contemporary and acquaintance of Hume, writing before the French Revolution and long before Darwin and Freud. He shocked Western civilization with his Second Discourse by proposing that humans had once been solitary animals, without reason or language or communities, and had developed these things due to accidents of pre-history. (This proposal was also less famously made by Giambattista Vico.) In other words, Rousseau argued that human nature was not only not fixed, but not even approximately fixed compared to what had been assumed before him. Humans are political, and rational, and have language now, but originally they had none of these things. This in turn implied that living under the management of human reason might not be a happy way to live at all, and perhaps there is no ideal way to live. Rousseau is also unusual in the extent to which he took the approach of Hobbes, asserting that primitive humans were not even naturally social. A civilized human is therefore not only imbalanced and unhappy because of the mismatch between civilized life and human nature, but unlike Hobbes, Rousseau also became well known for the suggestion that primitive humans had been happier, \"noble savages\".\n\nRousseau's conception of human nature has been seen as the origin of many intellectual and political developments of the 19th and 20th centuries. He was an important influence upon Kant, Hegel, and Marx, and the development of German idealism, historicism, and romanticism.\n\nWhat human nature did entail, according to Rousseau and the other modernists of the 17th and 18th centuries, were animal-like passions that led humanity to develop language and reasoning, and more complex communities (or communities of any kind, according to Rousseau).\n\nIn contrast to Rousseau, David Hume was a critic of the oversimplifying and systematic approach of Hobbes, Rousseau, and some others whereby, for example, all human nature is assumed to be driven by variations of selfishness. Influenced by Hutcheson and Shaftesbury, he argued against oversimplification. On the one hand, he accepted that, for many political and economic subjects, people could be assumed to be driven by such simple selfishness, and he also wrote of some of the more social aspects of \"human nature\" as something which could be destroyed, for example if people did not associate in just societies. On the other hand, he rejected what he called the \"paradox of the sceptics\", saying that no politician could have invented words like honourable' and 'shameful,' 'lovely' and 'odious,' 'noble' and 'despicable, unless there was not some natural \"original constitution of the mind\".\n\nHume—like Rousseau—was controversial in his own time for his modernist approach, following the example of Bacon and Hobbes, of avoiding consideration of metaphysical explanations for any type of cause and effect. He was accused of being an atheist. He wrote: \n\nAfter Rousseau and Hume, the nature of philosophy and science changed, branching into different disciplines and approaches, and the study of human nature changed accordingly. Rousseau's proposal that human nature is malleable became a major influence upon international revolutionary movements of various kinds, while Hume's approach has been more typical in Anglo-Saxon countries, including the United States.\n\nCharles Darwin gave a widely accepted scientific argument for what Rousseau had already argued from a different direction, that humans and other animal species have no truly fixed nature, at least in the very long term. However, he also gave modern biology a new way of understanding how human nature does exist in a normal human time-frame, and how it is caused.\n\nE. O. Wilson's sociobiology and closely related theory of evolutionary psychology give scientific arguments against the \"tabula rasa\" hypotheses of Hobbes, Locke, and Rousseau. \n\nIn his book \"Consilience: The Unity of Knowledge\" (1998), Wilson claimed that it was time for a cooperation of all the sciences to explore human nature. He defined human nature as a collection of epigenetic rules: the genetic patterns of mental development. Cultural phenomena, rituals, etc. are products, not part of human nature. Until now, these phenomena were only part of psychological, sociological, and anthropological studies. Wilson proposes that they can be part of interdisciplinary research.\n\n"}

Over 2,000 sailors lost their lives.\n\nNewman-Newman was born in 1767, and joined the Royal Navy at a young age, serving as a lieutenant aboard the flagship of Sir Alexander Hood, HMS \"Royal George\" during the battle of the Glorious First of June, when a French fleet was defeated deep in the Atlantic by the British Channel Fleet under Lord Howe. Due to good service in this action, Newman-Newman was promoted to captain and took command of a succession of frigates in the Mediterranean and home waters, beginning with HMS \"Ceres\" in 1795.\n\nOn 21 March 1796, the sloop HMS \"Lark\", under William Ogilvy, joined the \"Ceres\" and Newman-Newman in providing support to an unsuccessful attack by British troops from Port-au-Prince on the town and fort of Léogane on the island of Hispaniola.\n\nIn 1798, Newman-Newman was in command of the frigate HMS \"Mermaid\" during the campaign against a French fleet which threatened to invade Ireland. The French force was destroyed at the Battle of Tory Island, in which \"Mermaid\" was not engaged, but the surviving French ships scattered into the Atlantic and \"Mermaid\" was one of the ships tasked with tracking them. On 15 October, \"Mermaid\", in company with the brig HMS \"Kangaroo\" discovered the French frigate \"Loire\" and gave chase, catching and engaging the French ship. \"Loire\" was too strong for her opponents, however, and despite suffering heavy damage, managed to escape. The following day \"Loire\" was captured by the large razee HMS \"Anson\", having suffered heavy casualties. \"Mermaid\" had taken 17 casualties herself and Newman-Newman was praised for his conduct.\n\nTwo years later, Newman-Newman was again involved in the capture of a French frigate, this time as captain of HMS \"Loire\", the same ship he had captured two years previously. The French \"Pallas\" had been sighted off St Malo by two small Royal Navy ships and despite the disparity in size, the small craft engaged the much larger frigate. \"Pallas\" was able to hold off her diminutive opponents, but in the afternoon of 5 February 1800 a squadron led by Newman-Newman in \"Loire\" arrived. In the engagement which followed, the five British ships fought a lengthy battle with \"Pallas\" and French shore batteries under which the frigate was sheltering until eventually \"Pallas\" surrendered. \"Loire\" had suffered 22 casualties.\n\nIn 1802, Newman-Newman was briefly in reserve during the Peace of Amiens, but he soon returned to service as commander of a ship of the line following the resumption of the Napoleonic Wars the following year. In the summer of 1809 he was called as a witness at the Court-martial of James, Lord Gambier which assessed whether Admiral Lord Gambier had failed to support Captain Lord Cochrane at the Battle of Basque Roads in April 1809. Gambier was controversially cleared of all charges. Newman-Newman's service was in Home Waters and the Baltic Sea, and in 1811 he was tasked with escorting a large convoy from Gothenburg to London in his ship HMS \"Hero\". Returning in late 1811 the convoy, which had joined with parts of the British Baltic Fleet, was struck by a huge storm which wrecked over 30 merchant ships and on 24 December claimed the flagship HMS \"St George\" and HMS \"Defence\". Hundreds of sailors were drowned including Admiral Robert Carthew Reynolds. The next day, Christmas Day 1811, HMS \"Hero\" was also driven ashore, onto the Haak Sands off the Texel. Weather conditions were so severe that no boats could be launched and no rescue attempted and as a result only 12 men from a crew of several hundred reached safety.

He began to produce and direct games, starting with \"Pokémon Ruby\" and \"Sapphire\", and became responsible for approving new character models. His style seeks to keep games accessible while still adding increasing levels of complexity. His work sticks to older mainstays of the series, including a focus on handheld game consoles and 2D graphics. His music draws inspiration from the work of modern celebrated composers like Dmitri Shostakovich, though he used the \"Super Mario\" series as a model of good video game composition.\n\nMasuda was born on January 12, 1968 in Yokohama, Kanagawa Prefecture, Japan. As a child, his family often vacationed in Kyūshū, where many of his relatives still live. There he spent his time catching fish and insects, an act that later influenced his video game design. Masuda modeled the \"Pokémon\" series' Hoenn Region after Kyūshū in an attempt to recapture his memories of summers there. In high school, Masuda played the trombone; he soon discovered classical music, and was drawn in by works like Igor Stravinsky's The Rite of Spring and Shostakovich's Symphony No. 5.\n\nMasuda attended the Japan Electronics College, a technical school in Shinjuku, Tokyo, where he studied computer graphics and the C programming language using a DEC Professional. His daughter Kiri was born in September 2002; he named a character in \"Pokémon Ruby\" and \"Sapphire\" after her.\n\nMasuda has worked at Game Freak since the company's inception in 1989, and has been involved in nearly every title that Game Freak has produced. Masuda was one of the original developers of the \"Pokémon\" series, beginning with \"Pokémon Red\" and \"Green\". He was first hired to compose video game music, where his first game at Game Freak was \"Mendel Palace\", a 1989 puzzle game for the Nintendo Entertainment System. After \"Mendel Palace\", he worked on \"Yoshi\", the company's first collaboration with Nintendo.\n\nWhen the company first began releasing \"Pokémon\" titles, Masuda worked mainly as the composer, though he did minor programming work as well, and later began directing and producing them. His work on the first games included writing the program to play audio in the games, music, and sound effects. Masuda has been directly involved in the naming and design of many Pokémon. He has stated that one of the hardest aspects of design is making sure that a Pokémon's name and attributes will appeal to a global audience. Since \"Pokémon Ruby\" and \"Sapphire\", Masuda has been one of the main employees who approve or reject designs for new Pokémon. He now serves as a member of the Game Freak board of directors.\n\nOn September 28, 2018, Masuda revealed that during the early years of developing \"Pokémon\" games that \"game data was nearly lost in a computer crash\". Masuda described it as \"the most nerve-racking moment in development\", saying \"“We were developing the game on these Unix computer stations called the Sun SPARCstation 1. We’re developing, and they’re these Unix boxes, and they crashed quite a bit\".\n\nOn November 1, 2018, Masuda stated that would likely be his final time serving as director for the main series Pokémon games. In the announcement interview, he stated that he wished to pass on the development torch to the younger generation of developers at Game Freak.\n\nMasuda approaches each of his games with the mindset that a beginner should be able to easily play it. To this end, he layers more complicated concepts, introducing them to the player in a simple manner, and building from there. He believes that handheld systems provide an opportunity for social interaction that cannot be found on non-handheld console systems. He has stated that continuing use of 2D computer graphics has been integral to Pokémon's success.\n\nMasuda's musical style draws from a number of sources, particularly classical music and the works of Igor Stravinsky and Dmitri Shostakovich. His favorite musical genre is techno, and he has looked to the music of the \"Super Mario\" series as an example of video game music that works well. Most of his ideas are inspired from simply observing real life and visualizing how he would design or draw outside objects. As a rule, he does not use previous characters as inspirations for new ones, instead creating each new one from independent sources.\n\n"}

She was the founder of the Woman's Relief Corps and served as its second president. She is best known as the author of army lyrics and poems written for the celebration of military occasions.\n\nShe was the author of: \"Camp-Fire and Memorial Poems\" (1885); \"Dreams of the Ages; a Poem of Columbia\" (1893); \"The Memorial of the Flowers\" (1888), and \"Guarding the Flags (1890)\". Helen Louisa Bostwick Bird and Alice Williams Brotherton were contemporary poets from Ohio.\n\nHer memorial poem, \"Albert Sidney Johnston\", was written by Sherwood at the invitation of the Executive Committee for the Unveiling Ceremonies of the General Albert Sidney Johnston Equestrian Statue, held under the auspices of the Army of the Tennessee Louisiana Division (Ex-Confederate) at New Orleans.\n\nKatharine Margaret Brownlee was born in either Mahoning County, Ohio or Bedford Springs, Pennsylvania) on either September 24, 1841 or September 25, 1841). \n\nShe was a daughter of Judge James and Rebecca (née Mullen) Brownlee of Poland, Ohio; granddaughter of Alexander and Margaret (née Smith) Brownlee and of George and Katharine (née Hammer) Mullen and a descendant of James and Margaret (née Craig) Brownlee, who came to America in 1800.\n\nJames Brownlee Sr. was the Laird of Torfoot, in the parish of Avondale, Lanarkshire, Scotland, and his grandson, James, was successor, by inheritance; but he chose America and emigrated from Scotland to the United States in 1828, and settled in Trumbull County, Ohio, and became associate judge of the third judicial district of which it was a part. She was educated in Poland Union Seminary.\n\nOn September 1, 1859, at the age of 18, she married Isaac R. Sherwood, afterwards General, Secretary of state and Congressman from Ohio. The general was the editor of the Canton, Ohio \"Daily News-Democrat\", and attracted to journalism, she learned everything in the line of newspaper work from typesetting to leader-writing. While the husband was in Congress, Sherman served as Washington correspondent for Ohio journals. In 1883, General Sherwood became the sole proprietor of the \"Toledo Journal]]\"; Kate Sherwood assisted in the editorial management of the paper, until 1886, when Condict C. Packard and E. J. Tippett purchased the establishment. For 10 years, she edited the woman's department of the soldier organ, the \"National Tribune\" of Washington D.C. Her career as a journalist and society woman was varied and busy. She was one of the first members of the Washington Literary Club, and the Sorosis of New York City; she also served as vice-president for Ohio in the first call for a national congress of women.\n\nIn the spring of 1885, she published \"Camp Fire and Memorial Poems,\" a volume of recitations for Grand Army camp fires, which was widely read, and some of the poems were translated into German; it passed through several editions. She was the chosen singer for many national celebratioans, including army reunions, and in 1887, was the only northern poet ever invited by ex-Confederates to celebrate the heroism of a southern soldier. The broad, liberal and delicate manner in which she responded to that significant honor in her poem at the unveiling of the equestrian statue of Albert Sidney Johnston, in New Orleans, Louisiana, elicited praise. \"Mission Ridge\" was an account of the bravery and death of a drummer boy. \"A Soldier's Retrospect\" reminisced after the Civil War. \"The Men who Wore the Shield\" was a spirited patriotic address. \"The Drummer Boy of Mission Ridge\" was an account of the bravery and death of a drummer boy. Having studied French and German, Sherwood's translations of Heinrich Heine, Johann Wolfgang von Goethe , and Friedrich von Bodenstedt were widely copied.\n\nSherwood was the organizer of the first auxiliary to the Grand Army of the Republic outside of New England, and was a founder in 1883 of the national association known as the Woman's Relief Corps, Auxiliary to the Grand Army of the Republic. She served that order as the first National Senior Vice-President and the second National President (1884–85), organized the department of relief and instituted the National Home for Army Nurses, in Geneva, Ohio.\n\nSherwood was a lifelong member of the Presbyterian Church. She made her home in Canton, but died at her home in Washington, D.C. on February 15, 1914, aged 72. Their son, James Brownlee Sherwood, was associated with the father in the publishing business. Their daughter was Lenore Sherwood.\n\n\"Albert Sidney Johnston\" was a memorial poem, written by Sherwood at the invitation of the Executive Committee for the Unveiling Ceremonies of the General Albert Sidney Johnston Equestrian Statue, held under the auspices of the Army of the Tennessee, Louisiana Division (Ex-Confederate) at New Orleans, April 6, 1887, 25th Anniversary of the Battle of Shiloh and of General Johnston's death.

In August 1946, Fargues saved the lives of Cousteau and Frédéric Dumas during their dive into the Fountain of Vaucluse. On September 17, 1947, while attempting to set a new depth record, Maurice Fargues became the first diver to die using an aqualung.\n\nIn late 1945, Petty Officer Maurice Fargues joined the newly formed GRS (now called CEPHISMER), commanded by Philippe Tailliez, with Cousteau as its deputy commander and Dumas as civilian adviser and chief diver. Dumas trained Fargues and the GRS' other two new recruits, Petty Officers Jean-Paul Pinard and Guy Morandière, as Aqua-Lung divers. Maurice Fargues became commander of the diving tender \"VP 8\", a 21,6-meter (72-foot) twin-screw launch.\n\nOn August 27, 1946, the GRS dove into the Fountain of Vaucluse, a mysterious spring in the village of Vaucluse, hoping to discover the secret of its yearly flooding. Maurice Fargues was the operation's surface commander, in charge of the guide rope which allowed divers to communicate with the surface. Tailliez and Morandière dove together first, but they were rapidly affected by a narcosis that almost compromised their return to the surface. When Cousteau and Dumas dove together, they suffered the same symptoms, and Tailliez and Fargues probably saved their lives by pulling them back up to the surface. It was later determined that carbon monoxide had unexpectedly contaminated the air in their cylinders.\n\nIn September 1947, just before the \"Salon Nautique\" in Paris, Cousteau insisted to organize a series of deep diving attempts to determine the maximum depth a scuba diver could reach. On September 17, Maurice Fargues made the first deep diving attempt near the French Navy base at Toulon. Maurice Fargues descended an anchor line with marker slates attached at 10 metres intervals, allowing him to sign his name on them to certify the depth he had reached, and periodically tugged on a safety line attached to his weight belt to let his colleague Frédéric Dumas on the surface know that he was alive. After three minutes, at a record-setting depth of , Maurice Fargues stopped signalling. Philippe Tailliez ordered that he be pulled up, and Jean Pinard dove to meet him at 60 meters depth, only to discover that Fargues was unconscious, his mouthpiece hanging on his chest. Resuscitation attempts were continued for twelve hours, but Fargues was dead. Nitrogen narcosis or oxygen toxicity had caused him to lose his mouthpiece and drown.\n\nFargues' scrawled signature on the slate at confirmed his depth record. The GRS concluded that was the maximum depth a diver using compressed air could reach. In the words of Jacques Cousteau: \"Dumas and I owed our lives to Maurice Fargues, who had resurrected us from the death cave at Vaucluse. We will not be consoled that we were unable to save him.\"\n\nOn September 17, 2007, the sixtieth anniversary of Fargues' death, a room was dedicated in his honor as the \"Salle Maurice Fargues\" at the Musée International de la Plongée Frédéric Dumas in Sanary-sur-Mer, France. Fargues' children, Roselyne and Louis Fargues, were present at the ceremony. The room contains a plaque bearing a photograph of Fargues taken before his final dive and a reproduction of his final scrawled signature.\n\nOn October 18, 2012, a conference was given by Bernard Tailliez, son of Commander Philippe Tailliez, as part of a series of lectures entitled \"Les fils de Philippe Tailliez - 10 ans après\", organised by the \"Service historique de la Défense\" at the \"Escale Castigneau\" (Military port of Toulon), honoring the memory of Philippe Tailliez, Petty Officer Maurice Fargues and the birth of the GRS.

{"id": "1040741", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1040741", "title": "Moral psychology", "text": "Moral psychology\n\nMoral psychology is a field of study in both philosophy and psychology. Some use the term \"moral psychology\" relatively narrowly to refer to the study of moral development. However, others tend to use the term more broadly to include any topics at the intersection of ethics, psychology, and philosophy of mind. Some of the main topics of the field are moral judgment, moral reasoning, moral sensitivity, moral responsibility, moral motivation, moral identity, moral action, moral development, moral diversity, moral character (especially as related to virtue ethics), altruism, psychological egoism, moral luck, moral forecasting, moral emotion, affective forecasting, and moral disagreement.\n\nA moral act is a type of behavior that refers has either a moral or immoral consequence. In many cultures, a moral act refers to an act that entails free will, purity, liberty, honesty, and meaning, whereas an immoral act refers to an act that entails corruption and fraudulence.\n\nSome psychologists that have worked in the field are: Jean Piaget, Lawrence Kohlberg, Carol Gilligan, Elliot Turiel, Jonathan Haidt, Linda Skitka, Leland Saunders, Marc Hauser, C. Daniel Batson, Jean Decety, Joshua Greene, A. Peter McGraw, Philip Tetlock, Darcia Narvaez, Tobias Krettenauer, Liane Young, Daniel Hart, Suzanne Fegley, and Fiery Cushman. Philosophers that have worked in the field include Stephen Stich, John Doris, Joshua Knobe, John Mikhail, Shaun Nichols, Thomas Nagel, Robert C. Roberts, Jesse Prinz, Michael Smith, and R. Jay Wallace.\n\nMoral psychology began with early philosophers such as Aristotle, Plato, and Socrates. They believed that \"to know the good is to do the good\". They analyzed the ways in which people make decisions with regards to moral identity. As the field of psychology began to divide away from philosophy, moral psychology expanded to include risk perception and moralization, morality with regards to medical practices, concepts of self-worth, and the role of emotions when analyzing one's moral identity. In most introductory psychology courses, students learn about moral psychology by studying the psychologist Lawrence Kohlberg, who introduced the moral development theory in 1969. This theory was built on Piaget's observation that children develop intuitions about justice that they can later articulate. The increasing sophistication of articulation of reasoning is a sign of development. Moral cognitive development centered around justice and guided moral action increase with development, resulting in a postconventional thinker that can \"do no other\" than what is reasoned to be the most moral action. But researchers using the Kohlberg model found a gap between what people said was most moral and actions they took. Today, some psychologists and students alike rely on Augusto Blasi's self-model that link ideas of moral judgment and action through moral commitment. Those with moral goals central to the self-concept are more likely to take moral action, as they feel a greater obligation to do so. Those who are motivated will attain a unique moral identity.\n\nHistorically, early philosophers such as Aristotle and Plato engaged in both empirical research and \"a priori\" conceptual analysis about the ways in which people make decisions about issues that raise moral concerns. With the development of psychology as a discipline separate from philosophy, it was natural for psychologists to continue pursuing work in moral psychology, and much of the empirical research of the 20th century in this area was completed by academics working in psychology departments.\n\nToday, moral psychology is a thriving area of research in both philosophy and psychology, even at an interdisciplinary level. For example, the psychologist Lawrence Kohlberg questioned boys and young men about their thought processes when they were faced with a moral dilemma producing one of many very useful empirical studies in the area of moral psychology. As another example, the philosopher Joshua Knobe recently completed an empirical study on how the way in which an ethical problem is phrased dramatically affects an individual's intuitions about the proper moral response to the problem. More conceptually focused research has been completed by researchers such as John Doris. Doris discusses the way in which social psychological experiments—such as the Stanford prison experiments involving the idea of situationism—call into question a key component in virtue ethics: the idea that individuals have a single, environment-independent moral character. As a further example, Shaun Nichols (2004) examines how empirical data on psychopathology suggests that moral rationalism is false.\n\nLawrence Kohlberg was one of the forerunners in the development of an empirical measure for moral reasoning. He proposed six stages broken into 3 categories of moral reasoning that, he believed to be universal to all people in all cultures. Throughout his career, he focused on narrowing his focus deeper and deeper into a bedrock of human moral reasoning. one of his famous accomplishments was the development of a moral dilemma known as \"The Heinz Dilemma\" in which the reader would follow a character, Heinz, through a dilemma to either steal a drug to possibly save his wife from death by cancer, or not steal the drug. Any participants were asked to respond and provide their reasoning for why or why not Heinz should steal the drug for his wife; in so answering, and given their reasoning about why Heinz should or should not steal it, Kohlberg could reliably come to a rational and empirical conclusion about the moral stage the participant was in. \n\nPhilosophers and psychologists have created structured interviews and surveys as a means to study moral psychology and its development.\n\nSince at least 1894, philosophers and psychologists attempted to empirically evaluate the morality of an individual, especially attempting to distinguish adults from children in terms of their judgment, but the efforts failed because they \"attempted to quantify how much morality an individual had—a notably contentious idea—rather than understand the individual's psychological representation of morality\". Lawrence Kohlberg addressed that difficulty in 1963 by modeling evaluative diversity as reflecting a series of developmental stages (à la Jean Piaget). Lawrence Kohlberg's stages of moral development are:\n\nStages 1 and 2 are combined into a single stage labeled \"pre-conventional\", and stages 5 and 6 are combined into a single stage labeled \"post-conventional\" for the same reason; psychologists can consistently categorize subjects into the resulting four stages using the \"Moral Judgement Interview\" which asks subjects why they endorse the answers they do to a standard set of moral dilemmas.\n\nRather than confirm the existence of a single highest stage, Larry Walker's cluster analysis of a wide variety of interview and survey variables for moral exemplars found three types: the \"caring\" or \"communal\" cluster was strongly relational and generative, the \"deliberative\" cluster had sophisticated epistemic and moral reasoning, and the \"brave\" or \"ordinary\" cluster was less distinguished by personality.\n\nBetween 1910 and 1930, in the United States and Europe, several morality tests were developed to classify subjects as fit or unfit to make moral judgments. Test-takers would classify or rank standardized lists of personality traits, hypothetical actions, or pictures of hypothetical scenes. As early as 1926, catalogs of personality tests included sections specifically for morality tests, though critics persuasively argued that they merely measured awareness of social expectations.\n\nMeanwhile, Kohlberg inspired a new wave of morality tests. The Defining Issues Test (dubbed \"Neo-Kohlbergian\" by its constituents) scores relative preference for post-conventional justifications, and the Moral Judgment Test scores consistency of one's preferred justifications. Both treat evaluative ability as similar to IQ (hence the single score), allowing categorization by high score vs. low score.\n\nThe Moral Foundations Questionnaire is based on moral intuitions consistent across cultures: care/harm, fairness/cheating, loyalty/betrayal, authority/subversion, and sanctity/degradation (liberty/oppression may be added). The questions ask respondents to rate what they consider morally relevant post-consciously (i.e. this is not a behavioral measure). The purpose of the questionnaire is to measure the degree to which people rely upon different sets of moral intuitions (which may coexist), rather than to categorize decision-makers, but the first two foundations cluster together with liberal political orientation and the latter three cluster with conservative political orientation.\n\nThe Moral DNA survey by Roger Steare asks respondents to rank their virtues, then divides respondents by three virtue clusters: obedience, care, and reason. The survey was developed for use in business settings, especially to raise awareness of ways perceived workplace discrimination diminishes effective evaluative diversity.\n\nIn 1999, some of Kohlberg's measures were tested when Anne Colby and William Damon published a study in which the development of extraordinary moral development was examined in the lives of moral exemplars. In order to specifically show how people may develop exceptional moral commitments, the researchers focused on the two stories of women seen as moral exemplars. They came from different backgrounds and yet had similar moral development over the course of their lives. After finding these participants that exhibited high levels of moral commitment in their everyday behavior, the researchers utilized the moral judgement interview (MJI) to compare the 23 exemplars (including the two women) with a more ordinary group of people. The researchers also put the 23 exemplars through two standard dilemmas to assess what level they were on in Kohlberg's stages. The intention was to learn more about moral exemplars and to examine the strengths and weaknesses of the Kohlberg measure. It was found that the MJI scores were not clustered at the high end of Kohlberg's scale, they ranged from stage 3 to stage 5. Half landed at the conventional level (stages 3, 3/4, and 4) and the other half landed at the postconventional level (stages 4/5 and 5). Compared to the general population, the scores of the moral exemplars may be somewhat higher than those of groups not selected for outstanding moral behaviour. Researchers noted that the \"moral judgement scores are clearly related to subjects' educational attainment in this study\". Among the participants that had attained college education or above, there was no difference in moral judgement scores between genders. The study noted that although the exemplars' scores may have been higher than those of nonexemplars, it is also clear that one is not required to score at Kohlberg's highest stages in order to exhibit high degrees of moral commitment and exemplary behaviour. Apart from their scores, it was found that the 23 participating moral exemplars described three similar themes within all of their moral developments: certainty, positivity, and the unity of self and moral goals. The unity between self and moral goals was highlighted as the most important theme as it is what truly sets the exemplars apart from the 'ordinary' people. It was discovered that the moral exemplars see their morality as a part of their sense of identity and sense of self, not as a conscious choice or chore. Also, the moral exemplars showed a much broader range of moral concern than did the ordinary people and go beyond the normal acts of daily moral engagements. For example, the moral exemplars would feed their own children, but then go farther and fight to end world hunger on a global scale as well. In order to encourage this strong sense of moral development in children and adolescents, it is recommended to encourage a sense of empowerment and to also show a positive and optimistic approach to life.\n\nEmpirical studies show that reasoning and emotion only moderately predicted moral action. Scholars, such as Blasi, began proposing identity as a motivating factor in moral motivation. Blasi proposed the self model of moral functioning, which described the effects of the judgment of responsibility to perform a moral action, one's sense of moral identity, and the desire for self-consistency on moral action. Blasi also elaborates on the structure of identity and its connection to morality. According to Blasi, there are two aspects that form identity. One of the aspects focuses on the specific contents that make up the self (objective identity content), which include moral ideals. The second refers to the ways in which identity is subjectively experienced (subjective identity experience). As the subjective side of identity matures, the objective side tends to lean towards internal contents like values, beliefs, and goals, rather than external identity contents like physical aspects, behaviors, and relationships. A mature subjective identity yearns for a greater sense of self-consistency. Therefore, identity would serve as a motivation for moral action. \nStudies of moral exemplars have shown that exemplary moral action often results from the intertwining of personal goals and desires with moral goals, and studies on moral behavior also show a correlation between moral identity and action. S. Hardy and G. Carlo raise critical questions about Blasi's model as well, and propose that researchers should seek to better operationalize and measure moral identity and apply findings to moral education and intervention programs.\n\nAnne Colby and William Damon suggest that one's moral identity is formed through that individual's synchronization of their personal and moral goals. This unity of their self and morality is what distinguishes them from non-exemplars and in turn makes them exceptional. Colby and Damon studied moral identity through the narratives of civil rights activist Virginia Foster Durr and Suzie Valadez, who provided services for the poor, whose behavior, actions, and life's works were considered to be morally exemplary by their communities and those with whom they came in contact. Some common characteristics that these moral exemplars possess are certainty, positivity (e.g. enjoyment of work, and optimism), and unity of self and moral goals. The research suggests that a \"transformation of goals\" takes place during the evolution of one's moral identity and development and therefore is not an exercise of self-sacrifice but rather one done with great joy; moral exemplars see their personal goals and moral goals as synonymous. This transformation is not always a deliberate process and is most often a gradual process, but can also be rapidly set off by a triggering event. Triggering events can be anything from a powerful moment in a movie to a traumatic life event, or as in the case of Suzie Valadez, the perception of a vision from God. In many of the moral exemplars interviewed, the triggering events and goal transformation did not take place until their 40s. Moral exemplars are said to have the same concerns and commitments as other moral people but to a greater degree, \"extensions in scope, intensity and breadth\". Furthermore, exemplars possess the ability to be open to new ideas and experiences, also known as an \"active receptiveness\" to things exterior to themselves.\n\nDaniel Hart conducted a study to see how adolescents who engaged in exemplary levels of prosocial behavior viewed themselves. To empirically study self-concept, he used four different conceptual models to illustrate the concept of self: Self-Concept as Content, Self-Concept as Semantic Space, Self-Concept as Hierarchy of Selves, and Self-Concept as Theory. The findings suggested that adolescent caring exemplars formulated their self-concept differently from comparable peers. In a hierarchy of selves model, exemplars were shown to incorporate their \"ideal self\" into their \"actual self\". Among the exemplar group there was more incorporation of parental representations with the \"actual self\". Conversely, there was less incorporation of representations of their best friend or the self expected by the best friend. It is theorized that this is because adolescents are less likely to pick a best friend who is a \"goody-goody\" and deeply involved in service, as well as exemplars possibly having to give up peer expectations in order to engage in service. In a Self-Concept as Theory model, exemplars were most commonly at level 4, a level of self-theory uncommonly reached by adolescents, but common among exemplars.They were also more likely to emphasize academic goals and moral typical activities. There were no significant differences between the exemplars and the control group concerning moral knowledge. On a semantic space analysis, the moral exemplars tended to view their actual self as more integrated with their ideal and expected self.\n\nDavid Wong proposes that we think of cultures in an analogy to a conversation, there are people with different beliefs, values, and norms that can voice their opinion loudly or quietly, but over the course of time these factors can change. A moral culture can provide other members with a kind of \"language\" where there is plenty of room for different \"dialects\", this allows moral identities to be established and voiced more. Opposing ideas can create conflict between those who are close to us, such as family and friends, and strangers. This can bring a greater risk of trying to decide the best course of action in which either party will be affected by it. In essence the notion of Wong's theory is that in order to define our true morality it ultimately comes down to acceptance and being able to accommodate within and between cultures around the world. He also believes that the concept of culture as conversation will help reduce the problems with boundaries between cultures, reconcile the autonomy with the cultural aspect of moral identity and call into question the understanding of healthy and well developed moral identity.\n\nAccording to Blasi's theory on moral character, moral character is identified by the person's set of the morality of virtues and vices. He theorized willpower, moral desires, and integrity have the capability for a person to act morally by the hierarchical order of virtues. He believed that the \"highest\" and complex of virtues are expressed by willpower while the \"lowest\" and simplistic of virtues are expressed integrity. He essentially stated that to have the lower virtues, one must have one or more of the higher virtues. The end goals of moral development identity are to establish and act upon core goals, as well as and use one's strengths to make a difference.\n\nA \"moral self\" is fostered by mutually-responsive parenting in childhood. Children with responsive parents develop more empathy, prosociality, a moral self and conscience. Darcia Narvazes describes the neurobiological and social elements of early experience and their effects on moral capacities.\n\nThe moral self results when people integrate moral values into their self-concept. Research on the moral self has mostly focused on adolescence as a critical time period for the integration of self and morality (i.e. self and morality are traditionally seen as separate constructs that become integrated in adolescence. However, the moral self may be established around age 2–3 years. In fact, children as young as 5 years-old are able to consistently identify themselves as having certain moral behavioral preferences. Children's moral self is also increasingly predictive of moral emotions with age.\n\nKristiansen and Hotte review many research articles regarding people's values and attitudes and whether they guide behavior. With the research they reviewed and their own extension of Ajzen and Fishbein's theory of reasoned action, they conclude that value-attitude-behavior depends on the individual and their moral reasoning. They also pointed out that there are such things as good values and bad values. Good values are those that guide our attitudes and behaviors and allow us to express and define ourselves. It also involves the ability to know when values are appropriate in response to the situation or person that you are dealing with. Bad values on the other hand are those that are relied on so much that it makes you unresponsive to the needs and perspectives of others.\n\nAnother issue that Kristiansen and Hotte discovered through their research was that individuals tended to \"create\" values to justify their reactions to certain situations, which they called the \"value justification hypothesis\". The authors use an example from feminist Susan Faludi's journal entry of how during the period when women were fighting for their right to vote, a New Rights group appealed to society's ideals of \"traditional family values\" as an argument against the new law in order to mask their own \"anger at women's rising independence.\" Their theory is comparable to Jonathan Haidt's social intuition theory, where individuals justify their intuitive emotions and actions through reasoning in a post-hoc fashion.\n\nKristiansen and Hotte also found that independent selves had actions and behaviors that are influenced by their own thoughts and feelings, but Interdependent selves have actions, behaviors and self-concepts that were based on the thoughts and feelings of others. Westerners have two dimensions of emotions, activation and pleasantness. The Japanese have one more, the range of their interdependent relationships. Markus and Kitayama found that these two different types of values had different motives. Westerners, in their explanations, show self-bettering biases. Easterners, on the other hand, tend to focus on \"other-oriented\" biases.\n\nPsychologist S. H. Schwartz defines individual values as \"conceptions of the desirable that guide the way social actors (e.g.organisational leaders, policymakers, individual persons) select actions, evaluate people an events, and explain their actions and evaluations.\" Cultural values form the basis for social norms, laws, customs and practices. While individual values vary case by case (a result of unique life experience), the average of these values point to widely held cultural beliefs (a result of shared cultural values).\n\nPiaget and Kohlberg both developed stages of development to understand the timing and meaning of moral decisions. They were interested in placing people into moral categories or stages of development instead of identifying how each individual's views and behaviors are affected by their background and personality. In 2004, D. Lapsley and D. Narvaez outlined how social cognition explains aspects of moral functioning. The social cognitive approach to personality has six critical resources of moral personality: cognition, self-processes, affective elements of personality, changing social context, lawful situational variability, and the integration of other literature. Lapsley and Narvaez suggest that moral values and actions stem from more than our virtues and are controlled by a set of self-created schemas (cognitive structures that organize related concepts and integrate past events). They claim that schemas are \"fundamental to our very ability to notice dilemmas as we appraise the moral landscape\" and that over time, people develop greater \"moral expertise\". \n\nJean Piaget, in watching children play games, noted how their rationales for cooperation changed with experience and maturation. He identified two stages, heteronomous (morality centered outside the self) and autonomous (internalized morality). Lawerence Kohlberg sought to expand Piaget's work. His cognitive developmental theory of moral reasoning dominated the field for decades. He focused on moral development as one's progression in the capacity to reason about justice. Kohlberg's interview method included hypothetical moral dilemmas or conflicts of interest. The most widely known moral scenario used in his research is usually referred to as the Heinz dilemma. He interviewed children and described what he saw in six stages (claiming that \"anyone who interviewed children about dilemmas and who followed them longitudinally in time would come to our six stages and no others).\n\nIn the Heinz dilemma, Heinz's wife is dying of cancer and the town's druggist has something that can help her, but is charging more than Heinz can afford; Heinz steals the drug to save his wife's life. Children aged 10, 13, and 16 years old were asked if what Heinz did was morally justified. Kohlberg's stages of moral development consisted of six stages and three levels. At the Preconventional level, the first two stages included the punishment-and-obedience orientation and the instrumental-relativist orientation. The next level, the conventional level, included the interpersonal concordance or \"good boy – nice girl\" orientation, along with the \"law and order\" orientation. Lastly, the final Postconventional level consisted of the social-contract, legalistic orientation and the universal-ethical-principle orientation. Children progressed from stage one, where they began to recognize higher authorities and that there are set rules and punishments for breaking those rules; to stage six, where good principles make a good society. They also start to define which of the principles are most agreeable and fair. According to Kohlberg, an individual is considered more cognitively mature depending on their stage of moral reasoning, which grows as they advance in education and world experience. One of the examples that Kohlberg gives is called \"cognitive-moral conflict\", wherein an individual who is currently in one stage of moral reasoning has their beliefs challenged by a surrounding peer group. Through this challenge of beliefs, the individual engages in \"reflective reorganization\", which allows for movement to a new stage to occur.\n\nPrevious moral development scales, particularly Kohlberg's, assert that moral reasoning is dominated by one main perspective: justice. However, in a study done by Carol Gilligan and Jane Attanucci, they argue that there is an additional perspective to moral reasoning, known as the care perspective. The justice perspective draws attention to inequality and oppression, while striving for reciprocal rights and equal respect for all. The care perspective draws attention to the ideas of detachment and abandonment, while striving for attention and response to people who need it. Care Orientation is relationally based. It has a more situational focus that is dependent on the needs of others as opposed to Justice Orientation's objectivity. Gilligan and Attanucci analyzed male and female responses to moral situations thought up by the participant; they found that a majority of participants represent both care and justice in their moral orientations. In addition, they found that men tend to utilize the justice perspective more often than women, and women tend to use the care perspective more often than men. However, reviews by others have found that Gilligan's theory was not supported by empirical studies since orientations are individual dependent. In fact, in neo-Kohlbergian studies with the Defining Issues Test, females tend to get slightly higher scores than males.\n\nMetcalfe and Mischel offered a new theory of willpower that focused on delayed gratification. They proposed a \"hot/cool\" structure of analysis to deprive the way one controls the way stimulus is interpreted and willpower is exerted. The hot system is referred to as the \"go\" system whereas the cool system is referred to as the \"know\" system. The hot system is characterized as being highly emotional, reflexive, and impulsive. This system leads to go response (instant gratification) and therefore undermines efforts in self-control. The cool system is characterized as being cognitive, emotionally neutral/flexible, slow, integrated, contemplative, and strategic. The hot system develops early in life, whereas the cool system develops later, as it relies on particular brain structures, notably the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus, and particular cognitive capacities that develop later. With age, there is a shift of dominance from the hot system to the cool system. The balance between them is determined by stress, developmental levels, and a person's self-regulating dynamics.\n\nBaumeister, Miller, and Delaney explored the notion of willpower by first defining the self as being made up of three parts: reflexive consciousness, or the person's awareness of their environment and of himself as an individual; interpersonal being, which seeks to mold the self into one that will be accepted by others; and executive function. They stated, \"[T]he self can free its actions from being determined by particular influences, especially those of which it is aware\". The three prevalent theories of willpower describe it as a limited supply of energy, as a cognitive process, and as a skill that is developed over time. Research has largely supported that willpower works like a \"moral muscle\" with a limited supply of strength that may be depleted, conserved, or replenished, and that a single act requiring much self-control can significantly deplete the \"supply\" of willpower. While exertion reduces the ability to engage in further acts of willpower in the short term, such exertions actually improve a person's ability to exert willpower for extended periods in the long run. Muraven, Baumeister and Tice conducted a study on self-regulation and its relationship to power and stamina. This study demonstrated that the moral muscle, when exercised, is strengthened in stamina but not necessarily in power—meaning the subjects became less susceptible to the depletion of self-regulatory faculties. Their study showed that more complex tasks like regulating one's mood present substantive difficulty and may not be as effective in increasing willpower as other, more straight forward activities like posture correction or maintaining a food journal. However, over time, the \"moral muscle\" may be exercised by performing small tasks of self-control, such as attempting to correct slouched posture, resist desserts, or complete challenging self-regulatory tasks. Lastly, Baumeister argues that self-management, or the ability to alter one's responses, is a kind of skill that develops as one grows up. There are many things that can help a person replenish this source of will power, such as meditation, rest, and positive emotion between tasks. They also showed that there is a conservation effect when it comes to will power: people tend to realize that they are using up their stored-up will and self-control and then use it as needed.\n\nAdditional studies have been conducted that may cast doubt on the idea of ego-depletion. One experiment that sought to test this ego-depletion theory was that of Hagger. Hagger challenged the resource depletion explanation that was found by Maruven, Tice, and Baumeister by highlighting there may have been small study bias, as well as, publication bias. Previous literature casting doubt on the ego-depletion analysis included a meta-analysis study in 2014, carried out by Carter et al, which provided significant evidence against the ego-depletion theory and found evidence of small study bias. Hagger carried out a replication of the ego-depletion experiment with a larger more diverse population and stricter experimental protocol to cast doubt on the significance of the resource depletion theory. Twenty-four different labs across the world replicated this study following strict protocols (results of 23 labs were used in the final report). Participants were randomly assigned to control or experimental group. The experimental group participated in the letter \"e\" depletion version of the task and the control group were administered the letter \"e\" no- depletion version of the task. Both groups first participated in practice sessions and then continued onto the actual test. Both groups were then asked to self- report items measuring effort, fatigue, difficulty, and frustration on the first task. Participants then continued on to complete the MSIT and results from this task were examined. Reaction time variability (RTV) was the primary variable observed and reaction time (RT) was the second variable. Researchers observed whether RTV was higher for participants assigned to the depletion condition compared to those assigned to the no-depletion condition. Any low accuracy results on either task (less than 80%) were excluded from the results. Twenty of the twenty-three lab replications had a 95% confidence intervals for the small effect size for ego-depletion RTV and RT on the MSIT. Results supported a null effect of the ego-depletion theory. While this one study is not enough to completely debunk the ego-depletion theory, it does cast considerable doubt about the effect size of previous study's findings.\n\nJames Rest reviewed the literature on moral functioning and identified at least four components necessary for a moral behavior to take place:\nReynolds and Ceranic researched the effects of social consensus on one's moral behavior. Depending on the level of social consensus (high vs. low), moral behaviors will require greater or lesser degrees of moral identity to motivate an individual to make a choice and endorse a behavior. Also, depending on social consensus, particular behaviors may require different levels of moral reasoning.\n\nIn looking at the relations between moral values, attitudes, and behaviors, previous research asserts that there is no dependable correlation between these three aspects, differing from what we would assume. In fact, it seems to be more common for people to label their behaviors with a justifying value rather than having a value beforehand and then acting on it. There are some people that are more likely to act on their personal values: those low in self-monitoring and high in self-consciousness, due to the fact that they are more aware of themselves and less aware of how others may perceive them. Self consciousness here means being literally more conscious of yourself, not fearing judgement or feeling anxiety from others. Social situations and the different categories of norms can be telling of when people may act in accordance with their values, but this still isn't concrete either. People will typically act in accordance with social, contextual and personal norms, and there is a likelihood that these norms can also follow one's moral values. Though there are certain assumptions and situations that would suggest a major value-attitude-behavior relation, there is not enough research to confirm this phenomenon.\n\nIn 2001, Jonathan Haidt introduced his social intuitionist models which claimed that with few exceptions, moral judgments are made based upon socially-derived intuitions. Moral intuitions happen immediately, automatically, and unconsciously.\n\nThis model suggests that moral reasoning is largely post-hoc rationalizations that function to justify one's instinctual reactions. He provides four arguments to doubt causal importance of reason. Firstly, Haidt argues that since there is a dual process system in the brain when making automatic evaluations or assessments, this same process must be applicable to moral judgement as well. The second argument contains evidence from Chaiken that says social motives cause humans to be biased and to cohere and relate to other's attitudes in order to achieve higher societal goals, which in turn influences one's moral judgment. Thirdly, Haidt found that people have post hoc reasoning when faced with a moral situation, this a posteriori (after the fact) explanation gives the illusion of objective moral judgement but in reality is subjective to one's gut feeling. Lastly, research has shown that moral emotion has a stronger link to moral action than moral reasoning, citing Damasio's research on psychopaths and Batson's empathy-altruism hypothesis.\n\nIn 2008, Joshua Greene published a compilation which, in contrast to Haidt's model, suggested that fair moral reasoning does take place. A \"deontologist\" is someone who has rule-based morality that is mainly focused on duties and rights; in contrast, a \"consequentialist\" is someone who believes that only the best overall consequences ultimately matter. Generally speaking, individuals who answer to moral dilemmas in a consequential manner take longer to respond and show frontal-lobe activity (associated with cognitive processing). Individuals who answer to moral dilemmas in a deontological manner, however, generally answer more quickly and show brain activity in the amygdala (associated with emotional processing).\n\nIn regard to moral intuitions, researchers Jonathan Haidt and Jesse Graham performed a study to research the difference between the moral foundations of political liberals and political conservatives. Haidt and Graham expanded on previous research done by Shweder and his three ethics theory. Shweder’s theory consisted of three moral ethics: the ethic of autonomy, the ethic of community, and the ethic of divinity. Haidt and Graham took this theory and extended it to discuss the five psychological systems that more specifically make up the three moral ethics theory. These Five Foundations of Morality and their importance vary throughout each culture and construct virtues based on their emphasized foundation. \nThey challenged individuals to question the legitimacy of their moral world and introduced the five psychological foundations of morality:\nThe five foundations theory are both a nativist and cultural-psychological theory. Modern moral psychology concedes that \"morality is about protecting individuals\" and focuses primarily on issues of justice (harm/care and fairness/reciprocity). Their research found that \"justice and related virtues…make up half of the moral world for liberals, while justice-related concerns make up only one fifth of the moral world for conservatives\". Liberals value harm/care and fairness/reciprocity significantly more than the other moralities, while conservatives value all five equally.\n\nHadit and Graham suggest a compromise can be found to allow liberals and conservatives to see eye-to-eye. They suggest that the five foundations can be used as \"doorway\" to allow liberals to step to the conservative side of the \"wall\" put up between these two political affiliations on major political issues (i.e. legalizing gay marriage). If liberals try to consider the latter three foundations in addition to the former two (therefore adopting all five foundations like conservatives for a brief amount of time) they could understand where the conservatives viewpoints stem from and long-lasting political issues could finally be settled.\n\nAugusto Blasi emphasizes the importance of moral responsibility and reflection as one analyzes an intuition. His main argument is that some, if not most, intuitions tend to be self-centered and self-seeking. Blasi critiques Haidt in describing the average person and questioning if this model (having an intuition, acting on it, and then justifying it) always happens. He came to the conclusion that not everyone follows this model. In more detail, Blasi proposes Haidt's five default positions on intuition.\nBecause such are the empirical facts, the \"rationalistic\" theories and methods of Piaget and Kohlberg are rejected. Blasi argues that Haidt does not provide adequate evidence to support his position.\n\nMoral reasoning has been the focus of most study of morality dating all the way back to Plato and Aristotle. The emotive side of morality has been looked upon with disdain, as subservient to the higher, rational, moral reasoning, with scholars like Piaget and Kohlberg touting moral reasoning as the key forefront of morality. However, in the last 30–40 years, there has been a rise in a new front of research: moral emotions as the basis for moral behavior. This development began with a focus on empathy and guilt, but has since moved on to encompass new emotional scholarship stocks like anger, shame, disgust, awe, and elevation. With the new research, theorists have begun to question whether moral emotions might hold a larger in determining morality, one that might even surpass that of moral reasoning.\n\nThere have generally been two approaches taken by philosophers to define moral emotion. The first \"is to specify the formal conditions that make a moral statement (e.g., that is prescriptive, that it is universalizable, such as expedience)\". This first approach is more tied to language and the definitions we give to a moral emotions. The second approach \"is to specify the material conditions of a moral issue, for example, that moral rules and judgments 'must bear on the interest or welfare either of society as a whole or at least of persons other than the judge or agent'\". This definition seems to be more action based. It focuses on the outcome of a moral emotion. The second definition is more preferred because it is not tied to language and therefore can be applied to prelinguistic children and animals. Moral emotions are \"emotions that are linked to the interests or welfare either of society as a whole or at least of persons other than the judge or agent.\"\n\nThere is a debate whether there is a set of basic emotions or if there are \"scripts or set of components that can be mixed and matched, allowing for a very large number of possible emotions\". Even those arguing for a basic set acknowledge that there are variants of each emotion. Psychology Paul Ekman calls these variants \"families\":\n\nHaidt would suggest that the higher the emotionality of a moral agent, the more likely the agent is to act morally. He uses the term \"disinterested elicitor\" to describe an event or situation that provokes emotions in us even when these emotions do not have anything to do with our own personal welfare. It is these elicitors that cause people to participate in what he calls \"prosocial action tendencies\" (actions that benefit society). Haidt explains moral emotions as \"emotion families\", in which each family contains emotions that may be similar although not exactly the same. These moral emotions are provoked by eliciting events that often lead to prosocial action tendencies. Each person's likelihood of prosocial action is determined by his or her degree of emotionality. \n\nAccording to Haidt, there are four different moral emotion families: the \"other-condemning emotions\" (contempt, anger, disgust), the \"self-conscience emotions\" (shame, embarrassment, and guilt), the \"other suffering emotions\" (compassion and sympathy), and the \"other-praising family\" (gratitude, awe, and elevation). These emotions are moral emotions based on grounds that they can all lead to prosocial action tendencies. \n\nEmpathy also plays a large role in altruism. The empathy-altruism hypothesis states that feelings of empathy for another leads to an altruistic motivation to help that person. In contrast, there may also be an egoistic motivation to help someone in need. This is the Hullian tension-reduction model in which personal distress caused by another in need leads the person to help in order to alleviate their own discomfort.\n\nBatson, Klein, Highberger, and Shaw conducted experiments where they manipulated people through the use of empathy-induced altruism to make decisions that required them to show partiality to one individual over another. The first experiment involved a participant from each group to choose someone to experience a positive or negative task. These groups included a non-communication, communication/low-empathy, and communication/high-empathy. They were asked to make their decisions based on these standards resulting in the communication/high-empathy group showing more partiality in the experiment than the other groups due to being successfully manipulated emotionally. Those individuals who they successfully manipulated reported that despite feeling compelled in the moment to show partiality, they still felt they had made the more \"immoral\" decision since they followed an empathy-based emotion rather than adhering to a justice perspective of morality.\n\nBatson, Klein, Highberger, & Shaw conducted two experiments on empathy-induced altruism, proposing that this can lead to actions that violate the justice principle. The second experiment operated similarly to the first using low-empathy and high-empathy groups. Participants were faced with the decision to move an ostensibly ill child to an \"immediate help\" group versus leaving her on a waiting list after listening to her emotionally-driven interview describing her condition and the life it has left her to lead. Those who were in the high-empathy group were more likely than those in the low-empathy group to move the child higher up the list to receive treatment earlier. When these participants were asked what the more moral choice was, they agreed that the more moral choice would have been to not move this child ahead of the list at the expense of the other children. In this case, it is evident that when empathy induced altruism is at odds with what is seen as moral, oftentimes empathy induced altruism has the ability to win out over morality.\n\nRecently neuroscientist Jean Decety, drawing on empirical research in evolutionary theory, developmental psychology, social neuroscience, and psychopathy, argued that empathy and morality are neither systematically opposed to one another, nor inevitably complementary.\n\nEmmons (2009) defines gratitude as a natural emotional reaction and a universal tendency to respond positively to another's benevolence. Gratitude is motivating and leads to what Emmons' describes as \"upstream reciprocity\". This is the passing on of benefits to third parties instead of returning benefits to one's benefactors (Emmons, 2009).\n\nLinda Skitka and colleagues have introduced the concept of moral conviction, which refers to a \"strong and absolute belief that something is right or wrong, moral or immoral.\" According to Skitka's integrated theory of moral conviction (ITMC), attitudes held with moral conviction, known as moral mandates, differ from strong but non-moral attitudes in a number of important ways. Namely, moral mandates derive their motivational force from their perceived universality, perceived objectivity, and strong ties to emotion. Perceived universality refers to the notion that individuals experience moral mandates as transcending persons and cultures; additionally, they are regarded as matters of fact. Regarding association with emotion, ITMC is consistent with Jonathan Haidt's social intuitionist model in stating that moral judgments are accompanied by discrete moral emotions (i.e., disgust, shame, guilt). Importantly, Skitka maintains that moral mandates are not the same thing as moral values. Whether an issue will be associated with moral conviction varies across persons.\n\nOne of the main lines of IMTC research addresses the behavioral implications of moral mandates. Individuals prefer greater social and physical distance from attitudinally dissimilar others when moral conviction was high. This effect of moral conviction could not be explained by traditional measures of attitude strength, extremity, or centrality. Skitka, Bauman, and Sargis placed participants in either attitudinally heterogeneous or homogenous groups to discuss procedures regarding two morally mandated issues, abortion and capital punishment. Those in attitudinally heterogeneous groups demonstrated the least amount of goodwill towards other group members, the least amount of cooperation, and the most tension/defensiveness. Furthermore, individuals discussing a morally-mandated issue were less likely to reach a consensus compared to those discussing non-moral issues.\n\nIn \"Unto Others: the Evolution and Psychology of Unselfish Behavior\" (1998), Elliott Sober and David Sloan Wilson demonstrated that diverse moralities could evolve through group selection. In particular, they dismantled the idea that natural selection will favor a homogeneous population in which all creatures care only about their own personal welfare and/or behave only in ways which advance their own personal reproduction. Tim Dean has advanced the more general claim that moral diversity would evolve through frequency-dependent selection because each moral approach is vulnerable to a different set of situations which threatened our ancestors.\n\nMore recent attempts to develop an integrated model of moral motivation have identified at least six different levels of moral functioning, each of which has been shown to predict some type of moral or prosocial behavior: moral intuitions, moral emotions, moral virtues/vices (behavioral capacities), moral values, moral reasoning, and moral willpower. This social intuitionist model of moral motivation suggests that moral behaviors are typically the product of multiple levels of moral functioning, and are usually energized by the \"hotter\" levels of intuition, emotion, and behavioral virtue/vice. The \"cooler\" levels of values, reasoning, and willpower, while still important, are proposed to be secondary to the more affect-intensive processes.\n\nPsychologist Jonathan Haidt's moral foundations theory examines the way morality varies between cultures and identifies five fundamental moral values shared by different societies and individuals: care for others, fairness, loyalty, authority and purity.\n\nSome research shows that people tend to self-segregate based on moral or moral-political values.\n\nThe triune ethics theory (TET) has been proposed by Darcia Narvaez as a metatheory that highlights the relative contributions to moral development of biological inheritance (including human evolutionary adaptations), environmental influences on neurobiology, and the role of culture. TET proposes three ethics that are the foundation or motivation for all ethics: security (or safety), engagement, and imagination. They differ not only in the recency of evolutionary development but also in their relative capacity to override one another. The study looks back to people in the Pleistocene era and the environment of evolutionary adaptedness (EEA), relating to their early-life supports and its relation to moral functioning. The long term breastfeeding, the constant holding or touching, the frequency of caregivers other than mother, multiage playgroups, and the quick responsiveness to cries during that era is the type of caregiving that supports our biological systems. Current caregiving such as hospital births, solo sleeping, and physical isolation are not the types of early life caregiving to which humans are adapted. The article also mentions \"dearth of touch\" or faulty serotonin receptors affects society, and how they affect our society. There are higher rates of depression and anxiety, which both affect general and moral functioning. There are two categories of the effects of childrearing on moral functioning, dispositional and situational effects. There are two hypotheses relating to the dispositional effects of childrearing on moral functioning. First, \"a personality may cohere around being more or less oriented to each of the three ethics\". Second, \"during critical periods of brain and personality development 'attachment' and 'trust' aspects of personality development are deeply influenced, affecting the structure and wiring of brain systems\". Lastly, there are situational effects. These relate to the idea that \"moral personality has a dispositional signature within particular situations: person and situation interact with dispositional regularity\".\n\nThe security ethic is based in the oldest part of the brain, involving the R-complex or the extrapyramidal system. The security ethic is triggered stressors that activate primal instincts and fight-or-flight responses. These are concerned or centered on safety, survival, and thriving in an environment (or biological system). With these systems present at birth, the security ethic is conditioned during sensitive periods of development (such as infancy), life experience, and trauma. Studies have shown that a dearth of touch in early years result in an underdevelopment of serotonin receptors. Children with faulty serotonin receptors are susceptible to somatosensory affectional deprivation, a condition related to depression, violent behavior, and stimulus seeking. As an adult, if serotonin receptors are not properly functioning, an individual is more prone to depression and anxiety. If receptor are damaged, and one becomes fixated at this ethic, they can be seen as cold, closed-minded, and aggressive. This ethic is most responsible for racism and hate towards outside groups.\n\nThe ethic of engagement is centered in the upper limbic system or the visceral-emotional nervous system. The limbic system allows for external and internal emotional signaling and is critical to emotion, identity, memory for ongoing experience, and an individual's sense of reality and truth. The ethic of engagement refers to relational attunement in the moment, which the stress response prevents, focusing on social bonding. It relies significantly on caregiver influence for its development in early childhood. The engagement ethic is strongly associated with the hormone oxytocin, which has a strong presence during breastfeeding between a mother and child. Oxytocin is essential for building the trust between mother and child.\n\nThe imagination ethic allows a person to step away from the impetuous emotional responses of the older parts of the brain and consider alternative actions based on logic and reason. It is centered in the neocortex and related thalamic structures, including the frontal lobes used for reasoning and judgement skills. It is focused on the outside world and allows for the integration and coordination of the other parts of the brain to allow for imaginative thinking and strategic problem solving. The ethic of imagination involves integrating internal information with external information, allowing an adult to acknowledge and possibly reject more emotional responses from the security or engagement ethics. The imagination ethic can build on the self-protective states of the security ethic (vicious or detached imagination) or of the prosocial engagement ethic (communal imagination).\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "79449", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=79449", "title": "Multiple birth", "text": "Multiple birth\n\nA multiple birth is the culmination of one multiple pregnancy, wherein the mother delivers two or more offspring. A term most applicable to placental species, multiple births occur in most kinds of mammals, with varying frequencies. Such births are often named according to the number of offspring, as in \"twins\" and \"triplets\". In non-humans, the whole group may also be referred to as a \"litter\", and multiple births may be more common than single births. Multiple births in humans are the exception and can be exceptionally rare in the largest mammals.\n\nEach fertilized egg (zygote) may produce a single embryo, or it may split into two or more embryos, each carrying the same genetic material. Fetuses resulting from different zygotes are called \"fraternal\" and share only 50% of their genetic material, as ordinary full siblings from separate births do. Fetuses resulting from the same zygote share 100% of their genetic material and hence are called \"identical\". Identical twins are always the same sex, except in cases of Klinefelter syndrome (also known as XXY syndrome and 47,XXY syndrome).\n\nA multiple pregnancy may be the result of the fertilization of a single egg that then splits to create identical fetuses, or it may be the result of the fertilization of multiple eggs that create fraternal fetuses, or it may be a combination of these two. A multiple pregnancy from a single zygote is called \"monozygotic\", from two zygotes is called \"dizygotic\", or from three or more zygotes is called \"polyzygotic\".\n\nSimilarly, the siblings themselves from a multiple birth may be referred to as monozygotic if they are identical or as polyzygotic if they are fraternal.\n\nTerms used for the number of offspring in a multiple birth:\n\nTerms used for multiple births or the genetic relationships of their offspring:\n\nMultiple pregnancies are also classified by how the fetuses are surrounded by one or more placentas and amniotic sacs; the placentas are referenced as \"chorions\":\n\nIn humans, the average length of pregnancy (two weeks fewer than gestation) is 38 weeks with a single fetus. This average decreases for each additional fetus: to thirty-six weeks for twin births, thirty-two weeks for triplets, and thirty weeks for quadruplets. With the decreasing gestation time, the risks from immaturity at birth and subsequent viability increase with the size of the sibling group. Only as of the twentieth century have more than four all survived infancy.\n\nRecent history has also seen increasing numbers of multiple births. In the United States, it has been estimated that by 2011, 36% of twin births and 78% of triplet and higher-order births resulted from conception by assisted reproductive technology.\n\nTwins are by far the most common form of multiple births in humans. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report more than 132,000 sets of twins out of 3.9 million births of all kinds each year, about 3.4%, or 1 in 30.\n\nIdentical triplets come from a monozygotic pregnancy, three fetuses from one egg. The most common set, strictly fraternal triplets, comes from a polyzygotic pregnancy of three eggs. Between these types, triplets that include an identical (monozygotic) pair of siblings plus a fraternal sibling are the result of a dizygotic pregnancy, where one zygote divides into two fetuses and the other doesn't.\n\nTriplets are far less common than twins, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, accounting for only about 4300 sets in 3.9 million births, just a little more than 0.1%, or 1 in 1000. According to the American Society of Reproductive Medicine, only about 10% of these are identical triplets: about 1 in ten thousand. Nevertheless, only 4 sets of identical triplets were reported in the U.S. during 2015, about one in a million. According to Victor Khouzami, Chairman of Obstetrics at Greater Baltimore Medical Center, \"No one really knows the incidence\".\n\nIdentical triplets or quadruplets are very rare and result when the original fertilized egg splits and then one of the resultant cells splits again (for triplets) or, even more rarely, a further split occurs (for quadruplets). The odds of having identical triplets is unclear. News articles and other non-scientific organizations give odds from one in 60,000 to one in 200 million pregnancies.\n\nQuadruplets are much rarer than twins or triplets. As of 2007, there were approximately 3500 sets recorded worldwide. Quadruplet births are becoming increasingly common due to fertility treatments. There are around 70 sets of all-identical quadruplets worldwide. Many sets of quadruplets contain a mixture of identical and fraternal siblings, such as three identical and one fraternal, two identical and two fraternal, or two pairs of identicals. One famous set of identical quadruplets was the Genain quadruplets, all of whom developed schizophrenia.\nQuadruplets are sometimes referred to as \"quads\" in Britain.\n\nQuintuplets occur naturally in 1 in 55,000,000 births. The first quintuplets known to survive infancy were the all-female Canadian Dionne Quintuplets, born in 1934. Quintuplets are sometimes referred to as \"quins\" in the UK and \"quints\" in North America.\n\nBorn in Liverpool, England on 18 November 1983, the Walton sextuplets were the world's first all-female surviving sextuplets, and the world's fourth known set of surviving sextuplets. Another well-known set of sextuplets is the Gosselin sextuplets, born May 10, 2004 in Hershey, Pennsylvania. Reality television shows called Jon & Kate Plus 8 and later Kate Plus 8 have chronicled the lives of these sextuplets.\n\nIn 1997, the McCaughey septuplets were born in Carlisle, Iowa. Multiple births of as many as eight babies have been born alive, the first set on record to the Chukwu family in Texas in 1998; one died and seven survived. In 2009, a second set, the Suleman octuplets, were born in Bellflower, California. As of 2014, all were still alive shortly before their fifth birthday.\n\nThere have been a few sets of nonuplets (9) in which a few babies were born alive, though none lived longer than a few days. There have been cases of human pregnancies that started out with ten, eleven, twelve or fifteen fetuses, but no instances of live births. The pregnancies of the 10, 11 and 15 fetuses have all resulted from fertility medications and assisted reproductive technology (ART). However, there has been one documented case when 12 fetuses were conceived naturally.\n\nThe frequency of \"N\" multiple births from natural pregnancies has been given as approximately 1:89 (\"Hellin's law\") and as about 1:80. This gives:\n\nNorth American dizygotic twinning occurs about once in 83 conceptions, and triplets about once in 8000 conceptions. US figures for 2010 were:\n\nHuman multiple births can occur either naturally (the woman ovulates multiple eggs or the fertilized egg splits into two) or as the result of infertility treatments such as IVF (several embryos are often transferred to compensate for lower quality) or fertility drugs (which can cause multiple eggs to mature in one ovulatory cycle).\n\nFor reasons that are not yet known, the older a woman is, the more likely she is to have a multiple birth naturally. It is theorized that this is due to the higher level of follicle-stimulating hormone that older women sometimes have as their ovaries respond more slowly to FSH stimulation.\n\nThe number of multiple births has increased over the last decade. For example, in Canada between 1979 and 1999, the number of multiple birth babies increased 35%. Before the advent of ovulation-stimulating drugs, triplets were quite rare (approximately 1 in 8000 births) and higher-order births much rarer still. Much of the increase can probably be attributed to the impact of fertility treatments, such as in-vitro fertilization. Younger patients who undergo treatment with fertility medication containing artificial FSH, followed by intrauterine insemination, are particularly at risk for multiple births of higher order.\nCertain factors appear to increase the likelihood that a woman will naturally conceive multiples. These include:\n\nThe increasing use of fertility drugs and consequent increased rate of multiple births has made the phenomenon of multiples more frequent and hence more visible. In 2004 the birth of sextuplets, six children, to Pennsylvania couple Kate and Jon Gosselin helped them to launch their television series, originally \"Jon & Kate Plus 8\" and (following their divorce) \"Kate Plus 8\", which became the highest-rated show on the \"TLC\" network.\n\nBabies born from multiple-birth pregnancies are much more likely to result in premature birth than those from single pregnancies. 51% of twins and 91% of triplets are born preterm, compared to 9.4% in singletons. 14% of twins and 41% of triplets are even born \"very preterm\", compared to 1.7% in singletons.\n\nAt present, there is no way to stop twins being born early. In women with single pregnancies drugs called betamimetics can relax the muscles of the uterus and delay birth. Giving betamimetics can give more time to give steroids, for the baby’s lung development, or to transfer the mother to a hospital with a special care unit.\n\nHowever, there is not enough evidence to say whether or not women with twin pregnancies should be given oral betamimetics to reduce the risk of preterm birth. In some studies betamimetics have reduced the rate of preterm labour in twin pregnancies however the studies are too small to draw any solid conclusions. Likewise, putting a stitch in the neck of the womb (a cervical suture) to prevent premature birth has not been shown to work in women carrying more than one baby due to the small sample sizes in the studies.\n\nThe preterm births also result in multiples tending to have a lower birth weight compared to singletons.\n\nSome evidence indicates that only 1.10% of singletons are born with a very low birth weight and 10.12% twins and 31.88% triplets were found to be born with very low birth weight. This study was conducted by looking at the statistics from the U.S. Natality Files (5).\n\nAmong the exceptions are the Kupresak triplets of Mississauga, Ontario, Canada; their combined weight at birth in 2008, of 17 lbs, 2.7 ounces, set a world record.\n\nCerebral palsy is more common among multiple births than single births, being 2.3 per 1,000 survivors in singletons, 13 in twins, and 45 in triplets in North West England. This is likely a side effect of premature birth and low birth weight.\n\nMultiples may be monochorionic, sharing the same chorion, with resultant risk of twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome. Monochorionic multiples may even be monoamniotic, sharing the same amniotic sac, resulting in risk of umbilical cord compression and nuchal cord. In very rare cases, there may be conjoined twins, possibly impairing function of internal organs.\n\nMultiples are also known to have a higher mortality rate. It is more common for multiple births to be stillborn, while for singletons the risk is not as high. A literary review on multiple pregnancies shows a study done on one set each of septuplets and octuplets, two sets of sextuplets, 8 sets of quintuplets, 17 sets of quadruplets, and 228 sets of triplets. By doing this study, Hammond found that the mean gestational age (how many weeks when birthed) at birth was 33.4 weeks for triplets and 31 weeks for quadruplets. This shows that stillbirth happens usually 3–5 weeks before the woman reaches full term and also that for sextuplets or higher it almost always ends in death of the fetuses.\nThough multiples are at a greater risk of being stillborn, there is inconclusive evidence whether the actual mortality rate is higher in multiples than in singletons.\n\nToday many multiple pregnancies are the result of in vitro fertilisation (IVF). In a study in 1997 of 2,173 embryo transfers performed as part of in vitro fertilisation (IVF), 34% were successfully delivered pregnancies. The overall multiple pregnancy rate was 31.3% (24.7% twins, 5.8% triplets, and .08% quadruplets). Because IVFs are producing more multiples, a number of efforts are being made to reduce the risk of multiple births- specifically triplets or more. Medical practitioners are doing this by limiting the number of embryos per embryo transfer to one or two. That way, the risks for the mother and fetuses are decreased.\n\nThe appropriate number of embryos to be transferred depends on the age of the woman, whether it is the first, second or third full IVF cycle attempt and whether there are top-quality embryos available. According to a guideline from The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) in 2013, the number of embryos transferred in a cycle should be chosen as in following table:\n\nAlso, it is recommended to use single embryo transfer in all situations if a top-quality blastocyst is available.\n\nBed rest has not been found to change outcomes and therefore is not generally recommended outside of a research study.\n\nSelective reduction is the practice of reducing the number of fetuses in a multiple pregnancy; it is also called \"multifetal reduction\". \n\nThe procedure generally takes two days; the first day for testing in order to select which fetuses to kill, and the second day for the procedure itself, in which potassium chloride is injected into the heart of each selected fetus under the guidance of ultrasound imaging. Risks of the procedure include bleeding requiring transfusion, rupture of the uterus, retained placenta, infection, a miscarriage, and prelabor rupture of membranes. Each of these appears to be rare.\n\nSelective reduction was developed in the mid-1980s, as people in the field of assisted reproductive technology became aware of the risks that multiple pregnancies carried for the mother and for the fetuses.\n\nWomen with a multiple pregnancy are usually seen more regularly by midwives or doctors than those with singleton pregnancies because of the higher risks of complications. However, there is currently no evidence to suggest that specialised antenatal services produce better outcomes for mother or babies than ‘normal’ antenatal care.\n\nAs preterm birth is such a risk for women with multiple pregnancies, it has been suggested that these women should be encouraged to follow a high-calorie diet to increase the birth weights of the babies. Evidence around this subject is not yet good enough to advise women to do this because the long term effects of the high-calorie diets on the mother are not known.\n\nA study in 2013 involving 106 participating centers in 25 countries came to the conclusion that, in a twin pregnancy of a gestational age between 32 weeks 0 days and 38 weeks 6 days, and the first twin is in cephalic presentation, planned Cesarean section does not significantly decrease or increase the risk of fetal or neonatal death or serious neonatal disability, as compared with planned vaginal delivery. In this study, 44% of the women planned for vaginal delivery still ended up having Cesarean section for unplanned reasons such as pregnancy complications. In comparison, it has been estimated that 75% of twin pregnancies in the United States were delivered by Cesarean section in 2008. Also in comparison, the rate of Cesarean section for all pregnancies in the general population varies between 40% and 14%.\n\nFetal position (the way the babies are lying in the womb) usually determines if they are delivered by caesarean section or vaginally. A review of good quality research on this subject found that if the twin that will be born first (i.e. is lowest in the womb) is head down there is no good evidence that caesarean section will be safer than a vaginal birth for the mother or babies.\n\nMonoamniotic twins (twins that form after the splitting of a fertilised egg and share the same amniotic fluid sac) are at more risk of complications than twins that have their own sacs. There is also insufficient evidence around whether to deliver the babies early by caesarean section or to wait for labour to start naturally while running checks on the babies’ wellbeing. The birth of this type of twins should therefore be decided with the mother and her family and should take into account the need for good neonatal care services.\n\nCesarean delivery is needed when first twin is in non cephalic presentation or when it is a monoamniotic twin pregnancy.\n\nMultiple-birth infants are usually admitted to neonatal intensive care immediately after being born. The records for all the triplet pregnancies managed and delivered from 1992-1996 were looked over to see what the neonatal statistics were. Kaufman found from reviewing these files that during a five-year period, 55 triplet pregnancies, which is 165 babies, were delivered. Of the 165 babies 149 were admitted to neonatal intensive care after the delivery.\n\nA study by the U.S. Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality found that, in 2011, pregnant women covered by private insurance in the United States were older and more likely to have multiple gestation than women covered by Medicaid.\n\nCertain cultures consider multiple births a portent of either good or evil.\n\nMayan culture saw twins as a blessing, and was fascinated by the idea of two bodies looking alike. The Mayans used to believe that twins were one soul that had fragmented.\n\nIn Ancient Rome, the legend of the twin brothers who founded the city (Romulus and Remus) made the birth of twin boys a blessing, while twin girls were seen as an unlucky burden, since both would have to be provided with an expensive dowry at about the same time.\n\nIn Greek mythology, fraternal twins Castor and Polydeuces, and Heracles and Iphicles, are sons of two different fathers. One of the twins (Polydeuces, Heracles) is the illegitimate son of the god Zeus; his brother is the son of their mother's mortal husband. A similar pair of twin sisters are Helen (of Troy) and Clytemnestra (who are also sisters of Castor and Polydeuces). The theme occurs in other mythologies as well, and is called \"superfecundation\".\n\nIn certain medieval European chivalric romances, such as Marie de France's \"Le Fresne\", a woman cites a multiple birth (often to a lower-class woman) as proof of adultery on her part; while this may reflect a widespread belief, it is invariably treated as malicious slander, to be justly punished by the accuser having a multiple birth of her own, and the events of the romance are triggered by her attempt to hide one or more of the children. A similar effect occurs in the Knight of the Swan romance, in the Beatrix variants of the Swan-Children; her taunt is punished by giving birth to seven children at once, and her wicked mother-in-law returns her taunt before exposing the children.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "5506241", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5506241", "title": "Nazi eugenics", "text": "Nazi eugenics\n\nNazi eugenics (, \"National Socialist racial hygiene\") were Nazi Germany's racially based social policies that placed the biological improvement of the Aryan race or Germanic \"Übermenschen\" master race through eugenics at the center of Nazi ideology. In Germany, eugenics were mostly known under the synonymous term racial hygiene. Following the Second World War, both terms effectively vanished and were replaced by \"Humangenetik\" (human genetics).\n\nEugenics research in Germany before and during the Nazi period was similar to that in the United States (particularly California), by which it had been partly inspired. However, its prominence rose sharply under Adolf Hitler's leadership when wealthy Nazi supporters started heavily investing in it. The programs were subsequently shaped to complement Nazi racial policies.\n\nThose humans targeted for destruction under Nazi eugenics policies were largely living in private and state-operated institutions, identified as \"life unworthy of life\" (), including prisoners, \"degenerates\", dissidents, people with congenital cognitive and physical disabilities (including people who were \"feebleminded\", epileptic, schizophrenic, manic-depressive, cerebral palsy, muscular dystrophy, deaf, blind) (), homosexual, idle, insane, and the weak, for elimination from the chain of heredity. More than 400,000 people were sterilized against their will, while more than 70,000 were killed under Action T4, a euthanasia program. In June 1935, Hitler and his cabinet made a list of seven new decrees, number 5 was to speed up the investigations of sterilization.\n\nThe early German eugenics movement was led by Wilhelm Schallmayer and Alfred Ploetz. Henry Friedlander wrote that although the German and American eugenics movements were similar, the German movement was more centralized and did not contain as many diverse ideas as the American movement. Unlike the American movement, one publication and one society, the German Society for Racial Hygiene, represented all eugenicists.\n\nEdwin Black wrote that after the eugenics movement was well established in the United States, it was spread to Germany. California eugenicists began producing literature promoting eugenics and sterilization and sending it overseas to German scientists and medical professionals. By 1933, California had subjected more people to forceful sterilization than all other U.S. states combined. The forced sterilization program engineered by the Nazis was partly inspired by California's.\n\nIn 1927, the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Anthropology (KWIA), an organization which concentrated on physical and social anthropology as well as human genetics, was founded in Berlin with significant financial support from the American philanthropic group, the Rockefeller Foundation. German professor of medicine, anthropology and eugenics Eugen Fischer was the director of this organization, a man whose work helped provide the scientific basis for the Nazis' eugenics policies. The Rockefeller Foundation even funded some of the research conducted by Josef Mengele before he went to Auschwitz.\n\nUpon returning from Germany in 1934, where more than 5,000 people per month were being forcibly sterilized, the California eugenics leader C. M. Goethe bragged to a colleague:\n\nEugenics researcher Harry H. Laughlin often bragged that his Model Eugenic Sterilization laws had been implemented in the 1935 Nuremberg racial hygiene laws. In 1936, Laughlin was invited to an award ceremony at Heidelberg University in Germany (scheduled on the anniversary of Hitler's 1934 purge of Jews from the Heidelberg faculty), to receive an honorary doctorate for his work on the \"science of racial cleansing\". Due to financial limitations, Laughlin was unable to attend the ceremony and had to pick it up from the Rockefeller Institute. Afterwards, he proudly shared the award with his colleagues, remarking that he felt that it symbolized the \"common understanding of German and American scientists of the nature of eugenics.\"\n\nAdolf Hitler read about racial hygiene during his imprisonment in Landsberg Prison.\n\nHitler believed the nation had become weak, corrupted by dysgenics, the infusion of degenerate elements into its bloodstream.\n\nThe racialism and idea of competition, termed social Darwinism in 1944, were discussed by European scientists and also in the Vienna press during the 1920s. Where Hitler picked up the ideas is uncertain. The theory of evolution had been generally accepted in Germany at the time, but this sort of extremism was rare.\n\nIn his \"Second Book\", which was unpublished during the Nazi era, Hitler praised Sparta, (using ideas perhaps borrowed from Ernst Haeckel), adding that he considered Sparta to be the first \"Völkisch State\". He endorsed what he perceived to be an early eugenics treatment of deformed children:\n\nSparta must be regarded as the first Völkisch State. The exposure of the sick, weak, deformed children, in short, their destruction, was more decent and in truth a thousand times more humane than the wretched insanity of our day which preserves the most pathological subject, and indeed at any price, and yet takes the life of a hundred thousand healthy children in consequence of birth control or through abortions, in order subsequently to breed a race of degenerates burdened with illnesses.\n\nIn organizing their eugenics program the Nazis were inspired by the United States' programs of forced sterilization, especially on the eugenics laws that had been enacted in California.\n\nThe Law for the Prevention of Hereditarily Diseased Offspring, enacted on July 14, 1933, allowed the compulsory sterilisation of any citizen who according to the opinion of a \"Genetic Health Court\" suffered from a list of alleged genetic disorders and required physicians to register every case of hereditary illness known to them, except in women over 45 years of age. Physicians could be fined for failing to comply.\n\nIn 1934, the first year of the Law's operation, nearly 4,000 persons appealed against the decisions of sterilization authorities. A total of 3,559 of the appeals failed. By the end of the Nazi regime, over 200 Hereditary Health Courts () were created, and under their rulings over 400,000 persons were sterilized against their will.\n\nThe Hadamar Clinic was a mental hospital in the German town of Hadamar used by the Nazi-controlled German government as the site of Action T4. The Kaiser Wilhelm Institute of Anthropology, Human Heredity, and Eugenics was founded in 1927. Hartheim Euthanasia Centre was also part of the euthanasia programme where the Nazis killed individuals they deemed disabled. The first method used involved transporting patients by buses in which the engine exhaust gases were passed into the interior of the buses, and so killed the passengers. Gas chambers were developed later and used pure carbon monoxide gas to kill the patients.\nIn its early years, and during the Nazi era, the Clinic was strongly associated with theories of eugenics and racial hygiene advocated by its leading theorists Fritz Lenz and Eugen Fischer, and by its director Otmar von Verschuer. Under Fischer, the sterilization of so-called Rhineland Bastards was undertaken. Grafeneck Castle was one of Nazi Germany's killing centers, and today it is a memorial place dedicated to the victims of the Action T4.\n\nThe Law for Simplification of the Health System of July 1934 created Information Centers for Genetic and Racial Hygiene, as well as Health Offices. The law also described procedures for 'denunciation' and 'evaluation' of persons, who were then sent to a Genetic Health Court where sterilization was decided.\n\nInformation to determine who was considered 'genetically sick' was gathered from routine information supplied by people to doctor's offices and welfare departments. Standardized questionnaires had been designed by Nazi officials with the help of Dehomag (a subsidiary of IBM in the 1930s), so that the information could be encoded easily onto Hollerith punch cards for fast sorting and counting.\n\nIn Hamburg, doctors gave information into a Central Health Passport Archive (circa 1934), under something called the 'Health-Related Total Observation of Life'. This file was to contain reports from doctors, but also courts, insurance companies, sports clubs, the Hitler Youth, the military, the labor service, colleges, etc. Any institution that gave information would get information back in return. In 1940, the Reich Interior Ministry tried to impose a Hamburg-style system on the whole Reich.\n\nAfter the Nazis passed the Nuremberg Laws in 1935, it became compulsory for both marriage partners to be tested for hereditary diseases in order to preserve the perceived racial purity of the Aryan race. Everyone was encouraged to carefully evaluate his or her prospective marriage partner eugenically during courtship. Members of the SS were cautioned to carefully interview prospective marriage partners to make sure they had no family history of hereditary disease or insanity, but to do this carefully so as not to hurt the feelings of the prospective fiancee and, if it became necessary to reject her for eugenic reasons, to do it tactfully and not cause her any offense.\n\n\nNotes\nBibliography\n\n\n\n\nGeneral reference\n\nUnited States Holocaust Memorial Museum\n"}
{"id": "2681589", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2681589", "title": "Noogenesis", "text": "Noogenesis\n\nNoogenesis is the emergence and evolution of intelligence.\n\nNoo, nous (, ) – from the ancient Greek , has synonyms in other languages (Chinese), is a term that currently encompasses the semantics: mind, intelligence, intellect, reason; wisdom; insight, intuition, thought, - in a single phenomenon .\n\nNoogenesis was first mentioned in the posthumously published in 1955 book \"The Phenomenon of Man\" by Pierre Teilhard de Chardin, an anthropologist and philosopher, in a few places:\n\nThe lack of any kind of definition of the term has led to a variety of interpretations reflected in the book, including \"the contemporary period of evolution on Earth, signified by transformation of biosphere onto the sphere of intelligence—noosphere\", \"evolution run by human mind\" etc.\nThe most widespread interpretation is thought to be \"the emergence of mind, which follows geogenesis, biogenesis and anthropogenesis, forming a new sphere on Earth—noosphere\".\n\nIn 2005 Alexey Eryomin in the monograph Noogenesis and Theory of Intellect proposed a new concept of noogenesis in understanding the evolution of intellectual systems, concepts of intellectual systems, information logistics, information speed, intellectual energy, intellectual potential, consolidated into a theory of the intellect which combines the biophysical parameters of intellectual energy—the amount of information, its acceleration (frequency, speed) and the distance it's being sent—into a formula.\nAccording to the new concept—proposed hypothesis continue prognostic progressive evolution of the species \"Homo sapiens\", the analogy between the human brain with the enormous amount of neural cells firing at the same time and a similarly functioning human society.\nA new understanding of the term \"noogenesis\" as an evolution of the intellect was proposed by A. Eryomin. A hypothesis based on recapitulation theory links the evolution of the human brain to the development of human civilization. The parallel between the amount of people living on Earth and the amount of neurons becomes more and more obvious leading us to viewing global intelligence as an analogy for human brain.\nAll of the people living on this planet have undoubtedly inherited the amazing cultural treasures of the past, be it production, social and intellectual ones. We are genetically hardwired to be a sort of \"live RAM\" of the global intellectual system. Alexey Eryomin suggests that humanity is moving towards a unified self-contained informational and intellectual system. His research has shown the probability of Super Intellect realizing itself as Global Intelligence on Earth. We could get closer to understanding the most profound patterns and laws of the Universe if these kinds of research were given enough attention. Also, the resemblance between the individual human development and such of the whole human race has to be explored further if we are to face some of the threats of the future.\n\nTherefore, generalizing and summarizing: \nThe term \"noogenesis\" can be used in a variety of fields i.e. medicine, biophysics, semiotics, mathematics, information technology, psychology, theory of global evolution etc. thus making it a truly cross-disciplinary one. In astrobiology noogenesis concerns the origin of intelligent life and more specifically technological civilizations capable of communicating with humans and or traveling to Earth. The lack of evidence for the existence of such extraterrestrial life creates the Fermi paradox.\n\nThe emergence of the human mind is considered to be one of the five fundamental phenomenons of emergent evolution. \nTo understand the mind, it is necessary to determine how human thinking differs from other thinking beings. Such differences include the ability to generate calculations, to combine dissimilar concepts, to use mental symbols, and to think abstractly.\nThe knowledge of the phenomenon of intelligent systems—the emergence of reason (noogenesis) boils down to:\n\n\nSeveral published works which do not employ the term \"noogenesis\", however, address some patterns in the emergence and functioning of the human intelligence: working memory capacity ≥ 7, ability to predict, prognosis, hierarchical (6 layers neurons) system of information analysis, consciousness, memory, generated and consumed information properties etc. They also set the limits of several physiological aspects of human intelligence. Сonception of emergence of insight.\n\nHistorical evolutionary development and emergence of \"H. sapiens\" as species, include emergence of such concepts as anthropogenesis, phylogenesis, morphogenesis, cephalization, systemogenesis, cognition systems autonomy.\n\nOn the other hand, development of an individual's intellect deals with concepts of embryogenesis, ontogenesis, morphogenesis, neurogenesis, higher nervous function of I.P.Pavlov and his philosophy of mind.\nDespite the fact that the morphofunctional maturity is usually reached by the age of 13, the definitive functioning of the brain structures is not complete until about 16–17 years of age.\n\nThe fields of Bioinformatics, genetic engineering, noopharmacology, cognitive load, brain stimulations, the efficient use of altered states of consciousness, use of non-human cognition, information technology (IT), artificial intelligence (AI) are all believed to be effective methods of intelligence advancement and may be the future of intelligence on earth and the galaxy.\n\nThe development of the human brain, perception, cognition, memory and neuroplasticity are unsolved problems in neuroscience. Several megaprojects are being carried out in: American BRAIN Initiative, European Human Brain Project, China Brain Project, Blue Brain Project, Allen Brain Atlas, Human Connectome Project, Google Brain, - in attempt to better our understanding of the brain's functionality along with the intention to develop human cognitive performance in the future with artificial intelligence, informational, communication and cognitive technology.\n"}

A host of other bodies in the outer Solar System are inferred by a single type of observation or by theoretical modeling to have subsurface oceans. Europa is the first planned target of this program, and will be visited by the planned \"Europa Clipper\" orbiter mission.\n\nThe US House Appropriations Committee approved the bill in May 20, 2015 and directed NASA to create an Ocean Worlds Exploration Program. There is not yet a formal Ocean Worlds Program that NASA has assigned to a particular center, a \"Roadmaps to Ocean Worlds\" is in the process, and the formal program is still being established within the agency.\n\nThe chief author of NASA's budget proposal is John Culberson, the head of the science subcommittee in the House of Representatives. In Spring 2015 he presented a budget request, creating the possibility of an all-new NASA mission program. The House Appropriations Committee approved its version of the FY2016 House Appropriations Commerce-Justice-Science (CJS) bill on May 20, 2015. Therefore, the Committee directed NASA to create an Ocean Worlds Exploration Program whose primary goal is to discover extant life on another world using a mix of Discovery, New Frontiers and Flagship class missions consistent with the recommendations of current and future Planetary Science Decadal Surveys.\n\nIn the FY2017 Budget Request, the committee recommended $348 million for \"Outer Planets\" and \"Ocean Worlds,\" of which not less than $260 million is for the Europa orbiter and lander, with launch of the \"Europa Clipper\" orbiter in 2022 and the Europa Lander in 2024.\n\nA 2017 technical analysis stated that the technical challenges are enormous, and that \"Without a genuinely strategic program plan, the great promise of an OWEP [Ocean Worlds Exploration Program] is highly likely to remain unfulfilled.\" The report noted that development of OWEP-enabling technologies must currently compete for priority with other Solar System objectives, which is not useful for strategic planning. The report recommends common, multi-mission technical infrastructure and secure funding to develop it.\n\nOn Earth, itself an ocean world, liquid water is essential to life as we know it. A question is whether the dark, alien oceans of the outer Solar System could be habitable for simple life forms, and if so, what would their biochemistry be. Exploring these moons could help to answer the question of how life arose on Earth and whether it exists anywhere else in the Solar System. It may also be possible to find pre-biotic chemistry occurring, which could provide clues to how life started on Earth. Any life detected at the remote ocean worlds in the outer Solar System would likely have formed and evolved along an independent path from life on Earth, giving us a deeper understanding of the potential for life in the universe.\n\nOceanographers, biologists and astrobiologists are part of the team developing the strategy roadmap. The planning also considers implementing planetary protection measures to avoid contaminating extraterrestrial habitable environments with resilient stowaway bacteria on their landers.\n\nThe three best-documented water oceans beyond Earth are those within Europa, Enceladus and Titan. Of these, Europa's is closest to the surface —less than 10 km— and hence potentially best suited for eventual direct exploration. Enceladus' ocean is deeper —5 to 40 km below its surface— but fractures beneath the south pole of this moon allow ice and gas from the ocean to escape to space where it has been sampled by mass spectrometers aboard the \"Cassini\" Saturn orbiter. Titan's ocean is the deepest, at 50 to 100 km, and no evidence for plumes or ice volcanism exist on the surface. A host of other bodies in the outer Solar System are inferred by a single type of observation or by theoretical modeling to have subsurface oceans and these include: Ganymede, Dione, Pluto, Triton, and Ceres, as well as Callisto, and Mimas.\n\nAstrobiology mission concepts to water worlds in the outer Solar System:\n"}

During the later stages of the Second World War he served as a search and rescue dog in London. He attended the 1946 Civil Defence Stand–Down parade, where he was presented to the King and Queen, and Princess Elizabeth. His medal was auctioned in 2000 for £4,600 (US$6,964).\n\nPeter was born in 1941, and was purchased by Mrs Audrey Stables, of Gregory Avenue, Weoley Castle, for 25 shillings. He was noted by his owner as having dual talents; for destruction of his owner's home and for ignoring every command given. He was transferred into war service, serving with Air Ministry dog-handler Archie Knight at the Civil Defence depot in Chelsea. He was known as Rescue Dog No. 2664/9288 Peter.\n\nActive from early 1945 until the end of the Second World War, Peter acted as a search and rescue dog in London. Knight wrote of the dog in a report, \"I think one of his finest jobs was on Monday. We were called 20 hours after the incident and after several hours of heavy rain. Three bodies were missing and he very quickly indicated in a most unlikely spot, but he was right, and they uncovered a man and a woman. The next day we were called to another job. There were so many calls for Peter that I worked him 10 hours and he never once refused to give all he had. All his marks revealed casualties. I hated to work him like this – but I also hated to refuse the rescue parties who were asking for him.\" Peter's rescue efforts were not limited to saving people; on one occasion he indicated a trapped victim which turned out to be a grey parrot. On another occasion he saved six people in a single attack.\n\nIn 1946, Peter and his handler were present at the Civil Defence Stand–Down parade in Hyde Park, London. It was there that he was presented to King and Queen, and received a kiss on the nose from Princess Elizabeth, the future Elizabeth II.\n\nHe was later used to demonstrate mountain rescue techniques to other rescue dogs and handlers. He returned home to Mrs Stables, and moved to a PDSA animal sanctuary before he died. Peter was buried at the PDSA's Ilford Animal Cemetery on 20 November 1952, one of twelve recipients of the Dickin Medal to be buried there.\n\nPeter was awarded the Dickin Medal, considered to be the Victoria Cross for animals, in November 1945. His citation read, \"For locating victims trapped under blitzed buildings while serving with the MAP attached to Civil Defence of London.\" The ceremony was conducted at the Grosvenor House Hotel, where he was awarded the medal by Sir James Ross of the Air Ministry. The Dickin Medal is often referred to as the animal metaphorical equivalent of the Victoria Cross.\n\nHis Dickin Medal was auctioned by Spinks on 27 July 2000 for £4,600 (US$6,964). Peter's owner had died, and the medal was being sold by a private collector. At the same auction, the Dickin Medal awarded to the pigeon Tyke was also sold.\n\n\n"}

He also served as commander, Multi-National Corps – Iraq under General George W. Casey, Jr.. He was the Senior Military Assistant to the Secretary of Defense from March 2007 to August 2008. He retired from the U.S. Army on January 31, 2012 after nearly 40 years of service, and was succeeded as Vice Chief of Staff by Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III.\n\nChiarelli was born in Seattle, Washington on March 23, 1950. He is a Distinguished Military Graduate of Seattle University Army ROTC. Chiarelli was commissioned a second lieutenant in September 1972. Throughout his career, he has served in Army units in the United States, Germany, and Belgium. He has commanded at every level from platoon to corps.\n\nHis first assignments were with the 9th Infantry Division at Fort Lewis, including: support platoon leader for 3rd Squadron (Air), 5th Cavalry Regiment; squadron assistant intelligence staff officer (S-2); squadron intelligence staff officer (S-2); troop executive officer; and troop commander. \n\nChiarelli's principal staff assignments were Operations Officer (G-3), 1st Cavalry Division, at Fort Hood, Texas; Executive Assistant and, later, Executive Officer to the Supreme Allied Commander, Commander United States European Command at SHAPE Headquarters, Mons, Belgium; and the Director of Operations, Readiness, and Mobilization (G-3/5/7) at Headquarters, Department of the Army.\n\nHe commanded a mechanized infantry battalion and a mechanized infantry brigade at Fort Lewis, Washington; served as the assistant division commander for support in the 1st Cavalry Division at Fort Hood, Texas; served as commanding general, 1st Cavalry Division, and led it both in the Iraq War and during Operation Iraqi Freedom II; and served as commanding general of Multi-National Corps – Iraq.\n\nHe holds a Bachelor of Science degree in political science from Seattle University, a Master of Public Administration degree from the Daniel J.

He is also a graduate of the U.S. Naval Command and Staff College and the National War College.\n\nChiarelli has worked to reduce suicide rates in the Army. Out of concerns for stigma, he began using the term posttraumatic stress, dropping the word \"disorder\" from the medical name posttraumatic stress disorder. His term had subsequently become standard use in the armed forces, but was not taken up by the medical community. The name \"posttraumatic stress injury\" has been proposed by some psychiatrists in 2012, and is endorsed by Chiarelli.\n\nChiarelli is currently CEO of One Mind, which is dedicated to benefiting all affected by brain illness and injury through fostering fundamental changes – using open science principles and creating global public-private partnerships among governmental, corporate, scientific and philanthropic communities – that will radically accelerate the development and implementation of improved diagnostics, treatments and cures – while eliminating the stigma that comes with mental illness. \n\nThe Hero of Military Medicine Award was presented May 4, 2011, to Army Vice Chief of Staff Gen. Peter W. Chiarelli for his efforts to help Soldiers with traumatic brain injury and post-traumatic stress. The Henry M.

It affects about 5% of all women within a year after giving birth. The first phase is typically hyperthyroidism. Then, the thyroid either returns to normal or a woman develops hypothyroidism. Of those women who experience hypothyroidism associated with postpartum thyroiditis, one in five will develop permanent hypothyroidism requiring lifelong treatment.\n\nPostpartum thyroiditis is believed to result from the modifications to the immune system necessary in pregnancy, and histologically is a subacute lymphocytic thyroiditis. The process is normally self-limiting, but when conventional antibodies are found there is a high chance of this proceeding to permanent hypothyroidism. Postpartum thyroiditis is a member of the group of thyroiditis conditions known as resolving thyroiditis.\n\nThe initial phase of hyperthyroid symptoms occurs transiently about two to six months postpartum. Typical symptoms include irritability, nervousness, palpitations, and heat intolerance. Hormonal disturbances during this phase tend to occur with lower intensity compared with the hypothyroid phase. As a result, the hyperthyroid phase may pass undetected. The second phase of hypothyroid symptoms is also transient and can occur anytime within the three- to twelve-month period postpartum. Women in this phase experience low energy, poor memory, impaired concentration, carelessness, dry skin, cold intolerance, and general aches and pains. After one year postpartum, euthyroid function resumes. Any case with hypothyroid symptoms extending beyond one year postpartum is not considered postpartum thyroiditis.\n\nWomen who test positive for thyroid antibodies may be at increased risk of developing symptoms associated with postpartum depression than women without thyroid antibodies.\n\nDuring pregnancy, immunologic suppression occurs which induces tolerance to the presence of the fetus. Without this suppression, the fetus would be rejected causing miscarriage. As a result, following delivery, the immune system rebounds causing levels of thyroids antibodies to rise in susceptible women.\n\nSpecifically, the immunohistological features of susceptible women are indicated by:\n\n\nThis condition is commonly undiagnosed by physicians due to either unfamiliarity with the disease, the subtlety of symptoms, or the attribution of the symptoms to the stresses of having a newborn. Usual screening begins with assessing the thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) level. A suppressed TSH could represent the hyperthyroid phase, but warrants further testing to investigate for possible Graves' disease. A normal TSH with persistent symptoms could represent the shift between phases and requires repeat testing 4–6 weeks later; an elevated TSH at this time could indicate the hypothyroid phase.\n\nFor most women, the hyperthyroid phase presents with very mild symptoms or is asypmtomatic; intervention is usually not required. If symptomatic cases require treatment, a short course of beta-blockers would be effective.\n\nAssessing treatment for the hypothyroid is more complex. Women with symptoms or a very high TSH level, or both, are usually prescribed a course of levothyroxine. Asymptomatic women with slightly elevated TSH levels who are planning subsequent pregnancies, should consider a course of treatment until completion of the family to avoid possible developmental complications in future children. Otherwise, treatment could be discontinued after 1 year postpartum.\n\nOn average, 5-7% of pregnant women from most iodine-replete populations develop this condition.\n\nWomen with type I diabetes mellitus have a threefold increase in the prevalence of postpartum thyroiditis than non-diabetic women in the same region.\n"}

As a result, he spoke both Spanish and English fluently. From the age of 6, he modeled and performed in commercials. Renato was the brother of Swedish singer Denise Lopez., Sebastian \"DjZeb\" López, Samantha López, Arturo Everitt (photographer in Los Angeles) and Tiana Del Castillo. He had been in a seven-year relationship with Alexandra Ivanisevic, a fashion blogger and Swedish transplant to Mexico City.\n\nHe was a guitarist for the rock band The Prom Kings and previously hosted music shows on Mun2, such as \"El show\" and \"Vivo\". \nLópez had an homonymous TV show on Telehit which started on March 14, 2011. After leaving Telehit, in August 2012, he joined E! Entertainment to host the show \"Zona Trendy\".\n\nIn 2012, he appeared in the Mexican film \"El Cielo En Tu Mirada\".\n\nHe wrote songs for Mexican pop stars such as \"Si pudiera\" for Paty Cantú and \"Fuego con fuego\" for Gloria Trevi. He also starred in Trevi's music video \"Vestida de azúcar\" and had a small music production company in Los Angeles and a music studio in Mexico City.\n\nHe was hosting the TV shows \"E! Latin News\" on E! Latinoamérica, and \"MxDiseña\" on Canal Sony México, at the time of his death. In 2016, he costarred in Juanes' video \"Fuego\" as well as the Mexican film \"Macho\", which was playing in Mexican cinemas at the time of his death.\n\nThe day before the bodies of López and his publicist (Omar Girón Juárez) were found, they had driven to the affluent suburban area of Zona Esmeralda, Atizapán in the northwestern part of Greater Mexico City and an area that is teeming with regional drug cartels. A man named Carlos Morales had invited them to either a casting or a meeting about a PR campaign, and arranged to pick them up and drive them to another location where the casting or meeting was supposedly to take place. Morales is now identified as a suspect in the investigation. Around 5:30 P.M., Girón emailed Morales, stating that the area looked lonely and dangerous. That was the last anyone heard from Girón or López.\nLópez's and Girón's bodies were found with gunshot wounds, inside a car, in Santa María Mazatla, a rural village in the Jilotzingo municipality, about 15 km west of Zona Esmeralda.\n\nAuthorities have concluded that the assassins were targeting López specifically, as there was no evidence of robbery, nor kidnapping and López was shot 13 times; and believe the assassins may be members of drug gangs from the area. The local police reported a shootout in the area the previous night; however, the authorities do not have a definitive conclusion as to what happened.\n\nOn December 10, 2016, newspapers reported that the State of Mexico prosecutor stated that the assassination motive may have been an \"emotional revenge\", related to an as-yet unknown woman.\n\nCelebrities such as LP, Juanes, Gloria Trevi, Bárbara Mori, Miguel Rodarte, Aislinn Derbez, Manolo Cardona, Aracely Arámbula and Dulce María lamented López's death on social media. Some friends of López tattooed the word \"Taco\" on the ring finger of their right hands in his memory, as he had such a tattoo, referring to his love for the Mexican food dish. It is now an acronym for \"Todo Amor Cero Odio.\", denouncing the hate and violence that took his life.\n\n"}

The ossuary is estimated to contain the skeletons of between 40,000 and 70,000 people, whose bones have, in many cases, been artistically arranged to form decorations and furnishings for the chapel. The ossuary is among the most visited tourist attractions of the Czech Republic - attracting over 200,000 visitors annually.\nFour enormous bell-shaped mounds occupy the corners of the chapel. An enormous chandelier of bones, which contains at least one of every bone in the human body, hangs from the center of the nave with garlands of skulls draping the vault. Other works include piers and monstrances flanking the altar, a coat of arms of the House of Schwarzenberg, and the signature of Rint, also executed in bone, on the wall near the entrance.\n\nIn 1278, Henry, the abbot of the Cistercian monastery in Sedlec, was sent to the Holy Land by King Otakar II of Bohemia. He returned with a small amount of earth he had removed from Golgotha and sprinkled it over the abbey cemetery. The word of this pious act soon spread and the cemetery in Sedlec became a desirable burial site throughout Central Europe.\n\nIn the mid 14th century, during the Black Death, and after the Hussite Wars in the early 15th century, many thousands were buried in the abbey cemetery, so it had to be greatly enlarged.\n\nAround 1400, a Gothic church was built in the center of the cemetery with a vaulted upper level and a lower chapel to be used as an ossuary for the mass graves unearthed during construction, or simply slated for demolition to make room for new burials.\n\nAfter 1511, the task of exhuming skeletons and stacking their bones in the chapel was given to a half-blind monk of the order.\n\nBetween 1703 and 1710, a new entrance was constructed to support the front wall, which was leaning outward, and the upper chapel was rebuilt. This work, in the Czech Baroque style, was designed by Jan Santini Aichel.\n\nIn 1870, František Rint, a woodcarver, was employed by the Schwarzenberg family to put the bone heaps into order, yielding a macabre result. The signature of Rint, also executed in bone, appears on the wall near the entrance to the chapel.\n\nIn 1970, the centenary of Rint's contributions, Czech filmmaker Jan Švankmajer was commissioned to document the ossuary. The result was a 10-minute-long frantic-cut film of skeletal images overdubbed with an actual tour-guide's neutral voice narration. This version was initially banned by the Czech Communist authorities for alleged subversion, and the soundtrack was replaced by a brief spoken introduction and a jazz arrangement by Zdeněk Liška of the poem \"Comment dessiner le portrait d'un oiseau\" (\"How to Draw the Portrait of a Bird\") by Jacques Prévert. Since the Velvet Revolution, the original tour guide soundtrack has been made available.\n\nIn the documentary \"Long Way Round\", Ewan McGregor and Charley Boorman stop to see this church. Dan Cruickshank also views the church in his \"Adventures in Architecture\".\n\nThe ossuary is a major plot device in the John Connolly novel \"The Black Angel\".\n\nThe ossuary is used as a location for the \"Dungeons & Dragons\" movie and the movie \"Blood & Chocolate\".\n\nThe ossuary was also featured in \"Ripley's Believe it or Not\" and is described by Cara Seymour in the final scene of the film \"Adaptation.\"\n\nThe ossuary was also the influence for Dr. Satan's lair in the Rob Zombie film \"House of 1000 Corpses\". \n\n\n"}

The use of the term is politically charged and may not reflect any unique elements of any particular crime given that label.\n\nThe term expresses the perceived senselessness of the occurred acts of violence; the perpetrator and the victim do not know each other, the violence seems not to be motivated by greed or other common factors. The violence occurs suddenly and often under the influence of alcohol.\n\nThe term \"senseless violence\", in the meaning used in this article, was first used in 1997 by Cees Bangma, district chief of the Dutch police unit Midden-Friesland. Before 1997 the term did not carry the same moral connotation in Belgian and Dutch culture, and typically referred to overseas warzone violence. Bangma used it in a letter written to the Leeuwarder Courant, a Frisian newspaper in which he made an appeal to the Dutch population to have a minute of silence for Meindert Tjoelker, who was killed on 13 September 1997. This minute was necessary \"to make it clear to everyone that the Frisian society does not accept senseless violence\". A wave of reactions followed, which also included media hype. As a consequence, much more attention was spent to every similar case of violence, which led to the perception that violence was on the increase.\n\nA political group \"Landelijke Stichting Tegen Zinloos Geweld\" (national foundation against senseless violence) was created and people created the lady bug tile as a memorial or reminder against senseless violence. The group send guest teachers to schools and sport associations, but became rather inactive since ca. 2009.\n\nThe term is often criticized. Some people think that violence is never legitimate and consider the term to be a tautology. Others say that the term has never been clearly defined and does not help to understand a peticular phenomenon. Others point out that the term is or can be misused by politicians who strive for more repressive measures against crimes.\n\nIn 2016, the national newspaper NRC reported about a recent case of youngsters mistreating a homeless person. The newspaper quoted a spokesperson of the police who said that hardly any violence happens \"out of the blue\". Criminologists have started to use the term \"uitgaansgeweld\" instead, violence occurring \"going out\" in the evening to pubs and bars. Because of the local approach there are no recent national figures about the phenomenon, according to an expert.\n\nWhile there have been multiple isolated cases of fatal senseless violence in the decade since 1997, the number of deadly incidents surged since April in 2006. The following is a non-exhaustive list of deadly incidents since 1998:\n\n\n\n"}

Golosov.\n\nIn January 1968, the 15th Submarine Squadron was part of the 29th Ballistic Missile Division at Rybachiy, commanded by Admiral Viktor A. Dygalo. \"K-129\"s commander was Captain First Rank V.I. Kobzar. \"K-129\" carried hull number 722 on her final deployment during which she sank on 8 March 1968. It was one of four mysterious submarine disappearances in 1968; the others being the Israeli submarine , the and the U.S. submarine . The Soviet Navy deployed a huge flotilla of ships to search for her but never found her wreck.\n\nThe United States attempted to recover the boat in 1974 in a secret Cold War-era effort named Project Azorian. The vessel's position below the surface was the greatest depth from which an attempt had been made to raise a ship. The cover story used was that the salvage vessel was engaged in commercial manganese nodule mining. Only part of the submarine was recovered.\n\"K-129\", having completed two 70-day ballistic-missile combat patrols in 1967, was tasked with her third patrol in February 1968, with an expected completion date of 5 May 1968. Upon departure on 24 February, \"K-129\" reached deep water, conducted its test dive, returned to the surface to report by radio that all was well, and proceeded on patrol. No further communication was received from \"K-129\", despite normal radio check-ins expected when the submarine crossed the 180th meridian, and when it arrived at its patrol area.\n\nBy mid-March, Soviet naval authorities in Kamchatka became concerned that \"K-129\" had missed two consecutive radio check-ins. First, \"K-129\" was instructed by normal fleet broadcast to break radio silence and contact headquarters; later and more urgent communications all went unanswered. Soviet naval headquarters declared \"K-129\" \"missing\" by the third week of March and organized an air, surface, and sub-surface search-and-rescue effort in the North Pacific from Kamchatka and Vladivostok.\n\nThis Soviet deployment in the Pacific was analysed by U.S. intelligence as probably in reaction to a submarine loss. U.S. SOSUS Naval Facilities (NAVFACs) in the North Pacific were alerted and requested to review recent acoustic records to identify any possible associated signal. Several SOSUS arrays recorded a possibly related event on 8 March 1968, and upon examination produced sufficient triangulation by lines-of-bearing to provide the U.S. Navy with a locus for the probable wreck site. One source characterized the acoustic signal as \"an isolated, single sound of an explosion or implosion, 'a good-sized bang'.\" The acoustic event was reported to have originated near 40 N, 180th longitude.\n\nSoviet search efforts, lacking the equivalent of the U.S. SOSUS system, were unable to locate \"K-129\", and eventually Soviet naval activity in the North Pacific returned to normal. \"K-129\" was subsequently declared lost with all hands.\n\nAmerican intelligence resources, with the aid of SOSUS triangulation, would later locate the \"K-129\" wreck, photograph it \"in situ\" at its depth, and partially salvage it several years later.\n\nThe wreck of \"K-129\" was identified by northwest of Oahu at an approximate depth of on 20 August 1968. \nIt was surveyed in detail over the next three weeks by \"Halibut\" – reportedly with over 20,000 close-up photos – and later also possibly by the bathyscaphe . Given a unique opportunity to recover a Soviet SS-N-5 Serb nuclear missile without the knowledge of the Soviet Union, the \"K-129\" wreck came to the attention of U.S. national authorities. President Nixon authorized a salvage attempt after consideration by the Secretary of Defense and the White House. To ensure the salvage attempt remained \"black\" (\"i.e.\" clandestine and secret) the CIA, rather than the Navy, was tasked to conduct the operation. \"Hughes Glomar Explorer\" was designed and built under CIA contract solely for the purpose of conducting a clandestine salvage of \"K-129\". The salvage operation, named Project Azorian, would be one of the most expensive and deepest secrets of the Cold War.\n\nSeymour Hersh of \"The New York Times\" uncovered some of the details of Project Azorian in 1974, but was kept from publication by the action of the Director of Central Intelligence, William Colby. Months after the salvage operation was completed, in February 1975, the \"Los Angeles Times\" ran a brief story regarding the CIA operation, which led \"The New York Times\" to release Hersh's story. Jack Anderson continued the story on national television in March 1975. The media called the operation Project Jennifer, which in 2010 was revealed to be incorrect, since Jennifer referred only to a security system which compartmentalised Azorian project data.\n\n\"Hughes Glomar Explorer\" was publicly believed to be mining manganese nodules on the sea floor. Once the real purpose of Azorian was leaked to the media, however, the Soviet Union eventually found out about what happened. According to one account, in July–August 1974 \"Hughes Glomar Explorer\" grappled with and was able to lift the forward half of the wreck of \"K-129\", but as it was raised the claw suffered a critical failure resulting in the forward section breaking into two pieces with the all-important sail area and centre section falling back to the ocean floor. Thus the centre sail area and the after portions of \"K-129\" were allegedly not recovered. What exactly was retrieved in the section that was recovered is classified Secret Noforn or Top Secret, but the Soviets assumed that the United States recovered torpedoes with nuclear warheads, operations manuals, code books and coding machines. Another source (unofficial) states that the U.S. recovered the bow area, which contained two nuclear torpedoes, but no cryptographic equipment nor code books.\n\nThe United States announced that in the section they recovered were the bodies of six men. Due to radioactive contamination, the bodies were buried at sea in a steel chamber in September 1974, with full military honors about southwest of Hawaii. The videotape of that ceremony was given to Russia by U.S. Director of Central Intelligence Robert Gates when he visited Moscow in October 1992. The relatives of the crew members were eventually shown the video some years later.\n\nThe \"K-129\" recovery has been stated to have been a failure, recovering only a small amount of insignificant parts of the submarine. The CIA argued in a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit, however, that the project had to be kept secret because any \"official acknowledgment of involvement by U.S. Government agencies would disclose the nature and purpose of the program.\" This response has entered the lexicon of legal jargon as \"the Glomar response\" or \"Glomarization\"; \"neither confirm nor deny\".\n\nAs of 2018 the files, photographs, videotapes and other documentary evidence remain closed to the public. A few pictures appeared in a 2010 documentary showing the \"K-129\" wreck: the bow and the sail, with the missile compartment heavily damaged showing only one missile tube left attached to the structure.\n\nThe location of the wreck remains an official secret of the United States intelligence services. However, Dr. John P. Craven points to a location nearly 40 degrees North, and almost exactly on the 180th meridian. CIA documents reveal that it sank \"1,560 miles northwest of Hawaii,\" and that \"Hughes Glomar Explorer\" had to travel 3,008 miles from Long Beach, California, to reach the recovery site. The International Atomic Energy Agency states that two nuclear warheads from \"K-129\" were located in the Pacific 1,230 miles from Kamchatka at coordinates 40°6'N and 179°57'E at a depth of , and lists them as recovered. All three distances point to a location of , which is close to north of the Midway Atoll. The CIA gives for its approximate depth.\n\nThe official Soviet Navy hypothesis is that \"K-129\", while operating in snorkel mode, slipped below its operating depth. Such an event, combined with a mechanical failure or improper crew reaction, can cause flooding sufficient to sink the boat.\n\nThis account, however, has not been accepted by many, and four alternative theories have been advanced to explain the loss of \"K-129\":\n\n\nReportedly, as many as 40 of the complement of 98 were new to the submarine for this deployment.\n\n\"K-129\" was approximately midway through standard shore leave/replenishment and repair when a new mission was tasked.\n\nLead–acid batteries vent explosive hydrogen gas while charging. The hydrogen gas, if not properly vented, could have accumulated into an explosive concentration.\n\nDr. John P. Craven, former chief scientist of the U.S. Navy's Special Projects Office and former head of the DSSP and DSRV programs, commented:\n\nI have never seen or heard of a submarine disaster that was not accompanied by the notion that the battery blew up and started it all. [...] Naive investigators, examining the damage in salvaged battery compartments, invariably blame the sinking on battery explosions until they learn that any fully charged battery suddenly exposed to seawater will explode. It is an inevitable effect of a sinking and almost never a cause.\n\nAt least one American submarine, , on the other hand, was lost off Norway in 1949 due to a hydrogen explosion in the battery compartment. Most of \"Cochino's\" crew was rescued and the cause of her sinking is therefore known.\n\nIt was standard practice during the Cold War for U.S. Navy attack submarines to trail Soviet missile submarines as they departed their home ports and moved into the North Pacific or the North Atlantic Ocean.\n\nThe collision hypothesis is the unofficial opinion of many Soviet Navy officers, and is officially denied by the U.S. Navy. According to U.S. Navy sources, put into Yokosuka, Japan on 17 March 1968, shortly after the disappearance of \"K-129\", and received emergency repairs to a bent periscope, reportedly caused by ice impacted during surfacing while conducting classified operations in the Sea of Japan.\n\nThe seizure by the North Korean government occurred in the Sea of Japan on 23 January 1968, and the U.S. Navy response to this incident included the deployment and maintenance of naval assets in the area off the eastern North Korean coast for some time thereafter.\n\nIn response to Russian efforts to ascertain whether \"K-129\" had been lost due to damage resulting from a collision with a U.S. submarine, an official U.S. statement by Ambassador Malcolm Toon to a Russian delegation during a meeting in the Kremlin in August 1993 related:\n\nA news release in 2000 demonstrates that Russian suspicion and sensitivity concerning the collision possibility, and indeed their preference for such an explanation, remains active:\n\nA picture of \"Swordfish\" on 17 March 1968 at its berth in Japan published in a Japanese newspaper showed only a bent periscope and a dented sail. A collision sufficient to breach the pressure hull of another submarine would have significantly damaged the sail.\n\nAn unconfirmed report states that \"K-129\" was trailed from its home port Petropavlovsk by , which had been stationed off Petropavlovsk for an intelligence-gathering mission. USS \"Barb\", according to the report, had orders to attack \"K-129\" if the Russian submarine was preparing for a missile launch. The report further states that USS \"Barb\" witnessed the sinking of \"K-129\" but was not involved in it.\n\nOn 3 October 1986 the Soviet ballistic missile submarine , while on combat patrol in the Atlantic, suffered the explosion of a liquid-fuelled SS-N-6 missile in one of its 16 missile tubes. The cause of the explosion was a leaking missile tube hatch seal. The leak allowed sea water to come into contact with residue of the missile's propellants, which caused a spontaneous fire resulting in an explosion first of the missile booster, then a subsequent explosion of the warhead detonator charge. In the case of the Yankee-class ballistic missile submarine, the missiles were located within the pressure hull and the explosion did not cause damage sufficient to immediately sink the boat. It did, however, cause extensive radioactive contamination throughout, requiring the submarine to surface and the evacuation of the crew to the weather deck, and later to a rescue vessel which had responded to the emergency. Subsequently, \"K-219\" sank into the Hatteras Abyss with the loss of four crewmen and rests at a depth of about . The Soviet Navy later claimed that the leak was caused by a collision with .\n\nThere are indicators suggesting \"K-129\" suffered a similar explosion in 1968. First, the radioactive contamination of the recovered bow section and the six crewmen of \"K-129\" by weapons grade plutonium indicates the explosion of the warhead detonator charge of one of the missiles, \"before\" the ship reached its crush depth. The report that the forward section was crushed and that charring in the bow section indicated dieseling from an implosion (or alternatively from a fire), would indicate that the explosion occurred while \"K-129\" was submerged and at depth. The report found in that the wreck revealed \"K-129\" with a hole immediately abaft the conning tower would support the theory of an explosion of one of the three missiles in the sail (possibly missile #3). Since \"K-129\"s missiles were housed in the sail, much less structural mass (compared to the Yankee-class) was available to contain such an explosion, and loss of depth control of the submarine would be instantaneous.\n\nAccording to Dr. John P. Craven, \"K-129\" crossed the International Date Line at latitude 40 north, which was far south of her expected position:\n\nWhen K-129 passed longitude 180, it should have been farther north, at a latitude of 45 degrees, or more than three hundred miles away. If that was a navigational mistake it would be an error of historic proportions. Thus if the sub were not somewhere in the vicinity of where the Soviets supposed it to be, there would be a high probability, if not a certainty, that the submarine was a rogue, off on its own, in grave disobedience of its orders.\n\nCraven does not explain why he eliminated the possibilities that \"K-129\" was proceeding to a newly assigned and officially approved patrol area, or using a new track to an established patrol area, nor why he concluded that \"K-129\" was acting in an abnormal or criminal manner for a Soviet strategic missile submarine.\n\nCraven also noted:\n\nCraven does not reconcile a sinking location at 40°N latitude with an oil slick hundreds of miles south of that latitude, nor does he reconcile the date and time of the sinking with the date and time of the recovery of radioactive oil by the oceanographic research ship.\n\nAnatoliy Shtyrov (Анатолий Штыров), a former Deputy Chief of the Soviet Pacific Fleet intelligence, states that \"K-129\", whose normal patrol area was off the west coast of the United States, was sent on an unscheduled combat patrol in the eastern Pacific only 1.5 months after returning from its previous patrol. Vladimir Evdasin (Владимир Евдасин), who from June 1960 to March 1961 served aboard \"K-129\", states that \"K-129\" was sent on a secret mission in response to the massive U.S. naval force build-up off the Korean coast after the Pueblo incident. \"K-129\"s mission was in support of North Korea, which was an ally of the Soviet Union, and directed against U.S. naval operations, Pacific bases and U.S. maritime support lines to South-east Asia.\n\nRussian President Boris Yeltsin posthumously awarded the Order of Valor to 98 sailors who died aboard \"K-129\". Some have pointed to this level of manning as anomalous, because the normal complement of a diesel-electric Golf-class Russian submarine was about 83. Boosting total submarine complement by almost 20% might tax the logistical capabilities of the submarine (reducing patrol duration), and could potentially hamper the operations of the boat. No explanation for this level of submarine manning has been provided by the Russian Navy.\n\n\"Red Star Rogue\" by Kenneth Sewell makes the claim that Project Azorian recovered virtually all of \"K-129\" from the ocean floor, and in fact \"Despite an elaborate cover-up and the eventual claim the project had been a failure, most of \"K-129\" and the remains of the crew were, in fact, raised from the bottom of the Pacific and brought into the \"Glomar Explorer\"\".\n\nIn August 1993, Ambassador Malcolm Toon presented to a Russian delegation \"K-129\"s ship's bell. According to \"Red Star Rogue\", this bell had been permanently attached to the middle of the conning tower of \"K-129\", thus indicating that in addition to the bow of the submarine, the critical and valuable midsection of the submarine was at least partially recovered by Project Azorian. Additionally, Ambassador Toon is quoted from the 6th Plenum of the U.S.–Russia Joint Commission on POW/MIAs as stating, \"Our director of naval intelligence has concluded that no U.S. sub was within 300 nautical miles of your sub when it sank\". \"Red Star Rogue\" places K-129 at 24deg north latitude by 163 west longitude, less than 350 miles from Honolulu. This site is consistent with the discovery of radioactive oil reported to the Hawaii Institute of Geophysical Research at the time.\n\nThe premise of \"Red Star Rogue\" is that a fail-safe device designed to be activated in the event of an unauthorised fire command of its nuclear missiles caused 2 catastrophic explosions (monitored by U.S. technology at the time) resulting in sinking the submarine. The 11 extra crewmen have never been satisfactorily identified, and K-129's crew manifest was listed as missing by Russian authorities. An ID photograph of a sailor found in the wreck has never been identified. \"Red Star Rogue\" claims the changing relations with China and Russia in the early 1970s, forged by Nixon and Kissinger, were enabled by the K-129 incident.\n\nCraven suggests that Project Azorian's real goal was not the nuclear weapons or the coding systems at all; rather, the project sought to determine exactly what \"K-129\" was doing at 40N/180W \"where she did not belong\". Such information could be (and supposedly was) utilized within Henry Kissinger's foreign policy of \"Deterrence Through Uncertainty\", in order to \"raise an unanswerable question in Leonid Brezhnev's mind about his command and control of his armed forces\".\n\nRetired United States Navy Captain Peter Huchthausen, former naval attaché in Moscow, had a brief conversation in 1987 with Soviet admirals concerning \"K-129\". Huchthausen states that Admiral Peter Navojtsev told him, \"Captain, you are very young and inexperienced, but you will learn that there were some matters that both nations have agreed to not discuss, and one of these is the reasons we lost K-129.\"\n\nIn 1995, when Huchthausen began work on a book about the Soviet underwater fleet, he interviewed Admiral Victor Dygalo, who stated that the true history of \"K-129\" has not been revealed because of the informal agreement between the two countries' senior naval commands. The purpose of that secrecy, he alleged, is to stop any further research into the losses of USS \"Scorpion\" and \"K-129\". Huchthausen states that Dygalo told him to \"overlook this matter, and hope that the time will come when the truth will be told to the families of the victims.\"\n\nIn October 1992, Robert Gates, as the Director of Central Intelligence, visited Moscow to meet with President Boris Yeltsin of Russia. He said: \n\nGates's decision to bring the videotape of the funeral held for the men on the Golf was ultimately motivated by the fact that the United States wanted to inspire Russia to offer up information on missing American servicemen in Vietnam. Before that, \"We had never confirmed anything to the Russians except in various vague senses,\" he said in an interview. \n\nA subsequent FOIA search to find if any POWs were released as a result of this visit produced only negative results. According to Peter Huchthausen: \n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "37289928", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37289928", "title": "Worker policing", "text": "Worker policing\n\nWorker policing is a behavior seen in colonies of social hymenopterans (ants, bees, and wasps) whereby worker females eat or remove eggs that have been laid by other workers rather than those laid by a queen. Worker policing ensures that the offspring of the queen will predominate in the group. In certain species of bees, ants and wasps, workers or the queen may also act aggressively towards fertile workers. Worker policing has been suggested as a form of coercion to promote the evolution of altruistic behavior in eusocial insect societies.\n\nProposed mechanisms for the recognition of worker-laid eggs or active reproductive workers include marker hydrocarbons on the surface of queen-laid eggs, cuticle hydrocarbons on reproductive workers, and recognition of nest-mates. In rare cases, worker-laid eggs carry mimicked queen hydrocarbons and escape policing, a condition known as the anarchic syndrome.\n\nNot all forms of policing require the presence of a queen; it also occurs in a few species of ants which establish a dominance hierarchy of reproductive female workers, where top-ranking individuals reproduce.\n\nIn many social insect communities, sex is determined through haplodiploidy. Haploid male drones develop from unfertilized eggs while diploid females develop from fertilized eggs. Queens of a colony may mate with one or several drones. On average, a queen shares half of her genes with her sons, but only shares a quarter of her genes with the sons of fertile female workers. Therefore, it is in the queen's best interests to have her own sons raised, and not the sons of workers. Workers can reproduce in many ants, bees, and wasps because male offspring come from unfertilized eggs.\n\nBy contrast, the worker shares half of her genes with her sons and only a quarter with her brothers. Furthermore, the workers in colonies with a single once-mated queen are related to their nephews by three eighths, higher than they are related to brothers. This results in a conflict where the queen and worker females are at odds over the proportion of male offspring they contribute, since each side tries to maximize its reproductive fitness. Queens favor production of their own sons while workers favor production of their own sons, and do not stop their sisters from laying because of the favorable relatedness to nephews.\n\nWorker policing occurs when worker bees in the colony are genetically more closely related to the queen than the reproductive female. In many instances, the eggs of the female worker are eaten, or she is repeatedly attacked by other workers. This mechanism of egg removal ensures that the queen's sons predominate.\n\nExperiments confirming the role of kin selection in worker policing demonstrate the effects of multiple matings, which can lead to lower average relatedness between workers. Queens of the social wasp \"Dolichovespula saxonica\" mate singly or multiply. Researchers who study these wasps have observed a strong positive correlation between worker relatedness and male production. After controlling for the absolute number of eggs laid, these scientists conclude that the queen's multiple matings favor mutual worker policing.\n\nAlthough early theories of worker policing focused on the kin selection component, evidence from honey bees suggests that altruism is sometimes enforced. Fewer workers reproduce as policing effectiveness rises, and policing effectiveness decreases with increasing relatedness except in colonies with no queen. This suggests that worker policing is a social sanction imposed on selfish individuals.\n\nMechanisms suggested for egg discrimination in worker policing include queen hydrocarbons, fertile worker hydrocarbons, and nestmate recognition.\n\nA study on the carpenter ant \"Camponotus floridanus\" found a special surface hydrocarbon on queen-laid eggs. Workers in the colony with the queen's eggs refrained from egg-laying, whereas other groups that did not have queen-laid eggs showed worker reproduction. Thus, the hydrocarbon could act as a signal to alert workers to halt reproduction. More generally, however, the authors concluded that the hydrocarbons were a fertility signal. It is still unknown as to how the decision to restrain reproduction occurs or what minimum threshold of fertility in the queen is needed to reduce worker reproduction.\n\nThe study of cuticle hydrocarbons has also been applied to the reproductive workers. In some colonies of the ponerine ant \"Platythyrea punctata\", the presence of CHCs in new reproductive workers triggered aggressive behavior from the rest of the colony, often between new and old reproductive workers. Specifically, the old reproductive workers rubbed a marker hydrocarbon on the antennae of the new females, identifying them as rivals and targets for aggression.\n\nIn contrast to the other ant species, worker policing in the ant \"Formica fusca\" appears to incorporate nestmate recognition in addition to the queen hydrocarbons. Workers displayed higher levels of aggression toward non-nest mates and also removed some queen-laid eggs. Thus, queen hydrocarbons were not the only contributor to discrimination of the eggs.\n\nWorker policing has evolved convergently in several social insect species. The following cases are examples:\n\nOne of the first examples of worker policing to be discovered was in the honey bee, \"Apis mellifera\". Worker policing is prevalent in most honey bee colonies, and worker reproduction is minimal (0.12%) in this species. Worker policing occurs via egg-eating (oophagy) in \"Apis mellifera\" colonies. In many of these hives, the activation of ovaries in fertile females is diminished, suggesting that there are disincentives to laying eggs.\n\nWorkers in colonies of the Asian honey bee, \"Apis florea\", are also reported to engage in oophagy. Using microsatellite analysis, researchers concluded that no mature drones had non-queen alleles in the colonies they investigated. Thus, even though workers had activated ovaries and were capable of laying eggs, worker policing ensured the functional sterility of otherwise fertile workers.\nA higher percentage of female workers of the bee species \"Apis cerana\" are reported to activate their ovaries than those of \"Apis mellifera\" or \"Apis florea\". When queens were removed, up to 40% of the workers activated their ovaries in subsequent days. However, policing workers continued to eat the worker-laid eggs, suggesting that the mechanism of policing in this species does not involve direct intervention from the queen.\n\nThe observation that all these Apis species engage in polyandry has led researchers to conclude that worker policing is plesiomorphic for the Apis genus.\n\nWorker policing also occurs in the primitively eusocial bumblebees such as \"Bombus terrestris\".\n\nIn colonies of the ponerine ant, \"Pachycondyla inversa,\" workers eat the eggs of fertile female workers, known as gamergates, and display aggressive behavior towards egg-laying females.\n\nIn colonies of the ant \"Gnamptogenys menadensis\", workers will sometimes mate and lay eggs while others remain as virgins to lay trophic eggs to be used as food. In a display of policing, workers can immobilize female reproductive workers by biting their limbs; it is reported that 50% of the victims die from this treatment. The attacking workers may also drag offending workers outside the colony. Since workers can lay both male and female eggs, worker policing could be favored as the cost to the community is large. \nThe ant species \"Aphaenogaster smythiesi japonica\" also display evidence of policing. When researchers separated and then reunited workers from colonies that did or did not have queens, workers from the queen-containing colonies attacked the workers with activated ovaries from the queenless colonies.\n\nIn the queenless ant \"Streblognathus peetersi\", policing helps to select gamergates. The workers immobilize gamergates with lowered fertility, enabling high-ranking workers to take over as new gamergates.\n\nIn the ponerine ant \"Harpegnathos saltator\", worker policing prevents the number of reproductive workers from becoming excessive. The species has gamergates, which lay eggs but rarely carry out any other tasks, so having too many of them would reduce the colony's efficiency. Gamergate numbers are rather stable, as infertile workers target newly ovipositing workers by jumping on and holding them: this efficiently inhibits them from laying eggs, and within a few weeks they revert to being subordinate and infertile workers. However, once new ovipositing workers attain a gamergate's level of ovarian activity, the infertile (policing) workers ignore them. The signal used by the policing workers consists of cuticle hydrocarbons transmitted only by direct contact, rather than being a pheromone detected by olfaction. Similarly, the inhibition of ovipositing workers is achieved by direct physical aggression by policing workers, not by any pheromone produced by queens or gamergates.\n\nThe tree wasp \"Dolichovespula sylvestris\" also displays worker policing. Both egg-eating and aggression are reported in these wasp communities, and the queen also engages in the policing process. Similar behavior has been observed in the closely related species \"Dolichovespula media\".\n\nIn colonies of the paper wasp, \"Polistes chinensis antennalis\", workers can lay up to a quarter of the male eggs in the colony. The number of eggs that survived to hatching, however, was minimal compared to the number produced by the queen. Analysis of the microsatellite markers showed that both queens and workers contributed to policing of worker and queen-laid eggs even in monogynous and monandrous colonies.\n\nThe common wasp, \"Vespula vulgaris\", engages in worker policing, and it is known that a significant number of workers have active ovaries. However, studies by researchers have suggested that relatedness may not be the key factor in the development of worker policing. Rather, it is hypothesized that worker policing has been selected due to conflict suppression in the colony.\n\nIn a test of worker policing, researchers examined the removal of worker-laid eggs in \"Vespula rufa\", a wasp that has low paternity. Under the testing conditions, worker policing was not as efficient, and some of the drones appeared to be from worker-laid eggs.\n\nThe European Hornet, \"Vespa crabro\", was previously thought to be under reproductive pheromone control by the queen, thus explaining why the other females didn't reproduce, even though they were capable of doing so. Experiments by Foster showed that the workers were instead regulating sterility in each other, thus instead exhibiting worker policing. While each worker is capable of reproducing, the colony as a whole is more efficient and organized if the workers allow only the queen to lay larvae.\n\n\"Synoeca cyanea\" also engage in worker policing during times when queen repopulation is not needed. They will prevent females from laying eggs through aggressive behavior and egg-eating.\n\nVery rarely, female worker bees lay eggs that escape worker policing, in a process known as the anarchic syndrome. Female reproductive workers in these colonies activate their ovaries even in the presence of a queen. The worker eggs are allowed as they mimic queen hydrocarbons. Thus, female workers can maximize their reproductive fitness at the expense of the colony. Anarchic syndrome is an example of selection working in opposite directions at individual and group levels.\n\n\"Temnothorax unifasciatus\", a myrmicinid ant, has been shown not to have collective worker policing. However, when a queen is removed, a rank order for reproduction appears, where top ranking reproductives display aggression towards lower-order female workers. Thus, reductions in egg laying are created by dominance hierarchies. Individuals do not act in benefit of the colony, instead opting to increase their own fitness by laying their eggs and reducing the contributions of opponents.\n\nThis type of policy is common in Dolichovespula norwegica wasps where despite being more related to other workers’ sons, worker-laid eggs were consumed by other workers.\n\nIn the thelytokous ant \"Platythyrea punctata\", colonies are clonal; therefore, workers are all equally related genetically, and worker policing is not expected as there is no genetic conflict. However, one would expect severe effects on the condition of the colony if reproductive workers were left unchecked. For example, more time spent on individual reproduction would be predicted to detract from care of the queen's offspring. In studies of these ants, workers did actually display worker policing, as evidenced by increased aggression towards reproductive workers. Worker policing here is favored for group efficiency.\n\n"}
