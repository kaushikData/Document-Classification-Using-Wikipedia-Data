The apartment was rented to Cornelius Gurlitt, the son of celebrated art historian, dealer, and war profiteer, Hildebrand Gurlitt, and grandson of the art historian Cornelius Gurlitt. Some of the paintings were immediately suspected of having been looted by the Nazis during the Second World War. The collection is largely undamaged and of remarkable quality. It contains Old Masters as well as Impressionist, Cubist, and Expressionist paintings by artists including Claude Monet, Pierre-Auguste Renoir, Henri Matisse, Franz Marc, Marc Chagall, Otto Dix, and Max Liebermann, among many others. Although German authorities seized the entire collection, Gurlitt was not detained. Not until 3 November 2013 did the magazine \"Focus\" report the find. News of the discovery was reported worldwide.\n\nGurlitt initially refused to cooperate with investigators. He retained several dozen additional suspect paintings, kept not in Munich but in his home in Salzburg, Austria. In April 2014, an agreement was reached whereby the collection confiscated in Munich was to be returned to Gurlitt in exchange for his co-operation with a government-led task force charged with returning stolen pieces to the rightful owners. However, Gurlitt died on 6 May 2014. His will bequeathed all his property to the Museum of Fine Arts Bern, Switzerland, after all legitimate claims of ownership against it had been evaluated.\n\nIn 1930 art collector Hildebrand Gurlitt was removed as director of the museum in Zwickau because he exhibited contemporary artists. After the Nazis came to power, he was stripped of his new job as director of Kunstverein Hamburg, because his grandmother was a Jew. He moved the family to Dresden and built a prosperous business as an art dealer, specializing in modern art.\n\nHildebrand was appointed as a dealer for the Führermuseum in Linz, Austria. On instructions from Reich Minister of Propaganda Joseph Goebbels, Hermann Göring personally appointed a Commission for the Exploitation of Degenerate Art. The Commission in turn appointed a series of dealers approved by the official Nazi confiscation service, the ERR, to handle the marketing of these art assets. Four men who had been dealing in modern art for years were chosen: Karl Buchholz, Ferdinand Möller, Bernhard A. Böhmer and Hildebrand Gurlitt. They were instructed to sell these artworks abroad for foreign currency. Hildebrand's extensive network of European and North American art contacts were invaluable in this. Göring used the funds raised to grow his personal art collection, though the four men did not always report to the Commission all proceeds of their sales. Among the works of so-called \"degenerate art\" that the Commission sold off were many paintings stolen from noted French art dealer Paul Rosenberg.\n\nIn May 1940 the Reich Propaganda Ministry sold to Gurlitt 200 paintings, including Chagall's \"The Walk\", Picasso's \"Farming Family\", and Nolde's \"Hamburg Harbour,\" for the small sum of 4,000 Swiss francs. Hildebrand similarly acquired 115 additional works of \"degenerate art\" in 1941. It is estimated that, at his height, he had a personal trading collection of more than 1500 art objects.\n\nGurlitt used his position to sell art to domestic collectors, most notably to Bernhard Sprengel, whose collection forms the core of the Sprengel Museum in Hannover.\n\nCaptured with his wife and twenty boxes of art in Aschbach (Schlüsselfeld) in June 1945, Gurlitt claimed that the art was part of his personal collection, and that most of his collection and all of his records had been destroyed during the bombing of Dresden in February 1945. He painted himself as a victim of Nazi persecution due to his Jewish heritage, and on those grounds he was released.\n\nAlthough suspicious of his story, in December 1950 US investigators returned 206 items to Gurlitt, including Max Liebermann's \"Two Riders on the Beach\", Otto Dix's self-portrait, an allegorical painting by Marc Chagall. Gurlitt continued trading artworks until his death in 1956.\n\nCornelius Gurlitt (28 December 1932 – 6 May 2014) was a German art collector, son of Hildebrand Gurlitt. He grew up in the Dammtor district of Hamburg with his sister Renate, who was born there in 1935. His great-grandmother was Jewish, which caused his father to be labelled as a \"quarter-Jew\" under the Nazi race laws in the \"Volkszählung vom 17. Mai 1939\", or so-called \"German Minority Census\" of 1939.\n\nIn 2010 German customs officers detained Cornelius Gurlitt entering Germany from Switzerland carrying €9,000 (£7,500; $13,000) in cash, which he explained as the proceeds of a transaction with the Galerie Kornfeld in Bern. Gurlitt was allowed to go on his way, but he had aroused suspicions. Further investigation by the prosecutor's office, the federal police and the tax authorities uncovered a number of anomalies. Investigators discovered that Gurlitt had never been employed, had no obvious source of income, was not registered with the or with the tax authorities or social services, had never married, and had no pension or health insurance.\n\nIn late February 2012, the authorities searched his apartment, finding more than a thousand paintings valued at as much as €1 billion.\nThe magazine \"Focus\" stated that at least 200 pieces were believed to have been lost during the Nazi era.\nThe paintings recovered included works by Ernst Barlach, Max Beckmann, Canaletto, Marc Chagall, , Gustave Courbet, Honoré Daumier, Eugène Delacroix, Otto Dix, Albrecht Dürer, , Conrad Felixmüller, Bonaventura Genelli, Ludwig Godenschweg, Otto Griebel, Ernst Ludwig Kirchner, Paul Klee, , Oskar Kokoschka, Wilhelm Lachnit, Max Liebermann, August Macke, Franz Marc, , Henri Matisse, Claude Monet, Edvard Munch, Emil Nolde, Pablo Picasso, Pierre-Auguste Renoir, Auguste Rodin, Théodore Rousseau, Karl Schmidt-Rottluff, Carl Spitzweg, Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, and Christoph Voll.\n\nOn 5 November 2013, Reinhard Nemetz, the head of the prosecutors' office in Augsburg, said that 121 framed and 1,258 unframed works had been seized from the apartment of Cornelius Gurlitt in early March 2012, including unregistered works by Chagall, Dix, Liebermann, and Matisse. The art historian who first examined the collection, Meike Hoffmann, claimed in print in 2010 that \"not a single one\" of these works was ever acquired by Hildebrand Gurlitt. Dr. Meike Hoffmann wishes to remark that this controversy derives from a misreading of her book on Bernhard A. Böhmer. In her book, the art historical term ‘Bildwerke’ is used. The term refers only to sculptures, which indeed Hildebrand Gurlitt did not take from the ‘Degenerate Art’ Confiscation. Of course, Meike Hoffmann has never questioned the fact that Hildebrandt Gurlitt dealt with other kinds of artworks from the ‘Degenerate Art’ Confiscation. She stated to \"Focus\" that as many as 300 pieces had appeared in the 1937 Nazi Degenerate Art Exhibition in Munich. At the time of the interview with \"Focus\", she was trying to trace the original owners of the works and their surviving relatives. Art historians asked that a complete list of the paintings be published in order that they be returned to their rightful owners.\n\nSpeaking to \"Der Spiegel\" magazine in November 2013, Cornelius insisted that his father had obtained the works legally and stated that he would not voluntarily return any of them to previous owners. Feeling threatened by the intense media attention, Gurlitt's brother-in-law offered 22 works in his possession to the police for safekeeping. In November 2013, \"Der Spiegel\" revealed that they had received a letter from Gurlitt telling them that \"the name Gurlitt may not appear in your magazine.\" Gurlitt then told two reporters from the \"Paris Match\", who confronted him in a Munich supermarket, that \"Applause from the wrong side is the worst thing there is.\" \"Der Spiegel\" found this comment \"puzzling.\"\n\n\"Portrait of a woman\" by Henri Matisse was directly traceable to the collection of Paul Rosenberg, a Jewish art dealer from Paris who had represented Matisse and Picasso and who had been forced to leave his collection behind when he fled France. When approached by \"Focus\", Rosenberg's granddaughter, French television presenter Anne Sinclair, who had been fighting for decades for the return of the art dealer's paintings, stated that she knew nothing of the existence of the painting. Recovery efforts for \"Portrait of a woman\" were immediately undertaken on behalf of the Rosenberg heirs by Christopher A. Marinello, who entered into negotiations with Cornelius Gurlitt, his legal representatives and the German state. \"Portrait of a woman\" was in fact returned to Paul Rosenberg's heirs on 15 May 2015. Other paintings that Gurlitt had already sold have yet to be recovered, such as an oil on canvas of Aline Charigot done by Pierre-Auguste Renoir in 1881. It is believed the work was sold to a collector in Florida in 2002.\n\nOne of the last pieces that Cornelius Gurlitt sold was \"The Lion Tamer\" by Max Beckmann. After a settlement, initiated by the Lempertz auction house in Cologne, was reached between Gurlitt and the heirs of Alfred Flechtheim, it was auctioned off for nearly £750,000. Another work was reportedly sold in 1990 through the Bern-based gallery of Eberhard Kornfeld.\n\nIn March 2014, a BBC reporter was granted access to one of the locations where 238 of the seized works were stored. He viewed works such as Monet's \"Waterloo Bridge\" (1903) and others by Picasso, Cezanne, Liebermann, Renoir, Courbet, and Manet.\n\nOn 7 April 2014, a month before Gurlitt's death, an agreement was reached whereby the seized artwork was to be returned to Gurlitt in exchange for his co-operation with the government-led task force charged with determining which of the pieces was stolen and returning them to the rightful heirs.\n\nAn entity called the Schwabinger Kunstfund or Gurlitt Task Force was created to research the provenance of the paintings in the Gurlitt trove. However, after several years of operations under the direction of Ingeborg Berggreen-Merkel it was widely criticized for having few results and little visibility.\n\nBerggreen-Merkel was accused of visiting the severely ill Gurlitt at his hospital bed and persuading him to sign over the ownership of his collection, allegedly as the only way to prevent Gurlitt from getting sued from various interest groups, Jewish or other. In early 2014 Gurlitt designated the Kunstmuseum as his sole heir. A few weeks earlier, Berggreen-Merkel had met with the President of the Museum's Foundation Council, Christoph Schäublin. One year later, her taskforce was dissolved. \"We are disappointed,\" said Ronald Lauder, president of the World Jewish Congress.\n\nCornelius Gurlitt died on 6 May 2014. In his will, written on his deathbed, Gurlitt named the Museum of Fine Arts Bern in Switzerland as his sole heir. People close to Gurlitt told an American newspaper that he decided to give the collection to a foreign institution because he felt that Germany had treated him and his father badly. The legacy included the paintings Gurlitt had kept in Salzburg, paintings which German authorities had not confiscated because their remit did not extend to property held in Austria. Gurlitt's decision created further controversy over the appropriateness of the museum accepting this bequest. The will stipulated that the museum would be required to research the provenance of the paintings and make restitution as appropriate. The museum decided to accept those works which are not legally the property of previous Nazi-era owners, or their heirs, and has entered into a joint-agreement with German and Swiss authorities about the handling of this bequest.\n\nGurlitt's family (cousins) also entered the discussion, raising questions about the legality of the will, based on his state of mind at the time. Gurlitt's cousin, Uta Werner, filed a claim of inheritance on the artwork. Werner's lawyer, Wolfgang Seybold, argued that Gurlitt's relatives were the rightful heirs. Seybold supported his argument with the opinion of psychiatrist and lawyer Helmut Hausner, who stated that Gurlitt suffered from schizoid personality disorder, delusions, and dementia when he wrote the will bequeathing his collection to the museum. It is possible that a number of artworks will be returned to Gurlitt's estate, as he would have been considered the rightful owner unless the heirs of previous owners could prove that he obtained them through unlawful means. German authorities estimate that around 590 pieces need further investigation to determine whether they were confiscated under the Nazi regime, and a further 380 have been definitively identified as confiscated by the Nazis as \"degenerate art\".\n\nArt objects continued to surface after Gurlitt's death. In July 2014, a new discovery was made in his Munich apartment: two sculptures, possibly the work of Rodin and Degas. In September, a landscape by Claude Monet was discovered in a suitcase Gurlitt had left in a hospital where he stayed.\n\nGerman newspapers questioned the prosecutor's right to seize the collection. Property rights in cases of works of art acquired during the Nazi period are highly complex. After the war the Nazi law legalizing possession of stolen works of \"degenerate art\" was deliberately upheld by the Allied Control Council in order that the trade in artworks could continue.\n\nUnlike in Austria, there is no law in effect in Germany requiring the return of Nazi-looted art, as long as the items in question can be proven to have been, at any point in time, legally acquired. As signatories of the 1998 Washington Agreement, Germany agreed that all of its public institutions would check their inventories for Nazi-looted goods and return them if found. However, this is on a strictly voluntary basis and, 15 years later, very few museums and libraries have done so. Individuals are under no legal requirement whatsoever to return Nazi-looted art. A failure on the part of the German government to return the rightful possessions of Cornelius Gurlitt might have been a violation of his property rights as guaranteed in the German constitution.\n\nOn 4 December 2013, prominent German art historian Sibylle Ehringhaus, who was one of the first experts to view the artworks in the spring of 2012, gave an interview in the newspaper \"Augsburger Allgemeine\", demanding the immediate return of the complete collection to Gurlitt. However, she had looked at the works very briefly and had not researched their provenance because, as she stated in the interview, \"Cornelius Gurlitt commissioned neither myself nor anyone else\" to perform such research. Chief Prosecutor Reinhard Nemetz vehemently denied her appeal, yet apparently failed to cite any concrete legal grounds for the seizure.\n\nOn 20 November 2014, the German jurist Jutta Limbach, the head of the Limbach Commission on Nazi-looted art, confirmed the opinion of the German \"Süddeutsche Zeitung\" newspaper that the Bavarian \"State Prosecutor used an incorrect application of the tax liability law to seize\" the artworks of Cornelius Gurlitt.\n\nSome of the artworks have been returned to the heirs of the legitimate owners, notably a portrait by Matisse restored to the heirs of French art dealer Paul Rosenberg. Another major painting from the collection, \"Two Riders on the Beach\" (1901), by Max Liebermann, was returned to the heirs of the German-Jewish industrialist and art collector David Friedmann, and sold at auction in June 2015. \"Two Riders on the Beach\" was auctioned at Sotheby's on 24 June 2015 in London.\n\nOn 24 November 2014, the Museum of Fine Arts in Bern agreed to accept the Gurlitt estate. Museum officials stated that no art looted by the Nazis would be permitted to enter the museum's collection. Some 500 works were to remain in Germany until their rightful owners could be identified. Three pieces were singled out for immediate return: Henri Matisse's \"Femme Assise\" to the descendants of the Jewish art dealer Paul Rosenberg, Max Liebermann's \"Two Riders on the Beach\" to the great-nephew of the industrialist and art collector David Friedmann, and Carl Spitzweg's \"Playing the Piano\" to the heirs of music publisher Henri Hinrichsen, who was murdered at Auschwitz.\n\nThe first public display of the Gurlitt art trove took place at an exhibition curated by the Bern Fine Art Museum, running from November 2017 to March 2018, which featured 160 works from the controversial Gurlitt art collection.\n\nGerman authorities announced that they will list all 590 suspect pieces in the \"Lost Art Internet Database\". only 464 objects are listed. Descriptions of some of the artworks found have been made public since their discovery, which include:\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "142224", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=142224", "title": "A.I. Artificial Intelligence", "text": "A.I. Artificial Intelligence\n\nA.I. Artificial Intelligence, also known as A.I., is a 2001 American science fiction drama film co-written, co-produced, and directed by Steven Spielberg, co-written by Ian Watson, and based on the 1969 short story \"Supertoys Last All Summer Long\" by Brian Aldiss. It was co-produced by Kathleen Kennedy and Bonnie Curtis, and stars Haley Joel Osment, Jude Law, Frances O'Connor, Brendan Gleeson, and William Hurt. Set in a futuristic post-climate change society, \"A.I.\" tells the story of David (Osment), a childlike android uniquely programmed with the ability to love.\n\nDevelopment of \"A.I.\" originally began with producer-director Stanley Kubrick, after he acquired the rights to Aldiss' story in the early 1970s. Kubrick hired a series of writers until the mid-1990s, including Brian Aldiss, Bob Shaw, Ian Watson, and Sara Maitland. The film languished in protracted development for years, partly because Kubrick felt computer-generated imagery was not advanced enough to create the David character, whom he believed no child actor would convincingly portray. In 1995, Kubrick handed \"A.I.\" to Spielberg, but the film did not gain momentum until Kubrick's death in 1999. Spielberg remained close to Watson's film treatment for the screenplay.\n\n\"A.I. Artificial Intelligence\" divided critics, with the overall balance being positive, and grossed approximately $235 million. It was nominated for two Academy Awards at the 74th Academy Awards for Best Visual Effects and Best Original Score (by John Williams). In a 2016 BBC poll of 177 critics around the world, the film was voted the eighty-third greatest film since 2000.\n\nIn the late 22nd century, rising sea levels from global warming have wiped out coastal cities such as Amsterdam, Venice, and New York and drastically reduced the world's population. A new type of robots called Mecha, advanced humanoids capable of thought and emotion, have been created.\n\nDavid, a Mecha that resembles a human child and is programmed to display love for his owners, is given to Henry Swinton and his wife Monica, whose son Martin, after contracting a rare disease, has been placed in suspended animation and not expected to recover. Monica feels uneasy with David, but eventually warms to him and activates his imprinting protocol, causing him to have an enduring childlike love for her. David is befriended by Teddy, a robotic teddy bear that belonged to Martin.\n\nMartin is cured of his disease and brought home. As he recovers, he grows jealous of David. He tricks David into entering the parents's bedroom at night and cutting off a lock of Monica's hair. This upsets the parents, particularly Henry, who fears David intended to injure them.\n\nAt a pool party, one of Martin's friends pokes David with a knife, activating David's self-protection programming. David grabs Martin and they fall into the pool. Martin is saved from drowning, but Henry persuades Monica to return David to his creators for destruction. Instead, she abandons David and Teddy in the forest. She warns David to avoid all humans, and tells him to find other unregistered Mecha who can protect him.\n\nDavid is captured for an anti-Mecha \"Flesh Fair\", where obsolete, unlicensed Mecha are destroyed before cheering crowds. David is placed on a platform with Gigolo Joe, a male prostitute Mecha who is on the run after being framed for murder. Before the pair can be destroyed with acid, the crowd, thinking David is a real boy, begins booing and throwing things at the show's emcee. In the chaos, David and Joe escape. They set out to find the Blue Fairy, whom David remembers from \"The Adventures of Pinocchio\", and who David believes can turn him into a real boy, allowing Monica to love him and take him home.\n\nJoe and David make their way to the decadent resort town of Rouge City, where \"Dr. Know\", a holographic answer engine, directs them to the top of Rockefeller Center in the flooded ruins of Manhattan. There, David meets a copy of himself and destroys it. He then meets Professor Hobby, his creator, who tells David that he was built in the image of the professor's dead son David. David finds more copies of him, as well as female versions called Darlene, that have been made there.\n\nDisheartened, David lets himself fall from a ledge of the building. He is rescued by Joe, flying an amphibicopter he has stolen from the police who were pursuing him. David tells Joe he saw the Blue Fairy underwater, and wants to go down to meet her. Joe is captured by the authorities, who snare him with an electromagnet. David and Teddy use the amphibicopter to dive down to see the Fairy, which turns out to be a statue at the now-sunken Coney Island. The two become trapped when the Wonder Wheel falls on their vehicle. David repeatedly asks the Fairy to turn him into a real boy. Eventually the ocean freezes and David's power source is depleted.\n\nTwo thousand years later, humans are extinct, and Manhattan is buried under glacial ice. The Mecha have evolved into an advanced silicon-based form called Specialists. They find David and Teddy, and discover they are original Mecha who knew living humans, making them special.\n\nThe Specialists revive David and Teddy. David walks to the frozen Fairy statue, which collapses when he touches it. The Mecha use David's memories to reconstruct the Swinton home. David asks the Specialists if they can make him human, but they cannot. However, he insists they recreate Monica from DNA from the lock of her hair, which Teddy has kept. The Mecha warn David that the clone can live for only a day, and that the process cannot be repeated. David spends the next day with Monica and Teddy. Before she drifts off to sleep, Monica tells David she has always loved him. Teddy climbs onto the bed and watches the two lie peacefully together.\n\n\nKubrick began development on an adaptation of \"Super-Toys Last All Summer Long\" in the late 1970s, hiring the story's author, Brian Aldiss, to write a film treatment. In 1985, Kubrick asked Steven Spielberg to direct the film, with Kubrick producing. Warner Bros. agreed to co-finance \"A.I.\" and cover distribution duties. The film labored in development hell, and Aldiss was fired by Kubrick over creative differences in 1989. Bob Shaw briefly served as writer, leaving after six weeks due to Kubrick's demanding work schedule, and Ian Watson was hired as the new writer in March 1990. Aldiss later remarked, \"Not only did the bastard fire me, he hired my enemy [Watson] instead.\" Kubrick handed Watson \"The Adventures of Pinocchio\" for inspiration, calling \"A.I.\" \"a picaresque robot version of \"Pinocchio\"\".\n\nThree weeks later, Watson gave Kubrick his first story treatment, and concluded his work on \"A.I.\" in May 1991 with another treatment of 90 pages. Gigolo Joe was originally conceived as a G.I. Mecha, but Watson suggested changing him to a male prostitute. Kubrick joked, \"I guess we lost the kiddie market.\" Meanwhile, Kubrick dropped \"A.I.\" to work on a film adaptation of \"Wartime Lies\", feeling computer animation was not advanced enough to create the David character. However, after the release of Spielberg's \"Jurassic Park\", with its innovative computer-generated imagery, it was announced in November 1993 that production of \"A.I.\" would begin in 1994. Dennis Muren and Ned Gorman, who worked on \"Jurassic Park\", became visual effects supervisors, but Kubrick was displeased with their previsualization, and with the expense of hiring Industrial Light & Magic.\n\nIn early 1994, the film was in pre-production with Christopher \"Fangorn\" Baker as concept artist, and Sara Maitland assisting on the story, which gave it \"a feminist fairy-tale focus\". Maitland said that Kubrick never referred to the film as \"A.I.\", but as \"Pinocchio\". Chris Cunningham became the new visual effects supervisor. Some of his unproduced work for \"A.I.\" can be seen on the DVD, \"The Work of Director Chris Cunningham\". Aside from considering computer animation, Kubrick also had Joseph Mazzello do a screen test for the lead role. Cunningham helped assemble a series of \"little robot-type humans\" for the David character. \"We tried to construct a little boy with a movable rubber face to see whether we could make it look appealing,\" producer Jan Harlan reflected. \"But it was a total failure, it looked awful.\" Hans Moravec was brought in as a technical consultant.\nMeanwhile, Kubrick and Harlan thought \"A.I.\" would be closer to Steven Spielberg's sensibilities as director. Kubrick handed the position to Spielberg in 1995, but Spielberg chose to direct other projects, and convinced Kubrick to remain as director. The film was put on hold due to Kubrick's commitment to \"Eyes Wide Shut\" (1999). After the filmmaker's death in March 1999, Harlan and Christiane Kubrick approached Spielberg to take over the director's position. By November 1999, Spielberg was writing the screenplay based on Watson's 90-page story treatment. It was his first solo screenplay credit since \"Close Encounters of the Third Kind\" (1977). Spielberg remained close to Watson's treatment, but removed various sex scenes with Gigolo Joe. Pre-production was briefly halted during February 2000, because Spielberg pondered directing other projects, which were \"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone\", \"Minority Report\" and \"Memoirs of a Geisha\". The following month Spielberg announced that \"A.I.\" would be his next project, with \"Minority Report\" as a follow-up. When he decided to fast track \"A.I.\", Spielberg brought Chris Baker back as concept artist.\n\nThe original start date was July 10, 2000, but filming was delayed until August. Aside from a couple of weeks shooting on location in Oxbow Regional Park in Oregon, \"A.I.\" was shot entirely using sound stages at Warner Bros. Studios and the Spruce Goose Dome in Long Beach, California.\nThe Swinton house was constructed on Stage 16, while Stage 20 was used for Rouge City and other sets. Spielberg copied Kubrick's obsessively secretive approach to filmmaking by refusing to give the complete script to cast and crew, banning press from the set, and making actors sign confidentiality agreements. Social robotics expert Cynthia Breazeal served as technical consultant during production. Haley Joel Osment and Jude Law applied prosthetic makeup daily in an attempt to look shinier and robotic. Costume designer Bob Ringwood (\"Batman\", \"Troy\") studied pedestrians on the Las Vegas Strip for his influence on the Rouge City extras. Spielberg found post-production on \"A.I.\" difficult because he was simultaneously preparing to shoot \"Minority Report\".\n\nThe film's soundtrack was released by Warner Sunset Records in 2001. The original score was composed and conducted by John Williams and featured singers Lara Fabian on two songs and Josh Groban on one. The film's score also had a limited release as an official \"For your consideration Academy Promo\", as well as a complete score issue by La-La Land Records in 2015. The band Ministry appears in the film playing the song \"What About Us?\" (but the song does not appear on the official soundtrack album).\n\nWarner Bros. used an alternate reality game titled \"The Beast\" to promote the film. Over forty websites were created by Atomic Pictures in New York City (kept online at Cloudmakers.org) including the website for Cybertronics Corp. There were to be a series of video games for the Xbox video game console that followed the storyline of \"The Beast\", but they went undeveloped. To avoid audiences mistaking \"A.I.\" for a family film, no action figures were created, although Hasbro released a talking Teddy following the film's release in June 2001.\n\n\"A.I.\" had its premiere at the Venice Film Festival in 2001.\n\n\"A.I. Artificial Intelligence\" was released on VHS and DVD by Warner Home Video on March 5, 2002 in both a standard full-screen release with no bonus features, and as a 2-Disc Special Edition featuring the film in its original 1.85:1 anamorphic widescreen format as well as an eight-part documentary detailing the film's development, production, music and visual effects. The bonus features also included interviews with Haley Joel Osment, Jude Law, Frances O'Connor, Steven Spielberg and John Williams, two teaser trailers for the film's original theatrical release and an extensive photo gallery featuring production sills and Stanley Kubrick's original storyboards.\n\nThe film was released on Blu-ray Disc on April 5, 2011 by Paramount Home Media Distribution for the U.S. and by Warner Home Video for international markets. This release featured the film a newly restored high-definition print and incorporated all the bonus features previously included on the 2-Disc Special Edition DVD.\n\nThe film opened in 3,242 theaters in the United States on June 29, 2001, earning $29,352,630 during its opening weekend. \"A.I\" went on to gross $78.62 million in US totals as well as $157.31 million in foreign countries, coming to a worldwide total of $235.93 million.\n\nBased on 192 reviews collected by Rotten Tomatoes, 73% of critics gave the film positive notices with a score of 6.6/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \"A curious, not always seamless, amalgamation of Kubrick's chilly bleakness and Spielberg's warm-hearted optimism. \"A.I.\" is, in a word, fascinating.\" By comparison, Metacritic collected an average score of 65, based on 32 reviews, which is considered favorable.\n\nProducer Jan Harlan stated that Kubrick \"would have applauded\" the final film, while Kubrick's widow Christiane also enjoyed \"A.I\". Brian Aldiss admired the film as well: \"I thought what an inventive, intriguing, ingenious, involving film this was. There are flaws in it and I suppose I might have a personal quibble but it's so long since I wrote it.\" Of the film's ending, he wondered how it might have been had Kubrick directed the film: \"That is one of the 'ifs' of film history—at least the ending indicates Spielberg adding some sugar to Kubrick's wine. The actual ending is overly sympathetic and moreover rather overtly engineered by a plot device that does not really bear credence. But it's a brilliant piece of film and of course it's a phenomenon because it contains the energies and talents of two brilliant filmmakers.\" Richard Corliss heavily praised Spielberg's direction, as well as the cast and visual effects. Roger Ebert gave the film three stars, saying that it was \"wonderful and maddening.\" Leonard Maltin, on the other hand, gives the film two stars out of four in his \"Movie Guide\", writing: \"[The] intriguing story draws us in, thanks in part to Osment's exceptional performance, but takes several wrong turns; ultimately, it just doesn't work. Spielberg rewrote the adaptation Stanley Kubrick commissioned of the Brian Aldiss short story 'Super Toys Last All Summer Long'; [the] result is a curious and uncomfortable hybrid of Kubrick and Spielberg sensibilities.\" However, he calls John Williams' music score \"striking\". Jonathan Rosenbaum compared \"A.I.\" to \"Solaris\" (1972), and praised both \"Kubrick for proposing that Spielberg direct the project and Spielberg for doing his utmost to respect Kubrick's intentions while making it a profoundly personal work.\" Film critic Armond White, of the \"New York Press\", praised the film noting that \"each part of David’s journey through carnal and sexual universes into the final eschatological devastation becomes as profoundly philosophical and contemplative as anything by cinema’s most thoughtful, speculative artists – Borzage, Ozu, Demy, Tarkovsky.\" Filmmaker Billy Wilder hailed \"A.I.\" as \"the most underrated film of the past few years.\" When British filmmaker Ken Russell saw the film, he wept during the ending.\n\nMick LaSalle gave a largely negative review. \"\"A.I.\" exhibits all its creators' bad traits and none of the good. So we end up with the structureless, meandering, slow-motion endlessness of Kubrick combined with the fuzzy, cuddly mindlessness of Spielberg.\" Dubbing it Spielberg's \"first boring movie\", LaSalle also believed the robots at the end of the film were aliens, and compared Gigolo Joe to the \"useless\" Jar Jar Binks, yet praised Robin Williams for his portrayal of a futuristic Albert Einstein. Peter Travers gave a mixed review, concluding \"Spielberg cannot live up to Kubrick's darker side of the future.\" But he still put the film on his top ten list that year for best movies. David Denby in \"The New Yorker\" criticized \"A.I.\" for not adhering closely to his concept of the Pinocchio character. Spielberg responded to some of the criticisms of the film, stating that many of the \"so called sentimental\" elements of \"A.I.\", including the ending, were in fact Kubrick's and the darker elements were his own. However, Sara Maitland, who worked on the project with Kubrick in the 1990s, claimed that one of the reasons Kubrick never started production on \"A.I.\" was because he had a hard time making the ending work. James Berardinelli found the film \"consistently involving, with moments of near-brilliance, but far from a masterpiece. In fact, as the long-awaited 'collaboration' of Kubrick and Spielberg, it ranks as something of a disappointment.\" Of the film's highly debated finale, he claimed, \"There is no doubt that the concluding 30 minutes are all Spielberg; the outstanding question is where Kubrick's vision left off and Spielberg's began.\"\n\nScreenwriter Ian Watson has speculated, \"Worldwide, \"A.I.\" was very successful (and the 4th highest earner of the year) but it didn't do quite so well in America, because the film, so I'm told, was too poetical and intellectual in general for American tastes. Plus, quite a few critics in America misunderstood the film, thinking for instance that the Giacometti-style beings in the final 20 minutes were aliens (whereas they were robots of the future who had evolved themselves from the robots in the earlier part of the film) and also thinking that the final 20 minutes were a sentimental addition by Spielberg, whereas those scenes were exactly what I wrote for Stanley and exactly what he wanted, filmed faithfully by Spielberg.\"\n\nIn 2002, Spielberg told film critic Joe Leydon that \"People pretend to think they know Stanley Kubrick, and think they know me, when most of them don't know either of us\". \"And what's really funny about that is, all the parts of \"A.I.\" that people assume were Stanley's were mine. And all the parts of \"A.I.\" that people accuse me of sweetening and softening and sentimentalizing were all Stanley's. The teddy bear was Stanley's. The whole last 20 minutes of the movie was completely Stanley's. The whole first 35, 40 minutes of the film – all the stuff in the house – was word for word, from Stanley's screenplay. This was Stanley's vision.\" \"Eighty percent of the critics got it all mixed up. But I could see why. Because, obviously, I've done a lot of movies where people have cried and have been sentimental. And I've been accused of sentimentalizing hard-core material. But in fact it was Stanley who did the sweetest parts of \"A.I.\", not me. I'm the guy who did the dark center of the movie, with the Flesh Fair and everything else. That's why he wanted me to make the movie in the first place. He said, 'This is much closer to your sensibilities than my own.\n\nUpon rewatching the film many years after its release, BBC film critic Mark Kermode apologized to Spielberg in an interview in January 2013 for \"getting it wrong\" on the film when he first viewed it in 2001. He now believes the film to be Spielberg's \"enduring masterpiece\".\n\nVisual effects supervisors Dennis Muren, Stan Winston, Michael Lantieri and Scott Farrar were nominated for the Academy Award for Best Visual Effects, while John Williams was nominated for Best Original Music Score. Steven Spielberg, Jude Law and Williams received nominations at the 59th Golden Globe Awards. \"A.I.\" was successful at the Saturn Awards, winning five awards, including Best Science Fiction Film along with Best Writing for Spielberg and Best Performance by a Younger Actor for Osment.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1617", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1617", "title": "Alexios V Doukas", "text": "Alexios V Doukas\n\nAlexios V Doukas (;  December 1204), in Latinised spelling Alexius V Ducas, was Byzantine emperor from 5 February to 12 April 1204, during the second and final siege of Constantinople by the participants of the Fourth Crusade. His family name was Doukas, but he was also known by the nickname Mourtzouphlos or Murtzuphlus (), referring to either bushy, overhanging eyebrows or a sullen, gloomy character. He achieved power through a palace coup, killing his predecessors in the process. Though he made vigorous attempts to defend Constantinople from the crusader army, his military efforts proved ineffective. His actions won the support of the mass of the populace, but he alienated the elite of the city. Following the fall, sack, and occupation of the city, Alexios V was blinded by another ex-emperor and later executed by the new Latin regime. He was the last Byzantine emperor to rule in Constantinople until the Byzantine recapture of Constantinople in 1261.\n\nThough possessing the name of a leading Byzantine aristocratic family, there is very little definitely known concerning the ancestry of Alexios Doukas Mourtzouphlos. The noble Doukas clan were not the only Doukai, as the surname was also employed by many families of humble origins. It has been claimed that Alexios Doukas was a great-great-grandson of the emperor Alexios I Komnenos () in the female line (cognatic descent). This is not improbable, as all other Byzantine emperors, and the majority of attempted usurpers, of the period had a connection with the former imperial house of the Komnenoi, either by descent or marriage. A more precise theory has been proposed, that he was the son of an Isaac Doukas, and was the second cousin of Alexios IV Angelos (). A letter sent to Pope Innocent III, stated that Alexios Doukas Mourtzouphlos was 'a blood relation' of Alexios IV Angelos.\n\nThe contemporary historian Niketas Choniates was dismissed from office as logothete of the \"sekreta\" by Mourtzouphlos. His assessment of the emperor's character might therefore be biased; however, Choniates allows that he was extremely clever by nature, though arrogant in his manner and lecherous.\n\nThe participation of Alexios Doukas Mourtzouphlos in the attempted overthrow of Alexios III Angelos () by John Komnenos the Fat in 1200 had led to his imprisonment. Mourtzouphlos was probably imprisoned from 1201 until the restoration to the throne of Isaac II Angelos (), the brother and predecessor of Alexios III. Isaac II, along with his son Alexios IV Angelos, were restored to the throne through the intervention of the leaders of the Fourth Crusade in July 1203. On release, Mourtzouphlos was invested with the court position of \"protovestiarios\" (head of the imperial finances). He had been married twice but was allegedly the lover of Eudokia Angelina, a daughter of Alexios III.\n\nBy the beginning of 1204, Isaac II and Alexios IV had inspired little confidence among the people of Constantinople with their efforts to protect the city from the Latin crusaders and their Venetian allies, and the citizens were becoming restless. The crusaders were also losing patience with the emperors; they rioted and set fires in the city when the money and aid promised by Alexios IV was not forthcoming. The fires affected about a sixth of the area of Constantinople and may have made up to a third of the population homeless; the dislocation and desperation of those affected eventually sapped the will of the people to resist the crusaders. Alexios Doukas Mourtzouphlos emerged as a leader of the anti-Latin movement in the city. He won the approval of the populace by his valour in leading an attack on the Latins at \"Trypetos Lithos\"; in this clash his mount stumbled and he would have been killed or captured had a band of youthful archers from the city not defended him. Mourtzouphlos exploited the hatred of the people for the Latins to serve his personal ambition.\n\nThe citizens of Constantinople rebelled in late January 1204, and in the chaos an otherwise obscure nobleman named Nicholas Kanabos was acclaimed emperor, though he was unwilling to accept the crown. The two co-emperors barricaded themselves in the Palace of Blachernae and entrusted Mourtzouphlos with a mission to seek help from the crusaders, or at least they informed him of their intentions. Instead of contacting the crusaders, Mourtzouphlos, on the night of 28–29 January 1204, used his access to the palace to bribe the \"ax-bearers\" (the Varangian Guard), and with their backing arrest the emperors. Choniates states that Mourtzouphlos, when bribing the guards, had the help of a eunuch with access to the imperial treasury. The support of the Varangians seems to have been of major importance in the success of the coup, though Mourtzouphlos also had help from his relations and associates. The young Alexios IV was eventually strangled in prison; while his father Isaac, both enfeebled and blind, died at around the time of the coup, his death variously attributed to fright, sorrow, or mistreatment. Kanabos, after refusing to take office under Alexios V, took sanctuary in the Hagia Sophia, but was forcibly removed and killed on the steps of the cathedral.\n\nThe timing of the deaths of the deposed emperors and of Kanabos, and their relation to the coronation of Alexios V are problematic. Alexios V appears to have been acclaimed emperor as early as the night he moved against the Angeloi co-emperors. Hendrickx and Matzukis suggest that Alexios V assumed the imperial insignia immediately, but was crowned later, possibly on 5 February. Finding the treasury empty, the new emperor confiscated money from the aristocracy and high officials to be put to public use. These actions endeared Alexios V to the citizens, but alienated his relations and other prominent supporters. Once in firm control, Alexios V closed the gates of the city to the crusaders and strengthened the fortifications. Sword in hand, he was active in leading attacks on sorties made by the crusaders in search of supplies. On 2 February, Henry of Flanders led a part of the crusader army to Filea (or Phileas), in order to obtain food supplies. As he returned towards Constantinople Alexios V attacked his rearguard. The Byzantines were defeated and the imperial standard and an important icon of the Virgin (the \"Panagia Nikopoios\") were captured. The Byzantines lost some of their best soldiers in the clash, and Alexios V was lucky to escape alive. At about this time Alexios V attempted to destroy the crusader fleet with fire-ships, but to little effect. \n\nThe loss of the icon, traditionally seen as a physical embodiment of divine protection for the city, was a severe psychological blow. Its possession by the crusaders convinced many of the population of Constantinople that the victory of the Westerners was now divinely sanctioned, as a punishment for the sins of the Byzantines.\n\nOn 8 February Alexios V met the Doge of Venice, Enrico Dandolo, for peace talks. The conditions demanded by the Venetian, however, were too harsh for the Byzantines to consider. Choniates states that the meeting was brought to a close by an sudden attack by crusader cavalry on Alexios V and his entourage, the emperor narrowly escaping capture. According to Choniates, Alexios IV was killed the same day; the insistence by the crusaders that he be restored to the throne may have precipitated his death. When news of the death of Alexios IV reached the crusaders, relations between them and Alexios V deteriorated further. The forcible expulsion of all Latins resident in Constantinople in March seems to have been the tipping point which led the crusaders to begin actively negotiating amongst themselves regarding the partition of the Byzantine Empire. They also began to prepare for their final assault on the city, which took place the following month.\n\nThe defenders of Constantinople held out against a crusader assault on 9 April. The crusaders' second attack three days later, however, proved too strong to repel. Breaking through the walls near the Petria Gate, the crusaders entered the city and looted the Blachernae Palace. Alexios V attempted to rally the people to the defence of the city, but with no success. Alexios V then boarded a fishing boat and fled the city towards Thrace on the night of 12 April 1204, accompanied by Eudokia Angelina and her mother Euphrosyne Doukaina Kamatera. In the Hagia Sophia Constantine Laskaris was acclaimed as emperor, but being unable to persuade the Varangians to continue the fight, in the early hours of 13 April he also fled, leaving Constantinople under crusader control.\n\nAlexios V and his companions eventually reached Mosynopolis, which had been occupied by the deposed emperor Alexios III Angelos and his followers. At first they were well received, with Alexios V marrying Eudokia Angelina. Later, however, Alexios III arranged for his new son-in-law to be made captive and blinded, thereby rendering him ineligible for the imperial throne. Having been abandoned by both his supporters and his father-in-law, Alexios V was captured near Mosynopolis, or possibly in Anatolia, by the advancing Latins under Thierry de Loos in November 1204. On his return to Constantinople as a prisoner, Alexios V was tried for treason against Alexios IV. In his trial the blind ex-emperor argued that it was Alexios IV who had committed treason to his country, through his intention to invite the crusaders to enter Constantinople in force. On being condemned, he was executed by novel means: he was thrown to his death from the top of the Column of Theodosius. The new, alien, Latin regime of conquerors in Constantinople may have viewed the public trial and execution of the man who murdered the last \"legitimate emperor\" as a way to cast an aura of legitimacy on themselves. Alexios V was the last Byzantine Emperor to reign in Constantinople before the establishment of the Latin Empire, which controlled the city for the next 57 years, until it was recovered by the Nicaean Emperor Michael VIII Palaiologos in 1261.\n\n\n\n"}

He used his singing talents often on the show, and performed two songs on the series' 2005 soundtrack album, \"\".\n\nAndrew Alcott Hallett was an only child. He was 6 foot 2 inches tall and hailed from the Cape Cod village of Osterville, Massachusetts, which is part of the town of Barnstable. He was a 1993 graduate from Barnstable High School and he went on to Assumption College in Worcester after graduation.\n\nHe did not begin singing publicly until he was invited onstage at a concert, and discovered the thrill of performing. He was in the audience at a Patti LaBelle concert, in Boston, when she coaxed a group of guys onto the stage; \"I'm this little white boy. I started singing, and we blew the house down. I sang a line and she said, 'This is a white boy with soul.'\"\n\nAfter moving to Los Angeles, Hallett worked as a runner for an agency and then as a property manager. He eventually became a personal assistant to Kai Cole, wife of \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\" creator Joss Whedon. When the couple and their friends saw Hallett singing at the \"B.B. Kings\" lounge at Universal CityWalk, Whedon conceived a new character for his new show \"Angel\": Lorne, an anagogic demon who reads the hearts and futures of his guests as they sing in his karaoke bar. Hallett was invited to try out for the part, and won it after three auditions. \"Angel\" was his first real job as an actor, though he did play an extra role in a 1999 episode of \"Buffy\"; he acquired agent Pat Brady only after she spotted him singing and acting in \"Judgment\", the premiere episode of \"Angel\"'s second season.\n\nThe character of Lorne was featured as a recurring character in 45 episodes before Hallett was added to the title sequence as a series regular for the last nine episodes of the fourth season, and all of the fifth; in total he appeared as Lorne in 76 of the show's 110 episodes. The character's demonic visage involved extensive prosthetic makeup and detailed coloring of his face, neck and hands, leading to early calls for at least two and a half hours of makeup before Hallett's filming day could begin.\n\nDuring the run of \"Angel\", Hallett appeared in two other small productions: \"The Enforcers\" (2001), a TV miniseries directed by \"Angel\" writer Mere Smith, and \"Chance\" (2002), a film directed by \"Buffy\" actress Amber Benson.\n\nAccording to a 2005 interview, about a month after filming the last episode of \"Angel\", Hallett suffered a dental infection which spread through the bloodstream to his heart, leading to a case of cardiomyopathy, for which he spent five days in the hospital. Although he recovered, his heart muscle and valves were weakened and he found himself easily fatigued afterward. He did not return to acting (except for a voice part in the animated film \"Geppetto's Secret\"), but pursued his music career and frequently appeared at media conventions for \"Buffy\" and \"Angel\" and for science fiction and fantasy in general.\n\nFive years after first experiencing heart problems, and after at least three additional hospitalizations, Hallett died from congestive heart failure on March 29, 2009 at Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles with his father by his bedside. He was 33 years old.\n\nThe character of Lorne continued on in the comic book series \"\", and a 48-page book about the character was written by John Byrne. Chris Ryall of IDW Publishing said, \"the issue serves as a tribute to Andy as well as a final send-off for Lorne, too.\"\n\n"}

The term also encompasses the long term consequences, often of a cognitive nature, of damage to the brain or cranium. Medical study of birth trauma dates to the 16th century, and the morphological consequences of mishandled delivery are described in Renaissance-era medical literature. Birth injury occupies a unique area of concern and study in the medical canon. In ICD-10 \"birth trauma\" occupied 49 individual codes (P10-Р15).\n\nHowever, there are often clear distinctions to be made between brain damage caused by birth trauma and that induced by intrauterine asphyxia. It is also crucial to distinguish between \"birth trauma\" and \"birth injury\". Birth injuries encompass any systemic damages incurred during delivery (hypoxic, toxic, biochemical, infection factors, etc.), but \"birth trauma\" focuses largely on mechanical damage. Caput succedaneum, subcutaneous hemorrhages, small subperiostal hemorrhages, hemorrhages along the displacements of cranial bones, intradural bleedings, subcapsular haematomas of liver, are among the more commonly reported birth injuries. Birth trauma, on the other hand, encompasses the enduring side effects of physical birth injuries, including the ensuing compensatory and adaptive mechanisms and the development of pathological processes (pathogenesis) after the damage.\n\nSequelae can occur in both the mother and the infant after a traumatic birth.\n\nBirth trauma is uncommon in the Western world in relation to rates in the third world. In the West injury occurs in 1.1% of C-sections.\n\nWhile any number of injuries may occur during the birthing process. A number of specific conditions are well described. Brachial plexus palsy occurs in 0.4 to 5.1 infants per 1000 live birth. Head trauma and brain damage during delivery can lead to a number of conditions include: caput succedaneum, cephalohematoma, subgaleal hemorrhage, subdural hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, epidural hemorrhage, and intraventricular hemorrhage.\n\nThe most common fracture during delivery is that of the clavicle (0.5%).\n"}

He subsequently drove taxis for 15 years in Cairns. In his thirties Law returned to Griffith University to study history and politics with a special interest in Asia and Pacific history and regional militarism. He was a campus activist and became President of the Student Union.\n\nLaw was radicalised during the government of Joh Bjelke Petersen and was first arrested at a large right to march street demonstration in Brisbane. He was arrested more than 30 times. Law blogged widely. He had ambitions to become a lawyer but felt he came from the wrong class at the wrong time. He revelled in the intellectual stimulation offered by the court room process. He was acknowledged by judges, barristers and adversaries as an honourable challenger.

Campaigns he was involved with included Aboriginal rights, which he initially explored in relation to the Brisbane Commonwealth Games in 1982. He lived on Fraser Island during the blockade to interrupt logging. He was involved in local issues such as improving bicycle facilities, the Cairns Yacht Club and most recently the \"Save City Place\" campaign in Cairns.\n\nHe had a keen interest in opposing militarism and this became his primary passion. As an antimilitarist activist he first opposed visits of US and UK warships to Australia during the Bicentennial. It was during this time he started to explore the power of small group nonviolence. He teamed up with fellow nonviolent activist Margaret Pestorius and they followed their shared passion of educating ordinary people about the practice of nonviolence. With the Cairns Peace by Peace group they began citizens' inspections of visiting US warships at a time when Law considered Australia was in a state of perpetual war.

As such, BCP is a subset of risk management. In the US, government entities refer to the process as \"continuity of operations planning\" (COOP). A Business Continuity Plan outlines a range of disaster scenarios and the steps the business will take in any particular scenario to return to regular trade. BCP's are written ahead of time and can also include precautions to be put in place.

{"id": "44636079", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=44636079", "title": "Constructive cooperative coevolution", "text": "Constructive cooperative coevolution\n\nThe constructive cooperative coevolutionary algorithm (also called C) is a global optimisation algorithm in artificial intelligence based on the multi-start architecture of the greedy randomized adaptive search procedure (GRASP). It incorporates the existing cooperative coevolutionary algorithm (CC). The considered problem is decomposed into subproblems. These subproblems are optimised separately while exchanging information in order to solve the complete problem. An optimisation algorithm, usually but not necessarily an evolutionary algorithm, is embedded in C for optimising those subproblems. The nature of the embedded optimisation algorithm determines whether C's behaviour is deterministic or stochastic.\n\nThe C optimisation algorithm was originally designed for simulation-based optimisation but it can be used for global optimisation problems in general. Its strength over other optimisation algorithms, specifically cooperative coevolution, is that it is better able to handle non-separable optimisation problems.\n\nAn improved version was proposed later, called the Improved Constructive Cooperative Coevolutionary Differential Evolution (CDE), which removes several limitations with the previous version. A novel element of CDE is the advanced initialisation of the subpopulations. CDE initially optimises the subpopulations in a partially co-adaptive fashion. During the initial optimisation of a subpopulation, only a subset of the other subcomponents is considered for the co-adaptation. This subset increases stepwise until all subcomponents are considered. This makes CDE very effective on large-scale global optimisation problems (up to 1000 dimensions) compared to cooperative coevolutionary algorithm (CC) and Differential evolution.\n\nThe improved algorithm has then been adapted for multi-objective optimization.\n\nAs shown in the pseudo code below, an iteration of C exists of two phases. In Phase I, the constructive phase, a feasible solution for the entire problem is constructed in a stepwise manner. Considering a different subproblem in each step. After the final step, all subproblems are considered and a solution for the complete problem has been constructed. This constructed solution is then used as the initial solution in Phase II, the local improvement phase. The CC algorithm is employed to further optimise the constructed solution. A cycle of Phase II includes optimising the subproblems separately while keeping the parameters of the other subproblems fixed to a central blackboard solution. When this is done for each subproblem, the found solution are combined during a \"collaboration\" step, and the best one among the produced combinations becomes the blackboard solution for the next cycle. In the next cycle, the same is repeated. Phase II, and thereby the current iteration, are terminated when the search of the CC algorithm stagnates and no significantly better solutions are being found. Then, the next iteration is started. At the start of the next iteration, a new feasible solution is constructed, utilising solutions that were found during the Phase I of the previous iteraton(s). This constructed solution is then used as the initial solution in Phase II in the same way as in the first iteration. This is repeated until one of the termination criteria for the optimisation is reached, e.g. a maximum number of evaluations.\n\nThe multi-objective version of the C algorithm is a Pareto-based algorithm which uses the same divide-and-conquer strategy as the single-objective C optimisation algorithm . The algorithm again starts with the advanced constructive initial optimisations of the subpopulations, considering an increasing subset of subproblems. The subset increases until the entire set of all subproblems is included. During these initial optimisations, the subpopulation of the latest included subproblem is evolved by a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm. For the fitness calculations of the members of the subpopulation, they are combined with a collaborator solution from each of the previously optimised subpopulations. Once all subproblems' subpopulations have been initially optimised, the multi-objective C optimisation algorithm continues to optimise each subproblem in a round-robin fashion, but now collaborator solutions from all other subproblems' subspopulations are combined with the member of the subpopulation that is being evaluated. The collaborator solution is selected randomly from the solutions that make up the Pareto-optimal front of the subpopulation. The fitness assignment to the collaborator solutions is done in an optimistic fashion (i.e. an \"old\" fitness value is replaced when the new one is better).\n\nThe constructive cooperative coevolution algorithm has been applied to different types of problems, e.g. a set of standard benchmark functions, optimisation of sheet metal press lines and interacting production stations. The C algorithm has been embedded with, amongst others, the differential evolution algorithm and the particle swarm optimiser for the subproblem optimisations.\n\n\n"}

The band released their debut album with Williams, \"Sinner\", in 2001. Williams soon gained recognition for his performances with the band; his nickname \"Stage\" came from Pantera guitarist Dimebag Darrell, who gave it to him because of his known stage personality.\n\nHowever, on August 14, 2002, Williams was found dead in the band's tour bus in Manassas, Virginia. An autopsy established that he had died from heart failure caused by cardiomyopathy (heart muscle disease), which went undiagnosed until his death.\n\nA public funeral was held in Plano, Texas, on August 18, 2002 at 10:00 am. A DVD titled \"Sinema\" which chronicles his life, has since been released. His lifelong dream was to buy his parents a house; the sales from \"Sinema\" fulfilled his dream posthumously.\n\nWilliams's microphone was given to Cristian Machado from Ill Niño. They were good friends, so after his death, Drowning Pool and Williams' family gave it as a signal of respect.

At a young age she married the Bolognese anarchist Giulio Grandi, with whom she had a daughter, Edvige. The Grandi home became a gathering place for anarchists and provided shelter to militants such as P. Gori and Vivaldo Lacchini. \n\nCavedagni (then known as Ersilia Grandi) was one of the few women in the region to play a significant role in the movement. She is said to have had a remarkable and lively intelligence as well as \"belle fattezze\" (beautiful features). She wrote propaganda and gave speeches to crowds of proletarian women. From September 1894 to April 1895 she was imprisoned in Bassano Veneto for her political activities.\n\nSometime in the 1890s, she met and fell in love with Giuseppe Ciancabilla, a fellow anarchist and a friend of Errico Malatesta. The pair fled Italy together during the police crackdown on workers' movements. They spent two years traveling in Switzerland, Belgium, and France, during which Cavedagni published several essays and letters in \"La Questione Sociale\" (The Social Question). In one letter, she criticized women anarchists in the United States for failing to address the \"woman question,\" writing, \"If we were to have many anarchist women, oh, believe me, the movement would grow substantially...who does not remember the teachings of our mothers?\"\n\nIn 1898, Cavedagni and Ciancabilla moved to Paterson, New Jersey, where Ciancabilla became editor of \"La Questione Sociale\" and later, editor of another anarchist newspaper, \"L'Aurora\". During her stay in the area she befriended and influenced the young anarchist Ernestina Cravello and joined the Teatro Sociale, a theater group that staged plays about women's emancipation. She published essays in \"L'Aurora\" and \"Cronaca Sovversiva\", and edited several issues of \"L'Aurora\" after Ciancabilla was arrested for praising Leon Czolgosz (the man who assassinated President McKinley in 1901). \n\nThe couple moved to Chicago, then San Francisco, where they were closely monitored by the Italian authorities. Cavedagni was considered a \"very dangerous anarchist,\" of \"limited formal instruction but much audaciousness.\" Ciancabilla suddenly fell ill and died in 1904 at the age of 32.\n\nWhat little is known of Cavedagni's later life is based on her correspondence and subscriptions to anarchist newspapers. She moved frequently, living at various times in Philadelphia, New York, Vancouver, and San Francisco. In 1912 she was living in Seattle with the Spanish anarchist Leon Morel. According to an Italian police report, she was still living \"abroad\" in 1941.\n\n\n"}

It achieved notoriety as one of the most bizarre fights in boxing history, after Tyson bit off part of Holyfield's ear. Tyson was disqualified from the match and lost his boxing license, though it was later reinstated. \n\nThe fight took place at the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas, Nevada. The referee officiating the fight was Mills Lane, who was brought in as a late replacement when Tyson's camp protested the original selection of Mitch Halpern (who officiated the first fight) as the referee.\n\nTyson and Holyfield fought seven months earlier in Las Vegas. Tyson was making his first defense of the WBA championship he had won from Bruce Seldon in a first round knockout. Holyfield, despite being a former champion, was a significant underdog entering the match as he had been rather lackluster in several fights since he returned to fighting in 1995 after a brief retirement. However, Holyfield surprised Tyson by controlling the contest and knocked him down in the sixth round. Halpern stopped the fight in the eleventh round, giving Holyfield an upset victory.\n\nThe fight began with Holyfield dominating Tyson. Holyfield won the first three rounds. At 2:19 of the first round, an overhand right from Holyfield stunned Tyson, but Tyson fought back immediately pushing Holyfield backwards. At 32 seconds into the second round, Holyfield ducked under a right from Tyson. In doing so, he head-butted Tyson, opening a large cut over the latter's right eye (although trainer Ritchie Giachetti believed the cut happened in the first round). Tyson had repeatedly complained about head-butting in the first bout between the two fighters. Upon reviewing replays, referee Mills Lane stated the headbutts were unintentional and nonpunishable.\n\nAs the third round was about to begin, Tyson came out of his corner without his mouthpiece. Lane ordered Tyson back to his corner to insert it. Tyson inserted his mouthpiece, got back into position and the match resumed. Tyson began the third round with a furious attack. With forty seconds remaining in the round, Holyfield got Tyson in a clinch, and Tyson rolled his head above Holyfield's shoulder and bit Holyfield on his right ear. The bite avulsed a one-inch piece of cartilage from the top of the ear, and Tyson spit out the piece of ear onto the ring floor. As Holyfield shrieked in pain and jumped in circles, he managed to push Tyson away, at which point Lane called for a time-out. As Holyfield turned to walk to his corner, Tyson shoved him from behind. Lane sent Tyson to a neutral corner as an enraged Holyfield gestured for Mills Lane to look at his bitten ear, which was rapidly bleeding.\n\nThe fight was delayed for several minutes as Lane debated what to do. Lane's original decision was to immediately disqualify Tyson, but after the ringside doctor determined that Holyfield was able to continue despite the massive bite, Lane announced he would be deducting two points from Tyson and the fight would continue. Bobby Czyz, who was calling the fight with Steve Albert for Showtime, said, \"I wonder how this would have played in Mitch Halpern's eyes,\" and Albert told Czyz, \"That's a thought, Bobby.\" As Lane explained the decision to Tyson and his cornermen, Tyson asserted that the injury to Holyfield's ear was the result of a punch. \"Bullshit,\" Lane retorted. The fight was resumed.\n\nDuring another clinch, Tyson bit Holyfield's left ear. Holyfield threw his hands around to get out of the clinch and jumped back. Tyson's second bite just scarred Holyfield's ear. Lane did not stop the fight this time, so the two men continued fighting until time expired. The men walked back to their respective corners, and when the second bite was discovered, the fight was stopped.\n\nAfter the fight was stopped, Tyson went on a rampage at Holyfield and his trainer Brooks while they were still in their corner. Mills Lane told Tyson's corner that he was disqualifying Tyson for biting Holyfield. To protect Holyfield, security surrounded him in his corner and Tyson was taken back to his corner by security. Mills Lane was interviewed, and said he knew from experience that the bites were intentional. He had told Tyson not to bite anymore, and said Tyson asked to be disqualified by disobeying that order. Holyfield left the ring seconds after the interview, which gave the fans and audience the hint that the fight was over. Holyfield told the press afterward that Tyson bit him because he knew he was going to get knocked out and he chose to lose in a disqualification instead.\n\nReporters then interviewed Mike Tyson's instructor, who was upset about Lane's decision. The instructor said, \"They will have to explain that. I do not agree with it but it is what it is...all I know is Mike Tyson has a cut in his eye.\"\n\nTwenty-five minutes after the brawl ended, announcer Jimmy Lennon Jr. read the decision: \"Ladies and gentlemen, this bout has been stopped at the end of round number three. The referee in charge, Mills Lane, disqualifies Mike Tyson for biting Evander Holyfield in both ears, the winner by way of disqualification and still the WBA Champion of the world, Evander 'The Real Deal' Holyfield!\" As a result Holyfield remained the WBA Heavyweight champion.\n\nTyson said it was retaliation for the headbutts.\n\nLater, during post-match interviews, Tyson was walking back to his locker room when a fan from the stadium tossed a bottle of water in his direction. Tyson, his instructor and a pain manager climbed over a temporary railing and up into the stands, made obscene gestures to the crowd, and made their way up the side of a stairway. Tyson had to be restrained as he was led off. When interviewed about his championship and the incident with Tyson, Holyfield said he already forgave Tyson for biting him since he has 100% faith in God and Jesus.\n\nNonetheless, Tyson was sentenced with a permanent suspension from boxing and his license cancelled indefinitely. Tyson was also fined $3,000,000 and had to serve a period of community service. After a year and an appeal in court, Tyson's license was reinstated. When Tyson and Holyfield retired from boxing they befriended each other and are now close friends today.\n\nThe fight generated a total revenue of $180,000,000 ($), from live gate, pay-per-view, closed-circuit telecasts, foreign television rights, and casino profits.\n\nAs a result of biting Holyfield on both ears and other behavior, Tyson's boxing license was revoked by the Nevada State Athletic Commission and he was fined $3 million plus legal costs. The revocation was not permanent; a little more than a year later on October 18, 1998, the commission voted 4–1 to restore Tyson's boxing license.\n\nIn the 2008 documentary \"Tyson\", the boxer claimed he did it as retaliation for the headbutting.\n\nOn October 16, 2009 on \"The Oprah Winfrey Show\", Tyson apologized to Holyfield. Holyfield accepted his apology and forgave Tyson.\n\nA book entitled \"The Bite Fight\" was made in 2013 by George Willis, illustrating the lives of Tyson and Holyfield before, during, and after the fight.\n"}

{"id": "24131652", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24131652", "title": "Gender violence", "text": "Gender violence\n\nGender violence, also known as gender-based violence or gendered violence, is the term used to denote harm inflicted upon individuals and groups that is connected to normative understandings of their gender. This connection can be in the form of cultural understandings of gender roles, institutional and structural forces that endorse violence based on gender and societal influences that shape violent events along gender lines. While the term is often used synonymously with ‘violence against women’, gendered violence can and does occur for people of all genders including men, women, male and female children and gender diverse individuals. \n\nActivities heavily associated with violence are overwhelmingly shaped by understandings of gender and gender roles. War, for example, in contemporary understandings is divided between civilian and combatants with a general understanding that men make up the vast majority of combatants and women and young children the majority of civilians. In cases like the Srebenica massacre, in which 8,000 men and male children were killed, the basis of their murder was a gendered understanding that they had the potential of being, or becoming combatants in the Bosnian war.\n\nIn discussing gender and violence at regional levels, the experiences of people who exist in transition between spaces or who are not counted within regional data can potentially be omitted from this discussion; these include displaced persons, people seeking asylum and refugees.\n\nViolence against women is a major concern in the Asian regions, especially the prevalence of marital violence varies considerably across South Asian countries. For married women aged 15–49 years, physical or sexual violence within marriage has been experienced by 20% in the Maldives, 26% in Pakistan, 28% in Nepal, 38% in India and 53% in Bangladesh. The violence against women is a very serious issue that can be attributed to the death. For example, India recorded over 40.000 dowry-related deaths between 2011 and 2015. In Nepal and Bangladesh, the Asia Foundation points out that gender-based violence is the first or second cause of international homicides in these countries. One of the biggest historical violence against women is the phenomenon of comfort women. Comfort women refers to tens of thousands of young women, majority from Korea who were forced into sex slaves for Japanese military during the Asia Pacific War. Korea’s comfort women represent gender violence in the context of patriarchal colonial capitalism as the phenomenon reflects Japan’s colonial economy and traditional sexual cultures of Japanese and Korean patriarchy. Therefore, they were victims of sexism, classism, racism, colonialism, militarism, and capitalist imperialism.\n\nSee also Violence against women in Malaysia\n\nGendered violence in the Middle East greatly targeted towards women and is justified by political and religious laws; acts of gendered violence take the form of forced early marriage, rape, and domestic violence. Gendered violence can also be found in instances where Islamic law is used to justify killing women in order to preserve male honor. In Yemen, for example, 400 women were subjected to honor killings between 1996 and 1998. Ways in which women are held to a code of honor include the practice of wearing scarves and refraining from using makeup, failure to do so can potentially result in physical and verbal harassment or loss of jobs. Scholars Islamic laws make it justifiable to rape, beat, and sell non-Muslim women and girls. The highly patriarchal mindset that takes place in both religious and political laws makes it difficult for women to seek an alternative option. Most women in the Middle East are financially dependant on their husband and access to education or finances is rare. Furthermore, women require permission from a male guardian if they wish to marry, travel, or work. Women who are married also face the risk of domestic violence. A study conducted on Egyptian women found that they believed  physical violence from their partners was justifiable. Most women in the Middle East are also subject to forced early marriage, that can legally occur before the age of eighteen. Socioeconomic status plays a role as poor families are highly likely to marry their daughters for the right price, specifically in Yemen, where it is more difficult to marry daughters past the age of twenty because they are seen as too old. Interviews with women from Yemen and Palestine revealed that their experience with young marriage included violent and painful acts of rape and sexual assault by their husbands. Gendered violence against women and female children in the Middle East is normalized and supported by existing patriarchal values and beliefs that exist both in a religious and political context.\n\nTo understand the connection between Gender and Violence in the Oceanic context it is crucial to understand the effects of colonisation on Aotearoa (New Zealand), the Pacific islands and the many nations within the Australian continent. While practices of colonisation in these regions have not been homogenous, colonisation has disrupted gender roles, relationships and modes of production, which continue to influence both contemporary gender relations and practices of violence and domination.  As Atkinson discusses, in Australia ongoing colonial relationships of power continue to create and perpetuate gendered violence, particularly for Indigenous women. Similarly, for Aotearoa/New Zealand the introduction of colonial patriarchy and racialised colonial power has fundamentally altered Māori frameworks and relationships to the land which have transformed both Māori ways of being and interpersonal relationships such as connections between genders. Not only have these changed relationships resulted in sexual gender based violence but also a broader adoption of masculine settler norms that foster violence and gender discrimination. Despite these colonial legacies there is a strong focus on supporting peace and deconstructing gendered relations. For example, in the Pacific, the Women, Peace and Security agenda has a large role in preventing violence in Pacific communities as women within in this region play strong roles in advocating for peace and working to prevent violent conflict.\n\nGendered violence continues to be an ongoing issue in the European region with high rates of sexual harassment, intimate partner violence, domestic violence and conflict. Within the European Union research suggests that one-third of all women over fifteen years old have experienced some form of physical or sexual violence. While European institutions have implemented a plethora of initiatives through the European Union, United Nations declarations and the European commission these programs are predominantly legal or punitive reforms that concentrate on structural rather than cultural change. Europe also has a long history of gender-based violence including violent periods of religious persecution through eras such as the ‘Witch hunts’.\n\nGendered violence exists in North America in forms such as stalking, intimate partner violence, physical abuse, emotional abuse, and sexual assault. Overall, women in North America are victims of  sexual violence far more than men. Studies indicate that 82% of sexual assault survivors are women, while 98% of offenders are man. Additionally, women in North America are more likely than men to experience forms  of sexual violence before the age of eighteen.  Forms of intimate partner violence is experienced at a higher rate by women; this is not limited to sexual violence but included stalking and severe physical violence as well.  Overall, about one in six students at college campuses in the United States and Canada report experiencing violence in a six month period. The main difference regarding the types of violence experienced by men in women on college campus was incidents of sexual assault. Research found that women were more likely to report issues of sexual assault and emotional abuse than men, but men and women were equally likely to report other forms of violence. A study done in the United States revealed that both men and women believe it is more acceptable to for women to display acts of physical violence on their male partner than vise versa; Because of this, women’s acts of violence is seen as less less injurious and more socially acceptable. As a result is suspected that men experience dating violence at a higher rate than studies reveal but are not likely to report such incidents.\n\nA major cause of gendered violence in Central and South America comes from a high prevalence of gangs affiliation and membership. In the past, criminal gangs were viewed through a male dominant perception but new research suggests recruitment and involvement of women in gangs is rapidly increasing. It used to be the case that women would support partners who were gang members while, but now women are being used to commit crimes that were traditionally for men because their essence of innocence deters police. Despite women carrying out masculine roles within gangs, they are still the primary target of violence and face constant abuse by their partners. Women who try to leave gangs will often be threatened by other members and will stay in affiliation because they receive very little help from authorities. Some women believe it is safer to continue gang membership than to report to authorities because police in Central America, specifically in Guatemala, are notorious for abusing their power to abuse women and in other cases prove to be unresponsive to reports of violence. Women who attempt to seek refuge in the United States are usually denied due to their pre-existing gang membership, or because they do not have evidence of violence being perpetrated against them. Other legalities make it difficult for women to escape forms of violence such as rape or domestic violence. In Guatemala, “girls can be forced to marry their rapists to preserve their own and the family’s honor”. The high influence of Christianity and Catholicism also make it unacceptable to leave a relationship due to domestic violence and many women are expected to put up with; religious influence on laws also make it impossible to receive an abortion even on occasions of rape. Gendered violence is typical in South and Central America, and is mostly violence directed towards women. The lack of assistance by law enforcement make it possible for this violence to continue and the large scale presence of gangs further contribute to gendered violence happening against women despite the growing number of women with gang membership.\n\nThe prevalence of violence against women is very severe in Africa where around one third of African women report to have experienced domestic violence both physical and sexual. Violence within the family, especially experienced by women is attributed to ancient socioeconomic conditions that shape social norms about marriage patterns, living arrangements and the productive role of women. Female Genital Mutilation (FGM) is considered a form of gender based violation that has a great influence on women and girls’ bodies. More than 200 million girls and women alive today have been subjected to FGM in 30 countries in Africa and the Middle East. FGM is not only a matter of discrimination against females, but it violates a person’s rights to health, security and physical integrity, the right to be free from torture and cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment, and the right to life when the procedure results in death. Gender violence does not only target women. In 33 African counties, adult same-sex acts are illegal, including 24 that criminalize lesbian acts, and many other countries have recently passed laws that restrict and punish groups that support work on sexual orientation and gender identity issues. Consequently, sexual minority people are subjected to gender violence, including being harassed, threatened and even killed in some places.\n\n"}

Along with Olena Prytula founded the internet newspaper Ukrayinska Pravda in 2000.\n\nThe circumstances of his death became a national scandal and a focus for protests against the government of the then President, Leonid Kuchma. During the Cassette Scandal, audiotapes were released on which Kuchma, Volodymyr Lytvyn and other top-level administration officials are allegedly heard discussing the need to silence Gongadze for his online news reports about high-level corruption. Former Interior Minister Yuriy Kravchenko died of two gunshots to the head on 4 March 2005, just hours before he was to begin providing testimony as a witness in the case. Kravchenko was the superior of the four policemen who were charged with Gongadze's murder soon after Kravchenko's death. The official ruling of suicide was doubted by media reports.\n\nThree former officials of the Ukrainian Interior Ministry's foreign surveillance department and criminal intelligence unit (Valeriy Kostenko, Mykola Protasov and Oleksandr Popovych) accused of his murder were arrested in March 2005 and a fourth one (Oleksiy Pukach, the former chief of the unit) in July 2009. A court in Ukraine sentenced Protasov to a sentence of 13 years and Kostenko and Popovych to 12-year terms March 2008 (the trial had begun January 2006) for the murder. Gongadze's family believe the trial had failed to bring the masterminds behind the killing to justice. No one has yet been charged with giving the order for Gongadze's murder.\n\nGongadze's widow Myroslava Gongadze and their two children received political asylum in the United States and have lived there since 2001.\n\nGongadze was awarded the title Hero of Ukraine by President Viktor Yushchenko on 23 August 2005.\n\nGongadze was buried in Kiev on 22 March 2016 in the .\n\nBorn in Tbilisi, at the time the capital of the Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic of the Soviet Union, Gongadze was the son of a Georgian architect Ruslan Gongadze and a Ukrainian dentist Olesya Korchak (a native of Lviv). His parents met in Lviv where they studied in universities and eventually got married. In 1967 the young Gongadze family moved to Tbilisi. Georgiy was born as a twin, but his brother was taken away while both of them were at the maternity chamber. Diminutive name for Georgiy was Giya. When Giya was 6 years old his parents divorced and his father later married for the second time and had another son from his second marriage. Giya's mother stayed single and continued to live and work in Tbilisi until 1994.\n\nDuring his school years, Giya was an outstanding athlete and was part of the Soviet reserve Olympic team in sprint on 100 and 200 meters. In his childhood Giya was growing up in multi-language environment speaking in Russian, Georgian, and English in school and Ukrainian at home. In 1986 Giya enrolled in the Foreign Languages Institute in Tbilisi with specialization in English language, but in 1987 he was already drafted in the Soviet Army serving in Turkmenistan on the border with Iran. His mother said that she had to pay to avoid for Georgiy to be sent to Afghanistan (Soviet–Afghan War). During that time the Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachov started his reforms perestroika along with liberalization of censorship (glasnost). The process only sped up the process of dissolution of the Soviet Union. Trying to stop the process and preserve the Soviet state, several armed and civil conflicts arose in the Soviet Union among which was the April 9 tragedy (Soviet troops killed 20 unarmed civilians) which radicalized many Georgians including Georgiy Gongadze.\n\nIn May 1989 Giya returned from the army. Both Ruslan Gongadze and his son Georgiy Gongadze joined the National Movement \"For free Georgia\" where Georgiy was its spokesperson, while Ruslan Gongadze became the leader. In 1989-90 Georgiy traveled to the Baltic states and Ukraine trying to find extra public support and rally more allies in the struggle to free Georgia from the Soviet Union. As part of his tour, in September 1989 Georgiy attended the first congress of the National Movement of Ukraine (People's Movement of Ukraine) in Kiev where he represented the Georgian organization. Georgiy also attended the first non-communist music and youth festival Chervona Ruta that in September 1989 was taking place in Chernivtsi. At the festival he met with Mariana Stetsko whom he married in 1990 and settled in Lviv. There Georgiy found a job as a teacher of English language and physical culture (fitness instructor). While working, Gongadze also studied at the Romano-Germanic languages Faculty of Ivan Franko National University. On 24 August 1991 the Ukrainian parliament announced that all residents of the Ukrainian SSR are considered to be citizens of Ukraine (Ukrainian citizenship).\nIn 1991 the first President of Georgia Zviad Gamsakhurdia announced several of his former allies as \"enemies of people\" among which was the father of Georgiy Gongadze. Ruslan Gongadze was forced to hide in a basement of a building next to the parliament in Tbilisi. In December 1991 a civil war ensued when government forces opened fire upon anti-Gamsakhurdia protestors in Tbilisi, while a militia armed by the oppositional parties counter-attacked. At the end of 1991 during the ongoing war Georgiy Gongadze returned to his mother in Tbilisi along with \"Kalashnikov\" saying, \"Mom, I arrived to protect the name and honor of my father\". Giya was not using the rifle and led a team of medical emergency services transferring wounded to a hospital until snipers opened fire on medics. On 14 January 1992 Zviad Gamsakhurdia fled Tbilisi and struggle ended. The power was taken by the opposition and a new president was elected. It was Eduard Shevardnadze, the former Soviet Foreign Minister and Communist leader of Soviet Georgia. On 15 January 1992 Georgiy Gongadze returned to Lviv where he found out that his wife left him.\n\nIn 1992 Gongadze founded a Georgian Culture Association in Lviv which was named after the Georgian Prince Bagrationi and served as an informational center. During the registration of the organization in government offices, Gongadze met Myroslava Petryshyn his future second wife. Both of them wrote an article \"Tragedy of leaders\" () about the Georgian Civil War that was published in the Lviv newspaper \"Post-Postup\" in 1992. Later in 1992 Gongadze returned to Tbilisi again to visit his mother who continued to work in a hospital as a nurse. At the time he had intentions to leave active politics and started an own business. But after speaking with several people changed his mind, while his mother was encouraging him to write about the victims of the civil war in Georgia. Gongadze received a camera from his mother and filmed a documentary about the civil war in Georgia \"The pain of my land\" (). In February 1993 the film was shown on the Ukrainian channel UT-3. During that period in 1992 Abkhazia and South Osetia proclaimed their independence and Georgia accused Russia in instigating conflicts in those regions. Soon new conflicts started.\n\nGongadze volunteered to war in Abkhazia, but was refused to be admitted to military service by the government authorities and offered for being a son of Ruslan Gongadze and a Ukrainian citizen to provide propaganda agitation in Ukraine. Georgiy returned to Lviv to perform his \"diplomatic mission\" in an active support of Georgia in inter-ethnic conflict. At that time in Ukraine he only was able to find a marginal group of UNA-UNSO that were ready to dedicate itself to the Georgian cause. Gongadze was visiting UNA-UNSO gatherings to find recruits for fighting in Georgia. UNA-UNSO that had for its goal \"to exile communists and criminals from Ukraine and overpower the Russian expansionism\" seemed to be coinciding with Georgian nationalists. In July 1993 the UNA-UNSO battalion \"Argo\" led by Dmytro Korchynsky arrived to Tbilisi and was ready for fight in Abkhazia.\n\nGongadze did not return to Georgia with UNA-UNSO, but rather stayed back in Ukraine as his father Ruslan Gongadze became ill with cancer and in March 1993 the government of Georgia send him to Ukraine for recovery. Georgiy moved to Kiev and stayed with his father. Ruslan Gongadze did not survive and died on 5 August 1993 at age 49. With the body of his father, Georgiy Gongadze returned to Tbilisi. After burying his father, Gongadze started to film a new documentary about the Ukrainian fighters in Abkhazia, funds for which he obtained from selling his \"Kalashnikov\" rifle. With the ongoing war that started in August 1992, the separatist forces supported by Russia took over most of Abkhazia and surrounded administrative center of Abkhazia, Sukhumi. In September 1993 in exchange for a cease fire, the government of Georgia agreed to pull its troops and heavy armament from Sukhumi. However, instead of cease fire the separatists started to assault the city. The city was protected by an army of irregular detachments. The president of Georgia Eduard Shevardnadze who also was present during the siege appealed to the President of Russia Boris Yeltsin to stop the attack, but Yeltsin chose to ignore it.\n\nOn 17 September 1993 Gongadze left Tbilisi for Sukhumi to film the events. Upon arrival, he was mobilized later that night and the following morning was at the frontlines along the Gumista River where the enemy was conducting the main assault. Gongadze was in a trench when over his head blew up an artillery shell. Shrapnel hit him in 26 places including his right hand. From imminent death he was saved by a steel helmet. Two other people that stood next to him perished. Those shards of shell forever were left inside of his body; and later were used to identify his dead body. About him being wounded, it was mentioned in a report from Sukhumi that was published in a Russophone Tbilisi newspaper \"Svobodnaya Gruzia\" on 21 September 1993. Gongadze was right away taken to a field hospital where he turn attention to himself by requesting to return from the battlefield his bag with video cassettes. That fact recalled the local militant Konstantin Alania also known as Koba who later became his friend for life. The cassettes were recovered by volunteers. The same Saturday night Gongadze and several other seriously wounded were sent to Tbilisi on a plane not long before the separatists occupied the city. Koba was left behind continue fighting and later managed to escape with some other militants withdrawing through mountain corridors. In 1995 he left Georgia for Lviv where by an accident met again with Georgiy.\n\nIn Tbilisi Gongadze continued with a treatment in a military hospital tended by his mother. However the worst situation was with food due to the situation in the country. His mother tried to send her son away from Georgia, but did not have enough money as the government did not pay the hospital staff since December 1991. Olesya Gongadze managed to raise some funds through friends and relatives and after spending two weeks in the hospital Georgiy flew away to Lviv in October 1993. Olesya Gongandze stayed behind. In Ukraine Georgiy created a new documentary out of his video cassettes that was shown on the Ukrainian television \"Shadows of war\". He married Myroslava and in 1997 the couple had two daughter-twins.\n\nIn 1996-1997 Gongadze worked for the Ukrainian television channel STB. He worked for the Kiev-based radio station Kontynent, on which he had his own show called \"First round with Heorhiy Gongadze\". His strongly independent line soon attracted hostility from the increasingly authoritarian government of Leonid Kuchma; during the October 1999 presidential election, his commentaries prompted a call from Kuchma's headquarters to say \"that he had been blacklisted to be dealt with after the election.\" In 1999 he was a spokesman for the Progressive Socialist Party of Ukraine Nataliya Vitrenko. Visiting New York in January 2000 with other Ukrainian journalists, he warned of \"the strangulation of the freedom of speech and information in our state.\"\n\nIn April 2000, Gongadze co-founded a news website, \"Ukrayinska Pravda\" (\"Ukrainian Truth\"), as a means of sidestepping the government's increasing influence over the mainstream media. He observed that following the muzzling of a prominent pro-opposition newspaper after the election, \"today there is practically no objective information available about Ukraine\". The website specialized in political news and commentary, focusing particularly on President Kuchma, the country's wealthy \"oligarchs\" and the official media.\n\nIn June 2000, Gongadze wrote an open letter to Ukraine's chief prosecutor about harassment from the SBU, the Ukrainian secret police, directed towards himself and his \"Ukrayinska Pravda\" colleagues and apparently related to an investigation into a murder case in the southern port of Odessa. He complained that he had been forced into hiding because of harassment from the secret police, that he said he and his family were being followed, that his staff were being harassed, and that the SBU were spreading a rumor that he was wanted on a murder charge.\n\nGeorgiy's mother died in 2013.\n\nGongadze disappeared on 16 September 2000, after failing to return home. Foul play was suspected from the outset. The matter immediately attracted widespread public attention and media interest. Eighty journalists signed an open letter to President Kuchma urging an investigation and complaining that \"during the years of Ukrainian independence, not a single high-profile crime against journalists has been fully resolved.\" Kuchma responded by ordering an immediate inquiry. This was, however, viewed with some skepticism. Opposition politician Hryhoriy Omelchenko reported that the disappearance had coincided with Gongadze receiving documents on corruption within the president's own entourage. The Ukrainian Parliament set up a parallel inquiry run by a special commission. Neither investigation produced any results.\n\nTwo months later, on 3 November 2000, a body was found in a forest in the Taraschanskyi Raion (district) of the Kiev Oblast (province), some outside Kiev near the city of Tarashcha. The corpse had been decapitated and doused in dioxine, apparently to make identification more difficult; forensic investigations found that the dioxine bath and decapitation had occurred while the victim was still alive. The Russian-edited, Russian-language Ukrainian newspaper \"Sevodnya\" (\"Today\") reported that Gongadze had been abducted by policemen and accidentally shot in the head while seated in a vehicle, necessitating his decapitation (to avoid the bullet being recovered and matched to a police weapon). His body had been doused in petrol which had failed to burn properly, and had then been dumped. A group of journalists first identified it as being that of Gongadze, a finding confirmed a few weeks later by his wife Myroslava. In a bizarre twist, the corpse was then confiscated by the police and resurfaced in a morgue in Kiev. The authorities did not officially acknowledge that the body was that of Gongadze until the following February and did not definitively confirm it until as late as March 2003. The body was eventually identified and was to be returned to Gongadze's family to be buried two years after his disappearance. However, the funeral never took place. As of 23 June 2006 Gongadze's mother refused to accept the remains offered as it was not the body of her son. While visiting Kiev in July 2006, Gongadze's widow Myroslava emphasized that the funeral had now become a solemn family issue and the date of the funeral would soon be appointed.\n\nOn 28 November 2000, opposition politician Oleksandr Moroz publicized secret tape recordings which he claimed implicated President Kuchma in Gongadze's murder. The recordings were said to be of discussions between Kuchma, presidential chief of staff Volodymyr Lytvyn, and Interior Minister Yuriy Kravchenko, and were claimed to have been provided by an unnamed SBU officer (later named as Major Mykola Mel'nychenko, Kuchma's bodyguard). The conversations included comments expressing annoyance at Gongadze's writings as well as discussions of ways to shut him up, such as deporting him and arranging from him to be kidnapped and taken to Chechnya. Killing him was, however, not mentioned and doubt was cast on the tapes' authenticity, as the quality of the recordings was poor. Moroz told the Ukrainian Verkhovna Rada (parliament) that \"the professionally organized disappearance, a slow-moving investigation, disregard for the most essential elements of investigation and incoherent comments by police officials suggest that the case was put together.\"\n\nIn September 2001, the American detective agency Kroll Inc., contracted by Labor Ukraine, had carried out a six-month investigation and concluded that then-President Leonid Kuchma had nothing to do with the murder of Gongadze.\n\nThe affair became a major political scandal (referred to in Ukraine as the \"Cassette Scandal\" or \"Tapegate\"). Kuchma strongly denied Moroz's accusations and threatened a libel suit, blaming the tapes on foreign agents. He later acknowledged that his voice was indeed one of those on the tapes, but claimed that they had been selectively edited to distort his meaning.\n\nIn November 2005, upon complaint of Gongadze's widow, the European Court of Human Rights found Ukraine to violate right to life, right to effective remedy and prohibition of degrading treatment.\n\nThe affair became an international crisis for the Ukrainian government during 2001, with the European Union expressing dissatisfaction at the official investigation, rumors of Ukrainian suspension from the Council of Europe, and censure from the OSCE, which described Gongadze's death as a case of \"censorship by killing\" and castigated the \"extremely unprofessional\" investigation. Mass demonstrations erupted in Kiev in February 2001, calling for the resignation of Kuchma and the dismissal of other key officials. He did sack the head of the SBU, Leonid Derkach, and the chief of the presidential bodyguard, Volodymyr Shepel, but refused to step down. The government invited the US FBI to investigate, though it does not appear that this offer was ever taken up. The protests were eventually forcibly broken up by the police.\n\nIn May 2001, interior minister Yuriy Smirnov announced that the murder had been solved—it was attributed to a random act of violence committed by two \"hooligans\" with links to a gangster called \"Cyclops\". Both of the killers were said to now be dead. The claim was dismissed by the opposition and by the government's own prosecutor-general, whose office issued a statement denying Smirnov's claims.\n\nMass protests again broke out in Kiev and other Ukrainian cities in September 2002 to mark the second anniversary of Gongadze's death. The demonstrators again called for Kuchma's resignation but the protests again failed to achieve their goal, with police breaking up the protesters' camp.\n\nThe prosecutor of the Tarascha district, where Gongadze's body was found, was convicted in May 2003 for abuse of office and falsification of evidence. Serhiy Obozov was found guilty of forging documents and negligence in the investigation and was sentenced to two-and-a-half years in prison. However, he was immediately released due to a provision of Ukraine's amnesty laws.\n\nIn June 2004, the government claimed that a convicted gangster identified only as \"K\" had confessed to Gongadze's murder, although there was no independent confirmation of the claim. The ongoing investigation received a setback when a key witness died of spinal injuries apparently sustained while in police custody.\n\nGongadze's death became a major issue in the 2004 Ukrainian presidential election, in which the opposition candidate Viktor Yushchenko pledged to solve the case if he became president. Yushchenko did become president following the subsequent Orange Revolution and immediately launched a new investigation, replacing the country's prosecutor-general.\n\nThe Council of Europe's Parliamentary Assembly adopted on 27 January 2009 Resolution 1645 on the investigation of crimes allegedly committed by high officials during the Kuchma rule in Ukraine – the Gongadze case as an emblematic example. This Resolution calls on the Ukrainian Prosecutor General's Office to use all possible avenues of investigation to identify those who instigated and organised the murder of Giorgiy Gongadze.\n\nOn 1 March 2005, Yushchenko announced that the journalist's suspected killers had been arrested. Prosecutor-General Svyatoslav Piskun announced the following day that the case had been solved, telling Ukrainian television that Gongadze had been strangled by employees of the Interior Ministry. Two of the alleged killers were said to be senior policemen working for the Interior Ministry's criminal investigations directorate (CID). Former Interior Minister Yuri Kravchenko, one of those recorded with Leonid Kuchma in the Cassette Scandal, was also said to be under investigation. The two police colonels accused of the killing have been detained and a third senior policeman, identified as CID commander Oleksiy Pukach, was being sought on an international arrest warrant.\n\nOn 4 March, Yuri Kravchenko was found dead in a dacha in the elite residential area of Koncha-Zaspa, outside Kiev. He had died from apparently self-inflicted gunshot wounds, though some speculated that he might have been assassinated to prevent him from testifying as a witness. Hryhory Omelchenko, who chaired the parliamentary committee that investigated the Gongadze case, told the \"New York Times\" that Kravchenko had ordered Pukach to abduct Gongadze on President Kuchma's orders. Kuchma himself has denied this allegation but has since been interviewed by investigators. Kravchenko left an alleged suicide note: “My dear ones, I am not guilty of anything. Forgive me, for I became a victim of the political intrigues of President Kuchma and his entourage. I am leaving you with a clear conscious, farewell.\"\n\nIn April/May 2005, Piskun released more details of the ongoing investigation. He told the press that after Gongadze was murdered, a second group disinterred him and re-buried him where he was eventually found, in the constituency of Socialist Party leader Oleksandr Moroz. According to Piskun, the aim was to undermine the government (led by Viktor Yushchenko when he was still Prime Minister). The second group was part of or allied with the United Social Democratic Party of Ukraine (SDPUo), a pro-oligarch grouping which had been hit hard by Yushchenko's crackdown on corruption and therefore wanted to see his government toppled. According to the journal \"Ukrayina moloda\" (14 April 2005), the SDPUo moved Gongadze in order to discredit President Leonid Kuchma and force early elections, which could have led to party leader Medvedchuk succeeding Kuchma.\n\nThe trial against the three former policemen charged with the killing of Georgiy Gongadze started on 9 January 2006. The other main suspect, ex-police officer, Oleksiy Pukach was believed to have fled abroad and therefore charged but not on trial. No-one had been charged for ordering the murder. On the day the trial started Gongadze's widow Myroslava Gongadze commented on the fact that no-one has been charged for the killing: \"They are known and they should be punished just the same as those who will be sitting in the dock today\".\n\nIn mid March 2008, the three former police officers were sentenced to prison for the actual act of murder of Gongadze. Mykola Protasov was given a sentence of 13 years, while Valeriy Kostenko and Oleksandr Popovych were each handed 12-year terms. But so far the investigations have failed to show who ordered the murder.\n\nOn 22 July 2009, Oleksiy Pukach, one of the chief suspects, was arrested in Ukraine's Zhytomyr Oblast. The former chief of the main criminal investigation department at the Ukrainian Interior Ministry's foreign surveillance unit had lived in the house of Lidia Zagorulko who had told her neighbours that Pukach was the brother of her dead husband and that he was a former sea captain. Pukach had lived there with his real second name and original documents. At first it was reported and that he had implicated senior political figures in the murder and was ready to show the place where the journalist's head was hidden, but this was denied two days after his arrest by his lawyer. According to the lawyer \"for the time being\" Pukach was not intended to provide this information to the investigators. Prosecutor General Oleksandr Medvedko refused to comment whether Pukach named those who ordered the murder or not, saying a \"secret investigation\" was underway.\n\nOn 28 July 2009, Ukrainian media reported that the remains of Gongadze's skull were found near Bila Tserkva, in a location specified by Pukach. According to the Prosecutor General's Office they did find fragments of a skull there that may belong to Gongadze.\n\nA request by Gongadze's widow, Myroslava Gongadze, to replace deputy prosecutor general Mykola Holomsha and investigator Oleksandr Kharchenko, because of their insufficient professionalism and because they were unable to withstand political pressure and speculation surrounding the case, was rejected on 30 July 2009. A request by Gongadze to replace Pukach's lawyer was also denied on 28 October 2009.\n\nOn 20 November 2009, Gongadze's mother Lesya gave consent to an examination of fragments of the skull found end-July 2009 under the condition she could take fragments of the skull for private DNA examination she plans to conduct at a private foreign laboratory after the 2010 Ukrainian presidential election. In September 2010 she stated that in her opinion, the fragments of the skull found in July 2009 had nothing to do with her son.\n\nOn 3 December 2009, Pukach's detention was extended by two months.\n\nOn 6 December 2009, Mykola Melnychenko accused Volodymyr Lytvyn of ordering the murder of Gongadze in 2000. Melnychenko offered no proof to back up the claim. A spokesperson for Lytvyn dismissed the claims as part of the 2010 Ukrainian presidential election campaign.\n\nThe Prosecutor General's Office of Ukraine plans to complete its investigation into the case of Oleksiy Pukach by the end of the summer of 2010.\n\nUkrainian Prosecutor General Oleksandr Medvedko stated on 17 June 2010 that skull fragments found near Bila Tserkva in July 2009 were those of Gongadze.\n\nOn 14 September 2010, Ukraine's Office of the Prosecutor General issued a statement stating that prosecutors had concluded that former Interior Minister Yuri Kravchenko had ordered Pukach to carry out the murder, and stating that Pukach had confessed to the murder. According to Gongadze's widow, Myroslava Gongadze, \"Kravchenko had had no grounds for such actions\", she believes that several people ordered the killing of the journalist. According to Georgiy Gongadze's mother, Lesya, the statement was an attempt by the Prosecutor General's Office to excuse itself for its inactivity. On 16 September 2010 Chairman of the Ukrainian Parliament Volodymyr Lytvyn stated that the investigation into the murder of Gongadze confirmed his innocence in this crime.\n\nPukach's trial, on allegations he strangled and beheaded Gongadze, began on 7 July 2011. It was closed to the public.\n\nOn 30 August 2011, Pukach claimed that former Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma was the one who ordered the murder. During the trial he also alleged that Kuchma's head of his Presidential Administration Volodymyr Lytvyn (at the time of the trial Chairman of the Verkhovna Rada (Ukraine's parliament) and member of the Verkhovna Rada) also ordered the murder of Gongadze.\n\nIn December 2011, the Pechersk District Court refused to accept witness testimony of Mykola Melnychenko as he has not been authorized to gather evidences for a committing crime, while conducting recordings in a cabinet of the President of Ukraine.\n\nOn 29 January 2013, Pukach was sentenced to a life imprisonment by the Pechersk District Courty of Kiev. Oleksiy Pukach also was stripped of his rank \"General of Militsiya\". The court ruled Pukach had murdered the journalist on orders from (former) Interior Minister Yuriy Kravchenko, who was seeking a career promotion.\n\nOn 9 July 2014, Gongadze's widow Myroslava withdraws her appeal against the sentence of Pukach; because (according to her lawyer Valentyna Telychenko) \"if the Court of Appeals will meet our appeal, it will be forced to simultaneously release Pukach from custody. We believe that Pukach is a killer and should serve his sentence\". Telychenko blamed former First Deputy Prosecutor General of Ukraine Renat Kuzmin for \"speculating with the Gongadze case\" that according to her led to \"exhausting Pukach length of stay in detention during the preliminary investigation\".\n\nThe General Prosecutor of Ukraine's Office cancelled its resolution to deny opening of criminal cases against former President Leonid Kuchma and other politicians within the Gongadze-case on 9 October 2010.\n\nOn 24 March 2011 Ukrainian prosecutors charged Kuchma with involvement in the murder. The decision prompted mixed reaction among the public. Former Prime Minister and the leader of the main opposition party Yulia Tymoshenko argued that Kuchma's arrest was no more than a PR stunt designed to distract people from their economic woes and prop up President Viktor Yanukovych's sagging popularity. Another theory was that Yanukovych was driven by the desire for revenge on Kuchma, who often humiliated Yanukovych and refused to use force to stop the Orange Revolution in 2004. Political analysts suggested that Yanukovych's \"display of justice\" could also be aimed at winning credit from the West, which has criticised him for usurping power and squeezing out democracy.\n\nA Ukrainian district court ordered prosecutors to drop criminal charges against Kuchma on 14 December 2011 on grounds that evidence linking him to the murder of Gongadze was insufficient. The court rejected Mel'nychenko's recordings as evidence. Gongadze's widow Myroslava Gongadze appealed against this decision one week later.\n\nFirst Deputy Prosecutor General of Ukraine Renat Kuzmin claimed 20 February 2013 that his office had collected enough evidence confirming Kuchma's responsibility for ordering Gongadze's assassination. Kuchma's reply the next day was: \"This is another banal example of a provocation, which I've heard more than enough in the past 12 years\".\n\nOn 9 July 2014 General Prosecutor of Ukraine Vitaliy Yarema stated that his Office would revisit investigations into high-profile cases \"that were dropped unlawfully\", including the cases dealing with the murder of Gongadze.\n\nGongadze was buried in the Mykola Naberezhny Church in Kiev on 22 March 2016. Gongadze had remained unburied until then, as Lesya Gongadze, the journalist's mother, has refused to have the body interred until Gongadze's head had been found. In 2009, according to the Prosecutor's General Office, the remains of his skull were found but Lesya Gongadze had refused to acknowledge that the found remains belonged to her son. Lesya Gongadze died on 30 November 2013.\n\nPresident Viktor Yushchenko awarded Gongadze the title Hero of Ukraine on 23 August 2005. Gongadze's widow Myroslava Gongadze was given the 'Star of the Hero' decoration by President Petro Poroshenko on 21 March 2014.\n\nIn June 2005 Kiev's \"Industrialnaya Street\" was renamed \"Georgy Gongadze Street\". August 2008 a monument to journalist Gongadze and all journalists killed for their professional activities was opened in Kiev in a park in \"Chervonoarmiyska street\", but Gongadze's mother, Lesya Gongadze, was against erecting a monument until the investigation is completed. She repeated her wish \"to remove the monument to Gongadze\" after a meeting with Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych on 22 June 2010, she also added her discontent with \"political forces\" holding \"PR campaigns\" regarding the Gongadze murder case.\n\nA literary token of respect for the work and courage of Gongadze is to be found in the novel for young adults, \"Fair Game: The Steps of Odessa\" (Spire Publishing, 2008, ) by James Watson. The book is dedicated to Giya Gongadze, but the theme, of a persecuted journalist and the impact of his revelations about government corruption on his football-playing daughter, Natasha, and his son Lonya, has strong similarities to Gongadze's own fate.\n\nIn Kiev and Lviv ceremonies marking the disappearance of Gongadze were held on 16 September 2010 (ten years after his disappearance).\n\nNote that the pronunciation and sometimes spelling of Gongadze's name may differ following the phonetics of different languages. The original Georgian name, pronounced \"Georgi Gongadze\" in Georgian, became Георгій Гонгадзе (\"Heorhiy Honhadze\") and sometimes Георгій or Ґія Ґонґадзе (\"Heorhiy\" or \"Giia Gongadze\") in Ukrainian, and Георгий Гонгадзе (\"Georgiy Gongadze\") in Russian. Ukrainian officials often refer to him as \"Heorhiy Honhadze\", as per the pronunciation of the letter Г (H) in Ukrainian, but not of the letter Ґ (G). This pronunciation is also used in the common dialect of southern Russia.\n\nAfter a recent linguistic reform, Ukrainians have recovered the letter Ґ (Ghe with upturn) for G, a letter which had been banned during the Soviet Union. The letter Ґ, which is now used for G and just named \"Ghe\" in Ukrainian, was re-introduced after the independence of Ukraine, instead of the letter Г (used for G and named \"Ghe\" in Russian, but now named \"He\" and used for H in Ukrainian). It had been banned by the Soviet linguistic reform of 1933 as being \"non-Ukrainian\" (possibly because the Ukrainian letter followed more closely the model of the Gamma letter of the Greek Alphabet, by not adopting the very distinctive letterform of the Russian letter \"Ghe\" used in cursive and italic styles).\n\nHence the more correct spelling of Gongadze's last name in Ukrainian (Ґонґадзе), according to the Georgian pronunciation. Some sources also refer to him as \"Georgy Gongadze\".\n\n\"as film director\"\n\n\n"}
{"id": "36422954", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36422954", "title": "Gloria Taylor (patient)", "text": "Gloria Taylor (patient)\n\nGloria Taylor (c. 1948 – October 4, 2012) was a Canadian who was an advocate of medically-assisted dying and suffered from Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), also known as Lou Gehrig's disease. Taylor began to experience the early symptoms of ALS in 2003. A neurologist diagnosed her disease in 2009.\n\nOn June 29, 2011, Taylor filed an application with the Supreme Court of British Columbia asking to be added as a plaintiff in the BC Civil Liberties Association's (BCCLA) death with dignity lawsuit. The BCCLA had filed the lawsuit in April 2011 to challenge the laws that make it a criminal offense to assist seriously and incurably ill individuals to die with dignity. The legal challenge seeks to allow seriously and incurably ill, mentally competent adults the right to receive medical assistance to hasten death under certain specific safeguards. This case is known as Carter v Canada (AG).\n\nTaylor was a postal worker, residential care worker, motorbike enthusiast and health advocate. She was born and raised in Castlegar, British Columbia and lived most of her life in Westbank, British Columbia. Her mother was a former hospice coordinator and volunteer.\n\nAfter Taylor was diagnosed with ALS, Taylor founded a Kelowna support group for people living with ALS and she was actively involved in raising money for groups that support people who are living with ALS and their caregivers.\n\nTaylor, the BCCLA, and the co-plaintiffs in the case argue that Criminal Code provisions against physician assisted-dying are unconstitutional because they deny individuals the right to have control over choices that are fundamental to their physical, emotional and psychological dignity and restrict the liberty of physicians to deliver end of life care to incurably ill patients.\n\nThe plaintiffs believe that every Canadian should have the choice to have what they consider to be a good death, including the option of a medically assisted death for seriously and incurably ill, mentally competent adults. Without a change in the law, seriously ill individuals will continue to suffer against their wishes at the end of life, without the choice and dignity that they deserve. The group argues that the prohibition of assisted dying violates Section 15 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms because it discriminates against people with degenerative diseases who have no physical means to end their lives without assistance. They also argued the ban violates their Section 7 right to life because, if they do want to end their suffering, they would have to do so earlier than they might otherwise want, before they lose the capacity to act.\n\nJustice Lynn Smith suspended her decision for one year, to allow the federal government to change the law to exempt physicians from criminal prosecution; but explicitly exempted Taylor from that suspension. The Harper government appealed the decision.\n\nTaylor’s dream of legal change for herself and all Canadians was realized in June when the B.C. Supreme Court ruled that the right to die with dignity is protected by the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, and granted Taylor a personal exemption allowing her the right to seek a physician-assisted death. The case was a major victory for choice and individual rights at the end of life.\n\nMme Justice Jo-Ann Prowse of the BC Court of Appeal on 2012 08 10 ruled against the federal government, and in favour of Taylor's personal exemption, saying that revoking Taylor's exemption would cause irreparable harm to Taylor, which outweighs the federal government's interests. This exemption allows Taylor to seek doctor-assisted suicide under certain conditions. The decision can be found here.\n\nOn October 4, 2012, Taylor died as a result of a severe infection resulting from a perforated colon. Due to the acute nature and brief course of her illness from the infection, Taylor did not need to seek the assistance of a physician to end her life. Taylor died in hospital, with her mother and a close friend by her side.\n\nThe B.C. Civil Liberties Association will be continuing with the death with dignity lawsuit, fighting to protect Taylor’s victory against government appeals. The federal government appealed the B.C. Supreme Court decision and a hearing for the B.C. Court of Appeal is scheduled for March 2013. The BCCLA and individual plaintiffs are represented by lawyers Sheila Tucker of Davis LLP and Joseph Arvay, Q.C. and Alison Latimer of Arvay Finlay.\n\n"}

The raid was approved by the King Ferdinand VI of Spain, and organized by the Marquis of Ensenada, and set in motion simultaneously across Spain on July 30, 1749.\n\nSince a royal edict by Charles II in 1695, Spanish gypsies had been restricted to certain towns. An official edict in 1717 restricted them to only 75 towns and districts, so that they would not be concentrated in any one region.\n\nThe plans for the roundup were developed in secrecy. Among the first to draw up plans was the appointed Governor of the Council of Castile, Gaspar Vázquez Tablada, Bishop of Oviedo. It was later also supported by the opinion of the Jesuit Father Francisco Rávago, confessor to Ferdinand VI, whose reply about the morality of the roundup can be summarised in his commentary that: \nThe plan entailed sending troops to the towns with gypsy settlements, each carrying sealed set of instructions, which were only to be revealed to the commanders on a date just prior to the roundup in August. The gypsy settlements were to be surrounded, and all able-bodied adult gypsy males were internally deported to forced labor in the Naval arsenals or to specified mines, prisons, or factories. The women and children were forced into clothing manufacture. Those too ill to travel would remain in military custody until well enough to travel, or until they reached a \"Christian death\". The operation was to be funded by confiscated goods and homes of the gypsies.\n\nThe mechanics of the raid varied in efficiency from town to town. The roundup in Seville, where the city gates were closed by the encircling army to prevent escape of the target, created alarm in the general public, who was ignorant of the goals. Special edicts were obtained to prevent the use of churches as asylum. The definition of who exactly was a gypsy proved to be difficult in many cases, and was prone to abuse. For example, Gypsies married to non-gypsies were often spared. Nomadic gypsies, already less frequent, proved difficult to roundup. Ultimately, nearly 9-12 thousand gypsies were detained. The latter stages of transport and housing of the detainees proved less organized.\n\nAs protests began to arise from different communities, the orders were repeatedly modified to permit the release of some gypsies, often creating confusion among the local military commanders. Gradually, further imprisonments became sporadic, and in 1763, those gypsies who still remained in forced labor were ordered to be released by the king, a process that took the better part of two years.\n\nThe \"Gran Redada\" can be viewed as one of the last attempts by the crown of Spain to \"purify\" the country of Spain by large-scale dislocation of a whole ethnic community, preceded by the Expulsion of the Jews in 1492 and the Expulsion of the Moriscos in 1609.\n\n"}
{"id": "265935", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=265935", "title": "Guangxu Emperor", "text": "Guangxu Emperor\n\nThe Guangxu Emperor (14 August 1871 – 14 November 1908), personal name Zaitian, was the eleventh emperor of the Qing dynasty, and the ninth Qing emperor to rule over China proper. His reign lasted from 1875 to 1908, but in practice he ruled, under Empress Dowager Cixi's influence, only from 1889 to 1898. He initiated the Hundred Days' Reform, but was abruptly stopped when the empress dowager launched a coup in 1898, after which he was put under house arrest until his death. His regnal name, \"Guangxu\", means \"glorious succession\".\n\nZaitian was the second son of Yixuan (Prince Chun), and his primary spouse Yehenara Wanzhen, a younger sister of Empress Dowager Cixi. On 12 January 1875, Zaitian's cousin, the Tongzhi Emperor, died without a son to succeed him. Breaking the imperial convention that a new emperor must always be of a generation after that of the previous emperor, candidates were considered from the generation of the Tongzhi Emperor. Empress Dowager Ci'an suggested choosing one of Prince Gong's sons to be the next emperor, but was overruled by her co-regent, Empress Dowager Cixi. Instead, Cixi nominated Zaitian (her nephew) and the imperial clan eventually agreed with her choice because Zaitian was younger than other adoptable children of the same generation.\n\nZaitian was named heir and successor to his late uncle, the Xianfeng Emperor, rather than his cousin and predecessor, the Tongzhi Emperor, so as to maintain the father-son succession law. He ascended to the throne at the age of four and adopted \"Guangxu\" as his regnal name, therefore he is known as the \"Guangxu Emperor\". He was adopted by Empress Dowager Ci'an and Cixi. For her part, she remained as regent under the title \"Holy Mother, Empress Dowager\" (聖母皇太后) while her co-regent Empress Dowager Ci'an was called \"Mother Empress, Empress Dowager\" (母后皇太后).\n\nBeginning in 1876, the Guangxu Emperor was taught by Weng Tonghe, who had also been involved in the disastrous upbringing of the Tongzhi Emperor yet somehow managed to be exonerated of all possible charges. Weng instilled in the Guangxu Emperor a duty of filial piety toward the Empress Dowagers Cixi and Ci'an.\n\nIn 1881, when the Guangxu Emperor was nine, Empress Dowager Ci'an died unexpectedly, leaving Empress Dowager Cixi as sole regent for the boy. In Weng's diaries during those days, Guangxu was reportedly seen with swollen eyes, had poor concentration and was seeking consolation from Weng. Weng too expressed his concern that Cixi was the one who had been suffering from chronic ill health, not Ci'an. During this time, the imperial eunuchs often abused their influence over the boy emperor. The Guangxu Emperor had also reportedly begun to hold some audiences on his own as an act of necessity.\n\nIn 1887, the Guangxu Emperor was old enough to begin to rule in his own right, but the previous year, several courtiers, including Prince Chun and Weng Tonghe, had petitioned Empress Dowager Cixi to postpone her retirement from the regency. Despite Cixi's agreement to remain as regent, by 1886 the Guangxu Emperor had begun to write comments on memorials to the throne. In the spring of 1887, he partook in his first field-plowing ceremony, and by the end of the year he had begun to rule under Cixi's supervision.\n\nEventually, in February 1889, in preparation for Cixi's retirement, the Guangxu Emperor was married. Much to the emperor's dislike, Cixi selected her niece, Jingfen, to be empress. She became known as Empress Longyu. She also selected a pair of sisters, who became Consorts Jin and Zhen, to be the emperor's concubines. The following week, with the Guangxu Emperor married, Cixi retired from the regency.\n\nEven after the Guangxu Emperor began formal rule, Empress Dowager Cixi continued to influence his decisions and actions, despite residing several months of the year at the Summer Palace. Weng Tonghe reportedly observed that while the emperor attended to day-to-day state affairs, in more difficult cases the emperor and the Grand Council sought Cixi's advice. In fact, the emperor often journeyed to the Summer Palace to pay his respects to his aunt and to discuss state affairs with her.\n\nIn March 1891, the Guangxu Emperor received the foreign ministers to China at an audience in the \"Pavilion of Purple Light\", in what is now part of Zhongnanhai, something that had also been done by the Tongzhi Emperor in 1873. That summer, under pressure from the foreign legations and in response to revolts in the Yangtze River valley that were targeting Christian missionaries, the emperor issued an edict ordering Christians to be placed under state protection.\n\nThe Guangxu Emperor, while growing up, apparently had been instilled with the importance of frugality. In 1892, he tried to implement a series of draconian measures to reduce expenditures by the Imperial Household Department, which proved to be one of his few administrative successes. But it was only a partial victory, as he had to approve higher expenditures than he would have liked to meet Cixi's needs.\n\n1894 saw the outbreak of the First Sino-Japanese War. During the war, even though the Guangxu Emperor was nominally the sovereign ruler of the Qing Empire, officials often ignored him and instead sent their memorials to Cixi for her approval. Eventually, two sets of Grand Council memoranda were created, one for the emperor and the other for the empress dowager, a practice that continued until it was rendered unnecessary by the events in the autumn of 1898. Following the Qing Empire's defeat and forced agreement to the terms of the Treaty of Shimonoseki, the Guangxu Emperor reportedly expressed his wish to abdicate. The emperor and the Qing government faced further humiliation in late 1897 when the German Empire used the murders of two priests in Shandong Province as an excuse to occupy Jiaozhou Bay, prompting a \"scramble for concessions\" by other foreign powers.\n\nFollowing the war and the scramble for concessions, the Guangxu Emperor came to believe that by learning from constitutional monarchies like Japan, the Qing Empire would become more politically and economically powerful. In June 1898, the emperor began the Hundred Days' Reform, aimed at a series of sweeping political, legal and social changes. For a brief time, after Cixi's supposed retirement, the Guangxu Emperor issued edicts for a massive number of far-reaching modernizing reforms with the help of more progressive officials such as Kang Youwei and Liang Qichao.\n\nChanges ranged from infrastructure to industry and the civil examination system. The Guangxu Emperor issued decrees allowing the establishment of a modern university in Beijing, the construction of the Lu-Han railway, and a system of budgets similar to that of Western governments. The initial goal was to make China a modern constitutional empire, but still within the traditional framework, as with Japan's Meiji Restoration.\n\nThe reforms, however, were not only too sudden for a China still under significant neo-Confucian influence and other elements of traditional culture, but also came into conflict with Cixi, who held real power. Many officials, deemed useless and dismissed by the Guangxu Emperor, begged her for help. Although Cixi did nothing to stop the Hundred Days' Reform from taking place, she knew the only way to secure her power base was to stage a military coup. The Guangxu Emperor became aware of such a plan, so he asked Kang Youwei and his reformist allies to plan his rescue. They decided to use the help of Yuan Shikai, who had a modernized army, albeit only 6,000-strong. Cixi relied on Ronglu's army in Tianjin.\n\nRonglu also had an ally, General Dong Fuxiang, who commanded 10,000 Muslim Kansu Braves, including generals such as Ma Fuxiang and Ma Fulu, stationed in the Beijing metropolitan area. Armed with more advanced firearms and artillery, they sided with Cixi's conservative faction during the coup.\n\nThe day before the staged coup was supposed to take place, Yuan Shikai revealed everything to Ronglu, exposing the Guangxu Emperor's plans. This gained Yuan Shikai the trust of Cixi, as well as the status of lifetime enemy of the Guangxu Emperor, and later the emperor's younger half-brother, Zaifeng. Following the exposure of the plot, the emperor and empress dowager met, and the emperor retreated to Yingtai Pavilion, a palace on a lake that is now part of the Zhongnanhai Compound.\n\nLei Chia-sheng (雷家聖), a Taiwanese history professor, proposes an alternative view: that the Guangxu Emperor might have been led into a trap by the reformists led by Kang Youwei, who in turn was in Lei's opinion tricked by British missionary Timothy Richard and former Japanese prime minister Itō Hirobumi into agreeing to appoint Itō as one of many foreign advisors. British ambassador Claude MacDonald said that the reformists had actually \"much injured\" the modernisation of China. According to Lei, Cixi learned of the plot and decided to put an end to it and save China from coming under foreign control.\n\nThe Guangxu Emperor's duties after 1898 became rather limited. Some have argued that the emperor was effectively removed from power as emperor (despite keeping the title), but he did retain some status.\n\nThe emperor was kept informed of state affairs, reading them with Cixi prior to audiences, and was also present at audiences, sitting on a stool to Cixi’s left hand while Cixi occupied the main throne. He discharged his ceremonial duties, such as offering sacrifices during ceremonies, but never ruled alone again.\n\nIn 1898, shortly after the collapse of the Hundred Days' Reform, the Guangxu Emperor's health began to decline, prompting Cixi to name Pujun, a son of the emperor's cousin, the reactionary Prince Duan, as heir presumptive. Pujun and his father were removed from their positions after the Boxer Rebellion. He was examined by a physician at the French Legation and diagnosed with chronic nephritis; he was also discovered to be impotent at the time.\n\nDuring the Boxer Rebellion, Emperor Guangxu fiercely opposed the idea of using usurpers as a means to counter foreign invasion. His letter to then United States president Theodore Roosevelt is still preserved in U.S. government archives. On 14 August 1900, the Guangxu Emperor, along with Cixi, Empress Longyu and some other court officials, fled from Beijing as the forces of the Eight-Nation Alliance marched on the capital to relieve the legations that had been besieged during the Boxer Rebellion.\n\nReturning to the capital in January 1902, after the withdrawal of the foreign powers, the Guangxu Emperor spent the next few years working in his isolated palace with watches and clocks, which had been a childhood fascination, some say in an effort to pass the time until Cixi's death. He also read widely and spent time learning English from Cixi's Western-educated lady-in-waiting, Yu Deling. His relationship with Empress Longyu, Cixi's niece (and the Emperor's own first cousin), also improved to some extent.\n\nThe Guangxu Emperor died on 14 November 1908, a day before Cixi's death. He was only 37. For a long time there were several theories about the emperor's death, none of them completely accepted by historians. Most were inclined to believe that Cixi, herself very ill, poisoned the Guangxu Emperor because she was afraid he would reverse her policies after her death. Another theory is that the Guangxu Emperor was poisoned by Yuan Shikai, who knew that if the emperor were to come to power again, Yuan would likely be executed for treason. There were no reliable sources to prove who murdered the Guangxu Emperor. In 1911, Cixi's former eunuch Li Lianying was murdered, possibly by Yuan, implying that they had conspired in the emperor's murder. This theory was offered by Puyi in his biography; he claimed he heard it from an old eunuch.\n\nThe medical records kept by the Guangxu Emperor's physician show the emperor suffered from \"spells of violent stomachache\", and that his face turned blue, typical symptoms of arsenic poisoning. To dispel persistent rumours that the emperor had been poisoned, the Qing imperial court produced documents and doctors' records suggesting that the Guangxu Emperor died from natural causes, but these did not allay suspicion.\n\nOn 4 November 2008, forensic tests revealed that the level of arsenic in the Guangxu Emperor's remains was 2,000 times higher than that of ordinary people. Scientists concluded that the poison could only have been administered in a high dose one time. \"China Daily\" quoted a historian, Dai Yi, who speculated that Cixi might have known of her imminent death and worried that the Guangxu Emperor would continue his reforms after her death.\n\nThe Guangxu Emperor was succeeded by Cixi's choice as heir, his nephew Puyi, who took the regnal name \"Xuantong\". The Guangxu Emperor's consort, who became Empress Dowager Longyu, signed the abdication decree as regent in 1912, ending two thousand years of imperial rule in China. Longyu died childless in 1913.\n\nAfter the Xinhai Revolution of 1911-1912, the Chinese Republic funded the construction of the Guangxu Emperor's mausoleum in the Western Qing Tombs. The tomb was robbed during the Chinese Civil War and the underground palace (burial chamber) is now open to the public.\n\nIn 1912, Sun Yat-sen praised the Guangxu Emperor for his educational reform package that allowed China to learn more about Western culture. After the establishment of the People's Republic of China in 1949, historian Fan Wenlan (范文瀾) called the Guangxu Emperor \"a Manchu noble who could accept Western ideas\". Some historians believe that the Guangxu Emperor was the first Chinese leader to implement policies of modernisation and capitalism. Imperial power in the Qing dynasty saw its nadir under Guangxu, and he was the only Qing emperor to have been put under house arrest during his own reign.\n\nsource:\n\nThe Guangxu Emperor had one empress and two consorts in total.<br>The emperor was forced by Empress Dowager Cixi to marry her niece (his cousin) Jingfen, who was two years his senior. Jingfen's father, Guixiang (Cixi's younger brother), and Cixi selected her to be the Guangxu Emperor's Empress Consort in order to strengthen the power of her own family. After the marriage, Jingfen was made empress and was granted the honorific title of \"Longyu\", meaning \"auspicious and prosperous\" () after the death of her husband. However, the Guangxu Emperor detested Empress Longyu, and spent most of his time with his favourite concubine, Consort Zhen (), (better known in English as the \"Pearl Consort\"). Rumours say that in 1900, Consort Zhen was drowned by being thrown into a well on Cixi's order after Consort Zhen begged Empress Dowager Cixi to let the Guangxu Emperor stay in Beijing for negotiations with the foreign powers. That incident happened before Empress Dowager Cixi was preparing to leave the Forbidden City due to the occupation of Beijing by the Eight-Nation Alliance in 1900. Like his predecessor, the Tongzhi Emperor, the Guangxu Emperor died without issue. After the Guangxu Emperor's death in 1908, Empress Dowager Longyu reigned in cooperation with Zaifeng (Prince Chun).\n\nIn the short alternative history story \"Foreign Devils\" by Walter Jon Williams, China is invaded by the same fearsome Martians depicted in H. G. Wells' \"War of the Worlds\". China suffers terrible death and destruction and the Emperor is forced to flee, but by the time the Martians have died off from earthly diseases, they have destroyed most of the Guangxu Emperor's human enemies. The Emperor then proceeds to eliminate his remaining foes, assume unquestioned power in China and enact his reforms, fully and unhinderd. He uses the disarray of European powers, which were also invaded by the Martians, to shake off colonial tutelage and make China a world power 50 years earlier than it did in our history. In this changed history, China remains a monarchy and there is no Chinese Republic. (The story appears in the collection \"\".)\n\nIn Victor Segalen's impressionistic novel \"René Leys\" (written in 1917 and published posthumously in 1922), the Belgian protagonist is obsessed with the Guangxu Emperor, about whom he is writing a book. The novel also describes the contemporary political life within the Forbidden City.\n\n"}

He succeeded to the marquessate on his father's death in 1826.\n\nIn the early hours of Thursday, 6 April 1837, Henry Beresford, 3rd Marquess of Waterford and his fox-hunting friends arrived in Melton Mowbray at the Thorpe End tollgate. They had been drinking heavily at Croxton races, and understandably the tollkeeper asked to be paid before he opened the gate for them. Sadly for him some repairs were underway, and ladders, brushes and pots of red paint were lying nearby; the Marquess and his cronies seized these and attacked the tollkeeper, painting him and a constable who intervened red. They then nailed up the door of the tollhouse and painted that red before moving into the town carrying the stolen equipment. They rampaged down the Beast Market (now Sherrard Street), through the Market Place, and into Burton Street, painting doors as they passed, pulling on door knockers and knocking over flower pots. At the Red Lion (now part of the Harborough Hotel), they pulled down the sign and threw it into the canal. At the Old Swan Inn in the Market Place, next to what is now the Grapes, the Marquess was hoisted onto the shoulder of another man to paint the carved swan inn sign there red. (In 1988, when the old Swan Porch fell down, traces of red paint were found on the back of the carved swan when it was removed for restoration). They also vandalised the Post Office and the Leicestershire banking company before trying to overturn a caravan in which a man was fast asleep. Solitary policemen tried to intervene at intervals and were beaten up and painted red for their trouble. Eventually more police arrived in numbers and seized one of the men, Edward Raynard, who was put in the Bridewell prison. The others promptly returned and rescued him, breaking three locks and beating two constables, threatening them with murder if they did not produce the key. The following day there was uproar; when the Marquess of Waterford finally sobered up, he paid for all the damage to people and property, but the group were still brought to trial before the Derby Assize Court in July 1838. They were found not guilty of riot, but were fined £100 each for common assault, a considerable sum then. Following the incident, the phrase \"paint the town red\" entered the language .\n\nIn the late summer of 1837, the Marquess and his entourage, took a pleasure cruise on the yacht \"Charlotte\", belonging to the Royal Yacht Squadron, to the seaport of Bergen in Norway - allegedly with the goal to reach The North Pole. According to the contemporary report in The Times, the Marquess became, together with a local girl, involved in a disorder and he was given a blow on the head by the \"morning star\" of a local watchman. The Marquess' life was in danger, but he recovered after a period at the local hospital and his conduct was tried in court. It was reported that ‘The Marquis of Waterford is fully recovered, he was tried at Bergen and sentence passed, he was absolved from the accusation and the watchman from all further prosecution, the latter is to pay the costs’ - due to the interception of the local British consul.\n\nFinally, on September the 18th, \"The Times\" duly printed a brief update of affairs stating: 'The Marquis of Waterford, who some time since received some serious injuries in what his Lordship and his friends are pleased to call a lark, at Bergen, is quite recovered, and has arrived we understand, in this country. One of the Marquis’s party arrived at Douglas’s hotel here on Tuesday, and left next day for the south. We believe the whole party arrived in the Marquis’s yacht at Aberdeen, from Norway.'\n\nA popular rumour that was in circulation as early as the 1830s claimed that Lord Waterford was the main suspect behind the \"Spring Heeled Jack\" phenomenon. However, as that character's acts continued after his death in 1859, Waterford cannot be given sole responsibility.\n\nThat Lord Waterford had some role has been accepted by several modern authors, who suggest that a humiliating experience with a woman and a police officer could have given him the idea of creating the character as a way of \"getting even\" with police and women in general. They speculate that he could have designed (with the help of friends who were experts in applied mechanics) some sort of apparatus for special spring-heeled boots, and that he may have practiced fire-spitting techniques in order to increase the unnatural appearance of his character. They also note the embroidered coat of arms with a \"W\" letter observed by the servant boy during the Ashworth incident, a notorious coincidence with his title's territorial designation.\n\nIndeed, Waterford was frequently in the news in the late 1830s for drunken brawling, brutal jokes and vandalism, and was said to do anything for a bet; his irregular behaviour and his contempt for women earned him the moniker \"the Mad Marquis\", and it is also known that he was present in the London area at the time the first Spring Heeled Jack incidents took place. He was also pointed to as the perpetrator by the Revd E. C. Brewer in 1880, who attested that Waterford \"used to amuse himself by springing on travellers unawares, to frighten them, and from time to time others have followed his silly example\".\n\nAn 1838 news report referred to \"that turbulent piece of aristocracy\" and his \"nocturnal vagaries in the neighbourhood of Melton\", adding that his \"name in many quarters is regarded with as much terror as that of Spring-heeled Jack himself\".\n\nLord Waterford was a keen horseman and in 1840 he entered two horses in the Grand National Steeplechase, regarded today as the most famous race over jumps in the world. Waterford chose to ride one of the horses, The Sea, himself but was sent off in a field of thirteen runners as a totally unconsidered outsider. Reporters noted that, at one stage during the four and a half mile contest, The Sea was almost half a mile behind the leaders, but Waterford persisted and completed the course to finish last of four to complete the course.\n\nIn 1842, Lord Waterford married Louisa Stuart, daughter of the 1st Baron Stuart de Rothesay, and settled in Curraghmore House in Ireland, where he reportedly led an exemplary life until he died in a horse riding accident in 1859. Spring Heeled Jack remained notionally active for decades after, which leads the aforementioned modern researchers to the same conclusion as Brewer's: Waterford may well have been responsible for the first attacks, while it was up to other pranksters who occasionally imitated him to continue the task.\n"}

On his return to Africa, possibly because Louis Napoleon considered him a suitable military head of a potential \"coup d'état\", an expedition took place into Little Kabylie in northern Algeria, in which Saint Arnaud showed his prowess as a commander-in-chief and provided his superiors with the pretext for bringing him home as a general of division (July 1851).\n\nHe succeeded Marshal Magnan as minister of war and superintended the military operations of the \"coup d'état\" of 2 December 1851, which placed Louis Napoleon on the throne as Emperor Napoleon III.

His eldest sibling grew up to be a historian and writer, best known under her married name as Elizabeth Pakenham, Countess of Longford.\n\nHarman went to Oundle School, where he was very left-wing. According to a classmate, Sir Cyril Clarke, he later \"became a staunch conservative, although he was nearly always anti-establishment simply for the fun of it.\" He went to St John's College, Cambridge, and then studied at St Thomas's Hospital Medical School.\n\nHarman stayed on at St Thomas's and became a consultant in 1938. He served in the RAMC during the Second World War. Later he edited St Thomas's Pharmacopoeia reference book.\n\nIn 1971, Harman took over the chairmanship of the British National Formulary and between 1975–1978 was instrumental in persuading the Department of Health and Social Security to make it the National Health Service's medicine handbook at a time when its existence was under threat.\n\nHarman retired in 1972 and took on the presidency of the Medical Defence Union.\n\nDoctor John Bodkin Adams was tried in 1957 for the murder of an 81-year-old patient, Edith Alice Morrell. Harman was called as the defence's main expert witness. He gave evidence that though the deceased was being prescribed high amounts of heroin and morphine by her general practitioner, it was entirely justified under the circumstances and that it would have done more harm to the patient if the treatment was discontinued. During cross-examination, however, it was established: that Harman had himself only ever worked as a general practitioner for a total of two weeks. He had only ever treated a handful of drug addicts – before the war. He had never seen 'spasms' caused by drug addiction, despite acting them out for the court in detail – he had only ever read about them. And furthermore, despite being a witness for the defence, he claimed he had at no time talked to Adams about his treatment of the patient.\n\nAdams was acquitted, and a second count of the murder of another patient, Gertrude Hullett, was controversially withdrawn. The prosecutor Attorney-General, Sir Reginald Manningham-Buller, entered a \"nolle prosequi\" which the presiding judge, Patrick Devlin, later termed \"an abuse of process\".\n\nAdams was subsequently successfully prosecuted on 13 lesser charges of prescription fraud, lying on cremation forms, obstructing a police search and failing to keep a dangerous drugs register. He was removed from the Medical Register in 1957 and reinstated in 1961. Home Office pathologist Francis Camps, however, suspected Adams of causing the deaths of 163 patients in total.\n\nHarman died from a dissecting aortic aneurysm, while driving his car to St Thomas's in 1994, aged 87.\n\nHis sister, Elizabeth (wife of Lord Longford), introduced him to a lawyer, Anna Spicer. They married in 1946 and had four daughters who all became solicitors. The best-known of these is Harriet Harman, the Labour politician.\n\n"}

Mary was the daughter of railroad magnate E.H. Harriman and sister to W. Averell Harriman, former New York State Governor and United States Diplomat. In 2015 she was posthumously inducted into the National Women's Hall of Fame.\n\nMary Harriman Rumsey was born on November 17, 1881, the oldest of six children of railroad industrialist E.H. Harriman (1848–1909) and his wife, Mary Averell Harriman (1851–1932).\n\nHer siblings were Henry Neilson Harriman (1883–1888), Cornelia Harriman (1884–1966), who married Robert Livingston Gerry (1877–1957), Carol Averell Harriman (1889–1948), who married R. Penn Smith in 1917. After his death in 1929, she married W. Plunket Stewart, a racing stable owner in 1930, William Averell Harriman (1891–1986), who in 1955 became the Governor of New York and who married Kitty Lanier Lawrence, then Marie Norton Whitney (1903–1970), and lastly to Pamela Beryl Digby Churchill Hayward (1920–1997), and Edward Roland Noel Harriman (1895–1978), who married Gladys Fries (1896–1983).\n\nMary attended Barnard College, where she specialized in sociology and was a member of Kappa Kappa Gamma.\n\nInspired by a lecture on the settlement movement, Mary, along with several friends, began volunteering at the College Settlement on Rivington Street in New York City's Lower East Side, a large immigrant enclave. Through her work at the College Settlement, Mary became convinced that there was more she could do to help others. Subsequently, Mary and a group of 80 debutantes established the Junior League for the Promotion of Settlement Movements in 1901, while she was still a student at Barnard College. The purpose of the Junior League would be to unite interested debutantes in joining the Settlement Movement in New York City.\n\nRealizing their lack of experience in dealing with the issues that faced people seeking help at the settlement house, Mary and League leaders brought together experts on the Settlement Movement to provide lectures and instruction to Junior League members. With better preparation came greater engagement leading to increased interest in membership by women notable in New York society; members would come to include Eleanor Roosevelt, Dorothy Whitney Straight and Ruth Draper.\n\nAs word of the work of the young Junior League women in New York spread, women throughout the country and beyond formed Junior Leagues in their communities. In time, Leagues would expand their efforts beyond settlement house work to respond to the social, health and educational issues of their respective communities. In 1921, approximately 30 Leagues banded together to form the Association of Junior Leagues of America to provide support to one another. With the creation of the Association, it was Mary that insisted that although it was important for all Leagues to learn from one another and share best practices, each League was ultimately beholden to its respective community and should thus function to serve that community’s needs.\n\nAs the 20th century progressed, more Junior Leagues were formed throughout the United States, Canada, Mexico and the United Kingdom. Now known as the Association of Junior Leagues International Inc. (AJLI), the organization encompasses 292 member Leagues, with over 160,000 members committed to continuing the legacy established by its founder.\n\nIn 1933, President Franklin D. Roosevelt appointed Mary to chair the Consumer Advisory Board (CAB) of the National Recovery Administration (NRA), the first government consumer rights group.\n\nDespite her inexperience, Mary's work with farming cooperatives and belief in the power of cooperation would come to be her greatest assets. Mary would promote the formation of consumer groups across the nation and encourage these groups to report their grievances to her office.\n\nMary Rumsey's legacy to New Deal reforms would be continued by her younger brother, W. Averell Harriman. Averell was encouraged by his older sister to leave his finance job and join her and their friends, the Roosevelts, to advance the goals of the New Deal. Averell joined the NRA, marking the beginning of his political career.\n\nIn 1910, Mary married sculptor and polo player Charles Cary Rumsey (1879–1922), shortly after the death of her father on September 9, 1909. Rumsey had been working at Arden House, creating one of the principal fireplace surrounds, as well as other decorative sculpture. By all accounts, the two had a happy marriage. Together they had a daughter and two sons.\nCharles was killed in a car accident in 1922. Mary died in 1934 as a result of a horse riding accident which occurred while on a hunt near Middleburg, Virginia.\n\n"}

Although his strip was set in the small town of Shadyside, it was obviously based on Blosser's hometown of Nappanee, Indiana, since Blosser often referenced real Nappanee locations, such as Johnson's Drug Store. Six successful cartoonists lived in Nappanee as children, including Fred Neher (\"Life’s Like That\") and Bill Holman (\"Smokey Stover\").\n\nGrowing up in Nappanee, where he was born, Blosser was encouraged by his parents to take drawing lessons, and he signed up for Charles N. Landon's correspondence course. When Blosser was 12 years old, \"National Magazine\" held a writing competition, and he was a winner with his essay, \"The Best Way to Spend $300.\" The prize was a trip to Washington, D.C.\n\nTouring the city, the prizewinners were taken to the White House to meet President Theodore Roosevelt. Lagging behind, Blosser drew a sketch of Roosevelt which prompted the President to exclaim, \"Bully!\" He then kept Blosser with him for half a day, advising him to continue in the field of art. Expelled from high school after he displayed caricatures of the high school faculty, including a drawing of the school principal as Satan, Blosser described the suspension as \"the best break I ever had.\"\n\nWhile attending Blue Ridge College in Union Bridge, Maryland, in 1911, Blosser sold drawings to the \"Frederick News\" in Frederick, Maryland. When he was 20, he quit school after selling a cartoon to the \"Baltimore American\" in 1912. Blosser studied at the Chicago Academy of Fine Arts. He did cartoons for Chicago's \"Motor-Cycling\" magazine and magazines at the Denton Publishing Company in Cleveland, and he also drew political cartoons for the \"Wheeling Register\" and \"The Plain Dealer\".\n\nLandon was also an editor at Newspaper Enterprise Association, and in May 1915, he hired Blosser to work at NEA. Blosser was 23 when he began in the NEA art department, initially doing cartoons based on news events and then drawing five daily panels. One of these, titled \"Freckles\", began as a one-column daily gag panel on August 16, expanding into a full comic strip on September 20 when it was retitled \"Freckles and His Friends\". One by one, each of the other panels were dropped.\n\nIn July 1916, Blosser started another strip, \"Miniature Movies\", which evolved into \"Chestnut Charlie\", continuing until early in 1918 when Blosser concentrated exclusively on \"Freckles and His Friends\".\n\nBlosser married shortly after he drew the earliest \"Freckles and His Friends\" strips. For years, the couple lived in Cleveland, where the NEA office was located, until they moved in 1927 to Los Angeles. During the early 1940s, they lived at 751 Masselin Avenue before moving to the Los Angeles suburb of Arcadia. Asked about his activities away from his drawing table, Blosser responded that he \"travels, swims, and lives a simple life.\" A 1945 syndicated newspaper profile of Blosser described his life in Arcadia during the 1940s:\n\nBlosser, who said he aimed for \"simply good humor,\" was influenced by cartoonist Walter Hoban (\"Jerry on the Job\"). After his first few decades of doing the strip, Blosser shared the work with Henry Formhals, who began as Blosser's assistant in 1935. Eventually, Blosser drew the Sunday strips, while Formhals, beginning in 1938, drew the daily strips. The last daily strip signed by Blosser was on February 12, 1966. Daily strips between February 14 and March 19 have Formhals' signature covered with opaque white. The March 21, 1966, daily strip is the first to carry Formhals' signature.\n\nAlthough the characters in the strip never joined up with the military during World War II, Blosser's use of the strip to promote the sale of War Bonds brought him a personal citation from Secretary of the Treasury Henry Morgenthau, Jr.\n\nIn New York in May, 1965, the National Cartoonists Society held a testimonial dinner honoring Blosser. The NCS gave him an award \"in recognition of the wholesome entertainment he has brought his myriad readers\" and for the creation of \"the oldest regular comic strip still piloted by its creator.\"\n\nThe following year, Blosser retired, and Formhals then worked alone on \"Freckles and His Friends\" from 1966 to 1971. The strip was discontinued on August 28, 1971. For most of his life, Blosser lived in Arcadia and Pasadena, California, where he died in 1983.\n\n"}

{"id": "42318629", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=42318629", "title": "Minigene", "text": "Minigene\n\nA minigene is a minimal gene fragment that includes an exon and the control regions necessary for the gene to express itself in the same way as a wild type gene fragment. This is a minigene in its most basic sense. More complex minigenes can be constructed containing multiple exons and intron(s). Minigenes provide a valuable tool for researchers evaluating splicing patterns both \"in vivo\" and \"in vitro\" biochemically assessed experiments. Specifically, minigenes are used as splice reporter vectors (also called exon-trapping vectors) and act as a probe to determine which factors are important in splicing outcomes. They can be constructed to test the way both cis-regulatory elements (RNA effects) and trans-regulatory elements (associated proteins/splicing factors) affect gene expression.\n\nMinigenes were first described as the somatic assembly of DNA segments and consisted of DNA regions known to encode the protein and the flanking regions required to express the protein. The term was first used in a paper in 1977 to describe the cloning of two minigenes that were designed to express a peptide.\n\nRNA splicing was discovered in the late 1970s through the study of adenoviruses that invade mammals and replicate inside them. Researchers identified RNA molecules that contained sequences from noncontiguous parts of the virus’s genome. This discovery led to the conclusion that regulatory mechanisms existed which affected mature RNA and the genes it expresses. Using minigenes as a splice reporting vector to explore the effects of RNA splicing regulation naturally followed and remains the major use of minigenes to date.\n\nIn order to provide a good minigene model, the gene fragment should have all of the necessary elements to ensure it exhibits the same alternative splicing (AS) patterns as the wild type gene, i.e., the length of the fragment must include all upstream and downstream sequences which can affect its splicing. Therefore, most minigene designs begin with a thorough \"in silico\" analysis of the requirements of the experiment before any \"wet\" lab work is conducted. With the advent of Bioinformatics and widespread use of computers, several good programs now exist for the identification of cis-acting control regions that affect the splicing outcomes of a gene and advanced programs can even consider splicing outcomes in various tissue types. Differences in minigenes are usually reflected in the final size of the fragment, which is in turn a reflection of the complexity of the minigene itself. The number of foreign DNA elements (exon and introns) inserted into the constitutive exons and introns of a given fragment varies with the type of experiment and the information being sought. A typical experiment might involve wild type minigenes which are expected to express genes normally in a comparison run against genetically engineered allelic variations which replace the wild-type gene and have been cloned into the same flanking sequences as the original fragment. These types of experiments help to determine the effect of various mutations on pre-mRNA splicing.\n\nOnce a suitable genomic fragment is chosen (Step 1), the exons and introns of the fragment can be inserted and amplified, along with the flanking constitutive exons and introns of the original gene, by PCR. The primers for PCR can be chosen so that they leave \"sticky ends\" at 3' sense and anti-sense strands (Step 2). These \"sticky-ends\" can be easily incorporated into a TOPO Vector by ligation into a commercially available source which has ligase already attached to it at the sight of incorporation (Step 3). The subsequent TOPO Vectors can be transfected into E.coli cells (Step 4). After incubation, total RNA can be extracted from the bacterial colonies and analyzed using RT-PCR to quantify ratios of exon inclusion/exclusion (step 5). The minigene can be transfected into different cell types with various splicing factors to test trans-acting elements (Step 6). The expressed genes or the proteins they encode can be analyzed to evaluate splicing components and their effects via a variety of methods including hybridization or size-exclusion chromatography.\n\nRNA splicing errors have been estimated to occur in a third of genetic diseases. To understand pathogenesis and identify potential targets of therapeutic intervention in these diseases, explicating the splicing elements involved is essential. Determining the complete set of components involved in splicing presents many challenges due to the abundance of alternative splicing, which occurs in most human genes, and the specificity in which splicing is carried out \"in vivo\". Splicing is distinctly conducted from cell type to cell type and across different stages of cellular development. Therefore, it is critical that any \"in vitro\" or bioinformatic assumptions about splicing regulation are confirmed \"in vivo\". Minigenes are used to elucidate \"cis\"-regulatory elements, \"trans\"-regulatory elements and other regulators of pre-mature RNA splicing \"in vivo\". Minigenes have been applied to the study of a diverse array of genetic diseases due to the aforementioned abundance of alternatively spliced genes and the specificity and variation observed in splicing regulation. The following are examples of minigene use in various diseases. While it is not an exhaustive list, it does provide a better understanding of how minigenes are utilized.\n\nRNA splicing errors can have drastic effects on how proteins function, including the hormones secreted by the endocrine system. These effects on hormones have been identified as the cause of many endocrine disorders including thyroid-related pathological conditions, rickets, hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia and congenital adrenal hyperplasia. One specific example of a splicing error causing an endocrine disease that has been studied using minigenes is a type of growth hormone deficiency called isolated growth hormone deficiency (IGHD), a disease that results in growth failure. IGHD type II is an autosomal dominant form caused by a mutation in the intervening sequence (IVS) adjacent to exon 3 of the gene encoding growth hormone 1, the GH-1 gene. This mutated form of IVS3 causes exon 3 to be skipped in the mRNA product. The mRNA (-E3) encodes a truncated form of hGH that then inhibits normal hGH secretion. Minigenes were used to determine that a point mutation within an intron splice enhancer (ISE) embedded in IVS3 was to blame for the skipping of E3. Moreover, it was determined that the function of the ISE is influenced by a nearby transposable AC element, revealing that this particular splicing error is caused by a trans-acting factor.\n\nAccumulation of tau protein is associated with neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases as well as other tauopathies. Tau protein isoforms are created by alternative splicing of exons 2, 3 and 10. The regulation of tau splicing is specific to stage of development, physiology and location. Errors in tau splicing can occur in both exons and introns and, depending on the error, result in changes to protein structure or loss of function. Aggregation of these abnormal tau proteins correlates directly with pathogenesis and disease progression. Minigenes have been used by several researchers to help understand the regulatory components responsible for mRNA splicing of the TAU gene.\n\nCancer is a complex, heterogeneous disease that can be hereditary or the result of environmental stimuli. Minigenes are used to help oncologists understand the roles pre-mRNA splicing plays in different cancer types. Of particular interest are cancer specific genetic mutations that disrupt normal splicing events, including those affecting spliceosome components and RNA-binding proteins such as heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoparticules (hnRNP), serine/arginine-rich (SR) proteins and small ribonucleoproteins (snRNP). Proteins encoded by aberrantly spliced pre-mRNAs are functionally different and contribute to the characteristic anomalies exhibited by cancer cells, including their ability to proliferate, invade and undergo angiogenesis, and metastasis. Minigenes help researchers identify genetic mutations in cancer that result in splicing errors and determine the downstream effects those splicing errors have on gene expression. Using knowledge obtained from studies employing minigenes, oncologists have proposed tests designed to detect products of abnormal gene expression for diagnostic purposes. Additionally, the prospect of using minigenes as a cancer immunotherapy is being explored.\n\n\n\n"}

United States and Jordanian officials said that the crash was caused by mechanical problems, while ISIL claimed that the plane was hit by a heat-seeking missile.\n\nISIL held al-Kasasbeh captive before killing him in early January 2015. It then conducted negotiations with the Jordanian government, claiming it would spare al-Kasabeh's life and free Japanese journalist Kenji Goto in exchange for Sajida al-Rishawi, a woman sentenced to death by Jordan for attempted terrorism and possessing explosives. After the Jordanian government insisted on freeing al-Kasasbeh as part of the deal and showing proof that he was alive before it would exchange al-Rishawi, ISIS released a video on 3 February 2015 showing al-Kasasbeh being burned to death while trapped inside a cage.\n\nAl-Kasasbeh's killing provoked widespread outrage in Jordan, and condemnation by leading figures of the Islamic world and subsequently led the Jordanian government to execute two Iraqi militants on death row in retaliation over the killing. In retaliation, King Abdullah ordered Operation Martyr Muath, a series of airstrikes that killed a number of ISIL militants over the course of three days.\n\nAl-Kasasbeh was one of eight children, including an elder brother, Jawdat Safi al-Kasasbeh, born to Issaf and Safi Yousef al-Kasasbeh, a retired education professor, in Al Karak, Jordan. He was a Sunni Muslim. The Al-Kasasbehs are a prominent Jordanian family of the influential Sunni Muslim Bararsheh tribe from southern Jordan. His uncle, Fahed al-Kasasbeh, was a Major General in the Royal Jordanian Army.\n\nAl-Kasasbeh married engineer Anwar al-Tarawneh in September 2014. Prior to his capture, al-Kasasbeh lived in the village of Ay in the Karak Mountains in Karak Governorate, south of Amman.\n\nIn 2009, al-Kasasbeh graduated from the King Hussein Air College and joined the Royal Jordanian Air Force. He completed his F-16 training in The Royal Jordanian Air Force, By 2012 he qualified as an operational F-16 pilot and was assigned to No. 1 Squadron at Muwaffaq Salti Air Base.\n\nAt the time of his capture, al-Kasasbeh was a First Lieutenant. He was posthumously promoted to the rank of Captain.\n\nThe plane al-Kasasbeh was piloting, a Lockheed Martin F-16 formerly used by the Royal Belgian Air Force, crashed after suffering from mechanical problems on 24 December 2014 during a bombing raid on a brick factory during the military intervention against the Islamic State. The Jordanian government said a technical failure caused him to eject after flying at low altitude, but the Islamic State claimed it shot down his aircraft. He ejected and parachuted into a lake near Raqqa, Syria. He was quickly captured by Islamic State militants and pulled from the water. US officials state they initiated a search and rescue mission, but they did not locate him before he was captured. On 30 December 2014, al-Kasasbeh appeared in a detailed interview with ISIS's Dabiq magazine.\n\nUnsuccessful negotiations took place for his release. His family applied pressure on the Jordanian government to arrange for his release. Originally, it was proposed to trade him and a kidnapped Japanese journalist, Kenji Goto, for Sajida al-Rishawi, a failed Iraqi suicide bomber incarcerated in Jordan since she took part in the 2005 Amman hotel bombings, and sentenced to death. The Jordanian government insisted on proof that al-Kasasbeh was still alive before it could proceed with a swap. The Islamic State refused and published the video of his killing. Some analysts have assessed IS's offer of prisoner exchange as a gimmick that was meant to put into disrepute or mock the commitment of the Jordanian government to the military intervention against it. There have also been suggestions that the proposal was a tactic intended to free its valued member in exchange for a corpse.\n\nA military operation to free al-Kasasbeh, possibly by Jordanian special forces, may have been made on 1 January 2015. Members of an anti-IS group in Raqqa, named Raqqa Is Being Slaughtered Silently, said they witnessed coalition jets bombing targets in Raqqa in some of the fiercest strikes of the anti-IS campaign, while four helicopters dropped off soldiers wearing purported Jordanian Army uniforms. The mission was aborted when IS fighters in the area began firing anti-aircraft missiles at the helicopters, forcing a retreat.\n\nISIS supporters used the Arabic hashtag #SuggestAWayToKillTheJordanianPilotPig on Twitter, crowdsourcing and publicizing their execution of al-Kasasbeh. A film released by the group showed al-Kasasbeh was burned to death by ISIS members in January 2015. His killing was recorded on video and shown near the end of a 22-minute \"snuff film\" entitled \"Healing the Believers' Chests\", credited to the ISIS official Al Furqan Media Foundation and distributed via a Twitter account known as a source for IS propaganda, and on video-sharing sites.\n\nThe video shows him with a black left eye, first at a table and then confined in a black steel cage outdoors and dressed in an orange jumpsuit before an ISIL militant sets alight a trail doused in gasoline leading towards the cage. He was burned alive while numerous armed ISIL fighters in sand-colored balaclavas and desert-style camouflage watched on from a distance. A truck finally extinguishes the fire by dumping rocks and sand on it.\n\nBefore he was burned to death, al-Kasasbeh was made to reveal the names and workplaces of a number of his fellow Royal Jordanian Air Force pilots. Their names and photographs were displayed at the end of the video, with an ISIS bounty offer of 100 gold dinars (approximately $20,000) for each Jordanian Air Force pilot killed.\n\nMost Western media outlets refused to show the full video, sometimes describing it or showing images immediately preceding al-Kasasbeh's immolation. Fox News posted the complete video on its website.\n\nThe Jordanian government assessed that al-Kasasbeh was killed by burning on 3 January, rather than 3 February, when the video was released on Twitter. This confirmed that the ISIS never intended to exchange him for al-Rishawi. Other news reports suggest that he may have been killed a few days later, on 8 January, according to a tweet posted by a Syrian activist from Raqqa that day claiming he saw individuals from ISIS celebrating the death of al-Kasasbeh on 8 January. It was reported that al-Kasasbeh was deprived of food beginning five days before he was killed.\n\nOn 25 February 2015, al-l'tisam, a media arm of ISIS, released a video entitled \"Message to Jordan\". It showed new excerpts from the video of al-Kasasbeh's burning.\n\nAccording to a former ISIS militant, senior ISIS leader Abu Mohammed al-Adnani personally burned al-Kasasbeh alive.\n\n Al-Kasasbeh's killing provoked outrage in Jordan; even some of those who had been opposed to the country's participation in airstrikes against IS started demanding revenge.\n\nKing Abdullah II cut short a visit to the United States, and the Jordanian government announced that all prisoners in its custody who had been convicted of association with IS would be executed \"within hours\" in retaliation for Al-Kasasbeh's killing. In further response, Mamdouh al-Ameri, a Jordanian military spokesman, said: \"While the military forces mourn the martyr, they emphasize his blood will not be shed in vain. The revenge will be as big as the calamity that has hit Jordan.\"\n\nOn 4 February 2015, al-Rishawi and another Iraqi jihadist who was also on death row, Ziad Khalaf al-Karbouly, were executed by hanging in Swaqa Prison, expedited in response to Al-Kasasbeh's death.\n\nLater on 4 February, Jordan launched its first military response to al-Kasasbeh's killing. Jordanian warplanes bombed IS positions in Mosul, killing 55 IS fighters, including a senior commander. The following day, Jordan launched airstrikes against IS weapons and munition warehouses and training camps. According to U.S. officials, the attacks took place near Raqqa and involved 20 Jordanian F-16s, and American refueling and radio jamming aircraft assisted. After the jets completed their mission, they overflew al-Kasasbeh's hometown of Karak while on their way back to base. The Jordan Radio and Television Corporation aired footage shot prior to those attacks, of pilots scribbling messages onto bombs slated to be used in the strikes. \"For you, the enemies of Islam,\" read one message. Others bore verses from the Quran. In 3 days of bombardment, Jordanian fighter jets destroyed 56 ISIS targets and killed dozens of ISIS fighters.\n\nSeveral clerics, leading figures of the Islamic world and news outlets roundly condemned the killing as murder. However, IS said it could be justified through Islamic law, despite cremation being illegal per Islamic law.\n\nThe Jordanian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood, the Islamic Action Front, condemned the killing of al-Kasasbeh. Their statement described it as a \"crime\", without mentioning ISIS. The IAF's leader, Sheikh Hammam Saïd, in a 5 February interview with Radio Sawa, asked Jordan to withdraw from the anti-ISIS coalition, saying \"Jordan should not be part of a coalition run by the United States.\"\n\nSheikh Salam Salameh, a Hamas member of the Palestinian Legislative Council (PLC), said \"IS members are, in one way or another, considered Muslims and we must not stand with the enemies of Allah against the people of Allah (the IS).\" He added, \"Jordan is the reason for al-Kasasbeh having been burned. It was the Jordanian government's decision to send its army into Syria to assist the [Syrian] government against the rebels in their war, in which it [Jordan] has no interest. It should have adopted a similar position to Turkey.\"\n"}

He later went to business school, and was also an active gymnast.\n\nBurud bought a share post in Kiwi in 1991, when the chain had eight stores. During Burud's time in charge of the grocery chain it has expanded, and by 2008 had almost quadrupled the number of employees and stores, and increased revenues six-fold. In 2007 the chain had 413 stores. In 2011 the chain had 450 stores, 8,000 employees and the company had a turnover of NOK 20 billion.\n\nBurud was known for his use of inventive marketing campaigns. In 2000, Burud started a campaign in which the chain gave away every fifth pack of diapers for free. The agreement was the start of a fierce price competition in the Norwegian market for diapers. At the same time a campaign started in which the stores promised the customer the item for free if they discovered items that had reached their expiration date. In 2007, Burud launched a campaign against the value added tax on fruit and vegetables, in which the group covered the VAT on 14 percent of all fresh fruits and vegetables, and he challenged the authorities to make the tax cut permanent.\n\nOn 13 July 2011, Burud was reported missing after a boating accident outside Tjøme, where his wife was confirmed dead. The police declared on the evening of 13 July that they assumed Burud was dead. After several days of intensive search, on 21 July the body of a man was found in the area where Burud went missing.

{"id": "1514713", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1514713", "title": "Premature convergence", "text": "Premature convergence\n\nIn genetic algorithms, the term of premature convergence means that a population for an optimization problem converged too early, resulting in being suboptimal. In this context, the parental solutions, through the aid of genetic operators, are not able to generate offspring that are superior to, or outperform, their parents. Premature convergence is a common problem found in genetic algorithms, as it leads to a loss, or convergence of, a large number of alleles, subsequently making it very difficult to search for a specific gene in which the alleles were present. An allele is considered lost if in a population a gene is present where all individuals are sharing the same value for that particular gene. An allele is, as defined by De Jong, considered to be a converged allele, when 95% of a population share the same value for a certain gene (see also convergence).\n\nStrategies to regain genetic variation can be:\n\nThe genetic variation can also be regained by mutation though this process is highly random.\n\nIt is hard to determine when premature convergence has occurred, and it is equally hard to predict its presence in the future. One measure is to use the difference between the average and maximum fitness values, as used by Patnaik & Srinivas, to then vary the crossover and mutation probabilities. Population diversity is another measure which has been extensively used in studies to measure premature convergence. However, although it has been widely accepted that a decrease in the population diversity directly leads to premature convergence, there have been little studies done on the analysis of population diversity. In other words, by using the term population diversity, the argument for a study in preventing premature convergence lacks robustness, unless specified what their definition of population diversity is. \n\nThere are a number of presumed or hypothesized causes for the occurrence of premature convergence.\n\nRechenberg introduced the idea of self-adaptation of mutation distributions in evolutionary strategies. According to Rechenberg, the control parameters for these mutation distributions evolved internally through self-adaptation, rather than predetermination. He called it the \"1/5-succes rule of evolutionary strategies\" (1 + 1)-ES: The step size control parameter would be increased by some factor if the relative frequency of positive mutations through a determined period of time is larger than 1/5, vice versa if it is smaller than 1/5. Self-adaptive mutations may very well be one of the causes for premature convergence. Accurately locating of optima can be enhanced by self-adaptive mutation, as well as accelerating the search for this optima. This has been widely recognized, though the mechanism’s underpinnings of this have been poorly studied, as it is often unclear whether the optima is found locally or globally. Self-adaptive methods can cause global convergence to global optimum, provided that the selection methods used are using elitism, as well as that the rule of self-adaptation doesn’t interfere with the mutation distribution, which has the property of ensuring a positive minimum probability when hitting a random subset. This is for non-convex objective functions with sets that include bounded lower levels of non-zero measurements. A study by Günter suggests that self-adaption mechanisms among elitist evolutionary strategies do resemble the 1/5-succes rule, and could very well get caught by a local optimum that include a positive probability. \n\n"}
{"id": "7768768", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7768768", "title": "Primary Life Support System", "text": "Primary Life Support System\n\nA Primary (or Portable or Personal) Life Support System (or Subsystem) (PLSS), is a device connected to an astronaut or cosmonaut's spacesuit, which allows extra-vehicular activity with maximum freedom, independent of a spacecraft's life support system. The PLSS is generally worn like a backpack. The functions performed by the PLSS include:\n\nThe air handling function of a PLSS is similar to that of a diving rebreather, in that exhaled gases are recycled into the breathing gas in a closed loop.\n\nWhen used in a microgravity environment, a separate propulsion system is generally needed for safety and control, since there is no physical connection to a spacecraft.\n\nThe Portable Life Support System used in the Apollo lunar landing missions used lithium hydroxide to remove the carbon dioxide from the breathing air, and circulated water in an open loop through a Liquid Cooled Garment, expelling the water into space, where it turned to ice crystals. Some of the water was also used to remove excess heat from the astronaut's breathing air, and collected for dumping into the spacecraft's wastewater tank after an EVA. The PLSS also contained a radio transceiver and antenna for communications, which were relayed through the spacecraft's communication system to Earth. PLSS controls were provided in the Remote Control Unit (RCU) mounted on the astronaut's chest. Oxygen and water were rechargeable for multiple EVA's from the spacecraft's environmental control system.\n\nLunar surface EVA times for the first four missions (Apollo 11 through 14) were limited to 4 hours, with oxygen stored at , of lithium hydroxide, 8.5 pounds (3.9 liters) of cooling water, and a 279 watt-hour battery. For the extended missions of Apollo 15 through 17, the EVA stay time was doubled to 8 hours by increasing oxygen to , lithium hydroxide to , cooling water to 11.5 pounds (5.2 liters), and battery capacity to 390 watt-hours.\n\nAn emergency backup was provided in case the main system failed, by a separate unit called the Oxygen Purge System (OPS), mounted on top of the PLSS, immediately behind the astronaut's helmet.\nThe OPS maintained suit pressure and removed carbon dioxide, heat and water vapor through a continuous, one-way air flow vented to space. \nWhen activated, the OPS provided oxygen to a separate inlet on the pressure suit, once a vent valve on a separate suit outlet was manually opened. The OPS provided a maximum of about 30 minutes of emergency oxygen for breathing and cooling. This could be extended to 75 to 90 minutes with a \"buddy system\" hose that used the other astronaut's functional PLSS for cooling (only). This allowed the vent valve to be partly closed to decrease the oxygen flow rate.\n\nThe PLSS was high, wide, and deep. It was tested at the Houston Flight Center by James P. Lucas, working for Hamilton Standard and by various astronauts in neutral buoyancy tanks at Dallas. It was tested in space for the first time by Russell Schweickart in a stand-up EVA in Earth orbit on Apollo 9. His PLSS weighed on Earth, which translated to a weight of only 14 lb (equivalent to the Earth weight of ) on the Moon. The OPS weighed on Earth (6.8 lb (equivalent to the Earth weight of ) on the Moon).\n\nThe OPS was also used as a backup on tethered in-space EVAs where a spacecraft provided oxygen to the astronaut through an umbilical hose.\n\nSimilar systems have been used by Space Shuttle astronauts, and are currently used by International Space Station crews.\n\nThe Primary Life Support System for the EMU suit used on the Space Shuttle and International Space Station is manufactured by Hamilton Sundstrand. It is mounted to the back of the Hard Upper Torso (HUT) assembly.\n\nOxygen (O), carbon dioxide (CO) and water vapor are drawn from the extremities of the suit by the Liquid Cooling and Ventilation Garment or LCVG, which sends the gas to the PLSS. When gas enters the PLSS, activated charcoal removes odors and lithium hydroxide (LiOH) removes carbon dioxide. Next, the gas passes through a fan which maintains a flow rate of about six cubic feet per minute. A sublimator then condenses water vapor, which is removed by a \"slurper\" and a rotary separator. The removed water is stored and used to supplement the water supply used in the LCVG. The sublimator also cools the remaining oxygen to about 55 °F (~12.8 °C). A flow sensor monitors the flow rate.\n\nExtra oxygen is added to the flow from a storage tank as necessary, downstream of the flow sensor. The oxygen is then returned to the suit at the back of the head, where it flows down over the astronaut's face. By delivering oxygen to the helmet and drawing gas from the extremities, the suit is designed to ensure that the suit occupant breathes the freshest oxygen possible.\n\nThe operating pressure of the suit is maintained at during extravehicular operations, and relative to external pressure while in intravehicular mode, i.e., before and after extra-vehicular activity (EVA).\n\nTechnologies being considered for application in future PLSSs include Pressure Swing Adsorption (PSA), a process by which CO can be separated from gas more efficiently, and through a repeatable process, as opposed to the current LiOH canisters, which become saturated with each use, and are limited to around 8 hours. By regenenerating the sorbent during EVA, the size and weight of the sorbent canister can be greatly reduced. PSA accomplishes this by venting CO and water vapor into space.\n\n"}
{"id": "824196", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=824196", "title": "Red Guardian", "text": "Red Guardian\n\nThe Red Guardian (Russian: Красный страж, \"Krasnij Straj\") is the name of several fictional superheroes appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The Red Guardian is an identity that was created as the Soviet equivalent of Captain America; since the fall of the Soviet Union, the name is no longer officially used, though at least two people have claimed the name.\n\nMany people have taken up the mantle of Red Guardian:\n\nAleksey Lebedev, the Golden Age version of Red Guardian, first appeared in \"Namor, The Sub-Mariner Annual\" #1. Very little is known of him, but he fought alongside Captain America (William Naslund) and the Sub-Mariner at the Potsdam Conference, in July, 1945. He began his career during World War II and met the All-Winners Squad (formerly the Invaders) on only one recorded occasion, shortly after the war's end. Like the other crusaders of the same name, he was created as a Soviet counterpart to Captain America. He was later apparently killed during the purges of the 1950s, opposing the brutal experiments that would later create his successor.\n\nAlexei Alanovich Shostakov was the second version of Red Guardian, and was created by Roy Thomas and John Buscema.\n\nAlexei Shostakov was born in Moscow, and was the husband of Natasha Romanova. Both he and his wife became agents of the Soviets: the latter became the Black Widow while the former became a test pilot and KGB agent and then trained as a Soviet counterpart to Captain America as the \"Red Guardian\".\n\nAlexei Shostakov was one of the Soviet Union's most acclaimed pilots. During World War II on the Eastern Front, he shot down a large number of Luftwaffe fighter planes in aerial battles and was credited for helping the Soviet Air Force win air supremacy over the skies of Stalingrad and Kursk. Because of his extraordinary skill, Shostakov was chosen for the most secret and dangerous tests and new aircraft for the Soviet Union. This included being the first pilot to test fly the Mig 15. The Soviet state controlled news media greatly publicized this and certain other missions of his such as his aerial battles against the U.S. Air Force over MiG Alley during the Korean War. As a result, Shostakov was decorated as a hero of the Soviet Union. Shostakov was also successful in his private life, having married the equally famous ballerina Natalie (familiarly known as Natasha) Romanova.\n\nAs the Cold War flared up in the 1950s, Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev realized that the Soviet Union needed its own equivalent to Captain America. Khrushchev chose Alexi Shostakov over Yuri Gagarin who would later become the first man in space. The KGB faked his death and trained him in secret, keeping his survival a secret from Natasha. He became a master of hand-to-hand combat and a highly skilled athlete. In addition, he carried a throwing disc on his belt which could be used against an opponent. Magnetic force returned the disc after throwing. The disc had the yellow hammer and sickle symbol on it and his costume was red with a star on his chest to symbolise the Soviet flag. While the Black Widow became disillusioned with her KGB masters and defected to the United States, the Red Guardian remained loyal and became more ruthless and vindictive. The Red Guardian battled the Avengers with his Chinese ally Colonel Ling, to protect a Communist Chinese secret weapon located at a secret military base at an unrevealed location in the People's Republic of China, encountering the Black Widow and Captain America (Steve Rogers). When the Black Widow noticed \"something familiar\" about him, he revealed his identity to her. He was shot and mortally wounded minutes later by Colonel Ling while saving the lives of the Black Widow and Captain America. He was buried under molten lava when the laser blast caused the eruption of a long-dormant volcano.\n\nSome time later, a Life Model Decoy was patterned after Shostakov. It was destroyed in its first battle with the Black Widow.\n\nShostakov was much later revealed to be alive and had risen very high up in power within Bulgaria as Ronin. He became responsible for a plot to capture Natasha and try his former wife for crimes as a Soviet super soldier. Natasha foiled his plan with the help of Daredevil and the Avengers.\n\nDr. Tania Belinsky, a neurosurgeon from the USSR, later adopted the costumed identity of Red Guardian and joined the Defenders. Created by Steve Gerber and Sal Buscema, she first appeared in \"Defenders\" #35 (May 1976).\nRed Guardian first appeared in \"Captain America\" #352-353 (April–May 1989), and was created by Mark Gruenwald and Kieron Dwyer.\n\nThe character subsequently appears in \"Avengers\" #319-324 (July–October 1990), \"Incredible Hulk\" #393 (May 1992), and \"Soviet Super-Soldiers\" #1 (November 1992). The character subsequently appears as the Steel Guardian in \"Iron Man\" #9 (October 1998).\n\nRed Guardian appeared as part of the \"Supreme Soviets\" entry in the \"Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Update '89\" #7.\n\nThe fourth Red Guardian, Josef Petkus, was a special operative for the intelligence agencies of the Soviet Union, and appeared as a member of the militant Supreme Soviets. Alongside the Supreme Soviets, he attacked the Soviet Super-Soldiers for defecting from the Soviet Union. Alongside Captain America, he later battled a bear-like creature composed of the Darkforce. The Supreme Soviets were later renamed the post-Soviet Russian super-team called the Winter Guard. Alongside this confederacy, he teamed with the Avengers and Alpha Flight to battle the Peace Corpse, the Atlantean Army, and the Combine. Petkus later joined a Winter Guard splinter group called the People's Protectorate, now calling himself the \"Steel Guardian\". When he and his team went off in search of the timelord Immortus hoping to find a way to resurrect Vanguards sister Lanyia. They agreed to fighting off Dire Wraiths invading his realm in exchange for this favor, Joseph being killed while in the line of duty.\nA fifth Red Guardian, Krassno Granitsky, appeared in \"Maverick\" #10. He teamed up with the mercenary superhero Maverick to battle a crime lord.\n\nThe name \"Krassno Granitsky\" comes from the James Bond novel, \"From Russia With Love\"; it is the Russianized name of the assassin Donovan \"Red\" Grant. He also appeared in the first issue of Ed Brubaker's \"Captain America\", where he was executed by Aleksander Lukin.\n\nThe sixth Red Guardian, Anton, made his first appearance in the first issue of Jeph Loeb's \"Hulk\" series as a member of the Winter Guard. Anton claims to be an engineer and a former Crimson Dynamo pilot, and was later revealed to be (at least partially) a Life Model Decoy.\nHe was decapitated by a Dire Wraith, although his head was kept in storage, seemingly still alive.\n\nNicolai Krylenko, also known as Vanguard, is the seventh Red Guardian, and leads the Winter Guard.\n\nNone of the Red Guardians have been revealed to possess superhuman powers or abilities, with the exception of Tania Belinsky after her mutation by the Presence, the Ultimate version, the seventh Red Guardian, and Krylenko. All are highly skilled athletes. Shostakov was an expert pilot, a master hand-to-hand combatant, and was trained in espionage techniques by the KGB. All of the Guardians but Alexei and Tania have used a Steel shield similar to that used by Captain America. Alexei and Tania used a \"belt-buckle\" disc, a hurling weapon which magnetically returned to the wearer's hand when thrown, and was a part of their costume's belt buckle. The fourth Red Guardian; Josef Petkus often employed an energized sword as a secondary armament alongside his shield. The sixth Red Guardian was an LMD named Anton, whose powers are cybernetic based. His falsified backstory was that he's an expert engineer and former Crimson Dynamo pilot, his real strength lies in his moderate degree of enhanced cybernetic physicality. The latest Red Guardian is Nikolai Krylenko/Vanguard, brother to Laynia Petrovna; whose powers are derived from his mutation. Which stems to a fullbody force field that repels electromagnetic and kinetic energy, forces he can best guide and direct through a medium like the technically advanced Vibranium Shield supplied to him by Central Command. Or through a crux like the symbol of his home country; A sickle and hammer. He also directs this force against the earth itself to obtain flight. Nikolai wears a more advanced suit than previous Red Guardians, which is lined with circuitry that works in conjunction with the compact computer on his shield. Not only enabling the guided flight and return of which through their digital connection, but the amplification of the effects of his own energy field.\n\nIn one of the \"Exiles\" realities, a Red Guardian in full body armor on Earth-3470 appears.\n\nRed Guardian was seen as a member of the Soviet Super Soldiers.\n\nA Red Guardian is seen as one of the many zombies roaming New York looking for victims.\n\nThe Ultimate Marvel version of Alexei Shostakov is a Russian super soldier codenamed \"Captain Russia\" meant to be the Russian version of Captain America. This version is certifiably insane and uses a makeshift shield created partially from human remains, and possesses superhuman strength and durability. A fight between the two results in Captain America defeating him, by stabbing him with splintered wood that acts as a stake through the chest, declaring \"Fighting is about winning\". Shostakov was once married to Black Widow and is now deceased. \n\nColonel Abdul al-Rahman from Azerbaijan (leader of the \"Liberators\") was based on the Red Guardian as the character was a parallel to Captain America, and wears a predominantly red costume and was transformed into a super-soldier by Russian scientists. He faces off against Steve Rogers in front of the White House, one on one but is defeated when the Hulk throws his shield to sever his hands and Rogers kills him with his weapon, resembling a double bladed lightsaber. His body is later taken into S.H.I.E.L.D..\n\nIn the \"Bullet Points\" reality, Alexi Shostakov was shown as many of the heroes stopping Galactus.\n\nA version of Red Guardian appears in the \"Avengers Assemble\" episode \"Secret Avengers,\" voiced by Troy Baker in a Russian accent. He appears as a member of the Winter Guard. A misunderstanding between the Secret Avengers and the Winter Guard over a power source (which turned out to be the Russian Radioactive Man) incited a fight between them, Red Guardian and the Winter Guard ended up working with Captain America's group when the destabilizing Russian facility they were in was about to endanger a nearby village. Afterwards, Red Guardian is the one who explained to Captain America's group that the Winter Guard are Russia's superhero team and that they work for Central Command (which is the Russian counterpart of S.H.I.E.L.D.).\n\n"}

It includes the culture that the individual was educated or lives in, and the people and institutions with whom they interact.\n\nThe physical and social environment is a determining factor in active and healthy aging in place, being a central factor in the study of environmental gerontology.\n\nThe interaction may be in person or through communication media, even anonymous or one-way, and may not imply equality of social status. Therefore, the social environment is a broader concept than that of social class or social circle.\n\nPeople with the same social environment often develop a sense of social solidarity; people often tend to trust and help one another, and to congregate in social groups. They will often think in similar styles and patterns even when their conclusions differ.\n\nIn order to enrich their lives, people have used natural resources and in the process have brought about many changes in the natural environment. Human settlements, roads, farmlands, dams and many other things have all developed through this. All these man-made components are included in our cultural environment, Erving Goffman in particular stressing the deeply social nature of the individual environment.\n\nC. Wright Mills contrasted the immediate milieu of jobs/family/neighbourhood with the wider formations of the social structure, highlighting in particular a distinction between \"the personal troubles of milieu\" and the \"public crises of social structure\".\n\nEmile Durkheim took a wider view of the social environment (\"milieu social\"), arguing that it contained internalised norms and representations of social forces/social facts: \"Our whole social environment seems to be filled with forces which really exist only in our own minds\" – collective representations.\n\nPhenomenologists contrast two alternative visions of society, as a deterministic constraint (\"milieu\") and as a nurturing shell (\"ambiance\").\n\nMax Scheler distinguishes between milieu as an experienced value-world, and the objective social environment on which we draw to create the former, noting that the social environment can either foster or restrain our creation of a personal milieu.\n\nPierre Janet saw neurosis as in part the product of the identified patient's social environment – family, social network, work etc. – and considered that in some instances what he called \"social surgery\" to create more space in that environment would be a beneficial measure.\n\nSimilar ideas have since been taken up in community psychiatry and family therapy.\n\n\n"}

This may involve similarity, love, romance, platonic relationships, comfort, intimacy, sexuality, sexual activity, spirituality, compatibility and trust.\n\nIn his dialogue \"The Symposium\", Plato has Aristophanes present a story about soulmates. Aristophanes states that humans originally had four arms, four legs, and a single head made of two faces. He continues that there were three genders: man, woman and the \"Androgynous\", each with two sets of genitalia with the Androgynous having both male and female genitalia. The men were children of the sun, the women were children of the earth and the Androgynous were children of the moon, which was born of the sun and earth. It is said that humans had great strength at the time and threatened to conquer the gods. The gods were then faced with the prospect of destroying the humans with lightning as they had done with the Titans but then they would lose the tributes given to the gods by humans. Zeus developed a creative solution by splitting humans in half as punishment for humanity's pride and doubling the number of humans who would give tribute to the gods. These split humans were in utter misery to the point where they would not eat and would perish so Apollo had sewn them up and reconstituted their bodies with the navel being the only remnant harkening back to their original form. Each human would then only have one set of genitalia and would forever long for his/her other half; the other half of his/her soul. It is said that when the two find each other, there is an unspoken understanding of one another, that they feel unified and would lie with each other in unity and would know no greater joy than that.\n\nAccording to Theosophy, whose claims were modified by Edgar Cayce, God created androgynous souls—equally male and female. Later theories postulate that the souls split into separate genders, perhaps because they incurred karma while playing around on the Earth, or \"separation from God.\" Over a number of reincarnations, each half seeks the other. When all karmic debt is purged, the two will fuse back together and return to the ultimate.\n\nIn current usage, \"soulmate\" usually refers to a romantic or platonic partner, with the implication of an exclusive lifelong bond. This is to say, the word is used with more rarity than other terms associated with 'romantic' or 'platonic' partner. It is a very versatile term, being defined differently by different individuals, as it is related to the concept of love. It commonly holds the connotation of being the strongest bond with another person that one can achieve. Soulmate is not used as often as other terms representing the same idea, and this is likely to lead to its perceived rarity in meaning. The definition ranges widely and cannot be pinpointed. It is commonly accepted that one will feel 'complete' once they have found their soulmate, as it is partially in the perceived definition that two souls are meant to unite. The term \"soulmate\" first appeared in the English language in a letter by Samuel Taylor Coleridge in 1822.\n\nAccording to spiritual teachers like Mark L. Prophet and Elizabeth Clare Prophet, one’s true love, perfect match, or literal other half is a \"twin flame\"; a soulmate is something else. Twin flames are actually a single soul that was created at the beginning of time, but then divided, as in Plato's idea. The soulmate is a separate entity with whom one has spent many lifetimes as a friend, lover, co-worker or partner, and to whom one is usually drawn to fulfill a specific mission.\n\nAccording to Mark Prophet: \"A soulmate relationship has to do with the seat of the soul chakra, that chakra just above the base\" (this refers to the Svadhisthana center, which believers locate in the lower back or about three inches below the navel, above the Manipura \"base\" chakra) at the genitals). \"The connection is one of parallel and mutual evolution rather than origin.\" Believers describe Svadhisthana as \"the creativity and sexual chakra\". However, the Prophets claim that a true \"literal other half\" relationship doesn't center around energies or activities believed to be related to the sacral chakra, but is a \"profound\" relationship with your direct counterpart -- the twin flame you have known as your other self from the first moment of your creation.\" similar to what Plato describes: he says \"the intense yearning which each of them has towards the other does not appear to be the desire of lover's intercourse, but of something else.\" \n\nIn the 1988 released \"The Ascended Masters on Soulmates and Twin Flames\", Mark and Elizabeth Prophet describe the \"one true love\" or \"origin\" based twin flame relationship that is oftentimes referred to as a soulmate relationship by saying \"They are called twin flames because they came out of the original single ovoid. The Electronic Presence of each soul is the exact duplicate of the other. And when they descend into form, one assumes the positive or masculine and one assumes the negative or feminine polarity.\" The Prophet’s ideas about the physical nature of a \"true love\" relationship are not completely inconsistent with the words and ideas expressed by ancient philosophers and in various religious traditions. The Greek philosopher Aristotle is quoted as saying \"Love is composed of a single soul inhabiting two bodies\" and the Zohar states that \"Each soul and spirit prior to its entering into this world, consists of a male and female united into one being. When it descends on this earth the two parts separate and animate two different bodies. At the time of marriage, the Holy One, blessed be He, who knows all souls and spirits, unites them again as they were before, and they again constitute one body and one soul, forming as it were the right and left of one individual.\" \nIn Hinduism, the gods Shiva and Parvati fit the \"right and left of one individual\" description given in the Judaism related Zohar when represented in their composite androgynous form Ardhanarishvara. It is said that Ardhanarishvara \"represents a synthesis of masculine and feminine energies of the universe\". In Christian literature, there is mention of an Ardhanarishvara like \"two into one\" union in the Gospel of Mark and the Gospel of Matthew \"the two will become one flesh. So they are no longer two, but one flesh\". Additionally, in the Gospel of Thomas, Jesus reportedly describes a \"two into one\", yin and yang like or Ardhanarishvara like relationship to his disciples as the way to enter the Kingdom. \"Jesus said to them, \"When you make the two into one, and when you make the inner like the outer and the outer like the inner, and the upper like the lower, and when you make male and female into a single one, so that the male will not be male nor the female be female, when you make eyes in place of an eye, a hand in place of a hand, a foot in place of a foot, an image in place of an image, then you will enter [the kingdom].\". In Islam, it is believed that the Prophet Muhammad once said \"women are the twin halves of men\".\n\nThe Prophets and other spiritual teachers around the world teach or have taught that one can have many soulmates but only one true love or twin flame. Spiritual teachers like Mark and Elizabeth Prophet ultimately define or describe a soulmate as one of many potential spiritual brothers or sisters \"even though there may be a great attraction and bond between soulmates, fundamentally, in the ultimate sense, you could define it more as a brother/sister relationship, even though soulmates have great marriages and a great union of hearts.\"\n\nBashert () is a Yiddish word that means \"destiny\". It is often used in the context of one's divinely foreordained spouse or soulmate, who is called \"basherte\" (female) or \"basherter\" (male). It can be used to express the seeming fate or destiny of an auspicious or important event, friendship, or happening.\n\nThe idea of basherte or basherter comes from statements found in classical rabbinic literature. A proverb that \"marriages are made in heaven\" is illustrated by a story in a midrash collection:\n\nIn modern usage, Jewish singles will say that they are looking for their bashert, meaning they are looking for that person who will complement them perfectly and whom they will complement perfectly. Since it is considered to have been foreordained by God whom one will marry, one's spouse is considered to be one's bashert by definition, independent of whether the couple's marital life works out well or not.\n\nSome psychologists state that believing that a soulmate exists specifically for a person is an unrealistic expectation.\n\n"}
{"id": "985793", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=985793", "title": "Vacuum extraction", "text": "Vacuum extraction\n\nVacuum extraction (VE), also known as ventouse, is a method to assist delivery of a baby using a vacuum device. It is used in the second stage of labor if it has not progressed adequately. It may be an alternative to a forceps delivery and caesarean section. It cannot be used when the baby is in the breech position or for premature births. The use of VE is generally safe, but it can occasionally have negative effects on either the mother or the child. The term comes from the French word for \"suction cup.\"\n\nThere are several indications to use a vacuum extraction to aid delivery:\n\nThe woman is placed in the lithotomy position and assists throughout the process by pushing. A suction cup is placed onto the head of the baby and the suction draws the skin from the scalp into the cup. Correct placement of the cup directly over the flexion point, about 3 cm anterior from the occipital (posterior) fontanelle, is critical to the success of a VE. Ventouse devices have handles to allow for traction. When the baby's head is delivered, the device is detached, allowing the birthing attendant and the mother to complete the delivery of the baby.\n\nFor proper use of the ventouse, the maternal cervix has to be fully dilated, the head engaged in the birth canal, and the head position known. Preferably the operator of the vacuum extractor needs to be experienced in order to safely perform the procedure. The baby should not be preterm, previously exposed to scalp sampling or failed forceps delivery. If the ventouse attempt fails, it may be necessary to deliver the infant by forceps or caesarean section.\n\nIn 1849 the Edinburgh professor of obstetrics James Young Simpson, subsequently known for pioneering the use of chloroform in childbirth, designed the Air Tractor which consisted of a metal syringe attached to a soft rubber cup. This was the earliest known vacuum extractor to assist childbirth but it did not become popular. Swedish professor Tage Malmstrom developed the ventouse, or Malmstrom extractor in the 1950s. Originally made with a metal cap, new materials such as plastics and siliconised rubber have improved the design so that it is now used more than forceps.\n\n\n\n"}

He had an M.D. degree from the University of Bordeaux. Fluency in French later caused him trouble when claiming to be English in France.\n\nAglionby was elected Fellow of the Royal Society in 1667. From 1669 to 1671 he acted as tutor for Sir Andrew Henley, 1st Baronet and then for Robert Paston, 1st Earl of Yarmouth. In 1679 he was secretary to Sir William Temple at The Hague.\n\nDuring the 1680s Aglionby was in practice in London as a physician. He was based in Broad Street, and was licensed by the Royal College of Physicians in 1687. At this period he took an active part in the Royal Society.\n\nIn 1698 Aglionby was attempting to negotiate a postal treaty with the French Farmer-General of Posts, in Calais. Other diplomatic postings were to Madrid, Turin and Zurich.\n\nAglionby's associates included James Brydges, Abraham Hill, and Matthew Prior.\n\nAglionby's major work was \"Painting Illustrated in Three Diallogues\" (1685). It has been described as the first original English book of its kind, based on the theory that Italian history painting was the leading genre of art; it contained eleven biographies of Italian painters.\n\nAglionby used Giorgio Vasari's \"Lives\", but selectively, and imposing his own views. He began with lives of Cimabue and Giotto, interpolating in the series then a dialogue on the history of painting. There followed: Leonardo da Vinci, Andrea del Sarto, Raphael, Giorgione, Michelangelo, Giulio Romano, Pierino del Vaga, Titian and Donatello. Other sources used include Gian Pietro Bellori and Carlo Cesare Malvasia. Dismissive of Nicolas Poussin, Aglionby mentions favourably if not at length four artists from northern Europe: Dürer, Holbein, Rubens, Van Dyck. The two latter were among the 12 \"Vite\" of Bellori, from which he borrows heavily.\n\nFrom a nationalistic point of view, Aglionby pointed to a revival of the arts at the Restoration of 1660, and promoted the painter John Riley, and the sculptor Grinling Gibbons. As apologetics for English art, which had not contributed to history painting, he argued for its success in portrait painting.\n\n"}
