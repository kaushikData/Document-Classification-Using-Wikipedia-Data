Both sides looked for allies. Nripatunga continued to have Varaguna Pandya by his side while Aparajita allied with the Ganga king Prithvipathi I and with Aditya Chola I. According to some descriptions Aparajitha was found to be noted as son of Nirpatunga Varma, and his mother was noted as Prithivi Manikam daughter of Ganga king. So the Contention that Prithivapathi 1 gone against Nirpatunga was totally un accepatable \nThe rival armies met at Thirupurambiyam near Kumbakonam c. 885 CE. The armies of Pandyas and Nripatunga Pallava were routed by Aparajita Pallava and Aditya I Chola. But Some Inscriptions purely clarified Nirpatunga Was not alive during the war. So it is the war between Pallvas and Pandiyas to establish Legal Supremacy\n\nAlthough the victor of the Thirupurambiyam battle was Aparajita, the real gains went to Aditya I Chola. This battle ensured the end of Pandya power in the south. Pandya Varagunavarman renounced his throne and followed an ascetic life. The grateful Aparajita not only allowed Aditya I Chola to keep the territories won by Vijayalaya Chola, but also to add new territories from the defeated Pandyas.\n\nDuring 903 CE, the 32nd year of his reign, Aditya I Chola, not satisfied with his subordinate position, planned and carried out an attack on his erstwhile overlord, the Pallava king Aparajita. In the battle that ensued, Aditya pounced upon Aparajita when he was mounted on an elephant and killed him. That spelt the end of the Pallava rule in Tondaimandalam (north Tamil Nadu) and the whole of the Pallava kingdom became Chola territory. This marked the effective end of the once great Pallava empire in the history of South India. \n\nThe conquest of the Tondaimandalam earned for Aditya I the epithet \"Tondainadu pavina Rajakesarivarman\" (தொண்டைநாடு பாவின இராசகேசரிவர்மன்) - \"Rajakesarivarman who overran Tondainadu\".\n\nAditya I next conquered the Kongu country in the south west of Tamil Nadu, perhaps from the Pandya king Viranarayana.\n\nFriendly relations appear to have existed between the Cheras and the Cholas during the reign of Aditya  I. The Chera contemporary Sthanu Ravi is stated in inscriptions to have received royal honours from Aditya. AdityaI ’s son, Parantaka I, married a daughter of Sthanu Ravi.\n\nAditya I is known to have built a number of temples 108 for Shiva along the banks of the Kaveri. The Kanyakumari inscription gives us the information that Aditya I was also known by the surname Kodandarama. There is a temple near the town of Tondaimanarrur called \"Kodandarameshvaraa\", also mentioned in its inscriptions by the name \"Adityesvara\". This seems to have been built by Aditya I. He also revised Annamalaiyar sanctum in Thiruvaannamalai during 872900. Aditya also was the patron of Sureswara aand prabhakara who were pupils of kumarila bhatta a favourite student of Adisankaracharya. The author of that work do confirm that they settled in the banks of Kaveri (Sibishu kaveriteere meaning in the country of cholas (Sibi is an ancestor of Cholas)) and were employed by Manukula Adityan (Aditya Chola).\n\nIn an inscription AdityaI is distinguished by the epithet in Tamil(தொண்டைமானரூர் துஞ்சின உடையார் \"Thondaimaanaruur thunjina udaiyaar\"). \"The king who died at Tondaimanarrur\". AdityaI died in 907 CE at Tondaimanarrur. His son Parantaka I built a Shiva temple over his ashes. AdityaI was survived by his queens \"Ilangon Pichchi\" and \"Vayiri Akkan\" alias \"Tribhuvana Madeviyar\". Besides these two queens, AdityaI also had a mistress named \"Nangai Sattaperumanar\" as evidenced from an inscription.\n\nAdityaI had a long and victorious reign during which he laid the foundation of the future greatness of the Chola empire.\n\n"}

His father, overcome by the forces of the Frisians and the bishopric of Münster, was forced to abdicate in 1482. Adolph then succeeded him as head of the county of Oldenburg alongside his younger brother, John V.

Adolph accepted this situation and dedicated himself to the war. With his other brother Otto, he participated in the campaign of Duke Magnus I of Saxe-Lauenburg against the Frisians of Wursten, then an area of free peasant under the loose overlordship of the Prince-Archbishopric of Bremen, which ended in failure in 1499 due to the defense coalition built up by Prince-Archbishop John III.

These arguments are deeply concerned with the implications of predestination.\n\nSome arguments against the existence of God focus on the supposed incoherence of humankind possessing free will and God's omniscience. These arguments are deeply concerned with the implications of predestination.\n\nMoses Maimonides formulated an argument regarding a person's free will, in traditional terms of good and evil actions, as follows:\n\nA logical formulation of this argument might go as follows:\n\nNorman Swartz, however, contends that the above arguments commit the modal fallacy. In particular, he asserts that these arguments assume that if C is true, it becomes necessary for C to be true, which is incorrect as C is contingent (see modal logic). Otherwise, one can argue that the future is set already regardless of his actions.\n\nOther means of reconciling God's omniscience with human free will have been proposed. Some have attempted to redefine or reconceptualize free will:\n\nA proposition first offered by Boethius and later by Thomas Aquinas and C. S. Lewis, suggests that God's perception of time is different, and that this is relevant to our understanding of our own free will. In his book \"Mere Christianity\", Lewis argues that God is actually outside time and therefore does not \"foresee\" events, but rather simply observes them all at once. He explains:\nA common objection is to argue that Molinism, or the belief that God can know counterfactually the actions of his creations, is true. This has been used as an argument by Alvin Plantinga and William Lane Craig, amongst others.\n\nDan Barker suggests that this can lead to a \"Freewill Argument for the Nonexistence of God\" on the grounds that God's omniscience is incompatible with God having free will and that if God does not have freewill God is not a personal being.\n\nTheists generally agree that God is a personal being and that God is omniscient, but there is some disagreement about whether \"omniscient\" means:\n\nThese two terms are known as \"inherent\" and \"total\" omniscience, respectively.\n\n\n\n"}

His sister was the ancient Persian noblewoman and warrior Youtab. Ariobarzanes was made satrap of Persis (the southern province of Fars in present-day Iran) in 335 BC by Darius III Codomannus. Historians are surprised that Darius III appointed a satrap for Persepolis and Persis; apparently that office did not previously exist. Ariobarzanes commanded part of the Persian Army fighting against the Macedonians at the Battle of Gaugamela in 331 BC.\n\nFollowing the Persian defeat at Gaugamela, Darius realized he could not defend his capital Persepolis and travelled east to rebuild his armies, leaving Ariobarzanes in command. Meanwhile, Alexander the Great split his army and led his 14,000-strong force towards the Persian capital via the Persian Gates. There Ariobarzanes successfully ambushed Alexander the Great's army, inflicting heavy casualties. The Persian success at the Battle of the Persian Gate was short lived though; after being held off for 30 days, Alexander the Great outflanked and destroyed the defenders. Some sources indicate that the Persians were betrayed by a captured tribal chief who showed the Macedonians an alternate path that allowed them to outflank Ariobarzanes in a reversal of Thermopylae. Ariobarzanes himself was killed either during the battle or during the retreat to Persepolis. Afterwards, Alexander continued towards Persepolis, seizing the city and its treasury, and eventually looting the city months after its fall.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "6836612", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6836612", "title": "Autoencoder", "text": "Autoencoder\n\nAn autoencoder is a type of artificial neural network used to learn efficient data codings in an unsupervised manner. The aim of an autoencoder is to learn a representation (encoding) for a set of data, typically for dimensionality reduction. Recently, the autoencoder concept has become more widely used for learning generative models of data. Some of the most powerful AI in the 2010s have involved sparse autoencoders stacked inside of deep neural networks.\n\nAn autoencoder learns to compress data from the input layer into a short code, and then uncompress that code into something that closely matches the original data. This forces the autoencoder to engage in dimensionality reduction, for example by learning how to ignore noise. Some architectures use stacked sparse autoencoder layers for image recognition. The first autoencoder might learn to encode easy features like corners, the second to analyze the first layer's output and then encode less local features like the tip of a nose, the third might encode a whole nose, etc., until the final autoencoder encodes the whole image into a code that matches (for example) the concept of \"cat\". An alternative use is as a generative model: for example, if a system is manually fed the codes it has learned for \"cat\" and \"flying\", it may attempt to generate an image of a flying cat, even if it has never seen a flying cat before.\n\nArchitecturally, the simplest form of an autoencoder is a feedforward, non-recurrent neural network very similar to the many single layer perceptrons which makes a multilayer perceptron (MLP) – having an input layer, an output layer and one or more hidden layers connecting them – but with the output layer having the same number of nodes as the input layer, and with the purpose of \"reconstructing\" its own inputs (instead of predicting the target value formula_1 given inputs formula_2). Therefore, autoencoders are unsupervised learning models.\n\nAn autoencoder always consists of two parts, the encoder and the decoder, which can be defined as transitions formula_3 and formula_4 such that:\n\nIn the simplest case, where there is one hidden layer, the encoder stage of an autoencoder takes the input formula_8 and maps it to formula_9:\n\nThis image formula_11 is usually referred to as \"code\", \"latent variables\", or \"latent representation\". Here, formula_12 is an element-wise activation function such as a sigmoid function or a rectified linear unit. formula_13 is a weight matrix and formula_14 is a bias vector. After that, the decoder stage of the autoencoder maps formula_11 to the \"reconstruction\" formula_16 of the same shape as formula_17:\n\nwhere formula_19 for the decoder may differ in general from the corresponding formula_20 for the encoder, depending on the design of the autoencoder.\n\nAutoencoders are also trained to minimise reconstruction errors (such as squared errors):\n\nwhere formula_17 is usually averaged over some input training set.\n\nIf the feature space formula_23 has lower dimensionality than the input space formula_24, then the feature vector formula_25 can be regarded as a compressed representation of the input formula_26. If the hidden layers are larger than the input layer, an autoencoder can potentially learn the identity function and become useless. However, experimental results have shown that autoencoders might still learn useful features in these cases.\n\nVarious techniques exist to prevent autoencoders from learning the identity function and to improve their ability to capture important information and learn richer representations:\n\nDenoising autoencoders take a partially corrupted input whilst training to recover the original undistorted input. This technique has been introduced with a specific approach to \"good\" representation. A \"good\" representation is one that can be obtained robustly from a corrupted input and that will be useful for recovering the corresponding clean input.\" This definition contains the following implicit assumptions:\n\n\nTo train an autoencoder to denoise data, it is necessary to perform preliminary stochastic mapping formula_27 in order to corrupt the data and use formula_28 as input for a normal autoencoder, with the only exception being that the loss should still be computed for the initial input formula_29 instead of formula_30.\n\nAutoencoders were originally invented in the 1980s; however, the initial versions were difficult to train, as the encodings have to compete to set the same small set of bits. This was solved by \"sparse autoencoding\". In a sparse autoencoder, there are actually more (rather than fewer) hidden units than inputs, but only a small number of the hidden units are allowed to be active at the same time.\n\nSparsity may be achieved by additional terms in the loss function during training (by comparing the probability distribution of the hidden unit activations with some low desired value), or by manually zeroing all but the few strongest hidden unit activations (referred to as a \"k-sparse autoencoder\").\n\nVariational autoencoder models inherit autoencoder architecture, but make strong assumptions concerning the distribution of latent variables. They use variational approach for latent representation learning, which results in an additional loss component and specific training algorithm called \"Stochastic Gradient Variational Bayes (SGVB)\". It assumes that the data is generated by a directed graphical model formula_31 and that the encoder is learning an approximation formula_32 to the posterior distribution formula_33 where formula_34 and formula_35 denote the parameters of the encoder (recognition model) and decoder (generative model) respectively. The objective of the variational autoencoder in this case has the following form:\nHere, formula_37 stands for the Kullback–Leibler divergence. The prior over the latent variables is usually set to be the centred isotropic multivariate Gaussian formula_38; however, alternative configurations have also been recently considered, e.g.\n\nContractive autoencoder adds an explicit regularizer in their objective function that forces the model to learn a function that is robust to slight variations of input values. This regularizer corresponds to the Frobenius norm of the Jacobian matrix of the encoder activations with respect to the input. The final objective function has the following form:\n\nIf linear activations are used, or only a single sigmoid hidden layer, then the optimal solution to an autoencoder is strongly related to principal component analysis (PCA). The weights of an autoencoder with a single hidden layer of size formula_40 (where formula_40 is less than the size of the input) span the same vector subspace as the one spanned by the first formula_40 principal components, and the output of the autoencoder is an orthogonal projection onto this subspace. The autoencoder weights are not equal to the principal components, and are generally not orthogonal, yet the principal components may be recovered from them using the Gram-Schmidt process.\n\nThe training algorithm for an autoencoder can be summarized as\n\nAn autoencoder is often trained using one of the many variants of backpropagation (such as conjugate gradient method, steepest descent, etc.). Though these are often reasonably effective, there are fundamental problems with the use of backpropagation to train networks with many hidden layers. Once errors are backpropagated to the first few layers, they become minuscule and insignificant. This means that the network will almost always learn to reconstruct the average of all the training data. Though more advanced backpropagation methods (such as the conjugate gradient method) can solve this problem to a certain extent, they still result in a very slow learning process and poor solutions. This problem can be remedied by using initial weights that approximate the final solution. The process of finding these initial weights is often referred to as \"pretraining\".\n\nStephen Luttrell, while based at RSRE, developed a technique for unsupervised training of hierarchical self-organizing neural nets with \"many hidden layers\", which are equivalent to deep autoencoders. Geoffrey Hinton developed an alternative pretraining technique for training many-layered deep autoencoders. This method involves treating each neighbouring set of two layers as a restricted Boltzmann machine so that the pretraining approximates a good solution, then using a backpropagation technique to fine-tune the results. This model takes the name of deep belief network.\n\n"}

He died while diving to the wreck of the \"Belgioso\" in Dublin Bay using a diving bell of his own design.\n\nCharles Spalding was born in Canongate in Scotland on 29 October 1738, the son of Charles Spalding and Ann Findlay. His father was a bookseller in Canongate. As the son of a merchant, the younger Spalding eventually became a shop-lad.\n\nPossessing a natural inclination towards mechanics, Spalding spent much of his free time as a youth exploring this interest. Spalding eventually became the proprietor of a sugar refining and confectionery shop across from the Royal Exchange on the Royal Mile in Edinburgh.\n\nSpalding's introduction to diving was more the result of necessity than choice. Heavily invested in the brig \"Peggy\", Spalding suffered a severe financial blow when she sank \"en route\" to Scotland at the Farne Islands on 4 December 1774. Elected by his Edinburgh trade guild to recover as many goods as possible, Spalding came up with the idea of diving to the wreck.\n\nThe prevailing diving bell design in 1775 was that of Dr. Edmond Halley (1656–1742), who had computed the orbit of the comet named for him. Using his background in mechanics, Spalding read every book he could find on the design of Halley's diving bell, eventually proceeding to trial dives in the port of Leith, Dunbar Bay and at Dundee. Based on these trials, Spalding determined that Halley's design had weaknesses that added unnecessary risk to the divers. To correct the deficiencies, Spalding added a system of balance-weights to ease the raising and lowering of the bell, along with a series of ropes for signalling the surface crew. The redesigned diving bell weighed and could accommodate two divers. Spalding also added ropes inside in the bell as seats and thick glass windows to admit light.\n\nSpalding never recovered any of his own cargo from the wreck of the \"Peggy\". However, in 1776 Spalding was recognised by The Society for the Encouragement of Arts, Manufactures and Commerce, London, with a nominal monetary award for his modified diving bell design.\n\nWith this success, Spalding founded \"Spalding & Co.\" of Edinburgh for his diving operations. Spalding was assisted in his diving efforts by his brother Thomas (b. 1740), George Small, who was married to Spalding's sister Ann, and his nephew, Ebenezer Watson.\n\nOn 29 August 1782, the warship capsized while under repairs and sank off Spithead, near the port of Portsmouth. HMS \"Royal George\" was the pride of King George III's navy and one of the last British Man-of-war to be primarily outfitted with more expensive brass guns rather than lead. The ordnance alone was valued at £17,000.\n\nOne of the first people on the scene with a diving background was Thomas Spalding, Charles' brother. As a surgeon on an East Indiaman, Thomas happened to be in Portsmouth shortly after the sinking occurred. He immediately proposed to the Admiralty that he and his brother should be allowed to recover as much valuable stores and ordnance from the wreck as possible using his brother's diving bell design. The terms of the salvage arrangement were that Spalding would receive one-third of everything he recovered.\n\nThomas Spalding initially completed several reconnaissance dives before Charles arrived at the site on 2 October 1782 to begin diving. Charles worked on the wreck through most of October 1782 until the beginning of November. Spalding's dives were complicated by weather, the inexperience of the crew in working with the bell, and the amount of debris at the dive site. Overall, Spalding raised 15 guns from the wreck, 9 brass and 6 lead. Spalding's proceeds from his salvage of HMS \"Royal George\" were approximately £400. Spalding later learned that the Admiralty had awarded William Tracey of Portsea, Portsmouth the salvage rights to the wreck for the following spring.\n\nUndeterred, Spalding turned his attention to the wreck of the \"Belgioso\".\n\nIn March 1783, the \"Belgioso\" or \"Count de Belgioso\" Imperial East Indiaman was sailing from Liverpool \"en route\" to China when it sank in a storm at Kish Bank near Dublin Bay in the Irish Sea. The cargo of the \"Belgioso\" was valued at £150,000, with £30,000 in silver and lead. The salvage terms agreed to by the owners were that Spalding would keep one-fourth of all silver and lead recovered and one-half of all other cargo. Additionally, if Spalding failed to recover anything, his entire expense for the operation would be defrayed.\n\nSpalding and his nephew, Ebenezer Watson, arrived in Dublin in May 1783 to begin their dive preparations. On 1 June 1783 they began their dives, making three dives to to the wreck. Typical for the start of a new project, the three dives were plagued with issues.\n\nOn the morning of 2 June 1783, Spalding and Watson resumed diving. Approximately one hour and fifteen minutes had elapsed when the dive crew became concerned. Two to three barrels of air had been sent down with no progress signal from the bell. Since the dive time was longer than usual, the dive crew proceeded to lift the bell. When the bell broke the surface they found both men dead, \"Mr. Spalding reclining on his breast over one of the ropes that was stretched across for the purpose of sitting upon, and Mr. Watson sitting erect in the upper part of the bell\".\n\nOn Sunday morning, 8 June 1783, Charles Spalding and Ebenezer Watson were laid to rest. The Irish press had chronicled Spalding's activity at the \"Belgioso\" wreck site, and Spalding had become somewhat of a local celebrity with the Irish citizens. Many influential Dublin citizens attended the funeral. In a tribute to Spalding's memory, the ships in Dublin Bay kept their flags lowered until the interment was completed. The pair were buried in a single grave in St. Mark's Churchyard in Dublin. The exact location of their grave within the churchyard is unknown.\n\nAn inquest into Spalding's and Watson's deaths was eventually held. The causes reviewed during the hearings varied from the negligence of the dive ship's captain, equipment failure, including tangled signal ropes or the failure of the final cask of air reaching the divers, diver error, putrified air from the rotting cargo of the \"Belgioso\", even sabotage and alcohol. Dive experts today think the most plausible explanation is \"a highly noxious \"effluvia\" entering the bell which could have come from the putrifying bodies or even the rotting cargo of ginseng plants in the cargo hold.\" This theory is consistent with the observation that they made no apparent attempt to make an emergency ascent. The exact cause of death of Spalding and Watson is unknown.\n\nOn 14 August 1768, Spalding married Susan Small, the daughter of James Small, factor of forfeited Struan estates in Perthshire, Scotland. Susan and her father were members of the Smalls of Dirnanean, Perthshire, Scotland.\n\nAt Spalding's death, he left his wife and seven children under the age of fourteen; the youngest being just six months old. A public subscription fund was opened in London for the relief of the family. Spalding's widow continued to operate the confectionery after his death, eventually selling the business and moving to Musselburgh, where she died on 31 October 1818.\n\nCharles Falconer, Baron Falconer of Thoroton is a descendant of Charles Spalding, as is Sheila Legge, the \"Surrealist Phantom\" from the 1936 London International Surrealist Exhibition.\n\n"}
{"id": "37476", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37476", "title": "Civil liberties", "text": "Civil liberties\n\nCivil liberties or personal freedoms are personal guarantees and freedoms that the government cannot abridge, either by law or by judicial interpretation, without due process. Though the scope of the term differs between countries, civil liberties may include the freedom of conscience, freedom of press, freedom of religion, freedom of expression, freedom of assembly, the right to security and liberty, freedom of speech, the right to privacy, the right to equal treatment under the law and due process, the right to a fair trial, and the right to life. Other civil liberties include the right to own property, the right to defend oneself, and the right to bodily integrity. Within the distinctions between civil liberties and other types of liberty, distinctions exist between positive liberty/positive rights and negative liberty/negative rights.\n\nMany contemporary states have a constitution, a bill of rights, or similar constitutional documents that enumerate and seek to guarantee civil liberties. Other states have enacted similar laws through a variety of legal means, including signing and ratifying or otherwise giving effect to key conventions such as the European Convention on Human Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. The existence of some claimed civil liberties is a matter of dispute, as are the extent of most civil rights. Controversial examples include property rights, reproductive rights, and civil marriage. The degree that democracies have involved themselves in needs to take into fact the influence of terrorism. Whether the existence of victimless crimes infringes upon civil liberties is a matter of dispute. Another matter of debate is the suspension or alteration of certain civil liberties in times of war or state of emergency, including whether and to what extent this should occur.\n\nThe formal concept of civil liberties is often dated back to Magna Carta, an English legal charter agreed in 1215 which in turn was based on pre-existing documents, namely the Charter of Liberties.\n\nThe Constitution of People's Republic of China (which applies only to mainland China, not to Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan), especially its Fundamental Rights and Duties of Citizens, claims to protect many civil liberties.\nTaiwan, which is separated from China, has its own Constitution.\n\nThe Fundamental Rights—embodied in Part III of the constitution—guarantee liberties such that all Indians can lead their lives in peace as citizens of India. The six fundamental rights are right to equality, right to freedom, right against exploitation, right to freedom of religion, cultural and educational rights and right to constitutional remedies.\n\nThese include individual rights common to most liberal democracies, incorporated in the fundamental law of the land and are enforceable in a court of law. Violations of these rights result in punishments as prescribed in the Indian Penal Code, subject to discretion of the judiciary. These rights are neither absolute nor immune from constitutional amendments. They have been aimed at overturning the inequalities of pre-independence social practices. Specifically, they resulted in abolishment of un-touchability and prohibit discrimination on the grounds of religion, race, caste, sex, or place of birth. They forbid human trafficking and unfree labour. They protect cultural and educational rights of ethnic and religious minorities by allowing them to preserve their languages and administer their own educational institutions.\n\nAll people, irrespective of race, religion, caste or sex, have the right to approach the High Courts or the Supreme Court for the enforcement of their fundamental rights. It is not necessary that the aggrieved party has to be the one to do so. In public interest, anyone can initiate litigation in the court on their behalf. This is known as \"Public interest litigation\". High Court and Supreme Court judges can also act on their own on the basis of media reports.\n\nThe Fundamental Rights emphasize equality by guaranteeing to all citizens the access and use of public institutions and protections, irrespective of their background. The rights to life and personal liberty apply for persons of any nationality, while others, such as the freedom of speech and expression are applicable only to the citizens of India (including non-resident Indian citizens). The right to equality in matters of public employment cannot be conferred to overseas citizens of India.\n\nFundamental Rights primarily protect individuals from any arbitrary State actions, but some rights are enforceable against private individuals too. For instance, the constitution abolishes untouchability and prohibits \"begar\". These provisions act as a check both on State action and actions of private individuals. Fundamental Rights are not absolute and are subject to reasonable restrictions as necessary for the protection of national interest. In the \"Kesavananda Bharati vs. state of Kerala\" case, the Supreme Court ruled that all provisions of the constitution, including Fundamental Rights can be amended. However, the Parliament cannot alter the basic structure of the constitution like secularism, democracy, federalism, separation of powers. Often called the \"Basic structure doctrine\", this decision is widely regarded as an important part of Indian history. In the 1978 \"Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India\" case, the Supreme Court extended the doctrine's importance as superior to any parliamentary legislation.According to the verdict, no act of parliament can be considered a law if it violated the basic structure of the constitution. This landmark guarantee of Fundamental Rights was regarded as a unique example of judicial independence in preserving the sanctity of Fundamental Rights.\nThe Fundamental Rights can only be altered by a constitutional amendment, hence their inclusion is a check not only on the executive branch, but also on the Parliament and state legislatures. The imposition of a state of emergency may lead to a temporary suspension of the rights conferred by Article 19 (including freedoms of speech, assembly and movement, etc.) to preserve national security and public order. The President can, by order, suspend the constitutional written remedies as well.\n\nSince 1947, Japan, a country with a constitutional monarchy and known for its socially “conservative society where change is gradual,” has a constitution with a seemingly strong bill of rights at its core (). In many ways, it resembles the U.S. Constitution prior to the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and that is because it came into life during the Allied occupation of Japan. This constitution may have felt like a foreign imposition to the governing elites, but not to the ordinary people \"who lacked faith in their discredited leaders and supported meaningful change.\" In the abstract, the constitution strives to secure fundamental individual liberties and rights, which are covered pointedly in articles 10 to 40. Most salient of the human dignity articles is article 25, section 1, which guarantees that all \n\nDespite, the adoption of this liberal constitution, often referred as the \"Postwar Constitution\" (戦後憲法, Sengo-Kenpō) or the \"Peace Constitution\" (平和憲法, Heiwa-Kenpō), the Japanese governing elites have struggled to usher in an inclusive, open and Pluralist society. Even after the end of World War II and the departure of the Allied government of occupation in 1952, Japan has been the target of international criticism for failing to admit to war crimes, institutional religious discrimination and maintaining a weak freedom of the press, the treatment of children, minorities, foreigners, and women, its punitive criminal justice system, and more recently, the systematic bias against LGBT people.\nThe first Japanese attempt to a bill of rights was in the 19th century Meiji constitution (1890), which took both the Prussian (1850) and British constitutions as basic models. However, it had but a meager influence in the practice of the rule of law as well as in people’s daily living. So, the short and deliberately gradual history of struggles for personal rights and protection against government/society's impositions has yet to transform Japan into a champion of universal and individual freedom. According to constitutional scholar, Shigenori Matsui,\n\nDespite the divergences between Japan's social culture and the Liberal Constitutionalism that it purports to have adopted, the country has moved toward closing the gap between the notion and the practice of the law. The trend is more evident in the long term. Among several examples, the Diet (bicameral legislature) ratified the International Bill of Human Rights in 1979 and then it passed the Law for Equal Opportunity in Employment for Men and Women in 1985, measures that were heralded as major steps toward a democratic and participatory society. In 2015, moreover, it reached an agreement with Korea to compensate for abuses related to the so-called “women of comfort” that took place during the Japanese occupation of the peninsula. However, human rights group, and families of the survivors condemned the agreement as patronizing and insulting.\n\nOn its official site, the Japanese government has identified various human rights problems. Among these are child abuses (e.g., bullying, corporal punishment, child sexual abuse, child prostitution, and child pornography), frequent neglect and ill-treatment of elderly persons and individuals with disabilities, Dowa claims (discrimination against the Burakumin), Ainu people (indigenous people in Japan), foreign nationals, HIV/AIDS carriers, Hansen's disease patients, persons released from prison after serving their sentence, crime victims, people whose human rights are violated using the Internet, the homeless, individuals with identity disorders, and women. Also, the government lists systematic problems with gender biases and the standard reference to sexual preferences for jobs and other functions in society.\n\nHuman rights organizations, national and foreign, expand the list to include human rights violations that relate to government policies, as in the case of daiyo kangoku system (substitute prison) and the methods of interrogating crime suspects. The effort of these agencies and ordinary people seem to pay off. In 2016, the U.S. Department of State released a report stating that Japan's human right record is showing signs of improvement.\n\nAlthough Australia does not have an enshrined Bill of Rights or similar binding legal document, civil liberties are assumed as protected through a series of rules and conventions. Australia was a key player and signatory to the UN Universal Declaration on Human Rights (1948)\n\nThe Constitution of Australia (1900) does offer very limited protection of rights:\nCertain High Court interpretations of the Constitution have allowed for implied rights such as freedom of speech and the right to vote to be established, however others such as freedom of assembly and freedom of association are yet to be identified.\n\nRefugee issues\n\nWithin the past decade Australia has experienced increasing contention regarding its treatment of those seeking asylum. Although Australia is a signatory to the UN Refugee Convention (1951), successive governments have demonstrated an increasing tightening of borders; particularly against those who seek passage via small water vessels.\n\nThe Abbott Government (2013) like its predecessors (the Gillard and Howard Governments) has encountered particular difficulty curbing asylum seekers via sea, increasingly identified as \"illegal immigration\". The recent involvement of the Australian Navy in refugee rescue operations has many human rights groups such as Amnesty International concerned over the \"militarisation\" of treatment of refugees. The current \"turn-back\" policy is particularly divisive, as it involves placing refugees in government lifeboats and turning them towards Indonesia. Despite opposition however, the Abbott government's response has so far seen a reduction in the amount of potential refugees undertaking the hazardous cross to Australia, which is argued by the government as an indicator for its policy success.\n\nThe European Convention on Human Rights, to which almost all European countries belong (apart from Belarus), enumerates a number of civil liberties and is of varying constitutional force in different European states.\n\nFollowing the Velvet Revolution, a constitutional overhaul took place in Czechoslovakia. In 1991, the Charter of Fundamental Rights and Basic Freedoms was adopted, having the same legal standing as the Constitution. The Czech Republic has kept the Charter in its entirety following the dissolution of Czechoslovakia as Act No. 2/1993 Coll. (Constitution being No. 1).\n\nFrance's 1789 Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen listed many civil liberties and is of constitutional force.\n\nThe German constitution, the \"Grundgesetz\" (lit. \"Base Law\"), starts with an elaborate listing of civil liberties and states in sec. 1 \"The dignity of man is inviolable. To respect and protect it shall be the duty of all public authority.\" Following the \"Austrian System\", the people have the right to appeal to the Federal Constitutional Court of Germany (\"Bundesverfassungsgericht\") if they feel their civil rights are being violated. This procedure has shaped German law considerably over the years.\n\nCivil liberties in the United Kingdom date back to Magna Carta in 1215 and 17th century common law and statute law, such as the 1628 Petition of Right, the Habeas Corpus Act 1679 and the Bill of Rights 1689. Parts of these laws remain in statute today and are supplemented by other legislation and conventions that collectively form the uncodified Constitution of the United Kingdom. In addition, the United Kingdom is a signatory to the European Convention on Human Rights which covers both human rights and civil liberties. The Human Rights Act 1998 incorporates the great majority of Convention rights directly into UK law.\n\nIn June 2008 the then Shadow Home Secretary David Davis resigned his parliamentary seat over what he described as the \"erosion of civil liberties\" by the then Labour government, and was re-elected on a civil liberties platform (although he was not opposed by candidates of other major parties). This was in reference to anti-terrorism laws and in particular the extension to pre-trial detention, that is perceived by many to be an infringement of \"habeas corpus\" established in Magna Carta.\n\nThe Constitution of the Russian Federation guarantees in theory many of the same rights and civil liberties as the U.S. except to bear arms, i.e.: freedom of speech, freedom of religion, freedom of association and assembly, freedom to choose language, to due process, to a fair trial, privacy, freedom to vote, right for education, etc. However, human rights groups like Amnesty International have warned that Vladimir Putin has seriously curtailed freedom of expression, freedom of assembly and freedom of association amidst growing authoritarianism.\n\nThe Constitution of Canada includes the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms which guarantees many of the same rights as the U.S. constitution, with the notable exceptions of protection against establishment of religion. However, the Charter does protect freedom of religion. The Charter also omits any mention of, or protection for, property.\n\nThe United States Constitution, especially its Bill of Rights, protects civil liberties. The passage of the Fourteenth Amendment further protected civil liberties by introducing the Privileges or Immunities Clause, Due Process Clause, and Equal Protection Clause. Human rights within the United States are often called civil rights, which are those rights, privileges and immunities held by all people, in distinction to \"political\" rights, which are the rights that inhere to those who are entitled to participate in elections, as candidates or voters. Before universal suffrage, this distinction was important, since many people were ineligible to vote but still were considered to have the fundamental freedoms derived from the rights to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. This distinction is less important now that Americans enjoy near universal suffrage, and civil liberties are now taken to include the political rights to vote and participate in elections. Because Indian tribal governments retain sovereignty over tribal members, the U.S. Congress in 1968 enacted a law that essentially applies most of the protections of the Bill of Rights to tribal members, to be enforced mainly by tribal courts.\n\nThe Civil Liberties Act of 1988 was signed into effect by President Ronald Reagan on August 10, 1988. The act was passed by Congress to issue a public apology for those of Japanese ancestry who lost their property and liberty due to discriminatory actions by the United States Government during the internment period.\n\nThis act also provided many other benefits within various sectors of the government. Within the treasury it establishes a civil liberties public education fund. It directs the Attorney General to identify and locate each individual affected by this act and to pay them $20,000 from the civil liberties public education fund. It also established a board of directors who is responsible for making disbursements from this fund. Finally, it requires that all documents and records that are created or received by the commission be kept in the United States archives.\n\n"}

A subsequent development by IBM is the TrueNorth microchip architecture, which is designed to be closer in structure to the human brain than the von Neumann architecture used in conventional computers. In 2017 Intel announced its own version of a cognitive chip in \"Loihi\", which will be available to university and research labs in 2018.\n\nIntel's self-learning neuromorphic chip, named Loihi, perhaps named after the Hawaiian seamount Loihi, offers substantial power efficiency designed after the human brain. Intel claims Loihi is about 1000 times more energy efficient than the general-purpose computing power needed to train the neural networks that rival Loihi’s performance. \nIn theory, this would support both machine learning training and inference on the same silicon independently of a cloud connection, and more efficient than using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) or deep learning neural networks. Intel points to a system for monitoring a person’s heartbeat, taking readings after events such as exercise or eating, and uses the cognitive computing chip to normalize the data and work out the ‘normal’ heartbeat. It can then spot abnormalities, but also deal with any new events or conditions.\n\nThe first iteration of the Loihi chip was made using Intel’s 14 nm fabrication process, and houses 128 clusters of 1,024 artificial neurons each for a total of 131,072 simulated neurons. This offers around 130 million synapses, which is still a rather long way from the human brain's 800 trillion synapses, and behind IBM’s TrueNorth, which has around 16 billion by using 64 by 4,096 cores.\n\nThe IBM cognitive computers implement learning using Hebbian theory. Instead of being programmable in a traditional sense within machine language or a higher level programming language such a device learns by inputting instances through an input device that are aggregated within a computational convolution or neural network architecture consisting of weights within a parallel memory system. An early instantiation of such a device has been developed in 2012 under the Darpa SyNAPSE program at IBM directed by Dharmendra Modha.\n\nIn 2017 this IBM 64-chip array will contain the processing equivalent of 64 million neurons and 16 billion synapses, yet each processor consumes just 10 watts of electricity.\nLike other neural networks, this system will be put to use in pattern recognition and sensory processing roles. The Air Force wants to combine the TrueNorth ability to convert multiple data feeds — whether it's audio, video or text — into machine readable symbols with a conventional supercomputer's ability to crunch data.\nThis isn't the first time that IBM's neural chip system has been integrated into cutting-edge technology. August, 2017 Samsung installed the chips in its Dynamic Vision Sensors enabling cameras to capture images at up to 2,000 fps while using just 300 milliwatts of power.\n\nThere are many approaches and definitions for a cognitive computer, and other approaches may be more fruitful than the others. \n\nSpecifically, there are critics who argue that a room-sized computer - like the case of Watson - is not a viable alternative to a three-pound human brain. Some also cite the difficulty for a single system to bring so many elements together such as the disparate sources of information as well as computing resources. During the 2018 World Economic Forum, there are experts who claim that cognitive systems could adopt the biases of their developers and this was demonstrated in the case of the Google image-recognition or computer vision algorithm, which identified African Americans unfavorably. \n\n\nhttp://www.foxnews.com/tech/2018/01/09/ces-2018-intel-gives-glimpse-into-mind-blowing-future-computing.html\n"}

In classical mechanics, coupling is a connection between two oscillating systems, such as pendulums connected by a string. The connection affects the oscillatory pattern of both objects. In particle physics, <dfn>two particles are coupled </dfn>if they are connected by <dfn>one of the four </dfn>fundamental forces.\n\nIf two waves are able to transmit energy to each other, then these waves are said to be \"coupled.\" This normally occurs when the waves share a common component. An example of this is two pendulums connected by a spring. If the pendulums are identical, then their equations of motion are given by\n\nformula_1\n\nformula_2\n\nThese equations represent the simple harmonic motion of the pendulum with an added coupling factor of the spring. This behavior is also seen in certain molecules (such as CO and HO), wherein <dfn>two of the atoms </dfn>will vibrate around a central <dfn>one in a similar </dfn>manner.\n\nIn LC circuits, charge oscillates between the capacitor and the inductor and can therefore be modeled as a simple harmonic oscillator. When the magnetic flux from <dfn>one inductor is able </dfn>to affect the inductance of an inductor in an unconnected LC circuit, the circuits are said to be coupled. The coefficient of coupling k defines how closely the <dfn>two circuits are coupled </dfn>and is given by the equation\n\nformula_3\n\nWhere M is the mutual inductance of the circuits and L and L are the inductances of the primary and secondary circuits, respectively. If the flux lines of the primary inductor thread every line of the secondary one, then the coefficient of coupling is<dfn> 1 and </dfn>formula_4 In practice, however, there is of<dfn>ten leakage</dfn>, so most systems are not perfectly coupled.\n\nSpin-spin coupling occurs when the magnetic field of <dfn>one atom affects the </dfn>magnetic field of another nearby atom. This is very common in NMR imaging. If the atoms are not coupled, then there will be <dfn>two individual peaks</dfn>, known as a doublet, representing the individual atoms. If coupling is present, then there will be a triplet, <dfn>one larger peak with two smaller ones to </dfn>either side. This occurs due to the spins of the individual atoms oscillating in tandem.\n\nObjects in space which are coupled to each other are under the mutual influence of each other's gravity. For instance, the Earth is coupled to both the sun and the moon, as it is under the gravitational influence of both. Common in space are binary systems, two objects gravitationally coupled to each other. Examples of this are binary stars which circle each other. Multiple objects may also be coupled to each other simultaneously, such as with globular clusters and galaxy groups. When smaller particles, such as dust, which are coupled together over time accumulate into much larger objects, accretion is occurring. This is the major process by which stars and planets form.\n\nThe coupling constant of a plasma is given by the ratio of its average Coulomb-interaction energy to its average kinetic energy—or how strongly the electric force of each atom holds the plasma together . Plasmas can therefore be categorized into weakly- and strongly-coupled plasmas depending upon the value of this ratio. Many of the typical classical plasmas, such as the plasma in the solar corona, are weakly coupled, while the plasma in a white dwarf star is an example of a strongly coupled plasma.\n\nTwo coupled quantum systems can be modeled by a Hamiltonian of the formformula_5\nwhich is the addition of the two Hamiltonians in isolation with an added interaction factor. In most simple systems, formula_6 and formula_7 can be solved exactly while formula_8 can be solved through perturbation theory. If the two systems have similar total energy, then the system may undergo Rabi oscillation.\n\nWhen angular momenta from two separate sources interact with each other, they are said to be coupled. For example, two electrons orbiting around the same nucleus may have coupled angular momenta. Due to the conservation of angular momentum and the nature of the angular momentum operator, the total angular momentum is always the sum of the individual angular momenta of the electrons, or\n\nformula_9\n\nSpin-Orbit interaction (also known as spin-orbit coupling) is a special case of angular momentum coupling. Specifically, it is the interaction between the intrinsic spin of a particle, S, and its orbital angular momentum, L. As they are both forms of angular momentum, they must be conserved. Even if energy is transferred between the two, the total angular momentum, J, of the system must be constant, formula_10.\n\nParticles which interact with each other are said to be coupled. This interaction is caused by one of the fundamental forces, whose strengths are usually given by a dimensionless coupling constant. In quantum electrodynamics, this value is known as the fine-structure constant α, approximately equal to 1/137. For quantum chromodynamics, the constant changes with respect to the distance between the particles. This phenomenon is known as \"asymptotic freedom.\" Forces which have a coupling constant greater than 1 are said to be \"strongly coupled\" while those with constants less than one are said to be \"weakly coupled.\"\n"}
{"id": "38115", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=38115", "title": "Crucifixion", "text": "Crucifixion\n\nCrucifixion is a method of capital punishment in which the victim is tied or nailed to a large wooden beam and left to hang for several days until eventual death from exhaustion and asphyxiation.\n\nThe crucifixion of Jesus is a central narrative in Christianity, and the cross (sometimes depicting Jesus nailed onto it) is the main religious symbol for many Christian churches.\n\nAncient Greek has two verbs for crucify: \"ana-stauro\" (ἀνασταυρόω), from \"stauros\", \"stake\", and \"apo-tumpanizo\" (ἀποτυμπανίζω) \"crucify on a plank\", together with \"anaskolopizo\" (ἀνασκολοπίζω \"impale\"). In earlier pre-Roman Greek texts \"anastauro\" usually means \"impale\".\n\nNew Testament Greek uses four verbs, three of them based upon \"stauros\" (σταυρός), usually translated \"cross\". The most common term is \"stauroo\" (σταυρόω), \"to crucify\", occurring 43 times; \"sustauroo\" (συσταυρόω), \"to crucify with\" or \"alongside\" occurs five times, while \"anastauroo\" (ἀνασταυρόω), \"to crucify again\" occurs only once at the Epistle to the Hebrews 6:6. \"prospegnumi\" (προσπήγνυμι), \"to fix or fasten to, impale, crucify\" occurs only once at the Acts of the Apostles 2:23.\n\nThe English term \"cross\" derives from the Latin word \"crux\". The Latin term \"crux\" classically referred to a tree or any construction of wood used to hang criminals as a form of execution. The term later came to refer specifically to a cross.\n\nThe English term \"crucifix\" derives from the Latin \"crucifixus\" or \"cruci fixus\", past participle passive of \"crucifigere\" or \"cruci figere\", meaning \"to crucify\" or \"to fasten to a cross\".\n\nCrucifixion was most often performed to dissuade its witnesses from perpetrating similar (usually particularly heinous) crimes. Victims were sometimes left on display after death as a warning to any other potential criminals. Crucifixion was usually intended to provide a death that was particularly slow, painful (hence the term \"excruciating\", literally \"out of crucifying\"), gruesome, humiliating, and public, using whatever means were most expedient for that goal. Crucifixion methods varied considerably with location and time period.\n\nThe Greek and Latin words corresponding to \"crucifixion\" applied to many different forms of painful execution, including being impaled on a stake, or affixed to a tree, upright pole (a crux simplex), or (most famous now) to a combination of an upright (in Latin, \"stipes\") and a crossbeam (in Latin, \"patibulum\"). Seneca the Younger wrote: \"I see crosses there, not just of one kind but made in many different ways: some have their victims with head down to the ground; some impale their private parts; others stretch out their arms on the gibbet\".\n\nIn some cases, the condemned was forced to carry the crossbeam to the place of execution. A whole cross would weigh well over 135 kg (300 lb), but the crossbeam would not be quite as burdensome, weighing around 45 kg (100 lb). The Roman historian Tacitus records that the city of Rome had a specific place for carrying out executions, situated outside the Esquiline Gate, and had a specific area reserved for the execution of slaves by crucifixion. Upright posts would presumably be fixed permanently in that place, and the crossbeam, with the condemned person perhaps already nailed to it, would then be attached to the post.\n\nThe person executed may have been attached to the cross by rope, though nails and other sharp materials are mentioned in a passage by the Judean historian Josephus, where he states that at the Siege of Jerusalem (70), \"the soldiers out of rage and hatred, \"nailed\" those they caught, one after one way, and another after another, to the crosses, by way of jest\". Objects used in the crucifixion of criminals, such as nails, were sought as amulets with perceived medicinal qualities.\n\nWhile a crucifixion was an execution, it was also a humiliation, by making the condemned as vulnerable as possible. Although artists have traditionally depicted the figure on a cross with a loin cloth or a covering of the genitals, the person being crucified was usually stripped naked. Writings by Seneca the Younger state some victims suffered a stick forced upwards through their groin. Despite its frequent use by the Romans, the horrors of crucifixion did not escape criticism by some eminent Roman orators. Cicero, for example, described crucifixion as \"a most cruel and disgusting punishment\", and suggested that \"the very mention of the cross should be far removed not only from a Roman citizen's body, but from his mind, his eyes, his ears\". Elsewhere he says, \"It is a crime to bind a Roman citizen; to scourge him is a wickedness; to put him to death is almost parricide. What shall I say of crucifying him? So guilty an action cannot by any possibility be adequately expressed by any name bad enough for it.\"\n\nFrequently, the legs of the person executed were broken or shattered with an iron club, an act called \"crurifragium\", which was also frequently applied without crucifixion to slaves. This act hastened the death of the person but was also meant to deter those who observed the crucifixion from committing offenses.\n\nThe gibbet on which crucifixion was carried out could be of many shapes. Josephus describes several tortures and positions of crucifixion during the Siege of Jerusalem as Titus crucified the rebels; and Seneca the Younger recounts: \"I see crosses there, not just of one kind but made in many different ways: some have their victims with head down to the ground; some impale their private parts; others stretch out their arms on the gibbet.\"\n\nAt times the gibbet was only one vertical stake, called in Latin \"crux simplex\". This was the simplest available construction for torturing and killing the condemned. Frequently, however, there was a cross-piece attached either at the top to give the shape of a T (\"crux commissa\") or just below the top, as in the form most familiar in Christian symbolism (\"crux immissa\"). The most ancient image of a Roman crucifixion depicts an individual on a T-shaped cross. It is a graffito found in a taberna (hostel for wayfarers) in Puteoli, dating to the time of Trajan or Hadrian (late 1st century to early 2nd century AD).\n\nSome 2nd-century writers took it for granted that a crucified person's arms would be stretched out, not connected to a single stake: Lucian speaks of Prometheus as crucified \"above the ravine with his hands outstretched\" and explains that the letter T (the Greek letter tau) was looked upon as an unlucky letter or sign (similar to the way the number thirteen is looked upon today as an unlucky number), saying that the letter got its \"evil significance\" because of the \"evil instrument\" which had that shape, an instrument on which tyrants crucified people. Jehovah's Witnesses argue that Jesus was crucified on a \"crux simplex\", and that the \"crux immissa\" was first used as a Christian symbol near the time of the supposed conversion of Emperor Constantine. Other forms were in the shape of the letters X and Y.\n\nThe New Testament writings about the crucifixion of Jesus do not speak specifically about the shape of that cross, but the early writings that do speak of its shape, from about the year AD 100 on, describe it as shaped like the letter T (the Greek letter tau) or as composed of an upright and a transverse beam, sometimes with a small projection in the upright.\n\nIn popular depictions of the crucifixion of Jesus (possibly because in translations of the wounds are described as being \"in his hands\"), Jesus is shown with nails in his hands. But in Greek the word \"χείρ\", usually translated as \"hand\", could refer to the entire portion of the arm below the elbow, and to denote the \"hand\" as distinct from the \"arm\" some other word could be added, as \"ἄκρην οὔτασε χεῖρα\" (he wounded the end of the χείρ, i.e., \"he wounded her in the hand\".\n\nA possibility that does not require tying is that the nails were inserted just above the wrist, between the two bones of the forearm (the radius and the ulna).\n\nAn experiment that was the subject of a documentary on the National Geographic Channel's \"Quest For Truth: The Crucifixion\", showed that nailed feet provided enough support for the body, and that the hands could have been merely tied. Nailing the feet to the side of the cross relieves strain on the wrists by placing most of the weight on the lower body.\n\nAnother possibility, suggested by Frederick Zugibe, is that the nails may have been driven in at an angle, entering in the palm in the crease that delineates the bulky region at the base of the thumb, and exiting in the wrist, passing through the carpal tunnel.\n\nA foot-rest (\"suppedaneum\") attached to the cross, perhaps for the purpose of taking the person's weight off the wrists, is sometimes included in representations of the crucifixion of Jesus, but is not discussed in ancient sources. Some scholars interpret the Alexamenos graffito, the earliest surviving depiction of the Crucifixion, as including such a foot-rest. Ancient sources also mention the \"sedile\", a small seat attached to the front of the cross, about halfway down, which could have served a similar purpose.\n\nIn 1968, archaeologists discovered at Giv'at ha-Mivtar in northeast Jerusalem the remains of one Jehohanan, who had been crucified in the 1st century. The remains included a heel bone with a nail driven through it from the side. The tip of the nail was bent, perhaps because of striking a knot in the upright beam, which prevented it being extracted from the foot. A first inaccurate account of the length of the nail led some to believe that it had been driven through both heels, suggesting that the man had been placed in a sort of sidesaddle position, but the true length of the nail, 11.5 cm (4.53 inches), suggests instead that in this case of crucifixion the heels were nailed to opposite sides of the upright. The skeleton from Giv'at ha-Mivtar is currently the only recovered example of ancient crucifixion in the archaeological record.\n\nThe length of time required to reach death could range from hours to days depending on method, the victim's health, and the environment. A literature review by Maslen and Mitchell identified scholarly support for several possible causes of death: cardiac rupture, heart failure, hypovolemic shock, acidosis, asphyxia, arrhythmia, and pulmonary embolism. Death could result from any combination of those factors or from other causes, including sepsis following infection due to the wounds caused by the nails or by the scourging that often preceded crucifixion, eventual dehydration, or animal predation.\n\nA theory attributed to Pierre Barbet holds that, when the whole body weight was supported by the stretched arms, the typical cause of death was asphyxiation. He wrote that the condemned would have severe difficulty inhaling, due to hyper-expansion of the chest muscles and lungs. The condemned would therefore have to draw himself up by the arms, leading to exhaustion, or have his feet supported by tying or by a wood block. When no longer able to lift himself, the condemned would die within a few minutes. Some scholars, including Frederick Zugibe, posit other causes of death. Zugibe suspended test subjects with their arms at 60° to 70° from the vertical. The test subjects had no difficulty breathing during experiments, but did suffer rapidly increasing pain, which is consistent with the Roman use of crucifixion to achieve a prolonged, agonizing death. However, Zugibe's positioning of the test subjects' feet is not supported by any archaeological or historical evidence.\n\nSince death does not follow immediately on crucifixion, survival after a short period of crucifixion is possible, as in the case of those who choose each year as a devotional practice to be non-lethally crucified.\n\nThere is an ancient record of one person who survived a crucifixion that was intended to be lethal, but that was interrupted. Josephus recounts: \"I saw many captives crucified, and remembered three of them as my former acquaintance. I was very sorry at this in my mind, and went with tears in my eyes to Titus, and told him of them; so he immediately commanded them to be taken down, and to have the greatest care taken of them, in order to their recovery; yet two of them died under the physician's hands, while the third recovered.\" Josephus gives no details of the method or duration of the crucifixion of his three friends before their reprieve.\n\nAlthough the ancient Jewish historian Josephus, as well as other sources, refers to the crucifixion of thousands of people by the Romans, there is only a single archaeological discovery of a crucified body dating back to the Roman Empire around the time of Jesus. This was discovered at Givat HaMivtar, Jerusalem in 1968. It is not necessarily surprising that there is only one such discovery, because a crucified body was usually left to decay on the cross and therefore would not be preserved. The only reason these archaeological remains were preserved was because family members gave this particular individual a customary burial.\n\nThe remains were found accidentally in an ossuary with the crucified man's name on it, 'Jehohanan, the son of Hagakol'. Nicu Haas, an anthropologist at the Hebrew University Medical School in Jerusalem, examined the ossuary and discovered that it contained a heel bone with a nail driven through its side, indicating that the man had been crucified. The position of the nail relative to the bone indicates that the feet had been nailed to the cross from their side, not from their front; various opinions have been proposed as to whether they were both nailed together to the front of the cross or one on the left side, one on the right side. The point of the nail had olive wood fragments on it indicating that he was crucified on a cross made of olive wood or on an olive tree.\n\nAdditionally, a piece of acacia wood was located between the bones and the head of the nail, presumably to keep the condemned from freeing his foot by sliding it over the nail. His legs were found broken, possibly to hasten his death. It is thought that because in Roman times iron was rare, the nails were removed from the dead body to conserve costs. According to Haas, this could help to explain why only one nail has been found, as the tip of the nail in question was bent in such a way that it could not be removed.\n\nHaas had also identified a scratch on the inner surface of the right radius bone of the forearm, close to the wrist. He deduced from the form of the scratch, as well as from the intact wrist bones, that a nail had been driven into the forearm at that position. However, many of Haas' findings have been challenged. For instance, it was subsequently determined that the scratches in the wrist area were non-traumatic – and, therefore, not evidence of crucifixion – while reexamination of the heel bone revealed that the two heels were not nailed together, but rather separately to either side of the upright post of the cross.\n\nCrucifixion (or impalement), in one form or another, was used by Persians, Carthaginians, and Macedonians.\n\nThe Greeks were generally opposed to performing crucifixions. However, in his \"Histories\", ix.120–122, the Greek writer Herodotus describes the execution of a Persian general at the hands of Athenians in about 479 BC: \"They nailed him to a plank and hung him up ... this Artayctes who suffered death by crucifixion.\" The \"Commentary on Herodotus\" by How and Wells remarks: \"They crucified him with hands and feet stretched out and nailed to cross-pieces; cf. vii.33. This barbarity, unusual on the part of Greeks, may be explained by the enormity of the outrage or by Athenian deference to local feeling.\"\n\nSome Christian theologians, beginning with Paul of Tarsus writing in Galatians , have interpreted an allusion to crucifixion in Deuteronomy . This reference is to being hanged from a tree, and may be associated with lynching or traditional hanging. However, Rabbinic law limited capital punishment to just 4 methods of execution: stoning, burning, strangulation, and decapitation, while the passage in Deuteronomy was interpreted as an obligation to hang the corpse on a tree as a form of deterrence. The fragmentary Aramaic Testament of Levi (DSS 4Q541) interprets in column 6: \"God ... (partially legible)-\"will set\" ... right errors. ... (partially legible)-\"He will judge\" ... revealed sins. Investigate and seek and know how Jonah wept. Thus, you shall not destroy the weak by wasting away or by ... (partially legible)-\"crucifixion\" ... Let not the nail touch him.\"\n\nThe Jewish king Alexander Jannaeus, king of Judea from 103 BC to 76 BC, crucified 800 rebels, said to be Pharisees, in the middle of Jerusalem.\n\nAlexander the Great is reputed to have crucified 2,000 survivors from his siege of the Phoenician city of Tyre, as well as the doctor who unsuccessfully treated Alexander's friend Hephaestion. Some historians have also conjectured that Alexander crucified Callisthenes, his official historian and biographer, for objecting to Alexander's adoption of the Persian ceremony of royal adoration.\n\nIn Carthage, crucifixion was an established mode of execution, which could even be imposed on generals for suffering a major defeat.\n\nThe oldest crucifixion may be a post-mortem one mentioned by Herodotus. Polycrates, the tyrant of Samos, was put to death in 522 B.C. by Persians, and his dead body was then crucified.\n\nThe hypothesis that the Ancient Roman custom of crucifixion may have developed out of a primitive custom of \"arbori suspendere\"—hanging on an \"arbor infelix\" (\"inauspicious tree\") dedicated to the gods of the nether world—is rejected by William A. Oldfather, who shows that this form of execution (the \"supplicium more maiorum\", punishment in accordance with the custom of our ancestors) consisted of suspending someone from a tree, not dedicated to any particular gods, and flogging him to death. Tertullian mentions a 1st-century AD case in which trees were used for crucifixion, but Seneca the Younger earlier used the phrase \"infelix lignum\" (unfortunate wood) for the transom (\"patibulum\") or the whole cross. Plautus and Plutarch are the two main sources for accounts of criminals carrying their own patibula to the upright \"stipes\".\n\nNotorious mass crucifixions followed the Third Servile War in 73–71 BC (the slave rebellion under Spartacus), other Roman civil wars in the 2nd and 1st centuries BC, and the destruction of Jerusalem in AD 70. Crassus crucified 6,000 of Spartacus' followers hunted down and captured after his defeat in battle. Josephus tells a story of the Romans crucifying people along the walls of Jerusalem. He also says that the Roman soldiers would amuse themselves by crucifying criminals in different positions.\n\nConstantine the Great, the first Christian emperor, abolished crucifixion in the Roman Empire in 337 out of veneration for Jesus Christ, its most famous victim.\n\nCrucifixion was intended to be a gruesome spectacle: the most painful and humiliating death imaginable. It was used to punish slaves, pirates, and enemies of the state. It was originally reserved for slaves (hence still called \"supplicium servile\" by Seneca), and later extended to citizens of the lower classes (\"humiliores\"). The victims of crucifixion were stripped naked and put on public display while they were slowly tortured to death so that they would serve as a spectacle and an example.\n\nAccording to Roman law, if a slave killed his or her master, all of the master's slaves would be crucified as punishment. Both men and women were crucified. Tacitus writes in his \"Annals\" that when Lucius Pedanius Secondus was murdered by a slave, some in the Senate tried to prevent the mass crucifixion of four hundred of his slaves because there were so many women and children, but in the end tradition prevailed and they were all executed. Although not conclusive evidence for female crucifixion by itself, the most ancient image of a Roman crucifixion may depict a crucified woman, whether real or imaginary. Crucifixion was such a gruesome and humiliating way to die that the subject was somewhat of a taboo in Roman culture, and few crucifixions were specifically documented. One of the only specific female crucifixions we have documented is that of Ida, a freedwoman (former slave) who was crucified by order of Tiberius.\n\nCrucifixion was typically carried out by specialized teams, consisting of a commanding centurion and his soldiers. First, the condemned would be stripped naked and scourged. This would cause the person to lose a large amount of blood, and approach a state of shock. The convict then usually had to carry the horizontal beam (\"patibulum\" in Latin) to the place of execution, but not necessarily the whole cross.\n\nDuring the death march, the prisoner, probably still nude after the scourging, would be led through the most crowded streets bearing a \"titulus\" — a sign board proclaiming the prisoner's name and crime. Upon arrival at the place of execution, selected to be especially public, the convict would be stripped of any remaining clothing, then nailed to the cross naked. If the crucifixion took place in an established place of execution, the vertical beam (\"stipes\") might be permanently embedded in the ground. In this case, the condemned person's wrists would first be nailed to the \"patibulum\", and then he or she would be hoisted off the ground with ropes to hang from the elevated \"patibulum\" while it was fastened to the \"stipes\". Next the feet or ankles would be nailed to the upright stake. The 'nails' were tapered iron spikes approximately long, with a square shaft across. The \"titulus\" would also be fastened to the cross to notify onlookers of the person's name and crime as they hung on the cross, further maximizing the public impact.\n\nThere may have been considerable variation in the position in which prisoners were nailed to their crosses and how their bodies were supported while they died. Seneca the Younger recounts: \"I see crosses there, not just of one kind but made in many different ways: some have their victims with head down to the ground; some impale their private parts; others stretch out their arms on the gibbet.\" One source claims that for Jews (apparently not for others), a man would be crucified with his back to the cross as is traditionally depicted, while a woman would be nailed facing her cross, probably with her back to onlookers, or at least with the \"stipes\" providing some semblance of modesty if viewed from the front. Such concessions were \"unique\" and not made outside a Jewish context. Several sources mention some sort of seat fastened to the \"stipes\" to help support the person's body, thereby prolonging the person's suffering and humiliation by preventing the asphyxiation caused by hanging without support. Justin Martyr calls the seat a \"cornu\", or \"horn,\" leading some scholars to believe it may have had a pointed shape designed to torment the crucified person. This would be consistent with Seneca's observation of victims with their private parts impaled.\n\nIn Roman-style crucifixion, the condemned could take up to a few days to die, but death was sometimes hastened by human action. \"The attending Roman guards could leave the site only after the victim had died, and were known to precipitate death by means of deliberate fracturing of the tibia and/or fibula, spear stab wounds into the heart, sharp blows to the front of the chest, or a smoking fire built at the foot of the cross to asphyxiate the victim.\" The Romans sometimes broke the prisoner's legs to hasten death and usually forbade burial. On the other hand, the person was often deliberately kept alive as long as possible to prolong their suffering and humiliation, so as to provide the maximum deterrent effect. Corpses of the crucified were typically left on the crosses to decompose and be eaten by animals.\n\nIslam spread in a region where many societies, including the Persian and Roman empires, had used crucifixion to punish traitors, rebels, robbers and criminal slaves. The Qur'an refers to crucifixion in six passages, of which the most significant for later legal developments is verse 5:33:\n\nThe corpus of hadith provides contradictory statements about the first use of crucifixion under Islamic rule, attributing it variously to Muhammad himself (for murder and robbery of a shepherd) or to the second caliph Umar (applied to two slaves who murdered their mistress). Classical Islamic jurisprudence applies the verse 5:33 chiefly to highway robbers, as a \"hadd\" (scripturally prescribed) punishment. The preference for crucifixion over the other punishments mentioned in the verse or for their combination (which Sadakat Kadri has called \"Islam's equivalent of the hanging, drawing and quartering that medieval Europeans inflicted on traitors\") is subject to \"complex and contested rules\" in classical jurisprudence. Most scholars required crucifixion for highway robbery combined with murder, while others allowed execution by other methods for this scenario. The main methods of crucifixion are:\n\n\nMost classical jurists limit the period of crucifixion to three days. Crucifixion involves affixing or impaling the body to a beam or a tree trunk. Various minority opinions also prescribed crucifixion as punishment for a number of other crimes. Cases of crucifixion under most of the legally prescribed categories have been recorded in the history of Islam, and prolonged exposure of crucified bodies was especially common for political and religious opponents.\n\nCrucifixion was introduced into Japan during the Sengoku period (1467–1573), after a 350-year period with no capital punishment. It is believed to have been suggested to the Japanese by the introduction of Christianity into the region, although similar types of punishment had been used as early as the Kamakura period. Known in Japanese as , crucifixion was used in Japan before and during the Tokugawa Shogunate. Several related crucifixion techniques were used. Petra Schmidt, in \"Capital Punishment in Japan\", writes:\nIn 1597 twenty-six Christian Martyrs were nailed to crosses at Nagasaki, Japan. Among those executed were Saints Paulo Miki, Philip of Jesus and Pedro Bautista, a Spanish Franciscan who had worked about ten years in the Philippines. The executions marked the beginning of a long history of persecution of Christianity in Japan, which continued until its decriminalization in 1871.\n\nCrucifixion was used as a punishment for prisoners of war during World War II. Ringer Edwards, an Australian prisoner of war, was crucified for killing cattle, along with two others. He survived 63 hours before being let down.\n\nIn Burma, crucifixion was a central element in several execution rituals. Felix Carey, a missionary in Burma from 1806 to 1812, wrote the following:\n\nDuring World War I, there were persistent rumors that German soldiers had crucified a Canadian soldier on a tree or barn door with bayonets or combat knives. The event was initially reported in 1915 by Private George Barrie of the 1st Canadian Division. Two investigations, one a post-war official investigation, and the other an independent investigation by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, concluded that there was no evidence to support the story. However, British documentary maker Iain Overton in 2001 published an article claiming that the story was true, identifying the soldier as Harry Band. Overton's article was the basis for a 2002 episode of the Channel 4 documentary show \"Secret History\".\n\nIt has been reported that crucifixion was used in several cases against the German civil population of East Prussia when it was occupied by Soviet forces at the end of the Second World War.\n\nCrucifixion is still used as a rare method of execution in some countries. The punishment of crucifixion (\"șalb\") imposed in Islamic law is variously interpreted as exposure of the body after execution, crucifixion followed by stabbing in the chest, or crucifixion for three days, survivors of which are allowed to live.\n\nSeveral people have been executed by crucifixion in Saudi Arabia in the 2000s, although on occasion they were first beheaded and then crucified. Most recently, in March 2013, a robber was set to be executed by being crucified for three days. However, the method was changed.\n\nAli Mohammed Baqir al-Nimr was arrested in 2012 when he was 17 years old for taking part in an anti-government protests in Saudi Arabia during the Arab Spring. In May 2014, Ali al-Nimr was sentenced to be publicly beheaded and crucified.\n\nTheoretically, crucifixion is still one of the Hadd punishments in Iran. If a crucified person were to survive three days of crucifixion, that person would be allowed to live. Execution by hanging is described as follows: \"In execution by hanging, the prisoner will be hung on a hanging truss which should look like a cross, while his (her) back is toward the cross, and (s)he faces the direction of Mecca [in Saudi Arabia], and his (her) legs are vertical and distant from the ground.\"\n\nSudan's penal code, based upon the government's interpretation of shari'a, includes execution followed by crucifixion as a penalty. When, in 2002, 88 people were sentenced to death for crimes relating to murder, armed robbery, and participating in ethnic clashes, Amnesty International wrote that they could be executed by either hanging or crucifixion.\n\nCrucifixion is a legal punishment in the United Arab Emirates.\n\nOn 5 February 2015 the United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child (CRC) reported that the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) had committed \"several cases of mass executions of boys, as well as reports of beheadings, crucifixions of children and burying children alive\".\n\nOn 30 April 2014 Islamic extremists carried out a total of seven public executions in Raqqa, northern Syria. The pictures, originally posted to Twitter by a student at Oxford University, were retweeted by a Twitter account owned by a known member of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) causing major media outlets to incorrectly attribute the crucifixions to the militant group. In most of these cases of \"crucifixion\" the victims are shot first then their bodies are displayed but there have also been reports of \"crucifixion\" preceding shootings or decapitations as well as a case where a man was said to have been \"crucified alive for eight hours\" with no indication of whether he died.\n\nThe human rights group Karen Women Organization documented a case of Tatmadaw forces crucifying several Karen villagers in 2000 in the Dooplaya District in Burma's Kayin State.\n\nOn 22 January 2014, an anti-government activist and member of AutoMaidan was kidnapped by unknown parties and tortured for a week. His captors kept him in the dark, beat him, cut off a piece of his ear, and nailed him to a cross. His captors ultimately left him in a forest outside Kiev after forcing him to confess to being an American spy and accepting money from the US Embassy in Ukraine to organize protests against then-President Viktor Yanukovych.\n\nIn 2015, a video surfaced depicting members of the Azov Battalion, an official regiment of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, allegedly crucifying a separatist rebel of Novorossiya and burning him alive. Therein they declare, \"all the separatists, traitors of Ukraine and militia fighters [sic] will be treated the same\". The Azov Battalion is associated with neo-Nazism and flaunts symbols associated with the SS such as the wolfsangel and black sun. They allegedly sent the video to the pro-Russian hacktivist organization CyberBerkut, which responded by threatening to take no Ukrainian Army soldiers or militia fighters as prisoners from then on. The authenticity of this video is unconfirmed.\n\nThe Catholic Church frowns upon self-crucifixion as a form of devotion: \"Penitential practices leading to self-crucifixion with nails are not to be encouraged.\" Nevertheless, the practice is not unknown.\n\nIn the Philippines, some Catholics are voluntarily, non-lethally crucified for a limited time on Good Friday to imitate the sufferings of Christ. Pre-sterilised nails are driven through the palm of the hand between the bones, while there is a footrest to which the feet are nailed. Rolando del Campo, a carpenter in Pampanga, vowed to be crucified every Good Friday for 15 years if God would carry his wife through a difficult childbirth, while in San Pedro Cutud, Ruben Enaje has been crucified 27 times. The Church in the Philippines has repeatedly voiced disapproval of crucifixions and self-flagellation, while the government has noted that it cannot deter devotees. The Department of Health insists that participants in the rites should have tetanus shots and that the nails used should be sterilized.\n\nIn other cases, a crucifixion is only simulated within a passion play, as in the ceremonial re-enactment that has been performed yearly in the town of Iztapalapa, on the outskirts of Mexico City, since 1833, and in the more famous Oberammergau Passion Play. Also, since at least the mid-19th century, a group of flagellants in New Mexico, called \"Hermanos de Luz\" (\"Brothers of Light\"), have annually conducted reenactments of Christ's crucifixion during Holy Week, in which a penitent is tied—but not nailed—to a cross.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "30033321", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30033321", "title": "Dangerous play in rugby union", "text": "Dangerous play in rugby union\n\nDangerous play in rugby union is dealt with under the foul play law (Law 10) in the official International Rugby Board (IRB) rugby union law book. It defines foul play as \"anything a player does within the playing enclosure that is against the letter and spirit of the Laws of the Game\". Under these laws dangerous play includes; punching or striking, stamping or trampling, and kicking.\n\nIf a referee observes dangerous play they are obliged to penalise and admonish the perpetrator. This can result in a \"temporary suspension\" (yellow card) of 10 minutes or even a \"sending off\" (red card). If the offence is serious enough further action can be taken after the game, including bans from playing rugby and criminal charges. In some high-profile matches a citing commissioner is appointed, who can cite any player for dangerous play, whether they have been detected by the referee or not. In matches where there is no appointed citing commissioner the Unions involved can cite players for dangerous play. During the judicial process the severity of the incident is considered. This is assessed by judging if the offending was intentional, reckless, provoked or premeditated as well as what body part was used (fist, knee, boot etc.), how vulnerable the victim was, the effect of the actions had on the victim and disciplinary record of the offender. When handing out match suspensions for dangerous play the IRB recommends suspension periods based on the type and severity of the offence. For most incidences of dangerous play (punching, stamping, dangerous tackles etc.) they recommend suspensions starting from two weeks, up to a maximum of one year. The more serious offences include striking with the head (up to two years), making contact with the eyes (up to three years), testicle grabbing (up to four years) and biting (up to four years).\n\nThe law that deals with dangerous play also applies to misconduct. Misconduct is any conduct (excluding foul play during a match) that is unsporting, unruly, ill-disciplined or that brings the sport of rugby union into disrepute. Misconduct deals with violence or intimidation that occurs within the venue (i.e. changing rooms, tunnel, warmup area), abuse of match officials or spectators, discriminatory statements, bribery, betting on involved games or lying about past disciplinary records. The penalty handed down for misconduct cases could be a caution, fine, suspension (for a number of matches or time period), exclusion from Rugby Unions or grounds, suspension from Rugby officiating or a combination of the above. Verbal abuse of match officials can be punished by up to a year suspension, while threatening could result in five years and physical abuse of an official could see the offender banned for life. Racial or other discriminatory abuse could see a player banned for up to a year. if the player is banned he or she can go to the crown kings general court so that they can get the time on their ban reduced.\n\nEarly Rugby games were played under a code of conduct that varied between each school or club. As the popularity and number of clubs increased a set of standardised rules were developed. On the 24 November 1863 a set of rules were developed by the Football Association (FA) that included the first law involving dangerous play. Law 10 stated that: \"If any player with the ball should run towards his advisories' goal, any player in the opposition side should be at liberty to charge, hold, trip, or hack him, or wrest the ball from him; but no player shall be held or hacked at the same time\". Hacking (tripping an opponent and kicking his shins) and carrying the ball were the most contested rules and they were soon scrapped by the FA. This caused some clubs to leave the Association and soon more games were played that involved hacking and carrying the ball than those that followed the FA's \"official\" laws. Concerns over hacking came to a head in 1870 when a surgeon published a letter in the times complaining about the number of rugby injuries he had dealt with that involved hacking, and chastised the schools for letting it continue.\n\nDuring the 1974 Lions tour to South Africa, Lions captain Willie McBride devised a plan where on a set call every player would attack a South African player, reasoning that this would prevent the referee form penalising any one individual, as he could not send the whole team off.\nAfter French fullback Serge Blanco was bumped after taking a mark by Englishman Nigel Heslop during the 1991 Rugby World Cup quarter-final, flanker Éric Champ knocked Heslop out with a punch. In 1990 English lock Paul Ackford was unexpectedly hit by a haymaker from Argentine prop Federico Mendez after being mistaken for another player who made contact with Mendez's head. During the British and Irish Lions 2001 tour match against Australian state side the New South Wales Waratahs, fullback Duncan McRae punched Lions Fly half Ronan O'Gara multiple times as he lay prone on the ground. He received a red card and subsequent seven week ban for the offence, although as it occurred during the Australian off-season he didn't miss any games. In 2009 at a rugby derby involving two of Romania's top teams a mass brawl broke out involving most of the players and reportedly a few spectators. Two players received a red card at the time and nine players were later suspended by the Romanian Rugby Federation.\n\nIn a 1927 match involving Quillan, the strongest team in France at the time, and Perpignan, the Quillan hooker Gaston Riviere received such a kicking that he died from his injuries. Welsh fullback JPR Williams was the victim of stamping by touring New Zealand prop John Ashworth in 1978. After receiving 30 stitches from his father he returned to the game. A player for Welsh club Pontycymmer was jailed for 15 months after stomping on an opposition player's head during a rugby game in 2005. In 2006 a South African rugby player from the Western Cape died after allegedly being kicked in the head during a rugby match.\n\nSouth African prop Johan Le Roux bit New Zealand hooker Sean Fitzpatrick's ear during a scrum during a test in 1994, receiving an 18-month ban. After the disciplinary hearing he stated that \"For an 18-month suspension, I feel I probably should have torn it off\". Kevin Yates, an English international, was cited for foul play in 1998 by London Scottish after a player suffered a serious injury to his left ear and subsequently received a six-month ban. In 2008 an English club player was banned for eighty weeks following a biting incident that left a player with \"a partial amputation of the right index finger\". A Welsh club rugby player was jailed for a year in 2008 for biting an opponent's earlobe off. After a scuffle during a 2009 rugby match in the Cape Town suburb of Brackenfell, a player had to have his fingertip reattached after an alleged biting incident.\n\nNew Zealand players Tana Umaga and Kevin Mealamu were involved in an alleged spear tackle on Lions captain Brian O'Driscoll at the start of the first test during the 2005 tour. The tackle dislocated O'Driscoll's shoulder, putting him out of the rest of the tour. Although cited, no suspensions were handed to either Umaga or Mealamu.\n\nEye-gouging is a serious offence where a player uses hands or fingers to inflict pain in an opponent's eyes. The game's laws refer to it as \"contact with eyes or the eye area of an opponent\" but such incidents are usually referred to as \"eye-gouging\" among players and in the media. The IRB has made special mention of eye gouging, describing it as \"particularly heinous\". Following two high-profile test match incidents, involving Schalk Burger and Sergio Parisse, during the same week in June 2009, the IRB stated that it would review the sanction structure for this type of offence \"in order to send out the strongest possible message that such acts will not be tolerated\".\n\nOn 2 October 2010, Gavin Quinnell of the Welsh regional team Scarlets suffered an eye injury 30 minutes into a game between Scarlets feeder club Llanelli and Cross Keys. The following Thursday it was confirmed that, despite the best efforts of surgeons, he had lost the sight in his left eye. The incident is currently being investigated by the Welsh Rugby Union and Gwent Police. Clarence Harding, an amateur player, lost sight in his right eye after an incident. On 24 November 2010 the player alleged to have been responsible was cleared of all charges due to lack of evidence.\n\n"}
{"id": "14901871", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14901871", "title": "Didactic organisation", "text": "Didactic organisation\n\nDidactic organisation is the ability of neurons within a network to impart their pattern of synaptic connectivity and/or response properties to other neurons. The term didactic is used because this kind of influence is unidirectional; each individual instance of didactic organisation between two connected neurons does not involve a bidirectional transfer of connectivity or response property information between them.\n\nEvidence for didactic organisation \"in vivo\" was first discovered through research into synaptic reorganisation in primary visual cortex that compared the results of neuronal recording experiments and computational models. However, the tendency of spike-timing-dependent plasticity to separate neurons into ‘teachers’ and ‘students’ had previously been predicted in theory based on computational modelling results alone.\n\nDidactic organisation is primarily a consequence of spike-timing-dependent plasticity, because when the neurons within an interconnected network undergo action potentials (or ‘spikes’) at approximately the same time (within the order of tens of milliseconds) the efferent synaptic connections of neurons that spike early will have their efficacy increased (long-term potentiation), while neurons that spike late will have the efficacy of their efferent synaptic connections decreased (long-term depression).\n\nWhile spike-timing-dependent plasticity is an essential ingredient for didactic organisation, other features of neuronal activity appear to be required for didactic organisation to occur \"in vivo\". One of these features is that activity propagated through a network needs to have a 'causal' character. For example, chain of reciprocally connected neurons with this ‘causal activity’ characteristic would be capable of propagating a wave of spikes along its length, rather than the wave disintegrating into a cascade of spikes ‘bouncing’ back and forth between neurons in the chain.\n\nA third important feature for didactic organisation in vivo concerns the spatial scale of spike propagation within a network. While it is expected that didactic organisation will always be present among neurons that exhibit spike timing-dependent plasticity and causal activity (see above), the spatial scale over which didactic organisation can occur between neurons within a network should be limited by the spatial scale of spike propagation. Evidence suggests that the scale of spike propagation can be actively controlled by adjusting the balance of excitation and inhibition within a network (a balance that can be modulated by synaptic scaling, for example), thus providing a means by which a network can actively control when and to what extent didactic organisation can occur. For this reason, and the very specific connectivity patterns that can be achieved via didactic organisation, it has been speculated that didactic organisation may play an important role in brain development.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "783925", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=783925", "title": "Emergentism", "text": "Emergentism\n\nIn philosophy, emergentism is the belief in emergence, particularly as it involves consciousness and the philosophy of mind, and as it contrasts (or not) with reductionism. A property of a system is said to be emergent if it is a new outcome of some other properties of the system and their interaction, while it is itself different from them. Emergent properties are not identical with, reducible to, or deducible from the other properties. The different ways in which this independence requirement can be satisfied lead to variant types of emergence.\n\nAll varieties of emergentism strive to be compatible with physicalism, the theory that the universe is composed exclusively of physical entities, and in particular with the evidence relating changes in the brain with changes in mental functioning. Many forms of emergentism, including proponents of complex adaptive systems, do not hold a material but rather a relational or processural view of the universe. Furthermore, they view mind–body dualism as a conceptual error insofar as mind and body are merely different types of relationships. As a theory of mind (which it is not always), emergentism differs from idealism, eliminative materialism, identity theories, neutral monism, panpsychism, and substance dualism, whilst being closely associated with property dualism. It is generally not obvious whether an emergent theory of mind embraces mental causation or must be considered epiphenomenal.\n\nSome varieties of emergentism are not specifically concerned with the mind–body problem, and instead suggest a hierarchical or layered view of the whole of nature, with the layers arranged in terms of increasing complexity with each requiring its own special science. Typically physics (mathematical physics, particle physics, and classical physics) is basic, with chemistry built on top of it, then biology, psychology, and social sciences. Reductionists respond that the arrangement of the sciences is a matter of convenience, and that chemistry is derivable from physics (and so forth) \"in principle\", an argument which gained force after the establishment of a quantum-mechanical basis for chemistry.\n\nOther varieties see mind or consciousness as specifically and anomalously requiring emergentist explanation, and therefore constitute a family of positions in the philosophy of mind. Douglas Hofstadter summarises this view as \"the soul is more than the sum of its parts\". A number of philosophers have offered the argument that qualia constitute the hard problem of consciousness, and resist reductive explanation in a way that all other phenomena do not. In contrast, reductionists generally see the task of accounting for the possibly atypical properties of mind and of living things as a matter of showing that, contrary to appearances, such properties are indeed fully accountable in terms of the properties of the basic constituents of nature and therefore in no way genuinely atypical.\n\nIntermediate positions are possible: for instance, some emergentists hold that emergence is neither universal nor restricted to consciousness, but applies to (for instance) living creatures, or self-organising systems, or complex systems.\n\nSome philosophers hold that emergent properties causally interact with more fundamental levels, an idea known as downward causation. Others maintain that higher-order properties simply supervene over lower levels without direct causal interaction.\n\nAll the cases so far discussed have been synchronic, i.e. the emergent property exists simultaneously with its basis.\nYet another variation operates diachronically. Emergentists of this type believe that \"genuinely novel properties\" can come into being, without being accountable in terms of the preceding history of the universe. (Contrast with indeterminism where it is only the \"arrangement or configuration\" of matter that is unaccountable). These evolution-inspired theories often have a theological aspect, as in the process philosophy of Alfred North Whitehead and Charles Hartshorne.\n\nA refinement of vitalism may be recognized in contemporary molecular histology in the proposal that some key organising and structuring features of organisms, perhaps including even life itself, are examples of emergent processes; those in which a complexity arises, out of interacting chemical processes forming interconnected feedback cycles, that cannot fully be described in terms of those processes since the system as a whole has properties that the constituent reactions lack.\n\nWhether emergent system properties should be grouped with traditional vitalist concepts is a matter of semantic controversy. In a light-hearted millennial vein, Kirshner and Michison call research into integrated cell and organismal physiology “molecular vitalism.”\n\nAccording to Emmeche \"et al.\" (1997):\n\n\"On the one hand, many scientists and philosophers regard emergence as having only a pseudo-scientific status. On the other hand, new developments in physics, biology, psychology, and crossdisciplinary fields such as cognitive science, artificial life, and the study of non-linear dynamical systems have focused strongly on the high level 'collective behaviour' of complex systems, which is often said to be truly emergent, and the term is increasingly used to characterize such systems.\"\nEmmeche \"et al.\" (1998) state that \"there is a very important difference between the vitalists and the emergentists: the vitalist's creative forces were relevant only in organic substances, not in inorganic matter. Emergence hence is creation of new properties regardless of the substance involved.\" \"The assumption of an extra-physical vitalis (vital force, entelechy, élan vital, etc.), as formulated in most forms (old or new) of vitalism, is usually without any genuine explanatory power. It has served altogether too often as an intellectual tranquilizer or verbal sedative—stifling scientific inquiry rather than encouraging it to proceed in new directions.\"\n\nJohn Stuart Mill outlined his version of emergentism in \"System of Logic\" (1843). Mill argued that the properties of some physical systems, such as those in which dynamic forces combine to produce simple motions, are subject to a law of nature he called the \"Composition of Causes\". According to Mill, emergent properties are not subject to this law, but instead amount to more than the sums of the properties of their parts.\n\nMill believed that various chemical reactions (poorly understood in his time) could provide examples of emergent properties, although some critics believe that modern physical chemistry has shown that these reactions can be given satisfactory reductionist explanations. For instance, it has been claimed by Dirac that the whole of chemistry is, in principle,\ncontained in the Schrödinger equation.\n\nBritish philosopher C. D. Broad defended a realistic epistemology in \"The Mind and its Place in Nature\" (1925) arguing that emergent materialism is the most likely solution to the mind–body problem.\n\nBroad defined emergence as follows:\nPut in abstract terms the emergent theory asserts that there are certain wholes, composed (say)\nof constituents A, B, and C in a relation R to each other; that all wholes composed of\nconstituents of the same kind as A, B, and C in relations of the same kind as R have certain\ncharacteristic properties; that A, B, and C are capable of occurring in other kinds of complex\nwhere the relation is not of the same kind as R; and that the characteristic properties of the\nwhole R(A, B, C) cannot, even in theory, be deduced from the most complete knowledge of\nthe properties of A, B, and C in isolation or in other wholes which are not of the form R(A, B,\nC).\nThis definition amounted to the claim that mental properties would count as emergent if and only if philosophical zombies were metaphysically possible. Many philosophers take this position to be inconsistent with some formulations of psychophysical supervenience.\n\nSamuel Alexander's views on emergentism, argued in \"Space, Time, and Deity\" (1920), were inspired in part by the ideas in psychologist C. Lloyd Morgan's \"Emergent Evolution\". Alexander believed that emergence was fundamentally inexplicable, and that emergentism was simply a \"brute empirical fact\":\n\n\"The higher quality emerges from the lower level of existence and has its roots therein, but it emerges therefrom, and it does not belong to that level, but constitutes its possessor a new order of existent with its special laws of behaviour. The existence of emergent qualities thus described is something to be noted, as some would say, under the compulsion of brute empirical fact, or, as I should prefer to say in less harsh terms, to be accepted with the “natural piety” of the investigator. It admits no explanation.\" (Space, Time, and Deity)\n\nDespite the causal and explanatory gap between the phenomena on different levels, Alexander held that emergent qualities were \"not\" epiphenomenal. His view can perhaps best be described as a form of non-reductive physicalism (NRP) or supervenience theory.\n\nLudwig von Bertalanffy founded general system theory (GST), which is a more contemporary approach to emergentism. A popularization of many of the elements of GST may be found in \"The Web of Life\" by Fritjof Capra.\n\nAddressing emergentism (under the guise of non-reductive physicalism) as a solution to the mind–body problem Jaegwon Kim has raised an objection based on causal closure and overdetermination.\n\nEmergentism strives to be compatible with physicalism, and physicalism, according to Kim, has a principle of causal closure according to which every physical event is fully accountable in terms of physical causes. This seems to leave no \"room\"\nfor mental causation to operate. If our bodily movements were caused by the preceding state of our bodies \"and\" our decisions and intentions, they would be overdetermined. Mental causation in this sense is not\nthe same as free will, but is only the claim that mental states are causally relevant. If emergentists respond by abandoning the idea of mental causation, their position becomes a form of epiphenomenalism.\n\nIn detail: he proposes (using the chart on the right) that \"M1\" causes \"M2\" (these are mental events) and \"P1\" causes \"P2\" (these are physical events). \"P1\" realises \"M1\" and \"P2\" realises \"M2\". However \"M1\" does not causally effect \"P1\" (i.e., \"M1\" is a consequent event of \"P1\"). If \"P1\" causes \"P2\", and \"M1\" is a result of \"P1\", then \"M2\" is a result of \"P2\". He says that the only alternatives to this problem is to accept dualism (where the mental events are independent of the physical events) or eliminativism (where the mental events do not exist).\n\n"}
{"id": "20756869", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20756869", "title": "Eusociality", "text": "Eusociality\n\nEusociality (from Greek εὖ \"eu\" \"good\" and social), the highest level of organization of animal sociality, is defined by the following characteristics: cooperative brood care (including care of offspring from other individuals), overlapping generations within a colony of adults, and a division of labor into reproductive and non-reproductive groups. The division of labor creates specialized behavioral groups within an animal society which are sometimes called castes. Eusociality is distinguished from all other social systems because individuals of at least one caste usually lose the ability to perform at least one behavior characteristic of individuals in another caste.\n\nEusociality exists in certain insects, crustaceans and mammals. It is mostly observed and studied in the Hymenoptera (ants, bees, and wasps) and in termites. A colony has caste differences: queens and reproductive males take the roles of the sole reproducers, while soldiers and workers work together to create a living situation favorable for the brood. In addition to Hymenoptera and Isoptera, there are two known eusocial vertebrates among rodents: the naked mole-rat and the Damaraland mole-rat. Some shrimps, such as \"Synalpheus regalis\", are also eusocial. E. O. Wilson has claimed that humans are eusocial, but his arguments have been disputed by a large number of evolutionary biologists, who note that humans do not have division of reproductive labor.\n\nSeveral other levels of animal sociality have been distinguished. These include presocial (solitary but social), subsocial, and parasocial (including communal, quasisocial, and semisocial).\n\nThe term \"eusocial\" was introduced in 1966 by Suzanne Batra who used it to describe nesting behavior in Halictine bees. Batra observed the cooperative behavior of the bees, males and females alike, as they took responsibility for at least one duty (i.e. burrowing, cell construction, oviposition) within the colony. The cooperativeness was essential as the activity of one labor division greatly influenced the activity of another.\n\nFor example, the size of pollen balls, a source of food, depended on when the egg-laying females oviposited. If the provisioning by pollen collectors was incomplete by the time the egg-laying female occupied a cell and oviposited, the size of the pollen balls would be small, leading to small offspring. Batra applied this term to species in which a colony is started by a single individual. Batra described other species, where the founder is accompanied by numerous helpers—as in a swarm of bees or ants—as \"hypersocial\".\n\nIn 1969, Charles D. Michener further expanded Batra’s classification with his comparative study of social behavior in bees. He observed multiple species of bees (Apoidea) in order to investigate the different levels of animal sociality, all of which are different stages that a colony may pass through. Eusociality, which is the highest level of animal sociality a species can attain, specifically had three characteristics that distinguished it from the other levels:\n\n\nE. O. Wilson then extended the terminology to include other social insects; such as ants, wasps, and termites. Originally, it was defined to include organisms (only invertebrates) that had the following three features:\n\n\nAs eusociality became a recognized widespread phenomenon, however, it was also discovered in a group of chordates, the mole-rats. Further research also distinguished another possibly important criterion for eusociality, known as \"the point of no return\". This is characterized by eusocial individuals that become fixed into one behavioral group, which usually occurs before reproductive maturity. This prevents them from transitioning between behavioral groups and creates an animal society that is truly dependent on each other for survival and reproductive success. For many insects, this irreversibility has changed the anatomy of the worker caste, which is sterile and provides support for the reproductive caste.\n\nMost eusocial societies exist in arthropods, while a few are found in mammals.\n\nThe order Hymenoptera contains the largest group of eusocial insects, including ants, bees, and waspsthose with reproductive \"queens\" and more or less sterile \"workers\" and/or \"soldiers\" that perform specialized tasks. For example, in the well-studied social wasp \"Polistes versicolor\", dominant females perform tasks such as building new cells and ovipositing, while subordinate females tend to perform tasks like feeding the larvae and foraging. The task differentiation between castes can be seen in the fact that subordinates complete 81.4% of the total foraging activity, while dominants only complete 18.6% of the total foraging.\n\nWhile only a moderate percentage of species in bees (families Apidae and Halictidae) and wasps (Crabronidae and Vespidae) are eusocial, nearly all species of ants (Formicidae) are eusocial. Some major lineages within these groups are mostly or entirely eusocial, as well, such as the bee tribes Apini, Bombini, Euglossini, and Meliponini, and the wasp subfamilies Polistinae and Vespinae. Eusociality in these families is sometimes managed by a set of pheromones that alter the behavior of specific castes in the colony. These pheromones may act across different species, as observed in \"Apis andreniformis\" (black dwarf honey bee), where worker bees responded to queen pheromone from the related \"Apis florea\" (red dwarf honey bee). Pheromones are sometimes used in these castes to assist with foraging. Workers of the Australian stingless bee \"Tetragonula carbonaria\", for instance, mark food sources with a pheromone, helping their nest mates to find the food.\n\nReproductive specialization generally involves the production of sterile members of the species, which carry out specialized tasks to care for the reproductive members. It can manifest in the appearance of individuals within a group whose behavior or morphology is modified for group defense, including self-sacrificing behavior (\"altruism\"). An example of a species whose sterile caste displays this altruistic behavior is \"Myrmecocystus mexicanus\", one of the species of honey ant. Select sterile workers fill their abdomens with liquid food until they become immobile and hang from the ceilings of the underground nests, acting as food storage for the rest of the colony. Not all social species of insects have distinct morphological differences between castes. For example, in the Neotropical social wasp \"Synoeca surinama, \"social displays determine the caste ranks of individuals in the developing brood. These castes are sometimes further specialized in their behavior based on age. For example,\" Scaptotrigona postica\" workers assume different roles in the nest based on their age. Between approximately 0–40 days old, the workers perform tasks within the nest such as provisioning cell broods, colony cleaning, and nectar reception and dehydration. Once older than 40 days, \"Scaptotrigona postica\" workers move outside of the nest to practice colony defense and foraging.\n\nIn \"Lasioglossum aeneiventre\", a halictid bee from Central America, nests may be headed by more than one female; such nests have more cells, and the number of active cells per female is correlated with the number of females in the nest, implying that having more females leads to more efficient building and provisioning of cells. In similar species with only one queen, such as \"Lasioglossum malachurum\" in Europe, the degree of eusociality depends on the clime in which the species is found.\n\nTermites (order Blattodea, infraorder Isoptera) make up another large portion of highly advanced eusocial animals. The colony is differentiated into various castes: the queen and king are the sole reproducing individuals; workers forage and maintain food and resources; and soldiers defend the colony against ant attacks. The latter two castes, which are sterile and perform highly specialized, complex social behaviors, are derived from different stages of pluripotent larvae produced by the reproductive caste. Some soldiers have jaws so enlarged (specialized for defense and attack) that they are unable to feed themselves and must be fed by workers.\n\n\"Austroplatypus incompertus\" is a species of ambrosia beetle native to Australia, and is the first beetle (order Coleoptera) to be recognized as eusocial. This species forms colonies in which a single female is fertilized, and is protected by many unfertilized females, which also serve as workers excavating tunnels in trees. This species also participates in cooperative brood care, in which individuals care for juveniles that are not their own.\n\nSome species of gall-inducing insects, including the gall-forming aphid, \"Pemphigus spyrothecae\" (order Hemiptera), and thrips (order Thysanoptera), were also described as eusocial. These species have very high relatedness among individuals due to their partially asexual mode of reproduction (sterile soldier castes being clones of the reproducing female), but the gall-inhabiting behavior gives these species a defensible resource that sets them apart from related species with similar genetics. They produce soldier castes capable of fortress defense and protection of their colony against both predators and competitors. In these groups, therefore, high relatedness alone does not lead to the evolution of social behavior, but requires that groups occur in a restricted, shared area. These species have morphologically distinct soldier castes that defend against kleptoparasites (parasitism by theft) and are able to reproduce parthenogenetically (without fertilization).\n\nEusociality has also arisen three different times among some crustaceans that live in separate colonies. \"Synalpheus regalis\", \"Synalpheus filidigitus\", and \"Synalpheus chacei\", three species of parasitic shrimp that rely on fortress defense and live in groups of closely related individuals in tropical reefs and sponges, live eusocially with a single breeding female and a large number of male defenders, armed with enlarged snapping claws. As with other eusocial societies, there is a single shared living space for the colony members, and the non-breeding members act to defend it.\n\nThe fortress defense hypothesis additionally points out that because sponges provide both food and shelter, there is an aggregation of relatives (because the shrimp do not have to disperse to find food), and much competition for those nesting sites. Being the target of attack promotes a good defense system (soldier caste); soldiers therefore promote the fitness of the whole nest by ensuring safety and reproduction of the queen.\n\nEusociality offers a competitive advantage in shrimp populations. Eusocial species were found to be more abundant, occupy more of the habitat, and use more of the available resources than non-eusocial species. Other studies add to these findings by pointing out that cohabitation was more rare than expected by chance, and that most sponges were dominated by one species, which was frequently eusocial.\n\nAmong mammals, eusociality is known in two species in the Bathyergidae, the naked mole-rat (\"Heterocephalus glaber\") and the Damaraland mole-rat (\"Fukomys damarensis\"), both of which are diploid and highly inbred. Usually living in harsh or limiting environments, these mole-rats aid in raising siblings and relatives born to a single reproductive queen. However, this classification is controversial owing to disputed definitions of 'eusociality'.\nTo avoid inbreeding, mole rats sometimes outbreed and establish new colonies when resources are sufficient. Most of the individuals cooperatively care for the brood of a single reproductive female (the queen) to which they are most likely related. Thus, it is uncertain whether mole rats classify as true eusocial organisms, since their social behavior depends largely on their resources and environment.\n\nSome mammals in the Carnivora and Primates exhibit eusocial tendencies. Perhaps most notable are meerkats (\"Suricata suricatta\") and dwarf mongooses (\"Helogale parvula\"). These show cooperative breeding and marked reproductive skews. In the dwarf mongoose, the breeding pair receives food priority and protection from subordinates and rarely has to defend against predators.\n\nAn early 21st century debate focused on whether humans are prosocial versus eusocial. Edward O. Wilson, in his controversial 2012 book, \"The Social Conquest of the Earth\", referred to humans as a species of eusocial ape. He supported his reasoning by stating our eusocial similarities to ants, and by observing that early hominins cooperated to rear their children while other members of the same group hunted and foraged; he noted that all eusocial species went through just such a stage of collective rearing. Humans also fall under some of Wilson's original criteria of eusociality (some kind of division of labor, overlapping generations, and cooperative care of young including ones that are not their own). Wilson argued that through cooperation and teamwork, ants and humans gain a type of \"superpower\" that is unavailable to other social animals that have failed to make the leap from social to eusocial. In his view, eusociality creates the superorganism.\n\nWilson's claims created a vigorous debate. Summarizing the positions taken, Herbert Gintis noted that Wilson explicitly diverged from the general view that human sociality is accounted for by W. D. Hamilton's inclusive fitness theory, formulating instead a controversial theory of group selection. Wilson's claims, especially as formulated in his 2010 paper with Nowak and Tarnita, were \"vigorously rejected\" by up to 134 scientists at a time, writing in the same journal, \"Nature\", as well as by well-known individuals such as Richard Dawkins and Steven Pinker. Dawkins noted that human groups involve many unrelated families who may cooperate to a high level, but do not have reproductive division of labor. Gintis further observed that biological altruism cannot exist in \"advanced eusocial species\", because altruism by definition reduces fitness: but non-reproductive workers already have a fitness of zero. Gintis thus agreed with Dawkins that humans are not eusocial, though he suggested some changes to Hamilton's rule to make it more complete.\n\nEusociality is a rare but widespread phenomenon in species in at least seven orders in the animal kingdom, as shown in the phylogenetic tree (non-eusocial groups not shown). All species of termites are eusocial, and it is believed that they were the first eusocial animals to evolve, sometime in the upper Jurassic period (~150 million years ago). The other orders shown also contain non-eusocial species, including many lineages where eusociality was inferred to be the ancestral state. Thus the number of independent evolutions of eusociality is still under investigation. The major eusocial groups are shown in boldface in the phylogenetic tree.\n\nPrior to the gene-centered view of evolution, eusociality was seen as an apparent evolutionary paradox: if adaptive evolution unfolds by differential reproduction of individual organisms, how can individuals incapable of passing on their genes evolve and persist? In \"On the Origin of Species\", Darwin referred to the existence of sterile castes as the \"one special difficulty, which at first appeared to me insuperable, and actually fatal to my theory\". Darwin anticipated that a possible resolution to the paradox might lie in the close family relationship, which W.D. Hamilton quantified a century later with his 1964 inclusive fitness theory. After the gene-centered view of evolution was developed in the mid 1970s, non-reproductive individuals were seen as an extended phenotype of the genes, which are the primary beneficiaries of natural selection.\n\nAccording to inclusive fitness theory, organisms can gain fitness not just through increasing their own reproductive output, but also via increasing the reproductive output of other individuals that share their genes, especially their close relatives. Individuals are selected to help their relatives when the cost of helping is less than the benefit gained by their relative multiplied by the fraction of genes that they share, i.e. when \"Cost < relatedness * Benefit\". Under inclusive fitness theory, the necessary conditions for eusociality to evolve are more easily fulfilled by haplodiploid species because of their unusual relatedness structure.\n\nIn haplodiploid species, females develop from fertilized eggs and males develop from unfertilized eggs. Because a male is haploid, his daughters share 100% of his genes and 50% of their mother's. Therefore, they share 75% of their genes with each other. This mechanism of sex determination gives rise to what W. D. Hamilton first termed \"supersisters\" which are more related to their sisters than they would be to their own offspring. Even though workers often do not reproduce, they can potentially pass on more of their genes by helping to raise their sisters than they would by having their own offspring (each of which would only have 50% of their genes). This unusual situation, where females may have greater fitness when they help rear siblings rather than producing offspring, is often invoked to explain the multiple independent evolutions of eusociality (arising at least nine separate times) within the haplodiploid group Hymenoptera.\n\nHowever, not all eusocial species are haplodiploid (termites, some snapping shrimps, and mole rats are not). Conversely, many bees are haplodiploid yet are not eusocial, and among eusocial species many queens mate with multiple males, resulting in a hive of half-sisters that share only 25% of their genes. The association between haplodiploidy and eusociality is below statistical significance. Haplodiploidy alone is thus neither necessary nor sufficient for eusociality to emerge. However relatedness does still play a part, as monogamy (queens mating singly) has been shown to be the ancestral state for all eusocial species so far investigated.\n\nMany scientists citing the close phylogenetic relationships between eusocial and non-eusocial species are making the case that environmental factors are especially important in the evolution of eusociality. The relevant factors primarily involve the distribution of food and predators.\n\nIncreased parasitism and predation rates are the primary ecological drivers of social organization. Group living affords colony members defense against enemies, specifically predators, parasites, and competitors, and allows them to gain advantage from superior foraging methods.\n\nWith the exception of some aphids, all eusocial species live in a communal nest which provides both shelter and access to food resources. Mole rats and ants live in underground burrows; wasps, bees, and some termites build above-ground hives; thrips and aphids inhabit galls (neoplastic outgrowths) induced on plants; ambrosia beetles and some termites nest together in dead wood; and snapping shrimp inhabit crevices in marine sponges. For many species the habitat outside the nest is often extremely arid or barren, creating such a high cost to dispersal that the chance to take over the colony following parental death is greater than the chance of dispersing to form a new colony. Defense of such fortresses from both predators and competitors often favors the evolution of non-reproductive soldier castes, while the high costs of nest construction and expansion favor non-reproductive worker castes.\n\nThe importance of ecology is supported by evidence such as experimentally induced reproductive division of labor, for example when normally solitary queens are forced together. Conversely, female Damaraland mole-rats undergo hormonal changes that promote dispersal after periods of high rainfall, supporting the plasticity of eusocial traits in response to environmental cues.\n\nClimate also appears to be a selective agent driving social complexity; across bee lineages and Hymenoptera in general, higher forms of sociality are more likely to occur in tropical than temperate environments. Similarly, social transitions within Halictidae bees, where eusociality has been gained and lost multiple times, are correlated with periods of climatic warming. Social behavior in facultative social bees is often reliably predicted by ecological conditions, and switches in behavioral type have been experimentally induced by translocating offspring of solitary or social populations to warm and cool climates. In \"H. rubicundus\", solitary females produce a single brood in cooler regions and social females produce two broods in warmer regions. In another species of sweat bees, \"L. calceatum\", social phenotype has been predicted by altitude and micro-habitat composition, with social nests found in warmer, sunnier sites, and solitary nests found in adjacent, cooler, shaded locations.\n\nOnce pre-adaptations such as group formation, nest building, high cost of dispersal, and morphological variation are present, between-group competition has been cited as a quintessential force in the transition to advanced eusociality. Because the hallmarks of eusociality will produce an extremely altruistic society, such groups will out-reproduce their less cooperative competitors, eventually eliminating all non-eusocial groups from a species. Multilevel selection has however been heavily criticized by some for its conflict with the kin selection theory.\n\nA reversal to solitarity is an evolutionary phenomenon in which descendants of a eusocial group evolve solitary behavior once again. Bees have been model organisms for the study of reversal to solitarity, because of the diversity of their social systems. Each of the four origins of eusociality in bees was followed by at least one reversal to solitarity, giving a total of at least nine reversals. This suggests that eusociality is costly to maintain, and can only persist when ecological variables favor it. Disadvantages of eusociality include the cost of investing in non-reproductive offspring, and an increased risk of disease.\n\nAll reversals to solitarity have occurred among primitively eusocial groups; none have followed the emergence of advanced eusociality. The \"point of no return\" hypothesis posits that the morphological differentiation of reproductive and non-reproductive castes prevents highly eusocial species such as the honeybee from reverting to the solitary state.\n\nAn understanding of the physiological causes and consequences of the eusocial condition has been somewhat slow; nonetheless, major advancements have been made in learning more about the mechanistic and developmental processes that lead to eusociality.\n\nPheromones are thought to play an important role in the physiological mechanisms underlying the development and maintenance of eusociality. In fact the evolution of enzymes involved both in the production and perception of pheromones has been shown to be important for the emergence of eusociality both within termites and in Hymenoptera. The most well-studied queen pheromone system in social insects is that of the honey bee \"Apis mellifera\". Queen mandibular glands were found to produce a mixture of five compounds, three aliphatic and two aromatic, which have been found to control workers. Mandibular gland extracts inhibit workers from constructing queen cells in which new queens are reared which can delay the hormonally based behavioral development of workers and can suppress ovarian development in workers. Both behavioral effects mediated by the nervous system often leading to recognition of queens (releaser) and physiological effects on the reproductive and endocrine system (primer) are attributed to the same pheromones. These pheromones volatilize or are deactivated within thirty minutes, allowing workers to respond rapidly to the loss of their queen.\n\nThe levels of two of the aliphatic compounds increase rapidly in virgin queens within the first week after eclosion (emergence from the pupal case), which is consistent with their roles as sex attractants during the mating flight. It is only after a queen is mated and begins laying eggs, however, that the full blend of compounds is made. The physiological factors regulating reproductive development and pheromone production are unknown.\n\nIn several ant species, reproductive activity has also been associated with pheromone production by queens. In general, mated egg laying queens are attractive to workers whereas young winged virgin queens, which are not yet mated, elicit little or no response. However, very little is known about when pheromone production begins during the initiation of reproductive activity or about the physiological factors regulating either reproductive development or queen pheromone production in ants.\n\nAmong ants, the queen pheromone system of the fire ant \"Solenopsis invicta\" is particularly well studied. Both releaser and primer pheromones have been demonstrated in this species. A queen recognition (releaser) hormone is stored in the poison sac along with three other compounds. These compounds were reported to elicit a behavioral response from workers. Several primer effects have also been demonstrated. Pheromones initiate reproductive development in new winged females, called female sexuals. These chemicals also inhibit workers from rearing male and female sexuals, suppress egg production in other queens of multiple queen colonies and cause workers to execute excess queens. The action of these pheromones together maintains the eusocial phenotype which includes one queen supported by sterile workers and sexually active males (drones). In queenless colonies that lack such pheromones, winged females will quickly shed their wings, develop ovaries and lay eggs. These virgin replacement queens assume the role of the queen and even start to produce queen pheromones. There is also evidence that queen weaver ants \"Oecophylla longinoda\" have a variety of exocrine glands that produce pheromones, which prevent workers from laying reproductive eggs.\n\nSimilar mechanisms are used for the eusocial wasp species \"Vespula vulgaris\". In order for a \"Vespula vulgaris\" queen to dominate all the workers, usually numbering more than 3000 in a colony, she exerts pheromone to signal her dominance. The workers were discovered to regularly lick the queen while feeding her, and the air-borne pheromone from the queen's body alerts those workers of her dominance.\n\nThe mode of action of inhibitory pheromones which prevent the development of eggs in workers has been convincingly demonstrated in the bumble bee \"Bombus terrestris\". In this species, pheromones suppress activity of the corpora allata and juvenile hormone (JH) secretion. The corpora allata is an endocrine gland that produces JH, a group of hormones that regulate many aspects of insect physiology. With low JH, eggs do not mature. Similar inhibitory effects of lowering JH were seen in halictine bees and polistine wasps, but not in honey bees.\n\nA variety of strategies in addition to the use of pheromones have evolved that give the queens of different species of social insects a measure of reproductive control over their nest mates. In many Polistes wasp colonies, monogamy is established soon after colony formation by physical dominance interactions among foundresses of the colony including biting, chasing and food soliciting. Such interactions created a dominance hierarchy headed by individuals with the greatest ovarian development. Larger, older individuals often have an advantage during the establishment of dominance hierarchies. The rank of subordinates is positively correlated with the degree of ovarian development and the highest ranking individual usually becomes queen if the established queen disappears. Workers do not oviposit when queens are present because of a variety of reasons: colonies tend to be small enough that queens can effectively dominate workers, queens practice selective oophagy or egg eating, or the flow of nutrients favors queen over workers and queens rapidly lay eggs in new or vacated cells. However, it is also possible that morphological differences favor the worker. In certain species of wasps, such as \"Apoica flavissima\" queens are smaller than their worker counterparts. This can lead to interesting worker-queen dynamics, often with the worker policing queen behaviors. Other wasps, like \"Polistes instabilis\" have workers with the potential to develop into reproductives, but only in cases where there are no queens to suppress them.\n\nIn primitively eusocial bees (where castes are morphologically similar and colonies usually small and short-lived), queens frequently nudge their nest mates and then burrow back down into the nest. This behavior draws workers into the lower part of the nest where they may respond to stimuli for cell construction and maintenance. Being nudged by the queen may play a role in inhibiting ovarian development and this form of queen control is supplemented by oophagy of worker laid eggs. Furthermore, temporally discrete production of workers and gynes (actual or potential queens) can cause size dimorphisms between different castes as size is strongly influenced by the season during which the individual is reared. In many wasp species worker caste determination is characterized by a temporal pattern in which workers precede non-workers of the same generation. In some cases, for example in the bumble bee, queen control weakens late in the season and the ovaries of workers develop to an increasing extent. The queen attempts to maintain her dominance by aggressive behavior and by eating worker laid eggs; her aggression is often directed towards the worker with the greatest ovarian development.\n\nIn highly eusocial wasps (where castes are morphologically dissimilar), both the quantity and quality of food seem to be important for caste differentiation. Recent studies in wasps suggest that differential larval nourishment may be the environmental trigger for larval divergence into one of two developmental classes destined to become either a worker or a gyne. All honey bee larvae are initially fed with royal jelly, which is secreted by workers, but normally they are switched over to a diet of pollen and honey as they mature; if their diet is exclusively royal jelly, however, they grow larger than normal and differentiate into queens. This jelly seems to contain a specific protein, designated as royalactin, which increases body size, promotes ovary development and shortens the developmental time period. Furthermore, the differential expression in \"Polistes\" of larval genes and proteins (also differentially expressed during queen versus caste development in honey bees) indicate that regulatory mechanisms may occur very early in development.\n\nSubsequent to Edward O. Wilson's original definition, other authors have sought to narrow or expand the definition of eusociality by focusing on the nature and degree of the division of labor, which was not originally specified. A narrower and more widely accepted definition specifies the requirement for irreversibly distinct behavioral groups or castes (with respect to sterility and/or other features). Such a definition, however, excludes social vertebrates, like the mole rats, and some Hymenoptera species, like the weaver ants.\n\nFor example, depending on the availability of resources and the condition of the environment, mole rats can change between different types of social behaviors. In 2005, according to Wilson and Hölldobler, these types of animals would be considered primitively eusocial, which is different from eusocial, since the labor division is not permanent. A broader definition, on the other hand, would include mole rats because it allows for any temporary division of labor or non-random distribution of reproductive success to constitute eusociality.\n\nIn 2010, Nowak, Tarnita and Wilson challenged the theoretical explanation of the evolution of eusociality. Based on the concept of inclusive fitness, the kin selection theory considers the relatedness of individuals to be one of the most important factors that lead to eusociality. This brought up issues like the irrelevance of haplodiploidy and maternal control. Nowak et al. argued that the kin selection theory is inadequate because it can explain only a subset of eusocial populations due to its assumptions (i.e. \"all interactions must be additive and pairwise\" which excludes any interaction that involves more than two players). To them, the standard natural selection theory, which is a more general approach than the current explanation of eusociality, is the appropriate theory to use since it explains the same phenomenon and it would work for a larger number of eusocial cases. It also requires simpler mathematical calculations when explaining the evolution of eusociality. This paper led to a large influx of publications that refuted Nowak et al.'s ideas and supported the validity and specificity of the kin selection theory. Among these, Trivers and Hare studied the haplodiploid Hymenoptera, finding that the workers were able to win the parent-offspring conflict, countering the parents' best interest and selecting the outcome that has the greater benefit for the workers (i.e. reproductive success with higher relatedness to workers than the queen). This refuted Nowak et al.'s defense that future offspring development could be based solely on the fitness of parents.\n\n\n"}

The basic premise of the book is that if middle aged people can live long enough, until approximately 120, they will be able to live forever—as humanity overcomes all diseases and old age itself. This might also be considered a break-even scenario where developments made during a year increase life expectancy by more than one year. Biogerontologist Aubrey de Grey called this the \"Longevity escape velocity\" in a 2005 TED talk.\n\nThe book focuses primarily on health topics such as heart disease, cancer, and type 2 diabetes. It promotes lifestyle changes such as a low glycemic index diet, calorie restriction, exercise, drinking green tea and alkalinized water, and other changes to daily living. They also promote aggressive supplementation to make up for nutrient deficiencies they believe are common in Western society. In contrast to his previous book \"The 10% Solution for a Healthy Life\", in which he recommended a diet with 10% of calories from fat, in this book, Kurzweil recommends consuming less than one third of calories from carbohydrates (and less than one sixth of calories in his low-carbohydrate diet) and consuming 25% of calories from fat.\n\nThe book states that the purpose of these changes is to obtain and maintain idyllic health so that an individual can extend his or her life as long as possible. The authors believe that within the next 20 to 50 years technology will advance to the point where much of the aging process will be conquered, and degenerative diseases eliminated. The book is peppered with side notes on these futuristic topics, showing how current research is leading us toward life extension, and explaining how future technologies such as nanotechnology and bioengineering might change the way humans live their lives. Ray Kurzweil discusses these topics at further length in his 2005 book \"The Singularity Is Near\".\n\nA follow-up on \"Fantastic Voyage\", \"Transcend: Nine Steps to Living Well Forever\", was released on April 28, 2009.\n\n\nOne claim in the book has been called pseudoscience. Dr. Stephen Lower, retired Professor of Chemistry at Simon Fraser University, disputes some of the book's statements about alkaline water on his web site. Kurzweil and Grossman counter this specific criticism directly in their Reader Q&A.\n\n\n"}

And over the centuries, these registers became an important genealogical source for many families, part of splintered families, in tracing their family tree and family history as well, especially after the Partition of India in 1947, and later amongst the Indian diaspora,\n\nThis custom is similar to Panjis or Panji Prabandh, the extensive genealogical records maintained among Maithil Brahmins in Bihar.\n\nThis custom not well known today to Indians settled abroad, in an ancient custom detailed family genealogies of Hindu families for the past several generations are kept by professional Hindu Brahmin Pandits, popularly known as \"Pandas\", at the Hindu holy city of Haridwar in hand written registers passed down to them over generations by their Pandit ancestors which are classified according to original districts and villages of ones ancestors, with special designated Pandit families being in charge of designated district registers, even for cases where ancestral districts and villages that have been left behind in Pakistan after Partition of India with Hindus having to migrate to India.\nIn several cases present day descedents are now Sikhs, Muslims and Christians. It is not uncommon for one to find details of up to or even more than one's past seven generations in these genealogy registers kept by the \"Pandas of Haridwar\".\n\nFor centuries when Hindu ancestors visited the holy town of Haridwar for any purpose which may have mostly been for pilgrimage purposes or/and for cremation of their dead or for immersion of ashes and bones of their kin after cremation into the waters of the holy river Ganges as required by Hindu religious custom, it has been an ancient custom to go to the Pandit who is in charge of ones family register and update the family's genealogical family tree with details of all marriages, births and deaths from ones extended joint family.\n\nIn present day India people visiting Haridwar are dumbfounded when Pundits out of the blue solicit them to come and update their very own ancestral genealogical family tree, news travels like wildfire among the Pandits with ones family's designated Pandit being quickly notified of ones visit.

He is the first MacLeod chief to which heraldry can be assigned. Clan tradition states that he was a minor at the time of his father's death and for six years an incompetent guardian led the clan to its lowest point in clan history. After reaching the age of maturity, Iain Borb managed to acquire some of the clan's lost lands and led his clan and his kinsmen (the MacLeods of Lewis) in the Battle of Harlaw, in 1411. Iain Borb was wounded in the head during the conflict; the wound never completely healed and confined him to his home on Pabbay for much of his life. Tradition states that he died when this wound re-opened during a fencing/wrestling match. There is some disagreement as to which of his son's were the eldest; however, his son William Dubh was the one who finally succeeded to the chiefship, following his death in 1442.\n\nIain Borb was the son, and successor of William Cleireach, fifth chief of Clan MacLeod. According to the \"Bannatyne manuscript\", he was only ten years old at the time of his father's death. The manuscript relates how during his minority a guardian was chosen to lead the clan. This man's name was Iain Mishealbhach ('John the Unlucky') who was a cousin of the young Iain Borb. During Iain Mishealbhach's tenure as guardian, the MacLeods of Harris and Dunvegan were at their lowest point in their history. Many of the clan opposed the selection of Iain Mishealbhach, favouring instead Tormod Coil who slew Alastair Cannoch at the Battle of Sligachan. Tormod Coil defied the guardian and seized part of the lands of Glenelg.\n\nThe manuscript continues that the during this era, the MacDonalds took full advantage of the disorderedness of the MacLeods. A force of MacDonalds landed at Sleat and took possession of the castles of Dunscaith and Camus and in the process drove the MacLeods out of Sleat. They also invaded North Uist and fought the MacLeods at Cailus, where the MacLeods were completely defeated and further lands were gained by the invaders. Following these victories, the MacDonalds besieged Dunvegan Castle, where the widow of William Cleireach was living at the time. The chief of the MacLeods of Lewis, however, came in force and relieved the castle, defeating the MacDonalds at Fiorlig. Torquil then took the family to Lewis where they remained until Iain Borb reached the age of maturity.\n\nIain Borb's first act as chief, according to the manuscript, was to hang Iain Mishealbhach, confiscate the dead man's lands, and banish his family. Later, Iain Borb made an agreement with Domhnall, Lord of the Isles, in which the MacDonalds gave back the lands they won from the MacLeods—except the lands on North Uist. Iain Borb swore his vassalage to the Lord of the Isles and in accordance to this agreement fought under the MacDonalds at the Battle of Harlaw in 1411. During the battle, Iain Borb commanded all the MacLeods (including the MacLeods of Lewis) and the manuscript states that the MacLeods had the honour of fighting on the right of Domhnall's forces. Early 20th century Clan Donald historians A. and A. Macdonald, however, stated that both clans of MacLeods were in the main body of men commanded by Domhnall and that the right wing was made up of MacLeans, commanded by Hector MacLean of Duart (Red Hector of the Battles). The manuscript states how Iain Borb was wounded in the head during the conflict. The wound never entirely healed and for the rest of his life it would bleed whenever he became agitated. For the most part, Iain Borb lived at his castle on Pabbay, where he renovated and enlarged the fortress there. The manuscript tells how during a fencing match with his foster-brother, Somerled MacConn, Iain Borb's wound began to bleed so profusely that he bled to death.\n\nThe \"Bannatyne manuscript\" states that the first seven chiefs of Clan MacLeod were buried at Iona. The choir of Iona Abbey, for the most part, dates from the early 16th century. Within the centre of the choir there is a large stone which once contained a monumental brass, traditionally said to have been a MacLeod. The stone formed a matrix which at one time contained the brass inlay (tradition states it was a silver inlay). It is the largest carved stone on the island, measuring by . R.C. MacLeod speculated that perhaps the clan's founder, Leod, and five of his successors were buried beneath—however, in his opinion the fourth chief, Iain Ciar, was buried elsewhere.\n\nThe \"Bannatyne manuscript\" records that Iain Borb married a granddaughter of the Earl of Douglas. Several 20th-century clan historians named her Margaret. The couple had two sons, named \"William\" and \"Norman\" (\"Tormod\"), as well as two daughters. The manuscript maintains that Norman was the elder of the brothers, but that he died young and left a young son who was too young to succeed to the chiefship. In fact, William Dubh succeeded Iain Borb as chief of the clan. R.C. MacLeod considered the fact that the clan considered William chief and not guardian was evidence that William was in fact the elder brother. A. Morrison stated that Norman was probably an illegitimate son of Iain Borb and that he was considerably older than William, since Norman led the clan in battle in 1428. According to Morrison, Norman was killed in 1429 and that his posthumous son was the progenitor of the MacLeods of Waternish. D. MacKinnon stated that he led the MacLeods and was slain at the battle in Lochaber in 1429, supporting Alexander, Lord of the Isles against James I. MacKinnon stated that he married a daughter of Chisholm of Strathglass, and by her had his son, John.\n\nMorrison stated that Iain Borb's daughters were both born in wedlock. According to MacKinnon, one of the daughters, Margaret, married Roderick MacLeod of Lewis (6th clan chief). MacLeod stated that the other daughter married Lachlan MacLean, of Duart (7th chief of Clan MacLean). The late 19th-century clan historian A.M. Sinclair stated that her name was \"Finvola\" and noted that the couple had two sons, Neil and John Garbh. However, several years earlier another late 19th century Clan MacLean historian, J.P. MacLean named Lachlan's wife as \"Fionnaghal, daughter of William MacLeod of Harris\".\n\nIain Borb is the earliest MacLeod chief to which heraldry can be assigned. The coat of arms of the MacLeods of Harris and Dunvegan appear in the mid 15th century roll of arms \"Armorial de Berry\" (although the armorial actually lists the arms as those of \"Le sire de bes\"). The blazon is: \"azure, a castle triple-towered argent\". The castle may represent the seat of the chiefs—Dunvegan Castle, located on Skye.\n"}

It may or may not be reciprocal, and occurs in both endotherms and ectotherms. Its most common form is huddling.\n\nSome species of ectotherms including lizards and snakes, such as boa constrictors and tiger snakes, increase their effective mass by clustering tightly together. It is also widespread amongst gregarious endotherms such as bats and birds (such as the mousebird and emperor penguin) where it allows the sharing of body heat (particularly among juveniles).\n\nIn at least one case this is not reciprocal, and might be accurately described as \"heat-stealing\". Some male Canadian red sided garter snakes engage in female mimicry by producing fake pheromones after emerging from hibernation. This causes rival males to cover them in a mistaken attempt to mate, and so transfer heat to them. This allows those males that mimic females to become more quickly revitalized after hibernation (which depends upon raising their body temperature), giving them an advantage in their own attempts to mate.\n\nMany ectotherms exploit the heat produced by endotherms by sharing their nests and burrows. For example, mammal burrows are used by geckos and seabird burrows by Australian tiger snakes and New Zealand tuatara Termites create high and regulated temperatures in their mounds, and this is exploited by some species of lizards, snakes and crocodiles.\n\nResearch has shown such kleptothermy can be advantageous: the blue-lipped sea krait, when it occupies a burrow of a pair of wedge-tailed shearwater incubating their chick, raises its body temperature to compared to when in other habitats.

He also published the work \"Biblioteca Mexicana\". This was a compilation, a work of literary history, a dictionary of literary biography, and a bibliography, but Eguiara y Egure got only as far as the letter \"J\".\n\nEguiara's printing shop was acquired by Licenciado José de Jáuregui in 1767. The following year Jáuregui's establishment merged with that of heirs of María de Ribera. Jáuregui died in 1778, and the business passed to his heirs. In 1791 his nephew José Fernández Jáuregui took over the business and directed it until his death in 1800. His heir was María Fernández de Jáuregui. She died in 1815, and in 1817 the business was sold to Alejandro Valdés.\n\nValdés was already an established printer, having maintained his own print shop from 1808 to 1814. In 1815 he acquired the business of his famed father, Manuel Antonio Valdés y Munguía. The elder Valdés had been the printer for the Jesuit College of San Ildefonso until 1767. In that year he joined Felipe de Zúñiga y Ontiveros, at that time the largest printer in the Americas. While he was associated with Zúñiga y Ontiveros, Valdés y Munguía was the editor of the \"Gaceta de México\", after its reestablishment in 1784.\n\nThe Spanish Constitution of Cádiz of 1812 included a guarantee of freedom of the press. Many more political books and tracts appeared then in the preceding years. Alejandro Valdés continued publishing in this more liberal atmosphere. In 1816 he published the classic bibliography, José Mariano Beristáin y Sousa's \"Biblioteca Americana Septentrional\". This was based on Eguiara's \"Biblioteca Mexicana\", but much updated and expanded.\n\nFollowing Mexican independence in 1821, Valdés became imperial printer for the government of Agustín de Iturbide, for the printing of official documents. About this time, Valdés took Luis Abadiano as partner, an association that lasted until Valdés's death in 1831. At this date, the firm was the oldest publisher and bookseller in the country.\n\nIn 1836 Luis Abadiano published the following invitation (given in part):\n\nTranslation of the Marvelous Image of Our Lady of Guadalupe\n\nIn December 1836 will be presented with new brilliance the glory that was given to our America in 1531. At 9 in the morning of December 10, the celestial image of St. Mary of Guadalupe will be transferred from the Church of the Carmelites to the renowned Collegiate Church, so that the image will be placed in a new altar, a worthy work of the magnificent piety of the Mexicans. Perhaps there will never be seen a procession so solemn and edifying as that which is being prepared for this event, which will be proceeded and accompanied by the most affectionate and fervent orations in all of the Republic.\n\nOn the death of Luis Abadiano, the business passed to his sons Francisco and Dionisio.\n\nBetween 1825 and 1884, the Abadiano family ran both the printing and the bookselling enterprises descended from Eguiara's original shop. They published several thousand titles, of high quality, and were extremely active as booksellers. The sons were students of Mexican antiquities, and also collectors.\n\nThe highly religious and conservative Abadiano family also dealt extensively in books and pamphlets related to the Church in Mexico. During the secular reforms of 1857 through 1861, many of the books and manuscripts of the libraries of Mexico City convents were transferred to the Abadianos or purchased by them and held in trust with the intent of restoring them at a future date. The fear was that they would be appropriated or destroyed by the government.\n\nIn 1883 the book business, located at Calle de las Escalerillas (today, \"calle de Guatemala\"), was inherited by Eufemio Abadiano, son of Francisco, but Eufemio lacked the inclination or the ability to continue the family tradition. In 1885 he founded a magazine devoted to Mexican literature and history, and also began making reproductions of famous Mexican archaeological objects. However, this enterprise was unsuccessful. In 1887 he announced his intention of auctioning the library and art collection of his father and the stock on hand in the bookstore. In 1889, most of the remaining books were sold to Adolph Sutro of San Francisco.\n\nSutro (or his agents) acquired everything that remained of the firm — individual titles published from the sixteenth to the mid-19th centuries, the largest collection of 19th-century Mexican pamphlets and ephemera in the world, an extraordinary collection of imprints and manuscripts relating to the Church in Mexico, and publisher's remainders dating from as far back as the mid-18th century. Sutro also bought the Abadiano ledgers, receipt books and galley proofs dating from the late 18th century. He thus obtained an important collection of documents related to the history of printing and bookselling in Mexico.\n\nMuch of Sutro's collection (of which his Mexican purchases were only a part), was destroyed in the earthquake and fire of 1906. However the Mexican collection survived intact. It consisted of forty to fifty thousand books, pamphlets, broadsides and manuscripts. In 1913 Sutro's heirs donated his surviving library, including the Mexican collection, to the California State Library under the condition that it remain in San Francisco.\n\n\n"}

She was the daughter of Governor and U.S. Senator Clifford Hansen and the mother of current Governor Matt Mead.\n\nIn 1990, Mead was the unsuccessful GOP nominee for governor, having been defeated by the incumbent Democrat Mike Sullivan of Douglas in Converse County in southeastern Wyoming. In the general election, Sullivan prevailed with 104,638 votes (65.4 percent) to Mead's 55,471 ballots (34.6 percent). Mead polled only 4,311 more votes against Sullivan than she had received in her closed primary in August and was hence unable to procure support beyond her party base.\n\nMead was born in Jackson, Wyoming to Clifford Peter Hansen (1912–2009), a native of Lincoln County, and the former Martha Close (1914–2011), who was reared in Sheridan. Her brother, Peter Arthur Hansen (born 1936), resides in Cheyenne, Wyoming.\n\nIn 1957, she received her Bachelor of Arts degree in history from the University of Wyoming in Laramie. She married Peter Bradford Mead (born 1933), who coincidentally partly bears the same name as her father, brother, and grandfather. For more than twenty years, she and Peter managed the family cattle ranch, originally homesteaded by her grandparents, Peter Christofferson Hansen and the former Sylvia Irene Wood. The Meads reared three children. After their divorce, she ran the ranch with her parents and then with her older son, Bradford Scott Mead, and his wife, Katherine L. \"Kate\" Mead (both born 1957), a native of Vermont, who came to Wyoming on a skiing scholarship and in 2006 was the Republican nominee for the District 16 seat in the Wyoming House of Representatives. In 1995, she married Dick Steinhour. \n\nMead was a president of the Wyoming Business Alliance and a member of the University of Wyoming Alumni Board, the Wyoming Centennial Commission, and the National Public Lands Advisory Council. She was active in both the Wyoming Stock Growers Association, of which her father was the president from 1953 to 1955, and the Wyoming Tax Payers Association. In Jackson, she sat on the boards of St. John's Hospital and the Jackson State Bank.\n\nShe lived on the Mead Ranch, officially the \"Lower Bar BC\", which prior to its salefor more than $100 millionwas one of the largest pastoral private holdings in Teton County. The Hansens and Meads were particularly known for conservation and stewardship activities on their properties.\n\nBy December 2001, the Lower Bar BC had become no longer economically productive and surrendered its lease in Grand Teton Park.\n\nThough considered an expert horsewoman, Mead was killed on her 61st birthday in an accident while working cattle on leased land in Grand Teton National Park near the Mead Ranch in Spring Gulch. She was thrown by her horse, which then collapsed upon her. She was born and died on a Friday.\n\nIn addition to Governor Matt Mead, who is also a former U.S. attorney in Cheyenne, Mead's other children are Bradford Scott \"Brad\" Mead (born July 24, 1957) and Muffy Mead-Ferro, an author in Salt Lake City, Utah. Brad Mead and his wife, Katherine L. \"Kate\" Mead (also born 1957), are attorneys in Jackson. Kate Mead, a Vermont native who came to Wyoming on a skiing scholarship, was the Republican nominee in 2006 for the District 16 seat in the Wyoming House of Representatives. Both Bradford Mead and Clifford Hansen recorded interviews to be used as a part of the new Jackson Hole Historical Society Museum, to be unveiled in downtown Jackson. Mead's cremated remains lie, along with those of her parents, in a crypt in the St. John's Episcopal Church Mausoleum in Jackson.\n\nHer children established the dual Mary Mead Memorial Scholarship and Graduate Fellowship for Women in Agriculture at the University of Wyoming. These awards honor her lifetime commitment to the Wyoming livestock industry.\n\nThe Mead children also released this eulogy to their mother:One of Jackson's pre-eminent ranchers was \"a woman born to the land that she knew every inch of -- every ditch, every bog, every dry patch, every likely place to look for an errant bunch of cows during spring gathering.<br>\nShe was a diligent midwife to nearly one thousand mother cows every spring, she kept many an all-night vigil with a cow in difficulty or bottle-feeding a shivering newborn as she talked to it and rubbed it with a blanket on her kitchen floor.\n\n"}
{"id": "172777", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=172777", "title": "Perceptron", "text": "Perceptron\n\nIn machine learning, the perceptron is an algorithm for supervised learning of binary classifiers. A binary classifier is a function which can decide whether or not an input, represented by a vector of numbers, belongs to some specific class. It is a type of linear classifier, i.e. a classification algorithm that makes its predictions based on a linear predictor function combining a set of weights with the feature vector.\n\nThe perceptron algorithm was invented in 1957 at the Cornell Aeronautical Laboratory by Frank Rosenblatt, funded by the United States Office of Naval Research.\nThe perceptron was intended to be a machine, rather than a program, and while its first implementation was in software for the IBM 704, it was subsequently implemented in custom-built hardware as the \"Mark 1 perceptron\". This machine was designed for image recognition: it had an array of 400 photocells, randomly connected to the \"neurons\". Weights were encoded in potentiometers, and weight updates during learning were performed by electric motors.\n\nIn a 1958 press conference organized by the US Navy, Rosenblatt made statements about the perceptron that caused a heated controversy among the fledgling AI community; based on Rosenblatt's statements, \"The New York Times\" reported the perceptron to be \"the embryo of an electronic computer that [the Navy] expects will be able to walk, talk, see, write, reproduce itself and be conscious of its existence.\"\n\nAlthough the perceptron initially seemed promising, it was quickly proved that perceptrons could not be trained to recognise many classes of patterns. This caused the field of neural network research to stagnate for many years, before it was recognised that a feedforward neural network with two or more layers (also called a multilayer perceptron) had far greater processing power than perceptrons with one layer (also called a single layer perceptron).\nSingle layer perceptrons are only capable of learning linearly separable patterns; in 1969 a famous book entitled \"Perceptrons\" by Marvin Minsky and Seymour Papert showed that it was impossible for these classes of network to learn an XOR function. However, this doesn't hold for non-linear classification functions that can be used in a single layer perceptron. Applying such functions extend the perceptron abilities including implementation of XOR function. It is often believed (incorrectly) that they also conjectured that a similar result would hold for a multi-layer perceptron network. However, this is not true, as both Minsky and Papert already knew that multi-layer perceptrons were capable of producing an XOR function. (See the page on \"Perceptrons (book)\" for more information.) Three years later Stephen Grossberg published a series of papers introducing networks capable of modelling differential, contrast-enhancing and XOR functions. (The papers were published in 1972 and 1973, see e.g.:). Nevertheless, the often-miscited Minsky/Papert text caused a significant decline in interest and funding of neural network research. It took ten more years until neural network research experienced a resurgence in the 1980s. This text was reprinted in 1987 as \"Perceptrons - Expanded Edition\" where some errors in the original text are shown and corrected.\n\nThe kernel perceptron algorithm was already introduced in 1964 by Aizerman et al. Margin bounds guarantees were given for the Perceptron algorithm in the general non-separable case first by Freund and Schapire (1998), and more recently by Mohri and Rostamizadeh (2013) who extend previous results and give new L1 bounds.\n\nThe perceptron is a simplified model of a biological neuron. While the complexity of biological neuron models is often required to fully understand neural behavior, research suggests a perceptron-like linear model can produce some behavior seen in real neurons .\n\nIn the modern sense, the perceptron is an algorithm for learning a binary classifier: a function that maps its input formula_1 (a real-valued vector) to an output value formula_2 (a single binary value):\n\nwhere formula_4 is a vector of real-valued weights, formula_5 is the dot product formula_6, where is the number of inputs to the perceptron, and is the \"bias\". The bias shifts the decision boundary away from the origin and does not depend on any input value.\n\nThe value of formula_2 (0 or 1) is used to classify formula_1 as either a positive or a negative instance, in the case of a binary classification problem. If is negative, then the weighted combination of inputs must produce a positive value greater than formula_9 in order to push the classifier neuron over the 0 threshold. Spatially, the bias alters the position (though not the orientation) of the decision boundary. The perceptron learning algorithm does not terminate if the learning set is not linearly separable. If the vectors are not linearly separable learning will never reach a point where all vectors are classified properly. The most famous example of the perceptron's inability to solve problems with linearly nonseparable vectors is the Boolean exclusive-or problem. The solution spaces of decision boundaries for all binary functions and learning behaviors are studied in the reference.\n\nIn the context of neural networks, a perceptron is an artificial neuron using the Heaviside step function as the activation function. The perceptron algorithm is also termed the single-layer perceptron, to distinguish it from a multilayer perceptron, which is a misnomer for a more complicated neural network. As a linear classifier, the single-layer perceptron is the simplest feedforward neural network.\n\nBelow is an example of a learning algorithm for a (single-layer) perceptron. For multilayer perceptrons, where a hidden layer exists, more sophisticated algorithms such as backpropagation must be used. Alternatively, methods such as the delta rule can be used if the function is non-linear and differentiable, although the one below will work as well.\n\nWhen multiple perceptrons are combined in an artificial neural network, each output neuron operates independently of all the others; thus, learning each output can be considered in isolation.\n\nWe first define some variables:\nWe show the values of the features as follows:\nTo represent the weights: \nTo show the time-dependence of formula_4, we use:\nUnlike other linear classification algorithms such as logistic regression, there is no need for a \"learning rate\" in the perceptron algorithm. This is because multiplying the update by any constant simply rescales the weights but never changes the sign of the prediction.\n\nThe algorithm updates the weights after steps 2a and 2b. These weights are immediately applied to a pair in the training set, and subsequently updated, rather than waiting until all pairs in the training set have undergone these steps.\n\nThe perceptron is a linear classifier, therefore it will never get to the state with all the input vectors classified correctly if the training set is not linearly separable, i.e. if the positive examples cannot be separated from the negative examples by a hyperplane. In this case, no \"approximate\" solution will be gradually approached under the standard learning algorithm, but instead learning will fail completely. Hence, if linear separability of the training set is not known a priori, one of the training variants below should be used.\n\nIf the training set \"is\" linearly separable, then the perceptron is guaranteed to converge. Furthermore, there is an upper bound on the number of times the perceptron will adjust its weights during the training.\n\nSuppose that the input vectors from the two classes can be separated by a hyperplane with a margin formula_31, i.e. there exists a weight vector formula_32, and a bias term such that formula_33 for all formula_34 and formula_35 for all formula_36. Also, let denote the maximum norm of an input vector. Novikoff (1962) proved that in this case the perceptron algorithm converges after making formula_37 updates. The idea of the proof is that the weight vector is always adjusted by a bounded amount in a direction with which it has a negative dot product, and thus can be bounded above by , where is the number of changes to the weight vector. However, it can also be bounded below by because if there exists an (unknown) satisfactory weight vector, then every change makes progress in this (unknown) direction by a positive \namount that depends only on the input vector.\nWhile the perceptron algorithm is guaranteed to converge on \"some\" solution in the case of a linearly separable training set, it may still pick \"any\" solution and problems may admit many solutions of varying quality. The \"perceptron of optimal stability\", nowadays better known as the linear support vector machine, was designed to solve this problem (Krauth and Mezard, 1987).\n\nThe pocket algorithm with ratchet (Gallant, 1990) solves the stability problem of perceptron learning by keeping the best solution seen so far \"in its pocket\". The pocket algorithm then returns the solution in the pocket, rather than the last solution. It can be used also for non-separable data sets, where the aim is to find a perceptron with a small number of misclassifications. However, these solutions appear purely stochastically and hence the pocket algorithm neither approaches them gradually in the course of learning, nor are they guaranteed to show up within a given number of learning steps.\n\nThe Maxover algorithm (Wendemuth, 1995) is \"robust\" in the sense that it will converge regardless of (prior) knowledge of linear separability of the data set. In the linearly separable case, it will solve the training problem – if desired, even with optimal stability (maximum margin between the classes). For non-separable data sets, it will return a solution with a small number of misclassifications. In all cases, the algorithm gradually approaches the solution in the course of learning, without memorizing previous states and without stochastic jumps. Convergence is to global optimality for separable data sets and to local optimality for non-separable data sets.\n\nThe Voted Perceptron (Freund and Schapire, 1999), is a variant using multiples weighted perceptrons. The algorithm starts a new perceptron every time an example is wrongly classified, initializing the weights vector with the final weights of the last perceptron. Each perceptron will also be given another weight corresponding to how many examples do they correctly classify before wrongly classifying one, and at the end the output will be a weighted vote on all perceptron.\n\nIn separable problems, perceptron training can also aim at finding the largest separating margin between the classes. The so-called perceptron of optimal stability can be determined by means of iterative training and optimization schemes, such as the Min-Over algorithm (Krauth and Mezard, 1987) or the AdaTron (Anlauf and Biehl, 1989))\n. AdaTron uses the fact that the corresponding quadratic optimization problem is convex. The perceptron of optimal stability, together with the kernel trick, are the conceptual foundations of the support vector machine.\n\nThe formula_38-perceptron further used a pre-processing layer of fixed random weights, with thresholded output units. This enabled the perceptron to classify analogue patterns, by projecting them into a binary space. In fact, for a projection space of sufficiently high dimension, patterns can become linearly separable.\n\nAnother way to solve nonlinear problems without using multiple layers is to use higher order networks (sigma-pi unit). In this type of network, each element in the input vector is extended with each pairwise combination of multiplied inputs (second order). This can be extended to an \"n\"-order network.\n\nIt should be kept in mind, however, that the best classifier is not necessarily that which classifies all the training data perfectly. Indeed, if we had the prior constraint that the data come from equi-variant Gaussian distributions, the linear separation in the input space is optimal, and the nonlinear solution is overfitted.\n\nOther linear classification algorithms include Winnow, support vector machine and logistic regression.\n\nLike most other techniques for training linear classifiers, the perceptron generalizes naturally to multiclass classification. Here, the input formula_39 and the output formula_40 are drawn from arbitrary sets. A feature representation function formula_41 maps each possible input/output pair to a finite-dimensional real-valued feature vector. As before, the feature vector is multiplied by a weight vector formula_42, but now the resulting score is used to choose among many possible outputs:\n\nLearning again iterates over the examples, predicting an output for each, leaving the weights unchanged when the predicted output matches the target, and changing them when it does not. The update becomes:\n\nThis multiclass feedback formulation reduces to the original perceptron when formula_39 is a real-valued vector, formula_40 is chosen from formula_47, and formula_48.\n\nFor certain problems, input/output representations and features can be chosen so that formula_49 can be found efficiently even though formula_40 is chosen from a very large or even infinite set.\n\nIn recent years, perceptron training has become popular in the field of natural language processing for such tasks as part-of-speech tagging and syntactic parsing (Collins, 2002).\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1104639", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1104639", "title": "Plant breeders' rights", "text": "Plant breeders' rights\n\nPlant breeders' rights (PBR), also known as plant variety rights (PVR), are rights granted to the breeder of a new variety of plant that give the breeder exclusive control over the propagating material (including seed, cuttings, divisions, tissue culture) and harvested material (cut flowers, fruit, foliage) of a new variety for a number of years.\n\nWith these rights, the breeder can choose to become the exclusive marketer of the variety, or to license the variety to others. In order to qualify for these exclusive rights, a variety must be new, distinct, uniform and stable. A variety is:\n\nThe breeder must also give the variety an acceptable \"denomination\", which becomes its generic name and must be used by anyone who markets the variety.\n\nTypically, plant variety rights are granted by national offices, after examination. Seed is submitted to the plant variety office, who grow it for one or more seasons, to check that it is distinct, stable, and uniform. If these tests are passed, exclusive rights are granted for a specified period (typically 20/25 years (or 25/30 years, for trees and vines). Annual renewal fees are required to maintain the rights.\n\nBreeders can bring suit to enforce their rights and can recover damages for infringement. Plant breeders' rights contain exemptions from infringement that are not recognized under patent law. Commonly, there is an exemption for farm-saved seed. Farmers may store the production in their own bins for their own use as seed, but this does not necessarily extend to brown-bag sales of seed. Further sales for propagation purposes are not allowed without the written approval of the breeder. There is also a breeders' exemption (research exemption in the 1991 Act) that allows breeders to use protected varieties as sources of initial variation to create new varieties of plants (1978 Act), or for other experimental purposes (1991 Act). There is also a provision for compulsory licensing to assure public access to protected varieties if the national interest requires it and the breeder is unable to meet the demand.\n\nThere is tension over the relationship between patent rights and plant breeder's rights. There has been litigation in Australia, the United States, and Canada over the overlap between such rights. Each of these cases was decided on the principle that patents and plant breeders' rights were overlapping and not mutually exclusive. Thus, the exemptions from infringement of plant breeders' rights, such as the saved seed exemption, do not create corresponding exemptions from infringement of the patents covering the same plants. Likewise, acts that infringe the plant breeders' rights, such as exportation of the variety, would not necessarily infringe a patent on the variety, which only allows the patent owner to prohibit making, using or selling the patented invention.\n\nIn 1957, in France negotiations took place concerned with the protection of new varieties. This led to the creation of the Union Internationale pour la Protection des Obtentions Végétales (UPOV) and adoption of the first text of the International Convention for the Protection of New Varieties of Plants (UPOV Convention) in 1961. The purpose of the Convention was to ensure that the member states party to the Convention acknowledge the achievements of breeders of new plant varieties by making available to them an exclusive property right, on the basis of a set of uniform and clearly defined principles.\n\nThe Convention was revised in Geneva in 1972, 1978 and 1991. Both the 1978 and the 1991 Acts set out a minimum scope of protection and offer member States the possibility of taking national circumstances into account in their legislation. Under the 1978 Act, the minimum scope of the plant breeder's right requires that the holder's prior authorisation is necessary for the production for purposes of commercial marketing, the offering for sale and the marketing of propagating material of the protected variety. The 1991 Act contains more detailed provisions defining the acts concerning propagating material in relation to which the holder's authorisation is required. The breeder's authorisation is also required in relation to any of the specified acts done with harvested material of the variety, unless the breeder has had reasonable opportunity to exercise their right in relation to the propagating material, or if not doing so could constitute an \"Omega Threat\" situation. Under that provision, for example, a flower breeder who protects their variety in the Netherlands could block importation of cut flowers of that variety into the Netherlands from Egypt, which does not grant plant breeders' rights, because the breeder had no opportunity to exercise any rights in Egypt. Member countries also have the option to require the breeder's authorization with respect to the specified acts as applied to products directly obtained from the harvested material (such as flour or oil from grain, or juice from fruit), unless the breeder has had reasonable opportunity to exercise their right in relation to the harvested material.\n\nThe UPOV Convention also establishes a multilateral system of \"national treatment\", under which citizens of any member state are treated as citizens of all member states for the purpose of obtaining plant breeders rights. It also sets up a multilateral priority filing system, under which an application for protection filed in one member state establishes a filing date for applications filed in all other member states within one year of that original filing date. This allows a breeder to file in any one member country within the one-year period required to preserve the novelty of their variety, and the novelty of the variety will still be recognized when the filing is done in other member countries within one year of the original filing date. However, if the applicant does not wish to make use of priority filing, he or she has four years in which to apply in all other member states, excepting the United States, for all species except tree and vine species in which case he or she has six years to make application. More information can be obtained in Article 10 (1) (b) of Council Regulation (EC) No. 2100/94 of 27 July 2004. The trigger to start the four- or six-year period is not actually the date on which the first filing is made but the date on which the variety was first commercialised.\n\nThe UPOV Convention is not self-executing. Each member state must adopt legislation consistent with the requirements of the convention and submit that legislation to the UPOV Secretariat for review and approval by the UPOV Council, which consists of all the UPOV member states acting in committee. In compliance with these treaty obligations, the United Kingdom enacted the Plant Variety and Seeds Act 1964. Similar legislation was passed in the Netherlands, Denmark, Germany, and New Zealand. In 1970 the United States followed the lead of seventeen Western European nations and passed the Plant Variety Protection Act 1970 (US). This legislation provided protection to developers of novel, sexually reproduced plants. However, the United States originally acceded to the UPOV Convention on the basis of the Plant Patent Act and did not bring the PVP Act into compliance with UPOV requirements until 1984 when the Commissioner of Plant Variety Protection promulgated rules to do so. Since the 1980s, the US Patent Office has granted patents on plants, including plant varieties this provides a second way of protecting plant varieties in the United States. Australia passed the Plant Variety Protection Act 1987 (Cth) and the Plant Breeders Rights Act 1994 (Cth). Australian patent law also permits the patenting of plant varieties. In total, 65 countries have signed the UPOV Convention and adopted plant breeders' rights legislation consistent with the requirements of the convention.\n\nThe WTO's Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPs) requires member states to provide protection for plant varieties either by patents or by an effective \"sui generis\" (stand alone) system, or a combination of the two. Most countries meet this requirement through UPOV Convention-compliant legislation. India has adopted a plant breeders' rights law that has been rejected by the UPOV Council as not meeting the requirements of the treaty.\n\nThe most recent 1991 UPOV convention established several restrictions upon international plant breeders’ rights. While the current legislature of the convention recognizes novel varieties of plants as intellectual property, laws were formed concerning the preservation of seeds for future plantation, such that the need to buy seeds to use in subsequent planting seasons would be significantly reduced, and even potentially eliminated altogether. In addition, the 1991 convention also concerns the method of instigating plant breeding by implementing pre-existing and patented plant species as contributor of vital genetic information in the creation of what would legally be regarded as a new variety of plant.\n\nConstituent countries of the World Trade Organization are required to acknowledge the creation of new varieties of plants, and to uphold these creations within full recognition of intellectual property rights laws. A formalized legislature, exemplifying the manner in which such intellectual property rights can be conferred, is demonstrated by the 1991 UPOV convention, which declares such rights upon an individual breeder. This document further identifies a breeder as one who has found or created a plant variety, one who possesses legal authority for the contractual production of a new plant variety, or one who has inherited legal rights to this form of intellectual property as it was derived under either of the two aforementioned conditions.\n\nAs a result of debate over the protection of hybrid plants as new varieties, the legal measure of double protection, as expressed within the current iteration of the UPOV, can be taken. Double protection mediates the overlap between plant breeders’ rights and patents that exists within the purview of intellectual property rights law, by enabling the protections of both to be conferred upon a particular plant variety.\n\nThere have been contrary opinions expressed by both lawyers and scientists assessing the general necessity, if one exists, for the official protection of plants as a form of intellectual property. Currently, intellectual property rights protect ideas that can be demonstrated as being novel and undiscovered at the time of its legal claim as intellectual property. This definition of novelty, however, has been flexible throughout the history of intellectual property law, both internationally, and within the United States. Expectations of future changes to the legal protection of plant-related forms of intellectual property differ from the legal requirements for the first plant patent. Proponents of these laws recognize an overarching need for the financial support of research and development. Agricultural research and development, for example, has been specified as a particularly demanding endeavor, with respect to immediate concerns for the ability to sustainably feed an increasing global population. On the contrary, some believe that a more diverse approach than the imposition of intellectual property rights laws upon new plant varieties is required. This counter argument asserts that complex social, cultural, and economic factors affect the nature of intellectual property and its protection. A specific concern within this argument is with the means by which seeds are accessed within different local and international regions. Recognizing that this process is extremely transient in nature and can vary greatly over time, supporters of this argument purport that this diversity must be reflected within intellectual property rights laws in order for them to exist as an effective protection of plant breeders’ rights.\n\nAs a result of this conflict concerning authority over seeds, new legislation has been implemented in the United States. The Open Source Seed Initiative (OSSI) is a national attempt that has been introduced within the United States, and is the first of its kind to model its approach regarding plant breeders’ rights upon the mechanisms implemented by openly sourced software mechanisms. Subsequent discourse on this approach has arisen, as concerns with the use of open source technology within a legal framework have developed. Some perceive OSSI as having significantly limited plant breeders’ ability to access intellectual property rights for new plant varieties. This has resulted in claims that funding for research and development in this sector will also decline.\n\n\n"}

This game is set in the Fiore region.\n\n\"Pokémon Ranger\" is a role-playing game which is designed in a format radically different from that of traditional Pokémon RPGs. The player controls a Pokémon Ranger in the Fiore region and catches Pokémon, temporarily, by using a device called a \"capture styler\", which is controlled by the stylus. The storyline of the game is set out in 10 main missions with three sub-missions. The only Pokémon that travels permanently with the player is a Minun if the player chooses the male hero or Plusle if the player chooses the female hero. The player must loop the Pokémon with the \"styler\" a certain amount of times to capture them. Pokémon may attempt to flee the styler or attack it. The styler has an energy bar that is similar to an HP counter for Pokémon on the other Pokémon adventure games, when the energy bar of the styler is completely depleted, the player is transported to the last save terminal. The styler can be recharged in a Pokémon center like manner at a ranger base, save points are in the bases and scattered throughout the game. There is a quick save option to use in emergencies when a save port can't be found or is too far away. Temporarily caught Pokémon can be used in the field to accomplish tasks and solve puzzles by cutting, tackling, shooting fire, blowing water, etc. They can also be used to enhance the styler's loop line. For example, if a water Pokémon is selected to aid in capturing a new Pokémon, the styler will produce a temporary bubble that immobilizes the target, preventing it from attacking or fleeing.\n\n\"Pokémon Ranger\" is set in the Fiore region. The region's name originates from the Italian word for flower. The Go-Rock Squad is the resident crime syndicate of this region. Fiore itself does not have any native Pokémon, but has many Pokémon from other regions. It also does not have any Pokémon Trainers. All people who live with Pokémon keep them outside of Poké Balls, like pets, as Pokémon are never trained here. Fiore is located quite some distance from the other regions of the Pokémon world up to the third generation. It is a relatively small island region that is quite mountainous. There are four major settlements in Fiore, each named after the season it constantly experiences — Ringtown (spring) to the west, Fall City (fall) to the east, Wintown (winter) at foot of mountains to the north and Summerland (summer) on an island to the south. The Krokka Tunnel connects Fall City and Ringtown. From there, one can also get to the Panula Cave, which is also accessible from Summerland's harbor via water vehicle (aka the AquaMole), the coldest spot of the Fiore region, hence ice Pokémon appearing there, including the legendary Regice. It leads to Wintown, located on the foot of the Sekra Range. The Sekra Range is a mountain range that is notable for having a waterfall that can \"fill the Capture Arena 23 times in one minute\"; housing the Go-Rock Squad's base; a house high up where the residents inside will recharge the player's Styler; \"Shiftree\", a tree where five Shiftry live in and will attack the player all at the same time; and the Fiore Temple, an ancient temple mountain currently home to a lot of wild Pokémon, but with a strange door that will only open when you capture the 3 wanted Pokémon; where the game's climax takes place, located at the very summit of the Sekra Range. On the same island where Summerland is located on is a big jungle called the Olive Jungle. Numerous Bug- and Grass-type Pokémon live here, and in the center is a ruin, with the same symbols on Kyogre, called the Jungle Relic. In the past, Rangers came to the Relic to test themselves. There are four Challenges involving Dragon Pokémon, each representing one of the four classical elements: the Challenge of Destruction (Earth), the Challenge of Wind (Air), the Challenge of Fire and the Challenge of Water. These Pokémon are Flygon, Salamence, Charizard, and Kingdra respectively, as on the cover of \"Pokémon Ranger\". It is said that should all four be cleared, a catastrophe will befall Fiore. After beating the game, the player may roam around free to do almost anything. There is also the Ranger Net for special missions after the main missions. In these missions, the main character is required to capture 3 legendary Pokémon not seen anywhere else in the game; Deoxys, Celebi, and Mew. If the code for the special Manaphy mission is unlocked, it can be used to get the Manaphy Egg, which can later be transferred to \"Pokémon Diamond\", \"Pearl\", and \"Platinum\".\n\nThe storyline revolves around a single Pokémon Ranger — Lunick or Solana, depending on the player's choice. In addition to the protagonist characters in the game, several other Pokémon Rangers are part of the Ranger Union. Each ranger leader holds domain over that town's rangers. These rangers are named Cameron, Elita, Joel, and Spenser. A professor named Professor Hastings also plays a significant role in the game, as the Chief of Technology for the Ranger Union. The new villainous group, the Go-Rock Squad, has four sub-leaders called the Go-Rock Quads, the leader's three sons and daughter. The Quads have a motto they repeat every time they are encountered. Their original plot is to use the Super Styler, a more powerful version of the original Styler that resembles an organ, to take control of Entei, Suicune, and Raikou to attack citizens of Fiore. They would then command them to stop, leading people to believe the Go-Rock Squad were heroes. They would afterwards command Pokémon to start other problems and charge money to solve the problem. The player is then required to prove their worth in three extra post ending missions and capture the enraged legendaries; Kyogre, Groudon, and Rayquaza.\n\nInformation regarding \"Pokémon Ranger\" was published in the July 2005 issue of \"CoroCoro Comic\" magazine. Little details were shared, which mostly hinted that it was a game and a movie. An announcement on \"Pokémon Ranger\" came as a short teaser at the end of the 8th Pokémon film, \"\". This game's development was confused for being the same game as \"Pokémon Mystery Dungeon\".\n\nA few episodes of the \"Pokémon\" animated series have included Pokémon Rangers. They go on special missions to help preserve Pokémon and human relations, and they are closely related to Pokémon breeders. They also have a device that allows them to temporarily control wild Pokémon; this device also allows them to scan Pokémon, check how healthy they are, and make sure that they are not being interfered with by outside forces. Solana herself has appeared in three episodes of the \"Pokémon\" anime. One of which Solona must stop a disturbed Deoxys.\n\nSeveral Pokémon Rangers can also be battled in \"Pokémon Ruby\" and \"Sapphire\", \"FireRed\" and \"LeafGreen\", \"Emerald\", \"Diamond\" and \"Pearl\", \"Platinum\", \"Black\" and \"White\" and are depicted as protecting the environment and wild Pokémon. These Rangers own Pokémon which they keep in Poké Balls, and are not true rangers but still have similar intentions to true Pokémon Rangers.\n\nA direct-to-DVD animated film adaptation \"Pokémon Ranger and the Temple of the Sea\" premièred on Cartoon Network on March 23, 2007 and released on DVD the succeeding month. The movie starred a new Ranger named Jack Walker, or Jackie, whose job is to protect a Legendary Manaphy Egg which Ash and company also help in protecting.\n\nA game watch has been manufactured in the theme of \"Pokémon Ranger\". The watch is designed to look like the Pokémon Rangers' Capture Styler used for capturing Pokémon. The Pokémon can be used to help the styler by making bubbles or having leaf blades shoot out or having it on fire.\n\n\"Pokémon Ranger\" sold 193,337 copies in Japan on its release week. In terms of games reviews, \"Pokémon Ranger\" received fairly positive reaction, with a 70% ratio from GameRankings. IGN gave the game an overall score of 7.1 out of 10, citing the presentation, gameplay and graphics as the game's strong points but also citing the game's use of sound as a major drawback, with issues such as the game's use of the 8-bit sounds from the original Game Boy games as Pokémon cries. A lack of a multi-player mode was also a negative point in IGN's review.\n\nGameSpot gave a similar review to IGN, giving the game a 7.5 out of 10 overall. GameSpot commented that the game's \"unique capturing system\", \"good-sized quest\" and \"attractive 2D graphics and animation\" were the games good points while also commenting that issues such as possible scratching of the touch screen during capture and \"basic exploration sequences\" were the games notable bad points. While discussing the mixed quality of \"Pokémon\" spin-offs, Retronauts podcaster Jeremy Parish cited \"Pokémon Ranger\" as an example, with Parish later referring to it as “crappy”. He cites the dialogue and story, commenting that while \"Pokémon\" was a kiddy game, the writing in \"Ranger\" is worse than in the main games. Fellow Retronauts contributor Justin Haywald criticized HAL Laboratory, which he says is normally a good developer, for making \"Ranger\".\n\nAs of March 31, 2008, \"Pokémon Ranger\" has sold 2.70 million copies worldwide.\n\n\"\" is the sequel to \"Pokémon Ranger\", and is developed by Creatures Inc. for the Nintendo DS video game console. It was announced in the January 2008 issue of \"CoroCoro\" and was released in Japan on March 20, 2008. It was announced at E3 2008 that the game would be released in the United States under the title \"Shadows of Almia\" on November 10, 2008. It was announced on September 25 that the game would be released in Europe under the title \"Shadows of Almia\" on November 21, 2008. The game features 270 Pokémon, including new Pokémon which were not featured in the original \"Pokémon Ranger\", from \"Pokémon Diamond\" and \"Pearl\".

{"id": "12115455", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12115455", "title": "Quality (business)", "text": "Quality (business)\n\nIn business, engineering, and manufacturing, quality has a pragmatic interpretation as the non-inferiority or superiority of something; it's also defined as being suitable for its intended purpose (fitness for purpose) while satisfying customer expectations. Quality is a perceptual, conditional, and somewhat subjective attribute and may be understood differently by different people. Consumers may focus on the specification quality of a product/service, or how it compares to competitors in the marketplace. Producers might measure the conformance quality, or degree to which the product/service was produced correctly. Support personnel may measure quality in the degree that a product is reliable, maintainable, or sustainable.\n\nThere are many aspects of quality in a business context, though primary is the idea the business produces something, whether it be a physical good or a particular service. These goods and/or services and how they are produced involve many types of processes, procedures, equipment, personnel, and investments, which all fall under the quality umbrella. Key aspects of quality and how it's diffused throughout the business are rooted in the concept of quality management:\n\n\nWhile quality management and its tenets are relatively recent phenomena, the idea of quality in business is not new. In the early 1900s, pioneers such as Frederick Winslow Taylor and Henry Ford recognized the limitations of the methods being used in mass production at the time and the subsequent varying quality of output, implementing quality control, inspection, and standardization procedures in their work. Later in the twentieth century, the likes of William Edwards Deming and Joseph M. Juran helped take quality to new heights, initially in Japan and later (in the late '70s and early '80s) globally.\n\nCustomers recognize that quality is an important attribute in products and services, and suppliers recognize that quality can be an important differentiator between their own offerings and those of competitors (the quality gap). In the past two decades this quality gap has been gradually decreasing between competitive products and services. This is partly due to the contracting (also called outsourcing) of manufacturing to countries like China and India, as well internationalization of trade and competition. These countries, among many others, have raised their own standards of quality in order to meet international standards and customer demands. The ISO 9000 series of standards are probably the best known international standards for quality management, though specialized standards such as ISO 15189 (for medical laboratories) and ISO 14001 (for environmental management) also exist.\n\nThe definition of \"quality\" has changed over time, and even today some variance is found in how it is described. However, some commonality can still be found. The common element of the business definitions is that the quality of a product or service refers to the perception of the degree to which the product or service meets the customer's expectations. Quality has no specific meaning unless related to a specific function and/or object.\n\nThe business meanings of \"quality\" have developed over time. Various interpretations are given below:\n\nTraditionally, quality acts as one of five operations/project performance objectives dictated by operations management policy. Operations management, by definition, focuses on the most effective and efficient ways for creating and delivering a good or service that satisfies customer needs and expectations. As such, its ties to quality are apparent. The five performance objectives which give business a way to measure their operational performance are:\n\n\nBased on an earlier model called the sand cone model, these objectives support each other, with quality at the base. By extension, quality increases dependability, reduces cost, and increases customer satisfaction.\n\nThe early 1920s saw a slow but gradual movement among manufacturers away from a \"maximum production\" philosophy to one aligned more closely with \"positive and continuous control of quality to definite standards in the factory.\" That standardization, further pioneered by Deming and Juran later in the twentieth century, has become deeply integrated into how manufacturing businesses operate today. The introduction of the ISO 9001, 9002, and 9003 standards in 1987 — based off work from previous British and U.S. military standards — sought to \"provide organizations with the requirements to create a quality management system (QMS) for a range of different business activities.\" Additionally, good manufacturing practice (GMP) standards became more common place in countries around the world, laying out the minimum requirements manufacturers in industries including food and beverages, cosmetics, pharmaceutical products, dietary supplements, and medical devices must meet to assure their products are consistently high in quality. Process improvement philosophies such as Six Sigma and Lean Six Sigma have further pushed quality to the forefront of business management and operations. At the heart of these and other efforts is often the QMS, a documented collection of processes, management models, business strategies, human capital, and information technology used to plan, develop, deploy, evaluate, and improve a set of models, methods, and tools across an organization for the purpose of improving quality that aligns with the organization's strategic goals.\n\nThe push to integrate the concept of quality into the functions of the service industry takes a slightly different path from manufacturing. Where manufacturers focus on \"tangible, visible, persistent issues,\" many — but not all — quality aspects of the service provider's output are intangible and fleeting. Other obstacles include management's perceptions not aligning with customer expectations due to lack of communication and market research and the improper or lack of delivery of skill-based knowledge to personnel. Like manufacturing, customer expectations are key in the service industry, though the degree with which the service interacts with the customer definitely shapes perceived service quality. Perceptions such as being dependable, responsive, understanding, competent, and clean (which are difficult to describe tangibly) may drive service quality, somewhat in contrast to factors that drive measurement of manufacturing quality.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

He is one of the first photographers to use and write about the collodion process, which he claimed to have invented.\n\nBingham was born in Billesdon, Leicestershire, England, where he was baptised in March 1824. His parents were John Cowener Bingham and his wife, Martha. \n\nIn 1853, at the British Embassy in Paris, he married Emma Reeve, daughter of surgeon John Reed of Kinver, Staffordshire. She died 15 years later at their home on rue de La Rochefoucauld in Paris.\n\nBingham first started working as a chemist at the London Institution. In 1847, he published a new edition of \"Photogenic manipulation\", containing the theory and plain instructions in the art of photography\", a work that would be expanded and reprinted at least four times over the next few years.\n\nHe showed 19 photographs at The Great Exhibition of 1851, and was commissioned, as a result of the influence of Henry Cole,a member of the Executive Committee, to print the glass plate negatives by Claude-Marie Ferrier of prize winning exhibits as illustrations for the photographically-illustrated presentation copies of the Report by the Juries. Bingham set up a photographic printing establishment in Versailles in order to undertake this contract. Some of the photographs and others by Bingham were shown in 1852 at the exhibition Recent Specimens of Photography held at the Society of Arts, London, the first exhibition to focus solely on photography.\n\nBingham also made photographs of the Exposition Universelle of 1855 in Paris. His ability to take some 2500 photographs at relatively high speeds on this occasion encouraged other photographers to use the collodion process for their work as well, helping it become the most popular method from 1855 until about 1880. Henry Cole sent him at the same time to the Louvre to photograph the masterpieces of the museum collection. At some point in 1851 1855, or 1859, Bingham moved to Paris to work there as a photographer, at first together with the American Warren T. Thompson until Thompson returned to England in 1856. Bingham not only worked at the 1855 Exposition, but also displayed his own life-size portraits, for which he won a Medal First Class. Due to a lack of commercial success, however, he soon stopped producing these huge photographs and stuck to more standard formats.\n\nHis work at the Louvre inspired him to make photographic portraiture a commercial enterprise, and in 1857 he opened his new atelier in the Nouvelle Athènes quarter of Paris, one of the hotspots of artistic activity at the time. He became friends with many artists, photographing them and their works, and started on a new project, a photographic collection of the works of the recently deceased painter Paul Delaroche. Published in 1858, it was the first photographic catalogue raisonné. It was followed over the next few years by similar works about other artists, including one in 1860 on Ary Scheffer and another one with photographs of the major works of the 1860 Salon. Smaller works with only a handful of photographs were produced for particular collections and for the Napoleon Museum in Amiens.\n\nHis reproductions of paintings were famed for their suggestion of the original colours in the black-and-white photographs, and were lauded as being far superior to all other similar efforts until then. Gustave Moreau used to send photographs of his paintings, made by Bingham, to people to inform them of his latest creations, without the need to wait for a Salon or other exhibition. Similarly, Gustave Courbet showed his paintings, which were rejected for the Salon, through photographs made by Bingham. His 1863 work \"Retour de conférence\", which was even rejected at the Salon des Refusés, was destroyed by a fundamentalist Christian, making the photographs by Bingham the only remaining trace of it. But the public outrage about the painting was so great that the government had the negatives destroyed in 1867 as well. Courbet's 1864 \"Vénus et Psyché\" has disappeared as well and is also only known through Bingham's photographs.\n\nBingham continued to exhibit in Great Britain and France, winning another medal at the 1862 International Exhibition in London. He was one of the leading members of the Société française de photographie, contributing a lot of works to their exhibitions. Early in 1870, he suddenly left Paris for Brussels, where he died in February of that year. His atelier remained open until 1875, publishing more reproductions of his negatives.\n\n\nThe invention of the collodion process, the most common process for photography between 1855 and 1881, is usually given to Frederick Scott Archer, who published the method to achieve this in 1851, and said to have invented it as early as 1848. Another candidate was Gustave Le Gray, who published another, less practical collodion process in 1850. But until the end of his life, Bingham proudly proclaimed that he was the first to have written about the collodion process, either in his 1848 book or in the January 1850 edition, making him the inventor of the process. While he is generally acknowledged as one of the very first inventors to independently suggest collodion as an alternative for paper, the invention is usually still given to Archer because he published the first practically usable description of the process.\n"}

However, in \"Godzilla vs Mechagodzilla II\", the English version of the film used the original name \"Radon\".\n\nAs with Godzilla, writer Ken Kuronuma turned to prehistoric animals for inspiration in developing the character, though unlike the former, whose species is largely left ambiguous, Rodan is explicitly stated to be a kind of \"Pteranodon\". Just as Godzilla was conceived as a symbol of an American nuclear threat, Rodan was seen as an embodiment of the same danger originating from the Soviet Union.\n\nRodan's debut appearance was the first and only time the character was given a chestnut color. It originally had a menacing face with a jagged fanged beak, which would disappear in later incarnations as the character became more heroic. Rodan was portrayed via a combination of suitmation and wire-operated puppets for flight sequences. During suitmation sequences, Rodan was portrayed by Haruo Nakajima, who almost drowned when the wires holding the 150 lb suit above a water tank snapped. In \"Ghidorah, the Three-Headed Monster\", the Rodan suit was of visibly lesser quality than the previous one, having a more comical face, a thick neck which barely concealed the shape of the performer's head within, and triangular wings. The modification of the character's face was deliberate, as Rodan was meant to be a slapstick character rather than the tragic villain seen in its film debut. A new suit was constructed for \"Invasion of Astro-Monster\" which more closely resembled the first, having more rounded wings and a sleeker face. The sleek face was retained in \"Destroy All Monsters\", though the wings and chest area were crudely designed.\n\nRodan was revived in 1993's \"Godzilla vs. Mechagodzilla II\", this time portrayed entirely via a wire-manipulated marionette and hand puppets. Having received criticism for his emphasis on battle sequences relying heavily on beam weapons, special effects artist Koichi Kawakita sought to make the confrontation between Godzilla and Rodan as physical as possible.\n\nIn 2014, Legendary Pictures announced that they have acquired the rights to King Ghidorah, Mothra, and Rodan from Toho to use in their MonsterVerse.\n\nRodan appears in a Post-credits scene of \"\". It is in the depicting cave paintings showing him, Mothra, King Ghidorah, and Godzilla in the footage that is shown to James Conrad and Mason Weaver.\n\nA casting call confirmed that Rodan, Mothra, and King Ghidorah will be featured in \"\". Viral marketing describes him as a titanic bird with the skeletal structure of a \"Pteranodon\", with magma-like qualities serving as plate armor. The film's promotional website, Monarch Sciences, identifies the fictional island of Isla De Mona (not related to the real life Isla de Mona as the island is shown to be near Mexico) as Rodan's location and describes him as being tall with a wingspan of . It is also stated to be powerful enough to level cities with thunderclaps generated by its wings.\n\nThe character's shriek was created by sound technician Ichiro Minawa, who sought to replicate the \"contrabass technique\" composer Akira Ifukube used for Godzilla, though layering it with a sped up human voice. The sound would be remixed and reused for several other Toho monsters, including the second incarnation of King Ghidorah and Battra.\n\nA post-credit scene in \"\" depicting cave painting of Godzilla, Rodan, Mothra, and King Ghidorah introduces the characters (except for Godzilla) into the MonsterVerse.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

A mass in honor of Neto was held at the Santuário de São Judas Tadeu.\n\nAt the time of his death, Neto was working as a host of a local radio show \"Plant de Polícia\" (Translated: Police Shift) on the station Radio Vanguardia in Ipatinga. The week before his death he had begun working as a reporter for the daily \"Vale do Aço\". Neto also worked as a press aid for the mayor. A friend of Neto's, Fernando Benedito, says that Neto covered stories of police corruption throughout his career.\n\nNeto had recently covered stories that caused him to receive threats. It was mainly when he was covering a case where a police officer was a suspect of being involved in a murder, when he would receive these threats. According to Durval Angelo, a congressman and president of the state assembly's Human rights commission, told media sources that Neto was working on a book about the cases he had covered throughout his career at the time of his death and that the planned title was \"The Perfect Crime\".\n\nNeto was murdered while leaving a community barbecue in Ipatinga, Minas Gerais, Brazil. Two unidentified men on motorcycles shot Neto as he was getting into his car in front of the Churrasquinho do Baiano, a local food stand. Three shots were fired at Neto and he took one to the head and the others to his torso. He was rushed to the hospital where he later died.\n\nInvestigators arrested five suspects, who were police officers. These officers were suspected militia group members, who were operating in that area at the time of Neto's death. One of the arrested, was an investigator. Lúcio Lírio Leal, an investigator of the Civil Police, was sentenced to 12 years in prison for qualified homicide.\n\nLucia Lírio Leal, a former police officer, was sentenced to 12 years in prison for helping plan Neto's murder, in August 2014. Alessandra Neves Augusto, Pitote, was sentenced to 16 years in prison for carrying out the actions that killed Neto. Augusto decided the charges and says that he was framed by the local police. He was also charged with the murder of Carvalho.\n\nAt the same time of Neto's death a photojournalist was killed also. Walgney Carvalho was killed on April 14. Walgney Assis Carvalho was killed by Alessandro Neves Augusto because Caravlho had told several people he knew who was responsible for Neto's death. Augusto was falsely passing for a police officer at the time. There is no mention of what the verdict was for the other men arreseted.\n\nNeto's colleagues came together to raise awareness of the crime committed onto Neto. They wore black bands on their wrists put on shirts with his name on them, and protested in demand of justice for Neto. A week after the protest, a photojournalist, who may have had knowledge of the crime, was murdered.\n\nThe Committee to Protect Journalists wants the murder of a journalist to be classified as a federal crime, that way cases will be investigated by federal offices, which are better equipped and prepared.\n\nWhen there was no progress in his case for a month, around 1000 demonstrators rallied at the scene of his murder.\n\nIrina Bokova, director-general of UNESCO, said, \"I call on the authorities to investigate this crime and bring those responsible to justice. This is an essential step to reinforce public confidence that attacks on journalists will not be tolerated.\"\n\nThe Office of the Special Rapporteur requested that authorities conduct a prompt and diligent investigation to establish the motive of the crime, identify and appropriately punish the perpetrators.\n\nLúcio Lírio Leal said, \"I said that even if I was imprisoned for 200 years, I could say the name of who killed Rodrigo Neto, because I did not know who that person was.\" \n\nMaria José Braga said, \"Impunity is a problem, and even though some have never been resolved, we are seeing advances,I think pressure from other journalists and journalism associations is also important and has made authorities more aware.\"\n\nCJP spokes person said, \"as with the majority of cases ... accountability has extended as far as the gunmen but not the mastermind.\"\n\nThe Committee to Protect Journalists issued a statement: \"The murder of Rodrigo Neto has exemplified Brazil's entrenched impunity, and CPJ welcomes every step toward justice in his case.\"\n\n"}

Many activities in software engineering can be stated as optimization problems. Optimization techniques of operations research such as linear programming or dynamic programming are often impractical for large scale software engineering problems because of their computational complexity. Researchers and practitioners use metaheuristic search techniques to find near-optimal or \"good-enough\" solutions.\n\nSBSE problems can be divided into two types:\n\n\nSBSE converts a software engineering problem into a computational search problem that can be tackled with a metaheuristic. This involves defining a search space, or the set of possible solutions. This space is typically too large to be explored exhaustively, suggesting a metaheuristic approach. A metric (also called a fitness function, cost function, objective function or quality measure) is then used to measure the quality of potential solutions. Many software engineering problems can be reformulated as a computational search problem.\n\nThe term \"search-based application\", in contrast, refers to using search engine technology, rather than search techniques, in another industrial application.\n\nOne of the earliest attempts to apply optimization to a software engineering problem was reported by Webb Miller and David Spooner in 1976 in the area of software testing. In 1992, S. Xanthakis and his colleagues applied a search technique to a software engineering problem for the first time. The term SBSE was first used in 2001 by Harman and Jones. The research community grew to include more than 800 authors by 2013, spanning approximately 270 institutions in 40 countries.\n\nSearch-based software engineering is applicable to almost all phases of the software development process. Software testing has been one of the major applications. Search techniques have been applied to other software engineering activities, for instance, requirements analysis, design, development, and maintenance.\n\nRequirements engineering is the process by which the needs of a software's users and environment are determined and managed. Search-based methods have been used for requirements selection and optimisation with the goal of finding the best possible subset of requirements that matches user requests amid constraints such as limited resources and interdependencies between requirements. This problem is often tackled as a multiple-criteria decision-making problem and, generally involves presenting the decision maker with a set of good compromises between cost and user satisfaction as well as the requirements risk.\nIdentifying a software bug (or a code smell) and then debugging (or refactoring) the software is largely a manual and labor-intensive endeavor, though the process is tool-supported. One objective of SBSE is to automatically identify and fix bugs (for example via mutation testing).\n\nGenetic programming, a biologically-inspired technique that involves evolving programs through the use of crossover and mutation, has been used to search for repairs to programs by altering a few lines of source code. The GenProg Evolutionary Program Repair software repaired 55 out of 105 bugs for approximately $8 each in one test.\n\nCoevolution adopts a \"predator and prey\" metaphor in which a suite of programs and a suite of unit tests evolve together and influence each other.\n\nSearch-based software engineering has been applied to software testing, including automatic generation of test cases (test data), test case minimization and test case prioritization. Regression testing has also received some attention.\n\nThe use of SBSE in program optimization, or modifying a piece of software to make it more efficient in terms of speed and resource use, has been the object of successful research. In one instance, a 50,000 line program was genetically improved, resulting in a program 70 times faster on average.\nA recent work by Basios et al. shows that by optimising the data structure, Google Guava found 9% improvement on execution time, 13% improvement on memory consumption and 4% improvement on CPU usage separately.\n\nA number of decisions that are normally made by a project manager can be done automatically, for example, project scheduling.\n\nTools available for SBSE include OpenPAT. and EvoSuite and Coverage, a code coverage measurement tool for Python\n\nA number of methods and techniques are available, including:\n\nAs a relatively new area of research, SBSE does not yet experience broad industry acceptance. Software engineers are reluctant to adopt tools over which they have little control or that generate solutions that are unlike those that humans produce. In the context of SBSE use in fixing or improving programs, developers need to be confident that any automatically produced modification does not generate unexpected behavior outside the scope of a system's requirements and testing environment. Considering that fully automated programming has yet to be achieved, a desirable property of such modifications would be that they need to be easily understood by humans to support maintenance activities.\n\nAnother concern is that SBSE might make the software engineer redundant. Supporters claim that the motivation for SBSE is to enhance the relationship between the engineer and the program.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "378661", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=378661", "title": "Thermoregulation", "text": "Thermoregulation\n\nThermoregulation is the ability of an organism to keep its body temperature within certain boundaries, even when the surrounding temperature is very different. A thermoconforming organism, by contrast, simply adopts the surrounding temperature as its own body temperature, thus avoiding the need for internal thermoregulation. The internal thermoregulation process is one aspect of homeostasis: a state of dynamic stability in an organism's internal conditions, maintained far from thermal equilibrium with its environment (the study of such processes in zoology has been called physiological ecology). If the body is unable to maintain a normal temperature and it increases significantly above normal, a condition known as hyperthermia occurs. For humans, this occurs when the body is exposed to constant temperatures of approximately , and with prolonged exposure (longer than a few hours) at this temperature and up to around death is almost inevitable. Humans may also experience lethal hyperthermia when the wet bulb temperature is sustained above for six hours. The opposite condition, when body temperature decreases below normal levels, is known as hypothermia. It results when the homeostatic control mechanisms of heat within the body malfunction, causing the body to lose heat faster than producing it. Normal body temperature is around , and hypothermia sets in when the core body temperature gets lower than . Usually caused by prolonged exposure to cold temperatures, hypothermia is usually treated by methods that attempt to raise the body temperature back to a normal range.\n\nIt was not until the introduction of thermometers that any exact data on the temperature of animals could be obtained. It was then found that local differences were present, since heat production and heat loss vary considerably in different parts of the body, although the circulation of the blood tends to bring about a mean temperature of the internal parts. Hence it is important to identify the parts of the body that most closely reflect the temperature of the internal organs. Also, for such results to be comparable, the measurements must be conducted under comparable conditions. The rectum has traditionally been considered to reflect most accurately the temperature of internal parts, or in some cases of sex or species, the vagina, uterus or bladder.\n\nOccasionally the temperature of the urine as it leaves the urethra may be of use in measuring body temperature. More often the temperature is taken in the mouth, axilla, ear or groin.\n\nSome animals undergo one of various forms of dormancy where the thermoregulation process temporarily allows the body temperature to drop, thereby conserving energy. Examples include hibernating bears and torpor in bats.\n\nThermoregulation in organisms runs along a spectrum from endothermy to ectothermy. Endotherms create most of their heat via metabolic processes, and are colloquially referred to as warm-blooded. When the surrounding temperatures are cold, endotherms increase metabolic heat production to keep their body temperature constant, thus making the internal body temperature of an endotherm more or less independent of the temperature of the environment. One metabolic activity, in terms of generating heat, that endotherms are able to do is that they possess a larger number of mitochondria per cell than ectotherms, enabling them to generate more heat by increasing the rate at which they metabolize fats and sugars. Ectotherms use external sources of temperature to regulate their body temperatures. They are colloquially referred to as cold-blooded despite the fact that body temperatures often stay within the same temperature ranges as warm-blooded animals. Ectotherms are the opposite of endotherms when it comes to regulating internal temperatures. In ectotherms, the internal physiological sources of heat are of negligible importance; the biggest factor that enables them to maintain adequate body temperatures is due to environmental influences. Living in areas that maintain a constant temperature throughout the year, like the tropics or the ocean, have enabled ectotherms to develop a wide range of behavioral mechanisms that enable them to respond to external temperatures, such as sun-bathing to increase body temperature, or seeking the cover of shade to lower body temperature.\n\n\n\n\nTo cope with low temperatures, some fish have developed the ability to remain functional even when the water temperature is below freezing; some use natural antifreeze or antifreeze proteins to resist ice crystal formation in their tissues. Amphibians and reptiles cope with heat loss by evaporative cooling and behavioral adaptations. An example of behavioral adaptation is that of a lizard lying in the sun on a hot rock in order to heat through conduction.\n\nAn endotherm is an animal that regulates its own body temperature, typically by keeping it at a constant level. To regulate body temperature, an organism may need to prevent heat gains in arid environments. Evaporation of water, either across respiratory surfaces or across the skin in those animals possessing sweat glands, helps in cooling body temperature to within the organism's tolerance range. Animals with a body covered by fur have limited ability to sweat, relying heavily on panting to increase evaporation of water across the moist surfaces of the lungs and the tongue and mouth. Mammals like cats, dogs and pigs, rely on panting or other means for thermal regulation and have sweat glands only in foot pads and snout. The sweat produced on pads of paws and on palms and soles mostly serves to increase friction and enhance grip. Birds also counteract overheating by gular fluttering, or rapid vibrations of the gular (throat) skin. Down feathers trap warm air acting as excellent insulators just as hair in mammals acts as a good insulator. Mammalian skin is much thicker than that of birds and often has a continuous layer of insulating fat beneath the dermis. In marine mammals, such as whales, or animals that live in very cold regions, such as the polar bears, this is called blubber. Dense coats found in desert endotherms also aid in preventing heat gain such as in the case of the camels.\n\nA cold weather strategy is to temporarily decrease metabolic rate, decreasing the temperature difference between the animal and the air and thereby minimizing heat loss. Furthermore, having a lower metabolic rate is less energetically expensive. Many animals survive cold frosty nights through torpor, a short-term temporary drop in body temperature. Organisms when presented with the problem of regulating body temperature have not only behavioural, physiological, and structural adaptations but also a feedback system to trigger these adaptations to regulate temperature accordingly. The main features of this system are \"stimulus, receptor, modulator, effector\" and then the feedback of the newly adjusted temperature to the \"stimulus.\" This cyclical process aids in homeostasis.\n\nHomeothermy and poikilothermy refer to how stable an organism's deep-body temperature is. Most endothermic organisms are homeothermic, like mammals. However, animals with facultative endothermy are often poikilothermic, meaning their temperature can vary considerably. Most fish are ectotherms, as most of their heat comes from the surrounding water. However, almost all fish are poikilothermic.\n\nBy numerous observations upon humans and other animals, John Hunter showed that the essential difference between the so-called warm-blooded and cold-blooded animals lies in observed constancy of the temperature of the former, and the observed variability of the temperature of the latter. Almost all birds and mammals have a high temperature almost constant and independent of that of the surrounding air (homeothermy). Almost all other animals display a variation of body temperature, dependent on their surroundings (poikilothermy).\n\nThermoregulation in both ectotherms and endotherms is controlled mainly by the preoptic area of the anterior hypothalamus. Such homeostatic control is separate from the sensation of temperature.\n\nIn cold environments, birds and mammals employ the following adaptations and strategies to minimize heat loss:\nIn warm environments, birds and mammals employ the following adaptations and strategies to maximize heat loss:\n\nAs in other mammals, thermoregulation is an important aspect of human homeostasis. Most body heat is generated in the deep organs, especially the liver, brain, and heart, and in contraction of skeletal muscles. Humans have been able to adapt to a great diversity of climates, including hot humid and hot arid. High temperatures pose serious stresses for the human body, placing it in great danger of injury or even death. For example, one of the most common reactions to hot temperatures is heat exhaustion, which is an illness that could happen if one is exposed to high temperatures, resulting in some symptoms such as dizziness, fainting, or a rapid heartbeat. For humans, adaptation to varying climatic conditions includes both physiological mechanisms resulting from evolution and behavioural mechanisms resulting from conscious cultural adaptations. The physiological control of the body’s core temperature takes place primarily through the hypothalamus, which assumes the role as the body’s “thermostat.” This organ possesses control mechanisms as well as key temperature sensors, which are connected to nerve cells called thermoreceptors. Thermoreceptors come in two subcategories; ones that respond to cold temperatures and ones that respond to warm temperatures. Scattered throughout the body in both peripheral and central nervous systems, these nerve cells are sensitive to changes in temperature and are able to provide useful information to the hypothalamus through the process of negative feedback, thus maintaining a constant core temperature.\n\nThere are three avenues of heat loss: convection, conduction, and radiation. If skin temperature is greater than that of the surroundings, the body can lose heat by radiation and conduction. But, if the temperature of the surroundings is greater than that of the skin, the body actually \"gains\" heat by radiation and conduction. In such conditions, the only means by which the body can rid itself of heat is by evaporation. So, when the surrounding temperature is higher than the skin temperature, anything that prevents adequate evaporation will cause the internal body temperature to rise. During intense physical activity (e.g. sports), evaporation becomes the main avenue of heat loss. Humidity affects thermoregulation by limiting sweat evaporation and thus heat loss.\nThermogenesis occurs in the flowers of many plants in the Araceae family as well as in cycad cones. In addition, the sacred lotus (\"Nelumbo nucifera\") is able to thermoregulate itself, remaining on average 20 °C (36 °F) above air temperature while flowering. Heat is produced by breaking down the starch that was stored in their roots, which requires the consumption of oxygen at a rate approaching that of a flying hummingbird.\n\nOne possible explanation for plant thermoregulation is to provide protection against cold temperature. For example, the skunk cabbage is not frost-resistant, yet it begins to grow and flower when there is still snow on the ground. Another theory is that thermogenicity helps attract pollinators, which is borne out by observations that heat production is accompanied by the arrival of beetles or flies.\n\nAnimals other than humans regulate and maintain their body temperature with physiological adjustments and behavior. Desert lizards are ectotherms and so unable to metabolically control their temperature but can do this by altering their location. They may do this, in the morning only by raising their head from its burrow and then exposing their entire body. By basking in the sun, the lizard absorbs solar heat. It may also absorb heat by conduction from heated rocks that have stored radiant solar energy. To lower their temperature, lizards exhibit varied behaviors. Sand seas, or ergs, produce up to , and the sand lizard will hold its feet up in the air to cool down, seek cooler objects with which to contact, find shade or return to their burrow. They also go to their burrows to avoid cooling when the sun goes down or the temperature falls. Aquatic animals can also regulate their temperature behaviorally by changing their position in the thermal gradient.\nAnimals also engage in kleptothermy in which they share or even steal each other's body warmth. In endotherms such as bats and birds (such as the mousebird and emperor penguin) it allows the sharing of body heat (particularly amongst juveniles). This allows the individuals to increase their thermal inertia (as with gigantothermy) and so reduce heat loss. Some ectotherms share burrows of ectotherms. Other animals exploit termite mounds.\n\nSome animals living in cold environments maintain their body temperature by preventing heat loss. Their fur grows more densely to increase the amount of insulation. Some animals are regionally heterothermic and are able to allow their less insulated extremities to cool to temperatures much lower than their core temperature—nearly to . This minimizes heat loss through less insulated body parts, like the legs, feet (or hooves), and nose.\nTo cope with limited food resources and low temperatures, some mammals hibernate during cold periods. To remain in \"stasis\" for long periods, these animals build up brown fat reserves and slow all body functions. True hibernators (e.g., groundhogs) keep their body temperatures low throughout hibernation whereas the core temperature of false hibernators (e.g., bears) varies; occasionally the animal may emerge from its den for brief periods. Some bats are true hibernators and rely upon a rapid, non-shivering thermogenesis of their brown fat deposit to bring them out of hibernation.\n\nEstivation is similar to hibernation, however, it usually occurs in hot periods to allow animals to avoid high temperatures and desiccation. Both terrestrial and aquatic invertebrate and vertebrates enter into estivation. Examples include lady beetles (\"Coccinellidae\"), North American desert tortoises, crocodiles, salamanders, cane toads, and the water-holding frog.\n\nDaily torpor occurs in small endotherms like bats and hummingbirds, which temporarily reduces their high metabolic rates to conserve energy.\n\nPreviously, average oral temperature for healthy adults had been considered , while normal ranges are to . In Poland and Russia, the temperature had been measured axillary. 36.6 °C was considered \"ideal\" temperature in these countries, while normal ranges are 36 °C to 36.9 °C.\n\nRecent studies suggest that the average temperature for healthy adults is (same result in three different studies). Variations (one standard deviation) from three other studies are:\n\nMeasured temperature varies according to thermometer placement, with rectal temperature being 0.3–0.6 °C (0.5–1 °F) higher than oral temperature, while axillary temperature is 0.3–0.6 °C (0.5–1 °F) lower than oral temperature. The average difference between oral and axillary temperatures of Indian children aged 6–12 was found to be only 0.1 °C (standard deviation 0.2 °C), and the mean difference in Maltese children aged 4–14 between oral and axillary temperature was 0.56 °C, while the mean difference between rectal and axillary temperature for children under 4 years old was 0.38 °C.\n\nIn humans, a diurnal variation has been observed dependent on the periods of rest and activity, lowest at 11 p.m. to 3 a.m. and peaking at 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Monkeys also have a well-marked and regular diurnal variation of body temperature that follows periods of rest and activity, and is not dependent on the incidence of day and night; nocturnal monkeys reach their highest body temperature at night and lowest during the day. Sutherland Simpson and J.J. Galbraith observed that all nocturnal animals and birds – whose periods of rest and activity are naturally reversed through habit and not from outside interference – experience their highest temperature during the natural period of activity (night) and lowest during the period of rest (day). Those diurnal temperatures can be reversed by reversing their daily routine.\n\nIn essence, the temperature curve of diurnal birds is similar to that of man and other homoeothermal animals, except that the maximum occurs earlier in the afternoon and the minimum earlier in the morning. Also, the curves obtained from rabbits, guinea pigs, and dogs were quite similar to those from man. These observations indicate that body temperature is partially regulated by circadian rhythms.\n\nDuring the follicular phase (which lasts from the first day of menstruation until the day of ovulation), the average basal body temperature in women ranges from 36.45 to 36.7 °C (97.6 to 98.1 °F). Within 24 hours of ovulation, women experience an elevation of 0.15–0.45 °C (0.2–0.9 °F) due to the increased metabolic rate caused by sharply elevated levels of progesterone. The basal body temperature ranges between 36.7–37.3 °C (98.1–99.2 °F) throughout the luteal phase, and drops down to pre-ovulatory levels within a few days of menstruation. Women can chart this phenomenon to determine whether and when they are ovulating, so as to aid conception or contraception.\n\nFever is a regulated elevation of the set point of core temperature in the hypothalamus, caused by circulating pyrogens produced by the immune system. To the subject, a rise in core temperature due to fever may result in feeling cold in an environment where people without fever do not.\n\nSome monks are known to practice Tummo, biofeedback meditation techniques, that allow them to raise their body temperatures substantially.\n\nIt has been theorised that low body temperature may increase lifespan. In 2006, it was reported that transgenic mice with a body temperature 0.3–0.5 C lower than normal mice lived longer than normal mice. This mechanism is due to overexpressing the uncoupling protein 2 in hypocretin neurons (Hcrt-UCP2), which elevated hypothalamic temperature, thus forcing the hypothalamus to lower body temperature. Lifespan was increased by 12% and 20% for males and females, respectively. The mice were fed \"ad libitum\". The effects of such a genetic change in body temperature on longevity is more difficult to study in humans; in 2011, the UCP2 genetic alleles in humans were associated with obesity.\n\nThere are limits both of heat and cold that an endothermic animal can bear and other far wider limits that an ectothermic animal may endure and yet live. The effect of too extreme a cold is to decrease metabolism, and hence to lessen the production of heat. Both catabolic and anabolic pathways share in this metabolic depression, and, though less energy is used up, still less energy is generated. The effects of this diminished metabolism become telling on the central nervous system first, especially the brain and those parts concerning consciousness; both heart rate and respiration rate decrease; judgment becomes impaired as drowsiness supervenes, becoming steadily deeper until the individual loses consciousness; without medical intervention, death by hypothermia quickly follows. Occasionally, however, convulsions may set in towards the end, and death is caused by asphyxia.\n\nIn experiments on cats performed by Sutherland Simpson and Percy T. Herring, the animals were unable to survive when rectal temperature fell below 16 °C. At this low temperature, respiration became increasingly feeble; heart-impulse usually continued after respiration had ceased, the beats becoming very irregular, appearing to cease, then beginning again. Death appeared to be mainly due to asphyxia, and the only certain sign that it had taken place was the loss of knee-jerks.\n\nHowever, too high a temperature speeds up the metabolism of different tissues to such a rate that their metabolic capital is soon exhausted. Blood that is too warm produces dyspnea by exhausting the metabolic capital of the respiratory centre; heart rate is increased; the beats then become arrhythmic and eventually cease. The central nervous system is also profoundly affected by hyperthermia and delirium, and convulsions may set in. Consciousness may also be lost, propelling the person into a comatose condition. These changes can sometimes also be observed in patients suffering from an acute fever. Mammalian muscle becomes rigid with heat rigor at about 50 °C, with the sudden rigidity of the whole body rendering life impossible.\n\nH.M. Vernon performed work on the death temperature and paralysis temperature (temperature of heat rigor) of various animals. He found that species of the same class showed very similar temperature values, those from the Amphibia examined being 38.5 °C, fish 39 °C, reptiles 45 °C, and various molluscs 46 °C. Also, in the case of pelagic animals, he showed a relation between death temperature and the quantity of solid constituents of the body. In higher animals, however, his experiments tend to show that there is greater variation in both the chemical and physical characteristics of the protoplasm and, hence, greater variation in the extreme temperature compatible with life.\n\nThe maximum temperatures tolerated by certain thermophilic arthropods exceeds the lethal temperatures for most vertebrates.\n\nThe most heat-resistant insects are three genera of desert ants recorded from three different parts of the world. The ants have developed a lifestyle of scavenging for short durations during the hottest hours of the day, in excess of , for the carcasses of insects and other forms of life which have succumbed to heat stress.\n\nIn April 2014, the South Californian mite \"Paratarsotomus macropalpis\" has been recorded as the world's fastest land animal relative to body length, at a speed of 322 body lengths per second. Besides the unusually great speed of the mites, the researchers were surprised to find the mites running at such speeds on concrete at temperatures up to , which is significant because this temperature is well above the lethal limit for the majority of animal species. In addition, the mites are able to stop and change direction very quickly.\n\n\n"}

Victim mentality depends on clear thought processes and attribution. In most cases, those with a victim mentality have in fact been the victim of wrongdoing by others or have otherwise suffered misfortune through no fault of their own; however, such misfortune does not necessarily imply that one will respond by developing a \"pervasive and universal\" victim mentality where one frequently or constantly perceives oneself to be a victim.\n\nThe term is also used in reference to the tendency for recognizing one's misfortunes on somebody else's misdeeds, which is also referred to as victimism. \n\nVictim mentality is primarily developed, for example, from family members and situations during childhood. Similarly, criminals often engage in victim thinking, believing themselves to be moral and engaging in crime only as a reaction to an immoral world and furthermore feeling that authorities are unfairly singling them out for persecution. \n\nIn the most general sense, a victim is anyone who experiences injury, loss, or misfortune as a result of some event or series of events. This negative experience, however, is insufficient for the emergence of a sense of victimhood. Individuals may identify as a victim if they believe that:\nThe desire of empathy is crucial in that the mere experience of a harmful event is not enough for the emergence of the sense of being a victim. In order to have this sense, there is the need to perceive the harm as undeserved, unjust and immoral, an act that could not be prevented by the victim. The need to obtain empathy and understanding can then emerge.\n\nIndividuals harbouring a victim mentality would believe that:\nIn essence, victim mentality is a method of avoiding responsibility and criticism, receiving attention and compassion, and evading feelings of genuine anger.\n\nA victim mentality may manifest itself in a range of different behaviours or ways of thinking and talking:\n\nIn has been typically characterized by attitudes of pessimism, self-pity, and repressed anger. People with victim mentality may develop convincing and sophisticated explanations in support of such ideas, which they then use to explain to themselves and others of their situation.\n\nPeople with victim mentality may also be generally:\n\nA victim mentality may be reflected by linguistic markers or habits, such as pretending\n\nVictims of abuse and manipulation often get trapped into a self-image of victimisation. The psychological profile of victimisation includes a pervasive sense of helplessness, passivity, loss of control, pessimism, negative thinking, strong feelings of guilt, shame, self-blame and depression. This way of thinking can lead to hopelessness and despair.\n\nSince victim mentality is primarily a reaction to one's experiences and not inborn, it is possible to change it which may be provoked by an extraordinary situation or crisis. Since recognizing naive and condescending suggestions is a general characteristic feature of victim mentality, a person with victim mentality will generally not respond positively to attempts by another person to wrongly identify the problem and its solution. For this reason, the condition may become chronic.\n\nHowever, successful identified techniques have included therapeutic teaching methods regarding concepts of normative decision theory, emotional intelligence, cognitive therapy, and psychological locus of control. These methods have proven helpful in allowing individuals with a victim mentality mindset to both recognize and release the mindset.\n\nOne may consider collective victimhood in political settings. If the leaders of a country, and the citizens who support them, collectively feel like victims of neighboring countries (e.g. following past border disputes), those leaders may be more likely to advocate violent conflict resolution or suppression of freedom of speech.\n\nPolitical psychologists Bar-Tal and Chernyak-Hai write that collective victim mentality develops from a progression of self-realization, social recognition, and eventual attempts to maintain victimhood status.\n\n\n\n"}

Proponents believe water birth results in a more relaxed, less painful experience that promotes a midwife-led model of care. Critics argue that the safety of water birth has not been scientifically proven and that a wide range of adverse neonatal outcomes have been documented, including increased mother or child infections and the possibility of infant drowning. A 2018 Cochrane Review of water immersion in the first stages of labor found evidence of fewer epidurals and few adverse effects but insufficient information regarding giving birth in water. Parent, child, and birthing organizations have produced statements both supporting and criticizing water birthing.\n\nA moderate to weak level of evidence indicates that water immersion during the first stage of childbirth reduces the pain of labor. A 2018 Cochrane Review found that immersion during the first stage of childbirth reduces the use of epidurals, however there is no clear evidence on the benefits of water immersion for the second stage of labor or full water birth. There is no evidence of increased adverse effects for immersion during the first or second stages of labor. There is not strong evidence that a water birth reduces tearing or perineal trauma. \n\nWater birth may offer perineal support for a birthing mother, and some theorize that this may decrease the risk of tearing and reduce the use of episiotomy.\n\nA 2014 review reported that it has been found that water immersion during the first stage of labor can reduce the length of the first stage, reduce labor pain, and the use of epidural/spinal analgesia. It is also associated with a lower rate of cesarean delivery and stress urinary incontinence symptoms 42 days after delivery. The review reported that immersion during labor did not appear to increase the rate of infections for the mother or the baby, and APGAR scores for the baby were similar to that of conventional births.\n\nThe British Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists and the Royal College of Midwives issued a joint statement supporting water birth for healthy women with uncomplicated pregnancies but does not recommend it in cases of complications.\n\nIn a 2005 commentary, the Committee on Fetus and Newborn of the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) released an analysis of the scientific literature regarding underwater births. The Committee noted several positive studies for underwater birth but went on to criticize them for lacking proper scientific controls, a significant number of infant deaths and diseases, and the general lack of information to support the use of water births. The paper concluded:\n\nThe safety and efficacy of underwater birth for the newborn has not been established. There is no convincing evidence of benefit to the neonate but some concern for serious harm. Therefore, underwater birth should be considered an experimental procedure that should not be performed except within the context of an appropriately designed RCT after informed parental consent.\n\nThe AAP received numerous letters in response to the statement, many claiming passionately that water birth had strong benefits and minimal risks for both parents and children and criticizing the AAP for failing to publish positive studies about the practice. In response, an author of the statement noted that the claims made were unsubstantiated and based purely on anecdotal evidence, with no randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that would allow an evidence-based assessment of the safety and benefits of water births. The author concluded by urging for proponents to support such a trial so that the question could be answered. The editor of the journal \"Pediatrics\", where the commentary was published, noted that no such trials had ever been submitted to the journal, which had a policy against publishing articles that are not based on scientific evidence. The reply concluded that \"I have not received any science-based commentaries from the groups that you cite in your letter. We cannot publish every letter, based on opinions only, that we receive.\"\n\nA birth pool is a specially designed vessel containing water for women to immerse themselves in for pain relief during labour. Birth pools work on the same principle as a bathtub, but are distinct from them due to buoyancy and freedom of movement, factors deemed to be important in labour. A birth pool can either be permanently installed or portable. Getting into a pool of water for labour is often called \"water birth\" because some women choose to remain in the water for birth as well.\n\nHealth policy in England stipulates women should be given the opportunity to labour in water through the publication of Intrapartum care guidelines issued in 2007 by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE). The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists and the Royal College of Midwives have jointly supported labour and birthing in water, and encourage hospitals to ensure birth pools are available to all women.\n\nImmersing in water in a birth pool is one of the methods available to manage pain during labour, in addition to TENS machine, Gas and air, Pethidine injection, deep breathing, massage and epidural.\n\nBefore birth pools became readily available there are many stories of women labouring and birthing in re-purposed tub-like products including animal watering troughs.\n\nOrdinary bathtubs found in American and British homes are not adequate to provide enough room for women to comfortably move and try different positions in labour, such as squatting or kneeling, and are not deep enough to create buoyancy. In order to create the feeling of weightlessness through buoyancy the water needs to almost cover the women's breasts while she is sitting and should cover her belly while she is squatting, leaning over the side of the pool or kneeling upright in the pool sitting back on her heels.\n\nThe original circular birth pool Dr Michel Odent used at Pithiviers hospital (France) in the early 1980s was two meters in diameter and .6 meters deep, large enough to accommodate two people and make it difficult for interference during the birthing process. Modern birth pools are somewhat smaller with a diameter between 110-150 centimeters and at least twenty, preferably twenty-two, inches of water.\n\nFactors to consider when choosing a birth pool are:\n\nBirth pools are generally categorised between two broad types: permanently installed or portable. Many hospitals in the United Kingdom now have a birth pool plumbed in, and portable birth pools can be purchased or hired for use at home or in hospital.\n\n"}

The late D, E and F versions of the \"Anglo-Saxon Chronicle\" describe Æthelstan as Æthelwulf's brother, but the A, B and C versions, and Æthelweard's \"Chronicon\", state that he was Æthelwulf's son. Some historians have argued that it is more probable that he was a brother, including Eric John in 1966 and Ann Williams in 1978. However, in 1991 Ann Williams described him as Æthelwulf's son, and this is now generally accepted by historians, including Frank Stenton, Barbara Yorke, and D. P. Kirby.\n\nWhen Æthelwulf became King of the West Saxons in 839 on the death of his father, Egbert, he appointed Æthelstan to rule over Kent, Essex, Surrey and Sussex. He is styled king in the \"Anglo-Saxon Chronicle\" and Æthelweard's chronicle calls him \"King of the Dwellers in Kent, of the East Saxons, of the South Saxons and of Surrey\". He attested a number of his father's charters as king in the 840s.\n\nIn 851, Æthelstan and Ealdorman Ealhhere defeated a Viking fleet and army off Sandwich, Kent, described by Frank Stenton as \"the first naval battle in recorded English history\". Æthelstan is not mentioned after 851 and presumably died before Æthelwulf went to Rome in 855 as he was not included in arrangements for government of the kingdom during his father's absence. In 853 Ealhhere died in a disastrous defeat of the men of Kent and Surrey by the Vikings, and as Æthelstan is not mentioned as present at the battle he was probably dead by then.\n\n"}
