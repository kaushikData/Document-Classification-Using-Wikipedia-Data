He debuted in 1990, wrestling on the independent circuit under the ring name \"Al the Sledgehammer\".\n\nPoling achieved his greatest national exposure in Eastern Championship Werstling (ECW) in the mid-1990s. He debuted in ECW as an unnamed \"handler\" to Sabu on the January 18, 1994 episode of \"Eastern Championship Wrestling\" by defeating Chad Austin. He joined Paul Heyman's Dangerous Alliance stable with Sabu and The Tazmaniac. His gimmick was as an enforcer of the \"extreme\" attitude; he was named 911 at \"The Night The Line was Crossed\" on February 5, where he defeated Chad Austin in a rematch. As part of his monstrous persona, he would frequently perform the chokeslam on others with little provocation, which made him quickly popular with the crowd as a fan favorite. He received his first title shot in ECW at \"When Worlds Collide\", where he challenged Mikey Whipwreck for the ECW Television Championship but got disqualified after chokeslamming the referee. He would then enter a rivalry with Mr. Hughes, whom he defeated at Hardcore Heaven. On August 27, at the NWA World Title Tournament, 911 participated in the namesake tournament for the vacant NWA World Heavyweight Championship, where he defeated Doink the Clown in the quarter-final after four chokeslams, before losing to 2 Cold Scorpio in the semi-final. He closed the year by defeating The Pitbulls in a handicap match at Holiday Hell. Poling received the \"Pro Wrestling Illustrated\" Rookie of the Year award due to his enormous popularity in ECW for the year 1994.\n\nPoling had two big matches in 1995, scoring wins over Ron Simmons at Hostile City Showdown and Jim Steele at \"Barbed Wire, Hoodies and Chokeslams\". At the 1996 House Party event, 911 teamed with Rey Misterio, Jr. to defeat The Eliminators in a tag team match, which would turn out to be his last match in ECW. He got involved in a brawl with Taz after the match and a feud evolved between the two, but it was scrapped as Poling left the promotion by early 1996 after a falling out backstage with Paul Heyman over the former's treatment of the ring crew.\nPoling wrestled in World Championship Wrestling (WCW) in 1996 and 1997, under the names Tombstone, Sledge Hammer and Big Al. Poling did not portray the Big Al who feuded with Tank Abbott in WCW in early 2000.\n\nIn 1998, Poling returned to ECW at UltraClash in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, chokeslamming Bill Wiles. Poling was then accompanied by manager Judge Jeff Jones, who proclaimed 911 to be the true giant of professional wrestling. They were then interrupted by Spike Dudley and had an impromptu match, which 911 lost in under a minute.\n\nThroughout the late 1990s, 911 appeared with the New Jersey based Jersey All Pro Wrestling promotion, winning the JAPW Heavyweight Championship on two occasions. He made an appearance at Pro-Pain Pro Wrestling \"A War Renewed\" on June 29th, 2002 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, interfering on the behalf of Tod Gordon and Sabu, delivering a chokeslam to Sandman (who had just been betrayed by his partner, Bill Alfonso). At \"Hardcore Homecoming\" in 2005 he chokeslammed both Danny Doring and Roadkill. He wrestled at New York Wrestling League in 2008.\n\nPoling resides in West Creek, New Jersey.\n\n"}

{"id": "2546911", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2546911", "title": "Al pastor", "text": "Al pastor\n\nAl pastor (from Spanish, \"shepherd style\"), also known as tacos al pastor, is a dish developed in central Mexico that is based on shawarma spit-grilled meat brought by Lebanese immigrants to Mexico. Being derived from shawarma, it is also similar to the Turkish döner kebab and the Greek gyros. In contrast to döner kebab and shawarma however, tacos al pastor are pork based. In some places of northern Mexico, as in Baja California, this taco is called taco de adobada. A similar dish from Puebla with different spices is tacos árabes.\n\nA wave of mainly Christian Lebanese immigration to Mexico took place in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. In the 1960s, Mexican-born progeny of Lebanese immigrants began opening their own restaurants and combining their heritage with Mexican cuisine.\nGrilling a vertical spit of stacked meat slices and cutting it off as it cooks was developed in the 19th century in Ottoman Turkey. This is döner kebab, which is the origin of tacos al pastor, Middle Eastern shawarma, and Greek gyros.\n\nPork is marinated in a combination of dried chilies, spices and pineapple. In some places, achiote is also added, and then slowly cooked with a gas flame on a vertical rotisserie called a \"trompo\" (lit: spinning top), very similar to how shawarma is cooked, with a piece of fresh onion and a pineapple on top. When ready, the meat is then thinly sliced off the spit with a large knife. It is served on small tortillas, with finely chopped onions, cilantro, and occasionally a small slice of pineapple, and usually topped with some lemon or lime juice and hot salsa. This meat is a common ingredient in not just tacos, but also gringas, alambres, huaraches, tortas, burritos and pizza.\n\nIn some places of northern Mexico, such as Nuevo León, Durango and Chihuahua, these are usually called \"tacos de trompo\" if served on corn tortillas, and \"gringas\" if they are served with cheese on wheat tortillas.\n\nA similar dish is called \"tacos árabes\", which originated in Puebla in the 1930s from Arab Mexican cuisine. Tacos árabes use shawarma-style meat carved from a spit, but are served in a pita-style bread called \"pan árabe\". These tacos have been brought by Mexican immigrants to the United States in the past few years and have become popular in cities, such as Chicago and Los Angeles, two of the largest Mexican/Mexican-American population centers in the United States.\n\nA non-pork version featuring chicken marinated in the \"al pastor\" style was brought \"back\" to the Middle East in the early 2000s, and sold as \"shawarma mexici\". It is essentially a chicken shawarma made in the Middle Eastern style (wrapped with garlic mayonnaise, dill pickle, and french fries in a thin flatbread).\n\n"}

He was the second son and youngest of five children of Fanny Georgiana Charlotte Askew (née Browne 1830–1900) and Rev. John Askew, M.A. (1804–1881). Claude's older sisters and brother were: Amy Ellen Cary Askew (10 June 1857 – 29 April 1945), Isabel Emily Florence Askew (16 November 1858 – 30 October 1928), Mabel Fanny Mary Askew (23 February 1861 – 21 August 1941), and Hugh Henry John Percy Cary Askew (18 September 1862 – 14 April 1949).\n\nClaude was educated at Eton College (1879–1883), \"... and there wrote a play in blank verse...\" It was probably during this period — certainly after 1877 and before 1883 — when Claude was taken on a holiday to Vevey (between Montreux and Lausanne) on Lake Geneva, where he met the future King Peter I of Serbia – then in exile in Geneva. \"I was a small boy, spending my holidays with my people at Vevy on the Lake of Geneva, and at the hotel we struck up an acquaintance with Prince Peter Karageorgevitch. He was then in the prime of life, tall, dark, handsome—not yet married.\" He wrote this many years later recalling this childhood encounter when he met up with him once more – this time with his wife Alice and during the much darker circumstances of the 'Great Serbian Retreat' during World War I (see below). \"At Koshumlja to-day we saw the King. Curiously enough, this was the first time that I have come across him since I have been in Serbia, though Alice has seen him at Topola. He is a fine old man, and neither trouble, sickness, nor age has bowed him.\"\nAlice was born on 18 June 1874 at No. 3 Westbourne Street, near Hyde Park in London, England; and christened Alice Jane de Courcy on 5 August 1874 at the church of St. Michael and All Angels in Paddington, London. She was the eldest daughter of Jane Leake (née Dashwood 1844–1912) and Henry Leake (1829–1899), who following his retirement from the British army, was granted the honorary rank of Lt-Colonel. At the time of her birth he was a Captain, on half pay, late of the 70th (Surrey) Regiment of Foot. She had two younger siblings: Henry Dashwood Stucley Leake (17 Feb 1876 – 2 June 1970), and Frances Beatrice Levine Leake (27 May 1878 – 29 Aug 1884).\n\nShe began writing \"for her own amusement\" before her marriage, did have one short story published under her own name alone (or rather initials), \"A. J. de C. L.\" = Alice Jane de Courcy Leake: 'A Modern-Day Saint', which appeared in 1894 in \"Belgravia\" of London.\n\nAlice and Claude were married on 10 July 1900, at Christ Church, Lancaster Gate, London.\n\nShortly after their marriage, Alice and Claude Askew began writing together and the first novel under their joint names, \"The Shulamite,\" was published in 1904. Afterwards Claude, together with Edward Knoblock, wrote a stage adaptation of it, which was first produced in 1906 at the Savoy Theatre, London starring Lena Ashwell, and a little later with Miss Ashwell in the same role in New York City. In 1921 Paramount Pictures produced a silent film version with the title \"Under the Lash\" starring Gloria Swanson, and directed by Sam Wood. The couple went on to publish \"a large number of novels and serial stories\".\n\nIn 1915, during the First World War, both Alice and Claude Askew traveled to Serbia as part of a relief effort with a British field hospital that would be attached to the Second Serbian Army. They were also Special Correspondents for the British newspaper \"Daily Express\". As Claude himself describes their role: \"As for Alice and myself, we went out essentially as writers, though we were prepared to turn our hands to odd jobs if called upon to do so. We had assisted Dr. Hartnell Beavis in London with the formation of the unit, the raising of funds, and the collection of stores. It was the reports in the English Press of the terrible state into which Serbia had fallen during the winter of 1914–1915 that first inspired us to work for that gallant little country.\" He wrote this in their personal account of their experiences and impressions accompanying the Serbian army on its famous 'Great Retreat' across the mountains from Prishtina to Alessio, during the winter of 1915–16, which was published in 1916 under the title: \"The Stricken Land: Serbia As We Saw It.\" The authors had spent some six months in Serbia before the retreat and wrote with sympathy and real knowledge of Serbia and the Serbian character. Claude Askew was given the honorary commission of a major in the Serbian army.\n\nFollowing the 'Great Serbian Retreat' (see: Serbian Campaign), when the bulk of the Serbian army had been evacuated to the Greek island of Corfu, Alice and Claude both returned to England, which they reached by April 1916. By sometime in May, after finishing and arranging the publication of \"The Stricken Land\", Claude was back with the Serbian army – now at Salonika (as Thessaloniki was then called in English), where he was working out of its Press Bureau. But Alice remained in London to give birth to her third child, who was born towards the end of July 1916. She was also spending the time in England soliciting support for the relief work with Serbia. But in October she also returned to the theatre of war and was with her husband Claude in Salonika until about the end of April of the following year, when she went to Corfu to work with the Serbian Red Cross there, under Colonel Borissavljevitch.\n\nSometime between at least September and October 1917, Alice and Claude were on leave in Italy – perhaps in Rome to meet up with their two older children. Then they set out to return to Corfu. During the night of 5–6 October 1917 (or possibly the 4th) when they were traveling on the Italian steamer \"Città di Bari\" from Taranto to Corfu, it suffered a torpedo attack by the German submarine, SM UB-48 \"about 37 miles from Paxo\" (or Paxoi) and was sunk. Both drowned in the incident. Claude's body was never recovered, but on 29 October the body of a woman was \"found on the seashore at Porto Karboni on the island of Korčula\" by a local fisherman. The next day it was examined by the authorities and, from various letters and telegrams that were found about her person, identified as that of the \"well-known English lady writer Alice Askew of London.\" Alice Askew was then buried that same day 30 October 1917 at Porto Karboni. And a stone cross was erected there, bearing the following inscription: ALICE ASKEW / - (roughly translated from the original Croatian: \"ALICE ASKEW / English writer / delivered up from the sea 29 / and buried / by commission / 30 October 1917\").\n\nPreviously – on 21 October 1917, a memorial service for Alice and Claude Askew was held at the Serbian Church in Corfu, attended by a large number of both Serbian and British officials. It was conducted by the Archbishop of Serbia, \"who paid an eloquent and touching tribute to the benevolent work of Major and Mrs. Askew, to whom, he said, the Serbian people owed eternal gratitude\".\n\nAlice and Claude Askew were survived by one son and two daughters.\n\n\n\n \n"}

He lined himself up to face the monster-punching full WBC titlist, Edwin Valero.\n\nDeMarco's first chance at being world champion was unsuccessful after he was stopped by the late Edwin Valero of Venezuela to retain his WBC Lightweight belt. After absorbing 9 rounds of punishment, DeMarco's trainer advised the referee to stop the fight. DeMarco later stated, “I'm a Mexican fighter, I never wanted to quit but my trainer saw that Edwin was just a better fighter.” When the fight ended, Valero was eight points up on the scorecards of all three judges.\n\nDeMarco rebounded with a second-round TKO victory over Daniel Attah.

A full back, he made over 170 appearances in the Football League. He featured prominently in Bristol City's successes in the first decade of the 20th century under manager Harry Thickett. He also played for Sunderland, Sheffield United, and Burslem Port Vale. He helped Bristol City to the Second Division title in 1905–06, a second-place finish in the First Division in 1906–07, and also played in the FA Cup final in 1909.\n\nBorn in Carnwath, Lanarkshire, he was the youngest of 13 children born to Walter Annan, a colliery manager, and his wife Marion (\"née\" Storry). A lifelong teetotaller, Annan joined local club West Calder in August 1899, before moving onto Edinburgh club St Bernard's in May 1900. No Scottish league appearances are recorded for either club. In April 1902 he moved to Sunderland in the First Division of the Football League. He made a solitary appearance at right back in 2–1 win over Notts County on 4 April 1903, in a season when Sunderland finished third, only a single point behind champions Sheffield Wednesday. In January 1904 he moved on to Sheffield United, and made his league debut for the \"Blades\" at left back in a 2–0 defeat at Everton on 9 January 1904. He made a total of nine appearances at full back, deputising for Harry Thickett and Boyle in 1903–04. Annan made 18 appearances in 1904–05, as United finished sixth in the First Division.\n\nAnnan followed manager Harry Thickett to Ashton Gate for £200 in April 1905. When Bristol City finished as Second Division champions in 1905–06, Annan was ever-present with 38 appearances at right-back, and formed a notable defensive full back partnership with Joe Cottle. Ever present again for a second successive season in 1906–07, City finished the campaign as runners-up in the First Division. Annan played just 13 games in 1907–08 as new signing Bob Young was preferred at right-back. In 1908–09, Annan replaced Young as the regular right-back, making 26 appearances and playing in all 10 FA Cup ties, including the 1909 FA Cup Final – City lost the final 1–0 to Manchester United at Crystal Palace. He made a further 28 appearances in 1909–10, and was again replaced by Bob Young in the later stages of the season. Annan did not feature in the City team in the 1910–11 season, as Bristol City were relegated back to the Second Division. The final league match of the season, a 1–0 defeat to Everton on 29 April 1911, was awarded as a joint benefit for Arthur Spear and Archie Annan, although neither played in the game.\n\nIn July 1911, Annan moved onto Burslem Port Vale. He made his debut at the Athletic Ground in a 1–0 win over Oldham Athletic Reserves on 4 September, but injured himself in a match against Crewe Alexandra twelve days later. He failed to hold onto his first team place upon his recovery, and was released at the end of the 1911–12 season, after picking up a Central League runners-up medal.\n\nAnnan was appointed manager of Welsh Southern Football League club Mid Rhondda in July 1911, where he was assisted by former Bristol City colleagues Joe Cottle and Bill Demmery. He subsequently returned to Bristol City in March 1921 and spent five years as coach at the club. He was later a police constable stationed at St George in Bristol.\n\nSource:\n\n\n"}
{"id": "38085161", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=38085161", "title": "Bahá'í Faith on life after death", "text": "Bahá'í Faith on life after death\n\nThe Bahá'í Faith affirms the prospect of life after death extensively while not defining everything about it. The soul on death is said to recognize the value of its deeds and begin a new phase of a conscious relationship with God though negative experiences are possible. Others have noted the religion's stances on the afterlife.\n\nThe soul is not considered to be subject to natural law - rather it is subject to spiritual law as a covenant between man and God and it takes identity at the conception of the embryo, but not \"in\" the body, rather, associated with it like light to a mirror. Heaven is a soul being close to God, not a place but a condition, as it undergoes an eternal spiritual evolution. Anyone who learns and applies virtues and guidance of God \"goes to\" heaven. Hell is similarly being far from God, not a place, but of failing to understand and apply virtues and guidance from God. Progress from even the worst condition is possible even in the next world but not until the individual fundamentally overcomes rejecting Godly virtues. Labels we call ourselves by and theologies we claim to adhere to are not as important as the reality of spiritual virtues like courage, justice, love, understanding, etc., actually expressed by choice in our lives. Development of the spiritual life reaches a milestone whether in this life or the next in developing the \"spirit of faith\" a gift of the Holy Spirit, which then continues to grow in the individual's soul. But if our ability to express Godly virtues is conditional so is our condition in the afterlife - there is a spectrum of achievement so a purgatory-like environment is possible for those who have not well embraced Godly virtues and those that have not largely rejected them. Indeed, the next world's life is sometimes delineated in stages. Bahá'ís believe a significant purpose of revelation is to guide the spiritual development of the individual and that accepting the prophet of God is important as a significant chance at advancing the conditional achievement of discovering the virtues themselves and expressing them. If one succeeds in achieving these to a superlative degree then that person will be of benefit to all mankind from the afterlife while those who are far from God have no power to affect the living any more. Indeed, evil is not viewed as a power in the next world - people who are evil are described as \"atrophied\" and \"enfeebled\" and that accounts of \"possession\" are about people who have yielded to their own darker passions and baser nature.\n\nEven though heaven is a condition more than a place it is still described as a realm where those who are close to God also are close to each other. Thus in the afterlife one encounters the prophets of old and other historical people. While the individual experiences dramatic changes from birth and the stages of life in this world then death and life beyond, Bahá'ís hold it is the same soul, the same sense of identity, through the dramatic changes of circumstances. However the worlds of the womb, life in this world and the life beyond are actually interwoven. It's not like moving to a distant place - the afterlife is also \"here\", unseen by those living on earth. Life in this world affects that one and life in that one affects this. Death is about the letting go of the physical frame and its requirements and has no real identity itself.\n\nJudgement Day is perceived to be about the time after a new Revelator when the followers of the former dispensation are judged/tested. If they are affirmed they are \"raised\" or \"return\" (not as individuals but as types of people, like John the Baptist was the return of Elijah but not Elijah himself.) The circumstances of mass \"resurrection\" in the last days refers to when the process will be world embracing rather than in one country or people or another. This is also one of many reasons why Bahá'ís do not believe in the literal return to earth of the same individual soul as is believed by those who hold to reincarnation. Thus this Judgement Day is not the same as the judgement that happens after death but there too there is a judgement and the reality behind the words one lived by are measured. Rewards for correctly applying virtues and punishments for incorrectly doing so are settled but ongoing learning still takes place starting in the last moments of earthly life. Bahá'ís believe we will know and converse with those we have known as well as those who have already died.\n\nExpressing information about the afterlife is inherently limited in this life. It is explained that the next life is fundamentally different in many ways from this life. The parallel is made comparing life in the womb with this life and the changes after birth to the changes after death. Realities of the latter are not available even as concepts in the former - they are ineffable. The idea of a body in the next world is still present but it is a heavenly body. There is a realm of lights and reunion with deceased associates. God will be witnessed as if it were a sun in the sky but there is no night. The sanctity of human nature is affirmed when it reflects the light of God and the truths of existence become known and a basic fear of death is overcome and a universal acceptance of the religions as coming from one source.\n\nAmong the specific rules Bahá'ís are to try to follow concerning death are, depending on the civil law of their country:\n\n\nMourning, the distress and pain of the loss of contact with friends and kin for Bahá'ís is, aside from cultural issues and norms in society, characterized as another stage of life - a temporary condition that will be changed someday just as someday the infant in the womb comes into the material world through birth and into the company of family and friends. Not avoiding the sense of loss, Baha'u'llah emphasizes the sense of mystery in death, pointing out that though he has shared some aspects of death and afterlife:\"“The Mysteries of man’s physical death and of his return have not been divulged, and still remain unread… Were they to be revealed, they would evoke such fear and sorrow that some would perish, while others would be so filled with gladness as to wish for death, and beseech, with unceasing longing, the one true God – exalted be His Glory – to hasten their end.” As this is not apparent to anyone, instead we struggle with the fact of death.\n\nBahá'ís do allow for cultural norms of societies they live in. For example, among the indigenous of Papua New Guinea Christian missionaries had openly opposed traditional funerary art and performances while the Bahá'ís encouraged their production as a form of worship. Thus while Nalik Bahá'ís are regarded by other Naliks as arbiters of traditional knowledge and practices, the Christian missions and their followers are seen as antagonistic to kastom.\n\nBahá'ís view prayers in this world as of use to those who have passed on as are indeed their prayers for us still living in this world. Additionally remembering the lives of those who died, their achievements of virtues, and services carried out in their name is actually of assistance to those who have died.\n\nA Practical Reference to Religious Diversity for Operational Police and Emergency Services is designed to offer guidance to police and emergency services personnel on how religious affiliation can affect their contact with the public. The second edition published in 2002 in Australia mentioned norms that could be expected of Bahá'ís in the case of dying or death. It states that Bahá'ís believe in life after death, holding that the soul is created at the moment of conception and will retain its individuality in an eternal realm. The body, which is compared to the lamp holding the light of the soul during its time in this world, should be treated with dignity. Embalming is not to take place unless required by law. The body should be transported as little as possible after death, and interment must take place within an hour's travel time from the city or town where death occurs. Cremation is forbidden. From its scriptures it is said that \"the soul is a sign of God, a heavenly gem whose reality the most learned of men hath failed to grasp, and whose mystery no mind, however acute, can ever hope to unravel.\" These points are noted in other sources as well. Sociologist researchers have observed that Bahá'ís have an inclusivistic belief that although it may take work, most people will eventually be \"saved\" or get to heaven.\n\nTelevision coverage of the prayer vigil on CNN and C-Span for the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting included Bahá'í scripture to console the living so that their affect of the recently dead was less disruptive. The text used at the service was adapted to apply to parents and children and taken from Selections From the Writings of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá:\n\nThe related topics of death, dying, the soul and the afterlife are of interest in the religion - covered at length in the lifetimes of the central figures of the religion through questions asked by enquirers, and then these scriptures repeatedly compiled in books.\n\nThe \"Divine Art of Living\" is one such early work that has a chapter, The Realm of Immortality, which has section headings of: The Nature of the Soul, Punishments and Rewards, The Release of the Spirit, Life in the Next World, Consolation for the Bereaved, Prayers for the Departed. The early content originally appeared in successive issues of World Order magazine from April 1940 to September 1941 and was then reprinted and revised in a single volume in 1944, 1946, 1949, 1953, 1956, 1960, 1965, 1970, 1972, 1973, 1974, 1979, 1986, 2006. Bahá'ís have held conferences of the same name. The massive compilation \"Lights of Guidance: A Bahá'í Reference File\" published in 1983 had sections covering scriptural compilations on the topics. Approximately 10 books were published directly on the topic of life after death. In America the manual for Bahá'í Local Assemblies, \"Developing Distinctive Bahá'í Communities\", chapter 19, covers specifics burial practices and related topics and volume 1 of the \"Compilations of Compilations\" has an entry similarly titled. These topics were continued more recently in the Ruhi Institute project in its first workbook under the section \"Life and Death\", as well as many articles, sections or chapters in books, and whole books both scholarly and institutional.\n\nIn addition to outlining scriptural references examining the afterlife some have specifically examined parallels between the statements in the scriptures and scholarly statements about stages of Near-death experiences, notably:\n\n\nMany qualities reported by NDErs find parallels in Bahá'í writings - the quality of the experience being ineffable, having a heavenly body, a realm of light, meeting others, reviewing one's life, and meeting a superlative being of light. Additionally the kinds of positive transformation the NDErs report also find parallels in the values Bahá'ís are encouraged to seek - a new appreciation of knowledge and learning, the importance of love, an absence of fear of death, the importance of physical life on earth, a belief in the sanctity of human nature, and an emphasis on manifesting such positive attributes as love, justice, selfless service, unity, and peace - something viewed by NDErs and Bahá'ís as being important to all religions and rising above specifics of doctrines and sectarianism. Negative experiences of NDErs are also paralleled in Bahá'í writings - the effect of suicide, the prospect of \"limbo\" for \"breaking the rules\", that when taking the chance to learn from mistakes is important and that the life review includes facing the negative deeds done, even of hellish experiences.\n\nIn a paper describing patterns of understanding spiritual dreams and visions by Necati Alkan, `Abdu'l-Bahá, a key authority in the Bahá'í Faith, sometimes separates dreams and visions into three categories: true, interpretative, and confused. The first do not need interpretation but depend on having, according to `Abdu'l-Bahá in the words of Necati Alkan, \"a heart rid of all attachment and there must not exist idle thoughts in the mind.\" The second can be decoded for the truth, and the third only reflect \"the strife and contention\" of the experiencer. According to `Abdu'l-Bahá, the work of decoding the second type is like, in Necati Alkan words, \"if you add any colour to a white cloth, it will accept it; but if you add blue to a yellow cloth, it will become green and the truth is distorted. In order to have the true colour, one needs to remove the added colour.\" Indeed, sometimes `Abdu'l-Bahá notes such experiences can mean the opposite of what they seem.\n\nIn addition to general reviews of the statements of scriptures and comparisons of them with near death experiences in general there are a few individuals who have had their experiences published and shared.\n\nReinee Pasarow has presented her experiences which she relates to the religion. She published her story as early as 1981. At least one extended talk was video taped and is available online in a couple places. There are also extended partial transcripts. The talk has been analyzed from a religious point of view in a commentary and beyond. There is also an audio file of a similar but not identical talk. She felt her relationship with the religion came as a direct result of her NDE.\n\nP. M. H. Atwater claims Ricky Bradshaw co-founded International Association for Near-Death Studies (IANDS) with Dr. Kenneth Ring. He also joined the Bahá'í Faith as it was the best fit to his experiences in his view. His experience was reviewed in a number of publications and there are references to Bradshaw publishing his experience in some early journals not online indicating it was published in an early version of an NDE journal named (at the time) \"Anabiosis: Journal of Near Death Studies\", August 1979, page 11.\n\nIn addition to the above, two others have reported NDEs and have some relationship to the religion. In Atwater's more recent book \"Near-Death Experiences, the Rest of the Story: What They Teach Us about Living and Dying and Our True Purpose\" on p. 257 Atwater records an anecdote of another reference to the religion:\n\"It is my opinion,\" said Teri, \"that Michael has been living with the aftereffects since childhood. One afternoon he called me and asked if I wanted to go to church with him. I said no, but I would love to take him to Bahá'í Temple in Wilmette. After climbing the stairs to the Temple together we walked in a circle, reading inscriptions over the doors. Over one set of doors, facing East, we paused to read, \"Ye are the fruits of one tree and the leaves of one branch.' I looked up at Michael as tears welled in his eyes. I could feel his pain and frustration. It was the kind of frustration that comes with the knowledge of having crossed over, of having been 'there', of having returned from the threshold of death carrying his message for mankind with a remote memory of 'the other side'.\"\n\nNina Lembcke Holte Harvey has been interviewed by Warren Odess-Gillett on \"A Bahá'í Perspective\" for WXOJ-LP about her NDEs in her childhood.\n\nChief Albert Isaac of Aishihik is recorded as having identified a near death experience of his in 1957 with the Bahá'í Faith.\n\nMarie Watson, author of \"Two Paths\" in 1897, says she suffered a car accident in 1890 in Washington DC and reported having a vision and met a guide. She converted to the religion in 1901 and identified the guide as `Abdu'l-Bahá.\n\n\n"}

Despite multiple investigations, an arrest and a trial the woman has never been identified.\n\nThe body was found by a woman riding on horseback through Bedgebury Forest on Tuesday, 23 October 1979. The forest floor was dry as the weather had been dry and sunny for a few weeks. The body had been battered, mutilated, murdered and dumped but little attempt had been made to conceal the body and it was apparent in the undergrowth from the riders position. The victim had suffered massive head injuries from a beating. A bloodstained wooden stake found near the victims body was later concluded to have been the murder weapon. No handbag or means of identification were found with the body. Police believe that the victim had been killed up to five days prior to her discovery.\n\nThe severity of the injuries to the woman’s head and body prevented identification. The woman was aged between 30 and 35, she was quite short at 5ft 1in and she had a thin build. She had brown eyes and straight shoulder-length hair which she had kept in its natural, dark-brown colour\n\nThe victim was wearing black shoes, a distinctive floral dress, a black polo neck jumper and a yellow blouse. The police stated that the black and white patterned dress was the clue that was most likely to lead to the discovery of her identity. The dress was found to have been homemade from furniture fabric. It had been altered on multiple occasions; once to the hem and another to the chest area. The dress had been purchased at a charity, or second hand shop. Police believed that the victim was very poor and possibly from the north of England. \n\nThe autopsy revealed that the victim had an ectopic pregnancy which had been present for 4-6 weeks and bleeding for 2-3 weeks. The victim would have been in severe pain and may have visited a doctor suspecting appendicitis as the pain would have occurred on her right side. Stretch marks on her stomach indicated that she had probably given birth to at least one child.\n\nThe victim’s molars were very worn down and she had wisdom teeth which indicated that she was at least 30 years old. There was no evidence that the victim had ever visited a dentist in her life. The victim had prominent, visibly decayed teeth. No nicotine staining was found on the victim’s hands, teeth or lungs. Additionally, the victim’s lungs did not exhibit the carbon deposits typical of a city-dweller, indicating that she probably lived in the countryside. Police believe the woman was of no fixed address and was a regular hitchhiker along the M1 and M6 motorways and may have had a connection with the Vale of Evesham. There was a possibility that she may have been working as a sex worker, operating from Spitalfields in London.\nAfter the discovery the police searched the missing persons databases at New Scotland Yard and the UK Social Services. Hospitals and doctors surgeries were also polled for persons who matched the description of the woman. A large poster campaign was launched throughout the UK and Europe. All of these investigative efforts failed to produce a match to the woman's identity.\n\nIn December 1984 the victim was featured on an episode of the BBC TV program, Crimewatch. Police appealed for the persons that made, or altered the black and white dress to come forward.\n\nIn October 1998 the case was reopened after an investigation by forensic scientists on archived evidence. The victim's case was highlighted in the national media as one of a number of such cases that had been reopened due to a new DNA technique that enabled the generation of DNA profiles from much smaller samples than had been previously possible. The size of these samples was described as being as small as a single blood cell, or a flake of skin.\n\nIn January 1999 the first arrest in the case was made. Harry J R Pennells (b. q1 1925), then 75, of Ticehurst, East Sussex was charged with the victim’s murder. Pennells, who was 54 at the time of the murder was a retired lorry driver and had worked for Henley’s Transport who were based in Kent at the time of the murder. Pennells had originally been questioned by police a few days after the discovery of the body. He had been interviewed three times between 1979 and 1980 and was one of a number of suspects. He had not been charged following the initial investigation, however, after specks of blood found in his lorry in 1979 were re-examined and linked to the victim police were able to make their arrest. Pennells was subsequently bailed and a report was sent to the Crown Prosecution Service.\n\nOn 22 February 1999 the victim’s case was featured on Crimewatch for a second time. It was revealed that after the original Crimewatch appeal in 1984 the person who made the black-and-white dress had made contact. The woman, who was from Stratford-upon-Avon stated that she had given the dress to a charity shop in Evesham, Worcestershire after which, police could not trace it. It appeared to have been subsequently altered to shorten the length, remove the zip from the back and add a black lace ruff to the collar. An appeal was made for the person who made these alterations to come forward. \n\nThe trial started on 4 May 2000 at Maidstone Crown Court. Pennells was accused of picking up the victim at Spitalfields Market on 19 October 1979, taking her in his lorry to a delivery in Keighley, West Yorkshire, then back to drop her off in South London on the morning of the 20th October and beating the victim to death with a wooden stake. Pennells told the court that he had picked up a female hitchhiker. He admitted that the hitchhiker may have been the victim, but that he had dropped her off alive and was innocent of her murder. \n\nWitnesses called by the prosecution stated that they had seen a woman matching the victims description in Bedgebury Forest on 21 October 1979 which was the day after the murder was suspected to have happened according to some estimates. Two witnesses who were at the Keighley lorry depot stated that they saw, and spoke to, a young woman who was with Pennells. Staff at the Henley Transport's Rochdale depot also stated that they saw Pennells with a woman who was similar to an artist's impression made of the victim.\n\nSamples of blood and flakes of hair found in a sleeping bag on the passenger seat of the lorry matched the DNA profile of the victim. Additionally, particles of foam from a mattress in the cab of the lorry were found on the victim's dress. \n\nThe trial lasted for four weeks, after which Pennells was found not guilty in an unanimous decision made after the jury deliberated for 1 hour and 15 minutes.\n\nIn October 2007 the charity missing persons appealed to the public for someone to come forward and identify the woman.\n\n"}
{"id": "5034", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5034", "title": "Bela Lugosi", "text": "Bela Lugosi\n\nBéla Ferenc Dezső Blaskó (; 20 October 1882 – 16 August 1956), better known as Bela Lugosi (; ), was a Hungarian-American actor famous for portraying Count Dracula in the 1931 film and for his roles in other horror films.\n\nAfter playing small parts on the stage in his native Hungary, Lugosi got his first role in a film in 1917. He had to leave the country after the failed Hungarian Communist Revolution of 1919. He acted in several films in Weimar Germany before arriving in the United States as a seaman on a merchant ship.\n\nIn 1927, he appeared as Count Dracula in a Broadway adaptation of Bram Stoker's novel. He later appeared in the classic 1931 film \"Dracula\" by Universal Pictures. Through the 1930s, he occupied an important niche in popular horror films, with their East European setting, but his Hungarian accent limited his repertoire, and he tried unsuccessfully to avoid typecasting.\n\nMeanwhile, he was often paired with Boris Karloff, who was able to demand top billing. To his frustration, Lugosi, a charter member of the American Screen Actors Guild, was increasingly restricted to minor parts, kept employed by the studio principally so that they could put his name on the posters. Among his pairings with Karloff, he performed major roles only in \"The Black Cat\" (1934), \"The Raven\" (1935), and \"Son of Frankenstein\" (1939); even in \"The Raven\", Karloff received top billing despite Lugosi performing the lead role. By this time, Lugosi had been receiving regular medication for sciatic neuritis, and he became addicted to morphine and methadone. This drug dependence was noted by producers, and the offers eventually dwindled to a few parts in Ed Wood's low-budget films—most notably \"Plan 9 from Outer Space\". Lugosi, who was married five times and had one son, Bela George, died of a heart attack on August 16, 1956.\n\nLugosi, the youngest of four children, was born Béla Ferenc Dezső Blaskó in Lugos, Kingdom of Hungary (now Lugoj, Romania) to Hungarian father István Blaskó, a banker, and Serbian-born mother Paula de Vojnich. He later based his last name on his hometown. He and his sister Vilma were raised in a Roman Catholic family.\n\nAt the age of 12, Lugosi dropped out of school. He began his acting career in 1901 or 1902. His earliest known performances are from provincial theatres in the 1903–04 season, playing small roles in several plays and operettas. He went on to Shakespeare plays and other major roles. After moving to Budapest in 1911, he played dozens of roles with the National Theatre of Hungary between 1913–19. Although Lugosi would later claim that he \"became the leading actor of Hungary's Royal National Theatre\", almost all his roles there were small or supporting parts.\n\nDuring World War I, he served as an infantryman in the Austro-Hungarian Army from 1914–16, rising to the rank of Lieutenant. He was awarded the Wound Medal for wounds he suffered while serving on the Russian front.\n\nDue to his activism in the actors' union in Hungary during the revolution of 1919, he was forced to flee his homeland. He went first to Vienna before settling in Berlin (in the Langestrasse), where he continued acting. He took the name \"Lugosi\" in 1903 to honor his birthplace, and eventually travelled to New Orleans, Louisiana as a crewman aboard a merchant ship.\n\nLugosi's first film appearance was in the movie \"Az ezredes\" (\"The Colonel\", 1917). When appearing in Hungarian silent films, he used the stage name Arisztid Olt. Lugosi made 12 films in Hungary between 1917 and 1918 before leaving for Germany. Following the collapse of Béla Kun's Hungarian Soviet Republic in 1919, leftists and trade unionists became vulnerable. Lugosi was proscribed from acting due to his participation in the formation of an actors' union. In exile in Weimar Republic Germany, he began appearing in a small number of well-received films, among them adaptations of the Karl May novels \"Auf den Trümmern des Paradieses\" (\"On the Brink of Paradise\") and \"Die Todeskarawane\" (\"The Caravan of Death\"), opposite the Jewish actress Dora Gerson (who died in Auschwitz).\n\nLugosi left Germany in October 1920, intending to emigrate to the United States, and entered the country at New Orleans in December 1920. He made his way to New York and was inspected by immigration officers at Ellis Island in March 1921. He declared his intention to become a US citizen in 1928; on June 26, 1931, he was naturalized.\n\nOn his arrival in America, the , Lugosi worked for some time as a laborer, and then entered the theater in New York City's Hungarian immigrant colony. With fellow Hungarian actors he formed a small stock company that toured Eastern cities, playing for immigrant audiences. Lugosi acted in several Hungarian plays before breaking out into his first English Broadway play, \"The Red Poppy\", in 1922. Three more parts came in 1925–26, including a five-month run in the comedy-fantasy \"The Devil in the Cheese\".\n\nIn 1925, he appeared as an Arab Sheik in \"Arabesque\" which premiered in Buffalo, New York at the Teck Theatre before moving to Broadway. His first American film role came in the 1923 melodrama \"The Silent Command\". Several more silent roles followed, villains and continental types, all in productions made in the New York area.\n\nLugosi was approached in the summer of 1927 to star in a Broadway theatre production of \"Dracula\", which had been adapted by Hamilton Deane and John L. Balderston from Bram Stoker's 1897 novel. The Horace Liveright production was successful, running for 261 performances before touring the United States to much fanfare and critical acclaim throughout 1928 and 1929. In 1928, Lugosi decided to stay in California when the play ended its West Coast run. His performance had piqued the interest of Fox Film, and in 1929 he appeared in the studio's silent film \"The Veiled Woman\". He also appeared in the film \"Prisoners\" (considered lost), which was released in both silent and talkie versions.\n\nIn 1929, with no other film roles in sight, he returned to the stage as Dracula for a short West Coast tour of the play. Lugosi remained in California where he resumed his film work under contract with Fox, appearing in early talkies often as a heavy or an \"exotic sheik\". He also continued to lobby for his prized role in the film version of \"Dracula\".\n\nDespite his critically acclaimed performance on stage, Lugosi was not Universal Pictures' first choice for the role of Dracula when the company optioned the rights to the Deane play and began production in 1930. Different prominent actors were considered before Browning cast Lugosi for the role, but the film was a hit.\n\nThrough his association with \"Dracula\" (in which he appeared with minimal makeup, using his natural, heavily accented voice), Lugosi found himself typecast as a horror villain in films such as \"Murders in the Rue Morgue\", \"The Raven\", and \"Son of Frankenstein\" for Universal, and the independent \"White Zombie\". His accent, while a part of his image, limited the roles he could play.\n\nLugosi did attempt to break type by auditioning for other roles. He lost out to Lionel Barrymore for the role of Grigori Rasputin in \"Rasputin and the Empress\"; C. Henry Gordon for the role of Surat Khan in \"Charge of the Light Brigade\", and Basil Rathbone for the role of Commissar Dimitri Gorotchenko in \"Tovarich\" (a role Lugosi had played on stage). He played the elegant, somewhat hot-tempered General Nicholas Strenovsky-Petronovich in \"International House\".\n\nRegardless of controversy, five films at Universal — \"The Black Cat\", \"The Raven\", \"The Invisible Ray\", \"Son of Frankenstein\", \"Black Friday\" (plus minor cameo performances in 1934's \"Gift of Gab\") and two at RKO Pictures, \"You'll Find Out\" and \"The Body Snatcher\" — paired Lugosi with Boris Karloff. Despite the relative size of their roles, Lugosi inevitably got second billing, below Karloff. There are contradictory reports of Lugosi's attitude toward Karloff, some claiming that he was openly resentful of Karloff's long-term success and ability to get good roles beyond the horror arena, while others suggested the two actors were — for a time, at least — good friends. Karloff himself in interviews suggested that Lugosi was initially mistrustful of him when they acted together, believing that the Englishman would attempt to upstage him. When this proved not to be the case, according to Karloff, Lugosi settled down and they worked together amicably (though some have further commented that Karloff's on-set demand to break from filming for mid-afternoon tea annoyed Lugosi). Karloff also insinuated that his iconic rival could not act, claiming Lugosi had \"never learned his trade\". Universal did cast Lugosi in a couple of heroic parts, as in \"The Black Cat\" after Karloff had been accorded the more colorful role of the villain, \"The Invisible Ray\", and a romantic role in the adventure serial \"The Return of Chandu\", but his typecasting problem appears to have been too entrenched to be alleviated by those films. Of course, Karloff had a leg up on Lugosi simply by being a native English speaker; Lugosi had to learn English as a second language, and was never able to shed his heavy accent.\n\nLugosi addressed his plea to be cast in non-horror roles directly to casting directors through his listing in the 1937 \"Players Directory\", published by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, in which he (or his agent) calls the idea that he is only fit for horror films \"an error.\"\n\nA number of factors began to work against Lugosi's career in the mid-1930s. Universal changed management in 1936, and because of a British ban on horror films, dropped them from their production schedule; Lugosi found himself consigned to Universal's non-horror B-film unit, at times in small roles where he was obviously used for \"name value\" only. Throughout the 1930s, Lugosi, experiencing a severe career decline despite popularity with audiences (Universal executives always preferred his rival Karloff), accepted many leading roles from independent producers like Nat Levine, Sol Lesser, and Sam Katzman. These low-budget thrillers indicate that Lugosi was less discriminating than Karloff in selecting screen vehicles, but the exposure helped Lugosi financially if not artistically. Lugosi tried to keep busy with stage work, but had to borrow money from the Actors Fund of America to pay hospital bills when his only child, Bela George Lugosi, was born in 1938.\n\nHistorian John McElwee reports, in his 2013 book \"Showmen, Sell It Hot!\", that Bela Lugosi's popularity received a much-needed boost in August 1938, when California theater owner Emil Umann revived \"Dracula\" and \"Frankenstein\" as a special double feature. The combination was so successful that Umann scheduled extra shows to accommodate the capacity crowds, and invited Lugosi to appear in person, which thrilled new audiences that had never seen Lugosi's classic performance. \"I owe it all to that little man at the Regina Theatre,\" said Lugosi of exhibitor Umann. \"I was dead, and he brought me back to life.\" Universal took notice of the tremendous business and launched its own national re-release of the same two horror favorites. The studio then rehired Lugosi to star in new films.\n\nThe first was Universal's \"Son of Frankenstein\" (1939), when he played the character role of Ygor, a mad blacksmith with a broken neck, in heavy makeup and beard. The same year saw Lugosi making a rare appearance in an A-list motion picture: he was a stern commissar in Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer's comedy \"Ninotchka\", starring Greta Garbo and directed by Ernst Lubitsch. He was effective in this small but prestigious character role, and it could have been a turning point for the actor, but within the year, he was back on Hollywood's Poverty Row, playing leads for Sam Katzman. These horror, comedy and mystery B-films were released by Monogram Pictures. At Universal, he often received star billing for what amounted to a supporting part. \"The Gorilla\" (1939) had him playing straight man to Patsy Kelly.\nOstensibly due to injuries received during military service, Lugosi developed severe, chronic sciatica. Though at first he was treated with pain remedies such as asparagus juice, doctors increased the medication to opiates. The growth of his dependence on analgesic drugs, particularly morphine and, after 1947 when it became available in America, methadone, was directly proportional to the dwindling of screen offers. He was finally cast in the role of Frankenstein's monster for Universal's \"Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man\" (1943), but Lugosi had no dialogue. Lugosi's voice had been dubbed over that of Lon Chaney, Jr., from line readings at the end of \"The Ghost of Frankenstein\" (1942). Lugosi played Dracula for a second and last time on film in \"Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein\" (1948).\n\n\"Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein\" was Bela Lugosi's last \"A\" movie. For the remainder of his life he appeared — less and less frequently — in obscure, low-budget features. From 1947-50, he performed in summer stock, often in productions of \"Dracula\" or \"Arsenic and Old Lace\", and during the other parts of the year made personal appearances in a touring \"spook show\", and on early commercial television.\n\nIn September 1949 Milton Berle invited Lugosi to appear in a sketch on \"Texaco Star Theatre\". Lugosi memorized the script for the skit, but became confused on the air when Berle began to ad lib. His only television dramatic role was on the anthology series \"Suspense\" on October 11, 1949, in an adaptation of Edgar Allan Poe's \"The Cask of Amontillado\".\n\nIn 1951, while in England to play a six-month tour of \"Dracula\", Lugosi co-starred in a lowbrow film comedy, \"Mother Riley Meets the Vampire\" (also known as \"Vampire over London\" and \"My Son, the Vampire\"). Following his return to the United States, he was interviewed for television, and reflected wistfully on his typecasting in horror parts: \"Now I am the boogie man.\" In the same interview he expressed a desire to play more comedy, as he had in the Mother Riley farce. Independent producer Jack Broder took Lugosi at his word, casting him in a jungle-themed comedy, \"Bela Lugosi Meets a Brooklyn Gorilla\" co-starring nightclub comedians Duke Mitchell and Sammy Petrillo, whose act closely resembled that of Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis.\n\nWhile Lugosi enjoyed a lively career on stage with plenty of personal appearances, as film offers declined, he became more and more dependent on live venues to support his family. Bela took over the role of Jonathan Brewster from Boris Karloff for \"Arsenic and Old Lace\". Bela had also expressed interest in playing Elwood P. Dowd in \"Harvey\" to help himself professionally. He also made plenty of personal appearances to promote his horror image and/or an accompanying film.\n\nLate in his life, Bela Lugosi again received star billing in films when ambitious filmmaker Ed Wood, a fan of Lugosi, found him living in obscurity and near-poverty and offered him roles in his films, such as an anonymous narrator in \"Glen or Glenda\" and a Dr. Frankenstein-like mad scientist in \"Bride of the Monster\". During post-production of the latter, Lugosi decided to seek treatment for his drug addiction, and the premiere of the film was said to be intended to help pay for his hospital expenses. According to Kitty Kelley's biography of Frank Sinatra, when the entertainer heard of Lugosi's problems, he helped with expenses and visited Lugosi at the hospital. Sinatra would recall Lugosi's amazement at his visit, since the two men had never met before.\n\nDuring an impromptu interview upon his exit from the treatment center in 1955, Lugosi stated that he was about to go to work on a new Ed Wood film, \"The Ghoul Goes West\". This was one of several projects proposed by Wood, including \"The Phantom Ghoul\" and \"Dr. Acula\". With Lugosi in his famed Dracula cape, Wood shot impromptu test footage, with no storyline in mind, in front of Tor Johnson's home, a suburban graveyard, and in front of Lugosi's apartment building on Carlton Way. This footage ended up in \"Plan 9 from Outer Space\", which was mostly filmed after Lugosi's death. Wood hired Tom Mason, his wife's chiropractor, to double for Lugosi in additional shots. Mason was noticeably taller and thinner than Lugosi, and had the lower half of his face covered with his cape in every shot, as Lugosi sometimes did in \"Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein\".\n\nFollowing his treatment, Lugosi made one final film, in late 1955, \"The Black Sleep\", for Bel-Air Pictures, which was released in the summer of 1956 through United Artists with a promotional campaign that included several personal appearances. To Lugosi's disappointment, however, his role in this film was that of a mute, with no dialogue.\n\nIn 1917, Lugosi married Ilona Szmik. The couple divorced in 1920, reputedly over political differences with her parents. In 1921, he married Ilona von Montagh, and divorced in 1924. In 1929, Lugosi took his place in Hollywood society and scandal when he married wealthy San Francisco resident Beatrice Weeks, widow of architect Charles Peter Weeks. She filed for divorce four months later, citing actress Clara Bow as the \"other woman\".\n\nOn 26 June 1931, Lugosi became a naturalized United States citizen. In 1933, he married 19-year-old Lillian Arch, the daughter of Hungarian immigrants. They had a child, Bela G. Lugosi, in 1938. Bela had four grandchildren and six great-grandchildren.\n\nLillian and Bela, as well as his mother, vacationed on their lake property in Lake Elsinore, California (then called Elsinore), on two lots between 1944 and 1953. Bela Lugosi Jr. attended the Elsinore Naval & Military School in Lake Elsinore. Lillian and Béla divorced in 1953, at least partially because of Béla's jealousy over Lillian taking a full-time job as an assistant to Brian Donlevy on the sets and studios for Donlevy's radio and television series \"Dangerous Assignment\" – Lillian eventually did marry Brian Donlevy, in 1966. Lugosi married Hope Lininger, his fifth wife, in 1955; they remained married until his death. She had been a fan, writing letters to him when he was in the hospital, recovering from addiction to Demerol. She would sign her letters \"A dash of Hope\". She died in 1997 at age 77.\n\nLugosi died of a heart attack on August 16, 1956, while lying on a bed in his Los Angeles apartment. He was 73. The rumor that Lugosi was clutching the script for \"The Final Curtain\", a planned Ed Wood project, at the time of his death is not true.\n\nLugosi was buried wearing one of the \"Dracula\" cape costumes in the Holy Cross Cemetery in Culver City, California. Contrary to popular belief, Lugosi never requested to be buried in his cloak; Bela G. Lugosi confirmed on numerous occasions that he and his mother, Lillian, actually made the decision but believed that it is what his father would have wanted.\n\nIn 1979, the \"Lugosi v. Universal Pictures\" decision by the California Supreme Court held that Lugosi's personality rights could not pass to his heirs, as a copyright would have. The court ruled that under California law any rights of publicity, including the right to his image, terminated with Lugosi's death.\nIn Tim Burton's \"Ed Wood\", Lugosi is portrayed by Martin Landau, who received the 1994 Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for the performance. According to Bela G. Lugosi (his son), Forrest Ackerman, Dolores Fuller and Richard Sheffield, the film's portrayal of Lugosi is inaccurate: In real life, he never used profanity, owned small dogs, or slept in coffins. And contrary to this film, Bela did not struggle performing on \"The Red Skelton Show\".\n\nThree Lugosi projects were featured on the television show \"Mystery Science Theater 3000\". The 1942 film \"The Corpse Vanishes\" appeared in episode 105; the serial \"The Phantom Creeps\" appeared throughout season two, and the Ed Wood production \"Bride of the Monster\" in episode 423.\nAn episode of \"Sledge Hammer!\" titled \"Last of the Red Hot Vampires\" was an homage to Bela Lugosi; at the end of the episode, it was dedicated to \"Mr. Blasko\".\n\nIn 2001, BBC Radio 4 broadcast \"There Are Such Things\" by Steven McNicoll and Mark McDonnell.

He was played by one of Hungary's most renowned actors, Ivan Darvas.\n\nAndy Warhol's 1963 silkscreen \"The Kiss\" depicts Lugosi from \"Dracula\" about to bite into the neck of co-star Helen Chandler, who played Mina Harker. A copy sold for $798,000 at Christie's in May 2000.\n\nLugosi was also the subject of \"Bela Lugosi's Dead\", the first single by the English band Bauhaus. Released in August 1979, it is often considered to be the first gothic rock record.\n\nLugosi's star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame is mentioned in \"Celluloid Heroes\", a song performed by The Kinks and written by their lead vocalist and principal songwriter, Ray Davies. It appeared on their 1972 album \"Everybody's in Show-Biz\".\n\nA fan of the occult, Lugosi's haunted mirror is on display at Zak Bagans' haunted museum in Las Vegas, Nevada.\n\n\n"}

Cooperation in space ventures between the Soviet Union and the United States was initiated in 1971, with the signing of the United States and Soviet Union in Science and Applications Agreement (which included an agreement on space research cooperation). The Soviet Union first offered to fly US experiments on a Kosmos biosatellite in 1974, only a few years after the termination (in 1969) of the U.S. biosatellite program. The offer was realized in 1975 when the first joint U.S./Soviet research were carried out on the Kosmos 782 mission.\n\nThe Bion spacecraft were based on the Zenit (satellite) and launches began in 1973 with primary emphasis on the problems of radiation effects on human beings. Launches in the program included Kosmos 110, 605, 690, 782, plus Nauka modules flown on Zenit-2M reconnaissance satellites. 90 kg of equipment could be contained in the external Nauka module.\n\nThe Soviet/Russian Bion program provided U.S. investigators a platform for launching Fundamental Space Biology and biomedical experiments into space. The Bion program, which began in 1966, included a series of missions that flew biological experiments using primates, rodents, insects, cells, and plants on a biosatellite in near-earth orbit. NASA became involved in the program in 1975 and participated in 9 of the 11 Bion missions. NASA ended its participation in the program with the Bion 11 mission launched in December 1996. The collaboration resulted in the flight of more than 100 U.S. experiments, one-half of all U.S. Life Sciences flight experiments accomplished with non-human subjects.\n\nThe missions ranged from five days (Bion 6) to around 22 days (Bion 1 and Kosmos 110).\n\nIn 2005 the Bion program was resumed with three new satellites of the modified Bion-M type – the first flight was launched April 19, 2013 from Baikonur cosmodrome, Kazakhstan.\nThe first satellite of the new series Bion-M1 featured an aquarium by the German Aerospace Center (DLR) and carried 45 mice, 18 Mongolian gerbils, 15 geckos, snails, fish and micro-organisms into orbit for 30 days before re-entry and recovery. All the gerbils died due to a hardware failure, but condition of the rest of the experiments, including all geckos, was satisfactory. Half the mice died as was predicted.\n\n"}

{"id": "12968191", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12968191", "title": "Breastfeeding difficulties", "text": "Breastfeeding difficulties\n\nBreastfeeding difficulties refers to problems that arise from breastfeeding, the feeding of an infant or young child with milk from a woman's breasts. Although babies have a sucking reflex that enables them to suck and swallow milk, and although human breast milk is usually the best source of nourishment for human infants, there are circumstances under which breastfeeding can be problematic, or even, in rare instances, contraindicated.\n\nDifficulties can arise both in connection with the act of breastfeeding and with the health of the nursing infant.\n\nWhile breastfeeding difficulties are not uncommon, putting the baby to the breast as soon as possible after birth helps to avoid many problems. The policy of the American Academy of Pediatrics on breastfeeding says, \"delay weighing, measuring, bathing, needle-sticks, and eye prophylaxis until after the first feeding is completed.\" Many breastfeeding difficulties can be resolved with proper hospital procedures, properly trained nurses and hospital staff, speech pathologists and lactation consultants. Another source of information is the volunteer-based breastfeeding promotion organization, La Leche League.\n\nA variety of factors and conditions can interfere with successful breastfeeding:\n\n\n\nPain often interferes with successful breastfeeding. It is cited as the second most common cause for the abandonment of exclusive breastfeeding after perceived low milk supply.\n\nInverted or retracted nipples sometimes make attachment to the breast difficult. These mothers need additional support to feed their babies. Treatment is started after the birth of the baby. The nipple is manually stretched out several times a day. A pump or a plastic syringe is used to draw out the nipple and the baby is then put to the breast.\n\n\"Breast engorgement\" is the sense of breast fullness experienced by most women within 36 hours of delivery. Normally, this is a painless sensation of \"heaviness\". Breastfeeding on demand is the primary way of preventing painful engorgement.\n\nWhen the breast overfills with milk it becomes painful. Engorgement comes from not getting enough milk from the breast. It happens about 3 to 7 days after delivery and occurs more often in first time mothers. The increased blood supply, the accumulated milk and the swelling all contribute to the painful engorgement. Engorgement may affect the areola, the periphery of the breast or the entire breast, and may interfere with breastfeeding both from the pain and also from the distortion of the normal shape of the areola/nipple. This makes it harder for the baby to latch on properly for feeding. Latching may occur over only part of the areola. This can irritate the nipple more, and may lead to ineffective drainage of breast milk and more pain. Engorgement may begin as a result of several factors such as nipple pain, improper feeding technique, infrequent feeding or infant-mother separation.\n\nTo prevent or treat engorgement, remove the milk from the breast, by breastfeeding, expressing or pumping. Gentle massage can help start the milk flow and so reduce the pressure. The reduced pressure softens the areola, perhaps even allowing the infant to feed. Warm water or warm compresses and expressing some milk before feeding can also help make breastfeeding more effective. Some researchers have suggested that after breastfeeding, mothers should pump and/or apply cold compresses to reduce swelling pain and vascularity even more. One published study suggested the use of \"chilled cabbage leaves\" applied to the breasts. Attempts to reproduce this technique met with mixed results. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or paracetamol (acetominophen) may relieve the pain.\n\nSore nipples (nipple pain, or thelalgia) are probably the most common complaint after the birth. They are generally reported by the second day after delivery but improve within 5 days. Pain beyond the first week, severe pain, cracking, fissures or localized swelling is not normal. The mother should see a doctor for further evaluation. Sore nipples, a common cause of pain, often come from the baby not latching on properly. Factors include too much pressure on the nipple when not enough of the areola is latched onto and an improper release of suction at the end of the feeding. Improper use of breast pumps or topical remedies can also contribute. Nipple pain can also be a sign of infection. When the baby bites the nipple it can also be painful.\n\nSymptoms of candidiasis of the breast include pain, itching, burning and redness, or a shiny or white patchy appearance. The baby could have a white tongue that does not wipe clean. Candidiasis is common and may be associated with infant thrush.\n\nBoth mother and baby must be treated to get rid of this infection. First-line therapies include nystatin, ketaconazole or miconazole applied to the nipple and given by mouth to the baby. Strict cleaning of clothing and breast pumps is also required to eradicate the infection.\n\nAnother non-prescription treatment of candidia is gentian violet. It usually works, and relief is rapid. It is messy, and will stain clothing. The baby's lips will turn purple, but the purple will disappear after a few days.\n\nMilk stasis is when a milk duct is blocked and cannot drain properly. This may affect only a part of the breast and is not associated with any infection. It can be treated by varying the baby's feeding position and applying heat before feeding. If it happens more than once, further evaluation is needed.\n\nMastitis is an inflammation of the breast. It causes local pain (\"dolor\"), redness (\"rubor\"), swelling (\"tumor\"), and warmth (\"calor\"). Later stages of mastitis cause symptoms of systemic infection like fever and nausea. It mostly occurs 2–3 weeks after delivery but can happen at any time. Typically results from milk stasis with primary or secondary local, later systemic infection. Infectious organisms include \"Staphylococcus sp.\", \"Streptococcus sp.\" and \"E. coli\". Continued breastfeeding, plenty of rest and adequate fluid supply is the best treatment for light cases.\n\nOveractive let-down (OALD) is the forceful ejection of milk from the breast during breastfeeding. The forceful spray of milk can cause the baby to consume too much milk too quickly as well as to swallow air during the period of rapid swallowing following the let-down.\n\nVery rarely, nipple pain can be caused by vasospasm of the nipple. In essence, blood does not flow properly to the nipple which causes the nipple to blanch. This can be caused by trauma to the nipple through early breastfeeding or candidal infection of the nipple. The pain is intense during the latch stage and in between breastfeeding sessions there is a throbbing pain when the nipple is blanched. The nipple can be massaged to help blood flow return to reduce pain, as well as avoiding cold. In some instances, heart medication, nifedipine, is used to help the blood flow return to the nipple.\n\nInfants with classic galactosemia cannot digest lactose and therefore cannot benefit from breast milk. Breastfeeding might harm the baby also if the mother has untreated pulmonary tuberculosis, is taking certain medications that suppress the immune system. has HIV, or uses potentially harmful substances such as cocaine, heroin, and amphetamines. Other than cases of acute poisoning, no environmental contaminant has been found to cause more harm to infants than lack of breastfeeding. Although heavy metals such as mercury are dispersed throughout the environment and are of concern to the nursing infant, the neurodevelopmental benefits of human milk tend to override the potential adverse effects of neurotoxicants.\n\nArtificial teats (nipples) or dummies (pacifiers) can suppress the sucking reflex in infants. In addition, when a baby is put to the breast for shorter periods of time, milk production decreases. The time spent sucking by the infant on the pacifier or artificial teat reduces the time on the breast.\n\nIt is not safe for mothers with active, untreated tuberculosis to breastfeed until they are no longer contagious. According to the American Academy of Pediatrics 2006 Redbook: \n\nIn areas where BCG vaccination is the standard of care, the WHO provides treatment recommendations and advises mothers to continue breastfeeding. TBC may be congenital, or perinatally acquired through airborne droplet spread.\n\nResearch published in the Lancet has highlighted a lower risk of HIV transmission with exclusive breastfeeding by HIV positive mothers (4% risk), compared to mixed feeding (10-40% risk). Research on the timing of HIV transmission in 2000 revealed that a \"substantial transmission occurs early during breastfeeding,\" concluding that 75% of all breast milk transmission had occurred within the first 6 months during a randomized control trial in Kenya. This research is of particular importance in developing countries where infant formula is not widely available or safe to prepare. In fact, the World Health Organization recommended breastfeeding in 1987 and 1992 for seropositive and seronegative women in areas where malnutrition and infectious diseases are the major cause of infant mortality. In 1996 UNAIDS issued a recommendation that women in developing countries consider the risks and benefits of each feeding practice on an individual level; they recommended women make an informed choice about infant feeding. In the days before the AIDS epidemic was clearly understood, some researchers pointed to the need to increase breastfeeding rates and pointed to the risks of formula feeding, citing increased rates of marasmus and diarrhea. D Jelliffe and E Jelliffe also criticized the marketing of infant formulas by US companies to resource-poor countries, something they termed \"comerciogenic malnutrition.\" A more recent article from 1992 describes how the health of an infant can be compromised by water, which in many resource-poor countries holds the risk of environmental pathogens that are not present in breastmilk.\n\nThe vast majority of over the counter and prescription medicines are compatible with breastfeeding, but there are some that might be passed onto the child through the milk.\n\nIf one does continue tobacco smoking after giving birth, however, it is still more beneficial to breastfeed than to completely avoid this practice altogether. There is evidence that breastfeeding offers protection against many infectious diseases, especially diarrhea. Even in babies exposed to the harmful effects of nicotine through breast milk, the likelihood of acute respiratory illness is significantly diminished when compared to infants whose mothers smoked but were formula fed. Regardless, the benefits of breastfeeding outweigh the risks of nicotine exposure.\n\nThe main concern about smoking and breastfeeding is that infants may have smoking-induced reductions to the milk iodine content. Smoking can adversely affect the lactation process by decreasing milk production and altering the milk composition. Smoking reduces daily milk output by roughly 250–300 mL. Not only will this be problematic on a daily basis for not producing enough milk, it will also cause the mother to wean her baby early. The altered milk composition also caused infants to exhibit daily behaviors such as colic and crying which can promote early weaning, again something that is not beneficial to the infant.\n\nAlso, the nicotine obtained from smoking travels through a woman into her breast milk, thus giving nicotine to her child.\n\nHeavy use of cigarettes by the mother (more than 20 per day) has been shown to reduce the mother's milk supply and cause vomiting, diarrhoea, rapid heart rate, and restlessness in breastfed infants. Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) is more common in babies exposed to a smoky environment. Breastfeeding mothers who smoke are counseled not to do so during or immediately before feeding their child, and are encouraged to seek advice to help them reduce their nicotine intake or quit.\n\nWith respect to alcohol, the American Academy of Pediatrics states that when breastfeeding, \"moderation is definitely advised\" and recommends waiting for 2 hours after drinking before nursing or pumping. A 2014 review found that \"even in a theoretical case of binge drinking, the children would not be subjected to clinically relevant amounts of alcohol [through breastmilk]\", and would have no adverse effects on children as long as drinking is \"occasional\".\n\nIf the mother consumes too much caffeine, it can cause irritability, sleeplessness, nervousness and increased feeding in the breastfed infant. Moderate use (one to two cups per day of coffee, tea, or cola) usually produces no effect. Breastfeeding mothers are advised to restrict or avoid caffeine if her baby reacts negatively to it.\nCigarette smoking is thought to increase the effects of caffeine in the baby.\n\nCannabis is listed by the American Association of Pediatrics as a compound that transfers into human breast milk. Research demonstrated that certain compounds in marijuana have a very long half-life.\n\nAn exclusively breastfed baby depends on breast milk completely so it is important for the mother to maintain a healthy lifestyle, and especially a good diet. Consumption of 1500–1800 calories per day could coincide with a weight loss of 450 grams (one pound) per week. While mothers in famine conditions can produce milk with highly nutritional content, a malnourished mother may produce milk with decreased levels of several micronutrients such as iron, zinc, and vitamin B. She may also have a lower supply than well-fed mothers.\n\nThere are no foods that are absolutely contraindicated during breastfeeding, but a baby may show sensitivity to particular foods that the mother eats.\n\nMany mothers have to return to work a short time after their babies have been born. If their employers and fellow employees do not support mothers in breastfeeding (for example, providing a private breastfeeding room containing a fridge where mothers can express and safely store breastmilk), mothers might stop breastfeeding. This is not ideal for their infants. A Cochrane review assessed the effects of workplace interventions to support and promote breastfeeding among mothers returning to work after the birth of their babies. The review authors comprehensively searched in 2012 for studies addressing this question but found no eligible studies.\n\n"}

Chucky is portrayed as a notorious serial killer whose spirit inhabits a \"Good Guy\" doll and continuously tries to transfer his soul from the doll to a human body. The character has become one of the most recognizable horror icons, often mentioned alongside Freddy Krueger, Jason Voorhees, Ghostface, Leatherface, Pennywise, Pinhead and Michael Myers, and has been referenced numerous times in popular culture. In 1999, the Chucky character was nominated for the MTV Movie Award for Best Villain for the film \"Bride of Chucky\". He was created by writer-director Don Mancini and is portrayed and voiced by Brad Dourif in both live-action and voice-over.\n\nChucky made his first appearance in the 1988 film \"Child's Play\". In the film, serial killer Charles Lee Ray (Brad Dourif) uses a voodoo ritual to transfer his soul into a Good Guy doll in an effort to escape capture. Now living in the form of the animated doll, Chucky (voiced by Dourif) is given to young Andy Barclay (Alex Vincent) and begins terrorizing the family.\nChucky made his second appearance in the 1990 sequel, \"Child's Play 2\". In the film, a resurrected Chucky continues his pursuit of Andy, who has been placed in foster care after the events of the first film.\nIn \"Child's Play 3\" (1991), Chucky again returns from the grave eight years after events of the previous film to terrorize a now teenage Andy (Justin Whalin).\n\n\"Bride of Chucky\" (1998) continues the story, with Chucky being resurrected by former accomplice and girlfriend Tiffany Valentine (Jennifer Tilly). After transferring Tiffany's soul into a bride doll, the two terrorize a young couple in an attempt to transfer their souls into human bodies. \"Seed of Chucky\" (2004) follows six years later when Glen/Glenda (Voiced by Billy Boyd), the child of Chucky and Tiffany, brings his parents back to life. The trio then set their sights on actress Jennifer Tilly (Tilly in a fictionalized version of herself), for whom they have sinister designs.\n\nThe 2013 film \"Curse of Chucky\" saw the series return to the straightforward horror elements found in the first three films. The film takes place twenty-five years after the events of the first film, as Chucky torments wheelchair user Nica Pierce (Fiona Dourif) who is implied to be his daughter.\nIn \"Cult of Chucky\" (2017) Chucky returns to torment a now institutionalized Nica, while a now adult Andy (Vincent) attempts to stop Chucky once and for all.\n\n\"Child's Play\" creator and co-writer Don Mancini explained that Chucky draws heavily from the My Buddy dolls: \"In my original script, he was originally called Buddy, and we couldn't use it because of the 'My Buddy' doll. The director went out and got a 'My Buddy' doll, a Raggedy Ann, a Raggedy Andy and one of those life-size baby infants. What I told [designer] Kevin Yagher was, I wanted something similar to a My Buddy doll. I described \"Buddy\" in my original script, now \"Chucky\", as wearing red-buttoned overalls, red sneakers, striped sweater, with red hair, blue eyes, and freckles. Kevin went off and sketched many designs of Chucky, until the final was picked. Yagher then built the first doll from those sketches and my details\".\n\n"}
{"id": "6512", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6512", "title": "Coercion", "text": "Coercion\n\nCoercion () is the practice of forcing another party to act in an involuntary manner by use of threats or force. It involves a set of various types of forceful actions that violate the free will of an individual to induce a desired response, for example: a bully demanding lunch money from a student or the student gets beaten. These actions may include extortion, blackmail, torture, threats to induce favors, or even sexual assault. In law, coercion is codified as a duress crime. Such actions are used as leverage, to force the victim to act in a way contrary to their own interests. Coercion may involve the actual infliction of physical pain/injury or psychological harm in order to enhance the credibility of a threat. The threat of further harm may lead to the cooperation or obedience of the person being coerced.\n\nThe purpose of coercion is to substitute one's aims to those of the victim. For this reason, many social philosophers have considered coercion as the polar opposite to freedom.\n\nVarious forms of coercion are distinguished: first on the basis of the \"kind of injury\" threatened, second according to its \"aims\" and \"scope\", and finally according to its \"effects\", from which its legal, social, and ethical implications mostly depend.\n\nPhysical coercion is the most commonly considered form of coercion, where the content of the conditional threat is the use of force against a victim, their relatives or property. An often used example is \"putting a gun to someone's head\" (\"at gunpoint\") or putting a \"knife under the throat\" (\"at knifepoint\" or cut-throat) to compel action or the victim gets killed or injured. These are so common that they are also used as metaphors for other forms of coercion.\n\nArmed forces in many countries use firing squads to maintain discipline and intimidate the masses, or opposition, into submission or silent compliance. However, there also are nonphysical forms of coercion, where the threatened injury does not immediately imply the use of force. Byman and Waxman (2000) define coercion as \"the use of threatened force, including the limited use of actual force to back up the threat, to induce an adversary to behave differently than it otherwise would.\" Coercion does not in many cases amount to destruction of property or life since compliance is the goal.\n\nIn psychological coercion, the threatened injury regards the victim's relationships with other people. The most obvious example is \"blackmail\", where the threat consists of the dissemination of damaging information. However, many other types are possible e.g. \"emotional blackmail\", which typically involves threats of rejection from or disapproval by a peer-group, or creating feelings of guilt/obligation via a display of anger or hurt by someone whom the victim loves or respects. Another example is coercive persuasion.\n\nPsychological coercion – along with the other varieties – was extensively and systematically used by the government of the People's Republic of China during the \"Thought Reform\" campaign of 1951–1952. The process – carried out partly at \"revolutionary universities\" and partly within prisons – was investigated and reported upon by Robert Jay Lifton, then Research Professor of Psychiatry at Yale University: see Lifton (1961). The techniques used by the Chinese authorities included a technique derived from standard group psychotherapy, which was aimed at forcing the victims (who were generally intellectuals) to produce detailed and sincere ideological \"confessions\". For instance, a professor of formal logic called Chin Yueh-lin – who was then regarded as China's leading authority on his subject – was induced to write: \"The new philosophy [of Marxism-Leninism], being scientific, is the supreme truth\" [Lifton (1961) p. 545].\n\n\n"}

She was joining her husband Jack Agazarian and the Prosper as a courier. It was deemed unusual a married couple working on the same network; after the war Francine clarified the situation:\nAlthough in the same network, my husband and I were not working together; as a radio operator he worked alone and transmitted from different locations every day. I was only responsible to Prosper (Francis Suttill) whom we all called Francois . He liked to use me for special errands because, France being my native land, I could get away from difficulties easily enough, particularly when dealing with officialdom.\n\nFrancois was an outstanding leader, clear-headed, precise, confident. I liked working on his instructions, and I enjoyed the small challenges he was placing in front of me. For instance calling at town halls in various districts of Paris to exchange the network's expired ration cards (manufactured in London) for genuine new ones. Mainly I was delivering his messages to his helpers: in Paris, in villages, or isolated houses in the countryside. From time to time I was also delivering demolition material received from England. And once, with hand-grenades in my shopping bag, I travelled in a train so full that I had to stand against a German NCO. This odd situation was not new to me. I had already experienced it for the first time on the day of my arrival on French soil, when I had to travel by train from Poitiers to Paris. A very full train also. I sat on my small suitcase in the corridor, a uniformed German standing close against me. But, that first time, tied to my waist, under my clothes, was a wide black cloth belt containing bank-notes for Prosper, a number of blank identity cards and a number of ration cards; while tucked into the sleeves of my coat were crystals for Prosper's radio transmitters; the crystals had been skilfully secured to my sleeves by Vera Atkins herself, before my departure from Orchard Court. My .32 revolver and ammunition were in my suitcase. The ludicrousness of the situation somehow eliminated any thoughts of danger.\n\nIn any case, I believe none of us in the field ever gave one thought to danger. Germans were everywhere, especially in Paris; one absorbed the sight of them and went on with the job of living as ordinarily as possible and applying oneself to one's work.\n\nBecause I worked alone, the times I liked best were when we could be together, Prosper (Francis Suttill), Denise (Andrée Borrel), Archambaud (Gilbert Norman), Marcel (Jack Agazarian) and I, sitting round a table, while I was decoding radio messages from London; we were always hoping to read the exciting warning to stand by, which would have meant that the liberating invasion from England was imminent.\nAs the network appeared to be close to being broken by the Germans, Francine and Jack returned to England by Lysander on 16 June 1943; arriving on that flight were Diana Rowden, Cecily Lefort and Noor Inayat Khan. Of the five, only Francine would survive the war. Jack returned to France, but was arrested on 30 July 1943 after falling for a German trap. He was tortured by the Gestapo for six months at Fresnes Prison and eventually sent to the Flossenbürg concentration camp where he was kept in solitary confinement and executed on 29 March 1945.\n\nAfter the war Francine Agazarian settled in London.\n\nFrancine Agazarian was Mentioned in Dispatches for her actions in France; her husband was also Mentioned in Dispatches and was posthumously awarded the Légion d'honneur and Croix de Guerre.\n"}

The character is the leader of Alpha Flight.\n\nGuardian was a fan character, created by John Byrne years before he did any professional work in comics.\n\nHe was originally called \"the Canadian Shield\", after the rock formation, but when Byrne introduced the character in \"X-Men\" this name was rejected by publisher Marvel Comics because of their fictional organization S.H.I.E.L.D. Byrne then suggested \"Guardian\", but this was also rejected due to the numerous extant Marvel characters under that name, so \"X-Men\" scripter Chris Claremont came up with Weapon Alpha and later Vindicator. These names were used for the character's initial appearances in \"X-Men\" #109, 120-121, and 139-140. Byrne disliked both these names, and when he was assigned the writing and penciling of the newly launched \"Alpha Flight\" comic, he quickly had \"Vindicator\" change names to his earlier suggestion, \"Guardian.\" \n\nJames MacDonald Hudson was born in London, Ontario, Canada. He is a leading petrochemical engineer and scientist for the Am-Can Corporation developing a powered exoskeleton suit. When he learns that his work will be used for American military purposes, Hudson raids his workplace, steals the prototype suit and destroys the plans. He leaves the suit to be recovered (albeit without the vital control helmet, which he built before coming to the company) and fully expects to be sued and arrested for his actions.\n\nHowever, Hudson's girlfriend, Heather MacNeil, uses political connections in the Canadian government to persuade Am-Can to waive the charges against him. As a result, Department H is formed, a secret branch of the Canadian Department of National Defence, and Hudson is named as head of operations. Inspired by the debut of the Fantastic Four, James Hudson planned to create a superhero team for Canada. He started out with a prototype superhero team called The Flight which had Wolverine as one of its members.\n\nFollowing his prototype team the Flight, Hudson forms Alpha Flight as a superhero team for the Canadian government and develops his exoskeleton into a battle suit. As Weapon Alpha, Hudson sought to capture Wolverine, who had left Canada and joined the X-Men. He accidentally injured Moira MacTaggert in the process. He then led Alpha Flight in battle against the X-Men to capture Wolverine. After that mission failed, he made no further attempts to forcibly return Wolverine to Canada.\n\nWith the cancellation of Department H and its funding, Alpha Flight is temporarily disbanded. Hudson laments this for a time, but then is called to action by the arrival of the Great Beast Tundra. He sets out alone, but Heather takes it upon herself to summon the rest of Alpha Flight, plus two recently \"gold-striped\" members. The team defeats Tundra, and then summarily decides to reform, albeit without direct Government support.\n\nHudson and Alpha Flight retain their security clearances and status as RCMP Auxiliaries. They have a series of adventures, both as a team and as individuals. Early on, Hudson expresses a lack of confidence in himself, but he slowly gains some over time. For example, his initial reaction to the imposing creature the Wendigo has him expressing fear. Nevertheless, he confronts the creature \"like a super-hero borne\".\n\nThough Hudson and his wife initially struggle as any Canadian middle-class couple do, he is soon offered a plum job with the large corporation Roxxon in New York City. Relocated to New York, Hudson is almost immediately trapped and set upon by an evil incarnation of Omega Flight and an old foe: his old boss from Am-Can, Jerry Jaxon. The battle is soon joined by the rest of Alpha Flight, though it does not end well for Hudson. Although seemingly killed when his battle suit explodes due to the strain of energizing a multiple teleportation matrix system (thanks to Jaxon), he is in fact transported to Jupiter's moon, Ganymede. There he meets an alien race known as the Q`wrrlln. In their attempts to heal Hudson, the Q`wrrlln integrate his battle suit into his body, fusing it to his biological and nervous systems. (This is originally posed as a ruse by Delphine Courtney to confuse and deceive Heather Hudson and the surviving members of Alpha Flight.)\n\nHudson eventually returns to Earth and takes the name Vindicator, leaving the title of \"Guardian\" (and position of leadership) with his wife, Heather. Again, Hudson's time with the team is cut short when the Q'wrrlln summon him (and a select group of heroes) to protect their planet against Galactus. As before, Hudson seemingly perishes when his suit detonates while transporting the heroes back home. However, during the explosion Hudson is transported to an alternate dimension. After some time, he eventually returns to Earth.\n\nWhile again working for Department H, Hudson becomes caught up in the plans of its new director, General Jeremy Clarke. Scientists working for Clarke clone Hudson, steal his memories, and attempt to shoot his body into outer space. The plan does not succeed, though, as Hudson crash lands in Antarctica.\n\nA seemingly de-aged Hudson reappears to the members of Alpha Flight. This is in fact the clone created by Department H. The original Hudson is eventually found by Sasquatch in Antarctica. After his return he once again becomes team leader while the clone becomes leader of Beta Flight. Later, both Hudsons are captured by AIM, and the clone is killed in the escape.\n\nAlong with several other members of Alpha Flight, Hudson attempts to return a clutch of Plodex eggs to their homeworld. However, an accident brings temporal copies of most of the original Alpha Flight from a time before Hudson's first \"death\" to the present. This group, including James Hudson, takes up the role of Alpha Flight while the original ones are helping to rebuild the Plodex homeworld.\n\nAlpha Flight (Sasquatch, Major Mapleleaf II, Puck Jr., Guardian, Vindicator, Shaman, and Puck) is brutally attacked by The Collective, resulting in the deaths of Guardian, Vindicator, Shaman, and Puck. Their bodies are left in the Yukon Territory as the Collective continues on to the United States.\n\nThe Guardian suit was worn by Michael Pointer during his run in Omega Flight before joining Norman Osborn's Dark X-Men as Weapon Omega.\n\nDuring the \"Chaos War\" storyline, Guardian (alongside Vindicator, Shaman, and Marrina Smallwood) are among the heroes that return from the dead following what happened to the death realms. He reunites Alpha Flight to fight the Great Beasts. James Hudson remains among the living after the defeat of the Chaos King.\n\nFormerly, Guardian used a skin-tight technological \"battle suit\" composed of steel mesh which served as an exoskeleton; it allowed him to fly, fire energy blasts and had a personal force field for defense. The suit design stems from a geological/oil-exploration exo-suit designed by Hudson during his early career. The original suit was clunky, over-large and awkward, though it did have an energy beam \"weapon\" system, ostensibly used for drilling/tunneling. The skin-tight suit is considered to be a later, possibly 2nd or 3rd generation, evolution of the original design. The battle suit is cybernetically controlled and contains a high resolution navigation system. The battle suit permits flight by directing beams of force towards the ground, propelling the wearer forward at up to Mach 1.\n\nGuardian could cause the battle suit computers to trigger and release gravitons, canceling the Earth's rotation relative to himself, propelling himself forward at up to about 1000 miles per hour (at the equator). This effect would suspend his positioning relative to the Earth's electromagnetic field while the planet rotated, allowing him to travel West at high speed depending on his latitude positioning.\n\nWhen he returned from space, the technology of the suit that formerly existed as a separate part of him was incorporated into his body. The alien Q`wrrlln converted James Hudson into a cyborg incorporating much of his battle suit; some of his mechanical parts were visible on the surface of his body. As a result, his powers were greatly enhanced. Hudson's cyborg brain was half-organic (portions of his original brain) and half-mechanical. Hudson could control his mechanical systems by mental command, though he was vulnerable to being controlled by the Q`wrrlln through the mechanical portion of his brain. With great effort the human portion of his brain could override this control.\n\nGuardian's power suit allows for:\n\nHudson has earned a Ph.D. in engineering. He is a brilliant engineer, inventor, and a good battle strategist and leader.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The Act lays down a uniform and comprehensive system of inheritance and succession into one Act. The Hindu woman's limited estate is abolished by the Act. Any property possessed by a Hindu female is to be held by her absolute property and she is given full power to deal with it and dispose it of by will as she likes. Parts of this Act was amended in 2005 by the Hindu Succession (Amendment) Act, 2005.\n\nThis Act is applicable to the following:\n\n\nExplanation as to who shall be considered as Hindus, Buddhists, Jains or Sikhs by religion has been provided in the section:\n\nA person shall be treated as a Hindu under the Act though he may not be a Hindu by religion but is, nevertheless, a person to whom this Act applies by virtue of the provisions contained in this section.\n\nHowever it has been provided that not withstanding the religion of any person as mentioned above, the Act shall not apply to the members of any Scheduled Tribe within the meaning of clause (25) of article 366 of the Constitution of India unless the Central Government, by notification in the \"Official Gazette\", otherwise directs.\nSurajmani Stella Kujur Vs. Durga Charan Hansdah-SC\n\nThe property of a Hindu male dying intestate, or without a will, would be given first to heirs within Class I. If there are no heirs categorized as Class I, the property will be given to heirs within Class II. If there are no heirs in Class II, the property will be given to the deceased's agnates or relatives through male lineage. If there are no agnates or relatives through the male’s lineage, then the property is given to the cognates, or any relative through the lineage of males or females.\n\nThere are two classes of heirs that are delineated by the Act.\n\nClass I heirs are sons, daughters, widows, mothers, sons of a pre-deceased son, widows of a pre-deceased son, son of a, pre-deceased sons of a predeceased son, and widows of a pre-deceased son of a predeceased son.\n\nIf there is more than one widow, multiple surviving sons or multiples of any of the other heirs listed above, each shall be granted one share of the deceased’s property. Also if the widow of a pre-deceased son, the widow of a pre-deceased son of a pre-deceased son or the widow of a brother has remarried, she is not entitled to receive the inheritance.\n\nClass II heirs are categorized as follows and are given the property of the deceased in the following order:\n\nUnder the Hindu Succession Act, 1956, females are granted ownership of all property acquired either before or after the signing of the Act, abolishing their \"limited owner\" status. However, it was not until the 2005 Amendment that daughters were allowed equal receipt of property as with sons. This invariably grants females property rights.\n\nThe property of a Hindu female dying intestate, or without a will, shall devolve in the following order:\n\nAny person who commits murder is disqualified from receiving any form of inheritance from the victim.\n\nIf a relative converts from Hinduism, he or she is still eligible for inheritance. The descendants of that converted relative, however, are disqualified from receiving inheritance from their Hindu relatives, unless they have converted back to Hinduism before the death of the relative.\n\nThe Hindu Succession (Amendment) Act, 2005, amended Section 4, Section 6, Section 23, Section 24 and Section 30 of the Hindu Succession Act, 1956. It revised rules on coparcenary property, giving daughters of the deceased equal rights with sons, and subjecting them to the same liabilities and disabilities.

{"id": "347560", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=347560", "title": "Inheritance (genetic algorithm)", "text": "Inheritance (genetic algorithm)\n\nIn genetic algorithms, inheritance is the ability of modeled objects to mate, mutate (similar to biological mutation), and propagate their problem solving genes to the next generation, in order to produce an evolved solution to a particular problem. The selection of objects that will be inherited from in each successive generation is determined by a fitness function, which varies depending upon the problem being addressed.\n\nThe traits of these objects are passed on through chromosomes by a means similar to biological reproduction. These chromosomes are generally represented by a series of genes, which in turn are usually represented using binary numbers. This propagation of traits between generations is similar to the inheritance of traits between generations of biological organisms. This process can also be viewed as a form of reinforcement learning, because the evolution of the objects is driven by the passing of traits from successful objects which can be viewed as a reward for their success, thereby promoting beneficial traits.\n\nOnce a new generation is ready to be created, all of the individuals that have been successful and have been chosen for reproduction are randomly paired together. Then the traits of these individuals are passed on through a combination of crossover and mutation. This process follows these basic steps:\n\n\nAfter following these steps, two child objects will be produced for every pair of parent objects used. Then, after determining the success of the objects in the new generation, this process can be repeated using whichever new objects were most successful. This will usually be repeated until either a desired generation is reached or an object that meets a minimum desired result from the fitness function is found.\n\nWhile crossover and mutation are the common genetic operators used in inheritance, there are also other operators such as regrouping and colonization-extinction.\n\nAssume these two strings of bits represent the traits being passed on by two parent objects:\n\n\nNow, consider that the crossover point is randomly positioned after the fifth bit:\n\n\nDuring crossover, the two objects will swap all of the bits after the crossover point, leading to:\n\n\nFinally, mutation is simulated on the objects by there being zero or more bits flipped randomly.

{"id": "19637", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19637", "title": "Molecular nanotechnology", "text": "Molecular nanotechnology\n\nMolecular nanotechnology (MNT) is a technology based on the ability to build structures to complex, atomic specifications by means of mechanosynthesis. This is distinct from nanoscale materials. Based on Richard Feynman's vision of miniature factories using nanomachines to build complex products (including additional nanomachines), this advanced form of nanotechnology (or \"molecular manufacturing\") would make use of positionally-controlled mechanosynthesis guided by molecular machine systems. MNT would involve combining physical principles demonstrated by biophysics, chemistry, other nanotechnologies, and the molecular machinery of life with the systems engineering principles found in modern macroscale factories.\n\nWhile conventional chemistry uses inexact processes obtaining inexact results, and biology exploits inexact processes to obtain definitive results, molecular nanotechnology would employ original definitive processes to obtain definitive results. The desire in molecular nanotechnology would be to balance molecular reactions in positionally-controlled locations and orientations to obtain desired chemical reactions, and then to build systems by further assembling the products of these reactions.\n\nA roadmap for the development of MNT is an objective of a broadly based technology project led by Battelle (the manager of several U.S. National Laboratories) and the Foresight Institute. The roadmap was originally scheduled for completion by late 2006, but was released in January 2008. The Nanofactory Collaboration is a more focused ongoing effort involving 23 researchers from 10 organizations and 4 countries that is developing a practical research agenda specifically aimed at positionally-controlled diamond mechanosynthesis and diamondoid nanofactory development. In August 2005, a task force consisting of 50+ international experts from various fields was organized by the Center for Responsible Nanotechnology to study the societal implications of molecular nanotechnology.\n\nOne proposed application of MNT is so-called smart materials. This term refers to any sort of material designed and engineered at the nanometer scale for a specific task. It encompasses a wide variety of possible commercial applications. One example would be materials designed to respond differently to various molecules; such a capability could lead, for example, to artificial drugs which would recognize and render inert specific viruses. Another is the idea of self-healing structures, which would repair small tears in a surface naturally in the same way as self-sealing tires or human skin.\n\nA MNT nanosensor would resemble a smart material, involving a small component within a larger machine that would react to its environment and change in some fundamental, intentional way. A very simple example: a photosensor might passively measure the incident light and discharge its absorbed energy as electricity when the light passes above or below a specified threshold, sending a signal to a larger machine. Such a sensor would supposedly cost less and use less power than a conventional sensor, and yet function usefully in all the same applications — for example, turning on parking lot lights when it gets dark.\n\nWhile smart materials and nanosensors both exemplify useful applications of MNT, they pale in comparison with the complexity of the technology most popularly associated with the term: the replicating nanorobot.\n\nMNT nanofacturing is popularly linked with the idea of swarms of coordinated nanoscale robots working together, a popularization of an early proposal by K. Eric Drexler in his 1986 discussions of MNT, but superseded in 1992. In this early proposal, sufficiently capable nanorobots would construct more nanorobots in an artificial environment containing special molecular building blocks.\n\nCritics have doubted both the feasibility of self-replicating nanorobots and the feasibility of control if self-replicating nanorobots could be achieved: they cite the possibility of mutations removing any control and favoring reproduction of mutant pathogenic variations. Advocates address the first doubt by pointing out that the first macroscale autonomous machine replicator, made of Lego blocks, was built and operated experimentally in 2002. While there are sensory advantages present at the macroscale compared to the limited sensorium available at the nanoscale, proposals for positionally controlled nanoscale mechanosynthetic fabrication systems employ dead reckoning of tooltips combined with reliable reaction sequence design to ensure reliable results, hence a limited sensorium is no handicap; similar considerations apply to the positional assembly of small nanoparts. Advocates address the second doubt by arguing that bacteria are (of necessity) evolved to evolve, while nanorobot mutation could be actively prevented by common error-correcting techniques. Similar ideas are advocated in the Foresight Guidelines on Molecular Nanotechnology, and a map of the 137-dimensional replicator design space recently published by Freitas and Merkle provides numerous proposed methods by which replicators could, in principle, be safely controlled by good design.\n\nHowever, the concept of suppressing mutation raises the question: How can design evolution occur at the nanoscale without a process of random mutation and deterministic selection? Critics argue that MNT advocates have not provided a substitute for such a process of evolution in this nanoscale arena where conventional sensory-based selection processes are lacking. The limits of the sensorium available at the nanoscale could make it difficult or impossible to winnow successes from failures. Advocates argue that design evolution should occur deterministically and strictly under human control, using the conventional engineering paradigm of modeling, design, prototyping, testing, analysis, and redesign.\n\nIn any event, since 1992 technical proposals for MNT do not include self-replicating nanorobots, and recent ethical guidelines put forth by MNT advocates prohibit unconstrained self-replication.\n\nOne of the most important applications of MNT would be medical nanorobotics or nanomedicine, an area pioneered by Robert Freitas in numerous books and papers. The ability to design, build, and deploy large numbers of medical nanorobots would, at a minimum, make possible the rapid elimination of disease and the reliable and relatively painless recovery from physical trauma. Medical nanorobots might also make possible the convenient correction of genetic defects, and help to ensure a greatly expanded lifespan. More controversially, medical nanorobots might be used to augment natural human capabilities. One study has reported on the conditions like tumors, arteriosclerosis, blood clots leading to stroke, accumulation of scar tissue and localized pockets of infection can be possibly be addressed by employing medical nanorobots.\n\nAnother proposed application of molecular nanotechnology is \"utility fog\" — in which a cloud of networked microscopic robots (simpler than assemblers) would change its shape and properties to form macroscopic objects and tools in accordance with software commands. Rather than modify the current practices of consuming material goods in different forms, utility fog would simply replace many physical objects.\n\nYet another proposed application of MNT would be phased-array optics (PAO). However, this appears to be a problem addressable by ordinary nanoscale technology. PAO would use the principle of phased-array millimeter technology but at optical wavelengths. This would permit the duplication of any sort of optical effect but virtually. Users could request holograms, sunrises and sunsets, or floating lasers as the mood strikes. PAO systems were described in BC Crandall's \"Nanotechnology: Molecular Speculations on Global Abundance\" in the Brian Wowk article \"Phased-Array Optics.\"\n\nMolecular manufacturing is a potential future subfield of nanotechnology that would make it possible to build complex structures at atomic precision. Molecular manufacturing requires significant advances in nanotechnology, but once achieved could produce highly advanced products at low costs and in large quantities in nanofactories weighing a kilogram or more. When nanofactories gain the ability to produce other nanofactories production may only be limited by relatively abundant factors such as input materials, energy and software.\n\nThe products of molecular manufacturing could range from cheaper, mass-produced versions of known high-tech products to novel products with added capabilities in many areas of application. Some applications that have been suggested are advanced smart materials, nanosensors, medical nanorobots and space travel. Additionally, molecular manufacturing could be used to cheaply produce highly advanced, durable weapons, which is an area of special concern regarding the impact of nanotechnology. Being equipped with compact computers and motors these could be increasingly autonomous and have a large range of capabilities.\n\nAccording to Chris Phoenix and Mike Treder from the Center for Responsible Nanotechnology as well as Anders Sandberg from the Future of Humanity Institute molecular manufacturing is the application of nanotechnology that poses the most significant global catastrophic risk. Several nanotechnology researchers state that the bulk of risk from nanotechnology comes from the potential to lead to war, arms races and destructive global government. Several reasons have been suggested why the availability of nanotech weaponry may with significant likelihood lead to unstable arms races (compared to e.g. nuclear arms races): (1) A large number of players may be tempted to enter the race since the threshold for doing so is low; (2) the ability to make weapons with molecular manufacturing will be cheap and easy to hide; (3) therefore lack of insight into the other parties' capabilities can tempt players to arm out of caution or to launch preemptive strikes; (4) molecular manufacturing may reduce dependency on international trade, a potential peace-promoting factor; (5) wars of aggression may pose a smaller economic threat to the aggressor since manufacturing is cheap and humans may not be needed on the battlefield.\n\nSince self-regulation by all state and non-state actors seems hard to achieve, measures to mitigate war-related risks have mainly been proposed in the area of international cooperation. International infrastructure may be expanded giving more sovereignty to the international level. This could help coordinate efforts for arms control. International institutions dedicated specifically to nanotechnology (perhaps analogously to the International Atomic Energy Agency IAEA) or general arms control may also be designed. One may also jointly make differential technological progress on defensive technologies, a policy that players should usually favour. The Center for Responsible Nanotechnology also suggest some technical restrictions. Improved transparency regarding technological capabilities may be another important facilitator for arms-control.\n\nA grey goo is another catastrophic scenario, which was proposed by Eric Drexler in his 1986 book \"Engines of Creation\", has been analyzed by Freitas in \"Some Limits to Global Ecophagy by Biovorous Nanoreplicators, with Public Policy Recommendations\" and has been a theme in mainstream media and fiction. This scenario involves tiny self-replicating robots that consume the entire biosphere using it as a source of energy and building blocks. Nanotech experts including Drexler now discredit the scenario. According to Chris Phoenix a \"So-called grey goo could only be the product of a deliberate and difficult engineering process, not an accident\". With the advent of nano-biotech, a different scenario called green goo has been forwarded. Here, the malignant substance is not nanobots but rather self-replicating biological organisms engineered through nanotechnology.\n\nNanotechnology (or molecular nanotechnology to refer more specifically to the goals discussed here) will let us continue the historical trends in manufacturing right up to the fundamental limits imposed by physical law. It will let us make remarkably powerful molecular computers. It will let us make materials over fifty times lighter than steel or aluminium alloy but with the same strength. We'll be able to make jets, rockets, cars or even chairs that, by today's standards, would be remarkably light, strong, and inexpensive. Molecular surgical tools, guided by molecular computers and injected into the blood stream could find and destroy cancer cells or invading bacteria, unclog arteries, or provide oxygen when the circulation is impaired.\n\nNanotechnology will replace our entire manufacturing base with a new, radically more precise, radically less expensive, and radically more flexible way of making products. The aim is not simply to replace today's computer chip making plants, but also to replace the assembly lines for cars, televisions, telephones, books, surgical tools, missiles, bookcases, airplanes, tractors, and all the rest. The objective is a pervasive change in manufacturing, a change that will leave virtually no product untouched. Economic progress and military readiness in the 21st Century will depend fundamentally on maintaining a competitive position in nanotechnology.\n\nDespite the current early developmental status of nanotechnology and molecular nanotechnology, much concern surrounds MNT's anticipated impact on economics and on law. Whatever the exact effects, MNT, if achieved, would tend to reduce the scarcity of manufactured goods and make many more goods (such as food and health aids) manufacturable.\n\nMNT should make possible nanomedical capabilities able to cure any medical condition not already cured by advances in other areas. Good health would be common, and poor health of any form would be as rare as smallpox and scurvy are today. Even cryonics would be feasible, as cryopreserved tissue could be fully repaired.\n\nMolecular nanotechnology is one of the technologies that some analysts believe could lead to a technological singularity.\nSome feel that molecular nanotechnology would have daunting risks. It conceivably could enable cheaper and more destructive conventional weapons. Also, molecular nanotechnology might permit weapons of mass destruction that could self-replicate, as viruses and cancer cells do when attacking the human body. Commentators generally agree that, in the event molecular nanotechnology were developed, its self-replication should be permitted only under very controlled or \"inherently safe\" conditions.\n\nA fear exists that nanomechanical robots, if achieved, and if designed to self-replicate using naturally occurring materials (a difficult task), could consume the entire planet in their hunger for raw materials, or simply crowd out natural life, out-competing it for energy (as happened historically when blue-green algae appeared and outcompeted earlier life forms). Some commentators have referred to this situation as the \"grey goo\" or \"ecophagy\" scenario. K. Eric Drexler considers an accidental \"grey goo\" scenario extremely unlikely and says so in later editions of \"Engines of Creation\".\n\nIn light of this perception of potential danger, the Foresight Institute, founded by Drexler, has prepared a set of guidelines for the ethical development of nanotechnology. These include the banning of free-foraging self-replicating pseudo-organisms on the Earth's surface, at least, and possibly in other places.\n\nThe feasibility of the basic technologies analyzed in \"Nanosystems\" has been the subject of a formal scientific review by U.S. National Academy of Sciences, and has also been the focus of extensive debate on the internet and in the popular press.\n\nIn 2006, U.S. National Academy of Sciences released the report of a study of molecular manufacturing as part of a longer report, \"A Matter of Size: Triennial Review of the National Nanotechnology Initiative\" The study committee reviewed the technical content of \"Nanosystems\", and in its conclusion states that no current theoretical analysis can be considered definitive regarding several questions of potential system performance, and that optimal paths for implementing high-performance systems cannot be predicted with confidence. It recommends experimental research to advance knowledge in this area:\n\nA section heading in Drexler's \"Engines of Creation\" reads \"Universal Assemblers\", and the following text speaks of multiple types of assemblers which, collectively, could hypothetically \"build almost anything that the laws of nature allow to exist.\" Drexler's colleague Ralph Merkle has noted that, contrary to widespread legend, Drexler never claimed that assembler systems could build absolutely any molecular structure. The endnotes in Drexler's book explain the qualification \"almost\": \"For example, a delicate structure might be designed that, like a stone arch, would self-destruct unless all its pieces were already in place. If there were no room in the design for the placement and removal of a scaffolding, then the structure might be impossible to build. Few structures of practical interest seem likely to exhibit such a problem, however.\"\n\nIn 1992, Drexler published \"Nanosystems: Molecular Machinery, Manufacturing, and Computation\", a detailed proposal for synthesizing stiff covalent structures using a table-top factory. Diamondoid structures and other stiff covalent structures, if achieved, would have a wide range of possible applications, going far beyond current MEMS technology. An outline of a path was put forward in 1992 for building a table-top factory in the absence of an assembler. Other researchers have begun advancing tentative, alternative proposed paths for this in the years since Nanosystems was published.\n\nIn 2004 Richard Jones wrote Soft Machines (nanotechnology and life), a book for lay audiences published by Oxford University. In this book he describes radical nanotechnology (as advocated by Drexler) as a deterministic/mechanistic idea of nano engineered machines that does not take into account the nanoscale challenges such as wetness, stickiness, Brownian motion, and high viscosity. He also explains what is soft nanotechnology or more appropriatelly biomimetic nanotechnology which is the way forward, if not the best way, to design functional nanodevices that can cope with all the problems at a nanoscale. One can think of soft nanotechnology as the development of nanomachines that uses the lessons learned from biology on how things work, chemistry to precisely engineer such devices and stochastic physics to model the system and its natural processes in detail.\n\nSeveral researchers, including Nobel Prize winner Dr. Richard Smalley (1943–2005), attacked the notion of universal assemblers, leading to a rebuttal from Drexler and colleagues, and eventually to an exchange of letters. Smalley argued that chemistry is extremely complicated, reactions are hard to control, and that a universal assembler is science fiction. Drexler and colleagues, however, noted that Drexler never proposed universal assemblers able to make absolutely anything, but instead proposed more limited assemblers able to make a very wide variety of things. They challenged the relevance of Smalley's arguments to the more specific proposals advanced in \"Nanosystems\". Also, Smalley argued that nearly all of modern chemistry involves reactions that take place in a solvent (usually water), because the small molecules of a solvent contribute many things, such as lowering binding energies for transition states. Since nearly all known chemistry requires a solvent, Smalley felt that Drexler's proposal to use a high vacuum environment was not feasible. However, Drexler addresses this in Nanosystems by showing mathematically that well designed catalysts can provide the effects of a solvent and can fundamentally be made even more efficient than a solvent/enzyme reaction could ever be. It is noteworthy that, contrary to Smalley's opinion that enzymes require water, \"Not only do enzymes work vigorously in anhydrous organic media, but in this unnatural milieu they acquire remarkable properties such as greatly enhanced stability, radically altered substrate and enantiomeric specificities, molecular memory, and the ability to catalyse unusual reactions.\"\n\nFor the future, some means have to be found for MNT design evolution at the nanoscale which mimics the process of biological evolution at the molecular scale. Biological evolution proceeds by random variation in ensemble averages of organisms combined with culling of the less-successful variants and reproduction of the more-successful variants, and macroscale engineering design also proceeds by a process of design evolution from simplicity to complexity as set forth somewhat satirically by John Gall: \"A complex system that works is invariably found to have evolved from a simple system that worked. . . . A complex system designed from scratch never works and can not be patched up to make it work. You have to start over, beginning with a system that works.\" A breakthrough in MNT is needed which proceeds from the simple atomic ensembles which can be built with, e.g., an STM to complex MNT systems via a process of design evolution. A handicap in this process is the difficulty of seeing and manipulation at the nanoscale compared to the macroscale which makes deterministic selection of successful trials difficult; in contrast biological evolution proceeds via action of what Richard Dawkins has called the \"blind watchmaker\"\ncomprising random molecular variation and deterministic reproduction/extinction.\n\nAt present in 2007 the practice of nanotechnology embraces both stochastic approaches (in which, for example, supramolecular chemistry creates waterproof pants) and deterministic approaches wherein single molecules (created by stochastic chemistry) are manipulated on substrate surfaces (created by stochastic deposition methods) by deterministic methods comprising nudging them with STM or AFM probes and causing simple binding or cleavage reactions to occur. The dream of a complex, deterministic molecular nanotechnology remains elusive. Since the mid-1990s, thousands of surface scientists and thin film technocrats have latched on to the nanotechnology bandwagon and redefined their disciplines as nanotechnology. This has caused much confusion in the field and has spawned thousands of \"nano\"-papers on the peer reviewed literature. Most of these reports are extensions of the more ordinary research done in the parent fields.\n\nThe feasibility of Drexler's proposals largely depends, therefore, on whether designs like those in \"Nanosystems\" could be built in the absence of a universal assembler to build them and would work as described. Supporters of molecular nanotechnology frequently claim that no significant errors have been discovered in \"Nanosystems\" since 1992. Even some critics concede that \"Drexler has carefully considered a number of physical principles underlying the 'high level' aspects of the nanosystems he proposes and, indeed, has thought in some detail\" about some issues.\n\nOther critics claim, however, that \"Nanosystems\" omits important chemical details about the low-level 'machine language' of molecular nanotechnology. They also claim that much of the other low-level chemistry in \"Nanosystems\" requires extensive further work, and that Drexler's higher-level designs therefore rest on speculative foundations. Recent such further work by Freitas and Merkle is aimed at strengthening these foundations by filling the existing gaps in the low-level chemistry.\n\nDrexler argues that we may need to wait until our conventional nanotechnology improves before solving these issues: \"Molecular manufacturing will result from a series of advances in molecular machine systems, much as the first Moon landing resulted from a series of advances in liquid-fuel rocket systems. We are now in a position like that of the British Interplanetary Society of the 1930s which described how multistage liquid-fueled rockets could reach the Moon and pointed to early rockets as illustrations of the basic principle.\" However, Freitas and Merkle argue that a focused effort to achieve diamond mechanosynthesis (DMS) can begin now, using existing technology, and might achieve success in less than a decade if their \"direct-to-DMS approach is pursued rather than a more circuitous development approach that seeks to implement less efficacious nondiamondoid molecular manufacturing technologies before progressing to diamondoid\".\n\nTo summarize the arguments against feasibility: First, critics argue that a primary barrier to achieving molecular nanotechnology is the lack of an efficient way to create machines on a molecular/atomic scale, especially in the absence of a well-defined path toward a self-replicating assembler or diamondoid nanofactory. Advocates respond that a preliminary research path leading to a diamondoid nanofactory is being developed.\n\nA second difficulty in reaching molecular nanotechnology is design. Hand design of a gear or bearing at the level of atoms might take a few to several weeks. While Drexler, Merkle and others have created designs of simple parts, no comprehensive design effort for anything approaching the complexity of a Model T Ford has been attempted. Advocates respond that it is difficult to undertake a comprehensive design effort in the absence of significant funding for such efforts, and that despite this handicap much useful design-ahead has nevertheless been accomplished with new software tools that have been developed, e.g., at Nanorex.\n\nIn the latest report \"A Matter of Size: Triennial Review of the National Nanotechnology Initiative\" put out by the National Academies Press in December 2006 (roughly twenty years after Engines of Creation was published), no clear way forward toward molecular nanotechnology could yet be seen, as per the conclusion on page 108 of that report: \"Although theoretical calculations can be made today, the eventually attainable\nrange of chemical reaction cycles, error rates, speed of operation, and thermodynamic\nefficiencies of such bottom-up manufacturing systems cannot be reliably\npredicted at this time. Thus, the eventually attainable perfection and complexity of\nmanufactured products, while they can be calculated in theory, cannot be predicted\nwith confidence. Finally, the optimum research paths that might lead to systems\nwhich greatly exceed the thermodynamic efficiencies and other capabilities of\nbiological systems cannot be reliably predicted at this time. Research funding that\nis based on the ability of investigators to produce experimental demonstrations\nthat link to abstract models and guide long-term vision is most appropriate to\nachieve this goal.\" This call for research leading to demonstrations is welcomed by groups such as the Nanofactory Collaboration who are specifically seeking experimental successes in diamond mechanosynthesis. The \"Technology Roadmap for Productive Nanosystems\" aims to offer additional constructive insights.\n\nIt is perhaps interesting to ask whether or not most structures consistent with physical law can in fact be manufactured. Advocates assert that to achieve most of the vision of molecular manufacturing it is not necessary to be able to build \"any structure that is compatible with natural law.\" Rather, it is necessary to be able to build only a sufficient (possibly modest) subset of such structures—as is true, in fact, of any practical manufacturing process used in the world today, and is true even in biology. In any event, as Richard Feynman once said, \"It is scientific only to say what's more likely or less likely, and not to be proving all the time what's possible or impossible.\"\n\nThere is a growing body of peer-reviewed theoretical work on synthesizing diamond by mechanically removing/adding hydrogen atoms and depositing carbon atoms (a process known as mechanosynthesis). This work is slowly permeating the broader nanoscience community and is being critiqued. For instance, Peng et al. (2006) (in the continuing research effort by Freitas, Merkle and their collaborators) reports that the most-studied mechanosynthesis tooltip motif (DCB6Ge) successfully places a C carbon dimer on a C(110) diamond surface at both 300 K (room temperature) and 80 K (liquid nitrogen temperature), and that the silicon variant (DCB6Si) also works at 80 K but not at 300 K. Over 100,000 CPU hours were invested in this latest study. The DCB6 tooltip motif, initially described by Merkle and Freitas at a Foresight Conference in 2002, was the first complete tooltip ever proposed for diamond mechanosynthesis and remains the only tooltip motif that has been successfully simulated for its intended function on a full 200-atom diamond surface.\n\nThe tooltips modeled in this work are intended to be used only in carefully controlled environments (e. g., vacuum). Maximum acceptable limits for tooltip translational and rotational misplacement errors are reported in Peng et al. (2006) -- tooltips must be positioned with great accuracy to avoid bonding the dimer incorrectly. Peng et al. (2006) reports that increasing the handle thickness from 4 support planes of C atoms above the tooltip to 5 planes decreases the resonance frequency of the entire structure from 2.0 THz to 1.8 THz. More importantly, the vibrational footprints of a DCB6Ge tooltip mounted on a 384-atom handle and of the same tooltip mounted on a similarly constrained but much larger 636-atom \"crossbar\" handle are virtually identical in the non-crossbar directions. Additional computational studies modeling still bigger handle structures are welcome, but the ability to precisely position SPM tips to the requisite atomic accuracy has been repeatedly demonstrated experimentally at low temperature, or even at room temperature constituting a basic existence proof for this capability.\n\nFurther research to consider additional tooltips will require time-consuming computational chemistry and difficult laboratory work.\n\nA working nanofactory would require a variety of well-designed tips for different reactions, and detailed analyses of placing atoms on more complicated surfaces. Although this appears a challenging problem given current resources, many tools will be available to help future researchers: Moore's law predicts further increases in computer power, semiconductor fabrication techniques continue to approach the nanoscale, and researchers grow ever more skilled at using proteins, ribosomes and DNA to perform novel chemistry.\n\n\n\n"}

Maybury was kidnapped, raped, and murdered on 6 November 1984, the date of the 1984 Melbourne Cup Day; and she was nicknamed in the Melbourne tabloid newspaper \"The Sun News-Pictorial\" as the Cup Day Girl.\n\nMore than 30 years after her death, in June 2016 Victoria Police arrested and charged Gregory Keith Davies with the abduction, rape, and murder of Maybury. Davies later pleaded guilty to the murder and rape of Maybury and in December 2017 he was sentenced to life imprisonment with a non-parole period of 28 years.\n\n<mapframe text=\"Modern-day map of Preston, Victoria\" width=250 height=250 zoom=17 latitude=-37.73802 longitude=145.01212/>\nMaybury lived with her younger sister and their mother in Gregory Grove.\n\nOn the afternoon of 6 November 1984, Maybury had been sent to a convenience store on Plenty Road to buy a bag of sugar, which she bought at around 5:30 pm. She was last seen going home, carrying a bag of sugar, and looking as if she were lost. Her mother and neighbour went looking for her at around 6:00 pm, when a woman approached them saying that she'd seen a girl being driven away in a white Holden station wagon. Maybury's body was found in the gutter of Donald Street at about 00:45 that night by a fire brigade electrician, Neil Rickwood, but had not been there when police searched Donald Street at 7:30 pm.\n\nShe had died of asphyxiation while being raped and had suffered severe internal injuries, including vaginal trauma. The autopsy found that diazepam, a strong sedative, was in her body, suggesting that she had been drugged.\n\nMaybury's murder received significant media coverage. \n\nMaybury was interred at Fawkner Crematorium and Memorial Park. Her uncle, Mark Maybury, was a suspect in the case; he committed suicide in 1987. He was later found to be innocent of the crime, and is buried in the same cemetery as Maybury. Her grandfather, John Moss, was similarly a suspect, committing suicide in 1985.\n\nIn the 1990s, Victorian Police focused their attention on Robert Arthur Selby Lowe, who had murdered Melbourne schoolgirl Sheree Beasley. Shortly before Maybury's murder, Lowe had been interviewed by police about offensive behaviour to young girls near Preston. DNA profiling later proved that Lowe was not responsible for Maybury's murder. Victoria Police began a new investigation into the murder among other cold cases in 2014, after media interest in the case led to numerous suspects being reported to the police.\n\nIn June 2016, a 73-year-old man, Gregory Keith Davies, was charged with the false imprisonment, rape and murder of Maybury, with a committal hearing for the case scheduled for May 2017. Davies was interviewed by police two days after the murder during the original investigation. In 1970, he had bludgeoned a teenage girl with a hammer and told police he intended to rape her. At the time of the attack on Maybury, Davies lived in the area with his mother, and drove a white Holden, but was removed from the investigation without giving a DNA sample because he gave an alibi. \n\nOn 29 May 2017, Davies pleaded guilty to one charge of murder and one of rape, with the false imprisonment charge being taken into consideration. The following day, Davies was remanded into custody until a plea hearing on 21 September. On 23 July Davies was attacked by another inmate while on remand, suffering serious burns from scalding water. On 21 December 2017, Davies was sentenced by Lasry J in the Supreme Court of Victoria to life imprisonment and with a minimum of non-parole period 28 years. Davies may be eligible for parole in 2045; aged 101 years.\n\nEarlier in his life Davies was convicted of another sex crime; and, according to a relative, Davies spent years jailed for other sex crimes against children. After the publicity of Maybury's rape and murder, several children told their parents that Davies had sexually assaulted them, but the charges against Davies were dropped as prosecutors suggested that it would be too hard for the children to testify in court. Lasry J revealed in the sentencing proceedings that in May 1968 Davies was placed on a three-year good behaviour bond for larceny, fraud, and uttering. In February 1971 he was tried in the Victorian Supreme Court on the charge of attempted murder and wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm, the victim being a 14-year-old girl. Davies was acquitted on the basis on insanity, yet ordered to be detained at the Governor's pleasure and was released from custody on 3 November 1982. During this ten-year period in custody, Davies did not undergo any psychiatric treatment. In 1993 Davies was convicted on a number of burglary, theft, and dishonesty charges; in 1996 he was convicted of charges involving indecent assault and gross indecency charges for which he served time in custody.\n\n"}

{"id": "34956958", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=34956958", "title": "New Orleans Saints bounty scandal", "text": "New Orleans Saints bounty scandal\n\nThe New Orleans Saints bounty scandal, widely dubbed \"Bountygate,\" was an incident in which members of the New Orleans Saints team of the National Football League (NFL) were found guilty of paying out bonuses, or \"bounties\", for injuring opposing team players. The pool was alleged to have been in operation from 2009 (the year in which the Saints won Super Bowl XLIV) to 2011.\n\nLeague commissioner Roger Goodell responded with some of the most severe sanctions in the league's 92-year history, and among the most severe punishments for in-game misconduct in North American professional sports history. Defensive coordinator Gregg Williams was suspended indefinitely, though this would be overturned the following year. Head coach Sean Payton was suspended for the entire 2012 season—the first time since Chuck Fairbanks in 1978 that a head coach had been suspended. General manager Mickey Loomis was suspended for the first eight games of the 2012 season. Assistant head coach Joe Vitt was suspended for the first six games of the 2012 season. The Saints organization was penalized with a $500,000 fine and forced to forfeit their second-round draft selections in 2012 and 2013. In May 2012, four current and former Saints players were suspended after being named as ringleaders in the scandal, with linebacker Jonathan Vilma also being suspended for the entire 2012 season. However, former commissioner Paul Tagliabue overturned all sanctions against the players in December 2012 after finding that despite the players being \"very much involved\", the coaches and the Saints organization were primarily responsible for the scandal.\n\nThe NFL has long frowned upon bounties, or \"non-contract bonuses\" as it officially calls them; but an underground culture of bounties is alleged to exist, with teams, it is claimed, turning a blind eye to the practice. The league constitution specifically forbids payment of bonuses based on performances against an individual player or team, as well as bonuses for on-field misconduct; the NFL holds that such practices undermine the integrity of the game, and also would allow teams to use such payments to circumvent the salary cap. The collective bargaining agreement with the NFL Players Association also forbids this practice, as does the standard NFL player contract. Every year, the NFL sends a memo reiterating this ban to every team before training camp opens. However, according to many former players, bounty systems of some sort have been around the NFL for decades, with the percentage of players participating non-scientifically estimated to be between 30 and 40 percent. According to these players, such bounty programs were usually informal and often between players only, more with intent at locker-room braggadocio than systemic malice. What would draw attention to the Saints' bounty program was the alleged practice of methodically organizing such a concept at the coaches' level, with the primary intent to systematically and routinely injure opposing star players.\n\nAfter the Saints defeated the Minnesota Vikings in the , several Vikings players and coaches claimed that the Saints were deliberately trying to hurt Vikings quarterback Brett Favre. The Vikings were particularly angered when Saints defensive end Bobby McCray and defensive tackle Remi Ayodele knocked Favre to the ground with a high-low hit. McCray hit Favre below the knees, briefly knocking Favre out of the game with an ankle injury. No penalty was called on the play, though NFL vice president of officiating Mike Pereira said one should have been called, saying it was \"the type of hit we don't want.\" Vikings coach Brad Childress later said that there were at least 13 instances where he felt the Saints deliberately went after Favre. Later, CBSSports.com NFL columnist Clark Judge said several Vikings assistants told him they believed McCray was acting on direct orders from Williams, with at least one being so outraged that he threatened to \"punch [Williams] in the face\" the next time they met. Vikings owner Zygi Wilf even went as far as to complain to the league about what happened to Favre, though no action was taken at the time. Favre took such a severe beating that Vikings punter Chris Kluwe and placekicker Ryan Longwell wondered during the game if someone had put a bounty on him.\n\nFavre's agent, Bus Cook, later said that he also felt the Saints were deliberately trying to knock Favre out of the game, and claimed that several hits on Arizona Cardinals quarterback Kurt Warner in the divisional round a week earlier crossed the line as well. It initially appeared that Cook's argument was strengthened by the fact that Warner was knocked out of that game with a chest injury (although he later returned), and retired two weeks later. However, Warner later said that the hit which knocked him out was legal, and had nothing to do with his decision to retire.\n\nIn the 2010 offseason, an anonymous player told NFL officials that the Saints had targeted Favre and Warner as part of a bounty program administered by Williams; the NFL's security department found the allegations credible enough to open an investigation. However, the players and team officials interviewed all denied that any bounty program existed, and the player who made the initial report subsequently recanted his allegations.\n\nThe NFL began investigating the Saints in 2010 in response to allegations of deliberate attempts to injure players during the 2009–10 playoffs, but the investigation stalled until late in the 2011 season. On March 2, 2012, the NFL announced that it had evidence that defensive coordinator Gregg Williams had created the program soon after his arrival in 2009, and alleged that \"between 22 and 27 Saints players\" were involved. Williams and the players pooled their own money to pay out performance bonuses. It also asserted that head coach Sean Payton tried to cover up the scheme, and that he and general manager Mickey Loomis failed to shut it down when ordered to do so by team owner Tom Benson. Since then, Williams has been accused of operating similar schemes during his tenure as defensive coordinator of the Tennessee Oilers/Titans and Washington Redskins and as head coach of the Buffalo Bills; the NFL briefly investigated these allegations but elected to focus on the Saints.\n\nIn 2012, ESPN reported that former New Orleans Saints defensive assistant Mike Cerullo contacted the NFL regarding a bounty program after the 2009 postseason. Cerullo was released after the 2009 postseason for poor performance and lying about personal leave according to the New Orleans Saints. Cerullo testified that he kept track of payments and pledges made. Cerullo also states in the article, \"I was angry for being let go from the Saints\". In the summer of 2017, the NFL hired Mike Cerullo as Director of Football Administration. \n\nLate in the 2011 season, the NFL received what it called \"significant and credible new information\" that suggested there was indeed a \"bounty\" program in place. League officials, convinced that this information was irrefutable evidence a program was indeed in place, alerted Benson of their findings just before the Saints' first-round playoff game against the Detroit Lions. The investigation continued during the 2011–12 playoffs and continued through the 2012 offseason.\n\nOn March 2, 2012, ESPN's Adam Schefter reported that the NFL had indeed found evidence of a bounty program. Later that day, the NFL announced it had obtained irrefutable proof of a bounty pool dating back to the 2009 season, based on a review of 18,000 documents. It determined that Williams had initiated the fund soon after he arrived in New Orleans in 2009, in hopes of making the defense more aggressive. Between 22 and 27 Saints defensive players were involved. The players and Williams contributed their own cash to the pot, and received cash payments based on their performance in the previous week's game. For instance, a special teamer who downed a kick returner inside the receiving team's 20-yard-line earned $100. Players could also be fined for mental mistakes and penalties. Players also received \"bounties\" for \"cart-offs\" (plays in which an opponent was removed from the field on a stretcher or cart) and \"knockouts\" (plays that resulted in a player being unable to return for the rest of the game). Players usually earned $1,000 for \"cart-offs\" and $1,500 for \"knockouts\" during the regular season, though they were encouraged to put their winnings back into the pot in order to raise the stakes as the season went on. Payments were known to double or even triple during the playoffs.\n\nThe NFL sent a confidential and detailed memo to all 32 teams detailing its findings. It revealed that the Saints had not only targeted Warner and Favre during the 2009 playoffs, but had also targeted Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers and Carolina Panthers quarterback Cam Newton during the 2011 regular season. According to that memo, Saints linebacker Jonathan Vilma offered $10,000 cash to any teammate who knocked Favre out of the NFC Championship Game. Another source told CBSSports.com's Mike Freeman that Reggie Bush's agent at the time, Michael Ornstein, was closely involved in the scheme from the beginning. Ornstein contributed $10,000 to the pot in 2009, and an undisclosed amount in 2011.\n\nAfter later investigations in the 2012 offseason, the NFL also found evidence that the Saints put a bounty on then-Seattle Seahawks quarterback, Matt Hasselbeck during their 2011 wild-card playoffs game.\n\nThe league found that Payton not only knew about the scheme, but tried to cover it up during both league investigations. During the 2010 investigation, Payton told Williams and Vitt to \"make sure our ducks are in a row\" when the league interviewed them. Before the start of the 2011 season, Payton received an email from Ornstein detailing the broader lines of the scheme. In that same email, Ornstein offered $5,000 to anyone who knocked Rodgers out of the 2011 season opener. Payton initially denied knowing that this email existed, but subsequently admitted that in fact he had read it.\n\nWhen Benson was informed of the league's findings, he called in Payton and Loomis and ordered the program shut down immediately. However, they did not do so. Loomis had been interviewed during the 2010 investigation as well, and had stated that he knew of no such scheme and would stop it immediately if it was taking place. The league also found that Vitt, whom Payton had assigned to monitor Williams (the two reportedly didn't get along very well), also knew about the broader lines of the scheme and even witnessed Williams handing out payments to players. However, Vitt failed to tell anyone about it.\n\nThe NFL found that Payton and Loomis' misfeasance amounted to \"conduct detrimental\" to the league. The NFL found no club money had been used to fund the bounty pool, and praised Benson for doing what he could to shut down the slush fund. Nonetheless, it found the Saints organization as a whole guilty of conduct detrimental to the league as well due to Williams and the players' maintenance of the bounty pool, as well as Loomis and Payton's failure to act \"in a responsible manner\" to stop it.\n\nSeveral Chicago Bears players and fans believe that the Bears were targets of this program during the second game of the 2011 season, a 30–13 loss to the Saints. Quarterback Jay Cutler was sacked six times, and nearly lost his voice when a Saints player kicked him in the throat. Later in the game, offensive tackle Frank Omiyale yanked a Saints defender off Cutler when he saw what he later called \"some dirty stuff.\" Tampa Bay Buccaneers quarterback Josh Freeman reported that the Saints' tendency toward illegal hits was common knowledge among the Tampa Bay coaching staff. Preparations for Saints games included warnings to offensive players to keep their knees protected, especially on plays near the sidelines.\n\nIn June 2012, the league revealed that it possessed a ledger detailing the weekly earnings of the players, which are earned for cart-offs ($1000) and \"whacks\" ($400) and deducted for \"mental errors\".\n\nHowever, on July 26, 2012, Vilma and seven witnesses from the Saints testified in front of a federal judge in New Orleans that NFL commissioner Roger Goodell got his facts wrong in the bounty scandal.\"Everybody was sworn in under oath in front of a judge with the risk of perjury and jail time if we were lying, and categorically denied there was a bounty,\" Vilma said in a text message to ESPN's Ed Werder. \"Seven people testified, 2 sworn affidavits (one by Drew Brees) all saying the same thing. I ask that you and ESPN report the facts. No more bias or b.s. or hearsay. I gave you facts that you can report if so choose.\" Tulane University Sports Law Program Director Gabe Feldman (who attended the hearing in court) said, \"Clearly the judge, by her questions, indicated she thinks Goodell overstepped his authority, and this case was always going to be about if he executed his power fairly... The NFL's retort is that with all due deference, you don't get to second guess (commissioner Roger Goodell). Judges only have limited jurisdiction over arbitration issues.\"\n\nSaints All-Pro quarterback Drew Brees made a somewhat controversial tweet on June 20, 2012 stating, \"If NFL fans were told there were \"weapons of mass destruction\" enough times, they'd believe it. But what happens when you don't find any????\" Brees immediately issued another statement to clarify, \"My WMD comment has nothing to do with politics or our brave military. Merely an analogy to show how media influences public perception.\" He went on to say, \"I apologize if the WMD comment offended anyone. Especially our military. There is no one I respect more than our service men and women.\"\n\nShortly after the Saints' bounty system came to light, four former Washington Redskins players, as well as a coach, told \"The Washington Post\" that Williams operated a similar system while he was the Redskins' defensive coordinator from 2004 to 2007. The players said that Williams paid his crew thousands of dollars for aggressive play, with the biggest payouts—as much as $8,000—coming for \"kill shots\" that knocked opposing players out of games. \"Chicago Tribune\" NFL analyst Matt Bowen, who played for the Redskins at the time, later wrote in one of his regular columns that the bounty pool was funded by fines for mistakes made during practice and in games, and insisted similar systems operated on other teams. On March 4, \"The Post\" reported that the NFL was investigating the allegations against Williams with the Redskins.\n\nSeveral former Bills players subsequently told \"The Buffalo News\" of a similar system during Williams' tenure as Bills' head coach from 2001 to 2003. However, they didn't agree on whether there were rewards for intentionally injuring players. Coy Wire, a safety during Williams' tenure, said that Williams gave bonuses for hits that left opponents seriously injured, and two other players said that bonuses were also awarded for \"knockouts.\" However, linebacker Eddie Robinson, who played for Williams in Houston and Tennessee as well as in Buffalo, acknowledged an incentive pool but said he never heard Williams favor deliberately injuring other players. Ruben Brown, a guard for the Bills during Williams's time as coach there, denied there was any sort of bounty system in place in Buffalo, a position reiterated by linebacker London Fletcher and then-general manager Tom Donahoe. Chidi Ahanotu, who played one year under Williams in Buffalo, indicated that such a program was not within his character at the time and that Williams was \"the softest coach I've been around.\"\n\nFormer NFL coach Tony Dungy later told Profootballtalk.com he was certain that Williams operated a similar bounty system while he was defensive coordinator of the Oilers/Titans from 1997 to 2000. He also believes that Williams put a bounty on Indianapolis Colts quarterback Peyton Manning during Super Bowl XLIV, and targeted Manning on several occasions while with the Titans. The revelation of the bounty system also caused renewed speculation about a 2006 game between the Redskins and Colts, in which Manning was knocked down by a high-low hit from the Redskins' Phillip Daniels and Andre Carter and appeared to lose some feeling in his neck. While Dungy didn't speculate at the time about whether the Redskins targeted Manning on that play, he believes that hit ultimately caused the neck problems that sidelined Manning for the entire 2011 season and led to his departure for the Denver Broncos afterward.\n\nFormer safety Ryan Clark, who played under Williams in Washington from 2004–2005 and himself was fined by the NFL $40,000 for a helmet-to-helmet hit against Baltimore Ravens tight end Ed Dickson during the 2011 season, defended Williams, saying that he never ran a bounty program with the Redskins and has yet to see one during his time in the NFL. Clark added that he would've reported Williams or any coach that offered to run such a program. The Steelers released a statement on their official web site mentioning that the team does not condone any sort of bounty program.\n\nWilliams, who left after the season to become defensive coordinator of the St. Louis Rams, was summoned to NFL headquarters after the investigation concluded in mid-February. He initially denied any involvement, but recanted and admitted everything in a meeting with Goodell. After the story broke, Williams issued a statement calling his involvement \"a terrible mistake.\" Williams said that he knew all along the slush fund broke the rules, and that \"I should have stopped it\" rather than get further involved. Goodell said in a statement that he found it \"particularly disturbing\" that the Saints were deliberately trying to injure other players. He said that players and coaches involved in the scheme could face fines or suspensions, and the Saints could be docked picks in the 2012 NFL Draft and future drafts.\n\nBenson issued a statement on the Saints' Website saying, \"I have been made aware of the NFL’s findings relative to the “Bounty Rule” and how it relates to our club. I have offered and the NFL has received our full cooperation in their investigation. While the findings may be troubling, we look forward to putting this behind us and winning more championships in the future for our fans.\"\n\nOn March 3, Fox Sports' Jay Glazer reported that the NFL intended to hand down penalties before the owners' meeting in late March. The NFLPA asked the league to delay any sanctions until the union could conduct its own investigation.\n\nCBSSports.com's Pat Kirwan tweeted that within hours of the NFL releasing its report, lawyers for several players were already telling him that their clients were considering legal action against the Saints and Williams. Former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Steve Young, who has a law degree from BYU, suggested that anyone who had been injured during a Saints game during the scheme's existence has grounds for a lawsuit. Louisiana State University law professor William Corbett told Fox Sports that any legal action by players has a chance of succeeding. He cited a 1977 case in which Denver Broncos defensive back Dale Hackbart sued the Cincinnati Bengals for a late hit to the back by running back Boobie Clark that fractured three vertebrae four years earlier and ended his career. A Colorado court ruled against Hackbart, saying violence was part of the game. However, the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals disagreed, saying that \"the general customs of football\" do not include deliberately attempting to injure opposing players.\n\nOn March 6, Payton and Loomis issued a statement taking \"full responsibility\" for not stopping the alleged \"bounty\" program. Payton and Loomis also apologized to Benson and the Saints fans, and promised that such behavior would never happen again. Three days later, Drew Brees, the starting quarterback for the Saints, issued a statement denying any knowledge of or involvement in the program. On March 12, WWL-TV in New Orleans reported that Payton and Benson met with Goodell in New York for much of the morning to reiterate that the Saints would continue to cooperate fully with the NFL's investigation. On March 22, U.S. Senator Richard Durbin of Illinois announced he would invite Goodell and the heads of the other major American sports leagues to a hearing on bounty systems. He also said that unless the leagues themselves \"come up with standards to make sure this isn't going to happen again,\" he may consider drafting legislation that would extend federal sports bribery laws to cover bounties.\n\nOn April 5, documentary filmmaker Sean Pamphilon released audio of a meeting Williams held with his defense before their 2012 divisional playoff game against the San Francisco 49ers. In a profanity-laced speech, Williams instructed his players to deliberately try to injure several 49ers players. He ordered his men to try to knock out running back Kendall Hunter, even if it meant hitting him out of bounds. He specifically directed them to try to tear wide receiver Michael Crabtree's ACL, injure tight end Vernon Davis' ankles and go after kick returner Kyle Williams specifically because he had a history of concussions. He also appeared to put a bounty on quarterback Alex Smith; according to Pamphilon, after Williams told his men to hit Smith in the chin, \"then he rubs his thumb against his index and middle fingers – the cash sign – and says, \"I got the first one. I got the first one. Go get it. Go lay that motherfucker out.\"\" Pamphilon, who was doing a documentary on Steve Gleason and his fight against Lou Gehrig's Disease, released the audio to Yahoo! Sports without Gleason's approval. However, the Saints were not penalized for illegal hits during that game, which they lost 36–32.\n\nOn March 21, 2012, the NFL issued sanctions to Saints coaches and front-office personnel for their roles in the scandal.\n\nThe Saints were also fined $500,000—the maximum fine permitted under the league constitution, and had to forfeit their second-round draft picks in 2012 and 2013 (their first-round pick in 2012 had already been traded to the New England Patriots, and therefore, could not be forfeited; after the penalty; the Saints' first pick in the 2012 NFL Draft is a third-rounder) He also gave the league's clubs until March 30, 2012 to certify in writing that they do not have bounty programs. Clubs will also be required to certify that no bounty systems exist as part of the yearly certifications they must make under the league's Integrity of the Game Policy.\n\nIn a statement, Goodell said that the NFL would not tolerate \"conduct or a culture\" that put player safety at risk. He also said that the fact that the scheme went on for three years demanded that \"a strong and lasting message must be sent that such conduct is totally unacceptable and has no place in the game.\" He was particularly upset that those involved had lied about the scheme on two separate investigations, and had denied that there was ever a bounty program in place. In an interview with NFL Network's Rich Eisen, Goodell said that the threat to player safety, as well as the fact the Saints lied about it, demanded significant punishment. \"I don't think you can be too hard on people that put at risk our players' health and safety,\" Goodell told Eisen. He reiterated this in an interview later that day with ESPN's Schefter, saying that the fact those involved \"continued to mislead\" the league about it was a significant factor in the sanctions. \"You have to be accountable and responsible in the NFL,\" Goodell said. Goodell also implied that Payton would have faced significant punishment in any event, since his contractual obligation to supervise his assistants meant that he at least should have known about the scheme. He also said that there would be zero tolerance for payments for in-game performance in the future, saying that payments for good play eventually escalate to bounties for deliberately injuring players. Later, Schefter said on ESPN's SportsCenter that league officials felt Payton was at least as guilty as Williams, despite initial focus on Williams' role as the mastermind in the scheme.\n\nOn March 30, Payton, Vitt and Loomis appealed their suspensions, and the Saints also appealed the fine and loss of draft picks. Payton, Vitt and Loomis met with Goodell on April 5. After that meeting, Vitt's lawyer, David Cornwell, said that Payton and Loomis met with Williams before the divisional playoff game and ordered him to shut down the bounty program immediately. Cornwell contended that Williams was a \"rogue coach,\" and the recently released audio of his meeting with the defense only proved it.\n\nGoodell denied the appeals on April 9, meaning that Payton's suspension began as of April 16. However, depending on the Saints' cooperation and that of the individuals involved, Goodell could restore the Saints' second-round pick in 2013 (though the Saints would still lose a lower-round pick), as well as reduce the fine on the Saints and restore Payton, Vitt and Loomis' lost pay. However, all appeals were denied\n\nThe NFLPA requested that the league should hold off on any punishments for the players until it conducts its own investigation. Goodell told Schefter, however, that he would hand down punishments to the players involved very soon once he gets feedback from the NFLPA.\n\nHours after the sanctions were announced, Kluwe went on KSTP in the Twin Cities and demanded that any players involved in the scheme be severely punished, and that the NFLPA let it be known that \"there's no place in the league for that kind of behavior.\" He even went as far as to call for Vilma—the only player specifically named as being involved in the scheme in the NFL's initial announcements—to be banned from the league for life. His sentiments were echoed a day later by Vikings center John Sullivan, who told KFXN-FM in the Twin Cities that any Saint who deliberately tried to hurt Favre in that game should get a lifetime ban. Sullivan called the Saints' treatment of Favre \"despicable\" and \"the exact opposite of sportsmanship,\" and even called for the league to take some sort of action against players involved in that game who had since retired, such as McCray.\n\nOn May 2, 2012, the NFL suspended four then-current or former Saints players for their involvement in the bounty scandal:\n\nVilma's suspension took effect immediately, while the other three players are allowed to attend training camp. In announcing the suspensions, Goodell said that while a large number of players took part in the program, he chose to suspend those players who \"were in leadership positions at the Saints; contributed a particularly large sum of money toward the program; specifically contributed to a bounty on an opposing player; demonstrated a clear intent to participate in a program that potentially injured opposing players; sought rewards for doing so; and/or obstructed the 2010 investigation.\" The NFL determined that Vilma and Smith helped Williams start the bounty program. Hargrove lied to league officials during the 2010 investigation, but later signed a letter to the NFL admitting that he was active participant in the scheme. He also told at least one other player that the Saints had put a bounty on Favre in the 2009 NFC title game. Fujita, who left the team for the Browns immediately after the Saints won Super Bowl XLIV, pledged \"a significant amount of money\" into the bounty program.\n\nEarlier, Goodell had indicated that he was going to come down hard on the players involved, telling Eisen that they \"enthusiastically embraced\" the scheme. \"They are on the field, so so I don't think they are absolved from any responsibility because of that,\" he said.\n\nThe NFLPA released a statement calling the suspensions unjustified, claiming that Goodell had not furnished them with any evidence supporting the sanctions. The union lodged a formal grievance on May 4, contending that since the suspensions were for on-field misconduct, the players' appeals should be heard by Ted Cottrell and Art Shell, whom the collective bargaining agreement designates as the hearing officers for on-field sanctions. It also contended that since the alleged conduct took place before the most recent CBA was signed in August, Goodell should have deferred to NFL special master Stephen Burbank in ruling on the players' actions. Goodell issued the suspensions as part of his power to sanction any \"conduct detrimental to the integrity and public confidence in the NFL,\" a violation of Article 46 of the CBA. This provision is normally used to sanction off-field conduct. However, a league source told CBSSports.com's Judge that it also gives Goodell the power to rule on in-game conduct if he feels that it runs counter to the integrity of the game.\n\nOn July 26, 2012, Jonathan Vilma and seven witnesses from the Saints testified in front of a federal judge in New Orleans that Goodell got his facts wrong in the bounty scandal. \"Everybody was sworn in under oath in front of a judge with the risk of perjury and jail time if we were lying, and categorically denied there was a bounty,\" Vilma said in a text message to ESPN's Ed Werder. \"Seven people testified, 2 sworn affidavits (one by Drew Brees) all saying the same thing. I ask that you and ESPN report the facts. No more bias or b.s. or hearsay. I gave you facts that you can report if so choose.\" Tulane University Sports Law Program Director Gabe Feldman (who attended the hearing in court) said, \"Clearly the judge, by her questions, indicated she thinks Goodell overstepped his authority, and this case was always going to be about if he executed his power fairly... The NFL's retort is that with all due deference, you don't get to second guess (commissioner Roger Goodell). Judges only have limited jurisdiction over arbitration issues.\"\n\nAll four players appealed their suspensions. On September 7, 2012, the Burbank appeals panel vacated the suspensions imposed on the four, and the NFL confirmed that the ruling reinstated them in time for their first games of the 2012 season two days later. Two days after the fifth game of the season, on October 9, 2012, the league re-issued the suspensions without any changes or reductions; the players' appeals continued.\n\nOn October 27, 2012, former league commissioner Paul Tagliabue postponed the bounty appeals hearing, expecting to set a new schedule on October 29, 2012. On December 11, with three games left in the regular season, Tagliabue vacated the players' suspensions, saying in his ruling, \"I affirm Commissioner Goodell's factual findings as to the four players. I conclude that Hargrove, Smith and Vilma—but not Fujita—engaged in 'conduct detrimental to the integrity of, and public confidence in, the game of professional football ...\" He laid primary responsibility for the scandal on Williams and Payton.\n\nHad the suspensions of Vilma and Hargrove been upheld, they would have been the longest for an on-field incident in modern NFL history, topping the previous record set in 2006, when then-Titans defensive end Albert Haynesworth was given a five-game suspension for stomping on the head of Dallas Cowboys offensive lineman Andre Gurode.\n\nVilma played the final 11 games of the 2012 season for the Saints; Smith played all 16. Fujita played the first four games of the season for the Browns before suffering a season-ending (and ultimately, career-ending) neck injury; he would sign a ceremonial one-day contract with the Saints in the offseason and retire with the team. Hargrove, signed as a free agent by the Green Bay Packers in March 2012, did not play during the 2012 season. Nonetheless, the loss of Payton, combined with the distractions caused by the scandal, proved too much for the Saints to overcome. After finishing 13–3 and reaching the Divisional round of the playoffs a year earlier, they finished 7–9 and missed the playoffs.\n\nThe behavior detailed in the report was almost universally condemned in the press. In an editorial, New Orleans' local paper \"The Times-Picayune\" called the revelations \"an embarrassment for one of the most successful and beloved sports organizations of recent years,\" and that they were \"particularly hard to take for (Saints') fans\" in light of the Saints' rebound after Hurricane Katrina. ESPN columnist Gregg Easterbrook claimed that the Saints' behavior threatened the very integrity of the sport since high school and youth players have long emulated what they see in the NFL. He also claimed that NFL Network yanked its planned replay of the 2009 NFC Championship Game due to concern that fans might look more closely for late hits that should have been called.\n\nMost of the players who were the targets of questionable hits by the Saints, including Favre and Warner, claimed the bounties were merely part of the game. However, several former players interviewed by \"Sports Illustrated\" said that while payments for good hits and sacks were indeed considered part of the game, bounties for intentionally injuring opponents violated an unwritten code. One of those interviewed, Junior Seau, bluntly said that such practices crossed the line into threatening a person's livelihood. (Seau would commit suicide less than two months after the interview was published; it was discovered after his death that he suffered from chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) as a result of the numerous head injuries Seau suffered during his 20-year NFL career.) Seau's sentiments were echoed by Hall of Fame quarterback Fran Tarkenton. In an op-ed for \"The Wall Street Journal\", Tarkenton wrote that he played against the likes of Mean Joe Greene, Ray Nitschke and Dick Butkus, and none of them even considered deliberately trying to hurt him. He also said that he discussed the issue with several players from his era, and they unanimously agreed that players who put bounties on opponents were \"cowards.\"\n\nKevin Seifert, who blogs on the NFC North for ESPN.com, wrote that neither he nor most Vikings fans were surprised at the discovery of the bounty program. Seifert argued that even before the findings were revealed, it was obvious that the Saints were determined to inflict a severe beating on Favre, even if it meant breaking the rules. The only difference in Seifert's mind was that he no longer believed the Saints were out of control. Rather, he wrote, they were acting as \"part of a larger mentality\" instilled by Williams.\n\nSpeculation quickly abounded about how severely Goodell, who has made player safety and the overall integrity of the game a point of emphasis during his six years as commissioner, would punish Williams and the Saints. In his weekly \"Monday Morning Quarterback\" column on March 5, \"SI\"s Peter King wrote that he believed Williams faced at least an eight-game suspension, and that Payton and Loomis would almost certainly be suspended as well. He also argued that Goodell would have no choice but to come down hard on the Saints, given that the league was facing numerous lawsuits brought by former players who suffered head injuries. Given the circumstances, King said, Goodell had a lot of incentive to \"issue a string of suspensions the likes of which the league has never seen.\" In an article written for the March 12 edition of \"SI\", King wrote that league officials were so outraged that they were likely to hand down penalties similar to the season-long bans Paul Hornung and Alex Karras received in 1963 for gambling. Freeman wrote that his sources in the league office had told him that the players, Williams, Payton and Loomis would all face suspensions of at least six games, as well as heavy fines. Freeman's sources also said that Payton's sanctions were likely to dwarf those handed down to the New England Patriots' Bill Belichick in the wake of the 2007 \"Spygate\" affair. He also believed that Goodell was going to use the scandal to \"end the practice of bounty football forever,\" much like the penalties imposed against the Patriots after \"Spygate\" effectively ended the longstanding practice of illicit videotaping.\n\nAfter the sanctions were announced, CBSSports.com's Gregg Doyel wrote that the severity of the punishments handed down to Williams, Payton and Loomis proved that Goodell was truly sincere in his desire to \"take the thuggishness out of the NFL.\" Doyel also said that while many players had chafed at what they saw as Goodell's heavy-handed approach to discipline, he was actually standing up for their safety in the Saints' case. Pereira, now an analyst for Fox Sports, wrote that based on his experience in the league office, he wasn't surprised that Goodell came down hard on the Saints. He recalled that Goodell was always upset when officials didn't penalize hits on defenseless players.\n\nThe revelation of Williams' pregame speech was also greeted with revulsion. ESPN NFL analyst and former Dallas Cowboys safety Darren Woodson said that much of Williams' speech was standard pregame rhetoric. According to Woodson, when Williams called for his men to \"attack the head\" of running back Frank Gore, he was saying that the 49ers' offense would be rendered ineffective if they managed to shut Gore down. However, Woodson felt that several parts of Williams' speech—particularly his calls to go after Crabtree's ACL and target Williams specifically because he had concussions in the past—went too far. His former teammate, NFL Network analyst Michael Irvin, said that he \"almost threw up\" when he heard Williams tell his men to go after Crabtree's ACL, saying that players are taught from youth football onward to \"never take out a man's knees.\" Fox Sports' Mark Kriegel argued that the tape proved Williams was \"woefully underpunished,\" especially since he made the speech after being alerted that the NFL had reopened its investigation. He called for Goodell to ban him from the league for life.\n\nNFL Network analyst Michael Lombardi wrote that the scandal happened in part because during Williams' previous stops as a defensive coordinator, the head coaches under which he worked—Fisher, Joe Gibbs and Payton—essentially ceded him complete authority over the defense. Lombardi claimed that as a result, Williams operated essentially as \"an independent contractor.\" Lombardi argued that such a situation is \"never fully sustainable,\" as it can easily lead to the head coach losing control.\n\nDespite the media outcry, an independent study speculated that Saints' players may have pretended to participate off the field but not put the tactics into action on the field. \"If the Saints tended to injure more players, then teams that played them would tend to list more injuries the following week. To test whether the Saints injured more players than a typical team, one need only compare the number of players added to injury reports after a Saints game to the league-wide average. Did the New Orleans Saints injure more players? The data-driven answer is a resounding 'no.' The Saints appear to have injured far fewer players over the 2009, 2010 and 2011 seasons. The numbers are striking.\"\n\n"}
{"id": "7134343", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7134343", "title": "Owney (dog)", "text": "Owney (dog)\n\nOwney (ca. 1887 – June 11, 1897), was a Border terrier adopted as the first unofficial postal mascot by the Albany, New York, post office about 1888. The Albany mail professionals recommended the dog to their Railway Mail Service colleagues, and he became a nationwide mascot for 9 years (1888–97). He traveled throughout the 48 contiguous United States and voyaged around the world traveling over 140,000 miles in his lifetime as a mascot of the Railway Post Office and the United States Postal Service. He is best known for being the subject of commemorative activities, including a 2011 U.S. postage stamp.\nOwney belonged to a clerk at the Albany post office who would often come with him to work. Owney seemed to love the smell of the mail bags and would sleep on the bags. The clerk quit the Albany post office but knew that Owney was happier at the post office with the mail bags.\n\nOwney usually slept on the mail bags and when they were moved, Owney went with them. He was considered to be good luck by postal railway clerks, since no train he ever rode on was in a wreck. He was a welcome addition in any railway post office; he was a faithful guardian of railway mail and the bags it was carried in, and would not allow anyone other than mail clerks to touch the bags.\n\nThis was an important duty and Owney was well-situated for it, as the Albany train station was a key division point on the New York Central railroad system, one of the two largest railroads in the U.S. at that time. Mail trains from Albany rolled eastward to Boston, south to New York City, and westward to Buffalo, Cleveland, Toledo, Chicago, and points further west. As a contemporary book recounted: \"The terrier 'Owney' travels from one end of the country to the other in the postal cars, tagged through, petted, talked to, looked out for, as a brother, almost. But sometimes, no matter what the attention, he suddenly departs for the south, the east, or the west, and is not seen again for months.\" In 1893 he was feared dead after having disappeared, but it turned out he was involved in an accident in Canada.\nAs Owney's trips grew longer, the postal clerks at Albany became concerned that the dog be identified, and, if necessary returned to them. They bought a dog collar with a metal tag that read: \"Owney, Post Office, Albany, New York\". To this collar, the various railway post offices that saw Owney added individual dog tags. The collar and tags made the mixed-breed terrier the unofficial mascot of the U.S. Railway Mail Service, and as shown by the 2011 postage stamp issued in his honor, his identifications became an essential element of his identity.\n\nOwney received tags everywhere he went, and as he moved they jingled like sleigh bells. He received from Winnona Kilbridge of the Los Angeles Kennel Club a medal for \"Best Traveled Dog\" of 1893. Owney received in 1894 from a Mr. William Winter Wagner of Chicago a \"Globe Trotter\" medal. His collection of tags grew so large that United States Postmaster General John Wanamaker gave him a coat to display them all. Wanamaker also announced that Owney was then the Official Mascot of the Rail Mail Service. It is said to be impossible to know how many dog tags and medals Owney received. Despite the jacket, the mass became impossible for the small dog to carry. Clerks would remove tags and forward them to Albany or Washington D.C. for safekeeping. One source suggests that 1,017 medals and tokens were bestowed upon the mascot. Some of these tags did not survive; the National Postal Museum currently has 372 Owney tags in its collections. Other Owney tokens, trinkets, and medals are also in the NPM collection and are displayed there.\n\nOne of Owney's services \"Above and Beyond the Call of Duty\" reported is when he stayed behind to protect a mail pouch that had accidentally fallen out of a wagon during a delivery route he was on. When the clerks returned to the main Post Office after the deliveries, not only was a bag of mail missing but so was Owney. They backtracked their steps and eventually found Owney lying on top of the mailbag. Owney guarded the mail pouch until someone from the Post Office showed up.\n\nOne of his more famous trips was to Montreal, Quebec, Canada. There the postmaster kept him in a kennel. A demand was sent to Albany, New York for payment for the $2.50 that was incurred in feeding him. The sum was collected, and Owney was sent back home.\n\nThe Universal Postal Union was created by treaty in 1874 to standardize the shipping and handling of international mail; adherence to this pact by an increasing number of countries around what was then called the \"civilized world\" made it possible to extend Owney's horizons a bit. In 1895, the terrier enjoyed an around-the-world trip, riding with mail bags aboard trains and steamships. Starting from Tacoma, Washington, on August 19, he traveled for four months throughout Asia and across Europe, before returning to New York City on December 23 and from thence to Albany. Upon his return during Christmas week, the \"Los Angeles Times\" reported that he visited Asia, North Africa, and the Middle East. Another report claimed the Emperor of Japan awarded the dog two passports and several medals bearing the Japanese coat of arms. Owney’s triumphant return to American shores was covered by newspapers nationwide. Owney became world famous after the trip, even though he broke no speed records in doing it.\n\nAs Owney aged, Post Office management came to believe that his traveling days were over. Mail clerk J. M. Elben, of St. Louis, agreed to take him in, and the influential Chicago manager of the Railway Mail Service, using insulting language to refer to the \"mongrel cur\", asked his employees not to allow him to ride on future mail trains. Owney had by this time traveled more than in his lifetime. Unnamed St. Louis letter carriers appear to have passively-aggressively resisted this executive guidance, and in summer 1897 Owney boarded a mail train one final time. The exact details of the incident which led to his death are unclear, but according to the National Postal Museum website, \"Owney rode the train one last time before he died.\" Newspapers around the country carried the story of Owney's death. They reported that Owney had been ill and had become aggressive in his old age. In June 1897, after allegedly attacking a postal clerk and a U.S. Marshal in Toledo, Ohio, Owney was shot and killed on the orders of the local postmaster. The Chicago Tribune termed it \"an execution\". The contemporary accounts suggest that a postal clerk in Toledo chained Owney to a post in the corner of a basement at a post office in Toledo, which was not his normal treatment. And that clerk called in a reporter for the local paper to get a story. Owney may not have been used to that treatment and that may have contributed to his aggression. Whatever the reason, it is not disputed that Owney was put down in Toledo on 11 June 1897.\n\nOwney's death made public that a gap existed between the workplace attitudes of U.S. postal clerks and their management, with the deceased dog serving as a focus of this gap. The 1890s were a foundational decade for the new discipline of scientific management, with consultants like Frederick Winslow Taylor seeking to help managers reduce what they saw as industrial inefficiencies by examining workers' \"wasted time\" and \"slacking\". Postal clerks used Owney's death, and the expressions of sadness contained in press obituaries in honor of the dog, to make a statement: \"Postal clerks refused to bury their beloved mascot. Clerks across the country asked that the dog receive the honor they considered he was due by being preserved and presented to the Post Office Department's headquarters.\" Owney's remains were preserved and sent for taxidermy. In 1904, Owney's effigy was displayed by the Postal Service at the St. Louis World's Fair. A commemorative silver spoon was commissioned by Cleveland, Ohio postal workers and fashioned by \"Webb C. Ball Co. Cleveland.O.\"\n\nOwney is the subject of an exhibit at the Smithsonian Museum. He was sent there in 1911, and has been called one of the museum's \"most interesting\" artifacts. His remains deteriorated over the intervening century, and were (along with associated artifacts) given an extensive makeover in 2011. One of the Smithsonian's employees opined the makeover a success, and called its culmination \"the big reveal\".\n\nOn July 27, 2011, the United States Postal Service issued a forever stamp honoring Owney. Artist Bill Bond said he wanted to render the dog \"in a spirited and lively\" presentation, and that he wound up working from the mounted remains, as numerous trips to dog parks left him uninspired. Owney was also honored locally at the Albany, New York post office. The stamp was also central to an augmented reality app for Windows, Apple iPhone, iPad 2 and iPod Touch.\n\nLike his contemporary Australian counterpart Bob the Railway Dog active from 1881–1894 he was the subject of poetry. One was from a clerk in Detroit:\n\nAnother was penned by a clerk in Minnesota:\n\nOwney has been the main character in five hard cover books, and one e-book published by the National Postal Museum (of the Smithsonian Institution) in 2012 titled, \"Owney: Tales from the Rails\", written by Jerry Rees with songs by Stephen Michael Schwartz and illustrations by Fred Cline. The book is narrated and songs are performed by Trace Adkins. http://www.npm.si.edu/owneyebook/\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "41121740", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=41121740", "title": "Peripheral nerve interface", "text": "Peripheral nerve interface\n\nA peripheral nerve interface is the bridge between the peripheral nervous system and a computer interface which serves as a bi‐directional information transducer recording and sending signals between the human body and a machine processor. Interfaces to the nervous system usually take the form of electrodes for stimulation and recording, though chemical stimulation and sensing are possible. Research in this area is focused on developing peripheral nerve interfaces for the restoration of function following disease or injury to minimize associated losses. Peripheral nerve interfaces also enable electrical stimulation and recording of the peripheral nervous system to study the form and function of the peripheral nervous system. Many researchers also focus in the area of neuroprosthesis, linking the human nervous system to bionics in order to mimic natural sensorimotor control and function. Successful implantation of peripheral nerve interfaces depend on a number of factors which include appropriate indication, perioperative testing, differentiated planning, and functional training. Typically microelectrode devices are implanted adjacent to, around or within the nerve trunk to establish contact with the peripheral nervous system. Different approaches may be used depending on the type of signal desired and attainable.\n\nThe primary purpose of a neural interface is to enable two-way exchange of information with the nervous system for a sustained period of time to enable effective and high density stimulation and recording. The peripheral nervous system (PNS) is responsible for relaying information from the brain and spinal cord to the extremities of the body and back. The function of a peripheral nerve interface is to assist the nervous system when peripheral nerve function is compromised. To supplement the roles of the nervous system, interfaces need to augment motor function as well as discern sensory information. The feasibility of peripheral nerve stimulation to achieve a desired motor output has been demonstrated and is one of the major driving forces for this area of research. Information throughout the nervous system is exchanged primarily through action potentials. These signals occur at varying numbers and intervals dependent on both the neuroanatomical and neurochemical make up of the individual and localized region. Information may be either introduced or read out by inducing or recovering action potentials from the body. Successful development and implementation of a peripheral nerve interface would allow for both the introduction of information to the nervous system, and extraction of information from the nervous system.\n\nProblems and limitations in peripheral nerve interfacing are both biophysical and biological in nature. These challenges include:\n\nPeripheral nerve interfaces are used for pain modulation, restoration of motor function following spinal cord injury or stroke, treatment of epilepsy by electrical stimulation of the vagus nerve, nerve stimulation to control micturition, occipital nerve stimulation for chronic migraines and to interface with neuroprosthetics. \nA wide variety of electrode designs have been researched, tested, and manufactured. These electrodes lie on a spectrum varying in degrees of invasiveness. Research in this area seeks to address issues centered around peripheral nerve/tissue damage, access to efferent and afferent signals, and selective recording/stimulation of nerve tissue. Ideally peripheral nerve interfaces are optimally designed to interface with biological constraints of peripheral nerve fibers, match the mechanical and electrical properties of the surrounding tissue, biocompatible with minimal immune response, high sensor resolution, are minimally invasive, and chronically stable with low signal-to-noise ratios. Strongest signals are recorded from nodes of ranvier. Peripheral nerve interfaces may be divided into extraneural and intrafascular categories.\n\nEpineurial electrodes are fabricated as longitudinal strips holding two or more contact sites to interface with peripheral nerves. These electrodes are placed on the nerve and secured by suturing to the epineurium. The suturing process requires delicate surgery and can be torn from the nerve if excessive motion creates tension. Since the electrode is sutured to the epineurium it is unlikely to damage the nerve trunk.\n\nHelicoidal electrodes are placed cirumjacent to the nerve and are made of flexible platinum ribbon in a helical design. This design allows the electrode to conform to the size and shape of the nerve in attempts to minimize mechanical trauma. The structural design causes low selectivity. Helicoidal electrodes are currently used for FES stimulation of the vagus nerve to control intractable epilepsy, sleep apnea, and to treat depressive syndromes.\n\nThe book electrode consists of a silicone rubber block with slots. Each slot contains three platinum foils which function as electrodes, anode electrodes and one cathode. The spinal roots of the nerve are placed into these slots and the slots are then covered with a flap made of silicone and fixed with silicone glue. This electrode is mostly used to interrupt reflex circuits of the dorsal sacral roots and to control bladder function. Book electrodes are still considered very bulky.\n"}

{"id": "23209509", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23209509", "title": "Philosophy of love", "text": "Philosophy of love\n\nPhilosophy of love is the field of social philosophy and ethics that attempts to explain the nature of love.\n\nThere are many different theories that attempt to explain what love is, and what function it serves. It would be very difficult to explain love to a hypothetical person who had not himself or herself experienced love or being loved. In fact, to such a person love would appear to be quite strange if not outright irrational behavior. Among the prevailing types of theories that attempt to account for the existence of love there are: psychological theories, the vast majority of which consider love to be very healthy behavior; there are evolutionary theories that hold that love is part of the process of natural selection; there are spiritual theories that may, for instance consider love to be a gift from God; there are also theories that consider love to be an unexplainable mystery, very much like a mystical experience.\n\nSetting aside Empedocles's view of Eros as the force binding the world together, the roots of the classical philosophy of love go back to Plato's \"Symposium\". Plato's Symposium digs deeper into the idea of love and bringing different interpretations and points of view in order to define love. From its riches, we may perhaps single out three main threads that would continue to reverberate through the centuries that followed.\n\nAristotle by contrast placed more emphasis on philia (friendship, affection) than on eros (love); and the dialectic of friendship and love would continue to be played out into and through the Renaissance, with Cicero for the Latins pointing out that \"it is love (\"amor\") from which the word 'friendship' (\"amicitia\") is derived\" Meanwhile, Lucretius, building on the work of Epicurus, had both praised the role of Venus as \"the guiding power of the universe\", and criticised those who become \"love-sick...life's best years squandered in sloth and debauchery\".\n\nAmong his love-sick targets, Catullus, along with others like Héloïse, would find himself summoned in the 12C to a Love's Assize. From the ranks of such figures, and perhaps also under Islamic influences, would emerge the concept of courtly love; and from that Petrarchism would form the rhetorical/philosophical foundations of romantic love for the early modern world.\n\nAlongside the passion for merging that marked Romantic love, a more sceptical French tradition can be traced from Stendhal onwards. Stendhal's theory of crystallization implied an imaginative readiness for love, which only needed a single trigger for the object to be imbued with every phantasised perfection. Proust went further, singling out absence, inaccessibility or jealousy as the necessary precipitants of love. Lacan would almost parody the tradition with his saying that \"love is giving something you haven't got to someone who doesn't exist\". A post-Lacanian like Luce Irigaray would then struggle to find room for love in a world that will \"reduce the other to the same...emphasizing eroticism to the detriment of love, under the cover of sexual liberation\".\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "55302726", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=55302726", "title": "Pokémon Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon", "text": "Pokémon Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon\n\nPokémon Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon are role-playing video games developed by Game Freak, published by The Pokémon Company and Nintendo for the Nintendo 3DS. The games were released worldwide on 17 November 2017. Announced in June 2017, the titles are enhanced versions of \"Pokémon Sun\" and \"Moon\" with a modified storyline, similar to previous \"upper versions\" like \"Yellow\", \"Crystal\", \"Emerald\", and \"Platinum\". The games are the second installments in the seventh generation of the main \"Pokémon\" RPGs for the Nintendo 3DS.\n\nThe games are set in the Hawaii-based Alola region with an alternate storyline and introduce several new characters, Pokémon, forms, and gameplay features. As with previous titles in the series, the game follows a young trainer in a Pokémon-training journey across the region. The games feature new forms of the Legendary Pokémon Necrozma as version mascots.\n\nThe game received positive reception, with critics praising the additional features included over \"Sun\" and \"Moon\". By the end of 2017, the game had sold over seven million copies worldwide.\n\nSimilar to previous games in the series, the games are role-playing video games with adventure elements. While set in an alternate Alola region, the mechanics and graphics remain largely the same as \"Pokémon Sun\" and \"Moon\", with the primary differences being its modified storyline now including the Ultra Recon Squad. The player character designs are different with the first games, though they remain customizable. \"Global Missions\", where players across the world work towards a collective goal, also made a return.\n\n\"Ultra Sun\" and \"Ultra Moon\" introduce new Ultra Beasts: Stakataka, Blacephalon and Poipole (which evolves into Naganadel). In addition, there are new forms for the Legendary Pokémon Necrozma, dubbed \"Dusk Mane\" and \"Dawn Wings\" forms, which are achieved by absorbing Legendary Pokémon Solgaleo and Lunala, respectively (similar to Black/White Kyurem from \"Black 2\" and \"White 2\" and Lusamine's mutated form from the original \"Sun\" and \"Moon\"). These forms act as cover mascots for the games. Also, a new Lycanroc form, Dusk Lycanroc, is added. Players can now travel around the Alola Region to collect Totem Stickers, which allow the player to receive a Totem Pokemon. Three new activities are added: Mantine Surf, which allows the player to surf across the region's seas; Alola Photo Club, which allows the player to take pictures of their player character with Pokémon in various poses; and Ultra Warp Ride, which allows the player to travel through varying Ultra Wormholes and encounter Ultra Beasts in their own worlds, as well as finding Legendary Pokémon from every game in the Pokémon franchise, and an increased chance for shiny pokemon to appear. New Z-Moves are available for multiple Pokémon, including Solgaleo, Lunala, Lycanroc and Mimikyu and Necrozma. A new upgrade to the Rotom Pokédex adds Roto-Loto, which allows the player to use boosts (akin to O-Powers from the previous generation), and Z-Rotom Power, which allows the player to use Z-Moves a maximum of twice per battle.\n\nThe game puts an emphasis on the Legendary Pokémon Necrozma which, in these versions, takes Lusamine's place as the primary antagonist of the games. Similar to the original versions, the game is set in the Alola region, based on the Hawaii islands. Although largely the same, the new games feature additional buildings and locations in comparison to the first installments. Multiple main characters featured in \"Sun\" and \"Moon\", such as Lusamine and her children, return in the game with significant changes. A new group, the Ultra Recon Squad, is introduced with differing characters in the two games. Ultra Megalopolis, a vast city where Necrozma has robbed all of its light sources, is located within Ultra Space and is accessible through the Ultra Wormholes.\n\nAnother antagonist group, Team Rainbow Rocket, is featured within a post-game story and includes all of the antagonist group leaders of the previous installments in the series, ranging from Giovanni (\"Pokémon Red\" and \"Blue\") to Lysandre (\"Pokémon X\" and \"Y\"). Legendary Pokémon from previous generations are also included.\n\nSimilar to \"Sun\" and \"Moon\", the player character is an eleven-year-old moving to Melemele Island in Alola with their mother. During their travels in Alola following the region's traditional island challenges, they complete trials which involve battles with powerful Pokémon (known as Totem Pokémon) and have numerous encounters with a villainous group known as Team Skull (led by a man named Guzma), a more charitable one known as the Aether Foundation (led by a woman named Lusamine), and a group called the Ultra Recon Squad, who came from a different dimension, the Ultra Megalopolis, where Necrozma has stolen its light. Much of the story revolves around two Legendary Pokémon: a Cosmog, nicknamed Nebby, who evolves into a Solgaleo (in \"Ultra Sun\") or Lunala (in \"Ultra Moon\"); and Necrozma, who attempts to seize the light from Alola.\n\nDuring the climax, Lusamine uses Nebby to create a wormhole to the Ultra Megalopolis, where she and Guzma attempt to fight Necrozma for the sake of the Ultra Recon Squad. However, they fail and are thrown back into their dimension later on in the story, with Necrozma following them. Necrozma fights Nebby, now a Solgaleo in Ultra Sun or Lunala in Ultra Moon, and wins. Necrozma then absorbs the Legendary Pokémon, becoming its Dusk Mane or Dawn Wings forms in the respective versions, and unleashes the Ultra Beasts upon Alola before fighting the player. After the player defeats it, Necrozma escapes into the Ultra Megalopolis, taking the world's light with it while the player, with the help of the Ultra Recon Squad, travels on a Lunala in Ultra Sun or Solgaleo in Ultra Moon through Ultra Space to reach the Ultra Megalopolis. There, the player battles Necrozma, this time in its true form (Ultra Necrozma), for the fate of the world and to rescue Nebby. The player defeats it once more, bringing light back to Alola.\n\nAs with traditional Pokémon games, the player has rivals: Hau, a friendly boy who joins the player during his journey, and Gladion, the estranged son of Lusamine. After completing these trials, the player proceeds to battle a newly established Elite Four and later defeats Hau to become Alola's first Pokémon League Champion.\n\nIn the post-game, the player encounters Team Rainbow Rocket, a dimensionally displaced group based on Team Rocket from \"Red,\" \"Blue\", and \"Yellow\". The aforementioned group seizes control of the Aether Foundation's headquarters and takes Lusamine hostage. The player stages a counterattack alongside a reformed Guzma, Lillie (who had been Nebby's caretaker before its evolution), and former Team Plasma leader Colress. Battling through villainous team leaders from the past games (Maxie and Archie from \"Ruby\", \"Sapphire\", and \"Emerald\"; Cyrus from \"Diamond\", \"Pearl\", and \"Platinum\", Lysandre from \"X\" and \"Y\", and Ghetsis from \"Black\", \"White\", \"Black 2\", and \"White 2\"), the player finally encounters Giovanni, who leads Team Rainbow Rocket and has a Mewtwo at his disposal. After the player's victory, Giovanni vanishes, wondering \"what new world shall [he] unleash [his] evil schemes upon\".\n\nShigeru Ohmori, one of the game's producers, stated that \"Ultra Sun\" and \"Ultra Moon\" were worked on by younger staff members while veterans worked on the upcoming \"Pokémon\" game for the Nintendo Switch, although some more experienced members, such as Shigeki Morimoto were assigned to it. He also stated that Game Freak was treating \"Ultra Sun\" and \"Ultra Moon\" as the \"culmination of our work with the 3DS system\". The development team of 80 was approximately half that of \"Pokémon Sun\" and \"Moon\" despite \"Ultra Sun\" and \"Ultra Moon\" having a script twice as long as \"Sun\" and \"Moon\". In a separate interview, Ohmori also described an idea to develop the \"Ultra\" installments formed late during the development of \"Sun and Moon\", with the titles intended to take advantage of the momentum gained by the Pokémon series following the massively successful release of the mobile game \"Pokémon Go\". Game director Kazumasa Iwao was in charge of the battle systems in \"Sun\" and \"Moon\".\n\nIn the post-game, the game included a tribute to former Nintendo CEO Satoru Iwata, mentioning his part in the development of \"Gold\" and \"Silver\". The game received its first patch in December 2017, fixing several bugs.\n\n\"Ultra Sun\" and \"Ultra Moon\" were revealed in a Pokémon Direct on 6 June 2017. Initial clerical errors in the Pokémon website showed that the games' release date for the Nintendo Switch were \"TBA\", although The Pokémon Company later clarified that the games were exclusive to the Nintendo 3DS.\n\nSimilar with its predecessor, the game's files were leaked in the internet before its official release, allowing software pirates to play the full game and data miners to find previously unannounced information including a new form for Necrozma, a new Ultra Beast, a new Mythical Pokémon and more.\n\nLess than a week before the game’s release, the mobile game \"Pokémon Go\" released an update which enables its players to customize their ingame avatars in the style of player characters from \"Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon\", marking the first time the app had been used to promote a main series game.\n\n\"Ultra Sun and Moon\" received \"generally favorable\" reviews according to review aggregator Metacritic. Casey Defreitas in her \"IGN\" review remarked that the games were \"full of smart improvements\". Other reviewers made similar points, with Kallie Plagge at \"GameSpot\" noting that despite similarities with \"Sun\" and \"Moon\", \"Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon make enough changes to stand apart as the definitive version of the seventh generation games\". On the other hand, Allegra Frank of \"Polygon\" criticized that the aforementioned changes were only present at the end, with the bulk of the gameplay being the same as its predecessor.\n\nPrior to release, both games were among the most highly anticipated titles for the Nintendo 3DS in 2017, according to Nielsen.\n\nFollowing release, the two games sold 1.2 million physical copies (excluding digital copies purchased from the Nintendo eShop) within the first three days in Japan. By the end of the year, the two games have sold over 2 million copies in Japan alone, making it the best-selling video game in the country for 2017. Sales from \"Ultra Sun\" and \"Ultra Moon\" allowed the cumulative sales of the franchise to exceed the 300 million copies milestone. According to Amazon, \"Ultra Sun\" and \"Ultra Moon\" were their seventh-best selling video game (or 25th for \"Ultra Sun\" and 28th for \"Ultra Moon\", when other video game-related products and console variations are accounted for) in 2017. As of September 30, 2018, total sales reached 7.96 million copies, making it the ninth–best selling 3DS game of all time.\n"}
{"id": "47677302", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=47677302", "title": "Post-traumatic stress disorder among athletes", "text": "Post-traumatic stress disorder among athletes\n\nPost Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is a cognitive disorder, which comes about after overcoming a traumatic event. It is a disease, which is extremely common to those participating in a sport at an elite level. When these athletes feel like they have come to the end of their journey as an athlete, and then try and slot themselves back into mainstream society, or after they have had to overcome a large hurdle within their chosen sport. These athletes develop feelings of alienation, depression, flashbacks or hyperarousal, and generally become evident after a couple of months after stopping or after the specific event has concluded.\n\nThere is a common sense of confusion between the difference of PTSD and a normal response to trauma. If an athlete injures himself or herself in a horrific way, it is normal for them to go through some adversity before overcoming the injury. They may develop small flashbacks, have bad dreams, or feel like they can't get the traumatic experience out of their mind, however, depending on the athlete’s mental ability, or how determined they are within their chosen sport, these symptoms can be lifted in time. Along with this, those athletes who are weaker mentally are the ones who tend to not be able to recover themselves and fall into the category of PTSD.\n\nThere are many therapies which can help reduce ones deterioration of PTSD, some including, psychologist sessions, various medications, art therapy or social engagement etc.\n\nThere are many sports which are fairly dangerous and involve threatening activities, especially during competition. There is always the chance of athletes getting injured while competing or during training which is exactly the reason why a psychologist would eventually encounter a patient who is a serious athlete and is in need of their assistance to rehabilitate their PTSD. Psychology as a general occupation has dated back to times of 1878, and around 1897 the first psychologist specialising in sport was established, by the name of Dr. Norman Triplett. Ever since, sport psychologists were helping different athletes, in the mental aspect of their game, in order for them to reach their optimum potential.\n\nPTSD became first evident due to those individuals who suffered extremely horrible experiences from war. Society noticed that those who took part in war, or had family members who took part in war, became distant from themselves and suffered terribly and found it very difficult to cope with the tragedies. Researchers took note of this and aimed to evaluate the situation and come to a conclusion with how to rehabilitate these victims, and while doing this they determined that these people had post-traumatic stress disorder.\n\nSoon after this new found disorder was established it made it far more clearer for those sport psychologists to treat their clients, as prior to the discovery of PTSD, sports psychologists, had to come up with alternative options to rehabilitate their clients who were experiencing PTSD. These psychologists often took their clients to play different sports, completely different from their own in aim to treat them in the most comfortable way possible.\n\nThere are many extreme and less extreme symptoms for PTSD, some which need medication to calm them down and others which can be solved in easier ways.\n\nsome of these include:\n\n- The athlete reliving traumatic events, or reliving peeks of their career - these events are relived through memories taking over through strong images within nightmares. these nightmares have such strong effects that they can cause athletes to have many physical and emotional reactions, like sweating, hot and cold flushes, racing heart, tightening of the chest, snowballing worries, obsessive thinking, compulsive behaviour, panic, or heart palpitations.\n\n- The athlete being more alert or annoyed - as athletes are experiencing these flashbacks, this can cause them to miss vital sleeping hours, which in turn, results in them having a lack of concentration and be irritated. Along with this athletes could also become startled easier and always be on the lookout for signs of danger.\n\n- Avoiding reminders of the event: the athlete, if is encountered with an injury to trigger their PTSD, they involuntary ignore and block off certain reminders of the event. These reminders could be people, activities, feelings associated with the event, or places which remind them of their accident; they do this to ensure no painful memories become stronger.\n\n- The athlete becomes emotionally numb: Once an athlete either retires from their sport or has a major injury, they can develop a lethargic lifestyle and lose interest in day-to-day activities, become cut off and detached from family and friends and become emotionally flat and numb.\n\nAlso, alongside these symptoms it is also very common for these specific symptoms to lead to other mental disorder such as depression, alcohol and drug use and anxiety disorders. Once an athlete reaches this stage it is then vital for them to seek assistance if they are not already doing so.]\n\n- The athlete could also suffer from Chronic traumatic encephalopathy too much head trauma from practice and the games just like Kansas City Chiefs player Jovan Belcher who killed himself and girlfriend on December 1, 2012\n\nThere are many available ways to treat people with PTSD, with most people resulting to psychologists as a preferred option, this is mainly because this is the most comfortable solution. Psychologists offer the option for an individual to open up, in an environment filled with positive vibes in order for them to determine the roots of their issues. There is also the option of art therapy, this was created by a man called Adrian Hill, in 1942 and is one of the earliest forms of treatment. This treatment is very beneficial to those with an open mind, it involves individuals to speak to a psychologist specialising in art, and the two both either paint, sculpt or any other forms of art. Another form of treatment, is treatment through medications; these medications aim to enhance their moments of happiness and reduce their moments of stress and anxiety. Some of these medications include fluoxetine, paroxetine, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), benzodiazepines and glucocorticoids. Obviously resulting to medications is a last resort, but unfortunately this type of therapy can be the matter of rehabilitating someone, meaning that the don’t have to live with these PTSD symptoms for the remainder of their life which is not a preferred way of life.\n\nThere are obviously many other treatment options, with cognitive behavioral therapy, interpersonal psychotherapy and Eye movement desensitization and reprocessing being some of the more popular options, all these involve an individual changing the way they think about their disease and experiences in life.\n\nAthletes may sometimes hide the severity of an injury in order to continue participating in their sport. This denial of the severity of an injury could lead to an early retirement in order for the athlete to refrain from sustaining permanent physical damage. Retirement at an earlier time than expected could lead an athlete to experience feelings such as alienation, distress or uselessness. The degree to which an athlete identifies with their sport may have an impact on their emotional response to a traumatic injury. Individuals who identify strongly as athletes may be at increased risk for psychopathology such as depression or PTSD after sustaining an injury.\n\nAn example of an athlete who experienced this is Tiaina Baul \"Junior\" Seau Jr.\nJunior Seau was an American NFL player, and is a typical example of an individual with PTSD. He was born on January 19, 1969 and died on May 2, 2012. Seau was a very beneficial asset to the teams that he played for; throughout his career he played for San Diego Chargers from 1990 to 2002, Miami Dolphins from 2003–2005 and New England Patriots from 2006–2009. He played linebacker for all three teams and had extensive experience in this role, despite many injuries throughout his career. After his career at the NFL he developed differences in his personality, due to brain injury; these changes consisted of impaired self-control and regulation, sensitive emotionally and also he was not able to socialise as he once was able to, which then led to alienation, something which was a strong opposite to his original personality. From there he developed insomnia and committed suicide via a self-inflicted gunshot to his heart.\n"}

He produced numerous paintings and drawings of London's topography during the first half of the 19th century. He was born in Canterbury in 1781 as the second son of Jacob Schnebbelie, a confectioner who later became a noted antiquarian draughtsman employed by the Society of Antiquaries of London.\n\nWhen Jacob died at the age of only 31, leaving his family in poverty, Robert took up his father's profession and continued his work drawing old buildings in London. He displayed artistic talent from an early age; in 1795 his mother Caroline wrote to John Bowyer Nichols, one of the editors of the \"Gentleman's Magazine\" and a benefactor of the family following Jacob's untimely death, to say that she was \"taking the liberty of sending you my son, Robert with a few Sketches of his own performance for your inspection\". She asked Nichols to consider employing her son \"if you think him Capable of copying any little matter for the Mag[azine]\".\n\nThe adult Schnebbelie occasionally exhibited works at the Royal Academy of Arts between 1803 and 1821. Engravings based on his drawings were widely published; he made the drawings for many of the plates in Robert Wilkinson's \"Londina Illustrata\" (1808–1825), David Hughson's \"Description of London\" and the \"Gentleman's Magazine\", among others.\n\nSchnebbelie was described posthumously by John Bowyer Nichols as being \"of rather weak intellect, and very capricious in the employment of his time.\" The death of his mother was said to have affected him to the point that he was \"scarcely able to take care of himself.\" He died in a state of acute poverty in Camden Town in 1847. Nichols wrote that \"to the horror of his few friends, his body was found in a lodging, almost destitute of furniture, after having been some days dead; and it was too evident that his death was hastened by privation.\" According to Samuel Redgrave, Schnebbelie died of starvation.\n\nViews of Schnebbelie's artistic merit vary; he has been described by the Canadian art historian Robert R. Wark as \"gifted\", and by Redgrave as \"a good draftsman\", though Martin Hardie is less generous, describing both Schnebbelies as \"painstaking but niggling in their draughtsmanship\" and their work as \"not often ris[ing] above a level of good hack work.\" A number of his works are on display as part of the collections of the Museum of London, the City of London Corporation's Guildhall Art Gallery and the Huntington Museum of Art, among other institutions.\n"}

Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex on Merritt Island, Florida. It is maintained by the Astronauts Memorial Foundation, whose offices are located in the NASA Center for Space Education next door to the Visitor Complex. The memorial was designed in 1987 by Holt Hinshaw Pfau Jones, and dedicated on May 9, 1991, to remember the lives of the men and women who have died in the various space programs of the United States, particularly those of NASA. The Astronauts Memorial has been designated by the U.S. Congress \"as the national memorial to astronauts who die in the line of duty\" (Joint Resolution 214, 1991).\n\nIn addition to 20 NASA career astronauts, the memorial includes the names of a U.S. Air Force X-15 test pilot, a U.S. Air Force officer who died while training for a then-classified military space program, a civilian spaceflight participant who died in the \"Challenger\" disaster, and an Israeli astronaut who was killed in the \"Columbia\" disaster.\n\nThe primary feature of the memorial is the Space Mirror, a flat expanse of polished black granite, 42.5 feet high by 50 feet wide, divided into 90 smaller panels. The names of the 24 astronauts who have died are scattered over the mirror, with names of astronauts who died in the same incident grouped on the same panel, or pairs of adjacent panels. The names are cut completely through the surface, exposing a translucent backing, and filled with translucent acrylic, which is then backlit with a combination of reflected sunlight (when available) and floodlights, causing the names to glow, and appear to float in a reflection of the sky.\n\nNear the Space Mirror is a granite wall, bearing pictures and brief biographies of those listed on the Mirror. The Space Mirror Memorial was designed by Wes Jones of Holt Hinshaw Pfau Jones and was commissioned after he won an international design competition.\n\nThe memorial as built incorporated motors and jackscrews to constantly track the sun across the sky in both pan and tilt axes. Parabolic reflectors on the back side of the mirror would then direct the sunlight through the acrylic panels to brilliantly illuminate the honorees' names with sunlight. Supplemental floodlights were used when the sun was inadequate.\n\nIn 1997, the tracking system failed, allowing part of the monument to strike a steel beam on an adjacent platform. Insurance paid US$375,000 for repair work, but later, the mechanism again ground to a halt, due to further problems with the slewing ring.\n\nEstimated repairs were on the order of US$700,000, and the Astronauts Memorial Foundation unanimously decided the money would be better spent on educational programs instead. The floodlights were repositioned and are kept burning 24 hours a day to illuminate the memorial.\n\nThe Space Mirror Memorial was to be partially funded by the sales of \"Space Shots\" trading cards. An agreement for 25% of Space Shots profits, in exchange for guaranteeing a $160,000 loan. A projected $400,000 was owed to the Foundation, which was never paid.\n\nThe Space Mirror Memorial and the Astronauts Memorial Foundation are funded in part by a specialty vehicle registration plate issued by the state of Florida. Called the \"Challenger\" plate, it was first issued in 1987, and was the first specialty plate issued by the state. The third edition, introduced in 2004, includes \"Columbia\" in the text, and is now termed the \"Challenger/Columbia\" plate.\nThe memorial cost US$6.2 million. License plates brought in $377,000 in 2009.\n\nOnly those killed during human spaceflight missions or during training for such missions sponsored by the United States are eligible for inclusion in the memorial. For a comprehensive list of space disasters, see List of space disasters.\n\nThe people honored on the memorial are:\n\n\nThe president of the Astronaut Memorial Foundation was Stephen Feldman from 1999 to 2012. He was paid $303,000 annually. This was criticized as being the highest among 100 of Brevard County non-profits. His salary represented 18.3 percent of the fund's $1.8 million budget in fiscal year 2009. He defended his salary by saying that he was the sole fundraiser and the chief financial officer for the foundation.\n\nThad Altman became President and CEO of the Astronauts Memorial Foundation in August 2012.

{"id": "1523424", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1523424", "title": "The Family of Man", "text": "The Family of Man\n\nThe Family of Man was an ambitious photography exhibition curated by Edward Steichen, the director of the Museum of Modern Art's (MoMA) Department of Photography. It was first shown in 1955 from January 24 to May 8 at the New York MoMA, then toured the world for eight years to record-breaking audience numbers.\n\nAccording to Steichen, the exhibition represented the \"culmination of his career.\"\n\nThe physical collection is archived and displayed at Clervaux Castle in Luxembourg (Edward Steichen's home country; he was born there in 1879 in Bivange). It was first presented there in 1994 after restoration of the prints.\n\nIn 2003 the \"Family of Man\" photographic collection was added to UNESCO's Memory of the World Register in recognition of its historical value.\n\nPart of the Museum of Modern Art's International Program the exhibition \"The Family of Man\" toured the world, making stops in thirty-seven countries on six continents. More than 9 million people viewed the exhibit, which is still in excess of the audience for any photographic exhibition since.The photographs included in the exhibition, which is still on display, focus on the commonalities that bind people and cultures around the world and the exhibition itself served as an expression of humanism in the decade following World War II.\n\nThe recently-formed United States Information Agency was instrumental in touring the photographs throughout the world in five different versions for seven years, under the auspices of the Museum of Modern Art International Program. Notably, it was not shown in Franco's Spain, in Vietnam, nor in China.\nCopy 5: Following a bilateral agreement between the USA and USSR, in 1959 the American National Exhibition was to be held in Moscow and the Russians were to have the use of New York City's Coliseum. This Moscow trade fair at Sokolniki Park was the scene of Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev and United States Vice President Richard Nixon's 'Kitchen Debate' over the relative merits of communism and capitalism. \"The Family of Man\" was a late inclusion not originally envisaged in MoMA's itinerary. With a grant to the Museum of $15,000 (less than half of what it requested) and funding from the plastics industry for the radical pre-fabricated translucent pavilion design to house it, a fifth copy of the show was salvaged from what was left from Beruit and Scandinavia showings, augmented with new prints. In Moscow, in the context of a trade show 'supermarket' meant to demonstrate lavish consumerism, and a multimedia display assembled by Charles Eames, the collection's overtones of peace and human brotherhood symbolized a lifting of the overhanging danger of an atomic war for Soviet citizens in the midst of the Cold War. This meaning seemed to be grasped especially by Russian students and intellectuals. Recognising the importance of the Moscow exhibition as \"the high spot of the project\" Steichen attended its opening and made copious photographs of the event.\n\nThe original prints from Copy 3 exhibited in the permanent collection at Clervaux Castle in Luxembourg have been restored twice, once in the 1990s and more comprehensively during a closure of the museum in the years 2010-2013.\n\nThe physical installation and layout of the Family of Man exhibition aimed to enable the visitor to read this as a photo-essay about human development and cycles of life affirming a common human identity and destiny against the contemporary Cold War threats of nuclear war.\n\nArchitect Paul Rudolph designed a series of temporary walls among the existing structural columns guiding visitors past the images, the effect of which he described as \"telling a story\", encouraging them to pause at those which attracted their attention. HIs layout was accommodated as closely as possible, using his display features, in the international venues which varied considerably from the original space at MoMA.\n\nOpen spaces within the layout required viewers to make their own decisions about their passage through the exhibition, and to gather to discuss it. The layout and placement of prints and their variation in size encouraged the bodily participation of the audience, who would have to bend to examine a small print displayed below eye level and then to step back to view a mural image, and to negotiate both narrow and expansive spaces.\n\nThe prints range in size from 24 x 36 cm to 300 x 400 cm and were made by his assistant Jack Jackson, in the case of the contemporary images, from the negative supplied to Steichen by each photographer. Also included were copies of historical images including a Matthew Brady civil war documentation and a Lewis Carroll portrait. Blown-up, often mural scale images, angled, floated or curved, some inset into other floor-to-ceiling prints, even displayed on the ceiling (a canted view of a silhouetted axeman and tree), on posts like finger-boards (in the final room), and the floor (for a Ring o' Roses series), were grouped together according to diverse themes. Repeated prints of Eugene Harris' portrait of a Peruvian flute-player forming a coda, or acting as 'Pied Piper' to the audience in the opinion of some reviewers, and according to Steichen himself, expressing \"a little bit of mischief, but much sweetness—that's the song of life.\" Lighting intensities varied throughout the series of ten rooms in order to set the mood.\n\nThe exhibition opened with an entrance archway papered with a blow-up of a crowd in London by Pat English framing Wyn Bullock's Chinese landscape of sunlight on water into which was inset an image of a truncated nude of a pregnant woman in an evocation of creation myths. Subjects then ranged in sequence from lovers, to childbirth, to household, and careers, then to death and on a topical portentous note, the hydrogen bomb (an image from LIFE magazine of the test detonation \"Mike,\" Operation Ivy, Enewetak Atoll, October 31, 1952) which was the only full-colour image; a room-filling backlit 1.8m x 2.43m Eastman transparency, replaced for the travelling version of the show with a different view of the same explosion in black and white.\n\nFinally, full cycle, visitors returned once more to children in a room in which the last picture was W. Eugene Smith's iconic 1946 \"A Walk to Paradise Garden\". As the centrepiece of the exhibition a hanging sculptural installation of photographs including Vito Fiorenza's Sicilian family group and Carl Mydans' of a Japanese family (both from nations which were recent enemies of the Allies in WW2), another from Bechuanaland by Nat Farbman and a rural family of the United States by Nina Leen, encouraged circulation to view double-sided prints and invited reflection on the universal nature of the family beyond cultural differences.\n\nPhotos were chosen according to their capacity to communicate a story, or a feeling, that contributed to the overarching narrative. Each grouping of images builds upon the next, creating an intricate story of human life. The design of the exhibition built on trade displays and Steichen's 1945 \"Power In The Pacific\" exhibition which was designed by George Kidder Smith for MoMA, Steichen's commissioning of Herbert Bayer for the presentation of his curatorship of other exhibitions and his own long history of initiation of innovative exhibits dating back to his association with Gallery 291 early in the century. In 1963 Steichen elaborated on the special opportunities offered by the exhibition format;\n\nIn the cinema and television, the image is revealed at a pace set by the director. In the exhibition gallery, the visitor sets his own pace. He can go forward and then retreat or hurry along according to his own impulse and mood as these are stimulated by the exhibition. In the creation of such an exhibition, resources are brought into play that are not available elsewhere. The contrast in scale of images, the shifting of focal points, the intriguing perspective of long- and short- range visibility with the images to come being glimpsed beyond the images at hand —all these permit the spectator an active participation that no other form of visual communication can give.\n\nThe enlarged prints by the multiple photographers were displayed without explanatory captions, and instead were intermingled with quotations by, among others, James Joyce, Thomas Paine, Lillian Smith, and William Shakespeare, chosen by photographer and social activist Dorothy Norman. Carl Sandburg, Steichen's brother-in-law, 1951 recipient of the Pulitzer Prize for Poetry and known for his biography of Abraham Lincoln, wrote an accompanying poetic commentary also displayed as text panels throughout the exhibition and included in the publication, of which the following are a sample;\n\nJerry Mason (1914–1991) contemporaneously edited and published a complimentary book of the exhibition through Ridge Press, formed for the purpose in 1955 in partnership with Fred Sammis. The book, which has never been out of print, was designed by Leo Lionni (May 5, 1910 – October 11, 1999) and reproduced in a variety of formats (most popularly a soft-cover volume) in the 1950s, and reprinted in large format for its 40th anniversary, and in its various editions has sold more than four million copies. Most images from the exhibition were reproduced with an introduction by Carl Sandburg, whose prologue reads, in part:\n\nThe first cry of a baby in Chicago, or Zamboango, in Amsterdam or Rangoon, has the same pitch and key, each saying, \"I am! I have come through! I belong! I am a member of the Family. Many the babies and grownup here from photographs made in sixty-eight nations round our planet Earth. You travel and see what the camera saw. The wonder of human mind, heart wit and instinct is here. You might catch yourself saying, 'I'm not a stranger here.' \n\nHowever, an omission from the book, highly significant and contrary to Steichen's stated pacifist aim, was the image of a hydrogen bomb test explosion; audiences of the time were highly sensitive to the threat of universal nuclear annihilation. In place of the huge colour transparency to which a space was devoted in the MoMA exhibition, and the black-and-white mural print that toured countries other than Japan, only this quotation of Bertrand Russell's anti-nuclear warning, in white type on a black page, appears in the book;\n[...] The best authorities are unanimous in saying that a war with hydrogen bombs is quite likely to put an end to the human race [...] There will be universal death — sudden for only a minority, but for the majority a slow torture of disease and disintegration.\n\nFor most purchasers, this was their first encounter with a book that gave priority to the photographic image over text.\n\nIn 2015, to mark the sixtieth anniversary of the inaugural exhibition, MoMA reissued the book as a hardcover edition, with the original jacket design from 1955 and duotone printing from new copies of all of the photographs.\n\nSteichen's stated objective was to draw attention, visually, to the universality of human experience and the role of photography in its documentation. The exhibition brought together 503 photos from 68 countries, the work of 273 photographers (163 of whom were Americans) which, with 70 European photographers, means that the ensemble represents a primarily Western viewpoint. That forty were women photographers can in some part be attributed to Joan Miller's contribution to the selection.\n\nDorothea Lange assisted her friend Edward Steichen in recruiting photographers using her FSA and \"Life\" connections who in turn promoted the project to their colleagues. In 1953 she circulated a letter; \"A Summons to Photographers All Over the World,\" calling on them to;\n\nshow Man to Man across the world. Here we hope to reveal by visual images Man's dreams and aspirations, his strength, his despair under evil. If photography can bring these things to life, this exhibition will be created in a spirit of passionate and devoted faith in Man. Nothing short of that will do.\nThe letter then listed topics that photographs might cover and these categories are reflected in the show's final arrangement. Lange's work features in the exhibition.\n\nSteichen and his team drew heavily on \"Life\" archives for the photographs used in the final exhibition, seventy-five by Abigail Solomon-Godeau's count, more than 20% of the total (111 out of 503), while some were obtained from other magazines; \"Vogue\" was represented by nine, \"Fortune\" (7), \"Argosy\" (seven, all by Homer Page), \"Ladies Home Journal\" (4); \"Popular Photography\" (3), and others \"Seventeen\", \"Glamour, Harper's Bazaar, Time,\" the British \"Picture Post\" and the French \"Du\", by one. From picture agencies American, Soviet, European and international, which also supplied the above magazines, came about 13% of the content, with Magnum represented by 43 of the pictures, Rapho with thirteen, Black Star with ten, Pix with seven, Sovfoto, which had three and Brackman with four, with around half a dozen other agencies represented by one photo.\n\nSteichen travelled internationally to collect images, through 11 European countries including France, Switzerland, Austria and Germany. In total, Steichen procured 300 images from European photographers, many from the humanist group, which were first shown in the \"Post-War European Photography\" exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art in 1953. Due to the incorporation of this body of work into the 1955 \"The Family of Man\" exhibition, \"Post-War European Photography\" is thought of as a preview to \"The Family of Man\". The international tour of the definitive 1955 exhibition was sponsored by the now defunct United States Information Agency, whose aim was to counter Cold War propaganda by creating a better world image of American policies and values.\n\nThough most photographers were represented by a single picture, some had several included; Robert Doisneau, Homer Page, Helen Levitt, Manuel Álvarez Bravo, Bill Brandt, Édouard Boubat, Harry Callahan (with two), Nat Farbman (five of Bechuanaland, and more from \"Life\"), Robert Frank (four), Bert Hardy and Robert Harrington (three). Steichen himself supplied five photos, while his assistant Wayne Miller had thirteen chosen; by far the greatest number.\n\nThe following lists all participating photographers (see original 1955 MoMA checklist):\n\nPhotography, said Steichen, \"communicates equally to everybody throughout the world. It is the only universal language we have, the only one requiring no translation.\" When the exhibition opened most reviewers loved the show, embracing the idea of this 'universal language', and lauding Steichen as a sort of author and the exhibition as a text or essay. Photographer Barbara Morgan, in Aperture, connected this concept with the show's universalising theme;\n\nIn comprehending the show the individual himself is also enlarged, for these photographs are not photographs only — they are also phantom images of our co-citizens; this woman into whose photographic eyes I now look is perhaps today weeding her family rice paddy, or boiling a fish in coconut milk. Can you look at the polygamist family group and imagine the different norms that make them live happily in their society which is so unlike — yet like — our own? Empathy with these hundreds of human beings truly expands our sense of values.\n\nRoland Barthes however was quick to criticise the exhibition as being an example of his concept of myth - the dramatization of an ideological message. In his book Mythologies, published in France a year after the exhibition in Paris in 1956, Barthes declared it to be a product of \"conventional humanism,\" a collection of photographs in which everyone lives and \"dies in the same way everywhere .\" \"Just showing pictures of people being born and dying tells us, literally, nothing.\"\n\nMany other noteworthy reactions, both positive and negative, have been proffered in social/cultural studies and as part of artistic and historical texts. The earliest critics of the show were, ironically, photographers, who felt that Steichen had downplayed individual talent and discouraged the public from accepting photography as art. The show was the subject of an entire issue of Aperture; \"The Controversial 'Family of Man'\" Walker Evans disdained its \"human familyhood [and] bogus heartfeeling\" Phoebe Lou Adams complained that \"If Mr. Steichen's well-intentioned spell doesn't work, it can only be because he has been so intent on [Mankind's] physical similarities that...he has utterly forgotten that a family quarrel can be as fierce as any other kind.\"\n\nSome critics complained that Steichen merely transposed the magazine photo-essay from page to museum wall; in 1955 Rollie McKenna likened the experience to a ride through a funhouse, while Russell Lynes in 1973 wrote that Family of Man \"was a vast photo-essay, a literary formula basically, with much of the emotional and visual quality provided by sheer bigness of the blow-ups and its rather sententious message sharpened by juxtaposition of opposites — wheat fields and landscapes of boulders, peasants and patricians, a sort of 'look at all these nice folks in all these strange places who belong to this family.'\" Jacob Deschin, photography critic for The New York Times, wrote, \"the show is essentially a picture story to support a concept and an editorial achievement rather than an exhibition of photography.\"\n\nFrom an optic of struggle, echoing Barthes, Susan Sontag in On Photography accused Steichen of sentimentalism and oversimplification: ' ... they wished, in the 1950s, to be consoled and distracted by a sentimental humanism. ... Steichen's choice of photographs assumes a human condition or a human nature shared by everybody.\" Directly quoting Barthes, without acknowledgement, she continues; \"By purporting to show that individuals are born, work, laugh, and die everywhere in the same way, \"The Family of Man\" denies the determining weight of history - of genuine and historically embedded differences, injustices, and conflicts.'\n\nOthers attacked the show as an attempt to paper over problems of race and class, including Christopher Phillips, John Berger, and Abigail Solomon-Godeau, who in her 2004 essay, while describing herself as among \"those who intellectually came of age as postmodernists, poststructuralists, feminists, Marxists, antihumanists, or, for that matter, atheists, this little essay of Barthes's efficiently demonstrated the problem — indeed the bad faith — of sentimental humanism\", concedes that \"as photography exhibitions go, it is perhaps the ultimate \"bad object\" for progressives or critical theorists\", but \"good to think with.\". Many of these critics, including Solomon-Godeau who openly admits it, it should be noted, had not viewed the exhibition but were working from the published catalogue which notably excludes the image of the atomic explosion.\n\nWhile \"The Family of Man\" was being exhibited there at its last venue in 1959 several pictures were torn down in Moscow by the Nigerian student Theophilus Neokonkwo. An Associated Press report of the time suggests that his actions were in a protest at colonialist attitudes to black races\n\nConversely, other critics defended the exhibition, referring to the political and cultural environment in which it was staged. Among these were Fred Turner, Eric J. Sandeen, Blake Stimson and Walter L. Hixson. Most recently, a compilation of essays by contemporary critics supported by newly translated writings contemporary to the exhibition's appearances collected and edited by Gerd Hurm, Anke Reitz and Shamoon Zamir presents a revised reading of Steichen's motivations and audience reactions, and a reassessment of the validity of Roland Barthes' influential criticism in \"La grande famille des hommes\" in his \"Mythologies\".\n\nIn the years since \"The Family of Man\", several exhibitions stemmed from projects directly inspired by Steichen's work and others were presented in opposition to it. Still others were alternative projects offering new thoughts on the themes and motifs presented in 1955. These serve to represent artists', photographers' and curators' responses to the exhibition beside those of the cultural critics, and to track the evolution of reactions as societies and their self-images change.\n\nFollowing \"The Family of Man\" by 10 years, the 1965 \"Weltausstellung der Fotographie\" (World Exhibition of Photography) was based on an idea by Karl Pawek and, supported by the German magazine \"Stern\", toured the world. It presented 555 photographs by 264 authors from 30 countries, outweighing the numbers in Steichen's exhibition. In the preface to the catalogue entitled 'Die humane Kamera' ('The human camera'), Heinrich Boll wrote: \"There are moments in which the meaning of a landscape and its breath become felt in a photograph. The portrayed person becomes familiar or a historical moment happens in front of the lens; a child in uniform, women who search the battlefield for their dead. They are moments in which crying is more than private as it becomes the crying of mankind. Secrets are not revealed, the secret about human existence becomes visible.\"\n\nThe exhibition, wrote Pawek, 'would like to keep alive the spirit of Edward Steichen's wonderful ideas and of his memorable collection, \"The Family of Man\".'. His exhibition posed the question 'Who is Man?' in 42 topics. It focussed on issues that were sublimated in \"The Family of Man\" by the idea of universal brotherhood between men and women of different races and cultures. Racism, which in Steichen's show was represented by a lynching scene (replaced in the European showings by an enlargement of the famous picture of the Nürnberg trial), is confronted in the \"Weltausstellung der Fotographie\" section VIII Das Missverständnis mit der Rasse (Misunderstandings about Race) by the black man in the photograph by Gordon Parks who seems to view from his window two scenes of attacks on black people (photographed by Charles Moore). Another photograph by Henri Leighton shows two children walking together in public holding hands, one black, one white. Though reference to the content of the older exhibition in the new is evident, the unifying idealism of The Family of Man is here replaced with a much more fragmented and sociological one. The exhibition met with rejection by the press and functionaries in the photographic profession in Germany and Switzerland, and was described by Fritz Kempe, board member of a prominent photo company, as \"tasty fodder to stimulate the aggressive instincts of semi—intellectual young men.\". Nevertheless, it went on to tour 261 art museums in 36 countries and was visited by 3,500,000 people.\n\nIn 1968, a second \"Weltausstellung der Fotographie\" (2nd World Exhibition of Photography) was devoted to images of women with 522 photographs from 85 countries by 236 photographers, of whom barely 10% were female (compared to 21% for \"The Family of Man\"), though there is evidence of the effect of feminist consciousness in images of men in domestic environments cleaning, cooking and tending babies. In his introduction, Karl Pawek writes: \"I had approached the first exhibition with my entire theological, philosophical and sociological equipment. 'What is Man'?; the question had to awaken ideological ideas. [...] I also operated from a philosophical point of view when presenting the[se] photos. As far as woman was concerned, the theme of the second exhibition, I knew nothing. There I was, without any philosophy about woman. Perhaps woman is not a philosophical theme. Perhaps there is only mankind, and woman is something unique and special? Thus I could only hold on to what was concrete in the pictures.\"\n\nUNESCO named 1977 The Year of Children and in response the book \"The Family of Children\" was dedicated to Steichen by editor Jerry Mason, and imitated the original catalogue in its layout, in the use of quotations and in the colours used on the cover. As for Steichen's show there was a call-out for imagery but 300,000 entries were received compared to the 4 million at the MoMA show, resulting in a selection of 377 photos by 218 participants from 70 countries.\n\nIndependent curator Marvin Heiferman's \"The Family of Man 1955·1984\" was a floor to ceiling collage of over 850 images and texts from magazines. newspapers and the art world shown in 1984 at PSI, The Institute for Art and Urban Resources Inc. (now MoMA PS1) Long Island City N.Y. Abigail Solomon-Godeau described it as a reexamination of the themes of the 1955 show and critique of Steichen's arrangement of them into a 'spectacle';\n\n...a grab bag of imagery and publicity ranging from baby food and sanitary napkin boxes to hard-core pornography, from detergent boxes to fashion photography, a cornucopia of consumer culture much of which, in one way or another, could be seen to engage the same themes purveyed in \"The Family of Man\". In a certain sense, Heifferman's [sic] riposte to Steichen's show made the useful connection between the spectacle of the exhibition and the spectacle of the commodity, suggesting that both must be understood within the framing context of late capitalism.\n\nIn 1990 the second Rotterdam Biennale lead exhibition was \"Oppositions: We are the world, you are the third world - Commitment and cultural identity in contemporary photography from Japan, Canada. Brazil, the Soviet Union and the Netherlands\" The cover of the catalogue imitates the layout and colour of the original but replaces the famous image of the little flute player by Eugene Harris with six images, four photographs of young women from different cultural backgrounds and two excerpts from paintings. In the exhibit scenes of a endangered ecology and the threat to cultural identity in the global village predominate, but there are intimations that nature and love may prevail, despite everything artificial that surrounds it, notably so in family life.\n\nIn 1992 the American critic and photographer Larry Fink published a collection of photographs under the heading of \"New Relations. The Family of Man Revisited\" in the Photography Center Quarterly. His approach updated Steichen's vision by integrating aspects of human existence which Steichen had omitted both because of his wish for coherence and of his innermost convictions. Fink provides only the following commentary: \"Rather than a fawn pretence to anthropological/sociologic analysis of the events depicted; rather than categorise and choose democratically for social relevance.| took the path of least resistance and most reward. I simply selected quality images with the belief that the path of strong visual energies would visit equal strong social presences\". He concludes:\n\nThe show is a compendium of visual hints. It is not an answer or even a full question, but cognitive clues...\n\nIn September/October 1996 the NGBK (Neue Gesellschaft fur Bildende kunst Berlin- New Society for the Visual Arts Berlin) in the context of 'Haus der Kulturen der Welt (HKW)' (House of World Cultures Berlin) conceived and organised the project \"family, nation, tribe, community: SHIFT\" with direct reference to the historical MoMA exhibition. In the catalogue, five authors; Ezra Stoller, Max Kozloff, Torsten Neuendorff, Bettina Allamoda and Jean Back analyse and comment on the historical model and twenty-two artists offer individual approaches around the following themes: Universalism/Separatism, Family/Anti-family, Individualisation, Common Strategies, Differences. The works are predominantly from artist photographers rather than photojournalists; Bettina Allamoda, Aziz + Cucher, Los Carpinteros, Alfredo Jaar, Mike Kelley, Edward and Nancy Reddin Kienholz, Lovett/Codagnone, Loring McAlpin, Christian Philipp Müller, Anna Petrie, Martha Rosler, Lisa Schmitz, STURTEVANT, Mitra Tabizian and Andy Golding, Wolfgang Tillmans, Danny Tisdale, Lincoln Tobler, and David Wojnarowicz reflect major contemporary issues: identity, the information crisis, the illusion of leisure, and ethics. In his introduction to the exhibition, Frank Wagner writes that Steichen had offered a vision of an harmonious, neat and highly structured world which, in reality, was complex, often unintelligible and even contradictory, but by contrast, this Berlin exhibition highlights 'first' and 'third' world tensions and is eager to concentrate on a variety of attitudes.\n\nThe following year Enrico Lunghi directed the exhibition \"The 90s: A Family of Man?: images of mankind in contemporary art\", held 02.10.-30.11.1997 in Luxembourg, Steichen's birthplace and by then the repository of the archive of a full version of his \"The Family of Man.\" Aside from their understanding of Steichen's efforts to present commonalities amongst the human race, curators Paul di Felice and Pierre Stiwer interpret Steichen's show as an effort to make content of Museum of Modern Art accessible to the public in an era when it was regarded as the elitist supporter of 'incomprehensible' abstract art. They point to their predecessor's success in having his show embraced by a record audience and emphasise that dissenting voices of criticism were heard only amongst 'intellectuals'. However, Steichen's success, they caution, was to manipulate the message of his selected imagery; 'After all,' they write, 'wasn't he the artistic director of Vogue and Vanity Fair ... ?'. They proclaim their desire to retain the exhibiting artists' 'autonomy' while not posing their work as the antithesis of Steichen's concept, but to respect, and echo, its arrangement while 'raising questions' as indicated by the question mark in their quotation of the original title. The exhibition and catalogue 'quote' from Steichen, setting pages of the book of his exhibition with their quotations around groupings of images (in monochrome) beside the works of contemporary artists (predominantly in colour) collected in themes used in the original, though the correlation fails for some contemporary ideas, which digital imaging, installation and montage works effectively convey. The thirty-five artists include Christian Boltanski, Nan Goldin, Inez van Lamsweerde, Orlan and Wolfgang Tillmans.\n\nThe Photographic Society of America (PSA) drew on their archives to stage \"Reconsidering The Family of Man\" during April and May 2012. They based the display on the concept of Steichen's original exhibit but concentrated on his sub-theme of the passage from birth to death. From the close to 5,000 photographs in the PSA collection, a selection of 50 was made for their show. One work in common with the original exhibition was Ansel Adams' \"Mount Williamson from Manzanar\" which in \"The Family of Man\" was presented at mural scale, while the PSA used a vintage,11 \"x 14\" Adams print from their collection, displaying it wilh a first edition copy of \"The Family of Man\" publication opened to a double-page spread of Adams photograph.\n\nAs part of the 2015-2016 France-Korea year, curators of the Centre national des arts plastiques (Cnap) and the Fonds Régional d’Art Contemporain of Aquitaine (Frac Aquitaine), Pascal Beausse (Cnap), Claire Jacquet (Frac Aquitaine), and Magali Nachtergael, Assistant Professor at the Sorbonne, collaborated to produce the exhibition \"The Family of the Invisibles\" at the Seoul Museum of Art (SeMA) and the Ilwoo Space in Seoul, from 5 April to 29 May 2016. The show was devoted to invisible and minority figures, their demands for identity, and the possibility of reconfiguring a politics of representation to the ideal of giving a place to each member of the human community as represented in more than 200 emblematic photographs. The works from the 1930s to 2016, drawn from the Cnap and Frac Aquitaine collections were selected on the principle of Roland Barthes' deconstruction identified by the curators in his \"Mythologies\" and in \"Camera Lucida\", the latter being treated as a visual manifesto for minorities. The exhibition was presented in the Seoul Museum of Art in four sections, culminating in provocative contemporary photography including the 2009 series of of deceased migrants wrapped in cloth in \"Les Proscrits\" ('The Outcasts') by Mathieu Pernot, and Sophie Calle’s 1986 \"Les Aveugles\" in which she photographed those things that her blind subjects described as the most beautiful. The “Prologue” of the exhibition at the Ilwoo Space, provided a critical and historical counterpoint. Texts by Pascal Beausse, Jacqueline Guittard, Claire Jacquet and Magali Nachtergael, Suejin Shin (Ilwoo Foundation) and Kyung-hwan Yeo (SeMA) were presented in a catalogue.\nThe permanent installation of the exhibition today at Chateau Clervaux in Luxembourg follows the layout of the inaugural exhibition at MoMA in order to recreate the original viewing experience, though necessarily it is adapted to the unique space of two floors of the restored Castle. Since the 2013 restoration it now incorporates a library (that includes some of the catalogues of the sequel exhibitions above) and contextualises \"The Family of Man\" with historical material and interpretation.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "3136621", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3136621", "title": "When Flanders Failed", "text": "When Flanders Failed\n\n\"When Flanders Failed\" is the third episode of \"The Simpsons\"<nowiki>'</nowiki> third season. It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on October 3, 1991. In the episode, Homer makes a wish for Ned Flanders's new left-handed store to go out of business. The wish comes true and gets the Flanders family into financial troubles. Ned is forced to sell his possessions, and Homer gleefully buys many of his things. When finding out that Ned's house is to be repossessed, Homer feels guilty and decides to get the store back in business by telling all the left-handed citizens about it. Meanwhile, Bart takes karate lessons but quits after discovering that it is not as interesting as he had expected it to be.\n\nThe episode was written by Jon Vitti and directed by Jim Reardon. It had an unusual amount of animation glitches because the animation studio was training a new group of animators. The episode features cultural references to playwright William Shakespeare and the film \"It's a Wonderful Life\". The title of the episode is a reference to the title of the poem \"In Flanders Fields\". Since airing, the episode has received mostly positive reviews from television critics. It acquired a Nielsen rating of 13.9, and was the highest-rated show on the Fox network the week it aired.\n\nNed invites the Simpson family to a barbecue party and announces his plans to open a store for left-handed people; The Leftorium. During the pulling of a wishbone, Homer, who has been constantly jealous of the material success of Ned and his family, wishes for The Leftorium to be a failure and go out of business. Homer frequently checks in on Ned to ensure that business is going poorly and is happy to see precisely that happening. When Homer sees left-handed citizens struggling with items made for right-handed people, he thinks about informing them about The Leftorium, but decides not to. Eventually the store does indeed close due to lack of business, plunging the Flanders' into debt and misery. Ned is forced to sell his possessions, and Homer gleefully buys many of Ned's things. Homer starts to regret what he did, but when he goes to return Ned's possessions, he finds Ned's house repossessed and the family living in their car. Homer wrestles with the guilt his wish has brought, and tells Ned to open the store for one final day. He then tells all the left-handed residents of Springfield about The Leftorium, and they all travel to the store and buy things. It is implied that the increase in customers helps Ned keep the store open and get his house back.\n\nIn a subplot, Bart begins taking karate lessons at Akira's karate school. On his first lesson, he finds that karate is quite boring, so he decides to skip each lesson in order to play video games at the mall arcade. Whenever he is questioned by his family and friends about the techniques he has learned, he refers to the \"Touch of Death\", an ability he saw in one of the arcade games he played. He proceeds to terrorize his sister Lisa into doing his will by threatening her with the technique. His actions catch up to him when Lisa prods him to defend her from the school bullies and reclaim her saxophone. He ends up being pantsed and hung by his underwear from the basketball hoop rim by the bullies, as Lisa (having reclaimed her saxophone) wistfully notes that sometimes two wrongs do make a right.\n\nThe episode was written by Jon Vitti and directed by Jim Reardon. It featured an unusual amount of animation glitches because the animation studio in Korea was training a new group of animators, and this episode was one of their first efforts. Show runner Mike Reiss said he will always remember it as the episode \"that came back animated with a thousand mistakes in it and was just a complete and utter mess.\" Reardon said there was \"literally a mistake in every other scene\" when the episode came back from Korea. Several scenes had to be re-animated in the United States because of these glitches, but according to Reardon, \"you can still see the lesser ones that got through, such as line quality problems particularly in the first act.\" Though it aired in season three, \"When Flanders Failed\" was produced during the previous season. It was recorded in spring 1991 when the previous season came to an end, and was scheduled to air in autumn that year. The staff therefore had more time to fix the glitches during the summer.\n\n\"When Flanders Failed\" features the second appearance of the character Akira, voiced by Hank Azaria. He was previously seen in the season two episode \"One Fish, Two Fish, Blowfish, Blue Fish\", where he is a waiter at a Japanese restaurant. It is revealed in this episode that the characters Ned Flanders, Moe Szyslak and Montgomery Burns are left-handed, just like \"The Simpsons\" creator Matt Groening. \"The Simpsons\" writer George Meyer came up with the idea of The Leftorium when the creators were trying to figure out what Ned's failed business would be. The inspiration came from a friend of Meyer's who opened a left-handed store that was quickly forced to close down due to lack of business.\n\nThe title of the episode is a reference to the title of the poem \"In Flanders Fields\". Homer watches the Canadian Football League Draft on television. \"The Simpsons\" writers Jay Kogen, Wallace Wolodarsky, and John Swartzwelder appear on the draft list. Akira's school is located in the mall next to Shakespeare's Fried Chicken, a reference to the English poet and playwright William Shakespeare. Akira gives Bart's karate class the ancient Chinese military treatise \"The Art of War\" by Sun Tzu. Richard Sakai is seen in one of the crowd shots at The Leftorium at the end of the episode.\n\nIn its original American broadcast, \"When Flanders Failed\" finished 29th in the ratings for the week of September 30 – October 6, 1991, with a Nielsen rating of 13.9, equivalent to approximately 12.8 million viewing households. It was the highest-rated show on the Fox network that week.\n\nIn December 2002, \"When Flanders Failed\" was utilized in a Roanoke Presbyterian Church Sunday School class, to stimulate a discussion among both children and adults, about why unfortunate things happen to good people. Phil Brown, the teacher of the class, said the reason they used episodes of \"The Simpsons\" was \"to get something that would get the kids excited and be more than just a traditional Sunday School lecture series.\"\n\nSince airing, the episode has received mostly positive reviews from television critics. Kirk Baird of the \"Las Vegas Sun\" named it the fifth best episode of \"The Simpsons\", and \"Central Michigan Life\" called it an \"instant classic\".\n\nPete Oliva of \"North Texas Daily\" said the episode \"proves that it is possible to laugh and cry at the same time without being able to control either response.\" Bill Gibron of DVD Verdict said \"When Flanders Failed\" shows that even if \"The Simpsons\" is not dealing with famous celebrities or \"high profile places\", the writers can still \"wring uproarious comedy out of their cast of regulars. Flanders is a special creation in the canon of humor, a regular guy who is funny because of how hyper-normal he is compared to his Neanderthal neighbors. The focus on people who are left-handed, and the whole idea of being a lefty, is an unusual basis for a television show. But then again, nothing about \"The Simpsons\" is ever common.\" Hock Guan Teh of DVD Town also praised the writers, stating that they \"are able to craft a downtrodden tale for the perpetually clueless Flanders family that serves to illustrate how dark emotions can eventually be overcome by Homer's guilt. A memorable episode.\" Niel Harvey of \"The Roanoke Times\" called \"When Flanders Failed\" a \"classic bit of Simpsonia.\" The episode's reference to \"It's a Wonderful Life \" was named the 26th greatest film reference in the history of the show by \"Total Film\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s Nathan Ditum.\n\nNate Meyers of Digitally Obsessed gave the episode a 3.5/5 rating and commented that \"perhaps it is not profound in its examination of jealousy causing people to behave irrationally, but it handles the topic in a serious manner while not compromising the show's humor. The side story with Bart stems from the era of the series when Bart was the big star, but it still has some funny bits.\" DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson wrote: \"Mean Homer equals Funny Homer, so 'When Flanders Failed' presents an above average show. He seems unusually crude here, which makes him amusing. The subplot with Bart and his karate class also adds good material, especially when he threatens to turn the 'Touch of Death' on Lisa. Another sappy finish slightly mars this one, but it remains generally solid.\" Kimberly Potts of AOL named it tenth best episode of the show and commented: \"Schadenfreude is the theme of this tight episode about Homer's joy at the failure of Flanders' Leftorium store. There are few times Homer is more shamelessly smug than he was while imitating Flanders and using Ned's yard sale grill, and we haven't even mentioned Bart's 'Touch of Death' subplot.\" \"Winston-Salem Journal\"'s Tim Clodfelter called it an \"outstanding\" episode.\n\n"}
