{"id": "146160", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=146160", "title": "A Nice Place to Visit", "text": "A Nice Place to Visit\n\n\"A Nice Place to Visit\" is episode 28 of the American television anthology series \"The Twilight Zone\". The episode first aired on CBS on April 15, 1960. The title comes from the saying, \"A nice place to visit, but I wouldn't want to live there.\"\n\nIn 1965, a slightly modified version of this story was broadcast on the radio program \"Theater Five\". \"The Land of Milk and Honey\", episode number 154, retained all of the important aspects of this episode, including the innuendos and the surprise ending. On November 14, 1935, the radio program \"The Fleischmann's Yeast Hour\" hosted by Rudy Vallee broadcast a play titled \"The Other Place\" starring Colin Clive and Leo G. Carroll. It was written by John Balderston and dealt with a similar theme.\n\nAfter robbing a pawn shop, Henry Francis \"Rocky\" Valentine (Larry Blyden) is shot by a police officer as he tries to flee. He wakes up to find himself seemingly unharmed by the encounter as a genial elderly man named Pip (Sebastian Cabot) greets him. Pip explains that he has been instructed to guide Rocky and give him whatever he desires. Rocky becomes suspicious, thinking that Pip is trying to swindle him, but Pip proves to have detailed information on Rocky's tastes and hobbies. Rocky demands that Pip hand over his wallet; Pip says that he does not carry one, but gives Rocky $700 directly from his pocket and says that he can provide as much money as Rocky wants.\n\nThinking that Pip is trying to entice him to commit a crime, Rocky holds him at gunpoint as the two travel to a luxurious apartment. Pip explains that the apartment and everything in it are free, and Rocky starts to relax. However, his suspicions rise up again when a meal is brought in, and demands that Pip taste it first to prove it isn't poisoned. When Pip demurs, claiming he hasn't eaten for centuries, Rocky shoots him in the head, but sees that the bullets have no effect. Rocky realizes that he is dead, and he believes that he is in Heaven and Pip is his guardian angel.\n\nRocky visits a casino, winning every bet he makes as beautiful girls gather around him, and enjoys being able to torment a policeman after Pip shrinks him. Later, Rocky asks Pip if he can see some of his old friends who have also died, but Pip says that this world is for Rocky alone. Except for the two men, no one in it is real. When Rocky wonders what good deeds he could have done to gain entrance to Heaven, Pip takes him to visit the Hall of Records. Rocky looks through his own file and discovers that it only contains a list of his sins, but decides not to worry about it because God apparently has no problem with him being in Heaven.\n\nOne month later, Rocky has become bored with having his whims instantly satisfied. He calls Pip and asks for a challenge in which he might run the risk of losing. Pip offers to set up a bank robbery, but Rocky abandons the idea, saying that a pre-planned outcome would take the fun out of the crime. He then tells Pip that he is tired of Heaven and wants to go to \"the other place,\" to which Pip retorts, \"Heaven? Whatever gave you the idea you were in Heaven, Mr. Valentine? This \"is\" the other place!\" Horrified, Rocky tries in vain to open the now-locked apartment door and escape his \"paradise\" as Pip laughs malevolently at his torment.\n\nMickey Rooney was the first choice to play Valentine. In a memo to Rod Serling, Charles Beaumont suggested, should Rooney not be available, that Serling consider playing the part. Serling declined and Rooney became unavailable. (He guest starred in a later episode.)\n\nGuest star Cabot had to bleach his hair white for the role; it took three months for the actor's hair to return to its original dark color.\n\nOne version of this episode has Valentine throwing an apple at a table which changes into a pool table – although another version has this scene cut.\n\n\"A Nice Place to Visit\" was singled out for its brazen sexual innuendo. Program Practices requested that Valentine not refer to a girl as \"a broad [...] really stacked\", even though the crudity was essential to establishing the unsavory qualities of the character. Nor could the protagonist refer to a party as \"a ball\" because that word had more than one meaning. In another sequence, a voluptuous young lady tends to Valentine's every need, then says \"is there anything else I can do for you?\" CBS's comment: \"Please be certain that the girl's third speech be delivered in a sweet manner, as described.\"\n\nElliott Murphy alludes to this episode in the song \"Sacrifice\" from his album \"Unreal City\". The lyrics to the song's bridge are as follows: \"On TV was a petty thief shot by the police, he came to in Las Vegas in a penthouse suite, he had a magic butler gave him all that he desired, a feast of wine and women 'til his passions were expired. He couldn't understand why a crook like him had died and gone to heaven when his life was full of sin, and when he shot pool and every ball quickly fell, he saw his butler was the devil and the penthouse was in hell.\"\n\nThe unreleased They Might Be Giants song \"Hell Hotel\" is based on \"A Nice Place to Visit\". According to producer Bill Krauss, the song references the episode's plot and lead actor Sebastian Cabot.\n\nDonald Trump has said that this episode of \"The Twilight Zone\" inspired his philosophy of success, commenting, \"I fight hard for victory, and I think I enjoy it as much as I ever did. But I realize that maybe new victories won't be the same as the first couple.\"\n\nThis episode is referenced in two episodes of \"The Sopranos\". In \"Chasing It\", this episode is explicitly mentioned when it is described to Tony Soprano. In the episode \"Kennedy and Heidi\", Tony Soprano visits Las Vegas and basically lives the episode, having an unprecedented string of success with gambling, drugs, and women.\n\nIn the \"Futurama\" episode \"I Dated a Robot\", a parody of the \"Twilight Zone\" called \"The Scary Door\" mimics this episode by having a gambler who always wins. He realizes quickly that he must be in hell. A character similar to Pip arrives, only for the episode to suddenly shift to the plots of \"Nightmare at 20,000 Feet\" and \"The Man in the Bottle\".\n\nThe plot of the 1979 pornographic film \"For the Love of Pleasure,\" starring Jamie Gillis and Annette Haven, is a broad rewrite of this episode.\n\nThe plot of \"The Good Place\" is essentially a greatly expanded version of this episode.\n\n\n"}

Bello and two companions had to complete the circuit from Lo Espejo to Culitrín, to Cartagena, and back to Lo Espejo, in the central region of Chile, in order to pass the exam. The total distance of the flight was 111 miles, and should have taken two hours to complete.\n\nOn the first attempt, the aviators had to return to base due to near-zero visibility caused by heavy fog. Bello damaged his aircraft during the landing, and switched to an Sánchez-Besa biplane (tail number 13, nicknamed \"Manuel Rodríguez\") for the second attempt. He took off together with one companion and the instructor, who had to make an emergency landing for refueling. Nevertheless, Bello continued his route and was lost among the clouds.\n\nSearch efforts were initiated the very day Bello disappeared. Several people claimed to have seen the aircraft land or crash, but these sightings were unsubstantiated. Various theories proposed at the time suggested that Bello had crashed into the sea or that the wrecked craft would be found in a mountain pass. Several expeditions were launched to locate a crash site, including one as recently as 1988, but no traces were found either of Lieutenant Bello or of the plane he was piloting.\n\nOn 28 November 2007 an expedition set out for the commune of San Antonio, Chile. Two metal fragments belonging to an aircraft were found in the Cuncumén hills.\n\nJaime González Colville, of the Chilean Academy of History, considered it very unlikely that the remains of Lieutenant Bello should be found near Cuncumén.\n\n\n"}

February 16, 2010), was an American character actor, film director, editor, writer, and human rights activist.\n\nAndrew Koenig was born August 17, 1968, the son of \"\" actor Walter Koenig and Judy Levitt.\n\nWriter Harlan Ellison spoke of the young Koenig – by his given first name of Josh – as being the inspiration for his story \"Jeffty Is Five\".\n\nThe story went on to win the 1977 Nebula Award and the 1978 Hugo Award for Best Short Story.\n\nFrom 1985 to 1989, Koenig played a recurring role as Richard \"Boner\" Stabone, best friend to Kirk Cameron's character Mike Seaver in the first four seasons of the ABC sitcom \"Growing Pains\". During the same period, he guest starred on episodes of the sitcoms \"My Sister Sam\" and \"My Two Dads\" as well as the drama \"21 Jump Street\". In the early 1990s he provided a voice for the animated series \"\" as and Night Creeper Leader, and had a minor role as Tumak in the 1993 \"\" episode \"\".\n\nKoenig played the role of The Joker in the 2003 fan film \"\".\n\nOnstage, he starred as the M.C. in the 2007 interactive theater play \"The Boomerang Kid\" and performed with the improv group Charles Whitman Reilly and Friends.\n\nThough he continued his performing career in the 2006 independent film \"The Theory of Everything\" (2006), Koenig worked increasingly behind the scenes. He wrote, produced and/or directed the shorts \"Good Boy\" (2003) and \"Woman in a Green Dress\" and \"Instinct vs. Reason\" (2004). He worked as an editor on a number of films and was a video producer for the podcast \"Never Not Funny\" (2006–2010). His final role was in the film \"DaZe: Vol. Too — NonSeNse\", in post-production at the time of his death, with Koenig portraying the role of Vice Chancellor.\n\nKoenig, a vegan, traveled to Burma in July 2007 and visited Burmese refugee camps in Thailand with his father as part of the U.S. Campaign for Burma. The following January, he protested the Communist Party of China's political and financial support of the military dictatorship in Burma during the 119th Tournament of Roses in Pasadena, California; after a pre-parade human rights march agreed to by parade officials was allegedly stifled by them, he entered the parade and stood in front of a Chinese float promoting the 2008 Beijing Olympics. Koenig, who carried a sign reading \"China: Free Burma\" in both English and Chinese, was arrested and briefly held for his act of civil disobedience. Koenig's defense attorney was Bill Paparian, a fellow protester and former mayor of Pasadena.\n\n\"China sits on the UN Security Council and they have refused to condemn Burma. China purchases gas from Burma and sells them weapons that the military uses on the Burmese people. So they are really quite complicit, and that was the whole point of protesting the China float,\" Koenig explained. Koenig also noted the Chinese government's implicit support of genocidal forces in Sudan, sweatshops and tainted export products, saying of the float, \"China is putting on a good face because of the Olympics, but [it's time to] send a message to the Chinese government that they have to not just change their face, but change the way they do things.\" \"The Pasadena Weekly\" quoted Koenig as stating, \"Their free speech rights have been totally censored. As a country with a Constitution and a Bill of Rights, we need to continue to support and enforce ours, and [use it to] recognize the rights of human beings all over the world.\"\n\nKoenig was last seen in Vancouver, British Columbia, on February 14, 2010 and missed a scheduled flight on February 16, which was the last day he used his cell phone or conducted any banking. On February 25, a group of friends and family found him hanging from a tree in Vancouver's Stanley Park; he had apparently hanged himself.\n\nHis ashes were interred in a niche in the Garden of Memory section of Hollywood Forever Cemetery in Hollywood, California.\n\n"}

In the shooting, two students were killed and 13 others were wounded. Williams is currently serving life in prison with the possibility of parole after 50 years.\n\nKnown by his family as \"Andrew\" or \"Andy\" for short and born in Frederick, Maryland on February 8, 1986, he was the first born child of Jeff and Linda Williams. Andy has one half brother, Michael. In the summer of 2000, Jeff and Linda separated. Jeff and Andy moved to California in the fall. Williams attended Santana High School in Santee, California, where he was bullied by fellow students. He began to spend time with a crowd of skateboarders. Williams was accepted within this peer group; however, at times these individuals also bullied him.\n\nWeeks before the shooting, Williams attempted to speak with a school counselor, but was instructed to return to class because the office was full at the time. As the semester unfolded and the abuse continued, friends came to believe that Williams had just reached a tipping point and mentioned he \"didn't want to live anymore\", which resulted in more name-calling and threats of bullying. By early 2001, Williams seemed to believe that his problems would not resolve themselves. The Friday before the shooting, Williams and classmates reported that his drama teacher humiliated him in front of the class during an acting exercise, which he perceived as an abusive setup. Williams spoke on two occasions of his plan to \"pull a Columbine\" at Santana High School, but no reports were ever made of these threats to the school. He also made plans to get on top of the school's roof so that he could hit people more easily. The friends he informed were asked to leave the school. The first occasion was a week before the shooting, the second during the weekend prior to March 5.\n\nHe took his father's Arminius .22 caliber long-rifle double action revolver from the locked gun cabinet in their apartment. After his arrest, he told investigators that he was \"tired of being bullied.\" On the way to juvenile hall, Williams said that he did it because he was dared to by his friends.\n\nOn Monday, March 5, 2001 at 9:20 a.m., 15-year-old Williams entered a boys' bathroom at Santana High School with a loaded .22-caliber revolver taken from his father’s locked gun cabinet and fatally shot a freshman. He then left the bathroom and began firing the revolver indiscriminately at other students, killing another. According to one witness, Williams repeatedly walked out of the bathroom, fired shots, then went back into the bathroom. The scene soon turned chaotic as students and teachers ducked or scrambled to safety. Minutes later the school was on lock-down. Williams reloaded his revolver at least once. A student teacher, Tim Estes, and Campus Security Supervisor, Peter Ruiz, walked into the bathroom to investigate what Ruiz thought may be the sound of firecrackers. Upon entering the restroom Ruiz was shot once in the shoulder by Williams. As Estes and Ruiz turned to run, \nRuiz was hit in the back by two more bullets and Estes was hit in the back by a bullet that exited through his abdomen. Williams was often seen smiling throughout the entire shooting. Two off-duty police officers who were visiting the school were alerted to the shooting; however, they were at different ends of the school. One of them approached the bathroom and called for backup. Police officers quickly arrived and charged the bathroom; they discovered Williams kneeling on the floor with the weapon in his hands. He wanted to kill himself, but was unable to. He told officers that he was by himself. In the end he shot 15 people, two of whom died.\n\nWilliams surrendered and was taken into custody. The two students that were killed were 14-year-old Bryan Zuckor and 17-year-old Randy Gordon. Eleven students and two school supervisors suffered gunshot wounds and were treated at either University of California, San Diego Medical Center or Children's Hospital. The San Diego SWAT team was called to \"assess and clear\" the scene of the shooting.\n\nIn Washington, the President of the United States, George W. Bush, offered his condolences \"to the teachers and the children whose lives have been turned upside-down right now.\"\nBush called the shooting \"a disgraceful act of cowardice,\" adding, \"When America teaches our children right from wrong and teaches values that respect life in our country, we'll be better off.\" But, he said, \"First things are first. And our prayers go out to the families that lost a child today.\"\n\nCalifornia Governor Gray Davis also said he was \"shocked and deeply saddened\" by the shooting. Davis' wife Sharon is a Santana High School graduate.\n\nThe nu metal band Linkin Park, whom Williams was a fan of, were seen as an influence to Williams in shooting. They released a statement saying \"Like everyone else, we are extremely saddened by these events and our hearts go out to the families and friends to the victims.\" Williams had written a note to his father prior to the shooting: \"I tried so hard, and got so far, but in the end it doesn't really matter.\" The line was an excerpt from the band's song In the End.\n\nThe Christian rock band P.O.D. wrote their song \"Youth of the Nation\" after the band was on their way to recording their then upcoming studio album, \"Satellite\", where they were stopped in traffic during the incident. Guitarist Marcos Curiel was interviewed in 2008 and described the event as so:\n\nEver since the incident, Santana High has hired police to come and watch over the school. The school also holds an event for the students on the anniversary of the shooting.\n\nOn June 20, 2002, Williams pleaded guilty to all charges against him in an effort to avoid trial. On August 15, 2002, a California judge sentenced Williams, as an adult, to 50 years to life in prison, and ordered him to serve his time in the Youth Offender Program at CCI, Tehachapi (since closed) until his 18th birthday, at which time he would be transferred to an adult prison. Williams was given credit for the 529 days that he had served in juvenile hall, fined $10,000 and ordered to pay restitution to the Victims Restitution Fund. At his sentencing, Williams apologized and expressed remorse for his actions. On March 1, 2004, he was transferred to an adult prison.\n\nIn an interview with \"NOVA: Mind of a Rampage Killer\", Williams admitted to being suicidal for several months before the shooting. He described his 15-year-old life as tumultuous, describing the pain of his parent's recent divorce, his jolting move across the country from Maryland to California, and death of a friend. His description of his mental state was \"Numb\", adding that he didn't realize people would die, but he wanted to \"Make a lot of noise and then the cops would show up.\" He admitted that his real plan was to commit suicide by cop, however he \"changed his mind at the last minute, dropped his revolver and surrendered.\"\n\nCurrently there are grass-root efforts to have Williams' sentence reduced. His supporters argue that the judge was too harsh in sentencing Williams as an adult and did not take into consideration Williams' age at the time of his offense. They would like to see Williams get a retrial, but as a juvenile, which would have meant confinement by the California Youth Authority until age 25. The California State Attorney General's office handled a total of six appeals filed by Williams supporters, four to the Court of Appeals and two to the California State Supreme Court. The district court denied his petition in September 2010 and the case is now on appeal to the 9th Circuit, according to the California Attorney General's Office.\n\nWilliams is currently incarcerated at Valley State Prison in Chowchilla, California. He will be eligible for parole in March 2025. He will be 39 years old.\n\n"}

{"id": "303320", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=303320", "title": "Elaine race riot", "text": "Elaine race riot\n\nThe Elaine massacre, began on September 30–October 1, 1919 at Hoop Spur in the vicinity of Elaine in rural Phillips County, Arkansas. With an estimated 100 to 237 blacks killed, along with five white men, it is considered the deadliest race riot in the state and one of the deadliest racial conflicts in all of United States history.\n\nBecause of the widespread white mob attacks on blacks during this period of racial terrorism of black citizens, in 2015 the Equal Justice Initiative of Montgomery, Alabama classified the black deaths as lynchings in their report on lynching of African Americans in the South. Most historians classify the race riot as a different kind of criminal action than the targeted nature of lynchings of one or a few persons.\n\nLocated in the Arkansas Delta, Phillips County had been historically developed for cotton plantations, and was worked by African-American slaves before the Civil War. In the early 20th century the population was still overwhelmingly black, as most freedmen and their descendants had stayed as farm workers and sharecroppers. African Americans outnumbered whites in the area around Elaine by a ten-to-one ratio, and by three-to-one in the county overall. White landowners controlled the economy, selling cotton on their own schedule, running high-priced plantation stores where farmers had to buy seed and supplies, and settling accounts with sharecroppers in lump sums, without listing items.\n\nThe Progressive Farmers and Household Union of America had organized chapters in the Elaine area in 1918-19. On September 29, representatives met with about 100 black farmers at a church near Elaine to discuss how to obtain fairer settlements from landowners. Whites had resisted union organizing by the farmers and often spied on or disrupted such meetings. In a confrontation at the church, a county deputy was shot and killed, and another white man wounded.\n\nThe county sheriff organized a posse, and whites gathered to put down what was rumored as a \"black insurrection\". Other whites entered Phillips County to join the action, making a mob of 500 to 1000. They attacked blacks on sight across the county. The governor called in 500 federal troops, who arrested nearly 260 blacks and were accused of killing some. Over a three-day period, fatalities included an 100-240 blacks, with some estimates of more than 800, as well as five white men. The events have been subject to debate, especially the total of black deaths.\n\nThe only men prosecuted for these events were 122 African Americans, with 73 charged with murder. Twelve were quickly convicted and sentenced to death by all-white juries for murder of the white deputy at the church. Others were convicted of lesser charges and sentenced to prison. During appeals, the death penalty cases were separated. Six convictions (known as the Ware defendants) were overturned at the state level for technical trial details. These six defendants were retried in 1920 and convicted again, but on appeal the State Supreme Court overturned the verdicts, based on violations of the Due Process Clause and the Civil Rights Act of 1875, due to exclusion of blacks from the juries. The lower courts failed to retry the men within the two years required by Arkansas law, and the defense finally gained their release in 1923.\n\nThe six other death penalty cases (known as Moore et al.) ultimately reached the United States Supreme Court. The Court overturned the convictions in the \"Moore v. Dempsey\" (1923) ruling. Grounds were the failure of the trial court to provide due process under the Fourteenth Amendment, as the trials had been dominated by adverse publicity and the presence of armed white mobs threatening the jury. This was a critical precedent for the \"Supreme Court's strengthening of the requirements the Due Process Clause imposes on the conduct of state criminal trials.\"\n\nThe NAACP assisted the defendants in the appeals process, raising money to hire a defense team, which it helped direct. When the cases were remanded to the state court, the six 'Moore' defendants settled with the lower court on lesser charges and were sentenced to time already served. Governor Thomas Chipman McRae freed these six men in 1925 in the closing days of his administration. The NAACP helped them leave the state safely.\n\nWith Phillips County developed for cotton plantations in the antebellum era, its population was overwhelmingly black and descended from slaves: in Phillips County, African Americans outnumbered whites by a ten-to-one ratio. In the Arkansas Delta around the time of the Great War, most black farmers were sharecroppers and illiterate, as were many poor whites.\n\nThe Democratic-dominated legislature had disenfranchised most blacks and many poor whites in the 1890s by creating barriers to voter registration. It excluded them from the political system via the more complicated Election Law of 1891 and a poll tax amendment passed in 1892. The white-dominated legislature enacted Jim Crow laws that established racial segregation and institutionalized Democratic efforts to impose white supremacy. The decades around the turn of the century were the period of the highest rate of lynchings across the South.\n\nThe landowner sold the crop whenever and however he saw fit. At the time of settlement, landowners generally never gave an itemized statement to the black sharecroppers of accounts owed, nor details of the money received for cotton and seed. The farmers were disadvantaged as many were illiterate. It was an unwritten law of the cotton country that the sharecroppers could not quit and leave a plantation until their debts were paid. The period of the year around accounts settlement was frequently the time of most lynchings of blacks throughout the South, especially if economic times were poor. As an example, many Negroes in Phillips County, whose cotton was sold in October 1918, did not get a settlement before July of the following year. They often amassed considerable debt at the plantation store before that time, as they had to buy supplies, including seed, to start the next season.\n\nBlack farmers began to organize in 1919 to try to negotiate better conditions, including fair accounting and timely payment of monies due them by white landowners. Robert L. Hill, a black farmer from Winchester, Arkansas, had founded the Progressive Farmers and Household Union of America. He worked with farmers throughout Phillips County. Its purpose was \"to obtain better payments for their cotton crops from the white plantation owners who dominated the area during the Jim Crow era. Black sharecroppers were often exploited in their efforts to collect payment for their cotton crops.\"\n\nWhites tried to disrupt such organizing and threatened farmers. The union had hired a white law firm in the capital of Little Rock to represent the black farmers in getting fair settlements for their 1919 cotton crops before they were taken away for sale. The firm was headed by Ulysses S. Bratton, a native of Searcy County and former assistant federal district attorney.\n\nThe postwar summer of 1919 had already been marked by deadly race riots against black Americans in more than three dozen cities across the country, including Chicago, Knoxville, Washington, DC, and Omaha, Nebraska. Competition for jobs and housing in crowded markets following World War I as veterans returned to society resulted in outbreaks of racial violence, usually of ethnic whites against blacks. Having served their country in the Great War, African-American veterans resisted racial discrimination and violence. In 1919 blacks vigorously fought back when their communities were attacked. Labor unrest and strikes took place in several cities as workers tried to organize. As industries hired blacks as strikebreakers in some cities, worker resentment against them increased.\n\nApproximately 100 African-American farmers, led by Robert L. Hill, the founder of the Progressive Farmers and Household Union of America, met at a church in Hoop Spur, near Elaine in Phillips County. Union advocates brought armed guards to protect the meeting. When two deputized white men and a black trustee arrived at the church, shots were exchanged. Railroad Policeman W.D. Adkins, employed by the Missouri Pacific Railroad was killed and the other white man wounded; it was never determined who shot first.\n\nAccording to \"Revolution in the Land: Southern Agriculture in the 20th Century\" (2002), in a section called \"The Changing Face of Sharecropping and Tenancy\":\n\nThe parish sheriff called for a posse to capture suspects in the killing. Violence expanded beyond the church. Additional armed white men entered the county from outside to support the hunt and a mob formed of 500 to 1,000 armed men. Local whites requested help from Arkansas Governor Charles Hillman Brough, citing a \"Negro uprising\". Sensational newspaper headlines published by the \"Little Rock Gazette\" and others reported that an \"insurrection\" was occurring, and that blacks had planned to murder white leaders.(See scanned \"Gazette\" headlines on this page)\n\nBrough contacted the War Department and requested Federal troops. After considerable delay, nearly 600 U.S. troops arrived, finding the area in chaos. White men roamed the area randomly attacking and killing black men, women and children. Fighting in the area lasted for three days before the troops ended the violence. The federal troops disarmed both parties and arrested 285 black residents, putting them in stockades for investigation until being vouched for by their employers and protection.\n\nAn estimated 100 to 237 African Americans and five whites were killed, and more wounded. At least two and possibly more victims were killed by Federal troops. The exact number of blacks killed is unknown because of the wide rural area in which they were attacked, but estimates range from 100 to 237. Other estimates of the time ranged higher.\n\nA dispatch from Helena, Arkansas to the \"New York Times\", datelined October 1, said: \"Returning members of the [white] posse brought numerous stories and rumors, through all of which ran the belief that the rioting was due to propaganda distributed among the negroes by white men.\"\n\nThe next day's report added detail:\n\nAdditional evidence has been obtained of the activities of propagandists among the negroes, and it is thought that a plot existed for a general uprising against the whites.\" A white man had been arrested and was \"alleged to have been preaching social equality among the negroes.\" Part of the headline was: \"Trouble Traced to Socialist Agitators.\"\n\nA few days later a Western Newspaper Union dispatch was captioned, \"Captive Negro Insurrectionists.\"\n\nArkansas Governor Charles Hillman Brough appointed a Committee of Seven to investigate. The group was composed of prominent local white businessmen. Without talking to any of the black farmers, they concluded that the Progressive Farmers and Household Union of America was a Socialist enterprise and \"established for the purpose of banding negroes together for the killing of white people.\" This version by the white power structure has persisted in many histories of the riot.\n\nThe NAACP promptly released a statement from a contact in Arkansas providing another account of the origins of the violence:\n\nThe whole trouble, as I understand it, started because a Mr. Bratton, a white lawyer from Little Rock, Ark., was employed by sixty or seventy colored families to go to Elaine to represent them in a dispute with the white planters relative to the sale price of cotton.\n\nIt referred to a report in the \"Commercial Appeal\" of Memphis, Tennessee on October 3 that quoted Bratton's father:\n\nThe NAACP sent its Field Secretary, Walter F. White, from New York City to Elaine in October 1919 to investigate events. White was of mixed, majority-European ancestry; blond and blue-eyed, he could pass for white. He was granted credentials from the \"Chicago Daily News.\" He gained an interview with Governor Charles Hillman Brough, who gave him a letter of recommendation for other meetings with whites, as well as an autographed photograph.\n\nWhite had been in Phillips County for a brief time when he learned there were rumors floating about him. He quickly took the first train back to Little Rock. The conductor told the young man that he was leaving \"just when the fun is going to start,\" because they had found out that there was a \"damned yellow nigger passing for white and the boys are going to get him.\" When White asked what the boys would do to the man, the conductor told White that \"when they get through with him he won't pass for white no more!\"\n\nWhite had time to talk with both black and white residents in Elaine. He reported that local people said that up to 100 blacks had been killed. White published his findings in the \"Daily News,\" the \"Chicago Defender,\" and \"The Nation,\" as well as the NAACP's magazine \"The Crisis.\" He \"characterized the violence as an extreme response by white landowners to black unionization.\"\n\nGovernor Brough asked the United States Postal Service to prohibit the mailing of the \"Chicago Defender\" and \"Crisis\" to Arkansas, while local officials attempted to enjoin distribution of the \"Defender.\" Years later, White said in his memoir that people in Elaine told him that up to 200 blacks had been killed.\n\nIn October and November 1919, an all-white Arkansas state grand jury returned indictments against 122 blacks. Since most blacks had been disenfranchised by Arkansas' 1891 Election Law and 1892 poll tax amendment, which created barriers to voter registration, blacks as non-voters were excluded from juries. All-white juries rendered verdicts on the defendants in trials following the Elaine race riot.\n\nThose blacks willing to testify against others and to work without shares for terms as determined by their landlords, were set free. Those who refused to comply with those conditions, or were labeled as ringleaders or were judged unreliable, were indicted. According to the affidavits later supplied by the defendants, many of the prisoners had been beaten, whipped or tortured by electric shocks to extract testimony or confessions. They were threatened with death if they recanted their testimony. A total of 73 suspects were charged with murder; other charges included conspiracy and insurrection.\n\nThe trials were held in 1920 in the county courthouse in Elaine, Phillips County. Mobs of armed whites milled around the courthouse. Some of the white audience in the courtroom also carried arms. The lawyers for the defense did not subpoena witnesses for the defense and did not allow their clients to testify.\n\nTwelve of the defendants (who became known as the 'Arkansas Twelve' or 'Elaine Twelve') were convicted of murder and sentenced to death in the electric chair, most of them as \"accomplices\" in the murder of Adkins at the church. The defense lawyer of one defendant did not interview any witnesses, ask for a change of venue, nor challenge any jurors. The trials of these twelve lasted less than an hour in many cases; the juries took fewer than ten minutes to deliberate before pronouncing each man guilty and sentencing them to death. The \"Arkansas Gazette\" applauded the trials as the triumph of the \"rule of law,\" because none of the defendants was lynched. These men became known as the \"Elaine Twelve.\"\n\nAfter those convictions, 36 of the remaining defendants chose to plead guilty to second-degree murder rather than face trial. Sixty-seven other defendants were convicted of various charges and sentenced to terms up to 21 years.\n\nThe NAACP took on the task of organizing the defendants' appeals. For a time, the NAACP tried to conceal its role in the appeals, given the hostile reception to its reports on the rioting and the trials. Once it undertook to organize the defense, it went to work vigorously, raising more than $50,000 and hiring Scipio Africanus Jones, a highly respected African-American attorney from Arkansas, and Colonel George W. Murphy, a 79-year-old Confederate veteran and former Attorney General for the State of Arkansas. Moorfield Storey, descended from Boston abolitionists and founding president of the NAACP since 1909, became part of the team when the Moore cases went to the Supreme Court. He had been president of the American Bar Association in 1895.\n\nThe defendants' lawyers obtained reversal of the verdicts by the Arkansas Supreme Court in six of the twelve death penalty cases, known as the \"Ware\" defendants. The grounds were that the jury had failed to specify whether the defendants were guilty of murder in the first or second degree; those cases (known as Ware et al.) were sent back to the lower court for retrial. The lower court retried the defendants beginning on May 3, 1920. On the third day of the trials, Murphy collapsed in the courtroom.\n\nScipio Jones had to carry most of the responsibility for the remaining trials. The all-white juries quickly convicted the six defendants of second-degree murder and sentenced them to 12 years each in prison. Jones appealed these convictions, which were overturned by the State Supreme Court. It found that the exclusion of blacks from the juries resulted in a lack of due process for the defendants, according to the Fourteenth Amendment and the Civil Rights Act of 1875.\n\nThe Arkansas Supreme Court upheld the death sentences of Moore and the other five defendants, known as the \"Moore\" defendants. It rejected the challenge to the all-white juries as untimely, and found that the mob atmosphere and use of coerced testimony did not deny the defendants the due process of law. Those defendants unsuccessfully petitioned the United States Supreme Court for a writ of \"certiorari\" from the Arkansas Supreme Court's decision.\n\nThe defendants next petitioned for a writ of \"habeas corpus,\" alleging that the proceedings that took place in the Arkansas state court, while ostensibly complying with trial requirements, in fact complied only in form. They argued that the accused had not been adequately defended and were convicted under the pressure of the mob, with blatant disregard for their constitutional rights.\n\nThe defendants originally intended to file their petition in Federal district court, but the only sitting judge was assigned to other judicial duties in Minnesota at the time and would not return to Arkansas until after the defendants' scheduled execution date. Judge John Ellis Martineau of the Pulaski County chancery court issued the writ. Although the writ was later overturned by the Arkansas Supreme Court, his action postponed the execution date long enough to permit the defendants to seek \"habeas corpus\" relief in Federal court.\n\nU.S. District Judge Jacob Trieber issued another writ. The State of Arkansas defended the convictions from a narrowly legalistic position, based on the US Supreme Court's earlier decision in \"Frank v. Mangum\" (1915). It did not dispute the defendants' evidence of torture used to obtain confessions nor of mob intimidation at the trial, but the state argued that, even if true, these elements did not amount to a denial of due process. The United States district court agreed, denying the writ, but it found there was probable cause for an appeal and allowed the defendants to take their case to the U.S. Supreme Court..\n\nIn \"Moore v. Dempsey\" . the United States Supreme Court vacated these six convictions on the grounds that the mob-dominated atmosphere of the trial and the use of testimony coerced by torture denied the defendants' due process as required by the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. Prominent Little Rock attorney George Rose wrote a letter to outgoing Governor Thomas McRae requesting that he find a way to release the remaining defendants if they agreed to plead guilty to second-degree murder. Rose's letter was an attempt to prevent Governor-Elect Thomas Jefferson Terral, a known member of the Ku Klux Klan, from getting involved in the matter. \n\nJust hours before Governor McRae left office in 1925, he contacted Scipio Jones to inform him that indefinite furloughs had been issued for the remaining defendants. Jones used the furloughs to obtain release of the prisoners under cover of darkness. He arranged for these men to be quickly escorted out of state to prevent their being lynched.\n\nThe Supreme Court's decision marked the beginning of an era in which the Supreme Court gave closer scrutiny to criminal justice cases and reviewed state actions against the Due Process Clause and the Bill of Rights. A decade later, the Supreme Court reviewed the case of the Scottsboro boys. The victory for the Elaine defendants gave the NAACP greater credibility as the champion of African Americans' rights. Walter F. White's risk-taking investigation and report contributed to his advancing in the organization. He later was selected as executive secretary of the NAACP, essentially the chief operating officer, and served in this position for decades, leading the organization in additional legal challenges and civil rights activism.\n\n\"It is documented that five whites, including a soldier died at Elaine, but estimates of African American deaths, made by individuals writing about the Elaine affair between 1919-25, range from 20 to 856; if accurate, these numbers would make it by far the most deadly conflict in the history of the United States. The \"Arkansas Encyclopedia of History and Culture\" notes that estimates of African-American deaths range into the \"hundreds.\"\n\nSince the late 20th century, researchers have begun to investigate the Elaine race riot more thoroughly. For decades, the riot and numerous murders were too painful to be discussed openly in the region. The wide-scale violence ended union organizing among black farmers. White oppression continued, threatening every black family. Historian Robert Whitaker says, \"As with many racial histories of this kind,\" it was \"one of those shameful events best not talked about.\"\n\nAnother reason for silence was that the second Ku Klux Klan began to be active in Arkansas in 1921, concentrating in black-majority areas. It used intimidation and attacks to keep blacks suppressed. Author Richard Wright grew up in Phillips County and discusses it in his autobiography \"Black Boy.\" He wrote that when he questioned his mother about why their people didn't fight back, \"the fear that was in her made her slap me into silence.\"\n\nA 1961 article, \"Underlying Causes of the Elaine Riot,\" claimed that blacks were planning an insurrection, based on interviews with whites who had been alive at the time, and that they were fairly treated by planters of the area. It repeated rumors of 1919 that certain planters were targeted for murder. This view has been generally discounted by historians publishing since the late 20th century.\n\nIn early 2000 a conference on the Elaine riot was held at the Delta Cultural Center in the county seat of Helena, Arkansas. It was an effort to review the facts but did not result in \"closure\" for the people of Phillips County. The Associated Press spoke with author Grif Shockley, who has published a book on the riot. He said that in 2000, there were still two versions of the riot, which he characterized as the \"white\" version, related to their idea that the union planned an attack on whites, and a \"black\" version, related to farmers' efforts to gain fair settlements of their crops. Shockley said there \"was plenty of evidence to say whites attacked blacks indiscriminately.\" Local electoral offices were divided between the races in West Helena and the county.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "22064555", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=22064555", "title": "Ethics Bowl", "text": "Ethics Bowl\n\nThe Intercollegiate Ethics Bowl is an activity that combines the excitement of a competitive tournament with a valuable education experience for undergraduate students. Created in 1993 at the Illinois Institute of Technology, the Ethics Bowl has grown steadily over the years. Resembling a college bowl or quiz bowl competition, a moderator asks two teams questions that pose an ethical problem on topics ranging from professional ethics to social and political topics, and are then scored by a panel of judges on their responses both to the question and one another. Since 1997, the national Ethics Bowl Competition has taken place every year at the annual meeting of the Association for Practical and Professional Ethics. \n\nFor the past few years ten regional bowls have taken place throughout the U.S. with over 100 teams competing. The top thirty-two teams are then invited to participate in the national competition. \n\nAlong with the Intercollegiate Ethics Bowl for undergraduates, a number of other ethics bowl competitions are held, including one sponsored by the Society for American Archeology. The Parr Center for Ethics, at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, is the headquarters for the National High School Ethics Bowl. The National High School Ethics Bowl currently has 32 regional competitions across the United States, and the national competition takes place every spring at UNC-CH. \n\nAn international version of the same event has been established using technology to bring high school students together called an Olympiad.\n\nWhile the organization of Ethics Bowl tournaments can vary from region to region, single rounds generally follow a given format. Four to six weeks before the date of the competition, the competing teams, judges, and moderators are given a packet of case studies that present ethical issues to study. The goal for the teams is not to do research on the cases, but to be able to formulate well structured, logical answers to questions asked about the cases.\n\nIn the round, both teams are each asked a question about different case studies. The team answers questions in the following way. First, the moderator poses a question to the team, and after two minutes to confer, the team must state their answer within ten minutes. The responding team then has one minute to present a response to the first team's answer for five minutes, and the first team then has a chance to respond to these comments for 5 minutes with 1 minute before to confer. Finally, the panel of judges has the chance to ask questions of the first team, either to clarify a point, or to elicit a team's viewpoint on an ethical aspect raised in their response. The judges then proceed to evaluate the first teams' response and the second team's comment based on the following criteria: clarity and intelligibility, focus on ethically relevant factors, avoidance of ethical irrelevance, and deliberative thoughtfulness. The round then repeats this format with the second team receiving a question about a different case. \n\nIn the national competition of the Intercollegiate Ethics Bowl, during the first evening, each team competes in two rounds against different teams. Two more rounds commence the next morning, and then the top eight teams continue on to the last rounds, all of which are single-elimination: quarter finals, semi finals, and lastly, the final round where the two remaining teams compete to determine the winner.\n\nThe Ethics Bowl was developed in 1993 by Dr. Robert Ladenson of the Illinois Institute of Technology. An intramural Ethics Bowl was held at IIT for two years, and in 1995 a small local competition was held where teams from DePaul University, Loyola University, and Western Michigan University were invited to compete against the winning IIT from that year's competition. In 1996, the same four schools participated in the local competition, along with a team from the United States Air Force Academy. \n\nThe first nationwide Intercollegiate Ethics Bowl was held in 1997 in Washington, D.C. in conjunction with the annual meeting of the Association for Practical and Professional Ethics. Since that time, the Ethics Bowl has taken place at the APPE annual meeting every year. The University of Montana won the National Championship in 1997. The United States Military Academy competed in and won the National Championship in 1998 and 1999. In 2006, due to the number of teams wishing to participate in the Ethics Bowl, regional competitions were held at locations throughout the U.S., and the top-scoring 32 teams were invited to participate in the national competition held in February, 2007. \n\nIn 2006, the United States Military Academy won the national championship.<br>\nIn 2007, the University of Miami beat Westminster College to win the national championship.<br>\nIn 2008 in San Antonio, Texas, Clemson University beat Westminster College in the final round to be national champion.<br> \nIn 2009, Indiana University beat Clemson University for the national title.<br>\nIn 2010, the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) beat Weber State University to win the national championship.<br>\nIn 2011, the University of Central Florida beat Montana State to claim the national championship.<br>\nIn 2012, Whitworth University beat Clemson University in the final match for the national championship.<br>\nIn 2013, in San Antonio, Texas, DePauw University beat Taylor University in the final match for the national championship.<br>\nIn 2014, in Jacksonville, Florida, the University of Montana beat the University of Oklahoma in the final match for the national championship.<br> \nIn 2015, in Costa Mesa, California, Taylor University beat Whitworth University in the final match for the national championship.<br> \nIn 2016, Whitworth University beat Youngstown State University in the final match for the national championship.<br>\nIn 2017, the United States Military Academy beat Youngstown State for the national championship.<br>\nIn 2018, Santa Clara University beat the University of Oklahoma for the national championship.<br>\n"}
{"id": "41638372", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=41638372", "title": "Fish slaughter", "text": "Fish slaughter\n\nFish slaughter is the process of killing fish, typically after harvesting at sea or from fish farms. At least one trillion fish are slaughtered each year for human consumption. Some relatively humane slaughter methods have been developed, including percussive and electric stunning. However, most fish harvesting continues to use methods like suffocation in air, carbon-dioxide stunning, or ice chilling that may not optimise fish welfare in some instances.\n\nAccording to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), a total of 156.2 million tons of fish, crustaceans, molluscs, and other aquatic animals were captured in 2011. This is a sum of 93.5 million tons of wild animals and 62.7 million tons of farmed animals. 56.8% of this total was freshwater fish, 6.4% diadromous fish, and 3.2% marine fish, with the remainder being molluscs, crustaceans, and miscellaneous.\n\nThe number of individual wild fish killed each year is estimated as 0.97-2.74 trillion (based on FAO tonnage statistics combined with estimated mean weights of fish species). The FAO numbers do not include illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing, nor discarded fish. If these are included and over-reporting by China subtracted, the totals increase by about 16.6% to 33.3%. A similar estimate for the number of farmed fish slaughtered each year is 0.037 to 0.120 trillion.\n\nMid-sized trout farms in the UK may process more than 10,000 fish per hour. They are often operated by only a few people, and it may be necessary to kill trout on short notice or even at night.\n\nResearch on fish suffering during slaughter relies on measures to indicate when fish are stressed. Some indicators used by welfare studies include\n\nFollowing electric stunning, as fish gradually resume consciousness, they begin to make rhythmic gill-cover movements. Based on EEG correlations, it is believed that stunned fish remain insensible until they have resumed rhythmic gill patterns. This can be used as a convenient assessment tool for the effectiveness of electric stunning.\n\nIn 2004, the European Food Safety Authority observed that \"Many existing commercial killing methods expose fish to substantial suffering over a prolonged period of time.\"\n\nThe \"Aquatic Animal Health Code\" of the World Organisation for Animal Health considers the following slaughter methods inhumane.\n\nThis is the oldest slaughter method for fish and is considered inhumane because it can take the fish over an hour to die. One Dutch study found that it took 55–250 minutes for various species of fish to become insensible during asphyxiation. Fish that evolved for low-oxygen environments take longer to die. At higher temperatures, fish lose consciousness more quickly.\n\nMeat quality and shelf-life are also diminished when this method is used.\n\nAlso called \"live chilling\", this method involves putting fish in baths of ice water, where they chill and eventually die of anoxia. Because chilling slows metabolic rate and oxygen needs, it may prolong the duration until death in some instances, with some cold adapted species taking more than an hour to die. On these grounds, the Farm Animal Welfare Council's 1996 report on farmed-fish welfare stated: \"The cooling of live trout on ice after they have been removed from water should be prohibited.\" In contrast, later research suggested that for warm Mediterranean species such as sea bream and sea bass, the method might at least be preferable to air asphyxiation, with fish showing lower levels of stress indicators. More recent research has shown that ice water is faster and less stressful than anaesthetics for killing tropical ornamental fishes like zebrafish.\n\nMost often applied for salmon and trout, CO narcosis involves filling the fish water with CO to produce acidic pH, which injures the brain. The procedure is apparently stressful, as evidenced by fish swimming vigorously and trying to escape from the tank. CO immobilizes the fish within 2–4 minutes, but the fish remain conscious until subsequent stunning or killing.\n\nSalting involves application of salt to the container holding the fish, the salt applied should be just enough to weaken the fish. Salting of fish as a slaughtering (killing method) is only applicable to freshwater species\n\nExsanguination is the process whereby an animal is cut so that it bleeds to death. Fish are cut in highly vascular body regions, and the process is stressful unless the animals are unconscious. If not stunned, according to behavioral and neural criteria, fish may remain conscious for 15 minutes or more between the time when major blood vessels have been cut and when they lose consciousness. Eel brains may continue to process information for 13–30 minutes after being decapitated, and some fish may remain sensible for 20–40 minutes after evisceration.\n\nAlso known as \"knocking\", percussive stunning involves hitting the fish's head with a wooden or plastic club, called a \"priest\". One or two appropriate blows can disrupt the brain sufficiently to render the fish insensible and potentially even kill it directly. However, applying this method correctly requires training and effort. Percussive stunning must be applied one fish at a time and so is typically only used for large fish, such as salmon and trout. If the operator is skilled, percussive stunning can be among the most humane methods and can also yield high meat quality. One comparison of slaughter methods found that percussive stunning had the best welfare performance as measured by low hematocrit, low plasma glucose, low lactate, and high muscle energy charge.\n\nFor some fish species, there are automated percussive stunning tools, such as a pneumatic club for salmon. However, building an automated machine to process, orient, percussively stun, and bleed bulk quantities of small fish would be difficult.\n\nPithing, also known as ikejime (or ikijime), involves sticking a sharp spike through the brain of the fish. If done properly, it can kill quickly, however, if the operator misses the brain, the results may be stressful for the fish. As with percussive stunning, spiking is used to kill one fish at a time and so is mainly used for large species such as tuna and salmon.\n\nShooting large fish is also possible.\n\nElectricity can be more humane than alternatives if applied correctly. In addition to potentially producing unconsciousness quickly, stunning reduces the stress of restraint and being removed from water.\n\nIf electrical parameters are not optimized, electrical stunning may produce immobility without loss of consciousness, which is inhumane. There is little public data comparing optimal stun settings found by researchers with the settings used in commercial slaughter operations, so it is unknown how effective real-world stunning is. In addition, proper stun parameters vary significantly by species.\n\nElectricity may introduce bleedspots, so proper settings are required.\n\nSystems have been developed to slaughter large numbers of fish whilst maintaining welfare standards.\n\nA paper published by Jeff Lines and his collaborators in 2003 announced that stunning trout for 60 seconds in an electric field of 250 V/m r.m.s. with a sinusoidal waveform of 1,000 Hz rendered them permanently unconscious without degrading meat quality. A stunning system, called HS1, has been developed in accordance with Lines' study. The system first stuns fish and then keeps them unconscious, through electronarcosis, until death. The machine has been widely adopted in the UK, precessing an estimated 80% of all UK trout killed for meat. According to the Humane Slaughter Association's James Kirkwood: \"Before ten years ago there was no way to humanely kill farmed fish en masse – they died slowly through suffocation when harvested from the water. This welfare benefit affects millions of fish.\"\n\nNo welfare standards exist for the trillion or more fish harvested from the wild each year.\n\nSince 2008, Norway has banned CO stunning. By January 2010, 80% of Norwegian fish-slaughter facilities had switched to either percussive or electrical stunning.\n\nGermany has banned use of salt or ammonia baths.\n\n"}

Frank Allen Kurtz, Jr. (September 9, 1911 – October 31, 1996) was an American Olympic diver and an aviator in the United States Army Air Forces.\n\nKurtz was born in Davenport, Iowa, the third child of Dora Lee (née Fenton) and Frank Allen Kurtz, Sr., an insurance salesman. He grew up in Kansas City, Missouri. Kurtz became interested in flying at age 16, and in 1935 flew an open cockpit plane, setting a speed record flight from Los Angeles to Mexico City to Washington, D.C. and back to Los Angeles.\n\nKurtz's diving abilities impressed Olympic champion swimmer Johnny Weissmuller, who encouraged him to train with famous coach Clyde Swendsen. Kurtz graduated from Hollywood High School and went on to the University of Southern California especially to join the diving team. He won a bronze medal in the 10 meter platform at the 1932 Olympics and placed fifth in 1936, competing with an injured shoulder. He also won the AAU platform title in 1933.\n\nKurtz joined the Army to train as a pilot, anticipating a career in commercial aviation. Before the war, he held the national junior transcontinental speed record and established half a dozen other speed marks for light planes.\n\nHe was Commander of the 463d Bombardment Group (Heavy), 15th Air Force, Celone Airfield, Foggia, Italy (1944–45) and a survivor of the air attack at Clark Field in the Philippines, two days after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941. In Australia, he salvaged and helped to rebuild a B-17D Flying Fortress bomber using a combination of parts from other wrecked B-17s. At that time, the repaired B-17D was nicknamed \"The Swoose\" by 19th Bomb Group pilot, Captain Weldon Smith. The tail of a Boeing B-17D, AAF Ser. No. 40-3091 was grafted onto 40-3097, resulting in a hybrid B-17D. The bomber became \"half swan and half goose\" just like the lyrics in the then-popular novelty song \"Alexander, The Swoose.\" Before the end of the war, \"The Swoose\" was scheduled to be scrapped and smelted down for its aluminium content. Kurtz then convinced the City of Los Angeles to retrieve his by-then famous bomber for use as a World War II memorial: It was the only B-17 that flew from the beginning of World War II until the end. Today, \"The Swoose\" is the oldest surviving B-17 and the only early \"D\" model still in existence.

{"id": "19476365", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19476365", "title": "Gospel of Basilides", "text": "Gospel of Basilides\n\nThe Gospel of Basilides is the title given to a reputed text within the New Testament apocrypha, which is reported in the middle of the third century as then circulating amongst the followers of Basilides (Βασιλείδης), a leading theologian of Gnostic tendencies, who had taught in Alexandria in the second quarter of the second century. Basilides's teachings were condemned as heretical by Irenaeus of Lyons (c.130 – c.200), and by Hippolytus of Rome (c. 170 – c.236), although they had been evaluated more positively by Clement of Alexandria (c.150 – c.215). There is, however, no agreement amongst Irenaeus, Hippolytus or Clement as to Basilides's specific theological opinions; while none of the three report a gospel in the name of Basilides. The first direct reference to a Gospel of Basilides is therefore that found in Origen (c.185 – c.254), who reports: \n\nThe Church has four Gospels. Heretics have many. One of them is entitled \"According to the Egyptians\". Another is \"According to the Twelve Apostles\". Basilides too dared to write a \"Gospel According to Basilides\".\n\nOrigen’s notice is the source for references to the Gospel of Basilides in Jerome, Ambrose, Philip of Side, and the Venerable Bede. But none of these authors report any quotations from the supposed gospel, nor are they able to give an indication as to its content or character.\n\nMuch more is known about Basilides major work in twenty-four books; for which Clement of Alexandria records the title \"Exegetica\" (or 'Treatises') and provides quotations from book twenty-three, while other quotations are preserved in the works of Hegemonius. Eusebius of Caesarea reports Agrippa Castor (mid 2nd century) as describing the \"Exegetica\" as, \"twenty-four books on the Gospel\", and this notice has been interpreted as characterising the full \"Exegetica\" as an extended commentary, whose base text might be inferred as being the lost \"Gospel of Basilides\". From this assumption and the surviving quotations from the \"Exegetica\", a range of theories have been developed as to the nature of the Gospel of Basilides: that it was a redaction of the Gospel of Luke; that it combined the Gospels of Luke and Matthew; that it was a ‘’diatessaron’’ or harmony of all four gospels; that it was an independent account of the life of Jesus; and even that it was an abstract treatise or homily on the religious significance of Jesus, with no specific relation to his teachings or the events of his earthly ministry, similar in this respect to the Gospel of Truth, another Gnostic work. Some scholars maintain that Origen’s notice of a Gospel of Basilides was referring to the \"Exegetica\" itself; and that the two titles are therefore to be identified. Otherwise, the Gospel of Basilides could denote a second or third century Gnostic text (whether lost or surviving under another title) with no connection to Basilides himself, other than being preserved within the sect that bore his name. Wilhelm Schneemelcher states: \n\nIn short it must be said that all conjectures concerning the Gospel of Basilides remain uncertain.\n\nBasilides is reported as having taught a docetic doctrine of Christ's passion. Although Irenaeus’s makes no mention of Basilides having written a gospel, he does record him as teaching that Christ in Jesus, as a wholly divine being, could not suffer bodily pain and did not die on the cross; but that the person crucified was, in fact, Simon of Cyrene.\n\nHe appeared on earth as a man and performed miracles. Thus he himself did not suffer. Rather, a certain Simon of Cyrene was compelled to carry his cross for him. It was he who was ignorantly and erroneously crucified, being transfigured by him, so that he might be thought to be Jesus. Moreover, Jesus assumed the form of Simon, and stood by laughing at them. Irenaeus, \"Against Heresies\"\n\nEpiphanius of Salamis reports the same episode as being taught by Basilides, although he may in this be relying solely on Irenaeus. Accounts of the living Christ being seen laughing alongside, or above, the crucifixion are also found in two second/third century Gnostic texts in the Nag Hammadi Library; the Apocalypse of Peter and The Second Treatise of the Great Seth; and in the latter text, Simon of Cyrene is also identified as being one of a succession of bodily substitutes for the spiritual Christ. Winrich Löhr infers that a common mid-second century gospel tradition (which he nevertheless doubts as originating with Basilides himself) must underlie both the Irenaeus notice and the two Nag Hammadi texts.\n"}

Her sister, Elizabeth of Russia, ruled as Empress between 1741 and 1762. While a potential heir in the reign of her father and her mother, she never acceded to the throne due to political reasons. However, her son Peter would rule as Emperor in 1762, succeeding Elizabeth. She was the \"Duchess of Schleswig-Holstein-Gottorp\" by marriage.\n\nAnna was born out of wedlock, although her parents were married in 1712 and she was later legitimized. Her earlier illegitimacy would pose great challenges for her marriage.\n\nAnna grew up in the houses of Peter’s younger sister Natalia and Prince Alexander Menshikov. Although born illegitimate, she and her younger sister Elizabeth were awarded the titles of “princess” (\"tsarevna\") on 6 March 1711 and “crown princess” (\"tsesarevna\") on 23 December 1721.\n\nPeter planned to marry his daughters to foreign princes in order to gain European allies for the Russian Empire. The two girls were educated with this aim in mind, learning literature, writing, embroidery, dancing and etiquette. Anna developed into an intelligent, well-read girl who spoke four foreign languages – French, German, Italian and Swedish.\n\nAnna’s shyness was evident at an early age. One witness describes the amusing hitch that once occurred during the traditional exchanging of Easter kisses. When the duke of Holstein-Gottorp tried to kiss the fourteen-year-old Anna, she turned bright red in embarrassment, while her younger sister “immediately stuck out her little pink mouth for a kiss.”\n\nForeign visitors to the Russian court were struck by the uncommon beauty of Anna. The dark-eyed Anna looked more like her father and was considered more level-headed and intelligent than her younger sister, the fair-haired Elizabeth. A contemporary described Anna: “She was a beautiful soul in a beautiful body ... both in appearance and in manners, she was [her father’s] complete likeness, particularly in her character and mind ... set off by her kind heart.”\n\nOn 17 March 1721, Karl Friedrich arrived in Imperial Russia to get acquainted with his future wife and father-in-law. He aspired to use the marriage in order to ensure Russia's support for his plans of retrieving Schleswig from Denmark. He also entertained hopes of being backed up by Russia in his claims to the Swedish throne. Under the terms of the Treaty of Nystad Russia promised not to interfere in the internal affairs of Sweden, so his hopes proved ill-founded.\n\nAnother possible candidate as a husband was a grandson of Louis XIV of France and Madame de Montespan, Louis Duke of Orleans - the son of the Regent of France for the infant Louis XV of France. The marriage proposal was ignored due to a difference in style of address. Anna was addressed as Her Imperial Highness and Louis was as His Serene Highness.\n\nAs a favorite child of Peter the Great, Anna's name day (3 February) was taken to be a national holiday in 1724.\n\nOn 22 November 1724, the marriage contract was signed between Karl Friedrich and Peter. By this contract, Anna and Karl Friedrich renounced all rights and claims to the crown of the Russian Empire on behalf of themselves and their descendants. However a secret clause allowed the Emperor to name a successor out of any sons from the marriage. As a result of this clause, the Emperor secured the right to name any of his descendants as his successor on the Russian throne.\n\nA few months thereafter, by January 1725, Peter the Great fell mortally ill. As the story goes, on his deathbed he managed to spell the words: \"to give all...\", but could not continue further and sent for Anna to dictate his last will to her. By the time the princess arrived, the Emperor could not pronounce a single word. Based on the story, some historians speculated that Peter's wish was to leave the throne to Anna, but this is not confirmed.\n\nAfter the accession of her mother Catherine I, a grand wedding was held for Anna in Trinity Cathedral, St Petersburg on 21 May 1725. The wedding party then crossed the River Neva to the Summer Garden, where Mikhail Zemtsov had designed a special banqueting hall for the occasion.\n\nThe tables were set with all sorts of delicacies, including enormous pies. When the orchestra began to play, male and female dwarves jumped out of the pies and began to dance on the tables. Each toast was accompanied by cannon fire from a nearby yacht and the guards regiments positioned on Tsaritsa Meadow. The following day, everyone was invited to Peterhof, where the banqueting and dancing continued in the Upper Palace.\n\nCarl Friedrich and Anna spent the next two years in St Petersburg. Catherine I made her son-in-law a lieutenant colonel of the Preobrazhensky Regiment and a member of the Supreme Privy Council. He began to play an important role in the life of the Russian Empire and foreign diplomats predicted that the empress would name Anna as her successor.\n\nThe Duke was admitted into the newly established Supreme Secret Council and exerted a moderate influence on Russian politics. Catherine I's death in 1727 made his position precarious, as the power shifted to the hands of Alexander Menshikov, who aspired to marry the young emperor, Peter II, to his own daughter, Maria Menshikov. A quarrel between the Duke and Menshikov resulted in the former's withdrawing to Holstein on 25 July 1727.\n\nBefore her departure for Holstein, Anna was asked to sign a receipt for all the money awarded to her as her dowry. For a long time, the document was not accepted by the government, because it gave the old title of Peter’s daughter – \"'Tsesarevna '(\"crown princess of Russia). Now, she was neither Russian nor a crown princess.\n\nOn 25 July 1727, Anna and her husband left St Petersburg for Kiel. When they arrived in the capital of Holstein, the duke underwent a personality change. Merry and gallant in St Petersburg, he was now a rude, drunken boor. He spent his time in the rowdy company of friends and other women, leaving his wife, now pregnant, entirely on her own.\n\nIn Kiel, Anna would spend her days writing long, tearful letters to her sister Elizabeth. Semyon Mordvinov, a lieutenant in the Russian navy, remembers Anna crying bitterly when she gave him her mail to take back to Russia. In one such letter to Elizabeth, she writes: “Not a day passes without my weeping for you, my dear sister!”\n\nOn 21 February 1728, Anna gave birth in Kiel Castle to a son named Carl Peter Ulrich, the future Peter III of Russia. Peter would go on to be the future Emperor of Russia and found the House of Holstein-Gottorp-Romanov that would go on to rule Russia until the early 20th-century. A few days after his birth, the barely twenty-year-old duchess caught puerperal fever (postpartum infection) and died on 4 March 1728. In memory of his wife, Carl Friedrich founded the Order of St Anna, which subsequently became a Russian decoration.\n\nBefore her death, Anna Petrovna had asked to be buried alongside her father in St Petersburg. Two ships, the \"Raphael\" and the \"Cruiser\", were dispatched to Kiel for Anna’s body. The coffin was transported up the River Neva on a galley, with long black crape hanging overboard, trailing in the water. On 12 November 1728, Anna was laid to rest next to her parents in the still unfinished St Peter and St Paul Cathedral.\n\nThrough her marriage with the Duke Karl Friedrich, she had one son\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "314274", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=314274", "title": "Haunted house", "text": "Haunted house\n\nIn ghostlore, a haunted house or ghosthouse is a house or other building often perceived as being inhabited by disembodied spirits of the deceased who may have been former residents or were familiar with the property. Parapsychologists attribute haunting to the spirits of the dead and the effect of violent or tragic events in the building's past such as murder, accidental death, or suicide. More scientific explanations for the perception that a house is haunted include misinterpreting noises naturally present in structures, waking dreams, suggestibility, and the effect of toxic substances in environments that can cause hallucinations.\n\nIn a 2005, Gallup poll, 37 percent of Americans, 28 percent of Canadians, and 40 percent of Britons expressed the belief that houses could be \"haunted\".\n\nAccording to science writer Terence Hines, cold spots, creaking sounds, and odd noises are typically present in any home, especially older ones, and \"such noises can easily be mistaken for the sound of footsteps by those inclined to imagine the presence of a deceased tenant in their home.\"\n\nDavid Turner, a retired chemist, suggested that ball lightning could cause inanimate objects to move erratically.\n\nSkeptical investigator Joe Nickell writes that in most cases he investigated, he found plausible explanations for haunting phenomena, such as physical illusions, waking dreams, and the effects of memory. According to Nickell, the power of suggestion along with confirmation bias plays a large role in perceived hauntings. He states that as a house, inn, or other place becomes thought of as haunted, more and more ghostly encounters are reported and that when people are given to expect paranormal events, they tend to notice those conditions that would confirm their expectations.\n\nToxicologist Albert Donnay believes that chronic exposure to substances such as carbon monoxide, pesticide, and formaldehyde can lead to hallucinations of the type associated with haunted houses. Donnay speculates on the connection between the prevalence of gas lamps during the Victorian era and start of the 20th century stories of ghost sightings and hauntings, describing it as the \"Haunted House Syndrome\". Donnay says that carbon monoxide poisoning has been linked to haunted houses since at least the 1920s, citing a 1921 journal article published about a family who suffered headaches, auditory hallucinations, fatigue, melancholy, and other symptoms associated with haunted houses.\n\nMichael Persinger, Jason Braithewaite, and others, suggested that perceived apparitions, cold spots, and ghostly touches are perceptual anomalies caused by variations in naturally occurring or man-made magnetic fields. However, a study by psychologist Chris French and others that attempted to replicate Persinger's findings found no link.\n\nPsychology Professor Frank McAndrew (Francis T. McAndrew) explains what environmental psychologists call \"legibility - the ease with which a place can be recognized, organized into a pattern and recalled\" and how a typical haunted house may have a confusing layout and be quite the opposite of legibility.\n\nThe concept of the haunted house was capitalized on as early as 1915 with the Orton and Spooner Haunted House in Hollycombe Steam Collection (England), and by the 1970s, commercial haunted houses had sprung up all over the United States in cities like Louisville, Kentucky and Cincinnati, Ohio. By 2005, an estimated 3,500 to 5,000 professional haunted attractions operated in the United States. In addition, around the time of Hallowtide, many Christian churches run a type of haunted house known as a hell house, which while being a haunted house, also promotes their interpretation of the Christian gospel message. According to \"USA Today\", in hell houses, \"participants walk through several 'scenes' depicting the consequences of things like abortion, homosexuality and drunkenness.\"\n\nIn the case \"Stambovsky v. Ackley\", the Supreme Court of New York, Appellate Division ruled in 1991 that a seller must disclose that a house has a reputation for being haunted when there is a fiduciary relationship or in cases of fraud or misrepresentation, because such a reputation impairs the value of the house:\nLegends about haunted houses have long appeared in literature. The earliest surviving report of a haunted house comes from a letter written by Pliny the Younger (61 – c. 112) to his patron Lucias Sura, in which he describes a haunted villa in Athens. Nobody would live in the house until the philosopher Athenodorus (c.74 BCE – 7 CE) arrived in the city. He was tempted by the low rent and undeterred by the house's reputation so he moved in. The ghost, an old man bound with chains, appeared to Athenodrus during the first night, and beckoned to the philosopher. The apparition vanished once it reached the courtyard, and Athenodrus carefully marked the spot. The following morning he requested the magistrate to have the spot dug up, where the skeleton of an old man bound with chains was discovered. The ghost never appeared again after the skeleton was given a proper burial.\n\nStories of haunted houses are also included in the \"Arabian Nights\", as in the tale of \"Ali the Cairene and the Haunted House in Baghdad\"; more modern authors from Henry James to Stephen King have also featured them in their writings.\n\nHaunting is used as a plot device in gothic or horror fiction or, more lately, paranormal fiction; haunted castles and mansions are common in gothic literature. Notable works of fiction featuring haunted houses include:\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1720304", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1720304", "title": "Higgins (dog)", "text": "Higgins (dog)\n\nHiggins (December 12, 1957 - November 11, 1975) was one of the best-known dog actors of the 1960s and 1970s. Most people remember him as the original Benji or as the uncredited dog from \"Petticoat Junction\", two of the most popular roles he played during a 14-year career in show business.\n\nIn 1960, animal trainer Frank Inn found the dog at the Burbank Animal Shelter as a puppy. A fluffy black-and-tan mixed breed dog, he was marked like a Border Terrier, and Inn believed him to be a mix of Miniature Poodle, Cocker Spaniel, and Schnauzer.\n\nHiggins' career was facilitated by Frank Inn, who also trained Arnold Ziffel (the pig) and all of the other animals used on \"The Beverly Hillbillies\", \"Petticoat Junction\", \"Green Acres\", and \"The Waltons\" TV series. His on-set assistant trainers included Gerry Warshauer and Karl Miller.\n\nAs an actor, Higgins first came to national attention as the uncredited dog who played the character of \"Dog\" on the television sitcom \"Petticoat Junction\" for six of the show's seven seasons, from 1964 to 1970, appearing in 149 episodes. He guest-appeared on the television sitcom \"Green Acres\" with Eva Gabor in 1965 and also made a guest appearance on the television sitcom \"The Beverly Hillbillies\". He won a Patsy Award in 1967, and he was cover-featured on an issue of TV Guide magazine.\n\nHiggins was able to convey a broad range of emotions through his facial expressions. Inn, who trained thousands of animals of many species during his lifetime, told reporters that Higgins was the smartest dog he had ever worked with and noted that during his prime years in television, he learned one new trick or routine per week and retained these routines from year to year, making it possible for him to take on increasingly varied and complex roles. Higgins's tricks included yawning and sneezing on cue. Due to his work in \"Petticoat Junction\", Higgins received a PATSY Award in 1966 in the television category.\n\nIn 1971, Higgins starred in the film \"Mooch Goes to Hollywood\" with Zsa Zsa Gabor and Vincent Price. He came out of retirement at an estimated age of 16 to star in the 1974 feature film \"Benji\", which became his greatest commercial success.\nHiggins had a close rapport with the actor Edgar Buchanan, who played Uncle Joe Carson on \"Petticoat Junction.\" In the official cast pictures taken each year during the run of \"Petticoat Junction,\" Buchanan is shown holding or petting Higgins. Buchanan guest-starred on 17 episodes of the sitcom \"Green Acres\", and Higgins guest-starred in two of those appearances. Buchanan and Higgins crossed paths for the last time in \"Benji\", which was coincidentally also the last film that both actors starred in. The two actors had an obvious fondness for one another, which is especially clear in \"Benji,\" because the movie's naturalistic pacing allowed them to interact as friends rather than requiring that Higgins perform a specific trick for Buchanan to react to.\n\nFrank Inn and Higgins were very close in real life as well as on the job. Inn wrote a poem about the dog called \"My Little Brown Dog\".\n\nHiggins' progeny carried on his work in a continuing series of movies and television series featuring the Benji character, beginning with \"For the Love of Benji\" in 1977, in which Higgins' daughter Benjean inherited the role of Benji after Higgins' death.\n\nBenjean, who was also trained by Frank Inn, starred in more \"Benji\" movies than Higgins did because she was younger when she first took on the role. Benjean can be differentiated from Higgins by the fact that she was a female with no visible genitalia, and she had a large patch of white hairs on her muzzle around her nose, whereas Higgins was mostly black around his nose. In addition, Higgins’ bark was a deep, froggy sound, while Benjean had a higher-pitched, more traditional-sounding yelp. This is readily apparent when comparing \"Benji\" and \"For the Love of Benji\".\n\nConfusion between the two dogs was increased when VHS and DVD videos of the original \"Benji\" movie were released with pictures of Benjean on the cover.\n\nAlso, the dog \"Tramp\" from the TV series \"My Three Sons\" was one of Higgins' puppies; his real-life name was \"Mac\".\n\nHiggins died at age 17, just four weeks short of his 18th birthday. Inn had the dog's body cremated and saved the ashes in an urn on his mantelpiece. He then wrote a Christian poem in memory of Higgins called \"My Gift to Jesus\". Inn died in 2002 and requested that Higgins' ashes be buried in his coffin with him. This request was not fulfilled due to legal reasons, and Higgins' ashes remain with Inn's daughters. Inn is buried at Forest Lawn Memorial Park (Hollywood Hills).\n"}

{"id": "19697849", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19697849", "title": "Infidel", "text": "Infidel\n\nInfidel (literally \"unfaithful\") is a term used in certain religions for those accused of unbelief in the central tenets of their own religion, for members of another religion, or for the irreligious.\n\nInfidel is an ecclesiastical term in Christianity around which the Church developed a body of theology that deals with the concept of infidelity, which makes a clear differentiation between those who were baptized and followed the teachings of the Church versus those who are outside the faith. The term \"infidel\" was used by Christians to describe those perceived as the enemies of Christianity.\n\nAfter the ancient world the concept of otherness, an exclusionary notion of the outside by societies with more or less coherent cultural boundaries, became associated with the development of the monotheistic and prophetic religions of Judaism, Christianity and Islam (cf. pagan).\n\nIn modern literature, the term infidel includes in its scope atheists, polytheists, animists, heathens and pagans.\n\nA willingness to identify other religious people as infidels corresponds to preference for orthodoxy over pluralism.\n\nThe origins of the word infidel date to the late 15th century, deriving from the French \"infidèle\" or Latin \"īnfidēlis\", from \"in-\" \"not\" + \"fidēlis\" \"faithful\" (from \"fidēs\" \"faith\", related to \"fīdere\" 'to trust'). The word originally denoted a person of a religion other than one's own, especially a Christian to a Muslim, a Muslim to a Christian, or a gentile to a Jew. Later meanings in the 15th century include \"unbelieving\", \"a non-Christian\" and \"one who does not believe in religion\" (1527).\n\nChristians historically used the term infidel to refer to people who actively opposed Christianity. This term became well-established in English by sometime in the early sixteenth century, when Jews or Mohammedans (Muslims; formerly called saracens), were described contemptuously as active opponents to Christianity. In Catholic dogma, an infidel is one who does not believe in the doctrine at all and is thus distinct from a heretic, who has fallen away from true doctrine, i.e. by denying the divinity of Jesus. Similarly, the ecclesiastical term was also used by the Methodist Church, in reference to those \"without faith\".\n\nToday, the usage of the term infidel has declined; the current preference is for the terms \"non-Christians\" and \"non-believers\" (persons without religious affiliations or beliefs), reflecting the commitment of mainstream Christian denominations to engage in dialog with persons of other faiths. Nevertheless, some apologists have argued in favor of the term, stating that it does not come from a disrespectful perspective, but is similar to using the term \"orthodox\" for devout believers.\n\nMoreover, some translations of the Bible, including the King James Version, which is still in vogue today, employ the word \"infidel\", while others have supplanted the term with \"nonbeliever\". The term is found in two places:\n\nIn \"Quid super his\", Innocent IV, asked the question \"[I]s it licit to invade a land that infidels possess or which belongs to them?\" and held that while Infidels had a right to \"dominium\" (right to rule themselves and choose their own governments), however the pope, as the Vicar of Christ, \"de jure\" possessed the care of their souls and had the right to politically intervene in their affairs if their ruler violated or allowed his subjects to violate a Christian and Euro-centric normative conception of Natural law, such as sexual perversion or idolatry. He also held that he had an obligation to send missionaries to infidel lands, and that if they were prevented from entering or preaching, then the pope was justified in dispatching Christian forces accompanied with missionaries to invade those lands, as Innocent stated simply \"If the infidels do not obey, they ought to be compelled by the secular arm and war may be declared upon them by the pope, and nobody else.\" This was however not a reciprocal right and non-Christian missionaries such as those of Muslims could not be allowed to preach in Europe \"because they are in error and we are on a righteous path.\"\n\nA long line of Papal hierocratic canonists, most notably those who adhered to Alanus Anglicus's influential arguments of the Crusading-era, denied Infidel dominium, and asserted Rome's universal jurisdictional authority over the earth, and the right to authorize pagan conquests solely on the basis of non-belief because of their rejection of the Christian god. In the extreme hierocractic canonical discourse of the mid-twelfth century such as that espoused by Bernard of Clairvaux, the mystic leader of the Cisertcians, legitimized German colonial expansion and practice of forceful Christianisation in the Slavic territories as a holy war against the Wends, arguing that infidels should be killed wherever they posed a menace to Christians. When Frederick the II unilaterally arrogated papal authority, he took on the mantle to \"destroy convert, and subjugate all barbarian nations.\" A power in papal doctrine reserved for the pope. Hostiensis, a student of Innocent, in accord with Alanus, also asserted \"... by law infidels should be subject to the faithful.\" John Wyclif, regarded as the forefather of English Reformation, also held that valid \"dominium\" rested on a state of grace.\n\nThe Teutonic Knights were one of the by-products of this papal hierocratic and German discourse. After the Crusades in the Levant, they moved to crusading activities in the infidel Baltics. Their crusades against the Lithuanians and Poles however precipitated the Lithuanian Controversy, and the Council of Constance, following the condemnation of Wyclif, found Hostiensis's views no longer acceptable and ruled against the knights. Future Church doctrine was then firmly aligned with Innocents IV's position.\n\nThe development of counter arguments later on the validity of Papal authority, the rights of infidels and the primacy of natural law, led to various treatises such as those by Hugo Grotius, John Locke, Immanuel Kant and Thomas Hobbes, which in turn led to the transformation of international law's treatment of the relationship between Christian and non-Christian societies and the development of human rights.\n\nDuring the Age of Discovery, the papal bulls such as \"Romanus Pontifex\" and more importantly \"inter caetera\" (1493), implicitly removed \"dominium\" from infidels and granted them to the Spanish Empire and Portugal with the charter of guaranteeing the safety of missionaries. Subsequent English and French rejections of the bull rejected the Popes authority to exclude other Christian princes. As independent authorities such as the Head of the Church of England, they drew up charters for their own colonial missions based on the temporal right for care of infidel souls in language echoing the inter caetera. The charters and papal bulls would form the legal basis of future negotiations and consideration of claims as title deeds in the emerging Law of nations in the European colonization of the Americas.\n\nThe rights bestowed by \"Romanus Pontifex\" and \"inter caetera\" have never fallen from use, serving as the basis for legal arguments over the centuries. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in the 1823 case \"Johnson v. M'Intosh \"that as a result of European discovery and assumption of ultimate dominion, Native Americans had only a right to occupancy of native lands, not the right of title. This decision was upheld in the 1831 case \"Cherokee Nation v. Georgia\", giving Georgia authority to extend state laws over Cherokees within the state, and famously describing Native American tribes as \"domestic dependent nations.\" This decision was modified in \"Worcester v. Georgia\", which stated that the U.S. federal government, and not individual states, had authority in Indian affairs, but it maintained the loss of right to title upon discovery by Europeans.\n\nNative American groups including the Taíno and Onondaga have called on the Vatican to revoke the bulls of 1452, 1453, and 1493.\n\nAccording to the Catholic Encyclopedia, the Catholic Church views marriage as forbidden and null when conducted between the faithful (Christians) and infidels, unless a dispensation has been granted. This is because marriage is a sacrament of the Catholic Church, which infidels are deemed incapable of receiving.\n\nSome philosophers such as Thomas Paine, David Hume, George Holyoake, Charles Bradlaugh, Voltaire and Rousseau earned the label of infidel or freethinkers, both personally and for their respective traditions of thought because of their attacks on religion and opposition to the Church. They established and participated in a distinctly labeled, infidel movement or tradition of thought, that sought to reform their societies which were steeped in Christian thought, practice, laws and culture. The Infidel tradition was distinct from parallel anti-Christian, sceptic or deist movements, in that it was anti-theistic and also synonymous with atheism. These traditions also sought to set up various independent model communities, as well as societies, whose traditions then gave rise to various other socio-political movements such as secularism in 1851, as well as developing close philosophical ties to some contemporary political movements such as socialism and the French Revolution.\n\nTowards the early twentieth century, these movements sought to move away from the tag \"infidel\" because of its associate negative connotation in Christian thought, and is attributed to George Holyoake's coining the term 'secularism' in an attempt to bridge the gap with other theist and Christian liberal reform movements.\n\nIn 1793, Immanuel Kant's \"Religion within the Boundaries of Mere Reason\", reflected the Enlightenment periods' philosophical development, one which differentiated between the moral and rational and substituted rational/irrational for the original true believer/infidel distinction.\n\nLaws passed by the Catholic Church governed not just the laws between Christians and infidels in matters of religious affairs, but also civil affairs. They were prohibited from participating or aiding in infidel religious rites, such as circumcisions or wearing images of non-Christian religious significance.\n\nIn the Early Middle Ages, based on the idea of the superiority of Christians to infidels, regulations came into place such as those forbidding Jews from possessing Christian slaves; the laws of the decretals further forbade Christians from entering the service of Jews, for Christian women to act as their nurses or midwives; forbidding Christians from employing Jewish physicians when ill; restricting Jews to definite quarters of the towns into which they were admitted and to wear a dress by which they might be recognized.\n\nLater during the Victorian era, testimony of either self declared, or those accused of being Infidels or Atheists, was not accepted in a court of law because it was felt that they had no moral imperative to not lie under oath because they did not believe in God, or Heaven and Hell.\n\nThese rules have now given way to modern legislation and Catholics, in civil life, are no longer governed by ecclesiastical law.\n\nOne Arabic language analogue to \"infidel\", referring to non-Muslims, is \"kafir\" (sometimes \"kaafir\", \"kufr\" or \"kuffar\"; gâvur in Turkish,) from the root K-P-R, which connotes covering or concealing. Another term, sometimes used synonymously, is \"mushrik\", \"polytheist\" or \"conspirer\", which more immediately connotes the worship of gods other than Allah, and can also be translated as \"polytheist\".\n\nIn the Quran the term \"kafir\" is first applied to the unbelieving Meccans, and their attempts to refute and revile Muhammad. Later Muslims are ordered to keep apart from them, defend themselves from their attacks, and finally take the offensive against them. In some verses, particularly those recited after the Hijra in AD 622, the concept of \"kafir\" was expanded upon, with Jews and Christians included. The expanded term \"kafir\" refers to anyone who disbelieves in the religion of Islam, the one that mocks the religion of Islam, who does not regard the kafiroon as kaffirs, whoever believes one's teaching is more reliable and trustworthy than Muhammad's teachings, whoever hates something of Muhammad, whoever practices witchcraft, and whoever supports the kaffirs against the Muslims (in terms of war, harming, etc.). Jews were condemned as kafirs for their disbelief in God's \"ayah\", Christians were condemned as kafirs for their belief in the Trinity, which the Qur'an declared as major kufr (disbelief) (kufr akbar), which puts one outside of the pale of Islam (Surah al-Maa’idah – 5:116 for example).\n\nThe corpus of hadith deals with the fate of the kafir in the afterlife and reflects a major controversy in early Islam as to whether a Muslim should be considered a kafir for committing a major sin. Some hadiths prohibit declaring a Muslim to be a kafir, but the term was nonetheless fairly frequent in the internal religious polemics of the age.\n\nSome texts of Sunni sect of Islam include other sects of Islam such as Shia as infidel. Certain sects of Islam, such as Wahhabism, include as kafir those Muslims who undertake Sufi shrine pilgrimage and follow Shia teachings about Imams. Similarly, in Africa and South Asia, certain sects of Islam such as Hausas, Ahmadi, Akhbaris have been repeatedly declared as Kufir or infidels by other sects of Muslims.\n\nIn the Quran the term \"people of the book\" refers to Jews, Christians, and Sabians. Some scholars claim Islam considers Jews and Christians as fellow believers. They are called the \"People of the Book (\"Ahl al-kitab\")\". Other Islamic scholars and literature, however, consider Jews and Christians as kafirs. The class of \"kafir\" also includes the category of \"murtadd\", variously translated as apostate or renegades, for whom classical jurisprudence prescribes death if they refuse to return to Islam. On the subject of ritual impurity of unbelievers, one finds a range of opinions, \"from the strictest to the most tolerant\", in classical jurisprudence.\n\nHistorically, the attitude toward unbelievers in Islam was determined more by socio-political conditions than by religious doctrine. A tolerance toward unbelievers \"impossible to imagine in contemporary Christendom\" prevailed even to the time of the Crusades, particularly with respect to the People of the Book. However, animosity was nourished by repeated wars with unbelievers, and warfare between Safavid Persia and Ottoman Turkey brought about application of the term \"kafir\" even to Persians in Turkish fatwas.\n\nLike \"infidel\", the term kafir has developed into a term of abuse. \"In theory\" a Muslim commits a punishable offense if he says to a Christian or a Jew: \"thou unbeliever\".\n\nIn Sufism the term underwent a special development, as in a well-known verse of Abu Sa'id: \"So long as belief and unbelief are not perfectly equal, no man can be a true Muslim\", which has prompted various explanations.\n\nJudaism has a notion of pagan gentiles who are called \"<nowiki>'</nowiki>acum\", an acronym of Ovdei Cohavim u-Mazzaloth or, literally, \"star-and-constellation worshippers\".\n\nThe Hebrew term, \"kofer\", cognate with the Arabic \"kafir\", is reserved only for apostate Jews.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "7405676", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7405676", "title": "Isaac Albalag", "text": "Isaac Albalag\n\nIsaac Albalag () was a Jewish philosopher of the second half of the 13th century.\n\nAccording to Steinschneider (\"Hebr. Uebers\". pp. 299–306), Albalag probably lived in northern Spain or southern France. Graetz makes him a native of southern Spain. His liberal views, especially his interpretations of the Biblical account of the Creation in accordance with the Aristotelian theory of the eternity of the world, stamped him in the eyes of many as a heretic.\n\nApart from this, he showed little originality, and was eclectic in tendency. This is illustrated by the fact that though he was an unreserved follower of Aristotle, he showed a leaning toward the Kabbalah, the excesses of which, however, he energetically opposed, especially the redaction of Biblical interpretations based on the assumed numerical values of the letters (Gematria). His most characteristic work was a translation (1292) of a part of Al-Ghazali's \"Maqasid al-Falasifa\" (\"Aims of the Philosophers\"), which embraces only two parts of the original; namely, logic and metaphysics.\n\nAlbalag did not confine himself therein to the work of a translator, but often corrected the views of other philosophers as formulated by Al-Ghazali, who intended to refute them himself in his later work entitled \"Tahafut al-Falasifa\" (\"Incoherence of the Philosophers\"). Albalag remarked that Al-Ghazali did not refute the philosophers but rather his own errors, into which he had fallen by obtaining information not from Aristotle himself, but from his commentators, such as Ibn Sina (Avicenna) and others. According to Albalag, this charge applies also to Maimonides when attempting to refute Aristotle, as, for instance, on the eternity of the world.\n\nIn the composition of his work Albalag made it his main object to counteract the widespread popular prejudice that philosophy was undermining the foundation of religion. Religion and philosophy would, for Albalag, agree on the fundamental principles of all positive religion — which are : \"the belief in reward and punishment, in immortality, in the existence of a just God, and in Divine Providence\" (which, of course, doesn't take into account any of previous materialistic philosophies, such as those of Diogenes or Democrites..). \n\nReligions, as well as philosophy, follow the same aim; namely, to render mankind happy. It is, no doubt, quite true that philosophy, which addresses itself to the individual, differs in its mode of establishing those truths from religion, which appeals to the great masses. Philosophy demonstrates; religion only teaches.\n\nAlbalag, however, by no means asserts that the doctrines of the philosophers must entirely coincide with those of religion; and it is exactly in his conception of their mutual relation that his peculiar standpoint manifests itself. The idea, already expressed by Maimonides, that the naked philosophical truth is often harmful for the masses, and that therefore the Holy Scriptures had often to adapt themselves to the intellectual level of the people, was so strongly emphasized by him that it is probable he was influenced by Ibn Rushd (Averroes), who made this idea the central point of his book \"Theology and Philosophy\" — \"therefore, he errs doubly who rejects a philosophical truth on account of its apparent contradiction of Scripture: first, because he misses the true meaning of Scripture; second, because thereby he declares the real arguments of philosophy to be inconclusive.\"\n\nIn cases where an adjustment is absolutely impossible, Albalag brings forward a very strange solution; namely, that the teaching of the philosopher is true from the speculative standpoint, and at the same time the utterance of Scripture is true from a higher, supernatural point of view — the philosophical mode of knowledge being altogether different from the prophetic. And as the philosopher is only intelligible to his compeers, so the prophet can be understood only by prophets. This view resembles the theory of double truth (the theological and the philosophical), originated and chiefly developed in the 13th century at the University of Paris (Lange, \"Gesch. des Materialismus\", 3d ed., i. 181).\n\nThere is no evidence, however, of any direct influence of the Parisian thinkers on Albalag, as he could have come to his view by a more natural process; viz., by combining the two opposite influences of Ibn Roshd and Al-Gazzali, whose idea of the difference between philosophical and prophetical knowledge is at the bottom of the latter's work, the \"Munkid\". Accepting these two influences, the view of the double truth necessarily follows. It may be added that Albalag interpreted the Biblical account of the Creation as signifying that the six days represent the relative order of things, while he conceives the seventh day as pointing to the world of ideals.\n\n"}

His parents were Methodists, his father a jurist who designed him for the law. His mother, however, who had been converted under Garrettson, devoted John at birth to the ministry. His eldest son Robert, born in 1814, became a professor of Latin and Greek at Dickinson College in 1836 and later its president. In 1841 he published a biography of his father, \"Life of the Rev. John Emory\".\n\nHe was educated by tutors at Easton and Lancaster, Pennsylvania, and in Washington College, Chestertown, Maryland. He experienced \"saving grace\" at a Quarterly Meeting in 1806. He studied law in 1805 in the office of Judge R.T. Earle, Centreville, Maryland, and was admitted to the bar in 1808. But his attention soon turned to the pulpit, against his father's protests, and he entered the Traveling Ministry of the Philadelphia Annual Conference of the M.E. Church in 1810.\n\nEmory became well known, and his services were much in demand throughout the Middle States. He was elected a Member of the General Conference of 1816, and then to each succeeding General Conference (with one exception) through 1832 (when he was elected to the Episcopacy). He was sent as a delegate to the British Wesleyan Conference in 1820. He was appointed Book Agent and Editor for the M.E. Church in 1824, with offices in New York City. While a bishop, he continued his interest in the Book Concern, and during his management thereof was successful in paying-off all its debts, returning it to a solid foundation.\n\nHe was especially active in promoting the improvement of the literature of the M. E. Church. For example, he founded the \"Methodist Quarterly Review,\" nearly all the original articles in the first two volumes being from his own pen. He was prominent in the founding of the New York University and of Wesleyan University, and was one of the principal organizers of Dickinson College as a Methodist school. He was an able debater. In 1817 in a pamphlet controversy, he used his literary weapons, not unsuccessfully, against Bishop White of the Protestant Episcopal Church. In the controversy of 1828 which led to the founding of the Methodist Protestant Church he was the chief defender of existing M.E. polity. He was of a logical turn of mind, and had command of a pure, clear, and vigorous style. As a Bishop he was largely influential in giving the \"Methodist Episcopal Book of Discipline\" its present form.\n\nBishop Emory died in an 1835 carriage accident near his Maryland home. The next year, Methodists chartered both Emory College (later University) at Oxford, Georgia and Emory & Henry College in southwestern Virginia. (The co-eponym for the latter is Patrick Henry.) Both maintain their Methodist associations.\n\nBishop Emory is buried at Mount Olivet Cemetery in Baltimore near the graves of Bishops Francis Asbury and Beverly Waugh.\n\nEmory United Methodist Church in New Oxford, PA, erected in 1887, was named for him after he helped to establish the Emory Sunday School during the church's early years - between 1832 and 1835.\n\nUniversity of the Pacific named one of the College Park neighborhood streets in San Jose \"Emory Street\" in his honor.\n\n\n\nAttribution\n\n"}

The satirized depiction of Soubise, \"A Mungo Macaroni\", is a relic of intersectionality between race, class, and gender in eighteenth century London. His life of luxury as a free man of color allowed him to excel in elite activities such as fencing and made him notorious in London’s social scene as an exception to norms. \n\nSoubise was born on St. Kitts island in the Caribbean, the son of a Jamaican slave woman. He was bought by Royal Navy Captain Stair Douglas and taken to England, enslaved, at ten years old under the name Othello. In 1764, he was given to Catherine Douglas, Duchess of Queensberry, Captain Douglas' relative and an eccentric emblem of London's high society, who manumitted him. He was renamed after a French duke, Charles de Rohan, by the Duchess. She gave Soubise a privileged life, treating him as if he were her own son – apparently with her husband Charles Douglas, 3rd Duke of Queensberry's blessing.\n\nTrained by Domenico Angelo (whom Soubise also regularly accompanied as usher to Eton and Windsor), Soubise became the riding and fencing master to the Duchess. He became a popular acquaintance among young noblemen and rose as a figure in upper-class social circles, becoming the member of many fashionable clubs such as the Thatched House Club. The personal favour and patronage of the Duchess allowed Soubise a lifestyle of socializing and fashion. He would sometimes style himself as \"Prince Ana-Ana-maboe\" or \"The Black Prince\", and claiming to be African royalty. It was rumoured that his relationship with the Duchess developed into a sexual one.\n\nIn the collected letters of the famous freed slave Ignatius Sancho, Letter XIIII (dated October 11, 1771) is addressed to Soubise, whom Sancho encourages to consider his lucky position as an unusually privileged black person and so live a more seemly life.\n\nHowever, on July 15, 1777, Soubise fled Britain for India. Historical accounts dispute whether he was sent away simply to amend his debauchery or to evade a rape accusation from a maid of the Duchess’. The Duchess died two days after his departure. In India, he founded a fencing and riding school in Calcutta, Bengal which he advertised as open to men and women students. On August 25, 1798, Soubise fell while attempting to break in a horse, the injury causing his death . He was the father of two known children, Mary and William Soubise, with an unnamed mother.\n\nJulius Soubise is featured in the short animation entitled \"The Swordsman of Trelawny\".\n\nSoubise became socially prominent enough to become the subject of several caricatures. Most notably, Soubise is attributed as the muse for \"A Mungo Macaroni\" (published September 10, 1772), part of a famous 1771–1773 satirical series of engravings depicting fashionable young men, published by Matthew and Mary Darly. The term \"macaroni\" was a contemporary name for a fashionable young man, a dandy, while \"Mungo\" was a name of an officious slave from the 1769 comic opera \"The Padlock\" by Isaac Bickerstaffe. In previous contexts, use of the term “mungo” was often aimed towards luxury slaves, an application of the character to those treated theatrically like elite’s pets. Applying the epithet to Soubise in combination with “macaroni” was intended to mock the identity he had assumed for himself.\n\nWilliam Austin's well-known satirical print, \"The Duchess of Queensbury and Soubise\" (published May 1, 1773) shows the pair engaged in a fencing match. Austin’s engraving was based on illustrations of fencing compiled by the Angelo fencing dynasty, combined with accounts of Soubise from Henry Angelo’s memoir. These accounts were satirized by Austin in a way which addresses Soubise and the duchess’ uncustomary relationship, depicting Soubise as Mungo the servant. In the print, text shows Soubise saying, \"“Mungo here, Mungo dere, Mungo every where; Above and below. Hah! Vat your gracy tink of me now?,”\" direct lines from the Mungo character. This work has reappeared historically under several titles, including  “The Eccentric Duchess of Queensbury fencing with her protégé the Creole Soubise (otherwise ‘Mungo’)” and “The Duchess of Queensberry playing at foils with her favorite Lap Dog Mungo after Expending near £10,000 to make him a—.”\n\nIn his work as an actor, Soubise is suggested to have had runs in the role of Othello as well as the character Mungo from \"The Padlock,\" characters historically most often played by white actors in blackface. However, such reports come from Hicky's Bengal Gazette, which could have posited this satirically to mock his Soubise's status. Soubise was strongly associated with these characters throughout his time in the elite social sphere, labeled by others because he was a black actor, punctuated by his depiction in \"A Mungo Macaroni\".\n\nSoubise received instruction in the privileged accomplishments of riding and fencing, taught by fencing master Domenico Angelo per Duchess Douglas’ connections. He was also known as an amateur violinist, singer and actor – he was taught oration by the famous actor David Garrick.\n\nSoubise’s styles were likened to other fops of the time, often characterized by the French influence he also granted his namesake. \"A Mungo Macaroni\" depicts Soubise sporting a luxurious hat, ruffles, a cane, and an adorned sword. He was known to wear large powdered wigs, fine fabrics such as silk, and styles fitted tight to his body. There are also accounts of him wearing diamond-buckled shoes with red heels. Such styles meant Soubise and other fops were associated with effeminacy and excess, supported by the caricatures, but Soubise also assumed a unique black identity that could be associated with extravagance.  \n\n"}

A mode of action should not be confused with mechanism of action, which refer to the biochemical processes underlying a given mode of action. Modes of toxic action are important, widely used tools in ecotoxicology and aquatic toxicology because they classify toxicants or pollutants according to their type of toxic action. There are two major types of modes of toxic action: non-specific acting toxicants and specific acting toxicants. Non-specific acting toxicants are those that produce narcosis, while specific acting toxicants are those that are non-narcotic and that produce a specific action at a specific target site.\n\n result in narcosis; therefore, narcosis is a mode of toxic action. Narcosis is defined as a generalized depression in biological activity due to the presence of toxicant molecules in the organism. The target site and mechanism of toxic action through which narcosis affects organisms are still unclear, but there are hypotheses that support that it occurs through alterations in the cell membranes at specific sites of the membranes, such as the lipid layers or the proteins bound to the membranes. Even though continuous exposure to a narcotic toxicant can produce death, if the exposure to the toxicant is stopped, narcosis can be reversible.\n\nToxicants that at low concentrations modify or inhibit some biological process by binding at a specific site or molecule have a specific acting mode of toxic action. However, at high enough concentrations, toxicants with specific acting modes of toxic actions can produce narcosis that may or may not be reversible. Nevertheless, the specific action of the toxicant is always shown first because it requires lower concentrations.\n\nThere are several specific acting modes of toxic action:\n\nThe pioneer work of identifying the major categories of modes of toxic action (see description above) was conducted by investigators from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) at the Duluth Laboratory using fish, reason why they named the categories as \"\" (FATS). They proposed the FATS by assessing the behavioral and physiological responses of the fish when subjected to toxicity tests, such as locomotive activities, body color, ventilation patterns, cough rate, heart rate, and others.\n\nIt has been proposed that modes of toxic action could be estimated by developing a data set of critical body residues (CBR). The CBR is the whole-body concentration of a chemical that is associated with a given adverse biological response and it is estimated using a partition coefficient and a bioconcentration factor. The whole-body residues are reasonable first approximations of the amount of chemical present at the toxic action site(s). Because different modes of toxic action generally appear to be associated with different ranges of body residues, modes of toxic action can then be separated into categories. However, it is unlikely that every chemical has the same mode of toxic action in every organism, so this variability should be considered. The effects of mixture toxicity should be considered as well, even though mixture toxicity it's generally additive, chemicals with more than one mode of toxic action may contribute to toxicity.\n\nModeling has become a common used tool to predict modes of toxic action in the last decade. The models are based in Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationships (QSARs), which are mathematical models that relate the biological activity of molecules to their chemical structures and corresponding chemical and physicochemical properties. QSARs can then predict modes of toxic action of unknown compounds by comparing its characteristic toxicity profile and chemical structure to reference compounds with known toxicity profiles and chemical structures. Russom and colleagues were one of the first group of researchers being able to classify modes of toxic action with the use of QSARs; they classified 600 chemicals as narcotics. Even though QSARs are a useful tool for predicting modes of toxic action, chemicals having multiple modes of toxic action can obscure QSAR analyses. Therefore, these models are continuously being developed.\n\nThe objective of environmental risk assessment is to protect the environment from adverse effects. Researchers are further developing QSAR models with the ultimate goal providing a clear insight about a mode of toxic action, but also about what the actual target site is, the concentration of the chemical at this target site, and the interaction occurring at the target site, as well as to predict the modes of toxic action in mixtures. Information on the mode of toxic action is crucial not only in understanding joint toxic effects and potential interactions between chemicals in mixtures, but also for developing assays for the evaluation of complex mixtures in the field.\n\nThe combination of behavioral and physiological responses, CBR estimates, and chemical fate and bioaccumulation QSAR models can be a powerful regulatory tool to address pollution and toxicity in areas where effluents are discharged.\n"}

Many cultures expect mourners to curtail certain activities, usually those considered frivolous or that are accompanied by expressions of joy.\n\nHistorically, some cultures have employed professional mourners to make a public showing of grief to honor the deceased (particularly those in the Near East).\n\nTraced back to the year of 1877, it has been recorded that there is a business entailed with hiring or renting mourners for a funeral. It is said that a funeral with an abundance of mourners makes the deceased appear to have lived a well life. This leads people into renting mourners to show up at their funeral. The mourners are actors who are paid by the hour to mourn in the crowd. Before the funeral, the actors are informed about the deceased and the life that they lived. They are told about the life of the deceased so that they can casually talk to the crowd about as if they really knew them. It is even tradition in the African countries, Middle Eastern countries, and China to hire mourners. It is even recorded that in China mourners are hired to belly dance and put on a theatrical spectacle at the funeral.\n"}

She accepted a lift from a lorry driver at the Chieveley services on the M4 in Chieveley, Berkshire, on 19 December, but never arrived at her destination. Following an appeal for information on her whereabouts and police enquiries, her body was discovered on 29 December, at a lay-by on the A449 in Hawford, Worcestershire. A post-mortem examination determined she had been strangled and bludgeoned to death.\n\nThe case received extensive news coverage in the UK around the Christmas and New Year period, amid fears that it could be linked to a series of killings around the English Midlands, which police called the work of a \"Midlands Ripper\". The murder investigation included the UK's first national DNA screening programme in the hunt for a murder suspect, covering over 5,000 people.\n\nStuart William Morgan, a 36-year-old lorry driver from Poole, Dorset, was arrested in February 1996 after a colleague recognised his image from a photofit. Morgan was later charged with Figard's murder, and convicted in October. Detectives concluded that after raping, strangling and bludgeoning her, he carried her body in his vehicle for ten days over the Christmas period before dumping it. Morgan was given a life sentence, with a recommendation to serve at least twenty years. An appeal in February 1998 was rejected by the Court of Appeal, and in 2009 the High Court turned down his application for a review of the length of his sentence. He became eligible for parole in February 2016, and has continued to maintain his innocence.\n\nFigard was buried in the French village of Scey-sur-Saône-et-Saint-Albin, Haute-Saône, at a service attended by her family, friends and politicians in January 1996. In the UK, she is remembered in a memorial garden established at a church in the Worcestershire village of Ombersley, close to where her body was discovered.\n\nCéline Figard was born on 23 May 1976 in Besançon, France, to Martine and Bernard Figard. She had two brothers, Stephane and Nicolas, and a sister, Karine. At the time of her death, she was studying accountancy at the Lycée le Grand Chênois in Montbéliard. She developed a fondness for the United Kingdom following a 1990 visit and travelled there repeatedly.\nFigard spent the summer of 1995 working at a hotel in Fordingbridge, Hampshire, where her cousin Jean-Marc was head waiter, using the opportunity to improve her English. She returned to the UK in December to spend another two weeks with Jean-Marc. After leaving on Monday, 18 December, she travelled with a family friend employed by a local haulage firm to the French coast, as arranged by her parents, and crossed the English Channel the following day, arriving in Ashford, Kent. She intended to travel to Fordingbridge by train; her escort found another French lorry driver, Roger Bouvier, who was willing to take her to Chieveley Services near Newbury, Berkshire.\n\nWhen they arrived, Figard tried to phone Jean-Marc to ask him to pick her up, but misdialed. She was offered a lift to Salisbury by the driver of a white Mercedes lorry. Bouvier had reservations about the driver, but let her go with him nonetheless. Figard left the service station with the driver at around 4:30 pm. She never arrived at her destination, and was reported missing.\n\nPolice appealed for information about her disappearance, and issued a photofit of the lorry driver, but he was not identified. By 25 December, investigators were working on the theory that he had abducted her. The following day, investigators were working on the assumption she had been murdered. Figard's father travelled to the UK to help detectives in their search for her and to appeal to the public for information as to her whereabouts.\n\nOn the morning of Friday, 29 December, the naked body of a young woman was found dumped at a lay-by on the A449 near the Worcestershire village of Hawford by a motorist who had stopped to change a windscreen wiper. Police sought to establish her identity, but were sure it was not that of Louise Smith, an 18-year-old clerical assistant who had vanished early on Christmas Day after attending a nightclub at Yate, Gloucestershire. Smith's body was discovered in February 1996 in Chipping Sodbury, South Gloucestershire.\n\nThe body was positively identified as that of Figard the following day. The post mortem determined she had been strangled and bludgeoned with a heavy implement, but did not establish which was fatal. The autopsy revealed \"no obvious signs\" of sexual assault, but it was determined that sexual intercourse had taken place shortly before her death, and detectives believed it had occurred against her will. Police said that the body had been lying where it was found for about twenty-four hours and were working on the theory that she had been held captive before being killed. Detective Chief Superintendent Roger Hoddinott of Hampshire Police said at the time of discovery, Figard had been dead for at least four to five days, but did not announce a time of death.\n\nThe investigation was led by DCS John McCammont of West Mercia Police, and involved more than 100 detectives from three police forces. Officers examined similar unsolved murders amid concerns that they could all be the work of the same individual. Of particular interest were the recent murders of Tracey Turner and Samo Paull, whose bodies were also found on motorways after they had been strangled. McCammont ruled out a link at a press conference on 4 January: \"I would stress that at this stage there is no firm evidence whatsoever to link Céline's murder with any other investigations.\" He appealed for information concerning a bottle of Pascal Chretien champagne, a gift given to Figard before she came to England: \"This particular type of champagne is not exported to anywhere in the world outside France and is not sold in this country. It is a 1993 vintage and only 60,000 bottles have been produced.\"\n\nOn 12 January 1996, investigators announced that they would perform DNA testing on the drivers of all vehicles similar to the Mercedes. This was the first time the method was used nationally to identify a murder suspect. Detectives traced more than 1,000 vehicles and tested 5,000 drivers. On 19 February, West Mercia Police confirmed that a man had been arrested and was helping them with their inquiries. The following day, authorities announced that the suspect was English and had been arrested in Poole, Dorset in a joint operation between West Mercia and Dorset Police. He was subsequently identified as Stuart Morgan, a 36-year-old self-employed lorry driver, who on 21 February was remanded following an appearance at Redditch magistrates.\n\nStuart William Morgan is an English lorry driver and former heating engineer from Poole. One of five children of John and Julianne Morgan, he was raised in Tunbridge Wells, Kent, where his father was employed as a council foreman and his mother – a refugee from the former East Germany – worked as a school cleaner. Morgan left school with three CSEs, and in 1974 served a custodial sentence in borstal following a conviction for burglary. After attending Croydon Polytechnic to train as a plumber and heating engineer, he established a plumbing business in the Tunbridge Wells area. He moved to Dorset following the failure of that business in 1983 and worked as a heating engineer for Bournemouth Borough Council. He became a lorry driver in 1991.\n\nMorgan met his first wife in Kent in the early 1980s. They married in 1982, but he left her when she became pregnant with twins. He met another woman after moving to Dorset. She also became pregnant, giving birth to a son, and they married in 1994, after living together for several years. Morgan had a reputation as a womaniser, seducing customers while working as an engineer. He continued this activity after becoming a lorry driver. Following his conviction, his brother Ray Morgan said, \"He has had so many affairs over the years I have lost count.\" He also had a violent temper. One friend, Dave Moemken, described him as being \"on a short fuse\".\n\nMorgan was driving from Leeds to Southampton Docks when he picked up Figard on 19 December 1995. Detectives concluded that after raping and killing her, Morgan left her body in the bottom bunk of his cab for up to ten days while he continued to drive the lorry, driving and sleeping in it for at least some of that time, before disposing of the body on 29 December. He was arrested in February 1996 after another lorry driver recognised him from a photofit. Morgan initially denied meeting her, but after he was picked out at an identity parade, he claimed he and Figard had met and engaged in consensual sex.\n\nThe trial began at Worcester Crown Court on 2 October 1996, before Mr Justice Latham and a jury. Morgan's trial counsel was Nigel Jones QC, and the case was prosecuted by David Farrer QC. Morgan denied the charge.\nThe prosecution account was that Morgan raped and killed Figard on the afternoon or evening of 19 December 1995, then kept her body in his cab for ten days before disposing of it. Farrer told the court that she had been strangled and battered around the head with a heavy object, and injuries to her face were \"consistent with kicking and stamping\". There was also evidence to suggest her hands had been taped together, with the prosecution of the opinion she had been \"intimidated\" into having sex.\n\nEvidence was presented by the prosecution to suggest that Morgan continued to use the vehicle while Figard's body lay in the cab, and that the lorry was parked outside his house over the Christmas period. Farrer said Morgan bought a spade, axe and hacksaw with the intention of dismembering the body, but changed his mind, instead making an overnight delivery run to dispose of it. After removing a fuse from his lorry's tachograph to conceal the journey, he drove to Worcestershire. Discrepancies were subsequently found in his travel records for 29 December 1995 because he forgot to replace the fuse following the trip. DNA tests on spots of blood found in the cab matched Figard, while a blood-soaked mattress was found in Morgan's garage. Several items belonging to Figard, including photographs and a toilet bag, were recovered from his house. Some of her clothing was found close to a warehouse he had visited the night the body was dumped. Morgan gave two bottles of Pascal Chretien that Figard had brought to England as Christmas presents to two garage attendants who worked at a Shell station opposite his house.\n\nMorgan admitted giving Figard a lift on the afternoon of 19 December 1995. He claimed that the pair had consensual sex after chatting and flirting, developing a rapport and halting at a lay-by where he made her a cup of tea and asked her for what he described as a \"Christmas kiss\". He said afterwards he drove her to Southampton, where they exchanged contact details before he left her, and that she was \"smiling and happy\". He did not come forward after police appealed for details of the driver who had given her a lift because he did not want his wife to learn of his infidelity. He claimed her photographs and other belongings were in his possession because she had left them in his truck, and the mattress had become stained with blood because a man had lain on it after gashing his leg while the vehicle was on loan to another driver in 1994.\n\nOn 16 October, a jury took three and a half hours to convict Morgan of Figard's murder, and he was sentenced to life imprisonment with a recommendation that the Home Secretary should decide his parole eligibility. Passing sentence, Mr Justice Latham said, \"What you did to Céline has caused revulsion in the minds of all right-thinking people. You are a dangerous man and I will so report to the Home Secretary.\" Latham subsequently set a minimum term of twenty years, which was later endorsed by the Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales, Lord Bingham, and on 4 November 1998, the Home Secretary informed Morgan of the length of the sentence he must serve.\n\nMorgan appealed his conviction on the grounds that it was unfair due to the level of publicity the case had received. His application was rejected by the Court of Appeal of England and Wales on 5 February 1998 after the three sitting judges ruled there were insufficient grounds to justify an appeal.\n\nIn January 2009, Morgan appealed again under paragraph 3 of Schedule 22 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003 to the High Court of England and Wales requesting a review of the minimum term recommendation. This too was rejected, in July of that year, with the presiding judge, Mr Justice Openshaw recommending, \"The sentence is – and remains – a sentence of imprisonment for life. The defendant may not even be considered for release until he has served at least 20 years (less the time served before sentence). That is not to say that he will then be released; indeed he will be detained unless and until the Parole Board is satisfied that he no longer presents a risk to the public. Even if the Parole Board decides then or at some time in the future to authorise his release, he will be upon licence which will extend for the rest of his life.\"\n\nIn January 2016, Morgan appealed against the Ministry of Justice after it decided not to downgrade his prisoner status from that of a Category A prisoner, as well as challenging the Parole Board for refusing to allow him an oral hearing. A hearing at the High Court on 26 January was told that under the terms of his sentence, Morgan would be eligible for parole from February, but had continued to maintain his innocence throughout his time in prison, claiming to be in a \"Catch-22\" situation where he could not qualify for release without admitting his guilt. Rejecting Morgan's case, Justice William Davis suggested that Morgan had not \"addressed his offending behaviour\" and was \"in effect in the same position as in December 1995, when he murdered his victim\".\n\nFigard's body was flown home to France on 17 January 1996, where her funeral was held on 20 January. She was buried in Scey-sur-Saône-et-Saint-Albin. \"The Mail on Sunday\" reported that the ceremony was attended by 3,000 mourners, including family, friends and French politicians.\n\nA memorial garden dedicated to Figard was planted at St Andrew's Church in the village of Ombersley, Worcestershire, close to where her body was found, and opened at a ceremony in June 1997. Local residents raised more than £1,000 to help with its construction. The garden also remembers other victims of violent crime, including Joanna Parrish and Caroline Dickinson, two English students who were murdered in France. On 29 December 2000, the fifth anniversary of the date Figard's body was recovered, the local newspaper, the \"Worcester News\" reported that an annual service of remembrance was held for her at the church during the autumn, attended by her parents. Flowers were also regularly placed at the lay-by at Hawford where she was found, and the location named \"Le Jardin de Céline\" (Céline's Garden) in her memory.\n\n"}

This type of action highlights the desires of an individual or group that feels that something needs to change to improve the current condition of the resisting person or group. It is largely but wrongly taken as synonymous with civil resistance. Each of these terms—\"nonviolent resistance\" and \"civil resistance\"—has different connotations and commitments.\n\nMajor nonviolent resistance advocates include Mahatma Gandhi, Henry David Thoreau, Te Whiti o Rongomai, Tohu Kākahi, Leo Tolstoy, Alice Paul, Martin Luther King, Jr, Daniel Berrigan, Philip Berrigan, James Bevel, Václav Havel, Andrei Sakharov, Lech Wałęsa, Gene Sharp, Nelson Mandela, and many others. There are hundreds of books and papers on the subject—see Further reading below.\n\nFrom 1966 to 1999, nonviolent civic resistance played a critical role in fifty of sixty-seven transitions from authoritarianism. Recently, nonviolent resistance has led to the Rose Revolution in Georgia and the Jasmine Revolution in Tunisia. Current nonviolent resistance includes the Jeans Revolution in Belarus, the Black Lives Matter movement in the United States, and the fight of the Cuban dissidents.\nMany movements which promote philosophies of nonviolence or pacifism have pragmatically adopted the methods of nonviolent action as an effective way to achieve social or political goals. They employ nonviolent resistance tactics such as: information warfare, picketing, marches, vigils, leafletting, samizdat, magnitizdat, satyagraha, protest art, protest music and poetry, community education and consciousness raising, lobbying, tax resistance, civil disobedience, boycotts or sanctions, legal/diplomatic wrestling, underground railroads, principled refusal of awards/honors, and general strikes. Nonviolent action differs from pacifism by potentially being proactive and interventionist.\n\nA great deal of work has addressed the factors that lead to violent mobilization, but less attention has been paid to understanding why disputes become violent or nonviolent, comparing these two as strategic choices relative to conventional politics.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Thereafter, \"Pioneer 10\" became the first of five artificial objects to achieve the escape velocity that will allow them to leave the Solar System. This space exploration project was conducted by the NASA Ames Research Center in California, and the space probe was manufactured by TRW Inc.\n\n\"Pioneer 10\" was assembled around a hexagonal bus with a diameter parabolic dish high-gain antenna, and the spacecraft was spin stabilized around the axis of the antenna. Its electric power was supplied by four radioisotope thermoelectric generators that provided a combined 155 watts at launch.\n\nIt was launched on March 2, 1972, by an Atlas-Centaur expendable vehicle from Cape Canaveral, Florida. Between July 15, 1972, and February 15, 1973, it became the first spacecraft to traverse the asteroid belt. Photography of Jupiter began November 6, 1973, at a range of , and a total of about 500 images were transmitted. The closest approach to the planet was on December 4, 1973, at a range of . During the mission, the on-board instruments were used to study the asteroid belt, the environment around Jupiter, the solar wind, cosmic rays, and eventually the far reaches of the Solar System and heliosphere.\n\nRadio communications were lost with \"Pioneer 10\" on January 23, 2003, because of the loss of electric power for its radio transmitter, with the probe at a distance of from Earth.\n\nIn the 1960s, American aerospace engineer Gary Flandro of the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory conceived of a mission, known as the Planetary Grand Tour, that would exploit a rare alignment of the outer planets of the Solar System. This mission would ultimately be accomplished in the late 1970s by the two Voyager probes, but in order to prepare for it, NASA decided in 1964 to experiment with launching a pair of probes to the outer Solar System. An advocacy group named the Outer Space Panel and chaired by American space scientist James A. Van Allen, worked out the scientific rationale for exploring the outer planets. NASA Goddard Spaceflight Center put together a proposal for a pair of \"Galactic Jupiter Probes\" that would pass through the asteroid belt and visit Jupiter. These were to be launched in 1972 and 1973 during favorable windows that occurred only a few weeks every 13 months. Launch during other time intervals would have been more costly in terms of propellant requirements.\n\nApproved by NASA in February 1969, the twin spacecraft were designated Pioneer F and Pioneer G before launch; later they were named \"Pioneer 10\" and \"Pioneer 11\". They formed part of the Pioneer program, a series of United States unmanned space missions launched between 1958 and 1978. This model was the first in the series to be designed for exploring the outer Solar System. Based on multiple proposals issued throughout the 1960s, the early mission objectives were to explore the interplanetary medium past the orbit of Mars, study the asteroid belt and assess the possible hazard to spacecraft traveling through the belt, and explore Jupiter and its environment. Later development-stage objectives included the probe closely approaching Jupiter to provide data on the effect the environmental radiation surrounding Jupiter would have on the spacecraft instruments.\n\nMore than 150 scientific experiments were proposed for the missions. The experiments to be carried on the spacecraft were selected in a series of planning sessions during the 1960s, then were finalized by early 1970. These would be to perform imaging and polarimetry of Jupiter and several of its satellites, make infrared and ultraviolet observations of Jupiter, detect asteroids and meteoroids, determine the composition of charged particles, and to measure magnetic fields, plasma, cosmic rays and the Zodiacal Light. Observation of the spacecraft communications as it passed behind Jupiter would allow measurements of the planetary atmosphere, while tracking data would improve estimates of the mass of Jupiter and its moons.\n\nNASA Ames Research Center, rather than Goddard, was selected to manage the project as part of the Pioneer program. The Ames Research Center, under the direction of Charles F. Hall, was chosen because of its previous experience with spin-stabilized spacecraft. The requirements called for a small, lightweight spacecraft which was magnetically clean and which could perform an interplanetary mission. It was to use spacecraft modules that had already been proven in the Pioneer 6 through 9 missions.Ames commissioned a documentary film by George Van Valkenburg titled \"Jupiter Odyssey\". It received numerous international awards, and is visible on Van Valkenburg's YouTube channel. \n\nIn February 1970, Ames awarded a combined $380 million contract to TRW for building both of the \"Pioneer 10\" and \"11\" vehicles, bypassing the usual bidding process to save time. B. J. O'Brien and Herb Lassen led the TRW team that assembled the spacecraft. Design and construction of the spacecraft required an estimated 25 million man-hours. An engineer from TRW said \"This spacecraft is guaranteed for two years of interplanetary flight. If any component fails within that warranty period, just return the spacecraft to our shop and we will repair it free of charge.\"\n\nTo meet the schedule, the first launch would need to take place between February 29 and March 17 so that it could arrive at Jupiter in November 1974. This was later revised to an arrival date of December 1973 in order to avoid conflicts with other missions over the use of the Deep Space Network for communications, and to miss the period when Earth and Jupiter would be at opposite sides of the Sun. The encounter trajectory for \"Pioneer 10\" was selected to maximize the information returned about the radiation environment around Jupiter, even if this caused damage to some systems. It would come within about three times the radius of the planet, which was thought to be the closest it could approach and still survive the radiation. The trajectory chosen would give the spacecraft a good view of the sunlit side.\n\nThe \"Pioneer 10\" bus measured deep and with six long panels forming the hexagonal structure. The bus housed propellant to control the orientation of the probe and eight of the eleven scientific instruments. The equipment compartment lay within an aluminum honeycomb structure to provide protection from meteoroids. A layer of insulation, consisting of aluminized mylar and kapton blankets, provided passive thermal control. Heat was generated by the dissipation of 70 to 120 watts (W) from the electrical components inside the compartment. The heat range was maintained within the operating limits of the equipment by means of louvers located below the mounting platform. The spacecraft had a launch mass of about .\n\nAt launch, the spacecraft carried of liquid hydrazine monopropellant in a diameter spherical tank. Orientation of the spacecraft was maintained with six 4.5 N, hydrazine thrusters mounted in three pairs. Pair one maintained a constant spin-rate of 4.8 rpm, pair two controlled the forward thrust, and pair three controlled the attitude. The attitude pair were used in conical scanning maneuvers to track Earth in its orbit. Orientation information was also provided by a star sensor able to reference Canopus, and two Sun sensors.\n\n\"Pioneer 10\" used four SNAP-19 radioisotope thermoelectric generators (RTGs). They were positioned on two three-rod trusses, each in length and 120 degrees apart. This was expected to be a safe distance from the sensitive scientific experiments carried on board. Combined, the RTGs provided 155 W at launch, and decayed to 140 W in transit to Jupiter. The spacecraft required 100 W to power all systems. The generators were powered by the radioisotope fuel plutonium-238, which was housed in a multi-layer capsule protected by a graphite heat shield.\n\nThe pre-launch requirement for the SNAP-19 was to provide power for two years in space; this was greatly exceeded during the mission. The plutonium-238 has a half-life of 87.74 years, so that after 29 years the radiation being generated by the RTGs was at 80% of its intensity at launch. However, steady deterioration of the thermocouple junctions led to a more rapid decay in electrical power generation, and by 2001 the total power output was 65 W. As a result, later in the mission only selected instruments could be operated at any one time.\n\nThe space probe included a redundant system of transceivers, one attached to the narrow-beam, high-gain antenna, the other to an omni-antenna and medium-gain antenna. The parabolic dish for the high-gain antenna was in diameter and made from an aluminum honeycomb sandwich material. The spacecraft was spun about an axis that was parallel to the axis of this antenna so that it could remain oriented toward the Earth. Each transceiver was 8 W and transmitted data across the S-band using 2110 MHz for the uplink from Earth and 2292 MHz for the downlink to Earth with the Deep Space Network tracking the signal. Data to be transmitted was passed through a convolutional encoder so that most communication errors could be corrected by the receiving equipment on Earth. The data transmission rate at launch was 256 bit/s, with the rate degrading by about −1.27 millibit/s for each day during the mission.\n\nMuch of the computation for the mission was performed on Earth and transmitted to the spacecraft, where it was able to retain in memory up to five commands of the 222 possible entries by ground controllers. The spacecraft included two command decoders and a command distribution unit, a very limited form of processor, to direct operations on the spacecraft. This system required that mission operators prepare commands long in advance of transmitting them to the probe. A data storage unit was included to record up to 6,144 bytes of information gathered by the instruments. The digital telemetry unit was used to prepare the collected data in one of the thirteen possible formats before transmitting it back to Earth.\n\n\"Pioneer 10\" was launched on March 3, 1972 at 01:49:00 UTC (March 2 local time) by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration from Space Launch Complex 36A in Florida, aboard an Atlas-Centaur launch vehicle. The third stage consisted of a solid fuel TE364-4 developed specifically for the Pioneer missions. This stage provided about 15,000 pounds of thrust and spun up the spacecraft. The spacecraft had an initial spin rate of 30 rpm. Twenty minutes following the launch, the vehicle's three booms were extended, which slowed the rotation rate to 4.8 rpm. This rate was maintained throughout the voyage. The launch vehicle accelerated the probe for net interval of 17 minutes, reaching a velocity of 51,682 km/h (32,114 mph).\n\nAfter the high-gain antenna was contacted, several of the instruments were activated for testing while the spacecraft was moving through the Earth's radiation belts. Ninety minutes after launch, the spacecraft reached interplanetary space. \"Pioneer 10\" passed by the Moon in 11 hours and became the fastest human-made object at that time. Two days after launch, the scientific instruments were turned on, beginning with the cosmic ray telescope. After ten days, all of the instruments were active.\n\nDuring the first seven months of the journey, the spacecraft made three course corrections. The on-board instruments underwent checkouts, with the photometers examining Jupiter and the Zodiacal light, and experiment packages being used to measure cosmic rays, magnetic fields and the solar wind. The only anomaly during this interval was the failure of the Canopus sensor, which instead required the spacecraft to maintain its orientation using the two Sun sensors.\n\nWhile passing through interplanetary medium, \"Pioneer 10\" became the first mission to detect interplanetary atoms of helium. It also observed high-energy ions of aluminum and sodium in the solar wind. On July 15, 1972, \"Pioneer 10\" was the first spacecraft to enter the asteroid belt, located between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter. The project planners expected a safe passage through the belt, and the closest the trajectory would take the spacecraft to any of the known asteroids was . One of the nearest approaches was to the asteroid 307 Nike on December 2, 1972.\n\nThe on-board experiments demonstrated a deficiency of particles below a micrometer (μm) in the belt, as compared to the vicinity of the Earth. The density of dust particles between 10–100 μm did not vary significantly during the trip from the Earth to the outer edge of the belt. Only for particles with a diameter of 100 μm to 1.0 mm did the density show an increase, by a factor of three in the region of the belt. No fragments larger than a millimeter were observed in the belt, indicating these are likely rare; certainly much less common than anticipated. As the spacecraft did not collide with any particles of substantial size, it passed safely through the belt, emerging on the other side about February 15, 1973.\n\nOn November 6, 1973, the \"Pioneer 10\" spacecraft was at a distance of from Jupiter. Testing of the imaging system began, and the data was successfully received back at the Deep Space Network. A series of 16,000 commands were then uploaded to the spacecraft to control the flyby operations during the next sixty days. The orbit of the outer moon Sinope was crossed on November 8. The bow shock of Jupiter's magnetosphere was reached on November 16, as indicated by a drop in the velocity of the solar wind from to . The magnetopause was passed through a day later. The spacecraft instruments confirmed that the magnetic field of Jupiter was inverted compared to that of Earth. By the 29th, the orbits of all of the outermost moons had been passed and the spacecraft was operating flawlessly.\n\nRed and blue pictures of Jupiter were being generated by the imaging photopolarimeter as the rotation of the spacecraft carried the instrument's field of view past the planet. These red and blue colors were combined to produce a synthetic green image, allowing a three-color combination to produce the rendered image. On November 26, a total of twelve such images were received back on Earth. By December 2, the image quality exceeded the best images made from Earth. These were being displayed in real-time back on Earth, and the Pioneer program would later receive an Emmy award for this presentation to the media. The motion of the spacecraft produced geometric distortions that later had to be corrected by computer processing. During the encounter, a total of more than 500 images were transmitted.\n\nThe trajectory of the spacecraft took it along the magnetic equator of Jupiter, where the ion radiation was concentrated. Peak flux for this electron radiation is 10,000 times stronger than the maximum radiation around the Earth. Starting on December 3, the radiation around Jupiter caused false commands to be generated. Most of these were corrected by contingency commands, but an image of Io and a few close ups of Jupiter were lost. Similar false commands would be generated on the way out from the planet. Nonetheless, \"Pioneer 10\" did succeed in obtaining images of the moons Ganymede and Europa. The image of Ganymede showed low albedo features in the center and near the south pole, while the north pole appeared brighter. Europa was too far away to obtain a detailed image, although some albedo features were apparent.\n\nThe trajectory of \"Pioneer 10\" was chosen to take it behind Io, allowing the refractive effect of the moon's atmosphere on the radio transmissions to be measured. This demonstrated that the ionosphere of the moon was about above the surface on the day side, and the density ranged from 60,000 electrons per cubic centimeter on the day side, down to 9,000 on the night face. An unexpected discovery was that Io was orbiting within a cloud of hydrogen that extended for about , with a width and height of . A smaller, cloud was believed to have been detected near Europa.\n\nIt wasn't until after \"Pioneer 10\" had cleared the asteroid belt that NASA selected a trajectory towards Jupiter that offered the slingshot effect that would send the spacecraft out of the solar system. \"Pioneer 10\" was the first spacecraft to attempt such a maneuver and became a proof of concept for the missions that would follow. Such an extended mission was not originally something that was planned, but was planned for prior to launch.\n\nAt the closest approach, the velocity of the spacecraft reached 132,000 km/h, and it came within of the outer atmosphere of Jupiter. Close-up images of the Great Red Spot and the terminator were obtained. Communication with the spacecraft then ceased as it passed behind the planet. The radio occultation data allowed the temperature structure of the outer atmosphere to be measured, showing a temperature inversion between the altitudes with 10 and 100 mbar pressures. Temperatures at the 10 mbar level ranged from , while temperatures at the 100 mbar level were . The spacecraft generated an infrared map of the planet, which confirmed the idea that the planet radiated more heat than it received from the Sun.\n\nCrescent images of the planet were then returned as \"Pioneer 10\" moved away from the planet. As the spacecraft headed outward, it again passed the bow shock of Jupiter's magnetosphere. As this front is constantly shifting in space because of dynamic interaction with the solar wind, the vehicle crossed the bow shock a total of 17 times before it escaped completely.\n\n\"Pioneer 10\" crossed the orbit of Saturn in 1976 and the orbit of Uranus in 1979. On June 13, 1983, the craft crossed the orbit of Neptune, the outermost planet, and so became the first human-made object to leave the proximity of the major planets of the Solar System. The mission came to an official end on March 31, 1997, when it had reached a distance of 67 AU from the Sun, though the spacecraft was still able to transmit coherent data after this date.\n\nAfter March 31, 1997, \"Pioneer 10's\" weak signal continued to be tracked by the Deep Space Network to aid the training of flight controllers in the process of acquiring deep space radio signals. There was an Advanced Concepts study applying chaos theory to extract coherent data from the fading signal.\n\nThe last successful reception of telemetry was received from \"Pioneer 10\" on April 27, 2002; subsequent signals were barely strong enough to detect, and provided no usable data. The final, very weak signal from \"Pioneer 10\" was received on January 23, 2003 when it was 12 billion kilometers (80 AU) from Earth. Further attempts to contact the spacecraft were unsuccessful. A final attempt was made on the evening of March 4, 2006, the last time the antenna would be correctly aligned with Earth. No response was received from \"Pioneer 10\". NASA decided that the RTG units had probably fallen below the power threshold needed to operate the transmitter. Hence, no further attempts at contact were made.\n\nOn January 1, 2019, \"Pioneer 10\" is predicted to be 121.69 au from the Earth (about 11.3 billion miles); and traveling at (relative to the Sun) and traveling outward at about 2.54 au per year. \"Voyager 2\" is projected to pass \"Pioneer 10\" by April 2019. Sunlight takes 14.79 hours to reach \"Pioneer 10\". The brightness of the Sun from the spacecraft is magnitude −16.6. \"Pioneer 10\" is heading in the direction of the constellation Taurus.\n\nIf left undisturbed, \"Pioneer 10\" and its sister craft \"Pioneer 11\" will join the two Voyager spacecraft and the \"New Horizons\" spacecraft in leaving the Solar System to wander the interstellar medium. The \"Pioneer 10\" trajectory is expected to take it in the general direction of the star Aldebaran, currently located at a distance of about 68 light years. If Aldebaran had zero relative velocity, it would require more than two million years for the spacecraft to reach it.\n\nA backup unit, \"Pioneer H\", is currently on display in the \"Milestones of Flight\" gallery at the National Air and Space Museum in Washington, D.C. Many elements of the mission proved to be critical in the planning of the Voyager program.\n\nAt the behest of Carl Sagan, \"Pioneer 10\" and \"Pioneer 11\" carry a gold-anodized aluminum plaque in case either spacecraft is ever found by intelligent life-forms from another planetary system. The plaques feature the nude figures of a human male and female along with several symbols that are designed to provide information about the origin of the spacecraft. The plaque is attached to the antenna support struts to provide some shielding from interstellar dust.\n\nIn the film \"\", a Klingon ship destroys \"Pioneer 10\" as target practice.\n\nIn the internet multimedia fiction project \"17776\", a sentient \"Pioneer 10\" is one of the main characters.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2987041", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2987041", "title": "Rava (amora)", "text": "Rava (amora)\n\nAbba ben Joseph bar Ḥama (c. 280 – 352 CE), who is exclusively referred to in the Talmud by the name Rava (רבא), was a fourth-generation rabbi (\"amora\") who lived in Mahoza, a suburb of Ctesiphon, the capital of Babylonia. He is one of the most often-cited rabbis in the Talmud.\n\nHe studied at the Talmudical Academy at Pumbedita, site of modern-day Falluja, Iraq. There he, traditionally, became famous for his debates with his study-partner Abaye. The debates between Abba ben Joseph and Abaye are considered classic examples of Talmudic dialectical logic. Of their hundreds of recorded disputes, the law is decided according to the opinion of Abba ben Joseph in all but six cases. His methodology greatly influenced not only his students, but the stammaim, as well.\n\nRava married the daughter of third-generation amora Rav Hisda after she'd been widowed from Rami bar Chama. In TB Bava Batra 12b, Rav Hisda's daughter is sitting in her father's classroom, while his students, Rava and Rami bar Chama, stand before them. When Rav Hisda asks her which of the two she wants to marry, she replies \"both of them,\" and Rava adds, \"I'll be the last one\" (commentators let us know that she indeed married Rami first and Rava second). They had five sons, the eldest of whom, Joseph, died during his parents' lifetime.\n\nWhen Rabbah bar Nahmani, the head of the yeshiva of Pumbedita, retired, the position went to Abaye. At that point, Abba ben Joseph returned to Mahoza, in Babylonia, where he established a yeshiva there. After the death of Abaye, many of his students moved from Pumbedita to Mahoza, to join Abba ben Joseph's Yeshiva, which had become one of the intellectual centers of the Babylonian Jewish Community. Rava died ca 355.\n\nRava apparently had to reply to a deep-seated skepticism toward rabbinic authority and to defend the authenticity of the rabbinic oral tradition. The skepticism of Mahozan Jewry was fueled in part by the acceptance of the Manichaean polemic against Zoroastrianism and its insistence on oral transmission, and by a strong concern with the problem of theodicy, encouraged by a familiarity with Zoroastrian theology. Rava’s creativity was fueled by his cosmopolitan urban environment. For instance, he ruled that one who habitually ate certain non-kosher foods because he liked the taste was nevertheless trustworthy as a witness in cases involving civil matters. So too did he suggest that a lost object belongs to the person who discovers it even before the loser is aware of his loss, because it prevented the loser from resorting to urban courts to try to get his property back and eliminated the period of uncertainty of possession. It also led to the legal concept that 'future [psychological] abandonment [of possession] when unaware [of the loss] is [nevertheless retrospectively accounted] as abandonment'. Ultimately, Rava’s views were decisive in shaping the Bavli’s approach to the problem of theodicy, legal midrash, and conceptualization, all of which stand in stark contrast to the Yerushalmi.\"\n\n\n"}

{"id": "827312", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=827312", "title": "Shadow (Babylon 5)", "text": "Shadow (Babylon 5)\n\nThe Shadows are a fictional alien species in the science fiction television series \"Babylon 5\". Their homeworld is Z'ha'dum, although whether it is the world they originated from is uncertain, and they were the second race among the First Ones to be discovered and nurtured by Lorien, the \"First One\". In contrast to the Vorlons, whose philosophy is represented by the question \"Who are you?\", that of the Shadows is represented by the question \"What do you want?\", centering towards desire rather than identity. J. Michael Straczynski, the show's creator, once explained that he chose the name \"Shadows\" because of its meaning in Analytical psychology.\n\nA Shadow is an incorporeal being that when manifesting in a way that is visible to the viewer, appears in the form of an encounter suit resembling a spiked, violet-black exoskeleton. Their encounter suit is similar in shape to a praying mantis with an upper body, shoulder spines, a mobile head, and at least one pair of grasping forelimbs. The rear of the encounter suit is supported by multiple pairs of legs. Their legs resemble those of a spider, though each Shadow has six of them instead of eight.\n\nThe Shadows have fourteen \"eyes\" showing their true form in total divided into four groups. Two sets of three arranged slanted upward and two sets of four arranged to align perfectly under the first sets.\n\nThe spoken language of the Shadows is a rapid series of high-frequency bursts and chirps like a cricket or grasshopper. According to one of their human emissaries, the endonym of the Shadows is ten thousand letters long, and unpronounceable by many; but this may simply be a lie to avoid revealing their actual name.\n\nDetailed descriptions are rare, due to their encounter suits' ability to \"cloak\" themselves to visual wavelengths of light. They are thus rarely seen except as shadowy, mirage-like silhouettes, which can be seen by telepaths, those using visual enhancement devices, or when the entity chooses to partially or wholly reveal itself.\nOther manifestations take the form of the Shadows' three pairs of glowing orange eyes, usually as a symbolic image within a telepathic or dream vision.\n\nShadows very rarely engage in hand-to-hand combat to accomplish their goals, relying instead on invisibility, behind-the-scenes maneuvering and their technology. They are, however, vulnerable to high-powered energy weapons, as demonstrated when the two Shadow guards flanking Mr. Morden are run off by particle gun fire from Centauri guards, and likely killed in the nuclear explosion on the shadows' base island on Centauri Prime.\n\nIn the fictional \"Babylon 5\" universe, Z'ha'dum was a world extremely important to the ancient, mysterious species known as the Shadows. Although a blasted, devastated world from which the Shadows were frequently driven over the eons, they kept coming back out of respect for Lorien—the first of the First Ones—who for a long time resided on the planet.\n\nBecause of their periodic presence on Z'ha'dum, the planet is often assumed to be the Shadows' homeworld, but it is unknown whether the species actually originated there, or if its importance to them is centered strictly on Lorien. Before undergoing her fundamental genetic change to become more human, Delenn confirms with Kosh that the Shadows have returned to Z'ha'dum, implying that the species is based elsewhere when not actively preparing to launch one of their periodic wars. There appears to be more than one place of power for the Shadows and their minions. According to Markab Ambassador Fashar: \"When the darkness was defeated long ago, they scattered, hid themselves away in secret places.\"\n\nAccording to Anna Sheridan in \"Z'ha'dum\", the Shadows believed they would die if anything Vorlon touched Z'ha'dum. It is not known whether this is true, a prediction of Sheridan's actions, merely an old superstition, or a way to separate and isolate Sheridan from his transportation. Many of them did die when Sheridan arrived with a piece of Kosh and detonated a pair of nuclear warheads that he had secretly smuggled onto the White Star (partially based on Vorlon technology) in a kamikaze attack. Additionally, Lyta's telepathy, enhanced by the Vorlons (and, indeed, genetically seeded by the Vorlons in the first place) later triggered the destruction of Z'ha'dum itself. However, it is unclear if her telepathic probing of Z'ha'dum merely alarmed the remaining residents, who then set self-destruct devices and fled, or if the probing of Vorlon-enhanced telepathy somehow automatically triggered the planet's destruction.\n\nOn the TV series, the Shadows are presumed to have evolved from arthropoid creatures. Little is known about what the Shadows' evolutionary history was like.\n\nAs was stated in the Technomage Book Trilogy, the Shadows and Vorlons are both creatures of light. The Shadows prefer a more \"down to earth\" appearance, as opposed to the Vorlons who, due to generations of genetic tampering, are perceived as angels from the religious legends of races that see them.\n\nSome records indicate that the Shadows first achieved Hyperspace capability as far back as 100 mya, maybe earlier. Around this time the Shadows also became a major galactic power, exploring the universe and making contact with alien races. The first of these races was that of the being Lorien, who was the first of the First Ones.\n\nThe Shadows waged many wars with other ancient powers, including the Vorlons, Walkers and many more. The reasons for these wars are that this cycle of defeat and adaptation laid the basis for the Shadows' ideology of \"facilitated survival of the fittest,\" which they would later enforce on the younger races.\n\nMillions of years later, many younger races had begun to evolve on thousands of worlds and the First Ones realized that in order for these new sentients to succeed, the ancient races would have to move on. Thus many of the First Ones moved beyond the Galactic Rim, to explore the vast emptiness between galaxies and perhaps explore the numerous other galaxies throughout the universe. Several of the First Ones decided to stay behind and shepherd the younger races until they were fit to control their own destiny. The primary caretakers were the Vorlons and, surprisingly enough, the Shadows.\n\nAt first there was a balance between the two sides. One of the two then broke the agreement. Which is unknown. The Shadows claim the Vorlons broke the balance when they began tinkering with races on a genetic level, in an effort to make the younger races evolve more like them; which the Vorlons did, in fact, do. Though, as previously alluded to, it is not known whether this was the first act. Among these genetic dabblings, the Vorlons manipulated the younger races to see them as angelic creatures, using their telepathic abilities to shield their true form from the beings they manipulated.\n\nThe Shadows and the Vorlons began to fight among themselves, and those who tried to mediate, like the Walkers of Sigma 957, left the conflict embittered.\n\nOver the course of the centuries that passed, the wars between the Shadows and Vorlons persisted. Then at some unknown point in time they decided to have their students fight for them, in an effort to prove who was right. This led to the last Shadow War before the time in which the Babylon 5 television series was set.\n\nAround the Earth year 1260, the penultimate Shadow War raged between the Shadows and the combined forces of the Vorlons, Minbari, and various other younger races allied with the Vorlons. The primitive and agrarian Narn homeworld was occupied by the Shadows, and the planet became a Shadow staging area. The Shadows had no interest in the Narn themselves at that time.\n\nSomehow, Narn telepaths learned that they could hurt the Shadows' ships, and may have begun guerrilla operations against the Shadows. Through an unknown mechanism the Shadows slew all Narn telepaths of breeding age in order to prevent the Narn from resisting the Shadows, but the surviving telepaths, led by G'Quan, were still able to drive the Shadows from the planet.\n\nRealising the war was lost, the Shadows seeded hundreds of worlds across the galaxy with their ships so their forces couldn't be wiped out in a single attack, as even the Vorlons could never find them all. They then retreated and hid themselves away, going into a state of hibernation.\n\nIn 2259, there were increasing reports of a black, spidery ship being encountered in hyperspace, which instilled a dark fear in all who looked upon it. Meanwhile, Narn ambassador G'Kar realized that these ships were those described in the ancient writings of the Narn philosopher G'Quan, which told of a great enemy that rose to power a thousand years in the past. Known as the Shadows, they spread from their homeworld Z'ha'dum to rival the stars themselves:\n\nThe text is accompanied by pictures of the black ship, and ends on a chilling note:\n\nIn late 2260, Captain John Sheridan was invited to Z'ha'dum for a meeting with the Shadows. The Shadows badly wanted to have Sheridan on their side because if he unravelled the Army of Light, it would stay unravelled, but, as past experience had showed them, if they killed him, someone else would simply take his place.\n\nSheridan did go to Z'ha'dum but the negotiations collapsed, and he jumped into a ravine two miles deep to evade capture once his suspicion that he had been led into a trap was confirmed.\n\nBefore doing so, he remotely piloted his ship, the \"White Star\", to crash into the Shadows' capital city, which he was visiting. The \"White Star\" was carrying two nuclear bombs in its cargo bay, each with a yield of over 500 megatons. (The strongest nuclear bomb to be detonated as of 2011 was the Tsar Bomb, which had a yield of 50 megatons.)\n\nSeconds after Sheridan jumped into the abyss, the \"White Star\" crashed into the city and the nuclear weapons it contained detonated. Both the \"White Star\" and the city were destroyed. The crater left from the blast was the size of a large Earth country and was clearly visible from space.\n\nThe explosion on Z'ha'dum destroyed the Shadows' biggest city, throwing them into chaos and forcing them to regroup. They then went to seek outside help, and enlisted the Centauri to shelter a fleet of their ships on Centauri Prime.\n\nAt the Battle of Coriana 6, the second Shadow War ended, when the very races they and the Vorlons shepherded, led by John Sheridan of Earth and Delenn of Minbari confronted both belligerents and announced that they would no longer be pawns of their philosophical struggle. When the grand coalition against them started sacrificing themselves against the Shadows' attempts to kill their leaders, they finally conceded that their conflict was now at an end. With that concession, the Shadows and the Vorlons passed beyond the Galactic Rim, accompanied by Lorien. Nonetheless, their servants, the Drakh, and a few others stayed behind, and retained the advanced technology and aggressive philosophy of the Shadows.\n\nSheridan, along with Alfred Bester and Lyta Alexander, went back to Z'ha'dum in early 2261 in search of some of this technology. This triggered a self-destruct security feature that caused the entire planet to explode, leaving nothing behind — except for what the Drakh and other allies of the Shadows took with them in their quick exit from the exploding planet.\n\nThe Drakh aren't the only race who worked for the Shadows, but neither the surgeons and pilot in \"Ship of Tears\" nor the creature in \"The Long Dark\" were seen to be helping with the evacuation, though of course it has been speculated that the Drakh might have been the only Shadow servants to have been living on Z'ha'dum at that time.\n\nWith the destruction of Z'ha'dum, those beings that had faithfully served the Shadows down through the centuries found themselves homeless. Now these thralls sought to become masters of chaos themselves. Thus, the legacy of the Shadows lived on.\n\n\nShadow vessels are notable for their spires and dark coloration. The main-line warships resemble enormous tailless whip scorpions; these can spew forth clouds of small fighter craft. Less commonly seen are reconnaissance/fleet-support ships the size of the White Star with all spires curled to face forward. When human allies incorporated these spires into their own capital ships, they became able to lock weapons onto Minbari vessels, suggesting the spires serve as sensors. Fighters spit balls of energy for weaponry, while larger vessels employ cutting beams. Every Shadow capital ship has a sentient being enslaved as its central processing unit (CPU). This gives it incredible control and maneuverability, but leaves the ship vulnerable to paralysis from telepathic attack, which the Shadows attempt to counter by installing telepaths into their ships' cores. Unlike conventional ships, Shadow vessels do not form \"Jump Points\" to enter Hyperspace, although they have missiles that can fatally disrupt other ships' portals. Instead they slide or phase into Hyperspace.\n\nThe Shadow Death Cloud is their version of a Planet Killer. Instead of being a ship per se, it is seen as a massive black cloud in space. The \"cloud\" is actually countless nanites that surround a massive interconnected lattice-work. These lattices contain the command & control functions, weapons, etc., of the Death Cloud, as well as missile launchers. When the Death Cloud attacks a planet, the missiles fire at the planet, then burrow down below the surface, causing significant tectonic upheaval upon detonation on the order of tens of thousands of megatons apiece, resulting in the death of all life on the planet. The nanites then descend on the planet, consuming all the resources necessary for maintaining, repairing, and recharging the Death Cloud's resources, rendering the surface of the planet little more than an inert, sterile husk. The nanites also have the effect of absorbing all efforts to scan inside the cloud, akin to a form of stealth technology, and also cooling down the local area of space to nearly absolute zero. Any technology caught inside begins shutting down due to the extreme cold.\n\nAgents of Gaming RPG books make mention that the Shadows a long time ago actually piloted their own craft but gave up the practice perhaps due to their limited numbers. Instead they used members of the younger races as cannon fodder, and made it possible for their warships to be bred more quickly.\n\nThe Shadows developed many other weapons of war, including deadly bioengineered viruses and an artificial intelligence pod capable of operating a vessel in lieu of a normal crew. These weapons were scavenged by the Drakh following the Shadows' departure from the galaxy. It is unknown what other horrors the Shadows may have left behind. The Shadows may also have created a special type of jumpgate called a Null field, which appears as a black hole and establishes an instantaneous connection between two points. They were also the creators of a bio-plague that used nanites to wipe out entire species.\n\nThe Shadows may also be the originator of technology that gives the Technomages their powers (making them cyborgs). It seems likely that the Technomages were developed to serve as some of the Shadows' many soldiers of darkness, against telepaths in the Vorlon army of light, but the Technomages learned of this and rebelled, though attempts were made on many occasions to draw them back into the ranks of the Shadows.\n\n"}

Most of her development as a literary figure was carried out by other Mythos authors, including August Derleth, Robert Bloch, and Ramsey Campbell.\n\nAugust Derleth classified Shub-Niggurath as a Great Old One, but the \"Call of Cthulhu\" role-playing game classifies her as an Outer God. The \"CthulhuTech\" role-playing game, in turn, returns to Derleth's classification of Shub-Niggurath as a Great Old One.\n\nShub-Niggurath's appearances in Lovecraft's main body of fiction do not provide much detail about his conception of the entity. Her first mention under Lovecraft's byline was in \"The Dunwich Horror\" (1928), where a quote from the \"Necronomicon\" discussing the Old Ones breaks into an exclamation of \"Iä! Shub-Niggurath!\" The story provides no further information about this peculiar expression.\n\nThe next Lovecraft story to mention Shub-Niggurath is scarcely more informative. In \"The Whisperer in Darkness\" (1930), a recording of a ceremony involving human and nonhuman worshipers includes the following exchange:\n\nSimilarly unexplained exclamations occur in \"The Dreams in the Witch House\" (1932) and \"The Thing on the Doorstep\" (1933).\n\nLovecraft only provided specific information about Shub-Niggurath in his \"revision tales\", stories published under the names of clients for whom he ghost-wrote. As Price points out, \"For these clients he constructed a parallel myth-cycle to his own, a separate group of Great Old Ones\", including Yig, Ghatanothoa, Rhan-Tegoth, \"the evil twins Nug and Yeb\"—and Shub-Niggurath.\n\nWhile some of these revision stories just repeat the familiar exclamations, others provide new elements of lore. In \"The Last Test\" (1927), the first mention of Shub-Niggurath seems to connect her to Nug and Yeb: \"I talked in Yemen with an old man who had come back from the Crimson Desert—he had seen Irem, the City of Pillars, and had worshipped at the underground shrines of Nug and Yeb—Iä! Shub-Niggurath!\"\n\nThe revision story \"The Mound\", which describes the discovery of an underground realm called K'n-yan by a Spanish conquistador, reports that a temple of Tsathoggua there \"had been turned into a shrine of Shub-Niggurath, the All-Mother and wife of the Not-to-Be-Named-One. This deity was a kind of sophisticated Astarte, and her worship struck the pious Catholic as supremely obnoxious.\"\n\nThe reference to \"Astarte\", the consort of Baal in Semitic mythology, ties Shub-Niggurath to the related fertility goddess Cybele, the Magna Mater mentioned in Lovecraft's \"The Rats in the Walls\", and implies that the \"great mother worshipped by the hereditary cult of Exham Priory\" in that story \"had to be none other than Shub-Niggurath\".\n\nThe Not-to-Be-Named-One, not being named, is difficult to identify; a similar phrase, translated into Latin as the Magnum Innominandum, appears in a list in \"The Whisperer in Darkness\" and was included in a scrap of incantation that Lovecraft wrote for Robert Bloch's \"The Shambler from the Stars\". August Derleth identifies this mysterious entity with Hastur (though Hastur appears in the same \"Whisperer in Darkness\" list with the Magnum Innominandum), while Robert M. Price equates him with Yog-Sothoth—though he also suggests that Shub-Niggurath's mate is implicitly the snake god Yig.\n\nFinally, in \"Out of the Aeons\", a revision tale set in part on the lost continent of Mu, Lovecraft describes the character T'yog as the \"High Priest of Shub-Niggurath and guardian of the copper temple of the Goat with a Thousand Young\". In the story, T'yog surprisingly maintains that \"the gods friendly to man could be arrayed against the hostile gods, and ... that Shub-Niggurath, Nug, and Yeb, as well as Yig the Serpent-god, were ready to take sides with man\" against the more malevolent Ghatanothoa. Shub-Niggurath is called \"the Mother Goddess\", and reference is made to \"her sons\", presumably Nug and Yeb.\n\nOther evidence of Lovecraft's conception of Shub-Niggurath can be found in his letters. For example, in a letter to Willis Conover, Lovecraft described her as an \"evil cloud-like entity\". \"Yog-Sothoth's wife is the hellish cloud-like entity Shub-Niggurath, in whose honor nameless cults hold the rite of the Goat with a Thousand Young. By her he has two monstrous offspring—the evil twins Nug and Yeb. He has also begotten hellish hybrids upon the females of various organic species throughout the universes of space-time.\"\n\nAlthough Shub-Niggurath is often associated with the epithet \"The Black Goat of the Woods with a Thousand Young\", it is possible that this Black Goat is a separate entity. Rodolfo Ferraresi, in his essay \"The Question of Shub-Niggurath\", says that Lovecraft himself separated the two in his writings, such as in \"Out of the Aeons\" (1935) in which a distinction is made between Shub-Niggurath and the Black Goat—the goat is the figurehead through which Shub-Niggurath is worshipped. In apparent contrast to Shub-Niggurath, the Black Goat is sometimes depicted as a male, most notably in the rite performed in \"The Whisperer in Darkness\" (1931) in which the Black Goat is called the \"Lord of the Woods\". However, Lovecraft clearly associates Shub-Niggurath with The Black Goat of the Woods with a Thousand Young in two of his stories—\"The Dreams in the Witch House\" and \"The Thing on the Doorstep\".\n\nThe Black Goat may be the personification of Pan, since Lovecraft was influenced by Arthur Machen's \"The Great God Pan\" (1890), a story that inspired Lovecraft's \"The Dunwich Horror\" (1929). In this incarnation, the Black Goat may represent Satan in the form of the satyr, a half-man, half-goat. In folklore, the satyr symbolized a man with excessive sexual appetites. The Black Goat may otherwise be a male, earthly form of Shub-Niggurath—an incarnation she assumes to copulate with her worshipers.\n\nRobert M. Price points to a passage from \"Idle Days on the Yann\", by Lord Dunsany, one of Lovecraft's favorite writers, as the source for the name Shub-Niggurath:\n\nNotes Price: \"The name already carried a whiff of sulfur: Sheol was the name for the Netherworld mentioned in the Bible and the Gilgamesh Epic.\"\n\nAs for Shub-Niggurath's association with the symbol of the goat, Price writes,\n\nIn Ramsey Campbell's story \"The Moon Lens\", the English town of Goatswood is inhabited by once-human worshippers of Shub-Niggurath. When the deity deems a worshiper to be most worthy, a special ceremony is held in which the \"Black Goat of the Woods\" swallows the initiate, and then regurgitates the cultist as a transformed satyr-like being. A changed worshiper is also endowed with immortal life.\n\nIn the short story \"Crouch End\", a woman loses her husband to, and then is chased by minions of \"the Goat with a Thousand Young\" and then by the Goat itself. In the novel \"Revival\" a maddening entity known as \"Great Mother\" is introduced and shares many similarities with Shub-Niggurath, though the latter is never mentioned.\n\nIn his \"Edge Chronicles\" novel \"The Curse of the Gloamglozer,\" one of the antagonists, the Rogue Glister, is obviously modelled after Shub-Niggurath, with long, stretching tentacles and its main body being a pulsating mass of muscle just like the Black Goat.\n\n\"The Scarifyers: The Devil of Denge Marsh\", by Paul Morris, is a light-hearted radio play (on CD as a Cosmic Hobo publication, 2007) in The Scarifyers series whose heroes (played by Nicholas Courtney and Terry Molloy) are engaged in foiling the return of this watery timeless horror and thwarting the intentions of its mysterious (and sometimes bizarre) human acolytes.\n\nGary Myers's story, \"What Rough Beast\", casts Shub-Niggurath as the mother of all the gods, and her children as the chapters of her ongoing revelation.\n\nIn \"Turn Coat\", the eleventh book in \"The Dresden Files\" by Jim Butcher, the narrator mentions that there are in his universe \"terrors that the Black-Goat-with-a-Thousand-Young wouldn't dare use for its kids' bedtime stories\".\n\nIn \"The Outlaw Gods\", a novella from \"The Mensch With No Name\", second book in the \"Merkabah Rider\" weird western series, Shub-Niggurath dwells beneath the ruins of Red House, a K'n-yan citadel in the mountains of Arizona, surrounded by dark trees which tear apart trespassers.\n\nThe Dark Young or Thousand Young appear in the short film \"Black Goat\" by writer/director Joseph Nanni. The Dark Young first appear as root/tentacles assessing their prey. Later in the film a young trapper surrounds one of the Young with fire only to find himself surrounded when the creature calls its siblings.\n\nHowever, the concept of the Dark Young was first introduced by game designer Sandy Petersen for the \"Call of Cthulhu\" role-playing game.\n\nShub-Niggurath (under the variant \"Shub-Niggarauth\") is mentioned in the Joe Hill graphic novel series \"Locke & Key\". Another dimension is barred from our own by a black door in a deep cave, and any who step through become possessed by a \"Child of Leng\" (implying that this other world behind the Black Door is, indeed, Lovecraft's Leng) - writhing creatures made of dark liquid-like material and golden eyes. In \"Clockworks\", volume five of the series, three possessed characters (two humans and a goat) all exclaim \"Iä! Iä Shub-Niggarauth!\", implying that the Children of Leng are either the creature's \"Thousand Young\" or the creature itself. It is noteworthy to mention that the series itself is set on the fictional island of Lovecraft, Massachusetts.\n\nIn his book \"A Big Boy Did It and Ran Away\", Brookmyre includes various first-person shooter references (as the plot involves an ex-videogame-salesman fighting terrorists single-handed). Among these references, the terrorists' financier is named Shaloub \"Shub\" N'gurath, a reference to Shub-Niggurath as it appears as a boss in the first-person shooter \"Quake\".\n\nIn \"The Furies From Borås\" Anders Fager includes references to Shub-Niggurath. The \"Young of the Goat\" is a cult of teenage girls. They lure teenage boys into the woods and sacrifice them to a monstrous messenger. The story has given rise to the \"Borås Black Goats\", a fictional sports club from the Furies' home town.\n\nShub-Niggurath is the primary antagonist in the 2013 novelette \"Equoid\" by Charles Stross.\n\nShub-Nillurath, or the \"Black God of the Forest with a thousand Young\", features in the \"Long War\" series of fantasy novels.\n\nShub-Niggurath is mentioned in \"Professor Gargoyle: Tales from Lovecraft Middle School #1\".\n\nShub-Niggurath, calling herself \"The Black Goat of the Woods with a Thousand Young\", is one of the main protagonists of the slice-of-life manga .\n\nEpisode 12 of , the 3rd season of the popular Japanese anime series Overlord, gives a nod to the Cthulhu mythos, portraying the anti-hero and principal lead character of the series, Ains Ooal Gown, using \"super-tier\" magic to summon half a dozen of Shub-Niggurath's 1,000 young in order to destroy an army of 240,000 men.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "22185822", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=22185822", "title": "United States v. Enmons", "text": "United States v. Enmons\n\nUnited States v. Enmons, , was a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court held that the federal Anti-Racketeering Act of 1934, known as the Hobbs Act, does not cover union violence in furtherance of the union's objectives.\n\nThe case involved a labor strike in which members of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW) fired rifles at three utility company transformers, drained the oil from another, and blew up a company substation. The labor union in question was seeking a higher-pay contract and other benefits from their employer, the Gulf States Utilities Company which is now part of Entergy. The federal government tried the defendants under the Hobbs Act. \n\nThe Court ruled that \"The Hobbs Act, which makes it a federal crime to obstruct interstate commerce by robbery or extortion, does not reach the use of violence (which is readily punishable under state law) to achieve legitimate union objectives, such as higher wages in return for genuine services that the employer seeks.\"\n\nThe indictment against the alleged conspirators charged them with being in violation of the Hobbs Act, which states that anyone attempting to affect or obstruct commerce through violence or the threat of violence against any person or property \"\"shall be fined not more than $10,000 or imprisoned not more than twenty years, or both\".\" The indictment argued that the union members obstructed commerce with their actions against the Utilities Company, and attempted to \"obtain the property of [their employer] in the form of wages and other things of value\" by using the wrongful use of force and the fear of economic loss.\n\nThe court acknowledged that using threats and force to obtain property is wrongful. However, the court reasoned that it is considered \"wrongful\" only when the perpetrator has no \"legitimate claim\" to it. Since federal law empowers unions with the right to strike, the use of violence to secure higher pay and benefits was not extortion. The case was dismissed. Such violent acts can, however, be punishable under normal state or federal laws. \n\nIn understanding Enmons, it is important to keep in mind that what the Hobbs Act outlaws is extortion, not just any bad act. Federal law, in particular the National Labor Relations Act, says that collective bargaining and strikes in support of collective bargaining goals are legal and protected. Therefore, since collective bargaining has a purpose that is not extortion, one of the key elements of a Hobbs Act violation is not met.\n\nWhile labor unions as a whole are exempt from prosecution, individual members can still be held accountable and prosecuted according to local laws. However, evidence suggests that this rarely is the case. According to a 1998 policy analysis by the Cato Institute,The result has been an epidemic of union-related violence. The National Institute for Labor Relations Research (NILRR) has recorded 8,799 incidents of violence from news reports since [the Enmons ruling]. Those reports show only 258 convictions, suggesting a conviction rate of less than 3 percent. Moreover, local law enforcement authorities often get many more reports of strike violence than journalists can possibly cover.\n\nSome critics argue that the Enmons decision has been a major factor in increasing corruption among union and government officials alike. Economist and former professor Morgan Reynolds wrote:\nIt is difficult to tell racketeer-controlled unions from other unions, because both types depend on violence and the threat of violence…The plain truth is that our labor laws have arranged incentives so that honest, noncoercive union officials find it difficult to survive in competition with the muscleman types.\n\nHowever, others argue the FUVA has greatly exaggerated the existence of union violence. In a law review article, Julius G. Getman and F. Ray Marshall, The Continuing Assault on the Right to Strike, 79 Tex. L. Rev. 703, 712-13 (2001), law professor Julius Getman and former Secretary of Labor Ray Marshall, analyzed the evidence of union violence.\nThe claim that strike violence is \"escalating\" has no empirical basis. Even the study conducted by the National Institute for Labor Relations Research - cited regularly as authority for this proposition by FUVA's proponents - draws no such conclusion. And the study itself is a scholarly monstrosity that seeks to study union violence by compiling media reports, mainly newspaper articles concerning strike violence. The Institute admits that it did not actually investigate any of the incidents reported and does not know if the reports are accurate. It concludes: \"Because it relies on news accounts the Institute cannot guarantee the accuracy of the file itself.\" In fact, articles about employer-instigated violence are included in the study's effort to determine union violence. n59 It seems obvious that the methodology employed confuses those strikes most written about with those most violent. Further, the Institute includes incidents of \"psychological violence; i.e., intimidation, coercion and verbal threats\" - terms which it does not bother to define. It seems clear, however, that this definition would include nonviolent civil disobedience of the type used by the civil rights movement and increasingly by the labor movement. But whatever the definition, it is almost certain that strike-related violence has decreased since the Enmons decision because the number of strikes has declined significantly.\n\nSince 1973, a number of bills have been proposed to overturn US v. Enmons. The Freedom from Union Violence Act (FUVA) was first introduced as H.R. 1796 on June 8, 1995, and has been reintroduced in every Congress since. None of these bills have made it out of committee.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "6811513", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6811513", "title": "Vasa praevia", "text": "Vasa praevia\n\nVasa praevia, also spelled vasa previa, is a condition in which fetal blood vessels cross or run near the internal opening of the uterus. These vessels are at risk of rupture when the supporting membranes rupture, as they are unsupported by the umbilical cord or placental tissue.\nRisk factors include in vitro fertilization.\nVasa praevia occurs in about 0.6 per 1000 pregnancies. The term \"vasa previa\" is derived from the Latin; \"vasa\" means vessels and \"previa\" comes from \"pre\" meaning \"before\" and \"via\" meaning \"way\". In other words, vessels lie before the fetus in the birth canal and in the way.\nVasa previa is present when unprotected fetal vessels traverse the fetal membranes over the internal cervical os. These vessels may be from either a velamentous insertion of the umbilical cord or may be joining an accessory (succenturiate) placental lobe to the main disk of the placenta. If these fetal vessels rupture the bleeding is from the fetoplacental circulation, and fetal exsanguination will rapidly occur, leading to fetal death. It is thought that vasa previa arises from an early placenta previa. As the pregnancy progresses, the placenta tissue surrounding the vessels over the cervix undergoes atrophy, and the placenta grows preferentially toward the upper portion of the uterus. This leaves unprotected vessels running over the cervix and in the lower uterine segment. This has been demonstrated using serial ultrasound. Oyelese et al. found that 2/3 of patient with vasa previa at delivery had a low-lying placenta or placenta previa that resolved prior to the time of delivery. \nThere are three types of vasa previa. Types 1 and 2 were described by Catanzarite et al. In Type 1, there is a velamentous insertion with vessels running over the cervix. In Type 2, unprotected vessels run between lobes of a bilobed or succenturiate lobed placenta. In Type 3, a portion of the placenta overlying the cervix undergoes atrophy. In this type, there is a normal placental cord insertion and the placenta has only one lobe. However, vessels at a margin of the placenta are exposed.\n\nVasa previa is seen more commonly with velamentous insertion of the umbilical cord, accessory placental lobes (succenturiate or bilobate placenta), multiple gestation, IVF pregnancy. In IVF pregnancies incidences as high as one in 300 have been reported. The reasons for this association are not clear, but disturbed orientation of the blastocyst at implantation, vanishing embryos and the increased frequency of placental morphological variations in in vitro fertilisation pregnancies have all been postulated.\n\n\nIt is recommended that women with vasa previa should deliver through elective cesarean prior to rupture of the membranes. Given the timing of membrane rupture is difficult to predict, elective cesarean delivery at 35–36 weeks is recommended. This gestational age gives a reasonable balance between the risk of death and that of prematurity. Several authorities have recommended hospital admission about 32 weeks. This is to give the patient proximity to the operating room for emergency delivery should the membranes rupture. Because these patients are at risk for preterm delivery, it is recommended that steroids should be given to promote fetal lung maturation. When bleeding occurs, the patient goes into labor, or if the membranes rupture, immediate treatment with an emergency caesarean delivery is usually indicated.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2011930", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2011930", "title": "Virtual crime", "text": "Virtual crime\n\nVirtual crime or in-game crime refers to a virtual criminal act that takes place in a massively multiplayer online game (MMOG), usually an MMORPG. The huge time and effort invested into such games can lead online \"crime\" to spill over into real world crime, and even blur the distinctions between the two. Some countries have introduced special police investigation units to cover such \"virtual crimes\". South Korea is one such country and looked into 22,000 cases in the first six months of 2003.\n\nSeveral interpretations of the term \"virtual crime\" exist. Some legal scholars opt for a definition based on a report written by freelance journalist Julian Dibbell on what was the first prominent case, \"a rape in cyberspace.\" One such scholar defined virtual crime as needing to have all the qualities of a real crime, and so was not a new subset of crime at all. Conversely, it has also been said that the connection between virtual crimes and real crimes are \"tenuous at best: It is the link between a brutal rape and a fictional story of a brutal rape. Surely the difference is more striking than any similarity.\" It is difficult to prove that there are real-life implications of virtual crime, so it is not widely accepted as prosecutable.\n\nTo rectify this, the modern interpretation of the term \"virtual\" must be amended such that it carries the traditional implication; \"that is such in essence or effect, though not recognised as such in name or according to strict definition.\" In this sense, it \"would include those crimes that somehow evoke and approach the effect and essence of real crime, but are not considered crimes.\"\n\nOver time, players build their characters and collect in-game items. Some such items may have been obtained through months of gameplay, involving various tasks and a substantial level of effort. According to standard conceptions of economic value, the goods and services of virtual economies do have a demonstrable value. Since players of these games are willing to substitute real economic resources of time and money (monthly fees) in exchange for these resources, by definition they have demonstrated utility to the user. \n\nStemming from their value in the virtual economy, these items, and the characters themselves, have gained monetary value in the real world. eBay, along with specialist trading sites, have allowed players to sell their wares. This has attracted fraudulent sales as well as theft. Many game developers, such as Blizzard Entertainment (responsible for \"World of Warcraft\") oppose and even prohibit the practice. Some argue that to allow in-game items to have monetary values makes these games, essentially, gambling venues.\n\nIn the online world of Brittania, the currency of one Annum equates to about $3.4 US. If someone were to steal another player's virtual currency, they could convert it to US dollars via PayPal. This stems controversy over whether or not this should be dealt with like real crime, as there are real-life implications.\n\nIn most games, players do not own, materially or intellectually, any part of the game world, and merely pay to use it. Because this \"virtual property\" is actually owned by the game developer, a developer who opposed real commerce of in-game currencies would have the right to destroy virtual goods as soon as they were listed on eBay or otherwise offered for real trade.\n\nIn South Korea, where the number of computer game players is massive, some have reported the emergence of gangs and mafia, where powerful players steal and demand that beginners give them virtual money for their \"protection\". \n\nIn China, Qiu Chengwei was sentenced to life in prison after stabbing and killing fellow \"The Legend of Mir 3\" gamer Zhu Caoyuan. In the game Qiu had lent Zhu a powerful sword (a \"dragon sabre\"), which Zhu then went on to sell on eBay for 7,200 Yuan (about £473 or US$870). With no Chinese laws covering the online dispute, there was nothing the police could do.\n\nIn the game \"The Sims Online\" a 17-year-old boy going by the in-game name \"Evangeline\", was discovered to have built a cyber-brothel, where customers would pay sim-money for minutes of cybersex. This led to the cancellation of his accounts but no legal action, mainly because he was above the age of consent.\n\nThe term \"virtual mugging\" was coined when some players of \"Lineage II\" used bots to defeat other player's characters and take their items. In Japan, the Kagawa prefectural police arrested a Chinese foreign exchange student on 16 August 2005 following the reports of virtual mugging and the online sale of the stolen items.\n\nThe virtual economies of many MMOs and the exchange of virtual items and currency for real money has triggered the birth of the game sweatshop, in which workers in the developing world, typically China (although there has been reports of this type of activity in Eastern European countries), earn real-world wages for long days spent monotonously performing in-game tasks. Most instances typically involve farming of resources or currency, which has given rise to the epithet \"Chinese Adena Farmer\", because of its first reported widespread use in \"Lineage II\". More egregious cases involve using exploits such as in duping money or items, such as a large-scale incident in \"Star Wars Galaxies\". Both practices can place great stress on the creators' artificial economy, requiring robust design, and often repeated updates, to preserve reasonable work/reward ratios and game balance. There have also been reports of collusion (or vertical integration, depending on the source) among farmers and online currency exchanges. In 2002, a company called Blacksnow Interactive, a game currency exchange, admitted to using workers in a \"virtual sweatshop\" in Tijuana, Mexico to farm money and items from \"Ultima Online\" and \"Dark Age of Camelot\". When Mythic Entertainment cracked down on the practice, Blacksnow attempted to sue the game company.\n\nIt was reported on 14 November 2007 that a Dutch teenager had been arrested for allegedly stealing virtual furniture from \"rooms\" in 3D social-networking website Habbo Hotel. The teenagers involved were accused of creating fake Habbo websites in order to lure users into entering their account details, which would then be used to steal virtual furniture bought with real money totalling €4000.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "20134604", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20134604", "title": "Whale meat", "text": "Whale meat\n\nWhale meat, broadly speaking, may include all cetaceans (whales, dolphins, porpoises) and all parts of the animal: muscle (meat), organs (offal), and fat (blubber). There is relatively little demand for it, compared to farmed livestock, and commercial whaling, which has faced opposition for decades, continues today in very few countries (mainly Iceland, Japan, Norway), although whale meat used to be eaten across Western Europe and colonial America. However, wherever dolphin drive hunting and aboriginal whaling exist, marine mammals are eaten locally as part of the subsistence economy: in the Faroe Islands; in the circumpolar Arctic (the Inuit in Canada and Greenland, related peoples in Alaska, the Chukchi people of Siberia); other indigenous peoples of the United States (including the Makah people of the Pacific Northwest); in St. Vincent and the Grenadines (mainly on the island of Bequia); in a couple of villages in Indonesia; in certain South Pacific islands.\n\nLike horse meat, for some cultures whale meat is taboo, or a food of last resort, e.g. in times of war, whereas in others it is a delicacy and a culinary centrepiece. Indigenous groups contend that whale meat represents their cultural survival. Its consumption has been denounced by detractors on wildlife conservation, toxicity, and animal rights grounds. Whale meat can be prepared in various ways, including salt-curing, which means that consumption is not necessarily restricted to coastal communities.\n\nWhales were hunted in European waters throughout the Middle Ages for their meat and oil. Under Catholicism, aquatic creatures were generally considered \"fish\"; therefore whale was deemed suitable for eating during Lent and other \"lean periods\". An alternative explanation is that the Church considered \"hot meat\" to raise the libido, making it unfit for holy days. Parts submerged in water, such as whale or beaver tails, were considered \"cold meat.\"\n\nEating whale meat did not end with the Middle Ages in Europe, but rather, whale stock in nearby oceans collapsed due to overexploitation, especially the right whales around the Bay of Biscay. Thus European whalers (the Basques, especially, were known for their expertise) had to seek out the New World to catch whales. The Dutch (Flemish) were also active in the whaling commerce during the Middle Ages, and a number of records regarding the trafficking of whalemeat and taxation on it occur from historical Flanders (extending to cities like Arras or Calais in the \"département\" of Pas de Calais).\n\nFrench surgeon Ambroise Paré (died 1590) wrote that \"the flesh has no value, but the tongue is soft and delicious and therefore salted; likewise, the blubber, which is distributed across many provinces, and eaten with peas during Lent\". This blubber, known as \"craspois\" or \"lard de carême\" was food for the poorer strata on the continent. The whaling industry in North America may have supplied rendered fat, partly for consumption in Europe.\n\nIn early America, whalemen may have eaten blubber after rendering, which they termed \"cracklings\" or \"fritters\", said to be crunchy like toast; these were certainly reused as fuel chips to boil down the fat. Colonial America also more commonly consumed the meat and other portions of the \"blackfish\" (or pilot whale). However, by the beginning of large-scale commercial whaling, whale meat was not consumed by the general American public, as it was not seen as fit for consumption by so-called civilized peoples.\n\nMinke whale is one of the most common species still hunted in substantial numbers. Baleen whales other than the minke are endangered, though they are taken in numbers by indigenous peoples who traditionally hunt them, and more lately, the whaling nations have resumed hunting larger baleen whales openly.\n\nIn 1998-1999, Harvard researchers published their DNA identifications of samples of whalemeat they obtained in the Japanese market, and found that mingled among the presumably legal (i.e. minke whale meat) was a sizeable proportion of dolphin and porpoise meats, and instances of endangered species such as fin whale and humpback whale. (Blue whale DNA was also detected in the study, but researchers have attributed those findings to crossbreeding with fin whales, and that view has since been strengthened.)\n\nIn recent years Japan has resumed taking North Pacific fin whale and sei whales in their research whaling. The fin whales are highly desired because they yield arguably the best quality of tail meat (\"onomi\"). Japanese research vessels refer to the harvested whale meat as incidental byproducts which have resulted from study.\n\nIn Japan, the research whale meat was sold at officially published prices, but since 2011 an auction bid system has been adopted and actual realized prices have not been posted.\n\nThe channels through which premium cuts such as fin whale tail meat are sold remain opaque. A report by one of the Greenpeace Japan activists who intercepted whale meat package deliveries got no further than the sentiment by one restaurateur that it would take Nagatachō (i.e. high government) connections to get it.\n\nIn places such as Norway, Iceland, and Alaska, whale meat may be served without seasoning. However, it can also be cured or marinated, or made into jerky.\n\nIn Norway, whale meat was a cheap and common food until the 80s. It could be used in many ways but was often cooked in a pot with lid in a little water so that broth was created and then served with potatoes and vegetables, often with flatbrød at the side.\n\nThe consumption of whale meat by the Inuit people in Greenland is part of their culture. However, in 2010, tourists also have begun to consume the meat. A Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society (WDCS) investigation has documented the practice of commercial wholesalers commissioning subsistence whalers to supply the demand by supermarkets. Whale products in Greenland are sold in 4-star hotels.\n\nWhales have been hunted for meat in Japan since before 800 AD. After World War II, due to damage to Japan's infrastructure, whale meat became an important source of proteins.\n\nIn modern-day Japan, two cuts of whale meat are usually created: the belly meat and the tail meat. In the early 19th century, 70 different cuts were known. People still call the belly and tail cuts by their special whalemeat names, and also, different parts of the body such as the tongue retain their jargon names (see below). The tail meat is not the same as the fluke (tail flipper), and they go by different names.\n\nAs previously mentioned, different cuts of whale meat have specialised names. The belly meat, in the striped bellows-like underbelly of baleen whales \"from the lower jaw to the navel\", is called and is known for being made into whale bacon.\n\nThe prized tail meat, called or are two strips of muscle that run from the dorsal to the base of the fluke. The tail meat is regarded as marbled, and is eaten as sashimi or tataki. Even Masanori Hata (aka Mutsugorō) a zoologist author and animal shelter operator has extolled the delicacy of the tail meat. It can only be derived from larger baleen whales, and the fin whale's meat has been considered superior. When the ban on this species was in place and Japan ostensibly complied, what was claimed to be genuine fin whale was still available, and legitimized as \"grandfathered\" goods, i.e., frozen stock from animals caught when still legal. In the past when blue whale hunting was still conducted by all nations, its tail fin was served in Japan.\n\nThe other portions are labelled lean, or and command much lower prices than the tail.\n\nThe fluke or tail flipper is referred to as either or . After being cured in salt it is thinly sliced, scalded with hot water and rinsed, and served as \"sarashi kujira \"(pictured).\n\nThe tongue, called is often processed and used in high-end oden. The fried skin after the blubber is called \"koro\", and analogous to \"fritter/crackling\".\n\nThe Japanese article under provides a more extensive list, which includes the intestines, sex organs, and other offal.\n\n\nSome other dishes are: cubed and grilled blubber, cartilage salads, and whale skin stew.\n\nAs of 2006, in Japan, 5,560 tons of whale meat worth ¥5.5 billion is sold in every year. The Japanese market has declined in recent years, with prices falling to $26 per kilogram in 2004, down $6 per kilogram from 1999. Fluke meat can sell for over $200 per kilogram, over three times the price of belly meat.\n\nGreenpeace has alleged that some of the meat on sale is illegally sourced. They have claimed that it has been illegally smuggled from crew members of research ships and that more meat is caught than can be consumed by humans, with up to 20% of 2004's catch going unsold.\n\nFor thousands of years, Native Alaskans of the Arctic have depended on whale meat. The meat is harvested from legal, non-commercial hunts that occur twice a year in the spring and autumn. The meat is stored and eaten throughout the winter.\n\nTikiġaġmiut, Iñupiat living on the coast of Alaska, divided their catch into 10 sections. The fatty tail, considered to be the best part, went to the captain of the conquering vessel, while the less-desired sections were given to his crew and others that assisted with the kill.\n\nThe skin and blubber, known as muktuk, taken from the bowhead, beluga, or narwhal is also valued, and is eaten raw or cooked. \"Mikigaq\" is the fermented whale meat.\n\nWhaling in the Faroe Islands in the North Atlantic has been practiced since about the time of the first Norse settlements on the islands. Around 1000 Long-finned Pilot Whales (\"Globicephala melaena\") are killed annually, mainly during the summer. The hunts, called \"grindadráp\" in Faroese, are organized on a community level.\n\nBoth the meat and blubber are stored and prepared in various ways, including Tvøst og spik. When fresh, the meat is often boiled. It can also be served as steak (grindabúffur). This dish comprises meat and blubber, which is salted and then boiled for an hour, served with potatoes. The meat can also be hung out to dry and then served in thin slivers. At parties some choose to serve \"kalt borð\" (cold table), which means a variety of cold food, which can include dried whale meat, dried blubber or blubber which is preserved in water with much salt in it, dried fish, dried sheep meat, etc. Traditionally, whale meat was preserved by hanging salted pieces (called \"likkjur\") outdoors under a roof to be dried in the wind. This method is still used today, particularly in villages. Today, both meat and blubber can also be stored in freezers.\n\nIn 2008, Faroe Islands Chief Medical Officer Høgni Debes Joensen and Pál Weihe of the Department of Public and Occupational Health recommended that pilot whales no longer be considered fit for human consumption due to the presence of DDT derivatives, PCBs and mercury in the meat. Their recommendation was based on research suggesting a correlation between mercury intake and the high rate of Parkinson's disease on the islands. As of 1 June 2011, the Faroese Food and Veterinary Authority has advised Faroe Islanders not to eat the kidney or liver of pilot whales, not to consume more than one serving per month, and, for women and girls, to refrain from eating blubber if they plan to have children and to refrain from whale meat entirely if they are breastfeeding, pregnant or planning to conceive in the following three months.\n\nDuring World War II the British Minister of Food introduced food rationing but allowed whale meat to be distributed 'off ration'. It was not popular because of the smell whilst cooking was deemed 'unpleasant', and the taste was considered 'bland' even when spiced.\n\nDuring the post-World War II period in the United Kingdom, corned whale meat was available as an unrationed alternative to other meats. Sold under the name \"whacon\", the meat was described as \"corned whalemeat with its fishy flavour removed\", and was almost identical to corned beef, except \"brownish instead of red\". The Food Ministry emphasised its high nutritional value.\n\nTests have revealed that in whale meat sold in Japan, high levels of mercury and other toxins are present. A research study was conducted by Tetsuya Endo, Koichi Haraguchi and Masakatsu Sakata at the University of Hokkaido found high levels of mercury in the organs of whales, particularly the liver. They stated that \"Acute intoxication could result from a single ingestion\" of liver. The study found that liver samples for sale in Japan contained, on average, 370 micrograms of mercury per gram of meat, 900 times the government's limit. Levels detected in kidneys and lungs were approximately 100 times higher than the limit. The effect is due to the animal's trophic level, however, rather than its size. This means that there is a significant difference between the mercury levels in toothed whales and baleen whales, the former having a much higher concentration.\n\nNorwegian-based High North Alliance, has suggested that the carbon footprint resulting from eating whale meat is substantially lower than that of beef. Greenpeace has responded that, \"The survival of a species is more important than lower greenhouse gas emissions from eating it.\" Many organizations, including Greenpeace and the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society, have criticised the whale trade for preying on endangered species, as studies have shown an alarming decrease in whale populations, which may significantly affect oceans and its foodchains, therefore it may affect lives in a foreseable future.\n\nGroups such as the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society have attempted to disrupt commercial whaling with varying degrees of success.\n\n\n\n\n"}

He was convicted of killing four people out of his 5 confirmed murders, but could possibly have upwards of 6 victims.\n\nSzabó was born into a farmer's family in 1968, and had lived on a farm since his youth. He studied until the eight grade in elementary school, refusing to study any more. His father died early, and his brother who lived on the farm committed suicide. He had a violent partner, frequently interrupting contact with her. Szabó then began living alone as a farmer and casual worker on his farm, but also participated in a special farmers' work organization which accommodated seasonal workers from Romania who came during the agricultural season. During the second half of the 1990s, the traffic near Balástya grew, as the civil war in Yugoslavia had recently ended and many passed through the 5th Highway along the settlement. The increasing turnover of the highway attracted businesses, criminals, merchants and prostitutes to the settlement, including some of Szabó's future victims.\n\nSzabó's first proven murder was of a woman working in the press, with whom he met on April 28, 1998. He managed to persuade her to stay on his farm on the outskirts of Balástya. Upon their arrival, the woman was hit with a heavy object several times, dying from the severe head injuries. Szabó then dismembered his victim and buried her body in a pit 50 meters away from the farm, in which he also placed her clothes. The second murder took place in a similar fashion. Szabó met another woman whom he persuaded to come to his farm. When she came, he hit her with heavy object on the head and neck, with the woman dying from the heavy blows. The body was then dismembered and placed in the same pit as before, the only difference being that the second victim's head was never discovered.\n\nIn February 2000, on the pretext of the joint mugging of a group of firefighters, Szabó killed Teresia K. The woman was strangled in an orchard, and was then mutilated and burned. Her clothes were never found either.\n\nThe fourt proven murder led to Szabó's downfall. In August 2001, he convinced a female dealer who used to sell radios and telephones that she would get a large amount of phones at a favorable price. The woman believed him, and on August 25 she collected 300,000 forints from the bank. The woman then drove to Szabó's farm, where she was strangled by him not far from the place. The murderer then disposed of the evidence and the woman's small motorbike in a nearby water hole. However, the authorities were closely monitoring the disappearances, and when the phone dealer disappeared, they searched through her call lists, where they found Zoltán Szabó's number. When questioned, he confessed to the murder. Later on, when more corpses were discovered, he confessed to these murders as well.\n\nOn August 25, 1998, Szabó supposedly forced prostitute Mónika K. to leave the 5th Highway car park and go to his farm. There, he strangled her in a nearby orchard and dragged the body to a track near the Cegléd-Szeged railway line. Subsequently, a freight train and two other trains ran over the body, completely crushing it. Although Szabó was last seen in her company, the court could not definitely prove that he was the culprit, and he was not convicted of Mónika K.'s murder.\n\nSzabó also mentioned a sixth murder, which he claimed to have not committed but simply knew of. The investigators doubted his claim of innocence, but the post-mortum investigation proved ineffective, and so this case was included in the indictment.\n\nThe police investigator who headed the investigation also stated that he was certain Szabó was responsible for more murders. The detective, referring to a witness' testimony, wrote that Szabó was responsible for the disappearances of a Romanian family of five. He was so confident of his opinion that he offered 500,000 forints to Szabó for each new corpse he showed the location to.\n\nAfter Szabó's capture, extensive research began for the killer's victims. According to his testimony, the area was searched, and in the given locations unexplored excavations with unprecedented landscaping scales were never found in Balástya. During the search, the four corpses from Szabó's testimonies were located, but no remnants of other murders were found. Despite this, the prosecution suspected him of murdering five women.\n\nThe Csongrád County court, which was serving at first instance level, found Zoltán Szabó guilty of all four murders and sentenced him to life imprisonment in November 2003. On September 10, 2004, the Szeged Court Judge sentenced to life imprisonment for a final time. The Trial Chamber could not find any evidence that Szabó's murders involved sexual aberration, and there was no mention of this \"other despicable reason\" in the judgment.\n\nThe farm where Szabó's offenses were committed still stands as of 2015. The offender was detained in the secluded area of the Star Prison in Szeged. On December 5, 2016, the suicidal Szabó and his cellmate hanged themselves.\n\n"}
