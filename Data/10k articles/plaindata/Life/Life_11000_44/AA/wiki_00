Nevertheless, several Bavandid princes continued to rule in small local parts of Mazandaran. Abu Ja'far, a son of a certain Vandarin, is mentioned as the ruler of Bavand dynasty. It is not known if Abu Ja'far was the successor of Al-Marzuban or not. Abu Ja'far, during his reign, was a vassal of the Buyid ruler Majd al-Dawla (r. 997–1029), who was himself of Bavandid descent through his mother Sayyida Khatun.\n\nIbn Fuladh, a Daylamite military officer, who claimed Qazvin for himself, revolted against Majd al-Dawla in 1016. Majd al-Dawla, however, refused to make him governor of Qazvin, which made Ibn Fuladh threaten him around the countryside of his capital in Ray. Majd al-Dawla then requested the aid of Abu Ja'far, who managed to defeat Ibn Fuladh and repel him from Ray. Ibn Fuladh then requested aid from the Ziyarid ruler Manuchihr (r. 1012–1031). Ibn Fuladh agreed to become Manuchihr's vassal in return for his aid. The following year, a combined army of Ibn Fuladh and Manuchihr besieged Ray, which forced Majd al-Dawla to make Ibn Fuladh the governor of Isfahan.\n\nIn 1023, the Kakuyid ruler Muhammad ibn Rustam Dushmanziyar (r. 1008-1041), who was himself of Bavandid descent, revolted against the Buyids, and seized Hamadan from the Buyid ruler Sama' al-Dawla (r. 1021-1023). He spent the following years in protecting his realm from invasions by the forces of Abu Ja'far. Five years later, Majd al-Dawla sent a combined Buyid-Bavandid army under Abu Ja'far and his two sons against Muhammad. Muhammad, however, managed win a great victory over the Buyid-Bavandid army at Nahavand, and managed to capture Abu Ja'far including his two sons. Abu Ja'far died one year later in prison, and after his death, the Bavandids disappears from sources, and are first later mentioned in 1057 under the Bavandid ruler Qarin II.\n\nDuring his reign, Abu Ja'far ordered the construction of the \"Mil-e Radkan\" near Gorgan, where he was later buried. The building of the tower was completed in 1016, between 7 September-5 October—several inscriptions are written on the entrance, both in Arabic and Pahlavi, which states;\n\nAnother inscription, states the following; \n\n"}

{"id": "85234", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=85234", "title": "Amelia Earhart", "text": "Amelia Earhart\n\nAmelia Mary Earhart (, born July 24, 1897; disappeared July 2, 1937) was an American aviation pioneer and author. Earhart was the first female aviator to fly solo across the Atlantic Ocean. She received the United States Distinguished Flying Cross for this accomplishment. She set many other records, wrote best-selling books about her flying experiences and was instrumental in the formation of The Ninety-Nines, an organization for female pilots. In 1935, Earhart became a visiting faculty member at Purdue University as an advisor to aeronautical engineering and a career counselor to women students. She was also a member of the National Woman's Party and an early supporter of the Equal Rights Amendment.\n\nDuring an attempt to make a circumnavigational flight of the globe in 1937 in a Purdue-funded Lockheed Model 10-E Electra, Earhart and navigator Fred Noonan disappeared over the central Pacific Ocean near Howland Island. Fascination with her life, career, and disappearance continues to this day.\n\nEarhart was the daughter of Samuel \"Edwin\" Stanton Earhart (1867–1930) and Amelia \"Amy\" (; 1869–1962). She was born in Atchison, Kansas, in the home of her maternal grandfather, Alfred Gideon Otis (1827–1912), who was a former federal judge, the president of the Atchison Savings Bank and a leading citizen in the town. Amelia was the second child of the marriage, after an infant was stillborn in August 1896. She was of part German descent. Alfred Otis had not initially favored the marriage and was not satisfied with Edwin's progress as a lawyer.\n\nAccording to family custom, Earhart was named after her two grandmothers, Amelia Josephine Harres and Mary Wells Patton. From an early age, Amelia was the ringleader while her sister Grace Muriel Earhart (1899–1998), two years her junior, acted as the dutiful follower. Amelia was nicknamed \"Meeley\" (sometimes \"Millie\") and Grace was nicknamed \"Pidge\"; both girls continued to answer to their childhood nicknames well into adulthood. Their upbringing was unconventional since Amy Earhart did not believe in molding her children into \"nice little girls\". Meanwhile their maternal grandmother disapproved of the \"bloomers\" worn by Amy's children and although Earhart liked the freedom they provided, she was aware other girls in the neighborhood did not wear them.\n\nA spirit of adventure seemed to abide in the Earhart children, with the pair setting off daily to explore their neighborhood. As a child, Earhart spent long hours playing with sister Pidge, climbing trees, hunting rats with a rifle and \"belly-slamming\" her sled downhill. Although the love of the outdoors and \"rough-and-tumble\" play was common to many youngsters, some biographers have characterized the young Earhart as a tomboy. The girls kept \"worms, moths, katydids and a tree toad\" in a growing collection gathered in their outings. In 1904, with the help of her uncle, she cobbled together a home-made ramp fashioned after a roller coaster she had seen on a trip to St. Louis and secured the ramp to the roof of the family toolshed. Earhart's well-documented first flight ended dramatically. She emerged from the broken wooden box that had served as a sled with a bruised lip, torn dress and a \"sensation of exhilaration\". She exclaimed, \"Oh, Pidge, it's just like flying!\"\n\nAlthough there had been some missteps in Edwin Earhart's career up to that point, in 1907 his job as a claims officer for the Rock Island Railroad led to a transfer to Des Moines, Iowa. The next year, at the age of 10, Earhart saw her first aircraft at the Iowa State Fair in Des Moines. Her father tried to interest her and her sister in taking a flight. One look at the rickety \"flivver\" was enough for Earhart, who promptly asked if they could go back to the merry-go-round. She later described the biplane as \"a thing of rusty wire and wood and not at all interesting\".\n\nThe two sisters, Amelia and Muriel (she went by her middle name from her teens on), remained with their grandparents in Atchison, while their parents moved into new, smaller quarters in Des Moines. During this period, Earhart received a form of home-schooling together with her sister, from her mother and a governess. She later recounted that she was \"exceedingly fond of reading\" and spent countless hours in the large family library. In 1909, when the family was finally reunited in Des Moines, the Earhart children were enrolled in public school for the first time with Amelia Earhart entering the seventh grade at the age of 12 years.\n\nWhile the family's finances seemingly improved with the acquisition of a new house and even the hiring of two servants, it soon became apparent that Edwin was an alcoholic. Five years later in 1914, he was forced to retire and although he attempted to rehabilitate himself through treatment, he was never reinstated at the Rock Island Railroad. At about this time, Earhart's grandmother Amelia Otis died suddenly, leaving a substantial estate that placed her daughter's share in a trust, fearing that Edwin's drinking would drain the funds. The Otis house was auctioned along with all of its contents; Earhart was heartbroken and later described it as the end of her childhood.\n\nIn 1915, after a long search, Earhart's father found work as a clerk at the Great Northern Railway in St. Paul, Minnesota, where Earhart entered Central High School as a junior. Edwin applied for a transfer to Springfield, Missouri, in 1915 but the current claims officer reconsidered his retirement and demanded his job back, leaving the elder Earhart with nowhere to go. Facing another calamitous move, Amy Earhart took her children to Chicago, where they lived with friends. Earhart made an unusual condition in the choice of her next schooling; she canvassed nearby high schools in Chicago to find the best science program. She rejected the high school nearest her home when she complained that the chemistry lab was \"just like a kitchen sink\". She eventually enrolled in Hyde Park High School but spent a miserable semester where a yearbook caption captured the essence of her unhappiness, \"A.E. – the girl in brown who walks alone\".\n\nEarhart graduated from Chicago's Hyde Park High School in 1916. Throughout her troubled childhood, she had continued to aspire to a future career; she kept a scrapbook of newspaper clippings about successful women in predominantly male-oriented fields, including film direction and production, law, advertising, management and mechanical engineering. She began junior college at Ogontz School in Rydal, Pennsylvania, but did not complete her program.\n\nDuring Christmas vacation in 1917, Earhart visited her sister in Toronto. World War I had been raging and Earhart saw the returning wounded soldiers. After receiving training as a nurse's aide from the Red Cross, she began work with the Voluntary Aid Detachment at Spadina Military Hospital. Her duties included preparing food in the kitchen for patients with special diets and handing out prescribed medication in the hospital's dispensary.\n\nWhen the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic reached Toronto, Earhart was engaged in arduous nursing duties that included night shifts at the Spadina Military Hospital. She became a patient herself, suffering from pneumonia and maxillary sinusitis. She was hospitalized in early November 1918, owing to pneumonia, and discharged in December 1918, about two months after the illness had started. Her sinus-related symptoms were pain and pressure around one eye and copious mucus drainage via the nostrils and throat. While staying in the hospital during the pre-antibiotic era, she had painful minor operations to wash out the affected maxillary sinus, but these procedures were not successful and Earhart subsequently suffered from worsening headaches. Her convalescence lasted nearly a year, which she spent at her sister's home in Northampton, Massachusetts. She passed the time by reading poetry, learning to play the banjo and studying mechanics. Chronic sinusitis significantly affected Earhart's flying and activities in later life, and sometimes even on the airfield she was forced to wear a bandage on her cheek to cover a small drainage tube.\n\nAt about that time, Earhart and a young woman friend visited an air fair held in conjunction with the Canadian National Exhibition in Toronto. One of the highlights of the day was a flying exhibition put on by a World War I ace. The pilot overhead spotted Earhart and her friend, who were watching from an isolated clearing, and dived at them. \"I am sure he said to himself, 'Watch me make them scamper,'\" she said. Earhart stood her ground as the aircraft came close. \"I did not understand it at the time,\" she said, \"but I believe that little red airplane said something to me as it swished by.\"\n\nBy 1919 Earhart prepared to enter Smith College but changed her mind and enrolled at Columbia University, in a course in medical studies among other programs. She quit a year later to be with her parents, who had reunited in California.\n\nIn Long Beach, on December 28, 1920, Earhart and her father visited an airfield where Frank Hawks (who later gained fame as an air racer) gave her a ride that would forever change Earhart's life. \"By the time I had got two or three hundred feet [60–90 m] off the ground,\" she said, \"I knew I had to fly.\" After that 10-minute flight (which cost her father $10), she immediately determined to learn to fly. Working at a variety of jobs including photographer, truck driver, and stenographer at the local telephone company, she managed to save $1,000 for flying lessons. Earhart had her first lesson on January 3, 1921, at Kinner Field near Long Beach. Her teacher was Anita \"Neta\" Snook, a pioneer female aviator who used a surplus Curtiss JN-4 \"Canuck\" for training. Earhart arrived with her father and a singular request: \"I want to fly. Will you teach me?\" In order to reach the airfield, Earhart had to take a bus to the end of the line, then walk four miles (6 km). Earhart's mother also provided part of the $1,000 \"stake\" against her \"better judgement\".\n\nEarhart's commitment to flying required her to accept the frequent hard work and rudimentary conditions that accompanied early aviation training. She chose a leather jacket, but aware that other aviators would be judging her, she slept in it for three nights to give the jacket a \"worn\" look. To complete her image transformation, she also cropped her hair short in the style of other female flyers. Six months later, Earhart purchased a secondhand bright yellow Kinner Airster biplane she nicknamed \"The Canary\". On October 22, 1922, Earhart flew the Airster to an altitude of , setting a world record for female pilots. On May 15, 1923, Earhart became the 16th woman in the United States to be issued a pilot's license (#\"6017\") by the Fédération Aéronautique Internationale (FAI). \n\nThroughout the early 1920s, following a disastrous investment in a failed gypsum mine, Earhart's inheritance from her grandmother, which was now administered by her mother, steadily diminished until it was exhausted. Consequently, with no immediate prospects for recouping her investment in flying, Earhart sold the \"Canary\" as well as a second Kinner and bought a yellow Kissel \"Speedster\" two-passenger automobile, which she named the \"Yellow Peril\". Simultaneously, Earhart experienced an exacerbation of her old sinus problem as her pain worsened and in early 1924 she was hospitalized for another sinus operation, which was again unsuccessful. After trying her hand at a number of unusual ventures that included setting up a photography company, Earhart set out in a new direction.\n\nFollowing her parents' divorce in 1924, she drove her mother in the \"Yellow Peril\" on a transcontinental trip from California with stops throughout the West and even a jaunt up to Banff, Alberta. The meandering tour eventually brought the pair to Boston, Massachusetts, where Earhart underwent another sinus operation which was more successful. After recuperation, she returned to Columbia University for several months but was forced to abandon her studies and any further plans for enrolling at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, because her mother could no longer afford the tuition fees and associated costs. Soon after, she found employment first as a teacher, then as a social worker in 1925 at Denison House, a Boston settlement house. At this time, she lived in Medford, Massachusetts.\n\nWhen Earhart lived in Medford, she maintained her interest in aviation, becoming a member of the American Aeronautical Society's Boston chapter and was eventually elected its vice president. She flew out of Dennison Airport (later the Naval Air Station Squantum) in Quincy, Massachusetts, and helped finance its operation by investing a small sum of money. Earhart also flew the first official flight out of Dennison Airport in 1927. Along with acting as a sales representative for Kinner aircraft in the Boston area, Earhart wrote local newspaper columns promoting flying and as her local celebrity grew, she laid out the plans for an organization devoted to female flyers.\n\nAfter Charles Lindbergh's solo flight across the Atlantic in 1927, Amy Guest (1873–1959) expressed interest in being the first woman to fly (or be flown) across the Atlantic Ocean. After deciding that the trip was too perilous for her to undertake, she offered to sponsor the project, suggesting that they find \"another girl with the right image\". While at work one afternoon in April 1928, Earhart got a phone call from Capt. Hilton H. Railey, who asked her, \"Would you like to fly the Atlantic?\"\n\nThe project coordinators (including book publisher and publicist George P. Putnam) interviewed Earhart and asked her to accompany pilot Wilmer Stultz and copilot/mechanic Louis Gordon on the flight, nominally as a passenger, but with the added duty of keeping the flight log. The team departed from Trepassey Harbor, Newfoundland, in a Fokker F.VIIb/3m on June 17, 1928, landing at Pwll near Burry Port, South Wales, exactly 20 hours and 40 minutes later. There is a commemorative blue plaque at the site. Since most of the flight was on instruments and Earhart had no training for this type of flying, she did not pilot the aircraft. When interviewed after landing, she said, \"Stultz did all the flying—had to. I was just baggage, like a sack of potatoes.\" She added, \"... maybe someday I'll try it alone.\"\n\nEarhart reportedly received a rousing welcome on June 19, 1928, when she landed at Woolston in Southampton, England. She flew the Avro Avian 594 Avian III, SN: R3/AV/101 owned by Lady Mary Heath and later purchased the aircraft and had it shipped back to the United States (where it was assigned \"unlicensed aircraft identification mark\" 7083).\n\nWhen the Stultz, Gordon and Earhart flight crew returned to the United States, they were greeted with a ticker-tape parade along the Canyon of Heroes in Manhattan, followed by a reception with President Calvin Coolidge at the White House.\n\nTrading on her physical resemblance to Lindbergh, whom the press had dubbed \"Lucky Lindy\", some newspapers and magazines began referring to Earhart as \"Lady Lindy\". The United Press was more grandiloquent; to them, Earhart was the reigning \"Queen of the Air\". Immediately after her return to the United States, she undertook an exhausting lecture tour in 1928 and 1929. Meanwhile, Putnam had undertaken to heavily promote her in a campaign that included publishing a book she authored, a series of new lecture tours and using pictures of her in mass market endorsements for products including luggage, Lucky Strike cigarettes (this caused image problems for her, with \"McCall's\" magazine retracting an offer) and women's clothing and sportswear. The money that she made with \"Lucky Strike\" had been earmarked for a $1,500 donation to Commander Richard Byrd's imminent South Pole expedition.\n\nThe marketing campaign by both Earhart and Putnam was successful in establishing the Earhart mystique in the public psyche. Rather than simply endorsing the products, Earhart actively became involved in the promotions, especially in women's fashions. For a number of years she had sewn her own clothes, but the \"active living\" lines that were sold in 50 stores such as Macy's in metropolitan areas were an expression of a new Earhart image. Her concept of simple, natural lines matched with wrinkle-proof, washable materials was the embodiment of a sleek, purposeful but feminine \"A.E.\" (the familiar name she went by with family and friends). The luggage line that she promoted (marketed as Modernaire Earhart Luggage) also bore her unmistakable stamp.\n\nA wide range of promotional items bearing the Earhart name appeared.\n\nCelebrity endorsements helped Earhart finance her flying. Accepting a position as associate editor at \"Cosmopolitan\" magazine, she turned this forum into an opportunity to campaign for greater public acceptance of aviation, especially focusing on the role of women entering the field. In 1929, Earhart was among the first aviators to promote commercial air travel through the development of a passenger airline service; along with Charles Lindbergh, she represented Transcontinental Air Transport (TAT, later TWA) and invested time and money in setting up the first regional shuttle service between New York and Washington, D.C., the Ludington Airline. She was a Vice President of National Airways, which conducted the flying operations of the Boston-Maine Airways and several other airlines in the northeast. By 1940, it had become Northeast Airlines.\n\nAlthough Earhart had gained fame for her transatlantic flight, she endeavored to set an \"untarnished\" record of her own. Shortly after her return, piloting Avian \"7083\", she set off on her first long solo flight that occurred just as her name was coming into the national spotlight. By making the trip in August 1928, Earhart became the first woman to fly solo across the North American continent and back. Her piloting skills and professionalism gradually grew, as acknowledged by experienced professional pilots who flew with her. General Leigh Wade flew with Earhart in 1929: \"She was a born flier, with a delicate touch on the stick.\"\n\nEarhart subsequently made her first attempt at competitive air racing in 1929 during the first Santa Monica-to-Cleveland Women's Air Derby (nicknamed the \"Powder Puff Derby\" by Will Rogers), which left Santa Monica on August 18 and arrived at Cleveland on August 26. During the race, she settled into fourth place in the \"heavy planes\" division. At the second last stop at Columbus, her friend Ruth Nichols, who was coming third, had an accident while on a test flight before the race recommenced. Nichols' aircraft hit a tractor at the start of the runway and flipped over, forcing her out of the race. At Cleveland, Earhart was placed third in the heavy division.\n\nIn 1930, Earhart became an official of the National Aeronautic Association where she actively promoted the establishment of separate women's records and was instrumental in the Fédération Aéronautique Internationale (FAI) accepting a similar international standard. In 1931, she set a world altitude record of 18,415 feet (5,613 m), flying a Pitcairn PCA-2 autogyro borrowed from Beech-Nut Chewing Gum While to a reader today it might seem that Earhart was engaged in flying \"stunts\", she was, with other female flyers, crucial to making the American public \"air minded\" and convincing them that \"aviation was no longer just for daredevils and supermen.\"\n\nDuring this period, Earhart became involved with The Ninety-Nines, an organization of female pilots providing moral support and advancing the cause of women in aviation. She had called a meeting of female pilots in 1929 following the Women's Air Derby. She suggested the name based on the number of the charter members; she later became the organization's first president in 1930. Earhart was a vigorous advocate for female pilots and when the 1934 Bendix Trophy Race banned women, she openly refused to fly screen actress Mary Pickford to Cleveland to open the races.\n\nEarhart was engaged to Samuel Chapman, a chemical engineer from Boston; she broke off the engagement on November 23, 1928. During the same period, Earhart and publisher George P. Putnam had spent a great deal of time together. Putnam, who was known as GP, was divorced in 1929 and sought out Earhart, proposing to her six times before she finally agreed to marry him. After substantial hesitation on her part, they married on February 7, 1931, in Putnam's mother's house in Noank, Connecticut. Earhart referred to her marriage as a \"partnership\" with \"dual control\". In a letter written to Putnam and hand delivered to him on the day of the wedding, she wrote, \"I want you to understand I shall not hold you to any midaevil code of faithfulness to me nor shall I consider myself bound to you similarly.\"\n\nEarhart's ideas on marriage were liberal for the time as she believed in equal responsibilities for both breadwinners and pointedly kept her own name rather than being referred to as \"Mrs. Putnam\". When \"The New York Times\", per the rules of its stylebook, insisted on referring to her as Mrs. Putnam, she laughed it off. Putnam also learned that he would be called \"Mr. Earhart\". There was no honeymoon for the newlyweds as Earhart was involved in a nine-day cross-country tour promoting autogyros and the tour sponsor, Beech-Nut chewing gum. Although Earhart and Putnam never had children, he had two sons by his previous marriage to Dorothy Binney (1888–1982), a chemical heiress whose father's company, Binney & Smith, invented Crayola crayons: the explorer and writer David Binney Putnam (1913–1992) and George Palmer Putnam, Jr. (1921–2013). Earhart was especially fond of David, who frequently visited his father at their family home, which was on the grounds of The Apawamis Club in Rye, New York. George had contracted polio shortly after his parents' separation and was unable to visit as often.\n\nOn the morning of May 20, 1932, 34-year-old Earhart set off from Harbour Grace, Newfoundland, with a copy of the \"Telegraph-Journal\", given to her by journalist Stuart Trueman, intended to confirm the date of the flight. She intended to fly to Paris in her single engine Lockheed Vega 5B to emulate Charles Lindbergh's solo flight five years earlier. Her technical advisor for the flight was famed Norwegian American aviator Bernt Balchen who helped prepare her aircraft. He also played the role of \"decoy\" for the press as he was ostensibly preparing Earhart's Vega for his own Arctic flight. After a flight lasting 14 hours, 56 minutes during which she contended with strong northerly winds, icy conditions and mechanical problems, Earhart landed in a pasture at Culmore, north of Derry, Northern Ireland. The landing was witnessed by Cecil King and T. Sawyer. When a farm hand asked, \"Have you flown far?\" Earhart replied, \"From America\".\n\nAs the first woman to fly solo nonstop across the Atlantic, Earhart received the Distinguished Flying Cross from Congress, the Cross of Knight of the Legion of Honor from the French Government and the Gold Medal of the National Geographic Society from President Herbert Hoover. As her fame grew, she developed friendships with many people in high offices, most notably First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt. Roosevelt shared many of Earhart's interests and passions, especially women's causes. After flying with Earhart, Roosevelt obtained a student permit but did not further pursue her plans to learn to fly. The two friends communicated frequently throughout their lives. Another famous flyer, Jacqueline Cochran, who was considered to be Earhart's greatest rival by both media and the public, also became a confidante and friend during this period.\n\nOn January 11, 1935, Earhart became the first aviator to fly solo from Honolulu, Hawaii to Oakland, California. Although this transoceanic flight had been attempted by many others, notably by the unfortunate participants in the 1927 Dole Air Race that had reversed the route, her trailblazing flight had been mainly routine, with no mechanical breakdowns. In her final hours, she even relaxed and listened to \"the broadcast of the Metropolitan Opera from New York\".\n\nThat year, once more flying her Lockheed Vega airliner that Earhart had tagged \"old Bessie, the fire horse\", she flew solo from Los Angeles to Mexico City on April 19. The next record attempt was a nonstop flight from Mexico City to New York. Setting off on May 8, her flight was uneventful although the large crowds that greeted her at Newark, New Jersey were a concern, because she had to be careful not to taxi into the throng.\n\nEarhart again participated in long-distance air racing, placing fifth in the 1935 Bendix Trophy Race, the best result she could manage, due to the stock Lockheed Vega, topping out at , was outclassed by purpose-built air racers that reached more than . The race had been a particularly difficult one as a competitor, Cecil Allen, died in a fiery takeoff mishap and rival Jacqueline Cochran was forced to pull out due to mechanical problems, the \"blinding fog\", and violent thunderstorms that plagued the race.\n\nBetween 1930 and 1935, Earhart had set seven women's speed and distance aviation records in a variety of aircraft including the Kinner Airster, Lockheed Vega, and Pitcairn Autogiro. By 1935, recognizing the limitations of her \"lovely red Vega\" in long, transoceanic flights, Earhart contemplated, in her own words, a new \"prize ... one flight which I most wanted to attempt – a circumnavigation of the globe as near its waistline as could be\". For the new venture, she would need a new aircraft.\n\nWhile Earhart was away on a speaking tour in late November 1934, a fire broke out at the Putnam residence in Rye, destroying many family treasures and Earhart's personal mementos. Putnam had already sold his interest in the New York based publishing company to his cousin, Palmer Putnam. Following the fire, the couple decided to move to the West Coast, where Putnam took up his new position as head of the editorial board of Paramount Pictures in North Hollywood. While speaking in California in late 1934, Earhart had contacted Hollywood \"stunt\" pilot Paul Mantz in order to improve her flying, focusing especially on long-distance flying in her Vega and wanted to move closer to him.\n\nAt Earhart's urging, Putnam purchased a small house in June 1935 adjacent to the clubhouse of the Lakeside Golf Club in Toluca Lake, a San Fernando Valley celebrity enclave community nestled between the Warner Brothers and Universal Pictures studio complexes where they had earlier rented a temporary residence. Earhart and Putnam would not move in immediately, however; they decided to do considerable remodeling and enlarge the existing small structure to meet their needs. This delayed the occupation of their new home for several months.\n\nIn September 1935, Earhart and Mantz formally established a business partnership that they had been considering since late 1934 by creating the short-lived Earhart-Mantz Flying School, which Mantz controlled and operated through his aviation company, United Air Services. The company was located at the Burbank Airport, about five miles (8 km) from Earhart's Toluca Lake home. Putnam handled publicity for the school that primarily taught instrument flying using Link Trainers.\n\nIn 1935, Earhart joined Purdue University as a visiting faculty member to counsel women on careers and as a technical advisor to its Department of Aeronautics. Early in 1936, Earhart started planning a round-the-world flight. Although others had flown around the world, her flight would be the longest at 29,000 miles (47,000 km) because it followed a roughly equatorial route. With financing from Purdue, in July 1936, a Lockheed Electra 10E was built at Lockheed Aircraft Company to her specifications, which included extensive modifications to the fuselage to incorporate many additional fuel tanks. Earhart dubbed the twin engine monoplane her \"flying laboratory\". The plane was built at Lockheed's Burbank, California plant, and after delivery it was hangared at Mantz's United Air Services, which was just across the airfield from the Lockheed plant.\n\nAlthough the Electra was publicized as a \"flying laboratory\", little useful science was planned and the flight was arranged around Earhart's intention to circumnavigate the globe along with gathering raw material and public attention for her next book. Earhart chose Captain Harry Manning as her navigator; he had been the captain of the , the ship that had brought Earhart back from Europe in 1928. Manning was not only a navigator, but he was also a skilled radio operator who knew Morse code.\n\nThrough contacts in the Los Angeles aviation community, Fred Noonan was subsequently chosen as a second navigator because there were significant additional factors that had to be dealt with while using celestial navigation for aircraft. He had vast experience in both marine (he was a licensed ship's captain) and flight navigation. Noonan had recently left Pan Am, where he established most of the company's China Clipper seaplane routes across the Pacific. Noonan had also been responsible for training Pan American's navigators for the route between San Francisco and Manila. The original plans were for Noonan to navigate from Hawaii to Howland Island, a particularly difficult portion of the flight; then Manning would continue with Earhart to Australia and she would proceed on her own for the remainder of the project.\n\nOn March 17, 1937, Earhart and her crew flew the first leg from Oakland, California to Honolulu, Hawaii. In addition to Earhart and Noonan, Harry Manning and Mantz (who was acting as Earhart's technical advisor) were on board. Due to lubrication and galling problems with the propeller hubs' variable pitch mechanisms, the aircraft needed servicing in Hawaii. Ultimately, the Electra ended up at the United States Navy's Luke Field on Ford Island in Pearl Harbor. The flight resumed three days later from Luke Field with Earhart, Noonan and Manning on board. During the takeoff run, there was an uncontrolled ground-loop, the forward landing gear collapsed, both propellers hit the ground, the plane skidded on its belly, and a portion of the runway was damaged. The cause of the ground-loop is controversial. Some witnesses at Luke Field, including the Associated Press journalist, said they saw a tire blow. Earhart thought either the Electra's right tire had blown and/or the right landing gear had collapsed. Some sources, including Mantz, cited pilot error.\n\nWith the aircraft severely damaged, the flight was called off and the aircraft was shipped by sea to the Lockheed Burbank facility for repairs.\n\nWhile the Electra was being repaired Earhart and Putnam secured additional funds and prepared for a second attempt. This time flying west to east, the second attempt began with an unpublicized flight from Oakland to Miami, Florida, and after arriving there Earhart publicly announced her plans to circumnavigate the globe. The flight's opposite direction was partly the result of changes in global wind and weather patterns along the planned route since the earlier attempt. On this second flight, Fred Noonan was Earhart's only crew member. The pair departed Miami on June 1 and after numerous stops in South America, Africa, the Indian subcontinent and Southeast Asia, arrived at Lae, New Guinea, on June 29, 1937. At this stage about 22,000 miles (35,000 km) of the journey had been completed. The remaining 7,000 miles (11,000 km) would be over the Pacific.\n\nOn <time datetime=\"1937-07-02T00:00Z\">July 2, 1937, midnight GMT</time>, Earhart and Noonan took off from Lae Airfield () in the heavily loaded Electra. Their intended destination was Howland Island (), a flat sliver of land 6,500 ft (2,000 m) long and 1,600 ft (500 m) wide, 10 ft (3 m) high and away.\n\nThe aircraft departed Lae with about 1100 gallons of gasoline. In March 1937, Kelly Johnson had recommended engine and altitude settings for the Electra. One of the recommended schedules was:\n\nEarhart used part of the above schedule for the Oakland to Honolulu leg of the first world flight attempt. Johnson estimated that 900 gallons of fuel would provide 40% more range than required for that leg. Using 900 gallons was 250 gallons less than the Electra's maximum fuel tank capacity; that meant a weight savings of , so Earhart included Mantz as a passenger on that leg. The Oakland to Honolulu leg had Earhart, Noonan, Manning, and Mantz on board. The flight from Oakland to Honolulu took 16 hours. The Electra also loaded 900 gallons of fuel for the shorter Honolulu to Howland leg (with only Earhart, Noonan, and Manning on board), but the airplane crashed on take off; the crash ended the first world flight attempt.\n\nAround <time datetime=\"1937-07-02T15:00+10:00\">3 pm Lae time</time>, Earhart reported her altitude as 10000 feet but that they would reduce altitude due to thick clouds. Around <time datetime=\"1937-07-02T17:00+10:00\">5 pm</time>, Earhart reported her altitude as 7000 feet and speed as 150 knots.\n\nTheir last known position report was near the Nukumanu Islands, about into the flight.\n\nDuring the flight, Noonan may have been able to do some celestial navigation to determine his position. The plane would cross the International Dateline during the flight; failing to account for the dateline could account for a 1° or 60 mile position error.\n\nThe Electra had radio equipment for both communication and navigation, but details about that equipment are not clear. The Electra failed to establish two-way radio communications with \"Itasca\" and failed to radiolocate \"Itasca\". Many explanations have been proposed for those failures.\n\nThe plane had a modified Western Electric model 13C transmitter. The 50-watt transmitter was crystal controlled and capable of transmitting on 500 kHz, 3105 kHz, and 6210 kHz. Crystal control means that the transmitter cannot be tuned to other frequencies; the plane could transmit only on those three frequencies. The transmitter had been modified at the factory to provide the 500 kHz capability.\n\nThe plane had a modified Western Electric model 20B receiver. Ordinarily, the receiver covered four frequency bands: 188–420 kHz, 550–1500 kHz, 1500–4000 kHz, and 4000–10000 kHz. The receiver was modified to lower the frequencies in the second band to 485–1200 kHz. That modification allowed the reception of 500 kHz signals; such signals were used for marine distress calls and radionavigation. The model 20B receiver has two antenna inputs: a low frequency antenna input and a high frequency antenna input. The receiver's band selector also selects which antenna input is used; the first two bands use the low frequency antenna, and the last two bands select the high frequency antenna.\n\nIt is unknown whether the model 20B receiver had a beat frequency oscillator that would enable the detection of continuous wave transmissions such as Morse code and radiolocation beacons. Neither Earhart nor Noonan were capable of using Morse code. They relied on voice communications. Manning, who was on the first world flight attempt but not the second, was skilled at Morse and had acquired an FCC aircraft radiotelegraph license for 15 words per minute in March 1937, just prior to the start of the first flight.\n\nA separate automatic radio direction finder receiver, a prototype Hooven Radio Compass, had been installed in the plane in October 1936, but that receiver was removed before the flight to save weight. The Hooven Radio Compass was replaced with a Bendix coupling unit that allowed a conventional loop antenna to be attached to an existing receiver (i.e., the Western Electric 20B). The loop antenna is visible above the cockpit on Earhart's plane.\n\nAlternatively, the loop antenna may have been connected to a Bendix RA-1 auxiliary receiver with direction finding capability up to 1500 kHz. It is not clear that such a receiver was installed, and if it were, it may have been removed before the flight. describes Joe Gurr training Earhart to use a Bendix receiver and other equipment to tune radio station KFI on 640 kHz and determine its direction.\n\nWhichever receiver was used, there are pictures of Earhart's radio direction finder loop antenna and its 5-band Bendix coupling unit. The details of the loop and its coupler are not clear. claim the coupling unit adapted a standard RDF-1-B loop to the RA-1 receiver, and that the system was limited to frequencies below 1430 kHz. During the first world flight attempt's leg from Honolulu to Howland (when Manning was a navigator), \"Itasca\" was supposed to transmit a CW homing beacon at either 375 kHz or 500 kHz. At least twice during the world flight, Earhart failed to determine radio bearings at 7500 kHz. If the RDF equipment was not suitable for that frequency, then attempting such a fix would be operator error and fruitless. However, the earlier 7-band Navy RDF-1-A covered 500 kHz–8000 kHz. The later 3-band DU-1 covered 200 kHz–1600 kHz. It is not clear where the RDF-1-B or Earhart's coupler performance sits between those two units. In addition, the RDF-1-A and DU-1 coupler designs have other differences. The intention is to have the ordinary receive antenna connected to the coupler's antenna input; from there, it is passed on to the receiver. In the RDF-1-A design, the coupler must be powered on for that design function to work. In the later DU-1 design, the coupler need not be powered.\n\nThere were problems with the RDF equipment during the world flight. During the transatlantic leg of the flight (Brazil to Africa), the RDF equipment did not work. The radio direction finding station at Darwin expected to be in contact with Earhart when she arrived there, but Earhart stated that the RDF was not functioning; the problem was a blown fuse. During a test flight at Lae, Earhart could hear radio signals, but she failed to obtain an RDF bearing. While apparently near Howland Island, Earhart reported receiving a 7500 kHz signal from \"Itasca\", but she was unable to obtain an RDF bearing.\n\nThe antennas and their connections on the Electra are not certain. A dorsal Vee antenna was added by Bell Telephone Laboratories. There had been a trailing wire antenna for 500 kHz, but the Luke Field accident collapsed both landing gear and wiped off the ventral antennas. After the accident, the trailing wire antenna was removed, the dorsal antenna was modified, and a ventral antenna was installed. It is not certain, but it is likely that the dorsal antenna was only connected to the transmitter (i.e., no \"break in\" relay), and the ventral antenna was only connected to the receiver. Once the second world flight started, problems with radio reception were noticed while flying across the US; Pan Am technicians may have modified the ventral antenna while the plane was in Miami. At Lae, problems with transmission quality on 6210 kHz were noticed. Once the flight took off from Lae, Lae did not receive radio messages on 6210 kHz (Earhart's daytime frequency) until four hours later (at <time datetime=\"1937-07-02T14:18+10:00\" title=\"04:18Z\">2:18 pm</time>); Lae's last reception was at <time datetime=\"1937-07-02T17:18+10:00\" title=\"07:18Z\">5:18 pm</time> and was a strong signal; Lae received nothing after that; presumably the plane switched to 3105 kHz (Earhart's nighttime frequency). \"Itasca\" heard Earhart on 3105 kHz, but did not hear her on 6210 kHz. TIGHAR postulates that the ventral receiving antenna was scraped off while the Electra taxied to the runway at Lae; consequently, the Electra lost its ability to receive HF transmissions.\n\nThe USCGC \"Itasca\" was on station at Howland. Its task was to communicate with Earhart's Electra and guide them to the island once they arrived in the vicinity. Noonan and Earhart expected to do voice communications on 3105 kHz during the night and 6210 kHz during the day.\n\nThrough a series of misunderstandings or errors (the details of which are still controversial), the final approach to Howland Island using radio navigation was not successful. Fred Noonan had earlier written about problems affecting the accuracy of radio direction finding in navigation. Another cited cause of possible confusion was that the \"Itasca\" and Earhart planned their communication schedule using time systems set a half-hour apart, with Earhart using Greenwich Civil Time (GCT) and the \"Itasca\" under a Naval time zone designation system.\n\nThe Electra expected \"Itasca\" to transmit signals that the Electra could use as an RDF beacon to find the \"Itasca\". In theory, the plane could listen for the signal while rotating its loop antenna. A sharp minimum indicates the direction of the RDF beacon. The Electra's RDF equipment had failed due to a blown fuse during an earlier leg flying to Darwin; the fuse was replaced. Near Howland, Earhart could hear the transmission from \"Itasca\" on 7500 kHz, but she was unable to determine a minimum, so she could not determine a direction to \"Itasca\". Earhart was also unable to determine a minimum during an RDF test at Lae. One likely theory is that Earhart's RDF equipment did not work at 7500 kHz; most RDF equipment at the time was not designed to work above 2000 kHz. When operated above their design frequency, loop antennas lose their directionality.\n\n\"Itasca\" had its own RDF equipment, but that equipment did not work above 550 kHz, so \"Itasca\" could not determine the direction to the Electra's HF transmissions at 3105 and 6210 kHz. The Electra had been equipped to transmit a 500 kHz signal that \"Itasca\" could use for radio direction finding, but some of that equipment had been removed. The equipment originally used a long trailing wire antenna. While the plane was in flight, the wire antenna would be paid out at the tail; efficient transmissions at 500 kHz needed a long antenna. The antenna was bulky and heavy, so the trailing wire antenna was removed to save weight. If nothing else had been done, the plane would have been unable to transmit an RDF signal that \"Itasca\" could use. Such a modification was made, but without voice communication from \"Itasca\" to the plane, the ship could not tell the plane to use its 500 kHz signal. Even if \"Itasca\" could get a bearing to the plane, the \"Itasca\" could not tell the plane that bearing, so the plane could not head to the ship.\n\nSome sources have noted Earhart's apparent lack of understanding of her direction-finding system, which had been fitted to the aircraft just prior to the flight. The system was equipped with a new receiver from Bendix that operated on five wavelength \"bands\", marked 1 to 5. The loop antenna was equipped with a tuneable loading coil that changed the effective length of the antenna to allow it to work efficiently at different wavelengths. The tuner on the antenna was also marked with five settings, 1 to 5, but, critically, these were not the same frequency bands as the corresponding bands on the radio. The two were close enough for settings 1, 2 and 3, but the higher frequency settings, 4 and 5, were entirely different. The upper bands (4 and 5) could not be used for direction finding. Earhart's only training on the system was a brief introduction by Joe Gurr at the Lockheed factory, and the topic had not come up. A card displaying the band settings of the antenna was mounted so it was not visible. Gurr explained that higher frequency bands would offer better accuracy and longer range.\n\nMotion picture evidence from Lae suggests that an antenna mounted underneath the fuselage may have been torn off from the fuel-heavy Electra during taxi or takeoff from Lae's turf runway, though no antenna was reported found at Lae. Don Dwiggins, in his biography of Paul Mantz (who assisted Earhart and Noonan in their flight planning), noted that the aviators had cut off their long-wire antenna, due to the annoyance of having to crank it back into the aircraft after each use.\n\nDuring Earhart and Noonan's approach to Howland Island, the \"Itasca\" received strong and clear voice transmissions from Earhart identifying as KHAQQ but she apparently was unable to hear voice transmissions from the ship. Signals from the ship would also be used for direction finding, implying that the aircraft's direction finder was also not functional.\n\nThe first calls, routine reports stating the weather as cloudy and overcast, were received at <time datetime=\"1937-07-02T02:45-11:30\" title=\"14:15Z\">2:45</time> and just before <time datetime=\"1937-07-02T05:00-11:30\" title=\"16:30Z\">5 am on July 2</time>. These calls were broken up by static, but at this point the aircraft would still be a long distance from Howland.\n\nAt <time datetime=\"1937-07-02T06:14-11:30\" title=\"17:44Z\">6:14 am</time> another call was received stating the aircraft was within , and requested that the ship use its direction finder to provide a bearing for the aircraft. Earhart began whistling into the microphone to provide a continual signal for them to home in on. It was at this point that the radio operators on the \"Itasca\" realized that their RDF system could not tune in the aircraft's 3105 kHz frequency; radioman Leo Bellarts later commented that he \"was sitting there sweating blood because I couldn't do a darn thing about it.\" A similar call asking for a bearing was received at <time datetime=\"1937-07-02T06:45-11:30\" title=\"18:15Z\">6:45 am</time>, when Earhart estimated they were out.\n\nAn \"Itasca\" radio log (position 1) at 7:30–7:40 am states:\nAnother \"Itasca\" radio log (position 2) at <time datetime=\"1937-07-02T07:42-11:30\" title=\"19:12Z\">7:42 am</time> states:\nKHAQQ [Earhart's plane] CLNG ITASCA WE MUST BE ON YOU BUT CANNOT SEE U BUT GAS IS RUNNING LOW BEEN UNABLE TO REACH YOU BY RADIO WE ARE FLYING AT A 1000 FEET\n\nEarhart's <time datetime=\"1937-07-02T07:58-11:30\" title=\"19:28Z\">7:58 am</time> transmission said she couldn't hear the \"Itasca\" and asked them to send voice signals so she could try to take a radio bearing. This transmission was reported by the \"Itasca\" as the loudest possible signal, indicating Earhart and Noonan were in the immediate area. They couldn't send voice at the frequency she asked for, so Morse code signals were sent instead. Earhart acknowledged receiving these but said she was unable to determine their direction.\n\nIn her last known transmission at <time datetime=\"1937-07-02T08:43-11:30\" title=\"20:13Z\">8:43 am</time> Earhart broadcast \"We are on the line 157 337. We will repeat this message. We will repeat this on 6210 kilocycles. Wait.\" However, a few moments later she was back on the same frequency (3105 kHz) with a transmission that was logged as a \"questionable\": \"We are running on line north and south.\" Earhart's transmissions seemed to indicate she and Noonan believed they had reached Howland's charted position, which was incorrect by about five nautical miles (10 km). The \"Itasca\" used her oil-fired boilers to generate smoke for a period of time but the fliers apparently did not see it. The many scattered clouds in the area around Howland Island have also been cited as a problem: their dark shadows on the ocean surface may have been almost indistinguishable from the island's subdued and very flat profile.\n\nWhether any post-loss radio signals were received from Earhart and Noonan remains unclear. If transmissions were received from the Electra, most if not all were weak and hopelessly garbled. Earhart's voice transmissions to Howland were on 3105 kHz, a frequency restricted in the United States by the FCC to aviation use. This frequency was thought to be not fit for broadcasts over great distances. When Earhart was at cruising altitude and midway between Lae and Howland (over from each) neither station heard her scheduled transmission at <time datetime=\"1937-07-02T08:15Z\">0815 GCT</time>. Moreover, the 50-watt transmitter used by Earhart was attached to a less-than-optimum-length V-type antenna.\n\nThe last voice transmission received on Howland Island from Earhart indicated she and Noonan were flying along a line of position (running N–S on 157–337 degrees) which Noonan would have calculated and drawn on a chart as passing through Howland. After all contact was lost with Howland Island, attempts were made to reach the flyers with both voice and Morse code transmissions. Operators across the Pacific and the United States may have heard signals from the downed Electra but these were unintelligible or weak.\n\nSome of these reports of transmissions were later determined to be hoaxes but others were deemed authentic. Bearings taken by Pan American Airways stations suggested signals originating from several locations, including Gardner Island (Nikumaroro), 360 miles (580 km) to the SSE. It was noted at the time that if these signals were from Earhart and Noonan, they must have been on land with the aircraft since water would have otherwise shorted out the Electra's electrical system. Sporadic signals were reported for four or five days after the disappearance but none yielded any understandable information. The captain of later said: \"There was no doubt many stations were calling the Earhart plane on the plane's frequency, some by voice and others by signals. All of these added to the confusion and doubtfulness of the authenticity of the reports.\"\n\nBeginning approximately one hour after Earhart's last recorded message, the USCGC \"Itasca\" undertook an ultimately unsuccessful search north and west of Howland Island based on initial assumptions about transmissions from the aircraft. The United States Navy soon joined the search and over a period of about three days sent available resources to the search area in the vicinity of Howland Island. The initial search by the \"Itasca\" involved running up the 157/337 line of position to the NNW from Howland Island. The \"Itasca\" then searched the area to the immediate NE of the island, corresponding to the area, yet wider than the area searched to the NW. Based on bearings of several supposed Earhart radio transmissions, some of the search efforts were directed to a specific position on a line of 281 degrees (approximately northwest) from Howland Island without evidence of the flyers. Four days after Earhart's last verified radio transmission, on July 6, 1937, the captain of the battleship \"Colorado\" received orders from the Commandant, Fourteenth Naval District to take over all naval and coast guard units to coordinate search efforts.\n\nLater search efforts were directed to the Phoenix Islands south of Howland Island. A week after the disappearance, naval aircraft from the \"Colorado\" flew over several islands in the group including Gardner Island (now called Nikumaroro), which had been uninhabited for over 40 years. The subsequent report on Gardner read: \"Here signs of recent habitation were clearly visible but repeated circling and zooming failed to elicit any answering wave from possible inhabitants and it was finally taken for granted that none were there... At the western end of the island a tramp steamer (of about 4000 tons)... lay high and almost dry head onto the coral beach with her back broken in two places. The lagoon at Gardner looked sufficiently deep and certainly large enough so that a seaplane or even an airboat could have landed or takenoff in any direction with little if any difficulty. Given a chance, it is believed that Miss Earhart could have landed her aircraft in this lagoon and swum or waded ashore.\" They also found that Gardner's shape and size as recorded on charts were wholly inaccurate. Other Navy search efforts were again directed north, west and southwest of Howland Island, based on a possibility the Electra had ditched in the ocean, was afloat, or that the aviators were in an emergency raft.\n\nThe official search efforts lasted until July 19, 1937. At $4 million, the air and sea search by the Navy and Coast Guard was the most costly and intensive in U.S. history up to that time but search and rescue techniques during the era were rudimentary and some of the search was based on erroneous assumptions and flawed information. Official reporting of the search effort was influenced by individuals wary about how their roles in looking for an American hero might be reported by the press. Despite an unprecedented search by the United States Navy and Coast Guard, no physical evidence of Earhart, Noonan or the Electra 10E was found. The aircraft carrier , the battleship , the , the Japanese oceanographic survey vessel \"Koshu\" and the Japanese seaplane tender \"Kamoi\" searched for six–seven days each, covering .\n\nImmediately after the end of the official search, Putnam financed a private search by local authorities of nearby Pacific islands and waters, concentrating on the Gilberts. In late July 1937, Putnam chartered two small boats and while he remained in the United States, directed a search of the Phoenix Islands, Christmas (Kiritimati) Island, Fanning (Tabuaeran) Island, the Gilbert Islands and the Marshall Islands, but no trace of the Electra or its occupants was found.\n\nBack in the United States, Putnam acted to become the trustee of Earhart's estate so that he could pay for the searches and related bills. In probate court in Los Angeles, Putnam requested to have the \"declared death \"in absentia\"\" seven-year waiting period waived so that he could manage Earhart's finances. As a result, Earhart was declared legally dead on January 5, 1939.\n\nThere has been considerable speculation on what happened to Earhart and Noonan. Most historians hold to the simple \"crash and sink\" theory, but a number of other possibilities have been proposed, including several conspiracy theories.\n\nSome have suggested that Earhart and Noonan survived and landed elsewhere, but were either never found or killed, making en-route locations like Tarawa unlikely. Proposals have included the uninhabited Gardner Island ( from the vicinity of Howland), the Japanese-controlled Marshall Islands ( at the closest point of Mili Atoll), and the Japanese-controlled Northern Mariana Islands ( from Howland).\n\nMany researchers believe that Earhart and Noonan ran out of fuel while searching for Howland Island, ditched at sea, and perished. The plane would have carried enough fuel to reach Howland with some extra to spare. The extra fuel would cover some contingencies such as headwinds and searching for Howland. The plane could fly a compass course toward Howland through the night. In the morning, the time of apparent sunrise would allow the plane to determine its line of position (a sun line that ran 157°–337°). From that line, the plane could determine how much further it must travel before reaching a parallel sun line that ran through Howland. At 6:14 AM \"Itasca\" time, Earhart estimated they were 200 miles away from Howland. As the plane closed with Howland, it expected to be in radio contact with \"Itasca\". With the radio contact, the plane should be able to use radio direction finding (RDF) to head directly for the \"Itasca\" and Howland. Unfortunately, the plane was not receiving a radio signal from \"Itasca\", so it would be unable to determine an RDF bearing to the ship. Although \"Itasca\" was receiving HF radio signals from the plane, it did not have HF RDF equipment, so it could not determine a bearing to the plane. The communications going to the plane were almost non-existent. Consequently, the plane was not directed to Howland; it was left on its own with little fuel. Presumably, the plane reached the parallel sun line and started searching for Howland on that line of position. At 7:42 AM, Earhart reported, \"We must be on you, but cannot see you – but gas is running low. Have been unable to reach you by radio. We are flying at 1,000 feet.\" At 8:43 AM, Earhart reported, \"We are on the line 157 337. We will repeat this message. We will repeat this on 6210 kilocycles. Wait.\"\n\nNavigator and aeronautical engineer Elgen Long and his wife Marie K. Long devoted 35 years of research to the \"crash and sink\" theory. United States Navy Captain Laurance Safford (retired) who was responsible for the interwar Mid-Pacific Strategic Direction Finding Net, and the decoding of the Japanese Purple cipher messages for the attack on Pearl Harbor, began a lengthy analysis of the Earhart flight during the 1970s. His research included the intricate radio transmission documentation. Safford came to the conclusion, \"poor planning, worse execution\". Rear Admiral Richard R. Black, USN, who was in administrative charge of the Howland Island airstrip and was present in the radio room on the \"Itasca\", asserted in 1982 that \"the Electra went into the sea about 10 am, July 2, 1937 not far from Howland\". British aviation historian Roy Nesbit interpreted evidence in contemporary accounts and Putnam's correspondence and concluded Earhart's Electra was not fully fueled at Lae. William L. Polhemous, the navigator on Ann Pellegreno's 1967 flight that followed Earhart and Noonan's original flight path, studied navigational tables for July 2, 1937, and thought Noonan may have miscalculated the \"single line approach\" intended to \"hit\" Howland.\n\nDavid Jourdan, a former Navy submariner and ocean engineer specializing in deep-sea recoveries, has claimed any transmissions attributed to Gardner Island were false. Through his company Nauticos he extensively searched a quadrant north and west of Howland Island during two deep-sea sonar expeditions (2002 and 2006, total cost $4.5 million) and found nothing. The search locations were derived from the line of position (157–337) broadcast by Earhart on July 2, 1937. Nevertheless, Elgen Long's interpretations have led Jourdan to conclude, \"The analysis of all the data we have – the fuel analysis, the radio calls, other things – tells me she went into the water off Howland.\" Earhart's stepson George Palmer Putnam Jr. has been quoted as saying he believes \"the plane just ran out of gas\". Susan Butler, author of the Earhart biography \"East to the Dawn\", says she thinks the aircraft went into the ocean out of sight of Howland Island and rests on the seafloor at a depth of . Tom D. Crouch, Senior Curator of the National Air and Space Museum, has said the Earhart/Noonan Electra is \"18,000 ft. down\" and may even yield a range of artifacts that could rival the finds of the \"Titanic\", adding that \"the mystery is part of what keeps us interested. In part, we remember her because she's our favorite missing person.\"\n\nThe Gardner Island hypothesis assumes that Earhart and Noonan, having not found Howland Island, would not waste time searching for Howland. Instead, they would turn to the south and look for other islands. The 157/337 radio transmission suggests they flew a course of 157° that would take them past Baker Island; if they missed Baker Island, then sometime later they would fly over the Phoenix Islands, now part of the Republic of Kiribati, about south-southeast of Howland Island. The Gardner Island hypothesis has the plane making it to Gardner Island (now Nikumaroro), one of the Phoenix Islands.\n\nA week after Earhart disappeared, Navy planes from (which had sailed from Pearl Harbor) searched Gardner Island. The planes saw signs of recent habitation and the wreck of the , but did not see any signs of Earhart's plane or people. After the Navy ended its search, G. P. Putnam undertook a search in the Phoenix Group and other islands, but nothing was found.\n\nIn October 1937, Eric Bevington and Henry E. Maude visited Gardner with some potential settlers. A group walked all the way around the island, but did not find a plane or other evidence.\n\nIn December 1938, laborers landed on the island and started constructing the settlement.\n\nIn late 1939, did a survey of the island.\n\nAround April 1940, a skull was discovered and buried, but British colonial officer Gerald Gallagher, did not learn of it until September. Gallagher did a more thorough search of discovery area, including looking for artifacts such as rings. The search found more bones, a bottle, a shoe, and a sextant box. On September 23, 1940, Gallagher radioed his superiors that he had found a \"skeleton ... possibly that of a woman\", along with an old-fashioned sextant box, under a tree on the island's southeast corner. Gallagher stated the \"Bones look more than four years old to me but there seems to be very slight chance that this may be remains of Amelia Earhardt.\" He was ordered to send the remains to Fiji. On 4 April 1941, Dr. D. W. Hoodless of the Central Medical School examined the bones, took measurements, and wrote a report. Using Karl Pearson's formulas for stature and the lengths of the femur, tibia, and humerus, Hoodless concluded that the person was about tall. Hoodless also wrote \"it may be definitely stated that the skeleton is that of a MALE.\" [Emphasis in original.] Hoodless further stated, \"Owing to the weather-beaten condition of all the bones it is impossible to be dogmatic in regard to the age of the person at the time of death, but I am of the opinion that he was not less than 45 years of age and that probably he was older: say between 45 and 55 years.\" Hoodless offered to make more detailed measurements if needed, but suggested any further examination be done by the Anthropological Department at Sydney University. These bones were misplaced in Fiji long ago and cannot be reexamined.\n\nIn 1998, an analysis of the measurement data by forensic anthropologists found instead that the skeleton had belonged to a \"tall white female of northern European ancestry\". However, a 2015 review of both analyses concluded that \"the most robust scientific analysis and conclusions are those of the original British finding indicating that the Nikumaroro bones belonged to a robust, middle-aged man, not Amelia Earhart.\"\n\nA 2018 study by American anthropologist Richard Jantz (one of the authors of the 1998 TIGHAR report) estimated the size of Earhart's skeleton based on photographs and reanalyzed the earlier data using modern forensic techniques. Based on measurements of 2,700 Americans who died in the mid-20th century, the study concluded that Earhart's bone measurements more closely matched the Nikumaroro bones than 99% of the reference sample. However, others criticized the study for being based on little factual evidence (in particular seven measurements from the skeleton done in 1941, combined with estimates about Earhart's size based on photos) and doubted the accuracy of those measurements.\n\nDuring World War II, US Coast Guard LORAN Unit 92, a radio navigation station built in the summer and fall of 1944, and operational from mid-November 1944 until mid-May 1945, was located on Gardner Island's southeast end. Dozens of U.S. Coast Guard personnel were involved in its construction and operation, but were mostly forbidden from leaving the small base or having contact with the Gilbertese colonists then on the island, and found no artifacts known to relate to Earhart.\n\nIn 1988, The International Group for Historic Aircraft Recovery (TIGHAR) began an investigation of the Earhart/Noonan disappearance and since then has sent ten research expeditions to Gardner Island/Nikumaroro. They have suggested Earhart and Noonan may have flown without further radio transmissions for two and a half hours along the line of position Earhart noted in her last transmission received at Howland, then found the then-uninhabited Gardner Island, landed the Electra on an extensive reef flat near the wreck of a large freighter (the ) on the northwest side of the atoll, and ultimately perished. In 2012, a photograph taken in October 1937 of the reef at Nikumaroro after her disappearance was enhanced. According to the analysts who viewed it, \"a blurry object sticking out of the water in the lower left corner of the black-and-white photo is consistent with a strut and wheel of a Lockheed Electra landing gear\".\n\nTIGHAR's research has produced a range of archaeological and anecdotal evidence supporting this hypothesis. TIGHAR has sent a number of expeditions to Nikumaroro looking for evidence, although they have found nothing conclusive; expeditions include ones in 2007, 2010, 2012, and 2017. Artifacts discovered by TIGHAR on Nikumaroro have included improvised tools; an aluminum panel, possibly from an Electra, made using 1930s manufacturing specifications; an oddly cut piece of clear Plexiglas the same thickness and curvature of an Electra window; and a size 9 Cat's Paw heel dating from the 1930s, which resembles Earhart's footwear in world flight photos. Recently rediscovered photos of Earhart's Electra just before departure in Miami show an aluminum panel over a window on the right side. Ric Gillespie, head of TIGHAR, claimed the found aluminum panel artifact has the same dimensions and rivet pattern as the one shown in the photo \"to a high degree of certainty\". Based on this new evidence, Gillespie returned to the atoll in June 2015, but operations using a remotely operated underwater vehicle to investigate a sonar detection of a possible wreckage were hampered by technical problems. Further, a review of sonar data concluded it was most likely a coral ridge. The evidence remains circumstantial, but Earhart's surviving stepson, George Putnam Jr., has expressed support for TIGHAR's research.\n\nIn July 2017, staff from the New England Air Museum notified TIGHAR that the unique rivet pattern of the aluminum panel precisely matched the top of the wing of a C-47B in the museum inventory; particularly significant since a C-47B crashed on a nearby island during World War II and villagers acknowledged bringing aluminum from that wreck to Gardner Island. , TIGHAR has not published this new information.\n\nThe sextant box found near the bones on Nikumaroro and alleged to belong to Fred Noonan had two apparent serial numbers on it: 3500 and 1542. In October 2018, documents discovered at the National Archives and Records Administration showed had a Brandis and Sons sextant with USNO serial number 1542 in 1938-1939, well after Earhart's disappearance. The , a U.S. Navy submarine tender that was assigned to hydrographic surveys in December 1937, visited Nikumaroro and surveyed the island and its lagoon using sextants around November 1939, before the sextant box was discovered by Gallagher in September 1940. A Brandis and Sons sextant with serial number 3500 would have been made around the time of World War I.\n\nA few news articles have considered TIGHAR's theory, and generally consider it the most plausible of the \"Earhart survived\" theories, although not proven over crash-and-sink. Other news articles have criticized TIGHAR as seizing on unlikely possibilities as circumstantial evidence; for example, an article criticized the suggestion that a can of freckle ointment found on Nikumaroro might have been Earhart's, when the Electra was \"virtually a flying gas station\" with little room for amenities, as Earhart and Noonan carried extra gas tanks in every scrap of available space.\n\nAnother theory is that Earhart and Noonan were captured by Japanese forces, perhaps after somehow navigating to somewhere within the Japanese South Pacific Mandate.\n\nIn 1966, CBS Correspondent Fred Goerner published a book claiming that Earhart and Noonan were captured and executed when their aircraft crashed on the island of Saipan, part of the Northern Mariana Islands archipelago. Saipan is more than 2,700 miles away from Howland Island, however. Later proponents of the Japanese capture hypothesis have generally suggested the Marshall Islands instead, which while still distant from the intended location (~800 miles), is slightly more possible.\n\nIn 1990, the NBC-TV series \"Unsolved Mysteries\" broadcast an interview with a Saipanese woman who claimed to have witnessed Earhart and Noonan's execution by Japanese soldiers. No independent confirmation has ever emerged for any of these claims. Various purported photographs of Earhart during her captivity have been identified as either fraudulent or having been taken before her final flight.\n\nA slightly different version of the Japanese capture hypothesis is not that the Japanese captured Earhart, but rather that they shot down her plane. Henri Keyzer-Andre, a former Pan Am pilot, propounded this view in his 1993 book \"Age Of Heroes: Incredible Adventures of a Pan Am Pilot and his Greatest Triumph, Unravelling the Mystery of Amelia Earhart\".\n\nSince the end of World War II, a location on Tinian, which is five miles (8 km) southwest of Saipan, had been rumored to be the grave of the two aviators. In 2004, an archaeological dig at the site failed to turn up any bones.\n\nA recent proponent of this theory is Mike Campbell, who published the 2012 book \"Amelia Earhart: The Truth at Last\" in its favor. Campbell cites claims from Marshall Islanders to have witnessed a crash, as well as a U.S. Army Sergeant who found a suspicious gravesite near a former Japanese prison on Saipan.\n\nA number of Earhart's relatives have been convinced that the Japanese were somehow involved in Amelia's disappearance, citing unnamed witnesses including Japanese troops and Saipan natives. According to one cousin, the Japanese cut the Lockheed Electra into scrap and threw the pieces into the ocean, to explain why the airplane was not found in the Marshall Islands.\n\nIn 2017, a History Channel documentary, \"\", proposed that a photograph in the National Archives of Jaluit Atoll in the Marshall Islands was actually a picture of a captured Earhart and Noonan. The picture showed a Caucasian male on a dock who appeared to look like Noonan and a woman sitting on the dock but facing away from the camera, who was judged to have a physique and haircut resembling Earhart's. The documentary theorizes that the photo was taken after Earhart and Noonan crashed at Mili Atoll. The documentary also said that physical evidence recovered from Mili matches pieces that could have fallen off an Electra during a crash or subsequent overland move to a barge. \"The Lost Evidence\" proposed that a Japanese ship seen in the photograph was the \"Koshu Maru\", a Japanese military ship. \"The Lost Evidence\" was quickly discredited, however, after Japanese blogger Kota Yamano found the original source of the photograph in the Archives in the National Diet Library Digital Collection. The original source of the photo was a Japanese travel guide published in October 1935, implying that the photograph was taken in 1935 or before, and thus would be unrelated to Earhart and Noonan's 1937 disappearance. Additionally, the researcher who discovered the photo also identified the ship in the right of the photo as another ship called \"Koshu\" seized by Allied Japanese forces in World War I and not the \"Koshu Maru\".\n\nA common criticism of all versions of the Japanese capture hypothesis is that the Japanese-controlled Marshall Islands were considerably distant from Howland Island. To reach and land there would have required Earhart and Noonan, though low on fuel, to change her northeast course as she neared Howland Island and fly hundreds of miles northwest, a feat \"not supported by the basic rules of geography and navigation.\" Additionally, had the Japanese found a crashed Earhart and Noonan, they would have had substantial motivation to rescue the famous aviators and be hailed as heroes.\n\nThe unresolved circumstances of Earhart's disappearance, along with her fame, attracted a great body of other claims relating to her last flight. Several unsupported theories have become known in popular culture.\n\nThe World War II-era movie \"Flight for Freedom\" (1943) is a story of a fictional female aviator (obviously inspired by Earhart) who engages in a spying mission in the Pacific. The movie helped further a myth that Earhart was spying on the Japanese in the Pacific at the request of the Franklin D. Roosevelt administration. By 1949, both the United Press and U.S. Army Intelligence had concluded that this rumor was groundless. Jackie Cochran, another pioneering aviator and one of Earhart's friends, made a postwar search of numerous files in Japan and was convinced that the Japanese were not involved in Earhart's disappearance.\n\nA rumor that claimed that Earhart had made propaganda radio broadcasts as one of the many women compelled to serve as Tokyo Rose was investigated closely by George Putnam. According to several biographies of Earhart, Putnam investigated this rumor personally but after listening to many recordings of numerous Tokyo Roses, he did not recognize her voice among them.\n\nThe theory that Earhart may have turned back mid-flight has been posited. She would then have tried to reach the airfield at Rabaul, New Britain (northeast of mainland Papua New Guinea), approximately from Howland.\n\nIn 1990, Donald Angwin, a veteran of the Australian Army's World War II campaign in New Britain, contacted researchers to suggest that a wrecked aircraft he had witnessed in jungle about southwest of Rabaul, on April 17, 1945, may have been Earhart's Electra. Angwin, who was a corporal in the 11th Battalion at the time, reported that he and other members of a forward patrol on Japanese-occupied New Britain had found a wrecked twin-engined, unpainted all-metal aircraft. The soldiers recorded a rough position on a map, along with serial numbers seen on the wreckage. While the map was located in the possession of another veteran in 1993, subsequent searches of the area indicated failed to find a wreck.\n\nWhile Angwin died in 2001, David Billings, an Australian aircraft engineer, has continued to investigate his theory. Billings claims that the serial numbers written on the map, , represent:\nThese would be consistent with a Lockheed Electra 10E, such as that flown by Earhart, although they do not contain enough information to identify the wreck in question as NR16020.\n\nPacific Wrecks, a website that documents World War II-era aircraft crash sites, notes that no Electra has been reported lost in or around Papua New Guinea. Gillespie wrote that the distance from Earhart's last known position to New Britain was impossible for the aircraft to fly, requiring more than 13 hours of flight when there were only four hours of fuel remaining.\n\nIn November 2006, the National Geographic Channel aired episode two of the \"Undiscovered History\" series about a claim that Earhart survived the world flight, moved to New Jersey, changed her name, remarried and became Irene Craigmile Bolam. This claim had originally been raised in the book \"Amelia Earhart Lives\" (1970) by author Joe Klaas, based on the research of Major Joseph Gervais. Irene Bolam, who had been a banker in New York during the 1940s, denied being Earhart, filed a lawsuit requesting $1.5 million in damages and submitted a lengthy affidavit in which she rebutted the claims. The book's publisher, McGraw-Hill, withdrew the book from the market shortly after it was released and court records indicate that the company reached an out-of-court settlement with her. Subsequently, Bolam's personal life history was thoroughly documented by researchers, eliminating any possibility that she was Earhart. Kevin Richlin, a professional criminal forensic expert hired by \"National Geographic\", studied photographs of both women and cited many measurable facial differences between Earhart and Bolam.\n\nEarhart was a widely known international celebrity during her lifetime. Her shyly charismatic appeal, independence, persistence, coolness under pressure, courage and goal-oriented career along with the circumstances of her disappearance at a comparatively early age have driven her lasting fame in popular culture. Hundreds of articles and scores of books have been written about her life, which is often cited as a motivational tale, especially for girls. Earhart is generally regarded as a feminist icon.\n\nEarhart's accomplishments in aviation inspired a generation of female aviators, including the more than 1,000 women pilots of the Women Airforce Service Pilots (WASP) who ferried military aircraft, towed gliders, flew target practice aircraft, and served as transport pilots during World War II.\n\nThe home where Earhart was born is now the Amelia Earhart Birthplace Museum and is maintained by The Ninety-Nines, an international group of female pilots of whom Earhart was the first elected president.\n\nA small section of Earhart's Lockheed Electra starboard engine nacelle recovered in the aftermath of the Hawaii crash has been confirmed as authentic and is now regarded as a control piece that will help to authenticate possible future discoveries. The evaluation of the scrap of metal was featured on an episode of \"History Detectives\" on Season 7 in 2009.\n\nTwo notable memorial flights by female aviators subsequently followed Earhart's original circumnavigational route.\n\nIn 2001, another commemorative flight retraced the route undertaken by Earhart in her August 1928 transcontinental record flight. Dr. Carlene Mendieta flew an original Avro Avian, the same type that was used in 1928.\n\nIn 2013, Amelia Rose Earhart, a pilot and a reporter from Denver, Colorado, announced that she would be recreating the 1937 flight in the middle of 2014 in a single engine Pilatus PC-12NG. She completed the flight without incident on July 11, 2014.\n\nIn June and July 2017, Brian Lloyd flew his Mooney M20K 231 around the world to commemorate Earhart's attempted circumnavigation 80 years earlier. Lloyd followed a route similar to the one taken by Earhart.\n\nCountless other tributes and memorials have been made in Amelia Earhart's name, including a 2012 tribute by U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, speaking at a State Department event celebrating the ties of Earhart and the United States to its Pacific neighbors, noting: \"Earhart ... created a legacy that resonates today for anyone, girls and boys, who dreams of the stars.\" In 2013, \"Flying\" magazine ranked Earhart No. 9 on its list of the \"51 Heroes of Aviation\". The following list is not considered definitive, but serves also to give significant examples of tributes and honors.\n\n\n\nEarhart's life has spurred the imaginations of many writers and others; the following examples are given although many other mentions have also occurred in contemporary or current media:\n\n\n\n\n\nEarhart was a successful and heavily promoted writer who served as aviation editor for \"Cosmopolitan\" magazine from 1928 to 1930. She wrote magazine articles, newspaper columns, essays and published two books based upon her experiences as a flyer during her lifetime:\n\n\n"}

These critics argued that there are aspects of human consciousness or expertise that can not be simulated by machines. One reply to their arguments is that the biological processes inside the brain can be simulated to any degree of accuracy. This reply was made as early as 1950, by Alan Turing in his classic paper \"Computing Machinery and Intelligence\".\n\nThe third objective is generally called artificial general intelligence by researchers. However, Ray Kurzweil prefers the term \"strong AI\". In his book \"The Singularity is Near\", he focuses on whole brain emulation using conventional computing machines as an approach to implementing artificial brains, and claims (on grounds of computer power continuing an exponential growth trend) that this could be done by 2025. Henry Markram, director of the Blue Brain project (which is attempting brain emulation), made a similar claim (2020) at the Oxford TED conference in 2009.\n\n Although direct human brain emulation using artificial neural networks on a high-performance computing engine is a commonly discussed approach, there are other approaches. An alternative artificial brain implementation could be based on Holographic Neural Technology (HNeT) non linear phase coherence/decoherence principles. The analogy has been made to quantum processes through the core synaptic algorithm which has strong similarities to the quantum mechanical wave equation.\n\nEvBrain is a form of evolutionary software that can evolve \"brainlike\" neural networks, such as the network immediately behind the retina.\n\nIn November 2008, IBM received a US$4.9 million grant from the Pentagon for research into creating intelligent computers. The Blue Brain project is being conducted with the assistance of IBM in Lausanne. The project is based on the premise that it is possible to artificially link the neurons \"in the computer\" by placing thirty million synapses in their proper three-dimensional position.\n\nSome proponents of strong AI speculated that computers in connection with Blue Brain and Soul Catcher may exceed human intellectual capacity by around 2015, and that it is likely that we will be able to download the human brain at some time around 2050.\n\nWhile \"Blue Brain\" is able to represent complex neural connections on the large scale, the project does not achieve the link between brain activity and behaviors executed by the brain. In 2012, project Spaun (Semantic Pointer Architecture Unified Network) attempted to model multiple parts of the human brain through large-scale representations of neural connections that generate complex behaviors in addition to mapping.\n\nSpaun's design recreates elements of human brain anatomy. The model, consisting of approximately 2.5 million neurons, includes features of the visual and motor cortices, GABAergic and dopaminergic connections, the ventral tegmental area (VTA), substantia nigra, and others. The design allows for several functions in response to eight tasks, using visual inputs of typed or handwritten characters and outputs carried out by a mechanical arm. Spaun's functions include copying a drawing, recognizing images, and counting.\n\nThere are good reasons to believe that, regardless of implementation strategy, the predictions of realising artificial brains in the near future are optimistic. In particular brains (including the human brain) and cognition are not currently well understood, and the scale of computation required is unknown. Another near term limitation is that all current approaches for brain simulation require orders of magnitude larger power consumption compared with a human brain. The human brain consumes about 20 W of power whereas current supercomputers may use as much as 1 MW or an order of 100,000 more.\n\nSome critics of brain simulation believe that it is simpler to create general intelligent action directly without imitating nature. Some commentators have used the analogy that early attempts to construct flying machines modeled them after birds, but that modern aircraft do not look like birds.\n\n"}
{"id": "33418313", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=33418313", "title": "Cellular evolutionary algorithm", "text": "Cellular evolutionary algorithm\n\nA cellular evolutionary algorithm (cEA) is a kind of evolutionary algorithm (EA) in which individuals cannot mate arbitrarily, but every one interacts with its closer neighbors on which a basic EA is applied (selection, variation, replacement).\n\nThe cellular model simulates natural evolution from the point of view of\nthe individual, which encodes a tentative (optimization, learning, search) problem solution. The essential idea of this model is to provide the EA population\nwith a special structure defined as a connected graph, in which each vertex is an individual who communicates with his\nnearest neighbors. Particularly, individuals are conceptually set in a toroidal\nmesh, and are only allowed to recombine with close individuals. This leads us\nto a kind of locality known as \"isolation by distance\". The set of potential mates\nof an individual is called its \"neighborhood\". It is known that, in this kind\nof algorithm, similar individuals tend to cluster creating niches, and these groups\noperate as if they were separate sub-populations (islands). Anyway, there is no\nclear borderline between adjacent groups, and close niches could be easily\ncolonized by competitive niches and maybe merge solution contents during the process. Simultaneously,\nfarther niches can be affected more slowly.\n\nA cellular evolutionary algorithm (cEA) usually evolves a structured bidimensional\ngrid of individuals, although other topologies are also possible. In this grid, clusters of similar individuals are naturally created during evolution, promoting exploration in their boundaries, while exploitation is mainly performed by direct competition and merging inside them.\n\nThe grid is usually 2D toroidal structure, although\nthe number of dimensions can be easily extended (to 3D) or reduced (to 1D, e.g. a ring).\nThe neighborhood of a particular point of the grid (where an individual is\nplaced) is defined in terms of the \"Manhattan\" distance from it to others in the population. Each point of the grid has a neighborhood that overlaps the neighborhoods of nearby individuals. In the basic algorithm, all the neighborhoods have the same size and identical shapes. The two\nmost commonly used neighborhoods are L5, also called\n\"Von Neumann\" or NEWS (North, East, West and South), and C9, also known as \"Moore\" neighborhood. Here, \"L\" stands for \"Linear\" while \"C\" stands for \"Compact\".\n\nIn cEAs, the individuals can only interact with their neighbors in the reproductive\ncycle where the variation operators are applied. This reproductive\ncycle is executed inside the neighborhood of each individual and, generally,\nconsists in selecting two parents among its neighbors according to a certain\ncriterion, applying the variation operators to them (recombination and mutation\nfor example), and replacing the considered individual by the recently\ncreated offspring following a given criterion, for instance, replace if the offspring\nrepresents a better solution than the considered individual.\n\nIn a regular synchronous cEA, the algorithm proceeds from the very first top left individual to the right and then to the several rows by using the information in the population to create a new temporary population. After finishing with the bottom-right last individual the temporary population is full with the newly computed individuals, and the replacement step starts. In it, the old population is completely and synchronously replaced with the newly computed one according to some criterion. Usually, the replacement keeps the best individual in the same position of both populations, that is, elitism is used.\n\nWe must notice that according to the update policy of the population used, we could also define an asynchronous cEA. This is also a well-known issue in cellular automata. In asynchronous cEAs the order in which the individuals in the grid are update changes depending on the criterion used: line sweep, fixed random sweep, new random sweep, and uniform choice. These are the four most usual ways of updating the population. All of them keep using the newly computed individual (or the original if better) for the computations of its neighbors immediately. This makes the population to hold at any time individual in different states of evolution, defining a very interesting new line of research.\n\nThe overlap of the neighborhoods provides an implicit mechanism of solution migration\nto the cEA. Since the best solutions spread smoothly through the\nwhole population, genetic diversity in the population is preserved longer than\nin non structured EAs. This soft dispersion of the best solutions through the\npopulation is one of the main issues of the good tradeoff between \"exploration\"\nand \"exploitation\" that cEAs perform during the search. It is then easy to see\nthat we could \"tune this tradeoff\" (and hence, tune the genetic diversity level along\nthe evolution) by modifying (for instance) the size of the neighborhood used, as\nthe overlap degree between the neighborhoods grows according to the size of\nthe neighborhood.\n\nA cEA can be seen as a cellular automaton (CA) with probabilistic\nrewritable rules, where the alphabet of the CA is equivalent to the potential\nnumber of solutions of the problem. Hence, if we see cEAs as a kind of CA,\nit is possible to import knowledge from the field of CAs to cEAs, and in fact this is an interesting open research line.\n\nCellular EAs are very amenable to parallelism, thus usually found in the literature of parallel metaheuristics. In particular, fine grain parallelism can be use to assign independent threads of execution to every individual, thus allowing the whole cEA to run on a concurrent or actually parallel hardware platform. In this way, large time reductions can be obtained when running cEAs on FPGAs or GPUs.\n\nHowever, it is important to stress that cEAs are a model of search, in many senses different from traditional EAs. Also, they can be run in sequential and parallel platforms, reinforcing the fact that the model and the implementation are two different concepts.\n\nSee here for a complete description on the fundamentals for the understanding, design, and application of cEAs.\n\n\n\n"}

Afflis played football during his freshman and sophomore years for Shortridge High School in Indianapolis. After his mother lost her job, the family moved back to Delphi, and the high school there did not have a football team. Afflis took up residence at the YMCA in nearby Lafayette, Indiana, so that he was eligible to attend Lafayette Jefferson High School where he played football and wrestled.\n\nAfflis went on to attend Purdue University and the University of Nevada, Reno, playing varsity football at both schools. He also worked as a bouncer at a Reno nightclub.\n\nSelected 186th overall in the 16th round of the 1951 professional football draft, Afflis played football for the Green Bay Packers from 1951 to 1954. as a lineman. He appeared in all 48 regular season games the Packers played in those years, although the team never finished better than fourth place. Afflis suffered an injury to his larynx while playing for the Packers that left him with a gravelly voice for the rest of his life.\n\nAfflis started wrestling in Chicago in 1955 under the Bruiser moniker where he faced Verne Gagne and Lou Thesz. Gagne had trained him to become a professional wrestler.\n\nFrom then into the late 1950s, Dick the Bruiser wrestled live every Thursday on TV in the Detroit area. His typical opponent was \"an up and coming young (unknown) wrestler\" who would be pulverized by the Bruiser. His matches and interviews were so effective he became a household name in the Detroit area. His only defeat on live TV was at the hands of Cowboy Bob Ellis. However, in two rematches with Ellis at the Olympia in Detroit, the Bruiser was victorious. A real bar fight with football player Alex Karras gained Afflis attention, which resulted in several more fights.\n\nOn November 19, 1957, Dick the Bruiser and Dr. Jerry Graham engaged in a tag team match at Madison Square Garden in New York City before a crowd reported as 12,987 fans. Their opponents were Antonino Rocca and Édouard Carpentier. After the match ended, fighting among the wrestlers continued, and a large number of fans joined in, leading to a riot. Two policemen were injured, two fans were arrested and over 60 policemen had difficulty dispersing the angry crowd. The floor of the arena was littered with hundreds of broken chairs As a result, Dick the Bruiser was banned for life by the New York State Athletic Commission.\nAfflis, along with fellow wrestler and business partner Wilbur Snyder, purchased the Indianapolis NWA promotion in 1964 from its longtime owner Jim Barnett. Afflis renamed the territory the World Wrestling Association (WWA) and promoted himself as its champion. While he ran it as an independent promotion with its own titles and champion, the WWA had a working agreement with the larger AWA (owned by wrestler Verne Gagne), sharing talent and recognizing their championships. This agreement benefited both promotions and led to the Bruiser having five AWA Tag-Team Title reigns, with tag team partner, The Crusher, who was billed as his \"cousin\".\n\nThe Bruiser was the first to christen Manager Bobby Heenan with the nickname of \"The Weasel\" during his run in the territory. Afflis' WWA ran from 1964 until 1989, when Afflis finally tired of losing talent, TV, and fan attendance to the World Wrestling Federation (WWF).\n\nAfflis, with his charisma, NFL notoriety, and gravelly-voiced, tough-guy persona was a legitimate cross-media star, becoming something of a hero in the Indianapolis area. He made his home on the northwest side of the city. Indianapolis native David Letterman would later name his television show's band The World's Most Dangerous Band as a derivation of Dick the Bruiser's nickname, \"The World's Most Dangerous Wrestler.\" The moniker \"Dick the Bruiser\" was even used in the 1980s by George Baier, a co-host of the morning drive show on Detroit rock radio station WRIF. Baier's \"Richard T. Bruiser\" was an effective, entertaining impersonation of Afflis, who actually played himself in a number of popular TV ads for WRIF.\n\nAfter retiring, Afflis was a color commentator for the Gorgeous Ladies of Wrestling (GLOW), founded by David McLane, who had previously risen through the ranks as a teenager to manage the WWA for The Bruiser. He also worked as a talent agent for World Championship Wrestling (WCW), and was the special guest referee at the Starrcade 1990 main event between Sting and the Black Scorpion.\n\nAfflis died of internal bleeding on November 10, 1991, according to a spokesman for Suncoast Hospital in Largo, Florida, near his winter home. His widow, Louise, said her husband had been weightlifting at home with his adopted son, Jon Carney, and ruptured a blood vessel in his esophagus. He was entombed at Washington Park North Cemetery in Indianapolis.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "4088899", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4088899", "title": "Epitoky", "text": "Epitoky\n\nEpitoky is a process that occurs in many species of polychaete marine worms wherein a sexually immature worm (the atoke) is modified or transformed into a sexually mature worm (the epitoke). Epitokes are pelagic morphs capable of sexual reproduction. Unlike the immature form, which is typically benthic (lives on the bottom), epitokes are specialized for swimming as well as reproducing. The primary benefit to epitoky is increased chances of finding other members of the same species for reproduction.\n\nThere are two methods in which epitoky can occur: schizogamy and epigamy.\n\nMany species go through schizogamy, where the atoke uses asexual reproduction to produce buds from its posterior end. Each bud develops into an epitoke and, once fully formed, will then break off from the atoke and become free-swimming. Many genetically identical epitokes are formed in this way, thus allowing a higher chance of finding a mate of the same species and subsequent passing of genes to the next generation. Atokes may then live through another season to form more epitokes.\n\nEpigamy is another common way to form epitokes. For species that use this method, the atoke undergoes physiological and morphological modifications as it transforms into the epitoke. Typically, male worms undergo a more pronounced transformation from atoke to epitoke. Modifications may include an increase in size of parapodia and the development of paddle-like chaetae for enhanced swimming ability, atrophy of the gut, filling of the body cavity with gametes (eggs or sperm), the development of large eyes, and the musculature may even change to perform swimming movements instead of feeding movements. The majority of species that undergo epigamy are unable to revert to the atoke form and die after reproducing.\n\nMale and female epitokes are produced and swim to the water's surface only at certain times of the year and are often synchronized with moon cycles in a behavior called swarming. Swarming brings individuals of the same species together so that there is an increased rate of fertilization. Some polychaete species have been found to use bioluminescence, presumably to compact and maintain swarms. Both schizogamous and epigamous epitokes are non-feeding individuals that die once gametes have been released into the water.\n\nIn the past, epitokes were thought to be a separate group of polychaete marine worms, because epitokes may look very different than atokes. For instance, the atokes of Platynereis dumerilii are yellowish-brown, while the female epitokes are yellow because of the eggs they contain, and the male epitokes are white in the front part due to sperm and red in the hind part due to blood vessels (see pictures).\n"}
{"id": "480672", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=480672", "title": "Essence", "text": "Essence\n\nIn philosophy, essence is the property or set of properties that make an entity or substance what it fundamentally is, and which it has by necessity, and without which it loses its identity. Essence is contrasted with accident: a property that the entity or substance has contingently, without which the substance can still retain its identity. The concept originates rigorously with Aristotle (although it can also be found in Plato), who used the Greek expression \"to ti ên einai\" (τὸ τί ἦν εἶναι, literally meaning \"the what it was to be\" and corresponding to the scholastic term quiddity) or sometimes the shorter phrase \"to ti esti\" (τὸ τί ἐστι, literally meaning \"the what it is\" and corresponding to the scholastic term haecceity) for the same idea. This phrase presented such difficulties for its Latin translators that they coined the word \"essentia\" (English \"essence\") to represent the whole expression. For Aristotle and his scholastic followers, the notion of essence is closely linked to that of definition (ὁρισμός \"horismos\").\n\nIn the history of western thought, essence has often served as a vehicle for doctrines that tend to individuate different forms of existence as well as different identity conditions for objects and properties; in this logical meaning, the concept has given a strong theoretical and common-sense basis to the whole family of logical theories based on the \"possible worlds\" analogy set up by Leibniz and developed in the intensional logic from Carnap to Kripke, which was later challenged by \"extensionalist\" philosophers such as Quine.\n\nIn his dialogues Plato suggests that concrete beings acquire their essence through their relations to \"Forms\"abstract universals logically or ontologically separate from the objects of sense perception. These Forms are often put forth as the models or paradigms of which sensible things are \"copies\". When used in this sense, the word form is often capitalized. Sensible bodies are in constant flux and imperfect and hence, by Plato's reckoning, less real than the Forms which are eternal, unchanging and complete. Typical examples of Forms given by Plato are largeness, smallness, equality, unity, goodness, beauty and justice.\n\nAristotle moves the Forms of Plato to the nucleus of the individual thing, which is called \"ousia\" or substance. Essence is the \"ti\" of the thing, the \"to ti en einai\". Essence corresponds to the \"ousia\"'s definition; essence is a real and physical aspect of the \"ousia\" (Aristotle, \"Metaphysics\", I).\n\nAccording to nominalists (Roscelin of Compiègne, William of Ockham, Bernard of Chartres), universals aren't concrete entities, just voice's sounds; there are only individuals: \"nam cum habeat eorum sententia nihil esse praeter individuum [...]\" (Roscelin, \"De gener. et spec.\", 524). Universals are words that can to call several individuals; for example the word \"homo\". Therefore, a universal is reduced to a sound's emission (Roscelin, \"De generibus et speciebus\").\n\nJohn Locke distinguished between \"real essences\" and \"nominal essences\". Real essences are the thing(s) that makes a thing a thing, whereas nominal essences are our conception of what makes a thing a thing.\n\nAccording to Edmund Husserl essence is \"ideal\". However, \"ideal\" means that essence is an intentional object of consciousness. Essence is interpreted as \"sense\" (E. Husserl, \"Ideas pertaining to a pure phenomenology and to a phenomenological philosophy\", paragraphs 3 and 4).\n\nExistentialism was coined by Jean-Paul Sartre's endorsement of Martin Heidegger's statement that for human beings \"existence precedes essence.\" In as much as \"essence\" is a cornerstone of all metaphysical philosophy and of Rationalism, Sartre's statement was a repudiation of the philosophical system that had come before him (and, in particular, that of Husserl, Hegel, and Heidegger). Instead of \"is-ness\" generating \"actuality,\" he argued that existence and actuality come first, and the essence is derived afterward. For Kierkegaard, it is the individual person who is the supreme moral entity, and the personal, subjective aspects of human life that are the most important; also, for Kierkegaard all of this had religious implications.\n\n\"Essence,\" in metaphysics, is often synonymous with the soul, and some existentialists argue that individuals gain their souls and spirits after they exist, that they develop their souls and spirits during their lifetimes. For Kierkegaard, however, the emphasis was upon essence as \"nature.\" For him, there is no such thing as \"human nature\" that determines how a human will behave or what a human will be. First, he or she exists, and then comes property. Jean-Paul Sartre's more materialist and skeptical existentialism furthered this existentialist tenet by flatly refuting any metaphysical essence, any soul, and arguing instead that there is merely existence, with attributes as essence.\n\nThus, in existentialist discourse, essence can refer to physical aspect or property to the ongoing being of a person (the character or internally determined goals), or to the infinite inbound within the human (which can be lost, can atrophy, or can be developed into an equal part with the finite), depending upon the type of existentialist discourse.\n\nKarl Marx was a follower of Hegel's thought, and he, too, developed a philosophy in reaction to his master. In his early work, Marx used Aristotelian style teleology and derived a concept of humanity's essential nature. Marx's Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts of 1844 describe a theory of alienation based on human existence being completely different from human essence. Marx said human nature was social, and that humanity had the distinct essence of free activity and conscious thought.\n\nSome scholars, such as Philip Kain, have argued that Marx abandoned the idea of a human essence, but many other scholars point to Marx's continued discussion of these ideas despite the decline of terms such as essence and alienation in his later work.\n\nWithin the Madhyamaka school of Mahayana Buddhism, Candrakirti identifies the self as:\n\nBuddhapālita adds, while commenting on Nagārjuna's Mūlamadhyamakakārikā, \n\nFor the Madhyamaka Buddhists, 'Emptiness' (also known as Anatta or Anatman) is the strong assertion that all phenomena are empty of any essence, and that anti-essentialism lies at the root of Buddhist praxis and it is the innate belief in essence that is considered to be an afflictive obscuration which serves as the root of all suffering. However, the Madhyamaka also rejects the tenets of Idealism, Materialism or Nihilism; instead, the ideas of \"truth\" or \"existence\", along with any assertions that depend upon them are limited to their function within the contexts and conventions that assert them, possibly somewhat akin to Relativism or Pragmatism. For the Madhyamaka, replacement paradoxes such as Ship of Theseus are answered by stating that the Ship of Theseus remains so (within the conventions that assert it) until it ceases to function as the Ship of Theseus.\n\nIn Nagarjuna's Mulamadhyamakakarika Chapter XV examines essence itself.\n\nIn understanding any individual personality, a distinction is made between one's \"Swadharma\" (essence) and \"Swabhava\" (mental habits and conditionings of ego personality). Svabhava is the nature of a person, which is a result of his or her samskaras (impressions created in the mind due to one's interaction with the external world). These samskaras create habits and mental models and those become our nature. While there is another kind of svabhava that is a pure internal quality — smarana — we are here focusing only on the svabhava that was created due to samskaras (because to discover the pure, internal svabhava and smarana, one should become aware of one's samskaras and take control over them). Dharma is derived from the root \"dhr\" \"to hold.\" It is that which holds an entity together. That is, Dharma is that which gives integrity to an entity and holds the core quality and identity (essence), form and function of that entity. Dharma is also defined as righteousness and duty. To do one's dharma is to be righteous, to do one's dharma is to do one's duty (express one's essence).\n\n\n"}

F1 hybrids are used in genetics, and in selective breeding, where it may appear as F1 crossbreed.\nThe term is sometimes written with a subscript, as F hybrid.\nSubsequent generations are called F, F, etc.\n\nThe offspring of distinctly different parental types produce a new, uniform phenotype with a combination of characteristics from the parents. In fish breeding, those parents frequently are two closely related fish species, while in plant and animal breeding the parents often are two inbred lines. Mules are F1 hybrids between horse and donkey. Today, certain domestic–wild hybrid breeds, such as the Bengal cat and the Savannah cat, are classified by their filial generation number.\n\nGregor Mendel focused on patterns of inheritance and the genetic basis for variation. In his cross-pollination experiments involving two true-breeding, or homozygous, parents, Mendel found that the resulting F1 generation were heterozygous and consistent. The offspring showed a combination of the phenotypes from each parent that were genetically dominant. Mendel’s discoveries involving the F1 and F2 generations laid the foundation for modern genetics.\n\nCrossing two genetically different plants produces a hybrid seed. This can happen naturally, and includes hybrids between species (for example, peppermint is a sterile F1 hybrid of watermint and spearmint). In agronomy, the term “F1 hybrid” is usually reserved for agricultural cultivars derived from two parent cultivars. These F1 hybrids are usually created by means of controlled pollination, sometimes by hand-pollination. For annual plants such as tomato and maize, F1 hybrids must be produced each season.\n\nFor mass-production of F1 hybrids with uniform phenotype, the parent plants must have predictable genetic effects on the offspring. Inbreeding and selection for uniformity for multiple generations ensures that the parent lines are almost homozygous. The divergence between the (two) parent lines promotes improved growth and yield characteristics in offspring through the phenomenon of heterosis (\"hybrid vigour\" or \"combining ability\").\n\nTwo populations of breeding stock with desired characteristics are subjected to inbreeding until the homozygosity of the population exceeds a certain level, usually 90% or more. Typically this requires more than ten generations. Thereafter the two strains must be crossed, while avoiding self-fertilization. Normally this is done with plants by deactivating or removing male flowers from one population, taking advantage of time differences between male and female flowering or hand-pollinating.\n\nIn 1960, 99 percent of all corn planted in the United States, 95 percent of sugar beet, 80 percent of spinach, 80 percent of sunflower, 62 percent of broccoli and 60 percent of onions were F1 hybrids. Beans and peas are not commercially hybridized because they are automatic pollinators, and hand-pollination is prohibitively expensive.\n\nF2 hybrids, the result of self or cross pollination of F1s, lack the consistency of F1s, though they may retain some desirable traits and can be produced more cheaply, because hand pollination or other interventions are not required. Some seed companies offer F2 seed at less cost, particularly in bedding plants where consistency is less critical.\n\nF1 crosses in animals can be between two inbred lines or between two closely related species or subspecies. In such fish as cichlids, the term F1 cross is used for crosses between two different wild-caught individuals that are assumed to be from different genetic lines.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1697936", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1697936", "title": "Fantomex", "text": "Fantomex\n\nFantomex is a fictional superhero appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The character is commonly associated with the X-Men titles. Fantomex first appeared in \"\" #128 (August, 2002) and was created by Grant Morrison and Igor Kordey. Initially introduced as a character similar to Fantômas and Diabolik, he is later revealed to be an escaped experiment from the Weapon Plus Program.\n\nFantomex resembles the titular character of the Italian comic book \"Diabolik\" and its film adaptation \"\". The character of Diabolik is loosely based on the character Fantômas, the subject of a series of early-20th century French detective thrillers and a popular Mexican comic book adaptation, whose name is more directly reflected in Fantomex's own name. Fantomex's name, Jean-Phillipe, is a reference to actor John Phillip Law, star of \"Danger: Diabolik\". In addition, his Weapon X designation—\"Weapon XIII\"—is a reference to the secret agent protagonist of the Franco-Belgian comic \"XIII\".\n\nAfter Morrison's run, the character made sporadic appearances in \"Weapon X\" #23–25, \"Mystique\" #20–21, 24, the \"Dark Reign: The List—Wolverine\" one-shot and in \"Uncanny X-Men\" #515–522 during the \"Nation X\" storyline before becoming a founding member of a new covert X-Force as seen in the monthly \"Uncanny X-Force\" series.\n\nIn July 2013, Marvel announced the character's first solo series, \"Fantomex MAX\", written by Andrew Hope, and illustrated by Shawn Crystal. The series does not take place in current Marvel continuity, and the character is not affiliated with any other Marvel characters. In this series, the character of Fantomex is a more literal take on the Diabolik character, with a storyline less influenced by traditional superhero plots, skewing more towards the concepts of intrigue and James Bond-tinged adventure. Issue #1 debuted on October 2, 2013.\n\nFantomex was created by the Weapon Plus Program to serve as a super-sentinel against Earth's mutant population. Weapon Plus created a population of technorganic organisms whose living tissue was fused with Sentinel nanotechnology at the cellular level. His mother, a member of this race, became pregnant when she was fertilized with nanomachines, resulting in the birth of Fantomex. Like the rest of his people, he was born and raised in the World, a man-made environment designed to create super-sentinels, media-friendly mutant-hunters modeled after Saturday morning cartoons. Although his nationality is technically British as the World was located in England, Fantomex claims he was raised in a virtual France with imperfect programming. He's developed a French sense of identity and persona; whereas his experiment designation at the World facility was \"Charlie Cluster-7\", he usually goes by the name \"Jean-Phillipe\".\n\nDuring his first appearance, Fantomex seeks a safe haven at the X-Corporation in Paris while fleeing from authorities. He claims to be a mutant thief with the ill-defined power of misdirection. Bleeding profusely from bullet wounds, he asks for asylum, which Professor X grants him. Fantomex explains to Professor X and Jean Grey that he is being hunted because he is one of the most wanted thieves in Europe. Neither Professor X nor Jean Grey are able to verify his claims due to his ceramic mask, a device that blocks their mental probes. However, they agree to aid him, and after escaping the soldiers who surround the building, Fantomex uses his ship E.V.A. (named, in yet another reference, after Diabolik's lover Eva Kant) to take Professor X and Jean Grey to his home in France. While there, he introduces them to his mother and continues to describe his success as a thief. In fact, he tells the two that he has stolen sensitive information about the Weapon Plus project while in the Channel Tunnel, and offers to sell it to Professor Xavier for $1 billion. After submitting his proposal, he puts himself in a light hypnotic trance and removes the bullets that riddle his body. Finished, he asks Professor X and Jean Grey to accompany him back to the Chunnel in an effort to destroy Weapon XII. The three speed away in E.V.A., leaving the house and elderly woman behind.\n\nFantomex then leads Professor Xavier and Jean Grey to the Chunnel disaster. Packed full of people and animals that Weapon XII has turned into mindless slaves, confusion runs rampant. Knowing that those who have fallen prey to Weapon XII's influence are lost, Fantomex kills Darkstar and all others who are mentally connected to the creature. After Fantomex destroys Weapon XII by using a remote detonator, it is noticed that there are two empty Weapon Plus transport tubes in the Chunnel: one that held the violent Weapon XII and another that held something called Weapon XIII. After the battle, Fantomex's ceramic mask slips a bit and Jean Grey uses her telepathy to deduce his true identity: Fantomex is actually Weapon XIII and had also been in transit in the Chunnel. It was during the accident in the Chunnel that he escaped and was subsequently chased to the X-Corporation building. He confesses to Jean Grey that he is not the master thief that he had claimed, but is now set out to earn that reputation. He assures Jean Grey that he refuses to be anyone's soldier, and as a result Jean Grey allows Fantomex to disappear into the Chunnel before the authorities arrive.\n\nFantomex later travels to Afghanistan in an attempt to steal a list of the world's richest mutant slaver traders, the names on which he intends to blackmail. There he encounters an unconscious mutant known as Dust, a former captive who unwittingly killed her captors by turning into a deadly sandstorm. Upon his exit, he encounters Wolverine, leaving Dust in his care.\n\nSoon after, Fantomex contacts Wolverine and offers him information about his mysterious past if he helps Fantomex destroy Ultimaton, also known as Weapon XV, the last creation of the Weapon Plus Program. Fantomex, Wolverine, and the X-Men's Cyclops travel to the World, an artificial, time-altering environment designed by Weapon Plus to quickly develop and evolve new generations of super-soldiers.\n\nThe three are defeated by Weapon XV (Ultimaton), who escapes by breaking through the barriers of the World and flying to the Weapon Plus space station. The team pursues their target in E.V.A., Fantomex's biological spacecraft. Upon arriving at the space station Fantomex keeps his word by showing Wolverine the complete Weapon Plus database. Shocked at learning the terrible details of his past (including his role in the slaughter of the entire population of Roanoke while under the influence of Weapon X), Wolverine initiates the self-destruct sequence for the space station before catching and apparently killing Ultimaton (who reappears later as a subordinate). Fantomex and Cyclops escape the explosion in one of the station's shuttles.\n\nBack on Earth, Fantomex joins Cyclops and a group of X-Men students in their fight against Magneto, who had taken the identity of Xorn. He had gathered a new Brotherhood of Mutants and had taken over New York City. With the aid of Beak, Fantomex, and the others were able to break into Xorn's skyscraper headquarters and bring him down.\n\nLater on, Fantomex tries to track down John Sublime, the director of the Weapon Plus program. However, upon examining his empty grave, Fantomex finds a note reading, \"Roanoke.\" He locates the secret facility of the splinter program Weapon X and finds it abandoned except for Agent Zero. The pair reluctantly joins forces and travels to the site of Roanoke, a town whose inhabitants were slaughtered after Weapon X unleashed a brainwashed Wolverine on them years earlier. There, the three finally encounter Sublime but are opposed by his U-Men and forced to flee against overwhelming odds. In an attempt to escape in E.V.A., Fantomex is shot down and left for dead.\n\nHowever, Fantomex manages to survive and some time later is contacted by the diminutive mutant Shortpack who seeks his help in assassinating mutant arms dealer Steinbeck, also known as the Quiet Man, in revenge for his killing of an agent under Shortpack's care. Fantomex refuses, not wanting to become responsible for allowing the good-natured Shortpack to become a killer. Shortpack is captured by Steinbeck soon after, and whilst investigating his disappearance the shapechanging mutant Mystique, a double agent for both Xavier and Steinbeck's ally Shepard, learns of his meeting with Fantomex. Though despising him after a past encounter in Madagascar, Mystique finds Fantomex in Monte Carlo, once again operating under the pretense of being a mutant thief, and learns of Shortpack's plan. As she leaves to rescue him, Fantomex follows and uncovers her intent to assassinate Xavier. In exchange for his silence, Fantomex bids Mystique perform a heist for him. After she returns with the stolen goods (a vintage Spider-Man costume), Mystique infects both Fantomex and E.V.A. with a techno-organic virus, seemingly killing them both to keep her plan secret. However, it was all a ruse as Mystique knew she was being monitored by Shepard. Fantomex later resurfaces and helps Mystique capture Shepard, giving her access to Steinbeck whom she finally defeats.\n\nDuring his tenure as leader of HAMMER, Norman Osborn tries to take control of the World and the Weapon Plus creations. Wolverine and Noh-Varr head to the World to try to stop Norman Osborn but are soon attacked by a large army of Weapon Plus creations infected by Allgod (Weapon XVI), the living religion. Noh-Varr is rescued by Fantomex (who has apparently spent all the time since his last appearance \"stealing things mostly\" and admits he should have kept an eye on the World), and the two of them make their way to the World's brain (now a sentient being) where they are confronted by the Allgod drones, Wolverine included. Fantomex is not affected by Allgod because nanites in his neocortex render him incapable of believing in anything greater than himself. Noh-Varr is able to disarm Allgod by kissing the World's brain, thus showing it some compassion, and disabling Allgod. Immediately after this, the three of them defeat Osborn's invading army of Deathlok prototypes. Fantomex then uses a shrink-ray he reportedly stole from Doctor Doom to shrink the World and take it for his own.\n\nSoon afterwards Fantomex is hired by a young mutant boy to hunt a rogue Predator X stalking mutants beneath New York City. After dealing with the Predator X, Fantomex and E.V.A. run into Wolverine, Psylocke, and Colossus, who ask for his help to defeat the creators of the Predator X. Fantomex initially turns their request down, but is later convinced by the same young boy he helped to help the X-Men. Fantomex saves the team from a group of John Sublime's associates and later takes them home.\n\nFantomex remains with the X-Men on Utopia and is later seen in San Francisco fighting alongside the X-Men against Bastion's army of Nimrod sentinels. Once the battle is over, he's shown to have secretly joined a new iteration of X-Force, alongside Wolverine, Archangel, Psylocke, and Deadpool.\n\nThe first mission of the new team is an assassination job to kill Apocalypse, reborn in the form of a child and being indoctrinated by Clan Akkaba on their Moon base. After defeating Apocalypse's Final Horsemen and getting to the young Apocalypse, no one on the team can summon up the courage to kill a child. When the group resigns to bring the child back with them and to reeducate him, Fantomex fires a shot in the child's head, apparently killing him.\n\nSoon afterwards, Fantomex realizes a presence calling itself Weapon Infinity has started manipulating the timestream within the World. After a battle against Weapon Infinity (actually the transforming of all future heroes into time-travelling Deathlok-type cyborgs ), it is revealed that Fantomex has actually cloned the Apocalypse child in order to see if the boy could become a hero if raised as a good man in a virtual environment deep within the World.\n\nFantomex is later abducted by Captain Britain who brands him a dimensional threat and take him to Otherworld, where an interdimensional court sentences him to erasure from existence itself. He is rescued by his teammate Psylocke, who turns against her brothers. Together they encounter the Skinless Man and rejoin their teammates to defeat The Goat, a corrupted future incarnation of Psylocke and Captain Britain's older brother Jamie Braddock, who attempted to consume the multiverse.\n\nWhen Psylocke is captured by the newly reformed Brotherhood of Evil Mutants, Fantomex sacrifices himself to save her. He is captured and killed when the Skinless Man cuts out his heart. With his connection to E.V.A severed, she believes herself dying as well. She survives, however, and evolves into a humanoid form.\n\nAfter Uncanny X-Force disbands, E.V.A. attempts to clone Fantomex back to life, but due to his three brains, an error occurs and three different bodies are grown for each personality: the evil brain becomes \"Weapon XIII\" (originally referred to as \"Jean-Phillippe\"), and wears a costume with inverted colors; the noble brain becomes \"Cluster\", a female version of Fantomex; and the mischievous one is restored to his proper body, taking the name of \"Fantomex\". He goes on to continue his relationship with Psylocke. Fantomex and Cluster later hijack a plane (leaving the pilot drugged and the flight attendants bound and gagged) in order to find Psylocke and Storm, but Weapon XIII follows and kidnaps Fantomex. Cluster enlists the help of the new Uncanny X-Force (Puck, Psylocke, Spiral, and Storm) to find Fantomex.\n\nPyslocke and Cluster travel to Madripor to hunt Weapon XIII. Weapon XIII uses his power of misdirection (which Fantomex and Cluster no longer possess) to confess his love to Psylocke. She agrees to stay with him only if he allows her to kill Fantomex, who betrayed her during a heist at the Louvre. During a heated battle she decides to free Fantomex and stun Weapon XIII, stating that she is done with all three of them.\n\nCable recruits Fantomex as part of his new X-Force team with the promise that he'll help Fantomex find Cluster and Weapon XIII. He proves a questionable ally, as he constantly bickers with Psylocke and has a psychic sexual relations with Meme, who he really knows is actually Hope Summers (who Cable thinks is in a coma). He also kills new recruit because \"he was bored\". The only concession that keeps Fantomex in line is that he gets to kill Cable every night,since Cable's body dies at the end of the day anyway and he has a clone ready to take his place the next day. Eventually Hope hacks into his mind and unwittingly transfers the super-mutant genetic code from mutant arms trafficker Volga. He then betrays the team, but is shot in the head by Domino. This is short-lived since E.V.A. is able to reboot his brain using the super-mutant code and now Fantomex has wings and god-like powers. Initially, he is tricked by Meme/Hope Summers into thinking he killed the team, but once he learns the ruse he vows vengeance. Fantomex is tricked again by Cable by agreeing to meet at various spy organization or organized crime locations for showdowns, but X-Force never shows; however, Fantomex still destroys the base, which ultimately helps X-Force's missions. Fantomex eventually finds X-Force, but is tricked by ForgetMeNot into teleporting near Hope Summers, who copies his super-powers. Instead of fighting him head-on, Hope implants a thought into his mind that one cannot be perfect, unless you have a well rounded personality, which includes inadequacies and insecurities. Fantomex cannot comprehend being perfect and imperfect, so he has a mental breakdown. Psylocke then uses her psychic blades to scramble his brain.\n\nAs part of Astonishing X-men Fantomex is seemingly reunited with E.V.A after blaming Psylocke for taking E.V.A away from him in a previous encounter/storyline, He also now is working with Gambit until he pays what he owes to Fantomex. After a failed theft , Gambit was psychically called by Psylocke to help her, and Fantomex says he'll follow Gambit to the astral plane until he pays what he owes to him to the rest of psychically called X-men so that they know that their relationship is because of business reasons and not personal. After the team was split up in the astral plane, Fantomex ended up with Mystique and Mystique says they should enjoy themselves in the astral plane as they could conjure up anything before the Shadow King finds them and pain ensues, they have multiple activities together before sharing an intimate kiss and before they could go any further they were then teleported in front of an alive Professor X. It is revealed that Professor X's astral self has been trapped by the Shadow King and forced into a game with the X-Men as pawns, but Xavier is able to beat his old enemy by tricking him into bringing Rogue, Mystique, and Fantomex into the astral plane, as their malleable identities made them particularly powerful in this field of combat. At the conclusion of the confrontation, Fantomex sacrifices his body so that Xavier can return to Earth while he remains on the astral plane in the professor's place, Fantomex reasoning that nobody knows who he is outside of the role he was cast in by the Weapon X program, whereas this sacrifice will ensure that he is remembered for a great act by allowing Charles Xavier to return to life.\n\nFantomex can create extremely realistic illusions (he calls this ability \"misdirection\"). This ability is based on \"reality skewing\", rather than telepathy or holographic projection (Uncanny X-Force 14).\n\nFantomex has an external nervous system referred to as E.V.A. He has mentioned that E.V.A. emerged from his mouth during his time in the World and developed into a techno-organic flying saucer-like vessel. The relationship between E.V.A and Fantomex is symbiotic, so if E.V.A. experiences pain when she is not within Fantomex, he will feel it as well. When E.V.A. is separated from his body, Fantomex feels no pain and seems able to ignore most injuries. Along with this symbiotic relationship, Fantomex is linked to E.V.A. via telepathy. He can see through E.V.A.'s point of view and can take control of her movement. However, this requires concentration on the part of Fantomex. Moreover, E.V.A, as a bio-mechanical being, can reshape her body into a variety of forms, fly herself, and generate energy discharges to be used as weapons. Fantomex contains three brains that used for parallel and independent thinking as well as nano-active blood; the nanites in his brain prohibit him from believing in anything greater than himself, such as gods or any supernatural beings. He also maintains an internal back-up nervous system which can be engaged if E.V.A. is damaged. However, this system is less complex than E.V.A. and does not allow Fantomex to see colors.\n\nHe possesses enhanced physical abilities. Fantomex is also capable of registering frequencies beyond the hearing range of normal humans. He even mentioned a healing factor on one occasion.\n\nHis three brains, allow him to survive severe head wounds since his secondary brains can take over should one be destroyed.\n\nFantomex can also enter a trance state and perform crucial tasks such as performing surgery on himself. In this state, he can also recover faster while placed in water. He can expertly read the body language of others in order to predict their attacks. He is a very skilled hand-to-hand combatant and a master of stealth techniques. His title in his birthplace, the World, was \"stealth-fighter.\"\n\nFantomex is a superb marksman. He used to use special bullets covered in sentient mutant skin that never missed their target (designed by Sir James Braddock, the father of Psylocke and Captain Britain) but he used his last of these against Archangel. He carries a variety of guns and other weapons.\n\nHis mask incorporates telepathy-blocking ceramics. These allow his mind to remain completely unreadable, even facing the most powerful telepaths of the Marvel Universe (Professor X and the Shadow King among others).\n\nIn one variant of the \"Days of Future Past\" timeline (titled \"Days of Future Now\" and depicted in Frank Tieri's \"Weapon X\" series), Weapon X and the Sentinels are at war with Wolverine's X-Men and many other mutant groups, including Excelsior and Gene Nation. In this timeline, Fantomex becomes the host of Sublime and, possessed by the sentient bacteria, sabotages Wolverine's efforts to overthrow Weapon X.\n\nIn the \"Here Comes Tomorrow\" storyline, set in an alternate timeline 150 years in the future, the entire world is ruled by Beast (possessed by Sublime). E.V.A. is a member of this era's X-Men, which includes Wolverine, Tito (Beak's grandson), Tom Skylark and his Sentinel known as Rover, Three-in-One (the Stepford Cuckoos), No-Girl, and a reformed Cassandra Nova as their leader. E.V.A. has taken on a humanoid form and does not want to bond with anyone else's nervous system after \"what happened to Fantomex.\" Whatever happened to Fantomex is never explicitly explained in the storyline, though it is strongly hinted that Beast's U-Man follower, Apollyon the Destroyer, is actually Fantomex.\n\nFantomex is depicted briefly in \"X-Men: The End\" as part of X-23's dream induced by the Ladies Mastermind, as she is stated to be in love with him in this reality. In X-23's dream, they are shown together playing with a small daughter in their backyard.\n\n\n"}

According to the Penal Code in force until 2018, the crime of femicide is incurred, when a man or men kill a woman for reasons of gender, with hatred and contempt for her condition as a woman. Between 2002 and 2013 3,923 women were murdered. The number of femicides makes up 9.6% of the total number of homicides in the country. In 2013, 53 women were killed every month and, as it occurs in the rest of murders, more than 90% of the cases were left in impunity. Before being killed, the women are commonly also burned, raped, and tortured. Between 2010 and 2013 the number of murders increased in 65%.\n\nThe local national authorities have been accused of inaction by the population, given that in many cases it has not been cleared the responsibility of said felonies. There are a few government and non-government organizations that provide support to the mothers and relatives victims of femicide. In 2015, the Honduran government committed with 30 million Honduran lempiras for the creation of a special unit in the 2016 budget for femicide investigation.\n\nThe violent deaths of women and femicides registered between January and December of 2017, added up a total of 389 cases. To disaggregate the data according to the age of the victims, 30.1% (117) was between 15 and 24 years old, women that are in the process of building their identity, educational training, and reproductive age. The records show that the greatest vulnerability occurred in the range of 20 to 24 years, accumulating 17.2% (67) of the total, while the age groups that showed the lowest number of victims were girls under 15 years of age with 32 cases and women aged 60 and over, with 21 victims.\n\nAs in most homicides comitted in Honduras, femicides continue to occur due to lack of investigation and judicial process.\n\nRiccy Mabel Martínez Sevilla, born in The Ceiba Caribbean region of Honduras, was a third-year student of education at the \"Escuela Normal Mixta Pedro Nufio\" in Tegucigalpa.\n\nHer boyfriend, Rubén Hurtado Padilla, had been recruited to serve the mandatory military service, so Riccy Mabel decided to visit the Battalion of Communications in the outskirts of Tegucigalpa to request her boyfriend's release. That same day, Riccy disappeared, she was raped and killed by at least four men, according to the FBI forensic exams.\n\nHer body was found on July 15, 1991 by a stream, one of the main suspects in the rape and killing was Colonel Ángel Castillo Maradiaga.\n\nA key witness of the crime was Esteban García, an ice cream vendor, who affirmed having seen the teenager on board a car identical to that of the colonel, but a few days earlier of his statement he was beaten to death by a gang in an apparent robbery.\n\nBlanca Jeanette Kawas was a Honduran environmental activist known for her role in the preservation of more than 400 species of flora and fauna. She carried out acts against the Carlos Roberto Reina Idiáquez government due to the granting of property titles to farmers and business men in the \"Punta Sal\" reserves, today known as the Jeanette Kawas National Park.\n\nTwo days after the protest, on February 6, 1995, at 7:45 pm, Jeanette Kawas was shot dead with a firearm by two unidentified suspects in her house in Barrio El Centro, in Tela, Atlántida. Among the murder suspects are Colonel Mario Amaya (known as \"Tigre Amaya\"), who would have met with Sargeant Ismael Perdomo and Mario Pineda (known as \"Chapin\") in the police headquarters of Tela.\n\nIn November 2014, adolescent María José Alvarado and her sister Sofía Trinidad were murdered at a party while celebrating the birthday of Sofía's ex-boyfriend. Her boyfriend Plutarco Ruíz was identified by witnesses as the murderer, and he eventually confessed to the crime. Having been declared guilty, his sentence was predicted to be between 60 and 80 years. He was sentenced on November 12, 2015.\n\nBerta Cáceres, a Lenca environmental activist and indigenous leader, was murdered on March 2, 2016. She was killed in her home by unidentifed intruders with a fireaarm after years of threats against her life. Cáceres' death was widely condemned, with calls for an investigation coming from the Organization of American States (OAS), the U.S. Ambassador to Honduras, and the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights. Honduran president Juan Orlando Hernández declared the investigation of the murder a priority, and Luis Almagro, the Secretary General of the OAS, reiterated the OAS's previous call for special protection of indigenous human rights defenders in Honduras. Other expressions of support came from American actor and environmentalist Leonardo DiCaprio, Canadian author and activist Naomi Klein, Amnesty International, former Colombian senator Piedad Córdoba, Oxfam, the Mayor of Barcelona Ada Colau, U.S. Senator Patrick Leahy, and Venezuelan president Nicolás Maduro.\n\nOne of the most common methods of murdering women in Honduras is contract killing, shooting the women either inside or outside of their residence and then escaping.\n\nIn February 2013 the National Congress of Honduras approved a reform in the national civil code which classified femicide as a serious felony, sanctioning with a sentence of up to 40 years in prison.\n\nCauses for the high level of femicides in Honduras are varied, although one of the principal causes is impunity, because 90% of murders are not investigated, so the killers continue to commit more femicides. \n\nIn 2015, the government of Honduras attributed 30 million Honduran lempiras to the creation of a special unit in the 2016 budget for the investigation of femicides.\n\n"}

She was perceived as a martyr after she was arrested and died in prison.\n\nShe was born on May 21, 1632 into a family of the okolnichy Prokopy Feodorovich Sokovnin. At the age of 17, she was married to the boyar Gleb Morozov, brother to the tsar's tutor Boris Morozov, one of the wealthiest men in Russia and brother-in-law of Tsar Alexis. Feodosia bore one child to Gleb, a son, Ivan. After her husband's early death in 1662, she retained a prominent position at the Russian court as a lady-in-waiting to Tsarina Maria. She also inherited vast wealth, which she administered on behalf of her son Ivan.\n\nDuring the Raskol, because Archpriest Avvakum was her confessor, Feodosia joined the Old Believers' movement and secretly took monastic vows with the name Theodora. She played an important role in convincing her sister, Princess Evdokia Urusova, to join the Old Believers. They were also joined by fellow noblewoman Maria Danilova. Following Avvakum, she rejected the reforms of Patriarch Nikon insisting he had no authority in the church to alter established practices, identifying such innovations with the corruption of the faith by the antichrist.\n\nAfter many misfortunes the two sisters and Danilova were arrested by order of Tsar Alexis of Russia in 1671. They were interrogated and tortured over a long period, but refused to recant. Attempts to reach a compromise led by Patriarch Pitirim were also rejected. While she was under arrest, her son Ivan died.\n\nAlexis contemplated having Morozova burned at the stake, but was dissuaded. Instead she and the others were incarcerated in an underground cellar of the St. Paphnutius Monastery at Borovsk, where they endured considerable deprivations. After the appointment of a new Patriarch, Ioakim, they were deprived of all support and were slowly starved. All three succumbed, probably to starvation, in 1675, with Morozova dying on December 1.\n\nAvvakum wrote a \"Lament for the three martyrs\". A hagiography, \"Tale of Boiarynia Morozov\", by an unknown author, gave an account of her life as a martyr. The story circulated widely and miracles were attributed to Morozova by Old Believers. Many Old Believer communities continue to venerate her as a martyr.\n\nNevertheless, her reputation was limited until Morozova's role as a representative of Russian identity and tradition became important to nationalist writers in the 19th century. She became a household name after being discussed by important Russian writers and depicted by Vasily Surikov. She was also taken as a heroine by some radical groups, who saw her as a symbol of resistance to state power. The People's Will revolutionary movement promoted her, and her virtues were praised by writers of the Soviet era such as Anna Akhmatova, Varlam Shalamov and Fazil Iskander, who \"symbolically enlisted her in their own causes of resistance\".\n\nA chapel was constructed in 2002 on the site of the prison where Morozova died.\n\n"}

At the western edge of the cemetery is the grave of Joseph Nevitt, a veteran of the American Revolution.\n\nOriginally named Trinity Church Upper Grave Yard, the cemetery was established by Holy Trinity Catholic Church in 1832, and enlarged between 1850 and 1870. The cemetery walls were torn down in 1901 and new ones erected, and a large number of trees cut down to prevent roots from dislocating memorials and limbs from damaging monuments during storms.

He was President of the Royal Irish Academy (1822–35), President of the Royal Astronomical Society (1831–33). He was awarded the Cunningham Medal in 1818, and the Copley Medal in 1824.\n\nBrinkley was born in Woodbridge, Suffolk and was baptised there on 31 January 1763, the illegitimate son of Sarah Brinkley, a butcher's daughter.\n\nOn being admitted to Cambridge, he was recorded as being the son of John Toler Brinkley, a vintner, but it is strongly suggested that his real father was John Toler, 1st Earl of Norbury, Chief Justice of the Irish Court of Common Pleas.\n\nHis exact date of birth is unknown; he has often been assigned the birth year 1763, as at least one obituary gives his age at death in 1835 as 72. However, his memorial at Trinity College, Dublin states that he died aged 70; also, he was recorded as being 17 upon matriculation at Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge in August 1783, both of which imply a slightly later birth year.\n\nHe graduated Bachelor of Arts (BA) in 1788 as senior wrangler and Smith's Prizeman, was elected a fellow of the college and was awarded Cambridge Master of Arts (MA Cantab) in 1791. He was ordained at Lincoln Cathedral in the same year.\n\nIn 1792 he became the second Andrews Professor of Astronomy in the University of Dublin, which carried the new title of Royal Astronomer of Ireland. Together with John Law, Bishop of Elphin, he drafted the chapter on \"Astronomy\" in William Paley's \"Natural Theology.\" His main work concerned stellar astronomy and he published his \"Elements of Plane Astronomy\" in 1808.\n\nIn 1818 he was awarded the prestigious Cunningham Medal of the Royal Irish Academy and in 1822 was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. He was awarded the Copley Medal by the Royal Society in 1824.\n\nBrinkley's observations that several stars shifted their apparent place in the sky in the course of a year were disproved at Greenwich by his contemporary John Pond, the Astronomer Royal. In 1826, he was appointed Bishop of Cloyne in County Cork, a position he held for the remaining nine years of his life. Brinkley was elected President of the Royal Astronomical Society in 1831, serving in that position for two years.\n\nBrinkley died in 1835 at Leeson Street, Dublin and was buried in Trinity College chapel. He had become a Doctor of Divinity (DD) and an honorary Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh (HFRSE). He was succeeded at Dunsink Observatory by William Rowan Hamilton.\n\nBrinkley married Esther, daughter of Matthew Weld of Molesworth Street, Sheriff of Dublin City, by his wife Elizabeth Kane, daughter of Nathaniel Kane (d. 1757) of Drumreaske, Co.

{"id": "7797981", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7797981", "title": "John Juvenal Ancina", "text": "John Juvenal Ancina\n\nBlessed Giovanni Giovenale Ancina (19 October 1545 – 30 August 1604) was an Italian Roman Catholic prelate who served as the Bishop of Saluzzo and was a professed member from the Oratorians. The bishop was also a scholar and music composer and was also known for being a noted orator. He served in the Oratorians as a simple priest for around two decades prior to his episcopal appointment which he attempted to elude for five months before submitting to Pope Clement VIII and accepting the papal appointment. He entered his diocese several months later where he became noted for his charitable work with the poor and his efforts to better implement the reforms of the Council of Trent.\n\nHis cause for sainthood commenced soon after his death though complications arose due to a lack of concrete evidence suggesting that he was killed in hatred of the faith due to his being poisoned so that framework for the cause was abandoned well into the cause's advanced stages. His beatification was celebrated under Pope Leo XIII in 1890 in Saint Peter's Basilica.\n\nGiovanni Giovenale Ancina was born at dawn on 19 October 1545 in Fossano as the first of four children to the successful businessman Durando Ancina (of Spanish roots) and Lucia degli Araudini; he was in fear of death so his parents turned to Saint Juvenal to restore his health which happened so the saint's name became his middle name. His brother was the Oratorian priest Giovanni Matteo Ancina who followed him after birth and then two sisters.\n\nThe two brothers made a little chapel in their home and spent their spare time singing psalms and litanies before images of the Madonna and the saints since both were pious children. He studied at Montpellier in France (his father sent him there in 1559 though excellent results saw his admittance to a prestigious Turin institute) and then studied at Padua and Mondovì as well as in Turin; he graduated with degrees in both medicine and philosophical studies; he travelled to Montpellier alongside a friend Lazarus Marengo. In Mondovì he studied subjects such as mathematics and rhetoric and published the \"Academia Subalpina\" while there; he had not finished his course there when news reached him his father would soon die so he rushed to aid him in his final hours. After his father died he attended a Padua college where he wrote the Latin poem \"The Naval Battle of the Christian Princes\" in 1566 and dedicated this to the Doge of Venice Girolamo Priuli. The death of Pope Pius V in mid-1572 saw him recite an ode in public in the late pontiff's honor while making the accurate prediction that the next pope would title himself as \"Gregory\". His mother died while he was in Turin in 1569 and in 1572 the Order of Saint Augustine invited him to attend their provincial chapter at Savigliano.\n\nHe became an accomplished musician and man of letters. His talents and interests coupled with his various connections led him to a wide range of career options which included a stint as a professor of medicine at the Turin college. He first became a doctor and then in 1574 accompanied Count Federigo Madrucci to Rome as the count's personal doctor. It was there in Rome that Ancina attended the theological lectures that Cardinal Saint Robert Bellarmine gave and the two became quick friends. Ancina had known he would not soon return to Turin so sent part of his works to the Order of Friars Minor Capuchin at Fossano and asked the remainder be given to a bookseller to sell on his behalf. But Ancina learnt the bookseller sold the books but used the profits for himself but wrote him a letter forgiving him while sending another to his relations asking that the bookseller be forgiven.\n\nHe also began to participate in the activities of the Oratorians of Saint Philip Neri and met Saint Philip Neri himself around 1575. In the order he had been honored in sweeping the church or cleaning the candlesticks for he believed the menial jobs were better suited for him despite his learned prowess. He was content with three to four hours' worth of sleep and often slept on the bare floor; he wore a hair shirt and girdle and wore a coarse linen shirt over his cassock while choosing coarse food.\n\nBut Neri himself dissuaded Ancina from joining a religious order in favor of the Oratorians and so he entered that order on 1 October 1578 while he was made a deacon in 1579; Ancina himself made his solemn profession later on 7 October 1580. He was later ordained to the priesthood on 9 June 1582. He had been a deacon for an extended period until Neri bade him accept the priesthood. In 1586 he was sent to Naples to help in the establishment of a house for the Oratorians. He proved to be effective in reaching the population both through his preaching and his musical talents. It was there in Naples that Ancina published the \"Tempio Armonico della Beatissima Vergine\" which was a collection of spiritual songs set to a range of voices. Through his development of cultural activities he drew the participation of the aristocrats of the town. He also wrote the \"Oratorio dei Principi\" as a guide to the moral issues the people faced at the time. His fame increased over time and his lifelong friend Cardinal Cesare Baronio dubbed him \"a new Saint Basil\". He met Francesco Maria Tarugi - a fellow Oratorian - who was later named as a cardinal. His niece Lucilla Forti was a penniless orphan that he and his brother sent for to come to Rome and the brothers put her under the care of a matron and supported her education at the Dominican convent of Santa Maria Maddalena on Monte Cavallo. Forti was at first denied admittance into the order when she realized she wanted to become a nun herself but was soon granted permission. Just before her official reception she happened to meet the papal carriage where Pope Gregory XIV stopped and called her to him. The pope blessed her and expressed his delight at the fact that Ancina was her maternal uncle.\n\nAround 1596 he became concerned when the episcopal sees of Nice and Vercelli became vacant for he heard a whisper that the Duke of Savoy wanted to nominate him to the pope for one of the positions. He was called to Rome in the autumn of 1596 where Pope Clement VIII's nephew Pietro Aldobrandini told him that the pope wanted to raise Ancina into the episcopate. The pope himself had referred to Ancina as the best prepared candidate for an episcopal role he had ever heard of. Ancina was reluctant to accept this nomination but in an ironic twist further enhanced his reputation through his notable preaching in the various places (in Loreto and Cingoli as well as Fermo amongst others) which he visited over the period of five months while perpetrating this evasion. In 1598 while hiding in San Severino he composed \"The Wandering Pilgrim\" which made the accurate prediction that the pope would die in 1605. But his hiding place was soon discovered and he was summoned to Rome where the pope asked him to preach before him despite the priest's surprise. The pope wanted him to become the Bishop of Mondovì but he begged that it be the see of Saluzzo so he could preach to heretics and convert their hearts; on 26 August 1602 the cardinal-nephew prevailed this plea on the pope and he was named as the Bishop of Saluzzo. Cardinal Alessandro de' Medici - the future Pope Leo XI - was delighted of his appointment and had hailed Ancina for his learnedness and his succinct responses to theological questions that were posed to him.\n\nHe received his episcopal consecration as a bishop on 1 September 1602 in the church of Santa Maria in Vallicella from Camillo Borghese - future Pope Paul V. Cardinal Francesco Maria Tarugi and Cardinal Cesare Baronio were also in attendance. Ancina left Rome on 2 October 1602 and arrived in Turin on 19 October before heading to Fossano where he left on 5 March 1603 to his new diocese. He took possession of his new episcopal see on 6 March 1603. He once sought leave from Clement VIII to renounce his see and go to Geneva to preach but the pope refused this plea.\n\nAncina made a major goal of his episcopate the implementation of the directives of the recent Council of Trent. In line with this he convened a gathering of the episcopate where he laid out the methods of reform for both those in the priesthood and for the faithful. He made arrangements to set up a religious educational institute to provide a higher level of knowledge and dedication in new priests. He gave a large emphasis to the instruction of the faithful in the teachings and beliefs of the faith for which he introduced the use of the new catechism that the Council of Trent had drawn up. He encouraged the adoration of the Blessed Sacrament.\n\nThe Bishop Saint Francis de Sales had a great admiration for Ancina who was later to establish and join an Oratorian house in his own diocese. The two often corresponded with each other and Ancina received a letter from his friend on 17 May 1599 who sent it from Turin at the time. On 3 May 1603 the Bishop de Sales had invited him to attend a sermon that he was to give.\n\nThe bishop died on 30 August 1604. It was his zeal which led to his death — a renegade monk poisoned him after the bishop disciplined him for visiting a convent with a sinful intent. Ancina knew quite well who his poisoner was but refused to provide a statement against him. On 20 August the monk gave him wine laced with poison under the guise of reconciliation; the bishop was surprised at the gesture but drank the contents. The monk then fled to Genoa under the false pretense of going to Savona for a pilgrimage. The bishop began vomiting and was confined to his bed as his condition worsened and when suffering overcame him he murmured to himself: \"Oh! What poison! What terrible poison this is!\" The Duke of Savoy heard of this and sent his private doctor to help Ancina though nothing could be done at that stage. He summoned his brother to him and then asked for his confession to be heard before receiving the Extreme Unction. The ailing bishop asked to be laid on the bare floor to die and he invoked Saint Gennaro - whom he fostered a devotion to. His final words were: \"Jesus, sweet Jesus, with Mary give peace to my soul\". He was buried in the diocesan cathedral. In 1620 his remains were exhumed and found well-preserved but turned into dust upon contact with the air lest for the skull and several bones.\n\nThe beatification process opened in an informative process in 1619 in Saluzzo and Fossano as well as in Genoa and Acqui. The formal introduction to the cause came on 2 December 1621 under Pope Gregory XV and he became titled as a Servant of God as a result. Pope Urban VIII confirmed the cause's opening in 1624 and an apostolic process opened in Rome and Saluzzo as well as Turin and Naples. The cause was then suspended for a time until 1666 when Pope Alexander VII reopened it. Saint Francis de Sales attested to Ancina's saintliness sometime in the 1660s and the Congregation for Rites later validated the informative and apostolic processes in 1716.\n\nThe confirmation of Ancina's life of heroic virtue allowed for Pope Pius IX to title him as Venerable on 29 January 1870. Pope Leo XIII later approved two miracles attributed to Ancina's intercession on 30 May 1889 and beatified the late bishop in Saint Peter's Basilica on 9 February 1890.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "18337", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18337", "title": "Last rites", "text": "Last rites\n\nThe last rites, in Roman Catholicism, are the last prayers and ministrations given to an individual of the faith, when possible, shortly before death. The last rites go by various names. They may be administered to those awaiting execution, mortally injured, or terminally ill.\n\nWhat in the judgment of the Roman Catholic Church are properly described as the Last Rites are Viaticum (Holy Communion administered to someone who is dying), and the ritual prayers of Commendation of the Dying, and Prayers for the Dead.\n\nOf these, only Viaticum is a sacrament.\n\nThe sacrament of Anointing of the Sick has often been postponed until someone is near death, so much so that, in spite of the fact that in all celebrations of this sacrament, the liturgy prays for recovery of the health of the sick person if that would be conducive to his salvation, Anointing of the Sick has been thought to be exclusively for the dying and has been called Extreme Unction (Final Anointing). If administered to someone who is not just ill but near death, Anointing of the Sick is generally accompanied by celebration of the sacraments of Penance and Viaticum. In such cases, the normal order of administration is: first Penance, then Anointing, then Viaticum.\n\nAlthough these three sacraments are not, in the proper sense, the Last Rites, they are sometimes mistakenly spoken of as such.\n\nThe Eucharist given as Viaticum is the only sacrament essentially associated with dying: \"The celebration of the Eucharist as Viaticum is the sacrament proper to the dying Christian\".\n\nIn the Roman Ritual's \"Pastoral Care of the Sick: Rites of Anointing and Viaticum\", Viaticum is the only sacrament dealt with in \"Part II: Pastoral Care of the Dying\". Within that part, the chapter on Viaticum is followed by two more chapters, one on \"Commendation of the Dying\", with short texts, mainly from the Bible, a special form of the litany of the saints, and other prayers, and the other on \"Prayers for the Dead\". A final chapter provides \"Rites for Exceptional Circumstances\", namely, the \"Continuous Rite of Penance, Anointing, and Viaticum\", \"Rite for Emergencies\", and \"Christian Initiation for the Dying\". The last of these concerns the administration of the sacraments of Baptism and Confirmation to those who have not received them.\n\nIn addition, the priest has authority to bestow a blessing in the name of the Pope on the dying person, to which a plenary indulgence is attached.\n\nPeople awaiting execution would receive Confession and Viaticum, but not Anointing of the Sick, since their impending death is not on account of an illness.\n\nIn the Orthodox Church and those Eastern Catholic Churches which follow the Byzantine Rite, the last rites consist of the Sacred Mysteries (sacraments) of Confession and the reception of Holy Communion.\n\nFollowing these sacraments, when a person dies, there are a series of prayers known as \"The Office at the Parting of the Soul From the Body\". This consists of a blessing by the priest, the usual beginning, and after the Lord's Prayer, Psalm 50. Then a Canon to the Theotokos is chanted, entitled, \"On behalf of a man whose soul is departing, and who cannot speak\". This is an elongated poem speaking in the person of the one who is dying, asking for forgiveness of sin, the mercy of God, and the intercession of the saints. The rite is concluded by three prayers said by the priest, the last one being said \"at the departure of the soul.\"\n\nThere is an alternative rite known as \"The Office at the Parting of the Soul from the Body When a Man has Suffered for a Long Time\". The outline of this rite is the same as above, except that Psalm 70 and Psalm 143 precede Psalm 50, and the words of the canon and the prayers are different.\n\nThe rubric in the Book of Needs (priest's service book) states, \"With respect to the Services said at the parting of the soul, we note that if time does not permit to read the whole Canon, then customarily just one of the prayers, found at the end of the Canon, is read by the Priest at the moment of the parting of the soul from the body.\"\n\nAs soon as the person has died the priest begins \"The Office After the Departure of the Soul From the Body\" (also known as \"The First Pannikhida\").\n\nIn the Orthodox Church Holy Unction is not considered to be solely a part of a person's preparation for death, but is administered to any Orthodox Christian who is ill, physically or spiritually, to ask for God's mercy and forgiveness of sin. There is an abbreviated form of Holy Unction to be performed for a person in imminent danger of death, which does not replace the full rite in other cases.\n\n\nhttp://www.usccb.org/beliefs-and-teachings/how-we-teach/catechesis/upload/Sacramental-Catechesis-11-19-12.pdf\n\n"}
{"id": "38655789", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=38655789", "title": "List of World War I Memorials and Cemeteries in Lorraine", "text": "List of World War I Memorials and Cemeteries in Lorraine\n\nLorraine comprises the \"départements\" of Meurthe-et-Moselle, Meuse, Moselle and Vosges and the principal cities are Nancy, Bar-le-Duc, Metz and Épinal.\n\nHistorians have called the period in Lorraine from 14 August to 13 September 1914 the \"Battle of Lorraine\" and this covers a sequence of battles including the Battle of Morhange, the Battle of the Trouée de Charmes, the Battle of Rozelieures, the Battle of the Mortagne, and the Battle of the Grand Couronné. These all involved the 2nd French Army.\nSouth-east of Nancy the French Ist Army under General Dubail had many encounters with the Germans and apart from the fighting at Sarrebourg they fought the Battle of the Haute-Meurthe from 24 August to 11 September 1914. This will be dealt with in the article covering Alsace. After these battles a defined front line was established by late September and was not to change significantly until the end of the war, although fighting from trench to trench would occur almost daily.\n\nThe short period of August to September 1914, saw the French Plan XVII shattered and this, and the ultimate failure of the Von Schlieffen plan, saw the \"war of movement\" end and a static war of trenches and more trenches take over.\n\nFor France the death toll was notable and by the end of August, the French Army had suffered 75,000 dead of which 27,000 were killed on 22 August alone, the death toll was similar to first day on the Somme. Total French casualties for the first month of the war were 260,000 of which 140,000 were sustained during the climactic final four days of the battle of the Frontiers.\n\nThis encounter is part of what is also known as the \"Battle of Lorraine\" and was fought from 14 August to 24 August 1914.\n\nThe French Army's \"Plan XV11\" set out the invasion of Lorraine and her return to France as a major objective. Annexed by Prussia after the 1870-1871 Franco Prussian War, along with Alsace, its return to France was essential. The French were therefore to give top priority to retaking Lorraine and Alsace while the Germans had other ideas and were intent on pursuing the Von Schlieffen plan to the north. The beginning of the war in August 1914 saw the two protagonists lock horns in the north at Charleroi, in the centre at the Ardennes and in Lorraine at Morhange and Sarrebourg, while in Alsace the two sides fought at Mulhausen. These early battles were identified by historians as the \"Battles of the Frontiers\" and the encounters at Morhange and Sarrebourg were two of them.\n\nOn 14 August 1914, the French attacked on two fronts, with General Auguste Dubail leading the French 1st Army with the objective being to take Sarrebourg to the east of Nancy, while General Noel de Castelnau, leading the French 2nd Army, would attack Morhange. The 1st and 2nd French Army were known as the \"Army of Lorraine\". Both Sarrebourg and Morhange were fortified towns. Facing the French were the German 6th and 7th Armies. Prince Rupprecht had command of the 6th and overall command of both armies, with General Josias von Herringen having command of the 7th.\n\nAt this stage the German Army, knowing that their major effort was taking place with the march through Luxembourg and Belgium, deliberately followed a policy of \"retreat\", feigning to be overwhelmed by the French, but luring them into a position where they would be vulnerable to a fierce counter-attack. \"Come into my parlour said the spider to the fly.\" However, as the French advanced Rupprecht soon tired of such tactics and pressed von Moltke to allow him to be more aggressive. He wanted to drive forward and push the French back to Nancy. Rupprecht had his way, although this flew in the face of the blueprint of the von Schlieffen plan and on 20 August 1914, the Germans went on the offensive and the French 2nd Army were forced to retreat. Dubail and the French 1st Army could now no longer stay out on a limb attacking Sarrebourg and he also retreated, but despite the retreat of the two French armies, Foch's XX Corps were able to successfully defend Nancy.\n\nThe French front-line was however now in disorder and Joffre, the French Commander in Chief, had no alternative but to order a general withdrawal and only eight days after the French offensive had begun both the 1st and 2nd Armies were back to the line Belfort-Epinal-Toul. The Germans had also pushed through the \"Trouée des Charmes,\" a natural gap between Epinal and Toul, on 24 August, but their success was limited to establishing a small salient. The French line held and fighting continued until the end of August. Stalemate ensued. Given that they had not made any major gains, the Germans must have regretted tying up 26 Divisions in Lorraine and Alsace when these could have swung the outcome of the Battle of the Marne further to the north west. Morhange had then played an important role in the events of 1914.\n\nGeneral Dubail with his 1st Army and General de Castelnau with the 2nd Army, had however exhausted themselves in the fruitless attacks on Sarrebourg and Morhange and the French concept of \"offensive a outrance\" had withered before heavy German artillery, barbed wire and the now ubiquitous machine-gun.\n\nNow the French withdrew to the line of the Grande Couronné. In effect the policy of \"offensive a outrance\" died in the killing fields of Lorraine and amongst the corpses of soldiers with their bright red pantaloons there were no doubt bodies of some of their officers still wearing white gloves.\n\nRupprecht's artillery continued to pound the French lines. Ste Genevieve, near Nomeny, was battered, and it was decided that the French Army must retreat behind the Grand Couronné. The French looked for some respite and on 22 August 1914 they found it when Rupprecht took the offensive against Charmes and exposed his flank to the troops now positioned beyond Nancy. The Germans attacked, the French counter-attacked, and the German 6th and 7th Armies locked horns with the French 1st and 2nd Armies, the French backed by the guns of Belfort, Epinal and Toul. Again stalemate ensued; there was no victor. There had however been a quite horrendous loss of life.\n\nAfter Morhange and Sarrebourg, Castelnau's 2nd Army retreated to the Grand Couronné and Mortagne and from 21 to 23 August they withdrew from Lunéville,which was occupied by the Germans on the 22nd, and sought to make contact with Dubail's 1st Army.\n\nWhen the battle started on 24 August 225,000 French soldiers faced 300,000 Germans. The Germans objective was to reach and pass the gap at Charmes which lay between the forts of Toul and Epinal to then attack Commercy, Bar-Le-Duc and Verdun from the rear. Joffre's order was to defend Nancy and hold the position in front of Charmes so that Dubail could attack the German's flank at Mortagne and on the Meurthe.\n\nOn the 24th the Germans advanced from Mont-sur-Meurthe to Gerbéviller, passing the Mortagne and then attacked the fort at Manonviller which was taken on 27 August.\n\nAfter taking Lamath the Germans attacked towards Romain and Bayon and the French attacked their flank at Courbesseaux, Saint-Boingt, Essey-la-Côte and Damas-aux-Bois while the 2nd Army's artillery blasted the Germans from the Flainval plateau.\n\nOn the 25th the Germans took Rozelieures, which was retaken in the afternoon of the same day. Castelnau pushed on and the 15th and 16th Army Corps retook Einvaux, Lamath, Blainville, and reached the Meurthe and the Martagne. At the same time the 8th Army Corps of the 1st French Army conquered Domptail and Saint-Pierremont. At Crevic and at Courbesseaux the struggle was bloody.\n\nFrom the 26th to the 29th the German offensive was broken and the ground from Champenoux to Friscati was taken. Xermanénil was retaken and now the scene was set for the Battle of Grand-Couronné and the German attempt to take Nancy. Castelnau emerged victorious on 13 September, Castelnau took Lunéville and the Germans retired to the Seille where they would dig in for four long years. From 29 August to 7 September, Dubail's 1st French Army won the battles at Rambervillers and the Haute-Meurthe including fierce and bloody fighting on the Chipotte peak.\n\nThis part of the German line retreated to Parroy as far as the peak at Saales and dug down into their trenches.\n\nThis encounter ran from 24 to 26 August 1914.\n\nThe war in Lorraine had started rather badly for the French, with her 2nd Army retreating from Morhange which left the 1st Army having to pull back from Sarrebourg. Moltke, the German Chief of Staff, drew the conclusion that the 2nd Army was a spent force and had no further role to play and saw the opportunity to strengthen the attack to the rear of the French Armies which was the basis of the Von Schlieffen plan and what the German armies to the north were already trying to achieve. Moltke thought that if he could use Rupprecht wisely then the French could be hit twice from the rear, firstly by the German armies to the north and then by Rupprecht's 6th\n\nMoltke planned that Rupprecht's 6th Army would pass through the Trouée de Charmes which passed between the Forts of Toul and Epinal and then turn to the northwest and march north to Bar-le-Duc and take the French 3rd and 4th Armies in the rear.\n\nNow all depended on Castelnau whose 2nd Army now manned the Trouée de Charmes area and he learned from his Intelligence Service, that German columns were moving to Saffais and Bechamps and heading for the gap at the Trouée de Charmes. A few hours later French aerial observers would confirm this. Now the French High Command directed General Dubail, commanding the 1st French Army to put his 8th Division at Castelnau's disposal. Dubail did this immediately and now Castelnau had much needed reinforcements and knew exactly what the Germans were up to.\n\nOn 24 August Rupprecht's troops began to attack in the direction of the \"Trouée de Charmes\" and he concentrated this attack on the centre of the 2nd Army as this was judged to be the cornerstone of the French's defence and where they were the strongest. Initially the Germans were successful and they managed to take Damelevières and Gerbeviller and then pushed the French from Vacquenatwood, Clairlieu and Censal from where they move towards Bayon. At this point however, the French started to check the German advance, the French 74th Infantry in particular fighting with great tenacity and at the same time the Bavarians attacking the Flainval plateau were also checked by the French. Now in a desperate effort to force through the gap, the German 6th Army effectively weakened their right and left flanks which Castelnau saw and decided to use to his advantage. He attacked the German flanks with General Fayolle's 70th French Infantry and they were pushed out of Erbeviller, Réméréville and Courbesseaux. Now the right wing of the French 2nd Army attack Rupprecht's left flank and managed to take Saint-Boingt, Essey-la-Côte and Clézentaine Ménarmont.\n\nDuring the night of 24 to 25 August Castelnau pounded the Germans with his artillery. Now Castelnau concentrated on Rupprecht's centre and launched an attack to take Rozelieures from the Germans. He was successful but the Germans hit back and retook Rozelieures but later in the day of the 25th the French took it back. Rozelieures was theirs!\n\nOn the 25th and 26th fighting was fierce in every area but finally Rupprecht ordered a retreat.\n\nThe battle of Charmes was a victory for the French 2nd Army and in stopping the Germans from passing through the \"Trouée de Charmes\" Castelnau had arguably saved the French from a complete disaster. To quote Maurice Barrès- \n\nThe Trouée de Charmes was a gap in the French defensive lines north-east of the town of Charmes. There were many fortresses around Toul and Epinal in the Vosges. But around Lunéville, in the rather open landscape of plains and hills, there was only one fortress, the Fort de Manonviller. In this open country there are three natural obstacles, being the rivers Moselle, Vezouze and Meurthe. These last two rivers link together directly west of the city of Lunéville.\nAny German Army which could break through the Gap of Charmes, would have been awarded with the advantage of three options to facilitate the continuation of its campaign on more accessible terrain: 1. Go right and attack Nancy and Toul, or 2. Go left, and attack St. Dié and Epinal, or 3. Advance directly to the Champagne. Another reason why this weak link in the French defensive line was called the Gap, was the fact that the French 2nd Army linked up here with the 1st Army. During the period of 20–23 August the flanks of these armies almost lost contact. During the Battle of the Trouée des Charmes from 24 until 26 August 1914, it took the French 2nd Army much effort to withstand the German attacks. It even needed the assistance of the 8e Corps d'Armée of Dubail's 1st Army.\nNow the two sides regrouped and on 4 September clashed again in the \"Battle of the Grand Couronné\" which was to last until 13 September. After that encounter the front line in Lorraine would not change for the next four years.\n\nThe fighting here was also part of the \"Battles of the Frontiers\" and took place from 4 to 13 September 1914, the 6th German Army under Prince Rupprecht of Bavaria being pitted against the 2nd French Army under General Castelnau.\n\nThe French retreat after the fighting at Morhange and Saarbourg saw them eventually take up position on the Grand Couronné, an area of high ground to the east of Nancy, on an arc Pont-à-Mousson, Champenoux, Lunéville and Dombasie, Grand Couronné consists of a series of high ridges which dominates the plain to the east of Nancy. These ridges are La côte Sainte-Geneviève with a height of 394 metres, Le Mont Toulon with a height of 375 metres, Le Mont Saint-Jean with a height of 400 metres, the plateau of the Bois du Chapitre with a height of 400 metres, the plateau of the Bois de Faulx with the spur of La Rochette with a height of 406 metres and finally the plateau of Malzéville and the ridge called \"Le Rembêtant\". These ridges dominated the plain and allowed excellent observation of it.\n\nAfter the Battle at the Trouée de Charmes, the German's first attempt to pierce the French line at the point where the 1st Army joined the 2nd Army, the Germans decided to attack simultaneously Saint-Dié in the Battle of the Haute Meurthe and Nancy in the battle of the Grand Couronné. The fighting at Haute Meurthe will be covered when we look at the war in the Alsace area.\n\nThe fighting at Charmes had been inconclusive and the capture of Nancy now became psychologically important for the Germans and the Kaiser came along to personally supervise the attacks and the French were not helped when Castelnau had to let men go to bolster the 3rd Army who were experiencing difficulties in the west.\n\nThe battle opened on 4 September when the German guns opened up destroying a number of villages in the area but from the 5th to the 11th, despite heavy losses, neither side were able to take the upper hand. On 9 and 10 September the German guns opened fire on Nancy. By 12 September the Germans began to retreat and on the next day withdrew from Pont à Mousson and Lunéville which were then reoccupied by the French. The French then continued to the banks of the River Seille where the front line stabilised and did not change until 1918.\n\nIt could be argued that the Grand Couronné and the fighting at the Haute Meurthe encounter helped the allies in their success at the 1st Battle of the Marne in that they kept important numbers of German troops in Lorraine. On 18 September 1914, Castelnau was made a \"Grand-Officier de la légion d'honneur\" and was to appear on postcards of the time under the title \"The saviour of Nancy\".\n\nThe battlefield lies north-east of Nancy, east of Pont-à-Mousson, and south-east of Metz. The area includes Freméry, Riche, Chicourt,Brehain, Conthil, Lidrezing, Cutting,Dieuze, Bidestroff and Vergaville.\n\nNancy was never occupied by the German army in the 1914-1918 war but was in the sights of their artillery and was constantly shelled.\n\nAfter the defeats at the Battles of Lorraine and Sarrebourg, the 1st French Army retreated to the banks of the River Meurthe where they were involved in a series of encounters with the Germans in what is called the Battle of Haut-Meurthe which ran from 23 August to 10 September. There was fighting in front of Rambervillers on the Chipotte mountain and Saint-Barbe, at Saint-Dié, Mandray, the Anozel mountain and at Taintrux and Nompatelize.\n\nThese encounters were all of a defensive nature but after 11 September they became of an offensive nature with the 13th, 21st and 14th Army Corps and the \"Vosges Army Group\" playing important roles and in this area between Nancy and the Hautes Vosges the front line was defined and changed little until the end of the war in 1918 but saw fierce exchanges between the two sides trench to trench.\n\nSenones lies north of Saint-Dié-des-Vosges and east of Raon-l'Étape.\n\nThere is a German War cemetery or Kriegsgräberstatte at Senones which contains 1,528 German burials. Of the 1,528 soldiers 784 are buried in a grave, and 22 individual soldiers of them are unknown. The mass grave contains the remains of 744 killed soldiers, only 348 of them are known by their name. The \"Schlacht in Lothringen\" or the \"Battle of Lorraine\" from 25 to 28 August 1914, the defensive fighting in the winter 1914-1915, the trench warfare of 1915, and the war in late 1918 increased the number of dead in this sector of the front. Soldiers, buried here, came from garrisons in Bavaria, Baden, Hessen, Hanover, Brunswick, Ostfriesland, Wurttemberg, Westphalia, Thuringia, Brandenburg, Silesia and the Rhineland. On 25 August 1914, the Germans entered Senones on their march on St. Dié des Vosges and after the battle at la Chipotte and on 12 September 1914, units of the 30th Bavarian Reserve Division passing the defenceless town of Senones while retreating to return in the evening to occupy the town.\n\nThere is also a French War cemetery at Senones which contains the graves of 795 French Soldiers, including colonial soldiers. 372 of these soldiers are buried in 2 ossuaries. There are also 6 Poles, 11 Roumanians and 6 Russians buried in the cemetery. Soldiers buried here were brought in from the battlefields in the area around Bois du Palon, Bois \"Y\", la Scierie de Malfosse, la Chapelle de la Halte, the nearby Mère Henry and the Haute-Forain.\n\nThe outcome of the battles in Lorraine and Alsace in 1914 effectively meant that the French plan XVII had failed and during the same period, and under tremendous pressure from the German armies advancing in the north, the French and British armies had begun the Great Retreat to the Marne River, pivoting on the fortress of Verdun. So serious did he perceive the situation that Sir John French favoured withdrawing the BEF to the coast of the English Channel from where it could be evacuated, as he judged the BEF to be vulnerable and exposed but the British Secretary of State for War, Lord Kitchener, who ironically had never been in favour of the BEF's role alongside the French army, now insisted they stay side by side with the French.\n\nThe German Von Schlieffen Plan was now starting to show cracks and Moltke was too prone to wavering and lacked the firm hand that was required. The German right wing had been weakened by the need to shift men and resources to bolster the offensive in East Prussia and to hold ground in Lorraine and Von Kluck's decision to take his First Army east of the French capital rather than keeping to the west of Paris, as Von Schlieffen had insisted should happen, had exposed his right flank which the Allies exploited in the First Battle of the Marne in early September, enabling the German advance to be halted.\n\nThe French no longer saw themselves achieving a swift, decisive victory and their priority now was to avoid defeat. Joffre, blamed the failure of Plan XVII squarely on the shoulders of his subordinates, claiming defeat stemmed from \"grave shortcomings on the part of commanders.\" and many were sacked and even Lanrezac failed to escape Joffre's axe and was retired.\n\n"}

{"id": "20232", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20232", "title": "Messenger RNA", "text": "Messenger RNA\n\nMessenger RNA (mRNA) is a large family of RNA molecules that convey genetic information from DNA to the ribosome, where they specify the amino acid sequence of the protein products of gene expression. RNA polymerase transcribes primary transcript mRNA (known as pre-mRNA) into processed, mature mRNA. This mature mRNA is then translated into a polymer of amino acids: a protein, as summarized in the central dogma of molecular biology.\n\nAs in DNA, mRNA genetic information is in the sequence of nucleotides, which are arranged into codons consisting of three base pairs each. Each codon encodes for a specific amino acid, except the stop codons, which terminate protein synthesis. This process of translation of codons into amino acids requires two other types of RNA: Transfer RNA (tRNA), that mediates recognition of the codon and provides the corresponding amino acid, and ribosomal RNA (rRNA), that is the central component of the ribosome's protein-manufacturing machinery.\n\nThe existence of mRNA was first suggested by Jacques Monod and François Jacob, and subsequently discovered by Jacob, Sydney Brenner and Matthew Meselson at the California Institute of Technology in 1961.\n\nIt should not be confused with mitochondrial DNA.\n\nThe brief existence of an mRNA molecule begins with transcription, and ultimately ends in degradation. During its life, an mRNA molecule may also be processed, edited, and transported prior to translation. Eukaryotic mRNA molecules often require extensive processing and transport, while prokaryotic mRNA molecules do not. A molecule of eukaryotic mRNA and the proteins surrounding it are together called a messenger RNP.\n\nTranscription is when RNA is made from DNA. During transcription, RNA polymerase makes a copy of a gene from the DNA to mRNA as needed. This process is similar in eukaryotes and prokaryotes. One notable difference, however, is that eukaryotic RNA polymerase associates with mRNA-processing enzymes during transcription so that processing can proceed quickly after the start of transcription. The short-lived, unprocessed or partially processed product is termed \"precursor mRNA\", or \"pre-mRNA\"; once completely processed, it is termed \"mature mRNA\".\n\nProcessing of mRNA differs greatly among eukaryotes, bacteria, and archea. Non-eukaryotic mRNA is, in essence, mature upon transcription and requires no processing, except in rare cases. Eukaryotic pre-mRNA, however, requires extensive processing.\n\nA \"5' cap\" (also termed an RNA cap, an RNA 7-methylguanosine cap, or an RNA mG cap) is a modified guanine nucleotide that has been added to the \"front\" or 5' end of a eukaryotic messenger RNA shortly after the start of transcription. The 5' cap consists of a terminal 7-methylguanosine residue that is linked through a 5'-5'-triphosphate bond to the first transcribed nucleotide. Its presence is critical for recognition by the ribosome and protection from RNases.\n\nCap addition is coupled to transcription, and occurs co-transcriptionally, such that each influences the other. Shortly after the start of transcription, the 5' end of the mRNA being synthesized is bound by a cap-synthesizing complex associated with RNA polymerase. This enzymatic complex catalyzes the chemical reactions that are required for mRNA capping. Synthesis proceeds as a multi-step biochemical reaction.\n\nIn some instances, an mRNA will be edited, changing the nucleotide composition of that mRNA. An example in humans is the apolipoprotein B mRNA, which is edited in some tissues, but not others. The editing creates an early stop codon, which, upon translation, produces a shorter protein.\n\nPolyadenylation is the covalent linkage of a polyadenylyl moiety to a messenger RNA molecule. In eukaryotic organisms most messenger RNA (mRNA) molecules are polyadenylated at the 3' end, but recent studies have shown that short stretches of uridine (oligouridylation) are also common. The poly(A) tail and the protein bound to it aid in protecting mRNA from degradation by exonucleases. Polyadenylation is also important for transcription termination, export of the mRNA from the nucleus, and translation. mRNA can also be polyadenylated in prokaryotic organisms, where poly(A) tails act to facilitate, rather than impede, exonucleolytic degradation.\n\nPolyadenylation occurs during and/or immediately after transcription of DNA into RNA. After transcription has been terminated, the mRNA chain is cleaved through the action of an endonuclease complex associated with RNA polymerase. After the mRNA has been cleaved, around 250 adenosine residues are added to the free 3' end at the cleavage site. This reaction is catalyzed by polyadenylate polymerase. Just as in alternative splicing, there can be more than one polyadenylation variant of an mRNA.\n\nPolyadenylation site mutations also occur. The primary RNA transcript of a gene is cleaved at the poly-A addition site, and 100-200 A's are added to the 3’ end of the RNA. If this site is altered, an abnormally long and unstable mRNA construct will be formed.\n\nAnother difference between eukaryotes and prokaryotes is mRNA transport. Because eukaryotic transcription and translation is compartmentally separated, eukaryotic mRNAs must be exported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm—a process that may be regulated by different signaling pathways. Mature mRNAs are recognized by their processed modifications and then exported through the nuclear pore by binding to the cap-binding proteins CBP20 and CBP80, as well as the transcription/export complex (TREX). Multiple mRNA export pathways have been identified in eukaryotes.\n\nIn spatially complex cells, some mRNAs are transported to particular subcellar destinations. In mature neurons, certain mRNA are transported from the soma to dendrites. One site of mRNA translation is at polyribosomes selectively localized beneath synapses. The mRNA for Arc/Arg3.1 is induced by synaptic activity and localizes selectively near active synapses based on signals generated by NMDA receptors. Other mRNAs also move into dendrites in response to external stimuli, such as β-actin mRNA. Upon export from the nucleus, actin mRNA associates with ZBP1 and the 40S subunit. The complex is bound by a motor protein and is transported to the target location (neurite extension) along the cytoskeleton. Eventually ZBP1 is phosphorylated by Src in order for translation to be initiated. In developing neurons, mRNAs are also transported into growing axons and especially growth cones. Many mRNAs are marked with so-called \"zip codes,\" which target their transport to a specific location.\n\nBecause prokaryotic mRNA does not need to be processed or transported, translation by the ribosome can begin immediately after the end of transcription. Therefore, it can be said that prokaryotic translation is \"coupled\" to transcription and occurs \"co-transcriptionally\".\n\nEukaryotic mRNA that has been processed and transported to the cytoplasm (i.e., mature mRNA) can then be translated by the ribosome. Translation may occur at ribosomes free-floating in the cytoplasm, or directed to the endoplasmic reticulum by the signal recognition particle. Therefore, unlike in prokaryotes, eukaryotic translation \"is not\" directly coupled to transcription. It is even possible in some contexts that reduced mRNA levels are accompanied by increased protein levels, as has been observed for mRNA/protein levels of EEF1A1 in breast cancer.\n\nCoding regions are composed of codons, which are decoded and translated (in eukaryotes usually into one and in prokaryotes usually into several) into proteins by the ribosome. Coding regions begin with the start codon and end with a stop codon. In general, the start codon is an AUG triplet and the stop codon is UAA, UAG, or UGA. The coding regions tend to be stabilised by internal base pairs, this impedes degradation. In addition to being protein-coding, portions of coding regions may serve as regulatory sequences in the pre-mRNA as exonic splicing enhancers or exonic splicing silencers.\n\nUntranslated regions (UTRs) are sections of the mRNA before the start codon and after the stop codon that are not translated, termed the five prime untranslated region (5' UTR) and three prime untranslated region (3' UTR), respectively. These regions are transcribed with the coding region and thus are exonic as they are present in the mature mRNA. Several roles in gene expression have been attributed to the untranslated regions, including mRNA stability, mRNA localization, and translational efficiency. The ability of a UTR to perform these functions depends on the sequence of the UTR and can differ between mRNAs. Genetic variants in 3' UTR have also been implicated in disease susceptibility because of the change in RNA structure and protein translation.\n\nThe stability of mRNAs may be controlled by the 5' UTR and/or 3' UTR due to varying affinity for RNA degrading enzymes called ribonucleases and for ancillary proteins that can promote or inhibit RNA degradation. (See also, C-rich stability element.)\n\nTranslational efficiency, including sometimes the complete inhibition of translation, can be controlled by UTRs. Proteins that bind to either the 3' or 5' UTR may affect translation by influencing the ribosome's ability to bind to the mRNA. MicroRNAs bound to the 3' UTR also may affect translational efficiency or mRNA stability.\n\nCytoplasmic localization of mRNA is thought to be a function of the 3' UTR. Proteins that are needed in a particular region of the cell can also be translated there; in such a case, the 3' UTR may contain sequences that allow the transcript to be localized to this region for translation.\n\nSome of the elements contained in untranslated regions form a characteristic secondary structure when transcribed into RNA. These structural mRNA elements are involved in regulating the mRNA. Some, such as the SECIS element, are targets for proteins to bind. One class of mRNA element, the riboswitches, directly bind small molecules, changing their fold to modify levels of transcription or translation. In these cases, the mRNA regulates itself.\n\nThe 3' poly(A) tail is a long sequence of adenine nucleotides (often several hundred) added to the 3' end of the pre-mRNA. This tail promotes export from the nucleus and translation, and protects the mRNA from degradation.\n\nAn mRNA molecule is said to be monocistronic when it contains the genetic information to translate only a single protein chain (polypeptide). This is the case for most of the eukaryotic mRNAs. On the other hand, polycistronic mRNA carries several open reading frames (ORFs), each of which is translated into a polypeptide. These polypeptides usually have a related function (they often are the subunits composing a final complex protein) and their coding sequence is grouped and regulated together in a regulatory region, containing a promoter and an operator. Most of the mRNA found in bacteria and archaea is polycistronic, as is the human mitochondrial genome. Dicistronic or bicistronic mRNA encodes only two proteins.\n\nIn eukaryotes mRNA molecules form circular structures due to an interaction between the eIF4E and poly(A)-binding protein, which both bind to eIF4G, forming an mRNA-protein-mRNA bridge. Circularization is thought to promote cycling of ribosomes on the mRNA leading to time-efficient translation, and may also function to ensure only intact mRNA are translated (partially degraded mRNA characteristically have no m7G cap, or no poly-A tail).\n\nOther mechanisms for circularization exist, particularly in virus mRNA. Poliovirus mRNA uses a cloverleaf section towards its 5' end to bind PCBP2, which binds poly(A)-binding protein, forming the familiar mRNA-protein-mRNA circle. Barley yellow dwarf virus has binding between mRNA segments on its 5' end and 3' end (called kissing stem loops), circularizing the mRNA without any proteins involved.\n\nRNA virus genomes (the + strands of which are translated as mRNA) are also commonly circularized. During genome replication the circularization acts to enhance genome replication speeds, cycling viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase much the same as the ribosome is hypothesized to cycle.\n\nDifferent mRNAs within the same cell have distinct lifetimes (stabilities). In bacterial cells, individual mRNAs can survive from seconds to more than an hour. However, the lifetime averages between 1 and 3 minutes, making bacterial mRNA much less stable than eukaryotic mRNA. In mammalian cells, mRNA lifetimes range from several minutes to days. The greater the stability of an mRNA the more protein may be produced from that mRNA. The limited lifetime of mRNA enables a cell to alter protein synthesis rapidly in response to its changing needs. There are many mechanisms that lead to the destruction of an mRNA, some of which are described below.\n\nIn general, in prokaryotes the lifetime of mRNA is much shorter than in eukaryotes. Prokaryotes degrade messages by using a combination of ribonucleases, including endonucleases, 3' exonucleases, and 5' exonucleases. In some instances, small RNA molecules (sRNA) tens to hundreds of nucleotides long can stimulate the degradation of specific mRNAs by base-pairing with complementary sequences and facilitating ribonuclease cleavage by RNase III. It was recently shown that bacteria also have a sort of 5' cap consisting of a triphosphate on the 5' end. Removal of two of the phosphates leaves a 5' monophosphate, causing the message to be destroyed by the exonuclease RNase J, which degrades 5' to 3'.\n\nInside eukaryotic cells, there is a balance between the processes of translation and mRNA decay. Messages that are being actively translated are bound by ribosomes, the eukaryotic initiation factors eIF-4E and eIF-4G, and poly(A)-binding protein. eIF-4E and eIF-4G block the decapping enzyme (DCP2), and poly(A)-binding protein blocks the exosome complex, protecting the ends of the message. The balance between translation and decay is reflected in the size and abundance of cytoplasmic structures known as P-bodies The poly(A) tail of the mRNA is shortened by specialized exonucleases that are targeted to specific messenger RNAs by a combination of cis-regulatory sequences on the RNA and trans-acting RNA-binding proteins. Poly(A) tail removal is thought to disrupt the circular structure of the message and destabilize the cap binding complex. The message is then subject to degradation by either the exosome complex or the decapping complex. In this way, translationally inactive messages can be destroyed quickly, while active messages remain intact. The mechanism by which translation stops and the message is handed-off to decay complexes is not understood in detail.\n\nThe presence of AU-rich elements in some mammalian mRNAs tends to destabilize those transcripts through the action of cellular proteins that bind these sequences and stimulate poly(A) tail removal. Loss of the poly(A) tail is thought to promote mRNA degradation by facilitating attack by both the exosome complex and the decapping complex. Rapid mRNA degradation via AU-rich elements is a critical mechanism for preventing the overproduction of potent cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF). AU-rich elements also regulate the biosynthesis of proto-oncogenic transcription factors like c-Jun and c-Fos.\n\nEukaryotic messages are subject to surveillance by nonsense mediated decay (NMD), which checks for the presence of premature stop codons (nonsense codons) in the message. These can arise via incomplete splicing, V(D)J recombination in the adaptive immune system, mutations in DNA, transcription errors, leaky scanning by the ribosome causing a frame shift, and other causes. Detection of a premature stop codon triggers mRNA degradation by 5' decapping, 3' poly(A) tail removal, or endonucleolytic cleavage.\n\nIn metazoans, small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) processed by Dicer are incorporated into a complex known as the RNA-induced silencing complex or RISC. This complex contains an endonuclease that cleaves perfectly complementary messages to which the siRNA binds. The resulting mRNA fragments are then destroyed by exonucleases. siRNA is commonly used in laboratories to block the function of genes in cell culture. It is thought to be part of the innate immune system as a defense against double-stranded RNA viruses.\n\nMicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small RNAs that typically are partially complementary to sequences in metazoan messenger RNAs. Binding of a miRNA to a message can repress translation of that message and accelerate poly(A) tail removal, thereby hastening mRNA degradation. The mechanism of action of miRNAs is the subject of active research.\n\nThere are other ways by which messages can be degraded, including non-stop decay and silencing by Piwi-interacting RNA (piRNA), among others.\n\nFull length mRNA molecules have been proposed as therapeutics since the beginning of the biotech era but there was little traction until the 2010s, when Moderna Therapeutics was founded and managed to raise almost a billion dollars in venture funding in its first three years.\n\nTheoretically, the administered mRNA sequence can cause a cell to make a protein, which in turn could directly treat a disease or could function as a vaccine; more indirectly the protein could drive an endogenous stem cell to differentiate in a desired way.\n\nThe primary challenges of RNA therapy center on delivering the RNA to directed cells, more even than determining what sequence to deliver. Naked RNA sequences will naturally degrade after preparation; they may trigger the body's immune system to attack them as an invader; and they are impermeable to the cell membrane. Once within the cell, they must then leave the cell's transport mechanism to take action within the cytoplasm, which houses the ribosomes that direct manufacture of proteins.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "617683", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=617683", "title": "Murder of Victoria Climbié", "text": "Murder of Victoria Climbié\n\nIn 2000 in London, an eight-year-old Ivorian girl, Victoria Adjo Climbié (2 November 1991 – 25 February 2000), was tortured and murdered by her guardians. Her death led to a public inquiry and produced major changes in child protection policies in the United Kingdom.\n\nBorn in Abobo, Côte d’Ivoire, Climbié left the country with her great-aunt Marie-Thérèse Kouao, a French citizen, for an education in France, where they travelled, before arriving in London in April 1999. It is not known exactly when Kouao started abusing Climbié, although it is suspected to have worsened when Kouao and Climbié met and moved in with Carl Manning, who became Kouao's boyfriend. During the abuse, Climbié was burnt with cigarettes, tied up for periods of longer than 24 hours, and hit with bike chains, hammers and wires. Up to her death, the police, the social services department of four local authorities, the National Health Service, the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (NSPCC), and local churches all had contact with her, and noted the signs of abuse. However, in what the judge in the trial following Climbié's death described as \"blinding incompetence\", all failed to properly investigate the case and little action was taken. Kouao and Manning were convicted of murder and sentenced to life imprisonment.\n\nAfter Climbié's death, the parties involved in her case were widely criticised. A public inquiry, headed by Lord Laming, was ordered. It discovered numerous instances where Climbié could have been saved, noted that many of the organisations involved in her care were badly run, and discussed the racial aspects surrounding the case, as many of the participants were black. The subsequent report by Laming made numerous recommendations related to child protection in England. Climbié's death was largely responsible for the formation of the Every Child Matters initiative; the introduction of the Children Act 2004; the creation of the ContactPoint project, a government database designed to hold information on all children in England (now defunct after closure by the government of 2010); and the creation of the Office of the Children's Commissioner chaired by the Children's Commissioner for England.\n\nVictoria Climbié was born on 2 November 1991 in Abobo near Abidjan, Ivory Coast, the fifth of seven children. Her parents were Francis Climbié and his wife Berthe Amoissi. Marie-Thérèse Kouao, Francis' aunt, was born on 17 July 1956 in Bonoua, Ivory Coast, and lived in France with her three sons, claiming welfare benefits. She divorced her former husband in 1978 and he died in 1995. Kouao was attending her brother's funeral in the Ivory Coast when she visited the Climbié family in October 1998. She informed them that she wanted to take a child back to France with her and arrange for their education; this sort of informal fosterage is common in the family's society. Victoria Climbié was apparently happy to be chosen, and although her parents had met Kouao only a few times, they were satisfied with the arrangements.\n\nFrom that point onwards, Kouao pretended that Climbié was her daughter. Kouao had originally planned to take another young girl called Anna Kouao, but Anna's parents changed their minds. Climbié travelled on a French passport in the name of Anna Kouao and was known as Anna throughout her life in the United Kingdom. It is not known exactly when Kouao started abusing Climbié. Climbié's parents received three messages about her from when she left them until her death, all saying she was in good health.\n\nKouao and Climbié left the Ivory Coast possibly in November 1998 and flew to Paris, France, where Climbié enrolled at school. By December 1998, however, Kouao began to receive warnings about Climbié's absenteeism, and in February 1999, the school issued a child-at-risk notification and a social worker became involved. The school observed how Climbié tended to fall asleep in class, and the headteacher later recalled Kouao's mentioning Climbié suffering from some form of dermatological condition and that, on her last visit to the school on 25 March 1999, Climbié had a shaven head and was wearing a wig. When they left France, Kouao owed the authorities £2,000, after being wrongly paid in child benefit, and it is claimed that Kouao viewed Climbié as a useful tool for claiming benefits. Kouao had also been evicted from her home in France because of rent arrears.\n\nOn 24 April 1999, Kouao and Victoria Climbié left France and travelled to the United Kingdom, where they settled in Ealing, West London. They had a reservation in a bed and breakfast at Twyford Crescent, Acton, where they lived until 1 May 1999, when they moved to Nicoll Road, Harlesden, in the London Borough of Brent. On 25 April 1999, Kouao and Climbié visited Esther Ackah, a distant relative of Kouao by marriage, and a midwife, counsellor and preacher. Ackah and her daughter noted that Climbié was wearing a wig and looked small and frail. On 26 April 1999, Kouao and Climbié visited the Homeless Persons' Unit of Ealing Council, where they were seen by Julie Winter, a homeless persons' officer. Together, Kouao and Winter completed a housing application form. Kouao explained that Climbié was wearing a wig because she had short hair, an explanation accepted by Winter. Although Winter was shown Climbié's passport (with a photograph of Anna), she paid no attention to them, believing that Kouao's application was ineligible on the grounds of habitual residence. Winter confirmed her decision with her duty senior and told Kouao that she was not eligible for housing. She telephoned the referral across to Pamela Fortune, a social worker in Ealing's Acton referral and assessment team. She did not produce a written or electronic documentation of the referral, however, something which would have helped in double-checking the accounts that Kouao gave.\n\nBetween 26 April and early July 1999, Kouao visited Ealing social services 18 times for housing and financial purposes. Climbié was with her on at least ten occasions. The staff there noted Victoria's unkempt appearance, with one staff member, Deborah Gaunt, thinking that she looked like a child from an ActionAid advertisement. However, they did not take any action and may have assumed that Victoria's appearance was a purposeful attempt to \"persuade the authorities to hand out money\". On 8 June 1999, Kouao got a job at Northwick Park Hospital. During her first month, no effort was made by Kouao or Ealing social services to enroll Climbié in educational or daycare activities.\n\nOn 8 June 1999, Kouao took Climbié to a local GP surgery. The practice nurse there did not carry out a physical examination as she was not reported to have any current health problems. By the middle of June 1999, Victoria was spending the majority of her days at the Brent home of Priscilla Cameron, an unregistered childminder, who Kouao met at her job at the hospital. There is no evidence that Climbié was treated badly during her time with Cameron. On several occasions, Cameron observed small cuts to Climbié's fingers. When questioned by Cameron, Kouao said that they were caused by razor blades that Climbié played with. Kouao and Victoria met Ackah on the street on or around 14 June 1999. In what may have been early signs of deliberate physical harm, Ackah noted a scar on Climbié's cheek, which Kouao said was caused by a fall on an escalator. On 17 June 1999, in response to what she had seen three days earlier, Ackah visited Kouao and Climbié's home, and thought that the accommodation was unsuitable.\n\nOn 18 June 1999, Ackah anonymously telephoned Brent social services, expressing concern over Climbié's situation. Samantha Hunt, the customer-service officer who received the call at the One Stop Shop at Brent House, faxed the referral to the children's social work department on that same day. Nobody picked up the referral on that Friday afternoon, and what happened to it was—according to Lord Laming, who headed the subsequent inquiry—the subject of \"some of the most bizarre and contradictory evidence\" the inquiry heard. A few days later, possibly on 21 June 1999, Ackah phoned Brent social services again to make sure her concerns were being addressed. Ackah said that she was told by the person on the other end of the telephone that \"probably they [social services] had done something about it\". This call, however, did not trigger a new, separate referral. \n\nThe first referral was not seen until three weeks later on 6 July 1999, when Robert Smith, the group administrative officer, logged the details of the referral onto the computer, with details of Climbié's injuries. Laming said the delay constituted \"a significant missed opportunity\" to protect Climbié. Edward Armstrong, the team manager of the intake duty team, said that he completed a duty manager's action sheet not for the 18 June referral, which he said never arrived in his office, but for the 21 June referral, which was a less serious case than the first; Laming called this version of events \"wholly unbelievable\". Laming said that Armstrong's evidence was out of line with that of the other Brent witnesses, that the quality of it \"[left] much to be desired\", and that Armstrong's insistence that he dealt with the 21 June referral was an attempt to cover up his team's \"inept handling\" of a genuine child protection case.\n\nOn 14 June 1999, Kouao and Climbié met Carl Manning (born 31 October 1972) on a bus which he was driving. This was the start of Kouao and Manning's relationship which ended at the time of their arrest eight months later. She was his first girlfriend. The relationship developed quickly and on 6 July 1999, Kouao and Climbié moved into Manning's one-bedroom flat at Somerset Gardens in Tottenham, in the London Borough of Haringey. There is evidence that Climbié's abuse increased soon after moving into Manning's flat.\n\nOn 7 July 1999, Brent social services sent a letter to Nicoll Road, where Kouao and Climbié were staying, informing them of a home visit. On 14 July 1999, two social workers, Lori Hobbs and Monica Bridgeman, visited the address but found no answer: Kouao and Climbié had already moved out on 6 July 1999. Hobbs and Bridgeman made no further inquiries at the property, inquiries that might have led to a trail on Climbié's whereabouts. Prior to the visit, they had not done any background checks and had only the \"haziest idea\" of what they were investigating. The Laming report suggests that no reports or follow-up notes were made and that the only information additional to the referral were the notes \"Not at this address. Have moved.\"\n\nOn 13 July 1999, Kouao took Climbié to Cameron's house, asking her to take Climbié permanently because Manning did not want her. Cameron refused but agreed to take her for the night. Cameron, her son Patrick, and her daughter Avril, observed that Climbié had numerous injuries—including a burn on her face and a loose piece of skin hanging from her right eyelid—which Kouao said was self-inflicted. Manning's account in the subsequent inquiry differed and he said that he hit Climbié because of her incontinence, beginning with slaps, but progressing to using his fist by the end of July. It was highly likely that at least some of the injuries were the result of deliberate physical harm.\n\nThe next day, on 14 July 1999, Cameron's daughter Avril took Climbié to see Marie Cader, a French teacher at her son's school. Cader advised that Climbié be taken to hospital. At 11:00 am the same day, Avril took Climbié to the emergency department of Central Middlesex Hospital. At 11:50 am, Climbié was seen by Dr Rhys Beynon, a senior house officer in the department. Beynon took Climbié's history from Avril and thought that there was a strong possibility that the injuries were non-accidental. Due to hospital child protection guidelines, he referred the case to Dr Ekundayo Ajayi-Obe, the on-call paediatric registrar. Beynon conducted only a cursory examination of Climbié because he believed she was going to be examined by the paediatric team. The Laming report said that \"he exhibited sound judgement in his care of Victoria by referring her immediately to a paediatric registrar.\" Climbié arrived at Barnaby Bear ward where she was examined by Ajayi-Obe, who noted various injuries. When asked about the injuries, Climbié said they were self-inflicted, a claim the paediatrician did not think was credible. Ajayi-Obe's notes were detailed and thorough, in contrast to those of the other doctors that examined her. Having examined Climbié, the paediatrician was \"strongly suspicious\" that the injuries were non-accidental, and she decided to admit Climbié onto the ward.\n\nThe doctors alerted Brent police and social services, and she was placed under police protection, with a 72-hour protection order preventing her from leaving hospital. Kouao told the doctors that she had scabies, and that the injuries were self-inflicted. Many doctors and nurses suspected that the injuries were non-accidental. However, Ruby Schwartz, the consultant paediatrician and named child protection doctor at the hospital, diagnosed scabies and decided that it was scratching that caused the injuries. She made the diagnosis without speaking to Climbié alone. Schwartz later admitted that she made a mistake. Another doctor, one of Schwartz's juniors, misleadingly wrote to social services saying there was no child protection issue. When Michelle Hine, a child protection officer at Brent council, received a report notifying her of Climbié's injuries, she planned to open an investigation into the case. However, the next day she heard of Schwartz's diagnosis and downgraded Climbié's level of care, trusting Schwartz's judgement. She later expressed regret over her actions. Schwartz said in the inquiry that she expected social services to follow up the case. Neil Garnham QC, counsel to the inquiry following Climbié's death, later said to her, \"there is a terrible danger here—is there not, doctor—of social services on the one hand and you on the other each expecting the other to do the investigation, with the result that nobody does\". The police officer allocated to Climbié's case for the Brent Child Protection team, Rachel Dewar, decided to lift the police protection, allowing Climbié to return home, when told by a social worker that she had scabies. Under the Children Act 1989, Dewar was obliged to see Climbié and tell her she was under police protection, but she did not do this. She also failed to see Kouao or Manning. At the time of the decision, Dewar was attending a seminar on child protection. Garnham later said, \"we will need to ask why it was thought more important for her to attend a seminar to learn how to deal with child protection cases than deal with the real child protection case for which she was responsible at the time\". Kouao took Climbié home on 15 July 1999.\n\nSome time in July, probably just before Climbié was admitted to the Central Middlesex Hospital, Kouao befriended a couple, Julien and Chantal Kimbidima. Climbié and Kouao visited their home several times over the following months. According to Chantal, Kouao would shout at Climbié all the time and never showed her affection.\n\nOn 24 July 1999, Climbié was taken by Kouao to the accident-and-emergency department at North Middlesex Hospital with severe scalding to her head and other injuries. The hospital found no evidence of scabies. Consultant Mary Rossiter felt Climbié was being abused but still wrote 'able to discharge' on her notes. According to Maureen Ann Meates, another doctor at the hospital, when Rossiter had written that note, she had noted that Climbié was exhibiting signs of neglect, emotional abuse and physical abuse. Later, in the inquiry, Rossiter said that by writing 'able to discharge', she did not mean she wanted Climbié to go home, merely that she was physically fit to leave. Garnham said, \"quite how the subtlety of that distinction was to be ascertained from the notes is far from obvious\". Rossiter admitted to the inquiry that she had expected police and social services to follow up on the case. For a brief period while Climbié was in hospital, Enfield social services took up the case before passing it to Haringey.\n\nA social worker and a police officer from Haringey council, Lisa Arthurworrey and Karen Jones, respectively, were assigned to her case, and were scheduled to make a home visit on 4 August 1999; however, the visit was cancelled once they heard about the scabies. Jones later said, \"it might not be logical but I did not know anything about scabies.\" She said that she telephoned North Middlesex Hospital for information about the disease, but Garnham had evidence that the staff there dealt with no such inquiry. Jones was told by a doctor that Climbié's injuries were consistent with belt buckle marks, although she claimed in the inquiry there was no evidence of child abuse.\n\nOn 5 August 1999, a Haringey social worker, Barry Almeida, took Climbié to an NSPCC centre in Tottenham, where she was assigned to Sylvia Henry. There was some confusion as to why the centre was being referred to for the case. Henry later contacted Almeida and was told, according to Henry, that Climbié had moved out of the borough, thereby closing the case. Almeida said he could not remember whether this conversation did take place. On the same day, Kouao met Arthurworrey and Jones at the Haringey social services department, and claimed that Climbié had poured boiling water over herself to stop the itching caused by the scabies and that she had used utensils to cause the other injuries. The social worker and police officer believed her, deciding that the injuries were probably accidental, and allowed Climbié to return home the following day, which she did.\n\nOn 7 August 1999, Kouao visited Ealing social services; they said it was a housing issue and that the case was closed. Ealing social services would later be described as 'chaotic'. As a follow-up measure, a staff member at the hospital contacted a health visitor, but the health visitor said in the inquiry that she did not receive any contact. On 13 August 1999, Rossiter wrote to Petra Kitchman of Brent council, asking her to follow up on the Climbié case. Kitchman said in the inquiry that she contacted Arthurworrey, but Arthurworrey denied this. Later, on 2 September 1999, Rossiter sent a second letter. Kitchman said she spoke to Arthurworrey about this, but Arthurworrey denied this again. Arthurworrey made a visit to Climbié's home on 16 August 1999 and another one when Manning began forcing Climbié to sleep in the bathtub. Arthurworrey said in the inquiry that she was under the impression that Climbié seemed happy, but Garnham criticised Arthurworrey for not detecting any of the abuse, although Manning had described this visit as a \"put up job\". Arthurworrey and Climbié had met on four occasions, where they were together for a total of less than 30 minutes, barely speaking to each other.\n\nFrom then on, Kouao kept Climbié away from hospitals, turning instead to churches. Kouao said to the pastors that she was the mother and that demons were inside Climbié. The pastor at the Mission Ensemble Pour Christ, Pascal Orome, offered prayers for Climbié to cast out the devil, and thought that her injuries were due to demonic possession. On another occasion, Kouao took Climbié to a church run by the Universal Church of the Kingdom of God, where the pastor, Alvaro Lima, suspected she was being abused, although he took no action. He said in the inquiry that Climbié told him that Satan had told her to burn herself. The pastor did not believe her, but he still believed that a person could be possessed.\n\nFrom October 1999 to January 2000, Manning forced Climbié to sleep in a bin liner in the bathtub in her own excrement. During a later police interview, Manning said this was because of her frequent bedwetting. At Haringey social services on 1 November 1999, Kouao told social workers that Manning sexually assaulted Climbié, but withdrew the accusation the following day. In one of Arthurworrey's visits, during a conversation about housing, Arthurworrey said that the council accommodated only children who were believed to be at serious risk. Laming said in his report, \"it may be no coincidence that within three days of this conversation, Kouao contacted Ms. Arthurworrey to make allegations which, if true, would have placed Victoria squarely within that category\". Jones sent a letter to Kouao, which was ignored, and no further action was taken. Manning later denied the allegation. Alan Hodges, the police sergeant overseeing the investigation, claimed in the inquiry that the social workers were obstructing the police in dealing with child protection cases. Between December 1999 and January 2000, Arthurworrey made three visits to the flat, but she received no answer. She speculated to her supervisor, Carole Baptiste, that they had returned to France. Despite no evidence, her supervisor wrote on Climbié's file that they had left the area. On 18 February 2000 they wrote to Kouao saying that if they did not receive any contact from them, they would close the case. A week later, on 25 February 2000, they closed the case—on the same day that Climbié died.\n\nOn 24 February 2000, Victoria Climbié was taken semi-conscious and suffering from hypothermia, multiple organ failure and malnutrition, to the local Universal Church of the Kingdom of God. With the advice of the pastor, a mini-cab was called to send Climbié to the hospital. The mini cab driver was horrified at Climbié's condition and sent her to the nearby Tottenham Ambulance Station instead. Climbié was rushed straight to the accident-and-emergency department at North Middlesex Hospital; she was then transferred to the intensive-care unit at St Mary's Hospital. The ambulance crew who drove her to St Mary's described how although Kouao had kept saying, \"my baby, my baby\", her concern seemed \"not quite enough\", and that Manning seemed \"almost as if he was not there\". Climbié died the following day at 3:15 pm local time. The pathologist who examined her body noted 128 separate injuries and scars on her body, and described it as the worst case of child abuse she had ever seen; Climbié had been burnt with cigarettes, tied up for periods of longer than 24 hours, and hit with bike chains, hammers and wires. During her life in Britain, Climbié was known to four local authorities (four social services departments and three housing departments), two child protection police teams, two hospitals, an NSPCC centre, and a few local churches. She was buried in Grand-Bassam near her home town.\n\nKouao was arrested on the day that Climbié died, and Manning the following day. Kouao told police, \"It is terrible, I have just lost my child\". On 20 November 2000, at the Old Bailey, the trial into her death opened, where Kouao and Manning were charged with child cruelty and murder. Kouao denied all charges, and Manning pleaded guilty to charges of cruelty and manslaughter. The judge described the people in Climbié's case as \"blindingly incompetent\". In his diary, Manning described Climbié as Satan, and said that no matter how hard he hit her, she did not cry or show signs that she was hurt. On 12 January 2001, both were found guilty and sentenced to life imprisonment. The judge said to them, \"what Victoria endured was truly unimaginable. She died at both your hands, a lonely drawn out death\". Kouao went to Durham prison and Manning went to Wakefield prison.\n\nOn 20 April 2000, the health secretary, Alan Milburn, and the home secretary, Jack Straw, appointed William Laming, Lord Laming, former chief inspector of the Social Services Inspectorate (SSI), to conduct a statutory inquiry into Climbié's death. Laming was given the choice of staging a public inquiry or a private inquiry; he chose a public inquiry. It was the first inquiry to be set up by two secretaries of state. The inquiry was actually three separate inquiries, together called the Victoria Climbié Inquiry, as it had a statutory base of three pieces of legislation: section 81 of the Children Act 1989, section 84 of the National Health Service Act 1977, and section 49 of the Police Act 1996. It drew together the involvement of social services, the National Health Service, and the police, and became the first tripartite inquiry into child protection. The Counsel to the Inquiry was Neil Garnham QC. The inquiry, based in Hannibal House, Elephant and Castle, London, cost £3.8 million, making it the most expensive child protection investigation in British history. The website victoria-climbie-inquiry.org.uk was created, where all the evidence and documents were made available freely.\n\nThe inquiry was launched on 31 May 2001, and was split into two phases: phase one and phase two. Phase one investigated the involvement of people and agencies in Climbié's death, in the form of hearings. Two hundred and seventy witnesses were involved. The phase one hearings began on 26 September 2001 and finished on 31 July 2002; it was originally supposed to end on 4 February 2002 but late documents caused delays. Phase two of the inquiry, taking place between 15 March 2002 and 26 April 2002, took the form of five seminars, which looked at the child protection system in general. It was chaired by Garnham and brought together experts in all aspects of child protection.\n\nLaming's appointment was controversial as he had been director of Hertfordshire county council's social services department in 1990, a department which was strongly criticised for its handling of a child abuse case, and which had the Local Government Ombudsman making a finding of 'maladministration with injustice' against them in 1995. The father of the child in the case said of Laming's appointment, \"I don't see how he has the qualifications or experience to be able to lead an investigation into another borough which has been failing to protect a child in exactly the same manner that his own authority failed to protect a child in 1990\". Liberal Democrat spokesman Paul Burstow said, \"the findings of the ombudsman in the Hertfordshire case must give rise to questions about Lord Laming's appointment to head this inquiry\"; and Conservative Party spokesman Liam Fox said, \"I think the government maybe should have thought twice about this and maybe, even yet, they will think again\". The Department for Health, however, said that they were \"fully confident that he is the right person to conduct the inquiry\".\n\nSeveral documents were submitted late or in suspicious circumstances to the inquiry. A report by the SSI was submitted late because the SSI presumed the document was not relevant to the inquiry. The report was produced in April 2001 but was not handed over to the inquiry until 2002. An earlier report by the Joint Review about Haringey social services, which was heavily relied upon during the inquiry, said that service users were \"generally well served\"; the SSI report said that the former report presented \"an overly positive picture of Haringey's social services, particularly children's services\". Further documents were received late, when Haringey council handed in 71 case documents five months after the hearings began. Laming said, \"it shows a blatant and flagrant disregard to the work of this inquiry\". The people involved were threatened with disciplinary action. This was not the first time that Haringey council did not produce documents on time, which led Laming to say to its chief executive, \"it is a long sad and sorry saga of missed dates and missed timetables\". Garnham warned that Haringey senior managers, who had access to the documents, would enjoy an unfair advantage in the inquiry, but Laming said he was \"determined that Haringey is not given any advantage\". The inquiry found contradictory information in the NSPCC's files. One file said that Climbié's case was \"accepted for ongoing service\", whilst another computer record, made after Climbié's death, said that \"no further action\" was to be taken, suggesting the possibility that records may have been changed. Documents given to the inquiry may also have been altered: the NSPCC provided photocopies of original documents, which had alterations in them, saying that the originals were lost; however, the originals were later produced with pressure from the inquiry. The NSPCC held an internal investigation but found no evidence of deception.\n\nThe inquiry heard that many of the councils were understaffed, underfunded, and poorly managed. The chief executive of Brent council said its social services department was \"seriously defective\". The inquiry was told that many cases at Brent social services were closed inappropriately before inspection by the social services inspectorate, that children were being placed unaccompanied in bed-and-breakfast accommodation, and that children in need were turned away. The inquiry heard how Edward Armstrong had previously been ordered not to work with children over his handling of a case in 1993. Haringey and Brent councils diverted £18.7 million and over £26 million, respectively, in the two years 1997/98 and 1998/99, from its social services department into services such as education, for other purposes; both underspent their budgets for children's services, totalling £28m, by more than £10m in 1998–99, causing a deteriorating of child protection services. The inquiry heard how Haringey council failed to assign social workers to 109 children in May 1999, a short period before they took on Climbié's case. Again in January 2002, Haringey council failed to assign social workers to about 50 children. Haringey council wrote a letter to Laming claiming that social workers who gave evidence were being questioned more harshly than other witnesses. Laming condemned the letter, saying \"I will not tolerate any covert attempt to influence the way in which the inquiry is conducted.\" Mary Richardson, the director of social services at Haringey from 1 April 1998 until 31 March 2000, had been responsible for a restructuring of the department which, according to the union UNISON, had \"virtually paralysed\" the child protection service. She received contact from twelve senior practitioners and team managers criticising the proposals as \"potentially dangerous and detrimental to the people to whom we offer a service\". Richardson provided no substantive response to the memorandum. She did, however, say in the inquiry that the blame lay on \"part of all of the line management responsibility\". Gurbux Singh, the former chief executive of Haringey council (before becoming the chairman of the Commission for Racial Equality), said that there was nothing he could have done to prevent Climbié's death. Garnham contrasted this with Rossiter's willingness to accept responsibility, saying, \"that willingness to acknowledge error is at least at the root, is it not, of progress?\"\n\nKouao herself was called to the inquiry, becoming the first convicted murderer to appear in person in a public inquiry. She initially refused to answer questions, and when she did, protested her innocence, first in French, then, raising her voice in anger, in English. Giving evidence by video link from prison, Manning apologised for his actions and said that it was not the fault of the various agencies that Climbié died. Broadcasters applied for access to this video, but Laming refused the application. Climbié's parents gave evidence and were present at most of the hearings, becoming distressed when hearing of Climbié's plight and seeing pictures of her injuries. They blamed Haringey council and its chief executive for Climbié's death.\n\nArthurworrey, a junior worker with only nineteen months of child protection experience when she took on Climbié's case, was found to have made mistakes in the case. She accused her employer of \"making her a scapegoat\", and criticised her superiors and department for not guiding her properly. The inquiry heard that Arthurworrey was overworked, taking on more cases than guidelines allow. Carole Baptiste, Arthurworrey's first supervisor, initially refused to attend the hearings, but subsequently gave vague responses to the inquiry, and said that she had been suffering from mental illness at the time. Baptiste's own child was taken into care a few months before Climbié's death. Arthurworrey said that, in their meetings, Baptiste spent most of the time discussing \"her experiences as a black woman and her relationship with God\", rather than child protection cases, and that she was frequently absent. Baptiste admitted she had not read Climbié's file properly. She was removed in November 1999 when she was found to be professionally unfit for her job, and replaced by Angella Mairs, who became Arthurworrey's new supervisor. Mairs was accused by Arthurworrey of not maintaining childcare standards and of removing an important document—which recommended that Climbié's case be closed—from Climbié's file on 28 February 2000, the day the news of the death was known; but she denied this. Mairs said that she had not read Climbié's file.\n\nThe inquiry heard that the number of child protection police officers in the Metropolitan Police Service was reduced to increase the number of murder investigation officers because of the Stephen Lawrence case in 1993. A detective inspector supervising six child protection teams in London at the time of Climbié's death wrote a report criticising their competence. His former boss, however, claimed he had been lying when he said he only held \"purely administrative\" responsibility for the teams. The detective inspector was taken to hospital when a woman poured ink over his head while testifying. The new chief executive of Haringey council, David Warwick, Baptiste, the Metropolitan Police, and the NSPCC apologised for their failings in the case.\n\nIn his opening speech on 26 September 2001, Garnham said that race may have played a part in the case, due to the fact that a black child was murdered by her black carers, and the social worker and police officer most closely involved in the case were black. He said that the fear of being accused of racism may have led to the inaction. In the hearings, Arthurworrey, who is African-Caribbean, admitted that her assumptions about African–Caribbean families influenced her judgement, and that she had assumed Climbié's timidness in the presence of Kouao and Manning stemmed not from fear, but from the African–Caribbean culture of respect towards one's parents. Ratna Dutt, director of the Race Equality Unit (now the Race Equality Foundation), a charity that provides race-awareness training to social workers, later said, \"the implicit message is that it's acceptable for ethnic minorities to receive poor services under the guise of superficial cultural sensitivity. This is absolutely shameful, as it allows people to argue that good practice is compromised by anti-racism\"; and, contrasting the outcomes of the white and black staff members involved, \"for a large number of black frontline staff if the finger of blame is pointed at them they don't end up in jobs in other local authorities. That's how institutional racism operates\". Jacqui Smith, Home Secretary from 2007, said: \"I have not seen widespread evidence that social workers are not taking action\", and, \"there are no cultures that condone child abuse. We are absolutely clear that social workers and social work departments have a responsibility to consider whether children are subjected to harm, and if they think they are, to take action\". One chapter of the report following the inquiry looked at this issue.\n\nWhen both phases of the inquiry were completed, Laming began writing the final report. The Laming report, published on 28 January 2003, found that the agencies involved in her care had failed to protect her, and that on at least twelve occasions, workers involved in her case could have prevented her death, particularly condemning the senior managers involved. On the day of the launch of the report, Climbié's mother sang her daughter's favourite song as a tribute.\n\nThe 400-page report made 108 recommendations in child protection reform. Regional and local committees for children and families are to be set up, with members from all groups involved in child protection. Previously each local authority managed their own child protection register, a list of children believed to be at risk, and no national register existed; this, combined with local authorities' tendency to suppress information about child abuse cases, led to the implementation of the child database. Two organisations to improve the care of children, the General Social Care Council and the Social Care Institute for Excellence, had already been set up by the time the report was published.\n\nFollowing Victoria Climbié's death, the agencies in the case, as well as the child services system in general, were widely criticised. Milburn said, \"this was not a failing on the part of one service, it was a failing on the part of every service\". Fox said Climbié's case amounted to \"a shocking tale of individual professional failure and systemic incompetence\". Burstow said, \"there is a terrible sense of déjà vu in the Laming Report. The same weaknesses have led to the same mistakes, with the same missed opportunities to save a tortured child's life\". Labour Party Member of Parliament Karen Buck said, \"the Bayswater families unit told me that there must be hundreds of other Climbié cases waiting to happen\", and \"the Victoria Climbié inquiry highlighted how easy it is for vulnerable families to fall through the net, especially if they do not have English as a first language and are highly mobile\". The 1999 Department of Health document, Working Together to Safeguard Children (now superseded), set out child protection guidance to doctors, nurses, and midwives. The Royal College of Nursing, however, said that there was evidence that many nurses did not receive proper training in these areas. Denise Platt, chief inspector of the social services inspectorate (SSI), said doctors, police officers and teachers often thought their only responsibility was to help social services, forgetting that they had a distinct role to play. Mike Leadbetter, president of the Association of Directors of Social Services, said that many health professionals were \"not engaged in child protection\". After the inquiry, there was a feeling that senior managers had managed to escape responsibility and that only junior staff members were punished. Burstow said, \"the majority of children who die from abuse or neglect in this country know the perpetrator; it is within the family and by 'friends' that most abuse occurs. As a society we are still in denial about that hard truth\".\n\nThe Laming report was criticised by Caroline Abrahams and Deborah Lightfoot of NCH as too narrow, focusing too much on the particular case of Victoria Climbié and not on general child protection. According to Harry Ferguson, a professor of social work at the University of the West of England, \"Laming's report focuses too heavily on the implementation of new structures and fails to understand the keen intuition that child protection work demands\". He criticised the approach to child protection of focusing too much on the worst cases and trying too much to prevent them, rather than having an approach that also celebrates success; and said that focusing too much on any individual case and basing reforms on that was \"deeply problematic\". Laming responded to criticism by the Association of Directors of Social Services that his recommendations would require much more funding by saying that these arguments lacked \"intellectual rigour\", and he dismissed claims that his reforms would be too bureaucratic. \"The Guardian\" said that the report does not address the issues of frontline staff. Deryk Mead of NCH said, \"I do believe that inquiry reports have made a positive difference to the child protection system, and I have every confidence that Lord Laming's report will do so too\".\n\n\"The Guardian\" discussed the media attention surrounding the case, noticing how sensational events received widespread coverage, yet important but less exciting events received less. It states that only it and \"The Independent\" of the national newspapers gave significant coverage to the evidence in the hearings. A possible explanation is given as, \"much of the evidence has been concerned with social services, which many other papers view as a politically correct waste of money for the undeserving\".\n\nIn August 2002, Baptiste was fined £500 after being found guilty of deliberately failing to attend the inquiry. Climbié's parents, speaking through a family friend, said, \"we, the family, expected her to be dealt with more severely\". This was the first time a person had been prosecuted for not attending a public inquiry. In September 2002, Arthurworrey and Mairs were sacked following disciplinary procedures. The education secretary, Charles Clarke, also added them to the Protection of Children Act 1999 List, banning them from working with children. In October 2004, Arthurworrey appealed against her dismissal, saying that she was duped by Kouao and Manning, misled by medical reports, badly advised by her managers, and that she was a scapegoat for other people's failures, but the appeal was rejected. In 2005, she appealed the ban preventing her from working with children and won the case. In 2004, Mairs appealed her ban preventing her from working with children and won; this decision was challenged in the High Court but she prevailed. In 2004, six police officers involved in the case faced misconduct charges. All six kept their jobs, and some received reprimands and cautions. In 2004, the General Medical Council dropped misconduct charges against Dr. Schwartz.\n\nHaringey council held a debate in the council chambers to discuss the Laming report. The parents of Victoria Climbié were invited to speak at the council by Councillor Ron Aitken, but the Council leader George Meehan denied them permission. Only pressure from the opposition and local press got the decision reversed. As George Meehan only reversed his decision just before the meeting, a driver was rushed to Acton to escort Francis and Berthe Climbié and Mor Dioum, their interpreter, to the council. At the meeting, the Climbiés attacked the council, through their interpreter, for its handling of the case, especially in its dealing with the Laming Inquiry. (Mor Dioum later went on to be the Director of the Victoria Climbié Foundation.)\n\nThe government placed Haringey social services department under special measures, requiring close supervision by the social services inspectorate. Allegations emerged that in 2004 and 2005, senior managers at Haringey council ignored child abuse cases and \"became hostile\" against a social worker who sought to expose the abuse.\n\nClimbié's parents created the Victoria Climbié Foundation UK, a charity that seeks to improve child protection policies, and the Victoria Climbié Charitable Trust, an organisation to build a school in the Ivory Coast. They are also involved in championing many child protection reforms. A playwright, Lance Nielsen, wrote a play based on the events, staged at the Hackney Empire throughout 2002.\n\nAfter Climbié's death, commentators discussed the history of child protection and the various abuse and death cases, noting that there have been 70 public inquiries into child abuse since 1945, and comparing Climbié's case with that of many others, especially that of Maria Colwell in 1973. They pointed to the many children abused and killed by their guardians over the years and how the agencies involved in their care let them down. They noted similarly that their deaths also led to inquiries and reform policies—reforms that have not saved the many children killed following them. They pointed out that, \"an average of 78 children are killed by parents or minders every year; a figure unaltered in the 30 years since Maria Colwell's death provoked the first criticism of 'communications failure'\". They expressed cynicism towards the possibility that these reforms would be different. Dr. Chris Harvey, director of operations at Barnardo's, for example, said, \"Victoria's tragic case is the latest in a sad roll-call of child deaths, each leading to fresh inquiries and a new but recurring set of recommendations\". Ian Willmore, former deputy leader of Haringey council, said, \"the 'script' for this kind of Iinquiry is now almost traditional. The Minister goes on TV to insist that: 'this must never happen again'. Responsibility is pinned on a few expendable front-line staff, all conveniently sacked in advance. Criticisms are made about poor communication, with earnest recommendations about better co-ordination and possible restructuring. Council officers—all new appointments—go on TV to say that everything has changed since the case began. Everyone looks very earnest. Voices crack with compassion. Nothing essential changes.\"\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the Audit Commission regulate social services; John Seddon pointed out in \"The Times\" that \"Haringey Council was rated 4-star at the time of Victoria Climbié and Baby P's deaths\".\n\nClimbié's death was largely responsible for various changes in child protection in England, including the formation of the Every Child Matters programme, an initiative designed to improve the lives of children; the introduction of the Children Act 2004, an Act of Parliament that provides the legislative base for many of the reforms; the creation of ContactPoint, a database designed to hold information on all children in England and Wales (now no longer in operation); and the creation of the post of children's commissioner, who heads the Office of the Children's Commissioner, a national agency serving children and families.\n\n\n\n"}

As Washington was known for being a skilled horse rider, Nelson was a significant icon for a number of years, being one of Washington's favorite horses.\n\nNelson was foaled in 1763 and was given to Washington in 1778 by Thomas Nelson of Virginia, after whom the horse was then named.

However, it includes an entirely new Pokédex. The Starter Pokémon are the avian Grass-type Foliat, the goat-like Fire-type Kidling, and the reptilian Water-type Aguade.\n\n\"Pokémon Sage\" takes place in a fictional region called Urobos. Urobos is loosely based on Central and South America, with many \"Pokémon\", though not all, being related to the real-life region. It features a lush jungle to the south-west, snowy mountains to the north-west, and a huge unescapable desert to the south.\nThe villainous team(s) in the game are in no way related to the Aztec Empire or the Spanish conquistadors. The town the player starts in is covered in snow since the town is located up in the mountains. The player, named either Simon or Sofia by default, has a friendly rival as well as a more acerbic rival who steals the friendly rival's starter Pokémon.\n\nThe game's development began in 2011, when a group of \"Pokémon\" fans from /vp/, a board on the website 4chan dedicated to \"Pokémon\" discussion, decided to collaborate on a fangame. Developed for computers running Microsoft Windows, it was created using the software RPG Maker with the aid of Pokémon Essentials, a set of scripts tailored to \"Pokémon\" gameplay. The development team has sought out help from outside sources, allowing submissions for concept art and in-game sprites. The working title was \"CAPX\", which remains the namesake of the game's wiki. The game's development has been lengthy and marked by internal disagreements; by June 2014, even the villainous team had not yet been chosen from a list of candidates. A demo was released in 2014; it lasts for around two hours of gameplay and includes three towns and two caves, with a limited Pokédex of ten Pokémon.\n\n"}
{"id": "26221148", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26221148", "title": "Poltpalingada Booboorowie", "text": "Poltpalingada Booboorowie\n\nPoltpalingada Booboorowie (born – died 4 July 1901) was a Ngarrindjeri Aboriginal of the Thooree clan prominent among the community of Fringe dwellers in Adelaide, South Australia during the 1890s. He was better known to the Adelaide residents as Tommy Walker. He was the subject of several portraits by the Adelaide artist Oscar Friström.\n\nWalker was born in the early 19th century on the shores of Lake Albert in the upper south-east of South Australia. While young, Walker's father was reportedly killed in a tribal fight with the neighboring Kaurna people. He occasionally worked for local settlers and he may have travelled to the Victorian goldfields in the 1850s.\n\nWalker spent most of his life travelling between the fringe camps inhabited by displaced Aboriginals and, although he spurned white settlements and the restrictions of mission life, frequently visited the Point McLeay Mission (Raukkan) on the banks of Lake Alexandrina. Often arrested for drinking offences he was popular in Point McLeay for his wit. One story that became almost legendary regarded his church attendances. Whenever the communion cup was passed to Walker, he would drain it then call out, \"Fill 'im up again\". From the 1870s he was never seen without his companion Mary.\n\nIn the late 1880s, Walker and Mary joined the Fringe dwellers that lived in the Adelaide Park Lands. In 1892 Mary died and Ada Niledalli became his companion. Photographs show him as a thick set man with bushy hair, a full white \"flour bag\" beard and grey felt top hat, wearing a ragged jacket or tail-coat, and barefooted.\n\nA renowned mimic with a \"sharp wit and acid tongue\" Walker spoke fluent English and was especially fluent in what the media called \"condemnatory passages\". His popularity with the public was such that the government gave him a pass for free travel on public transport and the newspapers referred to him as the \"chartered libertine of the metropolis.\" He also had the gift of retort and it is related that one day he was travelling in a first class rail carriage when a Government Minister said \"Hello Tommy, how do you come here?\", Walker immediately replied \"All the same as bloody member of Parliament, got a free pass.\"\n\nThe local newspapers regularly reported on his movements, activities and his numerous appearances in court, usually on charges of being drunk, using insulting language or begging. Walker's begging was popular with the public as it resembled street theatre in which he would recount his most recent arrest, parodying the magistrate bringing down his sentence and imposing a fine. As Aboriginals had free access to public gatherings, he frequented football and cricket matches at Adelaide Oval where he would entertain the crowd with dramatic recreations of his police court appearances, alternatively playing the part of both the magistrate and offender. Walker became a common sight in Adelaide, walking the streets with Ada and his dogs while being followed by dozens of children. He once told a reporter; \"It's a funny thing that a gentleman can't walk along the footpath without a crowd of kids after him\".\n\nWalker's arrests were so frequent (and reported) that a rhyme about him was popular among school children who generally idolised him:Tommy Walker, walk up hereYou are charged with drinking beerForty bob you'll have to payOr down below you'll have to stayTa-ra-ra-ra-boom-de-ay. Walker saw the song as a compliment and often sang it himself at public gatherings. The fines he accumulated were always paid by public donations or from the proceeds of his begging.\n\nIt was arranged that on 9 July 1901, the Duke of Cornwall (the future king George V) was to visit Adelaide and by official decree, Adelaide's Aboriginals were \"deported\" to Encounter Bay, south of Adelaide. Wanting to see the Duke, Walker and several other Aboriginals walked back to Adelaide. Walker was found to be in a \"weak and feeble\" condition from the effects of the cold weather and was admitted to the Adelaide Hospital but slipped away on 28 June and returned to his wurlie in the parklands. He was later returned to the hospital where he died from hypothermia on 4 July.\n\nThe Adelaide Stock Exchange paid for his headstone, and Walker was buried in the West Terrace Cemetery. In 1903 it was discovered that the coroner, Dr. William Ramsay Smith, had removed his skeleton before burial and sent it to the University of Edinburgh as an \"anthropological specimen\", making up the missing weight in the coffin with sand. The revelation led to public outrage, and Aborigines began refusing to attend the Adelaide Hospital if sick. Smith was suspended and charges were laid against him for \"the misuse of human remains\". A board of inquiry found that the coroner's actions had been \"indiscreet\", and he was dismissed from his position as coroner. However, Smith was later reinstated and continued his practice of collecting remains. In the early 1990s, the University of Edinburgh became the first British institution to repatriate Aboriginal remains, and Walker's bones were ceremoniously buried at Raukkan.\n"}

The shooter was identified as Rocori High freshman John Jason McLaughlin, who shot and killed 15-year-old freshman Seth Bartell and 17-year-old senior Aaron Rollins. Prior to the shooting, McLaughlin was described as a \"quiet and withdrawn\" student with severe acne.\n\nOn September 24, 2003, McLaughlin arrived at school with a loaded Colt .22-caliber handgun with the intention of killing Bartell, whom McLaughlin claimed bullied him over his acne. McLaughlin met Bartell and Rollins as they were exiting the school locker room. He shot at Bartell, hitting him in the chest. McLaughlin fired a second shot at Bartell, which missed and hit Rollins in the neck, killing him instantly. Bartell attempted to flee the scene, but was followed by McLaughlin, who fired another shot at Bartell, hitting him in the forehead. Gym coach Mark Johnson then confronted McLaughlin, who initially brandished the gun at Johnson and then emptied the bullets from the gun and dropped it. Johnson secured the gun and took McLaughlin to the school office.\n\nBartell was taken to the St. Cloud Hospital, where he was treated for severe head and brain trauma. Bartell died 16 days later, on October 11, 2003.\n\nThe trial began on July 5, 2005. The defense argued that McLaughlin did not plan to kill anyone and that the teen had only intended to scare Bartell. The prosecution argued that the deaths were premeditated, as McLaughlin had stated to police that he had planned the shooting \"several days in advance\". Six mental health experts were brought in to testify in court. Three of the experts diagnosed McLaughlin with schizophrenia while the other three diagnosed him with major depression in remission and an \"emerging personality disorder\".\n\nMcLaughlin was found guilty of first and second-degree murder.\n\nIn August 2005, he was sentenced with two consecutive prison sentences. McLaughlin was sentenced to life in prison for first-degree murder and 12 years in prison for second-degree murder. Prior to the sentences, McLaughlin's attorneys attempted to have him declared insane at the time of the shootings, which would have resulted with McLaughlin serving his sentence at a mental hospital rather than a correctional facility. The Judge ruled that McLaughlin was sane at the time of the killings based on McLaughlin's writings and videotaped confession, where he detailed his planning of the crime. McLaughlin was also ordered to pay restitution in the amount of $15,000 to the Minnesota Crime Victims Reparations Board.\n\nJason McLaughlin was incarcerated at Minnesota Correctional Facility – Stillwater. He will not be eligible for parole until 2038.\n\nIn September 2006 the families of victims Aaron Rollins and Seth Bartell filed a wrongful death lawsuit against the McLaughlins, the Rocori school district, and former Rocori High School Principal Doug Standke. The families alleged that the school district had prior knowledge of the shootings about a week before their occurrence and that they could have prevented its occurrence. The lawsuit was initially dismissed, but later settled out of court for $200,000.\n\n"}

{"id": "41523463", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=41523463", "title": "Shidu (bereavement)", "text": "Shidu (bereavement)\n\nShidu () is a phenomenon denoting the loss of a parent's only child. The parents who have lost their only child are known as \"shidu fumu\" (), or simply as shidu parents.\n\nAs a result of the one-child policy, the number of shidu parents is expected to increase in China over the coming years. According to official figures, there have been at least one million families who lost their only child since the implementation of the one-child policy to the end of 2010 and it is expected to rise with 76,000 per year.\n\nIn a society where parents rely on their children for looking after them in old age, this phenomenon may have devastating effects to many shidu parents. Many shidu parents suffer from psychological problems and financial difficulties after losing their only child. In 2013, the China National Committee on Ageing reported that between 70 to 80 percent of shidu parents have suffered psychological trauma, in which half of these people are also experiencing depression.\n\nComparing bereaved parents and nonbereaved parents, it is observed that bereaved parents are significantly more vulnerable in physical well-being (in terms of chronic diseases and health status self-assessment) and psychological well-being (in terms of depression and satisfaction with life). Furthermore, bereaved parents tend to have less social support (in terms of practical support, emotional support, and social interaction). This is consistent with the reported social isolation of these parents, driven by both withdrawal and exclusion from society. Looking at the characteristics of bereaved parents, it's been observed that parents of a younger age, lower education level, and lower income level, and with chronic diseases are significantly more vulnerable in terms of well-being.\n\nInvestigating shidu in mainland China, with reduced family members due to population control, there are indications that the death of a loved one has become more devastating and traumatic for other family members as well.\n\nInvestigating shidu parents (with parents of a living child as control) in the Yangpu district of Shanghai, research show that shidu parents have an increased vulnerability for PTSD, depressive symptoms, and mental illness symptoms. Compared to males, females were especially susceptible to develop PTSD. In shidu parents, a significantly higher overall morbidity of coronary heart disease, tumors, mental diseases, and other unclassified diseases was also observed. Shidu parents also had more visits to the hospital.\n\nIn 2002, the National People's Congress put into law that local governments must \"provide necessary assistance\" to shidu parents if they do not adopt or give birth to another child. In 2007, the central government set a monthly compensation of minimum $16 per parent in ten provinces and cities. On 31 August 2007, National Population and Family Planning Commission (NPFPC) and the Ministry of Finance stated that the national compensation level is 100 yuan or above per person per month. Since a 2012 policy, families were entitled to a monthly compensation of minimum 135 yuan ($22) per parent. On 26 December 2013, the NHFPC increased the monthly compensation to a minimum of 340 yuan ($56) per parent for urban households and to a minimum of 170 yuan ($28) per parent for rural households, applicable if the woman is at least 49 years old. The actual amount of compensation may increase depending on provincial and local policies.\n\nThe governmental financial assistance has been characterized as relatively low. Furthermore, the program's strict focus on providing structural support (such as cash allowances and prioritized access to nursing homes) has been criticized, because it heavily lacks on issues that goes beyond structural support (such as psychological well-being and social support). Secondly, the structural interventions itself are considered inadequate, because there's a strong emphasis attached to filial obligation in old-age security and well-being in Chinese society, and nursing homes are inadequate in coverage and quality.\n\nProfessor Qiao Xiaochun (of the Population Research Centre at Peking University and former consultant for the Family Planning Committee) states that government assistance remains very poor, as the government did not fully expect all the possible consequences of the one-child policy at the very beginning, such as the problems associated with shidu parents. He also notes that the psychological issues are more pressing than poverty for most shidu parents.\n\nNotable people, such as Nobel laureate Mo Yan, have spoken out for more support to those who have lost their only child.\n\nOn 5 June 2012, around 80 \"shidu fumu\" (on behalf of 2000 \"shidu fumu\" who had signed a petition) assembled at the NPFPC and proposed the provision of economic compensation for their loss, the establishment of \"shidu fumu\"-oriented communities with low rent, and the designation of a department where \"shidu fumu\" can turn to for help when needed. There was no formal reply for almost two years. On 21 April 2014, over 240 \"shidu fumu\" assembled at the National Health and Family Planning Commission (NHFPC; having superseded the NPFPC in 2013) for an official discussion. Even though the NHFPC acknowledged their contributions to the family planning policies, they refused their request as they stated that there is no legal basis to support their requirement for administrative compensation.\n\nIncidents like the 2008 Sichuan earthquake, Boston Marathon bombings or the Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 disappearance have highlighted the tremendous impact that this phenomenon has.\n\nIn May 2010, the 60-year-old shidu parent Sheng Hailin became China's oldest person to give birth, namely to twin girls through IVF.\n\n"}
{"id": "27691", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27691", "title": "Social security", "text": "Social security\n\nSocial security is \"any government system that provides monetary assistance to people with an inadequate or no income.\" In the United States, this is usually called welfare or a social safety net, especially when talking about Canada and European countries.\n\nSocial security is asserted in Article 22 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which states:\n\nEveryone, as a member of society, has the right to social security and is entitled to realization, through national effort and international co-operation and in accordance with the organization and resources of each State, of the economic, social and cultural rights indispensable for his dignity and the free development of his personality.\n\nIn simple terms, the signatories agree that the society in which a person lives should help them to develop and to make the most of all the advantages (culture, work, social welfare) which are offered to them in the country.\n\nSocial security may also refer to the action programs of an organization intended to promote the welfare of the population through assistance measures guaranteeing access to sufficient resources for food and shelter and to promote health and well-being for the population at large and potentially vulnerable segments such as children, the elderly, the sick and the unemployed. Services providing social security are often called social services.\n\nTerminology in this area is somewhat different in the United States from in the rest of the English-speaking world. The general term for an action program in support of the well being of poor people in the United States is \"welfare program\", and the general term for all such programs is simply \"welfare\". In American society, the term \"welfare\" arguably has negative connotations. In the United States, the term \"Social Security\" refers to the US social insurance program for all retired and disabled people. Elsewhere the term is used in a much broader sense, referring to the economic security society offers when people are faced with certain risks. In its 1952 Social Security (Minimum Standards) Convention (nr. 102), the International Labour Organization (ILO) defined the traditional contingencies covered by social security as including:\n\n\nPeople who cannot reach a guaranteed social minimum for other reasons may be eligible for \"social assistance\" (or welfare, in American English).\n\nModern authors often consider the ILO approach too narrow. In their view, social security is not limited to the provision of cash transfers, but also aims at security of work, health, and social participation; and new social risks (single parenthood, the reconciliation of work and family life) should be included in the list as well.\n\nSocial security may refer to:\n\nA report published by the ILO in 2014 estimated that only 27% of the world's population has access to comprehensive social security.\n\nWhile several of the provisions to which the concept refers have a long history (especially in poor relief), the notion of \"social security\" itself is a fairly recent one. The earliest examples of use date from the 19th century. In a speech to mark the independence of Venezuela, Simón Bolívar (1819) pronounced: \"El sistema de gobierno más perfecto es aquel que produce mayor suma de felicidad posible, mayor suma de \"seguridad social\" y mayor suma de estabilidad política\" (which translates to \"The most perfect system of government is that which produces the greatest amount of happiness, the greatest amount of social security and the greatest amount of political stability\").\n\nIn the Roman Empire, the Emperor Trajan (reigned A.D. 98–117) distributed gifts of money and free grain to the poor in the city of Rome, and returned the gifts of gold sent to him upon his accession by cities in Italy and the provinces of the Empire. Trajan's program brought acclaim from many, including Pliny the Younger.\n\nIn Jewish tradition, charity (represented by tzedakah) is a matter of religious obligation rather than benevolence. Contemporary charity is regarded as a continuation of the Biblical Maaser Ani, or poor-tithe, as well as Biblical practices, such as permitting the poor to glean the corners of a field and harvest during the Shmita (Sabbatical year). Voluntary charity, along with prayer and repentance, is befriended to ameliorate the consequences of bad acts.\n\nThe Song dynasty (c.1000 AD) government supported multiple forms of social assistance programs, including the establishment of retirement homes, public clinics, and pauper's graveyards.\n\nAccording to economist Robert Henry Nelson, \"The medieval Roman Catholic Church operated a far-reaching and comprehensive welfare system for the poor...\"\n\nThe concepts of welfare and pension were put into practice in the early Islamic law of the Caliphate as forms of \"Zakat\" (charity), one of the Five Pillars of Islam, since the time of the Rashidun caliph Umar in the 7th century. The taxes (including \"Zakat\" and \"Jizya\") collected in the treasury of an Islamic government were used to provide income for the needy, including the poor, elderly, orphans, widowed persons, and the disabled. According to the Islamic jurist Al-Ghazali (Algazel, 1058–1111), the government was also expected to store up food supplies in every region in case a disaster or famine occurred. (See Bayt al-mal for further information.)\n\nThere is relatively little statistical data on transfer payments before the High Middle Ages. In the medieval period and until the Industrial Revolution, the function of welfare payments in Europe was principally achieved through private giving or charity. In those early times, there was a much broader group considered to be in poverty as compared to the 21st century.\n\nEarly welfare programs in Europe included the English Poor Law of 1601, which gave parishes the responsibility for providing poverty relief assistance to the poor. This system was substantially modified by the 19th-century Poor Law Amendment Act, which introduced the system of workhouses.\n\nIt was predominantly in the late 19th and early 20th centuries that an organized system of state welfare provision was introduced in many countries. Otto von Bismarck, Chancellor of Germany, introduced one of the first welfare systems for the working classes in 1883. In Great Britain the Liberal government of Henry Campbell-Bannerman and David Lloyd George introduced the National Insurance system in 1911, a system later expanded by Clement Attlee. The United States did not have an organized welfare system until the Great Depression, when emergency relief measures were introduced under President Franklin D. Roosevelt. Even then, Roosevelt's New Deal focused predominantly on a program of providing work and stimulating the economy through public spending on projects, rather than on cash payment.\n\nThis policy is usually applied through various programs designed to provide a population with income at times when they are unable to care for themselves. Income maintenance is based in a combination of five main types of program:\n\nSocial protection refers to a set of benefits available (or not available) from the state, market, civil society and households, or through a combination of these agencies, to the individual/households to reduce multi-dimensional deprivation. This multi-dimensional deprivation could be affecting less active poor persons (such as the elderly or the disabled) and active poor persons (such as the unemployed).\n\nThis broad framework makes this concept more acceptable in developing countries than the concept of social security. Social security is more applicable in the conditions, where large numbers of citizens depend on the formal economy for their livelihood. Through a defined contribution, this social security may be managed.\n\nBut, in the context of widespread informal economy, formal social security arrangements are almost absent for the vast majority of the working population. Besides, in developing countries, the state's capacity to reach the vast majority of the poor people may be limited because of its limited infrastructure and resources. In such a context, multiple agencies that could provide for social protection, including health care, is critical for policy consideration. The framework of social protection is thus holds the state responsible for providing for the poorest populations by regulating non-state agencies.\n\nCollaborative research from the Institute of Development Studies debating Social Protection from a global perspective, suggests that advocates for social protection fall into two broad categories: \"instrumentalists\" and \"activists\". Instrumentalists argue that extreme poverty, inequality, and vulnerability is dysfunctional in the achievement of development targets (such as the MDGs). In this view, social protection is about putting in place risk management mechanisms that will compensate for incomplete or missing insurance (and other) markets, until a time that private insurance can play a more prominent role in that society. Activist arguments view the persistence of extreme poverty, inequality, and vulnerability as symptoms of social injustice and structural inequality and see social protection as a right of citizenship. Targeted welfare is a necessary step between humanitarianism and the ideal of a \"guaranteed minimum income\" where entitlement extends beyond cash or food transfers and is based on citizenship, not philanthropy.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "559869", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=559869", "title": "Space adaptation syndrome", "text": "Space adaptation syndrome\n\nSpace adaptation syndrome (SAS) or space sickness is a condition experienced by as many as half of all space travelers during their adaptation to weightlessness once in orbit . It is the opposite of terrestrial motion sickness since it occurs when the environment and the person appear visually to be in motion relative to one another even though there is no corresponding sensation of bodily movement originating from the vestibular system.\n\nWhen the vestibular system and the visual system report incongruous states of motion, the result is often nausea and other symptoms of disorientation known as motion sickness. According to contemporary sensory conflict theory, such conditions happen when the vestibular system and the visual system do not present a synchronized and unified representation of one's body and surroundings. (This theory is also known as neural mismatch, implying a mismatch occurring between ongoing sensory experience and long-term memory rather than between components of the vestibular and visual systems, emphasizing \"the limbic system in integration of sensory information and long-term memory, in the expression of the symptoms of motion sickness, and the impact of anti-motion-sickness drugs and stress hormones on limbic system function. The limbic system may be the neural mismatch center of the brain.\" At present a \"fully adequate theory of motion sickness is not presently available\" but at present the sensory conflict theory, referring to \"a discontinuity between either visual, proprioceptive, and somatosensory input, or semicircular canal and otolith input\", may be the best available.\n\nSpace adaptation syndrome or space sickness is a kind of motion sickness that can occur when one's surroundings visually appear to be in motion, but without a corresponding sense of bodily motion. This incongruous condition can occur during space travel when changes in g-forces compromise one's spatial orientation. According to \"Science Daily\", \"Gravity plays a major role in our spatial orientation. Changes in gravitational forces, such as the transition to weightlessness during a space voyage, influence our spatial orientation and require adaptation by many of the physiological processes in which our balance system plays a part. As long as this adaptation is incomplete, this can be coupled to nausea, visual illusions, and disorientation.\" Sleep deprivation can also increase susceptibility to space sickness, making symptoms worse and longer-lasting.\n\nAccording to the sensory conflict hypothesis, space sickness is the opposite of the kinds of motion-related disorientation that occur in the presence of gravity, known as terrestrial motion sickness, such as becoming carsick, seasick, or airsick. In such cases, and in contrast to space sickness, one's surroundings seem visually immobile (such as inside a car or airplane or a cabin below decks) while one's body feels itself to be in motion. Contemporary motion sickness medications can counter all kinds of motion disorientation including space sickness by temporarily suppressing the vestibular system, but are rarely used for space travel because it is considered better to allow space travelers to adapt naturally over the first one to seven days rather than to suffer the drowsiness and other side effects of medication taken over a longer period. However, transdermal dimenhydrinate anti-nausea patches are typically used whenever space suits are worn because vomiting into a space suit could be fatal by obscuring vision or blocking airflow. Space suits are generally worn during launch and landing by NASA crew members and always for extra-vehicular activities (EVAs). EVAs are consequently not usually scheduled for the first days of a mission to allow the crew to adapt, and transdermal dimenhydrinate patches are typically used as an additional backup measure.\n\nJust as space sickness has the opposite cause compared to terrestrial motion sickness, the two conditions have opposite non-medicinal remedies. The idea of sensory conflict implies that the most direct remedy for motion sickness in general is to resolve the conflict by re-synchronizing what one sees and what one feels. For most (but not all) kinds of terrestrial motion sickness, that can be achieved by viewing one's surroundings from a window or (in the case of seasickness) going up on deck to observe the seas. For space sickness, relief is available via the opposite move of restricting one's vision to a small area such as a book or a small screen, disregarding the overall surroundings until the adaptation process is complete, or simply to close one's eyes until the nauseated feeling is reduced in intensity during the adjustment period. Some research indicates that blindness itself does not provide relief; \"Motion sickness can occur during exposure to physical motion, visual motion, and virtual motion, and only those without a functioning vestibular system are fully immune. \n\nIn August 1961, Soviet Cosmonaut Gherman Titov became the first human to experience space sickness on Vostok II; he holds the record for being the first person to vomit in space.\n\nApart from that record, space motion sickness was effectively unknown during the earliest spaceflights (Mercury, Gemini series) probably because these missions were undertaken in spacecraft providing very cramped conditions and permitting very little room for head movements; space sickness seems to be aggravated by being able to freely move around, especially in regard to head movement, and so is more common in larger spacecraft. After the \"Apollo 8\" and \"Apollo 9\" flights, where astronauts reported space motion sickness to Mission Control and then were subsequently removed from the flight list, astronauts (e.g. the Skylab 4 crew) attempted to prevent Mission Control from learning about their own SAS experience, apparently out of concern for their future flight assignment potential.\n\nAs with sea sickness and car sickness, space motion sickness symptoms can vary from mild nausea and disorientation to vomiting and intense discomfort; headaches and nausea are often reported in varying degrees. The most extreme reaction yet recorded was that felt by Senator Jake Garn in 1985. After his flight, NASA jokingly began using the informal \"Garn scale\" to measure reactions to space sickness. In most cases, symptoms last from 2–4 days. In an interview with Carol Butler, when asked about the origins of \"Garn\", Robert E. Stevenson was quoted as saying: \n\n"}
{"id": "2005973", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2005973", "title": "Steve Austin (character)", "text": "Steve Austin (character)\n\nSteve Austin is a science fiction character created by Martin Caidin for his 1972 novel, \"Cyborg\". The lead character, Colonel Steve Austin, became an iconic 1970s television science fiction action hero, portrayed by American actor Lee Majors, in American television series \"The Six Million Dollar Man\", which aired on the ABC network as a regular series for five seasons from 1974 to 1978. In the television series, Steve Austin takes on special high-risk government missions using his superhuman bionic powers. The television character Steve Austin became a pop culture icon of the 1970s.\n\"The Six Million Dollar Man\" television series had as its original working title during pre-production the Martin Caidin novel \"Cyborg\" title.\n\nCaidin's version of Steve Austin appeared in only four original novels unrelated to the television series continuity: \"Cyborg\", \"Operation Nuke\", \"High Crystal\", and \"Cyborg IV\".\n\nFollowing \"The Six Million Dollar Man\" television series, Lee Majors reprised the role of Colonel Steve Austin in several bionic-themed reunion television movies in the late 1980s and 1990s.\n\nAs originally conceived by Caidin, Austin is a former US Army helicopter pilot who served in Vietnam before being transferred to the Air Force and then into NASA. As backup Lunar Module Pilot for Apollo 17, he became one of twelve astronauts to walk on the moon when the prime Lunar Module Pilot (LMP) broke an arm before launch.\n\nIn the pilot episode of \"The Six Million Dollar Man\", Austin's background is adjusted: he is a civilian test pilot who was the only civilian to walk on the Moon. In the regular series, however, Austin once again became a military man, holding the rank of colonel in the Air Force. In the episode \"Pilot Error\" Austin is shown to be wearing both the Vietnam Service Medal and the Vietnam Campaign Medal on his dress uniform, implying that he is a Vietnam veteran.\n\nIn both versions of his origin, Austin is testing an experimental lifting body aircraft when a malfunction causes a crash. Austin's injuries are severe: both legs and one arm are lost, and he is also blinded in one eye and his skull is fractured (the TV version does not suffer the skull injury). One of Austin's best friends is Dr. Rudy Wells, a doctor and scientist who is a specialist in the newly emerging field of bionics; unknown to Wells, a secret American government intelligence agency, the Office of Strategic Operations (OSO; later changed to Office of Scientific Intelligence or OSI for TV) has been looking at a way of reducing agent casualties. Their solution is to take a severely injured man, rebuild him with bionics, and create a cyborg—part man, part machine. Wells is ordered to perform the procedure on Austin, who expresses a desire to commit suicide after learning about the loss of his limbs.\n\nThe operation to rebuild him costs $6 million ($36 million in 2018 dollars). Bionics are used to replace Austin's arm (his left in Caidin's original story; his right in the TV version) and both legs. Austin's eye is also replaced. Caidin and the TV series treat this differently; Caidin's Austin receives a sophisticated miniature camera (activated by pressing a hidden shutter implanted under Austin's skin after which the eye has to be removed before development of the film) but otherwise remains blinded in that eye, while the television version not only restores sight but also has extreme telescopic magnification and infrared capabilities. His legs and arm provide Austin with superhuman speed, strength, and endurance (the latter because, Caidin writes, Austin's heart and lungs only need to power his torso, head and remaining arm). Caidin's character also had some additional bionic parts his TV counterpart lacked, such as a steel-reinforced skull, a poison dart gun built into one of his bionic fingers, and a radio transmitter built into a rib.\n\nAnother big distinction between Caidin's original and his television counterpart is the extent to which the bionics could supply strength and speed. In the former, Austin's strength and speed were limited by the physical abilities of the connecting human parts. For instance, Austin could run faster than the best Olympic athlete, whereas the TV character could run 60 MPH. Caidin himself satirized the TV series' unrealistic science in another novel, \"ManFac.\"\n\nBoth versions of the character are subsequently recruited into the OSO/OSI as a secret agent (and as an ongoing test subject for bionics). Austin becomes a top agent, traveling the world to fight everything from terrorism (the most common target of the literary version of the character) to even alien invasion on television. Austin is obscure enough to usually maintain his anonymity, and uses his astronaut status to establish credibility when necessary.\n\nAustin's personality was altered in the TV series. In the books, Austin was capable of being cold-blooded and did not hesitate to use his powers to kill if necessary. Yet in the TV pilot, Austin is initially hesitant to work for the OSI because, he says, \"I don't want to kill people,\" although he appears to do just that in the subsequent mission. After the show's first season, however, Austin was usually not shown killing anyone.\n\nIn Caidin's novels, Austin's superior is OSO chief Oscar Goldman. Goldman was replaced by another character, Oliver Spencer, in the TV pilot film, but appeared in the regular series. The relationship between the TV version of Austin and Oscar was much friendlier than the literary counterpart, although numerous episodes show Austin being frustrated at being a \"bionic lap dog\" for the OSI.\n\nAustin's backstory is barely described by Caidin. The TV series, however, introduced his mother and stepfather (who live in Ojai, California), and eventually, a fiancée, Jaime Sommers, who later became bionic after a skydiving accident, leading to a spin-off series, \"The Bionic Woman\". Lee Majors made frequent guest appearances on the spin-off series, which springboarded from Jaime being brought back to life after her bionics failed; a consequence of this was she lost all memory of her relationship to Austin. Both \"The Six Million Dollar Man\" and \"The Bionic Woman\" went off the air in 1978.\n\nA later episode reveals that Austin's biological father was also an Air Force pilot and was killed in the crash of his C-47 Skytrain in the China-Burma-India Theater during World War II.\n\nFurther details about Austin's later life were filled in during . In the first (\"The Return of the Six Million Dollar Man and the Bionic Woman\"), which takes place several years after Austin retires from the OSI, it is revealed that he had a son, Michael, born in the mid-1960s. His mother is not identified. Michael subsequently suffers traumatic injuries in a crash similar to that which his father experienced, and undergoes bionic rebuilding which renders him more powerful than his bionic father. In exchange for Michael's operation, Austin agrees to return to OSI and his son also becomes an operative, though he did not appear in any subsequent films. In the second film, \"\", Austin is shown to be a senior OSI operative helping thwart a terrorist attack against an athletic event in Canada. \"Bionic Ever After?\", the final reunion film, saw Austin's bionics malfunctioning due to a computer virus, but in the end he is rescued by Jaime and the two finally marry as the film ends. Unlike Jaime, who undergoes an upgrade to her bionics in \"Bionic Ever After?\" which apparently adds new abilities, no such upgrade was ever evidenced for Austin in the telefilms, with the exception of an apparent enhancement to his bionic eye which is illustrated in \"Bionic Ever After?\".\n\n"}

This may be because not enough time has elapsed since the animal died, or because the conditions in which the remains were deposited were not optimal for fossilization.\n\nFor remains such as molluscan seashells, which frequently do not change their chemical composition over geological time, and may occasionally even retain such features as the original color markings for millions of years, the label \"subfossil\" is applied to shells that are understood to be thousands of years old, but are of Holocene age, and therefore are not old enough to be from the Pleistocene epoch.\n\nUnfossilized or partially fossilized remains can include bones, exoskeletons, nests, skin imprints, or fecal deposits. Subfossils of vertebrates are often found in caves or other shelters, where the remains have been preserved for thousands of years. The main importance of these vertebrate subfossil (versus fully fossilized) remains is that they contain organic material, which can be used for radiocarbon dating or the extraction and sequencing of DNA, protein, or other biomolecules. Additionally, isotope ratios can provide information about the ecological conditions under which extinct animals lived. Subfossils are useful for studying the evolutionary history of an environment and can be important to studies in paleoclimatology.\n\nSubfossils are also often found in depositionary environments, such as lake sediments, oceanic sediments, and soils. Once deposited, physical and chemical weathering may alter the state of preservation, and small subfossils can also be ingested by living organisms.\n\nSubfossil remains that date from the Mesozoic are exceptionally rare, are usually in an advanced state of decay, and are consequently much disputed.\n\nThe vast bulk of subfossil material comes from Quaternary sediments, including many subfossilized chironomid head capsules, ostracod carapaces, diatoms, and foraminifera.\n"}

In 1892 he was a student at Coventry School of Art. He maintained contact with the school for many years, becoming the first Secretary to the school's sketch club in April 1907. He resigned from the post three years later but remained a member of the club until 1916.\n\nBunney's work as an artist matured under the influence of William Milnes, who became the headmaster at Coventry School of Art in 1906. Milnes encouraged students to follow the example of Turner by taking quick sketches under differing conditions. This, according to Milnes, would give the artist a greater understanding of nature in its various moods. Many of Coventry's medieval buildings had survived up to the early 20th century, and Milnes pointed out that many of the buildings were suitable for studies on the effect of light. Several students took up this idea, including H. E. Cox, and Bunney became a prolific painter of Coventry scenes. His body of work records the city as a market town, the streets lined with red-brick and half-timbered shops and houses. Most of these pieces are small and intimate works of art.\n\nHe had great difficulty in having his work exhibited at any of the big shows, such as those at the Royal Academy, and interest in his work largely waned before he was rediscovered in the late 20th century.\n\nBunney became a cashier at the Auto Machinery Company Limited in Coventry and in his later years lived at 154 Albany Road, Earlsdon.\n"}
{"id": "190186", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=190186", "title": "Symphony No. 2 (Mahler)", "text": "Symphony No. 2 (Mahler)\n\nSymphony No. 2 by Gustav Mahler, known as the Resurrection Symphony, was written between 1888 and 1894, and first performed in 1895. This symphony was one of Mahler's most popular and successful works during his lifetime. It was his first major work that established his lifelong view of the beauty of afterlife and resurrection. In this large work, the composer further developed the creativity of \"sound of the distance\" and creating a \"world of its own\", aspects already seen in his First Symphony. The work has a duration of eighty to ninety minutes and is conventionally labelled as being in the key of C minor; the \"New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians\" labels the work's tonality as C minorE major. It was voted the fifth-greatest symphony of all time in a survey of conductors carried out by the BBC Music Magazine.\n\nMahler completed what would become the first movement of the symphony in 1888 as a single-movement symphonic poem called \"Totenfeier\" (Funeral Rites). Some sketches for the second movement also date from that year. Mahler wavered five years on whether to make \"Totenfeier\" the opening movement of a symphony, although his manuscript does label it as a symphony. In 1893, he composed the second and third movements. The finale was the problem. While thoroughly aware he was inviting comparison with Beethoven's Symphony No. 9—both symphonies use a chorus as the centerpiece of a final movement which begins with references to and is much longer than those preceding it—Mahler knew he wanted a vocal final movement. Finding the right text for this movement proved long and perplexing.\n\nWhen Mahler took up his appointment at the Hamburg Opera in 1891, he found the other important conductor there to be Hans von Bülow, who was in charge of the city's symphony concerts. Bülow, not known for his kindness, was impressed by Mahler. His support was not diminished by his failure to like or understand \"Totenfeier\" when Mahler played it for him on the piano. Bülow told Mahler that \"Totenfeier\" made \"Tristan und Isolde\" sound to him like a Haydn symphony. As Bülow's health worsened, Mahler substituted for him. Bülow's death in 1894 greatly affected Mahler. At the funeral, Mahler heard a setting of Friedrich Gottlieb Klopstock's \"Die Auferstehung\" (The Resurrection), where the dictum calls out \"Rise again, yes, you shall rise again / My dust\".\n\n\"It struck me like lightning, this thing,\" he wrote to conductor Anton Seidl, \"and everything was revealed to me clear and plain.\" Mahler used the first two verses of Klopstock's hymn, then added verses of his own that dealt more explicitly with redemption and resurrection. He finished the finale and revised the orchestration of the first movement in 1894, then inserted the song \"Urlicht\" (Primal Light) as the penultimate movement. This song was probably written in 1892 or 1893.\n\nMahler initially devised a narrative programme (actually several variant versions) for the work, which he shared with a number of friends (including Natalie Bauer-Lechner and ). He even had one of these versions printed in the program book at the premiere in Dresden on 20 December 1901. In this programme, the first movement represents a funeral and asks questions such as \"Is there life after death?\"; the second movement is a remembrance of happy times in the life of the deceased; the third movement represents a view of life as meaningless activity; the fourth movement is a wish for release from life without meaning ; and the fifth movement – after a return of the doubts of the third movement and the questions of the first – ends with a fervent hope for everlasting, transcendent renewal, a theme that Mahler would ultimately transfigure into the music of \"Das Lied von der Erde\". As generally happened, Mahler later withdrew all versions of the programme from circulation.\n\nThe work was first published in 1897 by Friedrich Hofmeister. The rights were transferred to shortly thereafter, and finally to Universal Edition, which released a second edition in 1910. A third edition was published in 1952, and a fourth, critical edition in 1970, both by Universal Edition. As part of the new complete critical edition of Mahler's symphonies being undertaken by the Gustav Mahler Society, a new critical edition of the Second Symphony was produced as a joint venture between Universal Edition and the Kaplan Foundation. Its world premiere performance was given on 18 October 2005 at the Royal Albert Hall in London with Gilbert Kaplan conducting the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra.\n\nReproductions of earlier editions have been released by Dover and by Boosey & Hawkes. The Kaplan Foundation published an extensive facsimile edition with additional materials in 1986. 1989 saw the publication of an arrangement by Bruno Walter for piano four hands.\n\nThe symphony is scored for large orchestra, consisting of the following:\n\n\nThe work in its finished form has five movements:\n\nThe first movement is marked \"Mit durchaus ernstem und feierlichem Ausdruck\" (With complete gravity and solemnity of expression). It is written in C minor, but passes through a number of different moods, resembles a funeral march.\n</score> \nThe movement's formal structure is modified sonata form. The exposition is repeated in a varied form (from rehearsal number 4 through 15, as Ludwig van Beethoven often did in his late string quartets). The development presents several ideas that will be used later in the symphony, including a theme based on the \"Dies irae\" plainchant.\n</score> \nMahler uses a somewhat modified tonal framework for the movement. The secondary theme, first presented in E major (enharmonic of F major, Neapolitan of E),\n</score>\nbegins its second statement in C major, a key in which it is not expected until the recapitulation. The statement in the recapitulation, coincidentally, is in the original E major (F major). The eventual goal of the symphony, E-flat major, is briefly hinted at after rehearsal 17, with a theme in the trumpets that returns in the finale.\n</score> \nFollowing this movement, Mahler calls in the score for a gap of five minutes before the second movement. This pause is rarely observed today. Often conductors will meet Mahler half way, pausing for a few minutes while the audience takes a breather and settles down and the orchestra retunes in preparation for the rest of the piece. Julius Buths received this instruction from Mahler personally, prior to a 1903 performance in Düsseldorf; however, he chose instead to place the long pause between the fourth and fifth movements, for which Mahler congratulated him on his insight, sensitivity, and daring to go against his stated wishes. \n\nA practical way of following Mahler's original indication is to have the two soloists and the chorus enter the stage only after the first movement. This creates a natural separation between the first movement and the rest of the symphony and also saves the singers more than twenty minutes of sitting on stage. One can get an idea of Mahler's intention through a comparison with his Symphony No. 3, where – due to the length of the piece – a real break after the first movement (as between two acts of an opera) is highly recommended, and indeed indicated by Mahler. As in the case of Symphony No. 2, this is not always observed nowadays.\n\nThe second movement is marked \"Sehr gemächlich. Nie eilen.\" (Very leisurely. Never rush.) It is a delicate Ländler in A major.\n</score>\nwith two contrasting sections of slightly darker music.\n</score> \nThis slow movement itself is contrasting to the two adjacent movements. Structurally, it is one of the simplest movements in Mahler's whole output. It is the remembrance of the joyful times in the life of the deceased.\n\nThe third movement is a scherzo in C minor. It opens with two strong, short timpani strokes.\nIt is followed by two softer strokes, and then followed by even softer strokes that provide the tempo to this movement, which includes references to Jewish folk music.\nMahler called the climax of the movement, which occurs near the end, sometimes a \"cry of despair\", and sometimes a \"death shriek\". \nThe movement is based on Mahler's setting of \"Des Antonius von Padua Fischpredigt\" from \"Des Knaben Wunderhorn\", which Mahler composed almost concurrently; in correspondence, Mahler expressed amusement that his sinuous musical setting could imply St. Anthony of Padua was himself drunk as he preached to the fish. \n\nIn 1967–68, the movement was used by Luciano Berio for the third movement of his \"Sinfonia\", where it is used as the framework for constructing a musical collage of works from throughout the Western classical tradition.\n\nThe fourth movement, \"Urlicht\" (Primeval Light) is marked \"Sehr feierlich, aber schlicht\" (Very solemn, but simple). It is a \"Wunderhorn\" song, sung by an alto, which serves as an introduction to the Finale. The song, set in the remote key of D major, illustrates the longing for relief from worldly woes, leading without a break to the response in the Finale.\n\nThe finale is the longest, typically lasting over half an hour. It is divided into two large parts, the second of which begins with the entry of the chorus and whose form is governed by the text of this movement. The first part is instrumental, and very episodic, containing a wide variety of moods, tempi and keys, with much of the material based on what has been heard in the previous movements, although it also loosely follows sonata principles. New themes introduced are used repeatedly and altered.\n\nThe movement opens with a long introduction, beginning with the \"cry of despair\" that was the climax of the third movement, followed by the quiet presentation of a theme which reappears as structural music in the choral section,\nand by a call in the offstage horns.\nThe first theme group reiterates the \"Dies irae\" theme from the first movement, and then introduces the \"resurrection\" theme to which the chorus will sing their first words, and finally a fanfare. \nThe second theme is a long orchestral recitative, which provides the music for the alto solo in the choral section.<br> \nThe exposition concludes with a restatement of the first theme group. This long opening section serves to introduce a number of themes, which will become important in the choral part of the finale.\n\nThe development section is what Mahler calls the \"march of the dead\". It begins with two long drum rolls, which include the use of the gongs. In addition to developing the \"Dies irae\" and resurrection themes and motives from the opening cry of despair, this section also states, episodically, a number of other themes, based on earlier material. The recapitulation overlaps with the march, and only brief statements of the first theme group are restated. The orchestral recitative is fully recapitulated, and is accompanied this time by offstage interruptions from a band of brass and percussion (which some had explained as the apocalypse's seven trumpets). This builds to a climax, which leads into a restatement of the opening introductory section. The horn call is expanded into Mahler's \"Great Summons\", a transition into the choral section.\n\nTonally, this first large part, the instrumental half of the movement, is organized in F minor. After the introduction, which recalls two keys from earlier movements, the first theme group is presented wholly in F minor, and the second theme group in the subdominant, B minor. The restatement of the first theme group occurs in the dominant, C major. The development explores a number of keys, including the mediant, A major, and the parallel major, F major. Unlike the first movement, the second theme is recapitulated as expected in the tonic key. The restatement of the introduction is thematically and tonally a transition to the second large part, moving from C minor to the parallel D major — the dominant of F minor — in which the Great Summons is stated. The Epiphany comes in, played by the flute, in a high register, and featuring trumpets, that play offstage. The choral section begins in G major.\n\nThe chorus comes in quietly a little past the halfway point of the movement. \nThe choral section is organized primarily by the text, using musical material from earlier in the movement. (The B below the bass clef occurs four times in the choral bass part: three at the chorus' hushed entrance and again on the words \"Hör' auf zu beben\". It is the lowest vocal note in standard classical repertoire. Mahler instructs basses incapable of singing the note remain silent rather than sing the note an octave higher.) Each of the first two verses is followed by an instrumental interlude; the alto and soprano solos, \"O Glaube\",\nbased on the recitative melody, precede the fourth verse, sung by the chorus; and the fifth verse is a duet for the two soloists. The opening two verses are presented in G major, the solos and the fourth verse in B minor (the key in which the recitative was originally stated), and the duet in A major. The goal of the symphony, E major, the relative major of the opening C minor, is achieved when the chorus picks up the words from the duet, \"Mit Flügeln\",\nalthough after eight measures the music gravitates to G major (but never cadences on it).\n\nE suddenly reenters with the text \"Sterben werd' ich um zu leben,\" and a proper cadence finally occurs on the downbeat of the final verse, with the entrance of the heretofore silent organ (marked \"volles Werk\", full organ) and with the choir instructed to sing \"mit höchster Kraft\" (with highest power). The instrumental coda is in this ultimate key as well, and is accompanied by the tolling of deep bells. Mahler went so far as to purchase actual church bells for performances, finding all other means of achieving this sound unsatisfactory. Mahler wrote of this movement: \"The increasing tension, working up to the final climax, is so tremendous that I don't know myself, now that it is over, how I ever came to write it.\"\n\n<poem lang=\"de\" style=\"float:left;\">Original German\n\nUrlicht\nO Röschen rot!\nDer Mensch liegt in größter Not!\nDer Mensch liegt in größter Pein!\nJe lieber möcht' ich im Himmel sein.\nDa kam ich auf einen breiten Weg:\nDa kam ein Engelein und wollt' mich abweisen.\nAch nein!

{"id": "30826311", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30826311", "title": "Well World series", "text": "Well World series\n\nThe Well World series is a series of science fiction novels by Jack L. Chalker. It involves a planet-sized supercomputer known as the Well of Souls that builds our reality on top of an underlying one of greater complexity but smaller size. The computer was built by a now-extinct race, the Markovians, who developed the Well of Souls with the goal of creating a new species that would transcend their own.\n\nThe Well World is the planet that houses the Well of Souls, and it exists within the original Markovian reality. Its surface was used as an experimental site where the Markovians tested their species designs before sending the successful ones into the new universe to populate planets. Humans are one of many such designed species who now live in the \"real\" world. During the time period of the novels, the Well World has been abandoned and left on its own for an unknown length of time.\n\nThe books mainly follow a mysterious character known as Nathan Brazil, who has an (initially) unknown connection to the Well World. The books are adventures that follow Brazil and a changing cast of secondary characters through a series of visits to the Well World over a period of hundreds (and millions) of years.\n\nThe series is largely set on a fictional planet named Well World. The Well World was constructed by an ancient alien species, known as the Markovians, who felt they had reached a dead end in their evolution. The Well World houses a planet-sized, reality-shaping computer that creates an artificial universe layered on top of the much smaller, original Markovian one. The Well World exists within the original Markovian universe, and can only be accessed through gateways on a number of Markovian planets scattered through the artificial universe. The Markovians experimented in species design on the Well World, sending the more successful ones into the new universe to populate one of these planets. By the time of the stories in the series, the Markovians have vanished, leaving behind the Well World, continually maintaining the new universe.\n\nThe Well World's surface is composed primarily of 1560 large hexagonal regions—called \"hexes\"—each with an independent and often dramatically different climate and ecosystem, that David Langford compares to the hexagonally tiled boards used in \"hex-and-counter\" forms of tabletop wargaming. Each of these hexes is a prototype environment for a planet that exists in the external universe, half of which, comprising the planet's southern hemisphere, contain carbon-based (or similar) oxygen-breathing life. The North is made up of exotic species which are often so alien that no common ground exists between them and the Southern races, and, often, their Northern neighbors as well. Since the Northern hemisphere contains, for example, seas of oxygen, chlorine, methane, and ammonia, Southern races need some kind of life support in the North. The two hemispheres are separated by an impermeable wall that extends \"several kilometers upward\". In the hexes that are bisected by the wall there is a separate gateway (the \"avenue\") to the Well of Souls, the control center for the computer.\n\nThe Well World computer also maintains a \"tech level\" for each of the hexes, making equipment of a higher level simply fail to work. High-tech hexes work as in the \"real\" universe, allowing any device to work. Semi-tech hexes allow simple machines to work, up to about the level of the steam engine, and any device using electricity will not work. Low-tech hexes allow no machines to work, and all effort has to be created by muscles. Even then, there are exceptions; Gedamondas is low-tech, but the Gedamondans can use naturally occurring steam from their volcanic vents, and the Agitar can electrocute people in any hex, regardless of tech level. Also, while chemical firearms do not, as a general rule, work in nontech hexes, matches and certain kinds of chemical explosives will, although the explosives can be dangerously unstable in nontech hexes. In some of the hexes, however, the Well World computer allows the inhabitants access to limited manipulation of reality, or \"magic\" (this is most commonly in low- and semi-tech hexes, but high-tech magic hexes have been mentioned). Vehicles that travel from hex to hex need to be equipped with multiple forms of power.\n\nIn addition to the hexes, the two polar regions, or \"zones\" contain maintenance areas, including a series of ambassadorial offices. These can be reached via gateways near the centers of each of the hexes, allowing easy transit from hex to pole for meetings and other duties. Newcomers to the Well World find themselves in the zones, where they are greeted by one of the ambassadors and then sent through a gateway. During this initial transit, the Well World computer transforms the traveler into a member of one of the many races, and sends them on to the associated hexes. From that point, the traveler is treated as a native of that hex. Since the only way to enter/leave Zone is through a Zone Gate, and exiting through any Zone Gate always takes one to their home hex, it is generally impossible for Southern and Northern races to travel into the other hemisphere. An InterZone Gate allows Northern and Southern ambassadors to travel between opposite Zones, and most materials can be transported via Zone gates, so there is some limited trade between North and South; for example, \"universal translators\" are grown in a Northern hex, and allow almost all races to communicate, at least within the limits of common ground. A very few instances of travel from North to South (or vice versa) have occurred, but these were exceptional.\n\nThe Equatorial Barrier contains six \"Avenues\" on either side of the barrier; each avenue leads up to the naked barrier. These are the only authorized entry points to the Well of Souls computer which controls and regulates the entire universe. The main control room contains what appears to be a crystal model of the Well World, but is, in fact, a separate control computer which regulates and stabilizes the Well World itself. This allows the main computer to be shut down and restarted without destroying the Well World. Any person who carries the \"Original\" pattern is converted into \"Markovian\" (also \"Ancient\", \"Creator\", or \"Maker\") form to solve design problems, as only this form possesses the capacity, knowledge, and capabilities necessary to interface with the main Brain. Also, any such personnel are recognized during Well processing, and treated as individuals of the race from which they originated. For this reason, Nathan Brazil (and, later, Mavra Chang) is translated to Glathrial, the home of type 41 (humans), without even being normalized to the Well-specific form.\n\nIn addition to the Well World, some of the action in the stories, typically the introductions, takes place in the multi-stellar human empire. In the early books this largely controlled by the Community of Worlds (the \"Com\"), where genetically engineered clones are widely used to form peaceful communist societies. In later books the Community has been replaced by the Realm, a confederation of over forty races. In the Watchers at the Well trilogy, the action starts on contemporary Earth long after the reset of the Well Computer.\n\nWriter Max P. Belin observes that as a plot device, the Well World has its advantages and disadvantages. It enables the protagonists of the stories to travel \"across mountains, grasslands, oceans, deserts, and forests\" without the use of any magical means for moving from world to world (such as those in C. S. Lewis's \"The Magician's Nephew\" (1955), which would be outside the domain of a science fiction story) or inexplicable \"hypertechnology.\" Rather, they travel under their own power from hex to hex. (With many hexes, it is possible to travel from one border to another in a matter of days, or sometimes weeks.) Since each hex not only has different environments and species — ranging from conventional classical mythological species such as yeti, centaurs, and satyrs to more esoteric science fiction species such as giant carnivorous insects and mobile plants — but as well a different, fixed, level of allowable technology — from \"non-tech\" and \"semi-tech\" hexes through to highly advanced technology that closely resembles outright magic (plus actual Well magic) — and since there are 1,560 of them, the author never need repeat situations and locations through the entire series of books.\n\nThe Well World also introduces extra plot elements. Since every person apart from Nathan Brazil, a major protagonist of several of the stories, is transformed into one of the Well World's own 1,560 species by the act of passing through the gateway on a Markovian world to the Well World, they have to cope with travelling companions who used to be human but no longer are, and all of the ensuing problems.\n\nThe Well World forces the introduction of two additional plot elements into every story. Since the only routes to the Well World from the outside are the gateways on the now-deserted and forgotten Markovian planets, every story has to incorporate their rediscovery in some fashion. Similarly, since there is no normal way off the Well World's surface from the hexes to either the original Markovian or the new artificial universe, every story has to incorporate an \"escape from an escape-proof laboratory\" of some kind for the characters to interact with the external universe. Furthermore, the nature of the Well World as a set of laboratory environments, whose technology levels and ecosystems are forcibly computer-controlled, limits what can potentially occur therein.\n\n\n\n.\n"}

She became Queen Æthelswith when she married King Burgred of Mercia in 853. The couple had no issue. Her marriage probably signalled the subordination of Burgred to his father-in-law and the Saxon kingdom at a time when both Wessex and Mercia were suffering Danish (Viking) raids. Burgred also had ongoing problems with the Kingdom of Powys on his western border and in 853 Æthelwulf subjugated the Welsh state on Burgred's behalf. \n\nRepeated Danish incursions over the years gradually weakened Mercia militarily and in 868 Burgred was forced to call upon Æthelswith's brother King Æthelred of Wessex to assist him in confronting an entrenched Danish army at Nottingham. This was the last time the Saxons came to the aid of the Mercians and is also notable as the occasion on which Alfred the Great, another brother of Æthelswith's, married his Mercian wife Ealhswith.\n\nBurgred's reign lasted till 874 when the Vikings drove him from the kingdom and he fled to Rome with Æthelswith. He died shortly after. Æthelswith lived on in Italy, to be buried at Pavia in 888.\n\nOn Queen Æthelswith's ring see:\n"}
