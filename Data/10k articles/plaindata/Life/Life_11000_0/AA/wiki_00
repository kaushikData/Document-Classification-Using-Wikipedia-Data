As a youth he worked as an apprentice to a metal craftsman, then as clerk at a cotton plant. In the First World War he served in the Imperial Russian Army as a volunteer in the 7th Siberian rifle regiment. In 1917, he joined the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party (bolsheviks). During the Civil War he fought for the Red Army and afterward, in 1920, moved to the organs of the GPU/OGPU, where by dint of his affable personality he rose rapidly through the ranks.\n\nOriginally, Slutsky worked in the OGPU's Economic Department engaged in industrial espionage. He received the first of two Orders of the Red Banner for his role in directing the apparatus which stole the process for making ball-bearings from the Swedes. In another clandestine operation, he extorted $300,000 from Ivar Kreuger, the Swedish Match King, by threatening to flood world markets with cheap matches made in the Soviet Union. In 1929, he was appointed as the assistant to Artur Artuzov, head of the Foreign Department. In May 1935, Genrikh Yagoda, chief of the secret police, replaced Artuzov with Slutsky.\n\nDuring Slutsky's tenure, the Foreign Department was principally engaged in tracking down and eliminating the opponents of Stalin's regime, essentially emigre White Russians and Trotskyists. Major operations included the kidnapping of General Evgenii Miller, the burglary of the Trotsky archive in Paris, the assassination of Ignace Reiss, and the liquidation of numerous Trotskyists and anti-Stalinists in Spain during the Civil War. Slutsky's illegals in Great Britain, Arnold Deutsch and Theodore Maly, were responsible for recruiting and developing the infamous Cambridge Five. In August 1936, he participated in concocting the evidence used in the first Moscow Trial, the so-called \"Trotskyite-Zinovievite Terrorist Centre.\" The task of extracting false confessions from Sergei Mrachkovsky and Ivan Smirnov fell to him. The voluble Slutsky described his methods for \"breaking-down\" these Old Bolsheviks to his subordinates, Alexander Orlov and Walter Krivitsky, who subsequently recounted these episodes in their memoirs.\n\nIn character, the defector Orlov, who worked directly under him and knew him well, thought Slutsky was \"distinguished by laziness, a propensity for window dressing and by subservience to his chiefs. He was gentle by nature, cowardly and double-faced.\" \nElizabeth Poretsky, who met with him frequently in 1936, thought he \"was a person of many contradictions ... he would weep while telling of the interrogation of some of the defendants at the trials and bemoan the fates of their families; in the same breath he would denounce them as 'Trotskyite fascists.'\" But, as she noted, he might have been stage-acting, hoping that others \"would betray themselves when he feigned sympathy for the victims of the trials.\" Poretsky adds that he courageously interceded with his superiors to save the families of condemned bolsheviks. \n\nWhen Nikolai Yezhov assumed control of the NKVD in 1937, he began to arrest and liquidate the department heads whom he knew were close to his deposed predecessor, Yagoda. Slutsky was spared, even though he was implicated in confessions as a \"participant in Yagoda's conspiracy,\" because Yezhov feared that Slutky's arrest would cause Soviet agents who were operating abroad to defect. Nevertheless, Slutsky's days were numbered, and his end came on 17 February 1938.\n\nThere are two unofficial accounts of Slutsky's death. The first appeared in Orlov's \"Secret History of Stalin's Crimes\" (1953) and presumably is based on gossip Orlov heard in France or Spain in 1938. In Orlov's version, Slutsky was invited to a meeting in the office of Mikhail Frinovsky, head of the GUGB, in the Lubyanka. Shortly afterward, his deputy, Sergei Shpigelglas, was called into the office and he observed Slutsky slumped in a chair with tea and cakes at the table beside him. Frinovsky said Slutsky had died suddenly of a heart attack. The chief of the NKVD, Nikolai Yezhov, ordered Slutsky's body put in the main hall of the NKVD club and surrounded by an honor guard of NKVD officers. However, the embalmers neglected to cover the tell-tale spots on Slutsky's face which indicated to the mourners that he had been poisoned with hydrocyanic acid. \n\nThe second account comes from Frinovsky's confession, obtained before his execution, in which he claims Yezhov ordered him to \"remove Slutsky without noise.\" Accordingly, Frinovsky invited Slutsky to his office for a conference, and while they were talking another deputy slipped into the room and covered Slutsky's nose with a chloroform mask. Once Slutsky passed out, a second deputy, who was hiding in an adjacent office, entered the room and \"injected poison into the muscle of his right arm.\" Frinovsky summoned a doctor who confirmed that Slutsky had died of a heart attack, which \"Pravda\" repeated in its 18 February obituary. None of the witnesses to this crime survived the Great Purge.\n\nTwo months after his death, Slutsky was posthumously stripped of his All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) membership and declared an enemy of the people. Although he has been rehabilitated, the Russian government's official position is that Slutsky died while working in his office.\n\n\n"}

He was travelling with the human rights activist and interpreter Andrei Mironov (also died in the attack), the French photo reporter William Roguelon and a local driver. When they stopped to take some pictures near a railway line, the group was hit by mortar shells from the Ukrainian front. The Italian authorities described the attack that killed both Mironov and Rocchelli as murder.\n\nRocchelli's death was investigated by the Italian authorities. An international rogatory to their Ukrainan counterpart was requested, but this action did not achieve any significant result. Nevertheless, further inquiries were carried out by the Italian prosecutor in collaboration with the investigative unit of the Carabinieri Special Operations Group.

{"id": "4333171", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4333171", "title": "Archaeological looting in Iraq", "text": "Archaeological looting in Iraq\n\nArchaeological looting in Iraq took place on the aftermath of the US-led invasion of Iraq in 2003. The chaos following war has provided the opportunity to pillage everything that is not nailed down. The period between April 8, 2003 when the staff vacated National Museum of Iraq and April 16, 2003 when US forces arrived in sufficient numbers to “restore some semblance of order.” Some 15,000 cultural artifacts disappeared in that time.\n\nLooting of ancient artifacts has a long tradition. As early as 1884, laws passed in Mesopotamia about moving and destroying antiquities. By the end of WW1, British-occupied Mesopotamia had created protections for archeological sites where looting was beginning to become a problem. They established an absolute prohibition on exporting antiquities. The British Museum was responsible for the sites and museums across Iraq during this time period. Gertrude Bell, well known for drawing the Iraq borders, excavated many sites around Iraq and created what is now the National Museum of Iraq. \n\nBy the mid 1920s the black market for antiquities was growing and looting began in all sites where antiquities could be found. After Iraq was independent of Britain the absolute ban on antiquity exports was lifted. Until the mid 1970s Iraq was one of very few countries to not prohibit external trade in antiquities. This made Iraq attractive to looters and black market collectors from around the globe. The result of the first Gulf War was that at least 4000 artifacts were looted from Iraq sites. Uprisings that followed the war also resulted in 9 of 13 regional museums being looted and burned. This was just a preview for what would once again happen after the 2003 war. Since the 2003 invasion of Iraq, archaeological looting has become an even greater problem. Though some sites, such as Ur and Nippur, were officially protected by US and Coalition forces, most were not. \n\nSaddam Hussein treasured his national heritage immensely and acted to defend these sites and the artifacts within them. Hussein came into power in 1979 as the fifth president of Iraq. He believed that the past of Iraq was important to his national campaign and his regime actually doubled the national budget for archeology and heritage creating museums and protecting sites all over Iraq. It wasn’t until his party the Ba'ath Party was under pressure in the 1990s that looting become a large problem once again for Iraq. By 2000 looting had become so rampant that the workers of the sites were even looting their own workplaces. With the fall of Saddam's government on 9 April 2003, archaeological sites were left completely open to looting.\n\nBefore the 2003 invasion by US and Coalition forces, the US government created a post-war plan for Iraq. The US has been heavily criticized in the media and academic writings for not adequately planning protections for culture and antiquities. According to Lawrence Rothfield, former director of the Cultural Policy Center at the University of Chicago and associate professor of English and comparative literature, this looting of the National Museum of Iraq and of hundreds of archaeological sites around the country was not prevented. At the time of war planning it was Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld who decided on a fast invasion with fewer troops, resulting in inadequate protection of buildings and cultural sites. \n\nAmerican troops and commanders did not prioritize security for cultural sites around Iraq. Peacekeeping was seen as a lesser job than physically fighting in combat and President Bush’s suspension of former president Clinton’s policies for peacekeeping not only backed up this thought but also made the US’s duties to restore public order unclear. American troops in Iraq didn’t trust Iraqi power of any kind meaning that instead of using and training Iraqi police, the US military took matters of security and policing into their own hands. Essentially the US would act as peacekeepers to train a national army and police force. Special Forces teams would work with regional warlords to keep control of their territories. Allowing warlords to police their own areas has been credited with being a disastrous plan for the archaeological sites in particular. \n\nArthur Houghton had an interest and some expertise in cultural heritage and was one of the first to wonder what the pre-war plan was for Iraqi culture. He had worked in the State Department as a Foreign Service officer, as an international policy analyst for the White house and also served at an acting curator for the Getty Museum. In late spring 2002, Houghton was approached by Ashton Hawkins, former Executive Vice President and Counsel to the Trustees of the Metropolitan Museum, and was asked to find out what was being done by officials to secure heritage sites in the upcoming war in Iraq. Houghton could find no one designated with the task of protection and preservation of culture in Iraq. \n\nThere had been a secret Future of Iraq Project since October 2001, with clearance from the Pentagon. However, even under this Project no specific person had taken up responsibility of culture. Even archaeological organizations in the US hadn’t noticed the issue until late 2002. Likewise when the US Agency for Cultural Development (USAID) met with estimated 150 NGO’s not one brought up protection of cultural heritage. UNESCO had in fact, after the Gulf War in 1991, attempted to go into Iraq and assess the damage to cultural sites but they were not allowed to enter the country. UNESCO then focused, for the next decade, on reconstruction after the fact rather than prevention measures.\n\nWithin the US military, Civil Affairs (CA) forces were important to the protection of culture and, as they were mostly reservists, included experts in a variety of areas including archaeology. The plan was to spread the expertise among fighting forces in order to warn them of cultural sites in the area. However, CA was left out of pre-war planning until January 2003, when it was too late to be of any real significant help. The CA had to prioritize the small amount of CA troops to what they thought was necessary, which inevitably wasn’t culture. The CA did, however, pull the only two archaeologists in Civil Affairs to be on a culture team, Maj. Chris Varhola and Capt. William Sumner. These two men, however, in the end were sent to other places when the conflict began. Varhola was needed to prepare for the refugee crises that never arrived and Sumner was reassigned to guard a zoo after pushing his advisor too hard on antiquities issues. Any protection of culture, sites or buildings was stopped due to the priorities of other matters. Essentially no one who had archaeological expertise was senior enough to get anything done. \n\nAnother branch of the US government that had interest in culture was the Foreign Area Offices (FAO). Unfortunately though, they were focused on customs and attitudes rather than archaeological sites. Something that was accomplished was the creation of a no-strike list created by Maj. Varhola just like two archaeologists before him had done during the 1991 Gulf War which had a great outcome of saving antiquities from bombing. \n\nOne piece of international law that is important for this conflict is the 1954 Hague Convention for the Protection of cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict, this Convention states that parties in conflict must “under take to prohibit, prevent and, if necessary, put a stop to any form of theft, pillage or misappropriation of, and any act of vandalism directed against, cultural property.” This provision was constructed for the parties actually in combat within the war and not civilians within their own state. As the upcoming years would prove, there are exceptions to this Convention and they would result in Americans firing on the Iraq National Museum. \n\nBy fall 2002, post-war planning was sporadic and improvised. The cultural planning aspect needed to have leadership that it never got. Deputy Assistant under the Security of Defense, Joseph Collins, recalls some forces spent more time working on projects that ended up not being needed like a refugee crises plan. He says he can’t remember if there was even an organizational plans to solve specific issues. \n\nThe first known effort by cultural interests to contact US officials was October 2002. After a meeting of powerful players in culture, Houghton sent a letter asking for departments to tell forces to avoid damaging monuments, soldiers were to respect the integrity of sites, and lastly to work quickly to get the antiquities services in Iraq up and running again. Following this, the Archaeological Institute of America (AIA) also sent a similar letter to the Pentagon in December 2002 asking for governments to take action to prevent looting in the aftermath of the war. As 2002 came to an end the media and government were only broadcasting the good done by the troops in not destroying cultural heritage themselves but not on the looting done by people in Iraq and the Americans duty to protect the antiquities.\n\nWhen the looting of the National Iraq Museum became known, experts from around the globe started planning to remedy the situation. McGuire Gibson, one of the leading archaeologists and experts on Mesopotamia explained to the Office of Reconstruction and Humanitarian Assistance (ORHA) that the looted museum artifacts were only a small part of what archaeological digs around the country held. Perhaps 25 thousand of an estimated half million sites were registered. ORHA had no resources to address this problem. Gibson had suggested helicopter surveys to determine the scale of looted sites. By April 24, 2003, looting had taken place in Umma, Umm al-Hafriyat, Umm al-Aqarib, Bismaya, Larsa, and Bad-tibira, most of were unguarded. Most looting was by workers once employed by the now disbanded State Board of Antiquities and Heritage. A local tribe was guarding the World Heritage Site of Hatra although others were unsupervised. \n\nBy May 2003, international work began on the already looted museum but not on other sites. The US military conducted a raid in May on Umma where they found hundreds of trenches with many looters all over the site. On May 7, the Bush Administration replaced Gen. Jay Garner with L. Paul Bremer who was given more power and banned high-ranking Ba’ath Party members from government jobs and disbanded the remains of the Iraqi army. Any guards at archeological sites were unpaid for months and they were not allowed to carry guns. Now, instead of dealing with civilian looters, these unarmed guards were dealing with large mobs of armed people. \n\nAt the end of May 2003, it finally became clear how badly the sites were looted when a trip sponsored by National Geographic went out to assess the damage. There was a northern and southern team to assess the post-conflict damage by land. They found the famous sites such as Babylon, Hatra, Nimrud and Ur were under US military control. Lesser known sites were completely unguarded and the responsible Civil Affairs teams didn’t even know where they were. Every place the National Geographic team saw, except one that was guarded by barbed wire, had been damaged. \n\nGibson was part of the northern National Geographic team and he sent a report to the White House science advisor John Marburger. Other archeological experts in both the US and Britain were waiting for invitations to go to Iraq and help. After Gibson’s report they were given invitations to create a team in Iraq. \n\nEarly July 2003, UNESCO revealed that looting was still happening at sites across the country. Other military services such as Japanese and Dutch troops offered assistance but were ignored. In July 8, a new security guard force known as the Iraqi Facility Protection Service (FPS) was established to protect sites all around the country in co-operation with the US military. A week later, the State Department announced it was forming a group to assist in the rebuilding of Iraq’s cultural heritage. \n\nThese announcements had no effect on the looting and illegal export of artifacts. McGuire Gibson on September 11, 2003 wrote to a military geographer, \"The continuing destruction of sites all over southern Iraq and the theft of thousands of artifacts every week, with no visible effort on part of the US authorities, makes the question of ethical behaviour by museums pointless. Your unit of the Pentagon is capable of demonstrating the location and expansion of illegal digging. Are you at least doing that much?\"\n\nIt is impossible to discover exactly how much destruction to archeological sites has happened since the 2003 invasion. As late as 2004, US military maps still did not show archeological sites. Archeologist Elizabeth Stone purchased satellite images of the seven thousand square kilometers in Iraq that contain many known sites. She counted 1,837 new holes by comparing 2001-2002 with 2003 images. Looters concentrated on sites that had the most marketable artifacts. Estimates of the number of looted artifacts from 2003-2005 are from 400,000 to 600,000 items. This number is 30-40 times greater than the number of artifacts stolen from the museum. Britain alone between 2004-2006 seized 3-4 tons of plundered artifacts. \n\nSome artifacts have been recovered by accident. An archeologist was watching a home decorating show when he saw a second century stone head from Hatra sitting on the decorator’s mantle. The illegal black market for goods became so saturated that prices in the market were going down after 2003 according to an antiquities researcher specializing in illicit dealings. \n\nRevenue from looted antiquities is estimated by the Archeological Institute of America to amount to between $10 to $20 million annually. Terrorist and rebel groups have a long history of using stolen artifacts to finance their operations. \n\nBy the end of 2003, 1,900 Iraqi antiquities had been confiscated from bordering countries: 1,450 in Jordan, 36 in Syria, 38 in Kuwait and 18 in Saudi Arabia. \n\nMarine Corps reservist Matthew Boulay witnessed illicit trading even on U.S. military bases. Flea markets authorized by the camp commanders included a booth with antiquities for $20, $40 or $100 each. Boulay asked Gibson and was told that these artifacts were real. Gibson asked Boulay to ask the base commander to stop these sales. When Boulay informed his platoon commander he got a “cease and desist” order forbidding any more emails about the issue to anyone. \n\nOther institutes from America and around the world have contributed to protect sites in Iraq but this is still not enough. The US started teaching military personnel headed for Iraq the importance of cultural heritage and site preservation, but not how to stop civilian looting. Donny George who was an employee at the Iraq National Museum was appointed to Director of Museums in 2004, and by summer 2006, a force of 1,400 guards were situated at sites around the country.\n\n\n\n\n"}

It is assumed that there is only one artificial employed bee for each food source. In other words, the number of employed bees in the colony is equal to the number of food sources around the hive. Employed bees go to their food source and come back to hive and dance on this area. The employed bee whose food source has been abandoned becomes a scout and starts to search for finding a new food source. Onlookers watch the dances of employed bees and choose food sources depending on dances. The main steps of the algorithm are given below.:\n\n\nIn ABC, a population based algorithm, the position of a food source represents a possible solution to the optimization problem and the nectar amount of a food source corresponds to the quality (fitness) of the associated solution. The number of the employed bees is equal to the number of solutions in the population. At the first step, a randomly distributed initial population (food source positions) is generated. After initialization, the population is subjected to repeat the cycles of the search processes of the employed, onlooker, and scout bees, respectively. An employed bee produces a modification on the source position in her memory and discovers a new food source position. Provided that the nectar amount of the new one is higher than that of the previous source, the bee memorizes the new source position and forgets the old one. Otherwise she keeps the position of the one in her memory. After all employed bees complete the search process, they share the position information of the sources with the onlookers on the dance area. Each onlooker evaluates the nectar information taken from all employed bees and then chooses a food source depending on the nectar amounts of sources. As in the case of the employed bee, she produces a modification on the source position in her memory and checks its nectar amount. Providing that its nectar is higher than that of the previous one, the bee memorizes the new position and forgets the old one. The sources abandoned are determined and new sources are randomly produced to be replaced with the abandoned ones by artificial scouts.\n\nArtificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm is an optimization technique that simulates the foraging behavior of honey bees, and has been successfully applied to various practical problems. ABC belongs to the group of swarm intelligence algorithms and was proposed by Karaboga in 2005.\n\nA set of honey bees, called swarm, can successfully accomplish tasks through social cooperation. In the ABC algorithm, there are three types of bees: employed bees, onlooker bees, and scout bees. The employed bees search food around the food source in their memory; meanwhile they share the information of these food sources to the onlooker bees. The onlooker bees tend to select good food sources from those found by the employed bees. The food source that has higher quality (fitness) will have a large chance to be selected by the onlooker bees than the one of lower quality. The scout bees are translated from a few employed bees, which abandon their food sources and search new ones.\n\nIn the ABC algorithm, the first half of the swarm consists of employed bees, and the second half constitutes the onlooker bees.\n\nThe number of employed bees or the onlooker bees is equal to the number of solutions in the swarm. The ABC generates a randomly distributed initial population of SN solutions (food sources), where SN denotes the swarm size.\n\nLet formula_1 represent the formula_2 solution in the swarm, Where formula_3 is the dimension size.\nEach employed bee formula_4 generates a new candidate solution formula_5 in the neighborhood of its present position as equation below:\n\nformula_6\n\nWhere formula_7 is a randomly selected candidate solution (formula_8), formula_9 is a random dimension index selected from the set formula_10 , and formula_11 is a random number within formula_12. Once the new candidate solution formula_13 is generated, a greedy selection is used. If the fitness value of formula_13 is better than that of its parent formula_15, then update formula_15 with formula_13; otherwise keep formula_15 unchanged. After all employed bees complete the search process; they share the information of their food sources with the onlooker bees through waggle dances. An onlooker bee evaluates the nectar information taken from all employed bees and chooses a food source with a probability related to its nectar amount. This probabilistic selection is really a roulette wheel selection mechanism which is described as equation below:\n\nformula_19\n\nWhere formula_20 is the fitness value of the formula_2 solution in the swarm. As seen, the better the solution formula_22, the higher the probability of the formula_2food source selected. If a position cannot be improved over a predefined number (called limit) of cycles, then the food source is abandoned. Assume that the abandoned source is formula_15, and then the scout bee discovers a new food source to be replaced with formula_2 as equation below:\n\nformula_26\n\nWhere formula_27 is a random number withinformula_28 based on a normal distribution and formula_29, are lower and upper boundaries of the formula_2 dimension, respectively.\n\n"}

His work was in many instances presented as photographs and film of his performances. He made performative installations, including \"Please Don't Leave Me\" (1969).\n\nAder was lost at sea in 1975, attempting to cross the Atlantic Ocean from the American coast to England sailing in a thirteen-foot sailboat. His deserted vessel was found off the coast of Ireland on 18 April 1976, offering few clues as to his fate.\n\nBorn on 19 April 1942, Ader grew up in Drieborg, a small village in the Dutch province of Groningen. His parents were both Calvinist ministers. His father was executed in 1944 by the Nazis for his large scale endeavors to help Jewish compatriots to escape the Holocaust.\n\nDuring adolescence, Ader took art classes at the Gerrit Rietveld Academy in Amsterdam, and later in the United States during a study abroad program. Ader graduated from the Otis College of Art and Design in 1965 with a BFA, and from the Claremont Graduate University in 1967. After graduating, he taught at various institutions, including Mt. San Antonio College, Immaculate Heart College, and the University of California, Irvine.\n\nAder created a handful of photographs as well as several short black-and-white films in which he is the sole performer.\n\nOne of his most famous works, \"I'm too sad to tell you\", consists of a 3-minute silent black-and-white movie of him crying, several photographs (long hair and short hair versions) and a post card mailed to his friends with the inscription \"I'm too sad to tell you\". Other films include him sitting on a chair on a pitched roof until he falls, one where he is hanging on a branch until his grip gives out and he falls into a stream, and a film in which he rides his bike into a canal.\n\nIn 1969–70 he anonymously published the satirical conceptual art magazine \"Landslide\" with his friend William Leavitt. The magazine featured “interviews” with nonexistent artists, such as “Brian Shitart”, and pranks such as “expandable sculpture” which was five packing peanuts in an envelope. Although satirical of conceptual art, the magazine itself is considered a work of conceptual art.\n\nIn 1973 he made the work 'In search of the miraculous (One night in Los Angeles)', a series of photographs showing a lonely figure wandering through the night in L.A, searching everywhere with a torchlight. It was the first part of a triptych. The second part would be the record of his Atlantic crossing (see below), the third part a similar night time search somewhere in the Netherlands, again to be recorded in a series of photographs.\nHe had arranged for a choir to sing sea shanties at a gallery in Los Angeles before his departure from Cape Cod. A similar performance was planned upon his arrival in a museum in Groningen, Netherlands.\nDue to his loss at sea, the triptych was never completed. The title “In Search of the Miraculous” was a reference to P.D. Ouspensky's mystical book \"In Search of the Miraculous\".\n\nOn 9 July 1975, Ader set off in a modified “Guppy 13” pocket cruiser named \"Ocean Wave\", to make his single-handed west–east crossing of the North Atlantic. He estimated that the voyage should take him some two and a half months. His unmanned boat was found nine months after he had set sail, floating nearly vertically in the water, bow down, 200 nautical miles (360 km) due west of Land's End, 100 nautical miles SW of Ireland. \"Ocean Wave\" was found by Spanish fishermen who took her to A Coruña from where she was stolen somewhere between 18 May and 7 June 1976.\n\nIt is unknown how Ader met his death. It is the source of much speculation. Sightings of him and his boat off the American East Coast and the Azores are unconfirmed. Ader was an accomplished sailor, having been one of a two-handed crew, sailing a yacht from Morocco to California in 1962-63. His brother Erik, an experienced ocean sailor, thinks that the fixed point on the boat to which his life line was attached was ripped out when he fell overboard in heavy weather. His conclusion is based on interviews with people in Spain who saw his retrieved boat before it was stolen.\n\nAder's mother, Johanna Adriana Ader-Appels, wrote the poem \"From the Deep Waters of Sleep\" on 12 October 1975, after having what she described as a premonition of his death:\n\nIn 1961, Ader exhibited his works at three galleries in Washington DC and received a positive review in \"The Washington Post\". He became a minor sensation, being interviewed by \"The Voice of America\" and by the press in his native Holland. In 1967, he gained his Master of Fine Arts with his project \"Implosion\" at Claremont Graduate School.\n\nDuring his lifetime, Ader had solo exhibitions at the Chouinard Art School, Los Angeles (1970), the Pomona College Museum of Art (1972), and the galleries Art & Project, Amsterdam (1972), , Bremerhaven, Germany (1972, 1974) and the Claire S. Copley Gallery, blogs.getty.edu; accessed 8 April 2015.\n\nAder held a two-person exhibition with William Leavitt at the Nova Scotia School of Art and Design (1972), a conceptual hotbed at the time, as well as a number of group exhibitions in Europe and the US with such artists as Leavitt, Ger van Elk, Gilbert & George, Jack Goldstein, Allen Ruppersberg, John Baldessari, and Marcel Broodthaers among others. His work was also included in the important international survey exhibitions \"Prospekt ’71: Projektion\" at the Kunsthalle Düsseldorf (1971), and \"Sonsbeek ’71\", Groningen, Holland. (1971).\n\nSince his disappearance, Ader's work has been exhibited in solo exhibitions at institutions worldwide including the Stedelijk Museum Amsterdam (1988), the Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen, Rotterdam (1993, 2006), Kunstverein München, Munich (1994, 2000), Musée d'Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris (1994), , Germany (2000), Portikus, Frankfurt (2003), and the Museo Tamayo Arte Contemporáneo, Mexico City (2004).\n\nAder's first retrospective in the United States took place in 1999 at the University of California, Irvine, and travelled to two other venues; the Mary Porter Sesnon Art Gallery, University of California, Santa Cruz, and the Sweeney Art Gallery at the University of California, Riverside. It was curated by Brad Spence with a catalogue including contributions by Thomas Crow, Jan Tumlir, and Spence. In 2006, Camden Arts Centre, London held a European retrospective of his works which travelled to the Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen, Rotterdam and the Kunsthalle, Basel, Switzerland.\n\nMore recent solo exhibitions include \"In Search of the Miraculous: 30 Years Later,\" , Santiago de Compostela, Spain (2010), \"Suspended Between Laughter and Tears,\" Pitzer Art Galleries, Pitzer College, Claremont CA (2010), which travelled to the Museo de Arte Zapopan, Mexico, and the artist's first Italian retrospective \"Tra Due Mondi,\" MAMbo, Museo d'Arte Moderna di Bologna, Bologna, Italy (2013). Metro Pictures, NYC, had a mini - survey of his work during summer, 2016. So did Simon Lee Gallery in London.\n\nErika Yeomans' conceptual documentary \"In Search of Bas Jan's Miraculous\" (1998, 40 minutes, mixed media) on Ader's life and art was featured on \"This American Life\" in 1996.\n\nInspired by Ader, digital movie pioneer Rene Daalder proposed a new genre of art called “Gravity Art” in 2008. Gravity Art is based on the idea of gravity as a medium. Ader is seen as the founder of this genre for the themes in his work of falling and letting go.\n\n\"Here Is Always Somewhere Else\" is a 2007 documentary film about the life and work of Bas Jan Ader. As seen through the eyes of fellow emigrant filmmaker Rene Daalder, the picture becomes an overview of contemporary art films, featuring work from artists Tacita Dean, Rodney Graham, Marcel Broodthaers, Ger van Elk, Charles Ray, Wim T. Schippers, Chris Burden, Fiona Tan, Pipilotti Rist and many others.\n\nAder was one of the invited artists of the 2017 57th Venice Biennale.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "20736775", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20736775", "title": "Borg", "text": "Borg\n\nThe Borg are a fictional alien group that appear as recurring antagonists in the \"Star Trek\" franchise. The Borg are cybernetic organisms, linked in a hive mind called \"the Collective\". The Borg co-opt the technology and knowledge of other alien species to the Collective through the process of \"assimilation\": forcibly transforming individual beings into \"drones\" by injecting nanoprobes into their bodies and surgically augmenting them with cybernetic components. The Borg's ultimate goal is \"achieving perfection\". Aside from being recurring antagonists in the \"\" television series, they are depicted as the main threat in the film \"\". In addition, they played major roles in the \"\" series and serve as the way home to the Alpha Quadrant for the isolated Federation starship USS \"Voyager\". The first encounter between humans and the Borg is depicted in the 2nd season of the series \"\" in the episode \"Regeneration\" in which the phrase \"you will be assimilated; resistance is futile\" is heard by the crew of the \"Enterprise\" for the first time.\n\nThe Borg have become a symbol in popular culture for any juggernaut against which \"resistance is futile\".\n\nThe Borg are cyborgs, having outward appearances showing both mechanical and biological body parts. Individual Borg are referred to as drones and move in a robotic, purposeful style ignoring most of their environment, including beings not deemed a threat. Borg commonly have one eye replaced with a sophisticated ocular implant. Borg usually have one arm replaced with a prosthetic one, bearing one of a variety of multipurpose tools in place of a humanoid hand. Since different drones have different roles, the arm may be specialized for a myriad of purposes such as medical devices, scanners, and weapons. Borg have flat, white skin, giving them an almost zombie-like appearance.\n\nSome Borg have been shown to be far stronger than humans; able to easily overpower most humans and similar species. Typical Borg have never been seen to run. Borg are resistant to phaser fire, many having personal shielding which adapts to phaser fire. In various episodes, phasers tend to become ineffective after time as the Borg is able to adapt to the phaser frequency. Later attempts to modulate phaser frequencies have limited success. Borg shields have not been seen to protect against non-energy weapons such as projectile or melee weapons. \n\nBorg possess a \"cortical node\" which controls other implanted cybernetic devices within a Borg's body, and is most often implanted in the forehead above the retained organic eye. If the cortical node fails, the Borg eventually dies. Successful replacement of the node can be carried out on a Borg vessel.\n\nBorg civilization is based on a hive or group mind known as the Collective. Each Borg drone is linked to the collective by a sophisticated subspace network that ensures each member is given constant supervision and guidance. The mental energy of the group consciousness can help an injured or damaged drone heal or regenerate damaged body parts or technology. The collective consciousness not only gives them the ability to \"share the same thoughts\", but also to adapt with great speed to tactics used against them. Drones in the Collective are never seen speaking, but a collective \"voice\" is sometimes transmitted to ships.\n\nIndividual Borg rarely speak, though they do send a collective audio message to their targets, stating that \"resistance is futile\", generally followed by a declaration that the target in question will be assimilated and its \"biological and technological distinctiveness\" will be added to their own. The exact phrasing varies and evolves over the various series episodes and film. \n\nThe complete phrase used in \"Star Trek: First Contact\" is:\"We are the Borg. Lower your shields and surrender your ships. We will add your biological and technological distinctiveness to our own. Your culture will adapt to service us. Resistance is futile.\"\n\nNanoprobes are microscopic machines that inhabit a Borg's body, bloodstream, and many cybernetic implants. The probes perform the function of maintaining the Borg cybernetic systems, as well as repairing damage to the organic parts of a Borg. They generate new technology inside a Borg when needed, as well as protecting them from many forms of disease. Borg nanoprobes, each about the size of a human red blood cell, travel through the victim's bloodstream and latch on to individual cells. The nanoprobes rewrite the cellular DNA, altering the victim's biochemistry, and eventually form larger, more complicated structures and networks within the body such as electrical pathways, processing and data-storage nodes, and ultimately prosthetic devices that spring forth from the skin. In \"\", Seven of Nine states that the Borg assimilated the nanoprobe technology from \"Species 149\". In addition, the nanoprobes work to maintain and repair their host's mechanical and biological components on a microscopic level, allowing regenerative capabilities.\n\nThough used by the Borg to exert control over another being, reprogrammed nanoprobes were used by the crew of the starship \"Voyager\" in many instances as medical aids. In one instance, the probes were used to revive crewman Neelix 18 hours, 49 minutes, and 13 seconds after death by repairing his body.\n\nThe capability of nanoprobes to absorb improved technologies they find into the Borg collective is shown in the \"Voyager\" episode \"\", where Seven of Nine's nanoprobes are fused with the Doctor's mobile emitter which uses technology from the 29th century, creating a 29th-century drone existing outside the Collective, with capabilities far surpassing that of the 24th-century drones.\n\nThe Borg do not try to immediately assimilate any being with which it comes to contact; in fact, Borg drones tend to completely ignore beings that are identified as too weak to be a threat and too inferior to be worth assimilating. Captain Picard and his team walk safely past a group of Borg drones in a scene from the film \"Star Trek: First Contact\" because they are unarmed, while the drones fulfill a programmed mission. In the \"Star Trek: Voyager\" episode \"\", Seven of Nine told Neelix that the Kazon were \"unworthy\" of assimilation and would only detract from the Borg's quest for perceived perfection.\n\nThe Borg are a spacefaring race, and their primary interstellar transport is known as a \"Borg Cube\" due to its shape. A cube was first seen in the \"\" episode \"Q Who?\" in 2365. Common capabilities of cubes include high speed warp and transwarp drives, self-regeneration and multiple-redundant systems, adaptability in combat, and various energy weapons as well as tractor beams and cutting beams. Additionally, different types and size of Cubes have been observed as well as Borg Spheres and some smaller craft.\n\nAs with most other \"Star Trek\" races, the Borg also have transporter capability.\n\nAssimilation is the process by which the Borg integrate beings, cultures, and technology into the Collective. \"You will be assimilated\" is one of the few on-screen phrases employed by the Borg when communicating with other species. The Borg are portrayed as having found and assimilated thousands of species and billions to trillions of individual life-forms throughout the galaxy. The Borg designate each species with a number assigned to them upon first contact; humanity being 'Species 5618'.\n\nWhen first introduced, the Borg are said to be more interested in assimilating technology than people, roaming the universe as single-minded marauders that have assimilated starships, planets, and entire societies to collect new technology. They are discriminating in this area, finding certain races, for example the Kazon, to be technologically inferior and not worthy of assimilation. A Borg infant found aboard a Borg Cube in \"Q Who?\" shows that the Borg will even assimilate children. The Borg then place the assimilated children into maturation chambers to quickly and fully grow them into mature drones.\nIn their second appearance, \"\", they capture and assimilate Captain Jean-Luc Picard into the Collective, creating Locutus of Borg (meaning \"he who speaks\", in Latin).\n\nThe method of assimilating individual life-forms into the Collective has been represented differently over time. When we see the Borg in \"Star Trek: The Next Generation\", assimilation is through abduction and then surgical procedure. In \"Star Trek: First Contact\" and \"Star Trek: Voyager\", assimilation is through injection of nanoprobes into an individual's bloodstream via a pair of tubules that spring forth from a drone's hand. Assimilation by tubules is depicted on-screen as being a fast-acting process, with the victim's skin pigmentation turning gray and mottled with visible dark tracks forming within moments of contact. After assimilation, a drone's race and gender become \"irrelevant\". After initial assimilation through injection, Borg are surgically fitted with cybernetic devices. In \"Star Trek: First Contact\" an assimilated crew member is shown to have a forearm and an eye physically removed and replaced with cybernetic implants.\n\nThe Borg also assimilate, interface, and reconfigure technology using these tubules and nanoprobes. However, in \"Q Who?\" we see a Borg apparently trying to assimilate, probe or reconfigure a control panel in engineering using an energy interface instead of nanoprobes. \n\nSome species, for various stated reasons, are able to resist assimilation by nanoprobe. Species 8472 is the only race shown to be capable of completely rejecting assimilation attempts. Other species, such as the Hirogen, have demonstrated resistance to assimilation as well as Dr Phlox who was able to partially resist the assimilation process in the \"\" episode \"\".\n\nThe Borg represented a new antagonist and regular enemy that was lacking during the first season of \"TNG\"; the Klingons were allies and the Romulans mostly absent. The Ferengi were originally intended as the new enemy for the United Federation of Planets, but their comical appearance and devotion to capitalist accumulation by free enterprise failed to portray them as a convincing threat. The Borg, however, with their frightening appearance, their immense power, and their sinister motive, became the signature villains for the \"TNG\" and \"Voyager\" eras of \"Star Trek\". In \"Voyager\" episode \"\", even Q tells his son \"don't provoke the Borg.\"\n\nIn the text commentary to the collector's edition of \"Star Trek: First Contact\", Michael Okuda revealed that \"Star Trek: The Next Generation\" (\"TNG\") writers began to develop the idea of the Borg as early as the Season 1 episode, \"\", which introduced a coercive, symbiotic life form that took over key Federation personnel. Plans to feature the Borg as an increasingly menacing threat were subsequently scrapped in favor of a more subtle introduction, beginning with the mystery of missing colonies on both sides of the Neutral Zone in \"\" and culminating in the encounter between Borg and the \"Enterprise\" crew in \"Q Who?\".\n\nBefore the film \"Star Trek: First Contact\" (1996), the Borg exhibited no hierarchical command structure. \"First Contact\" introduced the Borg Queen, who is not named as such in the film (referring to herself as “I am the Borg. I am the Collective.\") but is named Borg Queen in the closing credits. The Queen is played by Alice Krige in this film and in the 2001 finale of \"Star Trek: Voyager\", \"\". The character also appeared in Voyager's two-part episodes \"\" (1999) and \"\" (2000), but was portrayed by Susanna Thompson. Whether or not all of these appearances represent exactly the same Queen is never confirmed. In \"First Contact\", the Borg Queen is heard during a flashback of Picard's former assimilation, implying that she was present during the events of \"Best of Both Worlds\".\n\nThe Borg Queen is the focal point within the Borg collective consciousness and a unique drone within the Collective, who brings \"order to chaos\", referring to herself as \"we\" and \"I\" interchangeably. In \"First Contact\", the Queen's dialogue suggests she is an expression of the Borg Collective's overall intelligence, not a controller but the avatar of the entire Collective as an individual. This sentiment is contradicted by \"Star Trek: Voyager\", where she is seen explicitly directing, commanding, and in one instance even overriding the Collective. The introduction of the Queen radically changed the canonical understanding of the Borg function, with the authors of \"The Computers of Star Trek\" noting \"It was a lot easier for viewers to focus on a villain rather than a hive-mind that made decisions based on the input of all its members.\" \"First Contact\" writers Brannon Braga and Ronald D. Moore have defended the introduction of the Queen as a dramatic necessity, noting on the film's DVD audio commentary that they had initially written the film with drones, but then found that it was essential for the main characters to have someone to interact with beyond mindless drones.\n\nThe Borg first appear in the \"\" second-season episode \"Q Who?\", when the omnipotent life-form Q hurls the \"Enterprise\"-D across the galaxy to challenge Jean-Luc Picard's assertion that his crew is ready to face the galaxy's dangers and mysteries. The \"Enterprise\" crew is overwhelmed by the Borg, and Picard begs for and receives Q's help in returning the ship to its previous coordinates. \n\nThe Borg next appear in \"The Next Generation\"s third-season finale and fourth-season premiere, \"\". Picard is abducted and assimilated by the Borg and transformed into Locutus, the Latin for \"he who speaks\". Picard's knowledge of Starfleet's strengths and strategies is gained by the Collective, and the single cube destroys the entire Starfleet armada at Wolf 359. The \"Enterprise\" crew manages to capture Locutus, gain information through him which allows them to destroy the cube, and then reverse the assimilation process.\n\nIn the fifth-season episode \"I, Borg\", the \"Enterprise\" crew rescues an adolescent Borg they name \"Hugh\". The crew faces the moral decision of whether or not to use Hugh (who begins to develop a sense of independence as a result of a severed link to the Collective) as a means of delivering a devastating computer virus to the Borg, or return to the Borg with his individuality intact. They decide to return him without the virus, but in the sixth-season episode \"\", a group of rogue Borg who had \"assimilated\" individuality through Hugh fall under the control of the android Lore, the \"older brother\" of Data. Lore also corrupts Data through the use of an \"emotion chip\", but in the end, Data's ethical subroutines are restored and he manages to deactivate Lore. Data recovers the emotion chip and the surviving Borg fall under the leadership of Hugh.\n\nThe Borg return as the antagonists in the \"Next Generation\" film, \"\". After again failing to assimilate Earth by a direct assault in the year 2373, the Borg travel back in time to the year 2063 to try to stop Zefram Cochrane's first contact with the Vulcans, change the timeline, and erase Starfleet from existence. The \"Enterprise\"-E crew follows the Borg back in time and restores the original timeline. \"First Contact\" introduces the Borg Queen.\n\nThe only screen appearance made on this series was in the premiere episode \"\". Benjamin Sisko (Avery Brooks) was an officer on the USS \"Saratoga\", one of the ships in the Starfleet armada dispatched to confront the Borg at Wolf 359. The \"Saratoga\" is destroyed by the Borg, killing Sisko's wife, Jennifer. During that episode, Sisko's meeting with Picard is tense as he blames Picard for the actions of Locutus. Throughout the remainder of the series, references to the Borg are made occasionally, including the design of their ship, USS \"Defiant\", and the battle from \"\" being used as a plot point in Season 5 when Starfleet is spread too thin to deal with a Dominion incursion.\n\nThe Borg make frequent appearances in \"\", which takes place in the Delta Quadrant. The Borg are first seen by \"Voyager\" in the third-season episode \"\" in which Chakotay discovers the body of what the local humanoids refer to as \"the Invaders\"; which turns out to be the Borg. In \"\", the Borg are engaged in a war of attrition against Species 8472, whose biological defences are a match for the Borg's nanoprobes. In one of the few instances of the Borg negotiating, in exchange for safe passage through Borg space, the \"Voyager\" crew devises a way to destroy the otherwise invulnerable Species 8472. A Borg drone, Seven of Nine, is dispatched to \"Voyager\" to facilitate this arrangement. After successfully driving Species 8472 back into their fluidic space, Seven of Nine is severed from the Collective and becomes a member of \"Voyager\"s crew. Seven of Nine's rediscovery of her individuality becomes a recurring theme throughout the series. \n\nIn the fifth season, we see the Borg in \"\", where an advanced Borg drone is created when Seven of Nine's nanoprobes are fused with the Doctor's mobile emitter in a transporter accident, \"\", and \"\", where \"Voyager\" steals and uses a transwarp coil to travel 20,000 light-years before it burns out.\n\nIn the sixth season episode, \"\", the crew of \"Voyager\" encounter a damaged cube that is holding Tom Paris, Neelix, Harry Kim and Chakotay hostage. With all the adult drones dead, the ship is run by five Borg children who are saved by \"Voyager\" and deassimilated.\n\nIn the seventh season we see the Borg in \"\", where Q's son brings Borg onto \"Voyager\" and in the series finale, \"\", where Admiral Janeway from the future tries to bring \"Voyager\" back to Earth using a Borg transwarp hub. During this episode, Janeway infects the Borg with a neurolytic pathogen which infects the collective and kills the Queen.\n\nIn the \"\" episode \"\", the remnants of the destroyed sphere from \"\" are discovered in the Arctic along with two frozen drones. The Borg steal a research ship and send a transmission toward the Delta Quadrant before they are destroyed.\n\nThe origin of the Borg is never made clear, though they are portrayed as having existed for hundreds of thousands of years (as attested by Guinan and the Borg Queen). In \"Star Trek: First Contact\", the Borg Queen merely states that the Borg were once much like humanity, \"flawed and weak\", but gradually developed into a partially synthetic species in an ongoing attempt to evolve and perfect themselves.\n\nIn \"TNG\"'s \"Q Who?\", Guinan mentions that the Borg are \"made up of organic and artificial life [...] which has been developing for [...] thousands of centuries.\" In the later episode of \"Star Trek: Voyager\", \"\", Gedrin, of the race the Vaadwaur, says that before he and his people were put into suspended animation 892 years earlier (1482), the Borg had assimilated only a few colonies in the Delta Quadrant and were considered essentially a minor nuisance. Now awake in the 24th century, he is amazed to see that the Borg control a vast area of the Delta Quadrant. Seven of Nine comments that the Borg's collective memories of that time period are fragmentary, though it is never established why that is.\n\n\"The Star Trek Encyclopedia\" speculates that a connection could exist between the Borg and \"V'ger\", the vessel encountered in \"\". This idea of a connection is advanced in William Shatner's novel \"The Return\". The connection was also suggested in a letter included in \"Starlog\" no. 160 (November 1990). The letter writer, Christopher Haviland, also speculated that the original Borg drones were members of a race called \"the Preservers\", which Spock had suggested in the original series episode \"The Paradise Syndrome\" might be responsible for why so many humanoids populate the galaxy. It was confirmed in the \"TNG\" episode \"\" that an ancient species seeded hundreds, if not thousands of planets with their DNA, creating the Humans, Vulcans, Klingons, Romulans, Cardassians, and many more.\n\nThe extra section of the game \"\" contains the supposed \"Origin of the Borg\", which tells the story of \"V'ger\" being sucked into a black hole. \"V'ger\" was found by a race of living machines which gave it a form suitable to fulfilling its simplistic programming. Unable to determine who its creator could be, the probe declared all carbon-based life an infestation of the creator's universe, leading to assimilation. From this, the Borg were created, as extensions of \"V'ger\"'s purpose. Drones were made from those assimilated and merged into a collective consciousness. The Borg Queen was created out of the necessity for a single unifying voice. With thoughts and desires of her own, she was no longer bound to serve \"V'ger\".\n\nIn the graphic novel \"Star Trek: The Manga\", the Borg resulted from an experiment in medical nanotechnology gone wrong. An alien species under threat of extinction by an incurable disease created a repository satellite containing test subjects infused with body parts, organs, and DNA of multiple species along with cybernetic enhancements put in place by advanced medical technology. The satellite was maintained by nanomachines, which also maintained the medical equipment on board. The medical facility is parked in orbit by a black hole, and along with the relativistic state of time around the black hole, allows long-term research to continue at an accelerated time scale rather than in real-time speed. As the medical facility deteriorates, so does the programming of the nanomachines. The nanomachines began infusing themselves into the patients, interpreting them as part of the satellite in need of repair. Among the patients is the daughter of the head medical researcher of the satellite. The satellite eventually falls apart in an encounter with an away team from the \"Enterprise\" under the command of James T. Kirk. In the final moments of the satellite's destruction and the escape of the crew members of the \"Enterprise\" with the patients, the subjects display qualities inherently resembling the Borg: injection of nanomachines in a fashion similar to assimilation, rapid adaptation to weaponry, and a hive mind consciousness, as all the subjects begin following the whim of the daughter. As succumbing to the disease was inevitable, and the corrupt nanomachine programming infused itself into the bodies, the final image of the page of the manga Borg origin is left with the daughter turned Borg Queen, stating, \"Resistance is futile.\"\n\nIn the novel \"Lost Souls\" (the third book in the \"\" trilogy), the Borg are revealed to be the survivors of the Caeliar city Mantilis. Thrown across the galaxy in the Delta Quadrant and back in time to about 4500 BC by the destruction of Erigol at the climax of \"Gods of Night\", the first book in the trilogy, a group of human survivors from the starship \"Columbia\" and Caeliar scientists try to survive in a harsh arctic climate. Most of the human survivors die of exposure, while several Caeliar are absorbed into their race's gestalt to give life to the others in their group mind. The Caeliar offer the remaining humans a merging of human and Caeliar, to allow both groups to survive. The human survivors are resistant and as time goes on, the Caeliar called Sedin becomes the sole survivor of her group, her mental processes and her form both degrading as time goes on. When the humans return to Sedin for help, she forces them to merge with her, unwilling to allow herself to die when a union can save her life. The forced merging of the humans and the mostly decayed Caeliar results in the creation of the first Borg. The gestalt group mind is perverted to become the collective, driven by Sedin's desperate hunger and need to add the strength, technology, and life-force of others to her own. Ironically, while the Caeliar were–albeit accidentally–involved in the creation of the Borg, they also provide the means to end it; in the 24th century, the Caeliar absorb the entire Borg collective back into themselves, ending the cyborgs' centuries-long reign of terror.\n\nIn the \"Star Trek\" novel \"Probe\", which takes place following the events of \"\", the Borg are mentioned obliquely in communication with the whale-probe as spacefaring \"mites\" (the whale-probe's term for humanoid races) who traveled in cubical and spherical spacefaring vessels; the Borg apparently attacked the whale-probe and damaged its memory in some fashion before the events of the film.\n\nIn the \"Star Trek\" Game \"\", the Borg are featured prominently throughout the \"Enterprise\" and \"TOS\" era's before becoming a major threat in the \"TNG\" era. In unlockable motion-comics that are unlocked after completing each era, it is revealed that the Vulcan T'Uerell experimented on Borg corpses left behind from the \"Enterprise\" episode \"Regeneration\", and became assimilated. It wasn't until the end of the \"TOS\" era that she made contact with the main Borg force and became a queen before she was finally killed in a fleet of Starfleet, Romulan, and Klingon ships led by Picard.\n\nThe Peter David novel \"Vendetta\" reveals that the planet killer weapon from the \"\" episode \"\" is a prototype for a weapon against the Borg. David revisited this concept in a 2007 sequel novel, \"Before Dishonor\", which features the \"Enterprise\"-E working with Spock and Seven of Nine to reactivate the original planet killer to stop the Borg.\n\nIn William Shatner's novel \"The Return\", Spock is nearly assimilated by the Borg, but is saved because he mind-melded with V'ger, an earlier form of the Borg, and they assume that he is already a Borg. Using the information he subconsciously acquired in the meld, Spock is able to lead a crew of \"Enterprise\" officers (consisting of the \"Enterprise\"-D crew, himself, Admiral McCoy, and the resurrected Kirk) in a \"Defiant\"-class ship to destroy the Borg central node, severing all branches of the Collective from each other and limiting their future threat.\n\nIn David Mack's novel trilogy \"\", set over a year after \"\", the Borg stage a massive invasion of local space. Due to Kathryn Janeway crippling their infrastructure in \"Endgame\", the Borg fear for their survival and attempt to exterminate the Federation and its neighbors. They destroy the populations of numerous Federation worlds before being dismantled by the Caeliar, the advanced species that spawned them. The crews of the \"Enterprise\"-E, the \"\", and the \"Aventine\" had made contact with the Caeliar, learned of their role in the creation of the Borg, and convinced them to end the Borg once and for all.\n\nIn the \"Doctor Who\"/\"Star Trek\" crossover comic, , the Borg join forces with the Cybermen. When the Cybermen subvert the Collective, the \"Enterprise\"-D crew work with the Eleventh Doctor and the Borg, restoring the Borg to full strength and erasing the Borg/Cyberman alliance from existence.\n\nWriters Judith and Garfield Reeves-Stevens developed an unproduced idea for an episode which would have featured Alice Krige as a Starfleet medical technician who encounters the Borg and is assimilated – thereby becoming the Borg Queen.\n\nIn the video game , the Borg invades a Dominion cloning facility to create a clone of Jean-Luc Picard to create a new Locutus.\n\nThe Borg appear as antagonists to the player in the following \"Star Trek\" videogame titles:\n\nActivision planned to release \"\", in which the player would play a Borg, but later canceled the game.\n\nThe depiction of the Borg cube in \"Q Who\" garnered the episode an Emmy Award nomination.\n\n\"TV Guide\" named the Borg #4 in their 2013 list of the 60 Nastiest Villains of All Time.\n\nThe phrase \"resistance is futile\" became prevalent in popular culture from its use in the television show \"TNG\".\n\nThe Borg uttered the phrase in several\" Star Trek\" episodes and the film \"Star Trek: First Contact\" (which used the phrase as the tagline for the 1996 film). Patrick Stewart's delivery of the line, as Locutus, in \"\" was ranked no. 93 in TV Land's list of \"The 100 Greatest TV Quotes and Catchphrases\". It was used as the title for an episode of the TV series \"Dexter\".\n\n\n\n"}

(1873–1941).\n\nShe was the fourth of five children: Constance \"Conny\", Maurits \"Maus\", Cecilius \"Cecil\", Cornélie \"Cox\" and Wilhelmina Adolphina \"Dolph\". Cox was named for her Aunt the Christian evangelist, Countess Cornelia van Limburg Stirum, founder of the Christian School for Girls in Arnhem (\"Christelijke Meisjesschool\") later renamed the \"Limburg Stirumschool\".\n\nIn early 1914, the family travelled to Suriname. Cox and her two brothers Maus and Cecil were sent to San Francisco for their studies. Cox attended the \"Anna Head School for Girls\" in Berkeley, California. She was the Art Editor of the yearbook and had the ambition to become an artist. In 1925 Cox created a bas-relief for her former headmistress Mary Elizabeth Wilson.\n\nOn 2 February 1919, Miss Cornelia van Asch van Wyck appears with Dutch Consul van Coenen Torchiana in the \"San Francisco Chronicle, Society Section\". The occasion is a reception for Dutch Naval Officers.\n\nLater that year Cox returned to the Netherlands in company of her father. In 1921 Cox was in England where she nearly got engaged to her cousin Graaf (Count) Constantijn Willem Limburg Stirum (1900–1976) before the family intervened. Back in the Netherlands Cox pursued her schooling in the arts with the sculptor , the docent at the Royal Academy of Fine Arts in the Hague (Koninklijke Academie van Beeldende Kunsten).\nC.C. van Asch van Wijck became an active member of the 1920s Hague (Den Haag) artist community both as a model and as a sculptor. Cox modeled for the artists of her day such as the French painter and pastelist , the sculptor and her Professor Toon Dupuis, and .\n\nOn 7 August 1930, Cox married Hendrik Gerard Johan \"Henri\" Völcker, Heer van Soelen en den Aldenhaag (Zutphen 16 October 1891, Utrecht 18 December 1955), Henri was the Lord Protector (\"heer beschermer\") of the village of Zoelen a rural community in the Betuwe only accessible by river ferries. Neither the remoteness of her new home nor her married status stopped Cox from making regular trips to The Hague, to the beach at Scheveningen, to Leerdam, to Gouda etc. either with Henri or by herself. At Soelen she set up her atelier in the gatehouse.\n\nOn 18 September 1932 C.C. van Asch van Wijck gave birth to a son, Johan Adolph \"Dolph\" Völcker, Heer van Soelen en den Aldenhaag, Oud and Niew Hinklenoord whom she named for her youngest sister. She did not survive the birth. She was laid to rest in the Church cemetery of the Reformed Church (\"Hervormde kerk\") of Zoelen in presence of the whole village and all its notables, as well as many friends and relatives, two carriages were needed for the wreaths alone. After the benediction \"The Lord Völcker van Soelen thanked all present for the extraordinary large turnout and, turning to the grave, he said the words: 'Farewell, darling treasure, who was my everything'\". (\"De Heer Völcker van Soelen dankte al de aanwezigen voor de buitengewoon groote belangstelling en richtte zich tot het graf met de woorden: Vaarwel, dierbare schat, die alles voor mij was.\"\n\nAs a sculptor, C.C. van Ash van Wijk's most widely known work is connected with the Glassworks at Leerdam (\"Leerdam Glasfabriek\"). In 1929 she proposed her sculpture of a Woman's Mask to director of the Glassworks. The design was approved and went into production. It came in two versions; clear and frosted, some of the glass masks were completed with a wooden base.\n\nIt was groundbreaking for the Glassworks, they were adding pure art to their line of functional items, in addition to C. C. van Asch van Wijck, the Glassworks had engaged Lucienne Bloch - later well known for her Murals - who created her glass animals (a lioness, a duck etc.). Her work inspired by earlier Glassworks contributor 's \"Madonna with Child\"(1928). There was a bit of a buzz in the Dutch art world over creating and in glass and with industrial means.\n\nC. C. van Asch van Wijck's mask was part of an exposition in \"de Olde Munte\" in Arnhem and was well received in de Arnhemsche Courant. In 1930 it won a gold medal at the Wereldtentoonstelling voor Kolonien, Zeevaart en Vlaamse Kunst in Antwerpen (Belgium) (World Fair for Colonies, Navigation, and Flemish Art).\n\nC.C. van Ash van Wijk pursued her forray in combining art and industry by partnering with \"Koninklijk Goedewaagen\" of Gouda Holland, a manufacturer of earthenware in operation since 1610.

{"id": "714307", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=714307", "title": "Clayface", "text": "Clayface\n\nClayface is an alias used by several fictional supervillains appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics. Most incarnations of the character possess clay-like bodies and shape-shifting abilities, and all of them have been depicted as adversaries of the superhero Batman. In 2009, Clayface was ranked as IGN's 73rd Greatest Comic Book Villain of All Time.\n\nCreated by Bill Finger and Bob Kane, the original Clayface (Basil Karlo) appeared in \"Detective Comics\" #40 (June 1940) as a B-list actor who began a life of crime using the identity of a villain that he had portrayed in a horror film that he had starred in.\n\nIn the late 1950s, Batman began facing a series of science fiction-inspired foes, including Matt Hagen, a treasure hunter given vast shapeshifting powers and resiliency by exposure to a pool of radioactive protoplasm, who became the second Clayface. He retained the title for the next several decades of comic book history.\n\nIn the late 1970s, Preston Payne became the third Clayface. A scientist suffering from hyperpituitarism, Preston Payne used the second Clayface's blood to create a cure for his condition, but instead became a clay-like creature that needed to pass his new condition on to others to survive.\n\nSondra Fuller of Strike Force Kobra used the terrorist group's technology to become the fourth Clayface, also known as Lady Clay. She formed the Mud Pack with the original and third Clayfaces. During this era, the original Clayface used the DNA of Payne and Fuller to become the Ultimate Clayface (as he now called himself).\n\nSometime after the Mud Pack event, Payne and Fuller had a son named Cassius \"Clay\" Payne, who, as the fifth Clayface, also had metahuman shapeshifting powers.\n\nIn a 1998 storyline, Dr. Peter Malloy later used a sample of Cassus Payne's skin to become a Claything when he was introduced in \"Batman\" #550 (January 1998).\n\nIn 2002, the Todd Russell version of Clayface was introduced in \"Catwoman\" vol. 3, #4 (May 2002), and in 2005, the Johnny Williams version of Clayface was introduced in \"\" #60 (February 2005).\n\nThe original version of Clayface, Basil Karlo, first appeared in \"Detective Comics\" #40 (June 1940). He is a B-list actor who is driven insane when he hears that a remake of the classic horror film he had starred in, \"Dread Castle\", would be shot without him acting in the film, even though he is to be one of the advising staff. Donning the costume of Clayface, a villain he once played in a different movie, he begins killing the actors playing characters he killed in the order and way they die in the film, along with someone who knew his identity. Last, he plans to murder the actor playing the Clayface killer. He is foiled by Batman and Robin.\n\nHe reappears after the prison ambulance he is riding in plunges off a cliff. He once again dons the mask of Clayface and targets Bruce Wayne's fiancée, Julie Madison. Once again, the Dynamic Duo foil his plans. A movie buff, Batman co-creator Bob Kane states that the character was partially inspired by the 1925 Lon Chaney, Sr. version of \"The Phantom of the Opera\" and that the name of the character came from a combination of Boris Karloff and Basil Rathbone.\n\nKarlo returns twice more in the Silver Age of Comics to battle Batman, in \"Batman\" #208 and \"Detective Comics\" #496.\n\nIn the Post-Crisis continuity, Karlo languishes in a prison hospital, when the current Clayface Sondra Fuller visits him out of curiosity. Karlo proposes an alliance between all living Clayfaces to kill Batman. He even arranges for a small piece of the remains of Matt Hagen to be gathered to make him a post-mortem member of the \"Mud Pack\", as the group called itself. Even though the \"Mud Pack\" is defeated, Karlo injects himself with blood samples from Preston Payne and Sondra Fuller, gaining the abilities to shapeshift and melt with a touch; he becomes the self-declared \"Ultimate\" Clayface. He is defeated by the combined efforts of Batman and Looker of the Outsiders by overloading his abilities, making him melt into the ground. He literally sinks into the Earth's crust when he loses control of his powers; he survives, however, and now his body sports crystals similar to quartz that endow him with greater power. Karlo escapes his underground prison when Gotham City is struck by a great . He captures Batman and is about to kill him, but he gets into a feud with Mr. Freeze about who has a right to kill the Caped Crusader. Using that distraction, Batman soundly defeats both of them.\n\nDuring the \"No Man's Land\" storyline, Karlo holds Poison Ivy, who is in charge of producing fresh vegetables for the remaining people in the city, prisoner in Robinson Park. After she is freed from her prison by Batman, Poison Ivy battles and defeats Karlo, sinking him deep into the ground. It appears that the Ultimate Clayface is destroyed in this battle, but he resurfaces as a member of the Secret Society of Super Villains. Later, he seeks to increase his already formidable powers by absorbing Wonder Woman (a clay construct similar to him), giving him an amount of powers that border on invulnerability.\nWhile he is successful in absorbing some of the heroine's powers, causing her to regress to a teenage appearance resembling Donna Troy, he is ultimately returned to normal when Wonder Woman and Donna were able to trick Clayface into entering a train carriage with Wonder Woman while she was disguised as Donna, Donna subsequently using the Lasso of Truth to swing the carriage around and turn it into a mystical centrifuge, causing the clay Clayface had taken from Wonder Woman to split away from him and re-merge with Wonder Woman due to the differences between the two types of clay.\n\nBasil Karlo is among the members of the Injustice League and is among the villains seen in \"Salvation Run\". He can also be seen as a member of Libra's Secret Society of Super Villains. In the second issue of \"Final Crisis\", he triggers an explosion at the \"Daily Planet\" under Libra's orders when Lex Luthor orders Libra to do something that will draw Superman to them. Black Mask attempts to control Karlo by implanting a device in his body. He escapes Black Mask, but is captured and imprisoned by the Outsiders.\n\nIn \"The New 52\" (a 2011 reboot of the DC Comics universe), as a part of the \"Death of the Family\" storyline, Poison Ivy breaks Basil Karlo out of Arkham, claiming she wants to marry him. This turns out to be a ruse, however; Ivy is using him as part of a larger scheme. Upon realizing this, he seeks revenge.\n\nKarlo later returns with a new plan: to use his DNA-duplication abilities to impersonate Bruce Wayne and take control of Wayne Enterprises. He even guesses that Wayne is Batman's true identity. However, Batman plants false evidence to suggest that he anticipated Karlo's attempt to take his DNA and tricked him into taking a fake sample. Batman eventually stops Karlo by trapping him in a security system that can only be deactivated with Karlo's original DNA, reasoning that he has changed too much for his original DNA to be present in his system.\nIn \"Detective Comics Annual\" 2018, Basil is re-imaged as a handsome young actor who was disfigured in a car accident. In a desperate bid to salvage his career, he began abusing an industrial make-up chemical known as \"Re-Nu\" which, when combined with clay and putty, warps flesh into new shapes and forms; a secret he discovered from his father Vincent Karlo, a former special effects artist. However, the chemical is long out of production, and Karlo is forced to steal more and more of it to preserve his handsome appearance. Batman apprehends him during one such robbery, which reveals his secret to the world. Karlo's career is ruined and his girlfriend Glory Griffin dumps him. Batman attempts to get Karlo to testify against the creator of Re-Nu, Roland Daggett, but he refuses. Instead, he attempts to break into the warehouse where the police are holding his stolen stash of Re-Nu. When police open fire on the vials, Karlo is doused in the chemical and transformed into Clayface. He then attacks the set of the film he was fired from. Batman attempts to evacuate the set, but Clayface flings him off into the distance and begins massacring everyone in sight. As an added bit of revenge, Clayface disfigures Glory, who is working on the film as a production assistant, before Batman apprehends him. This incident leads Glory to become Mudface of the Victim Syndicate.\n\nThe second version of Clayface, Matt Hagen, first appeared in \"Detective Comics\" #298. A treasure hunter, Hagen finds a mysterious radioactive pool of protoplasm in a cave. Immersing himself in it by accident, he is transformed into a malleable clay-like form which could be shaped into almost anything he desires. This is only a temporary effect, however, requiring him to return to the pool periodically in order to maintain use of his powers. His criminal activities attracted the attention of Batman and Robin. Batman discovered his weakness and defeated him.\n\nMatt Hagen later escaped from prison and decided to investigate the protoplasmic substance that turned him into Clayface so that he can find a way to prolong his powers. Clayface posed as wealthy civilians of Gotham City in order to learn more about his criminal activities. Batman and Robin later confronted Clayface at his hideout where they used a combination of a freeze gun and the protoplasmic substance to defeat Clayface and return him to prison.\n\nMatt Hagen eventually breaks out of prison and uses the protoplasmic pool to become Clayface again. This time, Batman defeats Clayface by immersing himself in the protoplasm, with the resulting battle causing Batman to destroy the cave that contained the protoplasmic pool.\n\nClayface later competes with Joker causing Batman, Robin, Batwoman and Bat-Girl to work together to defeat both villains.\n\nAfter escaping from Green Wells Maximum Security Prison upon having stashed some chemicals there, Clayface eventually copies the pool's protoplasmic jelly by chemistry studies, although the artificial proptoplasm only allows him five hours of his power compared to the full two days of the pool's. Clayface resumes his crime spree by stealing the priceless stamp collection of millionaire K.A. King and stealing the trophy that was to be given to Batman. Clayface's activities also attract the attention of Superman. Assuming the form of Superman, Clayface is evenly matched with him until Clayface smashes some bleachers to provide a diversion to get away. During Clayface's robbery, Batman used Kryptonite on Clayface's Superman form, only for Clayface to get away by shapeshifting into a rocket. When Batman uses Red Kryptonite on him, it causes Clayface to go crazy. Clayface uses the X-Ray Vision in his Superman form to see who Batman is. Before he can reveal who Batman is, Clayface's powers wear off, causing him to regress back to Matt Hagen. Superman manages to save Clayface from the fall. Matt Hagen had lost the memory of Batman's secret identity as he is handed over to the Gotham City Police Department.\n\nWhen Brainiac returns to Earth to plan his revenge on Superman, he goes on a rampage and blasts the walls to a prison where Matt Hagen was imprisoned. This gives Matt Hagen the opportunity to escape and head to one of his secret laboratories in order to regain his powers. He makes more of the synthetic formula that gives him his shapeshifting powers for five hours. With Jimmy Olsen by his side, Batman works to track down Clayface while Robin works with Superman to catch Brainiac. This leads to a team-up between Clayface and Brainiac. While Superman and Robin managed to apprehend Brainiac, Clayface tries to escape, only for his formula to wear off which enables Batman and Jimmy Olsen to apprehend him.\n\nClayface later appears as a member of Queen Bee's Anti-Justice League in order to capture the Justice League. They are defeated by the Justice League.\n\nMatt Hagen's blood was later obtained by Preston Payne.\n\nClayface later breaks out of prison and restores his powers. He kidnaps Lois Lane as part of a plot to destroy Batman and Superman. Both superheroes managed to rescue Lois Lane and defeat Clayface.\n\nClayface is among the villains that fight Batman and Robin.\n\nDuring the \"Crisis on Infinite Earths\" storyline, Matt Hagen is ultimately killed by one of the Anti-Monitor's Shadow Demons, together with the Bug-Eyed Bandit.\n\nClayface appeared in Limbo alongside other dead supervillains as part of a plan to return to the living, only to be defeated by Hawk and Dove, the Teen Titans and Jeb Stuart's Haunted Tank. The imposter Etrigan the Demon offered them a way out through another portal, but he was merely toying with the dead supervillains. When he sent them through the portal, it turned out to be an entrance to Hell.\n\nDuring the \"Mud Pack\" storyline, Basil Karlo gathers a small piece of Hagen's remains and makes him a post-mortem member of the group. He was unable to bring Matt Hagen back to life.\n\nThe third version of Clayface, Preston Payne, first appeared at the end of \"Detective Comics\" #477 before making his first full appearance in \"Detective Comics\" #478-479. Suffering from hyperpituitarism, Payne works at S.T.A.R. Labs searching for a cure. He obtains a sample of Matt Hagen's blood, and isolates an enzyme which he introduces into his own bloodstream. Although he is briefly able to shape his own appearance, this effect is short-lived: while on a date, his flesh begins to melt, and when he grabs his horrified girlfriend's arm, she completely dissolves into a shapeless pile of protoplasm. Payne builds an anti-dissolving exoskeleton suit to support his clay-like flesh and contain his contagion, but he soon learns that he needs to transmit this dissolving contagion onto others to survive by touching them (he feels excruciating pain before this happens, which only stops when he touches someone). During this time his mental health starts to slip as he falls in love with a wax mannequin he names \"Helena\", thinking that she is the only woman who is immune to his touch. After another breakdown, he thinks Helena enjoys watching men \"fighting over her\" when he battles Batman yet again in front of the wax doll. Although he does not give her up, he keeps her in Arkham Asylum, saying \"we're both too polite to admit divorce, but she can't live forever\".\n\nWhen Swamp Thing visits Arkham Asylum, he witnesses Payne in an \"argument\" with Helena.\n\nDr. R. Hutton takes a night shift at Arkham Asylum in order to do research for his new book detailing superhuman psychology. He keeps a close watch on the inmates at Arkham Asylum. During this time, he sees Clayface spending intimate time with Helena.\n\nDuring the events of the \"Mud Pack\" storyline, Sondra Fuller, the fourth Clayface, begins masquerading as the superheroine Looker and visits Payne at Arkham. That same night, he gets into an argument with Helena and unintentionally knocks her head off. Believing that he has killed her, Payne goes on a rampage until subdued in a nearby swamp by the asylum guards. Fuller, who is still using Looker's appearance and powers, rescues him and influences him to follow Basil Karlo's commands. Karlo ultimately betrays Fuller and takes samples of her and Payne's blood to inject into himself. Payne finally breaks free of Fuller's control and is about to kill her when she admits how sorry she is for using him. The two, after escaping, fall in love and go on to live together while on the run, leading to Fuller becoming pregnant with their child, Cassius.\n\nPreston acquires medicine to control his pain and now feels it only in his mind. It is also revealed that he was abused by his parents.\n\nA stunted, emaciated Preston Payne appears in the graphic novel \"\" by Grant Morrison and Dave McKean. He is used to metaphorically represent sexually transmitted diseases.\n\nPayne next appears in the \"\" miniseries, having been coerced into working for Prometheus, who had threatened the life of his son. Prometheus had further mutated Payne, giving him back his old shapeshifting abilities and curing him of his contagion, and had him act as a decoy for the Justice League. When the ruse was discovered, an explosive device planted inside Payne's body detonated. It is unknown if he survived the explosion.\n\nThe fourth version of Clayface, Sondra Fuller (also known as Lady Clay), first appeared in \"Outsiders\" (vol. 1) #21. She is a member of Strike Force Kobra who is transformed into a shape-changer by her employer Kobra's technologies. She agreed to going through with the process because she hates her own face. The process works and she becomes a member of Strike Force Kobra.\n\nShe possesses identical abilities to those of Matt Hagen, but they are permanent, without the requirement for exposure to a source of protoplasm. She can additionally copy any special powers of the being she is mimicking. She is defeated by the Outsiders.\n\nLater, after the Mud Pack forms and battles Batman, Fuller falls in love with Preston Payne. After Clayface-Prime (Karlo) is defeated, Preston Payne and Sondra Fuller escape and get married while on the run, and they have a child named Cassius \"Clay\" Payne, a play on boxer Muhammad Ali's birth name. After Abbatoir kidnaps the child, the couple get into a fight involving Azrael/Batman. Batman eventually defeated them both, and Fuller was put into custody.\n\nThe \"DC Rebirth\" version of Sondra Fuller appeared in the \"Watchmen\" sequel \"Doomsday Clock\" where she claims that Kobra was not the person who gave her the powers of shapeshifting after all. Instead, she claims that her powers were the result of a government conspiracy to create superpowered beings. Her proclamation further adds to the global scandal known as \"The Superman Hypothesis\" which suggests that the United States has been secretly creating superheroes and supervillains for an unknown/unstated purpose.\n\nBefore the debut appearances of the fifth and sixth Clayfaces, Clayface III and IV team up, breaking Clayface I out of prison. Clayface I also futilely tries to revive Clayface II. Together, the trio form the \"Mud Pack\". Clayface I later copies the others' powers by injecting himself with extracts of blood samples of Clayface III and IV, becoming the \"Ultimate Clayface\". Clayface I is defeated by Batman and Looker and Clayface III and IV escape.\n\nAfter the Mud Pack incident, Payne and Fuller escape and fall in love while on the run. They eventually have a child together named Cassius \"Clay\" Payne, who becomes the fifth version of Clayface and debuted in \"Batman\" #550. The boy is separated from his parents and held in a government laboratory. The name \"Cassius\" is a pun on \"Cassius Clay\", the birth name of boxer Muhammad Ali.\n\nIf a piece of him is separated from his body, it can grow a mind of its own, but it mostly thinks in an unstable form of what Cassius wants. If bonded with another human, it becomes a Claything; the piece can give that human Clayface-like abilities, such as becoming soft and malleable, being able to withstand bullets and other forms of harm, and could also manifest Payne's ability to melt objects; all this person would have to do to perform such an action is to think about it. Cassius finds it very painful and distressing to have pieces of himself taken, and will go to crazed lengths to recover them.\n\nIn an issue of \"\", Cassius is depicted as having the clay-like appearance of his mother and father, but can only stay in this form while awake (a similar trait shared by Plasmus in the \"Teen Titans\" animated series (2003-2006)).\n\nFollowing the \"Final Crisis\" storyline, Cassius attacks the National Guard on the roadblock, but when he was approached by General Immortus' team, he is able to recognize one of the team, Human Flame. Cassius attacks and blames him for Libra enslaving Earth. The Justice League arrives to end the fight as Human Flame and General Immortus' team teleport away, leaving Cassius to be captured. After the League interrogates him, he is taken to some FBI vehicles, but the measures to contain him prove to be useless; Cassius breaks loose, escaping into the desert.\n\nThe sixth version of Clayface, also known as the Claything, also debuted in \"Batman\" #550. Claything is created when a skin sample from Cassius Payne comes to life and merges with a DEO (Department of Extranormal Operations) scientist, Dr. Peter Malley. He has the ability to melt objects simply by looking at them. Claything is destroyed when Cameron Chase psychokinetically turns his own powers against him, and his remains are stored at the DEO Headquarters.\n\nThe seventh version of Clayface, Todd Russell, debuted in \"Catwoman\" (vol. 3) #1 (January 2002), but is not actually shown until \"Catwoman\" (vol. 3) #4 (May 2002). This version of Clayface is not named until \"Catwoman\" (vol. 3) #44. Having the power to change into virtually any shape and size, he preys upon prostitutes in Gotham's East End until Catwoman is able to contain his decapitated head inside of a freezer. There are very few background details given about the seventh Clayface's past. He was in the Army, suffered injuries, and was subsequently experimented on (possibly by the DEO) before losing most of his memory and discovering his new powers. After his capture, he is held captive and further experimented upon for almost two years at S.T.A.R. Labs in Gotham before being freed by Catwoman.\n\nThe eighth version of Clayface, Johnny Williams, debuted in \"Batman: Gotham Knights\" #60 (February 2005). Williams is introduced as a former firefighter in Gotham who is transformed into a clay-based creature by an explosion in a chemical plant. He first discovers his transformation after he accidentally kills a prostitute; horrified and stricken with guilt, he plans to commit suicide. Just then, he is approached by Hush and the Riddler, who tell him that the chemicals turned him into the latest Clayface. They begin to manipulate Williams, holding out the promise of a cure and making him do their bidding, including pretending to be Tommy Elliot (Hush's true identity) and an adult Jason Todd, to hurt and confuse Bruce Wayne. Elliot also takes some samples from Williams to try and determine how he can duplicate the shapeshifting aspects of Clayface without losing his original form, also using these samples to infect Batman's ally Alfred Pennyworth with a virus that allows Hush to exert some degree of control over Alfred, forcing him to commit murder. Eventually, Williams realizes he is being manipulated and Hush will never help him after Hush tries to steal a sample of Cassius in the hopes that analysis of the 'pure' Clayface will help him crack the sample. Knowing that he is going to die, Williams offers Batman assistance against Hush in exchange for protecting his family. He redeems himself in his death by providing Batman with a sample of himself so that Batman can find a cure for the virus infecting Alfred, also ensuring that Alfred is cleared of the murder charges by ensuring that his final appearance after death includes fingerprints that are so similar to Alfred's that the detectives conclude that they simply made a mistake.\n\nThe ninth version of Clayface, the Clayface of Japan, debuted in \"Batman Incorporated\" (vol. 1) #6 (June 2011) as part of \"The New 52\" (a reboot of the DC Comics universe). Batman tasks Batman Japan (Jiro Osamu) to fight the Clayface of Japan about two-and-a-half months into his Batman Incorporated venture. Not much is known about this Clayface, except that he resembles all of the previous Clayfaces and seems to have their same set of powers. Presumably, this Clayface, as a rival to Osamu, is a native of Japan. Batman states that this Clayface is a newcomer, a samurai, and operates in or around Hokkaido.\n\nIn \"The New 52\" (a reboot of the DC Comics universe), a villain named Jeffrey Bode makes several short-lived clones of Clayface.\n\nEach of the Clayfaces has different powers, but they all share the ability to shapeshift.\n\n\nThe Earth-9 version of Clayface is featured in Tangent Comics' \"Tangent: Superman's Reign\" miniseries. This version is a shapeshifter like the mainstream versions, but his base form is that of a hulking, misshapen human with melted skin.\n\nIn the alternate timeline of the \"Flashpoint\" event, a version of Clayface is a member of Deathstroke's pirates after being broken out of a floating prison by Deathstroke. During attacks by Aquaman and Ocean Master, Clayface is pushed by Aquaman into the water, apparently killing him.\n\nThe Basil Karlo version of Clayface appears in Year Two of the \"\" comic.\n\nIn the \"\" prequel comic series, samples of Basil Karlo's mud were acquired by various parties including Simon Stagg, who created \"Project: Meta\", and Hush which he used for his face to hide his cosmetic surgery scars. Karlo also appeared during one of Joker's fantasies, and briefly during one of Batman's simulations for Robin. It was also revealed that Karlo is still alive within the mud collected by GCPD, but is unable to take form again because of the Lazarus Particles mixed with his mud and the explosion from the generator.\n\nIn the 2017 miniseries \"\", an unnamed Clayface appears as a chief character. Criminal Jack Napier (a Joker who was temporarily cured of his insanity after being force-fed pills by Batman), uses the Mad Hatter's mind control technology to control Clayface, while slipping small particles from his body into the drinks of many of Batman’s other villains. This allows Napier to control a small army of villains via this Clayface’s ability to control parts of his body that had been separated from him.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Basil Karlo iteration of Clayface can be seen in the \"\" video game franchise, primarily voiced by Rick D. Wasserman. \n\n\n"}

There is no medical literature to support their case. While some believe that cryptic pregnancy is due to failure to recognize the active biological role of the fetus in determining the course of pregnancy, some believe that cryptic pregnancy could due to elevated psychosocial stress. Consequences associated with cryptic pregnancy include antepartum deaths, intrapartum deaths, and neonatal deaths. The most common main cause of death was infection, neonatal and placental. Some people believe that cryptic pregnancy can often lead to poor outcome and deaths due to postpartum emotional disturbance, preterm births, small for gestational age babies. Cryptic pregnancy could possibly contribute to increased incidence of fetal abuse, child neglect or even neonaticide.\n\n"}
{"id": "676520", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=676520", "title": "Cyborg (comics)", "text": "Cyborg (comics)\n\nCyborg is a fictional superhero appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics . The character was created by writer Marv Wolfman and artist George Pérez and first appears in a special insert in \"DC Comics Presents\" #26 (October 1980). Originally known as a member of the Teen Titans, Cyborg was established as a founding member of the Justice League in DC's 2011 reboot of its comic book titles and subsequently in the 2016 relaunch of its continuity. However, he has since been re-established as a past member of the Teen Titans again.\n\nThe character appears in the DC Extended Universe, where he is played by actor Ray Fisher. This adaptation of Cyborg had a cameo appearance in the 2016 film \"\" and a main role in the 2017 film \"Justice League\", and is set to appear in a standalone \"Cyborg\" film in 2020. Cyborg is portrayed as a mechanical cyborg, hence the name. Cyborg will be part of the main cast of the upcoming \"Doom Patrol\" television series on the DC streaming service played by Joivan Wade.\nVictor Stone is the son of Silas Stone and Elinore Stone, scientists who use him as a test subject for various intelligence enhancement projects. While these treatments are ultimately successful and Victor's IQ subsequently grows to genius levels, he grows to resent his treatment. \n\nVictor strikes up a friendship with Ron Evers, a young miscreant who leads him into trouble with the law. This is the beginning of a struggle in which Victor strives for independence, engaging in pursuits of which his parents disapprove, such as athletics and abandoning his studies. Victor's association with underage criminals leads him down a dark path in which he is often injured, but he still lives a \"normal\" life in which he is able to make his own decisions. However, this rebellious path does not bury Victor's conscience considering that he refuses to participate in Evers' grandiose plans of racially motivated terrorism.\n\nVictor' situation changes radically when he visits his parents' lab where experiments in inter-dimensional access are done. At that moment of his entry, an aggressive gelatinous creature was accidentally pulled through and Victor's mother is killed by it. It then turned on Victor and he was severely injured by its attack before his father was able to send it back to its native dimension. \n\nWith his wife dead and his son mutilated, unconscious and near death from the incident, Silas is driven to taken advantage of prototype medical prosthetic research he has access to treat Victor. Unfortunately, Victor only regains consciousness after the extensive artificial limbs and implants were installed in his body without his consent. Victor was horrified at the discovery of the metallic components, which involve most of the left side of his head and face, and raged that he would rather have died than be such a victim of his father's manipulations. \n\nAlthough his bitterness remained for some time, Victor eventually calmed down enough to successfully adjust to his implants physically. He found himself found himself rejected by the public because of his implants, including his girlfriend, who would later thoughtlessly blurt out that she would prefer he had died instead of being in that state. However, Victor's conscience was unbowed, as evidenced by the fact that when Evers tried to manipulate him into participating in a terrorist attack on the United Nations, Victor decided to equip himself with his weaponized attachments and stop him on the top of United Nations Headquarters.\n\nWhen Raven assembles the Teen Titans, Victor joins initially for the benefit of a support group of kindred spirits and freaks, and has remained with that group ever since. Fortunately, Victor eventually finds additional new civilian friends of better character such as a group of juveniles who are adjusting to their own prosthetics and idolize him because of his fancy parts and his exciting adventures. It also turns out that their beautiful teacher Sarah Simms, who has often assisted Cyborg and the Titans, admires him as well.\n\nAnother person who sees past the cybernetic shell is Dr. Sarah Charles, a S.T.A.R. Labs scientist who helps him to recuperate after having his cybernetic parts replaced. Cyborg and Dr. Charles date for some time and she, along with Changeling, keeps trying to reach him when he is seemingly mindless following the severe injuries he incurs during the \"Titans Hunt\" storyline.\n\nAlthough Cyborg's body was repaired by a team of Russian scientists after the missile crash he had been in, albeit with more mechanical parts than previously, his mind was not. Eventually, his mind was restored by an alien race of computer intelligences called the Technis, created from the sexual union of Swamp Thing and a machine-planet when Swamp Thing was travelling through space. Cyborg, however, had to remain with the Technis both to maintain his mind and because, in return for restoring him, he had to teach them about humanity. He took the name Cyberion, and gradually started becoming less human in outlook, connecting entirely to the Technis planet.\n\nEventually, Cyberion returned to Earth, establishing a Technis construct on the moon and a smaller base on Earth. With Vic's consciousness dormant, but his desire for companionship controlling the actions of the Technis' planet, it began kidnapping former Titans members, his conscious mind so suppressed that he was not only searching for deceased Titans, but even sent one probe looking for himself as Cyborg. He ended up plugging them into virtual reality scenarios, representing what he believed to be their \"perfect worlds\"; for example, Beast Boy was back with the Doom Patrol, Damage was spending time being congratulated by the Justice Society as a true hero, and Nightwing was confronted by a Batman who actually smiled and offered to talk about their relationship. Although the Titans were freed, there was a strong disagreement between them and the Justice League over what action to take; the League believed that there was nothing left of Victor to save, whereas the Titans were willing to try, culminating in a brief battle, where the Atom and Catwoman (who had followed the Justice League to investigate) sided with the League while the Flash fought with the Titans. While Vic was distracted trying to aid his friends, a Titans team consisting of Changeling and the original five Titans were sent by Raven to try making contact with Vic's human side, while Superman, Wonder Woman, Green Lantern, the Martian Manhunter, Power Girl, Captain Marvel, and Mary Marvel moved the moon back to its proper place. Eventually, thanks primarily to Changeling's encouragement, and Omen and Raven holding Vic together long enough to come up with a plan, Vic's consciousness was restored, and \"downloaded\" into the Omegadrome, a morphing war-suit belonging to former Titan Minion. In the wake of this event, the Titans reformed and Vic was part of the new group. However, he felt less human than ever before.\n\nShortly after this, Nightwing revealed he had cloned Vic's body, and by flowing the Omegadrome through the clone, Vic regained his human form, but still had the abilities of the Omegadrome. He often used the Omegadrome to recreate his original look in battle. With his newfound humanity, Vic took a leave of absence, moving first to L.A. with Beast Boy and then to Central City. While in Central City, Vic was involved in one of the Thinker's schemes, helping Wally hack the Thinker's attempt to plug himself into the minds of Central City's population so that Wally could outthink his opponent, though Vic lost the abilities of the Omegadrome in the process.\n\nVic mentored the new incarnation of the Teen Titans, consisting mainly of sidekicks, most of whom have taken over the identities of former members (i.e. Tim Drake, the third Robin, instead of Dick Grayson, the original Robin and Titans leader), as well as stalwarts such as Starfire, Raven, and Beast Boy, where they have fought enemies such as Deathstroke, Brother Blood, Doctor Light, The Titans Tomorrow, and a brainwashed Superboy and Indigo during a team up with the Outsiders in the \"Insiders\" storyline. In the end, Cyborg was the only one capable of standing up to Dr. Light, thanks to his solar shields, although he makes it clear that he only won the fight because the rest of the Titans had softened Light up first.\n\nDuring the 2005–2006 storyline \"Infinite Crisis\", Cyborg joined Donna's New Cronus team that went to investigate a hole in the universe that was found during the \"Rann-Thanagar War\". He left Beast Boy in charge of the Titans while he was gone. They arrived at the reset center of the universe and with the help of assorted heroes aided in the defeat of Alexander Luthor, who was attempting to recreate the multiverse and build a perfect Earth from it.\n\nAccording to \"52\" Week 5, Cyborg was fused together with Firestorm after returning to Earth. This was caused by the energy ripples caused by Alexander Luthor Jr. which altered the Zeta Ray Beams the heroes were going to use to return home.\n\nAfter being severely damaged during the events of \"Infinite Crisis\", Cyborg was rebuilt over time in thanks to Tower caretakers Wendy and Marvin. He awoke a year later to find a wholly different being led by Robin, the only member from the team he formed prior to going into space. He is still a member of the team, but feels that Kid Devil and Ravager are hardly worthy Titans, and thus is attempting to find a way to reform \"the real Titans\".\n\nAfter the team along with the Doom Patrol defeated the Brotherhood of Evil, Cyborg asked Beast Boy to rejoin the Titans, but Gar refused, saying that his skills were needed with the Doom Patrol. After returning to Titans Tower, Cyborg began reviewing the security tapes during the last year, in which it appears that he was looked to by all the Titans of the past year for a shoulder to lean on, despite being in a coma-like state.\n\nIt appears that although Cyborg has returned to the team, the role of leader is now in the hands of Robin. He does however retain the position of statesman amongst the team and occasionally plays second-in-command.\n\nIn \"Justice League of America\" (vol. 2) #3, Batman, Wonder Woman, and Superman agree that Cyborg should be offered membership in the new Justice League. However, following a battle against Amazo, Green Lantern and Black Canary take over the formation of the JLA, and Cyborg is not amongst the roster.\n\nIn the \"Teen Titans East\" one-shot, Cyborg gathered together a new team of Titans. During a training exercise, the group was attacked by Trigon, and Cyborg was blasted by a giant energy beam. He was last seen in a crater, with only his head and torso remaining.\n\nIn the aftermath of Trigon's assault in the \"Titans East\" one shot, Cyborg has been placed into a special hoverchair while he recuperates. Cyborg's body is completely repaired in \"Titans\" #5. Soon after, the resurrected and unbalanced Jericho enters Cyborg's body, using him to manipulate the defenses at Titans Tower to kill the Teen Titans. Jericho's plans are foiled when Static, the newest Teen Titan, uses his electrical powers to overload the Tower's systems, causing feedback that knocks Jericho out of Cyborg. After recovering, Cyborg pretends to still have Jericho inside of him, in order to draw out Vigilante, who was currently targeting Jericho. The plot works too well when Vigilante appears and shoots Cyborg in the head.\n\nIn an unspecified time during the \"Teen Titans\" comics, a man with enhancements similar to Cyborg's attacks Dr. Sarah Charles on the day of her wedding to Deshaun, a young scientist. Cyborg rushes in for the save, discovering how Deshaun, connected to Project M, has sold the technology used to turn Stone into Cyborg to the military. He also finds that the enhanced man was Ron Evers, once Vic's best friend now turned terrorist, who was seeking vengeance for the soldiers used as test subjects. After Cyborg manages to calm down his friend and discovers the truth: Mr. Orr, revealed as the mastermind behind Project M's cyborg research, brings his Stone-derived best subjects: the current Equus, an armored form of the Wildebeest, and a cyberized man sporting enhancements even more powerful than Stone's current ones called Cyborg 2.0.\n\nCyborg 2.0 turns out to be the Titans Tomorrow Cyborg 2.0, snatched from his proper timeline and cajoled by Orr into fighting his younger self for the possession of their shared technology and Orr's permission to use it in the battlefield. Cyborg is soon forced to fight simultaneously against the Phantom Limbs, an elite force of soldiers crippled in the Middle East and restored by his tech, and the Cyborg Revenge Squad, a broader formation composed of the Fearsome Five, Magenta, Girder, the Thinker, and Cyborgirl. Although the Cyborg Revenge Squad soon gains the upper hand, with the help of his fellow Titans Cyborg is able to hold his own in combat, reverse engineer on the fly some of the future technology used by Cyborg 2.0, and enhance his own body enough to win against Mr. Orr. He later decides to get a new lease in life, forgiving Deshaun and Sarah Charles on their wedding day for abusing his technology, resuming dating Sarah Simms and having the Phantom Limbs fitted with new, non-military, prosthetics. It is however implied the Phantom Limbs, unwilling to see Stone's offer as a sign of good will, are trying to get back their weaponized prosthetics and wait for a rematch.\n\nDuring the events of \"Blackest Night\", Cyborg joins with Starfire, Beast Boy, and several other heroes to form an emergency team to fight off the army of dead Titans who have been reanimated as Black Lanterns. He later joins in the final battle at Coast City.\n\nFollowing the dissolution of the current JLA after \"\", Cyborg is invited by Donna to join Kimiyo Hoshi's new Justice League. He befriends Red Tornado, and claims that he has come up with a plan to make him indestructible.\n\nAfter a battle with Doctor Impossible's gang, Cyborg is forced to take a leave of absence from the team in order to not only help rebuild Red Tornado, but also help Roy Harper, who had his arm severed by Prometheus. During this time, Victor leads Superboy and Kid Flash to the city of Dakota to rescue the Teen Titans, who had been defeated and captured by Holocaust. The Titans emerge victorious from the battle after Kid Flash uses his powers to send Holocaust plummeting into the Earth's inner core.\n\nDespite apparently being written off the team, writer James Robinson explained that Cyborg will continue to have a presence on the JLA, and will even be given a co-feature in the back of the book for \"Justice League of America\" #48–50. In the co-feature, Cyborg battles Red Tornado after he has been driven insane by the power of the Starheart. In the midst of the battle, a flashback reveals that Victor had rebuilt Red Tornado using self-replicating nanites similar to the ones that Prometheus infected Roy with after cutting off his arm, thus making the android indestructible. Cyborg manages to free Red Tornado his power matrix.\n\nCyborg briefly appears in \"\", where he is shown helping Wonder Woman and Starfire search for Maxwell Lord after his resurrection.\n\nFollowing an adventure in another dimension, Static is left powerless, and Miss Martian is rendered comatose. Cyborg stops the powerless Static from returning to Dakota, and instead tells him that he and a scientist named Rochelle Barnes will be taking him to Cadmus Labs to find a way to get his powers back and awaken Miss Martian. As Static packs up his belongings, Cyborg and Rochelle have a conversation which reveals that they are lying to Static, and have an ulterior motive for taking the two Titans to Cadmus.\n\nHe later appears in the final two issues of \"The Return of Bruce Wayne\", where he helps his former teammate Red Robin in his attempt to stop Bruce Wayne from inadvertently unleashing an apocalyptic explosion of Omega Energy.\n\nCyborg and Red Tornado later travel to the moon alongside Doctor Light, Animal Man, Congorilla, Zauriel, Tasmanian Devil and Bulleteer as part of an emergency group of heroes gathered to assist the Justice League in their battle against Eclipso. Shortly into the battle, Cyborg and the others are taken over by Eclipso and are turned against their JLA comrades. The reserve JLA members are all freed after Eclipso is defeated.\n\nAs of August 2011, Cyborg is featured as one of the main characters in a new Justice League ongoing series written by Geoff Johns and drawn by Jim Lee as part of DC's The New 52 relaunch. Johns has said of Cyborg, \"He represents all of us in a lot of ways. If we have a cellphone and we're texting on it, we are a cyborg—that's what a cyborg is, using technology as an extension of ourselves.\"\n\nThe first storyline takes place five years in the past and details the revised origin of the original Justice League. Victor Stone appears as a high school football star who is heavily sought after by a number of college scouts, but apparently has a distant relationship with his father, Silas. After winning a big game, Victor is shown calling his father and angrily telling him that he broke his promise and missed yet another one of his son's games. Later Victor appears at S.T.A.R. Labs where his father works. The scientists appear to be working on the Mother Box that Superman came in contact with from the Parademon. Victor engages in another argument with his father and tells him that the scouts were there to give him full scholarships to college. When asking if his father will ever appear at any of his games, his father replies \"No.\" Just then the Mother Box explodes, killing the other scientists and destroying most of Victor's body while Victor's father looks on in horror. Silas does everything he can for Victor's survival. He along with Sarah Charles, and T. O. Morrow go in \"The Red Room\" in S.T.A.R. labs which contains every piece of technology from around the world. Silas attempts to treat Victor with something that has never been attempted before and he is seen injecting Victor with some type of nanites and having Dr. Morrow put the robotic pieces on Victor (devices such as: a Promethean skin graft, Doctor William Magnus' responsometer, Anthony Ivo's A-maze operating system, The classified and prototypical B-maze operating system and Ryan Choi's White Dwarf Stabilizer). Vic's life is saved and the energies from the motherbox are incorporated into his new form as Cyborg. This allows Victor to access the vast New Gods data library and discover Darkseid's true invasion plans.\n\nIn the following issue we see Victor as Cyborg. As the issue opens Victor cannot feel his hands or legs. He sees himself for the first time with his robotic parts and is panicked by his new body. Suddenly, Parademons burst into the red room and leap toward Sarah Charles. However, Cyborg's defense systems react, automatically weaponizing his arm into a sound cannon from which he fires his powerful white noise cannon, disintegrating the two Parademons and blasting a gigantic hole in the Star Labs building. After saving Sarah's life Victor asks his father what has happened to him, his father tells him that he couldn't let him die. Cyborg obviously distraught exclaims, \"You did this to me.\" and flees, despite Silas' plea for him to wait. Later in the street Cyborg sees a woman being set upon by a group of Parademons. He leaps to the woman's aid, punching the parademon. However, in ensuing scuffle Cyborg inadvertently absorbs some of the Parademon's components giving him access to Boom Tube technology. This new ability automatically transports or teleports Victor to where Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, Flash, Green Lantern, and Aquaman are fighting the Parademons, moments before Darkseid arrives. Cyborg fights alongside the other heroes against Darkseid and his Parademons, but despite their best efforts Darkseid proves to be too strong. Cyborg is able to reverse engineer the alien boom tube technology and with a considerable amount of stress on his systems he is able to teleport all the invading aliens including Darkseid off the planet, saving the Earth. After sending Darkseid back where he came from, Cyborg helps to found the Justice League.\n\nVictor has not begun any process of reconciliation with his father, who is primarily concerned with Victor's mechanics rather than his humanity. Cyborg primarily focuses on his super-heroics, aiding Batman and others when he can and monitoring crime through his cybernetics. After the villain David Graves makes an attack against the Justice League, Cyborg and his teammates travel to the Valley of Souls. There he learns that he walks the line between life and death. He sees a false apparition of his human self that tries to convince him that Victor Stone is dead and Cyborg is just an imitation. Victor quickly sees past this ruse, and he and the rest of the Justice League defeat Graves. We learn through a conversation with Flash, that Cyborg questions his humanity now that he is part machine and that he lives on the Watch Tower, the Justice League's headquarters. Flash cracks a joke in an attempt to lighten the mood and assure Cyborg he is still human. During the Throne of Atlantis storyline, Cyborg at first rejects an upgrade his father has that would allow him to operate underwater at the price of his remaining lung which to him would mean sacrificing more of his humanity. However following the capture of the rest of the Justice League by Orm who sentenced them to the bottom of the ocean, Cyborg—as he calls in reserves to hold off Orm's forces—reluctantly accepts the upgrade. This allows him and Mera to rescue the others.\n\nDuring the \"Trinity War\" storyline, Cyborg gets a visual of Shazam heading to Kahndaq, to which Batman assembles the Justice League with the help from Zatanna to meet in Kahndaq to stop Shazam. Following the supposed death of Doctor Light in Kahndaq, Batman tells Superman that Cyborg and Martian Manhunter are doing an autopsy to prove his death was not Superman's fault. As Wonder Woman leads the Justice League Dark to go look for Pandora, Cyborg is among the superheroes that remain at A.R.G.U.S. while Batman, Flash, Aquaman, Shazam, Steve Trevor, the Justice League of America, Zatanna, and Phantom Stranger go to stop Wonder Woman. Cyborg was present when Atom tells him, Superman, Element Woman and Firestorm the true purpose of the creation of the Justice League of America and that she was spying on the Justice League which is how the Justice League of America ended up in Kahndaq. When the Crime Syndicate arrives on Prime Earth, Cyborg's old prosthetic parts combine to form a robot called Grid (who is operated by a sentient computer virus). During the Forever Evil event, after Batman and Catwoman drop Cyborg off to his father in Detroit, he makes the choice to willingly receive a new cybernetic body and helps his father and Dr. Morrow create one that is slimmer in appearance so Cyborg could look more human. Working together with the Metal Men created by Doc Magus, Cyborg succeeds in shutting down Grid.\nAfterwards Cyborg helped newcomer to the group Shazam fit in with the league as the rest set out to find Power ring's missing accessory which flew off after the death of the former wearer. While on monitor duty he and Shazam experiment with some of his magical powers to aid in finding the ring after joking of having an Xbox in his left shoulder; only for the young ward to conjure up a ping pong table, which they play while having spare time on their hands. Eventually the call goes out and everyone in the league mobilizes to secure the new rampaging Power Ring before the Doom Patrol does. After coaxing Billy into action against Jessica Cruis, Victor moves in to interface with the ring itself, finding out a great deal about the ring of Volthoom and his current host, only to be forcefully thrown out after the ring entity rejects him by causing his systems to short circuit, removing him from the battle. He is last seen recovering at S.T.A.R. Labs, after Shazam rushed him to the med bay, following the power ring crisis. Cyborg wondered what he saw within the ring, after his dad warned him interfacing with it again could trap him in it forever.\n\nAn incident involving Batman's son, Damian Wayne, during the \"Robin Rises Alpha & Omega\" story arc in Batman, led up to most of the justice League battling against Glorious Godfrey and a Parademon horde from Apokolips when they captured the chaos shard and the sarcophagus of Damian, before retreating back home. All the league members present, Cyborg included, state to an adamant Bruce Wayne that running headlong into unmarked X-factor territory for a suicide mission was less than ideal, considering the consequences that could befall earth. This eventually culminates with Batman hijacking Cyborg's teleportation systems, to zip up to the Watchtower in an attempt to retrieve an experimental and highly dangerous combat suit, in order to mete out his agenda; But Cyborg manages to block his administrative access so that he, Shazam, Aquaman, Wonder Woman, Lex and Cold could physically restrain him, causing Batman to begrudgingly give up and retire to the batcave.\n\nAfter the Bat left, the rest of the Bat Family turned up asking Victor for help with some digitized doppelgangers of baddies that Bruce initially set up in order to distract the League, destabilize watchtower security to secure the Hellbat, and eventually use a personal Mother Box (secured from a Parademon kept in cold storage) to vacate to Apokolips. After making his way to the Batcave to meet with them, he's directed over to a console which enabled him to directly access the Batcomputer's more sophisticated systems. However, it was all a ruse utilizing a preemptive countermeasure devised by Batman tailored to Cyborg's specific weaknesses. Cyborg was temporarily incapacitated and was set into a VR simulation where he relived his more peaceful days in college, while Batgirl went to work on his Motherbox in order to secure a path towards Apokolips and chase after their father. But Victor eventually snapped out of his dream haze and followed them through, angered that they used him in such a way. Cyborg traveled along with Titus, who hitched a ride on his leg, to catch up with the rest of the Batman Family. They all then have a run in with the scavengers of Armegeddo who quickly vacate after some Apokoliptian Hunger Dogs make their way onto the scene. They eventually catch up with the armor-clad Dark Knight ripping his way through a sizable chunk of Apokolips's forces singlehandedly. Jason Tim and Barbara show Batman the Robin Medals Alfred gave them in order to remind him of his purpose, causing him to snap out of his berserker rage and note that Cyborg had reluctantly accompanied them to Hell itself. Having made their way into Darkseid's citadel where Kalibak was readying his Chaos Cannon to fire again, the caped crusaders kept Darkseid's forces occupied while Cyborg made short work of the massive war engine, literally tearing it in half. But when he went to set a timed self-destruct sequence within the Apokoliptian computers, Vic suffered a catastrophic feedback that fried most of his internal systems leaving him inoperable just as Darkseid himself made his appearance.\n\nWhile Batman fought and held Darkseid off, Cyborg ran Batgirl through a crash course on how to hot wire his own Motherbox. Since Darkseid smashed Batman's Boom Tube generator, Cyborg was their only chance off Apokolips. After successfully jury-rigging his internal systems, Cyborg and the rest of the Bat rogues made a hasty exit stage left as Bruce powered his recovered fragment of the Chaos Shard with Darkseid's Omega Effect, blasting Darkseid against a wall to cover their escape. In the aftermath, Cyborg, who is still unable to facilitate himself, wonders what is going on as Damian Wayne is successfully revived, however a second anomaly cranks out of the Boom Tube that was opened and Kalibak comes charging through it. With Kalibak occupied by the rest of the gang, Vic tries his best to reestablish his downed systems. He is successful and gains control over the still-open tube as Batman readies the Batplane. As Batman rams his jet into the evil New God sending him careening back to Apokolips, Cyborg closes the portal banishing Darksied's first born for good. With the threat over, Cyborg heads back topside to inform the rest of the league of what all transpired and stating he has JL business to attend to.\n\nAn eponymous ongoing series, by writer David F. Walker and artist Ivan Reis, debuted in July 2015.\n\nAs of Rebirth, he is a part of the relaunched Justice League bi-monthly series as well as his own solo monthly series. It is unclear whether he has the ability of flight in Rebirth.\n\nDuring \"Dark Nights: Metal\", he is captured by the alternate Batmen of the Dark Multiverse, who attempt to hack him in order to learn the secrets of his teammates. As the crisis escalates, Cyborg is confronted by the controlling consciousness of other Mother Boxes, who claim that he will only gain the power to overcome the Dark Batmen if he fully surrenders to the Mother Box that powers his body at the cost of the transformation deleting his old personality. He is nearly tempted to give in to this transformation, but the appearance of Raven's soul-self convinces him to hold on to himself while partially succumbing to the transformation. This allows him to free his teammates and 'hack' the multiverse as they travel to find new allies in the battle against the Dark Batmen.\n\nFollowing this and the Justice League: No Justice miniseries, the Justice League series was cancelled after 43 issues and was relaunched into a new monthly series and Cyborg will also be featured as part of a separate Justice League faction that is part of the new Justice League Odyssey series. In addition, Cyborg's own solo monthly series was also cancelled and ended in June 2018 with the release of Issue 23.\n\nLarge portions of Victor Stone's body have been replaced by advanced mechanical parts (hence the name Cyborg), granting him superhuman strength, speed, stamina, and flight. His mechanically-enhanced body, much of which is metallic, is far more durable than a normal human body. Cyborg's internal computer system can interface with external computers. Other features include an electronic 'eye' which replicates vision, but at a superhuman level. His mechanical parts contain a wide variety of tools and weapons, such as a grappling hook/line and a finger-mounted laser. Perhaps his most frequently-used weapon is his sound amplifier (often referred to as his \"white sound blaster\" in the comic books; the \"Teen Titans\" animated series calls it a \"sonic cannon\"), which can be employed at various settings either to stun the ears of his foes or to deliver concentrated blasts of sound potent enough to shatter rock or deform steel.\n\nIn addition to his mechanical enhancements, Stone possesses an \"exceptionally gifted\" level of intelligence; his IQ has been measured at 170.\n\nCyborg has tinkered over time with his cybernetic parts, enhancing his functions and abilities to levels beyond those set by his father. One feature that sets him apart from the \"mass production\" version built by Project M is a self-repair system, able to flawlessly repair the mechanical parts of his body, no matter how worn out they are, and even improve the health of the still biological parts to an unknown degree.\n\nCyborg's New 52 (DCnU) functions\n\nCyborg possesses cybernetic enhancements that provide superhuman strength, endurance and durability. Cyborg can also interface with computers. Built into his body-armor are an infrared eye with HUD, a bionic ear that allows him to hear sounds from long distance, computer generator, sound amplifier (similar to a sonic cannon), and special programming adapters that allow him to interface with other body extensions. This enhances his durability, strength, speed, and endurance. He also has multiple sensors, and can fly via rocket boosters. While he can use Boom Tubes, he usually use Jump Jets to help him leap great distances. His body can also absorb technology at will, as well as control technology and shift his body. He can also emit an EMP blast to disable any electrical devices within a fifty-meter radius, codenamed the \"Heart Attack\". His body uses the Grid, a program Vic and Batman created to help him better manage the constant flow of uploading and downloading data he receives on a constant basis; it acts as his solipisistic engram into the Cyberverse/Digitalverse where he can better prioritize and interface with the worldwide networking system, focusing on high-priority items and filter out other received data. As part of the events of the Throne of Atlantis Aquaman crossover, Cyborg's lungs were replaced by cybernetic lungs that allow him to breathe underwater. His body can also regenerate from damage, and he can enhance his strength.\n\nAfter he lost his original cybernetic enhancements which became Grid at the end of the Trinity War arc, during the Forever Evil event, he has his father Silas Stone and Dr. Morrow help create a new cybernetic body. As explained in that issue, by cutting down on strength, speed, and stamina, Cyborg's new cybernetic body looks slimmer in appearance as Victor describes looking more human compared to looking like a tank. It is unknown whether or not Cyborg had re-integrated the technology stripped from him after Grid's defeat. After a run in with alternate universe invaders calling themselves the \"Techbreakers\", Cyborg's systems had undergone a complete systems overhaul causing a new operating system to come online restoring him to life and healing his damaged circuitry as well as reintegrating his ruined flesh into it, turning him into a full on techno-organic being.\n\nIn the \"Flashpoint\" event, the timeline is greatly altered. In this alternate version of events, Cyborg is America's greatest superhero (occupying the role held by Superman in DC's standard timeline). He attempts to put together a group to stop the war between Aquaman and Wonder Woman's forces. However, the heroes he approaches all refuse, after Batman declines. Cyborg connects the resistance member Lois Lane to spy on the Amazons for any information. Cyborg rescues people in the subway station from arsonist Heat Wave. Abin Sur crashes on Earth; he is subsequently taken into custody by Cyborg and the US government to be questioned about his reasons for being on Earth. When Abin Sur is recovering, he is on a mission to retrieve the Entity, however Cyborg convinces him to join with Earth's heroes. Afterwards, Cyborg is seen talking with the President in his headquarters in Detroit. The President states that Steve Trevor sent a signal to the resistance but was intercepted by a traitor among the heroes that Cyborg tried to recruit and suspicion leads to the Outsider. For Cyborg's failure, he is relieved of duty as the Element Woman sneaks into the headquarters. Later, Cyborg is called by Batman and the Flash for help in tracking down \"Project: Superman\", the government branch responsible for 'raising' Kal-El after his rocket destroyed Metropolis upon its arrival. Cyborg and them agree to join the cause to stop Wonder Woman and Aquaman, but only if Batman gets to choose who to recruit, and Cyborg agrees as long as he comes with them. The three sneak into the government underground bunkers, and the group comes across a giant vault door bearing the Superman logo. Cyborg opens the door and sees a weakened Kal-El, with the arrival of guards. Forced to escape, Kal-El's powers begin to manifest and flies off leaving them at the hands of the guards. While they are fending off the guards, they are rescued by Element Woman. Later, Cyborg and other heroes arrive at the Marvel Family's place helping the Flash from drastically forgetting his memories. After the Flash is recovering, he asked to stop the Atlantean/Amazon war from casualty, although Cyborg and the heroes are not willing unless Batman wants to join them, because Cyborg explains to him that they believe Batman was invincible. However, the Flash convinces him that no one is invincible and the group of heroes are agreeing to join the Flash. The heroes arrive at New Themyscira to stop the Atlantean/Amazon war, and the Flash tells Cyborg to find Aquaman's ultimate bomb to dispose of it.\n\nIn the \"Titans Tomorrow\" storyline, a future version of Victor Stone called Cyborg 2.0 is a member of Titans East. He is shown having similar plating as the animated Cyborg from the \"Teen Titans\" animated series.\n\nAn alternate version of Cyborg appears as part of the Justice League of Earth-23 in the DC Multiverse.\n\nCyborg appears as the third Robotman as part of Superman's Justice League. Robotman is now completely liquid metal. He is petrified by the nuclear blast.\n\nCyborg appears as a character in the prequel comic to , where he joins Superman's Regime to force peace on the world. He serves as Superman's eyes and ears over the world, offering insight on any activity deemed disruptive. At the end of Year Two he discovers someone is trying to hack into the Regime's system during a war with the Green Lantern Corps (Oracle) and goes to the Watchtower to locate her. Jim Gordon follows and corners him, managing to rip Cyborg's metallic face plate off and knock him unconscious, stopping the locating sequence. Cyborg spends most of the next year a prisoner of the Insurgency until he is released when the two groups collide in a battle that nearly destroys them when Trigon and Mr. Mxyzptlk get involved. In Year Four he and the Regime are confronted by the Greek Gods, who want Superman to step down as ruler. While the Regime is forced to go underground, they come together to defeat the gods once and for all. During Year Five tension grows among the Regime because of Superman's growing hostility and controversial decisions, such as enlisting the aid of villains to help the Regime. Cyborg is especially disgusted when he discovers that during a rally with supporters of the Joker who reject Superman, the Man of Steel killed over two hundred defenseless protesters in anger. Batman and Batwoman later go to the Hall of Justice to kidnap Cyborg because he is the only one aware of this and has the information stored in his data. He is incapacitated and taken underground to the ruins of Metropolis where Batgirl works to find the data and reveal to the world. While they succeed in finding it, Raven casts a massive black out over the world to prevent the video from being seen, and the Insurgency is forced to retreat before Flash comes to get Cyborg. Superman has Cyborg erase any data containing information on his killings so the incident will not repeat itself.\n\nCyborg appears in a prequel comic to the sequel game. He remained in prison with Superman, even after the League of Assassins and impostor Batman's Suicide Squad raid the Ryker's Island to free only Damian Wayne/the current Nightwing.\n\n\n\n\nCyborg appears in the DC Extended Universe (DCEU), played by Ray Fisher. He first appears in \"\" in a brief sequence of footage that is viewed by Wonder Woman. The footage depicts Cyborg's origin story. Cyborg, played by Fisher, makes a full appearance as one of the main characters in \"Justice League\", released on November 17, 2017. Fisher is scheduled to reprise the role in upcoming DCEU films – a stand-alone Flash film and a sequel to \"Justice League\".

The bodies of the three brothers were discovered in July 2001 in a mass grave containing 70 Albanians in rural Petrovo Selo, Serbia, near a Serbian police facility. The bodies were found with their hands bound and with gunshot wounds to their heads. The indictment against the alleged perpetrators says the brothers were brought to the edge of the pit and shot in the head, causing them to slump into a mass grave atop 70 corpses dumped there earlier.\n\nAgron (23), Mehmet (21) and Ylli (25) were American citizens of Kosovo Albanian origin born near Chicago, Illinois and living in New York City. After the rebellion started in Kosovo they decided to go to Kosovo and fight in KLA's “Atlantic Brigade”.\n\nIn July 1999, and immediately after the NATO aggression to the then Federal Republic of Yugoslavia ended and the Kumanovo Agreement was signed, they helped their neighbors – а Roma family from Prizren (Kosovo) – to return to Kraljevo, from where they escaped during the war. Due to a violation of the Law on Movement and Residence of Foreigners, they were arrested along the transit between Kosovo and Serbia. They were sentenced to 15 days in prison. Twelve days later after appealing, they were released. Their neighbour Miroslav waited to collect them, but the brothers were instead collected by two men driving a white car with no license plates. They were taken to the MUP Special anti-terrorism unit (SAJ) base. Two days later, they were killed with bullets fired to the back of their heads and buried in a mass grave which already contained the bodies of the massacred Kosovo Albanians.\n\nSerbian authorities showed little interest to investigate cases where Serbian police has acted during the war in Kosovo, but since the brothers were American citizens and due to the pressure from US authorities, an investigation was launched. The United States saw the murder of the Bytyqi brothers as a premeditated crime committed against its citizens; the FBI (Federal Bureau of Investigation) started an investigation while the US Embassy in Belgrade monitored the case carefully.\n\nThe main suspect was Vlastimir Đordević, head of MUP’s Public Security and Serbia's assistant minister for internal affairs during the Kosovo war. Đordevic was the commander of the MUP forces in Kosovo in the early 1980s, and one of the most trusted men of Yugoslav president Slobodan Milošević. In July 1999, Miloševic awarded Đordevic the Medal of the Yugoslav Flag of the First Degree. He was forced into retirement in May 2001, when the cold storage truck containing the bodies of Kosovo Albanians was discovered in the Danube. Đordevic is also wanted by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia. Before the investigation started, Đordevic relocated to Moscow, Russia and since refuses to return. Then Yugoslav Minister of Internal Affairs, Vlajko Stojiljković, allegedly originated the orders.\n\nThe killing of Bytyqi brothers is still being investigated by Serbia's War Crimes Court. Two low-ranking police figures who may have marginally abetted the crimes, Milos Stojanović and Sreten Popović, were acquitted of all charges of aiding war crimes in March 2013 because of their marginal involvement in the Bytyqi murders.\n\nIn mid-February 2007, the police issued the warrant for Goran Radosavljević, known by his nom de guerre \"Guri\", after he failed to show up at a trial of Milos Stojanović and Sreten Popović. According to the Serbian media, Radosavljevic left Serbia in 2006. Radosavljević was in charge of the police training facility where the brothers were illegally detained, executed, and dumped into a mass grave. Radosavljević eventually returned to Serbia and testified in the trial, claiming that he was away on vacation at the time of the Bytyqi brothers' detainment and murders.\n\nFour more officers were detained in late February as the investigation about who exactly ordered and carried out the executions continues. Milenko Arsenijevic, commander of an elite special police unit and three police officers. None were ever charged.\n\nIn March 2007, the US Embassy in Belgrade said the U.S. Department of Justice will continue to conduct its own investigation pursuant to U.S. law.\n\nIn a 2012 trial in Serbia two men were found not guilty in aiding in the death of the brothers, in part because of their marginal involvement in the crimes.\n\nIn a 2013 prosecutor appeal of the not guilty verdict the acquittals were upheld.\n\nAs of May 2014, there are no pending charges in the case and no high-ranking official has been seriously investigated for his or her involvement.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "693320", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=693320", "title": "Dismemberment", "text": "Dismemberment\n\nDismemberment is the act of cutting, tearing, pulling, wrenching or otherwise removing the limbs of a living thing. It has been practised upon human beings as a form of capital punishment, especially in connection with regicide, but can occur as a result of a traumatic accident, or in connection with murder, suicide, or cannibalism. As opposed to surgical amputation of the limbs, dismemberment is often fatal to all but the simplest of creatures. In criminology, a distinction is made between offensive and defensive dismemberment. Intentional, criminal dismemberment is known as \"mayhem\".\n\nParticularly in South-Eastern Asia, execution by trained elephants was a form of capital punishment practiced for several centuries. The techniques by which the convicted person was actually executed varied widely but did, on occasion, include the elephant dismembering the victim by means of sharp blades attached to its feet. The Muslim traveller Ibn Battuta, visiting Delhi in the 1330s, has left the following eyewitness account of this particular type of execution by elephants:\n\n\nIn the Holy Roman Empire emperor Charles V's 1532 Constitutio Criminalis Carolina specifies how \"every\" dismemberment (quartering) should ideally occur:\nThus, the imperially approved way to dismember the convict within the Holy Roman Empire was by means of \"cutting\", rather than dismemberment through \"ripping\" the individual apart. In paragraph 124 of the same code, beheading prior to quartering is mentioned as allowable when extenuating circumstances are present, whereas aggravating circumstances may allow pinching/ripping the criminal with glowing pincers, prior to quartering.\n\nThe fate of Wilhelm von Grumbach in 1567, a maverick knight in the Holy Roman Empire who was fond of making his own private wars and was thus condemned for treason, is also worthy of note. Gout-ridden, he was carried to the execution site in a chair and bound fast to a table. The executioner then ripped out his heart, and stuck it in von Grumbach's face with the words: \"von Grumbach! Behold your false heart!\" Afterwards, the executioner quartered von Grumbach's body. His principal associate was given the same treatment, and an eyewitness avers (confirms) that \"after\" his heart had been ripped out, Chancellor Brück screamed horribly for \"quite some time\".\n\nOne example of a highly aggravated execution is illustrated by the fate of Bastian Karnhars on 16 July 1600. Karnhars was found guilty of 52 separate acts of murder, including the rape and murder of 8 women, and the murder of a child, whose heart he had allegedly eaten for rituals of black magic. To begin, Karnhars had three strips of flesh torn from his back, before being pinched 18 times with glowing pincers, having his fingers clipped off one by one, his arms and legs broken on the wheel, and finally, while still alive, quartered.\nIn the seventeenth century, a number of travel reports speak of an exotic \"Turkish\" execution method, where first, the waist of a man was constricted by ropes and cords, and then a swift bisection of the trunk was performed. William Lithgow presents a comparatively prosaic description of the method:\n\nGeorge Sandys, however, during the same period, tells of a method as no longer in use, in a rather more mythologized way:\n\nIn 1850s Persia, a particular dismemberment technique called \"shekkeh\" is reported to have been used. Travelling as an official for the East India Company Robert Binning describes it as follows:\n\nDismemberment was a form of capital punishment for convicts of high treason in the Korean kingdom of the Joseon Dynasty. This punishment was, for example, meted out to Hwang Sa-Yong in 1801.\nThe Five Pains is a Chinese variation invented during the Qin dynasty. During the Tang dynasty (618-907 CE), truncation of the body at the waist by means of a fodder knife was a death penalty reserved for those who were seen to have done something particularly treacherous or repugnant. That practice of cutting in two did not originate in the Tang dynasty; in sources concerning the Han dynasty (206 BCE-220 CE), no less than 33 cases of execution by cutting at the waist are mentioned, but occurs very rarely in earlier material.\n\nDismemberment is no longer used by most modern governments as a form of execution or torture, though amputation is still carried out in countries that practice Sharia law.\n\nDismemberment was carried out in the Medieval and Early Modern era and could be effected, for example, by tying a person's limbs to chains or other restraints, then attaching the restraints to separate movable entities (e.g. vehicles) and moving them in opposite directions.\n\nAlso referred to as \"disruption\" or being \"drawn and quartered\", dismemberment could be brought about by chaining four horses to the condemned's arms and legs, thus making them pull him apart, as was the case with the executions of François Ravaillac in 1610 and Robert-François Damiens in 1757. Ravaillac's extended torture and execution has been described like this: \nIn the case of Damiens, he was condemned to essentially the same fate as Ravaillac, but the execution did not quite work according to plan, as the eyewitness Giacomo Casanova could relate: \n\nAs late as in 1781, this gruesome punishment was meted out to the Peruvian rebel leader Túpac Amaru II by the Spanish colonial authorities. The following is an extract from the official judicial death sentence issued by the Spanish authorities which condemns Túpac Amaru II to torture and death. It was ordered in the sentence that Túpac Amaru II be condemned to have his tongue cut out, after watching the executions of his family, and to have his hands and feet tied... \n\nQueen Brunhilda of Austrasia, executed in 613, is generally regarded to have suffered the same death, though one account has it that she was tied to the tail of a single horse and thus suffered more of a dragging death. The Liber Historiae Francorum, an eighth century chronicle, describes her death by dismemberment as follows:\nThe story of Brunhilda being tied to the tail of a \"single\" horse (and then to die in some gruesome manner) is promoted, for example, by Ted Byfield (2003), in which he writes: \"Then they tied her to the tail of a wild horse; whipped into frenzy, it kicked her to death\" The cited source for this claim, however, the seventh century \"Life of St. Columban\" by the monk Jonas, does not support this claim. In paragraph 58 in his work, Jonas just writes: \"..but Brunhilda he had placed first on a camel in mockery and so exhibited to all her enemies round about then she was bound to the tails of wild horses and thus perished wretchedly\"\n\nThe storyline of Brunhilde being tied to the tail of a single horse and being subsequently \"dragged\" to death has become a classical motif in artistic representations, as can be seen by the included image.\n\nAccording to Olfert Dapper, a 17th-century Dutchman who meticulously collected reports from faraway countries from seamen and other travelers, a fairly frequent maritime death penalty among the corsairs on the Barbary coast was to affix the hands and feet to chains on four different ships. When the ships then sailed off in different directions, the chains grew taut, and the man in between was torn apart after a while.\n\nRoman military discipline could be extremely severe, and the emperor Aurelian (r. 270–275 CE), who had a reputation for extreme strictness, instituted the rule that soldiers who seduced the wives of their hosts should have their legs fastened to two bent-down trees, which were then released, ripping the man in two. Similarly, in an unsuccessful rebellion against the emperor Valens in 366 CE, the usurper Procopius met the same fate.\n\nAfter the defeat of Darius III by Alexander the Great, the Persian monarchy was thrown into turmoil, and Darius was killed. One man, Bessus, claimed the throne as Artaxerxes V, but in 329 BCE, Alexander had him executed. The manner of Bessus' death is rather disputed, and Waldemar Heckel writes:\nThe method of tying people to bent down trees, which are then allowed to recoil, ripping the individual to pieces in the process is, however, mentioned by several travelers to nineteenth century Persia. The British diplomat James Justinian Morier travelled as a special envoy to the Shah in 1808, and Morier writes the following concerning then prevailing criminal justice:\n\nAn obscure Christian martyr, Severianus was, about the year 300 AD, martyred in the following way, according to one tale: One stone was fastened to his head, another bound to his feet. His middle was then fastened by a rope to the top of a wall, and the stones released from the height. His body was ripped apart.\n\nDuring the reign of the Roman Emperor Diocletian a Christian named Shamuna was, allegedly, torn apart in the following manner:\nSome time thereafter, Shamuna was taken down from his hanging position, and was beheaded instead.\n\nThere are many instances of dismemberment in murder cases. Examples of victims include Bernard Oliver, Bill Nelson, Jana Claudia Gómez Menéndez, Jessica Ridgeway, Becky Watts, Ingrid Lyne, Jamal Khashoggi and Kim Wall. Serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer is also known to have dismembered and cannibalized his victims.\n\n\nDismemberment has been portrayed in many films; although a few are depictions of historical or actual events, a significant number are within the horror genre. Filmmakers can be quite innovative in the methods depicted, and thus reflect the public's fear and fascination with this method of torture, homicide, and/or body disposal. The following movies portray or imply dismemberment in some form; exceptional methods or motives are described.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Lady Cumming collected and studied Devonian fish fossils from the Old Red Sandstone of Morayshire, Scotland. She amassed a large and well-known collection which she illustrated, along with her daughter Lady Anne Seymour. Lady Cumming worked with other palaeontologists and geologists of the time including Louis Agassiz, William Buckland and Roderick Murchison.\n\nLady Cumming was born Eliza Maria Campbell in 1795 in Inveraray to Lady Charlotte Campbell (later Lady Charlotte Bury) and Colonel John Campbell. Her mother was a diarist and novelist and father a soldier and politician. \n\nLady Cumming was a skilled painter and keen horticulturalist who took up the study of the fossils on her Altyre estate near the Moray Firth around 1839. She collected fossils and instructed workers in the quarries on the estate to bring her any they found. She collected a large number of specimens of fossil fish from the Devonian period and began a correspondence with the most famous geologists of the time; Louis Agassiz, William Buckland and Roderick Murchison all visited her collection in Scotland. She sent illustrations, letters and specimens around Europe, and intended to publish her illustrations and theories on how these fish would have appeared in life. Some of these illustrations survive in the archives of the Geological Society. Some of her ideas about how the fossil remains should be interpreted were later discredited as more fossil evidence came to light, but her illustrations were highly respected.

{"id": "146699", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=146699", "title": "Fine (penalty)", "text": "Fine (penalty)\n\nA fine or mulct is money that a court of law or other authority decides has to be paid as punishment for a crime or other offence. The amount of a fine can be determined case by case, but it is often announced in advance.\n\nThe most usual use of the term is for financial punishments for the commission of crimes, especially minor crimes, or as the settlement of a claim. A synonym, typically used in civil law actions, is mulct.\n\nOne common example of a fine is money paid for violations of traffic laws. Currently in English common law, relatively small fines are used either in place of or alongside community service orders for low-level criminal offences. Larger fines are also given independently or alongside shorter prison sentences when the judge or magistrate considers a considerable amount of retribution is necessary, but there is unlikely to be significant danger to the public. For instance, fraud is often punished by very large fines since fraudsters are typically banned from the position or profession they abused to commit their crimes.\n\nFines can also be used as a form of tax. Money for bail may be applied toward a fine.\n\nA day-fine is a fine that, above a minimum, is based on personal income.\n\nSome fines are small, such as for loitering, for which fines range from about $25 to $100. In some areas of the United States (for example California, New York, Texas, and Washington D.C.), fines for petty crimes, such as criminal mischief (shouting in public places, projecting an object at a police car) range from $2500 to $5000.\n\nIn the Magistrates' Courts Act 1980, unless the context otherwise requires, the expression \"fine\", except for the purposes of any enactment imposing a limit on the amount of any fine, includes any pecuniary penalty or pecuniary forfeiture or pecuniary compensation payable under a conviction.\n\nIn section 32 of that Act, the expression \"fine\" includes a pecuniary penalty but does not include a pecuniary forfeiture or pecuniary compensation.\n\nIn sections 15 to 32 and 48 of the Criminal Law Act 1977, the expression \"fine\" includes any pecuniary penalty.\n\nIn England, there is now a system whereby the court gives the offender a 'fine card' which is somewhat like a credit card; at any shop that has a paying-in machine he pays the value of the fine to the shop, which then uses the fine card to pass that money on to the court's bank account.\n\nA related concept is the fixed penalty notice, a pecuniary penalty for some minor crimes that can be either accepted (instead of prosecution, thus saving time and paperwork, or taken to court for normal proceedings for that crime. While technically not a fine, which, under the Bill of Rights 1689, may be levied only following a conviction, it serves the same purpose of punishment.\n\nEarly examples of fines include the weregild or blood money payable under Anglo-Saxon common law for causing a death. The murderer would be expected to pay a sum of money or goods dependent on the social status of the victim.\n\nSee also English criminal law#General power to impose a fine on indictment.\n\nThe Dutch Criminal Code \"(Dutch: Wetboek van Strafrecht (WvSr))\" doesn't contain specific amounts for fines for every violation of the law. Instead of that the Criminal Code provides six fine categories. Every penalty clause of the Criminal Code contains a fine category. The categories are:\n\nThese sums are only an upper limit, it's up to the judge or the prosecutor to determine the exact sum of the fine. However, the amount of the fine must be at least €3. The sums of categories are always 1, 10, 20, 50, 200 and 2000 times the amount of the first category. In addition to the fine, the convict also has to pay an administration fee of €9. The amounts are established by the government, via a royal order.\n\nWhen the judge convicts an individual to a fine, the judge must also set a term of substitute imprisonment. This substitute imprisonment will be executed in the case that the fine remains unpaid. The judge may count one day imprisonment for every unpaid €25, however normally judges reckon one day for every €50 which stays unpaid. Though, the substitute imprisonment must be at least one day (even though the fine was €3) and cannot exceed one year (even though the fine was €100.000).\n\nOnce a person is irrevocable convicted to a fine, it's up to the public prosecutor to collect the fine. To do so, the cjib \"(centraal justiteel incassobureau (English: central judicial collection agency))\" is established.\n\nFirst, the CJIB will send the convict the fine. If the convict pays the fine the case is closed (by paying, the convict loses the right to go into appeal as well), if he doesn't, the case will be continued. The CJIB will then send the convict a reminder, though this reminder will contain an increment of €15. If this doesn't lead to the payment of the fine, the CJIB will send another reminder, now with a raise of 20%, however, the raise must be at least €30. When the fine continues to be unpaid, the CJIB will instruct a bailiff to collect the fine nonetheless. This bailiff may, for example, seize the convict's income and sell his possessions. If these measures do not result in the full collection of the fine, the bailiff will return the case to the prosecutor. The prosecutor will order the police to arrest the convict, in order to execute the earlier written substitute imprisonment. The length of the imprisonment will be percentage-wise reduced if the convict has paid a sum, but not the entire amount of the fine. After the substitute imprisonment the convict will be a free man again. He also won't have to pay the fine anymore and the case will be closed.\n\nBefore 1 September 1990, all traffic violations were punished via the criminal law. The suspects were first offered a sort of plea bargain. This mostly contains a fine. If the suspect didn't pay the fine of this plea bargain, the public prosecutor had to open a criminal case, otherwise he wasn't authorized to collect the fine through force. The case had to be withdrawn when the capacity of the courts or the prosecutor's office didn't allow the start of a criminal case for a traffic violation. This was the case very often. This situation led to a negative spiral, because traffic offenders hoped and expected their case to be withdrawn, and didn't pay the plea bargain fine. This led to a growing pressure on the capacity of the courts, which causes more sepots (decisions not to prosecute). This encouraged more offenders not to pay, etc.\n\nIn order to stop this spiral, the secretary general of the justice department (at that time), Dr. Albert Mulder, designed a new system of law enforcement. Under this new system, the government acquired the right of summary foreclosure. The summary foreclosure means that the CJIB can execute the fine directly, unless the fined subject goes to appeal.\n\nThe system regarding frequently committed traffic violations is regulated by Administrative Enforcement of traffic Rules Act \"(Dutch: Wet administratiefrechtelijke handhaving verkeersvoorschriften (WAHV))\". According to the WAHV the maximum sum of the administrative fine is the same as the maximum amount of the first category (Art. 2 section 3 WvSr Criminal Code). The exact fine per violation is determined by an annex of the WAHV. In addition to the fine, the fined subject will also have to pay €9 administration costs as well. The amount of the administration costs will also be determined by the minister.\n\nOnce a subject has been fined by an officer or photographed by a speed camera, he will receive a decision within four months. This decision will contain a short description of the violation, the place and time the violation was committed and sum of the fine.\nThe subject will have two choices now. He can pay the fine or he can go into appeal. In contrast to the court imposed fine, when the subject has paid the fine, he will keep the right to go into appeal. The subject can go into appeal within six weeks. In the first instance, the subject appeals to the public prosecutor. The prosecutor shall withdraw the fine completely when he thinks the appellant has right. He will lower the sum of the fine if he thinks that the suspect is partially right. If the prosecutor thinks that the suspect isn't right, he will uphold the fine. As long as the prosecutor has not made a decision on the appeal, the suspect does not have to pay the fine yet.\n\nOnce the prosecutor has made a decision, the suspect will again have two choices. He can pay or he goes into appeal at the sub-district judge of his arrondissement (or the arrondissement of the place where the disputed violation was committed). But now, the suspect has to pay the fine as a surety. If the suspect doesn't pay the surety, the judge will declare him inadmissible (thus the fine will be upheld). The judge will have the same choices as the prosecutor. He can withdraw the fine, lower the fine, or uphold the fine.\n\nIf the (remaining) fine is higher than €70 and the suspect or/nor the prosecutor doesn't agree with the sub-district judge's verdict, the suspect or the prosecutor can go into appeal for the last time. He does that at the court of appeal of Arnhem-Leeuwarden in Leeuwarden. This appeal will be in writing, unless the appellant, per se, wants to do it orally. If the fine is lower than €70, or the appellant's appeal is rejected in Leeuwarden, there will be no legal remedies anymore and the case will be closed. The appellant's surety will be transformed to a fine.\n\n"}

It derives back to \"occido\", a Latin term meaning \"to fell or to kill.\" Other examples include homicide, genocide, infanticide, matricide, and regicide.\n\nIn the U.S., most crimes of violence are covered by state law, not federal law. Thirty-eight (38) states currently recognize the \"unborn child\" (the term usually used) or fetus as a homicide victim, and twenty-three (23) of those states apply this principle throughout the period of pre-natal development. These laws do not apply to legally induced abortions. Federal and state courts have consistently held that these laws do not contradict the U.S. Supreme Court's rulings on abortion.\n\nIn 2004, Congress enacted, and President Bush signed, the Unborn Victims of Violence Act, which recognizes the \"child in utero\" as a legal victim if he or she is injured or killed during the commission of any of the 68 existing \"federal\" crimes of violence. These crimes include some acts that are federal crimes no matter where they occur (e.g., certain acts of terrorism), crimes in federal jurisdictions, crimes within the military system, crimes involving certain federal officials, and other special cases. The law defines \"child in utero\" as \"a member of the species \"Homo sapiens\", at any stage of development, who is carried in the womb.\"\n\nOf the 38 states that recognize fetal homicide, approximately two-thirds apply the principle throughout the period of pre-natal development, while one-third establish protection at some later stage, which varies from state to state. For example, California treats the killing of a fetus as homicide, but does not treat the killing of an embryo (prior to approximately eight weeks) as homicide, by construction of the California Supreme Court. Some other states do not consider the killing of a fetus to be homicide until the fetus has reached quickening or viability.\n\nUnlawful abortion may be considered \"foeticide\".\n\nFetal homicide laws, as well as ordinary murder statutes, are increasingly used to prosecute pregnant women accused of intentionally or recklessly causing miscarriages or stillbirths. According to the organization National Advocates for Pregnant Women, South Carolina, one of the first states to pass a foeticide law, has charged only one man who assaulted a pregnant woman under this law, while approximately 300 women have been arrested. Widely publicized cases include that of Rennie Gibbs, Bei Bei Shuai, and Purvi Patel.\n\nGibbs was charged with murder in Mississippi in 2006 for having a stillborn daughter while addicted to cocaine. Gibbs is the first woman in Mississippi to be charged with murder relating to the loss of her unborn baby. The judge in that case ruled that the charges be dismissed. In 2011 Shuai was charged by Indiana authorities with murder and foeticide after her suicide attempt resulted in the death of the child she was pregnant with. Shuai's case was the first in the history of Indiana in which a woman was prosecuted for murder for a suicide attempt while pregnant. In 2013 Shuai pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge of criminal recklessness and was released, having been sentenced to time served. In 2015 Purvi Patel became the first woman in the United States to be charged, convicted, and sentenced on a foeticide charge. However, her conviction was later overturned, and she was resentenced to time served for a lesser charge.\n\nIn English law, \"child destruction\" is the crime of killing a fetus \"capable of being born alive\", before it has \"a separate existence\". The Crimes Act 1958 defined \"capable of being born alive\" as 28 weeks' gestation, later reduced to 24 weeks. The 1990 Amendment to the Abortion Act 1967 means a medical practitioner cannot be guilty of the crime.\n\nThe charge of child destruction is rare. A woman who had an unsafe abortion while 7½ months pregnant was given a suspended sentence of 12 months in 2007; the Crown Prosecution Service was unaware of any similar conviction.\n\nIn medical use, the word \"foeticide\" is used simply to mean causing the death of the fetus, usually prior to some form of abortion. The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists recommends foeticide be performed \"before medical abortion after 21 weeks and 6 days of gestation to ensure that there is no risk of a live birth\". In abortions after 20 weeks, an injection of digoxin or potassium chloride into the fetal heart to stop the fetal heart can be used to achieve foeticide. In the United States, the Supreme Court has ruled that a legal ban on intact dilation and extraction procedures does not apply if foeticide is completed before surgery starts.\n\nInjecting potassium chloride into the heart of a fetus causes immediate asystole, but depending on the method used, digoxin may fail to induce fetal demise in some cases (up to 5% if injected into the fetus and up to a third if injected into the amniotic sac) even though it is the preferred drug in many clinics. Digoxin is preferred because it is technically difficult to inject KCl into the heart or umbilical cord.\n\nThe most common method of selective reduction—a procedure to reduce the number of fetuses in a multifetus pregnancy—is foeticide via a chemical injection into the selected fetus or fetuses. The reduction procedure is usually performed during the first trimester of pregnancy. It often follows detection of a congenital defect in the selected fetus or fetuses, but can also reduce the risks of carrying more than three fetuses to term.\n\n"}

He was killed in the 1902 Fermin rebellion when he refused to surrender his ship to the German warship . A naval base in Port-au-Prince is named after him. In 1943, he was honored with a postage stamp.\n\nKillick was an \"Anglo-Haitian mulatto.\" His father was of either Scottish or Irish descent.\n\nHaiti in Killick's time was a poor country, and its navy was ill-equipped, with many of its officers serving under contract from other nations. At any given time, the number of ships in the Navy ranged between two and four. An observer in 1899 described obsolete, possibly un-seaworthy ships badly in need of paint being cannibalized for parts. Sailors in the navy often had to go without pay, and often had little, poor quality food. Moreover, the political situation in Haiti was not stable, with President Florvil Hyppolite facing revolts and rebellions, and the scorn of the international community.\n\nAs the Admiral of this poorly equipped, underfunded force a significant amount of Killick's resources went to trying to acquire more ships. In January 1894 an American yacht called the \"Natalie\" sailed out of Savannah, went missing and was presumed lost. There were rumors that the \"Natalie\" was carrying arms and ammunition to be used in a plot to overthrow Hyppolite, but her captain denied that there were any weapons on board, and claimed the trip was just a pleasure cruise. The \"Natalie\" was spotted near Long Cay, Bahamas in February. A short time later two Haitian vessels, the \"Defence\" and the \"Dessalines\", with Killick on board, showed up near the \"Natalie\". The \"Defence\" was carrying $25,000 in American gold to purchase the \"Natalie\", and the \"Dessalines\" was carrying $60,000 in gold coin for the purchase of the \"Natalie\". Killick and the \"Natalie\"'s captain negotiated a purchase of the \"Natalie\" for £5,208 6\"s\" 8\"d\", roughly $25,000. The \"Natalie\" was retrofitted in Savannah and added to the Haitian Navy.\n\nIn 1896 Haiti was able to add a brand new ship to its fleet, the \"Crête-à-Pierrot\". The \"Crête-à-Pierrot\" was commissioned to be the flagship of the navy. It was built in England and armed in France. It had 11 guns, could steam 15 knots, and displaced 940 tonnes of water. In 1899 the captain commented about how often the Admiral came aboard.\n\nIn July 1898, Admiral Killick caused some anxiety in the international community when he went missing for nineteen days.\n\nIn May 1902, Haitian President Tirésias Simon Sam resigned in embarrassment over Haiti's inability to assert itself in the international community after the Emil Lüders incident. The 1889 constitution provided for the National Assembly to name a president, but there was an uprising demanding direct elections. A provisional government was created to oversee the election of deputies who, together with the National Assembly would appoint the president. Anténor Firmin soon emerged as a popular favorite, but he was opposed by the military and the provisional government, which both supported Pierre Nord Alexis. By June 1902 a civil war had broken out between the supporters of Firmin and the supporters of Alexis.\n\nAdmiral Killick declared his support for Firmin very early on, and his support meant that although Alexis had the support of the military, Firmin had the support of the navy, and full control of the coast. As of 15 May, Killick had not only declared for Firmin, but taken the flagship of the Haitian Navy, the \"Crête-à-Pierrot\", to Cap-Haïtien to pick up Firminist troops and transport them to Port-au-Prince. Meanwhile, the rest of the Haitian Navy, comprising a single ship, the \"Toussaint Louverture\", was in Gonaïves, where Firmin had many supporters.\n\nFirmin campaigned to be elected deputy of both his hometown Cap-Haïtien, and Gonaïves. He was elected deputy for Gonaïves, but on June 28 fighting broke out in Cap-Haïtien between his supporters and troops controlled by Alexis, who had been sent there to supervise the elections. After the fighting broke out Firmin embarked on the \"Crête-à-Pierrot\" and sailed to Gonaïves. There he continued to protest against the way the elections were being conducted.\n\nKillick, meanwhile, proceeded to bombard Cap-Haïtien with both ships. When he left Cap-Haïtien he accidentally ran the \"Toussaint Louverture\" aground on a reef, but through the rest of the summer Killick and the \"Crête-à-Pierrot\" transported soldiers for the Firminist cause, attacked coastal towns, and isolated and slowly demobilized Alexis' forces. Meanwhile, Jean Jumeau marched on Port-au-Prince by land.\n\nDue to his role in the conflict between Firmin and Alexis, Killick was decommissioned by July 12.\n\nAlthough the disrupted, disputed elections were still on-going in July, by July 26, Firmin had been declared president by inhabitants of Artibonite and several other regions of Haiti, Jumeau's land forces were reported to be within one day's march of Port-au-Prince, and the \"Crête-à-Pierrot\" was in the harbor at Port-au-Prince.\n\nEventually, Killick attempted to establish a blockade of the harbor at Cap-Haïtien.\nOn September 2, 1902, Killick and his crew seized a German ammunition ship, the \"Markomannia\" en route to Cape Haitian to provide ammunition to Alexis' forces. Alexis asked Germany for help subduing a pirate ship. In response, Germany sent the gunboat to find and capture the \"Crête-à-Pierrot\".\n\nOn September 6, the \"Crête-à-Pierrot\" was in port at Gonaïves, with Killick and most of the crew on shore leave when the \"Panther\" appeared. Killick rushed on-board and ordered his crew to abandon ship. When all but four crew members had evacuated the ship Killick, inspired by the tale of Captain LaPorte, wrapped himself in a Haitian flag, fired the aft magazine, and blew up the ship, along with the arms that were supplied by German merchants, rather than let the Germans take her. Killick and the remaining four crew members went down with the ship.\n\nAn hour later, the \"Panther\" fired thirty shots at the \"Crête-à-Pierrot\" to finish it off, then sailed away. The ship's rifles and machine guns were salvaged. Killick's body was recovered and buried that same day.\n\nKillick's sacrifice was seen as the ultimate act of patriotism, yet Firmin's struggling revolution was doomed to failure by the loss of the \"Crête-à-Pierrot\" and the support of Haiti's navy. Within a month Firmin went into exile in Saint Thomas, Barbados, where he died in 1911.\n"}
{"id": "359549", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=359549", "title": "Harry Pollitt", "text": "Harry Pollitt\n\nHarry Pollitt (22 November 1890 – 27 June 1960) was a British politician who served as the head of the trade union department of the Communist Party of Great Britain and the General Secretary of the party. \n\nPollitt was born 22 November 1890 in Droylsden, Lancashire. He was the second of six children of Samuel Pollitt (1863–1933), a blacksmith's striker, and his wife, Mary Louisa (1868–1939), a cotton spinner, daughter of William Charlesworth, a joiner. Pollitt's parents were socialists and freethinkers and it was his mother, a member of the Independent Labour Party, who provided the youngster with his first induction into the principles and local networks of socialism. Theirs was an especially close relationship and Pollitt found in his mother both a confidante and a model of working-class dignity in the face of affliction.\n\nHis own sense of injustice at family poverty, as three of his siblings died in infancy, was likewise fundamental to the strong identification with the working class that lay at the root of his political outlook. His formal education, at the local school, ended when he was thirteen. Pollitt was a boilermaker by trade and he frequently travelled around the country in this connection.\n\nIn 1915, whilst living in Southampton, he led a strike of boilermakers.\n\nOn 10 October 1925, Pollitt married Marjorie Brewer in Caxton Hall, Westminster. His best man and witness was fellow-CPGB activist and organiser Percy Glading, who would later be convicted of spying for the Soviet Union and imprisoned.\n\nIn 1919 Pollitt was involved in the \"Hands off Russia\" campaign to protest against Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War. At the end of the war he joined Sylvia Pankhurst's Workers' Socialist Federation, which became the Communist Party (British Section of the Third International). As a member of this group he joined the Communist Party of Great Britain when it was formed in mid-1920. Pankhurst soon left the party, but Pollitt remained. He was heavily influenced by the Communist intellectual Rajani Palme Dutt and the two remained close allies for many years. From 1924 to 1929 Pollitt was General Secretary of the National Minority Movement, a Communist-led united front within the trade unions.\n\nIn 1925, he married Marjory Edna Brewer (b. 1902), a communist schoolteacher, and they had a son and a daughter. That year Pollitt was one of 12 members of the Communist Party convicted at the Old Bailey under the Incitement to Mutiny Act 1797 and one of the five defendants sentenced to 12 months imprisonment.\n\nIn 1929 the CPGB elected him General Secretary, a position he held, with a brief interruption during World War II, until 1956. He was then made Chairman of the Party, a position he held until his death four years later aboard an ocean liner carrying him home from a visit to Australia and New Zealand.\n\nIn his public statements, Pollitt was loyal to the Soviet Union and to CPSU General Secretary Joseph Stalin. He was a defender of the Moscow Trials in which Stalin murdered or otherwise disposed of his political and military opponents. In the \"Daily Worker\" of 12 March 1936 Pollitt told the world that \"the trials in Moscow represent a new triumph in the history of progress\". The article was illustrated by a photograph of Stalin with Nikolai Yezhov, himself shortly to vanish and his photographs airbrushed from history by NKVD archivists.\n\nPollitt also organised a protest against Oswald Mosley's British Union of Fascists in 1934.\n\nThe Labour History Archive and Study Centre at the People's History Museum in Manchester holds the collection of the Communist Party of Great Britain. This collection includes the papers of Harry Pollitt, which covers the years 1920 to 1960.\n\nIn September 1939, despite the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact, he welcomed the British declaration of war on Nazi Germany. When this turned out to be contrary to the Comintern line (as Rajani Palme Dutt, who succeeded him as General Secretary, had warned him it would be), he was forced to resign. He was reinstated after Germany invaded the Soviet Union in 1941.\n\nPollitt contested many parliamentary elections. He fought Rhondda East several times; in 1945 he was within a thousand votes of winning the seat from the Labour candidate.\n\nPollitt faced another crisis when Nikita Khrushchev, in his 1956 Secret Speech, attacked the legacy of Stalin. The Soviet repression of the Hungarian Revolution of 1956 made the crisis in the party worse, and most of its intellectual figures (including Doris Lessing and E. P. Thompson) and many ordinary members resigned. Others, for example Eric Hobsbawm, chose to stay in the Party to try to reform it. Pollitt, depressed both by physical illness (including temporary blindness) and his increasing political isolation, resigned as General Secretary and was appointed CP Chairman.\n\nIn this position, Pollitt, like many other communists around the world, became disillusioned with Khrushchev's revisionism and attacks on Stalin. \"He's staying there as long as I'm alive\", he said of the portrait of Stalin that hung in his living room.\n\nHarry Pollitt died, aged 69, of a cerebral haemorrhage, after years of worsening health, while returning on the SS \"Orion\" from a speaking tour of Australia on 27 June 1960. He was cremated at Golders Green on 9 July, and was survived by his wife and two children, Brian and Jean.\n\nIn 1971, Pollitt's devotion to the Soviet cause and to international communism was acknowledged by Moscow when the Soviet navy named a ship after him. A plaque dedicated to the memory of Pollitt was unveiled by the Mayor of Tameside on 22 March 1995 outside Droylsden Library. He is also ironically commemorated in the humorous song \"The Ballad of Harry Pollitt\", which actually circulated most popularly in his lifetime. Part of the lyrics dealt with his death: \n<poem>\nHarry Pollitt was a worker, one of Lenin's lads\nHe was foully murdered by those counter revolutionary cads\nCounter revolutionary cads, counter revolutionary cads\nHe was foully murdered by those counter revolutionary cads!\n\nOld Harry went to heaven, feeling weak about the knees,\nSaid, \"May I speak with Comrade God; I am Harry Pollitt please\nI'm Harry Pollitt please, I'm Harry Pollitt please,\nMay I speak with Comrade God, I am Harry Pollitt please... \n\nThey dressed him in a nightie, put a harp into his hand,\nAnd he played the Internationale in the Hallelujah band,\nIn the Hallelujah band, in the Hallelujah band,\nHe played the Internationale in the Hallelujah band.\n</poem>\n\nIn operation MASK (1934–1937), an MI5 counterspy infiltrated the party, and was for a time Pollitt's assistant and a clandestine radio operator. This allowed John Tiltman and his colleagues to crack the code and decrypt, for a few years, messages between Moscow and some of its foreign parties, such as the CPGB. They revealed the Comintern's close supervision of the Communist Party and Pollitt. Among other things, Pollitt was instructed to refute news leaks about a Stalinist purge. Some messages were addressed to code names, while others were signed by Pollitt himself. In his transmissions to Moscow, Pollitt regularly pleaded for more funding from the Soviet Union. One 1936 coded instruction advised Pollitt to publicise the plight of Ernst Thälmann, a German communist leader who had been arrested by the Nazis and who later died at Sachsenhausen concentration camp. Pollitt replied that he was 'having difficulties' getting English statesmen to make public declarations supporting Thälmann but that they promised they would speak privately with German officials in London. In one of the more amusing dispatches, Pollitt (1936) informed his Soviet contact about a recent visit to France to make campaign appearances for candidates from the French Communist Party. \"At great inconvenience went to Paris to speak in the election campaign\". Pollitt went on to complain that he was \"kept sitting two days and comrades refused to allow me to speak. Such treatment as I received in Paris is a scandal\".\n\n\n\n"}

A database system was not expected to merge numeric data with text, images, or multimedia information, nor was it expected to automatically notice patterns in the data it stored. In the late 1980s the concept of an intelligent database was put forward as a system that manages information (rather than data) in a way that appears natural to users and which goes beyond simple record keeping.\n\nThe term was introduced in 1989 by the book \"Intelligent Databases\" by Kamran Parsaye, Mark Chignell, Setrag Khoshafian and Harry Wong. The concept postulated three levels of intelligence for such systems: high level tools, the user interface and the database engine. The high level tools manage data quality and automatically discover relevant patterns in the data with a process called data mining. This layer often relies on the use of artificial intelligence techniques. The user interface uses hypermedia in a form that uniformly manages text, images and numeric data. The intelligent database engine supports the other two layers, often merging relational database techniques with object orientation.\n\nIn the twenty-first century, intelligent databases have now become widespread, e.g. hospital databases can now call up patient histories consisting of charts, text and x-ray images just with a few mouse clicks, and many corporate databases include decision support tools based on sales pattern analysis.\n\n"}
{"id": "23469564", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23469564", "title": "Introspection illusion", "text": "Introspection illusion\n\nThe introspection illusion is a cognitive bias in which people wrongly think they have direct insight into the origins of their mental states, while treating others' introspections as unreliable. In certain situations, this illusion leads people to make confident but false explanations of their own behaviour (called \"causal theories\") or inaccurate predictions of their future mental states.\n\nThe illusion has been examined in psychological experiments, and suggested as a basis for biases in how people compare themselves to others. These experiments have been interpreted as suggesting that, rather than offering direct access to the processes underlying mental states, introspection is a process of construction and inference, much as people indirectly infer others' mental states from their behaviour.\n\nWhen people mistake unreliable introspection for genuine self-knowledge, the result can be an illusion of superiority over other people, for example when each person thinks they are less biased and less conformist than the rest of the group. Even when experimental subjects are provided with reports of other subjects' introspections, in as detailed a form as possible, they still rate those other introspections as unreliable while treating their own as reliable. Although the hypothesis of an introspection illusion informs some psychological research, the existing evidence is arguably inadequate to decide how reliable introspection is in normal circumstances. Correction for the bias may be possible through education about the bias and its unconscious nature.\n\nThe phrase \"introspection illusion\" was coined by Emily Pronin. Pronin describes the illusion as having four components:\n\nA 1977 paper by psychologists Richard Nisbett and Timothy D. Wilson challenged the directness and reliability of introspection, thereby becoming one of the most cited papers in the science of consciousness. Nisbett and Wilson reported on experiments in which subjects verbally explained why they had a particular preference, or how they arrived at a particular idea. On the basis of these studies and existing attribution research, they concluded that reports on mental processes are confabulated. They wrote that subjects had, \"little or no introspective access to higher order cognitive processes\". They distinguished between mental \"contents\" (such as feelings) and mental \"processes\", arguing that while introspection gives us access to contents, processes remain hidden.\n\nAlthough some other experimental work followed from the Nisbett and Wilson paper, difficulties with testing the hypothesis of introspective access meant that research on the topic generally stagnated. A ten-year-anniversary review of the paper raised several objections, questioning the idea of \"process\" they had used and arguing that unambiguous tests of introspective access are hard to achieve.\n\nUpdating the theory in 2002, Wilson admitted that the 1977 claims had been too far-reaching. He instead relied on the theory that the \"adaptive unconscious\" does much of the moment-to-moment work of perception and behaviour. When people are asked to report on their mental processes, they cannot access this unconscious activity. However, rather than acknowledge their lack of insight, they confabulate a plausible explanation, and \"seem\" to be \"unaware of their unawareness\".\n\nThe idea that people can be mistaken about their inner functioning is one applied by eliminative materialists. These philosophers suggest that some concepts, including \"belief\" or \"pain\" will turn out to be quite different from what is commonly expected as science advances.\n\nThe faulty guesses that people make to explain their thought processes have been called \"causal theories\". The causal theories provided after an action will often serve only to justify the person's behaviour in order to relieve cognitive dissonance. That is, a person may not have noticed the real reasons for their behaviour, even when trying to provide explanations. The result is an explanation that mostly just makes themselves feel better. An example might be a man who discriminates against homosexuals because he is embarrassed that he himself is attracted to other men. He may not admit this to himself, instead claiming his prejudice is because he believes that homosexuality is unnatural.\n\nA study conducted by philosopher Eric Schwitzgebel and psychologist Russell T. Hurlburt was set up to measure the extent of introspective accuracy by gathering introspective reports from a single individual who was given the pseudonym \"Melanie\". Melanie was given a beeper which sounded at random moments, and when it did she had to note what she was currently feeling and thinking. After analyzing the reports the authors had mixed views about the results, the correct interpretation of Melanie's claims and her introspective accuracy. Even after long discussion the two authors disagreed with each other in the closing remarks, Schwitzgebel being pessimistic and Hurlburt optimistic about the reliability of introspection.\n\nNisbett and Wilson conjectured about several factors that they found to contribute to the accuracy of introspective self-reports on cognition.\n\nSeveral hypotheses to explain people's unawareness of their inaccuracies in introspection were provided by Nisbett and Wilson:\n\nThe claim that confabulation of justifications evolved to relieve cognitive dissonance is criticized by some evolutionary biologists for assuming the evolution of a mechanism for feeling dissonanced by a lack of justification. These evolutionary biologists argue that if causal theories had no higher predictive accuracy than prejudices that would have been in place even without causal theories, there would be no evolutionary selection for experiencing any form of discomfort from lack of causal theories. The claim that studies in the United States that appear to show a link between homophobia and homosexuality can be explained by an actual such link is criticized by many scholars. Since much homophobia in the United States is due to religious indoctrination and therefore unrelated to personal sexual preferences, they argue that the appearance of a link is due to volunteer-biased erotica research in which religious homophobes fear God's judgment but not being recorded as \"homosexual\" by Earthly psychologists while most non-homophobes are misled by false dichotomies to assume that the notion that men can be sexually fluid is somehow \"homophobic\" and \"unethical\".\n\nInspired by the Nisbett and Wilson paper, Petter Johansson and colleagues investigated subjects' insight into their own preferences using a new technique. Subjects saw two photographs of people and were asked which they found more attractive. They were given a closer look at their \"chosen\" photograph and asked to verbally explain their choice. However, in some trials, the experimenter had slipped them the other photograph rather than the one they had chosen, using sleight of hand. A majority of subjects failed to notice that the picture they were looking at did not match the one they had chosen just seconds before. Many subjects confabulated explanations of their preference. For example, a man might say \"I preferred this one because I prefer blondes\" when he had in fact pointed to the dark-haired woman, but had been handed a blonde. These must have been confabulated because they explain a choice that was never made. The large proportion of subjects who were taken in by the deception contrasts with the 84% who, in post-test interviews, said that hypothetically they would have detected a switch if it had been made in front of them. The researchers coined the phrase \"choice blindness\" for this failure to detect a mismatch.\n\nA follow-up experiment involved shoppers in a supermarket tasting two different kinds of jam, then verbally explaining their preferred choice while taking further spoonfuls from the \"chosen\" pot. However, the pots were rigged so that, when explaining their choice, the subjects were tasting the jam they had actually rejected. A similar experiment was conducted with tea. Another variation involved subjects choosing between two objects displayed on PowerPoint slides, then explaining their choice when the description of what they chose had been altered.\n\nResearch by Paul Eastwick and Eli Finkel (described as \"one of the leading lights in the realm of relationship psychology\") at Northwestern University also undermined the idea that subjects have direct introspective awareness of what attracts them to other people. These researchers examined male and female subjects' reports of what they found attractive. Men typically reported that physical attractiveness was crucial while women identified earning potential as most important. These subjective reports did not predict their actual choices in a speed dating context, or their dating behaviour in a one-month follow-up.\n\nConsistent with choice blindness, Henkel and Mather found that people are easily convinced by false reminders that they chose different options than they actually chose and that they show greater choice-supportive bias in memory for whichever option they believe they chose.\n\nIt is not clear, however, the extent to which these findings apply to real-life experience when we have more time to reflect or use actual faces (as opposed to gray-scale photos). As Prof. Kaszniak points out: \"although \"a priori\" theories are an important component of people's causal explanations, they are not the sole influence, as originally hypothesized by Nisbett & Wilson. Actors also have privileged information access that includes some degree of introspective access to pertinent causal stimuli and thought processes, as well as better access (than observers) to stimulus-response covariation data about their own behaviour\". Other criticisms point out that people who volunteer to psychology lab studies are not representative of the general population and also are behaving in ways that do not reflect how they would behave in real life. Examples include people of many different non-open political ideologies, despite their enmity to each other, having a shared belief that it is \"ethical\" to give an appearance of humans justifying beliefs and \"unethical\" to admit that humans are open-minded in the absence of threats that inhibit critical thinking, making them fake justifications.\n\nStudies that ask participants to introspect upon their reasoning (for liking, choosing, or believing something, etc.) tend to see a subsequent decrease in correspondence between attitude and behaviour in the participants. For example, in a study by Wilson \"et al.\", participants rated their interest in puzzles that they had been given. Prior to rating, one group had been instructed to contemplate and write down their reasons for liking or disliking the puzzles, while the control group was given no such task. The amount of time participants spent playing with each puzzle was then recorded. The correlation between ratings of and time spent playing each puzzle was much smaller for the introspection group than the control group.\n\nA subsequent study was performed to show the generalizability of these results to more \"realistic\" circumstances. In this study, participants were all involved in a steady romantic relationship. All were asked to rate how well-adjusted their relationship was. One group was asked to list all of the reasons behind their feelings for their partner, while the control group did not do so. Six months later, the experimenters followed up with participants to check if they were still in the same relationship. Those who had been asked to introspect showed much less attitude-behaviour consistency based upon correlations between earlier relationship ratings and whether they were still dating their partners. This shows that introspection was not predictive, but this also probably means that the introspection has changed the evolution of the relationship.\n\nThe authors theorize that these effects are due to participants changing their attitudes, when confronted with a need for justification, without changing their corresponding behaviours. The authors hypothesize that this attitude shift is the result of a combination of things: a desire to avoid feeling foolish for simply not knowing why one feels a certain way; a tendency to make justifications based upon cognitive reasons, despite the large influence of emotion; ignorance of mental biases (e.g., halo effects); and self-persuasion that the reasons one has come up with must be representative with their attitude. In effect, people attempt to supply a \"good story\" to explain their reasoning, which often leads to convincing themselves that they actually hold a different belief. In studies wherein participants chose an item to keep, their subsequent reports of satisfaction with the item decreased, suggesting that their attitude changes were temporary, returning to the original attitude over time.\n\nIn contrast with introspection by focusing on reasoning, that which instructs one to focus on their feelings has actually been shown to increase attitude-behaviour correlations. This finding suggests that introspecting on one's feelings is not a maladaptive process.\n\nThe theory that there are mental processes that act as justifications do not make behaviour more adaptive is criticized by some biologists who argue that the cost in nutrients for brain function selects against any brain mechanism that does not make behaviour more adapted to the environment. They argue that the cost in essential nutrients causes even more difficulty than the cost in calories, especially in social groups of many individuals needing the same scarce nutrients, which imposes substantial difficulty on feeding the group and lowers their potential size. These biologists argue that the evolution of argumentation was driven by the effectiveness of arguments on changing risk perception attitudes and life and death decisions to a more adaptive state, as \"luxury functions\" that did not enhance life and death survival would lose the evolutionary \"tug of war\" against the selection for nutritional thrift. While there have been claims of non-adaptive brain functions being selected by sexual selection, these biologists criticize any applicability to introspection illusion's causal theories because sexually selected traits are most disabling as a fitness signal during or after puberty but human brains require the highest amount of nutrients before puberty (enhancing the nerve connections in ways that make adult brains capable of faster and more nutrient-efficient firing).\n\nIn their classic paper, Nisbett and Wilson proposed that introspective confabulations result from \"a priori\" theories, of which they put forth four possible origins:\n\nThe authors note that the use of these theories does not necessarily lead to inaccurate assumptions, but that this frequently occurs because the theories are improperly applied.\n\nPronin argues that over-reliance on intentions is a factor in a number of different biases. For example, by focusing on their current good intentions, people can overestimate their likelihood of behaving virtuously.\n\nThe bias blind spot is an established phenomenon that people rate themselves as less susceptible to bias than their peer group. Emily Pronin and Matthew Kugler argue that this phenomenon is due to the introspection illusion. In their experiments, subjects had to make judgments about themselves and about other subjects. They displayed standard biases, for example rating themselves above the others on desirable qualities (demonstrating illusory superiority). The experimenters explained cognitive bias, and asked the subjects how it might have affected their judgment. The subjects rated themselves as less susceptible to bias than others in the experiment (confirming the bias blind spot). When they had to explain their judgments, they used different strategies for assessing their own and others' bias.\n\nPronin and Kugler's interpretation is that when people decide whether someone else is biased, they use overt behaviour. On the other hand, when assessing whether or not they themselves are biased, people look inward, searching their own thoughts and feelings for biased motives. Since biases operate unconsciously, these introspections are not informative, but people wrongly treat them as reliable indication that they themselves, unlike other people, are immune to bias.\n\nPronin and Kugler tried to give their subjects access to others' introspections. To do this, they made audio recordings of subjects who had been told to say whatever came into their heads as they decided whether their answer to a previous question might have been affected by bias. Although subjects persuaded themselves they were unlikely to be biased, their introspective reports did not sway the assessments of observers.\n\nWhen asked what it would mean to be biased, subjects were more likely to define bias in terms of introspected thoughts and motives when it applied to themselves, but in terms of overt behaviour when it applied to other people. When subjects were explicitly told to avoid relying on introspection, their assessments of their own bias became more realistic.\n\nAdditionally, Nisbett and Wilson found that asking participants whether biases (such as the position effect in the stocking study) had an effect on their decisions resulted in a negative response, in contradiction with the data.\n\nAnother series of studies by Pronin and colleagues examined perceptions of conformity. Subjects reported being more immune to social conformity than their peers. In effect, they saw themselves as being \"alone in a crowd of sheep\". The introspection illusion appeared to contribute to this effect. When deciding whether others respond to social influence, subjects mainly looked at their behaviour, for example explaining other student's political opinions in terms of following the group. When assessing their own conformity, subjects treat their own introspections as reliable. In their own minds, they found no motive to conform, and so decided that they had not been influenced.\n\nPsychologist Daniel Wegner has argued that an introspection illusion contributes to belief in paranormal phenomena such as psychokinesis. He observes that in everyday experience, intention (such as wanting to turn on a light) is followed by action (such as flicking a light switch) in a reliable way, but the processes connecting the two are not consciously accessible. Hence though subjects may feel that they directly introspect their own free will, the experience of control is actually inferred from relations between the thought and the action. This theory, called \"apparent mental causation\", acknowledges the influence of David Hume's view of the mind. This process for detecting when one is responsible for an action is not totally reliable, and when it goes wrong there can be an illusion of control. This could happen when an external event follows, and is congruent with, a thought in someone's mind, without an actual causal link.\n\nAs evidence, Wegner cites a series of experiments on magical thinking in which subjects were induced to think they had influenced external events. In one experiment, subjects watched a basketball player taking a series of free throws. When they were instructed to visualise him making his shots, they felt that they had contributed to his success.\n\nIf the introspection illusion contributes to the subjective feeling of free will, then it follows that people will more readily attribute free will to themselves rather than others. This prediction has been confirmed by three of Pronin and Kugler's experiments. When college students were asked about personal decisions in their own and their roommate's lives, they regarded their own choices as less predictable. Staff at a restaurant described their co-workers' lives as more determined (having fewer future possibilities) than their own lives. When weighing up the influence of different factors on behaviour, students gave desires and intentions the strongest weight for their own behaviour, but rated personality traits as most predictive of other people.\nHowever, criticism of Wegner's claims regarding the significance of introspection illusion for the notion of free will has been published.\n\nResearch shows that human volunteers can estimate their response times accurately, in fact knowing their \"mental processes\" well, but only with substantial demands made on their attention and cognitive resources (i.e. they are distracted while estimating). Such estimation is likely more than \"post hoc\" interpretation and may incorporate privileged information. Mindfulness training can also increase introspective accuracy in some instances. Nisbett and Wilson's findings were criticized by psychologists Ericsson and Simon, among others.\n\nA study that investigated the effect of educating people about unconscious biases on their subsequent self-ratings of susceptibility to bias showed that those who were educated did not exhibit the bias blind spot, in contrast with the control group. This finding provides hope that being informed about unconscious biases such as the introspection illusion may help people to avoid making biased judgments, or at least make them aware that they are biased. Findings from other studies on correction of the bias yielded mixed results. In a later review of the introspection illusion, Pronin suggests that the distinction is that studies that merely provide a warning of unconscious biases will not see a correction effect, whereas those that inform about the bias and emphasize its unconscious nature do yield corrections. Thus, knowledge that bias can operate during conscious awareness seems the defining factor in leading people to correct for it.\n\nTimothy Wilson has tried to find a way out from \"introspection illusion\", recounted in his book \"Strangers to Ourselves.\" He suggests that the observation of our own behaviours more than our thoughts can be one of the keys for clearer introspective knowledge.\n\nSome 21st century critical rationalists argue that claims of correcting for introspection illusions or other cognitive biases pose a threat of immunizing themselves to criticism by alleging that criticism of psychological theories that claim cognitive bias are \"justifications\" for cognitive bias, making it non-falsifiable by labelling of critics and also potentially totalitarian. These modern critical rationalists argue that a theory that defending a theory by claiming that it overcomes bias and alleging that critics are biased can defend any pseudoscience from criticism, that the claim that \"criticism of A is a defense of B\" is inherently incapable of being evidence-based and that any actual \"most humans\" bias (if it existed) would be shared by most psychologists and make psychology's claims of biases a way of accusing unbiased criticism of being biased and marketing the biases as overcoming of bias.\n\n\n"}

He was present with Rasputin at the secret ritual in Scotland that brought Hellboy to the world.\n\nKroenen, Haupstein, and Kurtz were frozen inside a secret Nazi base, until they were resuscitated by industrialist Roderick Zinco, acting on Rasputin's orders. Kroenen resumed work on several of his former projects, including making an \"Apocalypse Army\" by combining corpses with robotics. He also convinced Zinco to retrieve the head of his colleague, Herman von Klempt, from South America. Kroenen retained an affection for his colleague, though Rasputin had rejected Klempt as unsuitable for Ragna Rok. When Klempt's head was re-animated, he tried to convince Kroenen to abandon Rasputin's plan to awaken the Ogdru Jahad - and instead to use the Army to retrieve Klempt's work in South America. Overhearing, Kurtz became furious and attacked Klempt's head, screaming, \"Rasputin is master!\" In a panic, Kroenen seized a knife and killed Kurtz. When their plan failed, an enraged Rasputin struck Zinco, who was blinded. Wandering around, Zinco accidentally pressed a self-destruct button in the base, destroying it completely and taking Kroenen with it.\n\n(Kroenen's expanded biography appears as a series of comic panels in the book \"Hellboy: The Art of the Movie\", as well as in the special features of the film's DVD).\n\nKarl Ruprecht Kroenen was born in Munich, Germany in 1897. A musical prodigy with angelic features and blonde hair, young Kroenen toured the capitals of Europe singing opera until his voice deepened with the onset of puberty, thereby ending his career. From a very early age, he demonstrated symptoms of masochism, whipping himself with a fresh branch of oak each day, and finding pleasure in the pain. As a teenager, he loathed his awkwardness and developed an extreme form of body dysmorphic disorder (termed \"surgical addiction\" in the film). In his obsession with physical perfection, he conducted brutal experiments on his own body, including surgically removing his own eyelids, lips, and his toe- and finger nails. He also designed a tight-fitting gas mask to filter out germs, which he wore almost permanently. He also became quite adept with mechanical devices, believing that fusing mechanical constructs with living bodies would help create perfection. One of his early inventions was a clockwork nightingale that sang a Mozart aria perfectly.\n\nIn 1930, he met the resurrected Rasputin for the first time. Obsessed with purity, Kroenen quickly became Rasputin’s most loyal disciple. He subsequently joined the Nazi Party, and rose quickly through the ranks, joining the \"Schutzstaffel\" (SS) in 1933 and achieving the rank of \"Obersturmbannführer\" (lieutenant colonel). He was awarded the Iron Cross for services to the Third Reich, including a tour of duty as commandant of Auschwitz concentration camp, where he served with distinction. Kroenen became head of the Thule Society, a group of German aristocrats obsessed with the occult. He helped them to spearhead Project Ragna Rok, engineering the portal generator that would conjure the Scarlet Beast, Hellboy, in October 1944.\n\nA masterful fencer, he also became renowned for his swordsmanship and created his own signature swords.\n\nWhen Allied Forces stormed the island off the coast of Scotland where Project Ragna Rok took place, Kroenen killed several of the American soldiers attacking the base, but was distracted by a grenade thrown under the portal device by a young Professor Trevor Bruttenholm. Kroenen tried to retrieve the grenade, but his left hand was blown off, and a length of concrete reinforcing rod (or rebar) impaled him through the chest, severing his spine. Shortly thereafter, he disappeared.\n\nAfter his disappearance, in 1956, an unmarked grave in Romania was found. Dental records identified the remains as those of Kroenen.\n\nHowever, Kroenen reappeared in 2004. Thanks to the inexplicable powers of science and black magic, Kroenen \"repaired\" himself with a prosthetic mechanical hand, a steel rod replacing the broken part of his spine and a clockwork heart, operated by a wind-up key implanted in his chest. By cranking the key, he was able to increase his speed and reflexes. After long decades, the blood in his veins dried up completely, leaving only dust, and rendering him virtually invulnerable to gunshot wounds. He could also turn the key to \"switch off\" his body (literally), remaining in a dormant state and appearing dead, until he was reanimated. He used this deceptive technique to infiltrate the BPRD headquarters. After critically wounding BPRD Agent Clay, he faked his own death and lay beside Clay, and they were both taken into the headquarters. Once inside, Kroenen drew Rasputin there, and personally killed the now elderly Professor Bruttenholm, before disappearing with Rasputin.\n\nThe BPRD tracked Rasputin to his own mausoleum beneath Moscow. Hellboy seemingly avenged Bruttenholm's death by throwing Kroenen into an impalement trap — a spiked pit hidden beneath a trapdoor. Skewered on the stakes, Kroenen was crushed when Hellboy dropped a giant cog on top of him. The damage done to him was probably more than Kroenen could survive.\n\nKroenen's smashed gas mask later appeared in a display case at the BPRD in \"\". In the script for that film, an epilogue scene was written to be a lead-in for a third movie, but was cut for budgetary reasons. An animated version of the scene appears on the DVD's special features. Found by Roderick Zinco in the mausoleum ruins, Kroenen's remains are brought to a doctor to be revived with advanced alchemy, before traveling to the Arctic into a long abandoned Nazi weapon storage building to insert the disembodied head of Kroenen into a huge robotic body at which point Kroenen awakes and praises his \"Master\" foreseeing his resurrection as Rasputin appears on screen.\n\nIn the commentary of \"Golden Army\", Guillermo del Toro also stated that, in the planned story for the third film, Kroenen was to have some history with the character of Johann Krauss. This was hinted in the second film when Johann is seen staring in deep thought at Kroenen's mask in the display case during the part when Hellboy is in the ward.\n\nKroenen's comics version is a fairly ordinary scientist, who seems to possess some surgical training.\n\nIn the original script for \"Hellboy\", the young Professor Bruttenholm describes Kroenen as \"one of the Reich's top scientists, and head of the Thule Occult Society.\" In the film release, the line was re-dubbed so that the first phrase was replaced by \"Hitler's top assassin.\"\n\nIn his initial appearance, while wearing an SS uniform, Kroenen wields a Luger P08 pistol against the attacking U.S. soldiers, and then a pair of Katar (कटार)-like daggers that extend from the sleeves of his trench coat.\n\nIn his later appearances, he wields a pair of tonfa-style swords, and also has several other daggers strapped to his suit.\n\nKroenen is also briefly seen in his workshop, which includes a whole array of disturbing gadgets, along with several different versions of his gas mask.\n\nSeveral times in \"Hellboy II\", Kroenen's battered gasmask can be seen in a display case along with a golden mask that resembles the head of Sammael.\n\nCzech actor Ladislav Beran portrayed Kroenen in the film adaptation of \"Hellboy\".\n\nThis portrayal is radically different from the comics. Kroenen, who originally played the part of a meek character, who Del Toro describes as someone who is likely to say \"Aargh! Don't break the machine!\" is here portrayed as a murderous soldier who is inhumanly loyal to Rasputin.\n\nGerman film historian Florian Evers devotes a whole chapter of his book on National Socialism in modern pop culture to the character of Karl Ruprecht Kroenen. He points out the allegoric puzzle segments of Shoah-iconography behind the design of Kroenen, calling him an incarnation of the Holocaust.\n\nThe real Karl Ruprecht was an Austrian Nazi official and folklorist. He was born on June 19, 1910 in Gratkorn. He studied German and English philology and folklore at the University of Graz, then at the University of Vienna, and then from 1934 on at the University of Königsberg. Karl Ruprecht earned his Phd with Prof. Walter Ziesemer and a work on Wilhelm Heinrich Riehl. He then worked at the \"Office for the Improvement of Literature\" (Amt Schrifttumspflege), and at the \"Office for Folklore and Organization of Festivals\" (Amt Volkskunde und Feiergestaltung), both part of the Rosenberg Bureau. Within the Advanced School of the NSDAP, he was a leading member of the \"Reich Institute for German Folklore\". Karl Ruprecht was the leader of the \"Research Post for Peasant Life Structures\" (Forschungsstelle Bäuerliche Lebensformen). He published articles in the National Socialist Monthly and the journal \"Idea and Action\" (Idee und Tat).\n"}

Such systems are usually of two types:\n\nThe system is typically controlled by a combination of automatic rocket failure detection, and a manual backup for the crew commander's use.\n\nA launch escape system has performed its intended function twice successfully. In 1983, the crew of the Soviet Soyuz T-10-1 were carried away from their launch vehicle via their LES two seconds before the launch vehicle exploded due to a pad fire. The crew survived.\n\nIn 2018 the crew of Soyuz MS-10 escaped their launch vehicle after a booster rocket separation failure occurred at an altitude of 50 km during the ascent. The crew were uninjured and landed safely.\n\nThe idea of using a rocket to remove the capsule from a space vehicle was developed by Maxime Faget in 1958. The system, using the tower on the top of the space capsule to house rockets, was first used on a test of the Project Mercury capsule in March 1959.\nHistorically, LESes were used on American Mercury and Apollo spacecraft. Both designs used a solid-fuel rocket motor. The Mercury LES was built by the Grand Central Rocket Company in Redlands, California (which later became the Lockheed Propulsion Company). Apollo used a design that had many similarities to the Mercury system. Launch Escape Systems continue to be used on the Russian Soyuz and Chinese Shenzhou programme spacecraft. The SpaceX-designed Dragon V2 uses a hypergolic liquid-fueled launch abort system integrated to the capsule to minimize spacecraft costs. \n\nThe LES may be used while the launch vehicle is still on the launch pad, or during its ascent.\n\nThe Soviet Vostok and American Gemini spacecraft both made use of ejection seats. The European Space Agency's Hermes and the Soviet \"Buran\"-class spaceplanes would also have made use of them if they had ever flown with crews. As shown by Soyuz T-10a, an LES must be able to carry a crew compartment from the launch pad to a height sufficient for its parachutes to open. Consequently, they must make use of large, powerful (and heavy) solid rockets. The Soyuz launch escape system is called \"CAC\" or \"SAS\", from the Russian/transliterated Russian \"Система Аварийного Спасения\" or \"Sistema Avariynogo Spaseniya\", meaning emergency rescue system.\n\nThe Space Shuttle was fitted with ejection seats for the two pilots in the initial \"shakedown\" flights, but these were removed once the vehicle was deemed operational and carried additional crew members, which could not be provided with escape hatches. Following the Challenger disaster, all surviving orbiters were fitted to allow for crew evacuation through the main ingress/egress hatch, although only when the Shuttle was in a controlled glide, as the crew would have had to reach the exit from their seats and jump out.\nThe Orion Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle being developed to follow the shuttle program will use a Mercury and Apollo-style escape rocket system, while an alternative system, called the Max Launch Abort System (MLAS), has been floated to use existing solid-rocket motors integrated into the bullet-shaped protective launch shroud.\n\nUnder NASA's Commercial Crew Development (CCDev) program Blue Origin has been awarded $3.7 million for development of an innovative 'pusher' LAS.\n\nAlso under NASA's CCDev program, SpaceX was awarded $75 million for the development of their own version of a \"pusher\" LAS. Its Dragon V2 spacecraft will use its SuperDraco engines during a launch abort scenario. Although often referred to as a \"pusher\" arrangement since it lacks a tower, the Dragon V2 LAS removes both the capsule and its trunk together from the launch vehicle. The system is designed to abort with the Super Draco engines at the top of the abort stack as occurs with a more traditional tractor LAS. The concept was first tested in a Pad Abort test conducted at SLC-40, Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, on May 6, 2015. SpaceX will next test the system during ascent of the Falcon 9 rocket in Kennedy Space Center Launch Complex 39 from where it plans to launch crews to the International Space Station.\n\nOrbital Sciences Corporation intends to sell the LAS it was building for the Orion spacecraft to future commercial crew vehicle providers in the wake of cancellation of the Constellation project.\n\nThe first fully operational test flight of an LES was Apollo mission A-004 on January 20, 1966. The mission used a Little Joe II booster, carrying an early version of the Apollo Command/Service Module.\nThe first usage with a manned misison occurred during the attempt to launch Soyuz T-10-1 on September 26, 1983. The rocket caught fire, just before launch, and the LES carried the crew capsule clear, seconds before the rocket exploded. The crew were subjected to an acceleration of 14 to 17 \"g\" (140 to 170 m/s) for five seconds and were badly bruised. Reportedly, the capsule reached an altitude of and landed from the launch pad. The Soyuz LES system also has grid fins mounted on the payload fairing that deploy to stabilize the craft.\n\nAn accidental pad firing of a launch escape system occurred during the attempted launch of the unmanned Soyuz 7K-OK No.1 spacecraft on December 14, 1966. The vehicle's strap-on boosters did not ignite, preventing the rocket from leaving the pad. About 30 minutes later, while the vehicle was being secured, the LES engine fired. Separation charges started a fire in the rocket's third stage, leading to an explosion that killed a pad worker. During the attempted launch, the booster switched from external to internal power as it normally would do, which then activated the abort sensing system. Originally it was thought that the LES firing was triggered by a gantry arm that tilted the rocket past 7 degrees, meeting one of the defined in-flight abort conditions.\n\n\n"}

As a result, it has been used to conduct numerous comparative studies to assess the efficiency, reliability, and controllability of state-of-the-art MOEAs.\n\nThe MOEA Framework is an extensible framework for rapidly designing, developing, executing, and statistically testing multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs).

In addition, it integrates with the JMetal, Platform and Programming Language Independent Interface for Search Algorithms (PISA), and Borg MOEA libraries to provide access to all popular MOEAs. Additionally, using Java's service provider interface (SPI), new MOEAs and problems can be introduced into the framework. This supports the use of the MOEA Framework in scientific studies, allowing new MOEAs to be tested against a suite of state-of-the-art algorithms across a large collection of test problems.\n\nNew problems are defined in the MOEA Framework using one or more decision variables of a varying type. This includes common representations such as binary strings, real-valued numbers, and permutations.

Once the problem is defined, the user can optimize the problem using any of supported MOEAs.\n\nThe MOEA Framework is the only known framework for evolutionary computation that provides support for sensitivity analysis. Sensitivity analysis in this context studies how an MOEA's parameters impact its output (i.e., the quality of the results). Alternatively, sensitivity analysis measures the robustness of an MOEA to changes in its parameters. An MOEA whose behavior is sensitive to its paramterization will not be easily controllable; conversely, an MOEA that is insensitive to its parameters is controllable. By measuring the sensitivities of each MOEA, the MOEA Framework can identify the controlling parameters for each MOEA and provide guidance for fine-tuning the parameters. Additionally, MOEAs that are consistently insensitive to parameter changes across an array of problem domains are regarded highly due to their robust ability to solve optimization problems.\n\n\n"}

She was married to Central Intelligence Agency official Cord Meyer from 1945–1958, and she became involved romantically with President John F. Kennedy after her divorce from Meyer.\n\nMeyer was shot to death on the Chesapeake & Ohio Canal towpath on October 12, 1964, three weeks after the release of the Warren Commission Report, whose conclusions Meyer allegedly challenged. Meyer’s long history of criticism of the CIA, the timing of her killing, the CIA’s wiretapping of her phone, and the effort by CIA counterintelligence chief James Jesus Angleton to retrieve Meyer’s diary immediately after her death prompted investigation of possible CIA involvement in her murder. Additionally, Army personnel records for prosecution witness Lt. William L. Mitchell, released in 2015 and 2016 under the Freedom of Information Act, corroborate his ties to the intelligence community. CIA involvement has also been suggested by the phone call that was placed by top Agency official Wistar Janney to Ben Bradlee, hours before the police had identified Meyer’s body.

Pinchot and her younger sister Antoinette (nicknamed \"Tony\") were raised at the family's Grey Towers home in Milford, Pennsylvania. As a child, Pinchot met such left-wing intellectuals as Mabel Dodge, Louis Brandeis, Robert M. La Follette, Sr., and Harold L. Ickes. She attended Brearley School and Vassar College, where she became interested in Communism. She started dating William Attwood in 1935 and, while with him at a dance held at Choate, first met John F. Kennedy in 1936.\n\nAfter her graduation from Vassar in 1942, Meyer became a journalist, writing for the United Press and \"Mademoiselle\". As a pacifist and member of the American Labor Party, she came under scrutiny by the Federal Bureau of Investigation.\n\nPinchot met Cord Meyer in 1944 when he was a Marine Corps lieutenant who had lost his left eye because of shrapnel injuries received in combat. The two had similar pacifist views and beliefs in world government and married on April 19, 1945. That spring they both attended the UN Conference on International Organization in San Francisco, during which the United Nations was founded, Cord as an aide of Harold Stassen and Pinchot as a reporter for a newspaper syndication service. She later worked for a time as an editor for \"Atlantic Monthly\". Their eldest child Quentin was born in November 1945, followed by Michael in 1947, after which Pinchot became a homemaker, although she attended classes at the Art Students League of New York.\n\nCord Meyer became president of the United World Federalists in May 1947 and its membership doubled. Mary Meyer wrote for the organization's journal. In 1950, their third child, Mark, was born and they moved to Cambridge, Massachusetts. Meanwhile, her husband began to re-evaluate his notions of world government as members of the Communist Party USA infiltrated the international organizations he had founded. It is unknown when he first began secretly working with the Central Intelligence Agency, but in 1951 Allen Dulles approached Cord Meyer; he became an employee of the CIA and was soon a \"principal operative\" of Operation Mockingbird, a covert operation meant to sway American print and broadcast media toward the CIA line.\n\nWith her husband's CIA appointment, they moved to Washington D.C. and became highly visible members of Georgetown society. Their acquaintances included Joseph Alsop, Katharine Graham, Clark Clifford, and \"Washington Post\" reporter James Truitt and his wife, noted artist Anne Truitt. Their social circle also included CIA-affiliated people such as Richard M. Bissell, Jr., high-ranking counter-intelligence official James Angleton, and Mary and Frank Wisner, Meyer's boss at CIA. During her time as a CIA wife, Pinchot Meyer was openly critical of the Agency and its programs, likening CIA Director Allen Dulles to Machiavelli.\n\nIn 1953, Senator Joseph McCarthy publicly accused Cord Meyer of being a Communist and the Federal Bureau of Investigation was reported to have looked into Mary's political past. Allen Dulles and Frank Wisner aggressively defended Meyer and he remained with the CIA. However, by early 1954, Cord Meyer had become unhappy with his CIA career. He used contacts from his covert operations in Operation Mockingbird to approach several New York publishers for a job but was rebuffed.\n\nDuring the summer of 1954, John F. Kennedy and his wife Jackie Kennedy bought the house next door to the Meyers'; Pinchot Meyer and Jackie Kennedy became acquainted and \"they went on walks together.\" By the end of 1954, Cord Meyer was still with the CIA and often in Europe, running Radio Free Europe, Radio Liberty, and managing millions of dollars of U.S. government funds worldwide to support progressive-seeming foundations and organizations opposing the Soviet Union.\n\nOne of Pinchot Meyer's close friends was her Vassar chum, Cicely d'Autremont, who married James Angleton. In 1955, Meyer's sister Antoinette (Tony) married Ben Bradlee, who was then Washington bureau chief of \"Newsweek\". On December 18, 1956, the Meyers' middle son Michael, aged nine, was hit by a car near their house and killed. Although this tragedy briefly brought Mary and Cord Meyer closer for a time, Mary filed for divorce in 1958.\n\nAfter the divorce, Pinchot Meyer and her two surviving sons moved to Georgetown. She began painting again in a converted garage studio at the home of her sister Tony and Tony's husband, Ben Bradlee. She also started a close relationship with abstract-minimalist painter Kenneth Noland and became friendly with Robert Kennedy, who had purchased his brother's house, Hickory Hill, in 1957. Nina Burleigh, in her book \"A Very Private Woman\", writes that after the divorce Meyer became \"a well-bred ingenue out looking for fun and getting in trouble along the way.\"\n\nAngleton told Joan Bross, the wife of John Bross, a high-ranking CIA official, that he had begun tapping Mary Meyer's telephone after she left her husband. Angleton often visited the family home and took her sons on fishing outings. Pinchot Meyer visited John F. Kennedy at the White House in October 1961 and their relationship became intimate. Pinchot Meyer told Anne and James Truitt she was keeping a diary.\n\nRumors and tabloid press reports of her affair with Kennedy were confirmed by her brother-in-law, \"Washington Post\" editor Ben Bradlee, in his 1995 autobiography \"A Good Life\". \n\nTimothy Leary later claimed Pinchot Meyer influenced Kennedy's \"views on nuclear disarmament and rapprochement with Cuba.\" In an interview with Nina Burleigh, Kennedy aide Myer Feldman said, \"I think he might have thought more of her than some of the other women and discussed things that were on his mind, not just social gossip.\" Burleigh wrote, \"Mary might actually have been a force for peace during some of the most frightening years of the cold war...\"\n\nIn a 2008 interview with author Peter Janney for his book \"Mary's Mosaic\", journalist and Kennedy intimate Charles Bartlett emphasized the serious nature of Pinchot Meyer's romance with the late president, stating, \"That was a dangerous relationship. Jack was in love with Mary Meyer. He was certainly smitten with her, he was heavily smitten. He was very frank with me about it.\"\n\nIn October 1963, one month before his assassination, Kennedy wrote a letter to Mary Meyer, imploring her to join him for a tryst. The unsent letter, written on White House stationery and retained by Kennedy's personal secretary Evelyn Lincoln, sold in June 2016 at auction for just under $89,000. The letter reads: \"Why don’t you leave suburbia for once – come and see me – either here – or at the Cape next week or in Boston the 19th. I know it is unwise, irrational, and that you may hate it – on the other hand you may not – and I will love it. You say that it is good for me not to get what I want. After all of these years – you should give me a more loving answer than that. Why don’t you just say yes.\" The letter is signed \"J.\"\n\nOn October 12, 1964, Pinchot Meyer finished a painting and went for her customary daily walk along the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal towpath in Georgetown. Mechanic Henry Wiggins was trying to fix a car on Canal Road and heard a woman cry out, \"Someone help me, someone help me.\" Wiggins heard two gunshots and ran to a low wall looking upon the path where he saw \"a black man in a light jacket, dark slacks, and a dark cap standing over the body of a white woman.\"\n\nPinchot Meyer's body had two bullet wounds, one in the left temple and one in the back. An FBI forensic expert later said \"dark haloes on the skin around both entry wounds suggested they had been fired at close-range, possibly point-blank\".\n\nApproximately forty minutes after the murder, Washington D.C. Police Detective John Warner spotted a soaking-wet African American man named Ray Crump about a quarter of a mile from the murder scene. Crump wasn’t running; \"he was walking,\" Detective Warner testified at the murder trial. Crump was arrested at 1:15 pm at the murder scene based on car mechanic Wiggins’ statement to police that Crump was the man he had seen standing over the victim’s body. The day after the murder, a second witness, Army Lt. William L. Mitchell, came forward and told police that when jogging on the towpath the preceding day, he had seen a black man trailing a white woman he believed was Mary Meyer. Mitchell’s description of the man’s clothing was similar to the clothing Crump had been wearing that day. On the strength of the statements of these two witnesses, Crump was indicted without a preliminary hearing. However, no gun was ever found, and Crump was never linked to any gun of the type used to murder Mary Pinchot Meyer. The FBI Crime Report, withheld from the defense during the trial and published by Peter Janney in his book \"Mary's Mosaic\", documented that there was no forensic evidence linking Crump to the victim or murder scene. Despite the fact that Pinchot Meyer bled profusely from her head wound, no trace of her blood was found on Crump's person or clothing. On the afternoon of the murder, hours before police had identified the body, CIA official Wistar Janney first placed a call to Meyer’s brother-in-law Ben Bradlee, and then subsequently to Cord Meyer, notifying them both of Meyer’s death.\n\nWhen Crump came to trial, Judge Howard Corcoran ruled Mary Pinchot Meyer's private life could not be disclosed in the courtroom. Pinchot Meyer's background was also kept from Dovey Johnson Roundtree, Crump's lawyer, who later recalled she could find out almost nothing about the murder victim: \"It was as if she existed only on the towpath on the day she was murdered.\" At trial, Roundtree demonstrated the porousness of the police dragnet and showed that the black man described by the two witnesses was approximately 50 pounds heavier and five inches taller than Crump. Crump was acquitted of all charges on July 29, 1965, and the murder remains unsolved. Crump went on to what has been described as a \"horrific life of crime.\" Post-trial revelations, however, appear to further corroborate his innocence in the Meyer murder, notably the likely presence of another black man at the scene after his arrest and the fact that the police search for his jacket was dispatched 15 minutes before his arrest. Crump's attorney Dovey Roundtree, in her autobiography \"Justice Older than the Law\", stated that Crump had an alibi witness but that she disappeared before trial.\n\nCord Meyer left the CIA in 1977. In his 1982 autobiography \"Facing Reality: From World Federalism to the CIA\" he wrote, \"I was satisfied by the conclusions of the police investigation that Mary had been the victim of a sexually motivated assault by a single individual and that she had been killed in her struggle to escape.\" He stated he rejected \"journalistic speculation\" that said he believed his former wife's death had some other explanation.\n\nThe March 2, 1976, issue of the \"National Enquirer\" quoted James Truitt as stating Meyer had a two-year affair with John F. Kennedy and that they smoked marijuana in a White House bedroom. According to Truitt, their first rendezvous occurred after Meyer was chauffeured to the White House in a limousine driven by a Secret Service agent where she was met by Kennedy and taken to a bedroom. He stated that Meyer and Kennedy regularly met in that manner, sometimes two or three times each week, until his assassination. Truitt said the two would \"usually have drinks or dinner alone or sometimes with one of the aides\", and claimed that Meyer offered marijuana cigarettes to Kennedy after one such meeting on April 16, 1962. He said after they smoked three joints, she commented, \"This isn't like cocaine. I'll get you some of that.\" According to the \"Enquirer\", Meyer also kept a diary of the affair. The paper quoted Tony Bradlee — Meyer's sister — as confirming the existence of the affair and the diary, stating that Bradlee found the diary in Meyer's studio after her death, then turned it over to James Jesus Angleton who subsequently burned it at CIA headquarters.\n\nIn an interview with a correspondent from \"The Washington Post\", Truitt confirmed the \"Enquirer\"'s account, stated that Meyer had told him of the affair, and that he had kept notes about what he had been told. According to Truitt, Meyer and Kennedy met approximately 30 times — frequently when Jackie Kennedy was out of town — from January 1962 until the time of the President's death in November 1963. Truitt stated that the two would occasionally have drinks or dinner with one of Kennedy's aides, whom he identified as David Powers and Timothy J. Reardon Jr. Contradicting his earlier account with the \"Enquirer\", Truitt said Kennedy gave the marijuana to Meyer. Truitt acknowledged that he received payment from the \"Enquirer\", but did not disclose the amount of payment.\n\nTruitt's allegations were denied by Kennedy aides Kenneth O'Donnell and Timothy Reardon, Jr., and Powers was unavailable for comment. Pinchot Meyer's sister Tony stated that the Enquirer had quoted her out of context to create the impression that she agreed with Truitt's allegations. The \"Washington Post\", AP and UPI printed a follow-up story which cited assertions by Truitt's physician and his former wife that his judgment was impaired by mental illness. However, Truitt's allegations regarding Pinchot Meyer's affair with the late President Kennedy and the existence of a diary in which she recorded the affair were confirmed in 1995 by her brother-in-law Ben Bradlee in his memoir \"A Good Life\". Kenneth O’Donnell also confirmed the affair in his 1977 interviews with the late author Leo Damore.\n\nBen Bradlee states in his 1995 memoir \"A Good Life\" that he and his wife Tony received a phone call on the night of the murder from Pinchot Meyer's friend Anne Truitt in Japan, who was looking for James Jesus Angleton at the Bradlee house. Truitt advised all of them, including Angleton, of the existence of the Pinchot Meyer diary and the urgent need to retrieve it, given its details of her affair with President Kennedy during the last two years of his life. A decision was then quickly made by Bradlee, his wife, James Angleton and his wife Cicely, and another friend present at the scene, to keep the diary's existence from authorities.\n\nAccording to Bradlee's 1995 account – one of at least four conflicting versions of the events surrounding the diary – the search at Pinchot Meyer's art studio behind the Bradlee house began the day after the murder. Bradlee says he and his wife arrived at the studio with tools to obtain entry, since they had no key, and upon arriving they found Angleton in the process of picking the lock with special tools he had for that purpose. \"The fact that the CIA's most controversial counterintelligence specialist had been caught in the act of breaking and entering, and looking for her diary,\" Bradlee said, was not something he considered appropriate for public disclosure. With respect to the diary itself, he added, he and his wife, upon reading it and seeing that it revealed Pinchot Meyer's affair with the late President Kennedy, \"concluded this was in no sense a public document, despite the braying of the knee jerks about some public right to know.\"\n\nBradlee's 1995 memoir account conflicted with the testimony he gave at the July 1965 trial of Ray Crump, the African-American laborer accused of Pinchot Meyer's murder, where he was asked by prosecuting attorney Alfred Hantman whether he had made any effort to gain entrance to his sister-in-law's art studio on the evening of the murder. Bradlee answered in the affirmative, but gave no indication of any difficulty in entering the padlocked premises, nor of the presence of anyone else accompanying him in this endeavor. Asked by Hantman, \"Now besides the usual articles of Mrs. Meyer's avocation, did you find there any other articles of her personal property?\" Bradlee replied, \"There was a pocketbook there,\" adding that it contained keys, a wallet, cosmetics, and pencils. He made no mention of the diary.\n\nUpon learning years later of the existence, contents and alleged burning of the diary, prosecutor Alfred Hantman and defense attorney Dovey Johnson Roundtree, as well as D.C. Police Detective Bernie Crooke, stated that knowledge of that information at the time of the trial would have materially affected the proceedings. \"I’d have been very upset at the time if I’d known that the deceased's diary had been destroyed,\" Crooke told author Ron Rosenbaum in 1976. In a 1991 interview with the late author Leo Damore, Hantman said that he had been \"totally unaware of who Mary Meyer was or what her connections were,\" and that having that knowledge \"could have changed everything.\" In her 2009 autobiography, \"Justice Older than the Law\", defense counsel Dovey Johnson Roundtree expressed shock at learning of the diary's significance from Bradlee's book. \"How differently my line of cross-examination would have run had I been aware, on July 20, 1965, of the story Mr. Bradlee told thirty years later in his autobiography . . . James Angleton's awareness of the diary's existence and his interest in finding it, reading it, and destroying it – all of that unsettled me deeply when I read Mr. Bradlee's 1995 account, as did his insistence that the diary was a private document…Had I been aware of it, I would have felt compelled to pursue it.\"\n\nPinchot Meyer biographers Peter Janney and Nina Burleigh have both criticized Bradlee's omission of key information under oath. \"Bradlee had excoriated Cord Meyer [Pinchot Meyer's ex-husband] for his ‘derisive scorn’ for the people's right to know in the 1960s, but the rules changed when the subject of a story was his sister-in-law,\" Burleigh says. \"The First Amendment champion of the Watergate investigation admitted in his memoir that he gave Mary Meyer's diary to the CIA because it was ‘a family document.’\"\n\nIn 1983, former Harvard University psychology lecturer Timothy Leary claimed that in the spring of 1962, Pinchot Meyer, who, according to her biographer Nina Burleigh \"wore manners and charm like a second skin\", told Leary she was taking part in a plan to avert worldwide nuclear war by convincing powerful male members of the Washington establishment to take mind-altering drugs, which would presumably lead them to conclude that the Cold War was meaningless.\n\nAccording to Leary, Meyer had sought him out for the purpose of learning how to conduct LSD sessions with these powerful men, including, she strongly implied, President John F. Kennedy, who was then her lover. Leary alleged that Pinchot Meyer told him she had shared in this plan with at least seven other Washington socialite friends who held similar political views and were trying to supply LSD to a small circle of high-ranking government officials. Leary also claimed that Pinchot Meyer had asked him for help while in a state of fear for her own life after the assassination of President Kennedy.\n\nIn his biography \"Flashbacks\" (1983), Leary claimed he had a call from Pinchot Meyer soon after the Kennedy assassination during which she sobbed and said, \"They couldn't control him any more. He was changing too fast...They've covered everything up. I gotta come see you. I'm afraid. Be careful.\"\n\nBurleigh does not draw a conclusion as to whether Meyer participated in LSD sessions with President Kennedy or other powerful figures, but also does not dismiss Leary's claims out of hand. Burleigh confirms Pinchot Meyer's own use of LSD, her involvement with Leary during his tenure at Harvard, and that this involvement occurred at the same time as Pinchot Meyer's intimate association with President Kennedy. Burleigh also states that the timing of Pinchot Meyer's visits to Leary coincided with the dates of Meyer's known private meetings with Kennedy. Burleigh writes:\n\nMary's visits to Timothy Leary during the time she was also Kennedy's lover suggest that Kennedy knew more about hallucinogenic drugs than the CIA might have been telling him. No one has ever confirmed that Kennedy tried LSD with Mary. But the timing of her visits to Timothy Leary do coincide with her known private meetings with the president.\n\nCiting interviews with the late author Leo Damore, Peter Janney asserts in his book \"Mary's Mosaic\" that Kennedy and Meyer did have a mild psychedelic experience together, probably LSD or psilocybin, in May 1963 at the Georgetown home of journalist Joseph Alsop. According to Janney, Meyer's friend, journalist Anne Chamberlin, confided to Damore that this event did take place. Chamberlin was also allegedly part of Meyer's LSD group in Washington.\n\nLSD was then legal in the US, and its use to facilitate artistic endeavors was common in some of Pinchot Meyer's social circles.\n\nIn the 2009 film \"An American Affair\" Gretchen Mol starred as a character based on Mary Pinchot Meyer.\n\nIn the Canadian-American miniseries \"The Kennedys\" (2011) Meyer was portrayed by Canadian actress Nahanni Johnstone.\n\n\"Hardcover Mysteries\": \"The Mary Pinchot Meyer Murder\", narrated by David Baldacci.

His birth documents have not survived, but it is recorded that he served as the senior cannon officer (artillery leader) during the 1621–22 war with Sweden. In subsequent conflicts with Sweden, he fought in the failed 1625 campaign, capturing the bridge crossing at Daugava, and particularly distinguished himself as a regimental commander during the 1626–29 war, in the Battle of Vistula.\n\nAs one of the last Protestant leaders in the predominantly Catholic region, he granted his Lutsk mansion to the Lithuanian Calvinist synod for use as an evangelical school.\n\nReturning to military service, Mikołaj Abramowicz served in the 1633–34 Smolensk War and, holding the rank of colonel, was one of the negotiators in the June 1634 Treaty of Polyanovka, which ended the conflict. In 1638 King Władysław IV Vasa nominated him as Cześnik Wielki Litewski (Great Grand Duke's Cup-Bearer of Lithuania). He rose to the office of castellan of Mścisław in 1639, General (top commander) of the Artillery of Lithuania in 1640, Voivode of Mścisław in 1643, and voivode of Trakai in 1647.\n\nIn view of Abramowicz's prominent activity in the Lithuanian Calvinist synod at a time of increased Counter-Reformation in the Commonwealth, his ability to retain high offices, was taken as sign of King Władysław's faith in his leadership. The confidence proved particularly well-founded during the 1645 event known as the Trubchevsk incident (\"incydent trubecki\"), as Lithuanian nobles rose in opposition to the king's treaty with Russia, which signed away the fortified border town of Trubchevsk. The king sent Abramowicz at the head of a company of King's Guards to restore order and oversee the territorial transfer. In the aftermath, the Lithuanian Tribunal lodged a high complaint against Abramowicz for illegal expropriation of property and sentenced him to loss of honor, banishment and a high compensatory damage. The sentences were never carried out due to the intervention of the king, who rewarded Abramowicz's loyalty with advancement to the Trakai Voivodeship.\n\nIn the final three years of his life, Mikołaj Abramowicz served as a diplomat in the 1648 negotiations with Sweden, and in the Senate talks of 1649. In his final public function, he signed the Senate resolution known as the \"Evangelical Salvation\", providing certain rights to Calvinists. He died in Vilnius in his early to mid-fifties.\n\n"}
{"id": "148234", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=148234", "title": "Mirror image", "text": "Mirror image\n\nA mirror image (in a plane mirror) is a reflected duplication of an object that appears almost identical, but is reversed in the direction perpendicular to the mirror surface. As an optical effect it results from reflection off of substances such as a mirror or water. It is also a concept in geometry and can be used as a conceptualization process for 3-D structures.\n\nIn geometry, the mirror image of an object or two-dimensional figure is the virtual image formed by reflection in a plane mirror; it is of the same size as the original object, yet different, unless the object or figure has reflection symmetry (also known as a P-symmetry).\n\nTwo-dimensional mirror images can be seen in the reflections of mirrors or other reflecting surfaces, or on a printed surface seen inside-out. If we look at an object that is effectively two-dimensional (such as writing) and then turn it towards a mirror, the object turns through an angle of 180º and we see a left-right reversal in the mirror. In this example, it is the change in orientation rather than the mirror itself that causes the observed reversal. Another example is when we stand with our backs to the mirror and face an object that's in front of the mirror. Then we compare the object with its reflection by turning ourselves 180º, towards the mirror. Again we perceive a left-right reversal due to a change in orientation. So, in these examples the mirror does not actually cause the observed reversals.\n\nThe concept of reflection can be extended to three-dimensional objects, including the inside parts, even if they are not transparent. The term then relates to structural as well as visual aspects. A three-dimensional object is reversed in the direction perpendicular to the mirror surface. In physics, mirror images are investigated in the subject called geometrical optics. \n\nIn chemistry, two versions (isomers) of a molecule, one a \"mirror image\" of the other, are called enantiomers if they are not \"superposable\" (the correct technical term, though the term \"superimposable\" is also used) on each other. That is an example of chirality (chemistry). In general, an object and its mirror image are called enantiomorphs.\n\nIf a point of an object has coordinates (\"x\", \"y\", \"z\") then the image of this point (as reflected by a mirror in the \"y\", \"z\" plane) has coordinates (-\"x\", \"y\", \"z\"). Thus reflection is a reversal of the coordinate axis perpendicular (normal) to the mirror's surface. Although a plane mirror reverses an object only in the direction normal to the mirror surface, there is usually a \"perception\" of a left-right reversal. Hence, the reversal is called \"lateral inversion\". The perception of a left-right reversal is probably because the left and right of an object are defined by its perceived top and front, but there is still some debate about the explanation amongst psychologists.The psychology of the perceived left-right reversal is discussed in \"Much ado about mirrors\" by Professor Michael Corballis (see \"external links\", below). \n\nReflection in a mirror \"does\" result in a change in chirality, more specifically from a right-handed to a left-handed coordinate system (or vice versa). As a consequence, if one looks in a mirror and lets two axes (up-down and front-back) coincide with those in the mirror, then this gives a reversal of the third axis (left-right). \n\nIf a person stands side-on to a mirror, left and right will be reversed \"directly\" by the mirror, because the person's left-right axis is then normal to the mirror plane. However, it's important to understand that there are \"always\" only two enantiomorphs, the object and its image.Therefore, no matter how the object is oriented towards the mirror, all the resulting images are fundamentally identical (as Professor Corballis explains in his paper \"Much ado about mirrors\", mentioned above). \n\nIn the picture of the mountain reflected in the lake (photograph top right), the reversal normal to the reflecting surface is obvious. Notice that there is no obvious front-back or left-right of the mountain. In the example of the urn and mirror (photograph to right), the urn is fairly symmetrical front-back (and left-right).Thus, no obvious reversal of any sort can be seen in the mirror image of the urn.\n\nA mirror image appears more obviously three-dimensional if the observer moves, or if the image is viewed using binocular vision. This is because the relative position of objects changes as the observer's perspective changes, or is differently viewed with each eye.\n\nLooking through a mirror from different positions (but necessarily with the point of observation restricted to the halfspace on one side of the mirror) is like looking at the 3D mirror image of space; without further mirrors only the mirror image of the halfspace before the mirror is relevant; if there is another mirror, the mirror image of the other halfspace is too.\n\nA mirror does not just produce an image of what would be there without it; it also changes the light distribution in the halfspace in front of and behind the mirror. A mirror hanging on the wall makes the room brighter because additional light sources appear in the mirror image. However, the appearance of additional light does not violate the conservation of energy principle, because some light no longer reaches behind the mirror, as the mirror simply re-directs the light energy. In terms of the light distribution, the virtual mirror image has the same appearance and the same effect as a real, symmetrically arranged half-space behind a window (instead of the mirror). Shadows may extend from the mirror into the halfspace before it, and vice versa.\n\nIn mirror writing a text is deliberately displayed in mirror image, in order to be read through a mirror. For example, emergency vehicles such as ambulances or fire engines use mirror images in order to be read from a driver's rear-view mirror. Some movie theaters also take advantage of mirror writing in a Rear Window Captioning System used to assist individuals with hearing impairments watching the film.\n\nIn the case of two mirrors, in planes at an angle α, looking through both from the sector which is the intersection of the two halfspaces, is like looking at a version of the world rotated by an angle of 2α; the points of observations and directions of looking for which this applies correspond to those for looking through a frame like that of the first mirror, and a frame at the mirror image with respect to the first plane, of the second mirror. If the mirrors have vertical edges then the left edge of the field of view is the plane through the right edge of the first mirror and the edge of the second mirror which is on the right when looked at directly, but on the left in the mirror image.\n\nIn the case of two parallel mirrors, looking through both once is like looking at a version of the world which is translated by twice the distance between the mirrors, in the direction perpendicular to them, away from the observer. Since the plane of the mirror in which one looks directly is beyond that of the other mirror, one always looks at an oblique angle, and the translation just mentioned has not only a component away from the observer, but also one in a perpendicular direction. The translated view can also be described by a translation of the observer in opposite direction. For example, with a vertical periscope, the shift of the world is away from the observer and down, both by the length of the periscope, but it is more practical to consider the equivalent shift of the observer: up, and backward.\n\nIt is also possible to create a non-reversing mirror by placing two first surface mirrors at 90º to give an image which is not reversed.\n\n\n"}

Beginning in Season 38, he gained an identity as Murray, hosting the \"What's the Word on the Street?\" segments that precede each episode of Sesame Street where he asks people what each Word of the Day means.\n\nBy season 39, he began appearing in his own segment \"Murray Has a Little Lamb\" where he goes to a certain school with his pet purple lamb Ovejita.\n\nIn season 40, Murray started serving as a host of the new \"block format\", presenting the letter and number of the day, introducing upcoming sketches within the episodes, and announcing the sponsors.\n\nMurray was given a new segment in Season 42 called \"Murray's Science Experiments\" which are spread through the tune-ins.\n\nJoey Mazzarino talked about Murray Monster in his interview with the Tough Pigs website where he quoted \"I kinda keep Murray like, who's the guy on \"Fraggle Rock\"? Uncle Traveling Matt. Because I feel like he goes out into the real world, and when we put him onto the street, there's just a million characters who can service this.\"\n\n"}
{"id": "97340", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=97340", "title": "Nautilus", "text": "Nautilus\n\nThe nautilus (from the Latin form of the original , 'sailor') is a pelagic marine mollusc of the cephalopod family Nautilidae, the sole extant family of the superfamily Nautilaceae and of its smaller but near equal suborder, Nautilina.\n\nIt comprises six living species in two genera, the type of which is the genus \"Nautilus\". Though it more specifically refers to species \"Nautilus pompilius\", the name chambered nautilus is also used for any of the Nautilidae. All are protected under CITES Appendix II.\n\nNautilidae, both extant and extinct, are characterized by involute or more or less convolute shells that are generally smooth, with compressed or depressed whorl sections, straight to sinuous sutures, and a tubular, generally central siphuncle. Having survived relatively unchanged for millions of years, nautiluses represent the only living members of the subclass nautiloidea, and are often considered \"living fossils\".\n\nThe word nautilus is derived from the Greek ναυτίλος \"nautílos\" and originally referred to the paper nautiluses of the genus \"Argonauta\", which are actually octopuses. The word \"nautílos\" literally means \"sailor\", as paper nautiluses were thought to use two of their arms as sails.\n\nThe \"tentacles\" of the nautiluses are actually cirri (singular: cirrus), composed of long, soft, flexible appendages which are retractable into corresponding hardened sheaths. Unlike the 8–10 head appendages of coleoid cephalopods, nautiluses have many cirri. In the early embryonic stages of nautilus development a single molluscan foot differentiates into a total of 60–90 cirri, varying even within a species. Nautilus cirri also differ from the tentacles of some coleoids in that they are non-elastic and lack pads or suckers. Instead, nautilus cirri adhere to prey by means of their ridged surface. Nautiluses have a powerful grip, and attempts to take an object already grasped by a nautilus may tear away the animal's cirri, which will remain firmly attached to the surface of the object. The main cirri emerge from sheaths which cohere into a single firm fleshy mass. Also, the pair of cirri before the eye (pre-ocular) and the pair of cirri behind the eye (post-ocular) are separate from the others. These are more evidently grooved, with more pronounced ridges. They are extensively ciliated and are believed to serve an olfactory purpose.\n\nThe radula is wide and distinctively has nine teeth.\n\nThe mouth consists of a parrot-like beak made up of two interlocking jaws capable of ripping the animal's food— mostly crustaceans— from the rocks to which they are attached. Males can be superficially differentiated from females by examining the arrangement of tentacles around the buccal cone: males have a spadix organ (shaped like a spike or shovel) located on the left side of the cone making the cone look irregular, whereas the buccal cone of the female is bilaterally symmetrical.\n\nThe crop is the largest portion of the digestive tract, and is highly extensible. From the crop, food passes to the small muscular stomach for crushing, and then goes past a digestive caecum before entering the relatively brief intestine.\n\nLike all cephalopods, the blood of the nautilus contains hemocyanin, which is blue in its oxygenated state. There are two pairs of gills which are the only remnants of the ancestral metamerism to be visible in extant cephalopods. Oxygenated blood arrives at the heart through four ventricles and flows out to the animal's organs through distinct aortas but returns through veins which are too small and varied to be specifically described. The one exception to this is the vena cava, a single large vein running along the underside of the crop into which nearly all other vessels containing deoxygenated blood empty. All blood passes through one of the four sets of filtering organs (composed of one pericardial appendage and two renal appendages) upon leaving the vena cava and before arriving at the gills for re-oxygenation. Blood waste is emptied through a series of corresponding pores into the pallial cavity.\n\nThe central component of the nautilus nervous system is the oesophageal nerve ring which is a collection of ganglia, commissures, and connectives that together form a ring around the animal's oesophagus. From this ring extend all of the nerves forward to the mouth, tentacles, and funnel; laterally to the eyes and rhinophores; and posteriorly to the remaining organs.\n\nThe nerve ring does not constitute what is typically considered a cephalopod \"brain\": the upper portion of the nerve ring lacks differentiated lobes, and most of the nervous tissue appears to focus on finding and consuming food (i.e., it lacks a \"higher learning\" center). Nautiluses also tend to have rather short memory spans, and the nerve ring is not protected by any form of brain case.\n\nNautiluses are the sole living cephalopods whose bony body structure is externalized as a planispiral shell. The animal can withdraw completely into its shell and close the opening with a leathery hood formed from two specially folded tentacles. The shell is coiled, aragonitic, nacreous and pressure resistant, imploding at a depth of about . The nautilus shell is composed of two layers: a matte white outer layer, and a striking white iridescent inner layer. The innermost portion of the shell is a pearlescent blue-gray. The osmeña pearl, contrarily to its name, is not a pearl, but a jewellery product derived from this part of the shell.\n\nInternally, the shell divides into camerae (chambers), the chambered section being called the phragmocone. The divisions are defined by septa, each of which is pierced in the middle by a duct, the siphuncle. As the nautilus matures it creates new, larger camerae, and moves its growing body into the larger space, sealing the vacated chamber with a new septum. The camerae increase in number from around four at the moment of hatching to thirty or more in adults.\n\nThe shell colouration also keeps the animal cryptic in the water. When seen from above, the shell is darker in color and marked with irregular stripes, which helps it blend into the dark water below. The underside is almost completely white, making the animal indistinguishable from brighter waters near the surface. This mode of camouflage is called countershading.\n\nThe nautilus shell presents one of the finest natural examples of a logarithmic spiral, although it is not a golden spiral. The use of nautilus shells in art and literature is covered at nautilus shell.\n\n\"Nautilus pompilius\" is the largest species in the genus. One form from Indonesia and northern Australia, once called \"Nautilus repertus\", may reach in diameter. However, most nautilus species never exceed . \"Nautilus macromphalus\" is the smallest species, usually measuring only . A dwarf population from the Sulu Sea (\"Nautilus pompilius suluensis\") is even smaller, with a mean shell diameter of .\n\nTo swim, the nautilus draws water into and out of the living chamber with its hyponome, which uses jet propulsion. While water is inside the chamber, the siphuncle extracts salt from it and diffuses it into the blood. The animal adjusts its buoyancy only in long term density changes by osmosis, either removing liquid from its chambers or allowing water from the blood in the siphuncle to slowly refill the chambers. This is done in response to sudden changes in buoyancy that can occur with predatory attacks of fish, which can break off parts of the shell. This limits nautiluses in that they cannot operate under the extreme hydrostatic pressures found at depths greater than approximately , and in fact implode at about that depth, causing instant death. The gas also contained in the chambers is slightly below atmospheric pressure at sea level. The maximum depth at which they can regulate buoyancy by osmotic removal of chamber liquid is not known.\n\nThe nautilus has the extremely rare ability to withstand being brought to the surface from its deep natural habitat without suffering any apparent damage from the experience. Whereas fish or crustaceans brought up from such depths inevitably arrive dead, a nautilus will be unfazed despite the pressure change of as much as . The exact reasons for this ability, which is thought to be coincidental rather than specifically functional, are not known, though the perforated structure of the animal's vena cava is thought to play an important role.\n\nUnlike many other cephalopods, nautiluses do not have what many consider to be good vision; their eye structure is highly developed but lacks a solid lens. Whereas a sealed lens allows for the formation of highly focused and clear, detailed surrounding imagery, nautiluses have a simple pinhole eye open to the environment which only allows for the creation of correspondingly simple imagery.\n\nInstead of vision, the animal is thought to use olfaction (smell) as the primary sense for foraging and for locating and identifying potential mates.\n\nThe \"ear\" of the nautilus consists of structures called \"otocysts\" located immediately behind the pedal ganglia near the nerve ring. They are oval structures densely packed with elliptical calcium carbonate crystals.\n\nNautiluses are much closer to the first cephalopods that appeared about 500 million years ago than the early modern cephalopods that appeared maybe 100 million years later (ammonoids and coleoids). They have a seemingly simple brain, not the large complex brains of octopus, cuttlefish and squid, and had long been assumed to lack intelligence. But the cephalopod nervous system is quite different from that of other animals, and recent experiments have shown not only memory, but a changing response to the same event over time.\n\nIn a study in 2008, a group of nautiluses (\"N. pompilius\") were given food as a bright blue light flashed until they began to associate the light with food, extending their tentacles every time the blue light was flashed. The blue light was again flashed without the food 3 minutes, 30 minutes, 1 hour, 6 hours, 12 hours, and 24 hours later. The nautiluses continued to respond excitedly to the blue light for up to 30 minutes after the experiment. An hour later they showed no reaction to the blue light. However, between 6 and 12 hours after the training, they again responded to the blue light, but more tentatively. The researchers concluded that nautiluses had memory capabilities similar to the \"short-term\" and \"long-term memories\" of the more advanced cephalopods, despite having different brain structures. However the long-term memory capability of nautiluses was much shorter than that of other cephalopods. The nautiluses completely forgot the earlier training 24 hours later, in contrast to octopuses, for example, which can remember conditioning for weeks afterwards. However, this may be simply the result of the conditioning procedure being suboptimal for sustaining long-term memories in nautiluses. Nevertheless, the study showed that scientists had previously underestimated the memory capabilities of nautiluses.\n\nNautiluses reproduce by laying eggs. Gravid females attach the fertilized eggs, either singly or in small batches, to rocks in warmer waters (21-25 Celsius), whereupon the eggs take eight to twelve months to develop until the juveniles hatch. Females spawn once per year and regenerate their gonads, making nautiluses the only cephalopods to present iteroparity or polycyclic spawning.\n\nNautiluses are sexually dimorphic, in that males have four tentacles modified into an organ, called the \"spadix\", which transfers sperm into the female's mantle during mating. At sexual maturity, the male shell becomes slightly larger than the female's. Males have been found to greatly outnumber females in practically all published studies, accounting for 60 to 94% of all recorded individuals at different sites.\n\nThe lifespan of nautiluses may exceed 20 years, which is exceptionally lengthy for a cephalopod, many of whom live less than three even in captivity and under ideal living conditions. However, nautiluses typically do not reach sexual maturity until they are about 15 years old, limiting their reproductive lifespan to often less than five years.\n\nNautiluses are found in only the Indo-Pacific, from 30° N to 30° S latitude and 90° E to 175° E longitude. They inhabit the deep slopes of coral reefs.\n\nNautiluses usually inhabit depths of several hundred metres. It has long been believed that nautiluses rise at night to feed, mate and lay eggs, but it appears that, in at least some populations, the vertical movement patterns of these animals are far more complex. The greatest depth at which a nautilus has been sighted is (\"N. pompilius\"). Implosion depth for nautilus shells is thought to be around . Only in New Caledonia, the Loyalty Islands, and Vanuatu can nautiluses be observed in very shallow water, at depths of as little as . This is due to the cooler surface waters found in these southern hemisphere habitats as compared to the many equatorial habitats of other nautilus populations – these usually being restricted to depths greater than . Nautiluses generally avoid water temperatures above .\n\nNautiluses are scavengers and opportunistic predators. They eat molts of lobsters, hermit crabs, and carrion of any kind.\n\nFossil records indicate that nautiloids have not evolved much during the last 500 million years. Many were initially straight-shelled, as in the extinct genus \"Lituites\". They developed in the Late Cambrian period and became a significant group of sea predators during the Ordovician period. Certain species reached over in size. The other cephalopod subclass, Coleoidea, diverged from the nautiloids long ago and the nautilus has remained relatively unchanged since. Nautiloids were much more extensive and varied 200 million years ago. Extinct relatives of the nautilus include ammonites, such as the baculites and goniatites.\n\nThe family Nautilidae has its origin in the Trigonocerataceae (Centroceratina), specifically in the Syringonautilidae of the Late Triassic and continues to this day with \"Nautilus\", the type genus, and its close relative, \"Allonautilus\".\n\nThe fossil record of Nautilidae begins with \"Cenoceras\" in the Late Triassic, a highly varied genus that makes up the Jurassic \"Cenoceras\" complex. \"Cenoceras\" is evolute to involute, and globular to lentincular; with a suture that generally has a shallow ventral and lateral lobe and a siphuncle that is variable in position but never extremely ventral or dorsal. \"Cenoceras\" is not found above the Middle Jurassic and is followed by the Upper Jurassic-Miocene \"Eutrephoceras\".\n\n\"Eutrephoceras\" is generally subglobular, broadly rounded laterally and ventrally, with a small to occluded umbilicus, broadly rounded hyponomic sinus, only slightly sinuous sutures, and a small siphuncle that is variable in position.\n\nNext to appear is the Lower Cretaceous \"Strionautilus\" from India and the European ex-USSR, named by Shimankiy in 1951. \"Strionautilus\" is compressed, involute, with fine longitudinal striations. Whorl sections are subrectangular, sutures sinuous, the siphuncle subcentral.\n\nAlso from the Cretaceous is \"Pseudocenoceras\", named by Spath in 1927. \"Pseudocenoceras\" is compressed, smooth, with subrectangular whorl sections, flattened venter, and a deep umbilicus. The suture crosses the venter essentially straight and has a broad, shallow, lateral lobe. The siphuncle is small and subcentral. \"Pseudocenoceras\" is found in the Crimea and in Libya.\n\n\"Carinonautilus\" is a genus from the Upper Cretaceous of India, named by Spengler in 1919. \"Carinonautilus\" is a very involute form with high whorl section and flanks that converge on a narrow venter that bears a prominent rounded keel. The umbilicus is small and shallow, the suture only slightly sinuous. The siphuncle is unknown.\n\n\"Obinautilus\" has also been placed in Nautilidae by some authorities, though it may instead be an argonautid octopus.\n\nThe family Nautilidae contains up to six extant species and several extinct species:\n\n\nRecent genetic data has pointed to there being only three extant species: \"A. scrobiculatus\", \"N. macromphalus\", and \"N. pompilius\", with \"N. belauensis\" and \"N. stenomphalus\" both subsumed under \"N. pompilius\", possibly as subspecies.\n\nThe following taxa associated with the family Nautilidae are of uncertain taxonomic status:\n\nThroughout the world, nautilus are collected or fished for sale as live animals or to carve the shells for souvenirs and collectibles, not for just the shape of their shells, but also the nacreous inner shell layer, which is used as a pearl substitute. The low fecundity, late maturity, long gestation period and long life-span of nautiluses suggest that these species are vulnerable to over-exploitation and demand for the ornamental shell is causing population declines. The threats from trade in these shells has led to countries such as Indonesia legally protecting the chambered nautilus with fines of up to US$8,500 and/or 5 years in prison for trading in this species. Despite their legal protection, these shells are openly sold in tourist areas in Asia. The continued trade of these animals has led to a call for increased protection and in 2016 all species in Family Nautilidae were added to CITES Appendix II, regulating international trade.\n\n\nNotes\n\nBibliography\n\n"}
{"id": "27080", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27080", "title": "Odo (Star Trek)", "text": "Odo (Star Trek)\n\nOdo , played by René Auberjonois, is a fictional character in the science fiction television series \"\". He is a member of a shapeshifting species called Changelings and serves as the head of security for the space station Deep Space Nine on which the show is set. Intelligent, observant and taciturn, Odo uses his unique abilities throughout the show to maintain security on the DS9 station and, later, aids the Bajoran people and the Federation throughout the Dominion War against his own people, the Founders.\n\nThe original Writer's Bible from 1992 for described Odo as follows:\n\nOdo, an alien male, middle-aged curmudgeon, and a shape-shifter. In his natural state he is a gelatinous liquid. He was a Bajoran law enforcement officer on the space station under the Cardassians. Starfleet decides to have him continue in that role, since he's extremely savvy about the Promenade and all who frequent it. His backstory is: 50 years ago, with no memory of his past, he was found alone in a mysterious spacecraft that appeared in the Denarias asteroid belt. He was found by the Bajoran and lived amongst them. At first he was sort of an Elephant Man, a source of curiosity and humor as he turned himself into a chair or pencil. Finally he realized he would have to take the form of a humanoid to assimilate and function in their environment. He does it, but resents it. As a result, Odo performs a uniquely important role in the ensemble: he is a character who explores and comments on Human values. Because he is forced to pass as one of us, his point of view usually comes with a cynical and critical edge. But he can't quite get it right, this humanoid shape, though he continues to try. So he looks a little unfinished in a way. He's been working on it a long time. Someone might ask him: Why don't you take the form of a younger man. His answer: I would if I could. He has the adopted child syndrome, searching for his own personal identity. Although he doesn't know anything about his species, he is certain that justice is an integral part of their being, because the necessity for it runs through every fiber of his body – a racial memory. That's why he became a law man. He has a couple of Bajoran deputies; he doesn't allow weapons on the Promenade, and once every day he must return to his gelatinous form. \n\nActor Rene Auberjonous describes Odo as \"a very unformed being\" who was \"trying to get some kind of shape to his life\". Co-creator of \"\", Michael Piller, speaks of Odo's role within the show as being prompted by needing \"a character who represented the traditions of Spock and Data, the outsider who looks in at humanity.\" \n\nLate in the , in the episode “”, an Odo who has lived an additional 200 years tells the “current” Kira Nerys that he has loved her from the time their friendship first began. With this revelation, Kira and the “current” Odo eventually become a couple.\n\nIn the Mirror Universe, Odo is the supervisor of the mining complex at Terok Nor. He is a brutal taskmaster over Terran slaves there and tolerates no deviation from his strict rules. Relatively little is known of him, as no one in the Mirror Universe is aware that the wormhole exists or who Odo's people are. During a mining accident, Odo begins an evacuation of the Terran workers from the complex. Julian Bashir, seizing the opportunity to escape, disintegrates him with a disruptor.\n\nIn this reality, Odo has his own set of rules called the \"Rules of Obedience\" and quotes one of the rules in the same way that regular universe Quark would quote his \"Rules of Acquisition\".\n\nAfter filming of the episode \"\", which was mirror Odo's sole onscreen appearance, actor Rene Auberjonois liked the alternate uniform so much he began wearing it while playing the regular universe version of Odo as well.\n\nIn the initial \"Deep Space Nine\" relaunch novels, Odo is succeeded as security chief by Ro Laren, who is working for the Bajoran Militia. He also sent a Jem'Hadar ambassador to the Alpha Quadrant to foster understanding in the Dominion of other cultures, and soon returned to DS9. \n\nIn the \"Star Trek: Deep Space Nine - Millennium\" series of novels, it is revealed that Odo rarely shifted into smaller forms such as insects due to a psychological block from his original \"training\" under Doctor Mora. The novel series also speculates that the Founders placed a mental block on Odo's abilities to make it difficult for him to alter his face, thus explaining why he can never get faces quite right, even after linking with other Changelings on several occasions.\n\nIn the \"Star Trek: Terok Nor\" novel \"Night of the Wolves\", Odo was found in a spherical module in the Denorios Belt by the Cardassian vessel \"Kevalu\", which was under the command of Dalin Malyn Ocett, in 2345.\n\nIn the \"Star Trek: Typhon Pact\" novel \"Raise the Dawn\", Odo returned to the Alpha Quadrant to help Sisko investigate reports that the Typhon Pact, an alliance of the Federation's enemies, have stolen Jem'Hadar technology to perfect their own quantum slipstream drive, only to be trapped in the Alpha Quadrant when the wormhole was seemingly destroyed thanks to Kira's attempt to stop a Typhon Pact ship from using it again. Sisko offered Odo a place on his new ship, the \"Robinson\", but the novel ends with Odo deciding to remain on Bajor for a time to think about what he will do next.\n\n"}
{"id": "167880", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=167880", "title": "Philip Nitschke", "text": "Philip Nitschke\n\nPhilip Haig Nitschke (; born 8 August 1947) is an Australian humanist, author, former physician and founder and director of the pro-euthanasia group Exit International. He campaigned successfully to have a legal euthanasia law passed in Australia's Northern Territory and assisted four people in ending their lives before the law was overturned by the Government of Australia. Nitschke was the first doctor in the world to administer a legal, voluntary, lethal injection, after which the patient activated the syringe using a computer. Nitschke states that he and his group are regularly subject to harassment by authorities. In 2015 Nitschke burned his medical practising certificate in response to what he saw as onerous conditions that violated his right to free speech, imposed on him by the Medical Board of Australia. Nitschke is variously referred to in the media as \"Dr Death\" or \"the Elon Musk of assisted suicide\".\n\nBorn in 1947 in rural South Australia, Nitschke studied physics at the University of Adelaide, gaining a PhD from Flinders University in laser physics in 1972. Rejecting a career in the sciences, he instead travelled to the Northern Territory to take up work with the Aboriginal land rights activist Vincent Lingiari and the Gurindji at Wave Hill. After the hand-back of land by the Prime Minister, Gough Whitlam, Nitschke became a Northern Territory Parks and Wildlife ranger. However, after badly injuring his subtalar joint, which effectively finished his career as a ranger, he began studying for a medical degree. In addition to having long been interested in studying medicine he has suffered from hypochondria most of his adult life and futilely hoped with his medical studies to educate himself out of the problem. He graduated from the University of Sydney Medical School in 1989.\n\nAfter graduating Nitschke worked as an intern at Royal Darwin Hospital, and then as an after hours general practitioner. When the Northern Territory branch of the Australian Medical Association publicly opposed the proposed Northern Territory legislation to provide for legal euthanasia, Nitschke and a small group of dissenting Territory doctors published a contrary opinion in the NT News under the banner \"Doctors for change\". This put him in a position of an informal spokesperson for the proposed legislation. After the Rights of the Terminally Ill Act (ROTI Act) came into force on 1 July 1996, Nitschke assisted four terminally ill people to end their lives using the Deliverance Machine he developed. This practice was ceased when the ROTI Act was effectively nullified by the Australian Parliament's Euthanasia Laws Act 1997.\n\nAfter the ROTI Act was nullified Nitschke began providing advice to others about how they can end their lives, leading to the formation of Exit International in 1997. A notable case of Nitschke's was that of Nancy Crick, aged 69. On 22 May 2002, Crick, in the presence of over 20 friends and family (but not Nitschke), took a lethal dose of barbiturates, went quickly to sleep and died within 20 minutes. Nitschke had encouraged Crick to enter palliative care, which she did for a number of days before returning home again. She had undergone multiple surgeries to treat bowel cancer and was left with multiple dense and inoperable bowel adhesions that left her in constant pain and frequently in the toilet with diarrhoea. She was not, however, terminally ill at the time of her death. Nitschke said the scar tissue from previous cancer surgery had caused her suffering. \"She didn't actually want to die when she had cancer. She wanted to die after she had cancer treatment,\" he said.\n\nNitschke made headlines in New Zealand when he announced plans to accompany eight New Zealanders to Mexico where the drug Nembutal, capable of producing a fatal overdose, can be purchased legally. He also made headlines, even angering some fellow right-to-die advocates, when he presented his plan to launch a \"death ship\" that would have allowed him to circumvent local laws by euthanising people from around the world in international waters.\n\nIn the 2007 Australian federal election Nitschke ran against the Australian politician Kevin Andrews in the Victorian seat of Menzies but was unsuccessful.\n\nIn 2009 Nitschke helped to promote \"Dignified Departure\", a 13-hour, pay-television program on doctor-assisted suicide in Hong Kong and mainland China. The program aired in October in China on the Family Health channel, run by the official China National Radio.\n\nOrganisations opposed to euthanasia, as well as some supporting euthanasia, are critical of Nitschke and his methods.\n\nIn February 2014 Nitschke was approached after a workshop by Nigel Brayley, 45. Brayley was facing ongoing questions about the death of his wife, which police were treating as suspected murder. Two other female friends of his had also died, one of whom is still missing. Nitschke recounts that Brayley rebuffed suggestions to seek counselling, and had already obtained the drug Nembutal. Brayley then committed suicide in May 2014. Although Nitschke was unaware of the investigation at the time, he now believes that Brayley, whom he described as a \"serial killer\", had made a rational decision to commit suicide rather than face long imprisonment. Nitschke stated that he does not believe he could have changed Brayley's mind, that Brayley was not his patient, that Brayley was not depressed and did not seek or want Nitschke's advice. The Medical Board of Australia (MBA) and Beyondblue said Nitschke had an obligation to refer the man to a psychologist or psychiatrist (a view dismissed by the NT Supreme Court in 2015).\n\nOn 23 July 2014, as a consequence of the Brayley case, the MBA voted to use emergency powers to suspend his practitioner's licence immediately, on the grounds that he presented \"a serious risk to public health and safety\". Nitschke said he would appeal the suspension, which he claimed was politically motivated, and that the Board \"made it clear that what they really object to is the way I think. It's ideas they object to — namely, my belief that people should have a right to suicide, is something they think is contrary to medical practice.\" The MBA later clarified that the suspension was an interim measure pending the outcome of an inquiry. Nitschke said the suspension will not affect his work for Exit International and that he had not practised medicine for years.\n\nNitschke appealed to a MBA tribunal in Darwin to have his July 2014 suspension from practising medicine overturned. In late 2014 the appeal was rejected on the grounds that, although it was accepted that Brayley was not Nitschke's patient, the controversial concept of rational suicide was inconsistent with the medical profession's code of conduct and that, as a medical practitioner providing advice on suicide, he posed a serious risk because people may elect to commit suicide believing it to be a pathway sanctioned by a medical practitioner and perhaps the medical profession generally. Nitschke then appealed the tribunal's decision to the Darwin Supreme Court.\n\nOn 6 July 2015 the Northern Territory supreme court upheld Nitschke's appeal, finding the emergency suspension of his licence by the MBA should not have been upheld by a review tribunal. Justice Hiley's ruling said that the tribunal and board had misconstrued the doctors’ code of conduct, which requires them to \"protect and promote the health of individuals\", as extending to all doctors and all individuals. \"A doctor would constantly need to fear that any interaction with any other individual or community, including an individual who is not and never has been his or her patient, may be in breach of the (code), even if the doctor did nothing in circumstances where there was no other obligation to do something,\" he said. Nitschke said the MBA's erroneous interpretation was \"ludicrous\" and flew in the face of common law. Nitschke's lawyer will apply for costs of approximately AU$300,000, which were paid using donations, including $20,000 from Swiss euthanasia organisation Dignitas. \n\nIn October 2015 the MBA lifted Nitschke's suspension but drew up a list of 25 conditions under which Nitschke could continue to practise. These conditions included prohibitions on giving advice or information to the public or patients about euthanasia, or Nembutal, or suicide, and forcing him to rescind his endorsement of and involvement with the 'Peaceful Pill' handbook and related videos. In response Nitschke, calling the MBA's actions \"a heavy-handed and clumsy attempt to restrict the free flow of information on end-of-life choice\", surveyed more than 1,000 members of his advocacy group, Exit International, and received strong support for ending his medical registration. As a consequence of the MBA restrictions and the results of the member survey, Nitschke publicly burned his medical practising certificate and announced the end of his medical career, vowing to continue to promote euthanasia.\n\nNitschke stated that he will remain a doctor and will legitimately use the title \"doctor\" (he has a PhD), and will continue to see patients and Exit members in clinics that he runs in Australia and other countries. In the wake of this incident, Nitschke and his partner, Fiona Stewart, decided in 2015 to relocate to the more liberal politico-legal environment of Holland.\n\nNitschke states that he and his group are regularly subject to harassment by authorities, including detention and questioning at international airports, and raids on homes and the premises of Exit International.\n\nOn 2 May 2009 Nitschke was detained for nine hours by British Immigration officials at Heathrow Airport after arriving for a visit to the UK to lecture on voluntary euthanasia and end-of-life choices. Nitschke said it was a matter of free speech and that his detention said something about changes to British society which were \"quite troubling\". Nitschke was told that he and his wife, author Fiona Stewart, were detained because the workshops may contravene British law. However, although assisting someone to commit suicide in the UK was illegal, the law did not apply to a person lecturing on the concept of euthanasia, and Nitschke was allowed to enter. Dame Joan Bakewell, the British government's \"Voice of Older People\", said that the current British law on assisted suicide was \"a mess\" and that Nitschke should have been made more welcome in the UK.\n\nOn 1 August 2014, after euthanasia advocate Max Bromson, 66, who suffered from terminal bone cancer, ended his life with Nembutal in a Glenelg motel room, surrounded by family members, police carried out a three-hour raid on Exit International's Adelaide premises, interrogating Nitschke and seizing Nitschke's phones, computers and other items. Nitschke said he felt violated by the \"heavy-handed and unnecessary\" police actions and confiscations that would cripple Exit International's activities. In August 2016, after exactly two years of investigation, South Australian police advised that no charges would be laid against anyone over the death.\n\nIn April 2016 British police, acting on an Interpol drug alert, forced entry into the home of a member of Nitschke's organisation, retired professor Dr Avril Henry, aged 81, who was in ill health. Without knocking, police —accompanied by a psychiatrist, GP and social worker— forced their way into Dr Henry's home by smashing her glass front door at 10pm and questioned her for six hours, confiscating a bottle of imported Nembutal, and leaving at 4am. They decided Dr Henry \"had capacity\" and would not be sectioned (detained involuntarily for mental assessment). Worried that the police would return and confiscate her remaining Nembutal, she committed suicide four days later. Dr Nitschke commented that police had made Dr Henry's last days on earth a misery and that “police need to realise that in the UK, suicide is not a crime, and mental health authorities need to recognise that not everyone who seeks to end their life is in need of psychiatric intervention\", adding that the police action was \"a significant abuse of power against a vulnerable elderly woman\".\n\nIn May 2018 Australian Federal Police used local police force personnel in different regions of the country to conduct late night raids on the homes of elderly Exit members, demanding to know if they had bought the euthanasia drug Nembutal. Pensioners in poor health, some in wheelchairs, were forced to leave their beds and answer police questions.\n\nIn October 2016 New Zealand police, in a \"sting\" operation code named \"Operation Painter\", set up roadblocks (checkpoints) outside an Exit International meeting and took down names and addresses of all attendees. Some of the elderly members of the group were later visited at their homes by police with warrants, and searches were conducted. Computers, tablets, cameras, letters and books were seized. Nitschke said police actions were unprecedented and probably in breach of the Bill of Rights, which guaranteed freedom of association. The police operation is now the subject of an Independent Police Conduct Authority investigation. Legal action against the police followed. In March 2018, the Independent Police Conduct Authority found Operation Painter to be illegal.\n\nThis coincided with another action by New Zealand police in which 76-year old Patsy McGrath, a member of Nitschke's Exit group, had her home raided in 2016 and her store-bought helium balloon cylinder confiscated under warrant. The confiscation of the cylinder was later found to be illegal and it was returned to her in 2018.\n\nOn 29 April 2009 Nitschke said: \"It seems we demand humans to live with indignity, pain and anguish whereas we are kinder to our pets when their suffering becomes too much. It simply is not logical or mature. Trouble is, we have had too many centuries of religious claptrap.\" He works mainly with older people from whom he gains inspiration, saying: \"You get quite inspired and uplifted by the elderly folk who see this as quite a practical approach\".\n\nIn July 2009 Nitschke said he no longer believed voluntary euthanasia should only be available to the terminally ill, but that elderly people afraid of getting old and incapacitated should also have a choice.\n\nWhile Nitschke expects that Australia will eventually legislate for a, \"very, very conservative,\" form of euthanasia, \"certainly in the first steps\", he states that a growing number of people importing their own euthanasia drugs, \"really don't care if the law is changed or not\".\n\nPalliative care specialists state that many requests for euthanasia arise from fear of physical or psychological distress in the patient's last days, and that widespread and equitable availability of specialist palliative care services will reduce requests for euthanasia. Nitschke is dismissive of this argument. \"We have too many people who have the best palliative care in the world and they still want to know that they can put an end to things,\" he said. \"By and large, palliative care have done pretty well out of the argument over the euthanasia issue, because they are the ones that have argued that they just need better funding and then no one will ever want to die – that's a lie.\"\n\nIn 2010 the Victorian Institute of Forensic Medicine released a report into Australian deaths caused by the drug Nembutal, which Nitschke recommends as a euthanasia drug. Of the 51 deaths studied, 14 were of people between the ages of 20 and 40. Nitschke acknowledged that the information about the drug that was provided online could be accessed by people below the age of 50 who were not terminally ill, but argued that the risk was necessary in order to help the elderly and the seriously ill.\n\nIt was alleged that Joe Waterman, 25, had committed suicide after accessing Nitschke's online euthanasia handbook, by misrepresenting his age as over 50. Waterman subsequently imported Nembutal and ended his life. In another case Lucas Taylor, 26, committed suicide in Germany by taking Nembutal after soliciting advice at an Exit International online forum (which, according to Nitschke, he accessed by claiming his age was 65).\n\nNitschke argues that an individual person has a fundamental right to control their own death just as they have a right to control their own life. He believes in having the \"Peaceful Pill\" available for every adult of sound mind.\n\nOn 22 May 2009 it was disclosed in the press, citing WikiLeaks, that the Australian Government had added the online \"Peaceful Pill Handbook\" to the blacklist maintained by the Australian Communications and Media Authority used to filter internet access to citizens of Australia. The Australian Communications Minister, Stephen Conroy, planned to introduce legislation just before the 2010 election to make internet service providers block a blacklist of \"refused classification\" websites. The blacklist is expected to include Exit's websites and other similar sites. Nitschke said the proposals were the \"final nail in the coffin for euthanasia advocacy\" in Australia, where people are banned from discussing end-of-life issues over the phone, buying books about it or importing printed material on it. \"The one avenue we had open to us was the internet, and now it looks like it will be part of Conroy's grand plan to provide a so-called clean feed to Australia. It's outrageous.\"\n\nIn April 2010 Nitschke began holding a series of \"Hacking Masterclasses\" to teach people how to circumvent the Australian internet filter. Access to Nitschke's online \"Peaceful Pill Handbook\" was blocked during trials of the government's filter. A government spokeswoman said euthanasia would not be targeted by the proposed filter, but confirmed that \"The (website) ... for accessing an electronic version of the [Peaceful Pill Handbook] was classified as refused classification\" because it provided detailed instruction in \"crimes relating to the possession, manufacture and importation of barbiturates\".\n\nNitschke said Exit International would investigate if it could set up its own proxy server or VPN tunnel, so its members had a safe way of accessing its information.\n\nIn January 2018, YouTube deleted Nitschke's YouTube channel \"Exityourtube\". The channel had been operating for 10 years. YouTube gave no reason why the account was deleted without notice.\n\nOn 10 September 2010 Nitschke complained that the Commercials Advice self-regulator of advertising content on Australian commercial television had prevented the television screening of a paid advertisement from Exit International in which an actor depicted a dying man who requested the option of voluntary euthanasia. Commercials Advice reportedly cited Section 2.17.5 of the \"Commercial Television Code of Practice\": Suicide. The advertisement was felt to condone the practice of suicide. Nitschke responded that the acts of Commercials Advice constitute interference with the right to free speech. Similar TV commercials, planned for use during Nitschke's Canadian lecture tour of 2010, were likewise banned by the Television Bureau of Canada, after lobbying by anti-euthanasia pressure groups.\n\nIn 2010 Nitschke planned to use billboards in Australia to feature the message \"85 per cent of Australians support voluntary euthanasia but our government won't listen\". In September 2010, Nitschke's billboard advertising campaign was blocked by \"Billboards Australia\". Billboards Australia cited section of the NSW Crimes Act that outlaws the aiding or abetting of suicide or attempted suicide. Nitschke was told to provide legal advice outlining how his billboard did not break this law, a request Nitschke described as \"ludicrous\", pointing out that the billboards urge \"political change and in no way could be considered to be in breach of the crimes act\". Nitschke said he had sought a legal opinion from prominent human rights lawyer Greg Barns. The lawyer was able to convince Billboards Australia to rescind its ruling, in part.\n\nNitschke created devices to aid people who want euthanasia, including a product called the \"exit bag\" (a large plastic bag with a drawstring allowing it to be secured around the neck) and the \"CoGen\" (or \"Co-Genie\") device. The CoGen device generates the deadly gas carbon monoxide, which is inhaled with a face mask.\n\nIn December 2008 Nitschke released details of a euthanasia machine to the media. He called it \"flawless\" and \"undetectable\", saying the new process uses ordinary household products including a barbecue gas bottle — available from hardware stores — filled with nitrogen. Nitschke developed a process in which patients lose consciousness immediately and die a few minutes later.\n\nNitschke said: \"So it's extremely quick and there are no drugs. Importantly this doesn't fail – it's reliable, peaceful, available and with the additional benefit of undetectability.\"\n\nIn 2009 Nitschke made a barbiturate testing kit available, initially launched in the UK, then Australia. Nitschke said the kit was made available by Exit International in response to growing demand for something to test the Nembutal obtained from Mexico, often delivered in the post without labels. \"They want to be sure they have the right concentration,\" Nitschke said. The kits have chemicals that change colour when mixed with Nembutal. He was detained for an hour for questioning on arrival at Auckland Airport in New Zealand on a trip to hold public meetings and launch the kit.\n\nIn October 2009 Nitschke announced his intention to inform people at his workshops where to obtain a long-storage form of sodium pentobarbital (Nembutal) that manufacturers say can be stored for up to fifty years without degrading. Liquid forms of pentobarbital degrade within a few years, while the solid form (a white, crystalline powder) does not. Nitschke intends to advise people on how to reconstitute the pill into liquid form for ingestion if and when it ever becomes appropriate. He said that he sees it as a way of keeping people accurately informed and allowing them to make viable choices. The provision of this information would be consistent with good medical care, in his view.\n\nIn 2012 Nitschke started a beer-brewing company (\"Max Dog Brewing\") for the purpose of importing nitrogen canisters. Nitschke stated that the gas cylinders can be used for both brewing and, if required, to end life at a later stage in a \"peaceful, reliable [and] totally legal\" manner. Nitschke said, \"[nitrogen] was undetectable even by autopsy, which was important to some people\".\n\nAn Australian anti-euthanasia campaigner complained to the Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency (AHPRA) about the canisters. AHPRA has undertaken to investigate. The investigation is not complete.\n\nFollowing a 2013 workshop showcasing Nitschke's nitrogen gas product, the AMA's WA branch president and general practitioner, Richard Choong, said that he was strongly opposed to it, regardless of its technical legality, since \"any machine that can help you kill yourself can be abused, misused and maliciously used\". Nitschke responded that without such information most elderly people who want to end their lives hang themselves, which is \"an embarrassment and shame\".\n\nIn 2014 Australians Valerie Seeger and Claire Parsons used the Max Dog brewing equipment to commit suicide. Police investigated but decided not to prosecute Nitschke after a two and a half year investigation.\n\nIn 2017 Nitschke invented the 3D-printed suicide capsule, which he named the Sarco machine, \"sarco\" being short for \"sarcophagus\". The Sarco consists of a detachable coffin mounted on a stand containing a nitrogen canister. The coffin or capsule contains a touchpad, and once an activation code is entered, \"the person is again asked if they wish to die\". An affirmative answer causes nitrogen to flow into the capsule, displacing oxygen, and death follows shortly thereafter. The Sarco machine cannot be printed on small 3D printers. The Sarco offers a \"euphoric death\".\n\nNitschke plans to release the open source plans for the Sarco by 2019.\n\nIn an article in December 2017 about the Sarco, Newsweek referred to Nitschke as \"the Elon Musk of assisted suicide\".\n\nNitschke began his comedy career at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival in August 2015 with his show \"Dicing with Dr Death\". \"ThreeWeeks\" called it \"engaging and highly thought-provoking\". He performed a newer Australian version of his show, retitled \"Practising without a License\", at the Melbourne International Comedy Festival in April 2016 and again in Darwin in August 2016. The \"Herald Sun\" reviewed his performance favorably: \"[Nitschke] presented his case with such measure, warm humour and intelligence that even his puns were excusable\".\n\n\nNitschke is the author of three books:\n\nPublished 2005. In reviewing the book, bioethicist Michael Cooke wrote \"Nitschke's insight has been to recognise that assisted suicide is no longer about compassionate medicine, but about technology. Through his work on the web, he is gradually transforming voluntary euthanasia from a mere philosophy into an open-source internet enterprise.\"\n\nThe Peaceful Pill Handbook print edition was originally published in the U.S. in 2006, written by Nitschke and partner Fiona Stewart; the eHandbook version is updated six times a year. Prohibited or at limited sale in Australia and New Zealand.\n\nIn 2008 the on-line version of the handbook was launched. Called The Peaceful Pill eHandbook, it contains video clips on assisted suicide and voluntary euthanasia methods such as barbiturates, over the counter drugs, gases and poisons.\n\n\nAn autobiography (with Peter Corris); published by Melbourne University Press in 2013. Nitschke's personal story from his early days, to his activist student days in Adelaide, to working with Aboriginal land rights groups in Australia's Far North; to his successful campaign to have euthanasia legalised in Australia\n\nA 2004 documentary film, \"Mademoiselle and the Doctor\", focused on the quest of a retired Perth professor, Lisette Nigot, a healthy 79-year-old, to seek a successful method of voluntary euthanasia. She sought advice from Nitschke. Nigot took an overdose of medication which she had bought in the United States and died, not long before her 80th birthday. In a note to Nitschke thanking him for his support, she described him as a crusader working for a worthwhile humane cause. \"After 80 years of a good life, I have [had] enough of it\", she wrote, \"I want to stop it before it gets bad.\"\n\nIn 2014 Nitschke featured in the documentary \"35 Letters\" about Australian woman Angelique Flowers. Angelique was a young member of Exit International. She was 30 years old when she died of bowel cancer. The film premiered at the Sydney Film Festival in 2014 where it won the Australian Foundation Award.\n\nIn 2009 Nitschke helped to promote \"Dignified Departure\", a 13-hour, pay-television program on doctor-assisted suicide in Hong Kong and mainland China. The program aired in October in China on the Family Health channel, run by the official China National Radio.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "670433", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=670433", "title": "Potter's field", "text": "Potter's field\n\nA potter's field, paupers' grave or common grave is a place for the burial of unknown or indigent people. \"Potter's field\" is of Biblical origin, referring to Akeldama, bought by the high priests of Jerusalem for the burial of strangers, criminals, and the poor, and paid for with the coins that had been paid to Judas Iscariot for his identification of Jesus.\n\nThe term \"potter's field\" comes from - in the New Testament of the Bible, in which Jewish priests take 30 pieces of silver returned by a remorseful Judas:\n\nThe site referred to in these verses is traditionally known as Akeldama, in the valley of Hinnom, which was a source of potters' clay. After the clay was removed, such a site would be left unusable for agriculture and thus might as well become a graveyard for those who could not be buried in an orthodox cemetery. This may be the origin of the name. A field where potters dug for clay would also be \"conveniently already full of trenches and holes.\"\n\nThe author of Matthew was drawing on earlier Biblical references to potters' fields. The passage continues, with verses 9 and 10:\n\nThis is based on a quotation from Zechariah (). However, Matthew attributes the quote to Jeremiah. The author of Matthew may have been mistaken. There are two other possible reasons for the reference. First, Jeremiah also speaks of buying a field, in . That field is a symbol of hope, not despair as mentioned in Matthew, and the price is 17 pieces of silver. The author of Matthew could have combined the words of Zechariah and Jeremiah, while only citing the \"major\" prophet. Secondly, \"Jeremiah\" was sometimes used to refer to the Books of the Prophets \"in toto\" as \"The Law\" is sometimes used to refer to Moses' five books – Genesis through Deuteronomy, the Pentateuch.\n\nCraig Blomberg suggests that the use of the blood money to buy a burial ground for foreigners in may hint at the idea that \"Jesus' death makes salvation possible for all the peoples of the world, including the Gentiles.\" Other scholars do not read the verse as referring to Gentiles, but rather to Jews who are not native to Jerusalem.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "854081", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=854081", "title": "Regeneration (biology)", "text": "Regeneration (biology)\n\nIn biology, regeneration is the process of renewal, restoration, and growth that makes genomes, cells, organisms, and ecosystems resilient to natural fluctuations or events that cause disturbance or damage. Every species is capable of regeneration, from bacteria to humans. Regeneration can either be complete where the new tissue is the same as the lost tissue, or incomplete where after the necrotic tissue comes fibrosis. At its most elementary level, regeneration is mediated by the molecular processes of gene regulation. Regeneration in biology, however, mainly refers to the morphogenic processes that characterize the phenotypic plasticity of traits allowing multi-cellular organisms to repair and maintain the integrity of their physiological and morphological states. Above the genetic level, regeneration is fundamentally regulated by asexual cellular processes. Regeneration is different from reproduction. For example, hydra perform regeneration but reproduce by the method of budding.\n\nThe hydra and the planarian flatworm have long served as model organisms for their highly adaptive regenerative capabilities. Once wounded, their cells become activated and start to remodel tissues and organs back to the pre-existing state. The Caudata (\"urodeles\"; salamanders and newts), an order of tailed amphibians, is possibly the most adept vertebrate group at regeneration, given their capability of regenerating limbs, tails, jaws, eyes and a variety of internal structures. The regeneration of organs is a common and widespread adaptive capability among metazoan creatures. In a related context, some animals are able to reproduce asexually through fragmentation, budding, or fission. A planarian parent, for example, will constrict, split in the middle, and each half generates a new end to form two clones of the original.\n\nEchinoderms (such as the sea star), crayfish, many reptiles, and amphibians exhibit remarkable examples of tissue regeneration. The case of autotomy, for example, serves as a defensive function as the animal detaches a limb or tail to avoid capture. After the limb or tail has been autotomized, cells move into action and the tissues will regenerate. Limited regeneration of limbs occurs in most fishes and salamanders, and tail regeneration takes place in larval frogs and toads (but not adults). The whole limb of a salamander or a triton will grow again and again after amputation. In reptiles, chelonians, crocodilians and snakes are unable to regenerate lost parts, but many (not all) kinds of lizards, geckos and iguanas possess regeneration capacity in a high degree. Usually, it involves dropping a section of their tail and regenerating it as part of a defense mechanism. While escaping a predator, if the predator catches the tail, it will disconnect.\n\nEcosystems can be regenerative. Following a disturbance, such as a fire or pest outbreak in a forest, pioneering species will occupy, compete for space, and establish themselves in the newly opened habitat. The new growth of seedlings and community assembly process is known as regeneration in ecology.\n\nPattern formation in the morphogenesis of an animal is regulated by genetic induction factors that put cells to work after damage has occurred. Neural cells, for example, express growth-associated proteins, such as GAP-43, tubulin, actin, an array of novel neuropeptides, and cytokines that induce a cellular physiological response to regenerate from the damage. Many of the genes that are involved in the original development of tissues are reinitialized during the regenerative process. Cells in the primordia of zebrafish fins, for example, express four genes from the homeobox \"msx\" family during development and regeneration.\n\n\"Strategies include the rearrangement of pre-existing tissue, the use of adult somatic stem cells and the dedifferentiation and/or transdifferentiation of cells, and more than one mode can operate in different tissues of the same animal. All these strategies result in the re-establishment of appropriate tissue polarity, structure and form.\" During the developmental process, genes are activated that serve to modify the properties of cell as they differentiate into different tissues. Development and regeneration involves the coordination and organization of populations cells into a blastema, which is \"a mound of stem cells from which regeneration begins\". Dedifferentiation of cells means that they lose their tissue-specific characteristics as tissues remodel during the regeneration process. This should not be confused with the transdifferentiation of cells which is when they lose their tissue-specific characteristics during the regeneration process, and then re-differentiate to a different kind of cell.\n\nArthropods are known to regenerate appendages following loss or autotomy. Regeneration among arthropods is restricted by molting such that hemimetabolous insects are capable of regeneration only until their final molt whereas most crustaceans can regenerate throughout their lifetimes. Molting cycles are hormonally regulated in arthropods, although premature molting can be induced by autotomy. Mechanisms underlying appendage regeneration in hemimetabolous insects and crustaceans is highly conserved. During limb regeneration species in both taxa form a blastema following autotomy with regeneration of the excised limb occurring during proecdysis. Arachnids, including scorpions, are known to regenerate their venom, although the content of the regenerated venom is different than the original venom during its regeneration, as the venom volume is replaced before the active proteins are all replenished.\n\nMany annelids (segmented worms) are capable of regeneration. For example, \"Chaetopterus variopedatus\" and \"Branchiomma nigromaculata\" can regenerate both anterior and posterior body parts after latitudinal bisection. The relationship between somatic and germline stem cell regeneration has been studied at the molecular level in the annelid \"Capitella teleta\". Leeches, however, appear incapable of segmental regeneration. Furthermore, their close relatives, the branchiobdellids, are also incapable of segmental regeneration. However, certain individuals, like the lumbriculids, can regenerate from only a few segments. Segmental regeneration in these animals is epimorphic and occurs through blastema formation. Segmental regeneration has been gained and lost during annelid evolution, as seen in oligochaetes, where head regeneration has been lost three separate times.\n\nAlong with epimorphosis, some polychaetes like \"Sabella pavonina\" experience morphallactic regeneration. Morphallaxis involves the de-differentiation, transformation, and re-differentation of cells to regenerate tissues. How prominent morphallactic regeneration is in oligochaetes is currently not well understood. Although relatively under-reported, it is possible that morphallaxis is a common mode of inter-segment regeneration in annelids. Following regeneration in \"L. variegatus\", past posterior segments sometimes become anterior in the new body orientation, consistent with morphallaxis.\n\nFollowing amputation, most annelids are capable of sealing their body via rapid muscular contraction. Constriction of body muscle can lead to infection prevention. In certain species, such as \"Limnodrilus\", autolysis can be seen within hours after amputation in the ectoderm and mesoderm. Amputation is also thought to cause a large migration of cells to the injury site, and these form a wound plug.\n\nTissue regeneration is widespread among echinoderms and has been well documented in starfish \"(Asteroidea)\", sea cucumbers \"(Holothuroidea)\", and sea urchins \"(Echinoidea).\" Appendage regeneration in echinoderms has been studied since at least the 19th century. In addition to appendages, some species can regenerate internal organs and parts of their central nervous system. In response to injury starfish can autotomize damaged appendages. Autotomy is the self-amputation of a body part, usually an appendage.  Depending on severity, starfish will then go through a four-week process where the appendage will be regenerated. Some species must retain mouth cells in order to regenerate an appendage, due to the need for energy. The first organs to regenerate, in all species documented to date, are associated with the digestive tract. Thus, most knowledge about visceral regeneration in holothurians concerns this system.\n\nRegeneration research using Planarians began in the late 1800s and was popularized by T.H. Morgan at the beginning of the 20th century. Alejandro Sanchez-Alvarado and Philip Newmark transformed planarians into a model genetic organism in the beginning of the 20th century to study the molecular mechanisms underlying regeneration in these animals. Planarians exhibit an extraordinary ability to regenerate lost body parts. For example, a planarian split lengthwise or crosswise will regenerate into two separate individuals. In one experiment, T.H. Morgan found that a piece corresponding to 1/279th of a planarian or a fragment with as few as 10,000 cells can successfully regenerate into a new worm within one to two weeks. After amputation, stump cells form a blastema formed from neoblasts, pluripotent cells found throughout the planarian body. New tissue grows from neoblasts with neoblasts comprising between 20 and 30% of all planarian cells. Recent work has confirmed that neoblasts are totipotent since one single neoblast can regenerate an entire irradiated animal that has been rendered incapable of regeneration. In order to prevent starvation a planarian will use their own cells for energy, this phenomenon is known as de-growth.\n\nLimb regeneration in the axolotl and newt has been extensively studied and researched. Urodele amphibians, such as salamanders and newts, display the highest regenerative ability among tetrapods. As such, they can fully regenerate their limbs, tail, jaws, and retina via epimorphic regeneration leading to functional replacement with new tissue. Salamander limb regeneration occurs in two main steps. First, the local cells dedifferentiate at the wound site into progenitor to form a blastema. Second, the blastemal cells will undergo proliferation, patterning, differentiation and growth using similar genetic mechanisms that deployed during embryonic development. Ultimately, blastemal cells will generate all the cells for the new structure.\nAfter amputation, the epidermis migrates to cover the stump in 1–2 hours, forming a structure called the wound epithelium (WE). Epidermal cells continue to migrate over the WE, resulting in a thickened, specialized signaling center called the apical epithelial cap (AEC). Over the next several days there are changes in the underlying stump tissues that result in the formation of a blastema (a mass of dedifferentiated proliferating cells). As the blastema forms, pattern formation genes – such as HoxA and HoxD – are activated as they were when the limb was formed in the embryo. The positional identity of the distal tip of the limb (i.e. the autopod, which is the hand or foot) is formed first in the blastema. Intermediate positional identities between the stump and the distal tip are then filled in through a process called intercalation. Motor neurons, muscle, and blood vessels grow with the regenerated limb, and reestablish the connections that were present prior to amputation. The time that this entire process takes varies according to the age of the animal, ranging from about a month to around three months in the adult and then the limb becomes fully functional. Researchers at Australian Regenerative Medicine Institute at Monash University, have published that when macrophages, which eat up material debris, were removed, salamanders lost their ability to regenerate and formed scarred tissue instead.\n\nIn spite of the historically few researchers studying limb regeneration, remarkable progress has been made recently in establishing the neotenous amphibian the axolotl (\"Ambystoma mexicanum\") as a model genetic organism. This progress has been facilitated by advances in genomics, bioinformatics, and somatic cell transgenesis in other fields, that have created the opportunity to investigate the mechanisms of important biological properties, such as limb regeneration, in the axolotl. The Ambystoma Genetic Stock Center (AGSC) is a self-sustaining, breeding colony of the axolotl supported by the National Science Foundation as a Living Stock Collection. Located at the University of Kentucky, the AGSC is dedicated to supplying genetically well-characterized axolotl embryos, larvae, and adults to laboratories throughout the United States and abroad. An NIH-funded NCRR grant has led to the establishment of the Ambystoma EST database, the Salamander Genome Project (SGP) that has led to the creation of the first amphibian gene map and several annotated molecular data bases, and the creation of the research community web portal.\n\nAnurans can only regenerate their limbs during embryonic development. Once the limb skeleton has developed regeneration does not occur (Xenopus can grow a cartilaginous spike after amputation). Reactive oxygen species (ROS) appear to be required for a regeneration response in the anuran larvae. ROS production is essential to activate the Wnt signaling pathway, which has been associated with regeneration in other systems. Limb regeneration in salamanders occurs in two major steps. First, adult cells de-differentiate into progenitor cells which will replace the tissues they are derived from. Second, these progenitor cells then proliferate and differentiate until they have completely replaced the missing structure.\n\n\"Hydra\" is a genus of freshwater polyp in the phylum Cnidaria with highly proliferative stem cells that gives them the ability to regenerate their entire body. Any fragment larger than a few hundred epithelial cells that is isolated from the body has the ability to regenerate into a smaller version of itself. The high proportion of stem cells in the hydra supports its efficient regenerative ability.\n\nRegeneration among hydra occurs as foot regeneration arising from the basal part of the body, and head regeneration, arising from the apical region. Regeneration tissues that are cut from the gastric region contain polarity, which allows them to distinguish between regenerating a head in the apical end and a foot in the basal end so that both regions are present in the newly regenerated organism. Head regeneration requires complex reconstruction of the area, while foot regeneration is much simpler, similar to tissue repair. In both foot and head regeneration, however, there are two distinct molecular cascades that occur once the tissue is wounded: early injury response and a subsequent, signal-driven pathway of the regenerating tissue that leads to cellular differentiation. This early-injury response includes epithelial cell stretching for wound closure, the migration of interstitial progenitors towards the wound, cell death, phagocytosis of cell debris, and reconstruction of the extracellular matrix.\n\nRegeneration in hydra has been defined as morphallaxis, the process where regeneration results from remodeling of existing material without cellular proliferation. If a hydra is cut into two pieces, the remaining severed sections form two fully functional and independent hydra, approximately the same size as the two smaller severed sections. This occurs through the exchange and rearrangement of soft tissues without the formation of new material.\n\nOwing to a limited literature on the subject, birds are believed to have very limited regenerative abilities as adults. Some studies on roosters have suggested that birds can adequately regenerate some parts of the limbs and depending on the conditions in which regeneration takes place, such as age of the animal, the inter-relationship of the injured tissue with other muscles, and the type of operation, can involve complete regeneration of some musculoskeletal structure. Werber and Goldschmidt (1909) found that the goose and duck were capable of regenerating their beaks after partial amputation and Sidorova (1962) observed liver regeneration via hypertrophy in roosters. Birds are also capable of regenerating the hair cells in their cochlea following noise damage or ototoxic drug damage. Despite this evidence, contemporary studies suggest reparative regeneration in avian species is limited to periods during embryonic development. An array of molecular biology techniques have been successful in manipulating cellular pathways known to contribute to spontaneous regeneration in chick embryos. For instance, removing a portion of the elbow joint in a chick embryo via window excision or slice excision and comparing joint tissue specific markers and cartilage markers showed that window excision allowed 10 out of 20 limbs to regenerate and expressed joint genes similarly to a developing embryo. In contrast, slice excision did not allow the joint to regenerate due to the fusion of the skeletal elements seen by an expression of cartilage markers.\n\nSimilar to the physiological regeneration of hair in mammals, birds can regenerate their feathers in order to repair damaged feathers or to attract mates with their plumage. Typically, seasonal changes that are associated with breeding seasons will prompt a hormonal signal for birds to begin regenerating feathers. This has been experimentally induced using thyroid hormones in the Rhode Island Red Fowls.\n\nMammals are capable of cellular and physiological regeneration, but have generally poor reparative regenerative ability across the group. Examples of physiological regeneration in mammals include epithelial renewal (e.g., skin and intestinal tract), red blood cell replacement, antler regeneration and hair cycling. Male deer lose their antlers annually during the months of January to April then through regeneration are able to regrow them as an example of physiological regeneration. A deer antler is the only appendage of a mammal that can be regrown every year. While reparative regeneration is a rare phenomenon in mammals, it does occur. A well-documented example is regeneration of the digit tip distal to the nail bed. Reparative regeneration has also been observed in rabbits, pikas and African spiny mice. In 2012, researchers discovered that two species of African Spiny Mice, \"Acomys kempi\" and \"Acomys percivali\", were capable of completely regenerating the autotomically released or otherwise damaged tissue. These species can regrow hair follicles, skin, sweat glands, fur and cartilage. In addition to these two species, subsequent studies demonstrated that \"Acomys cahirinus\" could regenerate skin and excised tissue in the ear pinna.\n\nDespite these examples, it is generally accepted that adult mammals have limited regenerative capacity compared to most vertebrate embryos/larvae, adult salamanders and fish. But the regeneration therapy approach of Robert O. Becker, using electrical stimulation, has shown promising results for rats and mammals in general.\n\nSome researchers have also claimed that the MRL mouse strain exhibits enhanced regenerative abilities. Work comparing the differential gene expression of scarless healing MRL mice and a poorly-healing C57BL/6 mouse strain, identified 36 genes differentiating the healing process between MRL mice and other mice. Study of the regenerative process in these animals is aimed at discovering how to duplicate them in humans, such as deactivation of the p21 gene. However, recent work has shown that MRL mice actually close small ear holes with scar tissue, rather than regeneration as originally claimed.\n\nMRL mice are not protected against myocardial infarction; heart regeneration in adult mammals (neocardiogenesis) is limited, because heart muscle cells are nearly all terminally differentiated. MRL mice show the same amount of cardiac injury and scar formation as normal mice after a heart attack. However, recent studies provide evidence that this may not always be the case, and that MRL mice can regenerate after heart damage. \n\nThe regrowth of lost tissues or organs in the human body is being researched. Some tissues such as skin regrow quite readily; others have been thought to have little or no capacity for regeneration, but ongoing research suggests that there is some hope for a variety of tissues and organs. Human organs that have been regenerated include the bladder, vagina and the penis.\n\nAs are all metazoans, humans are capable of physiological regeneration (i.e. the replacement of cells during homeostatic maintenance that does not necessitate injury). For example, the regeneration of red blood cells via erythropoiesis occurs through the maturation of erythrocytes from hematopoietic stem cells in the bone marrow, their subsequent circulation for around 90 days in the blood stream, and their eventual cell-death in the spleen. Another example of physiological regeneration is the sloughing and rebuilding of a functional endometrium during each menstrual cycle in females in response to varying levels of circulating estrogen and progesterone.\n\nHowever, humans are limited in their capacity for reparative regeneration, which occurs in response to injury. One of the most studied regenerative responses in humans is the hypertrophy of the liver following liver injury. For example, the original mass of the liver is re-established in direct proportion to the amount of liver removed following partial hepatectomy, which indicates that signals from the body regulate liver mass precisely, both positively and negatively, until the desired mass is reached. This response is considered cellular regeneration (a form of compensatory hypertrophy) where the function and mass of the liver is regenerated through the proliferation of existing mature hepatic cells (mainly hepatocytes), but the exact morphology of the liver is not regained. This process is driven by growth factor and cytokine regulated pathways. The normal sequence of inflammation and regeneration does not function accurately in cancer. Specifically, cytokine stimulation of cells leads to expression of genes that change cellular functions and suppress the immune response.\n\nAdult neurogenesis is also a form of cellular regeneration. For example, hippocampal neuron renewal occurs in normal adult humans at an annual turnover rate of 1.75% of neurons. Cardiac myocyte renewal has been found to occur in normal adult humans, and at a higher rate in adults following acute heart injury such as infarction. Even in adult myocardium following infarction, proliferation is only found in around 1% of myocytes around the area of injury, which is not enough to restore function of cardiac muscle. However, this may be an important target for regenerative medicine as it implies that regeneration of cardiomyocytes, and consequently of myocardium, can be induced.\n\nAnother example of reparative regeneration in humans is fingertip regeneration, which occurs after phalange amputation distal to the nail bed (especially in children) and rib regeneration, which occurs following osteotomy for scoliosis treatment (though usually regeneration is only partial and may take up to 1 year).\n\nThe ability and degree of regeneration in reptiles differs among the various species, but the most notable and well-studied occurrence is tail-regeneration in lizards. In addition to lizards, regeneration has been observed in the tails and maxillary bone of crocodiles and adult neurogenesis has also been noted. Tail regeneration has never been observed in snakes. Lizards possess the highest regenerative capacity as a group. Following autotomous tail loss, epimorphic regeneration of a new tail proceeds through a blastema-mediated process that results in a functionally and morphologically similar structure.\n\nStudies have shown that some chondrichthyans can regenerate rhodopsin by cellular regeneration, micro RNA organ regeneration, teeth physiological teeth regeneration, and reparative skin regeneration. Rhodopsin regeneration has been studied in skates and rays. After complete photo-bleaching, rhodopsin can completely regenerate within 2 hours in the retina. White bamboo sharks can regenerate at least two-thirds of their liver and this has been linked to three micro RNAs, xtr-miR-125b, fru-miR-204, and has-miR-142-3p_R-. In one study two thirds of the liver was removed and within 24 hours more than half of the liver had undergone hypertrophy. Leopard sharks routinely replace their teeth every 9–12 days and this is an example of physiological regeneration. This can occur because shark teeth are not attached to a bone, but instead are developed within a bony cavity. It has been estimated that the average shark loses about 30,000 to 40,000 teeth in a lifetime. Some sharks can regenerate scales and even skin following damage. Within two weeks of skin wounding the mucus is secreted into the wound and this initiates the healing process. One study showed that the majority of the wounded area was regenerated within 4 months, but the regenerated area also showed a high degree of variability.\n\n\n\n"}

Kornblum was an American coroner who served as Los Angeles County Coroner from 1982 to 1990.\n\nKornblum was born December 5, 1933 in Chicago. He completed his undergraduate studies at the University of California, Los Angeles and earned his medical degree at the University of California, San Francisco. From 1960 to 1961, Kornblum was a Navy medical officer in Saigon.\n\nAfter Kornblum's naval service, he pursued his medical residency at Santa Clara County Hospital. Kornblum discovered that he enjoyed diagnosing illnesses more than treating them and decided to specialize in pathology. In 1966 he took a job with the Maryland Medical Examiner's office, where he rose to the position of chief deputy. There he presided over the autopsy of Yosef Alon.\n\nIn November 1973, Kornblum was named Ventura County's first full-time Chief Medical Examiner-Coroner after the county adopted a new system. He took office on January 1, 1974.\n\nIn 1980, Kornblum left Ventura County to become the top assistant to Los Angeles County Coroner Thomas Noguchi. In 1982 Noguchi was demoted to physician specialist for speaking too freely to the media, moonlighting, and alleged mismanagement. Kornblum was appointed acting coroner. In 1987 he was appointed to the job outright after the Supreme Court of California declined to hear Noguchi's legal challenge of his demotion.\n\nKornblum was praised for improving the office's efficiency and professionalism. He was also recognized for his knowledge of Sudden infant death syndrome, chokehold deaths, and fatalities involving Tasers. However Kornblum's office was also criticized for moving too slow on autopsies, leaving bodies at crime scenes for hours, and for bouncing corpses on freeways due to bad door locks on old coroner vehicles.\n\nNotable autopsies Kornblum performed include John Belushi, Natalie Wood, Truman Capote, William Holden, Karen Carpenter, Ron Settles, and Warren Oates. Outside of his capacity as coroner he testified in the Preppie Murder trial as an expert on chokehold deaths.\n\nIn 1990, Kornblum resigned as Los Angeles County Coroner after an independent audit found that staff shortages and a high homicide rate were leading to unsanitary conditions, including dead insect larvae in the morgue and a body that had decomposed because it had been misplaced, and poor oversight of employees that had allowed for a double-billing scam to take place. Kornblum stated that he agreed with most of the 154 changes called for in the audit and had begun to implement some, but certain changes were impossible due to the \"limited sized of the department's budget and the overwhelming workload\".\n\nKornblum died on September 23, 2008 at his home in La Cañada Flintridge, California.\n"}

D'Arcy (born 1972) is a Canadian neuroscientist, researcher, innovator and entrepreneur. Dr. Ryan D'Arcy co-founded HealthTech Connex Inc. to translate neuroscience advances into health technology breakthroughs and bring them to market.\n\nHe is the Head of Health Sciences and Innovation at Fraser Health's Surrey Memorial Hospital, and a full professor at Simon Fraser University, where he holds the Surrey Memorial Hospital Foundation BC Leadership Chair in Multimodal Technology for Healthcare Innovations.\n\nDr. Ryan D'Arcy has been credited with being an instrumental figure in driving the biotechnology cluster in Halifax, Nova Scotia when he was at the National Research Council (NRC), as well as the health-technology cluster in Metro Vancouver, British Columbia, where he served as founding co-chair of Innovation Boulevard along with former mayor Dianne Watts in 2012.\n\nThat same year, D’Arcy was highlighted as a “Kickass Canadian” amongst other prominent Canadian leaders.\n\nHis scientific work in neuroscience gained international attention when he was part of the NRC research team that developed an advanced virtual reality-based neurosurgical simulation system that helped brain surgeon Dr. David Clarke remove a brain tumour on a patient in 2009. He also developed the Halifax Consciousness Scanner (HCS) while at the NRC, considered by many as a revolutionary neuroscience technology that improves the lives of patients with traumatic brain injuries. The HCS led to the discovery of brain vital signs, which Dr. D’Arcy has led the development through HealthTech Connex Inc. HealthTech Connex has developed the product NeuroCatch, a technology platform for brain vital signs.\n\nBorn and raised in Williams Lake, British Columbia, Ryan D'Arcy attended Brentwood College School, on Vancouver Island, graduating in 1990. He earned a B.Sc. (with distinction) from the University of Victoria in 1996, an M.Sc. in neuropsychology in 1998 and a Ph.D. in neuroscience in 2002 from Dalhousie University. D'Arcy was a Killam Scholar while at Dalhousie University, and is also an engineering licensee (Eng.L.) with a specialization in neurotechnology. In 2001, he became a Research Associate/Postdoctoral Fellowship in Magnetic Resonance Imaging Physics at the National Research Council's Institute for Biodiagnostics.\n\nDr. Ryan D'Arcy is the President and Chief Scientific Officer of HealthTech Connex Inc. He also serves as Head of Health Sciences and Innovations at Fraser Health's Surrey Memorial Hospital, which includes directorship of the NeuroTech and ImageTech Laboratories. Dr. D’Arcy is a professor at Simon Fraser University, where he holds the Surrey Memorial Hospital Foundation BC Leadership Chair in Multimodal technology for Healthcare Innovations.\n\nThroughout his career, Dr. D'Arcy has been advancing brain innovations and technologies through his research. He constantly champions Canada and British Columbia's role in the world's neuroscience sphere. He has also been advocating for the brain to be monitored regularly to track one's health, as part of any other body's vital signs as one does with blood pressure, body temperatures and heart rates. He and his research team is involved with several concussion, brain conditions and traumatic brain injury research, and has been developing technologies to make brain monitoring easier and more accessible to doctors and researchers. \n\nD'Arcy and his neuroscience research team developed the world's first \"brain vital signs\" framework for monitoring cognitive processing. The brain vital signs framework, which derived from D'Arcy's earlier Halifax Consciousness Scanner research, objectively analyzes complex brainwave data through electroencephalography (EEG), which then provides simple, practical and objective physiological markers of brain function. The research team subsequently submitted papers to major research publications to verify the efficacy of brain vital signs. This included the \"Frontiers in Neuroscience Journal\", which became one of the most highly accessed papers in the journal's history and ranked in the top 5% of research outputs scored by Altmetrics. \n\nDr. Ryan D’Arcy is the driving force and original thought leader behind the Simon Fraser University’s ImageTech Lab, a first-of-its-kind research facility in Western Canada, combining state-of-the-art imaging devices to advance brain/body research, and focus on advanced diagnostics and treatment in neurology, mental health and other healthcare areas. A cornerstone in Surrey’s Health Technology District, the lab provides the critical combination of high-field magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) together with high-density magnetoencephalography (MEG)—uniquely embedded within Surrey Memorial Hospital. The ImageTech Lab is a unique partnership between SFU and Fraser Health, with funding support from the Government of Canada’s Western Economic Diversification which supports economic growth in Western Canada. \n\nIn 2002, D’Arcy took a senior leadership role with the National Research Council (NRC) where he founded the NRC’s Institute for Biodiagnostics at the QEII Health Sciences Centre and IWK Health Centre, both affiliated with Dalhousie University. There, he led a team of 40 researchers and trainees, developing new new MRI, MEG, and EEG techniques for mapping the functional areas of the brain, diagnosing brain disorders, and testing experimental treatments.\n\nIn 2008, together with neuroscientist and neurosurgeon Dr. David B. Clarke, D'Arcy was part of the research team at the National Research Council at Dalhousie University in developing the world’s first virtual reality based neurosurgical simulation and rehearsal tool NeuroTouch, which was subsequently licensed to CAE Inc. as NeuroVR. NeuroTouch enabled surgeons and trainees to rehearse patient-specific surgeries in a computer-generated virtual environment using video captured from actual surgical procedures. In 2009, Dr. Clarke and Dr. D'Arcy successfully removed a brain tumour on a patient after mapping out and performing their surgical plan in virtual reality prior to the actual surgery.\n\nD’Arcy and his research team’s work at the NRC led to the development of the Halifax Consciousness Scanner, a portable device that measures electrical activity in the brain and quickly determines neurological function, and can track the progress of patients who have a stroke or brain injury. The technology concept behind the Halifax Consciousness Scanner has received numerous awards, including a 2015 Wall Street Journal Award to Mindful Scientific, Inc. for Global Startup of the Year, which led to the development of a novel brain vital signs framework.\n\nD’Arcy and his research team have also led the characterization of functional MRI activity in white matter, a previously controversial idea. The team has worked since 2006 to publish a series of studies demonstrating that it was possible to detect fMRI activity in white matter brain tissue, which provided a direct functional measures of connectivity for fundamental and clinical science advances.\n\nIn 2009, D’Arcy started working with Trevor Greene, a Canadian war veteran who suffered a devastating brain injury from an axe to the head while fighting in Afghanistan. He contacted Greene after watching the TV documentary “Peace Warrior” to help analyze his functional brain changes throughout his rehabilitation. Committed to making a difference and being an inspiration for others suffering from traumatic brain injury, Greene became part of a D’Arcy’s neuroscience research team to track and measure his brain and mobility improvements that resulted from his ongoing rehabilitation. The project (called “Iron Soldier”) has since progressed to utilizing robotic exoskeleton technology and Trevor's goal is to climb to the Mount Everest base camp.\n\nIn 2012, D’Arcy moved back to British Columbia as Head of Health Sciences and Innovation at Fraser Health's Surrey Memorial Hospital and a professor at Simon Fraser University’s Faculty of Applied Sciences.\n\nIn 2013, The Hon. Stephanie Cadieux, Minister of Children and Family Development for the Province of British Columbia, announced the appointment of D’Arcy to the Surrey Memorial Hospital Foundation BC Leadership Chair in Multimodal Technology for Healthcare Innovations. There, D’Arcy works with research and development teams to create advanced diagnostic and treatment tools for the treatment of people with brain injuries and diseases.\n\nIn April 2013, then City of Surrey Mayor Dianne Watts announced the creation of the Mayor's Health Technology Working Group with D’Arcy as co-chair, composed of leaders from the health, education and development communities to shape a new health-tech region located between Simon Fraser University Surrey and Surrey Memorial Hospital called Innovation Boulevard. The goal is to attract health and technology companies to the city and the idea was modelled after a similar region in Halifax designed by D’Arcy.\n\nLater that year, D'Arcy and former colleague Dr. David B. Clarke teamed up again, this time with Conquer Mobile to develop PeriopSim, a suite of portable surgical simulation training tools used to train perioperative nurses.\n\nIn 2013, D’Arcy’s work was highlighted in a new brain imaging framework specific to the monitoring brain function recovery, and he coined a new neuroscience terminology, “brain vital signs” or the measurement of brain waves, similar to the measurement of a body’s vital signs like blood pressure.\n\nIn 2013, D’Arcy co-founded HealthTech Connex Inc. as President and Chief Scientific Officer, a health-tech company focusing on developing neuro-technologies and bringing them to market. As an innovator and entrepreneur, he and his development team at HealthTech Connex Inc. conceived the NeuroCatch™ platform to convert electroencephalography recordings (EEG) into brain vital signs, through a rapid, portable, non-invasive brain health evaluation.\n\nD'Arcy has been awarded a Public Service Award of Excellence, The National Research Council's Research Breakthrough of the Year, and the Discovery Award for Innovation.\n\nD’Arcy’s team at the NeuroTech Laboratory has been awarded the International Global Best Award in STEM in 2016 (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics).\n\nD'Arcy's HealthTech Connex Inc. team won a 2018 Surrey Business Excellence Award from the Surrey Board of Trade. \n\nD'Arcy’s published works include:\n\n"}

{"id": "520848", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=520848", "title": "Schlock Mercenary", "text": "Schlock Mercenary\n\nSchlock Mercenary is a comedic webcomic written and drawn by Howard Tayler. It follows the tribulations of a star-travelling mercenary company in a satiric, mildly dystopian 31st-century space opera setting. Since its debut on June 12, 2000 the comic has updated daily, begun to support its author, and been nominated for five Hugo Awards.\n\nOver time, Tayler's art improved, in his words, from bad to \"marginally less bad.\" Jean Elmore served as colorist for the strip from February 9, 2003 to the spring of 2004 when she developed a repetitive strain injury from her work.\n\nOn March 3, 2003, the comic reached its 1001st strip. Tayler marked the milestone by \"re-launching\" the comic. With the relaunch, the strip was slightly reoriented for publication, organizing the comic's ongoing story into \"books\". Each book has a fairly self-contained story, although they are still chronological and connected.\n\nOn December 2, 2005, Tayler published the comic's 2000th daily strip since the series' debut. On June 12, 2010, \"Schlock Mercenary\" marked ten years of uninterrupted daily run, a feat matched by few other webcomics.\n\nIn March 2006, Tayler published \"Schlock Mercenary: Under New Management\", the first book-based collection of \"Schlock Mercenary\" comics. This collection features stories printed from March 9, 2003 through August 23, 2003, plus five pages of new material including a foreword by John Ringo, a feature explaining how Sgt. Schlock \"got turned on to plasma cannons\", bonus art, the author's biography, and architectural deck plans to Tagon's third ship \"Serial Peacemaker\".\n\nIn December 2007, Tayler published \"Schlock Mercenary: The Tub of Happiness\". It features stories from the beginning of the webcomic to October 2001, as well as the bonus story \"Baggage Claim,\" explaining the circumstances around Schlock joining the Toughs. There are numerous pieces of fan art throughout the book, as well as early concept art drawn by Tayler and notes to the reader from both Tayler and his wife, talking about the characters and Tayler's early cartooning efforts.\n\nOn Monday, February 17, 2014, Tayler announced in the commentary that the strip had reached 5,000 comics.\n\nThe story primarily centers on Captain Kaff Tagon and his mercenary crew, Tagon's Toughs. Notable members of the crew include Munitions Commander and resident mad scientist Kevyn Andreyasn; title character Sergeant Schlock, who is a carbosilicate amorph with no easily definable limbs, organs, or moral compass; Petey, a former artificial intelligence and now Fleetmind and pseudo-God; and the wry AI and former boyband, Ennesby.\n\nMany plotlines revolve around the jobs Kaff Tagon and his mercenary crew have accepted, preferably involving as much brawn as necessary and as little brain as possible (although resident mad scientist Kevyn Andreyasn can pick up the slack if need be). Other times, the crew is swept up in a galaxy-spanning or truly intergalactic conflict.\n\nIn the distant future of \"Schlock Mercenary\"'s setting, many changes have faced Terran society. Faster-than-light travel has been attained, alien races have been contacted, and technology has undergone radical improvements.\n\nAlien species have varied from fairly humanoid to almost unrecognizable. There have been carbosilicate amorphs with no easily definable limbs or organs (the eponymous Sgt. Schlock), eight-limbed Gatekeepers, two-bodied Uklakk, and the unknowable Pa'anuri, beings made of dark matter.\n\nThe number of sapient species descended from terran stock has increased as Earth's genetic engineers refined their craft. Enhanced chimpanzees, gorillas, orangutans, dolphins, snakes and two species of sentient elephant now have citizenship. Genetic enhancement of the human population has resulted in the purple-skinned photosynthetic \"Purps\", along with more general improvements to the population.\n\nAs in many science fiction stories, technology forms a large part of \"Schlock Mercenary\"'s storytelling framework. Several story arcs revolve around the political conflict surrounding rapid technological change. When a particularly complex or interesting new system is introduced to the comic, its in-comic explanation is often supplemented with a footnote.\n\nTravel between the stars is accomplished through the use of \"wormgates\", large wormhole generators controlled by the enigmatic F'sherl-Ganni Gatekeepers. Within the storyline of the comic, wormgates are largely supplanted by the \"teraport\", a device that allows for near-instant travel between any two points—usually as long as neither point is within range of an interdicting device. In that case, the teraporting object may be destroyed.\n\nThe F'sherl-Ganni also constructed several buuthandi, \"Schlock Mercenary\"'s take on a Dyson sphere. A buuthandi is a balloon of solar-sail material around a star. Light pressure and solar wind offset the star's gravitation to keep the balloon inflated, while habitats and maintenance facilities dangling from the inner side act as ballast to keep the sails in check. Despite their tremendous surface area, a buuthandi provides a disproportionally small amount of livable habitat. \"Control cables, millions of square kilometers of slack sail material, and some very clever engineering allow the 'balloon' to compensate for (and in some cases mitigate) the mood swings of the contained star.\" In the \"Schlock Mercenary\" universe, a buuthandi is about 300 million kilometers in diameter. (\"Buuthandi\" is a shortened form of a F'sherl-Ganni phrase which, when the foul language is removed, can be roughly translated as \"This was expensive to build.\")\n\nMedical technology is based on nanotechnology or artificial replacements for damaged body parts. One important item that is featured in the comic is the \"magic cryo-kit\", an illegally modified device that has the capability to rebuild an entire body as long as the brain is intact. In the strip this has always been shown as \"from the head down\" but presumably nothing more than the brain is actually necessary. It appears that conventional, legal medical technology is also capable of full-body regeneration, though at a much slower pace and dependent on your HMO insurance options. The Toughs employ various technologies to protect survival of heads until their owners can be regenerated. An example of this technology is the comedically ubiquitous \"head-in-a-jar\", which permits a character to interact in a storyline despite an otherwise-fatal injury. Another is the \"nanny-bag\", which maintains the severed head and/or entire body of an otherwise mortally-wounded teammate for an unknown length of time. (Evidence as to the duration of a nanny-bag's preservation varies—the head of Kevyn Andreyasn was sustained for several weeks, whereas in a past storyline his companions worried about his head going \"gamey\" after less than an hour. Though the latter may have simply been Sergeant Schlock's culinary opinion.)\n\nIn addition to medical benefits, nanotechnology gives the ability to \"boost\" soldiers to high levels of physical performance. Minor enhancements are legal, but the more extreme military modifications are highly regulated. The most significant examples of soldier-boosting within the strip are the mercenary grunt Nick and the bounty hunter Doythaban, along with the extreme boost of Kevyn.\n\nComputer hardware has progressed to the point where true, strong artificial intelligence is common, and several artificial intelligences have been characters in the story.\n\nWeapons technology has been drastically improved as well, and a mercenary's arsenal can include railguns, lasers, non-lethal nanomotive \"goober\" rounds, and plasma cannons. Old-fashioned bullet-firing firearms are still in use as they continue to be effective against unprotected targets and are less likely to rupture a hull than a plasma bolt.\n\nEnergy is a resource literally too cheap to meter. Anything that cannot be powered by miniaturized fusion reactors (which, in the 31st century, are so advanced they can operate solely on atmospheric gasses), is easily fueled by massively powerful neutronium-annihilation \"annie\" plants - spherical devices that generate massive amounts of power by gravitationally converting mass to energy, a means of power generation made possible by ubiquitous gravity manipulation. One-shot devices (and bombs) are often powered by fullerened antimatter, a carbon-based powder which contains antiprotons at the parts-per-thousand level, and should \"never\" be incinerated.\n\nGravity manipulation is a process as commonplace as modern electronics, employed not only in starship propulsion and artificial gravity, but also weapons and shielding against weapons. Controlled/artificial gravity is referred to as \"gravy.\" Gravitic weapons in particular are both common and well developed due to their dual purpose—not only are they potent weapons, they can compress matter into neutronium which can then fuel an annie plant. The degree of this control is dependent on the number of projectors. For example, the battleplate \"Tunguska\" was able to manipulate not only individual limbs but individual \"digits\" of crew on board the \"Serial Peacemaker\" while the much smaller ship can only create nodes of gravity in a few points on the ship and without the same level of control. However, the generation of gravity is beyond the capabilities of the sophonts of the Milky Way, necessitating ships to be constructed around annie plants as sources of gravity to manipulate.\n\nThese devices and more are built using fabrication technology, or \"fabbers\". While rare and expensive, possession of one of these portable factories and the appropriate designs allows for the cheap mass-production of any physical item. Several of the mercenaries are trained in fabber design, allowing the company to cheaply produce and repair their own gear.\n\nA mostly annual storyline that occurs during the month of October. The story arc always starts out typically, but soon develops a dark tone, usually involving gruesome events and often character death, before typically resolving itself at the end of the month. It is considered \"Schlock Mercenary\"'s version of Halloween stories. The last year with a Schlocktoberfest storyline was 2008, and Tayler has stated that he is no longer doing it.\n\n\"The Seventy Maxims of Maximally Effective Mercenaries\" is a popular handbook in the \"Schlock Mercenary\" universe.\n\nThis book was originally called \"The Seven Habits of Highly Effective Pirates\", a parody of \"The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People\", but after Tayler received a cease and desist letter from FranklinCovey, he made the retcon on January 24, 2011. Tayler said that the letter \"was worded as nicely as such a thing can be\".\n\nThe book's maxims are often quoted by Tagon, as well as other characters. The following is a list of the maxims found in \"Schlock Mercenary\", ordered by maxim number. The date given after each maxim is the date it first appeared in the strip.\n\nSome of these maxims have been referenced in other works:\n\nThe first \"Schlock Mercenary\" book publication was covered in \"Analog Science Fiction and Fact\", which described it as \"inventive and humorous.\" The comic tied for outstanding science fiction comic in the Web Cartoonist's Choice Awards in 2004, and was again nominated in 2005 and 2007. The strip won for Best Cameo in the 2001 awards.\n\nFive story collections have been nominated for the Hugo Award for Best Graphic Story: \"The Body Politic\" (2009),\n\"The Longshoreman of the Apocalypse\" (2010), \"Massively Parallel\" (2011), \"Force Multiplication\" (2012), and \"Random Access Memorabilia\" (2013).\n\nThe work is frequently cited on lists of top web comics.\n\nCollections of \"Schlock Mercenary\" strips were originally published in book form by \"The Tayler Corporation\", and are now published through Hypernode Press. Tayler's wife, Sandra, is the publisher. The first published collection, \"Under New Management\" does not start at the beginning of the archive, but at the 1001st strip, when the strip was relaunched. The first 1,000 strips were published later in books 1 and 2. Announced book titles are as follows:\n\n\nThe books were renumbered to allow for the release of \"The Tub of Happiness\". Originally, they used Roman numerals, with \"Under New Management\" as the first book.\n\nIn 2012, Living Worlds Games published \"Schlock Mercenary: Capital Offensive\", a board game based upon the webcomic, to positive reviews from reviewers such as The Dice Tower.\n\nJohn Ringo's Troy Rising series has been inspired by the \"Schlock Mercenary\" universe. It is set in the early days of human-alien contact; it is however not considered canon for the comic series.\n\nThere was a crossover with \"Schlock Mercenary\" in the webcomic \"Under the Lemon Tree\", although it was noncanon in the \"Schlock Mercenary\" continuity.\n\nA role-playing game written by Alan Bahr and Howard Tayler based on the comic was launched as a Kickstarter on April 14, 2015. It successfully funded the following day.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "6152185", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6152185", "title": "Softmax function", "text": "Softmax function\n\nIn mathematics, the softmax function, softargmax, or normalized exponential function, is a generalization of the logistic function that \"squashes\" a -dimensional vector formula_1 of arbitrary real values to a -dimensional vector formula_2 of real values, for , where each entry is in the interval , and all the entries add up to 1.\n\nThe standard (unit) softmax function is given by the standard exponential function on each coordinate, divided by the sum of all the coordinates, as a normalizing constant, so the output coordinates sum to 1:\n\nInstead of , a different base can be used, for any positive . This is written using formula_5 or formula_6 (for any real ), yielding the expression:\n\nIn some fields, the base is fixed, corresponding to a fixed scale, while in others the parameter is varied.\n\nThe name \"softmax\" is misleading; the function is not a smooth maximum (a smooth approximation to the maximum function), but is rather a smooth approximation to the arg max function: the function whose value is \"which\" index has the maximum. In fact, the term \"softmax\" is also used for the closely related LogSumExp function, which is a smooth maximum. For this reason, some prefer the more accurate term \"softargmax\", but the term \"softmax\" is conventional in machine learning. For this section, the term \"softargmax\" is used to emphasize this interpretation.\n\nFormally, instead of considering the arg max as a function with categorical output formula_9 (corresponding to the index), consider the arg max function with one-hot representation of the output (assuming there is a unique max arg):\nwhere the output coordinate formula_11 if and only if formula_12 is the arg max of formula_13, meaning formula_14 is the unique maximum value of formula_13. For example, in this encoding formula_16 since the third argument is the maximum.\n\nThis can be generalized to multiple arg max values (multiple equal formula_14 being the maximum) by dividing the 1 between all max args; formally where is the number of arguments assuming the maximum. For example, formula_18 since the second and third argument are both the maximum. In case all arguments are equal, this is simply formula_19 Points with multiple arg max values are singular points (or singularities, and form the singular set) – these are the points where arg max is discontinuous (with a jump discontinuity) – while points with a single arg max are known as non-singular or regular points.\n\nWith this representation, softargmax is now a smooth approximation of arg max: as , softargmax converges to arg max. There are various notions of convergence of a function; softargmax converges to arg max pointwise, meaning for each fixed input as , formula_20 However, softargmax does not converge uniformly to arg max, meaning intuitively that different points converge at different rates, and may converge arbitrarily slowly. In fact, softargmax is continuous, but arg max is not continuous at the singular set where two coordinates are equal, while the uniform limit of continuous functions is continuous. The failure to converge uniformly is because for inputs where two coordinates are almost equal (and one is the maximum), the arg max is the index of one or the other, so a small change in input yields a large change in output. For example,\nformula_21 but formula_22 and formula_23 for all inputs: the closer the points are to the singular set formula_24, the slower they converge. However, softargmax does converge compactly on the non-singular set.\n\nConversely, as , softargmax converges to arg min in the same way, where here the singular set is points with two arg \"min\" values. In the language of tropical analysis, the softmax is a deformation or \"quantization\" of arg max and arg min, corresponding to using the log semiring instead of the max-plus semiring (respectively min-plus semiring), and recovering the arg max or arg min by taking the limit is called \"tropicalization\" or \"dequantization\".\n\nIt is also the case that, for any fixed , if one input is much larger that the others \"relative\" to the temperature, , the output is approximately the arg max. For example, a difference of 10 is large relative to a temperature of 1:\nHowever, if the difference is small relative to the temperature, the value is not close to the arg max. For example, a difference of 10 is small relative to a temperature of 100:\nAs , temperature goes to zero, formula_27, so eventually all differences become large (relative to a shrinking temperature), which gives another interpretation for the limit behavior.\n\nIn probability theory, the output of the softmax function can be used to represent a categorical distribution – that is, a probability distribution over different possible outcomes.\n\nIn statistical mechanics, the softmax function is known as the Boltzmann distribution (or Gibbs distribution): the index set formula_28 are the microstates of the system; the inputs formula_14 are the energies of that state; the denominator is known as the partition function, often denoted by ; and the factor is called the coldness (or thermodynamic beta, or inverse temperature).\n\nThe softmax function is used in various multiclass classification methods, such as multinomial logistic regression (also known as softmax regression) , multiclass linear discriminant analysis, naive Bayes classifiers, and artificial neural networks. Specifically, in multinomial logistic regression and linear discriminant analysis, the input to the function is the result of distinct linear functions, and the predicted probability for the 'th class given a sample vector and a weighting vector is:\n\nThis can be seen as the composition of linear functions formula_31 and the softmax function (where formula_32 denotes the inner product of formula_33 and formula_34). The operation is equivalent to applying a linear operator defined by formula_34 to vectors formula_33, thus transforming the original, probably highly-dimensional, input to vectors in a -dimensional space formula_37.\n\nThe softmax function is often used in the final layer of a neural network-based classifier. Such networks are commonly trained under a log loss (or cross-entropy) regime, giving a non-linear variant of multinomial logistic regression.\n\nSince the function maps a vector and a specific index \"i\" to a real value, the derivative needs to take the index into account:\n\nHere, the Kronecker delta is used for simplicity (cf. the derivative of a sigmoid function, being expressed via the function itself).\n\nSee Multinomial logit for a probability model which uses the softmax activation function.\n\nIn the field of reinforcement learning, a softmax function can be used to convert values into action probabilities. The function commonly used is:\n\nwhere the action value formula_40 corresponds to the expected reward of following action a and formula_41 is called a temperature parameter (in allusion to statistical mechanics). For high temperatures (formula_42), all actions have nearly the same probability and the lower the temperature, the more expected rewards affect the probability. For a low temperature (formula_43), the probability of the action with the highest expected reward tends to 1.\n\nSigmoidal or Softmax normalization is a way of reducing the influence of extreme values or outliers in the data without removing them from the dataset. It is useful given outlier data, which we wish to include in the dataset while still preserving the significance of data within a standard deviation of the mean. The data are nonlinearly transformed using one of the sigmoidal functions.\n\nThe logistic sigmoid function:\n\nThe hyperbolic tangent function, tanh:\n\nThe sigmoid function limits the range of the normalized data to values between 0 and 1. The sigmoid function is almost linear near the mean and has smooth nonlinearity at both extremes, ensuring that all data points are within a limited range. This maintains the resolution of most values within a standard deviation of the mean.\n\nThe hyperbolic tangent function, tanh, limits the range of the normalized data to values between −1 and 1. The hyperbolic tangent function is almost linear near the mean, but has a slope of half that of the sigmoid function. Like sigmoid, it has smooth, monotonic nonlinearity at both extremes. Also, like the sigmoid function, it remains differentiable everywhere and the sign of the derivative (slope) is unaffected by the normalization. This ensures that optimization and numerical integration algorithms can continue to rely on the derivative to estimate changes to the output (normalized value) that will be produced by changes to the input in the region near any linearisation point.\n\nGeometrically the softmax function maps the vector space formula_37 to the interior of the standard formula_47-simplex, cutting the dimension by one (the range is a formula_47-dimensional simplex in formula_49-dimensional space), due to the linear constraint that all output sum to 1 meaning it lies on a hyperplane.\n\nAlong the main diagonal formula_50 softmax is just the uniform distribution on outputs, formula_51: equal scores yield equal probabilities.\n\nMore generally, softmax is invariant under translation by the same value in each coordinate: adding formula_52 to the inputs formula_1 yields formula_54, because it multiplies each exponent by the same factor, formula_55 (because formula_56), so the ratios do not change:\n\nGeometrically, softmax is constant along diagonals: this is the dimension that is eliminated, and corresponds to the softmax output being independent of a translation in the input scores (a choice of 0 score). One can normalize input scores by assuming that the sum is zero (subtract the average: formula_58 where formula_59), and then the softmax takes the hyperplane of points that sum to zero, formula_60, to the open simplex of positive values that sum to 1formula_61, analogously to how the exponent takes 0 to 1, formula_62 and is positive.\n\nBy contrast, softmax is not invariant under scaling. For instance, formula_63 but formula_64\n\nThe standard logistic function is the special case for a 1-dimensional axis in 2-dimensional space, say the \"x\"-axis in the plane. One variable is fixed at 0 (say formula_65), so formula_62, and the other variable can vary, denote it formula_67, so formula_68 the standard logistic function, and formula_69 its complement (meaning they add up to 1). The 1-dimensional input could alternatively be expressed as the line formula_70, with outputs formula_71 and formula_72\n\nThe softmax function is also the gradient of the LogSumExp function, a smooth maximum; defining:\nthe partial derivatives are:\nExpressing the partial derivatives as a vector with the gradient yields the softmax.\n\nThe softmax function was used in statistical mechanics as the Boltzmann distribution in the foundational paper , formalized and popularized in the influential textbook .\n\nThe use of the softmax in decision theory is credited to , who used the axiom of independence of irrelevant alternatives in rational choice theory to deduce the softmax in Luce's choice axiom for relative preferences.\n\nIn machine learning, the term \"softmax\" is credited to John S. Bridle in two 1989 conference papers, : and :\n\nIf we take an input of [1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3], the softmax of that is [0.024, 0.064, 0.175, 0.475, 0.024, 0.064, 0.175]. The output has most of its weight where the '4' was in the original input. This is what the function is normally used for: to highlight the largest values and suppress values which are significantly below the maximum value. But note: softmax is not scale invariant, so if the input were [0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3] (which sums to 1.6) the softmax would be [0.125, 0.138, 0.153, 0.169, 0.125, 0.138, 0.153]. This shows that for values between 0 and 1 softmax, in fact, de-emphasizes the maximum value (note that 0.169 is not only less than 0.475, it is also less than the initial proportion of 0.4/1.6=0.25).\n\nComputation of this example using simple Python code:\n\n»> import math\n»> z = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0]\n»> z_exp = [math.exp(i) for i in z]\n»> print([round(i, 2) for i in z_exp])\n[2.72, 7.39, 20.09, 54.6, 2.72, 7.39, 20.09]\n»> sum_z_exp = sum(z_exp)\n»> print(round(sum_z_exp, 2))\n114.98\n»> softmax = [i / sum_z_exp for i in z_exp]\n»> print([round(i, 3) for i in softmax])\n[0.024, 0.064, 0.175, 0.475, 0.024, 0.064, 0.175]\nAnother example with python using Numpy:\n\n»> import numpy as np\n»> z = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0]\n»> softmax = lambda z:np.exp(z)/np.sum(np.exp(z))\n»> softmax(z)\narray([0.02364054, 0.06426166, 0.1746813 , 0.474833 , 0.02364054,\n\nHere is an example of Julia code:\n\njulia> A = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0]\n7-element Array{Float64,1}:\n\njulia> exp.(A) ./ sum(exp.(A))\n7-element Array{Float64,1}:\nHere is an example of R code:\n\n> z <- c(1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0)\n> softmax <- exp(z)/sum(exp(z))\n> softmax\n[1] 0.02364054 0.06426166 0.17468130 0.47483300 0.02364054 0.06426166 0.17468130\n\n"}

{"id": "593854", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=593854", "title": "Susan Peters", "text": "Susan Peters\n\nSusan Peters (born Suzanne Carnahan; July 3, 1921October 23, 1952) was an American film, stage, and television actress who appeared in over twenty films over the course of her decade-long career. Though she began her career in uncredited and ingénue roles, she would establish herself as a serious dramatic actress in the mid-1940s.\n\nBorn in Spokane, Washington, Peters was raised by her mother in Portland, Oregon and later, Los Angeles. Upon graduating from high school, she studied acting with Austrian theater director Max Reinhardt, and signed a contract with Warner Bros. Pictures. She appeared in numerous bit parts before earning a minor supporting role in \"Santa Fe Trail\" (1940). She made her last film for Warner Bros. in 1942, the film noir \"The Big Shot\" opposite Humphrey Bogart and Richard Travis; after its release, Warner opted not to renew her contract.\n\nIn 1942, Peters appeared in a supporting role in \"Tish\", which resulted in her signing a contract with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM). The same year, she had a featured role in the Mervyn LeRoy-directed drama \"Random Harvest\", which earned her an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actress and established her as a serious dramatic performer. Peters went on to appear as the lead in numerous films for MGM, including roles in the romantic comedy \"Young Ideas\" (1943), and several war films: \"Assignment in Brittany\" (1943), \"Song of Russia\" (1944), and \"Keep Your Powder Dry\" (1945).\n\nOn New Year's Day 1945, Peters's spinal cord was damaged from an accidental gunshot wound, leaving her permanently paraplegic. She returned to film portraying a wheelchair-bound villain in \"The Sign of the Ram\" (1948). Peters then transitioned to theater, appearing as Laura Wingfield in a critically acclaimed 1949 production of Tennessee Williams's \"The Glass Menagerie\", which was slightly altered to allow Peters to perform in a wheelchair. She followed this with a production of \"The Barretts of Wimpole Street\", in which she portrayed crippled poet Elizabeth Barrett Browning. By 1952, however, Peters had been suffering from clinical depression for several years due to the dissolution of her marriage and her limited career options. In late 1952 she began starving herself, which combined with her paralysis led to chronic kidney infections and pneumonia. She died of ensuing health complications that year at age 31.\n\nPeters was born Suzanne Carnahan on July 3, 1921 in Spokane, Washington, the elder of two children born to Robert and Abby Carnahan. Her father was a civil engineer of Irish descent, while her mother was of French descent, and a grand-niece of Robert E. Lee. Peters had one younger brother, Robert Jr., born in 1923. Shortly after her birth, the Carnahan family moved to Portland, Oregon. In 1928, her father was killed in a car accident in Portland, after which the family relocated to Seattle, Washington, and later to Los Angeles to live with Peters' maternal French-born grandmother, Maria Patteneaude, a well-known dermatologist.\n\nPeters was educated at Laird Hall School for Girls, the LaRue School in Azusa, California, and Flintridge Sacred Heart Academy in Los Angeles. During her years in high school, she worked after hours in a Los Angeles department store, earning money to help support her mother and brother. Peters's mother supported herself and her two children by working in a dress shop and managing an apartment building. \"We were poor but we managed, and we had fun,\" Peters recalled of her upbringing. She was an avid swimmer and tennis player, and also grew up riding horses; her talent as an equestrian allowed her to earn additional income by breaking and showing other people's horses.\n\nPeters transferred to Hollywood High School during her senior year, and began taking drama classes in which she opted to enroll in place of cooking courses: \"I took a drama course instead of a cooking course because I thought it was easier,\" Peters said. \"Acting meant money, and [my family] needed money.\" While still in high school, she signed with a talent agent. She graduated from Hollywood High School in June 1939, along with Jason Robards, Sheila Ryan, and Dorothy Morris as members of her graduating class. With a newfound interest in acting, Peters earned a scholarship to the Max Reinhardt School of Dramatic Arts. \n\nWhile performing in a showcase production of Philip Barry's \"Holiday\" at the Reinhardt School, Peters was spotted by a talent scout for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM), who gave her a walk-on part in George Cukor's \"Susan and God\" (1940). During the shoot, Peters was reportedly so nervous that she fainted in front of the camera. Despite her apprehension on set, Peters became a protégée of Cukor, who personally assigned her to private acting lessons with drama coach Gertrude Vogler. Cukor believed Peters had star potential, but needed to not \"talk through [her] nose.\" He later recalled that she reminded him of \"a young Katharine Hepburn. Not as aggressive as Kate, but that same finishing school appearance and drive.\" \n\nIn early 1940, Peters screen tested for Warner Bros. Pictures, who subsequently offered her a contract. Then credited under her birth name, Suzanne Carnahan, Peters was cast in various small parts in Warner Bros. films; many these were uncredited bit parts or walk-on roles, such as in \"River's End\", \"The Man Who Talked Too Much\", \"Money and the Woman\", and \"Always a Bride\" (all released in 1940). She had her first credited role in the big-budget Western film \"Santa Fe Trail\" (1940), opposite Errol Flynn, Olivia de Havilland, and Rita Hayworth. In the film, Peters portrayed a young woman from Boston in love with a Kansas military officer. During the press junkets to promote the film, Peters found interviews overwhelming, and later admitted: \"I wasn't a good sport. I locked herself in my compartment during most of the trip.\"\n\nAfter \"Santa Fe Trail\", Peters had small roles in \"The Strawberry Blonde\", \"Meet John Doe\", \"Here Comes Happiness\" (1941), and \"Scattergood Pulls the Strings\" (all 1941), the latter of which earned her favorable reviews. She then had a lead role as an ingénue in the comedy \"Three Sons o' Guns\" (1941), followed by a dramatic part playing the girlfriend of a convict in \"The Big Shot\" (1942), opposite Richard Travis and Humphrey Bogart. She was also in shorts such as \"Young America Flies\" (1940) and \"Sockaroo\" (1941). At the urging of the studio (who initially suggested she change her name to Sharon O'Keefe), she dropped her birth name and took the stage name Susan Peters. By 1942, however, Warner Bros. chose not to renew her contract.\n\nSeveral months after being dropped by Warner Bros., Peters was contacted by MGM to test for a supporting role in the film \"Tish\" (1942), a loose adaptation of a series of stories by Mary Roberts Rinehart. She won the role and also signed a contract with the studio. At the time, Peters was one of the most screen-tested actresses in Hollywood. While filming \"Tish\", Peters met future husband, actor Richard Quine, with whom she also starred in her second film with MGM, \"Dr. Gillespie's New Assistant\" (1942), alongside Van Johnson. She and Peters later married on November 7, 1943 at Westwood Community Church in West Los Angeles. \nAfter completing filming of the comedy \"Andy Hardy's Double Life\" (1942) in which she had a lead role, Mervyn LeRoy cast Peters in the drama \"Random Harvest\", in which she portrayed a young woman who falls in love with her step-uncle. The film was one of the top 25 highest-earning films of the year, and Peters's performance garnered her critical acclaim, earning her an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actress.\n\nThe success of \"Random Harvest\" led MGM to give Peters lead roles in other major pictures such as \"Assignment in Brittany\" (1943), in which she portrayed a French peasant girl. This was followed with a minor but top-billed credit in the comedy \"Young Ideas\" (1943) with Herbert Marshall and Mary Astor, directed by Jules Dassin. She was subsequently cast as the female lead in \"Song of Russia\" (1943) opposite Robert Taylor. The role earned her further critical acclaim, with a review in \"The Hollywood Reporter\" noting her as \"a dramatic actress of the first rank.\" The film however was controversial, as its portrayal of the Soviet Union was interpreted by some audiences and critics as being favorable and of a pro-Communist stance. \n\nIn early 1944, Peters was one of ten actors who were elevated from \"featured player\" status to the studio's official \"star\" category; the others included Esther Williams, Laraine Day, Kathryn Grayson, Van Johnson, Margaret O'Brien, Ginny Simms, Robert Walker, Gene Kelly, and George Murphy. An official portrait taken of MGM's contracted players during this period prominently features Peters sharing the front row with the head of the studio himself, Louis B. Mayer, and alongside such actors as James Stewart, Mickey Rooney, Margaret Sullavan, Katharine Hepburn, Hedy Lamarr, and Greer Garson. In late 1944, Peters filmed \"Keep Your Powder Dry\", a war drama co-starring Lana Turner and Laraine Day, in which she portrayed the humble wife of a soldier.\n\nOn January 1, 1945, Peters and husband Quine, along with his cousin and cousin's wife, went on a duck hunting trip in the Cuyamaca Mountains near San Diego. At one point during the trip, Peters attempted to reach for a rifle, which accidentally discharged through her abdomen. She was rushed to Mercy Hospital, roughly away, and underwent emergency surgery. The bullet damaged Peters's spinal cord, leaving her permanently paralyzed from the waist down, and she was required to use a wheelchair for the rest of her life. \"Keep Your Powder Dry\" premiered three months after the incident, on March 8, 1945. Peters's mother, who had maintained a bedside vigil during her stay in the hospital, died nine months later in December 1945, which left Peters even more distraught. \n\nMGM continued to pay Peters a $100 weekly salary and medical expenses, but, unable to find suitable projects, she subsequently left the studio. She later recalled: \"Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer kept sending me Pollyanna scripts about crippled girls who were all sweetness and light, which I kept turning down. Two years after my accident, I gave up and broke my contract. I won't trade on my handicap.\" Among the projects offered to her were Joe Pasternak and Henry Koster's \"The Unfinished Dance\" (1947), a remake of Jean Benoît-Lévy's \"Ballerina\". In the film, Peters was offered the role of a ballerina who receives a spinal injury that leaves her unable to perform, but shed declined. Just prior to her injury, she had begun filming the drama \"The Outward Room\". The film's producers considered completing the project with stand-ins and refitting the script to allow Peters to appear in a wheelchair, but the project was ultimately shelved.\nUpon leaving MGM, Peters was approached for numerous acting jobs on radio programs. She guest starred on a December 11, 1945 episode of \"Seventh Heaven\", opposite past film co-star Van Johnson. In 1946, Peters and husband Quine adopted a son, Timothy Richard. The same year, Peters made her first public appearance since her accident at Ciro's in West Hollywood, attending the debut of Desi Arnaz and His Orchestra along with her close friend Lucille Ball. Ball and Arnaz urged Peters to continue seeking acting work. Actor and friend Charles Bickford suggested that Peters option the novel \"The Sign of the Ram\" by Margaret Ferguson, which centers on a crippled woman who manipulates those around her. Upon discussing the novel with her agent, Peters pitched the idea to Columbia Pictures, who were enthusiastic about making a film adaptation. \n\nProduction on \"The Sign of the Ram\" began in July 1947 with director John Sturges, and Peters told reporters that she had never played a character \"with the emotional range that this character has. It was a real challenge for me.\" The film's production was difficult, as Peters had to have either her mother or Quine on set to care for her son. After production ended, Peters separated from Quine, claiming that he was cruel and would not speak to her for days at a time. Their divorce was finalized on September 10, 1948. \"The Sign of the Ram\" was released in March 1948, and critic Bosley Crowther of \"The New York Times\" gave the film an unfavorable review, writing: \"The fortitude of Susan Peters in returning to the screen after a cruelly crippling accident, suffered three years ago, is worthy of a more substantial token of respect than it—and she—receives in \"The Sign of the Ram\", a Columbia picture which came to Loew's State yesterday. And the talents of several other actors of competence who are with her in this film are deserving of fuller protection against embarrassment than any of them get.\" In light of her divorce and facing a lack of opportunity as an actress, Peters began suffering from chronic depression at this time.\n\nIn 1949, she was cast as Laura in a touring stage production of \"The Glass Menagerie\" (reportedly with blessings from Tennessee Williams) which had its debut June 27, 1949, in Norwich, Connecticut. The play was slightly altered under Williams's supervision in order for Peters to be allowed to perform the part in a wheelchair. She received a standing ovation during the play's opening night, and the production toured throughout the East Coast. The following year, in 1950, she was cast in a stage production of Rudolph Besier's \"The Barretts of Wimpole Street\", playing the crippled poet Elizabeth Barrett Browning, which earned her positive critical reception among press. \n\nIn March 1951, Peters signed onto the live NBC-TV television drama \"Miss Susan\", in which she played an attorney confined to her wheelchair. Peters shot the series five days per week in Philadelphia from March 12 to December 28, 1951, after which it was canceled when her health began to decline.\n\nAfter the cancelation of \"Miss Susan\", she began a relationship with Robert Clark, a U.S. Colonel, and the two announced their engagement to be married; however, Clark broke off the engagement, which sent Peters into a deeper depression. She relocated to Lemon Grove, California, to live on her brother's cattle ranch, and her health began to steadily decline. In mid-1952, she was admitted to a hospital in Exeter, California to undergo a skin graft procedure, after which she returned to her brother's home and lived in seclusion. She had plans to resume another touring stage production of \"The Barretts of Wimpole Street\" the following year, but her strength had dwindled and she struggled to put on weight.\n\nIn August 1952, Peters told her physician, Dr. Manchester: \"I'm getting awfully tired. I think it possibly would be better if I did die.\" Over the following two months, she began starving herself. Peters died on October 23, 1952 at Memorial Hospital in Visalia, California at the age of 31. Her doctor attributed her death to a chronic kidney infection, a complication caused by her paralysis, and bronchial pneumonia. He also noted that her death was hastened by self-induced dehydration and starvation because, in the last few weeks of her life, Peters had \"lost interest\" in eating and drinking and had lost the will to live.\n\nHer funeral was held on October 27 in Glendale, California, after which she was buried at Forest Lawn Memorial Park next to her mother. At the time of her death Peters' son Timothy was living with her ex-husband. Her estate was worth $6,000 ().\n\nMuch of the public assessment and discussion of Peters has hinged on her paralysis and its impact on her life and career: Media historian Hal Erickson considered Peters \"one of Hollywood's most promising young actresses\" of the 1940s, who \"courageously attempted a comeback\" despite her health problems. Film scholar Gene Blottner similarly praised Peters as a \"brilliant actress,\" as did John Charles of Turner Classic Movies, who deemed her paralysis \"one of the worst tragedies to affect the Hollywood acting community during the 1940s.\" For her contribution to motion pictures, Peters was posthumously awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 1601 Vine Street.\n\n\n\n"}

A knight from Autremencourt in Picardy, he was given Salona as a fief by Boniface of Montferrat, King of Thessalonica, in 1205 during the division of the Byzantine Empire after the Fourth Crusade. Thomas extended his domain over most of Phocis, from the Gulf of Corinth to the passes of Gravia in the north and the Parnassus in the east. Ca. 1210, he tried to extend his rule westwards, and attacked the port town of Galaxidi. Its inhabitants, however, called upon the ruler of Epirus, Michael I Komnenos Doukas, for aid. The Epirote army attacked and captured Salona, with Thomas himself falling in battle (ca. 1212). As the Epirote ruler was pre-occupied elsewhere, however, his occupation did not last long, and within a few years Thomas's son, Thomas II, was able to reclaim Salona.\n\n"}

Many opponents were confused by this style, and some boxing experts contend that Crawley might have been the best \"switch hitter\" of his time along with middleweight champion Marvelous Marvin Hagler.\n\nAs an amateur, Tyrone compiled a record of 56-6 (22 RSCs), and was a Golden Gloves champion and All Army champion in the late 1970s. Tyrone turned pro in October 1980 and won the ESPN lightweight title in only his ninth pro fight with a twelve-round decision over knockout puncher Al \"Earthquake\" Carter in September 1982. In his next fight, Crawley scored an impressive ten-round decision over future jr. welterweight champion Gene Hatcher on national television in October 1982. He defended his ESPN lightweight in December 1982 with a tenth round stoppage of Anthony Murray, but lost his ESPN title in a close 12-round decision to Melvin Paul in his next fight in February 1983. It is noteworthy that Crawley entered the Paul fight with a broken knuckle and broken finger.\n\nCrawley rebounded in 1983 and scored a huge upset win over #1 lightweight contender Robin Blake in Blake's hometown of Levelland, Texas. Blake had knocked out Melvin Paul in his previous fight, and many expected him to dispose of Crawley easily. Blake was zeroing in on a title shot with Ray \"Boom Boom\" Mancini, but Blake had trouble solving Crawley's style, and was soundly beaten in a lopsided ten-round decision.\n\nIn 1984, Livingstone Bramble dethroned Ray Mancini to take the WBA lightweight title. Crawley was the #1 contender, and accepted $150,000 to step aside and allow Bramble and Mancini to engage in a rematch. Bramble defeated Mancini in their rematch on February 16, 1985.\n\nCrawley won the USBA lightweight title in June 1985 with a twelve-round decision over crosstown rival and future IBF lightweight champion Charlie \"Choo Choo\" Brown. Crawley was supposed to challenge Bramble for the WBA lightweight crown on a few occasions in 1985, but the bout was postponed due to injuries to both fighters. Bramble and Crawley finally met for Bramble's title in February 1986 in Reno, Nevada. Crawley suffered the first knockdown of his career in the second round of that bout, but rallied over the next several rounds to draw even on the scorecards after eight rounds. Crawley eventually tired late in the fight, and was knocked out in the 13th round.\n\nAfter the Bramble bout, Crawley joined the Philadelphia Police Department during the summer of 1986. He resumed his boxing career in June 1987 while maintaining his duties with the Philadelphia P.D. He scored three more wins, and retired from professional boxing in early 1988 with a record of 22-2 (7 KOs). In that same year, Tyrone was named Director of the North Philadelphia Police Athletic League, a position he still holds to this day.\n\nCrawley attended Temple University. He was inducted into the New Jersey Boxing Hall of Fame in 2003. He was also recently inducted as a member of the 2010 class of the Pennsylvania Boxing Hall of Fame.\n\nTyrone has 3 children, Ageenah his eldest child, Tyrone Crawley Jr a current professional boxer, and Kevin Crawley an entertainment screenwriter.\n\n"}
