Her debut album, \"Ace of Hearts\" was nominated 'Best Urban Release' in the ARIA Music Awards of 2008.\n\nA-Love was born Antonella Formosa in Rome, Italy on 21 March 1983. Formosa's father, Ric Formosa, a composer/arranger and an original member (lead guitarist) with the Australian band Little River Band and her mother, Vicki Formosa, was an R&B singer.\nShe attended Hawthorn Secondary College, graduating in 1999. Whilst her first experiences of playing music were with an all-girl band, which never made any public performances, she also discovered hip hop in high school and soon found herself waxing lyrical over beats.\n\nIn January 2000, Formosa met Draino from the Puah Hedz. He was keen to check out her writing and despite her reluctance, he made her feature on a track. The second track that she had ever recorded was with Muphin, which later became \"Some People\" which featured on the album \"Despite the Odds\". She has since appeared numerous times on Triple J's 'The Hip Hop Show', PBS' 'The Formula' (now 'Hittin Switches') and 'Auscultation', RRR's 'Wordburner' and RMIT University's SRA FM. She was progressing towards a Bachelor of Arts degree in Anthropology from La Trobe University and for two years she was the co-host of a hip hop radio show at La Trobe University.\n\nMay 2002 marked A-Love's official solo introduction to the Australian hip hop and media circles, with her song \"Petty\" from the album, \"Culture of Kings Volume 2\" (the first ever Australian hip hop feature album on Triple J). \"Petty\" was put on medium rotation on Triple J.\n\nFormosa was a winner of the Nescafe Big Break competition in 2002, earning $20,000 with which to start up an independent record label and distribution company, Duality Records. As time progressed, she juggled the twin responsibilities of building a label and working on her own debut as an artist.\n\nFormosa released her debut album, \"Ace of Hearts\" on 24 November 2007, on Crookneck Records. The album was produced by BVA (Mnemonic Ascent) with additional beats from Suffa (Hilltop Hoods) and Jase. Guests include Yungun (UK), Raph (Mnemonic Ascent), Spikey Tee (UK) and emerging indigenous MC Jim Blah. It was Triple J's 'Album of the Week' just three days after its release and was nominated for the 2008 ARIA Awards in the category of 'Best Urban Release'.\n\nShe was also nominated for two at the Jägermeister AIR (Australian Independent Record Labels Association) Awards in 2008, in the categories of 'Best New Independent Artist' and 'Best Independent Hip Hop Artist'.\n\nFormosa has performed with Mystik Journeymen (US), Anticon, Hilltop Hoods, Pegz, MC Layla, Kowhai, Bliss n Eso, Scarz on 45, MC Que, TZU, Bias B and DJ Brand (Canada).\n\n\n\n"}

Fulton, who held a land grant from the government of Spain, purchased merchandise and built the first store in Rapides Parish and located it beside the Red River. On May 4, 1805, he was appointed coroner of Rapides Parish by then territorial Governor William C.C. Claiborne. He became the area postmaster during the Jefferson administration in 1807. In 1805, he laid out the townsite of Alexandria in collaboration with his business partner, Thomas Harris Maddox.\n\nIn 1793, Fulton married the 15-year-old Mary Henrietta Wells, daughter of Samuel Levi Wells, I, and the former Dorcas Huie. Alexander and Mary Fulton had six children: Samuel, Eliza, William, Benjamin, Marcus, and Courtney Ann Fulton. Mary Wells Fulton was the aunt of later Louisiana Governor James Madison Wells, who was born near Alexandria in 1808. Governor Wells was a son of Samuel Levi Wells, II.\n\nFulton died in 1818 and is believed to have been interred at Rapides Cemetery in Pineville, the smaller city on the eastern side of the Red River. There is no grave marker, so the exact burial site is not known. His year of death is known because of existing records which show that his estate went through probate in January, 1819.\n\nFulton is honored by the naming of Fulton Street and the Fulton Street Bridge, which links Louisiana Highway 28 across the Red River between Alexandria and Pineville. The founder is further recognized by the naming of the 7-story, 163,000 square foot complex, the Alexander Fulton Hotel and Convention Center, located at 701 Fourth Street in the riverfront district. The complex, newly remodeled by Sharpco Construction LLC and reopened in July 2016 as a full service hotel run by Sharpco Hotels LLC Holiday Inn, is near the historic Bentley Hotel, founded in 1907 by a timber magnate, Joseph Bentley.\n"}

He had a reputation for being anti-Arab. He is mostly known to have led the Sasanians to victory against the Arabs at the Battle of the Bridge. The Arab Muslims referred to Bahman as \"Dhul Hājib\", (, \"owner of bushy eyebrows\"). He is often confused with Mardanshah, another Sasanian general.\n\nNothing is known of his early life, but Bahman Jadhuyih is recorded as an old man by 634. Bahman may have been the son of the Sasanian commander Hormozd Jadhuyih. Bahman is first mentioned in 633, as one of the spokesmen for the Sasanians and a member of the Parsig faction led by Piruz Khosrow. In 633, the Sasanian monarch ordered a Sasanian commander named Andarzaghar who was in charge of protecting the borders of Khorasan to protect the western frontiers from the Arabs who were plundering Persia.\n\nIn 633, Andarzaghar, along with Bahman Jadhuyih, made a counter-attack against the army of Khalid ibn al-Walid at Walaja, but were defeated. After the defeat, Bahman fled to Ctesiphon, where he found Yazdegerd sick. However, Bahman was shortly ordered by the latter to make a counter-attack against the Arabs. Bahman, however, disobeyed the child king and sent Jaban to fight the Arabs instead. Jaban, who was sent alone on the western front to confront the Arabs, was defeated at the battle of Ullais.\n\nWhen the Arabs under Abu Ubaid were making an expedition in the Sawad in 634, Rostam Farrokhzād sent Bahman Jadhuyih and Jalinus against him with a force from the powerful Wuzurgan class, who had units such as war elephants and the Zhayedan. Rostam is known to have told Bahman that: \"if Jalinus returns to the like of his defeat, then cut off his head.\"\n\nDuring the battle, known as the Battle of the Bridge, the army of Bahman had an advantage: the elephants in his army frightened the Arabs' horses, and which later resulted in the death of Abu Ubaid. The bridge was then broken by an Arab, and around 4,000 Arabs died by drowning and many others were killed by the Bahman's forces. Al-Muthanna managed to flee from the bridge and rally 3,000 Arab survivors; however, some of them fled back to Medina. Bahman did not pursue the fleeing Arab army. In 636 during the Battle of al-Qadisiyyah Bahman was killed by Qa’qa ibn Amr in revenge for the death of Abu Ubaid and the others killed at the Battle of the Bridge.\n\n"}
{"id": "2061370", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2061370", "title": "Batepá massacre", "text": "Batepá massacre\n\nThe Batepá massacre occurred on 3 February 1953 in São Tomé when hundreds of native creoles known as \"forros\" were massacred by the colonial administration and Portuguese landowners. Many \"forros\" believed the government intended to force them to work as contract laborers, to which they objected. In response, the governor blamed the unrest on communists and ordered the military to round up such individuals and for civilians to protect themselves. This quickly turned into a bloodbath, resulting in the deaths of hundreds of \"forros\". No communist conspiracy was ever proven.\n\nCarlos Gorgulho assumed office as governor in 1945. At the time São Tomé Island was one of the world's largest producers of cocoa. Large plantations, called \"roças\", occupied the majority of the island's farmland. The \"roças\" operated as a quasi-feudal system using contract laborers (\"serviçais\") from mainland Africa and Cape Verde. The \"forros\" had always refused manual field work on the estates, since they considered it slave labor. In Gorgulho's assessment the economic modernization policies of the Portuguese \"Estado Novo\" regime required breaking São Tomé's dependence on contract laborers from overseas. To accomplish this Gorgulho implemented policies to make it easier for \"serviçais\" to return home while at the same time improving conditions on the \"roças\", which he hoped would attract local labor. He also introduced measures targeting the livelihood of the \"forros\" such as prohibiting the sale of palm wine and the locally produced gin and raising the poll tax from 30 to 90 escudos; Gorgulho believed these measures would result in the \"forros\" taking up wage labor on the roças.\n\nGorgulho also faced a shortage of labor to carry out his public works and construction projects. The colonial administration used police raids to kidnap people for forced labor gangs to carry out much of this work.\n\nFaced with widespread labor shortages, in 1952 the colonial administration proposed settling fifteen thousand people from Cape Verde on São Tomé; then in January 1953 rumors spread that the government would seize the land of the \"forros\" to give to newly arrived Cape Verdians and compel the \"forros\" to work as contract labor. On February 2, 1953, hand-written pamphlets appeared in São Tomé threatening to kill anyone who contracted \"forros\" as laborers. The government responded with on official declaration: \"The government has been informed that individuals who are hostile towards the present policy, known as communists, are spreading tendentious rumors to the effect that the creoles are to be obliged to contract themselves for the work on the \"roças\" like \"serviçais.\" The government declares that no creole should give credit to these rumors, but should report such individuals to the police. Thus, the government which has the obligation to protect the creoles, as it has always demonstrated, guarantees them that it will never agree to authorize such contracts.\" Crowds of protestors gathered on February 3 and the police killed one of them, Manuel da Conceição Soares. His death precipitated a large protest in Trindade the following day.\n\nGorgulho informed colonists and the administration that a communist rebellion was in the offing and he issued a call for all white colonists to take up arms to protect themselves and white women. Militias were quickly formed and some Cape Verdians responded to the call-to-arms. In addition, planters mobilized Angolan and Mozambican workers. Over the next few days the militias and colonial government killed hundreds of \"forros\". Twenty-eight people were suffocated in a cell by the local police, the \"Corpo de Polícia Indígena\" (CPI, Indigenous Police Corps); on one estate, twenty people were burned to death. The authorities subjected prisoners to torture using electricity and scores of prisoners died as a result of torture, beatings, and forced labor. The authorities dumped many bodies into the sea. \"Throw this shit into the sea to avoid troubles,\" Gorgulho is quoted as advising.\n\nOn March 4 members of the Portuguese International and State Defense Police arrived to conduct an investigation into the alleged communist conspiracy. They quickly concluded there was no such conspiracy and, in April, Sarmento Rodrigues, the Minister of Overseas Territories, ordered Gorgulho to return to Lisbon. He was promoted to the rank of general and praised by the Minister of the Army, General Abranches Pinto, for his actions. Seven \"forros\" were tried and convicted for the killing of two police officers. It marked the rise of the independence movement in Portuguese São Tomé and Príncipe, and is commemorated annually as a national holiday (\"Dia de Mártires da Liberdade\") on February 3.\n\n\n"}

It has been suggested that this shape is optimal for surface area to volume ratio, but this hypothesis has not been widely accepted. In addition, it has been suggested that the biconcave shape is needed to optimise the blood's flow properties.\n\nBiconcave shape of the red blood cells.\nMammalian red blood cells also known as erythrocyte are a cellular component of the blood which give the blood its characteristic red color and transport oxygen from the lungs to the tissues. Mature red blood cells are round and biconcave because they lack a nucleus and unlike other cells, red cells require a small amount of oxygen for its metabolism and most oxygen is freed into the tissues. The absence of nucleus, ribosomes, and mitochondria partly contributes to the red blood cell’s disc-like structure which leaves room for hundreds of millions of hemoglobin molecules found within the cells. Hemoglobin is a red and iron-rich protein that merges with oxygen to carry oxygen from the lungs to the body tissues. Both sides of the cell surface bend inwards similar to the inner part of a sphere. \nThe biconcave shape enhances the red blood cell’s ability to maneuver through small blood vessels to transport oxygen to tissues and organs. The distinctive biconcave form also enhances the flow properties of blood in the major vessels. It minimizes platelet scatter and heightens laminar flow, which quells their atherogenic action in those major vessels. Erythrocytes, therefore, increase their applying exterior by assuming a cigar form, where they resourcefully release their oxygen load. The unique and flexible disc structure of red blood cell also helps increase the surface area to volume ratio of the tiny cells which enables oxygen (O2) and carbon dioxide (CO2) to easily diffuse across the cell’s plasma membrane.\n"}

Two other students were hospitalized, one of whom sustained several serious injuries requiring extensive rehabilitation, and the other suffered a minor injury. The seriously injured victim has since been declared permanently paralyzed. A sixth student sustained a superficial wound.\n\nWhile rumors of a warning of the event having been posted on the Internet circulated, student witnesses identified the shooter as Thomas \"T. J.\" Lane III, a 17-year-old male. Although police were initially hesitant to publicly identify the juvenile after he was apprehended, by the evening of February 28, authorities confirmed that the suspect was Lane.\n\nThe weapon Lane used in the shooting was a .22 caliber handgun. At an initial court hearing, the prosecutor revealed that he admitted to shooting 10 rounds of ammunition from the gun during the shooting, which began in the school cafeteria at approximately 7:30 a.m., shortly after school started. Although Lane told police that he did not know the victims and that they were chosen randomly, witnesses stated that it appeared he targeted a specific student and the group he was sitting with in the cafeteria.\n\nAfter the shooting occurred, Lane reportedly left the building. Witnesses stated he was chased from the building by a teacher, and was arrested a short time later outside the school. Lane was ultimately indicted on three counts of aggravated murder, two counts of aggravated attempted murder, and one count of felonious assault. He was initially detained as a juvenile pending further court action.\n\nReaction to the event prompted a statement from Ohio Governor, John Kasich. Several prayer vigils were held and a fund for the victims was established. Thousands of people attended one of the vigils, at which the Governor spoke, the night after the attack. President Barack Obama gave his condolences to the school principal in a telephone call following the incident. Analysis of the crime and comparisons to similar attacks began immediately following the shooting.\n\nIn May 2012, a judge determined that Lane was competent to stand trial. Later that month the decision was made to charge Lane as an adult. He pleaded guilty and received three life sentences on March 19, 2013.\n\nOn September 11, 2014, Lane, along with two other inmates, escaped from Allen Correctional Institution in Lima, Ohio. He was recaptured the following day.\n\nThe shooting began at approximately 7:30 a.m. (EST) in the Chardon High School cafeteria. A student witness said that the shooting began in the cafeteria before first period while students were eating breakfast. According to reports, a boy stood up and began shooting, causing chaos.\n\nA surveillance video showed that Lane shot four male students in the cafeteria with a .22 caliber handgun. As he fled, Lane shot a female student, and was then chased out of the school by a teacher, football coach Frank Hall. Lane was arrested outside the school near his car on Woodin Road.\n\nInitially, five students were hospitalized, three of whom later died. Two students, Joy Rickers and Nick Walczak, were taken to local Hillcrest Hospital, while Daniel Parmertor, Russell King, and Demetrius Hewlin were flown by helicopter to MetroHealth Medical Center in Cleveland. A sixth student, Nate Mueller, was superficially injured when a bullet grazed his right ear.\n\nAt noon on February 27, 2012, Chardon Police Chief Tim McKenna announced in a news conference that one of the victims had died. The first deceased student was identified as Daniel Parmertor, a 16-year-old high school junior, by a spokeswoman for Cleveland's MetroHealth Medical Center. His family issued a statement requesting that their privacy be respected. When Lane opened fire, Parmertor was in the cafeteria waiting for a bus to the Auburn Career Center vocational school in nearby Concord Township, where he studied computer science.\n\nAt 12:42 a.m. the next day, a second student, Russell King, Jr., 17, was pronounced brain dead at MetroHealth Medical Center. King, a junior, studied alternative energy technologies. He was enrolled at both Chardon High School and at the Auburn Career Center. King's family released a statement thanking the public for support and offering sympathy to the families of the other victims. They also said that his organs would be donated as he had wished. A witness, Nate Mueller, said that King had recently started dating Lane's former girlfriend. Other student witnesses said that it appeared as if Lane was specifically aiming for King, indicating that he was the first to be shot. The students stated that King had previously threatened to beat Lane up. They told reporters that Lane had taken up weightlifting with the intention of fighting King.\n\nOn February 28, 2012, it was reported that Demetrius Hewlin, the third student who was transferred to MetroHealth, had died. His family also expressed their sorrow for their loss in a statement to the press. Friends of Hewlin said that he liked to work out and wanted to be on the football team. Hewlin's mother, Phyllis Ferguson, in an interview with ABC News said of her son, \"He wasn't a morning person and he was late for school. But that one day he wasn't late. We were running a little late, but we weren't late enough. But it's okay. It's in God's hands. Let His will be done.\" When questioned about what she would say to the assailant, she said that she would forgive him, because most school shooters did not know what they were doing. She explained that her son's organs would be donated and that one of the recipients was a child who was within days of death without a transplant.\n\nOne of the two injured students who had been transferred to Hillcrest Hospital, 17-year-old Nick Walczak, was shot several times, and one bullet lodged in his cheek. He was also shot in the arm, neck and back. Joy Rickers, 18, was released from Hillcrest Hospital on February 28. Nate Mueller, who was not hospitalized, was nicked in his right ear by a bullet. Mueller and Walczak, students of Auburn Career Center, were waiting with Parmertor and King for the bus that would transfer them to their school on the morning of the shooting.\n\nAfter the shooting, students referred to two teachers, Frank Hall and Joseph Ricci, as heroes. \"The Daily Beast\" reported that news of the men's \"courageous actions\" spread when students expressed thanks on Twitter; the reports indicated that Hall had charged at the shooter despite the shooter pointing his gun at Hall. A student told reporters that Hall frequently spoke of how much he cared for the students, a feeling which was shown by his actions.\n\nMeanwhile, Joe Ricci had just started his math class when he heard shots and ordered his students to \"lockdown\". According to a student witness, when Ricci heard moaning outside his classroom, he put on a bulletproof vest, opened the door, dragged a wounded student, Nick Walczak, into the classroom and administered first aid. Walczak's family credits Ricci with saving his life. A student described the teachers as \"two of the greatest leaders in our school.\"\n\nThomas Michael \"T.

The authorities were reluctant to release his name, since he was still a juvenile, but \"CBS News\" reported that by early afternoon law enforcement officials had surrounded a house belonging to Lane. According to the \"International Business Times\", reports on the possibility of Lane's involvement led to great press interest, which the police initially deflected.\n\nThe authorities searched the home of the suspect's paternal grandparents in Chardon Township. Lane did not live there but would frequently visit on weekends. The residence, along with other properties owned by the Lane family, were searched extensively on the day of the shooting. A nearby forest, which neighbors said the Lane children used for target practice, was also combed.\n\nAt the time of the shooting, Lane was not taking classes at Chardon High School, but at Lake Academy, an alternative school in nearby Willoughby. The school, which is also known as the Lake County Educational Service Center, served 55 students in February 2012. They were referred there from public schools in the region because of academic or behavioral needs. Students who complete their educations at Lake Academy graduate with their classmates at the sending schools.\n\nWitnesses said Lane appeared to be targeting students who were sitting together at one table. Four of the five victims who were sitting at that table were students at the Auburn Career Center. The bus that Lane took from Chardon to Lake Academy was the same one that the Auburn students took, but his stop was farther on the route. Lane also knew some of the victims from middle school.\n\nThere were rumors that there had been a warning about the shooting posted on Twitter. News agencies published excerpts from the Facebook profile of a boy named \"T. J. Lane\". The profile did not give a location but several of the user's friends were listed as being from Chardon. One entry in particular, dated December 30, 2011, caught attention, especially the last line, which read: \"Die, all of you.\" According to a comment posted by Lane on January 20, 2012, he wrote the text in class.\n\nA friend of Lane described him as \"just a very normal teenage boy\". She also told CNN that she was in \"complete shock\" from the incident, and that Lane often had a sad look in his eyes, but came across as completely normal. Another friend said that Lane was regularly teased at school, which made Lane \"put a wall around himself\" and refuse to divulge personal information. A third student told reporters that Lane had come from \"a really broken-down home\", and was a quiet person who could be nice to others if he felt comfortable with them.\n\nStudents at Lake Academy denied that he had been bullied. They described him as friendly and nice, but not very talkative.\n\nAfter Lane's arrest, law enforcement determined that the gun used in the shooting was purchased legally. Authorities said Lane had stolen the .22-caliber handgun from his uncle. The press reported that it was a Ruger MK III Target .22 caliber semi-automatic handgun. However, a neighbor who was close to the family said that it was a target revolver that belonged to the boy's grandfather. When asked how it was possible to fire as many as ten or more rounds from a revolver in quick succession, the neighbor had no explanation and eventually admitted that the revolver hypothesis was probably not true after all. Reports were that the shooter dropped the gun as he fled from the scene. It was found inside the school and recovered by police. Lane also admitted to taking a knife into Chardon High School.\n\nOn February 29, 2012, Timothy J. Grendell, the juvenile court judge presiding over Lane's case, allowed the release of the suspect's juvenile records to the press. According to his records, Lane was arrested twice in December 2009. The first time, Lane restrained his uncle while his cousin hit him. The other case involved Lane hitting another boy in the face. To the second charge, Lane pleaded to a count of disorderly conduct.\n\nOn February 28, 2012, at 3:50 p.m. (EST), a detention hearing was held for the suspect at Geauga County Juvenile Court in Chardon. According to the \"LA Times\", in the United States teenage suspects are generally treated as juveniles until prosecutors decide to charge them as adults. Judge Tim Grendell began the proceeding by asking the media not to take photographs of the defendant until it was determined whether or not he would be tried as an adult. He immediately ruled that the defendant would remain in custody. At the prosecutor's request, the judge directed that the attorneys involved in the case refrain from speaking to the media regarding the proceeding. He then outlined conditions under which the media could participate, including not taking any facial photographs of the defendant or his family. After hearing the prosecutor's argument for continuing the detention and receiving no objection, the judge ruled that detention, at the Portage-Geauga Juvenile Detention Center in Ravenna, Ohio, should continue for 15 days. The issues of arraignment and possible transfer to adult court were put off to future dates. The judge stated that the prosecution had until March 1, 2012, to file charges.\n\nAfter the hearing, prosecutor Dave Joyce indicated that he would attempt to try Lane as an adult and file three counts of aggravated murder, among other charges, for the incident. It was revealed at the hearing that Lane admitted to shooting 10 rounds of ammunition during the incident. He also told the police that he did not know the victims and that they were selected randomly. However, a witness who said he knew the shooter indicated that Lane knew several of the victims.\n\nOutside defense attorneys observing the hearing questioned whether Lane's attorney was protecting his client's rights. First, a concern was raised that Lane's attorney agreed with the judge that the gag order would not go into effect until after the press conference that prosecutor Joyce held following the hearing. One lawyer explained that this exception to the order gave the prosecution the opportunity to announce the defendant's confession publicly, thus influencing the jury pool. A second concern regarded Joyce's statement at the conference that Lane \"is someone who's not well.\" Ian Friedman, a criminal attorney and past president of the Ohio Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers said that such things are generally said by defense attorneys. Another attorney said that in this case, he would file a motion which would ensure that the juvenile's mental health would be evaluated before the case was brought to the adult court. As of March 1, 2012, Lane's defense had filed no motions.\n\nOn March 1, 2012, prosecutors formally charged Lane with three counts of aggravated murder, two counts of aggravated attempted murder, and one count of felonious assault. Lane did not enter a plea when he was arraigned on March 6. Two additional defense attorneys were assigned to the case in March, and the judge postponed the decision to try Lane as an adult until after a competency evaluation was completed. On April 9, Lane again appeared before Judge Grendell who set the date for a competency hearing for May 2. He also scheduled a hearing for May 12 to determine whether the defendant would be tried as an adult.\n\nThe competency evaluation might have been requested by either the prosecution or the defense. It was speculated by one observing attorney that the judge might have made the decision himself. According to Ohio law, \"a child may be found competent only if able to grasp the seriousness of the charges, if able to understand the court proceedings, if able to aid in the defense and if able to understand potential consequences. The law says a child with a mental illness or an intellectual or developmental disability may not be found competent.\"\n\nThe competency hearing was held on May 2, 2012. Testimony was given by psychiatrist Dr. Phillip Resnick. Resnick testified that Lane was mentally ill. He said the defendant was suffering from psychosis that caused hallucinations and loss of contact with reality, but \"does not interfere with Lane's ability to understand the charges against him.\" Judge Grendell determined at this hearing that Lane was competent to stand trial.\n\nIn June 2012, it was determined that Lane would be tried as an adult. He was indicted on the six charges that were filed earlier in March: three counts of aggravated murder, two counts of attempted murder and one count of felonious assault. On June 8, he pleaded not guilty to those charges. His bail was set at $1 million, and he was scheduled to be transferred from the juvenile detention center to county jail on June 18. However, on June 20, a motion was filed with the Geauga County Court of Common Pleas stating that if someone were to pay a $120 fee, he could remain in the Portage-Geauga County Juvenile Detention Center. On February 26, 2013, Lane pleaded guilty to the charges for which he had been indicted.\n\nOn March 19, 2013, Lane was sentenced to three life sentences in prison without parole. After entering the courtroom, he took off his dress shirt to reveal a white T-shirt underneath which had the word \"KILLER\" handwritten across the front. He smiled and smirked during the hearing. After being sentenced, Lane said to the victims' families and the courtroom, \"This hand that pulled the trigger that killed your sons now masturbates to the memory. F*** all of you,\" while giving the middle finger.\n\nOn the morning of the shooting, Ohio Governor John Kasich issued a statement in which he praised the Chardon Police and Geauga County Sheriff's office for their handling of the incident and pledged support to the community. The following day, Kasich ordered that the flag at the Ohio Statehouse, as well as all flags in Geauga County, be flown at half-staff.\n\nIn the wake of the event, officials closed all Chardon schools on February 28. The School Department provided counseling and scheduled a gradual return to school for the students, teachers and staff, with school resuming in full on Friday, March 2, 2012. On the night of February 27, there were several vigils held, including one at Assembly of God Church. After it was suggested on Facebook, tens of thousands agreed to wear red, one of Chardon High School's school colors, on February 28 in support of the school. The United Way set up The Chardon Healing Fund to help those traumatized by the shooting. The fund had already acquired $150,000 by the time its creation was announced on February 28.\n\nIn the evening of the day following the attack, thousands of people attended a vigil at St. Mary's Catholic Church in Chardon, where a funeral mass was scheduled for victim Daniel Parmertor, to take place the following weekend. As on February 28, people in attendance wore red. Chardon High School Principal Andy Fetchik spoke to rally the student body and encourage them to help each other during the healing process, while Kasich encouraged Chardon residents to support those who had lost loved ones. The following day, President Barack Obama telephoned Fetchik and expressed his condolences for the death of the students, saying that both he and First Lady Michelle Obama were praying for the high school community.\n\nOn March 2, 2012, the students entering the building received a warm welcoming. A student from West Geauga High School, her mother, and neighbour organised the \"Line Up At Chardon\" event via Facebook. They welcomed the students of Chardon high school back into the school building with a giant sign that says \"I'll Stand By You\" referencing the song by The Pretenders. More than 100 children from the surrounding school districts, including West Geauga, came to show support. Also, the students of Chardon High School and their parents attended a \"walk through\" of the school. The senior class officers organised a procession from Chardon Square to the school that morning. The organizers invited participation in the walk on Facebook; the day before the activity, over 225 students had shown interest in participating.\n\nClasses resumed the next day. The cafeteria, where the shooting took place, was repainted and reorganised. The table where most of the victims were sitting at the time of the attack remained in place, however, as \"a counterpoint to the way the other tables are arranged\". The table was covered with flowers and stuffed animals.\n\nOn March 2, 2012, WEWS-TV reported that Fred Phelps, Jr., whose father founded the Westboro Baptist Church (WBC), had posted on Twitter that the WBC was planning to \"street-preach\" about the Ohio shooting \"regarding God's hand, judgments and vengeance in this affair.\" Another Twitter post from a member of the church said the group would protest Daniel Parmertor's funeral. In response, Chardon resident Alex Pavlick sent out a request on Facebook for people to join him in forming a barricade around St. Mary's Church, where the funeral was to be held on March 3, if the WBC showed up to protest. He wrote that he wanted to ensure the funeral was not ruined by \"a group of extremists.\" By the time the story was posted on the television station's web site, 1600 people had agreed to join Alex in his counter-protest. The day of the funeral, the television station reported that a human barricade consisting of thousands had readied, but the WBC protestors did not come.\n\nThree days after Parmertor's funeral, Demetrius Hewlin's funeral was held, also at St. Mary's. Members of four motorcycle clubs, including the Patriot Guard Riders participated as part of the honor guard. The Patriot Guard was formed specifically to provide a barrier for families of fallen soldiers at funerals which are protested by the Westboro Baptist Church.\n\nAt 7:38 p.m on September 11, 2014, eight days before his 20th birthday, Lane escaped from Allen Correctional Institution in Lima, Ohio, along with two other inmates. The three inmates escaped using a makeshift ladder to scale a fence during recreation hours. Thirty-three-year-old Lindsey Bruce was quickly captured afterwards. Lane and the other inmate, identified as 45-year-old Clifford Opperud of Carlisle, Ohio, who was serving a 12-year sentence for aggravated robbery, aggravated burglary, and kidnapping, remained at large. Police conducted searches at a wooded area and a residential neighborhood near the prison, and considered him and Opperud as \"potentially armed and dangerous\". Nearby residents were advised to lock their doors and stay inside their homes. Dina Parmertor, Daniel Parmertor's mother, reacted to the escape, saying, \"I'm disgusted that it happened. I'm extremely scared and panic stricken. I can't believe it.\"\n\nAt 1:20 a.m. the following day, Lane was captured near the woods, followed by Opperud over three hours later. Chardon High School was closed that same day and counselors were made available to students and staff. Later in the day, Lane, Opperud, and Bruce were transferred to the Ohio State Penitentiary, a supermax prison in Youngstown, Ohio. In the Youngstown prison, Lane spent 23 hours a day in a cell the size of a small parking space, with one hour of recreation per day. As of March 2016, Lane was transferred to the Southern Ohio Correctional Facility, a maximum security prison in Lucasville, Ohio.\n\n\n"}

According to tradition, Connecticut's Royal Charter of 1662 was hidden within the hollow of the tree to thwart its confiscation by the English governor-general. The oak became a symbol of American independence and is commemorated on the Connecticut State Quarter. In 1935, for Connecticut's tercentennial, it was also depicted on both a commemorative half dollar and a postage stamp.\n\nDutch explorer Adrian Block described a tree at the future site of Hartford in his log in 1614 which is understood to be this one. In the 1630s, a delegation of local Native Americans is said to have approached Samuel Wyllys, the early settler who owned and cleared much of the land around it, encouraging its preservation and describing it as planted ceremonially, for the sake of peace, when their tribe first settled in the area.\n\nThe name \"Charter Oak\" stems from the local legend in which a cavity within the tree was used in late 1687 as a hiding place for the Charter of 1662. \n\nThis much regarding the charter is history:\n\nAccording to the dominant tradition, Andros demanded the document and it was produced, but the lights were suddenly doused during ensuing discussion. The parchment was spirited out a window and thence to the Oak by Captain Joseph Wadsworth, ancestor of Elijah Wadsworth.\n\nTwo documents raise less dramatic possibilities, one contemporaneous and one from early in the next century, by suggesting that a parchment copy had been made of the true charter as early as June, in anticipation of Andros's arrival:\n\nThe Museum of Connecticut History (a subdivision of the Connecticut State Library) credits the idea that Andros never got the original charter, and displays a parchment that it regards as the original. (The Connecticut Historical Society is said to possess a \"fragment\" of it.)\n\nAndros was overthrown in Boston two years later in the 1689 Boston revolt. The Dominion of New England was then dissolved.\n\nThe oak was blown down in a violent storm on August 21, 1856 and timber from it was made into a number of chairs now displayed in the Hartford Capitol Building. The desk of the Governor of Connecticut and the chairs for the Speaker of the House of Representatives and President of the Senate in the state capitol were made from wood salvaged from the Charter Oak.\n\nA wooden baseball made from the Charter Oak was presented by the Charter Oak Engine Co. No. 1 on September 20, 1860 to the Charter Oak Base Ball Club of Brooklyn.\n\nThe New London Historical Society has a pair of cufflinks made from the wood of the Charter Oak with the initial \"G\" donated by Samuel Goldsmith.\n\nScions of the tree still grow in Hartford and many other towns around Connecticut.\n\nNotes\nBibliography\n"}

Its main products target pathogens like MRSA.\n\nCubist was one of the few firms that continued to research in antibiotics while larger pharmaceutical companies have abandoned such research. The company employs 638 people, with 370 in their headquarters in Lexington, MA. As of 2011, the company’s headquarters are under expansion and is expected to occupy in Lexington, MA. On 8 December 2014, Merck & Co. acquired Cubist for $102 per share in cash ($8.4 billion) as entree to the market for drugs that can combat superbugs.\n\nCubist was founded in May 1992 by John K. Clarke, Paul R. Schimmel, Ph.D. and Barry Bloom, Ph.D, all of whom were also directors.\nCubist appeared on Fortune 2010’s List of fastest growing companies, and was named to the 2010 Deloitte Technology Fast 500. In 2006 it had the 19th highest sales among American based biotechnology companies.\n\nIn 2011, the company acquired Adolor, maker of a drug for treatment of constipation.\n\nCubist had an ambitious growth plan laid out for the 2012-2017 quinquennium. Under this plan, the company was expected to reach 2B dollars in sales and have 4 new drugs in late stage development by 2017.

{"id": "43385774", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=43385774", "title": "Death Cafe", "text": "Death Cafe\n\nA Death Cafe is a scheduled non-profit get-together (called \"social franchises\" by the organizers) for the purpose of talking about death over food and drink, usually tea and cake. The goal of these nonprofit groups is to educate and help others become more familiar with the end of life. The idea originates with the Swiss sociologist and anthropologist , who organized the first café mortel in 2004. They have since been held in several countries, beginning with France and the United Kingdom.\n\nThe death café is not a physical location, but is an event hosted at someone's house or other pop-up/ temporary venue. The official objective of a death café is to help people make the most of their finite lives. Individuals can discuss their understanding, thoughts, dreams, fears and all other areas of death and dying at these events. There have been Death Cafes which specifically create a chance for health/care professionals to talk about death (Miles & Corr, 2015). Generally a death café will have in the region of 12 people gathered in a group discussing death related topics and usually lasts 2 hours (Adler, Remer, Coulter, & Miller, 2015). Tea and cake are one of the most important features to the event they assist with creating a nurturing and supportive environment (Underwood, 2015). The concept has spread due to media attention and because of the topic evoking so many different people's thoughts of what death means (Miles & Corr, 2015).\n\nCrettaz organized the first Cafe Mortel in Neuchâtel in 2004 with the aim of breaking the \"tyrannical secrecy\" surrounding the topic of death. He has written a book on the topic, \"Cafés Mortels: Sortir la Mort du Silence\" (Death Cafes: Bringing Death out of Silence). The Death Cafe website created by Death Cafe founder Jon Underwood, states the purpose as: \nAt a Death Cafe people, often strangers, gather to eat cake, drink tea and discuss death.\n\nOur objective is 'to increase awareness of death with a view to helping people make the most of their (finite) lives'.\nFacilitators have said that there is \"a need among people to open [the] closet\" into which death, the \"last taboo\", has been placed, to reduce fear and enable people to live more fully. He has said that at these gatherings, \"the assembled company, for a moment, and thanks to death, is born into authenticity.\" Jon Underwood, a former senior council worker and web developer who founded Death Cafe based on the ideas of Bernard Crettaz, held the first Death Cafe in his home in London, stating that \"we have lost control of one of the most significant events we ever have to face.\"\n\nAccording to one commentator, Crettaz wants to revive the pagan tradition of the funeral feast, \"where the living would renew their bonds while letting go of what weighed on their hearts.\"\n\nThe first Paris Cafe Mortel with Crettaz took place in 2010 and Underwood held the first London event in 2011 at his home, subsequently developing the Death Cafe website, generating guidelines with his mother (psychotherapist and Underwood's first Death Cafe facilitator) Susan Barsky Reid, and publicising the concept which took off globally. The first US event was organized by Lizzy Miles, a hospice worker, in summer 2012 near Columbus, Ohio. By June 2014, the idea had spread to Hong Kong. , over 5,900 have been held worldwide. Venues include homes and rented halls as well as restaurants and cafes; a cemetery and a yurt have also been used. \"Café Totentanz\" or \"Totentanz-Café\" is used in German-speaking areas. In February 2013, a Death Cafe in London was filmed.\n\nDeath Cafes have helped to relax the taboo of speaking about death, particularly with strangers, and encouraged people to express their own wishes for after they die. The open-ended discussions also provide an avenue to express thoughts about one's own life stirred up by the death of a family member.\n\nSince Underwood's death on 25 June 2017, Death Cafe is now run by his sister Jools Barsky and mother Susan Barsky Reid. An informative monograph on the movement, its thematic emphases, and its communicative dynamics can be found in \"The Death Café Movement: Exploring the Horizons of Mortality\" (2017) by Dr. Jack Fong.\n\n\n"}

The transfer is conducted upon arrival at Dover Air Force Base, Delaware, from the arriving aircraft to a transfer vehicle, which then proceeds to the Charles C. Carson Center for Mortuary Affairs.\n\nUS military officials do not designate the dignified transfer as a ceremony so that loved ones of the deceased do not feel obliged to attend. Instead, it is described as \"a solemn movement of the transfer case\".\n\nA dignified transfer is conducted for every U.S. military member who dies in a theater of operation while in the service of their country. A senior ranking officer of the fallen member's branch of service presides over each dignified transfer, with a carry team made up of members of the same branch. Per Department of Defense policy, the remains are returned to the deceased's loved ones as quickly as possible, either by direct flight to Dover from the field, or via Ramstein Air Base, Germany. At Dover, each transfer case is moved one by one from the aircraft to the waiting vehicle, usually a truck.\n\nMedia access to dignified transfers was prohibited from 1991 to 2009, when U.S. Secretary of Defense Robert Gates allowed media attendance contingent on the consent the family of the deceased. Coverage is further restricted only to personnel who died in the line of duty supporting certain operations, such as Enduring Freedom, Iraqi Freedom and Inherent Resolve.\n\nOn August 9, 2011, President Barack Obama, U.S. Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Adm.

{"id": "24536543", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24536543", "title": "Eukaryote", "text": "Eukaryote\n\nEukaryotes () are organisms whose cells have a nucleus enclosed within membranes, unlike prokaryotes (Bacteria and Archaea). Eukaryotes belong to the domain Eukaryota or Eukarya. Their name comes from the Greek εὖ (\"eu\", \"well\" or \"true\") and κάρυον (\"karyon\", \"nut\" or \"kernel\"). Eukaryotic cells also contain other membrane-bound organelles such as mitochondria and the Golgi apparatus, and in addition, some cells of plants and algae contain chloroplasts. Unlike unicellular archaea and bacteria, eukaryotes may also be multicellular and include organisms consisting of many cell types forming different kinds of tissue. Animals and plants are the most familiar eukaryotes.\n\nEukaryotes can reproduce both asexually through mitosis and sexually through meiosis and gamete fusion. In mitosis, one cell divides to produce two genetically identical cells. In meiosis, DNA replication is followed by two rounds of cell division to produce four haploid daughter cells. These act as sex cells (gametes). Each gamete has just one set of chromosomes, each a unique mix of the corresponding pair of parental chromosomes resulting from genetic recombination during meiosis.\n\nThe domain Eukaryota appears to be monophyletic, and makes up one of the domains of life in the three-domain system. The two other domains, Bacteria and Archaea, are prokaryotes and have none of the above features. Eukaryotes represent a tiny minority of all living things. However, due to their generally much larger size, their collective worldwide biomass is estimated to be about equal to that of prokaryotes. Eukaryotes evolved approximately 1.6–2.1 billion years ago, during the Proterozoic eon.\n\nThe concept of the eukaryote has been attributed to the French biologist Edouard Chatton (1883-1947). The terms prokaryote and eukaryote were more definitively reintroduced by the Canadian microbiologist Roger Stanier and the Dutch-American microbiologist C. B. van Niel in 1962. In his 1938 work \"Titres et Travaux Scientifiques\", Chatton had proposed the two terms, calling the bacteria prokaryotes and organisms with nuclei in their cells eukaryotes. However he mentioned this in only one paragraph, and the idea was effectively ignored until Chatton's statement was rediscovered by Stanier and van Niel.\n\nIn 1905 and 1910, the Russian biologist Konstantin Mereschkowski (1855–1921) argued that plastids were reduced cyanobacteria in a symbiosis with a non-photosynthetic (heterotrophic) host that was itself formed by symbiosis between an amoeba-like host and a bacterium-like cell that formed the nucleus. Plants had thus inherited photosynthesis from cyanobacteria.\n\nIn 1967, Lynn Margulis provided microbiological evidence for endosymbiosis as the origin of chloroplasts and mitochondria in eukaryotic cells in her paper, \"On the origin of mitosing cells.\" In the 1970s, Carl Woese explored microbial phylogenetics, studying variations in 16S ribosomal RNA. This helped to uncover the origin of the eukaryotes and the symbiogenesis of two important eukaryote organelles, mitochondria and chloroplasts. In 1977, Woese and George Fox introduced a \"third form of life\", which they called the Archaebacteria; in 1990, Woese, Otto Kandler and Mark L. Wheeler renamed this the Archaea.\n\nIn 1979, G. W. Gould and G. J. Dring suggested that the eukaryotic cell's nucleus came from the ability of Gram-positive bacteria to form endospores. In 1987 and later papers, Thomas Cavalier-Smith proposed instead that the membranes of the nucleus and endoplasmic reticulum first formed by infolding a prokaryote's plasma membrane. In the 1990s, several other biologists proposed endosymbiotic origins for the nucleus, effectively reviving Mereschkowski's theory.\n\nEukaryotic cells are typically much larger than those of prokaryotes having a volume of around 10,000 times greater than the prokaryotic cell. They have a variety of internal membrane-bound structures, called organelles, and a cytoskeleton composed of microtubules, microfilaments, and intermediate filaments, which play an important role in defining the cell's organization and shape. Eukaryotic DNA is divided into several linear bundles called chromosomes, which are separated by a microtubular spindle during nuclear division.\n\nEukaryote cells include a variety of membrane-bound structures, collectively referred to as the endomembrane system. Simple compartments, called vesicles and vacuoles, can form by budding off other membranes. Many cells ingest food and other materials through a process of endocytosis, where the outer membrane invaginates and then pinches off to form a vesicle. It is probable that most other membrane-bound organelles are ultimately derived from such vesicles. Alternatively some products produced by the cell can leave in a vesicle through exocytosis.\n\nThe nucleus is surrounded by a double membrane (commonly referred to as a nuclear membrane or nuclear envelope), with pores that allow material to move in and out. Various tube- and sheet-like extensions of the nuclear membrane form the endoplasmic reticulum, which is involved in protein transport and maturation. It includes the rough endoplasmic reticulum where ribosomes are attached to synthesize proteins, which enter the interior space or lumen. Subsequently, they generally enter vesicles, which bud off from the smooth endoplasmic reticulum. In most eukaryotes, these protein-carrying vesicles are released and further modified in stacks of flattened vesicles (cisternae), the Golgi apparatus.\n\nVesicles may be specialized for various purposes. For instance, lysosomes contain digestive enzymes that break down most biomolecules in the cytoplasm. Peroxisomes are used to break down peroxide, which is otherwise toxic. Many protozoans have contractile vacuoles, which collect and expel excess water, and extrusomes, which expel material used to deflect predators or capture prey. In higher plants, most of a cell's volume is taken up by a central vacuole, which mostly contains water and primarily maintains its osmotic pressure.\n\nMitochondria are organelles found in all but one eukaryote. Mitochondria provide energy to the eukaryote cell by converting sugars into ATP. They have two surrounding membranes, each a phospholipid bi-layer; the inner of which is folded into invaginations called cristae where aerobic respiration takes place.\nThe outer mitochondrial membrane is freely permeable and allows almost anything to enter into the intermembrane space while the inner mitochondrial membrane is semi permeable so allows only some required things into the mitochondrial matrix.\n\nMitochondria contain their own DNA, which has close structural similarities to bacterial DNA, and which encodes rRNA and tRNA genes that produce RNA which is closer in structure to bacterial RNA than to eukaryote RNA. They are now generally held to have developed from endosymbiotic prokaryotes, probably proteobacteria.\n\nSome eukaryotes, such as the metamonads such as \"Giardia\" and \"Trichomonas\", and the amoebozoan Pelomyxa, appear to lack mitochondria, but all have been found to contain mitochondrion-derived organelles, such as hydrogenosomes and mitosomes, and thus have lost their mitochondria secondarily. They obtain energy by enzymatic action on nutrients absorbed from the environment. The metamonad \"Monocercomonoides\" has also acquired, by lateral gene transfer, a cytosolic sulfur mobilisation system which provides the clusters of iron and sulfur required for protein synthesis. The normal mitochondrial iron-sulfur cluster pathway has been lost secondarily.\n\nPlants and various groups of algae also have plastids. Plastids also have their own DNA and are developed from endosymbionts, in this case cyanobacteria. They usually take the form of chloroplasts which, like cyanobacteria, contain chlorophyll and produce organic compounds (such as glucose) through photosynthesis. Others are involved in storing food. Although plastids probably had a single origin, not all plastid-containing groups are closely related. Instead, some eukaryotes have obtained them from others through secondary endosymbiosis or ingestion. The capture and sequestering of photosynthetic cells and chloroplasts occurs in many types of modern eukaryotic organisms and is known as kleptoplasty.\n\nEndosymbiotic origins have also been proposed for the nucleus, and for eukaryotic flagella.\n\nMany eukaryotes have long slender motile cytoplasmic projections, called flagella, or similar structures called cilia. Flagella and cilia are sometimes referred to as undulipodia, and are variously involved in movement, feeding, and sensation. They are composed mainly of tubulin. These are entirely distinct from prokaryotic flagellae. They are supported by a bundle of microtubules arising from a centriole, characteristically arranged as nine doublets surrounding two singlets. Flagella also may have hairs, or mastigonemes, and scales connecting membranes and internal rods. Their interior is continuous with the cell's cytoplasm.\n\nMicrofilamental structures composed of actin and actin binding proteins, e.g., α-actinin, fimbrin, filamin are present in submembraneous cortical layers and bundles, as well. Motor proteins of microtubules, e.g., dynein or kinesin and actin, e.g., myosins provide dynamic character of the network.\n\nCentrioles are often present even in cells and groups that do not have flagella, but conifers and flowering plants have neither. They generally occur in groups that give rise to various microtubular roots. These form a primary component of the cytoskeletal structure, and are often assembled over the course of several cell divisions, with one flagellum retained from the parent and the other derived from it. Centrioles produce the spindle during nuclear division.\n\nThe significance of cytoskeletal structures is underlined in the determination of shape of the cells, as well as their being essential components of migratory responses like chemotaxis and chemokinesis. Some protists have various other microtubule-supported organelles. These include the radiolaria and heliozoa, which produce axopodia used in flotation or to capture prey, and the haptophytes, which have a peculiar flagellum-like organelle called the haptonema.\n\nThe cells of plants and algae, fungi and most chromalveolates have a cell wall, a layer outside the cell membrane, providing the cell with structural support, protection, and a filtering mechanism. The cell wall also prevents over-expansion when water enters the cell.\n\nThe major polysaccharides making up the primary cell wall of land plants are cellulose, hemicellulose, and pectin. The cellulose microfibrils are linked via hemicellulosic tethers to form the cellulose-hemicellulose network, which is embedded in the pectin matrix. The most common hemicellulose in the primary cell wall is xyloglucan.\n\nThere are many different types of eukaryotic cells, though animals and plants are the most familiar eukaryotes, and thus provide an excellent starting point for understanding eukaryotic structure. Fungi and many protists have some substantial differences, however.\n\nAll animals are eukaryotic. Animal cells are distinct from those of other eukaryotes, most notably plants, as they lack cell walls and chloroplasts and have smaller vacuoles. Due to the lack of a cell wall, animal cells can transform into a variety of shapes. A phagocytic cell can even engulf other structures.\n\nPlant cells are quite different from the cells of the other eukaryotic organisms. Their distinctive features are:\n\nThe cells of fungi are most similar to animal cells, with the following exceptions:\n\nSome groups of eukaryotes have unique organelles, such as the cyanelles (unusual chloroplasts) of the glaucophytes, the haptonema of the haptophytes, or the ejectosomes of the cryptomonads. Other structures, such as pseudopodia, are found in various eukaryote groups in different forms, such as the lobose amoebozoans or the reticulose foraminiferans.\n\nCell division generally takes place asexually by mitosis, a process that allows each daughter nucleus to receive one copy of each chromosome. Most eukaryotes also have a life cycle that involves sexual reproduction, alternating between a haploid phase, where only one copy of each chromosome is present in each cell and a diploid phase, wherein two copies of each chromosome are present in each cell. The diploid phase is formed by fusion of two haploid gametes to form a zygote, which may divide by mitosis or undergo chromosome reduction by meiosis. There is considerable variation in this pattern. Animals have no multicellular haploid phase, but each plant generation can consist of haploid and diploid multicellular phases.\n\nEukaryotes have a smaller surface area to volume ratio than prokaryotes, and thus have lower metabolic rates and longer generation times.\n\nThe evolution of sexual reproduction may be a primordial and fundamental characteristic of eukaryotes. Based on a phylogenetic analysis, Dacks and Roger proposed that facultative sex was present in the common ancestor of all eukaryotes. A core set of genes that function in meiosis is present in both \"Trichomonas vaginalis\" and \"Giardia intestinalis\", two organisms previously thought to be asexual. Since these two species are descendants of lineages that diverged early from the eukaryotic evolutionary tree, it was inferred that core meiotic genes, and hence sex, were likely present in a common ancestor of all eukaryotes. Eukaryotic species once thought to be asexual, such as parasitic protozoa of the genus \"Leishmania\", have been shown to have a sexual cycle. Also, evidence now indicates that amoebae, previously regarded as asexual, are anciently sexual and that the majority of present-day asexual groups likely arose recently and independently.\n\nIn antiquity, the two lineages of animals and plants were recognized. They were given the taxonomic rank of Kingdom by Linnaeus. Though he included the fungi with plants with some reservations, it was later realized that they are quite distinct and warrant a separate kingdom, the composition of which was not entirely clear until the 1980s. The various single-cell eukaryotes were originally placed with plants or animals when they became known. In 1830, the German biologist Georg A. Goldfuss coined the word \"protozoa\" to refer to organisms such as ciliates, and this group was expanded until it encompassed all single-celled eukaryotes, and given their own kingdom, the Protista, by Ernst Haeckel in 1866. The eukaryotes thus came to be composed of four kingdoms:\n\nThe protists were understood to be \"primitive forms\", and thus an evolutionary grade, united by their primitive unicellular nature. The disentanglement of the deep splits in the tree of life only really started with DNA sequencing, leading to a system of domains rather than kingdoms as top level rank being put forward by Carl Woese, uniting all the eukaryote kingdoms under the eukaryote domain. At the same time, work on the protist tree intensified, and is still actively going on today. Several alternative classifications have been forwarded, though there is no consensus in the field.\n\nEukaryotes are a clade usually assessed to be sister to Heimdallarchaeota in the Asgard grouping in the Archaea. The basal groupings are the Opimoda, Diphoda, the Discoba, and the Loukozoa. The Eukaryote root is usually assessed to be near or even in Discoba.\n\nA classification produced in 2005 for the International Society of Protistologists, which reflected the consensus of the time, divided the eukaryotes into six supposedly monophyletic 'supergroups'. However, in the same year (2005), doubts were expressed as to whether some of these supergroups were monophyletic, particularly the Chromalveolata, and a review in 2006 noted the lack of evidence for several of the supposed six supergroups. A revised classification in 2012 recognizes five supergroups.\n\nThere are also smaller groups of eukaryotes whose position is uncertain or seems to fall outside the major groups—in particular, Haptophyta, Cryptophyta, Centrohelida, Telonemia, Picozoa, Apusomonadida, Ancyromonadida, Breviatea, and the genus \"Collodictyon\". Overall, it seems that, although progress has been made, there are still very significant uncertainties in the evolutionary history and classification of eukaryotes. As Roger & Simpson said in 2009 \"with the current pace of change in our understanding of the eukaryote tree of life, we should proceed with caution.\"\n\nIn an article published in \"Nature Microbiology\" in April 2016 the authors, \"reinforced once again that the life we see around us – plants, animals, humans and other so-called eukaryotes – represent a tiny percentage of the world's biodiversity.\" They classified eukaryote \"based on the inheritance of their information systems as opposed to lipid or other cellular structures.\" Jillian F. Banfield of the University of California, Berkeley and fellow scientists used a super computer to generate a diagram of a new tree of life based on DNA from 3000 species including 2,072 known species and 1,011 newly reported microbial organisms, whose DNA they had gathered from diverse environments. As the capacity to sequence DNA became easier, Banfield and team were able to do metagenomic sequencing—\"sequencing whole communities of organisms at once and picking out the individual groups based on their genes alone.\"\n\nThe rRNA trees constructed during the 1980s and 1990s left most eukaryotes in an unresolved \"crown\" group (not technically a true crown), which was usually divided by the form of the mitochondrial cristae; see crown eukaryotes. The few groups that lack mitochondria branched separately, and so the absence was believed to be primitive; but this is now considered an artifact of long-branch attraction, and they are known to have lost them secondarily.\n\n, there is widespread agreement that the Rhizaria belong with the Stramenopiles and the Alveolata, in a clade dubbed the SAR supergroup, so that Rhizaria is not one of the main eukaryote groups; also that the Amoebozoa and Opisthokonta are each monophyletic and form a clade, often called the unikonts. Beyond this, there does not appear to be a consensus.\n\nIt has been estimated that there may be 75 distinct lineages of eukaryotes. Most of these lineages are protists.\n\nThe known eukaryote genome sizes vary from 8.2 megabases (Mb) in \"Babesia bovis\" to 112,000–220,050 Mb in the dinoflagellate \"Prorocentrum micans\", showing that the genome of the ancestral eukaryote has undergone considerable variation during its evolution. The last common ancestor of all eukaryotes is believed to have been a phagotrophic protist with a nucleus, at least one centriole and cilium, facultatively aerobic mitochondria, sex (meiosis and syngamy), a dormant cyst with a cell wall of chitin and/or cellulose and peroxisomes. Later endosymbiosis led to the spread of plastids in some lineages.\n\nA global tree of eukaryotes from a consensus of phylogenetic evidence (in particular, phylogenomics), rare genomic signatures, and morphological characteristics is presented in Adl \"et al.\" 2012 and Burki 2014/2016 with the Cryptophyta and picozoa having emerged within the Archaeplastida. A similar inclusion of Glaucophyta, Cryptista (and also, unusually, Haptista) has also been made.\n\nIn some analyses, the Hacrobia group (Haptophyta + Cryptophyta) is placed next to Archaeplastida, but in other ones it is nested inside the Archaeplastida. However, several recent studies have concluded that Haptophyta and Cryptophyta do not form a monophyletic group. The former could be a sister group to the SAR group, the latter cluster with the Archaeplastida (plants in the broad sense).\n\nThe division of the eukaryotes into two primary clades, bikonts (Archaeplastida + SAR + Excavata) and unikonts (Amoebozoa + Opisthokonta), derived from an ancestral biflagellar organism and an ancestral uniflagellar organism, respectively, had been suggested earlier. A 2012 study produced a somewhat similar division, although noting that the terms \"unikonts\" and \"bikonts\" were not used in the original sense.\n\nA highly converged and congruent set of trees appears in Derelle et al (2015), Ren et al (2016), Yang et al (2017) and Cavalier-Smith (2015) including the supplementary information, resulting in a more conservative and consolidated tree. It is combined with some results from Cavalier-Smith for the basal Opimoda. The main remaining controversies are the root, and the exact positioning of the Rhodophyta and the bikonts Rhizaria, Haptista, Cryptista, Picozoa and Telonemia, many of which may be endosymbyotic eukaryote-eukaryote hybrids. Archaeplastida acquired chloroplasts probably by endosymbiosis of a prokaryotic ancestor related to a currently extant cyanobacterium, \"Gloeomargarita lithophora\".\n\nThomas Cavalier-Smith 2010, 2013, 2014, 2017 and 2018 places the eukaryotic tree's root between Excavata (with ventral feeding groove supported by a microtubular root) and the grooveless Euglenozoa, and monophyletic Chromista, correlated to a single endosymbyotic event of capturing a red-algae. He et al specifically supports rooting eukaryotic tree between a monophyletic Discoba (Discicristata + Jakobida) and a Amorphea-Diaphoretickes clade.\n\nThe origin of the eukaryotic cell is a milestone in the evolution of life, since eukaryotes include all complex cells and almost all multicellular organisms. The timing of this series of events is hard to determine; Knoll (2006) suggests they developed approximately 1.6–2.1 billion years ago. Some acritarchs are known from at least 1.65 billion years ago, and the possible alga \"Grypania\" has been found as far back as 2.1 billion years ago. The \"Geosiphon\"-like fossil fungus \"Diskagma\" has been found in paleosols 2.2 billion years old.\n\nOrganized living structures have been found in the black shales of the Palaeoproterozoic Francevillian B Formation in Gabon, dated at 2.1 billion years old. Eukaryotic life could have evolved at that time. Fossils that are clearly related to modern groups start appearing an estimated 1.2 billion years ago, in the form of a red alga, though recent work suggests the existence of fossilized filamentous algae in the Vindhya basin dating back perhaps to 1.6 to 1.7 billion years ago.\n\nBiomarkers suggest that at least stem eukaryotes arose even earlier. The presence of steranes in Australian shales indicates that eukaryotes were present in these rocks dated at 2.7 billion years old, although it was suggested they could originate from samples contamination.\n\nWhenever their origins, eukaryotes may not have become ecologically dominant until much later; a massive uptick in the zinc composition of marine sediments has been attributed to the rise of substantial populations of eukaryotes, which preferentially consume and incorporate zinc relative to prokaryotes.\n\nThe nuclear DNA and genetic machinery of eukaryotes is more similar to Archaea than Bacteria, leading to a controversial suggestion that eukaryotes should be grouped with Archaea in the clade Neomura. In other respects, such as membrane composition, eukaryotes are similar to Bacteria. Three main explanations for this have been proposed:\n\nAlternative proposals include:\n\nAssuming no other group is involved, there are three possible phylogenies for the Bacteria, Archaea and Eukaryota in which each is monophyletic. These are labelled 1 to 3 in the table below. The eocyte hypothesis is a modification of hypothesis 2 in which the Archaea are paraphyletic. (The table and the names for the hypotheses are based on Harish and Kurland, 2017.)\n\nIn recent years, most researchers have favoured either the three domains (3D) or the eocyte hypotheses. An rRNA analyses supports the eocyte scenario, apparently with the Eukaryote root in Excavata. A cladogram supporting the eocyte hypothesis, positioning eukaryotes within Archaea, based on phylogenomic analyses of the Asgard archaea, is:\n\nIn this scenario, the Asgard group is seen as a sister taxon of the TACK group, which comprises Crenarchaeota (formerly named eocytes), Thaumarchaeota, and others.\n\nIn 2017, there has been significant pushback against this scenario, arguing that the eukaryotes did not emerge within the Archaea. Cunha \"et al.\" produced analyses supporting the three domains (3D) or Woese hypothesis (2 in the table above) and rejecting the eocyte hypothesis (4 above). Harish and Kurland found strong support for the earlier two empires (2D) or Mayr hypothesis (1 in the table above), based on analyses of the coding sequences of protein domains. They rejected the eocyte hypothesis as the least likely. A possible interpretation of their analysis is that the universal common ancestor (UCA) of the current tree of life was a complex organism that survived an evolutionary bottleneck, rather than a simpler organism arising early in the history of life.\n\nThe origins of the endomembrane system and mitochondria are also unclear. The phagotrophic hypothesis proposes that eukaryotic-type membranes lacking a cell wall originated first, with the development of endocytosis, whereas mitochondria were acquired by ingestion as endosymbionts. The syntrophic hypothesis proposes that the proto-eukaryote relied on the proto-mitochondrion for food, and so ultimately grew to surround it. Here the membranes originated after the engulfment of the mitochondrion, in part thanks to mitochondrial genes (the hydrogen hypothesis is one particular version).\n\nIn a study using genomes to construct supertrees, Pisani \"et al.\" (2007) suggest that, along with evidence that there was never a mitochondrion-less eukaryote, eukaryotes evolved from a syntrophy between an archaea closely related to Thermoplasmatales and an α-proteobacterium, likely a symbiosis driven by sulfur or hydrogen. The mitochondrion and its genome is a remnant of the α-proteobacterial endosymbiont.\n\nDifferent hypotheses have been proposed as to how eukaryotic cells came into existence. These hypotheses can be classified into two distinct classes – autogenous models and chimeric models.\n\nAutogenous models propose that a proto-eukaryotic cell containing a nucleus existed first, and later acquired mitochondria.\nAccording to this model, a large prokaryote developed invaginations in its plasma membrane in order to obtain enough surface area to service its cytoplasmic volume. As the invaginations differentiated in function, some became separate compartments—giving rise to the endomembrane system, including the endoplasmic reticulum, golgi apparatus, nuclear membrane, and single membrane structures such as lysosomes.\nMitochondria are proposed to come from the endosymbiosis of an aerobic proteobacterium, and it is assumed that all the eukaryotic lineages that did not acquire mitochondria became extinct.\nChloroplasts came about from another endosymbiotic event involving cyanobacteria. Since all eukaryotes have mitochondria, but not all have chloroplasts, the serial endosymbiosis theory proposes that mitochondria came first.\n\nChimeric models claim that two prokaryotic cells existed initially – an archaeon and a bacterium. These cells underwent a merging process, either by a physical fusion or by endosymbiosis, thereby leading to the formation of a eukaryotic cell. Within these chimeric models, some studies further claim that mitochondria originated from a bacterial ancestor while others emphasize the role of endosymbiotic processes behind the origin of mitochondria.\n\nBased on the process of mutualistic symbiosis, the hypotheses can be categorized as – the serial endosymbiotic theory (SET), the hydrogen hypothesis (mostly a process of symbiosis where hydrogen transfer takes place among different species), and the syntrophy hypothesis.\n\nAccording to serial endosymbiotic theory (championed by Lynn Margulis), a union between a motile anaerobic bacterium (like \"Spirochaeta\") and a thermoacidophilic crenarchaeon (like \"Thermoplasma\" which is sulfidogenic in nature) gave rise to the present day eukaryotes. This union established a motile organism capable of living in the already existing acidic and sulfurous waters. Oxygen is known to cause toxicity to organisms that lack the required metabolic machinery. Thus, the archaeon provided the bacterium with a highly beneficial reduced environment (sulfur and sulfate were reduced to sulfide). In microaerophilic conditions, oxygen was reduced to water thereby creating a mutual benefit platform. The bacterium on the other hand, contributed the necessary fermentation products and electron acceptors along with its motility feature to the archaeon thereby gaining a swimming motility for the organism. From a consortium of bacterial and archaeal DNA originated the nuclear genome of eukaryotic cells. Spirochetes gave rise to the motile features of eukaryotic cells. Endosymbiotic unifications of the ancestors of alpha-proteobacteria and cyanobacteria, led to the origin of mitochondria and plastids respectively. For example, \"Thiodendron\" has been known to have originated via an ectosymbiotic process based on a similar syntrophy of sulfur existing between the two types of bacteria – \"Desulphobacter\" and \"Spirochaeta\". However, such an association based on motile symbiosis have never been observed practically. Also there is no evidence of archaeans and spirochetes adapting to intense acid-based environments.\n\nIn the hydrogen hypothesis, the symbiotic linkage of an anaerobic and autotrophic methanogenic archaeon (host) with an alpha-proteobacterium (the symbiont) gave rise to the eukaryotes. The host utilized hydrogen (H) and carbon dioxide () to produce methane while the symbiont, capable of aerobic respiration, expelled H and as byproducts of anaerobic fermentation process. The host's methanogenic environment worked as a sink for H, which resulted in heightened bacterial fermentation. Endosymbiotic gene transfer (EGT) acted as a catalyst for the host to acquire the symbionts' carbohydrate metabolism and turn heterotrophic in nature. Subsequently, the host's methane forming capability was lost. Thus, the origins of the heterotrophic organelle (symbiont) are identical to the origins of the eukaryotic lineage. In this hypothesis, the presence of H represents the selective force that forged eukaryotes out of prokaryotes.\n\nThe syntrophy hypothesis was developed in contrast to the hydrogen hypothesis and proposes the existence of two symbiotic events. According to this theory, the origin of eukaryotic cells was based on metabolic symbiosis (syntrophy) between a methanogenic archaeon and a delta-proteobacterium. This syntrophic symbiosis was initially facilitated by H transfer between different species under anaerobic environments. In earlier stages, an alpha-proteobacterium became a member of this integration, and later developed into the mitochondrion. Gene transfer from a delta-proteobacterium to an archaeon led to the methanogenic archaeon developing into a nucleus. The archaeon constituted the genetic apparatus, while the delta-proteobacterium contributed towards the cytoplasmic features. This theory incorporates two selective forces at the time of nucleus evolution – (a) presence of metabolic partitioning to avoid the harmful effects of the co-existence of anabolic and catabolic cellular pathways, and (b) prevention of abnormal protein biosynthesis due to a vast spread of introns in the archaeal genes after acquiring the mitochondrion and losing methanogenesis.\n\nPitts and Galbanón propose a complex scenario of 6+ serial endosymbiotic events of Archaea and bacteria in which mitochondria and an asgard related archaeota were acquired at a late stage of eukaryogenesis, possibly in combination, as a secondary endosymbiote. The findings have been rebuked as an artefact.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "684740", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=684740", "title": "Gregg Toland", "text": "Gregg Toland\n\nGregg Toland, A.S.C. (May 29, 1904 – September 28, 1948) was an American cinematographer known for his innovative use of techniques such as deep focus, examples of which can be found in his work on Orson Welles' \"Citizen Kane\" (1941), William Wyler's \"The Best Years of Our Lives\" (1946), and John Ford's \"The Long Voyage Home\" (1940). Toland was voted as one of the top 10 (actually 11 with a tie) most influential cinematographers in the history of films by the International Cinematographers Guild in 2003.\n\nToland was born in Charleston, Illinois on May 29, 1904 to Jennie, a housekeeper, and Frank Toland. His mother moved to California several years after his parents divorced in 1910.\n\nHe first demonstrated his chiaroscuro, side-lit style on the short film \"\" (1928), on which one of the two 400W bulbs they had available burned out, leaving only a single bulb to light with.\n\nDuring the 1930s, Toland became the youngest cameraman in Hollywood but soon one of its most sought-after cinematographers. Over a seven-year span (1936–1942), he was nominated five times for the Academy Award for Best Cinematography, including an Academy Award for his work on \"Wuthering Heights\" (1939). He worked with many of the leading directors of his era, including John Ford, Howard Hawks, Erich von Stroheim, King Vidor, Orson Welles, and William Wyler.\n\nJust before his death, he was concentrating on the \"ultimate focus\" lens, which makes both near and far objects equally distinct. \"Just before he died he had worked out a new lens with which he had made spectacular shots. He carried in his wallet a strip of film taken with this lens, of which he was very proud. It was a shot of a face three inches from the lens, filling one-third of the left side of the frame. Three feet from the lens, in the center of the foreground, was another face, and then, over a hundred yards away was the rear wall of the studio, showing telephone wires and architectural details. Everything was in focus, from three inches to infinity\".\n\nHe died in his sleep, in Los Angeles, California on September 28, 1948 of coronary thrombosis at age 44. He is interred in the Hollywood Forever Cemetery in Hollywood, California.\n\nSome film historians believe \"Citizen Kane\"'s visual brilliance was due primarily to the contributions of Toland, rather than director Orson Welles. However, many Welles scholars maintain that the visual style of \"Kane\" is similar to many of Welles's other films, and hence should be considered the director's work. Nevertheless, the Welles movies that most resemble \"Citizen Kane\" (\"The Magnificent Ambersons\", \"The Stranger\", and \"Touch of Evil\") were shot by Toland collaborators Stanley Cortez and Russell Metty (at RKO).\n\nAt the time \"Kane\" was produced and released, Welles and Toland (among others) insisted that Welles gave lighting instructions that fall normally under the director of photography's responsibility. Many of the transitions in the film are done as lighting cues on set (such as the transition at the opening of the film from the outside of Xanadu into Kane's bedroom for his death), where lights are dimmed up and down on stage. Apparently, Welles was unaware that one could achieve the effects optically on a film so he instructed the crew to dim the lights the way you would on a theater production, which led to the unique dissolves. Different areas of the frame dissolve at different times, based on the lighting cue. However, the visuals were truly a collaboration, as Toland contributed great amounts of technical expertise that Welles needed so that he could achieve his vision. Years later, Welles acknowledged, \"Toland was advising him on camera placement and lighting effects secretly so the young director would not be embarrassed in front of the highly experienced crew.\"\n\nToland's techniques were revolutionary in the art of cinematography. Cinematographers before him used a shallow depth of field to separate the various planes on the screen, creating an impression of space as well as stressing what mattered in the frame by leaving the rest (the foreground or background) out of focus.\n\nIn Toland's lighting schemes, shadow became a much more compelling tool, both dramatically and pictorially, to separate the foreground from the background and so to create space within a two-dimensional frame while keeping all of the picture in focus. According to Toland, this visual style was more comparable with what the eyes see in real life since vision blurs what is \"not\" looked at rather than what is.\n\nFor John Ford's \"The Long Voyage Home\" (1940), Toland leaned more heavily on back-projection to create his deep focus compositions, such as the shot of the island women singing to entice the men of the SS Glencairn. He continued to develop the technologies that would allow for him to create his images in \"Citizen Kane\".\n\nToland innovated extensively on \"Citizen Kane\", creating deep focus on a sound-stage, collaborating with set designer Perry Ferguson so ceilings would be visible in the frame by stretching bleached muslin to stand in as a ceiling, allowing placement of the microphone closer to the action without being seen in frame. He also modified the Mitchell Camera to allow a wider range of movement, especially from low angles. ″It was Toland who devised a remote-control system for focusing his camera lens without having to get in the way of the camera operator who would now be free to pan and tilt the camera.\"\n\nThe main way to achieve deep focus was closing down the aperture, which required increasing the lighting intensity, lenses with better light transmission, and faster film stock. On \"Citizen Kane\", the cameras and coated lenses used were of Toland's own design working in conjunction with engineers from Caltech. His lenses were treated with Vard Opticoat to reduce glare and increase light transmission. He used the Kodak Super XX film stock, which was, at the time, the fastest film available, with an ASA film speed of 100. Toland had worked closely with a Kodak representative during the stock's creation before its release in October 1938, and was one of the first cinematographers using it heavily on set.\n\nLens apertures employed on most productions were usually within the f/2.3 to f/3.5 range; Toland shot his scenes in between f/8 and f/16. This was possible because several elements of technology came together at once: the technicolor three strip process, which required the development of more powerful lights, had been developed and the more powerful Carbon Arc light was beginning to be used. By utilizing these lights with the faster stock, Toland was able to achieve apertures previously unattainable on a stage shoot.\n\nGregg Toland collaborated on a number of shots with special-effects cinematographer Linwood G. Dunn. Although these looked like they were using deep focus, they were actually a composite of two different shots. Some of these shots were composited with an optical printer, a device which Dunn improved upon over the years, which explains why foreground and background are both in focus even though the lenses and film stock used in 1941 could not allow for such depth of field.\n\nBut Toland hated this technique, since he felt he was \"duping,\" (i.e. a copy of a copy) thereby lowering the quality of his shots. Thus other shots (like the shot of Susan Alexander Kane's bedroom after her suicide attempt, with a glass in the foreground and Kane entering the room in the background) were in-camera composites, meaning the film was exposed twice—another technique that Linwood Dunn improved upon.\n\nToland had already had experience with heavy in-camera compositing, and many of the shots in \"Kane\" look similar in composition and dynamics to a number of shots in John Ford's \"The Long Voyage Home\".\n\nFor instance, both movies contain shots that create an artificial lighting situation such that a character is lit in the background and walks or runs through dark areas to the foreground, where his arrival triggers, off-screen, a light not on before. The result is so visually dramatic because a character moves, only barely visible, through vast pools of shadow, only to exit the shadow very close to the camera, where his whole face is suddenly completely lit. This use of much more shadow than light, soon one of the main techniques of low-key lighting, heavily influenced film noir.\n\n\"The Long Voyage Home\" and \"Citizen Kane\" share a number of other striking similarities:\n\n\nAlthough \"Citizen Kane\" is his most well-regarded achievement, his style was much more varied than most people realize. For \"The Grapes of Wrath\" (1940), he took inspiration from Dorothea Lange's photographs, achieving a rare (for Hollywood) gritty and realist look. For one of his final projects, Toland turned to Technicolor film. Made for Disney, the 1946 \"Song of the South\" combined animation with live action in bright, deeply saturated Technicolor. In \"The Best Years of Our Lives\" his deep focus cinematography served to highlight all the aspects of the characters' lives.\n\nWhen the Office of the Coordinator of Information (predecessor to the Office of Strategic Services and later the Central Intelligence Agency) was created by Franklin Delano Roosevelt before the United States' entry into World War II, Toland was recruited to work in the agency's film unit. Toland was commissioned as a lieutenant in the Navy's camera department, which led to his only work as a director, \"\" (1943); this documentary of the attack on Pearl Harbor, which Toland co-directed with John Ford, is so realistic in its restaged footage that many today mistake it for actual attack footage. This 82-minute film took the Academy Award for Best Documentary (Short Subject).\n\nIn addition to sharing a title card with Orson Welles on Kane—an indication of the high esteem the director held for his cameraman—Welles also gave Toland a cameo in the film as the reporter who is slow to ask questions when Kane returns from Europe.\n\nToland was the subject of an \"Annals of Hollywood\" article in \"The New Yorker\", \"The Cameraman,\" by Hilton Als (June 19, 2006, p. 46).\n\n\nThe results of a survey conducted in 2003 by the International Cinematographers Guild placed Toland in the top ten of history's most influential cinematographers.\nThe 2006 Los Angeles edition of \"CineGear\" assembled a distinguished panel composed of Owen Roizman, László Kovács, Daryn Okada, Rodrigo Prieto, Russell Carpenter, Dariusz Wolski, and others. Called \"Dialogue With ASC Cinematographers,\" the panel was asked to name two or three other cinematographers, living or dead, who had influenced their work or whom they considered to be the best of the best. Each panel member cited Gregg Toland first.\n\n"}

He was the son of an amateur naturalist and professor of Medicine at the Academy of Åbo, Herman Spöring Sr. (1701–1747). Spöring Jr. attended the Academy as a youth, studying medicine under his father.\n\nSometime around 1755, at the age of 22 he went to London, where he worked at a watchmakers. During this time he became acquainted with the Swedish naturalist Daniel Solander, who employed him as a personal clerk for a time.\n\nIn 1768 Spöring was enlisted as a clerk, assistant naturalist and personal secretary in the entourage of Joseph Banks, a wealthy young botanist who was preparing for an expedition sponsored by the Royal Society to the Pacific Ocean. This expedition had as one of its principal goals the observation of the transit of Venus; however it was also intended to make scientific studies of the flora and fauna of any new lands encountered. Indeed, the confidential purpose of the voyage (in particular, from the point of view of the British Admiralty) was to seek out the hypothetical \"unknown southern continent\", or\"Terra Australis (Incognita)\".\n\nThe other noted naturalist on the voyage was Daniel Solander, Spöring's former employer who had recommended Spöring for the post when he himself signed up. Solander was a former student and protégé of the noted Swedish botanist and founder of modern taxonomy, Carl Linnaeus.\n\nSpöring was also a skilled instrument maker, and in addition to his cataloging duties was assigned the maintenance and upkeep of the ship's scientific equipment during the voyage.\n\nThe expedition left England in 1768, aboard HM Bark \"Endeavour\" under the command of R.N. Lt. James Cook, bound for the Society Islands (present-day Tahiti). They arrived there in 1769, where the observations of Venus were taken during the transit on June 3. Spöring had to repair the astronomical quadrant after it had become damaged when it was taken by the local Polynesian inhabitants.\n\nLeaving the Society Islands, the expedition sailed southwards, reaching New Zealand, where Spöring and the other naturalists spent the ensuing months gathering and documenting specimens of native plant and animal life. At a bay now known as Tolaga Bay (not far from the modern township of Gisborne), Cook bestowed the name Spöring Island to a landmark, after the botanist. The island is today known by its original Māori name, \"Pourewa\".\n\nThe expedition continued westwards, and in 1770 the \"Endeavour\" encountered the southeastern coastline of the Australian continent, and became the first European vessel to have navigated the eastern side of the continent. The expedition made first landfall at a site Cook named Botany Bay, very near the site at which 18 years later the colony of Sydney would be established. Banks, Solander and Spöring collected further unique specimens from this site. This collection would be greatly augmented later when the \"Endeavour\" was laid up for several weeks for repairs, after having run aground on a section of the Great Barrier Reef much further to the north. The naturalists availed themselves of the opportunity whilst repairs were being made to continue their compilation of new species.\n\nOnce repairs were made the expedition continued northwards to the East Indies port of Batavia (Jakarta). Until this point in the voyage, no crewmember or passenger had been lost to disease; however, the unhealthy conditions of the port and their new provisions would soon result in quite a few deaths, including that of Spöring himself. In 1771 on the return leg, Spöring died of dysentery complications related to food poisoning. He was buried at sea on January 24, 1771.\n\nHe has a commemorative statue dedicated to him in Sydney, Australia.\n\nIn 1990, a rock taken from Pourewa (Spöring) Island was transported to Spöring's birthplace of Åbo, Finland, to be placed in a monument set up to commemorate his achievements and ties with New Zealand, as the first Finn to have landed there.\n\nAmongst his achievements are the discovery and illustration of a number of hitherto-unknown Australian species. His colleagues and successors who studied his materials have recognised the accuracy and form of his drawings and annotations. His efforts, along with those of others on the voyage provided critical new materials for study, which allowed further advances in the historical development of the theory of evolution to be made.\n"}
{"id": "4771320", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4771320", "title": "Inner cell mass", "text": "Inner cell mass\n\nIn early embryogenesis of most eutherian mammals, the inner cell mass (abbreviated ICM and also known as the embryoblast in mammals or pluriblast) is the mass of cells inside the primordial embryo that will eventually give rise to the definitive structures of the fetus. This structure forms in the earliest steps of development, before implantation into the endometrium of the uterus has occurred. The ICM lies within the blastocoele (more correctly termed \"blastocyst cavity,\" as it is not strictly homologous to the blastocoele of anamniote vertebrates) and is entirely surrounded by the single layer of cells called trophoblast.\n\nThe physical and functional separation of the inner cell mass from the trophectoderm (TE) is a special feature of mammalian development and is the first cell lineage specification in these embryos. Following fertilization in the oviduct, the mammalian embryo undergoes a relatively slow round of cleavages to produce an eight cell morula. Each cell of the morula, called a blastomere, increases surface contact with its neighbors in a process called compaction. This results in a polarization of the cells within the morula, and further cleavage yields a blastocyst of roughly 32 cells. In mice, about 12 internal cells comprise the new inner cell mass and 20 – 24 cells comprise the surrounding trophectoderm. There is variation between species of mammals as to number of cells at compaction with bovine embryos showing differences related to compaction as early as 9-15 cells and in rabbits not until after 32 cells. There is also interspecies variation in gene expression patterns in early embryos.\n\nThe ICM and the TE will generate distinctly different cell types as implantation starts and embryogenesis continues. Trophectoderm cells form extraembryonic tissues, which act in a supporting role for the embryo proper. Furthermore, these cells pump fluid into the interior of the blastocyst, causing the formation of a polarized blastocyst with the ICM attached to the trophectoderm at one end (see figure). This difference in cellular localization causes the ICM cells exposed to the fluid cavity to adopt a primitive endoderm (or hypoblast) fate, while the remaining cells adopt a primitive ectoderm (or epiblast) fate. The hypoblast contributes to extraembryonic membranes and the epiblast will give rise to the ultimate embryo proper as well as some extraembryonic tissues.\n\nSince segregation of pluripotent cells of the inner cell mass from the remainder of the blastocyst is integral to mammalian development, considerable research has been performed to elucidate the corresponding cellular and molecular mechanisms of this process. There is primary interest in which transcription factors and signaling molecules direct blastomere asymmetric divisions leading to what are known as inside and outside cells and thus cell lineage specification. However, due to the variability and regulative nature of mammalian embryos, experimental evidence for establishing these early fates remains incomplete.\n\nAt the transcription level, the transcription factors Oct4, Nanog, Cdx2, and Tead4 have all been implicated in establishing and reinforcing the specification of the ICM and the TE in early mouse embryos. \n\nTogether these transcription factors function in a positive feedback loop that strengthens the ICM to TE cellular allocation. Initial polarization of blastomeres occurs at the 8-16 cell stage. An apical-basolateral polarity is visible through the visualization of apical markers such as Par3, Par6, and aPKC as well as the basal marker E-Cadherin. The establishment of such a polarity during compaction is thought to generate an environmental identity for inside and outside cells of the embryo. Consequently, stochastic expression of the above transcription factors is amplified into a feedback loop that specifies outside cells to a TE fate and inside cells to an ICM fate. In the model, an apical environment turns on \"Cdx2\", which upregulates its own expression through a downstream transcription factor, Elf5. In concert with a third transcription factor, Eomes, these genes act to suppress pluripotency genes like \"Oct4\" and \"Nanog\" in the outside cells. Thus, TE becomes specified and differentiates. Inside cells, however, do not turn on the \"Cdx2\" gene, and express high levels of \"Oct4\", \"Nanog\", and \"Sox2\". These genes suppress \"Cdx2\" and the inside cells maintain pluripotency generate the ICM and eventually the rest of the embryo proper. \nAlthough this dichotomy of genetic interactions is clearly required to divide the blastomeres of the mouse embryo into both the ICM and TE identities, the initiation of these feedback loops remains under debate. Whether they are established stochastically or through an even earlier asymmetry is unclear, and current research seeks to identify earlier markers of asymmetry. For example, some research correlates the first two cleavages during embryogenesis with respect to the prospective animal and vegetal poles with ultimate specification. The asymmetric division of epigenetic information during these first two cleavages, and the orientation and order in which they occur, may contribute to a cell’s position either inside or outside the morula.\n\nBlastomeres isolated from the ICM of mammalian embryos and grown in culture are known as embryonic stem (ES) cells. These pluripotent cells, when grown in a carefully coordinated media, can give rise to all three germ layers (ectoderm, endoderm, and mesoderm) of the adult body. For example, the transcription factor LIF4 is required for mouse ES cells to be maintained in vitro. Blastomeres are dissociated from an isolated ICM in an early blastocyst, and their transcriptional code governed by \"Oct4\", \"Sox2\", and \"Nanog\" helps maintain an undifferentiated state.\n\nOne benefit to the regulative nature in which mammalian embryos develop is the manipulation of blastomeres of the ICM to generate knockout mice. In mouse, mutations in a gene of interest can be introduced retrovirally into cultured ES cells, and these can be reintroduced into the ICM of an intact embryo. The result is a chimeric mouse, which develops with a portion of its cells containing the ES cell genome. The aim of such a procedure is to incorporate the mutated gene into the germ line of the mouse such that its progeny will be missing one or both alleles of the gene of interest. Geneticists widely take advantage of this ICM manipulation technique in studying the function of genes in the mammalian system.\n\n\n"}

Graphic pictures of some of those abuse incidents were made public. Less well-known abuse incidents have been documented at American prisons throughout Iraq.\n\nAccording to the \"Washington Post\", the coalition forces regularly use \"torture-like\" methods during the interrogation of suspects. Such methods were reportedly applied to people to find the hiding place of Saddam Hussein in Operation Red Dawn. British troops have also on occasion been accused of abusing Iraqi detainees. Such treatment violates article 17 of the Third Geneva Convention and the USA and Britain's official policies on combat and occupation. Despite numerous complaints by Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch, it took a year before the first US soldier was court-martialed for their actions concerning abuse of Iraqis.\n\nEight marine reservists were investigated for abuse and the death of a prisoner, outside Nasiriyah.\n\nA photograph leaked after the initial set shows Spc. Sabrina Harman smiling and giving a thumbs up next to the body of Manadel al-Jamadi. Jamadi was reportedly beaten to death during interrogations in the prison's showers.\nDeath certificates repeatedly stated that prisoners had died \"while sleeping\", and of \"natural reasons\". Iraqi doctors are not allowed to investigate the deaths of prisoners, even if death certificates are allegedly forged. No investigations against US military doctors who are alleged to have forged death certificates have been reported.\n\nA US veteran sergeant reports witnessing torture of journalists and writers all over Iraq. Kurdistan region was not an exception. Writers without Borders embarrassed the Iraqi government quite frequently in reports covering minority, women and marginalised Iraqis from all over the country but with much focus on Baghdad, Karkuk, Salahedin and Mosul.\n\nHonorably discharged US veteran, Sergeant Frank \"Greg\" Ford reports that he witnessed war crimes in Samarra, Iraq. According to Ford, several members of his own unit, the 205th Military Intelligence Brigade participated in the torture of Iraqi detainees as young as 14.\n\nAther Karen al-Mowafakia died in Basra, while in British custody. Details about the investigation are not known.\n\nGary Bartlam, a British soldier of the 7th Armoured Brigade, was arrested after submitting film to a photo developers shop in Tamworth, England while on leave. The photographs depict a gagged Iraqi POW suspended hanging by rope from a fork lift, and other pictures seem to show prisoners being forced to perform sexual acts. Bartlam and two other soldiers were convicted at court martial of abuse - a fourth soldier was cleared.\n\nBritish Lieutenant Colonel Tim Collins was alleged by US Army Major Re Biastre to have been responsible for mistreatment of Iraqi civilians and prisoners of war. Lieutenant Colonel Collins was later cleared of any wrongdoing by an MOD investigation.\n\nIn separate incidents, the Royal Military Police declared that Radhi Natna died of a heart attack while in British custody, yet his family reports that he had no heart trouble; and the Black Watch regiment arrested the 17-year-old Ahmad Jabber Kareem Ali in Basra, who then drowned after being ordered to swim across a river despite not being able to swim, according to his friend Ayad Salim Hanoon.\n\nArmy Reservists abused Prisoners at Camp Bucca, and were later court-martialed.\n\nBrigadier General Ennis Whitehead III reported that Master Sergeant Lisa Marie Girman, a state trooper, \"repeatedly kick[ed a prisoner] in the groin, abdomen and head, and encouraging her subordinate soldiers to do the same,\"\n\nLieutenant Colonel Vic Harris reported that Staff Sergeant Scott A. McKenzie who worked at a Pennsylvania Department of Corrections boot-camp-style prison, and Specialist Timothy F. Canjar: held prisoners' legs, encouraged others to then kick them in the groin, stepped on their previously injured arms, and made false sworn statements to the Army Criminal Investigation Division.\n\nThey received \"general under honorable conditions\" discharges, were ordered to forfeit two months' salary, and returned to the United States.\n\nSergeant Shawna Edmondson, also involved in the case, received an \"other-than-honorable\" discharge, after she requested it instead of being court-martialed.\n\nHossam Shaltout said the abuse at Camp Bucca was similar to that at Abu Ghraib prisoner abuse, and that his torture included scorpions placed on his body.\n\nSaid Shabram died in custody, but no information of the investigation were made public.\n\nAmerican forces detained the family of an unidentified lieutenant general to induce him to turn himself in.\n\nThe abuses at Abu Ghraib prison were reportedly committed by MPs. There are allegations that private contractors contributed to them as well and that intelligence agencies such as the CIA ordered them to do so in order to break prisoners for interrogations. It is said to be a usual practice in other US prisons as well, such as in Afghanistan and Guantanamo Bay.\n\nThe International Committee of the Red Cross submitted a detailed report to the U.S. Army in October 2003 about abuses in prisons, and the president of the Red Cross stated he had informed high-ranking members of the Bush administration about the abuses during a meeting in the White House in January 2004. A soldier came forward that month with photos of abuse that he found disturbing, some showed the stacking of prisoners into a human pyramid, with one prisoner's skin visibly bearing a slur written in English. Another showed a prisoner being forced to stand on a box with wires attached to his head and hands, who had reportedly been told that if he fell off the box, he would be electrocuted. Photos released to the public later included a person being attacked by a guard dog, which the soldier involved described as being useful for intimidation of prisoners. It was also reported that an Iraqi hired as a translator raped a juvenile male prisoner while a female soldier took pictures. No charges have been brought against the contractor because he does not fall under military jurisdiction; it is questionable whether any charges will or even can be brought against him.\n\nDonald Rumsfeld had said that army and government had only been informed in January and not in detail. On January 16, 2004, a press release was issued by the United States Central Command (CENTCOM) stating that an investigation had been initiated in response to allegations of detainee abuse at an unspecified detention facility (now known to be Abu Ghraib prison).\n\nIn March 2004, 6 soldiers in Abu Ghraib were charged with dereliction of duty, cruelty and maltreatment, and sexual abuse. 17 others were suspended from duty, including the seven U.S. officers who ran the prison. Also recommended for discipline was Brig. Gen Janis Karpinski, the commander of the 800th brigade. The Red Cross, which had access to these prisons, has stated that the instances of torture were not aberrations but were systemic. Some officers have attempted to defend themselves by saying that they were only doing their duty.\n\nIn response to ongoing complaints, the US military initiated a program to reform the internment and treatment systems. The reforms are expected to increase safeguards for prisoners' rights, to ensure each prisoner receives a copy of their internment order, and has their charges explained to them within 72 hours. They additionally plan to publicly post information about detainees so that family members can know what happened to their loved ones. Reforms were made in March 2004.\n\nTheft of prisoner's possessions by soldiers, dirty, cramped quarters and bad food, prisoners forced into uncomfortable positions for prolonged periods of time, extreme exposure to the elements, and excessive jailings of people based on the paid testimony of individual informants were reported. 55-year-old cafe owner Mahmoud Khodair, who was arrested and held for six months before being released in early march without ever knowing what he was charged with, stated, \"It was just like hell\", and \"Nothing has changed since Saddam. Before, the Mukhabarat [secret police] would take us away, and at least they wouldn't blow down the door. Now, some informant fingers you and gets $100 even if you're innocent.\"\n\nDuring April 2004 the media started to report on the abuse. The journalist Seymour Hersh (who was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for his disclosure of the Vietnam War tragedy at the hamlet of My Lai) published a series of articles in \"The New Yorker\" with photo coverage of U.S. soldiers abusing prisoners in the Abu Ghraib prison on 2004-04-30.\n\nIn an interview with Dan Rather, the deputy director of operations for the US-led coalition, Brig. Gen. Mark Kimmitt, stated \"We're appalled. These are our fellow soldiers. These are the people we work with every day. They represent us. They wear the same uniform as us, and they let their fellow soldiers down. If we can't hold ourselves up as an example of how to treat people with dignity and respect, we can't ask that other nations do that to our soldiers.\"\n\nOn May 1, 2004, photos of prisoners at Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq being abused and humiliated by United States soldiers provoke an international outrage.\n\nFurthering the charges, excerpts from the Abu Ghraib Taguba report were published on May 3, 2004. The report documented: the sodomizing of a prisoner with a chemical light, pouring phosphoric liquid on detainees, rape of a female prisoner, forced masturbation, \"ghost detainees\" moved around to avoid the Red Cross, and many other abuses.\n\nThe release of the photographs and reports had led to renewed calls for investigations into the abuses reported in other US military prisons, such as Camp X-Ray and Camp Delta.\n\nOn May 14, 2004, reporters for the Guardian documented a coercive technique which soldiers called \"bitch in a box\". The prisoner was shoved into the trunk of a car on a hot day, and driven around until the prisoner was near ready to pass out. Another technique documented was \"waterboarding\", which involves water being poured over a cloth covering the face and breathing passages of an immobilized captive, causing the individual to experience the sensation of drowning. They also interviewed many soldiers not involved in the current scandal, who claimed that they were taught to use sleep deprivation, to stage mock executions, and to use other procedures. One platoon leader who objected to these practices was reportedly told that his stand could end his military career.\n\nUSA Defence Secretary Donald Rumsfeld told an armed services committee of the Senate on 2004-05-07 that \"There are a lot more photographs and videos that exist [...] I looked at them last night and they're hard to believe [...] The pictures I've seen depict conduct, behaviour that is so brutal and so cruel and so inhumane that anyone engaged in it or involved in it would have to be brought to justice.\" He also said that the abused detainees may be offered compensation.\n\nIn a scene described as \"surreal\" by AFP, it was found in mid May, 2004 that US troops were handing out cash to freed prisoners along with a note stating \"You have not been mistreated.\". A reporter visiting the prison Camp War Horse described the tour:\n\nIt was claimed that eleven Iraqis had been severely beaten by members of the SAS in Majar al-Kabir; they were released and paid compensation for their injuries.\n\nSadiq Zoman, 57, is delivered in a vegetative state, to a hospital in Tikrit. His body bearing telltale signs of torture: burn marks on his skin, bludgeon marks on the back of his head, a badly broken thumb, electrical burns on the soles of his feet. Additionally, family members say they found whipmarks across his back and more electrical burns on his genitalia. He had entered US custody healthy barely 1 month earlier.\n\nHassan Abbad Said died in custody, but no information of the investigation were made public.\n\nCorporal Donald Payne of the Queen's Lancashire Regiment now the 1st Battalion, Duke of Lancaster's Regiment (King's, Lancashire and Border), became Britain's first convicted war criminal after pleading guilty to abusing Iraqi detainees, which resulted in the death of one detainee Baha Mousa.\n\nAn al Jazeera cameraman, Salah Hassan, reported various abuses in the infamous Abu Ghraib prison complex, such as being forced to strip naked, standing up for 11 hours and being kicked when he collapsed, being forced to wear a vomit-covered jumpsuit, and many other abuses. He later also witnessed a 12- or 13-year-old girl who was stripped naked and beaten. Her brother was held in another cell and heard her screams.\n\nJanuary 3: Marwan Hassoun and his cousin Zaydun Al-Samarrai are taken from their broken-down truck at about curfew time and forced to jump from the Tharthar dam into the Tigris River; the latter drowns. First Lt. Jack M. Saville and Sgt. 1st Class Tracy E. Perkins were charged on 2004 June 7 with manslaughter, assault, conspiracy, making false statements, and obstruction of justice. Sgt. Reggie Martinez was charged three weeks later with manslaughter and for making false statements, and Spec. Terry Bowman with assault and making false statements. Martinez' and Bowman's charges were dropped; Perkins got six months in jail. Saville was jailed (45 days) and fined $12,000 for assault but he remained on active duty until his military obligation was fulfilled.\n\nAlleged photographs of prisoner abuses by UK troops were published by the \"Daily Mirror\" within 48 hours of the breaking of the story of abuses by US troops in the Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq.\n\nGeneral Sir Mike Jackson, Chief of the General Staff, said \"if proven, the perpetrators are not fit to wear the Queen's uniform and they have besmirched the Army's good name and conduct\".\n\nThe authenticity of the photographs was called into question a day later. In particular, a number of specifics in the images, such as the type of rifles the soldiers in the pictures are carrying and the type of truck pictured did not match the equipment used by UK troops in Iraq. The \"Mirror\" responded to these criticisms of the photographs on May 3, 2004.\n\nOn May 14, 2004, the \"Daily Mirror\" reported that the pictures it had published, allegedly showing UK troops abusing an Iraqi prisoner, were fake and that \"the Daily Mirror has been the subject of a calculated and malicious hoax.\" The \"Daily Mirror\" editor, Piers Morgan, was sacked due to the controversy.\n\nOn May 11, 2004, The Boston Globe covered a press conference by Boston City Councilor Chuck Turner and local civil rights activist Sadiki Kambon during which they distributed photographs they alleged showed American soldiers raping Iraqi woman. In its early editions on May 12, photographs from the event clearly showed some of the pictures presented, the Globe later apologized for the error. Other news agencies quickly responded to the story by linking the photographs to American and Hungarian pornography sites. One week prior to the press conference, WorldNetDaily had published a story detailing the origin of these pictures and how they were being used as propaganda. However, several other sources have stated that Iraqi females, including teenage girls, were sexually assaulted while being detained at Abu Ghraib and other US military detention facilities across Iraq. American journalist Tara McKelvey, writing for the magazine The American Prospect, interviewed an Iraqi sheik in the fall of 2004 about this issue and he told her that \"he had seen a young girl, 15 years old, with internal bleeding. She had been raped over and over again by the soldiers, and she could no longer talk. He is a deeply religious man. But that night, he shouted at Allah. ‘How is it possible that you are there and these things are happening?!' he said.”\n\nAmnesty International claimed that British soldiers had killed innocent civilians who were no threat, had kicked a prisoner to death and that the British military did not investigate the abuses appropriately.\n\nDeath in U.S. custody of chemistry professor Mohammed Munim al-Izmerly. An autopsy concluded death was caused by a sudden hit to the back of his head and that the cause of death was blunt trauma.\n\nThe Pentagon confirms a report in the New York Times that CIA chief George Tenet was allowed by U.S. Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld to have an Iraqi prisoner secretly detained at Camp Cropper in November, preventing the International Committee of the Red Cross from monitoring their treatment, a possible violation of the Geneva Conventions.\n\nJune 29: Oregon national guardsmen intervene in the beating of bound prisoners on the grounds of the Iraqi Interior Ministry; are told to back off and let the newly \"sovereign\" Iraqis run their own affairs.\n\nThe International Red Cross reports that more than 100 children were kept in six different prisons of the coalition. Witnesses say US forces also abused children and youths. Soldier Samuel Provance from Abu Ghraib reported the harassment of a 15- to 16-year-old girl in her cell as well as a 16-year-old boy who was driven through the cold after he had been showered and who was then covered with mud. Allegations have been made that children have been subjected to torture and rape. This has been used to make detained parents talk in cases where other interrogation methods have failed. Seymour Hersh told a San Francisco audience: \"what happened is that those women who were arrested with young boys, children, in cases that have been [video] recorded, the boys were sodomized, with the cameras rolling... the worst above all of them is the soundtrack of the boys shrieking.\" An unpublished UNICEF report is said to include statements about children that were arrested in Basra and Kerbela and routinely detained in Umm Kasr. The children are said to be without contact to their families and cannot expect a trial.\n\nDeath penalty \"reluctantly\" reinstated in Iraq \"until stability [is] restored.\"\n\nReports of mock executions by the US Marines in Iraq have surfaced in December 2004, as the ACLU published internal documents of the Naval Criminal Investigative Service (NCIS) obtained through the Freedom of Information Act. The documents were written seven weeks after the publication of the photographs which triggered the Abu Ghraib prisoner abuse scandal.\n\nSeveral torture cases were also reported, notably torture by electricity, beatings, and sprayings of prisoners with fire extinguishers.\n\nOn 21 December, the ACLU released further documents documenting tortures. Notably, in a case of shooting of suspects without warning, Army commanders are reported to have interfered with the investigation. Procedures of autopsy of detainees who died in unclear circumstances have been canceled by battalion and group commands. Other cases include \n\nOn 24 January 2005, the ACLU accused the Pentagon of deliberately closing investigations over Human Rights violations and torture cases before they were over.\n\nHuman Rights Watch accused Iraqi security forces of using torture and improper treatments on prisoners. Arbitrary arrests and long periods of isolation are now common. Human Right Watch interviewed 90 prisoners, among which 72 said they had been tortured during interrogation. Sarah Leah Whitson, HRW director, said that the Iraqi provisional government was not holding to its promise to stand by Human Rights: \n\"A new Iraqi government requires more than a change of leadership - it requires a change of attitude about basic human dignity\" . \n\n\"During the first three days there was continuous torture. I was beaten with an aluminum rod and with cables. ? Then I was told to sign a statement with my hands tied behind my back, so I didn't even see the paper and I don't know what I signed.\" \n\nAmong bad treatments were such elements as beatings with cables, electric shocks, including on genitals, being tied and blindfolded for days, cells so crowded that it is only possible to stand, arbitrary detention, refusal of trials, access to lawyers or contacts with families. These treatments were inflicted to insurgents and criminals alike.\n\nA Pentagon order is mentioned in a military report filed on May 16, 2005 ordering U.S. personnel to turn a blind eye to Iraqi torture by refraining from investigating instances of apparent detainee abuse by Iraqi personnel, unless the investigation is first approved by U.S. headquarters: \"Provided the initial report confirms US forces were not involved in the detainee abuse, no further investigation will be conducted unless directed by HHQ.\" Such approval was rarely granted.\n\nIn a report published by Human Rights Watch in September 2005, U.S. Troops are accused to routinely torture prisoners in Iraq. Two sergeants and a captain describe e.g. the breaking of a detainee’s leg, and applying chemical substances to detainees’ skin and eyes. Capt. Ian Fishback of the 82nd Airborne who made persistent efforts over 17 months to raise concerns about detainee abuse with his chain of command was consistently told to ignore abuses and to “consider your career.” When he made an appointment with Senate staff members of Senators John McCain and John Warner, he says his commanding officer denied him a pass to leave his base.\n\n-173 detainees found in an Iraqi government bunker in Baghdad were found starved, beaten and tortured.\n\n-Colin Powell's former Chief of Staff, Colonel Lawrence Wilkerson, stated in an interview with Amy Goodman on November 22 that:\n\nThe Haditha killings occurred on November 19 in the town of Haditha, Iraq. A convoy of United States Marines was attacked with an improvised explosive device which killed Lance Corporal Miguel Terrazas. Up to twenty-four Iraqis were subsequently killed; it is alleged that they were non-combatant local residents who were massacred by Marines in the aftermath of the insurgent attack.\n\nJohn Pace, human rights chief for the United Nations Assistance Mission in Iraq (UNAMI), told Reuters that there were an estimated 14,000 people being held in prison in Iraq contrary to UN Resolution 1546, according to which the US government claims legal permission to occupy Iraq. In a December 5, 2005, interview, Pace said,\n\nAccording to the Iraqi Defense Ministry, Private First Class Thomas Tucker and Private First Class Kristian Menchaca were reportedly \"killed in a barbaric way,\" \"slaughtered,\" and tortured to death, and their bodies were so mutilated that DNA tests are being performed to help identify their remains. The alleged group has said it was a revenge for the rape and murder of an Iraqi girl who was dishonoured by soldiers of the same brigade.\n\nVideo of the killing of four Russian diplomats kidnapped in Iraq appear on the Internet. A group called the Mujahideen Shura Council released the hostage video.\n\nIn 2009, an additional 21 color photographs surfaced, showing prisoners in Afghanistan and Iraq being abused by their U.S. captors.\nThe American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) said, \"[T]he government had long argued that the abuse at Abu Ghraib was isolated and was an aberration. The new photos would show that the abuse was more widespread.\" President Barack Obama initially indicated he would not fight the release of the photographs, but \"reversed course in May and authorized an appeal to the high court.\" \"The Obama administration believe[d] giving the imminent grant of authority over the release of such pictures to the defense secretary would short-circuit a lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union under the Freedom of Information Act.\" On Oct 10, 2009 the US \"Congress [was] set to allow the Pentagon to keep new pictures ... from the public\"\n\nOn February 3, 2010, David A. Larson, an elected official in California who has a relationship with government contract personnel, made disclosures to the U.S. Department of Defense (DOD), Office of the Inspector General (OIG) alleging that under the Bush Administration, prisoners detained at Abu Ghraib, Guantanamo Bay, and undisclosed \"black sites\" were being used as involuntary research subjects for human biomedical experimentation, behavior modification research, and drug-testosterone delivery in a manner similar to past CIA Project MKULTRA activities investigated in 1977 by Senators Kennedy and Inuoye. The allegation supports information contained in an International Red Cross report relative to the expanded role of CIA medical personnel in torture and interrogation.\n\nIn 2010, the last of the prisons were turned over to the Iraqi government to run. An Associated Press article said \n\nIn September 2010 Amnesty International warned in a report titled \"New Order, Same Abuses; Unlawful Detentions and Torture in Iraq\" that up to 30,000 prisoners, including many veterans of the US detention system, remain detained without rights in Iraq and are frequently tortured or abused. Furthermore, it describes a detention system that has not evolved since Saddam Hussein's regime, in which human rights abuses were endemic with arbitrary arrests and secret detention common and a lack of accountability throughout the security forces. Amnesty's Middle East and North Africa director, Malcolm Smart went on to say that \"Iraq's security forces have been responsible for systematically violating detainees' rights and they have been permitted. US authorities, whose own record on detainees' rights has been so poor, have now handed over thousands of people detained by US forces to face this catalogue of illegality, violence and abuse, abdicating any responsibility for their human rights.\"\n\nOn October 22, 2010 nearly 400,000 secret United States army field reports and war logs, detailing torture, summary executions and war crimes, were passed on to the British paper, the Guardian and several other international media organisations through the whistleblowing website WikiLeaks. Among others, the logs detail how US authorities failed to investigate hundreds of reports of abuse, torture, rape and even murder by Iraqi police and soldiers, whose conduct appears to be systematic and normally unpunished and that US troops abused prisoners for years even after the Abu Ghraib scandal. Both the UK and the US have condemned the unauthorised release of classified material, but did not question its accuracy.\n\nSeveral sets of investigations, both congressional via the Senate Armed Services Committee, military via courts-martial, and criminal for non-military contractors, were launched in response to the scandal.\n\nSeymour Hersh, who exposed the Abu Ghraib scandal, and reports in Newsweek, has taken the case even further. In 2003, Donald Rumsfeld instituted a policy that \"encouraged physical coercion and sexual humiliation of Iraqi prisoners in an effort to generate more intelligence about the growing insurgency in Iraq.\". This policy stemmed from an earlier policy taken toward al-Qaeda prisoners. A memo to the Bush White House from counsel Alberto Gonzales claimed that the new sort of war renders the Geneva Conventions' limitations on interrogating enemy prisoners \"obsolete\". The program was approved by the CIA, NSA, and the National Security Council. President George W. Bush was informed of it. The Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence Steven Cambone administered the operation. His deputy, William Boykin, instructed the head of operations at Camp X-ray Maj. Gen. Geoffrey Miller to do the same at Abu Ghraib. Miller told Brig. Gen. Janis Karpinski that the prison would now be dedicated to gathering intelligence. Douglas Feith and William Haynes were also involved in the operation.\n\nOn May 18, 2004, a military intelligence analyst named Samuel Provance came out to the press, stating \"There's definitely a cover-up\". Provance, who ran a computer network used by military intelligence in the prison and who had been ordered not to speak to the press, told ABC News \"Anything [the MPs] were to do legally or otherwise, they were to take those commands from the interrogators,\" and that the sexual humiliation began as a technique ordered by the investigators. He described several of the goings-on in the prison that he witnessed, such as the punching people in the neck hard enough to knock them unconscious after assuring them they weren't going to be hit, in order to catch them off guard. He also stated that Maj. Gen. George Fay, the Army's deputy chief of staff for intelligence, has shown little interest in investigating the interrogators and has gone only after the MPs, and that there is a culture of silence right now among those involved, who fear that if they say anything, the investigations will turn to them.\n\nOn May 19, 2004, a court martial hearing was held for Cpl. Charles A. Graner Jr., who has been accused of being the ringleader of the group employing torture at Abu Ghraib. In an unexpected move, all three key witnesses - Lt. Col. Steven L. Jordan, Capt. Donald J. Reese, and contractor Adel L. Nakhla - refused to testify. This is an almost unheard of action. Under court martial proceedings, one cannot refuse to testify unless they have a belief that they will be exposed to criminal charges for doing so. Consequently, it is likely that the investigative proceedings will be forced to move higher up the chain of command.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1574707", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1574707", "title": "Joe Hipp", "text": "Joe Hipp\n\nJoe \"The Boss\" Hipp (born December 7, 1962) is a retired professional Native American heavyweight boxer. A member of the Blackfeet Tribe, he became the first Native American to challenge for a world heavyweight boxing championship on August 19, 1995 when he fought WBA champion Bruce Seldon at the MGM Grand Garden Arena. In May 2009, he was inducted into the American Indian Athletic Hall of Fame.\n\nHipp began his professional career with a 4-round decision over Steve Cortez at the Lane County Fairgrounds in Eugene, Oregon on August 29, 1987. For his second fight 2 months later, Hipp travelled to Carson City, Nevada to face Utah native Veti Katoa. The fight was stopped by the ringside doctor after Hipp suffered a broken jaw in the third round.\n\nHipp rebounded successfully from the defeat by notching 3 consecutive first-round knockout victories before facing Katoa in a rematch at Gardnerville Park in Gardnerville, Nevada on July 2, 1988. Hipp dominated the action on the inside with his hard-hitting, banging style to take a 5-round unanimous decision.\n\nHipp then took a year-long hiatus from boxing before returning to face Andrew Matthews on the 4th of July of the following year. Outweighing his opponent by over 30 pounds, Hipp punched his way to a first-round stoppage. Exactly two weeks later, Hipp scored a unanimous four-round decision over up-and-coming contender Cleveland Woods in what Ring Magazine referred to as \"...the upset of the night\" on the card for that evening.\n\nHipp began another winning streak (including a brutal third-round knockout of Katoa in their third and final meeting) before facing Bert Cooper in Cooper's final bout prior to his fight with Evander Holyfield for the world title one month later. Cooper outslugged Hipp en route to a fifth-round stoppage by referee Joe Cortez.\n\nHipp again rebounded by winning 3 consecutive contests before facing Tommy Morrison on June 27, 1992 in Reno, Nevada. In a slugfest that saw Morrison break his jaw and one of his hands, Hipp lost by a 9th-round TKO, resulting in broken cheekbones for Hipp. After recovering from his injuries, Hipp fought once in 1993, earning a victory with a ten-round decision in a rematch with Kevin Ford.\n\nHipp began 1994 with a victory over Alex Garcia for the fringe NABF heavyweight title and finished the year with two more wins. He began the following year by continuing his winning ways with a third-round TKO of journeyman Phillip Brown. This win would lead to Hipp's most important bout, the fight that would land him in the history books as the first Native American to challenge for one of the four recognized heavyweight title belts.\n\nOn August 19, 1995 at the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas on the undercard of the infamous Mike Tyson v. Peter McNeeley fight (Tyson's first fight after being released from prison for rape), Hipp squared off against Bruce Seldon for the WBA Heavyweight championship. With Seldon well ahead on all scorecards, the fight was stopped in the tenth round by referee Richard Steele after Hipp experienced massive swelling and bleeding on his face.\n\nHipp's career was rather undistinguished afterwards. He fired off a series of victories over third-rate competition before being knocked out by hard-hitting journeyman Ross Puritty on June 15, 1997. Hipp had secured a comfortable lead on the scorecards before Puritty came out swinging for the tenth and final round of their bout. An exhausted Hipp was no match for Puritty in the last round and he suffered his first KO defeat. Hipp racked up three consecutive victories against nondescript competition after the Puritty fight, but then blew out his knee against Jeff Pegues in a fifth-round TKO loss on December 9, 1999. \n\nHe attempted a comeback four years later, but that came to an abrupt end in his second fight as he dropped a six-round decision to journeyman Billy Zumbrun on November 14, 2003.\n\nHipp, referred to as \"The Boss\" by his loyal fans, returned from another extended layoff to win a six-round decision over Ted Reiter on August 13, 2005, in what was his final fight.\n\nIn 2004, Rocky Mountain Community College and the Billings Writer's Voice sponsored a poetry reading held by various Native American groups in tribute to Hipp.\n\nIn December 2005, Hipp was a FEMA worker for the Hurricane Katrina disaster. Responding to the call, he joined his fellow Blackfeet members who were called upon due to their experience in wildfires and search and rescue missions.\n\nBy 2007 Hipp was working for his former manager Ray Frye at a Seattle area sweeping company. He also co-owned a small construction company.\n"}
{"id": "16831", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16831", "title": "Kick", "text": "Kick\n\nA kick is a physical strike using the leg, in unison usually with an area of the knee or lower using the foot, heel, tibia, ball of the foot, blade of the foot, toes or knee (the latter is also known as a knee strike). This type of attack is used frequently by hooved animals as well as humans in the context of stand-up fighting. Kicks play a significant role in many forms of martial arts, such as savate, taekwondo, MMA, sikaran, karate, Pankration, Kung Fu, Vovinam, kickboxing, Muay Thai, Yaw-Yan, capoeira, silat, and kalaripayattu.\n\nKicking is also prominent from its use in many sports, especially those called football. The best known of these sports is association football, also known as soccer.\n\nThe English verb to kick appears only in the late 14th century, apparently as a loan from Old Norse, originally in the sense of a hooved animal delivering strikes with his hind legs; the oldest use is Biblical.\n\nKicks as an act of human aggression have likely existed worldwide since prehistory. However, high kicks, aiming above the waist or to the head appear to have originated from Asian martial arts. Such kicks were introduced to the west in the 19th century with early hybrid martial arts inspired by Asian styles such as Bartitsu and Savate. Practice of high kicks became more universal in the second half of the 20th century with the more widespread development of hybrid styles such as kickboxing and eventually mixed martial arts.\n\nThe history of the high kick in Asian martial arts is difficult to trace. It appears to be prevalent in all traditional forms of Indochinese kickboxing, but these cannot be traced with any technical detail to pre-modern times. For example, Muay Boran or \"ancient boxing\" in Thailand was developed under Rama V (r. 1868-1910). While it is known that earlier forms of \"boxing\" existed during the Ayutthaya Kingdom, the details regarding these techniques are unclear. Some stances that look like low kicks, but not high kicks, are visible in the Shaolin temple frescoes, dated to the 17th century. The \"Mahabharata\" (4.13), an Indian epic compiled at some point before the 5th century AD, describes an unarmed hand-to-hand battle, including the sentence \"and they gave each other violent kicks\" (without providing any further detail).\n\nAs the human leg is longer and stronger than the arm, kicks are generally used to keep an opponent at a distance, surprise him or her with their range, and inflict substantial damage. On the other hand, stance is very important in any combat system, and any attempt to deliver a kick will necessarily compromise one's stability of stance. The application of kicks is thus a question of the tradeoff between the power that can be delivered vs. the cost incurred to balance. Since combat situations are fluid, understanding this tradeoff and making the appropriate decision to adjust to each moment is key.\n\nKicks are commonly directed against helpless or downed targets, while for more general self-defense applications, the consensus is that simple kicks aimed at vulnerable targets below the chest may be highly efficient, but should be executed with a degree of care. Self-defense experts, such as author and teacher Marc Macyoung, claim that kicks should be aimed no higher than the waist/stomach. Thus, the fighter should not compromise their balance while delivering a kick, and retract the leg properly to avoid grappling. It is often recommended to build and drill simple combinations that involve attacking different levels of an opponent. A common example would be distracting an opponent's focus via a fake jab, following up with a powerful attack at the opponent's legs and punching.\n\nFurther, since low kicks are inherently quicker and harder to see and dodge in general they are often emphasized in a street fight scenario.\n\nThe utility of high kicks (above chest level) has been debated.\n\nProponents have viewed that some high front snap kicks are effective for striking the face or throat, particularly against charging opponents, and flying kicks can be effective to scare off attackers. Martial arts systems that utilize high kicks also emphasize training of very efficient and technically perfected forms of kicks, include recovery techniques in the event of a miss or block, and will employ a wide repertoire of kicks adapted to specific situations.\n\nDetractors have asserted that the flying/jumping kicks performed in synthesis styles are primarily performed for conditioning or aesthetic reasons while the high kicks as practiced in sport martial arts are privileged due to specialized tournament rules, such as limiting the contest to stand-up fighting, or reducing the penalty resulting from a failed attempt at delivering a kick.\n\nAlthough kicks can result in an easy takedown for the opponent if they are caught or the resulting imbalance is exploited, kicks to all parts of the body are very present in mixed martial arts, with some fighters employing them sporadically, while others, like Lyoto Machida, Edson Barboza and Donald Cerrone rely heavily on their use and have multiple knockouts by kicks on their resumee.\n\nDelivering a front kick involves raising the knee and foot of the striking leg to the desired height and extending the leg to contact the target. The actual strike is usually delivered by the ball of the foot for a forward kick or the top of the toes for an upward kick. Taekwondo practitioners utilize both the heel and ball of the foot for striking. Various combat systems teach 'general' front kick using the heel or whole foot when footwear is on. Depending of fighter's tactical needs, a front kick may involve more or less body motion. Thrusting one's hips is a common method of increasing both reach and power of the kick. The front kick is typically executed with the upper body straight and balanced. Front kicks are typically aimed at targets below the chest: stomach, thighs, groin, knees or lower. Highly skilled martial artists are often capable of striking head-level targets with front kick.\n\nThis is the most commonly used kick in kickboxing due to its power and ease of use. In most styles, the instep is used to strike, though most Karate styles would allow the shin as official technique for a street fight. To execute, the attacker swings their leg sideways in a circular motion, kicking the opponent's side with the front of the leg, usually with the instep, ball of the foot, toe, or shin. Also performable is a 360-degree kick in which the attacker performs a full circle with their leg, in which the striking surface is generally either the instep, shin or ball of the foot.\n\nThere are many variations of the roundhouse kick based on various chambering of the cocked leg (small, or full, or universal or no chambering) or various footwork possibilities (rear-leg, front-leg, hopping, switch, oblique, dropping, ground spin-back or full 360 spin-back). An important variation is the downward roundhouse kick, nicknamed the Brazilian Kick from recent K-1 use: A more pronounced twist of the hips allows for a downward end of the trajectory of the kick that is very deceiving.\n\nDue to its power, the roundhouse kick may also be performed at low level against targets, such as the knees, calf, or even thigh, since attacking leg muscles will often cripple an opponent's mobility.\n\nThe side kick refers to a kick that is delivered sideways in relation to the body of the person kicking. It is one of the most adaptable kicks, useful as both an offensive move and as a defensive counter to a blitzing opponent. There are two areas that are commonly used as impact points in sidekicks: the heel of the foot or the outer edge of the foot. The heel is more suited to hard targets such as the ribs, stomach, jaw, temple and chest. However, when executing a side kick with the heel, the toes should be pulled back so that they only make contact the heel and not with the whole foot. If a person hits with the arch or the ball of the foot, it can injure the foot or break an ankle. A standard sidekick is performed by first chambering the kicking leg diagonally across the body, then extending the leg in a linear fashion toward the target, while flexing the abdominals.\n\nAnother way of doing the side kick is to make it an end result of a faked roundhouse. This technique is considered antiquated, and used only after an opponent is persuaded to believe it is a roundhouse, and then led to believe that closing the distance is best for an upper body attack, which plays into the tactical position and relative requirement of this version of the side kick. In Korean, \"yeop chagi\". In Okinawan te fighting, it is sometimes called a \"dragon kick\". Some have called this side kick a \"twist kick\" due to its roundhouse like origins. This side kick begins as would a roundhouse kick however the practitioner allows the heel to move towards the center of the body. The kick is then directed outward from a cross-leg chamber so that the final destination of the kick is a target to the side, rather than one that is directly ahead.\n\nAlso referred to as a donkey kick, mule kick, or turning back kick. This kick is directed backwards, keeping the kicking leg close to the standing leg and using the heel as a striking surface. In wushu, this kick is called the \"half-moon\" kick but involves the slight arching of the back and a higher lift of the leg to give a larger curvature. It is often used to strike opponents by surprise when facing away from them.\n\nThese are often complicated variations of basic kicks, either with a different target or combined with another move, such as jumping.\n\nIn Japanese, \"kakato-geri\" or \"kakato-otoshi\"; in Korean, \"doki bal chagi\" or \"naeryeo chagi\" or \"chikka chagi\". In Chinese, \"pigua tui\" or \"xiapi tui\".\n\nAn axe kick, also known as a \"hammer kick\" or \"stretch kick\", is characterized by a straightened leg with the heel descending onto an opponent like the blade of an axe. It begins with one foot rising upward as in a crescent kick. The upward arc motion is stopped, and then the attacking foot is lowered so as to strike the target from above. The arc can be performed in either an inward (counter-clockwise) or outward (clockwise) fashion.\n\nA well-known proponent of the axe kick was Andy Hug, the Swiss Kyokushinkai Karateka who won the 1996 K-1 Grand Prix.\n\nThe butterfly kick is done by doing a large circular motion with both feet in succession, making the combatant airborne. There are many variations of this kick. The kick may look like a slanted aerial cartwheel, and at the same time, the body spins horizontally in a circle. It begins as a jump with one leg while kicking with the other, then move the kicking leg down and the jumping leg up into a kick, landing with the first kicking leg, all while spinning. This kick involves also the arching the back backwards when airborne to give a horizontal body with high angled legs to the horizontal. It may also resemble a jumping spin roundhouse kick (developed by James 'Two Screens' Perkins) into a spinning hook kick, all in one jump and one spin although the difference is that both legs should remain in the air at the same time for a considerable amount of time.\n\nFirst practiced in Chinese martial arts, the butterfly kick, or \"xuan zi\", is widely viewed as ineffective for actual combat. However, its original purpose was to evade an opponent's floor sweep and flip to the antagonist's exposed side or it may be used as a double aerial kick to an opponent standing off to the side. It is now widely used in demonstrative wushu forms (taolu) as a symbol of difficulty. Also note the similarity in execution when compared to an ice skating maneuver known as a flying camel spin (aka: Button Camel).\n\nThis strike is a low roundhouse kick that hits the backside of the calf with the shin. While a Calf Kick sacrifices range in comparison to a standard low roundhouse kick to the thigh, the Calf Kick can't be checked with a knee or grabbed with an arm making it a safer kick for a striker in MMA matches vs opponents capable of checking low kicks or grapplers looking for takedown opportunities.\n\nIn Japanese, \"mikazuki Geri\"; in Korean, \"bandal chagi\" (반달 차기).\n\nThe crescent kick, also referred to as a 'swing' kick, has some similarities to a hook kick, and is sometimes practised as an off-target front snap kick. The leg is bent like the front kick, but the knee is pointed at a target to the left or right of the true target. The energy from the snap is then redirected, whipping the leg into an arc and hitting the target from the side. This is useful for getting inside defenses and striking the side of the head or for knocking down hands to follow up with a close attack. In many styles of T'ai chi ch'uan and Kalaripayattu, crescent kicks are taught as tripping techniques. When training for crescent kicks, it is common to keep the knee extended to increase the difficulty. This also increases the momentum of the foot and can generate more force, though it takes longer to build up the speed.\n\nThe inward/inner/inside crescent hits with the inside edge of the foot. Its arch is clockwise for the left leg and counter-clockwise for the right leg. Force is generated by both legs' hip adduction. The inward variant has also been called a \"hangetsu geri\" (Half moon kick) in karate and is employed to \"wipe\" an opponents hand off of one's wrist. It can quickly be followed up by a low side-blade kick to the knee of the offender.\n\nThe outward/outer/outside crescent hits with the 'blade', the outside edge of the foot. Its path is counter-clockwise for the left leg and clockwise for the right leg, and force is generated by both legs' hip abduction. This is similar to a rising side kick, only with the kicking leg's hip flexed so that the line of force travels parallel to the ground from front to side rather than straight up, beginning and ending at the side.\n\nIn Korean, \"huryeo chagi\" (후려 차기) or \"golcho chagi\".\n\nThe hook kick strikes with the heel from the side (or flat of the foot in sparring). It is executed similar to a side kick. However, the kick is intentionally aimed slightly off target in the direction of the kicking foot's toes. At full extension, the knee is bent and the foot snapped to the side, impacting the target with the heel. In Taekwondo it is often used at the resulting miss of a short slide side kick to the head, but is considered a very high level technique in said circumstance. Practitioners of jeet kune do frequently use the term \"heel hook kick\" or \"sweep kick\". It is known as Gancho in Capoeira.\n\nThere are many variations of the hook kick, generally based on different footworks: rear- or front-leg, oblique or half-pivot, dropping, spin-back and more. The hook kick can be delivered with a near-straight leg at impact, or with a hooked finish (Kake in Japanese Karate) where the leg bends before impact to catch the target from behind. An important variation is the downward hook kick, delivered as a regular or a spin-back kick, in which the end of the trajectory is diagonally downwards for a surprise effect or following an evading opponent.\n\nThe hook kick is mainly used to strike the jaw area of an opponent, but is also highly effective in the temple region.\n\nIn Japanese, ; in Korean, \"bandae dollyo chagi\" (반대 돌려 차기), \"dwit hu ryo chagi\", \"nakkio mom dollyo chagi\" or \"parryo chagi\".\n\nThis kick is also known as a \"heel kick\", \"reverse turning kick\", \"reverse round kick\", \"spinning hook kick\", \"spin kick\", or \"wheel kick\". A low reverse roundhouse is also known as a \"Sweep Kick\". This kick traditionally uses the heel to strike with. The kicking leg comes from around the kicker's back and remains straight, unlike a reverse hooking kick. See above for more on hook kicks. Variations exist for low, middle and high height. Spinning and leaping variations of the kick are also popular, and are often showcased in film and television media. Edson Barboza executed the first wheel kick for a knockout in the UFC at UFC 142:Aldo vs. Mendes. He knocked out Terry Etim 3:23 into the third round of their fight. Mickie James uses this move calling it \"Mick-Kick\"\n\nA different kick that is similarly named also exists. It is literally a roundhouse kick performed by turning as if for a \"back straight kick\" and executing a roundhouse kick. It is known as a \"Reverse Roundhouse Kick\" because the kicker turns in the opposite, or \"reverse\", direction before the kick is executed. This kick strikes with the ball of the foot for power or the top of the foot for range. The kick was exhibited by Bruce Lee on numerous occasions in his films Enter the Dragon, Fist of Fury and The Big Boss. Bill Wallace was also a great user of this kick, as seen in his fight with Bill Briggs, where he KO'd his opponent with the clocked 60 mph kick. The Jump Spin Hook Kick was popularized in the mid-eighties by Steven Ho in open martial art competitions.\n\nIn Olympic format (sport) taekwondo, this technique is performed using the balls of the feet, and in a manner similar to a back thrust, rather than the circular technique adopted in other styles/Martial Arts.\n\nA flying kick, in martial arts, is a general description of kicks that involve a running start, jump, then a kick in mid-air. Compared to a regular kick, the user is able to achieve greater momentum from the run at the start. Flying kicks are not to be mistaken for jumping kicks, which are similar maneuvers. A jumping kick is very similar to a flying kick, except that it lacks the running start and the user simply jumps and kicks from a stationary position. Flying kicks are often derived from the basic kicks. Some of the more commonly known flying kicks are the: flying side kick, flying back kick and the flying roundhouse kick, as well as the flying reverse roundhouse kick. Flying kicks are commonly practiced in Taekwondo, Karate, Wushu, and Muay Thai for fitness, exhibitions and competition. It is known as \"tobi geri\" in Japanese martial arts, and \"twyo chagi\" in Taekwondo.\n\nSeveral kicks may be called a scissor kick, involving swinging out the legs to kick multiple targets or using the legs to take down an opponent.\n\nThe popularized version of a scissor kick is, while lying down, or jumping, the kicker brings both legs to both sides of the opponent's legs or to their body and head, then brings both in as a take down (as the name states, leg motions are like that of a pair of scissors).\n\nThe scissor kick in Taekwondo is called \"kawi chagi\". In Capoeira it is called tesoura (scissors).\n\nScissor kicks and other variants are also commonly applied in Vovinam.\n\nA spinning heel kick is where the artist turns his/her body 360 degrees before landing the heel or the ball of his/her foot on the target. It is found in Muay Thai and is known in Capoeira as armada.\n\nThe vertical kick involves bringing the knee forward and across the chest, then swinging the hip while extending the kicking leg outward, striking with the outside (\"sword\") edge of the foot. It can deliver a considerable amount of power. This is called a \"yoko geri keage\" in karate.\n\nIn Taekwondo, the vertical kick is called \"sewo chagi\", and can be performed as either an inward (\"anuro\") or outward (\"bakuro\") kick.\n\nIn Japanese karate, the term \"ren geri\" is used for several kicks performed in succession. Old karate did not promote the use of the legs for weapons as much as modern karate does, seeing them as being too open for countering. However, in modern sport karate (non-traditional) competitions, the ability to use multiple kicks without setting the foot down has become a viable option, not only for effectiveness but also for stylish aesthetics.\n\nIn Taekwon-Do, three types of multiple kick are distinguished:\n\nDouble kick (\"i-jung chagi\") - two kicks of the same type executed in succession by the same foot in the same direction.\n\nConsecutive kick (\"yonsok chagi\") - two or more kicks executed in succession by the same foot but in different directions, or with different attacking tools.\n\nCombination kick (\"honhap chagi\") - two or more kicks executed in succession by both feet.\n\nOne such Multiple Kick commonly seen in Taekwon-Do, is a slightly complex Side Kick where a High Side Kick is followed by a Low Side Kick which is in turn followed by a more powerful Side Kick. This combination is done rapidly and is meant not for multiple targets but for a single one. The Multiple Kick usually targets the face, thigh, and chest, but in turn can be a multiple chest attack which is useful for knocking the breath out of an attacker. The Multiple Kick is usually done in the \"second\" style described in the Side Kick article which \"involves shooting the leg forward as in a front kick and then pivoting and turning so\" to actually deliver a side kick. That style \"has far less power but is much faster and more deceptive\", which is what the Multiple Kick was designed for. The Multiple Kick, unlike some Side Kicks or \"side blade kicks\", never uses the outer edge of the foot; it is intended solely for the heel to be used as the impact point. Depending on the strength and skill of the attacker and the attacked, the combination can be highly effective or highly ineffective when compared to more pragmatic attacks. In some encounters with highly trained and conditioned fighters, multiple side-kicks have seen disastrous results against the abs of their targets.\n\nThe Showtime kick gained notability after being used by mixed martial artist Anthony Pettis, during his fight gainst Benson Henderson on December 16, at WEC 53 for the WEC Lightweight Championship.In the fifth round Pettis ran up the cage, jumped off the cage, then landed a switch kick while airborne. Sports reporters later named this the Showtime Kick.. The kick was also used by mixed martial artists: Zabit Magomedsharipov and others. The kick was featured in the movie Here Comes the Boom.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "401936", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=401936", "title": "Leo Frank", "text": "Leo Frank\n\nLeo Max Frank (April 17, 1884August 17, 1915) was an American factory superintendent who was convicted in 1913 of the murder of a 13-year-old employee, Mary Phagan, in Atlanta, Georgia. His trial, conviction, and appeals attracted national attention. His lynching two years later, in response to the commutation of his sentence, became the focus of social, regional, political, and racial concerns, particularly regarding antisemitism. Today, the consensus of researchers on the subject holds that Frank was wrongly convicted.\n\nBorn to a Jewish-American family in Texas, Frank was raised in New York and earned a degree in mechanical engineering from Cornell University before moving to Atlanta in 1908. Marrying in 1910, he involved himself with the city's Jewish community and was elected president of the Atlanta chapter of the B'nai B'rith, a Jewish fraternal organization, in 1912. Although antisemitism was not locally common, there were growing concerns regarding child labor at factories owned by members of the Jewish community. One of these children was Mary Phagan, who worked at the National Pencil Company where Frank was director. The girl was strangled on April 26, 1913, and found dead in the factory's cellar the next morning. Two notes, made to look as if she had written them, were found beside her body. Based on the mention of a \"night witch\", they implicated the night watchman, Newt Lee. Over the course of their investigations, the police arrested several men, including Lee, Frank, and Jim Conley, a janitor at the factory.\n\nOn May 24, 1913, Frank was indicted on a charge of murder and the case opened at Fulton County Superior Court on July 28. The prosecution relied heavily on the testimony of Conley, who described himself as an accomplice to the murder, and who the defense at the trial argued was in fact the perpetrator of the murder. A guilty verdict was announced on August 25. Frank and his lawyers made a series of unsuccessful appeals; their final appeal to the Supreme Court of the United States failed in April 1915. Considering arguments from both sides as well as evidence not available at trial, Governor John M. Slaton commuted Frank's sentence from capital punishment to life imprisonment.\n\nThe case attracted national press and many reporters deemed the conviction a travesty. Within Georgia, this outside criticism fueled antisemitism and hatred toward Frank. On August 16, 1915, he was kidnapped from prison by a group of armed men who were infuriated by the governor's decision, and lynched at Marietta, Mary Phagan's hometown, the next morning. The new governor vowed to punish the lynchers, who included prominent Marietta citizens, but nobody was charged. In 1986, Frank was posthumously pardoned by the Georgia State Board of Pardons and Paroles, although not officially absolved of the crime. Most researchers today agree that Conley was likely the murderer. The case inspired various media productions, including movies, plays, a TV miniseries, and books.\n\nIn the early 20th century, Atlanta, Georgia's capital city, underwent significant economic and social change. To serve a growing economy based on manufacturing and commerce, many people left the countryside to relocate in Atlanta, often in primitive housing. Employment conditions in the city included child labor, a 66-hour work week, low wages, and unregulated and unsafe work sites. Men from the traditional and paternalistic rural society felt it degrading that their womenfolk were forced into the city to work in factories. Mixed gender workplaces were seen as places for potential moral corruption.\n\nDuring this same period, the Atlanta Jewish elite was unusually assimilated into the political, economic, and social fabric of the city. One of their strategies was to select rabbis and leaders who would put forth a positive image for their people and help reduce tensions between Jews and Gentiles. In Atlanta, a prominent leader from 1895 to 1946 was David Marx. To improve the image of Jews in their community, Marx's Reform temple adopted Americanized appearances. However, a conflict arose between the established German Jews of the city who generally were able to economically thrive while getting along with their neighbors, and newly arrived Russian Jews. Rabbi Marx went so far as to describe the new arrivals as \"barbaric and ignorant\" and feared that these backward arrivals would awaken anti-Semitism \"where it had been notably absent\". \"Rabbi Marx bitterly blamed the eastern Jews for creating a climate that made Frank's arrest and conviction possible\". Despite their success, many Jews recognized themselves as different from the Gentile majority and were uncomfortable with their image. Despite his acceptance by the Gentile community, Marx believed that \"in isolated instances there is no prejudice entertained for the individual Jew, but there exists wide-spread and deep seated prejudice against Jews as an entire people.\"\n\nAn example of the type of tension that Rabbi Marx feared occurred in April 1913. At a conference involving the child labor problem, many proposed solutions were presented that covered the entire political spectrum. Author Steve Oney writes, \"At the radical end of the spectrum could be heard alarming notions inspired by the fact that many of Atlanta's factories ... were Jewish owned.\" Historian Leonard Dinnerstein summarized Atlanta's situation in 1913 as follows:\n\nLeo Max Frank was born in Cuero, Texas on April 17, 1884 to Rudolph Frank and Rachel \"Rae\" Jacobs. The family moved to Brooklyn in 1884 when Leo was three months old. He attended New York City public schools and graduated from Pratt Institute in 1902. He then attended Cornell University, where he studied mechanical engineering. After graduating in 1906, he worked briefly as a draftsman and as a testing engineer.\n\nAt the invitation of his uncle Moses Frank, Leo traveled to Atlanta for two weeks in late October 1907 to meet a delegation of investors for a position with the National Pencil Company, a manufacturing plant in which Moses was a major shareholder. Frank accepted the position, and traveled to Germany to study pencil manufacturing at the Eberhard Faber pencil factory. After a nine-month apprenticeship, Frank returned to the United States and began working at the National Pencil Company in August 1908. Frank became superintendent of the factory the following month, earning $180 per month plus a portion of the factory's profits.\n\nFrank was introduced to Lucille Selig shortly after he arrived in Atlanta. She came from a prominent, upper-middle class Jewish family of industrialists who, two generations earlier, had founded the first synagogue in Atlanta. Though she was less devout in her Jewish faith than Frank, they married in November 1910. Frank described his married life as happy.\n\nIn 1912, Frank was elected president of the Atlanta chapter of the B'nai B'rith, a Jewish fraternal organization. The Jewish community in Atlanta was the largest in the Southern United States, and the Franks belonged to a cultured and philanthropic social environment whose leisure pursuits included opera and bridge. Although the Southern United States was not specifically known for its antisemitism, Frank's northern culture and Jewish faith added to the sense that he was different.\n\nMary Phagan was born on June 1, 1899, into an established Georgia family of tenant farmers. Her father died before she was born. Shortly after Mary's birth, her mother, Frances Phagan, moved the family back to their hometown of Marietta, Georgia. During or after 1907, they again relocated to East Point, Georgia, in southwest Atlanta, where Frances opened a boarding house. Mary Phagan left school at age 10 to work part-time in a textile mill. In 1912, after her mother married John William Coleman, the family moved into the city of Atlanta. That spring, Phagan took a job with the National Pencil Company, where she earned ten cents an hour operating a knurling machine that inserted rubber erasers into the metal tips of pencils, and worked 55 hours per week. She worked on the second floor of the factory in the metal room in a section called the tipping department, which was across the hallway from Leo Frank's office.\n\nOn April 21, 1913, Phagan was laid off due to a shortage of brass sheet metal. Around noon on April 26, she went to the factory to claim her pay of $1.20. The next day, shortly before 3:00 a.m., the factory's night watchman, Newt Lee, went to the factory basement to use the toilet. After leaving the toilet, Lee discovered Phagan's body in the rear of the basement near an incinerator and called the police. Her dress was up around her waist and a strip from her petticoat had been torn off and wrapped around her neck. Her face was blackened and scratched, and her head was bruised and battered. A strip of wrapping cord was tied into a loop around her neck, buried deep, showing that she had been strangled. Her underwear was still around her hips, but stained with blood and torn open. Her skin was covered with ashes and dirt from the floor, initially making it appear to responding officers that she and her assailant had struggled in the basement.\n\nA service ramp at the rear of the basement led to a sliding door that opened into an alley; the police found the door had been tampered with so it could be opened without unlocking it. Later examination found bloody fingerprints on the door, as well as a metal pipe that had been used as a crowbar. Some evidence at the crime scene was improperly handled by the police investigators: a trail in the dirt (from the elevator shaft) along which police believed Phagan had been dragged was trampled; the footprints were never identified.\n\nTwo notes were found in a pile of rubbish by Phagan's head, and became known as the \"murder notes\". One said: \"he said he wood love me land down play like the night witch did it but that long tall black negro did boy his slef.\" The other said, \"mam that negro hire down here did this i went to make water and he push me down that hole a long tall negro black that hoo it wase long sleam tall negro i write while play with me.\" The phrase \"night witch\" was thought to mean \"night watch[man]\"; when the notes were initially read aloud, night watchman Newt Lee is reported by police to have said, \"Boss, it looks like they are trying to lay it on me\" (or words to that effect). Lee was arrested that morning based on these notes and his apparent familiarity with the bodyhe stated that the girl was white when the police, because of the filth and darkness in the basement, initially thought she was black. A trail leading back to the elevator suggested to police that the body had been moved by Lee.\n\nIn addition to Lee, the police arrested a friend of Phagan's for the crime. Gradually, the police became convinced that these were not the culprits. By Monday, the police had theorized that the murder occurred on the second floor (the same as Frank's office) based on hair found on a lathe and what appeared to be blood on the ground of the second floor.\n\nBoth Newt Lee, after the discovery of Phagan's body, and the police, just after 4 a.m., had unsuccessfully tried to telephone Frank early on Sunday, April 27. The police contacted him later that morning and he agreed to accompany them to the factory. When the police arrived after 7 a.m. without telling the specifics of what happened at the factory, Frank seemed extremely nervous, trembling, and pale; his voice was hoarse, and he was rubbing his hands and asking questions before the police could answer. Frank said he was not familiar with the name Mary Phagan and would need to check his payroll book. The detectives took Frank to the morgue to see Phagan's body and then to the factory, where Frank viewed the crime scene and walked the police through the entire building. Frank returned home about 10:45 a.m. At this point, Frank was not considered a suspect.\n\nOn Monday, April 28, Frank, accompanied by his attorney, Luther Rosser, gave a written deposition to the police that provided a brief timeline of his activities on Saturday. He said Phagan was in his office between 12:05 and 12:10 p.m., that Lee had arrived at 4 p.m. but was asked to return later, and that Frank had a confrontation with ex-employee James Gantt at 6 p.m. as Frank was leaving and Lee arriving. Frank explained that Lee's time card for Sunday morning had several gaps (Lee was supposed to punch in every half-hour) that Frank had missed when he discussed the time card with police on Sunday. At Rosser's insistence, Frank exposed his body to demonstrate that he had no cuts or injuries and the police found no blood on the suit that Frank said he had worn on Saturday. The police found no blood stains on the laundry at Frank's house.\n\nFrank then met with his assistant, N. V. Darley, and Harry Scott of the Pinkerton National Detective Agency, whom Frank hired to help investigate the case. The Pinkerton detectives investigated many leads, ranging from crime scene evidence to allegations of sexual misconduct on the part of Frank. The Pinkertons were required to submit duplicates of all evidence to the police, including any that hurt Frank's case. Scott's collaboration with police detective John Black, who from the outset believed in Frank's guilt, resulted in a conflict of interest.\n\nOn Tuesday, April 29, Black went to Lee's residence at 11 a.m. looking for evidence, and found a blood-smeared shirt at the bottom of a burn barrel. The blood was smeared high up on the armpits and the shirt smelled unused, suggesting to the police that it was a plant. The detectives, suspicious of Frank due to his nervous behavior throughout his interviews, believed that Frank had arranged the plant.\n\nFrank was subsequently arrested around 11:30 a.m. at the factory. Steve Oney states that \"no single development had persuaded ... [the police] that Leo Frank had murdered Mary Phagan. Instead, to the cumulative weight of Sunday's suspicions and Monday's misgivings had been added several last factors that tipped the scale against the superintendent.\" These factors were the dropped charges against two suspects; the rejection of rumors that Phagan had been seen on the streets, making Frank the last person to admit seeing Phagan; Frank's meeting with the Pinkertons; and a \"shifting view of Newt Lee's role in the affair.\" The police were convinced Lee was involved as Frank's accomplice and that Frank was trying to implicate him. To bolster their case, the police staged a confrontation between Lee and Frank while both were still in custody; there were conflicting accounts of this meeting, but the police interpreted it as further implicating Frank.\n\nOn Wednesday, April 30, a coroner's inquest was held. Frank testified about his activities on Saturday and other witnesses produced corroboration. A young man said that Phagan had complained to him about Frank. Several former employees spoke of Frank flirting with other women; one said she was actually propositioned. The detectives admitted that \"they so far had obtained no conclusive evidence or clues in the baffling mystery ...\". Lee and Frank were both ordered to be detained.\n\nIn May, the detective William J. Burns traveled to Atlanta to offer further assistance in the case. However, his Burns Agency withdrew from the case later that month. C. W. Tobie, a detective from the Chicago affiliate who was assigned to the case, said that the agency \"came down here to investigate a murder case, not to engage in petty politic[s].\" The agency quickly became disillusioned with the many societal implications of the case, most notably the notion that Frank was able to evade prosecution due to his being a rich Jew, buying off the police and paying for private detectives.\n\nThe prosecution based much of its case on the testimony of Jim Conley, the factory's janitor, who is believed by many historians to be the actual murderer. The police had arrested Conley on May 1 after he had been seen washing red stains out of a blue work shirt; detectives examined it for blood, but determined that it was rust as Conley had claimed, and returned it. Conley was still in police custody two weeks later when he gave his first formal statement. He said that, on the day of the murder, he had been visiting saloons, shooting dice, and drinking. His story was called into question when a witness told detectives that \"a black negro ... dressed in dark blue clothing and hat\" had been seen in the lobby of the factory on the day of the murder. Further investigation determined that Conley could read and write, and there were similarities in his spelling with that found on the murder notes. On May 24, he admitted he had written the notes, swearing that Frank had called him to his office the day before the murder and told him to write them. After testing Conley again on his spellinghe spelled \"night watchman\" as \"night witch\"the police were convinced he had written the notes. They were skeptical about the rest of his story, not only because it implied premeditation by Frank, but also because it suggested that Frank had confessed to Conley and involved him.\n\nIn a new affidavit (his second affidavit and third statement), Conley admitted he had lied about his Friday meeting with Frank. He said he had met Frank on the street on Saturday, and was told to follow him to the factory. Frank told him to hide in a wardrobe to avoid being seen by two women who were visiting Frank in his office. He said Frank dictated the murder notes for him to write, gave him cigarettes, then told him to leave the factory. Afterward, Conley said he went out drinking and saw a movie. He said he did not learn of the murder until he went to work on Monday.\n\nThe police were satisfied with the new story, and both \"The Atlanta Journal\" and \"The Atlanta Georgian\" gave the story front-page coverage. Three officials of the pencil company were not convinced and said so to the \"Journal\". They contended that Conley had followed another employee into the building, intending to rob her, but found Phagan was an easier target. The police placed little credence in the officials' theory, but had no explanation for the failure to locate Phagan's purse that other witnesses had testified she carried that day. They were also concerned that Conley did not mention that he was aware a crime had been committed when he wrote the notes, suggesting Frank had simply dictated the notes to Conley arbitrarily. To resolve their doubts, the police attempted on May 28 to arrange a confrontation between Frank and Conley. Frank exercised his right not to meet without his attorney, who was out of town. The police were quoted in \"The Atlanta Constitution\" saying that this refusal was an indication of Frank's guilt, and the meeting never took place.\n\nOn May 29, Conley was interviewed for four hours. His new affidavit said that Frank told him, \"he had picked up a girl back there and let her fall and that her head hit against something.\" Conley said he and Frank took the body to the basement via the elevator, then returned to Frank's office where the murder notes were dictated. Conley then hid in the wardrobe after the two had returned to the office. He said Frank gave him $200, but took it back, saying, \"Let me have that and I will make it all right with you Monday if I live and nothing happens.\" Conley's affidavit concluded, \"The reason I have not told this before is I thought Mr. Frank would get out and help me out and I decided to tell the whole truth about this matter.\" At trial, Conley changed his story concerning the $200. He said Frank decided to withhold the money until Conley had burned Phagan's body in the basement furnace.\n\nThe \"Georgian\" hired William Manning Smith to represent Conley for $40. Smith was known for specializing in representing black clients, and had successfully defended a black man against an accusation of rape by a white woman. He had also taken an elderly black woman's civil case as far as the Georgia Supreme Court. Although Smith believed Conley had told the truth in his final affidavit, he became concerned that Conley was giving long jailhouse interviews with crowds of reporters. Smith was also anxious about reporters from the Hearst papers, who had taken Frank's side. He arranged for Conley to be moved to a different jail, and severed his own relationship with the \"Georgian\".\n\nOn February 24, 1914, Conley was sentenced to a year in jail for being an accomplice after the fact to the murder of Mary Phagan.\n\n\"The Atlanta Constitution\" broke the story of the murder and was soon in competition with \"The Atlanta Journal\" and \"The Atlanta Georgian\". Forty extra editions came out the day Phagan's murder was reported. \"The Atlanta Georgian\" published a doctored morgue photo of Phagan, in which her head was shown spliced onto the body of another girl. The papers offered a total of $1,800 in reward money for information leading to the apprehension of the murderer. Soon after the murder, Atlanta's mayor criticized the police for their steady release of information to the public. The governor, noting the reaction of the public to press sensationalism soon after Lee's and Frank's arrests, organized ten militia companies in case they were needed to repulse mob action against the prisoners. Coverage of the case in the local press continued nearly unabated throughout the investigation, trial, and subsequent appeal process.\n\nNewspaper reports throughout the period combined real evidence, unsubstantiated rumors, and journalistic speculation. Dinnerstein wrote, \"Characterized by innuendo, misrepresentation, and distortion, the yellow journalism account of Mary Phagan's death aroused an anxious city, and within a few days, a shocked state.\" Different segments of the population focused on different aspects. Atlanta's working class saw Frank as \"a defiler of young girls\", while the German-Jewish community saw him as \"an exemplary man and loyal husband.\" Albert Lindemann, author of \"The Jew Accused\", opined that \"ordinary people\" may have had difficulty evaluating the often unreliable information and in \"suspend[ing] judgment over a long period of time\" while the case developed. As the press shaped public opinion, much of the public's attention was directed at the police and the prosecution, whom they expected to bring Phagan's killer to justice. The prosecutor, Hugh Dorsey, had recently lost two high-profile murder cases; one state newspaper wrote that \"another defeat, and in a case where the feeling was so intense, would have been, in all likelihood, the end of Mr. Dorsey, as solicitor.\"\n\nOn May 23, 1913, a grand jury convened to hear evidence for an indictment against Leo Frank for the murder of Mary Phagan. The prosecutor, Hugh Dorsey, presented only enough information to obtain the indictment, assuring the jury that additional information would be provided during the trial. The next day, May 24, the jury voted for an indictment. Meanwhile, Frank's legal team suggested to the media that Jim Conley was the actual killer, and put pressure on another grand jury to indict him. The jury foreman, on his own authority, convened the jury on July 21; on Dorsey's advice, they decided not to indict Conley.\n\nOn July 28, the trial began at the Fulton County Superior Court (old city hall building). The judge, Leonard S. Roan, had been serving as a judge in Georgia since 1900. The prosecution team was led by Dorsey and included William Smith (Conley's attorney and Dorsey's jury consultant). Frank was represented by a team of eight lawyersincluding jury selection specialistsled by Luther Rosser, Reuben Arnold, and Herbert Haas. In addition to the hundreds of spectators inside, a large crowd gathered outside to watch the trial through the windows. The defense, in their legal appeals, would later cite the crowds as factors in intimidation of the witnesses and jury.\n\nBoth legal teams, in planning their trial strategy, considered the implications of trying a white man based on the testimony of a black man in front of an early 1900s Georgia jury. Jeffrey Melnick, author of \"Black-Jewish Relations on Trial: Leo Frank and Jim Conley in the New South\", writes that the defense tried to picture Conley as \"a new kind of African Americananarchic, degraded, and dangerous.\" Dorsey, however, pictured Conley as \"a familiar type\" of \"old negro\", like a minstrel or plantation worker. Dorsey's strategy played on prejudices of the white 1900s Georgia observers, i.e., that a black man could not have been intelligent enough to make up a complicated story. The prosecution argued that Conley's statement explaining the immediate aftermath of the murder was true, that Frank was the murderer, and that Frank had dictated the murder notes to Conley in an effort to pin the crime on Newt Lee, the night watchman.\n\nThe prosecution presented witnesses who testified to bloodstains and strands of hair found on the lathe, to support their theory that the murder occurred on the factory's second floor in the machine room near Frank's office. The defense denied that the murder occurred on the second floor. Both sides contested the significance of physical evidence that suggested the place of the murder. Material found around Phagan's neck was shown to be present throughout the factory. The prosecution interpreted the scene in the basement to support Conley's storythat the body was carried there by elevatorwhile the defense suggested that the drag marks on the floor indicated that Conley carried the body down a ladder and then dragged it across the floor. The defense argued that Conley was the murderer and that Newt Lee helped Conley write the two murder notes. The defense brought many witnesses to support Frank's account of his movements, which indicated he did not have enough time to commit the crime.\n\nThe defense, to support their theory that Conley murdered Phagan in a robbery, focused on Phagan's missing purse. Conley claimed in court that he saw Frank place the purse in his office safe, although he denied having seen the purse before the trial. Another witness testified that, on the Monday after the murder, the safe was open and there was no purse in it. The significance of Phagan's torn pay envelope was disputed by both sides.\n\nThe prosecution focused on Frank's alleged sexual behavior. They alleged that Frank, with Conley's assistance, regularly met with women in his office for sexual relations. On the day of the murder, Conley said he saw Phagan go upstairs, from where he heard a scream coming shortly after. He then said he dozed off; when he woke up, Frank called him upstairs and showed him Phagan's body, admitting that he had hurt her. Conley repeated statements from his affidavits that he and Frank took Phagan's body to the basement via the elevator, before returning in the elevator to the office where Frank dictated the murder notes.\n\nConley was cross-examined by the defense for 16 hours over three days, but the defense failed to break his story. The defense then moved to have Conley's entire testimony concerning the alleged rendezvous stricken from the record. Judge Roan noted that an early objection might have been upheld, but since the jury could not forget what it had heard, he allowed the evidence to stand. The prosecution, to support Frank's alleged expectation of a visit from Phagan, produced Helen Ferguson, a factory worker who first informed Phagan's parents of her death. Ferguson testified that she had tried to get Phagan's pay on Friday from Frank, but was told that Phagan would have to come in person. Both the person behind the pay window and the woman behind Ferguson in the pay line disputed this version of events, testifying that in accordance with his normal practice, Frank did not disburse pay that day.\n\nThe defense called a number of factory girls, who testified that they had never seen Frank flirting with or touching the girls, and that they considered him to be of good character. In the prosecution's rebuttal, Dorsey called \"a steady parade of former factory workers\" to ask them the question, \"Do you know Mr. Frank's character for lasciviousness?\" The answers were usually \"bad\".\n\nThe prosecution realized early on that issues relating to time would be an essential part of its case. At trial, each side presented witnesses to support their version of the timeline for the hours before and after the murder. The starting point was the time of death; the prosecution, relying on the analysis of stomach contents by their expert witness, argued that Phagan died between 12:00 and 12:15 p.m. A prosecution witness, Monteen Stover, said she had gone into the office to get her paycheck, waiting there from 12:05 to 12:10, and did not see Frank in his office. The prosecution's theory was that Stover did not see Frank because he was at that time murdering Phagan. Stover's account did not match Frank's initial account that he had not left the office between noon and 12:30. Other testimony indicated that Phagan exited the trolley (or tram) between 12:07 and 12:10. From the stop it was a two- to four-minute walk, suggesting that Stover arrived first, making her testimony and its implications irrelevant: Frank could not be killing Phagan because at the time she had not yet arrived.\n\nLemmie Quinn, foreman of the metal room, testified that he spoke briefly with Frank in his office at 12:20. Frank had not mentioned Quinn when the police first interviewed him about his whereabouts at noontime on April 26. Frank had said at the coroner's inquest that Quinn arrived less than ten minutes after Phagan had left his office, and during the murder trial said Quinn arrived hardly five minutes after Phagan left. According to Conley and several experts called by the defense, it would have taken at least thirty minutes to murder Phagan, take the body to the basement, return to the office, and write the murder notes. By the defense's calculations, Frank's time was fully accounted for from 11:30 a.m. to 1:30 p.m., except for eighteen minutes between 12:02 and 12:20. Hattie Hall, a stenographer, said at trial that Frank had specifically requested that she come in that Saturday and that Frank had been working in his office from 11:00 to nearly noon. The prosecution labeled Quinn's testimony as \"a fraud\" and reminded the jury that early in the police investigation Frank had not mentioned Quinn.\n\nNewt Lee, the night watchman, arrived at work shortly before 4:00 and Frank, who was normally calm, came bustling out of his office. Frank told Lee that he had not yet finished his own work and asked Lee to return at 6:00. Newt Lee noticed that Frank was very agitated and asked if he could sleep in the packing room, but Frank was insistent that Lee leave the building and told Lee to go out and have a good time in town before coming back.\nWhen Lee returned at 6:00, James Gantt had also arrived. Lee told police that Gantt, a former employee who had been fired by Frank after $2 was found missing from the cash box, wanted to look for two pairs of shoes he had left at the factory. Frank allowed Gantt in, although Lee said that Frank appeared to be upset by Gantt's appearance. Frank arrived home at 6:25; at 7:00, he called Lee to determine if everything had gone all right with Gantt.\n\nDuring the trial, the prosecution alleged bribery and witness tampering attempts by the Frank legal team. Meanwhile, the defense requested a mistrial because it believed the jurors had been intimidated by the people inside and outside the courtroom, but the motion was denied. Fearing for the safety of Frank and his lawyers in case of an acquittal, Roan and the defense agreed that neither Frank nor his defense attorneys would be present when the verdict was read. On August 25, 1913, after less than four hours of deliberation, the jury reached a unanimous guilty verdict convicting Frank of murder.\n\nThe \"Constitution\" described the scene as Dorsey emerged from the steps of city hall: \"The solicitor reached no farther than the sidewalk. While mounted men rode like Cossacks through the human swarm, three muscular men slung Mr. Dorsey on their shoulders and passed him over the heads of the crowd across the street.\" Albert Lindemann suggests \"the powerless experienced a moment of exhilaration in seeing the defeat and humiliation of a normally powerful and inaccessible oppressor.\"\n\nOn August 26, the day after the guilty verdict was reached by the jury, Judge Roan brought counsel into private chambers and sentenced Leo Frank to death by hanging with the date set to October 10. The defense team issued a public protest, alleging that public opinion unconsciously influenced the jury to the prejudice of Frank. This argument was carried forward throughout the appeal process.\n\nUnder Georgia law at the time, appeals of death penalty cases had to be based on errors of law, not a reevaluation of the evidence presented at trial. The appeals process began with a reconsideration by the original trial judge. The defense presented a written appeal alleging 115 procedural problems. These included claims of jury prejudice, intimidation of the jury by the crowds outside the courthouse, the admission of Conley's testimony concerning Frank's alleged sexual perversions and activities, and the return of a verdict based on an improper weighing of the evidence. Both sides called forth witnesses involving the charges of prejudice and intimidation; while the defense relied on non-involved witness testimony, the prosecution found support from the testimony of the jurors themselves. On October 31, 1913, Judge Roan denied the motion, adding, \"I have thought about this case more than any other I have ever tried. With all the thought I have put on this case, I am not thoroughly convinced that Frank is guilty or innocent. But I do not have to be convinced. The jury was convinced. There is no room to doubt that.\"\n\nThe next step, a hearing before the Georgia Supreme Court, was held on December 15. In addition to presenting the existing written record, each side was granted two hours for oral arguments. In addition to the old arguments, the defense focused on the reservations expressed by Judge Roan at the reconsideration hearing, citing six cases where new trials had been granted after the trial judge expressed misgivings about the jury verdict. The prosecution countered with arguments that the evidence convicting Frank was substantial and that listing Judge Roan's doubts in the defense's bill of exceptions was not the proper vehicle for \"carry[ing] the views of the judge.\" On February 17, 1914, in a 142-page decision, the court denied Frank a new trial by a 4–2 vote. The majority dismissed the allegations of bias by the jurors, saying the power of determining this rested strictly with the trial judge except when an \"abuse of discretion\" was proved. It also ruled that spectator influence could only be the basis of a new trial if ruled so by the trial judge. Conley's testimony on Frank's alleged sexual conduct was found to be admissible because, even though it suggested Frank had committed other crimes for which he was not charged, it made Conley's statements more credible and helped to explain Frank's motivation for committing the crime according to the majority. On Judge Roan's stated reservations, the court ruled that these did not trump his legal decision to deny a motion for a new trial. The dissenting justices restricted their opinion to Conley's testimony, which they declared should not have been allowed to stand: \"It is perfectly clear to us that evidence of prior bad acts of lasciviousness committed by the defendant ... did not tend to prove a preexisting design, system, plan, or scheme, directed toward making an assault upon the deceased or killing her to prevent its disclosure.\" They concluded that the evidence prejudiced Frank in the jurors' eyes and denied him a fair trial.\n\nThe last hearing exhausted Frank's ordinary state appeal rights. On March 7, 1914, Frank's execution was set for April 17 of that year. The defense continued to investigate the case and filed an extraordinary motion before the Georgia Supreme Court. This appeal, which would be held before a single justice, Ben Hill, was restricted to raising facts not available at the original trial. The application for appeal resulted in a stay of execution and the hearing opened on April 23, 1914. The defense successfully obtained a number of affidavits from witnesses repudiating their testimony. A state biologist said in a newspaper interview that his microscopic examination of the hair on the lathe shortly after the murder did not match Phagan's. At the same time that the various repudiations were leaked to the newspapers, the state was busy seeking repudiations of the new affidavits. An analysis of the murder notes, which had only been addressed in any detail in the closing arguments, suggested Conley composed them in the basement rather than writing what Frank told him to write in his office. Prison letters written by Conley to Annie Maude Carter were discovered; the defense then argued that these, along with Carter's testimony, implicated Conley was the actual murderer.\n\nThe defense also raised a federal constitutional issue on whether Frank's absence from the court when the verdict was announced \"constituted deprivation of the due process of law\". Different attorneys were brought in to argue this point since Rosser and Arnold had acquiesced in Frank's absence. There was a debate between Rosser and Arnold on whether it should be raised at this time since its significance might be lost with all of the other evidence being presented. Louis Marshall, President of the American Jewish Committee and constitutional lawyer, urged them to raise the point, and the decision was made that it should be made clear that if the extraordinary motion was rejected they intended to appeal through the federal court system and there would be an impression of injustice in the trial. For almost every issue presented by the defense, the state had a response: most of the repudiations were either retracted or disavowed by the witnesses; the question of whether outdated order pads used to write the murder notes had been in the basement before the murder was disputed; the integrity of the defense's investigators were questioned and intimidation and bribery were charged; and the significance of Conley's letters to Annie Carter was disputed. The defense, in its rebuttal, tried to bolster the testimony relating to the murder notes and the Carter letters. (These issues were reexamined later when the governor considered commuting Frank's sentence.) During the defense's closing argument, the issue of the repudiations was put to rest by Judge Hill's ruling that the court could only consider the revocation of testimony if the subject were tried and found guilty of perjury. The judge denied Frank a new trial and the full court upheld the decision on November 14, 1914. The full court also said that the due process issue should have been raised earlier, characterizing what it considered a belated effort as \"trifling with the court\".\n\nThe next step for the Frank team was to appeal the issue through the federal system. The original request for a writ of error on the absence of Frank from the jury's announcement of the verdict was first denied by Justice Joseph Rucker Lamar and then Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. Both denied the request because they agreed with the Georgia court that the issue was raised too late. The full Supreme Court then heard arguments, but denied the motion without issuing a written decision. However, Holmes said, \"I very seriously doubt if the petitioner ... has had due process of law ... because of the trial taking place in the presence of a hostile demonstration and seemingly dangerous crowd, thought by the presiding Judge to be ready for violence unless a verdict of guilty was rendered.\" Holmes' statement, as well as public indignation over this latest rejection by the courts, encouraged Frank's team to attempt a \"habeas corpus\" motion, arguing that the threat of crowd violence had forced Frank to be absent from the verdict hearing and constituted a violation of due process. Justice Lamar heard the motion and agreed that the full Supreme Court should hear the appeal.\n\nOn April 19, 1915, the Supreme Court denied the appeal by a 7–2 vote in the case \"Frank v. Mangum\". Part of the decision repeated the message of the last decision: that Frank failed \"to raise the objection in due season when fully cognizant of the fact.\" Holmes and Charles Evans Hughes dissented, with Holmes writing, \"It is our duty to declare lynch law as little valid when practiced by a regularly drawn jury as when administered by one elected by a mob intent on death.\"\n\nOn April 22, 1915, an application for a commutation of Frank's death sentence was submitted to a three-person Prison Commission in Georgia; it was rejected on June 9 by a vote of 2–1. The dissenter indicated that he felt it was wrong to execute a man \"on the testimony of an accomplice, when the circumstances of the crime tend to fix the guilt upon the accomplice.\" The application then passed to Governor John Slaton. Slaton had been elected in 1912 and his term would end four days after Frank's scheduled execution. In 1913, before Phagan's murder, Slaton agreed to merge his law firm with that of Luther Rosser, who became Frank's lead attorney (Slaton was not directly involved in the original trial). After the commutation, popular Georgia politician Tom Watson attacked Slaton, often focusing on his partnership with Rosser as a conflict of interest.\n\nSlaton opened hearings on June 12. In addition to receiving presentations from both sides with new arguments and evidence, Slaton visited the crime scene and reviewed over 10,000 pages of documents. This included various letters, including one written by Judge Roan shortly before he died asking Slaton to correct his mistake. Slaton also received more than 1,000 death threats. During the hearing, former Governor Joseph Brown warned Slaton, \"In all frankness, if Your Excellency wishes to invoke lynch law in Georgia and destroy trial by jury, the way to do it is by retrying this case and reversing all the courts.\" According to Tom Watson's biographer, C. Vann Woodward, \"While the hearings of the petition to commute were in progress Watson sent a friend to the governor with the promise that if Slaton allowed Frank to hang, Watson would be his 'friend', which would result in his 'becoming United States senator and the master of Georgia politics for twenty years to come.'\"\n\nSlaton produced a 29-page report. In the first part, he criticized outsiders who were unfamiliar with the evidence, especially the press in the North. He defended the trial court's decision, which he felt was sufficient for a guilty verdict. He summarized points of the state's case against Frank that \"any reasonable person\" would accept and said of Conley that \"It is hard to conceive that any man's power of fabrication of minute details could reach that which Conley showed, unless it be the truth.\" After having made these points, Slaton's narrative changed course and asked the rhetorical question, \"Did Conley speak the truth?\" Leonard Dinnerstein wrote, \"Slaton based his opinions primarily upon the inconsistencies he had discovered in the narrative of Jim Conley.\" Two factors stood out to Slaton: the transporting of the body to the basement and the murder notes.\n\nDuring the initial investigation, police had noted undisturbed human excrement in the elevator shaft, which Conley said he had left there before the murder. Use of the elevator on the Monday after the murder crushed the excrement, which Slaton concluded was an indication that the elevator could not have been used as described by Conley, casting doubt on his testimony.\nDuring the commutation hearing, Slaton asked Dorsey to address this issue. Dorsey said that the elevator did not always go all the way to the bottom and could be stopped anywhere. Frank's attorney rebutted this by quoting Conley, who said that the elevator stops when it hits the bottom. Slaton interviewed others and conducted his own tests on his visit to the factory, concluding that every time the elevator made the trip to the basement it touched the bottom. Slaton said, \"If the elevator was not used by Conley and Frank in taking the body to the basement, then the explanation of Conley cannot be accepted.\"\n\nThe murder notes had been analyzed before at the extraordinary motion hearing. Handwriting expert Albert S. Osborn reviewed the previous evidence at the commutation hearing and commented, for the first time, that the notes were written in the third person rather than the first person. He said that the first person would have been more logical since they were intended to be the final statements of a dying Phagan. He argued this was the type of error that Conley would have made, rather than Frank, as Conley was a sweeper and not a Cornell-educated manager like Frank.\n\nConley's former attorney, William Smith, had become convinced that his client had committed the murder. Smith produced a 100-page analysis of the notes for the defense. He analyzed \"speech and writing patterns\" and \"spelling, grammar, repetition of adjectives, [and] favorite verb forms\". He concluded, \"In this article I show clearly that Conley did not tell the truth about those notes.\" Slaton compared the murder notes, Conley's letters to Annie Maude Carter, and his trial testimony. Throughout these documents, he found similar use of the words \"like\", \"play\", \"lay\", \"love\", and \"hisself\". He also found double adjectives such as \"long tall negro\", \"tall, slim build heavy man\", and \"good long wide piece of cord in his hands\".\n\nSlaton was also convinced that the murder notes were written in the basement, not in Frank's office. Slaton accepted the defense's argument that the notes were written on dated order pads signed by a former employee that were only kept in the basement. Slaton wrote that the employee signed an affidavit stating that, when he left the company in 1912, \"he personally packed up all of the duplicate orders ... and sent them down to the basement to be burned. This evidence was never passed upon by the jury and developed since the trial.\"\n\nSlaton's narrative touched on other aspects of the evidence and testimony that suggested reasonable doubt. For example, he accepted the defense's argument that charges by Conley of perversion were based on someone coaching him that Jews were circumcised. He accepted the defense's interpretation of the timeline; citing the evidence produced at trialincluding the possibility that Stover did not see Frank because she did not proceed further than the outer officehe wrote: \"Therefore, Monteen Stover must have arrived before Mary Phagan, and while Monteen Stover was in the room it hardly seems possible under the evidence, that Mary Phagan was at that time being murdered.\" Slaton also said that Phagan's head wound must have bled profusely, yet there was no blood found on the lathe, the ground nearby, in the elevator, or the steps leading downstairs. He also said that Phagan's nostrils and mouth were filled with dirt and sawdust which could only have come from the basement.\n\nSlaton also commented on Conley's story (that Conley was watching out for the arrival of a lady for Frank on the day of the murder):\n\nOn Monday, June 21, 1915, Slaton released the order to commute Frank's murder conviction to life imprisonment. Slaton's legal rationale was that there was sufficient new evidence not available at the original trial to justify Frank's actions. He wrote:\nThe commutation was headline news. Atlanta Mayor Jimmy Woodward remarked that \"The larger part of the population believes Frank guilty and that the commutation was a mistake.\" In response, Slaton invited the press to his home that afternoon, telling them:\n\nHe also told reporters that he was certain that Conley was the actual murderer. Slaton privately told friends that he would have issued a full pardon, if not for his belief that Frank would soon be able to prove his own innocence.\n\nThe public was outraged. A mob threatened to attack the governor at his home. A detachment of the Georgia National Guard, along with county policemen and a group of Slaton's friends who were sworn in as deputies, dispersed the mob. Slaton had been a popular governor, but he and his wife left Georgia immediately thereafter.\n\nFor Frank's protection, he was taken to the Milledgeville State Penitentiary in the middle of the night before the commutation was announced. The penitentiary was \"strongly garrisoned and newly bristling with arms\" and separated from Marietta by of mostly unpaved road. However, on July 17, \"The New York Times\" reported that fellow inmate William Creen tried to kill Frank by slashing his throat with a butcher knife, severing his jugular vein. The attacker told the authorities he \"wanted to keep the other inmates safe from mob violence, Frank's presence was a disgrace to the prison, and he was sure he would be pardoned if he killed Frank.\"\n\nThe sensationalism in the press that started before the trial continued throughout the trial, the appeals process, the commutation decision, and beyond. At the time, local papers were the dominant source of information, but they were not entirely anti-Frank. The \"Constitution\" alone assumed Frank's guilt, while both the \"Georgian\" and the \"Journal\" would later comment about the public hysteria in Atlanta during the trial, each suggesting the need to reexamine the evidence against the defendant. On March 14, 1914, while the extraordinary motion hearing was pending, the \"Journal\" called for a new trial, saying that to execute Frank based on the atmosphere both within and outside the courtroom would \"amount to judicial murder.\" Other newspapers in the state followed suit and many ministers spoke from the pulpit supporting a new trial. L. O. Bricker, the pastor of the church attended by Phagan's family, said that based on \"the awful tension of public feeling, it was next to impossible for a jury of our fellow human beings to have granted him a fair, fearless and impartial trial.\"\n\nOn October 12, 1913, the \"New York Sun\" became the first major northern paper to give a detailed account of the Frank trial. In discussing the charges of antisemitism in the trial, it described Atlanta as more liberal on the subject than any other southern cities. It went on to say that antisemitism did arise during the trial as Atlantans reacted to statements attributed to Frank's Jewish supporters, who dismissed Phagan as \"nothing but a factory girl\". The paper said, \"The anti-Semitic feeling was the natural result of the belief that the Jews had banded to free Frank, innocent or guilty. The supposed solidarity of the Jews for Frank, even if he was guilty, caused a Gentile solidarity against him.\" On November 8, 1913, the executive committee of the American Jewish Committee, headed by Louis Marshall, addressed the Frank case. They did so following Judge Roan's reconsideration motion and motivated by the issues raised in the \"Sun\". They chose not to take a public stance as a committee, instead deciding to raise funds individually to influence public opinion in favor of Frank.\n\nAlbert Lasker, a wealthy advertising magnate, responded to these calls to help Frank. Lasker contributed personal funds and arranged a public relations effort in support of Frank. In Atlanta, during the time of the extraordinary motion, Lasker coordinated Frank's meetings with the press and coined the slogan \"The Truth Is on the March\" to characterize the efforts of Frank's defense team. He persuaded prominent figures such as Thomas Edison, Henry Ford, and Jane Addams to make statements supporting Frank. During the commutation hearing, Vice President Thomas R. Marshall weighed in, as did many leading magazine and newspaper editors, including Herbert Croly, editor of the \"New Republic\"; C.P.J. Mooney, editor of the \"Chicago Tribune\"; Mark Sullivan, editor of \"Collier's\"; R. E. Stafford, editor of the \"Daily Oklahoman\"; and D. D. Moore, editor of the \"New Orleans Times-Picayune\". Adolph Ochs, publisher of \"The New York Times\", became involved about the same time as Lasker, organizing a prolonged campaign advocating for a new trial for Frank. Both Ochs and Lasker attempted to heed Louis Marshall's warnings about antagonizing the \"sensitiveness of the southern people and engender the feeling that the north is criticizing the courts and the people of Georgia.\" Dinnerstein writes that these attempts failed, \"because many Georgians interpreted every item favorable to Frank as a hostile act.\"\n\nTom Watson, editor of the \"Jeffersonian\", had remained publicly silent during Frank's trial. Among Watson's political enemies was Senator Hoke Smith, former owner of \"The Atlanta Journal\", which was still considered to be Smith's political instrument. When the \"Journal\" called for a reevaluation of the evidence against Frank, Watson, in the March 19, 1914 edition of his magazine, attacked Smith for trying \"to bring the courts into disrepute, drag down the judges to the level of criminals, and destroy the confidence of the people in the orderly process of the law.\" Watson also questioned whether Frank expected \"extraordinary favors and immunities because of his race\" and questioned the wisdom of Jews to \"risk the good name ... of the whole race\" to save \"the decadent offshoot of a great people.\" Subsequent articles concentrated on the Frank case and became more and more impassioned in their attacks. C. Vann Woodward writes that Watson \"pulled all the stops: Southern chivalry, sectional animus, race prejudice, class consciousness, agrarian resentment, state pride.\"\n\nWhen describing the public reaction to Frank, historians mention the class and ethnic tensions in play while acknowledging the complexity of the case and the difficulty in gauging the importance of his Jewishness, class, and northern background. Historian John Higham writes that \"economic resentment, frustrated progressivism, and race consciousness combined to produce a classic case of lynch law. ... Hatred of organized wealth reaching into Georgia from outside became a hatred of Jewish wealth.\" Historian Nancy MacLean writes that some historians have argued that this was an American Dreyfus affair, which she said \"[could] be explained only in light of the social tensions unleashed by the growth of industry and cities in the turn-of-the-century South. These circumstances made a Jewish employer a more fitting scapegoat for disgruntled whites than the other leading suspect in the case, a black worker.\" Albert Lindemann said that Frank on trial found himself \"in a position of much latent tension and symbolism.\" Stating that it is impossible to determine the extent to which antisemitism affected his image, he concluded that \"[Frank was seen as] a representative of Yankee capitalism in a southern city, with row upon row of southern women, often the daughters and wives of ruined farmers, 'at his mercy'a rich, punctilious, northern Jew lording it over vulnerable and impoverished working women.\"\n\nThe June 21, 1915 commutation provoked Tom Watson into advocating Frank's lynching. He wrote in \"The Jeffersonian\" and \"Watson's Magazine\": \"This country has nothing to fear from its rural communities. Lynch law is a good sign; it shows that a sense of justice lives among the people.\" A group of prominent men organized themselves into the \"Knights of Mary Phagan\" and openly planned to kidnap Frank from prison. They consisted of 28 men with various skills: an electrician was to cut the prison wires, car mechanics were to keep the cars running, and there was a locksmith, a telephone man, a medic, a hangman, and a lay preacher. The ringleaders were well known locally but were not named publicly until June 2000, when a local librarian posted a list on the Web based on information compiled by Mary Phagan's great-niece, Mary Phagan Kean (b. 1953). The list included Joseph Mackey Brown, former governor of Georgia; Eugene Herbert Clay, former mayor of Marietta and later president of the Georgia Senate; E. P. Dobbs, mayor of Marietta at the time; Moultrie McKinney Sessions, lawyer and banker; part of the Marietta delegation at Governor Slaton's clemency hearing; several current and former Cobb County sheriffs; and other individuals of various professions.\n\nOn the afternoon of August 16, the eight cars of the lynch mob left Marietta separately for Milledgeville. They arrived at the prison at around 10:00 p.m., and the electrician cut the telephone wires, members of the group drained the gas from the prison's automobiles, handcuffed the warden, seized Frank, and drove away. The trip took about seven hours at a top speed of through small towns on back roads. Lookouts in the towns telephoned ahead to the next town as soon as they saw the line of cars pass by. A site at Frey's Gin, two miles (3 km) east of Marietta, had been prepared, complete with a rope and table supplied by former Sheriff William Frey. \"The New York Times\" reported Frank was handcuffed, his legs tied at the ankles, and that he was hanged from a branch of a tree at around 7:00 a.m., facing the direction of the house where Phagan had lived.\n\n\"The Atlanta Journal\" wrote that a crowd of men, women, and children arrived on foot, in cars, and on horses, and that souvenir hunters cut away parts of his shirt sleeves. According to \"The New York Times\", one of the onlookers, Robert E. Lee Howellrelated to Clark Howell, editor of \"The Atlanta Constitution\"wanted to have the body cut into pieces and burned, and began to run around, screaming, whipping up the mob. Judge Newt Morris tried to restore order, and asked for a vote on whether the body should be returned to the parents intact; only Howell disagreed. When the body was cut down, Howell started stamping on Frank's face and chest; Morris quickly placed the body in a basket, and he and his driver John Stephens Wood drove it out of Marietta.\n\nIn Atlanta, thousands besieged the undertaker's parlor, demanding to see the body; after they began throwing bricks, they were allowed to file past the corpse. Frank's body was then transported by rail on Southern Railway's train No. 36 from Atlanta to New York and buried in the Mount Carmel Cemetery in Glendale, Queens, New York on August 20, 1915. \"The New York Times\" wrote that the vast majority of Cobb County believed he had received his \"just deserts\", and that the lynch mob had simply stepped in to uphold the law after Governor Slaton arbitrarily set it aside. A Cobb County grand jury was convened to indict the lynchers; although they were well known locally, none were identified. Nat Harris, the newly elected governor who succeeded Slaton, promised to punish the mob, issuing a $1,500 state reward for information. Despite this, Charles Willis Thompson of \"The New York Times\" said that the citizens of Marietta \"would die rather than reveal their knowledge or even their suspicion [of the identities of the lynchers]\", and the local \"Macon Telegraph\" said, \"Doubtless they can be apprehendeddoubtful they will.\"\n\nSeveral photographs were taken of the lynching, which were published and sold as postcards in local stores for 25 cents each; also sold were pieces of the rope, Frank's nightshirt, and branches from the tree. According to Elaine Marie Alphin, author of \"An Unspeakable Crime: The Prosecution and Persecution of Leo Frank\", they were selling so fast that the police announced that sellers would require a city license. In the postcards, members of the lynch mob or crowd can be seen posing in front of the body, one of them holding a portable camera. Historian Amy Louise Wood writes that local newspapers did not publish the photographs because it would have been too controversial, given that the lynch mob can be clearly seen and that the lynching was being condemned around the country. The \"Columbia State\", which opposed the lynching, wrote: \"The heroic Marietta lynchers are too modest to give their photographs to the newspapers.\" Wood also writes that a news film of the lynching that included the photographs was released, although it focused on the crowds without showing Frank's body; its showing was prevented by censorship boards around the U.S., though Wood says there is no evidence that it was stopped in Atlanta.\n\nLeo Frank's case was mentioned by Adolf Kraus when he announced the creation of the Anti-Defamation League in October 1913. After Frank's lynching, around half of Georgia's 3,000 Jews left the state. According to author Steve Oney, \"What it did to Southern Jews can't be discounted ... It drove them into a state of denial about their Judaism. They became even more assimilated, anti-Israel, Episcopalian. The Temple did away with chupahs at weddingsanything that would draw attention.\" Many American Jews saw Frank as an American Alfred Dreyfus, like Frank a victim of antisemitic persecution.\n\nTwo weeks after the lynching, in the September 2, 1915 issue of \"The Jeffersonian\", Watson wrote, \"the voice of the people is the voice of God\", capitalizing on his sensational coverage of the controversial trial. In 1914, when Watson began reporting his anti-Frank message, \"The Jeffersonian's\" circulation had been 25,000; by September 2, 1915, its circulation was 87,000. On November 25, 1915, a group led by William Joseph Simmons burned a cross on top of Stone Mountain, inaugurating a revival of the Ku Klux Klan.\n\nThe consensus of researchers on the subject is that Frank was wrongly convicted. Jeffrey Melnick wrote, \"There is near unanimity around the idea that Frank was most certainly innocent of the crime of murdering Mary Phagan.\" Other historians and journalists have written that the trial was \"a miscarriage of justice\" and \"a gross injustice\", \"a mockery of justice\", that \"there can be no doubt, of course, that ... [Frank was] innocent\", that \"Leo Frank ... was unjustly and wrongly convicted of murder\", that he \"was falsely convicted\", and that \"the evidence against Frank was shaky, to say the least\". C. Vann Woodward, like many other authors, believed that Conley was the actual murderer and was \"implicated by evidence overwhelmingly more incriminating than any produced against Frank.\"\n\nCritics cite a number of problems with the conviction. Local newspaper coverage, even before Frank was officially charged, was deemed to be inaccurate and prejudicial. Some claimed that the prosecutor Hugh Dorsey was under pressure for a quick conviction because of recent unsolved murders and made a premature decision that Frank was guilty, a decision that his personal ambition would not allow him to reconsider. Later analysis of evidence, primarily by Governor Slaton and Conley's attorney William Smith, seemed to exculpate Frank while implicating Conley.\n\nWebsites supporting the view that Frank was guilty of murdering Phagan emerged around the centennial of the Phagan murder in 2013. The Anti-Defamation League issued a press release condemning what it called \"misleading websites\" from \"anti-Semites ... to promote anti-Jewish views\".\n\nIn 1982, Alonzo Mann, who had been Frank's office boy at the time of Phagan's murder, told \"The Tennessean\" that he had seen Jim Conley alone shortly after noon carrying Phagan's body through the lobby toward the ladder descending into the basement. Though Mann's testimony was not sufficient to settle the issue, it was the basis of an attempt by Charles Wittenstein, southern counsel for the Anti-Defamation League, and Dale Schwartz, an Atlanta lawyer, to obtain a posthumous pardon for Frank from the Georgia State Board of Pardons and Paroles. The board also reviewed the files from Slaton's commutation decision. It denied the pardon in 1983, hindered in its investigation by the lack of available records. It concluded that, \"After exhaustive review and many hours of deliberation, it is impossible to decide conclusively the guilt or innocence of Leo M. Frank. For the board to grant a pardon, the innocence of the subject must be shown conclusively.\" At the time, the lead editorial in \"The Atlanta Constitution\" began, \"Leo Frank has been lynched a second time.\"\n\nFrank supporters submitted a second application for pardon, asking the state only to recognize its culpability over his death. The board granted the pardon in 1986. It said:\n\nIn response to the pardon, an editorial by Fred Grimm in the \"Miami Herald\" said, \"A salve for one of the South's most hateful, festering memories, was finally applied.\"\n\nIn 2008, a state historical marker was erected by the Georgia Historical Society, the Jewish American Society for Historic Preservation, and Temple Kol Emeth, near the building at 1200 Roswell Road, Marietta where Frank was lynched. In 2015, the Georgia Historical Society, the Atlanta History Center, and the Jewish American Society for Historic Preservation dedicated a Georgia Historical Society marker honoring Governor John M. Slaton at the Atlanta History Center.\n\nDuring the trial, the Atlanta musician and millworker Fiddlin' John Carson wrote and performed a murder ballad entitled \"Little Mary Phagan\". During the mill strikes of 1914, Carson sang \"Little Mary Phagan\" to crowds from the Fulton County courthouse steps. His daughter, Moonshine Kate, later recorded the song. An unrecorded Carson song, \"Dear Old Oak in Georgia\", sentimentalizes the tree from which Leo Frank was hanged.\n\nThe Frank case has been the subject of several media adaptations. In 1921, African-American director Oscar Micheaux directed a silent race film entitled \"The Gunsaulus Mystery\", followed by \"Murder in Harlem\" in 1935. In 1937, Mervyn LeRoy directed \"They Won't Forget\", based on the Ward Greene novel \"Death in The Deep South\", which was in turn inspired by the Frank case. An episode of the 1964 TV series \"Profiles in Courage\" dramatized Governor John M. Slaton's decision to commute Frank's sentence. The episode starred Walter Matthau as Governor Slaton and Michael Constantine as Tom Watson. The 1988 TV miniseries \"The Murder of Mary Phagan\" was broadcast on NBC, starring Jack Lemmon as Gov.

On the 26th of November 1939 during World War II, while the captain of \"Pilsudski\" incorporated into the British Navy and converted into the ship transporting British and Polish soldiers was torpedoed by German U-boat, he, after inspecting the entire sinking ship that there were no sailors and soldiers left behind, and after rescuing sailors and soldiers from the ice-cold Northern Atlantic, he died of exhaustion. Stankiewicz's life was immortalized by Karol Olgierd Borchardt, whose series of books on Stankiewicz became a best-seller among Polish maritime books.\n\nStankiewicz was born in Mitau in Courland(now Jelgava in Latvia) to a Polish noble family with \"Grave\" coat of arms. The Stankiewicz Family lived there, after the return from imprisonment in Syberia for the involvement in the January Uprising of 1830 against the occupying Poland the Czar's Russia. He graduated from the Naval Cadet Corps in St. Petersburg and joined the Russian Imperial Navy. During World War I he was initially a navigation officer on board the Russian armoured cruiser \"Riurik\", the flagship of the Baltic Fleet. A successful officer, he was made Chief of Staff of the Baltic Fleet during the first battles in the Gulf of Riga, after which he also briefly served as a commanding officer of one of the Char's Navy battleships. \n\nDispatched by the Imperial court to the United States, in 1918 he became a naval attache in the Russian consulate in Pittsburgh. However, the following year he returned to Russia and joined the riverine flotilla in Siberia during the Russian Civil War. Arrested by the Cheka, he was imprisoned in Irkutsk and then in a prison camp in Krasnoyarsk. Following the Peace of Riga ending the Polish-Bolshevik War Stankiewicz was a subject of a prisoner of war exchange and was allowed to settle in Poland. Verified in the rank of lieutenant-commander (komandor podporucznik), Stankiewicz joined the newly formed Polish Navy and became a commander of the Navigation Department of the Naval School of Tczew, the first maritime school in Polish history. Soon afterwards he also started his career as a lecturer of navigation and astronomy at the Maritime Officers' School in Toruń. \n\nIn 1923 he returned to the high seas as one of the officers on board \"Lwów\", a barque serving as a school ship during her voyage to Brazil. The following year he became the commanding officer of that ship and held that post until 1926, when he left the Polish Navy and joined the merchant marine as a commander of numerous cargo ships and a ship pilot at the Maritime Authority in Gdynia. One of the most experienced captains in the Polish Merchant Marine, in 1931 he became the commanding officer of the prestigious, yet obsolete ocean liners SS \"Pułaski\" and SS \"Polonia\". About that time he also became a member of the team supervising the design and construction of a modern ocean liner, the MS \"Piłsudski\". \n\nWhen she was completed in 1935, Stankiewicz became her first commanding officer. The ship, being the most modern ship in the Polish merchant marine and among the most luxurious European ocean liners, made numerous voyages from Poland and Constanţa in Romania to Palestine, Brazil, Canada, United Kingdom and the United States. M/S \"Piłsudski\" commenced her last voyage as an ocean liner on a Gdynia – Copenhagen – Halifax – New York City route on August 11, 1939. However, she was caught on the high seas by the outbreak of the Polish Defensive War and World War II. She was then commandeered by the Polish Navy, renamed ORP \"Piłsudski\" and moved to a shipyard in northern England, where she was turned into an troopship. \n\nHowever, on November 26, 1939, during her maiden voyage in the new role, the Australia-bound ORP \"Piłsudski\" was struck by two explosions from German torpedoes and sank not far from Newcastle and Kingston-upon-Hull. Captain Mamert Stankiewicz was the last to leave the ship as he wanted to ensure that all of \"Piłsudski\"'s crew and were safe and no sailors and soldiers were left behind on the sinking ship. He rescued several sailors and soldiers and protected their safety on the lifeboats, while himself immersed in ice-cold Northern Atlantic. The sailors, soldiers, and Captain Stankiewicz were finally rescued by a British ship. He died of exhaustion and hypothermia. He was buried with full military honours in Hartlepool near Middlesbrough. He was posthumously awarded with the Virtuti Militari for bravery on the battle field with the highest Polish military decoration (being the only merchant fleet captain so decorated), and the British Distinguished Service Cross. In 1962 the general cargo vessel MS \"Kapitan M. Stankiewicz\" was named after him. \nHis elder brother Jan (known as 'the Bull'), was also a captain of Polish Merchant Marine. His younger brother Roman was the officer of Polish Navy, in the rank of commander, who led in \"Blyskawica\" the three Polish destroyers on their way from Poland to Britain in Aug. '39. Roman Stankiewicz died ecxactly a year after Mamert, on the 26th of Nov '40 in the Polish/French patrol vessel \"Medoc\".\n\nHe was married to Helena (de domo Jankowska). They had four daughters: Zofia (died in Syberia), Anna (primo voto Tomaszewska, who fought in the [Warsaw Uprising] in the Polish Home Army, formation \"Gustaw\"), Irena (primo voto Malecka, who fought and was wounded in the [Warsaw Uprising] in the Polish Home Army, formation \"Tower\"), Janina (killed in the [Warsaw Uprising]).\n\nAlready during his lifetime Stankiewicz became known to his crew as \"Znaczy Kapitan\", which could be roughly translated as \" 'It means' Captain\", a nickname coined after Stankiewicz's habit of starting almost every sentence with the word \"znaczy\" (alternatively it may be translated as \"You mean\", but the expression is the third-person neuter singular form of \"to mean\"). The nickname also became the title of Karol Olgierd Borchardt's first book on Stankiewicz.\n\n</div>\n"}

A prominent member of Brooklyn's Hasidic community, Stark was kidnapped outside his office at 331 Rutledge Street in Williamsburg, Brooklyn on January 2, 2014, in an intended robbery. His body was found smoldering in a dumpster outside a Getty station on Cutter Mill Road in Great Neck, New York, on January 3, 2014.\n\nAccording to coroner reports, he died of suffocation, and was also badly burned on his torso and hands. When found, he had $4,000 cash in his pocket, and uncashed checks in his name worth another $41,000.\n\nStark exited his office at around 11:45pm on January 2, 2014, into a heavy blizzard. A surveillance camera positioned near the office captured images of Stark struggling with two attackers for nearly five minutes, before being forced into a silver Dodge Caravan. Broken handcuffs and plastic restraining tape were later found on the sidewalk.\n\nDuring the weeks before his death, Stark reportedly ended his conversations with the phrase \"Please pray for me\", and asked the person to whom he was speaking to invoke his name and his mother's name, a sign in Orthodox Judaism of someone facing a life-threatening situation.\n\nIn May 2014, construction worker Kendal Felix, 29, was indicted on charges of second-degree murder, kidnapping, and attempted robbery in the Stark case. Felix lived in nearby Crown Heights, and had done about $20,000 worth of construction work for Stark but had not been paid. He said that he and two accomplices had kidnapped Stark, hoping to get the money. According to the \"New York Post\", Felix confessed to the killing and admitted to being the driver of the van, as well as one of the men who wrestled with Stark on the sidewalk.\n\nThe \"Post\" said that Felix implicated two other men in the murder, but that they had been arrested and then released. According to Felix's alleged confession, one of the accomplices said \"He owes me money\" just before they grabbed Stark.\n\nAccording to the Nassau County Medical Examiner, which conducted an autopsy, Stark died of asphyxia by compression of the neck and chest. Felix indicated that the death was unintentional, and occurred after one of Felix's accomplices sat on Stark inside the minivan.\n\nPublic records showed that Stark and his business partner, Israel Perlmutter, had some business troubles dating back to the real estate market crash, including a $29 million loan default resulting in a 2009 bankruptcy and a lawsuit in 2011, and an unrelated $2.9 million loan default that lead to a $4 million judgement in 2012. The media also reported on a long list of building violations in properties owned by Stark and his partners. Tenants had described revolting conditions in Stark-owned residential buildings for many years, although shortly after Stark's death, glowing reviews of his properties began to appear on social media sites.\n\nAmong Stark and Perlmutter's creditors was the Broadway Bank of Chicago, notable for its loans to organized crime figures, such as convicted bookmaker Michael \"Jaws\" Giorango. Stark and Perlmutter defaulted on a $1.5 million loan from the bank, part of the $104 million in loan defaults that contributed to the bank's demise.\n\nBank accounts belonging to Southside LLC (Stark and Perlmutter's corporation) appear to have been tampered with to conceal a diversion of funds. According to court filings, $3.6 million was found to be missing from accounts maintained by Southside LLC. Unauthorized withdrawals had been made in the second half of 2013.\n\nJonathan Flaxer, a trustee appointed by the bankruptcy court to oversee the Southside LLC case, said that Stark had \"obtained cashier's checks made out to a multitude of individuals, entities and law firms to pay for personal debts or for use in other real estate transactions.\" According to the \"Daily News\", the checks were marked \"customer withdrawal\". The \"Daily News\" said that court records show that, in the month before Stark was murdered, five \"customer withdrawals\" were taken out from the account, totaling $267,101.\n\nAccording to court records, a rent security account at one of Southside LLC's businesses contained only $3,500, when it should have in excess of $200,000 on deposit. The account contained rents collected from the company's buildings, which the company continued to manage as its bankruptcy was being processed.\n\nFlaxer said he would call Stark's widow and his partner Perlmutter to testify in the case. Perlmutter, via his attorney, said he would use his Fifth Amendment right to avoid self-incrimination if he is questioned about the missing money.\n\nPerlmutter also reportedly told police that the pair owed about $1 million to a loan shark and/or a Russian businessman.\n\nStark died without a will.\n\nThe \"New York Post\" featured an image of the deceased Stark on the front page of their January 5 edition with the headline \"Who Didn't Want Him Dead?\" The front page sparked outrage, specifically among members of the Orthodox Jewish Community, amid suggestions that the \"Post\" was helping to create a climate of violence. Brooklyn Borough President Eric Adams, New York Assemblyman Dov Hikind, and other local politicians condemned the coverage at a press conference at Brooklyn Borough Hall, and there were calls for a boycott of the tabloid. The \"Post\" refused to apologize, saying that the headline referred only to Stark's \"many enemies\", and expressed its sympathies to the deceased man's family. Stark left behind a wife and seven children.\n\nStark was publicly mourned by the Hasidic community. \"The Jewish Daily Forward\" noted that, \"For his Satmar friends and colleagues, Stark, 38, embodied the best of their world: a generous person with an open wallet for anyone in search of aid.\" \"The Forward\" added that \"Stark appears to have personified a contradiction familiar both inside and outside ultra-Orthodox circles: a pious philanthropist whose business dealings didn't always live up to avowed communal standards.\"\n\nAfter his death, the Chassidic fertility charity Bonei Olam dedicated a new Clinical Genetics Fund in his name \"to help couples with genetic issues realize their dreams of parenthood\".\n"}

The player can watch cats interact with objects, take photos of them which can be saved in an album, and receive gifts of fish and mementos from them.\n\nCats will leave the player either silver or gold \"niboshi\" (, small dried sardines), called \"fish\" in the English version, after leaving the yard. Players can also enter a daily password to receive a random amount of silver or gold fish. This feature can be located in the \"news\" button from the main menu. Once there, the player simply taps the cat that is holding the sign and this will direct the player to a new page with the following options; \"Input Password\", \"Submit Feedback\" and the game's \"Official FAQ\". The player can tap on \"Input Password\" and a daily log will be created, and fish will be rewarded. After five daily passwords are entered, the player will receive a free can of \"Ritzy Bitz\" (a high quality food). The fish can be used to purchase new types of food and goods, remodels, as well as extensions to the yard. Cats may leave collectible \"mementos\" for the player.\n\nAfter purchasing the initial expansion to the garden, the player can then purchase a remodel for their yard. Players have the option to remodel their yard to one of seven different styles: Original, Zen, Rustic, Modern, Western, Sugary, or Cafe.\n\nThere is no end game and cats will continue to come as long as the player puts out food for them.\n\nThe game is free to play, though additional fish are available for purchase.\n\nThere are currently 63 cats for the player to collect. Among these, 22 are considered \"rare cats\" and only appear when certain items and foods are placed in the yard. Each cat has a unique name, personality and appearance. The player may rename the cats after they have encountered them. Rare cats have a unique interaction with their items. Many of the rare cats in the English version of the game are named after famous people, both fictional and non-fictional, with the names of the cats being puns, like Lady Meow Meow (Lady Gaga) Mr. Meowgi (Mr. Miyagi), Chairman Meow (Chairman Mao), Guy Furry (Guy Fieri), Saint Purrtrick (Saint Patrick), Xerxes IX (Xerxes I), Hermeowne (Hermione Granger), Billy the Kitten (Billy the Kid), Señor Don Gato (gato=cat in Spanish) (Don Carlos), and Joe DiMeowgio (Joe DiMaggio, complete with megaphone and baseball). While Peaches is not considered a rare cat, it has been noted that this cat is harder to find than the others. Peaches is a cream-coloured cat with an orange heart on her body. She has an orange circle over her left eye, on her side, and on the tip of her tail.\n\nYutaka Takazaki, the developer of the game, said that his goal was to create a game that even children could enjoy without a significant investment of skill or time. While he loves cats himself, he has said that \"to be honest, I do not know why this game is so popular.\" The game \"was made between the development of other applications\". Originally it was a software of the \"just look and enjoy\" style for players who like cats, and could be completed in 2–3 weeks for free. Takazaki says, \"We're not going to put cheats or complexity in it, and we would like to pursue a game that can be enjoyed with only simple operations.\"\n\nOn 30 October 2015, an English version of the game, called \"Neko Atsume: Kitty Collector\", was released on the Android and iOS App stores. As of version 1.4.5, players can switch between Japanese and English versions of the game any time they want from the game menu. Even before the English version, guides were written for English-speaking users to play the game.\n\nIn version 1.5.5, there is a chance that the player's yard will be covered in snow. The snow event typically lasts for 24 hours and changes the appearance of the yard as well as the background music. The player also has the opportunity to get a new rare cat, Frosty. Version 1.6.0 was released on March 24, 2016. This version added two new common cats and two new rare cats, more toys, and introduced the \"gallery\" where players can buy wallpapers for their phones with gold fish.

{"id": "40879655", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=40879655", "title": "Ofrenda", "text": "Ofrenda\n\nAn ofrenda (Spanish: \"offering\") is a collection of objects placed on a ritual display during the annual and traditionally Mexican \"Día de Muertos\" celebration. An \"ofrenda\", which may be quite large and elaborate, is usually created for an individual person who has died and is intended to welcome them to the altar setting\n\nThis display coincides with the Día de Muertos, which is a tradition originating with the Aztecs. The Aztec culture considered souls to continuously live and enter different realms when a body would die. This view the Aztecs held was commingled with the Christian beliefs that the soul is eternal (whether it be in heaven, purgatory, or hell) during the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire when the two cultures were merged. The ofrenda is presented in one's home in order to commemorate the souls of loved ones in the family.\n\nA common format for an \"ofrenda\" contains three levels or tiers. The topmost tier identifies the dead person who is being invited to the altar, frequently with photos of the deceased, along with images of various saints, statuettes of the Virgin Mary, crucifixes, etc. which are positioned in a \"retablo\" which forms the back of the altar; on the second tier are things placed to encourage the dead to feel at home and welcome: the deceased person's favorite food items might go here, including such things as \"mole\", candy, \"pan dulce\", and especially a sweet bread called \"pan de muerto\". For deceased adults, the \"ofrenda\" might include a bottle or poured shot glasses of tequila or mezcal, while if the deceased is a child a favorite toy might be placed here. The bottom-most tier almost always contains lit candles, and might also have a washbasin, mirror, soap, and a towel so that the spirit of the deceased can see and refresh themselves upon arrival at the altar. Throughout the altar are placed \"calaveras\" (decorated candied skulls made from compressed sugar) and bright orange and yellow marigolds (\"cempazuchitl\"), an Aztec flower of the dead. \"Ofrendas\" are constructed in the home as well as in village cemeteries and churches.\n\nThe ofrenda typically features types of decorations that are representative of the four elements. For example, candles are lit on the table to symbolize the element of fire. Incense from the resin of copal trees are also used in the offering in order to produce smells that will scare away evil spirits.\n\nA non-fiction children's book called \"Day of the Dead: A Mexican-American Celebration\" was written by Diane Hoyt-Goldsmith. The book is about a Mexican-American family celebrating the Day of the Dead (Día de Muertos) in California and is focused on two young twins in the family. The twins help the family create an ofrenda for their loved ones, as well as a larger ofrenda for their community.\n"}
{"id": "22709", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=22709", "title": "Okapi", "text": "Okapi\n\nThe okapi (; \"Okapia johnstoni\"), also known as the forest giraffe, congolese giraffe or zebra giraffe, is an artiodactyl mammal native to the northeast of the Democratic Republic of the Congo in Central Africa. Although the okapi bears striped markings reminiscent of zebras, it is most closely related to the giraffe. The okapi and the giraffe are the only living members of the family Giraffidae. The okapi stands about tall at the shoulder and has an average body length around . Its weight ranges from . It has a long neck, and large, flexible ears. Its coat is a chocolate to reddish brown, much in contrast with the white horizontal stripes and rings on the legs and white ankles. Male okapis have short, hair-covered, horn-like protuberances on their heads called ossicones, less than in length. Females possess hair whorls, and ossicones are absent.\n\nOkapis are primarily diurnal, but may be active for a few hours in darkness. They are essentially solitary, coming together only to breed. Okapis are herbivores, feeding on tree leaves and buds, grasses, ferns, fruits, and fungi. Rut in males and estrus in females does not depend on the season. In captivity, estrous cycles recur every 15 days. The gestational period is around 440 to 450 days long, following which usually a single calf is born. The juveniles are kept in hiding, and nursing takes place infrequently. Juveniles start taking solid food from three months, and weaning takes place at six months.\n\nOkapis inhabit canopy forests at altitudes of . They are endemic to the tropical forests of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, where they occur across the central, northern, and eastern regions. The International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources classifies the okapi as endangered. Major threats include habitat loss due to logging and human settlement. Extensive hunting for bushmeat and skin and illegal mining have also led to a decline in populations. The Okapi Conservation Project was established in 1987 to protect okapi populations.\n\nAlthough the okapi was unknown to the Western world until the 20th century, it may have been depicted since the early fifth century BCE on the façade of the Apadana at Persepolis, a gift from the Ethiopian procession to the Achaemenid kingdom.\n\nFor years, Europeans in Africa had heard of an animal that they came to call the African unicorn. In his travelogue of exploring the Congo, Henry Morton Stanley mentioned a kind of donkey that the natives called the \"atti\", which scholars later identified as the okapi. Explorers may have seen the fleeting view of the striped backside as the animal fled through the bushes, leading to speculation that the okapi was some sort of rainforest zebra.\n\nWhen the British governor of Uganda, Sir Harry Johnston, discovered some pygmy inhabitants of the Congo being abducted by a showman for exhibition, he rescued them and promised to return them to their homes. The grateful pygmies fed Johnston's curiosity about the animal mentioned in Stanley's book. Johnston was puzzled by the okapi tracks the natives showed him; while he had expected to be on the trail of some sort of forest-dwelling horse, the tracks were of a cloven-hoofed beast.\n\nThough Johnston did not see an okapi himself, he did manage to obtain pieces of striped skin and eventually a skull. From this skull, the okapi was correctly classified as a relative of the giraffe; in 1901, the species was formally recognized as \"Okapia johnstoni\".\n\n\"Okapia johnstoni\" was first described as \"Equus johnstoni\" by English zoologist Philip Lutley Sclater in 1901. The generic name \"Okapia\" derives from the Lese Karo name \"o'api\", while the specific name (\"johnstoni\") is in recognition of the British Governor of Uganda, Sir Harry Johnston, who first acquired an okapi specimen for science from the Ituri Forest while repatriating a group of Pygmies to the Belgian Congo. The animal was brought to prominent European attention by speculation on its existence found in press reports covering Henry Morton Stanley's journeys in 1887. Remains of a carcass were later sent to London by the English adventurer and colonial administrator Harry Johnston and became a media event in 1901.\n\nIn 1901, Sclater presented a painting of the okapi before the Zoological Society of London that depicted its physical features with some clarity. Much confusion arose regarding the taxonomical status of this newly discovered animal. Sir Harry Johnston himself called it a \"Helladotherium\", or a relative of other extinct giraffids. Based on the description of the okapi by Pygmies, who referred to it as a \"horse\", Sclater named the species \"Equus johnstoni\". Subsequently, Lankester declared that the okapi represented an unknown genus of the Giraffidae, which he placed in its own genus, \"Okapia\", and assigned the name \"Okapia johnstoni\" to the species.\n\nIn 1902, Swiss zoologist Charles Immanuel Forsyth Major suggested the inclusion of \"O. johnstoni\" in the extinct giraffid subfamily Palaeotraginae. However, the species was placed in its own subfamily Okapiinae, by Swedish palaeontologist Birger Bohlin in 1926, mainly due to the lack of a cingulum, a major feature of the palaeotragids. In 1986, \"Okapia\" was finally established as a sister genus of \"Giraffa\" on the basis of cladistic analysis. The two genera together with \"Palaeotragus\" constitute the tribe Giraffini.\n\nThe earliest members of the Giraffidae first appeared in the early Miocene in Africa, having diverged from the superficially deer-like climacoceratids. Giraffids spread into Europe and Asia by the middle Miocene in a first radiation. Another radiation began in the Pliocene, but was terminated by a decline in diversity in the Pleistocene. Several important primitive giraffids existed more or less contemporaneously in the Miocene (23-10 million years ago), including \"Canthumeryx\", \"Giraffokeryx\", \"Palaeotragus\", and \"Samotherium\". According to palaeontologist and author Kathleen Hunt, \"Samotherium\" split into \"Okapia\" (18 million years ago) and \"Giraffa\" (12 million years ago). However, J. D. Skinner argued that \"Canthumeryx\" gave rise to the okapi and giraffe through the latter three genera and that the okapi is the extant form of \"Palaeotragus\". The okapi is sometimes referred to as an example of a living fossil, as it has existed as a species over a long geological time period, and morphologically resembles more primitive forms (e.g. \"Samotherium\").\n\nA 2016 study found that the common ancestor of giraffe and okapi lived about 11.5 million years ago.\n\nThe okapi is a medium-sized giraffid, standing tall at the shoulder. Its average body length is about and its weight ranges from . It has a long neck, and large and flexible ears. The coat is a chocolate to reddish brown, much in contrast with the white horizontal stripes and rings on the legs and white ankles. The striking stripes make it resemble a zebra. These features serve as an effective camouflage amidst dense vegetation. The face, throat, and chest are greyish white. Interdigital glands are present on all four feet, and are slightly larger on the front feet. Male okapis have short, hair-covered horns called ossicones, less than in length. The okapi exhibits sexual dimorphism, with females taller on average, slightly redder, and lacking prominent ossicones, instead possessing hair whorls.\n\nThe okapi shows several adaptations to its tropical habitat. The large number of rod cells in the retina facilitate night vision, and an efficient olfactory system is present. The large auditory bullae allow a strong sense of hearing. The dental formula of the okapi is . Teeth are low-crowned and finely cusped, and efficiently cut tender foliage. The large caecum and colon help in microbial digestion, and a quick rate of food passage allows for lower cell wall digestion than in other ruminants.\nThe okapi can be easily distinguished from its nearest extant relative, the giraffe. It is much smaller and shares more external similarities with the deer and bovids than with the giraffe. While both sexes possess horns in the giraffe, only males bear horns in the okapi. The okapi has large palatine sinuses, unique among the giraffids. Morphological similarities shared between the giraffe and the okapi include a similar gait – both use a pacing gait, stepping simultaneously with the front and the hind leg on the same side of the body, unlike other ungulates that walk by moving alternate legs on either side of the body – and a long, black tongue (longer in the okapi) useful in plucking buds and leaves, as well as for grooming.\n\nOkapis are primarily diurnal, but may be active for a few hours in darkness. They are essentially solitary, coming together only to breed. They have overlapping home ranges and typically occur at densities around 0.6 animals per square kilometre. Male home ranges average , while female home ranges average . Males migrate continuously, while females are sedentary. Males often mark territories and bushes with their urine, while females use common defecation sites. Grooming is a common practice, focused at the earlobes and the neck. Okapis often rub their necks against trees, leaving a brown exudate.\n\nThe male is protective of his territory, but allows females to pass through the domain to forage. Males visit female home ranges at breeding time. Although generally tranquil, the okapi can kick and butt with its head to show aggression. As the vocal cords are poorly developed, vocal communication is mainly restricted to three sounds — \"chuff\" (contact calls used by both sexes), \"moan\" (by females during courtship) and \"bleat\" (by infants under stress). Individuals may engage in Flehmen response, a visual expression in which the animal curls back its upper lips, displays the teeth, and inhales through the mouth for a few seconds. The leopard is the main predator of the okapi.\n\nOkapis are herbivores, feeding on tree leaves and buds, grasses, ferns, fruits, and fungi. They are unique in the Ituri Forest as they are the only known mammal that feeds solely on understory vegetation, where they use their 18 inch tongues to selectively browse for suitable plants. The tongue is also used to groom their ears and eyes. They prefer to feed in treefall gaps. The okapi has been known to feed on over 100 species of plants, some of which are known to be poisonous to humans and other animals. Fecal analysis shows that none of those 100 species dominates the diet of the okapi. Staple foods comprise shrubs and lianas. The main constituents of the diet are woody, dicotyledonous species; monocotyledonous plants are not eaten regularly. In the Ituri forest, the okapi feeds mainly upon the plant families Acanthaceae, Ebenaceae, Euphorbiaceae, Flacourtiaceae, Loganiaceae, Rubiaceae, and Violaceae.\n\nFemale okapis become sexually mature at about one-and-a-half years old, while males reach maturity after two years. Rut in males and estrous in females does not depend on the season. In captivity, estrous cycles recur every 15 days. The male and the female begin courtship by circling, smelling and licking each other. The male shows his dominance by extending his neck, tossing his head, and protruding one leg forward. This is followed by mounting and copulation.\n\nThe gestational period is around 440 to 450 days long, following which usually a single calf is born, weighing . The udder of the pregnant female starts swelling two months before parturition, and vulval discharges may occur. Parturition takes 3–4 hours, and the female stands throughout this period, though she may rest during brief intervals. The mother consumes the afterbirth and extensively grooms the infant. Her milk is very rich in proteins and low in fat.\n\nAs in other ruminants, the infant can stand within 30 minutes of birth. Although generally similar to adults, newborn calves have false eyelashes, a long dorsal mane, and long white hairs in the stripes. These features gradually disappear and give way to the general appearance within a year. The juveniles are kept in hiding, and nursing takes place infrequently. Calves are known not to defecate for the first month or two of life, which is hypothesized to help avoid predator detection in their most vulnerable phase of life. The growth rate of calves is appreciably high in the first few months of birth, after which it gradually declines. Juveniles start taking solid food from three months, and weaning takes place at six months. Horn development in males takes one year after birth. The okapi's typical lifespan is 20 to 30 years.\n\nThe okapi is endemic to the Democratic Republic of the Congo, where it occurs north and east of the Congo River. It ranges from the Maiko National Park northward to the Ituri rainforest, then through the river basins of the Rubi, Lake Tele, and Ebola to the west and the Ubangi River further north. Smaller populations exist west and south of the Congo River. It is also common in the Wamba and Epulu areas. It is extinct in Uganda.\n\nThe okapi inhabits canopy forests at altitudes of . It occasionally uses seasonally inundated areas, but does not occur in gallery forests, swamp forests, and habitats disturbed by human settlements. In the wet season, it visits rocky inselbergs that offer forage uncommon elsewhere. Results of research conducted in the late 1980s in a mixed \"Cynometra\" forest indicated that the okapi population density averaged 0.53 animals per square kilometre.\n\nIn 2008, it was recorded in Virunga National Park.\n\nThe IUCN classifies the okapi as endangered. It is fully protected under Congolese law. The Okapi Wildlife Reserve and Maiko National Park support significant populations of the okapi, though a steady decline in numbers has occurred due to several threats. Other areas of occurrence are the Rubi Tele Hunting Reserve and the Abumombanzi Reserve. Major threats include habitat loss due to logging and human settlement. Extensive hunting for bushmeat and skin and illegal mining have also led to population declines. A threat that has emerged quite recently is the presence of illegal armed groups around protected areas, inhibiting conservation and monitoring actions. A small population occurs north of the Virunga National Park, but is bereft of protection due to the presence of armed groups in the vicinity. In June 2012, a gang of poachers attacked the headquarters of the Okapi Wildlife Reserve, killing six guards and other staff as well as all 14 okapis at their breeding center.\n\nThe Okapi Conservation Project, established in 1987, works towards the conservation of the okapi, as well as the growth of the indigenous Mbuti people. In November 2011, the White Oak Conservation center and Jacksonville Zoo and Gardens hosted an international meeting of the Okapi Species Survival Plan and the Okapi European Endangered Species Programme at Jacksonville, which was attended by representatives from zoos from the USA, Europe, and Japan. The aim was to discuss the management of captive okapis and arrange support for okapi conservation. Many zoos in North America and Europe currently have okapis in captivity.\n\nAround 100 okapis are in accredited Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA) zoos. The okapi population is managed in America by the AZA's Species Survival Plan, a breeding program that works to ensure genetic diversity in the captive population of endangered animals, while the EEP (European studbook) and ISB (Global studbook) are managed by Antwerp Zoo, which was the first zoo to have an Okapi on display (in 1919), as well as one of the most successful in breeding them.\n\nThe Bronx Zoo was the first zoo in North America to exhibit Okapi, in 1937. They have had one of the most successful breeding programs, with 13 calves having been born since 1991.\n\nThe San Diego Zoo has exhibited okapis since 1956, and had their first birth of an okapi in 1962. Since then, over 60 births have occurred between the zoo and the San Diego Zoo Safari Park, with the most recent being Mosi, a male calf born in early August 2017 at the San Diego Zoo.\n\nThe Brookfield Zoo in Chicago has also greatly contributed to the captive population of okapis in accredited zoos. The zoo has had 28 okapi births since 1959.\n\nOther North American Zoos that exhibit and breed okapis include the Denver Zoo, Cheyenne Mountain Zoo (Colorado), Houston Zoo, Dallas Zoo, San Antonio Zoo (Texas), Disney's Animal Kingdom, Miami Zoo, Tampa's Lowry Park Zoo, Jacksonville Zoo (Florida), Los Angeles Zoo (California), Saint Louis Zoo (Missouri), Cincinnati Zoo, Columbus Zoo (Ohio), Memphis Zoo (Tennessee), Maryland Zoo (Maryland), The Sedgwick County Zoo (Kansas), and Omaha's Henry Doorly Zoo (Nebraska).\n\nIn Europe, zoos that exhibit and breed okapis include Chester Zoo, London Zoo, Bristol Zoo, Marwell Zoo, The Wild Place (United Kingdom); Dublin Zoo (Ireland); Berlin Zoo, Frankfurt Zoo, Wilhelma Zoo, Wuppertal Zoo, Cologne Zoo, Leipzig Zoo (Germany) and Antwerp Zoo (Belgium); Zurich Zoo, Zoo Basel (Switzerland); Copenhagen Zoo (Denmark); Rotterdam Zoo, Safaripark Beekse Bergen (Netherlands) and Dvůr Králové Zoo (Czech Republic), Wrocław Zoo (Poland); Bioparc Zoo de Doué, ZooParc de Beauval (France); Lisbon Zoo (Portugal).\n\nIn Asia, only two zoos in Japan exhibit okapis; Ueno Zoo in Tokyo and Zoorasia in Yokohama.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1251821", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1251821", "title": "Plant embryogenesis", "text": "Plant embryogenesis\n\nPlant embryogenesis is a process that occurs after the fertilization of an ovule to produce a fully developed plant embryo. This is a pertinent stage in the plant life cycle that is followed by dormancy and germination. The zygote produced after fertilization, must undergo various cellular divisions and differentiations to become a mature embryo. An end stage embryo has five major components including the shoot apical meristem, hypocotyl, root meristem, root cap, and cotyledons. Unlike animal embryogenesis, plant embryogenesis results in an immature form of the plant, lacking most structures like leaves, stems, and reproductive structures.\n\nEmbryogenesis occurs naturally as a result of single, or double fertilzation, of the ovule, giving rise to two distinct structures: the plant embryo and the endosperm which go on to develop into a seed. The zygote goes through various cellular differentiations and divisions in order to produce a mature embryo. These morphogenic events form the basic cellular pattern for the development of the shoot-root body and the primary tissue layers; it also programs the regions of meristematic tissue formation. The following morphogenic events are only particular to eudicots, and not monocots.\nFollowing fertilization, the zygote and endosperm are present within the ovule, as seen in stage I of the illustration on this page. Then the zygote undergoes an asymmetric transverse cell division that gives rise to two cells - a small apical cell resting above a large basal cell. These two cells are very different, and give rise to different structures, establishing polarity in the embryo.\n\nAfter two rounds of longitudinal division, and one round of transverse division, an eight-celled embryo is the result. Stage II, in the illustration above, indicates what the embryo looks like during the eight cell stage. According to Laux et al., there are four distinct domains during the eight cell stage. The first two domains contribute to the embryo proper. The \"apical embryo domain\", gives rise to the shoot apical meristem and cotyledons. The second domain, the \"central embryo domain\" , gives rise to the hypocotyl, root apical meristem, and parts of the cotyledons. The third domain, the \"basal embryo domain,\" contains the hypophysis. The hypophysis will later give rise to the radicle and the root cap. The last domain, the \"suspensor\", is the region at the very bottom, which connects the embryo to the endosperm for nutritional purposes.\n\nAdditional cell divisions occur, which leads to the sixteen cell stage. The four domains are still present, but they are more defined with the presence of more cells. The important aspect of this stage is the introduction of the protoderm, which is meristematic tissue that will give rise to the epidermis. The protoderm is the outermost layer of cells in the embryo proper.\n\nThe name of this stage is indicative of the embryo's appearance at this point in embryogenesis; it is spherical or globular. Stage III, in the photograph above, depicts what the embryo looks like during the globular stage. 1 is indicating the location of the endosperm. The important component of the globular phase is the introduction of the rest of the primary meristematic tissue. The protoderm was already introduced during the sixteen cell stage. According to Evert and Eichhorn, the ground meristem and procambium are initiated during the globular stage. The ground meristem will go on to form the ground tissue, which includes the pith and cortex. The procambium will eventually form the vascular tissue, which includes the xylem and phloem.\n\nAccording to Evert and Eichhorn, the heart stage is a transition period where the cotyledons finally start to form and elongate. It is given this name in eudicots because most plants from this group have two cotyledons, giving the embryo a heart shaped appearance. Between the cotyledons is where the shoot apical meristem lies. Stage IV, in the illustration above, indicates what the embryo looks like at this point in development. 5 indicates the position of the cotyledons.\n\nThis stage is defined by the continued growth of the cotyledons and axis elongation. In addition, programmed cell death must occur during this stage. This is carried out throughout the entire growth process, like any other development. However, in the torpedo stage of development, parts of the suspensor complex must be terminated. The suspensor complex is shortened because at this point in development most of the nutrition from the endosperm has been utilized, and there must be space for the mature embryo. After the suspensor complex is gone, the embryo is fully developed. Stage V, in the illustration above, indicates what the embryo looks like at this point in development.\n\nThe second phase, or postembryonic development, involves the maturation of cells, which involves cell growth and the storage of macromolecules (such as oils, starches and proteins) required as a 'food and energy supply' during germination and seedling growth. The appearance of a mature embryo is seen in Stage VI, in the illustration above.\n\nThe end of embryogenesis is defined by an arrested development phase, or stop in growth. This phase usually coincides with a necessary component of growth called dormancy. Dormancy is a period in which a seed cannot germinate, even under optimal environmental conditions, until a specific requirement is met. Breaking dormancy, or finding the specific requirement of the seed, can be rather difficult. For example, a seed coat can be extremely thick. According to Evert and Eichhorn, very thick seed coats must undergo a process called scarification, in order to deteriorate the coating. In other cases, seeds must experience stratification. This process exposes the seed to certain environmental conditions, like cold or smoke, to break dormancy and initiate germination.\n\nAuxin is a hormone related to the elongation and regulation of plants. It also plays an important role in the establishment polarity with the plant embryo. Research, conducted by Cooke, Racusen, and Cohen, has shown that the hypocotyl from both gymnosperms and angiosperms show auxin transport to the root end of the embryo They hypothesized that the embryonic pattern is regulated by the auxin transport mechanism, and the polar positioning of cells within the ovule. The importance of auxin was shown, in their research, when carrot embryos, at different stages, were subjected to auxin transport inhibitors. The inhibitors that these carrots were subjected to made them unable to progress to later stages of embryogenesis. During the globular stage of embryogenesis, the embryos continued spherical expansion. In addition, oblong embryos continued axial growth, without the introduction of cotyledons. During the heart embryo stage of development there were additional growth axes on hypocotyls. Further auxin transport inhibition research, conducted on \"Brassica juncea\", show that after germination, the cotyledons were fused and not two separate structures.\n\nSomatic embryos are formed from plant cells that are not normally involved in the development of embryos, i.e. ordinary plant tissue. No endosperm or seed coat is formed around a somatic embryo. Applications of this process include: clonal propagation of genetically uniform plant material; elimination of viruses; provision of source tissue for genetic transformation; generation of whole plants from single cells called protoplasts; development of synthetic seed technology. Cells derived from competent source tissue are cultured to form an undifferentiated mass of cells called a callus. Plant growth regulators in the tissue culture medium can be manipulated to induce callus formation and subsequently changed to induce embryos to form the callus. The ratio of different plant growth regulators required to induce callus or embryo formation varies with the type of plant. Asymmetrical cell division also seems to be important in the development of somatic embryos, and while failure to form the suspensor cell is lethal to zygotic embryos, it is not lethal for somatic embryos.\n\nThe process of androgenesis allows a mature plant embryo to form from a reduced, or immature, pollen grain. Androgenesis usually occurs under stressful conditions. Embryos that result from this mechanism can germinate into fully functional plants. As mentioned, the embryo results from a single pollen grain. Pollen grains consists of three cells - one vegetative cell containg two generative cells. According to Maraschin et al., androgenesis must be triggered during the asymmetric division of microspores. However, once the vegetative cell starts to make starch and proteins, androgenesis can no longer occur. Maraschin et al., indicates that this mode of embryogenesis consists of three phases. The first phase is the \"acquisition of embryonic potential\", which is the repression of gametophyte formation, so that the differentiation of cells can occur. Then during the \"initiation of cell divisions\", multicellular structures begin to form, which are contained by the exine wall. The last step of androgenesis is \"pattern formation\", where the embryo-like structures are released out of the exile wall, in order for pattern formation to continue.\n\nAfter these three phases occur, the rest of the process falls in line with the standard embryogenesis events.\nEmbryonic tissue is made up of actively growing cells and the term is normally used to describe the early formation of tissue in the first stages of growth. It can refer to different stages of the sporophyte and gametophyte plant; including the growth of embryos in seedlings, and to meristematic tissues, which are in a persistently embryonic state, to the growth of new buds on stems.\n\nIn both gymnosperms and angiosperms, the young plant contained in the seed, begins as a developing egg-cell formed after fertilization (sometimes without fertilization in a process called apomixis) and becomes a plant embryo.\nThis embryonic condition also occurs in the buds that form on stems. The buds have tissue that has differentiated but not grown into complete structures. They can be in a resting state, lying dormant over winter or when conditions are dry, and then commence growth when conditions become suitable. Before they start growing into stem, leaves, or flowers, the buds are said to be in an embryonic state.\n\n- http://www.umanitoba.ca/afs/plant_science/COURSES/39_768/l15/l15.1.html A site on the developing plant embryo from a molecular genetics perspective\n"}
{"id": "69348", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=69348", "title": "Resurrection of the dead", "text": "Resurrection of the dead\n\nResurrection of the dead, or resurrection from the dead (Koine: , \"anastasis [ton] nekron\"; literally: \"standing up again of the dead\") is used in the doctrine and theology of various religions to describe an event by which a person, or people are resurrected (brought back to life). Various forms of this concept can be found in Islamic, Jewish and Zoroastrian eschatology. In some Neopagan views this refers to reincarnation between the three realms: Life, Death, and the Realm of the Divine.\n\nIn the New Testament of the Christian Bible, the three common usages for this term pertain to (1) the resurrection of Jesus; (2) the rising from the dead of all men, at the end of this present age and (3) the resurrection of certain ones in history, who were restored to life.\n\nThe Zoroastrian belief in an end times renovation of the earth is known as \"frashokereti\", which includes some form of revival of the dead that can be attested from no earlier than the 4th century BCE. As distinct from Judaism this is the resurrection of all the dead to universal purification and renewal of the world. In the \"frashokereti\" doctrine, the final renovation of the universe is when evil will be destroyed, and everything else will be then in perfect unity with God (Ahura Mazda). The term probably means \"making wonderful, excellent\". The doctrinal premises are (1) good will eventually prevail over evil; (2) creation was initially perfectly good, but was subsequently corrupted by evil; (3) the world will ultimately be restored to the perfection it had at the time of creation; (4) the \"salvation for the individual depended on the sum of [that person's] thoughts, words and deeds, and there could be no intervention, whether compassionate or capricious, by any divine being to alter this.\" Thus, each human bears the responsibility for the fate of his own soul, and simultaneously shares in the responsibility for the fate of the world.\n\nIn Judaism and Samaritanism, it is believed that the God of Israel will one day give \"teḥiyyat ha-metim\" (\"life to the dead\") to the righteous during the Messianic Age, and they will live forever in the world to come (\"Olam Ha-Ba\"). Jews base this belief on the prophecies contained in the Hebrew Bible: the Book of Isaiah (Yeshayahu), Book of Ezekiel (Yeḥez'qel), and Book of Daniel (Dani'el). Samaritans base it solely on a passage called the \"Ha'azeinu\" in the Samaritan Pentateuch, since they only accept the Torah and reject the rest of the Hebrew Bible.\n\nJews believe that both the righteous and the wicked who are deceased will be resurrected and judged by God. They believe that the righteous Jews and the Noahides (righteous gentiles) will have eternal life on earth in the world to come, while the wicked will be punished and executed. Samaritans believe that only the righteous of Israel will be resurrected and given eternal life on earth.\n\nThe resurrection of the dead is a core belief of the Mishnah. The belief in resurrection is expressed on all occasions in the Jewish liturgy; e.g., in the morning prayer \"Elohai Neshamah\", in the \"Shemoneh 'Esreh\" and in the funeral services. Maimonides made it the last of his Thirteen Articles of Faith: \"I firmly believe that there will take place a revival of the dead at a time which will please the Creator, blessed be His name.\"\n\nThere are three explicit examples in the Hebrew Bible of people being resurrected from the dead:\n\nDuring the Second Temple period, Judaism developed a diversity of beliefs concerning the resurrection. The concept of resurrection of the physical body is found in 2 Maccabees, according to which it will happen through recreation of the flesh. Resurrection of the dead also appears in detail in the extra-canonical books of Enoch, in Apocalypse of Baruch, and 2 Esdras. According to the British scholar in ancient Judaism Philip R. Davies, there is \"little or no clear reference … either to immortality or to resurrection from the dead\" in the Dead Sea scrolls texts. Both Josephus and the New Testament record that the Sadducees did not believe in an afterlife, but the sources vary on the beliefs of the Pharisees. The New Testament claims that the Pharisees believed in the resurrection, but does not specify whether this included the flesh or not. According to Josephus, who himself was a Pharisee, the Pharisees held that only the soul was immortal and the souls of good people will be reincarnated and \"pass into other bodies,\" while \"the souls of the wicked will suffer eternal punishment.\" Paul the Apostle, who also was a Pharisee, said that at the resurrection what is \"sown as a natural body is raised a spiritual body.\" Jubilees refers only to the resurrection of the soul, or to a more general idea of an immortal soul.\n\nHarry Sysling, in his 1996 study of \"Teḥiyyat Ha-Metim\" in the Palestinian Targumim, identifies a consistent usage of the term \"second death\" in texts from the Second Temple period and early rabbinical writings, but not in the Hebrew Bible. \"Second death\" is identified with judgment, followed by resurrection from \"Gehinnom\" (\"Gehenna\") at the Last Day.\n\nIn the First Epistle to the Corinthians chapter 15, ἀνάστασις νεκρῶν is used for the resurrection of the dead. In verses 54–55, Paul the Apostle is conveyed as quoting from the Book of Hosea 13:14 where he speaks of the abolition of death.\nIn the Pauline epistles of the New Testament, Paul the Apostle wrote that those who will be resurrected to eternal life will be resurrected with spiritual bodies, which are imperishable; the \"flesh and blood\" of natural, perishable bodies cannot inherit the kingdom of God, and, likewise, those that are corruptible will not receive incorruption (1 Corinthians 15:35–54). Even though Paul does not explicitly establish that immortality is exclusive to physical bodies, some scholars understand that according to Paul, flesh is simply to play no part, as we are made immortal.\n\nThe Gospel of Matthew introduces the expression ἀναστάσεως τῶν νεκρῶν, which is used in a monologue by Jesus who speaks to the crowds about \"the resurrection\" called simply, ῇ ἀναστάσει (Mat. 22:29–33). This type of resurrection refers to the raising up of the dead, all mankind, at the end of this present age, the general or universal resurrection.\n\nIn the Gospels, however, the resurrection, as exemplified by the resurrection of Jesus, is presented with an increasing emphasis on the resurrection of the flesh: from the empty tomb in Mark; the women embracing the feet of the resurrected Jesus in Matthew; the insistence of the resurrected Jesus in Luke that he is of \"flesh and bones\" and not just a spirit or \"pneuma\"; to the resurrected Jesus encouraging the disciples to touch his wounds in John.\n\nIn Acts of the Apostles the expression ἀναστάσεως νεκρῶν was used by the Apostles and Paul the Apostle to defend the doctrine of the resurrection. Paul brought up the resurrection in his trial before Ananias ben Nedebaios. The expression was variously used in reference to a general resurrection (Acts 24:21) at the end of this present age (Acts 23:6, 24:15).\n\nMost Christian denominations profess the Nicene Creed, which affirms the resurrection of the dead; most English versions of the Nicene Creed in current use include the phrase: \"We look for the resurrection of the dead, and the life of the world to come.\"\n\nThe Christian writers Irenaeus and Justin Martyr, in the 2nd century, wrote against the idea that only the soul survived. Martyr insists that a man is both soul and body and Christ has promised to raise both, just as his own body was raised.\n\nWhile the Christian doctrine of resurrection is based on Jewish belief, how the emphasis on this involving the actual flesh increased parallel with Christianity succeeding among the Greek populace may connect to traditional Greek beliefs that true immortality always had to involve both body and soul. Although the Greeks held that a few individuals had been resurrected to physical immortality and that this really was the best fate possible, there was no ancient Greek belief in a general resurrection of the dead. Indeed, they held that once a body had been destroyed, there was no possibility of returning to life as not even the gods could recreate the flesh.\n\nSeveral early Church Fathers, like Pseudo-Justin, Justin Martyr, Tatian, Irenaeus, and Athenagoras of Athens, argue about the Christian resurrection beliefs in ways that answer to this traditional Greek scepticism to post-mortal physical continuity. The human body could not be annihilated, only dissolved – it could not even be integrated in the bodies of those who devoured it. Thus God only had to reassemble the minute parts of the dissolved bodies in the resurrection.\n\nTraditional Christian Churches, i.e. ones that adhere to the creeds, continue to uphold the belief that there will be a general and universal resurrection of the dead at \"the end of time\", as described by Paul when he said, \"...he hath appointed a day, in which he will [judge the world...\" (Acts 17:31 KJV) and \"...there shall be a resurrection of the dead, both of the just and unjust.\" (Acts 24:15 KJV).\n\nEarly Christian church fathers defended the resurrection of the dead against the pagan belief that the immortal soul went to the underworld immediately after death. Currently, however, it is a popular Christian belief that the souls of the righteous go to Heaven.\n\nAt the close of the medieval period, the modern era brought a shift in Christian thinking from an emphasis on the resurrection of the body back to the immortality of the soul. This shift was a result of a change in the \"zeitgeist\", as a reaction to the Renaissance and later to the Enlightenment. André Dartigues has observed that especially \"from the 17th to the 19th century, the language of popular piety no longer evoked the resurrection of the soul but everlasting life. Although theological textbooks still mentioned resurrection, they dealt with it as a speculative question more than as an existential problem.\"\n\nThis shift was supported not by any scripture, but largely by the popular religion of the Enlightenment, Deism. Deism allowed for a supreme being, such as the philosophical first cause, but denied any significant personal or relational interaction with this figure. Deism, which was largely led by rationality and reason, could allow a belief in the immortality of the soul, but not necessarily in the resurrection of the dead. American deist Ethan Allen demonstrates this thinking in his work, \"Reason the Only Oracle of Man\" (1784) where he argues in the preface that nearly every philosophical problem is beyond humanity's understanding, including the miracles of Christianity, although he does allow for the immortality of an immaterial soul.\n\nIn Christian theology, it was once widely believed that to rise on Judgment Day the body had to be whole and preferably buried with the feet to the east so that the person would rise facing God. An Act of Parliament from the reign of King Henry VIII stipulated that only the corpses of executed murderers could be used for dissection. Restricting the supply to the cadavers of murderers was seen as an extra punishment for the crime. If one believes dismemberment stopped the possibility of resurrection of an intact body on judgment day, then a posthumous execution is an effective way of punishing a criminal. Attitudes towards this issue changed very slowly in the United Kingdom and were not manifested in law until the passing of the Anatomy Act in 1832. For much of the British population it was not until the 20th century that the link between the body and resurrection was finally broken as cremation was only made legal in 1902.\n\nIn Catholicism, in accordance to the \"Catholic Encyclopedia\": \"\"No doctrine of the Christian Faith\", says St. Augustine, \"is so vehemently and so obstinately opposed as the doctrine of the resurrection of the flesh\"... This opposition had begun long before the days of St. Augustine.\" According to the \"Summa Theologica\", spiritual beings that have been restored to glorified bodies will have the following basic qualities:\n\nIn Anglicanism, scholars such as the Bishop of Durham N. T. Wright, have defended the primacy of the resurrection in Christian faith. Interviewed by \"Time\" in 2008, senior Anglican bishop and theologian N. T. Wright spoke of \"the idea of bodily resurrection that people deny when they talk about their ‘souls going to Heaven,'\" adding: “I've often heard people say, ‘I'm going to heaven soon, and I won't need this stupid body there, thank goodness.’ That's a very damaging distortion, all the more so for being unintentional.” Instead, Wright explains: “In the Bible we are told that you die, and enter an intermediate state.\" This is \"conscious,\" but \"compared to being bodily alive, it will be like being asleep.\" This will be followed by resurrection into new bodies, he says. \"Our culture is very interested in life after death, but the New Testament is much more interested in what I've called the life after life after death.\"\n\nOf Baptists, James Leo Garrett Jr., E. Glenn Hinson, and James E. Tull write that \"Baptists traditionally have held firmly to the belief that Christ rose triumphant over death, sin, and hell in a bodily resurrection from the dead.\"\n\nIn Lutheranism, Martin Luther personally believed and taught resurrection of the dead in combination with soul sleep. However, this is not a mainstream teaching of Lutheranism and most Lutherans traditionally believe in resurrection of the body in combination with the immortal soul. According to the Lutheran Church—Missouri Synod (LCMS), on the last day all the dead will be resurrected. Their souls will then be reunited with the same bodies they had before dying. The bodies will then be changed, those of the wicked to a state of everlasting shame and torment, those of the righteous to an everlasting state of celestial glory.\n\nIn Methodism, the Reverend M. Douglas Meeks, professor of theology and Wesleyan studies at Vanderbilt Divinity School, states that \"it is very important for Christians to hold to the resurrection of the body.\" F. Belton Joyner in \"United Methodist Answers\", states that the \"New Testament does not speak of a natural immortality of the soul, as if we never actually die. It speaks of resurrection of the body, the claim that is made each time we state the historic Apostles' Creed and classic Nicene Creed\", given in \"The United Methodist Hymnal\". In ¶128 of the \"Book of Discipline\" of the Free Methodist Church it is written \"There will be a bodily resurrection from the dead of both the just and the unjust, they that have done good unto the resurrection of life, they that have done evil unto the resurrection of the damnation. The resurrected body will be a spiritual body, but the person will be whole identifiable. The Resurrection of Christ is the guarantee of resurrection unto life to those who are in Him.\" John Wesley, the founder of the Methodist Church, in his sermon \"On the Resurrection of the Dead\", defended the doctrine, stating \"There are many places of Scripture that plainly declare it. St. Paul, in the 53d verse of this chapter, tells us that 'this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality.' [1 Corinthians 15:53].\" In addition, notable Methodist hymns, such as those by Charles Wesley, link 'our resurrection and Christ's resurrection\".\n\nIn Christian conditionalism, there are several churches, such as the Anabaptists and Socinians of the Reformation, then Seventh-day Adventist Church, Christadelphians, Jehovah's Witnesses, and theologians of different traditions who reject the idea of the immortality of a non-physical soul as a vestige of Neoplatonism, and other pagan traditions. In this school of thought, the dead remain dead (and do not immediately progress to a Heaven, Hell, or Purgatory) until a physical resurrection of some or all of the dead occurs at the end of time, or in Paradise restored on earth, in a general resurrection. Some groups, Christadelphians in particular, consider that it is not a universal resurrection, and that at this time of resurrection that the Last Judgment will take place.\n\nWith evangelicals, \"The Doctrinal Basis of the Evangelical Alliance\" affirms belief in \"the resurrection of the body, the judgment of the world by our Lord Jesus Christ, with the eternal blessedness of the righteous, and the eternal punishment of the wicked.\"\n\nLatter Day Saints believe that God has a plan of salvation. Before the resurrection, the spirits of the dead are believed to exist in a place known as the spirit world, which is similar to yet fundamentally distinct from the traditional concept of Heaven and Hell. It is believed that the spirit retains its wants, beliefs, and desires in the afterlife. LDS Church doctrine teaches the Jesus Christ was the first person to be resurrected, and that all those who have lived on the earth will be resurrected because of Jesus Christ, regardless of their righteousness. The LDS Church teaches that not all are resurrected at the same time; the righteous will be resurrected in a \"first resurrection\" and unrepentant sinners in a \"last resurrection.\" The resurrection is believed to unite the spirit with the body again, and the LDS Church teaches that the body (flesh and bone) will be made whole and become incorruptible, a state which includes immortality. There is also a belief in LDS doctrine that a few exceptional individuals were removed from the earth \"without tasting of death.\" This is referred to as translation, and these individuals are believed to have retained their bodies in a purified form, though they too will eventually be required to receive resurrection.\n\nSome millennialists interpret the Book of Revelation as requiring two physical resurrections of the dead, one before the Millennium, the other after it.\n\nIn Islam, \"Yawm al-Qiyāmah\" ( \"the Day of Resurrection\") or \"Yawm ad-Din\" ( \"the Day of Judgment\") is believed to be God's final assessment of humanity. The sequence of events (according to the most commonly held belief) is the annihilation of all creatures, resurrection of the body, and the judgment of all sentient creatures. The exact time when these events will occur is unknown, however there are said to be major and minor signs which are to occur near the time of \"Qiyamah\" (end time). Many Qur'anic verses, especially the earlier ones, are dominated by the idea of the nearing of the day of resurrection.\n\nIn the sign of \"nafkhatu'l-ula\", a trumpet will be sounded for the first time, and which will result in the death of the remaining sinners. Then there will be a period of forty years. The eleventh sign is the sounding of a second trumpet to signal the resurrection as \"ba'as ba'da'l-mawt\". Then all will be naked and running to the Place of Gathering, while the enemies of Allah will be travelling on their faces with their legs upright.\n\nThe Day of Resurrection is one of the six articles of Islamic faith. Everybody will account for their deeds in this world and people will go to heaven and hell forever.\n\n\n\n"}

He graduated from Union College at Schenectady in 1827, where he was an early member of The Kappa Alpha Society, and after studying law was admitted to the bar in 1830. He served as the district attorney of Albany County from 1838 to 1841. Peckham was elected as a Democrat to the United States House of Representatives from New York's 14th District, serving in the Thirty-third Congress from March 4, 1853, until March 3, 1855. During his term, he was the chairman of the U.S. House Committee on Revolutionary Claims.\n\nPeckham afterwards returned to legal practice in a partnership with Judge Lyman Tremain, until he was elected to serve as a justice of the New York Supreme Court for the Third Judicial District, from 1861 until 1869. He then sat as an associate judge on the New York Court of Appeals from July 4, 1870, until his death. It is believed that he was under consideration for appointment to the U.S. Supreme Court at the time of his death.\n\nPeckham had three sons by his first wife, Isabella Adoline Lacey, who died on April 4, 1848 at the age of 35. Rufus Wheeler Peckham (1838–1909) followed in his namesake father's footsteps as a lawyer and in three of the positions that his father had held in New York: as the Albany district attorney (1869–1872), as a New York Supreme Court judge (1883–1886), and as a judge on the New York Court of Appeals (1886–1895). He remarried to Mary Elizabeth Foote (1830–1873). \nThe younger Peckham never went into Congress, however, but served on the Supreme Court of the United States from 1895 until his death. Peckham's oldest son, Wheeler Hazard Peckham (1833–1905), was also a lawyer who practiced in New York City. Wheeler was also nominated to the U.S. Supreme Court but the Senate failed to confirm him. Peckham had another son named Joseph Henry, who died at the age of 17 on April 2, 1852.\n\nPeckham and his second wife, Mary, were among 226 passengers and crew of the steamer SS \"Ville du Havre\" lost at sea, while the couple were en route to southern France to improve his failing health. The ship sank after colliding with the Scottish vessel \"Loch Earn\" in the north Atlantic Ocean on November 22, 1873; Peckham's last words were reported to be, \"Wife, we have to die, let us die bravely.\" His remains were never recovered, and a cenotaph was erected at Albany Rural Cemetery in Menands, New York.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "357847", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=357847", "title": "Shenzhou 6", "text": "Shenzhou 6\n\nShenzhou 6 ( \"Shénzhōu lìuhào\") was the second human spaceflight of the Chinese space program, launched on October 12, 2005 on a Long March 2F rocket from the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center. The Shenzhou spacecraft carried a crew of Fèi Jùnlóng (费俊龙) and Niè Hǎishèng (聂海胜) for five days in low Earth orbit. It launched three days before the second anniversary of China's first human spaceflight, \"Shenzhou 5\".\n\nThe crew were able to change out of their new lighter space suits, conduct scientific experiments, and enter the orbital module for the first time, giving them access to toilet facilities. The exact activities of the crew were kept secret but were thought by some to include military reconnaissance, however this is likely untrue given that similar experiments in the US and USSR determined that humans are not suited for military reconnaissance. It landed in the Siziwang Banner of Inner Mongolia on October 16, 2005, the same site as the previous manned and unmanned Shenzhou flights.\n\nThis is the first spaceflight for both crew members. The crew was introduced to the Chinese public and international media about five hours before the launch. Niè Hǎishèng celebrated his 41st birthday in space.\n\nHuang Chunping, the chief designer of the Long March 2F rocket, was quoted in the \"Beijing Times\" as saying the crew members who would fly the mission were selected from a pool of three pairs. Five pairs of astronauts trained for the flight and about one month before launch the two pairs with the lowest performance were dropped. The \"Ta Kung Pao\" newspaper had reported that Zhai Zhigang and Nie Haisheng were the leading pair, after having been in the final group of three for \"Shenzhou 5\".\n\nThe crew arrived at the spacecraft about 2 hours and 45 minutes before the launch and the hatch closed 30 minutes after their arrival. At 01:00:05.583 UTC on October 12 \"Shenzhou 6\" lifted off from the launch pad at Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center. The launch phase was reported to be normal with the escape rocket separating 120 seconds after launch when the rocket was travelling 1,300 m/s (4300 ft/s). Sixteen seconds later the four booster rockets separated at an altitude of . The payload fairing and first stage detached 200 seconds after launch. The second stage burned for a further 383 seconds and the spacecraft separated from the rocket above the Yellow Sea. The spacecraft then used its own propulsion system to place it into a 211 km by 345 km (131 by 214 statute miles) orbit, with an inclination of 42.4 degrees, about 21 minutes after launch. At 01:39 UTC Chen Bingde, the Chief Commander of the Chinese space program, announced the launch was successful. The crew ate their first meal in space at 03:11 UTC.\n\nBefore the flight, the launch time had been the object of speculation by the Chinese media. For several months before the planned launch its time was only given as mid-October, or even late-September. Then on September 23 it was reported by the Hong Kong-based news agency \"China News Service\" that the launch was tentatively scheduled for 03:00 UTC on October 13. This launch time was confirmed two weeks later by Jiang Jingshan, a member of the Chinese Academy of Engineering. But then on October 10 an official from the technical department of the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center said the launch was then scheduled for 01:00 UTC on October 12. This new launch time could have been designed to dodge the cold weather which had been forecast to hit the area. Assembly of the rocket was reported complete on September 26. On October 4, the \"Shenzhou 6\" spacecraft was attached to the CZ-2F rocket, also known as \"Shenjian\".\n\nUnlike the unmanned Shenzhou flights, \"Shenzhou 5\" and \"6\" were launched during daylight hours to provide greater safety in case of abort. The launch was televised live with China Central Television selling advertising for RMB¥2.56 million (US$316,000) for five seconds, to RMB¥8.56 million (US$1 million) for 30 seconds. A video camera had been added to the rocket and images of it were broadcast during the ascent and the separation of the Shenzhou spacecraft.\n\nShortly after launch, recovery crews began searching a region from the Badain Jaran Desert in Inner Mongolia to Shaanxi for the launch escape tower, booster rockets, first stage and payload fairing. Of particular interest was the \"black box\" of the rocket, which contained telemetry that may not have been downlinked during the launch phase. It was found 45 minutes after launch somewhere near Otog Banner. It was first sighted by a herdswoman, Lian Hua, about 1.5 km from her home. Other wreckage from the launch was found and destroyed at its impact location or brought back to Jiuquan.\n\nGeneral Secretary and President Hu Jintao was present at the Beijing Aerospace Control Center to watch the launch. Premier Wen Jiabao was present at the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center.\n\nThe first of several orbit changing maneuvers happened as planned at 07:54:45, with a 63-second burn to circularize the orbit. Based on United States Space Command orbital elements, it was in a 332 by 336 km (206 by 209 statute miles) orbit. After about an hour and a half, the hatch between the re-entry and orbital modules was opened and, for the first time, crew were able to enter the second living compartment of the Shenzhou spacecraft. Fèi Jùnlóng was the first to enter, while Niè Hǎishèng remained in the reentry module. They would swap positions about three hours later.\n\nAt 13:32 UTC, Niè and Fèi had a seven-minute conversation with their wives and children who were in Mission Control. Niè's daughter sang \"Happy Birthday to You\", as his birthday is October 13.\n\nThe activities of the crew were not fully revealed by the Chinese. Only vague references to experiments were made, though some were made public. One experiment involved the crew testing the reaction of the spacecraft to movement within the orbital and reentry modules. They moved between the modules, opening and closing the hatches and operating equipment with \"more strength\" than normally required.\n\nA second orbital maneuver occurred at 21:56 on October 13. It raised the orbit that had been lowered due to atmospheric drag, and lasted 6.5 seconds.\n\nOn October 15, Niè and Fèi had a two-minute conversation with General Secretary and President Hu Jintao, beginning at 08:29. During the conversation, Hu told them \"The motherland and people are proud of you. I hope you will successfully complete your task by carrying out the mission calmly and carefully and have a triumphant return\".\n\nThe re-entry process began at 19:44 on October 16 when the orbital module separated as planned from the rest of the spacecraft. Unlike with the Soyuz spacecraft, this is done before the re-entry burn, allowing the orbital module to stay in orbit for extended months-long missions or to act as a docking target for later flights. The orbital module fired its engines twice on October 19 to give it a circular orbit with a height of .\n\nOne minute after this separation, the engines on the service module ignited over the coast of West Africa to slow the spacecraft. At 20:07, the re-entry module separated and five minutes later the re-entry proper began, as the Shenzhou capsule entered the top of the atmosphere, over China. The communications blackout that occurs during re-entry started at 20:16 and two minutes later radio communication was regained with the spacecraft. The main parachute opened and the capsule began to slowly descend to a landing on the Inner Mongolia northern grasslands at 4:33 a.m. local time (20:33 UTC). The capsule landed approximately 1 km (about 1000 yards) from its planned target.\n\nAbout half an hour after landing, the recovery forces had the hatch of the spacecraft open and first Fèi, and then Niè emerged. Hou Ying, chief designer of the landing site system, said the recovery was improved over that of \"Shenzhou 5\". After medical check-ups and a light meal the astronauts were put on a special plane bound for Beijing, where they were placed into medical isolation for the following two weeks. At 21:46, Chen Bingde had declared the entire mission to be a success.\n\nThe capsule was returned to Beijing by train and handed over to China Research Institute of Space Technology at Changping railway station.\n\nThe orbital module continued to orbit the Earth, gathering more information from experiments on board. The module also gave Chinese mission controllers experience at long-duration spaceflights. After 2,920 orbits of the Earth, its active mission ended on April 15, 2006. It is still in orbit, and will reenter when its orbit sufficiently decays.\n\nThere were two planned landing sites for the mission. The primary site was the banner of Siziwang in Inner Mongolia. The secondary site was at the Jiuquan launch site. In addition, there were recovery forces at Yinchuan, Yulin and Handan. It is also possible for the Shenzhou spacecraft to splashdown in the ocean should the need arise, with further recovery crews in the Yellow Sea, the East China Sea and the Pacific Ocean.\n\nSome Chinese diplomats are trained and equipped for any emergency landing at sites that are not on Chinese territory. Zhang Shuting, chief designer of the emergency and rescue system, has said that emergency landing sites have been identified in Australia, Southwest Asia, North Africa, Western Europe, the United States and South America. The diplomatic mission nearest to the landing site will be given the task to head any rescue mission if necessary. The Chinese government had advised Australia that emergency landing sites have been identified in New South Wales, Queensland, the Northern Territory and Western Australia. Emergency Management Australia, the Australian government agency that co-ordinates the response to major contingencies, has said they are ready to deal with any emergencies that arise during spaceflights. However, the return module is designed to allow access from the outside only to those with a special key. A copy of this key has not been made available to Australian officials, but it was reported that an unnamed Chinese military attaché at the Chinese embassy in Canberra had one.\n\nAs with previous Shenzhou series, Chinese military is heavily involved, and in official Chinese documents, project managers are referred as project commanders instead:\n\nThe Chinese space officials have said that the Long March 2F rocket featured a \"fire security system\" on the escape tower. Speculation on what this means ranges from better fail-safes to stop accidental firings, to the addition of a fire extinguisher. The \"Wen Wei Po\" newspaper have reported that the rocket appeared the same as that used for \"Shenzhou 5\" except that a \"transition segment\" was visible at the top of the \"Shenzhou 6\" stack, attached to one end of the orbital module.\n\nChina Aerospace Science and Technology, the major manufacturer of both the Shenzhou spacecraft and the Long March rocket have said that although the flight featured a second astronaut and was much longer than \"Shenzhou 5\", the rocket and spacecraft did not weigh much more due to optimisation of its systems. Only 200 kg (about 440 lb) more was needed for the second astronaut. Among the amenities on board for the crew was hot food, sleeping bags and essential sanitary equipment. The sleeping bag was hooked to a wall of the orbital module and the crew had alternating sleep periods. The shock absorbers in the crew seats were redesigned so as to provide more safety to the crew in case the braking rockets fail to fire just before touchdown. The flight telemetry recorder on the spacecraft had its memory increased to about 1 gigabyte, and the read/write speed was now 10 times as fast as the computers carried on previous flights. It was also about half the size of that carried on \"Shenzhou 5\". Overall, 95% of the Shenzhou 6 space capsule is indigenously designed/produced in China, the highest rate in comparison to the previous ones.\n\nThe menu included pineapple-filled mooncakes, green vegetables, braised bamboo shoots, rice, and bean congee. In total there was 40 kg (about 88 lb) of food on board. A somewhat strange aspect of the mission reported in the Chinese press was the fixation on the purity of drinking water for the astronauts, where it was claimed that their water reportedly comes from a mine underground and was disinfected with an electrolytic silver solution. It has thus been said by the press that they are drinking the \"purest water in China\".\n\nIt had been reported that, on \"Shenzhou 5\", astronaut Yang Liwei suffered from a \"minor heartache\" after his launch. It is thought that this refers to space adaptation syndrome experienced by about one third of astronauts during the first few days of a spaceflight. The \"People's Daily\" said that the interior design of the spacecraft has been changed to hopefully lessen the likelihood of nausea and other symptoms.\n\nIt was announced in July 2005 that \"Shenzhou 6\" would carry one experiment involving the sperm of pigs from Rongchang County, Chongqing. But on October 11 it was revealed by Liu Luxiang, director of the Centre for Space Breeding at the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, that there were no plans for animal or plant seeds on the flight. He said the focus of \"Shenzhou 6\" was the physical reactions of the crew to the space environment. This was seemingly contradicted a year and a half after the flight when sweet potatoes started being sold for Valentine's Day that had been grown from seeds reportedly taken on the flight.\n\nMorris Jones who writes for SpaceDaily.com has speculated that the lack of any other announced experiments suggested that the mission could be oriented more toward the military. The crew could have operated a large surveillance film camera, supplementing the unmanned recoverable satellite program.\n\nThere are 20 land-based tracking stations in the Chinese space telemetry network. These are supplemented by four \"Yuanwang\"-series tracking ships. The Beijing Aerospace Command and Control Center global map showed their positions to be:\n\nOnly one other land-based tracking station is outside China — at Swakopmund in Namibia.\n\nShortly after the \"Shenzhou 5\" flight in 2003, the Pacific nation of Kiribati established diplomatic ties with the Republic of China (Taiwan), leading the People's Republic of China (PRC) to cut off diplomatic ties under its One-China policy. Following this, the PRC has dismantled a tracking station that had been built on Tarawa, the capital island of Kiribati, to track spaceflights.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "5635076", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5635076", "title": "Syntrophy", "text": "Syntrophy\n\nSyntrophy, synthrophy, cross-feeding, or cross feeding [Greek \"syn\" meaning together, \"trophe\" meaning nourishment] is the phenomenon that one species lives off the products of another species. In this association, the growth of one partner is improved, or depends on the nutrients, growth factors or substrate provided by the other partner. Jan Dolfing described syntrophy as \"the critical interdependency between producer and consumer\". This term for nutritional interdependence is often used in microbiology to describe this symbiotic relationship between bacterial species. Morris \"et al\". have described the process as \"obligately mutualistic metabolism\".\n\nSyntrophy plays an important role in a large number of microbial processes.\n\nThe defining feature of ruminants, such as cows and goats, is a stomach called a rumen. The rumen contains billions of microbes, many of which are syntrophic. One excellent example of this syntrophy is interspecies hydrogen transfer. Some anaerobic fermenting microbes in the rumen (and other gastrointestinal tracts) are capable of degrading organic matter to short chain fatty acids, and hydrogen. The accumulating hydrogen inhibits the microbe's ability to continue degrading organic matter, but syntrophic hydrogen-consuming microbes allow continued growth by metabolizing the waste products. In addition, fermentative bacteria gain maximum energy yield when protons are used as electron acceptor with concurrent H production. Hydrogen-consuming organisms include methanogens, sulfate-reducers, acetogens, and others. Some fermentation products, such as fatty acids longer than two carbon atoms, alcohols longer than one carbon atom, and branched-chain and aromatic fatty acids, cannot directly be used in methanogenesis. In acetogenesis process, these products are oxidized to acetate and H by obligated proton reducing bacteria in syntrophic relationship with methanogenic archaea as low H partial pressure is essential for acetogenic reactions to be thermodynamically favorable (ΔG < 0). (Stams et al., 2005)\n\nThe number of bacterial cells that live on or in the human body, for example throughout the alimentary canal and on the skin, is in the region of 10 times the total number of human cells in it. These microbes are vital, for instance for the digestive and the immune system to function.\n\nAnother example is the many organisms that feed on faeces or dung. A cow diet consists mainly of grass, the cellulose of which is transformed into lipids by micro-organisms in the cow's large intestine. These micro-organisms cannot use the lipids because of lack of oxygen in the intestine, so the cow does not take up all lipids produced. When the processed grass leaves the intestine as dung and comes into open air, many organisms, such as the dung beetle, feed on it.\n\nYet another example is the community of micro-organisms in soil that live off leaf litter. Leaves typically last one year and are then replaced by new ones. These micro-organisms mineralize the discarded leaves and release nutrients that are taken up by the plant. Such relationships are called reciprocal syntrophy because the plant lives off the products of micro-organisms. Many symbiotic relationships are based on syntrophy.\n\nSyntrophic microbial food webs can play an integral role in the breakdown of organic pollutants such as oils, aromatic compounds, and amino acids.\n\nEnvironmental contamination with oil is of high ecological importance, but can be mediated through syntrophic degradation. Alkanes are hydrocarbon chains that are the major chemical component of crude oils, and have been experimentally verified to be broken down by syntrophic microbial food webs. The hydrocarbons of the oil are broken down after activation by fumarate, a chemical compound that is regenerated by other microorganisms. Without regeneration, the microbes degrading the oil would eventually run out of fumarate and the process would cease. This breakdown is crucial in the processes of bioremediation and global carbon cycling.\n\nSyntrophic microbial communities are key players in the breakdown of aromatic compounds, which are common pollutants. The degradation of aromatic benzoate to methane produces many intermediate compounds such as formate, acetate, CO2 and H2. The build up of these products makes benzoate degradation progressively less favourable. These intermediates can then be taken up and metabolized syntrophically by methanogens to make the whole process more thermodynamically favourable.\n\nStudies have shown that bacterial degradation of amino acids can be significantly enhanced through the process of syntrophy. Microbes growing poorly on amino acid substrates alanine, aspartate, serine, leucine, valine, and glycine can have their rate of growth dramatically increased by syntrophic H scavengers. These scavengers, like \"Methanospirillum and Acetobacterium,\" metabolize the H2 waste produced during amino acid breakdown, preventing a toxic build-up. Another way to improve amino acid breakdown is through interspecies electron transfer mediated by formate. Species like \"Desulfovibrio\" employ this method.\n\nThe main motive behind a syntrophic relation between two bacterial organisms is generalized as a relationship where each participant's metabolic activity cannot independently overcome the thermodynamic pressure of the reaction under standard conditions even when a cosubstrate or nutrient is added into the environment. Therefore, the cooperation of the other participant is required to reduce the intermediate pool size.\nThe \"Methanobacillus omelianskii\" culture is a classic example in demonstrating how two separate unfavourable reactions can be carried out by syntrophic interactions. Strain S and strain M.o.H of \"Methanobacillus omelianskii\" oxidize ethanol into acetate and methane by a process called interspecies hydrogen transfer. Individuals of strain S are observed as obligate anaerobic bacteria that use ethanol as an electron donor, whereas organisms of strain M.o.H are methanogens that oxidize hydrogen gas to produce methane. These two metabolic reactions can be shown as follows:\n<br>\nComplex organic compounds such as ethanol, propionate, butyrate, and lactate cannot be directly used as substrates for methanogenesis by methanogens. On the other hand, fermentation of these organic compounds cannot occur in fermenting microorganisms unless the hydrogen concentration is reduced to a low level by the methanogens. In this case, hydrogen, an electron-carrying compound (mediator) is transported from the fermenting bacteria to the methanogen through a process called mediated interspecies electron transfer (MIET), where the mediator is carried down a concentration gradient created by a thermodynamically favourable coupled redox reaction.\n"}

As the blows are not given by the same person but by the parties themselves, the strongest-armed one actually has an unfair (but not always decisive) physical advantage.\n\nSuch rather macho displays of willpower, restraining the instinct to avoid pain, can serve various purposes, including:\n\nAnother game with the same name is often played among boys or young men, where two people agree on a place to hit the other (e.g. the shoulder or chest) and the two take turns trading punches until one person cannot stand the pain any longer.

He was murdered by poison after a ten year rule.\n\nTugstumur Khan ascended the throne in 1378 during a tumultuous period between Mongolia and China. Tugstumur took the title Uskhal and instituted negotiations and military exercises to foster unity among the Mongolian provinces. Intent on increasing the size of his military, Tugstumur Uskhal recruited soldiers from Karakhorum and Incheon to prepare for operations in China.\n\nThe Chinese government also escalated their military preparations. In 1380 the Chinese sent soldiers to maneuver along the border and to penetrate into Mongolia. Under the guidance of general Mu-In, Chinese divisions invaded Mongolia. Light cavalry successfully occupied Karakhorum, ravaged several provinces, and took many Mongolians prisoner. At that time, Tugstumur Khan had based his center of operations in Incheon. He ordered Mongolian commanders Ulzibukh and Narbukh to attack Luleen in the eastern part of China’s Khebei province, where they assassinated China’s Lyu-Guan, a military commander of the Min state.\n\nIn 1381, the Min State retaliated. Under the leadership of commander Cyuie-Da, Chinese forces penetrated Chiphen. During the following six years (1382-1387), Mongolia and China rested from wartime antagonism and retribution, and the Min state maneuvered into position. In 1384 the Gaoli state submitted to the Min Empire and severed their diplomatic relations with Mongolia. Nagachug, a relative of Mukhulai (son-in-law or aristocrats), controlled numerous forces and occupied the land to intimidate the Gaoli state and maneuver into their territory.\n\nThe Min state was wary of possible unity between Tugstumur Khan and Nagachug. Min was concerned that such a unity could potentially overcome Min military forces. Therefore, Min decided to focus his efforts on the annihilation of Nagachug's armies. By 1387, the Min state had concentrated its forces in Lyaodun to destroy commander Nagachug’s military forces in the Yuan state. In 1384, two thousand Chinese soldiers under the command of Phen Shen fought against Nagachug’s armies; both sides suffered severe casualties. However, Chinese forces had succeeded in gaining better battlefield position, and Nagachug’s armies, finding themselves in a hopeless situation, surrendered.\n\nSubsequently, the Min state began to position its main forces against Tugstumur Khan. By the spring of 1388, Mongolia and Min engaged in a campaign that ended Tumgstumur's ambitions for control of Min China. Suffering a terrible defeat, Tugstumur Khan, his eldest son, associated dignitaries, and a few surviving soldiers were forced to retreat toward Kharkhorum. Tugstumur's second son was captured along with Tugstumur's leading minister and lords. In all, the Chinese took nearly three thousand people prisoner and over one hundred fifty thousand head of cattle as war prizes.\n\nWhen Tugstumur Khan reached the Tuul River, he was attacked by Esunder, lord of the Argbukh origin. Conscious of the weakness in his military force, Tugstumur Khan set out to unite with the armies of commander Markhas. Unfortunately, a three-day snowstorm barred Tugstumur Khan's advance. Ultimately, Esunder dispatched a courier to capture Tugstumur Khan. The courier poisoned Tugstumur Khan in 1388.\n"}

The name \"Oscar\" was given by the crew of the British destroyer HMS \"Cossack\" that rescued him from the sea following the sinking of the German battleship \"Bismarck\". \"Oscar\" was derived from the International Code of Signals for the letter 'O', which is code for \"Man Overboard\" (the German spelling, \"Oskar\", was sometimes used since he was a \"German\" cat).\n\nThe black and white patched cat was supposedly owned by an unknown crewman of the German battleship \"Bismarck\" and was on board the ship on 18 May 1941 when she set sail on Operation \"Rheinübung\" (German for Rhine Exercise), \"Bismarck\"'s only mission. \"Bismarck\" was sunk after a fierce sea-battle on 27 May, from which only 115 from her crew of over 2,100 survived. Hours later, Oscar was found floating on a board and picked from the water by the British destroyer HMS \"Cossack\". Unaware of what his name had been on \"Bismarck\", the crew of \"Cossack\" named their new mascot \"Oscar\".\n\nThe cat served on board \"Cossack\" for the next few months as the ship carried out convoy escort duties in the Mediterranean Sea and north Atlantic Ocean. On 24 October 1941, \"Cossack\" was escorting a convoy from Gibraltar to Great Britain when she was severely damaged by a torpedo fired by the . Crew were transferred to the destroyer , and an attempt was made to tow the badly listing \"Cossack\" back to Gibraltar. However, worsening weather conditions meant the task became impossible and had to be abandoned. On 27 October, a day after the tow was slipped, \"Cossack\" sank to the west of Gibraltar. The initial explosion had blown off one third of the forward section of the ship, killing 159 of the crew, but Oscar survived this too and was brought to the shore establishment in Gibraltar.\n\nNow nicknamed \"Unsinkable Sam\", the cat was soon transferred to the aircraft carrier , which coincidentally had been instrumental in the destruction of \"Bismarck\" (along with \"Cossack\"). However, Sam was to find no more luck there, and when returning from Malta on 14 November 1941 this ship too was torpedoed, this time by . Attempts were also made to tow \"Ark Royal\" to Gibraltar, but the unstoppable inflow of water made the task futile. The carrier rolled over and sank 30 miles from Gibraltar. The slow rate at which the ship sank meant that all but one of the crew could be saved. The survivors, including Sam, who had been found clinging to a floating plank by a motor launch and described as \"angry but quite unharmed\", were transferred to HMS \"Lightning\" and the same HMS \"Legion\" which had rescued the crew of \"Cossack\". \"Legion\" would itself be sunk in 1942, and \"Lightning\" in 1943.\n\nThe loss of \"Ark Royal\" proved the end of Sam's shipborne career. He was transferred first to the offices of the Governor of Gibraltar and then sent back to the United Kingdom, where he saw out the remainder of the war living in a seaman's home in Belfast called the \"Home for Sailors\". Sam died in 1955. A pastel portrait of Sam (titled \"Oscar, the Bismarck's Cat\") by the artist Georgina Shaw-Baker is in the possession of the National Maritime Museum in Greenwich.\n\nSome authorities question whether Oskar/Sam's biography might be a \"sea story\", because – for example – there are pictures of two different cats identified as Oskar/Sam. The sinking of \"Bismarck\" and rescue of a limited number of survivors took place in desperate conditions; British ships were ordered not to stop as there was believed to be a U-boat in the area, and many survivors were left to die of exposure. Pointedly, there is no mention of this incident in Ludovic Kennedy's detailed account of the sinking, suggesting that information later gleaned from sailors regarding the cat's true service were apocryphal.\n\n"}

In such methods, each of the neural network's weights receives an update proportional to the partial derivative of the error function with respect to the current weight in each iteration of training. The problem is that in some cases, the gradient will be vanishingly small, effectively preventing the weight from changing its value. In the worst case, this may completely stop the neural network from further training. As one example of the problem cause, traditional activation functions such as the hyperbolic tangent function have gradients in the range , and backpropagation computes gradients by the chain rule. This has the effect of multiplying of these small numbers to compute gradients of the \"front\" layers in an -layer network, meaning that the gradient (error signal) decreases exponentially with while the front layers train very slowly.\n\nBack-propagation allowed researchers to train supervised deep artificial neural networks from scratch, initially with little success. Hochreiter's diploma thesis of 1991 formally identified the reason for this failure in the \"vanishing gradient problem\", which not only affects many-layered feedforward networks, but also recurrent networks. The latter are trained by unfolding them into very deep feedforward networks, where a new layer is created for each time step of an input sequence processed by the network.\n\nWhen activation functions are used whose derivatives can take on larger values, one risks encountering the related exploding gradient problem.\n\nTo overcome this problem, several methods were proposed. One is Jürgen Schmidhuber's multi-level hierarchy of networks (1992) pre-trained one level at a time through unsupervised learning, fine-tuned through backpropagation. Here each level learns a compressed representation of the observations that is fed to the next level.\n\nSimilar ideas have been used in feed-forward neural network for unsupervised pre-training to structure a neural network, making it first learn generally useful feature detectors. Then the network is trained further by supervised back-propagation to classify labeled data. The deep belief network model by Hinton et al. (2006) involves learning the distribution of a high level representation using successive layers of binary or real-valued latent variables. It uses a restricted Boltzmann machine to model each new layer of higher level features. Each new layer guarantees an increase on the lower-bound of the log likelihood of the data, thus improving the model, if trained properly. Once sufficiently many layers have been learned the deep architecture may be used as a generative model by reproducing the data when sampling down the model (an \"ancestral pass\") from the top level feature activations.\nHinton reports that his models are effective feature extractors over high-dimensional, structured data. This work played a key role in reintroducing interest in deep neural network research and consequently led to the developments of Deep learning, although deep belief network is no longer the primary deep learning technique.\n\nAnother technique particularly used for recurrent neural networks is the long short-term memory (LSTM) network of 1997 by Hochreiter & Schmidhuber. In 2009, deep multidimensional LSTM networks demonstrated the power of deep learning with many nonlinear layers, by winning three ICDAR 2009 competitions in connected handwriting recognition, without any prior knowledge about the three different languages to be learned.\n\nHardware advances have meant that from 1991 to 2015, computer power (especially as delivered by GPUs) has increased around a million-fold, making standard backpropagation feasible for networks several layers deeper than when the vanishing gradient problem was recognized. Schmidhuber notes that this \"is basically what is winning many of the image recognition competitions now\", but that it \"does not really\novercome the problem in a fundamental way\" since the original models tackling the vanishing gradient problem by Hinton et al. (2006) were trained in a Xeon processor, not GPUs.\n\nOne of the newest and most effective ways to resolve the vanishing gradient problem is with residual neural networks, ResNets, not to be confused with recurrent neural networks. It was noted prior to ResNets that a deeper network would actually have higher \"training\" error than the shallow network. This intuitively can be understood as data disappearing through too many layers of the network, meaning output from a shallow layer was diminished through the greater number of layers in the deeper network, yielding a worse result. Going with this intuitive hypothesis, Microsoft research found that splitting a deep network into three layer chunks and passing the input into each chunk straight through to the next chunk, along with the residual-output of the chunk minus the input to the chunk that is reintroduced, helped eliminate much of this disappearing signal problem. No extra parameters or changes to the learning algorithm were needed. ResNets yielded lower training error (and test error) than their shallower counterparts simply by reintroducing outputs from shallower layers in the network to compensate for the vanishing data.\n\nNote that ResNets are an ensemble of relatively shallow Nets and do not resolve the vanishing gradient problem by preserving gradient flow throughout the entire depth of the network – rather, they avoid the problem simply by constructing ensembles of many short networks together. (Ensemble by Construction)\n\nRectifiers such as ReLU suffer less from the vanishing gradient problem, because they only saturate in one direction.\n\nBehnke relied only on the sign of the gradient (Rprop) when training his Neural Abstraction Pyramid to solve problems like image reconstruction and face localization.\n\nNeural networks can also be optimized by using a universal search algorithm on the space of neural network's weights, e.g., random guess or more systematically genetic algorithm. This approach is not based on gradient and avoids the vanishing gradient problem.\n\n"}

His first murder spree occurred near Mahagi, Belgian Congo on January 1, 1954, where he killed 21 people and wounded many more with an axe in less than an hour and a half, before escaping and finally ending up in British Tanganyika Territory, where he assumed a false identity, found work and began a new life.\n\nApparently because of social misunderstandings with his boss, Unek went on a second rampage which began in the early hours of February 11, 1957. Armed with a stolen Enfield-type police rifle, 50 rounds of ammunition, and an axe, he started killing people in the area of Malampaka, a village about 40 miles southeast of Mwanza. He broke into several houses and shot anyone he saw inside.\n\nWithin twelve hours, Unek shot dead ten men, eight women, and eight children, murdered five more men with the axe, stabbed another one, burned two women and a child by trapping them in their house and setting it on fire, and strangled a 15-year-old girl, thus killing a total of 36 people. He then changed out of his police uniform into clothes stolen from one of his victims and fled. Among the dead was reportedly his own wife, whom he killed in their hut before setting it on fire, as well as the wife of a police sergeant.\n\nFor nine days, Unek was sought by Wasukuma tribesmen, police, and eventually a company of the King's African Rifles in Tanganyika's greatest manhunt up to that time.\n\nDespite the extensive search operation, including dogs and aircraft, and a posted reward of $350, Unek eluded his pursuers until he finally showed up at the house of Iyumbu ben Ikumbu, who lived only two miles away from Malampaka, in search for food. When Iyumbu reported the incident to police, he was asked to keep Unek with him and notify them, should the killer come again to his home. Unek, still armed, reappeared at about 1:00 a.m. the next day. Iyumbu, sending his wife to police, gave Unek food and engaged in a conversation with him for nearly two hours until help arrived. At that point, Iyumbu ran out of his house whereupon a Police Superintendent threw a smoke bomb, setting the house on fire. Unek, severely injured when attempting to evade capture, later succumbed to his wounds in hospital. Iyumbu later received a financial reward of £125, as well as the British Empire Medal for his bravery leading to the capture of the constable.\n\nAs response to the murders, a fund was created to help the descendants of those killed and a maternity clinic was built as a memorial for Unek's victims.\n\nHis rampage ranks among the deadliest of the twentieth century.\n\n"}
