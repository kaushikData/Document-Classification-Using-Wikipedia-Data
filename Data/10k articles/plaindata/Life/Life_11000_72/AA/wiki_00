{"id": "1548772", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1548772", "title": "20Q", "text": "20Q\n\n20Q is a computerized game of twenty questions that began as a test in artificial intelligence (AI). It was invented by Robin Burgener in 1988. The game was made handheld by Radica in 2004, but was discontinued in 2011 because Techno Source took the license for 20Q handheld devices.\n\nThe game 20Q is based on the spoken parlor game known as twenty questions, and is both a website and a handheld device. 20Q asks the player to think of something and will then try to guess what they are thinking of with twenty yes-or-no questions. If it fails to guess in 20 questions, it will ask an additional 5 questions. If it fails to guess even with 25 (or 30) questions, the player is declared the winner. Sometimes the first guess of the object can be asked at question 14.\n\nThe principle is that the player thinks of something and the 20Q artificial intelligence asks a series of questions before guessing what the player is thinking. This artificial intelligence learns on its own with the information relayed back to the players who interact with it, and is not programmed. The player can answer these questions with: \"Yes\", \"No\", \"Unknown\", and \"Sometimes.\" The experiment is based on the classic word game of Twenty Questions, and on the computer game \"Animals,\" popular in the early 1970s, which used a somewhat simpler method to guess an animal.\n\nThe 20Q AI uses an artificial neural network to pick the questions and to guess. After the player has answered the twenty questions posed (sometimes fewer), 20Q makes a guess. If it is incorrect, it asks more questions, then guesses again. It makes guesses based on what it has learned; it is not programmed with information or what the inventor thinks. Answers to any question are based on players’ interpretations of the questions asked. Newer editions were made for different categories, such as music 20Q which has the player think of a song, and Harry Potter 20Q, which has the player think of something from the world of the Harry Potter series.\n\nThe 20Q AI can draw its own conclusions on how to interpret the information. It can be described as more of a folk taxonomy than a taxonomy. Its knowledge develops with every game played. In this regard, the online version of the 20Q AI can be inaccurate because it gathers its answers from what people \"think\" rather than from what people \"know\". Limitations of taxonomy are often overcome by the AI itself because it can learn and adapt. For example, if the player was thinking of a \"Horse\" and answered \"No\" to the question \"Is it an animal?,\" the AI will, nevertheless, guess correctly, despite being told that a horse is not an animal.\n\nPatent applications in the US and Europe were submitted in 2005.\n\nIn August 2014, 20Q.net Inc., with Brashworks Studios, developed and released an iOS iPad version available at the Apple ITunes store.\n\nThe built Artificial Neural Network is not resource intensive either to store or to compute, thus it could be embedded in small, less powerful devices. Currently, there is a handheld version of the AI. The device contains a small portion of the original 20Q website knowledge base; unlike the online versions of the game, the handheld version does not have the ability to learn.\n\nThe 20Q artificial intelligence is different from less flexible, and extremely large, expert systems. Its modularity, adaptability, and scalability means that it can be applied to other, more complex devices, for more complex uses.\n\nOn June 13, 2009, GSN began a TV version of the game, hosted by Cat Deeley, with Hal Sparks as the voice of the computer.\n\n"}

His life was described by Theodoret of Cyr (393-466 A.D.), the Bishop of Cyrrhus, who named him among the other thirty holy men and women in his book \"Historia Religiosa\" (Religious History).\n\nHe spent the first part of his life in the desert of Chalcis where he lived an ascetic life, he tried his body by fasting and still standing and was so exhausted that could not move. But then he left for Lebanon as a merchant and helped the inhabitants of the village where he stayed to pay the taxes with the help of his friends. The name of the village is not known but it is believed to be \"Aqura- Afka\". \"It was probably located in \"Aqura\" near the river Adonis.\" He was asked by the villagers to become their tutor and he accepted providing they would build the Christian church.

{"id": "3841944", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3841944", "title": "Agape and Eros", "text": "Agape and Eros\n\nAgape and Eros (Swedish: \"Eros och Agape\") is a treatise written by the Swedish Protestant theologian Anders Nygren, first published in Swedish in two parts in 1930 and 1936. \n\nNygren was one of the theologians who had formed the so-called Lundensian School of Theology, in which other important figures were Gustav Aulén and Ragnar Bring. They all shared a keen interest in rediscovering major motifs of Reformation theology, and examining how such motifs had been employed in different ways throughout history. In this context, Nygren was examining the motif of love.\n\nThe book analyses the connotations of two ancient Greek words for love, \"eros\" and \"agape\" (unconditional love). \n\nNygren argues that \"eros\" is an egocentric and acquisitive kind of love, needs-based and desire-based. When we love out of \"eros\" - whether we love a god or another human being -, we love out of self-interest and in order to acquire and possess the object of our love. This form of love received its classic expression in the philosophy of Plato, particularly in his dialogue The Symposium.\n\n\"Agape\", by contrast, is a self-giving and self-sacrificial kind of love. It is based on God's unconditional love for all creatures. When we love out of \"agape\" we reject all self-gain and interest, and surrender ourselves to the other and love them purely for themselves.\n\nFor Nygren, \"agape\" is the properly Christian understanding of love, as is evident from New Testament texts such as the Synoptic Gospels, Paul's theology of the cross, and the identification of God and \"agape\" in the First Letter of John. Nygren therefore argues that \"agape\" is the only truly Christian kind of love, and that \"eros\" turns us away from God. Either we love others and God in the manner of \"eros\", purely for ourselves, in which case we do not really love them at all; or we love them in the manner of \"agape\", for themselves, with a true love, in which case we act against our own self-interest and happiness.\n\nNygren also traces the historical roots of what he perceives to be the loss of this concept of \"agape\". He argues that from St. Augustine onward, the focus on \"agape\" became diluted by an attempt to synthesize the concept with that of \"eros\", in a development centered on the Latin word \"caritas\". Nygren argues that most medieval theology of love was based around this attempt at a \"caritas\"-synthesis. However, he argues, this is not a truly Christian synthesis, given the origins and nature of \"eros\". The Reformation, therefore, was hugely important because it inspired Martin Luther to expose the fallacy of the \"caritas\" synthesis, and made clear again the properly Christian conception of love, namely pure \"agape\".\n\nThe Original Swedish title is: \"Den kristna kärlekstanken genom tiderna: Eros och Agape\" (which translates as, \"The Christian idea of love through the ages: Eros and Agape\"). It appeared initially in two parts, the first volume in 1930 and the second in 1936. A later reprint reduced the title: \"Eros och Agape\", (Stockholm, 1966)\n\nThe title of the English translation is Agape and Eros, not Eros and Agape. This seems to stem from the first (slightly abridged) translation of the first part: \"Agape and Eros\", translated by A.G. Hebert (London, 1932). The second part was first translated by Philip S. Watson and published in two volumes in 1938-9.\n\nThe first translation of the full work was by Philip S. Watson (London: SPCK, 1953, one volume). A revised edition by the same translator appeared in 1982 (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, and London: SPCK).\n\nVolume one contains two parts:'\nVolume two consists of a single part:\n\nNygren's work has been described as 'probably the most influential Protestant account of love in the twentieth century'. For example, Martin Luther King shows clear influence by Nygren's categories in a sermon where he discussed Jesus' command to love one's enemies:\n\nWhen Jesus bids us to love our enemies, he is speaking neither of \"eros\" not \"philia\", he is speaking of \"agape\", understanding and creative, redemptive goodwill for all men. Only by following this way and responding with this type of love are we able to be children of our Father who is in heaven.\" \n\nA generation later, however, with the work of Paul Tillich and Karl Rahner, Christian theology has turned away from Nygren's stark dualism of \"agape\" and \"eros\" and back towards a more unified conception of love. For example, Pope Benedict XVI in his encyclical, \"Deus caritas est\" (2005), concluded that both \"eros\" and \"agape\" are aspects of divine love.\nCharles W Kegley, ed, \"The Philosophy and Theology of Anders Nygren\", (Carbondale, IL: Southern Illinois University Press, 1970)\n\n \n"}
{"id": "1510069", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1510069", "title": "Antepartum bleeding", "text": "Antepartum bleeding\n\nAntepartum bleeding, also known as antepartum haemorrhage or prepartum hemorrhage, is genital bleeding during pregnancy after the 20th to 24th week of pregnancy up to delivery.\n\nIt can be associated with reduced fetal birth weight. Use of aspirin before 16 weeks of pregnancy to prevent pre-eclampsia also appears effective at preventing antepartum bleeding.\n\nIn regard to treatment, it should be considered a medical emergency (regardless of whether there is pain), as if it is left untreated it can lead to death of the mother or baby.\n\nThe total amount of blood loss and signs of circulatory shock due to blood determine the severity of the antepartum haemorrhaging. There are 4 degrees of antepartum haemorrhaging:\n\nPlacenta praevia refers to when the placenta of a growing foetus is attached abnormally low within the uterus. Intermittent antepartum haemorrhaging occurs in 72% of women living with placenta praevia. The severity of a patient’s placenta praevia depends on the location of placental attachment;\n\nTypes 1 and 2 are classified as minor placental praevia as these typically result in minor antepartum haemorrhaging. Types 3 and 4 are referred to as major placental praevia due to the risk of heavy haemorrhaging in the case of a rupture due to the location of placental attachment. During the third trimester of pregnancy, thinning of the lower uterine segment or contractions caused by cervical dilation can increase the amount of stress placed on the placental attachment to the uterine wall. In patients with placenta praevia, these stresses can cause detachment of the placenta from the uterine wall causing haemorrhaging. To prevent further haemorrhaging patients with major placental praevia are recommended to have a caesarean delivery.\n\nDuring pregnancy the layer of endometrium that attaches directly to developing blastocyst becomes the maternal portion of the placenta, also known as the decidua basalis. In the absence of a decidua basalis, trophoblast cells on the developing blastocyst form an abnormally deep attachment to the uterine wall, this is known as abnormal placentation. Abnormal placentation can categorised into 3 types, depending on the depth of infiltration of the chorionic villi into the uterine wall:\n\nIn placenta percreta, the chorionic villi have grow entirely through the myometrium and invade into the perimetrium. Placenta percreta results in the most intense haemorrhaging that can be expected caused by abnormal placentation. In the event of placental detachment from the uterine wall, the depth of chorionic villi attachment dictates the amount of haemorrhaging that can be expected. The chance of abnormal placentation increases in subsequent pregnancies, if there is scar tissue present from previous pregnancies. For example, previously undergoing a caesarean or placenta previa increases the likelihood of abnormal placentation, therefore increasing the chances of antepartum haemorrhaging.\n\nPlacental abruption occurs when the placenta detaches from the endometrium. Detachment causes antepartum haemorrhaging at the location of abruption. Depending on the site of detachment, haemorrhaging may or may not be apparent. If abruption occurs behind the placenta where blood cannot escape through the cervix, blood will pool and form a retroplacental clot. Only when the site of detachment occurs on the side facing the cervical opening can the total amount of haemorrhaging be measured by vaginal bleeding. Using vaginal bleeding as a measurement of the severity of the placental abruption is therefore ineffective. The scale of haemorrhaging depends on the degree to which the placenta has separated from the uterine wall. In the case of partial placental separation, haemorrhaging can be minor. However, in the case of total placental separation haemorrhaging will be major and emergency delivery will typically be the course of action. Placental abruption causes blood loss from the mother and loss of oxygen and nutrients to the placenta occasionally leading to preterm labour. Other causes of placental abruption can be abdominal trauma or sudden decompression of amniotic fluid, however it is not uncommon for the cause of placental abruption to be unknown.\n\nVasa previa is the presence of unprotected foetal blood vessels running along the placenta and over the internal cervical opening. Vasa previa is a very rare, presenting only 4:10,000 cases from the largest study of the condition. Risks of antepartum bleeding due to vasa previa greatly increase during the third trimester of pregnancy during cervical dilation or placenta previa. Vessel rupture is very likely in the event of a membranous rupture as foetal blood vessels aren’t protected by the umbilical cord of the placenta. In the event of foetal vessel rupture, antepartum haemorrhaging occurs however blood is lost from the foetal blood supply. If the foetus is developed enough caesarean sections are often recommended.\n\n\nA circumvallate placenta refers to when the foetal membrane wraps twice around, over the foetal side around the edge of the placenta. This is to compensate for an undersized chorionic plate resulting in a decreased nutritional supply to the foetus. Thickening of the placental edge due to a circumvallate placenta can lead to placental abruption, causing antepartum haemorrhaging.\n\n\nA bilobed placenta has a cleavage in the middle dividing it into two lobes with membranous vessels branching in between. The exposed connecting membranous vessels present risk of rupturing due to limited protection from thrombosis and trauma. Bilobing of the placenta can be caused by placental implantation occurring over areas of uterine fibroid scarring, previous surgery, decreased blood supply or implantation occurring over the internal cervical orifice. Chances of vasa previa and placental abruption increase in the presence of a bilobed placenta due to decreased surface area for attachment to the uterine wall and the exposure of membranous vessels.\n\n\nWhen a placenta has multiple lobes which are distal and not of equal size this is referred to as a succenturiate placenta. Distal lobes are connected by a placental artery and vein extending from the main placenta, which tends to be centrally located and is the largest in mass. At the time of contraction or delivery the connecting placental arteries and veins may rupture resulting in significant haemorrhaging. Incidences of vasa previa and haemorrhaging in the presence of a succenturiate placenta are highly increased.\n\n\nCervical ectropion\n\nThere are 2 types of epithelial cells present within the cervical canal. In the endocervix the epithelia is columnar glandular which transitions into stratified squamous towards the ectocervix and external cervical orifice. During cervical ectropion the epithelial transitional zone (also called the squamo-columnar junction) migrates from the endocervical canal towards the ectocervix exposing some columnar glandular cells on the external cervical orifice. Unlike stratified squamous epithelial cells, glandular cells are columnar and not used to external stresses such as abrasion. The translocation of these cells causes bleeding and mucus secretion. Cervical ectropion can be attributed to rises in oestrogen levels during foetal development. Antepartum haemorrhage caused by cervical ectropion can be expected and is typically harmless.\n\nVaginal infection\n\nThe presence of severe vaginal infections at the time of pregnancy may cause minor antepartum haemorrhaging. For example the presence of chlamydia, thrush, cervicitis or other infections are all irritants to the vaginal and cervical lining, causing bleeding from those surfaces where the infection is severe.\n\nCervical canal and distal genital tract\n\nMost cases of Antepartum haemorrhaging originate from within the cervical canal or vagina. The amount of bleeding in these areas are typically limited to spotting or minor antepartum haemorrhaging. Cervical ectropion, dysplasia, polyps or cervical carcinoma may cause lesions in the cervix leading to minor haemorrhaging or spotting. Abrasion or slight trauma caused by intercourse, clinical examinations and pap smear may also cause spotting from the cervix. Vaginal bleeding from atrophy, vaginitis, and ulcers also attribute to minor haemorrhaging. Similarly, varicosities, tumours or inflammation in the vulva can cause minor antepartum haemorrhaging. Non genital tract bleeding caused by haematuria or haemorrhoids can often be mistaken for antepartum haemorrhaging and are typically harmless.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "198354", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=198354", "title": "Bob Clampett", "text": "Bob Clampett\n\nRobert Emerson Clampett (May 8, 1913 – May 2, 1984) was an American animator, producer, director, and puppeteer best known for his work on the \"Looney Tunes\" animated series from Warner Bros., and the television shows \"Time for Beany\" and \"Beany and Cecil\". Clampett was born and raised not far from Hollywood, and early on expressed an interest in animation and puppetry. After leaving high school a few months shy of graduating in 1931, Clampett joined the team at Harman-Ising Productions and began working on the studio's newest short subjects, titled \"Looney Tunes\" and \"Merrie Melodies\".\n\nClampett was promoted to a directorial position in 1937 and during his fifteen years at the studio, directed 84 cartoons later deemed classic and designed some of the studio's most famous characters, including Porky Pig, Daffy Duck, and Tweety. Among Clampett's most acclaimed films are \"Porky in Wackyland\" (1938), \"Coal Black and de Sebben Dwarfs\" (1943) and \"The Great Piggy Bank Robbery\" (1946). Clampett left Warner Bros. Cartoons in 1946 and turned his attention to television, creating the famous puppet show \"Time for Beany\" in 1949. A later animated version of the series, titled \"Beany and Cecil\", initially broadcast on ABC in 1962 and was rerun until 1967. Well-loved by millions, the series is considered the first fully creator-driven television series, and carried the byline \"a Bob Clampett Cartoon\".\n\nIn his later years, Clampett toured college campuses and animation festivals as a lecturer on the history of animation. His Warner cartoons have seen renewed praise in decades since for their surrealistic qualities, energetic and outrageous animation, and irreverent humor. Animation historian Jerry Beck lauded Clampett for \"putting the word 'looney' in \"Looney Tunes\".\"\n\nRobert Emerson Clampett was born in San Diego, California on May 8, 1913, to Robert Caleb Clampett and Mildred Joan Merrifield. The elder Clampett was born in Nenagh, County Tipperary, Ireland in 1882, and immigrated to the United States with his parents at age two in 1884. Clampett was displaying extraordinary art skills by the age of five. From the beginning, Clampett was intrigued with and influenced by Douglas Fairbanks, Lon Chaney, Charlie Chaplin, Buster Keaton and Harold Lloyd, and he began making film short-subjects in his garage beginning when he was twelve. While living in Hollywood as a young boy, Clampett and his mother Joan lived next door to Charlie Chaplin and his brother Sydney Chaplin. Clampett also recalled watching his father play handball at the Los Angeles Athletic Club with another of the great silent comedians, Harold Lloyd. From his early teens Clampett showed an interest in animation and puppetry. Clampett made hand puppets as a child, and before adolescence had completed what animation historian Milt Gray describes as \"a sort of prototype, a kind of nondescript dinosaur sock puppet that later evolved into Cecil.\" In high school, Clampett drew a full-page comic about the nocturnal adventures of a pussycat, later published in color in a Sunday edition of the \"Los Angeles Times\". King Features took note and offered Clampett a \"cartoonist's contract\" to begin a seventy-five dollars a week after high school. King Features allowed Clampett to work in their Los Angeles art department on Saturdays and vacations during high school. On occasion, King Features would print one of Clampett's cartoons for encouragement. In addition, they paid his way through Otis Art Institute, where Clampett learned to paint with oils and to sculpt.\n\nClampett attended both Glendale High School and Hoover High School in Glendale, California but left Hoover a few months short of graduating in 1931. Afterwards, Clampett found a job working at a doll factory owned by his aunt, Charlotte Clark. Clark was looking for an appealing item to sell and Clampett suggested Mickey Mouse due to growing popularity. Unable to find a drawing of the character anywhere, Clampett took his sketchpad to the movie theater and came out with several sketches. Clark was concerned with the copyright, so the two drove to the Disney studio. Walt and Roy Disney were delighted and they set up a business not far from the Disney studio. Clampett recalled his short time working for Disney: \"Walt Disney himself sometimes came over in an old car to pick up the dolls; he would give them out to visitors to the studio and at sales meetings. I helped him load the dolls in the car. One time his car, loaded with Mickeys, wouldn't start, and I pushed while Walt steered, until it caught, and he took off.\"\n\nClampett was, in his words, so \"enchanted\" by the new medium of sound cartoons that he instead joined Harman-Ising Studios in 1931 for ten dollars a week. Leon Schlesinger viewed one of Clampett's 16mm films and was impressed, offering him an assistant position at the studio. His first job was animating secondary characters in the first \"Merrie Melodie\", \"Lady, Play Your Mandolin!\" (1931). The same year, Clampett began attending story meetings after submitting an idea eventually used for \"Smile, Darn Ya, Smile!\". The two series were produced at Harman-Ising until mid-1933 when they split into Leon Schlesinger Productions. In his first years at the studio, Clampett mostly worked for Friz Freleng, under whose guidance Clampett grew into an able animator. When he joined Harman-Ising, Bob Clampett was only 17 years old.\n\nBy 1934, Schlesinger was in a bit of a crisis trying to find a well-known cartoon character. He noted that the \"Our Gang\" series consisted of nothing but \"little kids doing things together,\" and a studio-wide drive to get ideas for an animal version of \"Our Gang\" commenced. Clampett submitted a drawing of a pig (Porky) and a black cat (Beans), and, in an imitation of the lettering on a can of Campbell's Pork and Beans, wrote \"Clampett's Porky and Beans.\" Porky debuted in the Friz Freleng-directed \"I Haven't Got a Hat\" in 1935. Around the same time, Schlesinger announced a studio-wide contest, with a money prize to whichever member of the staff turned in the best original story. Clampett's story won first prize and was made into \"My Green Fedora\", also directed by Freleng.\n\nClampett felt encouraged after these successes, and began writing in more story contributions. After Schlesinger realized he needed another unit, he made a deal with Tex Avery, naming Clampett his collaborator. They were moved to a ramshackle building used by gardeners and WB custodial staff for storage of cleaning supplies, solvents, brooms, lawnmowers and other implements. Working apart from the other animators in the small, dilapidated wooden building in the middle of the Vitaphone lot, Avery and Clampett soon discovered they were not the only inhabitants - they shared the building with thousands of tiny termites. They christened the building \"Termite Terrace\", a name eventually used by fans and historians to describe the entire studio. The two soon developed an irreverent style of animation that would set Warner Bros. apart from its competitors. They were soon joined by animators Chuck Jones, Virgil Ross, and Sid Sutherland, and worked virtually without interference on their new, groundbreaking style of humor for the next year. It was a wild place with an almost college fraternity-like atmosphere. Animators would frequently pull pranks such as gluing paper streamers to the wings of flies. Leon Schlesinger, who rarely ventured there, was reputed on one visit to have remarked in his lisping voice, \"Pew, let me out of here! The only thing missing is the sound of a flushing toilet!!\"\n\nOn the side, Clampett directed a sales film, co-animated by Chuck Jones and in-betweened by Robert Cannon. Clampett filmed Cannon in live action as the hero and rotoscoped it into the film. Clampett planned to leave Leon Schlesinger Productions, but Schlesinger offered him a promotion to director and more money if he would stay. Clampett was promoted to director in late 1936, directing a color sequence in the feature \"When's Your Birthday?\" (1937). This led to what was essentially a co-directing stint with fellow animator Chuck Jones for the financially ailing Ub Iwerks, whom Schlesinger subcontracted to produce several Porky Pig shorts. These shorts featured the short-lived and generally unpopular Gabby Goat as Porky's sidekick. Despite Clampett and Jones' contributions, however, Iwerks was the only credited director. Clampett's first cartoon with a directorial credit was \"Porky's Badtime Story\". Under the Warner system, Clampett had complete creative control over his own films, within severe money and time limitations (he was only given $3,000 and four weeks to complete each short). During production of \"Porky's Duck Hunt\" in 1937, Avery created a character that would become Daffy Duck and Clampett animated the character for the first time.\n\nClampett was so popular in theaters that Schlesinger told the other directors to imitate him, emphasizing gags and action. When Tex Avery departed in 1941, Avery's unit was taken over by Clampett, while Norman McCabe took over Clampett's old unit. Clampett finished Avery's remaining unfinished cartoons. When McCabe joined the armed forces, Frank Tashlin rejoined Schlesinger as director, and that unit was eventually turned over to Robert McKimson. Milton Gray notes that from \"The Hep Cat\" (1942) on, the cartoons become even more wild as Clampett's experimentation reached a peak. Clampett later created the character of Tweety, introduced in \"A Tale of Two Kitties\" in 1942. His cartoons grew increasingly violent, irreverent, and surreal, not beholden to even the faintest hint of real-world physics, and his characters have been argued to be easily the most rubbery and wacky of all the Warner directors'. Clampett was heavily influenced by the Spanish surrealist artist Salvador Dalí, as is most visible in \"Porky in Wackyland\" (1938), wherein the entire short takes place within a Dalí-esque landscape complete with melting objects and abstracted forms. Clampett and his work can even be considered part of the surreal movement, as it incorporated film as well as static media. It was largely Clampett's influence that would impel the Warners directors to shed the final vestiges of all Disney influence and enter the territory they are famous for today. Clampett was also famous for doing some brief voices or sound effects in some of the cartoons, the most famous being ending his most famous cartoons with his own joke on impersonating the Warner Bros. zooming in shield sound effect (otherwise known as \"Bay-woop!\"). Clampett liked to bring hip cultural movements into his cartoons, especially jazz; film, magazines, comics, novels, and popular music are referenced in Clampett shorts, most visible in \"Book Revue\" (1946), where performers are drawn onto various famous books.\n\nClampett was a good source for censorship stories, though the accuracy of his recollections has been disputed. According to an interview published in \"Funnyworld\" #12 (1971), Clampett had a method for ensuring that certain elements of his films would escape the censors' cut. It consisted of adding material aimed just at the censors; they would focus on cutting those, and thus leave in the ones he actually wanted.\n\nClampett continued to direct cartoons each year at the studio until 1946. His unit was taken over by Arthur Davis. \"The Big Snooze\" was his final cartoon with the studio, and one for which he did not get screen credit (only one of three he directed pitting Bugs Bunny and Elmer Fudd). While the generally accepted story was that Clampett left over matters of artistic freedom, Davis remembered that Clampett was fired by then-cartoon studio executive Eddie Selzer, who was far less tolerant of him than Leon Schlesinger. Clampett's style was becoming increasingly divergent from those of Freleng and Jones, the other unit directors, and this is thought by some to be the primary reason for his departure. The Warners style that he was so instrumental in developing was leaving him behind. Warner Bros. had recently bought the rights to the entire Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies studio from Schlesinger, and while his cartoons of 1946 are today considered on the cutting edge of the art for that period, at the time, Clampett was ready to seek new challenges. Clampett left at what some considered the peak of his creativity and against everyone's advice.\n\nIn 1946 after Warner Bros. bought out Leon Schlesinger, his key executives Henry Binder and Ray Katz went to Screen Gems and took Clampett with them. Clampett worked for a time at Screen Gems, then the cartoon division of Columbia Pictures, as a screenwriter and gag writer. In 1947 Republic Pictures incorporated animation (by Walter Lantz) into its Gene Autry feature film \"Sioux City Sue\". It turned out well enough for Republic to dabble in animated cartoons; Bob Clampett directed a single cartoon, \"It's a Grand Old Nag\", featuring the equine character Charlie Horse. Republic management, however, had second thoughts due to dwindling profits, and discontinued the series. Clampett took his direction credit under the name \"Kilroy\".\n\nIn 1949, Clampett turned his attentions to television, where he created the famous puppet show \"Time for Beany\". The show, featuring the talents of voice artists Stan Freberg and Daws Butler, would earn Clampett three Emmys. Groucho Marx and Albert Einstein were both fans of the series. In 1952, he created the \"Thunderbolt the Wondercolt\" television series and the 3D prologue to \"Bwana Devil\" featuring Beany and Cecil. In 1954, he directed \"Willy the Wolf\" (the first puppet variety show on television), as well as creating and voicing the lead in the \"Buffalo Billy\" television show. In the late 1950s, Clampett was hired by Associated Artists Productions to catalog the pre-August 1948 Warner cartoons it had just acquired. He also created an animated version of the puppet show called \"Beany and Cecil\", whose 26 half-hour episodes were first broadcast on ABC in 1962 and were rerun on the network for five years.\n\nIn his later years, Bob Clampett toured college campuses and animation festivals as a lecturer on the history of animation. In 1975 he was the focus of a documentary entitled \"\", the first documentary to examine the history of the Warner Bros. cartoons. Clampett, whose collection of drawings, films, and memorabilia from the golden days of Termite Terrace was legendary, provided nearly all of the behind-the-scenes drawings and home-movie footage for the film; furthermore, his wife, Sody Clampett, is credited as the film's production co-ordinator. In an audio commentary recorded for \"Bugs Bunny: Superstar\", director Larry Jackson claimed that in order to secure Clampett's participation, and access to Clampett's collection of Warners history, he had to sign a contract that stipulated Clampett would host the documentary and also have approval over the final cut. Jackson also claimed that Clampett was very reluctant speaking about the other directors and their contributions.\n\nClampett died of a heart attack on May 2, 1984 in Detroit, Michigan, six days before his 71st birthday, while touring the country to promote the home video release of \"Beany & Cecil\" cartoons. He is buried in Forest Lawn Hollywood Hills.\n\nThough Clampett's contribution to the Warner Brothers animation legacy was considerable and inarguable, he has been criticized by his peers as \"a shameless self-promoter who provoked the wrath of his former Warner's colleagues in later years, for allegedly claiming credit for ideas that were not his.\" Chuck Jones particularly disliked Clampett, and made no mention of his association with him in his 1979 compilation film \"The Bugs Bunny/Road Runner Movie\" (in which Jones lists himself and other Warners directors) although he did briefly mention working with Clampett in his 1989 autobiography \"Chuck Amuck: The Life and Times of An Animated Cartoonist\" and his 1998 interview for the American Television Archive. Some of this animosity appears to have come from Clampett's perceived \"golden boy\" status at the studio (Clampett's mother was said to be a close friend of cartoon producer Leon Schlesinger), which allowed him to ignore studio rules that everyone else were expected to follow. In addition, Mel Blanc (the voice actor who had worked with Clampett at the same studio for ten years) also accused Clampett of being an \"egotist who took credit for everything.\"\n\nMartha Sigall, on the other hand, recalled Clampett as \"an enthusiastic and fun type of guy\". She describes him as consistently nice to her, and very generous when it came to gifts, or donations to a cause. She had left the Termite Terrace in 1943 and did not meet Clampett again until 1960. She did, however, hear from people who Clampett helped break into the animation business and/or mentored.\n\nBeginning with a magazine article in 1946, shortly after he left the studio, and increasing as years went on, Clampett repeatedly referred to himself as \"the creator\" of Bugs Bunny, often adding the side-note that he used Clark Gable's carrot-eating scene in \"It Happened One Night\" as inspiration for his \"creation.\" (Clampett can be observed making this claim in \"Bugs Bunny: Superstar\".) A viewing of the early Bugs cartoons of the late 1930s and early 1940s, however, clearly demonstrates that the character was not \"created\" as a whole at one time, but rather evolved in personality, voice, and design over several years through the efforts of Tex Avery, Chuck Jones, Friz Freleng, Cal Dalton, Ben Hardaway, Robert McKimson, and Mel Blanc, in addition to Clampett's contributions. In the 1979 compilation feature film \"The Bugs Bunny/Road Runner Movie\", Clampett is not mentioned when Bugs Bunny refers to his \"several fathers.\"\n\nAs the feature was compiled by Jones (along with Friz Freleng) the omission of Clampett is not surprising. (The other two directorial fathers Bugs claims to have had are Avery, who directed \"A Wild Hare\", his first official short, and McKimson, who is the least known of the three best-known \"Looney Tunes/Merrie Melodies\" directors, but drew the definitive Bugs Bunny model sheet. Depending on the source, number one could be either Jones or Freleng.) Furthermore, in \"\", Clampett takes credit for drawing the model sheet for the first Porky Pig cartoon, \"I Haven't Got a Hat\" (1935), even though it was actually drawn by Friz Freleng.\n\nAnimation historian Milton Gray details the long and bitter rivalry between Clampett and Jones in an essay titled \"Bob Clampett Remembered.\" Gray, a personal friend of Clampett, calls the controversy \"a deliberate and vicious smear campaign by one of Bob's rivals in the cartoon business.\" He reveals that Jones was angry at Clampett for making some generalizations in his 1970 interview with \"Funnyworld\" that seemingly gave Clampett too much credit. He writes that Jones began making additional accusations against Clampett, such as that Clampett would \"go around the studio at night, looking at other directors' storyboards for ideas he could steal for his own cartoons.\" Jones wrote a letter of accusations in 1975 and, according to Gray, distributed copies to every fan he met: seemingly the genesis of the growing controversy. Gray asserts that Clampett was a \"kind, generous man [who was] deeply hurt and saddened by Jones's accusations. […] I feel that Bob Clampett deserves tremendous respect, and gratitude for the wonderful work that he left us.\" Other Warner Bros. peers such as musical coordinator Carl Stalling and animator Tex Avery stood by Clampett during his talks on the cartoon industry in the 1960s and 1970s.\n\nSince 1984, The Bob Clampett Humanitarian Award is given each year at the Eisner Awards. Recipients of the award include June Foray, Jack Kirby, Sergio Aragonés, Patrick McDonnell, Maggie Thompson, Ray Bradbury and Mark Evanier.\n\nClampett's \"Tin Pan Alley Cats\" (1943) was chosen by the Library of Congress as a \"prime example of the music and mores of our times\" and a print was buried in a time capsule in Washington, D.C. so future generations might see it. \"Porky in Wackyland\" (1938) was inducted into the National Film Registry of the Library of Congress in 2000, deemed \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.\"\n\nJohn Kricfalusi, best known as the creator of \"The Ren & Stimpy Show\", got to know Clampett in his later years and has reflected on those times as inspirational. Kricfalusi calls Clampett his favorite cartoon director and calls \"The Great Piggy Bank Robbery\" (1946) his favorite cartoon: \"I saw this thing and it completely changed my life, I thought it was the greatest thing I'd ever seen, and I still think it is.\"\n\nAnimation historian Leonard Maltin has called Clampett's cartoons \"unmistakable.\" Milton Gray believes that Schlesinger put Clampett in charge of the black and white cartoon division in order to save it, and many historians have singled out a scene in \"Porky's Duck Hunt\" in which Daffy exits as a defining Clampett moment. Maltin called it \"a level of wackiness few moviegoers had ever seen.\"\n\nHistorian Charles Solomon noted a rubbery, flexible animation quality visible in all Clampett's shorts, and Maltin noted an \"energetic, comic anarchy.\" While Clampett's cartoons were not as well known in the latter half of the 20th century because television syndicators only had the rights to the post-1948 Warner cartoons, his creations have increased in notoriety and acclaim in recent decades.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "177497", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=177497", "title": "Burial", "text": "Burial\n\nBurial or interment is the ritual act of placing a dead person or animal, sometimes with objects, into the ground. This is accomplished by excavating a pit or trench, placing the deceased and objects in it, and covering it over. Humans have been burying their dead for at least 100,000 years. Burial is often seen as indicating respect for the dead. It has been used to prevent the odor of decay, to give family members closure and prevent them from witnessing the decomposition of their loved ones, and in many cultures it has been seen as a necessary step for the deceased to enter the afterlife or to give back to the cycle of life.\n\nMethods of burial may be heavily ritualized and can include natural burial (sometimes called \"green burial\"); embalming or mummification; and the use of containers for the dead, such as shrouds, caskets, grave liners, and burial vaults, all of which can retard decomposition of the body. Sometimes objects or grave goods are buried with the body, which may be dressed in fancy or ceremonial garb. Depending on the culture, the way the body is positioned may have great significance.\n\nThe location of the burial may be determined taking into account concerns surrounding health and sanitation, religious concerns, and cultural practices. Some cultures keep the dead close to provide guidance to the living, while others \"banish\" them by locating burial grounds at a distance from inhabited areas. Some religions consecrate special ground to bury the dead, and some families build private family cemeteries. Most modern cultures document the location of graves with headstones, which may be inscribed with information and tributes to the deceased. However, some people are buried in anonymous or secret graves for various reasons. Sometimes multiple bodies are buried in a single grave either by choice (as in the case of married couples), due to space concerns, or in the case of mass graves as a way to deal with many bodies at once.\n\nAlternatives to burial may include cremation, burial at sea, promession, cryopreservation, and others. Some human cultures may bury the remains of beloved animals. Humans are not the only species which bury their dead; the practice has been observed in chimpanzees, elephants, and possibly dogs.\n\nIntentional burial, particularly with grave goods, may be one of the earliest detectable forms of religious practice since, as Philip Lieberman suggests, it may signify a \"concern for the dead that transcends daily life.\" Evidence suggests that the Neanderthals were the first human species to practice burial behavior and intentionally bury their dead, doing so in shallow graves along with stone tools and animal bones. Exemplary sites include Shanidar in Iraq, Kebara Cave in Israel and Krapina in Croatia. Some scholars, however, argue that these bodies may have been disposed of for secular reasons.\n\nThe earliest undisputed human burial dates back 100,000 years. Human skeletal remains stained with red ochre were discovered in the Skhul cave at Qafzeh, Israel. A variety of grave goods were present at the site, including the mandible of a wild boar in the arms of one of the skeletons.\n\nPrehistoric cemeteries are referred to by the more neutral term grave field. They are one of the chief sources of information on prehistoric cultures, and numerous archaeological cultures are defined by their burial customs, such as the\nUrnfield culture of the European Bronze Age.\n\nAfter death, a body will decay. Burial is not necessarily a public health requirement. Contrary to conventional wisdom, the WHO advises that only corpses carrying an infectious disease strictly require burial.\n\nHuman burial practices are the manifestation of the human desire to demonstrate \"respect for the dead\". Cultures vary in their mode of respect.\n\nSome reasons follow:\n\nIn many cultures, human corpses were usually buried in soil. The roots of burial as a practice reach back into the Middle Palaeolithic and coincide with the appearance of \"Homo neanderthalensis\" and \"Homo sapiens\", in Europe and Africa respectively. As a result, burial grounds are found throughout the world. Through time, mounds of earth, temples, and underground caverns were used to store the dead bodies of ancestors. In modern times, the custom of burying dead people below ground, with a stone marker to indicate the burial place, is used in most cultures; although other means such as cremation are becoming more popular in the West (cremation is the norm in India and mandatory in Japan).\n\nSome burial practices are heavily ritualized; others are simply practical.\n\nNatural burial—also called \"green burial\"—is the process by which a body is returned to the earth to decompose naturally in soil, and in some cases even protect native and endangered wildlife. Natural burial became popularized in the United Kingdom in the early 1990s by Ken West, a professional cremator operator for the city of Carlisle, responding to the U.K's call for changes in government that aligned with the United Nations' Environmental Program Local Agenda 21. In addition, there are multiple green burial sites in the United States. Green burials are developing in Canada (Victoria, BC, and Cobourg, Ontario), as well as in Australia and Ireland.\n\nThe increase in popularity of alternative burials can be seen as a direct choice of the individual's want to distance him/herself from religious practices and spiritual locations as well as an opportunity to exercise their act of choice. The desire to live through nature as well as concern for the environment have been the backbone of the green burial movement. The use of coffins made from alternative materials such as wicker and biodegradable materials as well as trees and other flora are being used in place of headstones. Both practices provide sustainable alternatives to traditional burial practices.\n\nNatural burials have been attracting people for reasons outside of environmental and sustainability factors as well. Green burials appeal to people for economic reasons. Traditional burial practices can be a financial burden causing some to turn to green burials as a cheaper alternative. Some people view green burials as more meaningful, especially for those who have a connection to a piece of land, such as current residence or other places that hold meaning for them.\n\nConservation burial is a type of burial where burial fees fund the acquisition and management of new land to benefit native habitat, ecosystems and species. Such burials go beyond other forms of natural burial, which aim to prevent environmental damage caused by conventional burial techniques, by actually increasing benefits for the environment. The idea is for the burial process to be a net positive for the earth rather than just neutral. Scientists have argued that such burials could potentially generate enough funds to save every endangered species on the planet.\n\nThe memorial reef is a natural, alternative approach to burial. The cremated remains of a person are mixed in with concrete and then placed into a mold to make the memorial reef or eternal reef. After the concrete sets, family members are allowed to customize the reef with writing, hand prints and chalk drawings. After this, the eco-friendly reefs are placed into the ocean among other coral reefs where they help to repair damage to the reefs while also providing new habitats for fish and other sea communities. It has become a new way to memorialize the passing person while also protecting the marine environment. The high cost of the memorial reefs has caused this alternative form of burial to remain minimal and uncommon. This kind of natural burial is practiced in permitted oceans in the United States specifically in locations around Florida, South Carolina, North Carolina, Maryland, New Jersey, Texas and Virginia.\n\nAlkaline hydrolysis, also referred to as resomation, is another approach to natural burial. It uses high temperature water mixed with potassium hydroxide to dissolve human remains. During this process, the body is put into an enclosed, stainless steel chamber. The chamber fills with the chemical and water solution and is then lightly circulated. After a couple of hours, the body is worn down and bone is the only thing that remains. The bones are then pressed down into a powder and returned to the associated family. The outcome is comparable to cremation but results in an environmentally friendly process that does not release chemical emissions and greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. After this process, the water used goes to a regular water treatment facility where it is filtered and cleaned and returned to the water cycle. At this time, resomation is permitted for commercial use in areas throughout the United States. However, several other countries, including the United Kingdom are considering using this technology within their medical schools and universities.\n\nMushroom burial has been developed by Jae Rhim Lee and her colleagues to address the impact traditional burial approaches have on the environment. It is an eco-friendly process which consists of dressing the cadaver in a bodysuit with mushroom spores woven into it, nicknamed the Infinity Burial Suit. Rhim developed her own mushrooms by feeding them her hair, skin, and nails to create a mushroom variety that will best decompose human remains. As the mushrooms grow, they consume the remains within the suit as well as the toxins that are being released by the body. Rhim and her colleagues created this suit as a symbol of a new way for people to think about the relationship between their body after death and the environment.\n\nAnother method of natural burial is being developed to plant the human body in fetal position inside an egg shaped pod. The pod containing the body will form a biodegradable capsule that will not harm the surrounding earth. The biodegradable capsule doubles as a seed which can be customized to grow into either a birch, maple, or eucalyptus tree. The goal of this method is to create parks full of trees that loved ones can walk through and mourn, as opposed to a graveyard full of tombstones. This method aims to return the body to the earth in the most environmentally friendly way possible.\n\nThe tree pod method originated in the United Kingdom but is now becoming a more popular method of burial. The definition of natural burial grounds suggests that people are being buried without any kind of formaldehyde-based embalming fluid or synthetic ingredients, and that the bodies that are being returned to the earth will also be returning nutrients to the environment, in a way that is less expensive than other available burial methods. Not only are tree pods a more cost effective and environmentally friendly way to memorialize loved ones, this method also offers emotional support. The memories of loved ones will be immortalized through the concept of a deceased person having a medium (trees) that will continue to live and grow.\n\nEmbalming is the practice of preserving a body against decay and is used in many cultures. Mummification is a more extensive method of embalming, further delaying the decay process.\n\nBodies are often buried wrapped in a shroud or placed in a coffin (or in some cases, a casket). A larger container may be used, such as a ship. In the United States, coffins are usually covered by a grave liner or a burial vault, which prevents the coffin from collapsing under the weight of the earth or floating away during a flood.\n\nThese containers slow the decomposition process by (partially) physically blocking decomposing bacteria and other organisms from accessing the corpse. An additional benefit of using containers to hold the body is that if the soil covering the corpse is washed away by a flood or some other natural process then the corpse will still not be exposed to open air.\n\nThe body may be dressed in fancy and/or ceremonial clothes. Personal objects of the deceased, such as a favorite piece of jewelry or photograph, may be included with the body. This practice, also known as the inclusion of grave goods, serves several purposes:\n\nBurials may be placed in a number of different positions. Bodies with the arms crossed date back to ancient cultures such as Chaldea in the 10th century BC, where the \"X\" symbolized their sky god. Later ancient Egyptian gods and royalty, from approximately 3500 B.C. are shown with crossed arms, such as the god Osiris, the Lord of the Dead, or mummified royalty with crossed arms in high and low body positions, depending upon the dynasty. The burial of bodies in the extended position, i.e., lying flat with arms and legs straight, or with the arms folded upon the chest, and with the eyes and mouth closed. Extended burials may be supine (lying on the back) or prone (lying on the front). However, in some cultures, being buried face down shows marked disrespect. Other ritual practices place the body in a flexed position with the legs bent or crouched with the legs folded up to the chest. Warriors in some ancient societies were buried in an upright position. In Islam, the body is placed in supine position, hands along the sides and the head is turned to its right with the face towards the Qibla. Many cultures treat placement of dead people in an appropriate position to be a sign of respect even when burial is impossible.\n\nIn nonstandard burial practices, such as mass burial, the body may be positioned arbitrarily. This can be a sign of disrespect to the deceased, or at least nonchalance on the part of the inhumer, or due to considerations of time and space.\n\nHistorically, Christian burials were made supine east-west, with the head at the western end of the grave. This mirrors the layout of Christian churches, and for much the same reason; to view the coming of Christ on Judgment day (Eschaton). In many Christian traditions, ordained clergy are traditionally buried in the opposite orientation, and their coffins carried likewise, so that at the General Resurrection they may rise facing, and ready to minister to, their people.\n\nIn Islam, the grave should be aligned perpendicular to the Qibla (i.e. Mecca) and the face turned to the right and facing Qibla. (see Islamic funeral)\n\nFor humans, maintaining an upside down position, with the head vertically below the feet, is highly uncomfortable for any extended period of time, and consequently burial in that attitude (as opposed to attitudes of rest or watchfulness, as above) is highly unusual and generally symbolic. Occasionally suicides and assassins were buried upside down, as a post-mortem punishment and (as with burial at cross-roads) to inhibit the activities of the resulting undead.\n\nIn \"Gulliver's Travels\", the Lilliputians buried their dead upside down:\nSwift's notion of inverted burial might seem the highest flight of fancy, but it appears that among English millenarians the idea that the world would be \"turned upside down\" at the Apocalypse enjoyed some currency. There is at least one attested case of a person being buried upside down by instruction; a Major Peter Labilliere of Dorking (d. 4 June 1800) lies thus upon the summit of Box Hill. Similar stories have attached themselves to other noted eccentrics, particularly in southern England, but not always with a foundation in truth.\n\nSouth Korea’s funeral arrangements have drastically changed in the course of only two decades according to Chang-Won Park. Park states that around the 1980’s at home funeral ceremonies were the general norm, straying away from anywhere that was not a family home. Dying close to home, with friends and family, was considered a ‘good death’, while dying away from home was considered a ‘bad death’. This gradually changed as the upper and middle class started holding funerals in the mortuaries of hospitals. This posed an issue for hospitals because of the rapid increase in funerals being held and maxing occupancy. This resolved when a law was passed to allow the civilian population to hold funerals in the mortuaries of hospitals. The lower class then followed suit, copying the newly set traditions of the upper classes. With this change, the practice of cremation became viewed more as an alternative to traditional burials. Cremation was first introduced by Buddhism, but was banned in 1470. It wasn't until the Japanese colonization period that cremation was re-introduced in 1945 and later lifted the ban. It took until 1998 for cremation to rapidly grow in popularity.\n\nA Ted Talk done by Kelli Swazey discusses how Tana Toraja, a Sulawesi province in Eastern Indonesia, experiences death as a process, rather than an event. The culture of Tana Toraja views funerals as the most important event in a person's life. Because of this importance placed on death, Tana Toraja landscape is covered in the rituals and events transpired after death. The hierarchy of an individual's life is based on the sacrifices of animals made after their death. Funerals tend to be celebrated by Tana Toraja people, typically lasting days to even weeks long. Death is seen as a transformation, rather than a private loss. A Torajan is not considered ‘dead’ until their family members are able to collect the resources necessary to hold a funeral that expresses the status of the deceased. Until these funerals are upheld the deceased are held in Tongkonan, built to house corpses that are not considered ‘dead’. The deceased can be held in Tongkonan for years, waiting for their families to collect the necessary resources to hold a funeral. The Tongkonan represents both the identity of the family and the process of birth and death. The process of birth and death is shown by having the houses that individuals are born in be the same structure as the Tongkonan, houses that individuals die in. Up until the funeral the deceased being housed in the Tongkonan are symbolically treated as members of the family, still being cared for by family members.\n\nNorthern Territory Australian Aboriginals have unique traditions associated with a loved one's death. The death of a loved one sparks a series of events such as smoking out the spirit, a feast, and leaving out the body to decompose. Immediately after death, a smoking ceremony is held in the deceased's home. The smoking ceremonies purpose is to expel the spirit of the deceased from their living quarters. A feast is held where mourners are covered in ochre, an earthy pigment associated with clay, while they eat and dance. The traditional corpse disposal of the Aboriginals includes covering the corpse in leaves on a platform. The corpse is then left to decompose.\n\nIn the African-American slave community, slaves quickly familiarized themselves with funeral procedures and the location of gravesites of family and friends. Specific slaves were assigned to prepare dead bodies, build coffins, dig graves, and construct headstones. Slave funerals were typically at night when the workday was over, with the master present to view all the ceremonial procedures. Slaves from nearby plantations were regularly in attendance.\n\nAt death, a slave's body was wrapped in cloth. The hands were placed across the chest, and a metal plate was placed on top of their hands. The reasoning for the plate was to hinder their return home by suppressing any spirits in the coffin. Often, personal property was buried with slaves to appease spirits. The coffins were nailed shut once the body was inside, and carried by hand or wagon, depending on the property designated for slave burial site.\n\nSlaves were buried oriented East to West, with feet at the Eastern end (head at the Western end, thus raising facing East). According to Christian doctrine, this orientation permitted rising to face the return of Christ without having to turn around upon the call of Gabriel’s trumpet. Gabriel’s trumpet would be blown near the Eastern sunrise.\n\nBahá'í burial law prescribes both the location of burial and burial practices and precludes cremation of the dead. It is forbidden to carry the body for more than one hour's journey from the place of death. Before interment the body should be wrapped in a shroud of silk or cotton, and a ring should be placed on its finger bearing the inscription \"I came forth from God, and return unto Him, detached from all save Him, holding fast to His Name, the Merciful, the Compassionate\". The coffin should be of crystal, stone or hard fine wood. Also, before interment, a specific Prayer for the Dead is ordained. The body should be placed with the feet facing the Qiblih. The formal prayer and the ring are meant to be used for those who have reached fifteen years of age.\n\nApart from sanitary and other practical considerations, the site of burial can be determined by religious and socio-cultural considerations.\n\nThus in some traditions, especially with an animistic logic, the remains of the dead are \"banished\" for fear their spirits would harm the living if too close; others keep remains close to help surviving generations.\n\nReligious rules may prescribe a specific zone, e.g. some Christian traditions hold that Christians must be buried in consecrated ground, usually a cemetery; an earlier practice, burial in or very near the church (hence the word churchyard), was generally abandoned with individual exceptions as a high posthumous honour; also many existing funeral monuments and crypts remain in use.\n\nRoyalty and high nobility often have one or more \"traditional\" sites of burial, generally monumental, often in a palatial chapel or cathedral; see examples on Heraldica.org.\n\nIn North America, private family cemeteries were common among wealthy landowners during the 18th and 19th centuries. Many prominent people were buried in private cemeteries on their respective properties, sometimes in lead-lined coffins. Many of these family cemeteries were not documented and were therefore lost to time and abandon; their grave markers having long since been pilfered by vandals or covered by forest growth. Their locations are occasionally discovered during construction projects.\n\nMost modern cultures mark the location of the body with a headstone. This serves two purposes. First, the grave will not accidentally be exhumed. Second, headstones often contain information or tributes to deceased. This is a form of remembrance for loved ones; it can also be viewed as a form of immortality, especially in cases of famous people's graves. Such monumental inscriptions may subsequently be useful to genealogists and family historians.\n\nIn many cultures graves will be grouped, so the monuments make up a necropolis, a \"city of the dead\" paralleling the community of the living.\n\nIn many cultures graves are marked with durable markers, or monuments, intended to help remind people of the buried person. An unmarked grave is a grave with no such memorial marker.\n\nAnother sort of unmarked grave is a burial site with an anonymous marker, such as a simple cross; boots, rifle and helmet; a sword and shield; a cairn of stones; or even a monument. This may occur when identification of the deceased is impossible. Although many unidentified deceased are buried in potter's fields, some are memorialized, especially in smaller communities or in the case of deaths publicized by local media. Anonymous burials also happen in poorer or disadvantaged populations' communities in countries such as South Africa, where in the past the Non-white population was simply too poor to afford headstones. At the cemetery in a small rural town of Harding, KwaZulu-Natal, many grave sites have no identification, and just have a border of stones which mark out the dimensions of the grave site itself.\n\nMany countries have buried an unidentified soldier (or other member of the military) in a prominent location as a form of respect for all unidentified war dead. The United Kingdom's Tomb of the Unknown Warrior is in Westminster Abbey, France's is buried underneath the Arc de Triomphe, Italy's is buried in the Monumento al Milite Ignoto in Rome, Canada's is buried at the National War Memorial in Ottawa, Australia's Tomb of the Unknown Soldier is located at the Australian War Memorial in Canberra, New Zealand's Tomb of the Unknown Warrior is in Wellington, the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier in Russia is in Alexander Garden in Moscow and the United States' Tomb of the Unknown Soldier is located at Arlington National Cemetery.\n\nMany cultures practice anonymous burial as a norm, not an exception. For instance, in 2002 a survey for the Federal Guild of German Stonemasons found that, depending on the location within Germany, from 0% to 43% of burials were anonymous. According to \"Christian Century\" magazine, the perspective of the Roman Catholic Church is that anonymous burials reflect a dwindling belief in God. Others claim that this trend is mainly driven by secularism and the high costs of traditional burials.\n\nIn rare cases, a known person may be buried without identification, perhaps to avoid desecration of the corpse, grave robbing, or vandalism of the burial site. This may be particularly the case with infamous or notorious figures. In other cases, it may be to prevent the grave from becoming a tourist attraction or a destination of pilgrimage. Survivors may cause the deceased to be buried in a secret location or other unpublished place, or in a grave with a false name (or no name at all) on the marker.\n\nWhen Walt Disney was cremated his ashes were buried in a secret location in Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery, California. Some burial sites at Forest Lawn, such as those of Humphrey Bogart, Mary Pickford and Michael Jackson, are secluded in private gated gardens or mausoleums with no public access. A number of tombs are also kept from the public eye. Forest Lawn's Court of Honor indicates that some of its crypts have plots which are reserved for individuals who may be \"voted in\" as \"Immortals\"; no amount of money can purchase a place. Photographs taken at Forest Lawn are not permitted to be published, and their information office usually refuses to reveal exactly where the remains of famous people are buried.\n\nSome couples or groups of people (such as a married couple or other family members) may wish to be buried in the same plot. In some cases, the coffins (or urns) may simply be buried side by side. In others, one casket may be interred above another. If this is planned for in advance, the first casket may be buried more deeply than is the usual practice so that the second casket may be placed over it without disturbing the first. In many states in Australia all graves are designated two or three depth (depending of the water table) for multiple burials, at the discretion of the burial rights holder, with each new interment atop the previous coffin separated by a thin layer of earth. As such all graves are dug to greater depth for the initial burial than the traditional six feet to facilitate this practice.\n\nMass burial is the practice of burying multiple bodies in one location. Civilizations attempting genocide often employ mass burial for victims. However, mass burial may in many cases be the only practical means of dealing with an overwhelming number of human remains, such as those resulting from a natural disaster, an act of terrorism, an epidemic, or an accident. This practice has become less common in the developed world with the advent of genetic testing, but even in the 21st century remains which are unidentifiable by current methods may be buried in a mass grave.\n\nIndividuals who are buried at the expense of the local authorities and buried in potter's fields may be buried in mass graves. Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart was once believed to have been buried in such a manner, but today it is known that such burials were never allowed in Mozart's Vienna whose Magistrate refused to agree to the burial regulations decreed by Joseph II. In some cases, the remains of unidentified individuals may be buried in mass graves in potter's fields, making exhumation and future identification troublesome for law enforcement.\n\nNaval ships sunk in combat are also considered mass graves by many countries. For example, U.S. Navy policy declares such wrecks a mass grave (such as the USS Arizona Memorial) and forbids the recovery of remains. In lieu of recovery, divers or submersibles may leave a plaque dedicated to the memory of the ship or boat and its crew, and family members are invited to attend the ceremony.\n\nSites of large former battlefields may also contain one or more mass graves. Douaumont ossuary is one such mass grave, and it contains the remains of 130,000 soldiers from both sides of the Battle of Verdun.\n\nCatacombs also constitute a form of mass grave. Some catacombs, for example those in Rome, were designated as a communal burial place. Some, such as the catacombs of Paris, only became a mass grave when individual burials were relocated from cemeteries marked for demolition.\n\nJudaism does not generally allow multiple bodies in a grave. An exception to this is a grave in the military cemetery in Jerusalem, where there is a \"kever achim\" (Hebrew, \"grave of brothers\") where two soldiers were killed together in a tank and are buried in one grave. As the bodies were so fused together with the metal of the tank that they could not be separately identified, they were buried in one grave (along with parts of the tank).\n\nThere are several common alternatives to burial. In cremation the body of the deceased is burned in a special oven. Most of the body is burnt during the cremation process, leaving only a few pounds of bone fragments. Bodies of small children and infants often produce very little in the way of \"ashes\", as ashes are composed of bone, and young people have softer bones, largely cartilage. Often these fragments are processed (ground) into a fine powder, which has led to cremated remains being called \"ashes\". In recent times, cremation has become a popular option in the western world.\n\nThere is far greater flexibility in dealing with the remains in cremation as opposed to the traditional burial. Some of the options include scattering the ashes at a place that was loved by the deceased or keeping the ashes at home. Ashes can also be buried underground or in a columbarium niche.\n\nA method with similar benefits is freeze-drying the corpse.\n\nLive burial sometimes occurs, in which individuals are buried while still alive. Having no way of escaping interment, they die in place, typically by asphyxiation, dehydration, starvation, or (in cold or hot climates) exposure. People may come to be buried alive in a number of different ways;\n\nWriter Edgar Allan Poe wrote a number of stories and poems about premature burial, including a story called \"The Premature Burial.\" These works inspired a widespread popular fear of this appalling but unlikely event. Various expedients have been devised to prevent this event, including burying live telephones or telemetry sensors in graves.\n\nHistorically, burial at cross-roads was the method of disposing of executed criminals and suicides. In Great Britain this tradition was altered by the Burial of Suicide Act 1823, which abolished the legal requirements of burying suicides and other people at crossroads. Cross-roads form a crude cross shape and this may have given rise to the belief that these spots were selected as the next best burying-places to consecrated ground. Another possible explanation is that the ancient Teutonic (Germanic) ethnic groups often built their altars at the cross-roads, and since human sacrifices, especially of criminals, formed part of the ritual, these spots came to be regarded as execution grounds. Hence after the introduction of Christianity, criminals and suicides were buried at the cross-roads during the night, in order to assimilate as far as possible their funeral to that of the pagans. An example of a cross-road execution-ground was the famous Tyburn in London, which stood on the spot where the Roman road to Edgware and beyond met the Roman road heading west out of London.\n\nSuperstition also played a part in the selection of crossroads in the burial of suicides. Folk belief often held such individuals could rise as some form of undead (such as a vampire) and burying them at crossroads would inhibit their ability to find and wreak havoc on their living relations and former associates.\n\nIn addition to burying human remains, many human cultures also regularly bury animal remains.\n\nPets and other animals of emotional significance are often ceremonially buried. Most families bury deceased pets on their own properties, mainly in a yard, with a shoe box or any other type of container served as a coffin. The ancient Egyptians are known to have mummified and buried cats, which they considered deities.\n\nHumans are not always the only species to bury their dead. Chimpanzees and elephants are known to throw leaves and branches over fallen members of their family groups. In a particularly odd case, an elephant which trampled a human mother and child buried its victims under a pile of leaves before disappearing into the bushes. In 2013, a viral video caught a dog burying a dead puppy by pushing sand with its own nose. It is presumed, however, that since dogs retain the instinct to bury food, this is what is being depicted in the video. In social insects, ants and termites also bury their dead nestmates depending on the properties of the corpse and the social context \n\nExhumation is the act of digging up, especially a corpse. This is most often done to relocate a body to a different burial spot. Families may make this decision to locate the deceased in a more pertinent or convenient place. In shared family burial sites (e.g. a married couple), if the previously deceased person has been buried for an insufficient period of time the second body may be buried elsewhere until it is safe to move it to the requested grave. In most jurisdictions a legal exhumation usually requires a court order or permission by the next of kin of the deceased. Also in many countries permits are required by some governing agency like the board of health in order to legally conduct a disinterment.\n\nExhumation of human remains occur for a number of reasons unrelated to the burial location, including identification of the deceased or as part of a criminal investigation. If an individual dies in suspicious circumstances, the police may request exhumation in order to determine the cause of death. Exhumations may also occur as part of grave robbing, or as an act of desecration to show disrespect. In rare, historical cases (e.g. Pope Formosus or Oliver Cromwell), a body may be exhumed for posthumous execution, dissection, or gibbeting. Notable individuals may be exhumed to answer historical questions. Many Ancient Egyptian mummies have been removed for study and public display. Exhumation enables archaeologists to search the remains to better understand human culture.\n\nIn folklore and mythology, exhumation has also been frequently associated with the performance of rites to banish undead manifestations. An example is the Mercy Brown Vampire Incident of Rhode Island, which occurred in 1892.\n\nRemains may be exhumed in order to be reinterred at a more appropriate location. The passing of time may mean political situations change and a burial can take place in different circumstances. Roger Casement was executed at Pentonville Prison in London on 3 August 1916 and buried in the prison grounds but his body was exhumed and given a state funeral in Dublin on 1 March 1965.\n\nDeceased individuals who were either not identified or misidentified at the time of burial may be reburied if survivors so wish. For example, when the remains of MIA soldiers are discovered, or the case of Nicholas II of Russia and his family, who were exhumed from unmarked graves near Yekaterinburg to be reinterred in the Peter and Paul Fortress in St. Petersburg.\n\nCemeteries sometimes have a limited number of plots in which to bury the dead. Once all plots are full, older remains may be moved to an ossuary to accommodate more bodies, in accordance with burial contracts, religious and local burial laws. In Hong Kong where real estate is at a premium, burials in government-run cemeteries are disinterred after six years under exhumation order. Remains are either collected privately for cremation or reburied in an urn or niche. Unclaimed burials are exhumed and cremated by the government. Permanent burial in privately run cemeteries is allowed.\n\nRemains may be exhumed and reburied en masse when a cemetery is relocated, once local planning and religious requirements are met. It also enables construction agencies to clear the way for new constructions. One example of this is cemeteries in Chicago next to O'Hare International Airport to expand the runways.\n\nThe remains of the Venerable or the Blessed are sometimes exhumed to ensure their bodies lie in their correctly marked graves, as their gravesites usually become places for devotees to gather, and also to collect relics. The bodies may also be transferred to a more dignified place. It also serves the purpose to see if they are supernaturally Incorrupt. An incorrupt corpse is no longer considered miraculous, but it is a characteristic of several known saints. Exhumation is no longer a requirement in the beatification process, but still may be carried out.\n\nFrequently, cultures have different sets of exhumation taboos. Occasionally these differences result in conflict, especially in cases where a culture with more lenient exhumation rules wishes to operate on the territory of a different culture. For example, United States construction companies have run into conflict with Native American groups that have wanted to preserve their burial grounds from disturbance.\n\nIn Southern Chinese culture, graves are opened after a period of years. The bones are removed, cleaned, dried, and placed in a ceramic pot for reburial (in Taiwan), or in a smaller coffin and to be reburied in another location (in Vietnam). The practice is called \"jiǎngǔ\" in Taiwan, or \"boc mo\" in Vietnam '揀骨 “digging up bones” and is an important ritual in the posthumous “care” of children for their deceased parents and ancestors. Failure to carry out this ritual is considered a failure of filial piety.\n\nJewish law forbids the exhumation of a corpse.\n\nIn England and Wales once the top of a coffin has been lowered below ground level in a burial if it raised again, say for example the grave sides are protruding and need further work, this is considered an exhumation and the Home Office are required to be notified and a full investigation undertaken. Therefore, grave diggers in England and Wales are particularly careful to ensure that grave sites are dug with plenty of room for the coffin to pass.\n\nReinterment refers to the reburial of a corpse.\n\nSecondary burial is a burial, cremation, or inhumation that is dug into a pre-existing barrow or grave any time after its initial construction. It is often associated with the belief that there is a liminal phase between the time that a person dies and finally decays.\n\nAlternatives to burial variously show respect for the dead, accelerate decomposition and disposal, or prolong display of the remains.\n\nAs the human population progresses, cultures and traditions change with it. Evolution is generally slow, sometimes more rapid. South Korea's funeral arrangements have drastically changed in the course of only two decades according to Chang-Won Park<nowiki>. Around the 1980s at home funeral ceremonies were the general norm, straying away from anywhere that was not a family home. Dying close to home, with friends and family, was considered a ‘good death’, while dying away from home was considered a ‘bad death’. This gradually changed as the upper and middle class started holding funerals in the mortuaries of hospitals. This posed an issue for hospitals because of the rapid increase in funerals being held and maxing occupancy. This quickly resolved when a law was passed to allow the civilian population holding funerals in the mortuaries of hospitals. The lower class quickly followed suit, copying the newly set traditions of the upper classes. With this change, cremation also practice more as an alternative to traditional burials. Cremation was first introduced by Buddhism, and was quickly banned in 1470. It wasn’t until the Japanese colonization period that cremation was re-introduced in 1945 and later on lifted the ban. It took until 1998 for cremation to rapidly grow in popularity. </nowiki>\n\nAccording to Margaret Holloway, funerals are believed to be driven by the consumer's choice, personalisation, secularization, and stories that place individual traditional meta-narratives. It has been studied that funeral homes in the United Kingdom are most concerned with comforting the grieving, rather than focusing on the departed. This study found that modern day funerals focus on the psycho-social-spiritual event. Modern day funerals also help the transition of the recently passed transitioning to the social status of ‘the deceased’. The article found that funeral homes do not adhere to traditional religious beliefs, but do follow religious traditions.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "3689312", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3689312", "title": "Buster Edwards", "text": "Buster Edwards\n\nRonald Christopher \"Buster\" Edwards (27 January 1931 – 28 November 1994) was a British criminal who was a member of the gang that committed the Great Train Robbery. He had also been a boxer, nightclub and flower shop owner.\n\nEdwards was born in Lambeth, the son of a barman. After leaving school, he worked in a sausage factory, where he began his criminal career by stealing meat to sell on the post-war black market. During his National Service in the RAF, he was detained for stealing cigarettes. When he returned to south London, he ran a drinking club and became a professional criminal.\n\nHe married June Rothery in 1952. They had a daughter, Nicola.\n\nHe was involved in the theft of £62,000 (£ today) from Comet House, the headquarters of British Overseas Airways Corporation at Heathrow Airport, in 1962. Many of the gang were captured, but Edwards escaped arrest. Many from the same gang would go on to undertake the Great Train Robbery in August 1963.\n\nThe Great Train gang intercepted the Glasgow–London mail train in Buckinghamshire in the early hours of 8 August 1963. After tampering with the track-side signal lights, they stopped the train at Sears Crossing and moved the engine and high-value carriage to Bridego Bridge, near Cheddington, and they escaped with £2,600,000 of used banknotes (£ today). The driver, Jack Mills, was beaten over the head and suffered from related complications for the rest of his life—opinion is divided as to whether the injury was a factor in his death. The gang's temporary hideout at Leatherslade Farm was quickly found. Most of the gang were captured, tried, and imprisoned, but Edwards evaded arrest with his £150,000 share of the stolen money.\n\nEdwards and another gang member, Bruce Reynolds, took their families to Mexico. The money ran out, and Edwards' family became homesick, so he negotiated his return to England in 1966. He was arrested and sentenced to 15 years in jail.\n\nEdwards spent nine years in prison. After his early release in 1975, he ran a flower stall outside Waterloo station in London. He gave interviews to writer Piers Paul Read, persuading him to write in his 1978 book \"The Train Robbers\" that the robbery was led by German commando Otto Skorzeny, and that Edwards was the person responsible for hitting Jack Mills. Edwards later retracted these claims. \"Buster\", a film about his role in the Great Train Robbery, was made in 1988, with Edwards played by Phil Collins.\n\nBuster Edwards can be seen making a cameo appearance in the film \"Buster\" alongside Phil Collins' wife Jill in the scene in which Buster and June land in Mexico, he and Jill walk out of the airport in front of Buster and June Edwards.\n\nIn 1991, Edwards was the victim of a theft, albeit of a more mundane nature. On 15 June, at about 3pm, British actor Dexter Fletcher ran along Mepham Street and scooped up two bunches of nasturtiums valued at £5 from Edwards' stall. Edwards declined to chase Fletcher for fear of leaving his stall unattended. Fletcher was seen to run off on to York Road with the flowers. Edwards reported the theft to the police, identifying his assailant as being, \"That lad out of \"The Rachel Papers\"\". Fletcher was unlucky in the timing of his theft because Edwards had seen the film for the first time only days before. Fletcher was arrested and charged with theft. The following week Fletcher appeared at Horseferry Road Magistrates' Court and pleaded guilty. He was given a conditional discharge for twelve months and ordered to pay £30 costs. In mitigation, Fletcher said that the flowers were for his girlfriend and \"Press Gang\" co-star Julia Sawalha, but that he had lost his cash card and was unable to obtain funds to pay for the flowers. Fletcher subsequently apologised to Edwards and compensated him for the flowers.\n\nEdwards died in Lambeth, London, at the age of 63. He was found by his brother, hanging from a steel girder inside a lock-up garage in Leake Street, Lambeth. At the Inquest following Edwards' death, a panel recorded an open verdict, based on testimony that the deceased was too intoxicated to form an intent to kill himself. However, at the time of his death, he was being investigated by the police as part of an inquiry into a suspected large-scale fraud and it is speculated that fear of being re-imprisoned could have led to a suicide attempt.\nEdwards was survived by his wife and their daughter.\n"}
{"id": "33988546", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=33988546", "title": "Cashel Man", "text": "Cashel Man\n\nCashel Man is a bog body from the Cúl na Móna bog near Cashel in County Laois, Ireland. He was found by Bord na Mona employee Jason Phelan from Abbeyleix. The body was a young adult male, around 20-25, who had been intentionally covered with peat after death. The crouched figure was recovered after being partially damaged by a milling machine in 2011. The head and left arm were presumed destroyed by the peat harvester, until later found. Radiocarbon dating places him around 2000 BC, making it the oldest fleshed bog body of Europe.\n\nThe region Cashel Man had once lived in was a flourishing community. The legs were found to be protruding from the skin of the corpse, in addition to being exceptionally well preserved. The remaining part of the body inside of the bag-like skin was not as well preserved. The stomach of the man had long since decomposed, which made analyzing his last meal impossible. The body parts that had been disturbed by the milling machine were later recovered, including part of the head, which had closely cut hair. The body was later moved to the National Museum of Ireland for examination. The man was believed to have been buried with his arms holding his legs, his knees bent toward his chest.\n\nThe man had a pre-mortem broken arm, caused by a strike with a sharp object. His back was broken in two places (believed to have happened after his death), and a cut on his back, most likely from the same blade that broke his arm. The body was accompanied by wooden stakes, suggesting ritual sacrifice. The wound on the man's arm suggests that it was a defensive wound. The man may have once been the king of his region, and was sacrificed due to poor harvests, as a king was believed to have been responsible for such things. Like Old Croughan Man and Clonycavan Man, he was buried near a hill that may have been used for kingship initiation.\n\n"}
{"id": "88931", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=88931", "title": "Cataract", "text": "Cataract\n\nA cataract is a clouding of the lens in the eye which leads to a decrease in vision. Cataracts often develop slowly and can affect one or both eyes. Symptoms may include faded colors, blurry vision, halos around light, trouble with bright lights, and trouble seeing at night. This may result in trouble driving, reading, or recognizing faces. Poor vision caused by cataracts may also result in an increased risk of falling and depression. Cataracts cause half of all cases of blindness and 33% of visual impairment worldwide.\nCataracts are most commonly due to aging but may also occur due to trauma or radiation exposure, be present from birth, or occur following eye surgery for other problems. Risk factors include diabetes, smoking tobacco, prolonged exposure to sunlight, and alcohol. The underlying mechanism involves accumulation of clumps of protein or yellow-brown pigment in the lens that reduces transmission of light to the retina at the back of the eye. Diagnosis is by an eye examination.\nPrevention includes wearing sunglasses and not smoking. Early on the symptoms may be improved with glasses. If this does not help, surgery to remove the cloudy lens and replace it with an artificial lens is the only effective treatment. Surgery is needed only if the cataracts are causing problems and generally results in an improved quality of life. Cataract surgery is not readily available in many countries, which is especially true for women, those living in rural areas, and those who do not know how to read.\nAbout 20 million people are blind due to cataracts. It is the cause of approximately 5% of blindness in the United States and nearly 60% of blindness in parts of Africa and South America. Blindness from cataracts occurs in about 10 to 40 per 100,000 children in the developing world, and 1 to 4 per 100,000 children in the developed world. Cataracts become more common with age. More than half the people in the United States had cataracts by the age of 80.\n\nSigns and symptoms vary depending on the type of cataract, though considerable overlap occurs. People with nuclear sclerotic or brunescent cataracts often notice a reduction of vision. Those with posterior subcapsular cataracts usually complain of glare as their major symptom.\n\nThe severity of cataract formation, assuming no other eye disease is present, is judged primarily by a visual acuity test. Other symptoms include frequent changes of glasses and colored halos due to hydration of lens.\n\nAge is the most common cause. Lens proteins denature and degrade over time, and this process is accelerated by diseases such as diabetes mellitus and hypertension. Environmental factors, including toxins, radiation, and ultraviolet light, have cumulative effects, which are worsened by the loss of protective and restorative mechanisms due to alterations in gene expression and chemical processes within the eye.\n\nBlunt trauma causes swelling, thickening, and whitening of the lens fibers. While the swelling normally resolves with time, the white color may remain. In severe blunt trauma, or in injuries that penetrate the eye, the capsule in which the lens sits can be damaged. This damage allows fluid from other parts of the eye to rapidly enter the lens leading to swelling and then whitening, obstructing light from reaching the retina at the back of the eye. Cataracts may develop in 0.7 to 8.0% of cases following electrical injuries. Blunt trauma can also result in star- or petal-shaped cataracts.\n\nCataracts can arise as an effect of exposure to various types of radiation. X-rays, one form of ionizing radiation, may damage the DNA of lens cells. Ultraviolet light, specifically UVB, has also been shown to cause cataracts, and some evidence indicates sunglasses worn at an early age can slow its development in later life. Microwaves , a type of nonionizing radiation, may cause harm by denaturing protective enzymes (e.g., glutathione peroxidase), by oxidizing protein thiol groups (causing protein aggregation), or by damaging lens cells via thermoelastic expansion. The protein coagulation caused by electric and heat injuries whitens the lens. This same process is what makes the clear albumen of an egg become white and opaque during cooking.\n\nThe genetic component is strong in the development of cataracts, most commonly through mechanisms that protect and maintain the lens. The presence of cataracts in childhood or early life can occasionally be due to a particular syndrome. Examples of chromosome abnormalities associated with cataracts include 1q21.1 deletion syndrome, cri-du-chat syndrome, Down syndrome, Patau's syndrome, trisomy 18 (Edward's syndrome), and Turner's syndrome, and in the case of neurofibromatosis type 2, juvenile cataract on one or both sides may be noted. Examples of single-gene disorder include Alport's syndrome, Conradi's syndrome, cerebrotendineous xanthomatosis, myotonic dystrophy, and oculocerebrorenal syndrome or Lowe syndrome.\n\nThe skin and the lens have the same embryological origin and so can be affected by similar diseases. Those with atopic dermatitis and eczema occasionally develop shield ulcer cataracts. Ichthyosis is an autosomal recessive disorder associated with cuneiform cataracts and nuclear sclerosis. Basal-cell nevus and pemphigus have similar associations.\n\nCigarette smoking has been shown to double the rate of nuclear sclerotic cataracts and triple the rate of posterior subcapsular cataracts. Evidence is conflicting over the effect of alcohol. Some surveys have shown a link, but others which followed people over longer terms have not.\n\nLow vitamin C intake and serum levels have been associated with greater cataract rates. However, use of supplements of vitamin C has not demonstrated benefit.\n\nSome medications, such as systemic, topical, or inhaled corticosteroids, may increase the risk of cataract development. Corticosteroids most commonly cause posterior subcapsular cataracts. People with schizophrenia often have risk factors for lens opacities (such as diabetes, hypertension, and poor nutrition) but antipsychotic medications are unlikely to contribute to cataract formation. Miotics and triparanol may increase the risk.\n\nNearly every person who undergoes a vitrectomy—without ever having had cataract surgery—will experience progression of nuclear sclerosis after the operation. This may be because the native vitreous humor is different to the solutions used to replace the vitreous (vitreous substitutes), such as BSS Plus. This may also be because the native vitreous humour contains ascorbic acid which helps neutralize oxidative damage to the lens and because traditional vitreous substitutes do not contain ascorbic acid. As such, for phakic patients requiring a vitrectomy it is becoming increasingly common for ophthalmologists to offer the vitrectomy with a combined prophylactic cataract surgery procedure to prophylactically prevent cataract formation.\n\n\n\nCataracts may be partial or complete, stationary or progressive, or hard or soft. The main types of age-related cataracts are nuclear sclerosis, cortical, and posterior subcapsular.\n\nNuclear sclerosis is the most common type of cataract, and involves the central or 'nuclear' part of the lens. This eventually becomes hard, or 'sclerotic', due to condensation on the lens nucleus and the deposition of brown pigment within the lens. In its advanced stages it is called a brunescent cataract. In early stages, an increase in sclerosis cause an increase in refractive index of the lens. This causes a myopic shift (lenticular shift) that decreases hyperopia and enables presbyopic patients to see at near without reading glasses. This is only tempororary and is called second sight.\n\nCortical cataracts are due to the lens cortex (outer layer) becoming opaque. They occur when changes in the fluid contained in the periphery of the lens causes fissuring. When these cataracts are viewed through an ophthalmoscope, or other magnification system, the appearance is similar to white spokes of a wheel. Symptoms often include problems with glare and light scatter at night.\n\nPosterior subcapsular cataracts are cloudy at the back of the lens adjacent to the capsule (or bag) in which the lens sits. Because light becomes more focused toward the back of the lens, they can cause disproportionate symptoms for their size.\n\nAn immature cataract has some transparent protein, but with a mature cataract, all the lens protein is opaque. In a hypermature or Morgagnian cataract, the lens proteins have become liquid. Congenital cataract, which may be detected in adulthood, has a different classification and includes lamellar, polar, and sutural cataracts.\n\nCataracts can be classified by using the lens opacities classification system LOCS III. In this system, cataracts are classified based on type as nuclear, cortical, or posterior. The cataracts are further classified based on severity on a scale from 1 to 5. The LOCS III system is highly reproducible.\nRisk factors such as UVB exposure and smoking can be addressed. Although no means of preventing cataracts has been scientifically proven, wearing sunglasses that counteract ultraviolet light may slow their development. While adequate intake of antioxidants (such as vitamins A, C, and E) has been thought to protect against the risk of cataracts, clinical trials have shown no benefit from supplements; though evidence is mixed, but weakly positive, for a potential protective effect of the nutrients lutein and zeaxanthin. Statin use is somewhat associated with a lower risk of nuclear sclerotic cataracts.\n\nThe appropriateness of surgery depends on a person's particular functional and visual needs and other risk factors. Cataract removal can be performed at any stage and no longer requires ripening of the lens. Surgery is usually 'outpatient' and usually performed using local anesthesia. About 9 of 10 patients can achieve a corrected vision of 20/40 or better after surgery.\n\nSeveral recent evaluations found that cataract surgery can meet expectations only when significant functional impairment due to cataracts exists before surgery. Visual function estimates such as VF-14 have been found to give more realistic estimates than visual acuity testing alone. In some developed countries, a trend to overuse cataract surgery has been noted, which may lead to disappointing results.\n\nPhacoemulsification is the most widely used cataract surgery in the developed world. This procedure uses ultrasonic energy to emulsify the cataract lens. Phacoemulsification typically comprises six steps:\n\nExtracapsular cataract extraction (ECCE) consists of removing the lens manually, but leaving the majority of the capsule intact. The lens is expressed through a 10- to 12-mm incision which is closed with sutures at the end of surgery. ECCE is less frequently performed than phacoemulsification, but can be useful when dealing with very hard cataracts or other situations where emulsification is problematic. Manual small incision cataract surgery (MSICS) has evolved from ECCE. In MSICS, the lens is removed through a self-sealing scleral tunnel wound in the sclera which, ideally, is watertight and does not require suturing. Although \"small\", the incision is still markedly larger than the portal in phacoemulsion. This surgery is increasingly popular in the developing world where access to phacoemulsification is still limited.\n\nIntracapsular cataract extraction (ICCE) is rarely performed. The lens and surrounding capsule are removed in one piece through a large incision while pressure is applied to the vitreous membrane. The surgery has a high rate of complications.\n\nThe postoperative recovery period (after removing the cataract) is usually short. The patient is usually ambulatory on the day of surgery, but is advised to move cautiously and avoid straining or heavy lifting for about a month. The eye is usually patched on the day of surgery and use of an eye shield at night is often suggested for several days after surgery.\n\nIn all types of surgery, the cataractous lens is removed and replaced with an artificial lens, known as an intraocular lens, which stays in the eye permanently. Intraocular lenses are usually monofocal, correcting for either distance or near vision. Multifocal lenses may be implanted to improve near and distance vision simultaneously, but these lenses may increase the chance of unsatisfactory vision.\n\nSerious complications of cataract surgery include retinal detachment and endophthalmitis. In both cases, patients notice a sudden decrease in vision. In endophthalmitis, patients often describe pain. Retinal detachment frequently presents with unilateral visual field defects, blurring of vision, flashes of light, or floating spots.\n\nThe risk of retinal detachment was estimated as about 0.4% within 5.5 years, corresponding to a 2.3-fold risk increase compared to naturally expected incidence, with older studies reporting a substantially higher risk. The incidence is increasing over time in a somewhat linear manner, and the risk increase lasts for at least 20 years after the procedure. Particular risk factors are younger age, male sex, longer axial length, and complications during surgery. In the highest risk group of patients, the incidence of pseudophakic retinal detachment may be as high as 20%.\n\nThe risk of endophthalmitis occurring after surgery is less than one in 1000.\n\nCorneal edema and cystoid macular edema are less serious but more common, and occur because of persistent swelling at the front of the eye in corneal edema or back of the eye in cystoid macular edema. They are normally the result of excessive inflammation following surgery, and in both cases, patients may notice blurred, foggy vision. They normally improve with time and with application of anti-inflammatory drops. The risk of either occurring is around one in 100. It is unclear whether NSAIDs or corticosteroids are superior at reducing postoperative inflammation.\n\nPosterior capsular opacification, also known as after-cataract, is a condition in which months or years after successful cataract surgery, vision deteriorates or problems with glare and light scattering recur, usually due to thickening of the back or posterior capsule surrounding the implanted lens, so-called 'posterior lens capsule opacification'. Growth of natural lens cells remaining after the natural lens was removed may be the cause, and the younger the patient, the greater the chance of this occurring. Management involves cutting a small, circular area in the posterior capsule with targeted beams of energy from a laser, called capsulotomy, after the type of laser used. The laser can be aimed very accurately, and the small part of the capsule which is cut falls harmlessly to the bottom of the inside of the eye. This procedure leaves sufficient capsule to hold the lens in place, but removes enough to allow light to pass directly through to the retina. Serious side effects are rare. Posterior capsular opacification is common and occurs following up to one in four operations, but these rates are decreasing following the introduction of modern intraocular lenses together with a better understanding of the causes.\n\nVitreous touch syndrome is a possible complication of intracapsular cataract extraction.\n\nAge-related cataracts are responsible for 51% of world blindness, about 20 million people. Globally, cataracts cause moderate to severe disability in 53.8 million (2004), 52.2 million of whom are in low and middle income countries.\n\nIn many countries, surgical services are inadequate, and cataracts remain the leading cause of blindness. Even where surgical services are available, low vision associated with cataracts may still be prevalent as a result of long waits for, and barriers to, surgery, such as cost, lack of information and transportation problems.\n\nIn the United States, age-related lens changes have been reported in 42% between the ages of 52 and 64, 60% between the ages 65 and 74, and 91% between the ages of 75 and 85. Cataracts affect nearly 22 million Americans age 40 and older. By age 80, more than half of all Americans have cataracts. Direct medical costs for cataract treatment are estimated at $6.8 billion annually.\n\nIn the eastern Mediterranean region, cataracts are responsible for over 51% of blindness. Access to eye care in many countries in this region is limited. Childhood-related cataracts are responsible for 5–20% of world childhood blindness.\n\nCataract surgery was first described by the Indian physician, Suśruta (about 5th century BCE) in his manuscript Sushruta Samhita in ancient India. Most of the methods mentioned focus on hygiene. Follow-up treatments include bandaging of the eye and covering the eye with warm butter. References to cataracts and their treatment in Ancient Rome are also found in 29 AD in \"De Medicinae\", the work of the Latin encyclopedist Aulus Cornelius Celsus. Archaeological evidence of eye surgery in the Roman era also exists.\n\nGalen of Pergamon (ca. 2nd century CE), a prominent Greek physician, surgeon and philosopher, performed an operation similar to modern cataract surgery. Using a needle-shaped instrument, Galen attempted to remove the cataract-affected lens of the eye.\n\nMuslim ophthalmologist Ammar Al-Mawsili, in his \"Choice of Eye Diseases\", written \"circa\" 1000, wrote of his invention of a syringe and the technique of cataract extraction while experimenting with it on a patient.\n\n\"Cataract\" is derived from the Latin ', meaning \"waterfall\", and from the Ancient Greek ('), \"down-rushing\", from καταράσσω (\"katarassō\") meaning \"to dash down\" (from \"kata\"-, \"down\"; \"arassein\", \"to strike, dash\"). As rapidly running water turns white, so the term may have been used metaphorically to describe the similar appearance of mature ocular opacities. In Latin, \"cataracta\" had the alternative meaning \"portcullis\" and the name possibly passed through French to form the English meaning \"eye disease\" (early 15th century), on the notion of \"obstruction\". Early Persian physicians called the term \"nazul-i-ah\", or \"descent of the water\"—vulgarised into waterfall disease or cataract—believing such blindness to be caused by an outpouring of corrupt humour into the eye.\n\nN-Acetylcarnosine drops have been investigated as a medical treatment for cataracts. The drops are believed to work by reducing oxidation and glycation damage in the lens, particularly reducing crystallin crosslinking. Some benefit has been shown in small manufacturer sponsored randomized controlled trials but further independent corroboration is still required.\n\nFemtosecond laser mode-locking, used during cataract surgery, was originally used to cut accurate and predictable flaps in LASIK surgery, and has been introduced to cataract surgery. The incision at the junction of the sclera and cornea and the hole in capsule during capsulorhexis, traditionally made with a handheld blade, needle, and forceps, are dependent on skill and experience of the surgeon. Sophisticated three-dimensional images of the eyes can be used to guide lasers to make these incisions. can also then break up the cataract as in phacoemulsification.\n\nStem cells have been used in a clinical trial for lens regeneration in twelve children under the age of two with cataracts present at birth. The children were followed for six months, so it is unknown what the long-term results will be, and it is unknown if this procedure would work in adults.\n\n\n"}

Tobey\n\nCharles William Tobey (July 22, 1880July 24, 1953) was an American politician, who was a Governor of New Hampshire and a United States senator.\n\nHe was born in Roxbury, Massachusetts, the son of William Tobey, an accountant, and Ellen Hall Parker Tobey. His father had moved to Massachusetts from Maine in the 1860s. Charles Tobey had relatively little formal education. He attended the Roxbury Latin School for four years (being part of the Class of 1897), but was forced to withdraw before graduation because of family financial difficulties. He had a thorough knowledge of the Bible, however, which he gained from his mother, an ardent Baptist. As a result, Tobey's speeches were always marked by a generous sprinkling of biblical quotations and classical allusions.\n\nOn June 4, 1902, Tobey married Francelia Lovett. A year later they began to spend summers in Temple, New Hampshire, on an old farm that they had purchased. For several years Tobey commuted during the summers to Boston, where he worked as a clerk for various insurance and banking firms. In 1911, however, he decided to move to Temple and become a full-time farmer. He was a good poultryman and considered himself a farmer for the remainder of his life, although in 1916 he moved to Manchester, New Hampshire, to resume a career as a bond salesman. His four children were born in Temple, which Tobey always maintained as his legal residence.\n\nTobey served on the Temple school board and the board of selectmen. In 1914 he was elected to the state legislature as a candidate of the Progressive Party. He was a friend and disciple of the progressive Republican Robert P. Bass, a former governor. New Hampshire progressivism was characterized by an effort to democratize the processes and make equitable the administration of government and to challenge powerful economic interests such as the Boston and Maine Railroad. Tobey's hard-working manner, wit, and commonsense intelligence led to his political success. He served three non-consecutive terms in the New Hampshire House of Representatives and was speaker in 1919-1920, winning an important victory over the old-guard candidate. Tobey had returned to the Republican Party after the 1914 election.\n\nTobey's experience in the bonding business as well as his general reputation and political contacts led to his selection as New Hampshire Liberty Loan chairman during World War I. Later, as a member of the New Hampshire Food Administration, he came to know Herbert Hoover, who, together with Bass and Charles Evans Hughes, greatly influenced Tobey's political beliefs.\n\nIn 1924 Tobey was elected to the New Hampshire Senate, and he served as president of that body during the administration of progressive governor John Gilbert Winant. In 1928, despite opposition in the primary from the old guard, led by George Moses, Tobey won the governorship. During the first two years of the Great Depression, he retained a progressive approach to government operation and continued the state road-building program. But Tobey resembled President Hoover in his budget-tightening approach to economic disaster.\n\nTobey did not run for re-election in 1930, in part because of personal financial problems. In 1932, however, he won a seat in the United States House of Representatives and was re-elected in 1934 and 1936. Tobey supported early New Deal relief measures, but became an increasingly outspoken foe of Franklin D. Roosevelt. He opposed efforts to restructure the economy, and he expressed great concern over the growth of executive power. In 1938 he joined Styles Bridges, another Bass protégé and the manager of Tobey's 1928 gubernatorial victory, in the United States Senate.\n\nTobey joined with the isolationist bloc in the Senate in opposition to the Roosevelt administration's policies on neutrality and preparedness. He blamed producers of war materials for American entry into World War I. He allied himself with Gerald Nye, Charles Lindbergh, and the America First Committee, and his statements occasionally contained elements of anti-Semitism. Bass and other internationalists among his old allies broke with Tobey on this issue, and the junior senator was further isolated when Styles Bridges became the champion of preparedness.\n\nAfter the Attack on Pearl Harbor, Tobey supported the war, but his enthusiasm was limited. However, political as well as philosophical considerations led him to a more internationalist position by 1944. Facing an election challenge from the Bass wing of the party as well as from the followers of Bridges and Frank Knox, Tobey sought and received an appointment as delegate to the United Nations Monetary and Financial Conference at Bretton Woods, New Hampshire; he also defended the International Monetary Fund, but he still rejected the \"one-worlders,\" as he described the Wendell Willkie wing of his party. In the days immediately following the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, Tobey was criticized by other Senators for revealing classified details of the extent of the damage done to the Navy; Tobey argued that the people had the right to know the truth.\n\nTobey joined with Wayne Morse and George Aiken in opposing Robert A. Taft's leadership of the Senate Republicans and supporting President Harry S. Truman on several important votes during the 80th Congress. The illness and death of his wife in 1947 restricted his role in the Marshall Plan debate, but by then he had clearly become an advocate of interdependence. On May 26, 1948, Tobey married Loretta Capell Rabenhorst. After his second wife's death, he married Lillian Crompton in 1952.\n\nThe same year Tobey supported the presidential election of Dwight D. Eisenhower. An early opponent of Senator Joseph McCarthy, Tobey was re-elected despite a Bridges-led challenge that accused him of being soft on Communism. Further national recognition came to him through his role in the nationally televised hearings on organized crime, the Kefauver hearings. Tobey was at the peak of his career when he died suddenly in Bethesda, Maryland from a coronary thrombosis at the Bethesda Naval Hospital. He is buried at the Miller Cemetery in Temple, New Hampshire.\n\nTobey's politics were variously described as liberal, conservative, and progressive. None of these terms is quite adequate. A quiet, non-aggressive nationalism and an unwavering belief in the dignity of the individual capped his values. But his views altered with changing contexts, new definitions of governmental responsibility, and new understanding of the international role of the United States. He was not always on the side of the majority. A \"New York Times\" obituary noted that his \"independence and sharp tongue made him one of the more colorful figures in American public life.\"\n\n\n\n"}

The species is a type of fuxianhuiid, which are distant ancestors of arthropods. Five 520 million-year-old fossil specimens were excavated in southern China and first reported in 2013 by Javier Ortega-Hernández and his colleagues. One specimen shows detailed evidence of a nervous system, \"the fossil may be the oldest and most detailed example of a central nervous system yet identified, with even individual nerves -- rarely preserved soft tissue -- visible enough to study.\"\n\nThe 520 million-year-old fossilized nervous system is the most complete example of its type and could help unravel how the nervous system evolved in early animals.\n\nThe fossil was excavated in southern China. Individual nerves are visible. Fossilized soft tissue is rare, but this particular find, by researchers in the UK, China and Germany, represents the most detailed example of a preserved nervous system yet discovered.\n\n\"Chengjiangocaris kunmingensis\" lived during the Cambrian explosion, a period of rapid evolutionary development about half a billion years ago when most major animal groups first appear in the fossil record. \"C. kunmingensis\" belongs to a group of animals called fuxianhuiids, and was an early ancestor of modern arthropods, which include insects, spiders and crustaceans.\n\n\"This is a unique glimpse into what the ancestral nervous system looked like,\" said study co-author Javier Ortega-Hernández. \"It’s the most complete example of a central nervous system from the Cambrian period.\"\n\nStarting about 2010, researchers have identified partially-fossilized nervous systems in several different species from the period, but these have mostly been fossilized brains. And in most of those specimens, the fossils only preserved details of the profile of the brain.\n\n\"C. kunmingensis\" looked like a crustacean, with a broad, almost heart-shaped head shield, and a long body with many pairs of legs of varying sizes. Through careful preparation of the fossils, which involved chipping away the surrounding rock with a fine needle, the researchers were able to view not only the hard parts of the body, but fossilized soft tissue as well.\n\nThe vast majority of excavated fossils preserve bone and other hard body parts such as teeth or exoskeletons. Since the nervous system and soft tissues are essentially made of fatty-like substances, finding them preserved as fossils is extremely rare. The researchers behind this study first identified a fossilized central nervous system in 2013, but the new material has allowed them to investigate the significance of these finding in much greater depth.\n\nThe central nervous system coordinates all neural and motor functions. In vertebrates, it consists of the brain and spinal cord, but in arthropods it consists of a condensed brain and a chain-like series of interconnected masses of nervous tissue called ganglia that resemble a string of beads. Like modern arthropods, \"C. kunmingensis\" had a nerve cord, analogous to a spinal cord in vertebrates, running throughout its body, with each one of the bead-like ganglia controlling a single pair of walking legs. Closer examination of the exceptionally preserved ganglia revealed dozens of spindly fibers, each measuring about five thousandths of a millimeter in length. \"These delicate fibers displayed a highly regular distribution pattern, and so we wanted to figure out if they were made of the same material as the ganglia that form the nerve cord,\" according to Ortega-Hernández. \"Using fluorescence microscopy, we confirmed that the fibers were in fact individual nerves, fossilized as carbon films, offering an unprecedented level of detail. These fossils greatly improve our understanding of how the nervous system evolved.\" For Ortega-Hernández and his colleagues, a key question is what this discovery tells us about the evolution of early animals, since the nervous system contains so much information. Further analysis revealed that some aspects of the nervous system in \"C. kunmingensis\" appear to be structured similar to that of modern priapulids (penis worms) and onychophorans (velvet worms), with regularly-spaced nerves coming out from the ventral nerve cord. In contrast, these dozens of nerves have been lost independently in the tardigrades (water bears) and modern arthropods, suggesting that simplification played an important role in the evolution of the nervous system.\n\nPossibly one of the most striking implications of the study is that the exceptionally preserved nerve cord of \"C. kunmingensis\" represents a unique structure that is otherwise unknown in living organisms.\n\n\n"}

He was highly successful as a composer and influential, especially on the development of imitative counterpoint, and numerous compositions of his survive. Most of what is known about his life and career is inferred.\n\nMost musical manuscripts give his name only as \"Caron.\" But his contemporary, the music theorist Johannes Tinctoris names him in three different treatises as \"Firminus Caron\" and the Vatican choirbook San Pietro B80 has \"F. Caron\" written above its copy of his \"Missa L'homme armé\". Attempts in the past to identify him with people named Philippe Caron and Jean Caron are therefore to be discarded. Furthermore, a reference to \"Firminus Caron\" as \"primus musicus\" at Amiens cathedral in 1422 has now been shown to be misdated: his activity in Amiens is attested by numerous documents dating from 1459 to 1475 (when his father died). A document of 1473 names him \"maistre Fremin le Caron,\" implying that he had a university master's degree, and that of 1475 names him \"sire Fremin le Caron,\" meaning that he had been ordained a priest.\n\nSome writers of the time, including Tinctoris, praised Caron. Most of Caron's music survives in Italian manuscripts, leading to the hypothesis that he may have spent some time in Italy, a common destination for composers from northern Europe: however many compositions by French composers made their way to Italian manuscripts without being carried there by their composers, so this is not certain.\n\nIn 1472 and 1473, Caron is mentioned by Loyset Compère alongside Guillaume Dufay, and stylistic similarities between the two composers suggests a relation. In addition, one of Caron's masses appears in a Cambrai manuscript dated to 1472 or 1473, the year before Dufay's death there. Caron may have been in Cambrai in the early 1470s and known Dufay, but even that is not certain. References to Caron in writings by music theorists appear as late as 1556, in the writings of German Hermann Finck, indicating the spread and duration of his reputation. Johannes Tinctoris, whose writings are a rich source on 15th-century composers and music theory, extravagantly praises Caron's music, but also mentions that he was poorly educated.\n\nCaron left both sacred and secular music, including five masses and numerous secular songs.\n\nOne of the earliest masses based on the famous tune \"L'homme armé\" is by Caron, and survives in an early 1460s Vatican manuscript along with \"L'homme armé\" masses by several other composers. In Caron's setting the tune is transposed to Dorian mode and elaborated considerably; the upper voices often sing in two-part imitation.\n\nMost of his secular songs were in French, and for three voices, and most survive from Italian manuscripts. Most are rondeaux, and most are in duple meter. One of his songs, \"Helas que pourra devenir\", was extraordinarily famous, and was the second-most-widely distributed song in manuscript sources of the third quarter of the 15th century (\"De tous biens plaine\", by Hayne van Ghizeghem, was the first). It is unusual among songs of the time in using very close imitation, and it seems to have initiated a trend. David Fallows, writing in the New Grove, hypothesises that it may have originated as an instrumental fantasy.\n\n\n"}

He founded a vast library of documents mainly in the history of international labor and socialist movements. He became a militant and clandestine left-wing activist preceding the Years of Lead. \nFeltrinelli is perhaps most famous for his decision to translate and publish Boris Pasternak's novel \"Doctor Zhivago\" in the West after the manuscript was smuggled out of the Soviet Union, in the late 1950s. He died violently under mysterious circumstances.\n\nGiangiacomo Feltrinelli was born in 1926 into one of Italy's wealthiest families, perhaps originating in Feltre. His father Carlo controlled numerous companies including Credito Italiano, Edison and Legnami Feltrinelli, which managed vast lumber holdings in central Europe, some having provided sleepers for the enormous extension of Italian railway tracks in the nineteenth century. Carlo died in 1935. At the instigation of Giangiacomo's monarchist mother, Italian leader Benito Mussolini had him created marquess of Gargnano at the age of twelve. His mother Giannalisa Gianzana Feltrinelli married in 1940 Luigi Barzini, editor of the Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera. During the Second World War, the family left the Villa Feltrinelli in Gargnano, north of Salò, to be occupied by Mussolini, and moved to Monte Argentario.\n\nThe young Giangiacomo first took an interest in the living conditions of workers and the poor during discussions with the staff who ran his family's estate. He came to believe that under capitalism most people could never attain his privileges and were compelled to sell their labour for a pittance to industrialists and landowners. During the latter stages of the Second World War, Giangiacomo joined the \"Legnano\" Combat Group and at the same time enrolled in the Italian Communist Party (PCI), fighting the invading German army and the remnants of Mussolini's regime.\n\nIn the post-war period, the PCI held an influential position in the Italian electorate (after 1948 it became the main opposition). The country was in economic ruins and the Party's opposition to Mussolini had gained it great popularity. The PCI was in coalition until 1947.\n\nThe elder Carlo Feltrinelli's will had made Giangiacomo heir to three-quarters of his assets, and they came fully under his control when he came of age 21 in 1947. Banca Unione (formerly Banca Feltrinelli) was controlled by Giangiacomo until 1968, when it was taken over by Michele Sindona. According to some interpretations Sindona was pushed to buy out Feltrinelli by IOR, the Vatican Bank, a minority shareholder embarrassed by cohabitation with a communist partner.\n\nFrom 1949 Feltrinelli collected documents for the Giangiacomo Feltrinelli Library in Milan, documenting the history of ideas, in particular those related to the development of the international labor and socialist movements. The Library later became an Institute; later still the Giangiacomo Feltrinelli Foundation, possessing some 200,000 rare and modern books, extensive collections of newspapers and periodicals, both historical and current, and over a million primary source materials.\n\nNear the end of 1954, Giangiacomo Feltrinelli established a publishing company in Milan, \"Giangiacomo Feltrinelli Editore\". Its first published book was the autobiography of the first Indian Prime Minister, Jawaharlal Nehru.\n\nIn late 1956 an Italian journalist showed Feltrinelli the manuscript of \"Doctor Zhivago\" by the Russian writer Boris Pasternak. Set in Russia, the novel follows a multitude of characters from 1903 to 1943, the period of revolution, bloody civil war, Leninism, Stalinism, and the early part of the Second World War. Feltrinelli's Slavist advisor told him, \"Not to publish a novel like this would constitute a crime against culture\". His son Carlo's biography of Feltrinelli records the fascinating correspondence between him and Pasternak, as they successfully resisted clumsy attempts by the Soviet regime to halt publication of the novel. \"Doctor Zhivago\" immediately became an international best seller. Feltrinelli sold the film rights to Metro-Goldwyn-Meyer for $450,000 and, adjusting for inflation, it was produced in 1965, and became one of the highest-grossing films of all time; it was also critically aclaimed. As a result of his defiance of the communist leadership in Moscow, which had not wanted the book published, Feltrinelli was criticised, and he decided not to renew his party membership in 1957, though he kept on good terms with the PCI. But the PCI leaders were reluctant to be seen to condone criticism of the Soviet Union.\n\n\"Feltrinelli Editore\" scored another coup in 1958 when it published a book rejected by every other significant Italian publisher: \"The Leopard\" by Giuseppe Tomasi di Lampedusa. Described by some as the greatest novel of the century, \"The Leopard\" centres on the Sicilian nobility during the Risorgimento of the mid-19th century, when the Italian middle class rose violently and formed a united Italy under Giuseppe Garibaldi and the House of Savoy.\n\nDespite these successes, Feltrinelli Editore in this period lost about 400 million lire a year on a turnover of 1.207 billion lire, because Feltrinelli believed in keeping his prices low for maximum readership access. Still, Feltrinelli Libra (a chain of bookstores) had a nominal capital of 120 million in 1956. Feltrinelli Masonite, which he chaired, had a turnover of 1.421 billion in 1965. Another firm which he advised on real estate construction had a capital of 400 million in 1970. So ample funds were available from his other investments.\n\nWhatever his own reading tastes, Feltrinelli was always keen to promote the avant-garde, including the works of the influential literary circle, Group 63. He also took the risk of publishing and distributing novels banned under obscenity laws, such as Henry Miller's \"Tropic of Cancer\".\n\nStarting in Pisa in 1957, Feltrinelli built up a chain of retail outlets which after his death became the largest in Italy; it had over a hundred bookshops.\n\nIn 1960 Feltrinelli married the German photographer, Inge Schönthal, and they had a son and heir, Carlo. Inge eventually became the de facto head of the publishing house as Giangiacomo came to devote himself to clandestine political activity, of which she disapproved. Mother and son still run \"Feltrinelli Editore\" together.\n\nIn the post-war period Feltrinelli had joined the Italian Socialist Party (PSI) before moving to the Italian Communist Party (PCI), which he left in 1957.\n\nFeltrinelli spent the Sixties travelling the world and making links with various radical Third World leaders and guerrilla movements. In the Cuban house of the photographer Alberto Korda, Feltrinelli saw and was given the iconic photo of Che Guevara now seen everywhere. Within six months of Che’s assassination, Feltrinelli sold over two million posters bearing the image. In 1964, Feltrinelli met the leader of the Cuban revolution, Fidel Castro. In 1967 Feltrinelli went to Bolivia and met with Régis Debray. Feltrinelli published the writings of figures such as Fidel Castro, Che Guevara and Ho Chi Minh, and a series of pamphlets on the unfolding insurgencies and wars in Southeast Asia and the Middle East. He was a close friend of the student leader Rudi Dutschke, whom he invited to convalesce in Italy when seriously wounded in an assassination attempt. Feltrinelli gave financial support to the Palestine Liberation Front among other causes. \nIn 1968 Feltrinelli went to Sardinia to make contact with left-wing and separatist groups on the island, intending to make Sardinia the Cuba of the Mediterranean and \"liberate it from colonialism\". His attempt to strengthen Graziano Mesina's rebel forces was eventually nullified by the Italian secret military intelligence.\n\nFeltrinelli increasingly advocated guerrilla activity in Italy on behalf of the working class. (His sometime stepfather Luigi Barzini thought Giangiacomo preferred the company of men who \"despised the masses as he did, who thought them something they could play with.\") In 1970, fearing a right-wing coup, Feltrinelli founded the militant Gruppi di Azione Partigiana (Partisan Action Groups, GAP). GAP would become the second militant organization after the Red Brigades to be formed during the Years of Lead. Anticipating assassination attempts by the CIA or Mossad, Feltrinelli assumed a \"nom de guerre\" (\"Osvaldo\") and went underground.\n\nOn 15 March 1972, Feltrinelli was found dead at the foot of a pylon of a high-voltage power-line at Segrate, near Milan, apparently killed by his own explosives while on an operation with other GAP members. Some 8,000 people attended Feltrinelli's funeral. His death, like his father's 37 years before, was immediately viewed suspiciously, but Luigi Barzini had considered and rejected the possibility of it having been a killing at the time of Feltrinelli's death:\n\nIn 1974 an audio recording found in a shelter of the Red Brigades described Feltrinelli as \n\nIn 1979, during an anti-terrorist trial, the Red Brigades defendants read into the court record a signed statement that Feltrinelli\n\nThe defendants denied the thesis of the murder, claiming it was a commemoration of the publisher and his political ideas, and a critique addressed to the circles of the extra-parliamentary left who had tried to deny them. They also admitted that Feltrinelli was not obsessed with a neo-fascist coup, because he wanted to establish in Italy the armed struggle and was one of the first to have had contacts with the German Red Army Faction: finally they affirmed that the relationships between GAP and RB were characterized by the maximum correctness, without competitive spirit.\n\nThe trial ended with 11 convictions, 7 acquittals, 2 prescriptions and 9 amnesties (this legal sentence was largely confirmed in 1981).\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "407904", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=407904", "title": "Health in China", "text": "Health in China\n\nAn emphasis on public health and preventive treatment characterized health policy from the beginning of the 1950s. At that time the party began to mobilize the population to engage in mass \"patriotic health campaigns\" aimed at improving the low level of environmental sanitation and hygiene and attacking certain diseases. One of the best examples of this approach was the mass assaults on the \"four pests\"—rats, sparrows, flies, and mosquitoes—and on schistosoma-carrying snails. Particular efforts were devoted in the health campaigns to improving water quality through such measures as deep-well construction and human-waste treatment. Only in the larger cities had human waste been centrally disposed. In the countryside, where \"night soil\" has always been collected and applied to the fields as fertilizer, it was a major source of disease. Since the 1950s, rudimentary treatments such as storage in pits, composting, and mixture with chemicals have been implemented. As a result of preventive efforts, such epidemic diseases as cholera, bubonic plague, typhoid fever, and scarlet fever have almost been eradicated. The mass mobilization approach proved particularly successful in the fight against syphilis, which was reportedly eliminated by the 1960s. The incidence of other infectious and parasitic diseases was reduced and controlled.\n\nPolitical turmoil and famine following the failure of the Great Leap Forward led to starvation of 20 million people in China. Beginning in 1961 the recovery had more moderate policies inaugurated by President Liu Shaoqi ended starvation and improved nutrition. The coming of the Cultural Revolution weakened epidemic control, causing a rebound in epidemic diseases and malnutrition in some areas.\n\nBarefoot doctors were a good contribution to primary health systems in China during the Cultural Revolution (1964–1976). It encompasses all principles stated in primary health care. Community participation is possible because the team is composed from village health workers in the area. There’s equity because it was more available and combined western and tradition medicines. Intersectoral coordination is achieved by preventative measures rather than curative. Lastly it’s comprehensive using rural practices rather than urban ones.\n\nThe \"barefoot doctor system\" was based in the people's communes. With the disappearance of the people's communes, the barefoot doctor system lost its base and funding. The decollectivization of agriculture resulted in a decreased desire on the part of the rural populations to support the collective welfare system, of which health care was a part. In 1984 surveys showed that only 40 to 45 percent of the rural population was covered by an organized cooperative medical system, as compared with 80 to 90 percent in 1979.\n\nThis shift entailed a number of important consequences for rural health care. The lack of financial resources for the cooperatives resulted in a decrease in the number of barefoot doctors, which meant that health education and primary and home care suffered and that in some villages sanitation and water supplies were checked less frequently. Also, the failure of the cooperative health care system limited the funds available for continuing education for barefoot doctors, thereby hindering their ability to provide adequate preventive and curative services. The costs of medical treatment increased, deterring some patients from obtaining necessary medical attention. If the patients could not pay for services received, then the financial responsibility fell on the hospitals and commune health centers, in some cases creating large debts.\n\nConsequently, in the post-Mao era of modernization, the rural areas were forced to adapt to a changing health care environment. Many barefoot doctors went into private practice, operating on a fee-for-service basis and charging for medication. But soon farmers demanded better medical services as their incomes increased, bypassing the barefoot doctors and going straight to the commune health centers or county hospitals. A number of barefoot doctors left the medical profession after discovering that they could earn a better living from farming, and their services were not replaced. The leaders of brigades, through which local health care was administered, also found farming to be more lucrative than their salaried positions, and many of them left their jobs. Many of the cooperative medical programs collapsed. Farmers in some brigades established voluntary health-insurance programs but had difficulty organizing and administering them.\n\nTheir income for many basic medical services limited by regulations, Chinese grassroots health care providers have supported themselves by charging for giving injections and selling medicines. This has led to a serious problem of disease spread through health care as patients received too many injections and injections by unsterilized needles. Corruption and disregard for the rights of patients have become serious problems in the Chinese health care system.\n\nThe Chinese economist, Yang Fan, wrote in 2001 that lip service being given to the old socialist health care system and deliberately ignoring and failing to regulate the actual private health care system is a serious failing of the Chinese health care system. \"The old argument that \"health is a kind of welfare to save lives and assist the injured\" is so far removed from reality that things are really more like its opposite. The welfare health system supported by public funds essentially exists in name only. People have to pay for most medical services on their own. Considering health to be still a \"welfare activity\" has for some time been a major obstacle to the development of proper physician - patient relationship and to the law applicable to that relationship.\"\n\nDespite the decline of the public health care system during the first decade of the reform era, Chinese health improved sharply as a result of greatly improved nutrition, especially in rural areas, and the recovery of the epidemic control system, which had been neglected during the Cultural Revolution.\n\nSome measures used to indicate health include Total Fertility Rate, Infant Mortality Rate, Life Expectancy, Crude Birth and Death Rate. As of 2017, China has a Total Fertility Rate of 1.6 children born per woman, an Infant Mortality rate of 10 deaths per 1000 live births, Crude Birth Rate of 13 births per 1000 people and a Death Rate of 7 deaths per 1000 people. Since 1949, China had a huge improvement in population's health. There are health related parameters:\n\n\nIn general, all indices showed improvement except the drop around 1960 due to the failure of the Great Leap Forward, which led to starvation of tens of millions of people. From 1950 to 2012, life expectancy nearly doubled (41.6-75.1). Total Fertility Rate changed from 5.3 to 1.7 which mainly caused by One-child policy. Infant Mortality rate and Under-5 mortality rate went down sharply. Though there is no data from 1963 to 1967, we can see the trend. The gap between IMR and U5MR became smaller and smaller, which indicates health in children has been promoted.\nMaternal Mortality Ratio isn't showed in the graph due to having insufficient data, but it did go down from 164.5(1980) to 26.5(2011).\n\nCreated in 1979, under Deng Xiaoping, the One-Child Policy incentivized families to have children later and to only have one child or risk penalization. The One-Child Policy was a program created by the Chinese government as a reaction to the increasing population during the 1970s, that was thought to have negatively impacted China's economic growth. Implementation of the program included rewarding families who followed the program, fining families who resisted the policy, offering birth control/ contraceptives, and in some cases forced abortions. The policy was unevenly implemented throughout China and was easier established in urban areas rather than rural, because of ideals about family size and gender preferences. Prior to the One-Child Policy, the Chinese government had encouraged families to have more children in order to increase the future workforce, however, this promotion made the population of China in the 1970s increase at an alarming rate. Additionally, voluntary programs, involving family planning and contraceptive use, were proposed before the One-Child Policy was fully enforced.\n\nThe One-Child Policy was successful in halting China's increasing population and decreased both the birth rate and population, However, the harsh enforcement of the policy created long-term changes to some of China's health indicators. For instance, favoring males over female children lead to many forced abortions, infanticide and abandoned female children which have lead to an imbalance of men to women in China. Additionally, birth rates and rate of natural increase have decreased as a result of the One-Child Policy\n\nOther Consequences of the One-Child Policy include difficulties accessing education and employment as a result of being an undocumented birth.\n\nChina's dependency ratio is unfavorable because of the policy and its elderly population (65+) will outgrow the working aged people. The elderly population in China is highly reliant on the working aged people for support and the number of dependents (children 0-14, adults 65+) are increasing compared to the number of working aged people. China's population is aging and the number of children born is less than the replacement rate.\n\nSmoking related illnesses killed 1.2 million in the People's Republic of China; however, the state tobacco monopoly, the China National Tobacco Corporation, supplies 7 to 10% of government revenues, as of 2011, 600 billion yuan, about 100 billion US dollars.\n\nSex education lags in China due to cultural conservatism. From ancient China to the first half of the 20th century, formal sex education was not taught. Instead, a woman's parents were mostly responsible for her sex education after she is wed. Many Chinese feel that sex education should be limited to biological science. Combined with migration of young unmarried women to the cities, lack of knowledge of contraception has resulted in increasing numbers of abortions by young women.\n\nThe Basic Health Services Project piloted strategies to ensure equitable access to China's rural health system; health outcomes for women improved significantly, with substantial declines in maternal mortality due to increased coverage of maternal health services.\n\nAlthough not identified until later, China’s first case of a new, highly contagious disease, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), occurred in Guangdong in November 2002, and within three months the Ministry of Health reported 300 SARS cases and five deaths in the province. Dr. Jiang Yanyong exposed the level of danger the SARS outbreak posed to China. By May 2003, some 8,000 cases of SARS had been reported worldwide; about 66 percent of the cases and 349 deaths occurred in China alone. By early summer 2003, the SARS epidemic had ceased. A vaccine was developed and first-round testing on human volunteers completed in 2004.\n\nThe 2002 SARS in China demonstrated at once the decline of the PRC epidemic reporting system, the deadly consequences of secrecy on health matters and, on the positive side, the ability of the Chinese central government to command a massive mobilization of resources once its attention is focused on one particular issue. Despite the suppression of news regarding the outbreak during the early stages of the epidemic, the outbreak was soon contained and cases of SARS failed to emerge. Obsessive secrecy seriously delayed the isolation of SARS by Chinese scientists. On 18 May 2004, the World Health Organization announced the PRC free of further cases of SARS.\n\nWork with the CDC has created goals of decelerating the spread of Hepatitis B through Immunization efforts\n\nThe AIDS disaster of Henan in the mid-1990s is estimated to be the largest man-made health catastrophe, affecting five-hundred thousand to one million persons. It was also in Hebei, Anhui, Shanxi, Shaanxi, Hubei and Guizhou. HIV was transmitted via blood sale. Blood plasma mixture from several persons was returned so that same person could give blood up to 11 times a day. The disaster was only recognized in 2000 and found out abroad in 2001. Pensioner Gao Yaojie sold her house to deliver data leaflets of HIV to people, while officials tried to prevent her. Some local officials and politicians were involved in the blood sale. In 2003 only 2.6% of Chinese knew that a condom could protect from AIDS.\n\nChina blocked by police protest over ineffective drug treatments, cancelled meetings on HIV groups, closured office of the AIDS organization, and detained or put under house arrest prominent AIDS activists such as 2005 Reebok Human Rights Award winner Li Dan, eighty-year-old AIDS activist Dr. Gao Yaojie, and the husband-and-wife HIV activist team of Hu Jia (activist) and Zeng Jinyan.\n\nChina, similar to other nations with migrant and socially mobile populations, has experienced increased incidences of human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immune deficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS). By the mid-1980s, some Chinese physicians recognized HIV and AIDS as a serious health threat but considered it to be a \"foreign problem\". As of mid-1987 only two Chinese citizens had died from AIDS and monitoring of foreigners had begun. Following a 1987 regional World Health Organization meeting, the Chinese government announced it would join the global fight against AIDS, which would involve quarantine inspection of people entering China from abroad, medical supervision of people vulnerable to AIDS, and establishment of AIDS laboratories in coastal cities. Within China, the rapid increase in venereal disease, prostitution and drug addiction, internal migration since the 1980s and poorly supervised plasma collection practices, especially by the Henan provincial authorities, created conditions for a serious outbreak of HIV in the early 1990s.\n\nAs of 2005 about 1 million Chinese have been infected with HIV, leading to about 150,000 AIDS deaths. Projections are for about 10 million cases by 2010 if nothing is done. Effective preventive measures have become a priority at the highest levels of the government, but progress is slow. A promising pilot program exists in Gejiu partially funded by international donors.\n\nTuberculosis is a major public health problem in China, which has the world's second largest tuberculosis epidemic (after India). Progress in tuberculosis control was slow during the 1990s. Detection of tuberculosis had stagnated at around 30% of the estimated total of new cases, and multidrug-resistant tuberculosis was a major problem. These signs of inadequate tuberculosis control can be linked to a malfunctioning health system. Prevalent smoking aggravates its spread.\n\nLeprosy, also known as Hansen's disease, was officially eliminated at the national level in China by 1982, meaning prevalence is lower than 1 in 100,000. There are 3,510 active cases today. Though leprosy has been brought under control in general, the situation in some areas is worsening, according to China’s Ministry of Health.\n\n100 million Chinese people have mental illnesses that are varying degrees of intensity. Currently, dilemmas such as human rights versus political control, community integration versus community control, diversity versus centrally, huge demand but inadequate services seem to challenge the further development of the mental health service in the PRC. China has 17,000 certified psychologists, which is ten percent of that of other developed countries per capita.\n\nIn the 2000–2002 period, China had one of the highest per capita caloric intakes in Asia, second only to South Korea and higher than countries such as Japan, Malaysia, and Indonesia. In 2003, daily per capita caloric intake was 2,940 (vegetable products 78%, animal products 22%); 125% of FAO recommended minimum requirement.\n\nChina has been developing rapidly for the past 30 years. Though it has uplifted a huge number of people out of poverty, many social issues still remain unsolved. One of them is malnutrition among rural children in China. The problem has diminished but still remains a pertinent national issue. In a survey done in 1998, the stunting rate among children in China was 22 percent and was as high as 46 percent in poor provinces. This shows the huge disparity between urban and rural areas. In 2002, Svedberg found that stunting rate in rural areas of China was 15 percent, reflecting that a substantial number of children still suffer from malnutrition. Another study by Chen shows that malnutrition has dropped from 1990 to 1995 but regional differences are still huge, particularly in rural areas.\n\nIn a recent report by The Rural Education Action Project on children in rural China, many were found to be suffering from basic health problems. 34% have iron deficiency anaemia and 40 percent are infected with intestinal worms. Many of these children do not have proper or sufficient nutrition. Often, this causes them not being able to fully reap the benefits of education, which can be a ticket out of poverty.\n\nOne possible reason for poor nutrition in rural areas is that agricultural produce can fetch a decent price, and thus is often sold rather than kept for personal consumption. Rural families would not consume eggs that their hen lay but will sell it in the market for about 20 yuan per kilogram. The money will then be spent on books or food like instant noodles which lack nutrition value compared to an egg. A girl named Wang Jing in China has a bowl of pork only once every five to six weeks, compared to urban children who have a vast array of food chains to choose from.\n\nA survey conducted by China’s Ministry of Health showed the kind of food consumed by rural households. 30 percent consume meat less than once a month. 23 percent consume rice or egg less than once a month.\n\nIn a 2008 Report on Chinese Children Nutrition and Health Conditions, West China still has 7.6 million poor children who were shorter and weigh lesser than urban children. These rural children were also shorter by 4 centimetres and 0.6 kilograms lighter than World Health Organisation standards. It can be concluded that children in West China still lack quality nutrition.\n\nThe most comprehensive epidemiological study of nutrition ever conducted was the China-Oxford-Cornell Study on Dietary, Lifestyle and Disease Mortality Characteristics in 65 Rural Chinese Counties, known as the \"China Project\", which began in 1983. Its findings are discussed in \"The China Study\" by T. Colin Campbell.\n\nChina has problems in certain western provinces in iodine deficiency.\n\nAvian Influenza A(H7N4) Virus\n\nThe first known human contraction of Avian Influenza (bird flu), after contact with live poultry in February 2018, was diagnosed to a woman living in the Jiangsu Province of China.\n\nMany of China's water sources, including underground sources and rivers, have been heavily polluted because of industry and economic growth. Increased exposure to polluted water and air has created \"cancer villages\" and further health and environmental problems. A majority of groundwater and shallow wells surveyed in China showed signs of heavy pollution, by measuring nitrate levels which indicate water contamination\n\nBy 2002, 92 percent of the urban population and 8 (? resource?) percent of the rural population had access to an improved water supply, and 69 percent of the urban population and 32 percent of the rural population had access to improved sanitation facilities.\n\nAlthough China has made great efforts of making sanitary facilities and safe water more accessible, there are water and sanitation disparities all over China. As of 2012, sanitary facilities were available to 69% of the Chinese people and 71% of water in China is piped, yet it is still difficult preserving drinking water that is affordable and efficient at a communal level. Additionally, water in both urban and rural areas of China are still vulnerable to disease, pollution, and contamination, with rural areas at higher risk of sewage contamination.\n\nThe lack of sanitation in multiple areas of China has affected many student for decades. An absence of modern-day toilets and hand washing areas have directly affected students nationwide. The lack of reliable drinking water and sanitation areas, along with many others health issues, has directly led to 1/3 of young students in China having intestinal parasites.\n\nThe Patriotic Health Campaign, first started in the 1950s, are campaigns aimed to improve sanitation and hygiene in China. UNICEF also plans to incorporate government programs and policies in order to improve normal health standards in China. The programs and policies are used to teach students about basic hygiene and form campaigns encouraging people to wash their hands with soap instead of water only.\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) Constitution came into force on 7 April 1948, and China has been a Member since the beginning.\n\nThe WHO China office has increased its scope of activities significantly in recent years, especially following the major SARS outbreak of 2003. The role of WHO China is to provide support for the government's health programs, working closely with the Ministry of Health and other partners within the government, as well as with UN agencies and other organizations.\n\nChina's government with WHO assistance and support has strengthened public health in the nation. The current Five Year Plan incorporates public health in a significant way. The government has acknowledged that even as millions upon millions of citizens are prospering amid the country's economic boom, millions of others are lagging behind, with healthcare many cannot afford. The challenge for China is to strengthen its health care system across the spectrum, to reduce the disparities and create a more equitable situation regarding access to health care services for the population at large.\n\nAt the same time, in an ever-interconnected world, China has embraced its responsibility to global public health, including the strengthening of surveillance systems aimed at swiftly identifying and tackling the threat of infectious diseases such as SARS and avian influenza. Another major challenge is the epidemic of HIV/AIDS, a key priority for China.\n\nThe staff of the WHO Office in China are working with their national counterparts in the following areas:\n\n\nIn addition, WHO technical experts in specialty areas can be made available on a short-term basis, when requested by the Chinese government. China is an active, contributing member of WHO, and has made valuable contributions to global and regional health policy. Technical experts from China have contributed to WHO through their membership on various WHO technical expert advisory committees and groups.\n\n\n"}

It is found in article 138 which states: \"He who kills another will be punished, as a defendant of homicide, with a prison sentence of ten to fifteen years\".\n\nThe main legal concept in article 138 is bad faith. It may be present in any form, whether direct or indirect. The active subject (he who kills) as well as the passive subject (he who is killed) are universal, meaning that either can be any person, regardless of the circumstances.\n\nHomicide committed by grave recklessness is covered in article 142, which includes both reckless homicide by weapons or motor vehicles and homicide caused by professional recklessness. It states:\n\n\"1. He who by grave recklessness causes the death of another will be punished, as a defendant of reckless homicide, with a prison sentence of one to four years.\n\n2. When the reckless homicide is committed using a motor vehicle, a motorcycle or a firearm, the defendant will also be deprived of his right to drive motor vehicles or motorcycles or the right to possess and carry arms for one to six years.\n\n3. When the homicide is committed by professional recklessness, the defendant will also be prohibited from exercising his profession or office for a period of three to six years.\"\n\nHomicide by minor recklessness is covered in article 621.2 of the Criminal Code:\n\"2. Those who by minor recklessness cause the death of another person will be punished with a fine of one to two months\".\n\nIt is necessary to indicate that in Spanish law, involuntary homicide is not regulated; in the majority of cases the law that will be applied will be somewhere between homicide and the criminal concept which is involved.\n\nOther specific concepts, such as parricide and uxoricide also do not exist, since in Spanish criminal law the punishment is founded in the violation of the legal right and not the fact of killing one particular person or another. For these cases, the circumstances of kinship, found in article 23, could be used as aggravating.\n\n\n"}

The second son of the 6th Marquess of Salisbury, Lord Richard was in Rhodesia with a freelance film-maker, Nick Downie, recording material for a television documentary about the war. Carrying a rifle and wearing a Rhodesian Army uniform, he was shot dead at close range by a member of the Zimbabwe African National Liberation Army. The Rhodesian government reported that Lord Richard had been \"killed in action\"; his body was returned to the United Kingdom for burial.\n\nThe Cecil family had long-standing connections with Rhodesia. The death of Lord Richard was one of a number of events during 1978 that brought Rhodesia's Unilateral Declaration of Independence (UDI) to an abrupt end; it was the identity of the deceased, and the nature of his loss, that affected UDI's supporters.\n\nLord Richard was the son of Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, 6th Marquess of Salisbury. His mother was Marjorie (Mollie) Olein Wyndham-Quin, granddaughter of the Earl of Dunraven and Mount-Earl, who had married his father in 1945.\n\nThe Cecil family had well established links with Rhodesia, the capital city of which was named Salisbury after the third Marquess (it was renamed Harare in 1982 on the second anniversary of Zimbabwean independence). The family had extensive land holdings in the country and the fifth Marquess (Lord Richard's grandfather) was a leading British supporter of the white minority UDI government that ruled Rhodesia from 1965-1979.\n\nLord Richard was the eldest of the younger brothers of Robert Cecil, Viscount Cranborne, who has been both an MP and the Leader of the House of Lords. In 2003, Cranborne became 7th Marquess of Salisbury upon the death of his father.\n\nLord Richard was educated at Eton College and at the Royal Military Academy, Sandhurst. After graduating from Sandhurst, he was commissioned in the Grenadier Guards. After three tours of duty in Northern Ireland (mentioned in dispatches in 1973) he attained the rank of Captain. He decided not to pursue a career in the military and resigned his commission with a view to pursuing a career in politics.\n\nHe enrolled on a degree course in politics at the University of Sussex in 1973, although it is believed that he rarely attended classes and never graduated. In July 1974, he was selected as the Conservative Party candidate for Barrow-in-Furness and contested the seat at the October 1974 general election. During the election campaign, he complained about the restraints being placed on military action in Northern Ireland by politicians. He suggested the possibility of making military incursions into the Republic of Ireland in order to kill IRA members sheltering there. The sitting Labour MP defeated Lord Richard by 7,400 votes and there was a 3% swing from Conservative to Labour in the constituency. Thereafter, he decided to become a freelance journalist while seeking a winnable Conservative seat to contest at the next election.\n\nLord Richard's military background and social connections led him to Southern Africa in the mid 1970s, at a time when political unrest in Rhodesia was leading to a state of war between the white-minority government and black nationalist guerrilla forces. He quickly established friendships with prominent Rhodesians including the Foreign Minister, P. K. van der Byl.\n\nWhen the Bush War against black nationalists started in earnest in 1976, Lord Richard used his family connections to gain access to Rhodesian army counter-insurgency operations. In particular, his friendship with \"PK\" allowed him access to events and locations that were off-limits to other journalists. He provided reports that were carried by a number of newspapers (including \"The Times\" and \"Time\" magazine). He also contributed reports to the British ITN TV news service.\n\nLord Richard would accompany Rhodesian army units into action while himself wearing army uniform and carrying a rifle. His obituary (22 April 1978) stated that he was \"prepared to carry a rifle ... and even to use it\". He ignored warnings that such conduct was inappropriate and dangerous for a journalist. Lord Richard was a member of a 20 strong group of correspondents known as the \"Bang Gang\". This group was intimately involved in the Rhodesian cause, and went about their journalistic work heavily armed.\n\nLord Richard was nicknamed \"Young Winston\" by fellow journalists. This referred to similarities between the early careers of Lord Richard and Winston Churchill. The nickname was not used kindly in every case. Some of his fellow journalists considered that his conduct exposed all journalists in Rhodesia to the charge of being combatants - and being treated accordingly in certain eventualities such as capture.\n\nOn 20 April 1978, Lord Richard and freelance film-maker Nick Downie landed by helicopter in North East Rhodesia with an army \"Fireforce\" airborne unit. They both were parachute qualified and were often first and second in the stick to record the war literally first-hand. The two were recording material for use in a TV documentary they were making about the Bush War. While moving through dense undergrowth, Lord Richard encountered a ZANLA fighter who fired at him at a range of less than 5 metres. He was hit by two bullets, first in the thigh and then in the chest, and died after a few minutes. The Rhodesian Ministry of Defence reported him as being \"killed in action\". His body was returned to England for burial.\n\nP. K. van der Byl offered the following comment upon being informed of Lord Richard's death :\n\n\"\"Lord Richard was the finest young man I ever knew and represented the best of everything that made the Englishman great, and built the British Empire.\" \"\n\nLord Richard's funeral service was held at the Church of St Mary and St Bartholomew, Cranborne on 27 April. A memorial service was held for him at the Guards Chapel, Wellington Barracks, on 9 May. Both events were attended by the most prominent personalities from the British aristocracy (including Lord Mountbatten of Burma), the British army and the media.\n\nThe death of Lord Richard was one of a number of events during 1978 that brought UDI to an abrupt end. The loss of one man did not amount to much in the whole scheme of things, but it was the identity of that man and the nature of his loss that had an impact. One factor that had sustained UDI since 1965 was tacit support from some elements in the British establishment who were variously influenced by anti-communism, appreciation of the colonial era's achievements and a wish to safeguard investments. Lord Richard was the embodiment of that support. His death brought the UDI project into question and made certain people think very hard about the wisdom of it.\n\nNick Downie completed filming of the documentary he and Lord Richard had been engaged in. It was broadcast by Thames Television's 30 minute TV Eye programme under the title \"Frontline Rhodesia\".\n\nIn the 1979 British general election, Lord Richard's older brother Robert Cecil, Viscount Cranborne, was elected MP for South Dorset. In his maiden speech to the House, Cranborne urged Rhodesian Prime Minister Ian Smith to end UDI and accept majority rule in Rhodesia under Abel Muzorewa.\n"}

She was then engaged, via menagerie owner Stephen Polito and Edward Cross, by Frederick Henry Yates of the Adelphi Theatre in London, where she debuted on December 3, 1829. This play was titled \"The Elephant of Siam and the Fire Fiend\" and credited to Samuel Beazley, though it may be largely a translation of the French play. D'Jeck remained at the Adelphi through early April before traveling around England.\n\nD'Jeck then traveled to America and debuted at the Bowery Theatre in New York in January 1831, where she had a three-week stand, a very long run for a play at the time. At the Arch Theatre in Philadelphia, the rival Chestnut Theatre brought an unsuccessful lawsuit over who would have the right to show the animal. She returned to England in July 1831.\n\nThe play featured all the tricks the elephant could perform. The historian John Earl notes that the elephant, rather than the author, took a curtain call. \"The Morning Post\" reported, \"After the dropping of the curtain, a general cry was raised of Elephant! Elephant! and accordingly out she came, unattended. … She knelt on her forelegs, bowed gracefully with her proboscis, and retired amidst the universal acclamation from all parts of the house.\"\n\nThe 1858 novelette \"Jack of All Trades\" by Charles Reade is based on D'Jeck and her keeper, violin-maker John Lott.\n\nIn August 1830, while traveling through Morpeth in northeast England, D'Jeck killed one of her keepers. This is likely in response to abuse, though whether D'Jeck had a violent nature or was responding to harsh treatment can be the subject of debate. The resulting court proceedings brought much fanfare, but D'Jeck was let off with a small fine. In 2013, the local November Club theatre group produced a play, \"Dr Mullins’ Anatomy of the Theatre Royal\", based on this story.\n\nD'Jeck was also involved in a number of other incidents where she reportedly harmed people, in England and continental Europe. One summary from 1882 states that after returning to England from America, \"she half-killed a baker. Going to France, she killed another man at Bordeaux. At another place she broke her keeper's arm in two places. In Bavaria, she set her shed on fire.\"\n\nEventually, D'Jeck was shot to death with a circus cannon (after shooting her with rifles was not successful) in June 1837 in Geneva, reportedly for breaking a priest's ribs. Her meat was sold for eating.\n\n\n"}

She moved to New York City before finishing college and became involved in its cultural life. Latimer published two highly acclaimed novels, \"We Are Incredible\" (1928) and \"This is My Body\" (1930), and two collections of short stories, \"Nellie Bloom and Other Stories\" (1929), and \"Guardian Angel and Other Stories\" (1932). (This was reprinted in a new edition in 1984.)\n\nHer formally experimental fiction was greatly influenced by the modernism of the 1920s. Reviewers of the period compared her to Gertrude Stein, James Joyce, and D. H. Lawrence. Her work reflects her feminist, socialist, and anti-racist ideals.\n\nLatimer was the younger daughter of Clark Watt Latimer and Laura Augusta née Bodine. Her Yankee ancestry included New England pioneers Anne Bradstreet and John Cotton.\n\nLatimer published a short story in a local paper in 1917. This caught the attention of her Portage neighbor Zona Gale, a well-known writer, journalist, and suffragist. Gale became the first woman to win the Pulitzer Prize for drama. She became Latimer's mentor and confidante.\n\nLatimer attended Wooster College, but withdrew quickly, then attended the University of Wisconsin–Madison. She withdrew again and moved to New York City, where she started a playwriting course at Columbia University. Gale established a Zona Gale scholarship, tailor-made for Latimer, its first recipient. The younger woman returned to the University of Wisconsin–Madison in 1922. She worked on the campus literary magazine as editor and contributor, and became part of a circle of writers there. She withdrew again in 1923 and returned to New York.\n\nLatimer maintained an intimate correspondence with her mentor until about the time of Gale's marriage in 1928. Admiring Gale greatly, Latimer identified with her and felt betrayed when Gale married. She fictionalized aspects of their complex relationship in the short story \"Possession\" (\"Nellie Bloom and Other Stories\"), the novel \"We Are Incredible\", and the long title story in \"Guardian Angel and Other Stories,\" each time treating her mentor more harshly.\n\nWhile living in New York City’s Greenwich Village in the 1920s, Latimer became active in various social causes. She also reported on contemporary politics for \"The New Masses,\" a radical journal of the twenties. She lived with poet Kenneth Fearing, her romantic partner, and became friends with writers and artists of the period, such as Georgia O'Keeffe, Walt Kuhn, Meridel Le Sueur, Carl Rakosi, and photographer Carl Van Vechten.\n\nBefore her first novel was published in 1928, Latimer had stories published in \"Century\", \"The American Caravan\", \"The Bookman (New York)\" and other journals.\n\nHer essay, \"The New Freedom\", was published in 1924 in \"The Reviewer\". According to scholar Joy Castro, it casts women as \"potential literary progenitors.\" Latimer writes of \"the word ... made flesh, and it is flesh with a mind of its own, infused with the possibility of change...\"\n\nLatimer's novels, \"We Are Incredible\" (1928) and \"This is My Body\" (1930), were highly acclaimed. Her debut novel received notices in the \"New York Times,\" \"McCall's\", \"The Saturday Review of Literature,\" \"Chicago Tribune,\" and others. \n\nIn addition, she published two collections of short stories, \"Nellie Bloom and Other Stories\" (1929), and \"Guardian Angel and Other Stories\" (1932). Her fiction was considered formally experimental and influenced by the modernism of the 1920s. Reviewers of the period compared her to Gertrude Stein, James Joyce, and D. H. Lawrence. Latimer expressed her principles of feminism, socialism, and anti-racism in her work.\n\nIn New York, Latimer met Jean Toomer, a writer associated with modernism and the Harlem Renaissance. Of mixed race, he was known for his first novel, \"Cane\" (1923), a modernist exploration of his African-American roots in Georgia. But he was determined to resist being classified as a Negro writer, saying he was \"an American\", and moved to other topics.\n\nFrom 1924 Toomer had been deeply involved in the Gurdjieff movement in the United States. To test Gurdjieffian ideas of harmonious living, in 1931 Latimer and Toomer, with six other unmarried people, moved to the Witte farm near Briggsville, Wisconsin. The goal was, in Toomer's words, \n\"to eradicate the false veneer of civilization, with its unnatural inhibition, its selfishness, petty meanness and unnatural behavior... Adults can be re-educated to become as natural as little children...\" While the participants seemed to enjoy the experiment, the neighbors in the countryside and in Portage were scandalized. Talk of communism, nudity and sexual license abounded, spiked by Toomer's being of mixed race; hostility arose among the locals. By the end of the summer of 1931, Toomer ended the experiment and documented its demise in his unpublished \"Portage Potential\".\n\nIn October 1931, Latimer and Toomer married at her home in Portage. They left on a wedding trip for Santa Fe, New Mexico, and Pasadena and Carmel, California. They were staying in Carmel when a nationwide, anti-miscegenation scandal broke concerning their marriage, fanned by a sensationalist, exaggerated Hearst newspaper story. Because of threats and hate mail, Latimer's parents moved out of Portage temporarily and stayed with their older daughter Rachel in Montana.\n\nLatimer became pregnant and the couple settled in Chicago, where they took an apartment. During a physical examination, Latimer learned that she had a heart leak. Despite this, she gave birth at home. Shortly after holding her daughter, Latimer hemorrhaged and lapsed into a coma. She died twelve hours later.\n\nToomer named their daughter Margery after his wife. Two years later, the widower remarried, to Marjorie Content, a white photographer. They retired from public life and in 1940 settled in Doylestown, Pennsylvania, where they joined a Quaker meeting. She continued to work some at photography.\n\nThis reprint selects stories from Latimer's two collections, and includes a biographical sketch by Nancy Loughridge. She was writing a biography of Latimer.\n\n"}

Irwin was arrested by the Isle of Man police for this activity in December 2003, but he was never charged.\n\nIn April 1990 Irwin resigned from the World Bank. He wrote an article for The Wall Street Journal which detailed his complaints about the Bank. He cited in particular \"the Bank's bloated, overpaid bureaucracy, its wasteful practices, and its generally poor management.\"\n\nReturning to the UK in 1993, Irwin became the Vice-Chairman of the United Nations Association in 1995, and its chairman from 1996 to 1998.\n\nIrwin is an active supporter of euthanasia, humanism and secularism.

The electron can always be theoretically considered as a bound state of the three, with the spinon carrying the spin of the electron, the orbiton carrying the orbital location and the holon carrying the charge, but in certain conditions they can become deconfined and behave as independent particles.\n\nElectrons, being of like charge, repel each other. As a result, in order to move past each other in an extremely crowded environment, they are forced to modify their behavior. Research published in July 2009 by the University of Cambridge and the University of Birmingham in England showed that electrons could jump from the surface of a metal onto a closely located quantum wire by quantum tunneling, and upon doing so, will separate into two quasiparticles, named spinons and holons by the researchers.\n\nThe orbiton was predicted theoretically by van den Brink, Khomskii and Sawatzky in 1997-1998.\nIts experimental observation as a separate quasiparticle was reported in paper sent to publishers in September 2011.\nThe research states that firing a beam of X-ray photons at a single electron in a one-dimensional sample of strontium cuprate will excite the electron into a higher orbital, causing the beam to lose a fraction of its energy in the process before it rebounds. In doing so, the electron is separated into a spinon and an orbiton.\n\n"}

The film narrates the story of a once successful businessman who was tricked by a herbalist into a failed get-rich-quick scheme, and then decides to commit suicide.\n\n\"Orun Mooru\" narrates the story of Karounwi (Moses Olaiya), a basketmaker who lives in a fishing village. Flashback shows that he used to be a thriving businessman, until he was tricked by a Babalawo (herbalist) into believing that he could fill oil drums with money.\n\nKarounwi receives a loan of ₦500 from a friend. He loses all the money; half to a pickpocket, and the other half when his wife exchanged the drums he saved the money for new plates. This turn of events led him into committing suicide and he finds himself in the underworld.\n\nIku (means: \"Death\") tells him that he isn't ready for his coming, Karounwi then ascends to meet the Ayo (means: \"Joy\"), who then sends him off with two magical eggs and two of her disciples, to escort him back to earth.\n\nUpon reaching earth in a lavish mansion, Karounwi has sex with the two disciples from the underworld, then breaks one of the eggs, which transforms into a huge pile of money. He goes ahead to break the second egg, despite the standing instruction not to do so. Upon doing so, Death appears. \n\nKarounwi is seen coming into his shack in the fishing village.

The piracy happened before the end of the theatrical run of the film; several cinemas in different cities across the country screened the film without being licensed to do so and remuneration never reached the producers. The loss incurred as a result of this piracy significantly affected the career of Moses Olaiya in the film industry, as well as his personal life.

When gifts and bequests exceed the amount of this credit, a tax is imposed.\n\nFor estate tax purposes, any property which passes to a decedent's surviving spouse is not subject to the gift or estate tax; however, generally full ownership of this property must in fact pass to the surviving spouse. A transfer through a QTIP Trust is an exception to this general rule. Under Section 2056 of the Internal Revenue Code, as long as the surviving spouse has a lifetime income interest in the property, the property is treated as passing to the surviving spouse.\n\nThe concept of a \"QTIP trust\" only exists for federal gift and estate tax purposes, and from a state law perspective, such a trust does not differ from any other trust except that it must meet the requirements of the Internal Revenue Code. States which levy an estate tax may also recognize the trust.\n\nFor example, if a Grandpa gives $100,000 to Grandma, this would be a gift to a spouse, exempt from the gift and estate tax. However, if Grandpa were to give the $100,000 to Grandson, this would be included for gift and estate tax purposes. However, Grandpa can place this $100,000 in a QTIP trust which will make payments of money to Grandma during her life, and have the money in the trust pass to Grandson when Grandma dies. This is treated as a marital gift to Grandma, exempt from the gift and estate tax, to the extent of any property received. The amount passing to the Grandson upon the death of Grandma will be included in Grandma's estate for estate tax consideration.\n\nQTIP trusts are commonly used when a spouse has children from another marriage. The other spouse may wish to provide for this spouse and take advantage of the spouse's unified credit against gift and estate tax, but nonetheless designate where the money will go after that spouse is deceased. A QTIP trust allows this to be accomplished in a manner treated as a gift to a spouse.\n\n\nl\n"}

On July 24, 1915, the ship rolled over onto her side while tied to a dock in the Chicago River. A total of 848 passengers and crew were killed in what was the largest loss of life from a single shipwreck on the Great Lakes.\n\nAfter the disaster, \"Eastland\" was salvaged and sold to the United States Navy. After restorations and modifications, \"Eastland\" was designated a gunboat and renamed USS \"Wilmette\". She was used primarily as a training vessel on the Great Lakes, and was scrapped after World War II.\n\nThe ship was commissioned during 1902 by the Michigan Steamship Company and built by the Jenks Ship Building Company of Port Huron, Michigan. The ship was named during May 1903, immediately before its inaugural voyage.\n\nAfter her construction, \"Eastland\" was discovered to have design flaws, making her susceptible to listing. The ship was top-heavy, which became evident when passengers congregated en masse on the upper decks. During July 1903, a case of overcrowding caused \"Eastland\" to list, with water flowing up a gangplanks. The situation was quickly rectified, but this was the first of several incidents. Later in the same month, the stern of the ship was damaged when she was backed into the tugboat \"George W. Gardner\". During August 1906, another incident of listing occurred which resulted in the filing of complaints against the Chicago-South Haven Line which had purchased the ship earlier that year.\n\nOn August 14, 1903, while on a cruise from Chicago to South Haven, Michigan, six of the ship's firemen refused to stoke the fire for the ship's boiler. They claimed that they had not received their potatoes for a meal. When they refused to return to the fire hole, Captain John Pereue ordered the six men arrested at gunpoint. Firemen George Lippen and Benjamin Myers, who were not a part of the group of six, stoked the fires until the ship reached harbor. Upon the ship's arrival in South Haven, the six men – Glenn Watson, Mike Davern, Frank La Plarte, Edward Fleming, Mike Smith, and William Madden – were taken to the town jail and charged with mutiny. Shortly thereafter, Captain Pereue was replaced.\n\nOn July 24, 1915, \"Eastland\" and four other Great Lakes passenger steamers, \"Theodore Roosevelt\", \"Petoskey\", \"Racine\", and \"Rochester\", were chartered to take employees from Western Electric Company's Hawthorne Works in Cicero, Illinois, to a picnic in Michigan City, Indiana. This was a major event in the lives of the workers, many of whom could not take holidays. Many of the passengers on \"Eastland\" were Czech immigrants from Cicero; 220 of them perished.\n\nDuring 1915, the new federal Seamen's Act had been passed because of the RMS \"Titanic\" disaster three years earlier. The law required retrofitting of a complete set of lifeboats on \"Eastland\", as on many other passenger vessels. This additional weight may have made \"Eastland\" more dangerous by making it even more top-heavy. Some argued that other Great Lakes ships would suffer from the same problem. Nonetheless, it was signed into law by President Woodrow Wilson. \"Eastland\" was already so top-heavy that it had special restrictions concerning the number of passengers that could be carried. Prior to that, during June 1914, \"Eastland\" had again changed ownership, this time bought by the St. Joseph and Chicago Steamship Company, with Captain Harry Pedersen appointed the ship's master.\n\nOn the morning of July 24, passengers began boarding \"Eastland\" on the south bank of the Chicago River between Clark and LaSalle Streets about 6:30 am, and by 7:10 am, the ship had reached its capacity of 2,572 passengers. The ship was packed, with many passengers standing on the open upper decks, and began to list slightly to the port side (away from the wharf). The crew attempted to stabilize the ship by admitting water to its ballast tanks, but to little avail. Sometime during the next 15 minutes, a number of passengers rushed to the port side, and at 7:28 am, \"Eastland\" lurched sharply to port, and then rolled completely onto its port side, coming to rest on the river bottom, which was only below the surface. Many other passengers had already moved below decks on this relatively cool and damp morning to warm before the departure. Consequently, hundreds of people were trapped inside by the water and the sudden rollover; some were crushed by heavy furniture, including pianos, bookcases, and tables. Although the ship was only 20 feet (6.1 meters) from the wharf, and in spite of the quick response by the crew of a nearby vessel, \"Kenosha\", which came alongside the hull to allow those stranded on the capsized vessel to leap to safety, a total of 844 passengers and four crew members died in the disaster. In the aftermath, the Western Electric Company provided of the victims of the disaster.\n\nThe bodies of the victims were taken to various temporary morgues established in the area for identification; by afternoon, the remaining unidentified bodies were consolidated in the Armory of the 2nd Regiment, on the site which was later transformed into Harpo Studios, but has since been demolished to make room for a new McDonald's corporation headquarters.\n\nOne of the people who were scheduled to be on \"Eastland\" was 20-year-old George Halas, an American football player, who was delayed leaving for the dock, and arrived after the ship had overturned. His name was listed on the list of deceased in newspapers, but when fraternity brothers visited his home to send their condolences, he was revealed to be unharmed. Halas would go on to become coach and owner of the Chicago Bears and a founding member of the National Football League. His friend and future Bears executive Ralph Brizzolara and his brother were on the \"Eastland\" when it capsized, though they escaped through portholes. Despite stories to the contrary, no reliable evidence indicates Jack Benny was aboard \"Eastland\" or scheduled to be on the excursion; possibly the basis for this report was that \"Eastland\" was a training vessel during World War I and Benny received his training in the Great Lakes naval base, where \"Eastland\" was stationed.\n\nThe first known film footage taken of the recovery efforts was discovered and then released during early 2015 by a graduate student at the University of Illinois at Chicago.\n\nMarion Eichholz, the last known survivor of the capsizing, died on November 24, 2014, at the age of 102.\n\nWriter Jack Woodford witnessed the disaster and gave a first-hand account to the \"Herald and Examiner\", a Chicago newspaper. In his autobiography, Woodford writes:\n\nNewspapers played a significant part in not only publicizing the \"Eastland\" disaster, but also creating the public memory of the catastrophe. The newspapers’ purpose, audience, and political and business associations influenced the newspapers to publish articles emphasizing who was to blame and why \"Eastland\" capsized. Consequently, the articles influenced how the court cases proceeded, and contributed to a dispute between Western Electric Company and some of its workers regarding how the company responded to the catastrophe.\n\nCarl Sandburg, then known better as a journalist than a poet, wrote an angry account accusing regulators of ignoring safety issues and claimed that many of the workers were there on company orders for a staged picnic. Sandburg also wrote a poem, \"The \"Eastland\"\", that contrasts the disaster with the mistreatment and poor health of the lower classes at the time. After first listing the quick, murderous horrors of the disaster, then surveying the slow, murderous horrors of extreme poverty, Sandburg concludes by comparing the two: \"I see a dozen \"Eastlands\"/Every morning on my way to work/And a dozen more going home at night.\" The poem was too harsh for publication when written but was eventually released as part of a collection of poems during 1993.\n\nThe \"Eastland\" disaster was incorporated into the 1999 series premiere of the Disney Channel original series \"So Weird\". In the episode, teenaged paranormal enthusiast Fiona Phillips (actress Cara DeLizia) encounters the ghost of a young boy who drowned during the capsizing while exploring a nightclub near the Chicago River, and attempts to learn why he has contacted her.\n\nDuring 2012, Chicago's Lookingglass Theatre produced an original musical about the disaster entitled \"Eastland: A New Musical\" and written by Andy White. The Eastland disaster is also pivotal to the story of one family told in the play/musical \"Failure: A Love Story,\" written by Philip Dawkins, which premiered in Chicago in 2012. Its Los Angeles production, directed by Michael Matthews, and produced by Couerage Theater Company, premiered on July 24, 2015 – the 100th anniversary of the Eastland tragedy.\n\nA grand jury indicted the president and three other officers of the steamship company for manslaughter, and the ship's captain and engineer for criminal carelessness, and found that the disaster was caused by \"conditions of instability\" caused by any or all of overloading of passengers, mishandling of water ballast, or the construction of the ship.\n\nFederal extradition hearings were held to compel the six indicted men to come from Michigan to Illinois for trial. During the hearings, principal witness Sidney Jenks, president of the shipbuilding company that built \"Eastland\", testified that her first owners wanted a fast ship to transport fruit, and he designed one capable of making and carrying 500 passengers. Defense counsel Clarence Darrow asked whether he had ever worried about the conversion of the ship into a passenger steamer with a capacity of 2,500 or more passengers. Jenks replied, \"I had no way of knowing the quantity of its business after it left our yards... No, I did not worry about the \"Eastland\".\" Jenks testified that an actual stability test of the ship never occurred, and stated that after tilting to an angle of 45° at launching, \"it righted itself as straight as a church, satisfactorily demonstrating its stability.\"\n\nThe court refused extradition, holding the evidence was too weak, with \"barely a scintilla of proof\" to establish probable cause to find the six guilty. The court reasoned that the four company officers were not aboard the ship, and that every act charged against the captain and engineer was done in the ordinary course of business, \"more consistent with innocence than with guilt.\" The court also reasoned that \"Eastland\" \"was operated for years and carried thousands safely\", and that for this reason no one could say that the accused parties were unjustified in believing the ship seaworthy.\n\nAfter \"Eastland\" was raised on August 14, 1915, she was sold to the Illinois Naval Reserve and recommissioned as USS \"Wilmette\" stationed at Great Lakes Naval Base. She was converted to a gunboat, renamed \"Wilmette\" on February 20, 1918, and commissioned on September 20, 1918, with Captain William B. Wells in command. Commissioned late in World War I, \"Wilmette\" did not have any combat service. It trained sailors and experienced normal upkeep and repairs until placed in ordinary at Chicago on July 9, 1919, retaining a 10-man caretaker crew aboard. On June 29, 1920, the gunboat was returned to full commission, with Captain Edward A. Evers, United States Naval Reserve Forces (USNRF), in command.\n\nOn June 7, 1921, \"Wilmette\" was given the task of sinking \"UC-97\", a German U-boat surrendered to the United States after World War I. The guns of \"Wilmette\" were manned by Gunner's Mate J.O. Sabin, who had fired the first American cannon of World War I, and Gunner's Mate A.F. Anderson, the man who fired the first American torpedo of the conflict.\nFor the remainder of its 25-year career, the gunboat served as a training ship for naval reservists of the 9th, 10th, and 11th Naval Districts. It made voyages along the shores of the Great Lakes carrying trainees assigned to it from the Naval Station Great Lakes in Illinois. Ernie Pyle, the famed World War II correspondent was one of those trainees when he spent three weeks on the ship during late summer 1921. \"Wilmette\" remained in commission, performing its reserve training mission until it was placed \"out of commission, in service,\" on February 15, 1940.\n\nGiven hull designation IX-29 on February 17, 1941, she resumed training duty at Chicago on March 30, 1942, preparing armed guard crews for duty manning the guns on armed merchantmen. That assignment continued until the end of World War II in Europe obviated measures to protect trans-Atlantic merchant shipping from German U-boats.\n\nDuring August 1943, \"Wilmette\" was given the honor of transporting President Franklin D. Roosevelt, Admiral William D. Leahy, James F. Byrnes, and Harry Hopkins on a 10-day cruise to McGregor and Whitefish Bay to plan war strategies.\n\nOn April 9, 1945, it was returned to full commission for a brief interval. \"Wilmette\" was decommissioned on November 28, 1945, and her name was deleted from the Navy list on December 19, 1945. During 1946, \"Wilmette\" was offered for sale. Finding no takers, on October 31, 1946, she was sold to the Hyman Michaels Company for scrapping, which was completed during 1947.\n\nA marker commemorating the accident was dedicated on June 4, 1989. This marker was reported stolen on April 26, 2000, and a replacement marker was installed and rededicated on July 24, 2003.\n\nPlans exist for a permanent outdoor exhibit with the proposed name \"At The River's Edge\". This exhibit would be located along the portion of the Chicago Riverwalk adjacent to the waters where the Eastland disaster occurred. The exhibit is planned to consist of six displays each containing two unique panels which will serve to illustrate the tragedy through text and high-resolution images.\nOn Sunday, July 12, 2015, one hundred years after the SS Eastland disaster, a memorial to the departed was dedicated at Bohemian National Cemetery, 5255 N. Pulaski Road, Chicago.\n\n"}

{"id": "51504301", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=51504301", "title": "Teddy Together", "text": "Teddy Together\n\nTeddy Together is a life simulator video game developed by Arika for the Nintendo 3DS handheld video game console. The game is a localized version of a 2013 Japanese game called Kuma-Tomo. The game was released in Europe on July 1, 2016, and Australia and New Zealand on July 2. While the Japanese release was published by Bandai Namco Entertainment, under the Namco name, the English language release was published by Nintendo. The game is based around the player taking care of a teddy bear. The game was praised for being a good game for younger audiences, although some Western critics found the bear's overly-cheery appearance to be off-putting.\n\nThe game involves the player interacting with a sentient teddy bear, with the end-goal being to forge a trusting friendship with the bear in order to discover the purpose behind his existence and his mysterious key. Gameplay involves elements of \"Miitomo\", \"Nintendogs\", \"Animal Crossing\" and \"Cooking Mama\". The player uses the buttons, touch screen, and microphone to play mini-games that simulate various daily tasks such as cooking food or tending to a garden. Doing activities earn the player coins that can be use to purchase items or clothing for the teddy bear, and additional coins can be earned through the use of Nintendo-themed amiibo, the latter feature being exclusive the Western version of the game. The teddy bear also frequently asks the player questions about their self or their personal preferences, which is saved and mentioned back to the player in future parts of the game. The game has no online connectivity to the internet however, making the information given private to that particular copy of the video game.\n\nThe game was first released under the title of \"Kuma-Tomo\" in Japan in June 2013. The game was announced for English localization almost three years after its initial release, in May 2016, an irregularly long time for games to be released between regions in the industry. The game was released in Europe on July 1, 2016, and Australia and New Zealand on July 2. While the 2013 Japanese release had been published by Bandai Namco, the English language release was published by Nintendo. The game's Western release was given a focused advertisement campaign, especially on children's television channels in the UK.\n\nNintendo Life gave the game a score of 7/10, praising the game wealth of content for children to play with their parents, concluding that \"there is so much to be explored... A lot of kids' games can be rushed through, but the level of detail and effort put into \"Teddy Together\" makes it an solid choice for young gamers that enjoy the likes of \"Nintendogs\" and \"Tomodachi Life\". Multiple journalists, including ones at NintendoLife, Eurogamer, and Kotaku criticized the bear's overly cute look and voice acting to be inadvertently creepy and off-putting. Kotaku described his appearance as if Paddington Bear had been a character in the horror film \"The Grudge\".\n\nThe game sold 12,705 copies at retail in its first week of sales in June 2013, making it the fifth best-selling video of Japan for the week. \"Teddy Together\" has sold over 350,000 copies worldwide as of June 2018.\n"}
{"id": "404385", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=404385", "title": "USS Bonefish (SS-223)", "text": "USS Bonefish (SS-223)\n\nShe had a busy career in the Pacific against Japanese shipping after being launched and commissioned in May 1943. She was sunk in June 1945 after sinking a ship on its eighth cruise.\n\n\"Bonefish\"'s keel was laid down by the Electric Boat Company of Groton, Connecticut on 25 June 1942. She was launched 7 May 1943 (sponsored by Mrs. Elizabeth S. Daubin, wife of Rear Admiral Freeland A. Daubin), and commissioned on 31 May 1943, Lieutenant Commander Thomas W. Hogan (Class of 1931) in command.\n\nThe submarine conducted shakedown training out of New London, Conn., and Newport, R.I., until 23 July, when she set out for the Pacific. She transited the Panama Canal on 4 August and arrived at Brisbane, Australia, on the 30th. Following a week of training out of that port, she again got underway for more days of drills in Moreton Bay. The submarine departed there on 16 September for her first war patrol.\n\nAfter transiting Balabac Strait on 22 September, \"Bonefish\" continued on to her patrol area in the central part of the South China Sea. Three days later, the submarine attacked a convoy of eight ships, scoring three hits on a freighter before the escorts forced her to go deep to avoid a depth charge attack. \"Bonefish\" encountered another convoy on 27 September and launched four torpedoes at the lead ship, the largest of the five, and sank the 9,908 ton transport \"Kashima Maru\" and damaged the \"Chihaya Maru\". The escort ships pursued \"Bonefish\", but she was able to dive and elude her attackers. On 6 October, the boat approached a third convoy and scored hits on two heavily laden cargo vessels. Again forced to go deep to avoid the counterattack, she failed to evaluate the damage that her torpedoes had done to the targets. On 10 October, in her last action of the patrol, \"Bonefish\" fired a spread of four torpedoes at two ships of a convoy off Indochina, sending both the 4,212 ton cargo ship \"Isuzugawa\" and the 10,086 ton transport \"Teibi Maru\" to the bottom. On 14 October the \"Bonefish\" sank a Japanese sailing vessel in the Makassar Strait. \"Bonefish\" concluded her first war patrol back at Fremantle, Western Australia on 21 October.\n\nAfter refit and training, the submarine got underway on 22 November for the South China Sea and her second war patrol. She entered the Flores Sea on 28 November and, the next day, intercepted two enemy ships. \"Bonefish\" made a submerged approach and launched four torpedoes. Two of the four — one hit amidships and another struck the freighter under her mainmast — sent the 4,646 ton cargo ship \"Suez Maru\" down rapidly by the stern. The escort increased speed and headed for \"Bonefish\", but the sub went deep and escaped the barrage of depth charges. Unknown to \"Bonefish\", \"Suez Maru\" was carrying 414 British and 133 Dutch POWs. Minesweeper \"W.12\" picked up the Japanese survivors although recently released documents state that W.12 machine-gunned the surviving POWs (a minimum of 250) in the water,\n\nOn 1 December, the boat sighted a convoy of three ships with two escorts hugging the Celebes coast. In two separate attacks, the submarine scored a hit on a large passenger/cargo ship \"Nichiryo Maru\" which later sank and another on a destroyer escort which apparently survived.\n\n\"Bonefish\" conducted a submerged patrol of Sandakan Harbor, Borneo, from 4 – 6 December and then sailed for Tarakan. On 11 December, she surfaced to engage small cargo vessel \"Toyohime Maru \" with gunfire, scoring several hits before a mechanical problem put her gun out of action. The next day, the boat made a submerged approach on an unidentified Japanese vessel and fired six torpedoes, scoring one hit; \"Bonefish\" never learned the fate of her target. She cleared the area and arrived at Fremantle on 19 December.\n\nFollowing refit and training, the submarine sailed from Fremantle on 12 January 1944 to conduct her third war patrol. While operating in the vicinity of Makassar Strait on 22 January, \"Bonefish\" encountered a large sailing vessel. The stranger's crew of seven acted suspiciously as the submarine approached, and despite repeated orders to do so, the crew refused to abandon ship. When \"Bonefish\" opened fire with her machine guns, the natives leaped overboard. As the vessel began to sink, Japanese troops emerged from below decks; \"Bonefish\" counted 39 men going over the side.\n\nOn 6 February, the submarine sighted a convoy composed of at least 17 ships. As she maneuvered into attack position, \"Bonefish\" selected a large oiler as her primary target and launched four bow \"fish\" at it. She fired the other two bow tubes at a cargo ship and then tried to swing her stern into position to fire her after tubes. With escorts charging her, the boat suddenly lost depth control and ducked her periscope below the water. Nine tons of water rushed into her forward torpedo room before the proper valves were secured. \"Bonefish\" managed to evade the escorts, and her crew heard explosions which they interpreted as at least two hits on the oiler and one on the cargo ship. Nevertheless, it seems that neither target sank.\n\nThe submarine next trained her torpedo tubes on a convoy of 13 ships which she contacted on 9 February in Camranh Bay. Although detected by a Japanese destroyer, \"Bonefish\" succeeded in firing five torpedoes at the ex-whale-factory tanker \"Tonan Maru No. 2\" before making an emergency dive in shallow water. The submarine escaped damage from both the destroyer's depth charges and from aerial bombs which enemy aircraft dropped, but they prevented her from observing the results of her attack. (The \"Tonan Maru\" was hit but quickly repaired.) Following this action, she continued to seek targets for more than a month before returning to Fremantle on 15 March.\n\nUnderway again on 13 April, \"Bonefish\" headed for the Celebes Sea and her fourth war patrol. On 26 April, she intercepted a convoy of four ships steaming along the Mindanao coast. The submarine maneuvered into a position suitable to attack \"Tokiwa Maru\", launched four torpedoes, and then turned to evade the escorts. Two torpedoes struck the 806 ton passenger/cargo ship amidships and aft, sinking her. The next day, \"Bonefish\" fired a spread of four torpedoes at a cargo ship headed for Davao Gulf but, in spite of three hits, failed to sink the target.\n\nWhile in the Sulu Sea on 3 May, \"Bonefish\" approached a convoy but was forced to dive when an enemy plane dropped two depth bombs which exploded close aboard. The boat sustained minor damage and surfaced to make repairs, but two Japanese ships began to close in on her. \"Bonefish\" went deep once again and rigged for the depth charges, 25 in all. When her pursuers left the area, so did \"Bonefish\". She moved to the northern approach to Basilan Strait. She attacked a convoy in those waters on 7 May, firing four torpedoes at an escort vessel, but could not observe the results.\n\nOn 14 May, \"Bonefish\" approached a convoy of three tankers and three escorting destroyers, steaming off Tawitawi in the Philippines and headed for Sibutu Passage. The submarine fired five torpedoes. One hit under the bridge of a tanker and another struck under the stack, enveloping the ship in smoke and flames. The destroyers converged on \"Bonefish\" for counterattack, but she escaped into the depths. Postwar records show that, while her torpedoes only damaged the tanker, they sank one of the escorting destroyers, \"Inazuma\", which was known for having rescued 376 survivors from HMS Exeter and 151 from USS Pope during the Second Battle of the Java Sea.\n\n\"Bonefish\" then set course for Sibutu Passage on a reconnaissance mission. She sighted a Japanese task force consisting of three battleships, one aircraft carrier, three heavy cruisers, and one light cruiser, screened by eight destroyers. The submarine relayed the information, then continued her reconnaissance. She again sighted and reported the same task force on the 17th, this time anchored in Tawitawi Bay. Upon completing this mission, she headed for Australia and arrived at Fremantle on 30 May.\n\nUnder the command of Lt. Cmdr. Lawrence L. Edge, the submarine began her fifth war patrol on 25 June and headed again for the Celebes Sea. On 6 July, she surfaced to destroy a wooden-hulled schooner by gunfire. She then cleared the area and, the next day, engaged and destroyed another small ship with gunfire. Later that same day, the boat fired eight torpedoes at a small cargo ship, scoring several hits. On 8 July, she used her guns to touch off a blazing fire in a small, inter-island steamer and, two days later, sank a sampan with gunfire.\n\nOn 29 July, \"Bonefish\" commenced tracking a large, but empty, tanker with escorts and, early the next morning, gained a favorable attack position. She fired six torpedoes and scored four hits. The target, \"Kokuyo Maru\", immediately settled by the stern, and \"Bonefish\" headed for the traffic lanes north of Sibutu and Tawitawi. On 3 August, she damaged a tanker with one torpedo hit. She set course for Fremantle the next day, ending her patrol there on 13 August.\n\nWith her crew refreshed and her provisions and ammunition replenished, \"Bonefish\" got underway on 5 September for the Sibuyan Sea. After three days there without encountering any enemy ships, she departed those waters on 24 September. Four days later, while patrolling off Mindoro, the submarine sighted a large, heavily laden tanker escorted by two destroyers. She fired all of her bow torpedoes and heard and felt the hits on the 2,068 ton Japanese ship \"Anjo Maru\". \"Bonefish\" tracked the target whose rapidly falling speed indicated her distress until the crippled tanker's escorts forced the boat to retire. A postwar examination of Japanese records confirmed that \"Anio Maru\" sank later that day.\n\nDuring the later part of this patrol, \"Bonefish\" joined and in forming a coordinated attack group. Patrolling in the vicinity of Cape Bolinao on 10 October, the boats attacked a convoy of cargo ships, and \"Bonefish\" scored three hits for undetermined damage. Four days later, while en route to a lifeguard station, she sank cargo ship \"Fushimi Maru\". On 18 October, the submarine rescued two naval aviators. She departed her lifeguard station the next day, stopped at Saipan for fuel on the 27th, and continued on to Pearl Harbor, where she arrived on 8 November.\n\nFrom Hawaii, \"Bonefish\" continued on to San Francisco, California, where she underwent overhaul at the Bethlehem Steel Submarine Repair Basin from 18 November 1944 to 13 February 1945. Then, after refresher training off Monterey, Calif., she returned to Pearl Harbor where she conducted exercises until 20 March.\n\n\"Bonefish\" then set sail via Guam for the East China Sea and her seventh war patrol. Despite thorough coverage of the waters assigned her, she made few contacts and each of these was a small antisubmarine vessel. On Friday, 13 April, she attempted to sink a patrol vessel, but the target's radical maneuvers enabled it to escape. While on lifeguard duty off Korea's southern coast on 16 April, \"Bonefish\" rescued two Japanese aviators who had been shot down by a Navy plane. The USS Bonefish then completed a \"special mission\". On 7 May, the submarine returned to Apra Harbor, Guam, ending another successful war patrol.\n\nUpon completion of refit on 28 May, \"Bonefish\" got underway in company with and , as part of \"Pierce's Pole Cats\", commanded by \"Tunny\"'s skipper, Commander George E. Pierce. Equipped with a new mine-detecting device, the submarines were ordered to penetrate the Sea of Japan to sever the last of the Japanese overseas supply lines. \"Bonefish\" successfully threaded her way through the minefields by Tsushima Island as she transited the Korea Strait to enter the Sea of Japan for an offensive patrol off the west central coast of Honshū.\n\nDuring a rendezvous with \"Tunny\" on 16 June, \"Bonefish\" reported sinking \"Oshikayama Maru\", a 6,892 ton cargo ship. In a second rendezvous two days later, she requested and received permission to conduct a daylight submerged patrol of Toyama Bay, a bay farther up the Honshū coast. The attack group was to depart the Sea of Japan via La Perouse Strait on the night of 24 June. \"Bonefish\" did not make the scheduled pre-transit rendezvous. Still, \"Tunny\" waited in vain off Hokkaidō for three days. On 30 July, \"Bonefish\" was presumed lost.\n\nJapanese records reveal that the 5,488 ton cargo ship \"Konzan Maru\" was torpedoed and sunk in Toyama Wan on 19 June and that an ensuing severe counterattack by Japanese escorts, the \"Okinawa\", \"CD-63\", \"CD-75\", \"CD-158\" and \"CD-207\", brought debris and a major oil slick to the water's surface. There can be little doubt that \"Bonefish\" was sunk in this action. She was the second to last United States Submarine lost in the war, with being lost in August 1945.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2851792", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2851792", "title": "USS Jarvis (DD-393)", "text": "USS Jarvis (DD-393)\n\nUSS \"Jarvis\" (DD-393), a , was the second ship of the United States Navy to be named for James C. Jarvis, a U.S. Navy midshipman who was killed at the age of 13 during the Quasi-War with France. She saw service in the Pacific in the early months of World War II, and participated in the invasion of Guadalcanal. The destroyer was sunk to the south of Guadalcanal on 9 August 1942, with all hands - one of only two American major surface warships to be lost in World War II with no survivors.\n\nThe second \"Jarvis\" (DD-393) was laid down by Puget Sound Navy Yard, Bremerton, Washington on 21 August 1935. The vessel was launched on 6 May 1937; sponsored by Mrs Thomas T. Craven, wife of Vice Admiral Craven. \"Jarvis\" was commissioned on 27 October 1937, Lieutenant Commander R. R. Ferguson in command.\n\nClearing Puget Sound on 4 January 1938, \"Jarvis\" operated along the California coast and in the Caribbean Sea until 1 April 1940 when she departed San Diego for fleet exercises off the Hawaiian Islands. She arrived at Pearl Harbor on 26 April, cruised in the Pacific to Midway and Johnston Islands, and steamed to San Francisco, arriving on 8 February 1941 for overhaul. Returning to Pearl Harbor on 17 April to commence more than seven months of intensive maneuvers as part of Destroyer Division Eight (DesDiv 8) of Destroyer Squadron Four, she put into Pearl Harbor on 4 December following exercises off Maui Island.\n\nThree days later the Japanese executed the carefully planned, devastating attack on Pearl Harbor. Moored next to in berth B6 of the Navy yard for minor repairs, \"Jarvis\" opened fire with 5-inch guns and machine guns and made preparations to get underway. Within minutes of the initial attack, her 5-inch guns were among the first to challenge the enemy raiders, and her gunners claimed four planes. As the first wave of enemy bombers raked Battleship Row with torpedoes and bombs, Ensign W. F. Greene appraised the situation with the following entry in \"Jarvis\" Deck Log: \"0758 Hostilities with Japan commenced with air raid on Pearl Harbor. Went to General Quarters.\" Emerging from the attack with no loss of crew and only superficial damage, \"Jarvis\" sortied that morning with several cruisers and destroyers to conduct surveillance and anti-submarine warfare (ASW) patrols.\n\nOn 16 December she cleared Pearl Harbor with the aircraft carrier and joined Task Force 14, steaming to relieve the beleaguered defenders on Wake Atoll. The task forces was recalled to Pearl Harbor on 23 December after the rescue mission was aborted. \"Jarvis\" returned to Pearl Harbor on 29 December to resume ASW patrols. While operating with the carrier and her screening cruisers, \"Jarvis\" rescued 182 survivors of the stricken fleet oiler six hours after she was torpedoed during mid-watch on 23 January 1942.\n\n\"Jarvis\" departed Pearl Harbor on 5 February to escort a convoy to Brisbane, Australia. Following her return on 27 March, the destroyer sailed on 8 April for San Francisco to undergo alterations with the other ships of DesRon Four. She returned to Pearl Harbor on 18 May escorting 13 ships and proceeded five days later via Fiji to Sydney, Australia. Arriving on 18 June, \"Jarvis\" commenced convoy escort and ASW patrols from Australia to New Caledonia, continuing this duty until called to participate in the invasion of Guadalcanal.\n\nSteaming from Sydney on 14 July, \"Jarvis\" arrived in Wellington, New Zealand, on 19 July to join Task Force 62. The task force sailed on 22 July for the Solomons. After conducting rehearsal landings in the Fiji Islands from 28 to 30 July, the invasion force of 84 ships and 20,000 Marines steamed for Guadalcanal on 31 July. Protected from Japanese search planes by rain and heavy mists, the force arrived off the landing beaches at dawn on 7 August.\n\nFollowing naval and air bombardment of enemy defenses, the first amphibious operation of the war commenced at 0650. \"Jarvis\" patrolled as part of the protective screen while Marines established a beachhead. As landing operations progressed, the Americans expected the Japanese to strike vigorously at the transports with land-based planes. However, during two attacks which occurred that afternoon the Americans sustained only minor damage on \"Mugford\" while destroying 14 enemy planes.\n\nFollowing a night patrol off the southern end of Savo Island, \"Jarvis\" returned to Lunga Point to screen the unloading transports. The warning of an impending air attack suspended these operations and the transports and their protective screen of destroyers and cruisers deployed in the body of water between Guadalcanal and Florida Island, soon to be called \"Ironbottom Sound\". When enemy torpedo bombers appeared around noon on 8 August, they met a stream of antiaircraft fire. Only 9 of the 26 planes penetrated the defensive fire, but they set the attack transport ablaze and torpedoed \"Jarvis\".\n\nWith 5-inch shells and machine gun fire pouring out at the attackers, \"Jarvis\" maneuvered between the heavy cruiser and one of the planes during the thick of the fight. As anti-aircraft fire consumed the plane, its torpedo exploded against \"Jarvis\" starboard side near the forward fireroom, stopping her dead in the water and killing 14 crewmen. Her crew jettisoned the port torpedoes and quickly brought under control the fires that followed the explosion. The destroyer towed her to shallow anchorage off Lunga Point; and, after the attack, she crossed \"Ironbottom Sound\" to Tulagi, where she transferred her seven wounded and commenced emergency repairs.\n\nDespite a gash in her side, she was considered seaworthy and ordered to proceed under cover of darkness to Efate, New Hebrides, escorted by the minesweeper \"Hovey\". Apparently unaware of the order because her radios had been disabled, her commanding officer, Lt. Comdr. William W. Graham Jr., decided to steam to Sydney, Australia, for immediate repairs from the destroyer tender . Unnoticed by her own ships, \"Jarvis\" departed Tulagi at midnight on 9 August and moved slowly westward through \"Ironbottom Sound\" and between Savo Island and Cape Esperance. At 0134 she passed northward of Rear Admiral Mikawa's cruisers, steaming to meet the Americans at the Battle of Savo Island. Mistaking her for a cruiser of the New Zealand \"Achilles\" class, they fired torpedoes, and the destroyer later engaged her briefly, all without effect.\n\nThe destroyer, continuing to retire westward, had little speed, no radio communications, and few operative guns; but she refused aid from the destroyer upon being sighted at 0325. After daybreak a \"Saratoga\"-based scout plane sighted her 40 miles off Guadalcanal, trailing fuel oil and down by the bow. That was the last time Americans saw her.\n\nHowever, the Japanese, still mistaking \"Jarvis\" for an escaping cruiser, dispatched 31 planes from Rabaul to search out and destroy her. Once discovered the badly damaged destroyer was no match for bombers raking the ship with bullets and torpedoes. According to Japanese records, \"Jarvis\" \"split and sank\" at 1300 on 9 August. None of her 233 remaining crew survived the onslaught.\n\n\"Jarvis\" received three battle stars for World War II service.\n\n\n"}

The software performs 3D, 4D and 5D rendering and analysis of very large image data sets, especially those generated using various modern microscopy methods, and associated 3D surface objects. This software has been used in several large neuroscience initiatives and a number of applications in other domains. In a recent \"Nature Methods\" review article, it has been viewed as one of the leading open Source software suites in the related research fields. In addition, research using this software was awarded the 2012 Cozzarelli Prize from the National Academy of Science.\n\nVaa3D was created in 2007 to tackle the large-scale brain mapping project at Janelia Farm of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute. The initial goal was to quickly visualize any of the tens of thousands of large 3D laser scanning microscopy image stacks of fruit fly brains, each with a few gigabytes in volume. Low level OpenGL-based 3D rendering was developed to provide direct rendering of multi-dimensional image stacks. C/C++ and Qt were used to create cross-platform compatibility so the software can run on Mac, Linux and Windows. Strong functions for synchronizing multiple 2D/3D/4D/5D rendered views, generating global and local 3D viewers, and virtual finger, allow Vaa3D be able to streamline a number of operations for complicated brain science tasks, for example, brain comparison and neuron reconstruction. Vaa3D also provides an extensible plugin interface that currently hosts dozens of open source plugins contributed by researchers worldwide.\n\nVaa3D is able to render 3D, 4D, and 5D data (X,Y,Z,Color,Time) quickly. The volume rendering is typically at the scale of a few gigabytes and can be extended to the scale of terabytes per image set. The visualization is made fast by using OpenGL directly.\n\nVaa3D handles the problem of large data visualization via several techniques. One way is to combine both the synchronized and asynchronized data rendering, which displays the full resolution data only when the rotation or other dynamic display of the data is paused, and otherwise displays only a coarse level image.\n\nAn alternative method used in Vaa3D is to combine both global and local 3D viewers. The global 3D viewer optionally displays only the downsampled image while the local 3D viewer displays full resolution image but only at certain local areas. Intuitive 3D navigation is done by determining a 3D region of interest using the Virtual Finger technique followed by generating in real-time a specific 3D local viewer for such a region of interest.\n\n3D visualization of an image stack is essentially a passive process to observe the data. The combination of an active way to input a user's preference of specific locations quickly greatly increase the efficiency of exploration of the 3D or higher-dimensional image contents. Nonetheless, ‘exploring 3D image content’ requires that a user is able to efficiently interact with and quantitatively profile the patterns of image objects using a graphical user interface of 3D image-visualization tools. Virtual Finger, or 3D-WYSIWYG ('What You See in 2D is What You Get in 3D') technique allows efficient generation and use of the 3D location information from 2D input of a user on the typical 2D display or touch devices.\n\nThe Virtual Finger technique maps the identified 2D user input via 2D display devices, such as a computer screen, back to the 3D volumetric space of the image. Mathematically, this is an often difficult inverse problem. However, by utilizing the spatial sparseness and continuity information in many 3D image data sets, this inverse problem can be well solved, as shown in a recent paper.\n\nThe Vaa3D's Virtual Finger technology allows instant and random-order exploration of complex 3D image content, similar to using real fingers explore the real 3D world using a single click or stroke to locate 3D objects. It has been used to boost the performance of image data acquisition, visualization, management, annotation, analysis and the use of the image data for real-time experiments such as microsurgery.\n\nVaa3D displays three major types of 3D surface objects:\n\nThese 3D surface objects are also often arranged as \"sets\". Vaa3D can display multiple sets of any of these surface objects, which can also be overlaid on top of image voxel data using different overlaying relationships. These features are useful for colocalization, quantification, comparison, and other purposes.\n\nThe software has been used in a number of applications such as the following examples.\nVaa3D provides a Vaa3D-Neuron package to reconstruct, quantify, and compare 3D morphology of single neurons of a number of species.\n\nVaa3D-Neuron allows several ways of neuron tracing.\n\n\nVaa3D was used to extract single cells from several studies of the nematode \"C. elegans\", the insect fruitfly, mouse, and other species. The primary functions used were 3D image segmentation for extracting and quantifying single cells' gene expression levels, and fast cell counting in specific brain areas. Vaa3D also provides methods to annotate these cells and identify their names.\n\nVaa3D also provides a SRS (Simultaneous Segmentation and Recognition) algorithm for 3D segmentation of complicated cells, which are often touching each other. This was done by adaptively mapping an predefined \"atlas\" (layout map of some cells) to an image iteratively using the Expectation Maximization algorithm until convergence. SRS has been shown to reduce over-segmentation and under-segmentation errors compared to usually used watershed segmentation method.\n\nVaa3D has been used in several brain mapping projects, in terms of both pattern alignment (registration) and multiplexing based analysis.\n\n\nVaa3D can be extended using a plugin interface. A wizard called \"Plugin Creator\" is provided to generate a basic template of a new plugin.\n\nThe following main categories of plugins are currently released.\n\n\nVaa3D has also been extended to support ITK, Matlab, Bioformats, OpenCV and other widely used software. One extension, called Vaa3D-TeraFly, is to visualize terabytes of image data using a Google-Earth style dive-in view of data.\n\n"}
{"id": "420944", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=420944", "title": "Vampire squid", "text": "Vampire squid\n\nThe vampire squid (\"Vampyroteuthis infernalis\", lit. \"vampire squid from Hell\") is a small cephalopod found throughout temperate and tropical oceans in extreme deep sea conditions. Unique retractile sensory filaments justify the vampire squid's placement in its own order, Vampyromorphida, as it shares similarities with both octopuses and squid. As a phylogenetic relict, it is the only known surviving member of its order. The first specimens were collected on the Valdivia Expedition and they were originally described as an octopus in 1903 by German teuthologist Carl Chun, but later assigned to a new order together with several extinct taxa.\n\nThe vampire squid can reach a maximum total length around . Its 15-cm (6-in) gelatinous body varies in colour from velvety jet-black to pale reddish, depending on location and lighting conditions. A webbing of skin connects its eight arms, each lined with rows of fleshy spines or cirri; the inner side of this \"cloak\" is black. Only the distal halves (farthest from the body) of the arms have suckers. Its limpid, globular eyes, which appear red or blue, depending on lighting, are proportionately the largest in the animal kingdom at in diameter. The name of the animal was inspired by its dark colour, cloak-like webbing, and red eyes, rather than habit—it feeds on detritus, not blood.\n\nMature adults have a pair of small fins projecting from the lateral sides of the mantle. These fins serve as the adult's primary means of propulsion: vampire squid move through the water by flapping their fins. Their beak-like jaws are white. Within the webbing are two pouches wherein the tactile velar filaments are concealed. The filaments are analogous to a true squid's tentacles, extending well past the arms; but differ in origin, and represent the pair that was lost by the ancestral octopus.\n\nThe vampire squid is almost entirely covered in light-producing organs called photophores, capable of producing disorienting flashes of light ranging in duration from fractions of a second to several minutes. The intensity and size of the photophores can also be modulated. Appearing as small, white discs, the photophores are larger and more complex at the tips of the arms and at the base of the two fins, but are absent from the undersides of the caped arms. Two larger, white areas on top of the head were initially believed to also be photophores, but are now identified as photoreceptors.\n\nThe chromatophores (pigment organs) common to most cephalopods are poorly developed in the vampire squid. Although the animal is, therefore, incapable of changing its skin colour in the dramatic fashion of shallow-dwelling cephalopods, such ability would not be useful at the lightless depths where it lives.\n\nThe vampire squid is an extreme example of a deep sea cephalopod, thought to reside at aphotic (lightless) depths from or more. Within this region of the world's oceans is a discrete habitat known as the oxygen minimum zone. Within the zone, the saturation of oxygen is too low to support aerobic metabolism in most complex organisms. Nonetheless, the vampire squid is able to live and breathe normally in the minimum zone at oxygen saturations as low as 3%, an ability that few other animals possess.\n\nTo cope with life in the suffocating depths, vampire squids have developed several interesting adaptations. Of all deep-sea cephalopods, their mass-specific metabolic rate is the lowest. Their blue blood's hemocyanin binds and transports oxygen more efficiently than in other cephalopods, aided by gills with an especially large surface area. The animals have weak musculature, but maintain agility and buoyancy with little effort because of sophisticated statocysts (balancing organs akin to a human's inner ear) and ammonium-rich gelatinous tissues closely matching the density of the surrounding seawater.\n\nLike many deep-sea cephalopods, the vampire squid lacks ink sacs. If disturbed, it will curl its arms up outwards and wrap them around its body, turning itself inside-out in a way, exposing spiny projections. If highly agitated, it may eject a sticky cloud of bioluminescent mucus containing innumerable orbs of blue light from the arm tips. This luminous barrage, which may last nearly 10 minutes, would presumably serve to daze would-be predators and allow the vampire squid to disappear into the blackness without the need to swim far. The display is made only if the animal is very agitated because regenerating the mucus is metabolically costly.\n\nFew specifics are known regarding the ontogeny of the vampire squid. Their development progresses through three morphologic forms: the very young animals have a single pair of fins, an intermediate form has two pairs, and the mature form again has one. At their earliest and intermediate phases of development, a pair of fins is located near the eyes; as the animal develops, this pair gradually disappears as the other pair develops. As the animals grow and their surface area to volume ratio drops, the fins are resized and repositioned to maximize gait efficiency. Whereas the young propel themselves primarily by jet propulsion, mature adults find flapping their fins to be the most efficient means. This unique ontogeny caused confusion in the past, with the varying forms identified as several species in distinct families.\n\nIf hypotheses may be drawn from knowledge of other deep-sea cephalopods, the vampire squid likely reproduces slowly by way of a small number of large eggs. Growth is slow, as nutrients are not abundant at depths frequented by the animals. The vastness of their habitat and its sparse population make procreative encounters a fortuitous event. The female may store a male's hydraulically implanted spermatophore (a tapered, cylindrical satchel of sperm) for long periods before she is ready to fertilize her eggs. Once she does, she may need to brood over them for up to 400 days before they hatch. Their reproductive strategy appears to be of the iteroparous type, which is an exception amongst the otherwise semelparous Coleoidea.\n\nHatchlings are about 8 mm in length and are well-developed miniatures of the adults, with some differences. Their arms lack webbing, their eyes are smaller, and their velar filaments are not fully formed. The hatchlings are transparent and survive on a generous internal yolk for an unknown period before they begin to actively feed. The smaller animals frequent much deeper waters, perhaps feeding on marine snow (falling organic detritus).\n\nWhat behavioural data are known have been gleaned from ephemeral encounters with ROVs; animals are often injured during capture, and survive up to two months in aquaria. An artificial environment makes reliable observation of non-defensive behaviour difficult. In May 2014, Monterey Bay Aquarium (California, United States) became the first to ever put this species on display.\n\nWith their long velar filaments deployed, vampire squids have been observed drifting along in the deep, black ocean currents. If the filaments contact an entity, or if vibrations impinge upon them, the animals investigate with rapid acrobatic movements. They are capable of swimming at speeds equivalent to two body lengths per second, with an acceleration time of five seconds. However, their weak muscles limit stamina considerably.\n\nUnlike their relatives living in more hospitable climates, deep-sea cephalopods cannot afford to expend energy in protracted flight. Given their low metabolic rate and the low density of prey at such depths, vampire squids must use innovative predator avoidance tactics to conserve energy. Their aforementioned bioluminescent \"fireworks\" are combined with the writhing of glowing arms, erratic movements, and escape trajectories, making it difficult for a predator to identify a single target.\n\nIn a threat response called \"pumpkin\" or \"pineapple\" posture, the vampire squid inverts its caped arms back over the body, presenting an ostensibly larger form covered in fearsome-looking though harmless spines (called cirri). The underside of the cape is heavily pigmented, masking most of the body's photophores. The glowing arm tips are clustered together far above the animal's head, diverting attack away from critical areas. If a predator were to bite off an arm tip, the vampire squid can regenerate it.\n\nThey have eight arms but lack feeding tentacles, and instead use two retractile filaments in order to capture food. They combine the waste with mucus secreted from suckers to form balls of food. They feed on detritus, including the remains of gelatinous zooplankton (such as salps, larvaceans, and medusae jellies) and complete copepods, ostracods, amphipods, and isopods.\n\nVampire squids have been found among the stomach contents of large, deepwater fish, including giant grenadiers, and deep-diving mammals, such as whales and sea lions.\n\nThe Vampyromorphida are characterized by derived characters such as the possession of photophores and of two velar filaments which are most probably modified arms. It also shares the inclusion of an internal gladius with other coleoids, including squid, and eight webbed arms with cirrate octopods.\n\n\"Vampyroteuthis\" shares its eight cirrate arms with the Cirrata, in which lateral cirri, or filaments, alternate with the suckers. \"Vampyroteuthis\" differs in that suckers are present only on the distal half of the arms while cirri run the entire length. In cirrate octopods suckers and cirri run, alternating, the entire length. Also, a close relationship between \"Vampyroteuthis\" and the Jurassic-Cretaceous Loligosepiina is indicated by the similarity of their gladiuses, the internal stiffening structure. However, the inclusion of \"Vampyronassa rhodanica\" from the middle Jurassic La Voulte-sur-Rhône of France as a vampyroteuthid turns out to be rather doubtful.\n\nThe supposed vampyromorphids from the Kimmeridgian-Tithonian (156–146 mya) of Solnhofen, \"Plesioteuthis prisca\", \"Leptoteuthis gigas\", and \"Trachyteuthis hastiformis\", cannot be positively assigned to this group; they are large species (from 35 cm in \"P. prisca\" to > 1 m in \"L. gigas\") and show features not found in vampyromorphids, being somewhat similar to the true squids, Teuthida.\n\n\n\n"}

Characterized by underlying anger and hostility, it is a destructive form of communication intended to harm the self-concept of the other person and produce negative emotions. Verbal abuse is a maladaptive mechanism that anyone can display occasionally, such as during times of high stress or physical discomfort. For some people, it is a pattern of behaviors used intentionally to control or manipulate others or to get revenge.\n\nIn schools and in everyday life, a person may engage in verbal abuse—bullying (which often has a physical component)—to gain status as superior to the person targeted and to bond with others against the target. Generally, the bully knows no other way to connect emotionally with others.\n\nIn romantic relationships, the verbal abuser may be responding to the partner's \"separateness\", i.e., independent thoughts, views, desires, feelings, expressions (even of happiness) which the abuser views as a threat, irritant or attack. Some people believe the abuser has low self-esteem and then so, attempts to place their victim in a similar position, i.e., to believe negative things about themselves.\n\nBecause of the abuser's need for dominance and unwillingness to accept their partner as an equal, the verbal abuser is compelled to negate the perceptions of the partner, about the abuse, which causes more psychological pain to the victim. This is also known as gas-lighting or Jekyll and Hyde-like behavior, because the abuser keeps the target of abuse off-balance with their hot-and-cold unpredictable behavior. This confusion adds to the pain caused by psychological abuse and keeps the victim off-balance.\n\nAnyone can experience verbal abuse. Typically, in romantic or family relationships, verbal abuse increases in intensity and frequency over time. After exposure to verbal abuse, victims may develop clinical depression or post-traumatic stress disorder. The person targeted by verbal abuse over time may succumb to any stress-related illness. Verbal abuse creates emotional pain and mental anguish in its target.\n\nDespite the fact that verbal abuse does not leave bruising, verbal abuse can be as detrimental to a person's health as physical abuse.\n\nVerbal abuse includes the following:\n\n"}

According to the book \"\", in 1904 alone, four players were killed during hockey games from the frequent brawls and violent stickwork.\n\nMore modern examples of violence include brawls, fan involvement, physical abuse of officials and deliberately injuring opponents. Violent actions such as kicking, hitting from behind and prohibited stickwork, are penalized with suspensions or fines. Fighting, or fisticuffs, is also penalized but is considered by many hockey enthusiasts, particularly in North America, to be quite distinct from stick-swinging or other violent acts. They regard fighting as an entrenched, acceptable and integral part of the game.\n\nOn the ice, referees may impose penalties for prohibited activities. Off the ice, the National Hockey League (NHL) sometimes fines, suspends or expels players. The criminal justice system has also been known to investigate, charge and convict players. As a result, hockey has become much more regulated and the violent element much more controlled. This has been aided, in no small part, by dramatic increases in disciplinary processes and technology allowing for a high level of scrutiny of any event which occurs.\n\nEarly hockey in particular was noted for its extreme violence, to the point where two players were killed in three years during brawls. In both cases, the accused assailants were acquitted, but these and other bloody incidents led to calls for the sport to clean up its act or be banned along with the likes of cockfighting. The worst of the violence waned, particularly with the advent of regulations for quasi-legal fisticuffs, though incidents continue to occur from time to time.\n\nBilly Coutu was the first, and to date only, player banned from the NHL for life for violence in 1927; he assaulted referee Jerry Laflamme and tackled referee Billy Bell before starting a bench-clearing brawl during a Stanley Cup game between the Boston Bruins and Ottawa Senators, apparently on the orders of Bruins Head Coach Art Ross. The NHL's first president, Frank Calder, expelled Coutu from the NHL for life; the ban was lifted after two-and-a-half years, but Coutu never played in the NHL again.\n\nOther incidents include the December 12, 1933, event when Eddie Shore rammed Toronto Maple Leafs star Ace Bailey from behind, causing Bailey to strike his head on the ice; Bailey never played hockey again. More recently, controversy and criminal charges have resulted from violent attacks by Marty McSorley, Todd Bertuzzi and Chris Simon.\n\nPlayers who are banned in the American Hockey League (AHL) for violence are not permitted in the ECHL, and vice versa, because of their agreements with the Professional Hockey Players' Association.\n\nIn January 2012, David Johnston, the Governor General of Canada, said that violence such as headshots, high-sticking and fighting should not be part of the sport.\n\nThere have been two major Canadian reports on violence in hockey. In 1974, William McMurtry provided a report for the Government of Ontario entitled \"Investigation and Inquiry into Violence in Amateur Hockey\". In 2000, Bernie Pascall prepared a report for the Government of British Columbia entitled \"Eliminating Violence in Hockey\".\n\n\n\nAll of these incidents are in the NHL of the United States and Canada, unless noted otherwise.\n\n"}

He was named after Mary's brother-in-law Dr. William Wallace.\n\nWillie and his younger brother Tad were considered \"notorious hellions\" when they lived in Springfield. They were recorded by Abraham's law partner William Herndon for turning their law office upside down: pulling the books off the shelves while their father appeared oblivious to their behavior.\n\nUpon their father's election as President, Willie and Tad moved into the White House and it became their new playground. At the request of Mrs. Lincoln, Julia Taft brought her younger brothers, 14-year-old \"Bud\" (Horatio Nelson Taft Jr., 1847-1915) and 12-year-old \"Holly\" (Halsey Cook Taft, 1849-1897) to the White House and they became playmates of Willie and Tad.\n\nWillie and Tad became ill in early 1862. While Tad was not as badly affected, Willie's condition fluctuated from day to day. The most likely cause of the illness was typhoid fever, which was usually contracted by consumption of contaminated food/water. The White House drew its water from the Potomac River, alongside which thousands of soldiers and horses were camped. Gradually Willie weakened, and his parents spent much time at his bedside. Finally, on Thursday, February 20, 1862, at 5:00 p.m., Willie died. Abraham said, \"My poor boy. He was too good for this earth. God has called him home. I know that he is much better off in heaven, but then we loved him so much. It is hard, hard to have him die!\"\n\nBoth parents were deeply affected. Long after the burial, the President repeatedly shut himself in a room so that he could weep alone. He cared for Willie's younger brother, Tad, who was still very ill and was heartbroken over the loss of his brother. Mary Lincoln's grief over Willie's death was even more devastating than her husband's. She took to her bed for three weeks, so desolated that she could not attend the funeral or look after Tad. Mary was so distraught for many months that Lincoln had to employ a nurse to look after her. \n\nWillie was interred at Oak Hill Cemetery in Georgetown. After his father's assassination in 1865, Willie's casket was moved from the Carroll Mausoleum. He was re-interred at Oak Ridge Cemetery in Springfield, Illinois, first in a temporary tomb and on September 19, 1871, a state tomb alongside the remains of his father and his brother Eddie. Tad and Mary Todd Lincoln were also later placed in the crypt of the Lincoln Tomb.\n\nWillie is featured in the 2017 novel \"Lincoln in the Bardo\" by American writer George Saunders. The novel takes place during and after Willie's death and deals with the president's grief at his loss. The bulk of the novel is set in the bardo, an intermediate space between life and rebirth, and takes place over the course of a single evening. \"Lincoln in the Bardo\" received critical acclaim, which included winning the 2017 Man Booker Prize. The novel was also the \"New York Times\" bestseller the week of March 5, 2017.\n\n\n"}
