They are designed to reduce or diminish the effects of aging. Many products seek to hide the effects of aging while others claim to alter the body's chemical balances to slow the physical effects of aging. A comprehensive grading scale for anti-aging of the skin has been validated and categorizes skin aging as: laxity (sagging), rhytids (wrinkles), and the various categories of photoaging, including erythema (redness), dyspigmentation (brown discolorations), solar elastosis (yellowing), keratoses (abnormal growths), and poor texture.\n\nDespite great demand, many such products and treatments have not been proven to give lasting or major positive effects. One study found that the best performing creams reduced wrinkles by less than 10% over 12 weeks which is not noticeable to the human eye. Another study found that cheap moisturizers were as effective as high-priced anti-wrinkle creams. One published study, funded by Boots, found that one of Boots' products reduced wrinkles.\n\nTraditionally, anti-aging creams have been marketed towards women, but products specifically targeting men are increasingly common.\n\nThe belief in the benefits of anti-aging creams, along with their use, should be met with skepticism. Nearly every brand and type delivers information about the product being “scientifically tested” or “scientifically proven” however, the results of these studies are rarely made available to consumers. This suggests that the legitimacy of these studies and subsequent results are highly questionable.\n\nAging is a natural process which is accompanied by normal physical, chemical, and biological changes in the body. These changes include facial and body wrinkling of the skin and this process is common to all human beings. To believe so easily that a cream could prevent and/or reduce the process of skin aging all on its own does not fit with how the world really works. If this problem had such a simple solution, individuals (including our ancestors) would likely have perfect complexions free of age-related problems. Similarly, if the solution to anti-aging was so easy for us to attain, there would be no need for hundreds or thousands of products on the commercial market which provide similar claims yet produce products with differing ingredients.\n\nTheoretically, cosmetics promise to alter or “enhance” function, however they do not change any cellular or biochemical reactions or processes within the skin. Secondly, these products and chemicals are unregulated by any governing body, thus allowing potentially dangerous or harmful ingredients to be added with the promise of results. Before blindly accepting that certain chemicals cause anti-aging results, it is necessary to do research to determine the safety of these products.\n\nAs well as more conventional moisturizing ingredients, anti-aging creams usually contain anti-aging ingredients such as:\n\n\nThe effects of these ingredients depend on their concentration and mode of application. Many skin care companies recommend using a treatment program which may combine these ingredients. For example, AHAs can make the skin more vulnerable to damage from the sun, so the increased use of sunscreens is often recommended.\n\n"}

{"id": "63527", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=63527", "title": "Claude Rains", "text": "Claude Rains\n\nWilliam Claude Rains (10 November 188930 May 1967) was an English–American film and stage actor whose career spanned several decades. After his American film debut as Dr. Jack Griffin in \"The Invisible Man\" (1933) he appeared in classic films such as \"The Adventures of Robin Hood\" (1938), \"Mr. Smith Goes to Washington\" (1939), \"The Wolf Man\" (1941), \"Casablanca\" and \"Kings Row\" (both 1942), \"Notorious\" (1946), \"The Pied Piper of Hamelin\" (1957), and \"Lawrence of Arabia\" (1962).\n\nHe was a Tony Award winning actor and was a four-time nominee for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. Rains was considered to be \"one of the screen's great character stars\" who was, according to the \"All-Movie Guide\", \"at his best when playing cultured villains\". During his lengthy career, he was greatly admired by many of his contemporaries, such as Bette Davis, Vincent Sherman, Ronald Neame and Albert Dekker, all of whom became close family friends. Rains also inspired many younger actors, such as John Gielgud, Charles Laughton and Richard Chamberlain.\n\nWilliam Claude Rains was born on 10 November 1889 in Camberwell, London. His parents were Emily Eliza (née Cox) and the stage actor Frederick William Rains. He lived in the slums of London, and, in his own words, on \"the wrong side of the river Thames\" Rains was one of twelve children, all but three dying of malnutrition when still infants. His mother took in boarders in order to support the family. According to his daughter, Jessica Rains, he grew up with \"a very serious Cockney accent and a speech impediment\" which took the form of a stutter, causing him to call himself \"Willie Wains\"; she speaks of this in an interview on the 2004 DVD release of Universal Studio's Phantom of the Opera I, recorded in 2000. His accent was so strong that his daughter could not understand a word he said when he used it to sing old Cockney songs to her or purposely used it to playfully annoy her. Rains left school after the second grade to sell papers so that he could bring the pennies and halfpennies home for his mother. He sang in the Palm Street Church choir, which also brought him a few pence to take home.\nBecause his father was an actor, the young Rains would spend time in theatres and was surrounded by actors and stagehands. It was here where he could watch actors up close as well as the day-to-day running of a theatre. Rains made his stage debut at the age of 10 in the play \"Sweet Nell of Old Drury\" at the Haymarket Theatre, so that he could run around onstage as part of the production. He then slowly worked his way up in the theatre, becoming a call boy (telling actors when they were due on stage) at His Majesty's Theatre and later prompter, stage manager, understudy, and then moving on from smaller parts with good reviews to larger, better parts. \n\nRains decided to go to America in 1913 due to the opportunities that were being offered in the New York theatres; but with the outbreak of World WarI the following year, he returned to England to serve in the London Scottish Regiment, alongside fellow actors Basil Rathbone, Ronald Colman, and Herbert Marshall. At one time, he was involved in a gas attack which resulted in his losing 90 percent of the vision in his right eye permanently. By the end of the war, he had risen from the rank of private to that of captain.\n\nAfter the war ended, Rains remained in England, where he continued to develop his acting talents. These talents were recognised by Sir Herbert Beerbohm Tree, the founder of the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art. Tree told Rains that in order to succeed as an actor he would have to get rid of his Cockney accent and speech impediment. With this in mind, Tree paid for the elocution books and lessons that Rains needed to help him change his voice. Rains eventually shed his accent and speech impediment after practicing every day. His daughter Jessica, when describing her father's voice, said, \"The interesting thing to me was that he became a different person. He became a very elegant man, with a really extraordinary Mid-Atlantic accent. It was 'his' voice, nobody else spoke like that, half American, half English and a little Cockney thrown in.\" Jessica Rains speaks of this in the interview on Universal Studio's 2004 DVD release of Phantom of the Opera, recorded in 2000. Soon after changing his accent he became recognised as one of the leading stage actors in London. At the age of 29, he played the role of Clarkis in his one (and only) silent film, a British film titled \"Build Thy House\" (1920).\n\nDuring his early years, Rains also taught at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts (RADA), where John Gielgud and Charles Laughton were some of his students. In an interview for Turner Classic Movies, Gielgud fondly remembered Rains: \n\nI learnt a great deal about acting from this gentleman. Claude Rains was one of my teachers at RADA. In fact he was one of the best and most popular teachers there. He was extremely attractive and needless to say, all the girls in my class were hopelessly in love with him. He had piercing dark eyes and a beautifully throaty voice, although he had, like Marlene Dietrich, some trouble with the letter 'R'. He lacked inches and wore lifts to his shoes to increase his height. Stocky but handsome, Rains had broad shoulders and a mop of thick brown hair which he brushed over one eye. But by the time I first met him in the 1920s he was already much in demand as a character actor in London. I found him enormously helpful and encouraging to work with. I was always trying to copy him in my first years as an actor, until I decided to imitate Noël Coward instead.\nRains began his career in London theatre, achieving success in the title role of John Drinkwater's play \"Ulysses S. Grant\", the follow-up to the same playwright's \"Abraham Lincoln\". He also portrayed Faulkland in Richard Brinsley Sheridan's \"The Rivals\", presented at London's Lyric Theatre in 1925. Rains returned to New York in 1927 to appear in what would be nearly 20 Broadway roles. He moved to Broadway in the late 1920s to act in leading roles in such plays as George Bernard Shaw's \"The Apple Cart\" and the dramatisations of \"The Constant Nymph\" and Pearl S. Buck's novel \"The Good Earth\" (as a Chinese farmer).\n\nAlthough he had played the single supporting role in the silent, \"Build Thy House\" (1920), Rains came relatively late to film acting and while working for the Theatre Guild, he was offered a screen test with Universal Pictures in 1932. His screen test for \"A Bill of Divorcement\" (1932) for a New York representative of RKO was a failure but, according to some accounts, led to his being cast in the title role of James Whale's \"The Invisible Man\" (1933) after his screen test and unique voice was inadvertently overheard from the next room. His agent, Harold Freedman, was a family friend of Carl Laemmle, who controlled Universal Studios at the time, and \nhad been acquainted with Rains in London and was keen to cast him in the role. According to Rains' daughter, this was the only film of his he ever saw. He also did not go to see the rushes of the day's filming \"because he told me, every time he went he was horrified by his huge face on the huge screen, that he just never went back again.\"\n\nRains signed a long term contract with Warner Bros. on 27 November 1935 with Warner able to exercise the right to loan him to other studios and Rains having a potential income of up to $750,000 over 7 years. He played the villainous role of Prince John in \"The Adventures of Robin Hood\" (1938). Roddy McDowall once asked Rains if he had intentionally lampooned Bette Davis in his performance as Prince John, and Rains' only reply was \"an enigmatic smile.\" Rains later revealed to his daughter that he'd enjoyed playing the prince as a homosexual, by using subtle mannerisms. Rains later credited the film's co-director Michael Curtiz with teaching him the more understated requirements of film acting, or \"what not to do in front of a camera.\" On loan to Columbia Pictures, he portrayed a corrupt U.S. senator in \"Mr. Smith Goes to Washington\" (1939) for which he received his first Academy Award nomination as Best Supporting Actor. For his home studio, Warner Bros, he played the murderer, Dr. Alexander Tower, in \"Kings Row\" (1942) and the cynical police chief Captain Renault in \"Casablanca\" (also 1942). On loan again, Rains played the title character in Universal's remake of \"Phantom of the Opera\" (1943).\n\nIn her 1987 memoir, \"This 'N That\", Bette Davis revealed that Rains (with whom she shared the screen four times in \"Juarez\", \"Now, Voyager\", \"Mr. Skeffington\", and \"Deception\") was her favorite co-star. Rains became the first actor to receive a million-dollar salary when he portrayed Julius Caesar in a large budget but unsuccessful version of Shaw's \"Caesar and Cleopatra\" (1945), filmed in Britain. Shaw apparently chose him for the part, although Rains intensely disliked Gabriel Pascal, the film's director and producer. Rains followed it with Alfred Hitchcock's \"Notorious\" (1946) as a refugee Nazi agent opposite Cary Grant and Ingrid Bergman. Back in Britain, he appeared in David Lean's \"The Passionate Friends\" (1949).\n\nHis only singing and dancing role was in a 1957 television musical version of Robert Browning's \"The Pied Piper of Hamelin\", with Van Johnson as the Piper. The NBC colour special, broadcast as a film rather than a live or videotaped programme, was highly successful with the public. Sold into syndication after its first telecast, it was repeated annually by many local US TV stations.\n\nRains remained active as a character actor in the 1950s and 1960s, appearing in films and as a guest in television series. Two of his late screen roles were as Dryden, a cynical British diplomat in \"Lawrence of Arabia\" (1962) and King Herod in \"The Greatest Story Ever Told\" (1965), his last film. In CBS's \"Rawhide\", he portrayed Alexander Langford, an attorney in a ghost town, in the episode \"Incident of Judgement Day\" (1963)\n\nHe additionally made several audio recordings, narrating some Bible stories for children on Capitol Records, and reciting Richard Strauss's setting for narrator and piano of Tennyson's poem \"Enoch Arden\", with the piano solos performed by Glenn Gould. He starred in \"The Jeffersonian Heritage\", a 1952 series of 13 half-hour radio programmes recorded by the National Association of Educational Broadcasters and syndicated for commercial broadcast on a sustaining (i.e., commercial-free) basis.\n\nJessica Rains remembered her father's work ethic:\nBette Davis in an interview with Dick Cavett said about Rains:\n\nDavis later went on to describe him: \"Claude was witty, amusing and beautiful, really beautiful, thoroughly enchanting to be with and brilliant.\" She also praised his performances: \"He was marvelous in \"Deception\" and was worth the whole thing as the picture wasn't terribly good, but he was so marvelous and the restaurant scene where he's talking about all the food...brilliant and of course in Skeffington he was absolutely brilliant as the husband, just brilliant.\"\n\nRichard Chamberlain worked with Rains in what would be his second to last film, \"Twilight of Honor\". When interviewed for Turner Classic Movies, Chamberlain said,\n\nIn \"Twilight of Honor\" Rains played a retired lawyer acting as a mentor to Chamberlain's character. Reminiscing about his work with Rains, Chamberlain said: \n\nMany years later, after Rains had gone to Hollywood and become a well-known film actor, John Gielgud is reputed to have commented, \"He was a great influence on me. I don't know what happened to him. I think he failed and went to America.\" However, Gielgud later went on to recollect a time when he was in New York and in the audience during an event that included a focus on Bette Davis.\n\nBette Davis often cited Rains as one of her favorite actors and colleagues. Gielgud commented that he once wrote that \"The London stage suffered a great loss when Claude Rains deserted it for motion pictures\", but he later went on to say, \"but when I see him now on the screen and remember him, I must admit that the London stage's loss was the cinema's gain. And the striking virtuosity that I witnessed as a young actor is now there for audiences everywhere to see for all time. I'm so glad of that.\"\n\nRains became a naturalized citizen of the United States in 1939. He married six times, and was divorced from the first five of his wives: Isabel Jeans (married 1913–1915); Marie Hemingway (to whom Rains was married for less than a year in 1920); Beatrix Thomson (1924–8 April 1935); Frances Propper (9 April 1935 – 1956); and the classical pianist Agi Jambor (4 November 1959 – 1960). In 1960, he married Rosemary Clark Schrode, to whom he was married until her death on 31 December 1964. His only child, Jennifer, was born on 24 January 1938, the daughter of Frances Propper. As an actress, she is known as Jessica Rains.\n\nHe acquired the Stock Grange Farm, built in 1747 in West Bradford Township, Pennsylvania (just outside Coatesville), in 1941. The farm became one of the \"great prides\" of his life. Here, he became a \"gentleman farmer\" and could relax and enjoy farming life with his then wife (Frances) churning the butter, their daughter collecting the eggs, with Rains himself ploughing the fields and cultivating the vegetable garden. He spent much of his time between film takes reading up on agricultural techniques to try when he got home. He sold the farm when his marriage to Propper ended in 1956, the building now, as then, is still referred to by locals as \"Rains' Place\". Rains spent his final years in Sandwich, New Hampshire.\n\nIn his final years, Rains decided to write his memoirs and engaged the help of journalist Jonathan Root to assist him. Rains' declining health delayed their completion and with Root's death in March 1967 the project was never completed. He died from an abdominal hemorrhage in Laconia on 30May 1967, aged 77. His daughter said, \"And, just like most actors, he died waiting for his agent to call.\" He was buried at the Red Hill Cemetery in Moultonborough, New Hampshire. He designed his own tombstone which reads \"All things once, Are things forever, Soul, once living, lives forever\".\n\nIn 2010, many of Rains' personal effects were put into an auction at Heritage Auctions, including his 1951 Tony award, rare posters, letters and photographs. Also included in the auction were many volumes of his private leather-bound scrapbooks which contained many of his press cuttings and reviews from the beginning of his career. The majority of the items were used to help David J. Skal write his book on Rains \"An Actor's Voice\". In 2011, the ivory military uniform (complete with medals) he wore as Captain Renault in \"Casablanca\" was put up for auction when noted actress and film historian Debbie Reynolds sold her collection of Hollywood costumes and memorabilia which she had amassed as a result of the 1970 MGM auction.\n\nIn 1951, Rains won a Tony Award for Best Performance by a Leading Actor in a Play for \"Darkness at Noon\" as well as the Delia Austrian medal for the same production. He was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor on four occasions: for \"Mr. Smith Goes to Washington\" (1939), \"Casablanca\" (1943), \"Mr. Skeffington\" (1944) and \"Notorious\" (1946). Rains was awarded a Star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, at 6400 Hollywood Boulevard on February 8, 1960.\n\nIn the television series \"Heroes\" the character portrayed by Christopher Eccleston does not reveal his real name and uses the alias 'Claude Rains' due to his ability to turn himself, any personal objects he touches, and other people invisible; his alias is an obvious homage to Rains who played \"The Invisible Man\".\n\nRains starred in multiple plays and productions over the course of his career, playing a variety of leading and supporting parts. As his film career began to flourish, he found less time to perform in the theatre in both England and America.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Combat Stress makes available treatment for all Veterans who are suffering with mental illness free of charge.\n\nOn average, it takes 13 years for a Veteran to first contact with Combat Stress for advice, help, and treatment; however for those who served in Iraq (Gulf War I and Gulf War II) and Afghanistan, the time period is much lower.\n\nThe charity was formed in 1919, as the Ex-Servicemen's Welfare Society, following World War I; when the effects of shell shock were becoming known.\n\nSoldiers (and other frontline personnel) returning home from World War I suffered greatly from the horrors of war that they had witnessed. Many returning veterans suffered from what was then known as shell shock; now known as post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).\n\nIn 1915, the British Army in France was instructed that:\nIn August 1916, Charles Myers was made Consulting Psychologist to the Army. He hammered home the notion that it was necessary to create special centres near the line using treatment based on:\nHe also used hypnosis with limited success.\n\nIn December 1916, Gordon Holmes was put in charge of the northern, and more important, part of the western front. He had much more of the tough attitudes of the Army, and suited the prevailing military mindset, and so his view prevailed. By June 1917, all British cases of 'shell-shock' were evacuated to a nearby neurological centre, and were labelled as NYDN – 'not yet diagnosed nervous'. \"But, because of the Adjutant-General's distrust of doctors, no patient could receive that specialist attention until Form AF 3436 had been sent off to the man’s unit and filled in by his commanding officer.\" This created significant delays, but demonstrated that between 4-10% of shell-shock W cases were 'commotional' (due to physical causes), and the rest were 'emotional'. This killed off shell-shock as a valid disease, and it was abolished in September 1918.\n\nDuring the war, 306 British soldiers were executed for cowardice; many of whom were victims of shell shock. On 7 November 2006, the Government of the United Kingdom gave them all a posthumous conditional pardon. The Shot at Dawn Memorial at the National Memorial Arboretum in Staffordshire commemorates these men.\n\nCombat Stress was formed at a time when there was little known about mental health problems affecting ex-Service men and women who had returned home after serving in war and conflict zones.\n\nCurrently, the organisation is helping almost 6,000 people who are Veterans aged from 19 to 97. Combat Stress are currently treating 971 Veterans who served in Afghanistan and 1,185 who served in Iraq.\n\nSupport is currently being given to those who suffer from:\nThis support is delivered throughout England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland; through three treatment centres (Hollybush House, Ayr, Ayrshire, Scotland; Audley Court, Newport, Shropshire, England; and Tyrwhitt House, Leatherhead, Surrey, England), along with community outreach teams.\n\nThe services provided:\n\n"}

These techniques have the express goal of avoiding complexity issues, also called NP-hard problems, by using human-like techniques. They are best summarized as the use of exemplar-based methods (heuristics), rather than rule-based methods (algorithms). Hence the term is distinct from the more conventional computational \"algorithmic\" intelligence, or GOFAI. An example of a CHI technique is the encoding specificity principle of Tulving and Thompson. In general, CHI principles are problem solving techniques used by people, rather than programmed into machines. It is by drawing attention to this key distinction that the use of this term is justified in a field already replete with confusing neologisms. Note that the legal systems of all modern human societies employ both heuristics (generalisations of cases) from individual trial records as well as legislated statutes (rules) as regulatory guides.\n\nAnother recent approach to the avoidance of complexity issues is to employ feedback control rather than feedforward modeling as a problem-solving paradigm. This approach has been called computational cybernetics, because (a) the term 'computational' is associated with conventional computer programming techniques which represent a strategic, compiled, or feedforward model of the problem, and (b) the term 'cybernetic' is associated with conventional system operation techniques which represent a tactical, interpreted, or feedback model of the problem. Of course, real programs and real problems both contain both feedforward and feedback components. A real example which illustrates this point is that of human cognition, which clearly involves both perceptual (bottom-up, feedback, sensor-oriented) and conceptual (top-down, feedforward, motor-oriented) information flows and hierarchies.\n\n"}
{"id": "238029", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=238029", "title": "Crushing (execution)", "text": "Crushing (execution)\n\nDeath by crushing or pressing is a method of execution that has a history during which the techniques used varied greatly from place to place, generally involving the placement of intense weight upon a person with the intent to kill. This form of execution is no longer sanctioned by any governing body.\n\nA common method of death throughout South and South-East Asia for over 4,000 years was crushing by elephants. The Romans and Carthaginians used this method on occasion.\n\nIn Roman mythology, Tarpeia was a Roman maiden who betrayed the city of Rome to the Sabines in exchange for what she thought would be a reward of jewelry. She was instead crushed to death and her body cast from the Tarpeian Rock which now bears her name.\n\nCrushing is also reported from pre-Columbian America, notably in the Aztec Empire.\n\nPeine forte et dure (Law French for \"forceful and hard punishment\") was a method of torture formerly used in the common law legal system, in which a defendant who refused to plead (\"stood mute\") would be subjected to having heavier and heavier stones placed upon his or her chest until a plea was entered, or as the weight of the stones on the chest became too great for the condemned to breathe, fatal suffocation would occur.\n\nThe common law courts originally took a very limited view of their own jurisdiction. They considered themselves to lack jurisdiction over a defendant until he had voluntarily submitted to it by entering a plea seeking judgment from the court. Obviously, a criminal justice system that punished only those who volunteered for punishment was unworkable; this was the means chosen to coerce them.\n\nMany defendants charged with capital offences nonetheless refused to plead, since thereby they would escape forfeiture of property, and their heirs would still inherit their estate; but if the defendant pleaded guilty and was executed, their heirs would inherit nothing, their property escheating to the Crown. \"Peine forte et dure\" was abolished in Great Britain in 1772, and the last known use of the practice was in 1741. In 1772, refusing to plead was deemed to be equivalent to pleading guilty. This was changed in 1827 to being deemed a plea of not guilty. Today, in all common law jurisdictions, standing mute is treated by the courts as equivalent to a plea of not guilty.\n\nThe elaborate procedure was recorded by a 15th-century witness in an oft-quoted description: \"he will lie upon his back, with his head covered and his feet, and one arm will be drawn to one quarter of the house with a cord, and the other arm to another quarter, and in the same manner it will be done with his legs; and let there be laid upon his body iron and stone, as much as he can bear, or more ...\"\n\n\"Pressing to death\" might take several days, and not necessarily with a continued increase in the load. The Frenchman Guy Miege, who from 1668 taught languages in London says the following about the English practice:\nThe most famous case in the United Kingdom was that of Roman Catholic martyr St Margaret Clitherow, who (in order to avoid a trial in which her own children would be obliged to give evidence) was pressed to death on March 25, 1586, after refusing to plead to the charge of having harboured Catholic (then outlawed) priests in her house. She died within fifteen minutes under a weight of at least 700 pounds (320 kg). Several hardened criminals, including William Spigott (1721) and Edward Burnworth, lasted a half hour under 400 pounds (180 kg) before pleading to the indictment. Others, such as Major Strangways (1658) and John Weekes (1731), refused to plead, even under 400 pounds (180 kg), and were killed when bystanders, out of mercy, sat on them.\n\nThe only death by \"peine forte et dure\" in American history was Giles Corey, who was pressed to death on September 19, 1692, during the Salem witch trials, after he refused to enter a plea in the judicial proceeding. According to legend, his last words as he was being crushed were \"More weight\", and he was thought to be dead as the weight was applied. This is referred to in Arthur Miller's political drama \"The Crucible\" (1953), where Giles Corey is pressed to death after refusing to plead \"aye or nay\" to the charge of witchcraft. In the 1996 film version of this play, the screenplay also written by Arthur Miller, Corey is crushed to death for refusing to reveal the name of a source of information.\n\nIn medieval Europe, the slow crushing of body parts in screw-operated \"bone vises\" of iron was a common method of torture, and a tremendous variety of cruel instruments were used to savagely crush the head, the knee, the hand, and, most commonly, either the thumb or the naked foot. Such instruments were finely threaded and variously provided with spiked inner surfaces or heated red-hot before their application to the limb to be tortured.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "8888", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8888", "title": "Déjà vu", "text": "Déjà vu\n\nDéjà vu (; is a French term describing the feeling that one has lived through the present situation before.\n\"Déjà vu\" is a feeling of familiarity and \"déjà vécu\" (the feeling of having \"already lived through\" something) is a feeling of recollection. Scientific approaches reject the explanation of \"déjà vu\" as \"precognition\" or \"prophecy,\" but rather explain it as an anomaly of memory, since despite the strong sense of recollection, the time, place, and practical context of the \"previous\" experience are uncertain or believed to be impossible. Two types of \"déjà vu\" are recognized: the pathological \"déjà vu\" usually associated with epilepsy or that, when unusually prolonged or frequent, or associated with other symptoms such as hallucinations, may be an indicator of neurological or psychiatric illness, and the non-pathological type characteristic of healthy people, about two-thirds of whom have had \"déjà vu\" experiences.\n\n\"Déjà vu\" is most strongly associated with temporal lobe epilepsy. This experience is a neurological anomaly related to epileptic electrical discharge in the brain, creating a strong sensation that an event or experience currently being experienced has already been experienced in the past.\n\nEarly researchers tried to establish a link between \"déjà vu\" and mental disorders such as anxiety, dissociative identity disorder and schizophrenia but failed to find correlations of any diagnostic value. No special association has been found between déjà vu and schizophrenia. A 2008 study found that \"déjà vu\" experiences are unlikely to be pathological dissociative experiences.\n\nSome research has looked into genetics when considering \"déjà vu\". Although there is not currently a gene associated with \"déjà vu\", the LGII gene on chromosome 10 is being studied for a possible link. Certain forms of the gene are associated with a mild form of epilepsy and, though by no means a certainty, \"déjà vu\", along with jamais vu, occurs often enough during seizures (such as simple partial seizures) that researchers have reason to suspect a link.\n\nCertain drugs increase the chances of \"déjà vu\" occurring in the user, resulting in a strong sensation that an event or experience currently being experienced has already been experienced in the past. Some pharmaceutical drugs, when taken together, have also been implicated in the cause of \"déjà vu\". Taiminen and Jääskeläinen (2001) reported the case of an otherwise healthy male who started experiencing intense and recurrent sensations of \"déjà vu\" upon taking the drugs amantadine and phenylpropanolamine together to relieve flu symptoms. He found the experience so interesting that he completed the full course of his treatment and reported it to the psychologists to write up as a case study. Because of the dopaminergic action of the drugs and previous findings from electrode stimulation of the brain (e.g. Bancaud, Brunet-Bourgin, Chauvel, & Halgren, 1994), Taiminen and Jääskeläinen speculate that \"déjà vu\" occurs as a result of hyperdopaminergic action in the mesial temporal areas of the brain.\n\nResearch has associated \"déjà vu\" experiences with good memory functions.\n\nThe similarity between a \"déjà-vu\"-eliciting stimulus and an existing, or non-existing but different, memory trace may lead to the sensation that an event or experience currently being experienced has already been experienced in the past. Thus, encountering something that evokes the implicit associations of an experience or sensation that \"cannot be remembered\" may lead to \"déjà vu\".\n\nIn an effort to reproduce the sensation experimentally, Banister and Zangwill (1941) used hypnosis to give participants posthypnotic amnesia for material they had already seen. When this was later re-encountered, the restricted activation caused thereafter by the posthypnotic amnesia resulted in 3 of the 10 participants reporting what the authors termed \"paramnesias\".\n\nMemory-based explanations may lead to the development of a number of non-invasive experimental methods by which a long sought-after analogue of \"déjà vu\" can be reliably produced that would allow it to be tested under well-controlled experimental conditions. Cleary suggests that \"déjà vu\" may be a form of familiarity-based recognition (recognition that is based on a feeling that an event or experience currently being experienced has already been experienced in the past) and that laboratory methods of probing familiarity-based recognition hold promise for probing \"déjà vu\" in laboratory settings.\n\nA 2012 study in the journal \"Consciousness and Cognition\", that used virtual reality technology to study reported \"déjà vu\" experiences, supported this idea. This virtual reality investigation suggested that similarity between a new scene's spatial layout and the layout of a previously experienced scene in memory (but which fails to be recalled) may contribute to the \"déjà vu\" experience. When the previously experienced scene fails to come to mind in response to viewing the new scene, that previously experienced scene in memory can still exert an effect—that effect may be a feeling of familiarity with the new scene that is subjectively experienced as a feeling that an event or experience currently being experienced has already been experienced in the past, or of having been there before despite knowing otherwise.\n\nAnother possible explanation for the phenomenon of \"déjà vu\" is the occurrence of \"cryptomnesia\", which is where information learned is forgotten but nevertheless stored in the brain, and similar occurrences invoke the contained knowledge, leading to a feeling of familiarity because the event or experience being experienced has already been experienced in the past, known as \"déjà vu\". Some experts suggest that memory is a process of reconstruction, rather than a recall of fixed, established events. This reconstruction comes from stored components, involving elaborations, distortions, and omissions. Each successive recall of an event is merely a recall of the last reconstruction. The proposed sense of recognition (\"déjà vu\") involves achieving a good \"match\" between the present experience and our stored data. This reconstruction, however, may now differ so much from the original event that we \"know\" we have never experienced it before, even though it seems similar.\n\nIn 1963, Robert Efron of Boston's Veterans Hospital proposed that \"déjà vu\" is caused by dual neurological processing caused by delayed signals. Efron found that the brain's sorting of incoming signals is done in the temporal lobe of the brain's left hemisphere. However, signals enter the temporal lobe \"twice\" before processing, once from each hemisphere of the brain, normally with a slight delay of milliseconds between them. Efron proposed that if the two signals were occasionally not synchronized properly, then they would be processed as two separate experiences, with the second seeming to be a re-living of the first.\n\nOne theory of \"déjà vu\" attributes the feeling of having previously seen or experienced something that is currently being seen or experienced to that of having dreamt about a similar situation or place and then forgetting about it until one seems to be mysteriously reminded of the situation or the place while awake. The spontaneity of these types of \"déjà vu\" \"moments\" can catch many people off-guard, especially when they get the sensation from visiting a specific place they have never been to before, to the point where they are in a temporary state of shock and disbelief.\n\n\"Jamais vu\" (from French, meaning \"never seen\") is a term in psychology which is used to describe any familiar situation which is not recognized by the observer.\n\nOften described as the opposite of \"déjà vu\", \"jamais vu\" involves a sense of eeriness and the observer's impression of seeing the situation for the first time, despite rationally knowing that he or she has been in the situation before. \"Jamais vu\" is more commonly explained as when a person momentarily does not recognize a word, person, or place that they already know. \"Jamais vu\" is sometimes associated with certain types of aphasia, amnesia, and epilepsy.\n\nTheoretically, a \"jamais vu\" feeling in a sufferer of a delirious disorder or intoxication could result in a delirious explanation of it, such as in the Capgras delusion, in which the patient takes a known person for a false double or impostor. If the impostor is himself, the clinical setting would be the same as the one described as depersonalisation, hence \"jamais vus\" of oneself or of the very \"reality of reality\", are termed depersonalisation (or surreality) feelings.\n\nThe feeling has been evoked through semantic satiation. Chris Moulin of the University of Leeds asked 95 volunteers to write the word \"door\" 30 times in 60 seconds. 68 percent of the subjects reported symptoms of \"jamais vu\", with some beginning to doubt that \"door\" was a real word.\n\nThe experience has also been named \"\"vuja de\" and \"véjà du\"\".\n\nPresque vu (, from French, meaning \"almost seen\") is the intense feeling of being on the very brink of a powerful epiphany, insight, or revelation, without actually achieving the revelation. The feeling is often therefore associated with a frustrating, tantalizing sense of incompleteness or near-completeness.\n\nDéjà rêvé (from French, meaning \"already dreamed\") is the feeling of having already dreamed something that you are now experiencing.\n\nDéjà entendu (literally \"already heard\") is the experience of feeling sure about having already heard something, even though the exact details are uncertain or were perhaps imagined.\n\nDéjà vous is a pun on the English pronunciation of déjà vu. The French pronunciation of the vowel U in vu, , is not a common vowel in English. Therefor déjà vu is usually pronounced with a in English. When pronounced this way, , it means \"already you\" in French, rather than \"already seen\" and is written \"déjà vous\".\n\n\n"}
{"id": "4215075", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4215075", "title": "Eduard Roschmann", "text": "Eduard Roschmann\n\nEduard Roschmann (25 November 1908 – 8 August 1977) was an Austrian Nazi SS-\"Obersturmführer\" and commandant of the Riga ghetto during 1943. He was responsible for numerous murders and other atrocities. As a result of a fictionalised portrayal in the novel \"The Odessa File\" by Frederick Forsyth and its subsequent film adaptation, Roschmann came to be known as the \"Butcher of Riga\".\n\nRoschmann was born on 25 November 1908, in Graz-Eggenberg, in Austria.\n\nRoschmann was once a lawyer in Graz, Austria. He was the son of a brewery manager. He was reputed to have come from the Styria region of Austria, from a good family. From 1927 to 1934, Roschmann was a member of the Fatherland's Front, which in turn was part of the Austrian home guard (\"Heimatschutz\"). From 1927 to 1934, Roschmann was associated with an organisation called the \"Steyr Homeland Protection Force.\" Roschmann spent six semesters at a university. By 1931, he was a brewery employee, joining the civil service in 1935. In 1938, he joined the Nazi Party, and the SS the following year. In January 1941, he was assigned to the Security Police.\n\nWithin the SS Roschmann was assigned to the Security Service (\"Sicherheitsdienst\"), often referred to by its German initials SD. Following the German occupation of Latvia in the Second World War, the SD established a presence in Latvia with the objective of killing all the Jews in the country. To this end, the SD established the Riga ghetto.\n\nThe Riga ghetto did not exist prior to the occupation of Latvia by the German armed forces. Jews in general lived throughout Riga before then. The ghetto itself was a creation of the SD. Surrounded by barbed wire fences, with armed guards, it was in effect a large and overcrowded prison. Furthermore, while it is common to see the Riga ghetto referred to as a single location, in fact it was only a unified prison for a very short time in autumn of 1941. After that it was split into three ghettos.\n\nThe first ghetto was the Latvian ghetto, sometimes called the \"Big Ghetto\", which was only in existence for 35 days, from late October to 30 November 1941. Men, women and children were forced into the ghetto, where at least for a short time they lived as families. On 30 November and on 8 December 1941, 24,000 Jews were force-marched out of the ghetto and shot at the nearby forest of Rumbula. Except for Babi Yar, this was the biggest two-day massacre in the genocides until the construction of the death camps in 1942. A few thousand Latvian Jews, mostly men, who were not murdered at Rumbula, were confined to a much smaller area of the former Latvia ghetto. This became known as the men's ghetto; about 500 Latvian Jewish women, who were also not selected for murder, were similarly confined to an adjacent but separated smaller ghetto, known as the women's ghetto.\n\nA few days after the 8 December massacre, train-loads of Jews from Germany, Austria and Czechoslovakia began to arrive in Riga, where, with some important exceptions, they were housed in a portion of the former Latvian ghetto, which then became known as the German ghetto.\n\nIn March 1942, the German authorities in charge of the Riga ghetto and the nearby Jungfernhof concentration camp murdered about 3,740 German, Austrian and Czech Jews who had been deported to Latvia. The victims were mostly the elderly, the sick and infirm and children. These people were tricked into believing they would be transported to a new and better camp facility at an area near Riga called Dünamünde. In fact no such facility existed, and the intent was to transport the victims to mass graves in the woods north of Riga and shoot them.\n\nAccording to a survivor, Edith Wolff, Roschmann was one of a group of SS men who selected the persons for \"transport\" to Dünamünde. (Others in the selection group included Rudolf Lange, Kurt Krause, Max Gymnich, Kurt R. Migge, Richard Nickel and Rudolf Seck). Wolff stated that only the \"prominent people\" made selections, and she was not sure whether Migge, Seck or Nickel had picked anyone.\n\nStarting in January 1943, Roschmann became commandant of the Riga ghetto. His immediate predecessor was Kurt Krause. Survivors described Krause as \"sadistic\",\"bloody\", \"monster\", and \"psychopath\". Roschmann's methods differed from those of Krause. Unlike Krause, Roschmann did not execute offenders on the spot, but, in most cases, sent them to Riga's Central Prison. Whether this was a matter of having qualms about murder is not certain. Being sent to the prison was likely to be, at best, only a brief reprieve, as conditions there were brutal.\n\nAt that time, Roschmann held the relatively low rank of Unterscharführer. Differing ranks are supplied for Roschmann. According to Ezergailis and Kaufmann, Roschmann held the rank of SS-Unterscharführer. According to Schneider, Roschmann was an SS-Obersturmführer, a higher rank. Schneider mentions no promotion for Roschmann.\n\nHistorians Angrick and Klein state that in addition to the mass killings the Holocaust in Latvia also consisted of a great number of individual murders.\n\nAngrick and Klein name Roschmann among others as responsible for these individual murders. Historian Schneider, a survivor of the German ghetto, has stated that it is certain that Roschmann was a murderer, otherwise he never would have risen as high as he did in the SS. One documented murder committed by Roschmann, with his subordinates assisted by Scharführer Max Gymnich and Kurt Migge, was that of Arthur Kaufmann, the 17-year-old son of Max Kaufmann, who later came to write one of the first histories of the Holocaust in Latvia. Roschmann personally issued the order for this particular murder. Kaufmann himself described the murder, which occurred when both of them were housed outside the ghetto at the Sloka work camp, where among other things they were tasked with peat cutting:\nFood for ghetto occupants was strictly rationed and generally inadequate. It was common for Jews assigned to work details to obtain and attempt to smuggle extra food into the ghetto. For this and other reasons, all returning work details were subject to search, although this was actually carried out only on a sporadic basis. When searches did occur, those smuggling food were forced to abandon it before it could be found on their person, which was a serious offence. Roschmann and his aide, Max Gymnich, accompanied by a trained attack dog, involved themselves in the details of the searches for contraband food, which included inspections of kitchens in the ghetto, again forcing people to discard food they had smuggled in, even when they were about to eat it. Survivor Nina Ungar related a similar incident at the Olaine peat bog work camp where Roschmann found 3 eggs on one of the Latvian Jews and had him shot immediately. Kaufmann describes an incident, possibly the same one referred to by Ungar, where Roschmann, during a visit to the Olaine work camp with Gymnich in 1943, found a singer named Karp with 5 eggs and had him shot immediately.\n\nRoschmann, together with Krause, who, although no longer ghetto commandant, was close at hand as the commandant of the Salaspils concentration camp, investigated a resistance plot among the Jews to store weapons at an old power magazine in Riga known as the Pulverturm. As a result, several hundred inmates were executed, whom Kaufmann described as \"our best young people.\"\n\nWhile ghetto commandant, Roschmann became involved with the work detail known as the Army Motor Park (\"Heereskraftpark\"). This was considered a favourable work assignment for Jews, as it involved skilled labour (vehicle mechanics) necessary for the German army, thus providing some protection from liquidation, and it also gave a number of opportunities to \"organise\" (that is, to buy, barter for or steal) contraband food and other items. The Jews on the work detail benefited from the fact that the German in charge, Private First Class (\"Obergefreiter\") Walter Eggers, was corrupt and wanted to use the Jews under his command to become rich. Consequently, better treatment could be had, at least for a time, by paying Eggers bribes. Roschmann heard rumours about the \"good life\", and attempted to prevent it by putting some of the workers into one of the prisons or transferring them to Kaiserwald concentration camp.\n\nRoschmann himself was not above accepting bribes, or at least pretending to accept bribes. In one instance, a shoemaker whose two children had been incarcerated in the Riga prisons as a result of Roschmann's investigation, attempted to secure their release by paying Roschmann a large number of gold coins. Roschmann took the coins, but did not release the children.\n\nRoschmann was later transferred to the Lenta work camp, a forced-labour facility in the Riga area where Jews were housed at the workplace. Originally this facility had been located on Washington (Ludendorff) Square in Riga and had been known as the \"Gestapo\" work detail. Lenta was considered a favoured work assignment. The original German commandant, Fritz Scherwitz, had determined to make a lot of money involving the work of highly skilled Jews in the tailoring trade. Scherwitz made efforts to protect Jews in the Lenta work detail. This changed when Roschmann became the Lenta commandant. According to Kaufmann:\nRoschmann participated in the efforts of Sonderkommando 1005 to conceal the evidence of the Nazi crimes in Latvia by exhuming and burning the bodies of the victims of the numerous mass shootings in the Riga area. In the fall of 1943, Roschmann was made the chief of \"Kommando Stützpunkt\", a work detail of prisoners which was given the task of digging up and burning the bodies of the tens of thousands of people whom the Nazis had shot and buried in the forests of Latvia. About every two weeks the men on the work detail were shot and replaced with a new set of inmates. Men for this commando were selected both from Kaiserwald concentration camp and from the few remaining people in the Riga ghetto.\n\nHistorian Ezergailis states that one Hasselbach, an SS officer, was the commander of the Stützpunkt commando, and does not mention Roschmann. As his source, Ezergailis cites a witness, Franz Leopold Schlesinger, who testified in the trial in West Germany of Viktors Arajs in the late 1970s, almost 35 years later. Schlesinger in turn appears to have only \"thought\" Hasselbach was the commander.\n\nRoschmann is sometimes described as the commandant of the Kaiserwald concentration camp, which was located on the north side of Riga. Kaufmann however gives the Kaiserwald commandant as an SS man named Sauer who held the rank of Obersturmbannführer.\n\nJack Ratz, a Latvian Jewish survivor, came face to face with Roschmann in Lenta at the age of 17. According to Jack:\nAccording to Gertrude Schneider, a historian and a survivor of the Riga ghetto, Roschmann was clearly a murderer, but was not uniformly cruel. She records an instance where Krause, Roschmann's predecessor as commandant, had executed Johann Weiss, a lawyer from Vienna, and a First World War veteran, for having hidden money in his glove. A year later, when Roschmann was commandant, his widow and daughter requested of him that he allow them the Jewish custom of visiting the grave. Roschmann allowed the request.\n\nSchneider, in describing this incident, characterised Roschmann as \"that most peculiar SS man.\" According to Schneider, Roschmann would order food abandoned during searches for contraband to be sent to the ghetto hospital. Schneider particularly objected to Roschmann's modern image as the so-called \"butcher of Riga\". Up to the time of the publication of Forsyth's book in 1972, Herberts Cukurs, a famous Latvian pilot, had been the person known as \"the Butcher of Riga\" as a result of his actions during the occupation of Latvia from 1941 to 1944.:\nOther accounts assign a more malignant role to Roschmann. Historian Bernard Press, a Latvian Jew who was able to hide outside of Riga and avoid confinement in the ghetto, describes Krause, Gymnich and Roschmann as having engaged in random shootings of human beings. Press describes an incident where a woman was condemned to death for \"illegal correspondence\" with a friend in Germany. Roschmann had her confined in the Central Prison, where she was not in fact executed but released based on the recommendation of Krause, who had previously wanted the woman to become his mistress.\n\nMax Michelson described Roschman, Rudolf Lange and Kurt Krause as all being \"notorious sadists.\" Michelson, a Riga ghetto survivor, described Roschmann:\nMax Kaufmann, a survivor of Latvian ghetto, compared Roschmann to Krause, coming to a similar conclusion as Max Michelson:\n\nIn October 1944, out of fear of the approaching Soviet armies, the SS personnel of the concentration camp system in Latvia fled the country by sea from Riga or Liepāja to Danzig, taking with them several thousand concentration camp inmates, many of whom did not survive the voyage.\nIn 1945, Roschmann was arrested in Graz but later released. Roschmann concealed himself as an ordinary prisoner of war, and in so doing obtained a release from custody in 1947. After that however he became imprudent and visited his wife in Graz. He was recognised with the assistance of former concentration camp inmates and arrested by the British military police. Roschmann was sent to Dachau concentration camp which had been converted to an imprisonment camp for accused war criminals. Roschmann succeeded in escaping from this custody.\n\nIn 1948 Roschmann was able to flee Germany. He travelled first to Genoa in Italy, and from there to Argentina by ship, on a pass supplied by the International Red Cross. Roschmann was assisted in this effort by Alois Hudal, a strongly pro-Nazi bishop of the Catholic Church. Roschmann arrived in Argentina either on 10 February 1948 or 2 October 1948 (2/10/1948 or 10/2/1948, depending on date notation used). He founded a wood import-export firm in Buenos Aires. In 1955 in Argentina Roschmann married, although he was not divorced from his first wife. His second wife left him in 1958; the marriage was later declared null and void. In 1968, under the name \"Frederico Wagner\" (sometimes seen as \"Federico Wegener\") he became a citizen of Argentina.\n\nIn 1959 a warrant was issued in Germany for him on a charge of bigamy. In 1960, the criminal court in Graz issued a warrant for the arrest of Roschmann on charges of murder and severe violations of human rights in connection with the killing of at least 3,000 Jews between 1938 and 1945, overseeing forced labourers at Auschwitz, and the murder of at least 800 children under the age of 10. However, the post-war Austrian legal system was ineffective in securing the return for trial of Austrians who had fled Europe, and no action was ever taken against Roschmann based on this charge. In 1963, the district court in Hamburg, West Germany issued a warrant for the arrest of Roschmann. This would eventually prove a more serious threat to Roschmann.\n\nIn October 1976, the embassy of West Germany in Argentina initiated a request for the extradition of Roschmann to Germany to face charges of multiple murders of Jews during the Second World War. This was based on the request of the West German prosecutor's office in Hamburg. The request was repeated in May 1977. On 5 July 1977, the office of the President of Argentina issued a communiqué, which was published in the Argentine press, that the government of Argentina would consider the request even though there was no extradition treaty with West Germany. The communiqué was reported to be a surprise to both the Argentine Foreign Ministry and the West German embassy. The Argentine Foreign Embassy had not received a request that Roschmann be arrested. Roschmann was in fact still not under arrest at the time the communiqué was issued.\n\nAt that time, a number of Germans had been arrested by the Argentine government, then under military control, and were facing charges before military tribunals. The Argentine government had also failed to account for the death of a West German citizen in unusual circumstances, apparently related to the conduct of the so-called Dirty War then being conducted by the Argentine government against alleged terrorists within the country. This was regarded by the West German government as a breach of international treaty obligations. In addition, the prominent Argentine journalist, Jacobo Timmerman, a Jew, had been arrested at that time and held incommunicado under circumstances which raised concern that he had been \"subjected to ill-treatment\" while in custody.\n\nRoschmann then fled to Paraguay.\n\nThe U.S. Embassy in Argentina sent a cable to the State Department which reported the situation and contained the following comment:\nRoschmann may have died in Asuncion, Paraguay on 8 August 1977.\nThe body initially went unclaimed, and questions were raised as to whether the dead man was, in fact, Roschmann. The body bore papers in the name of \"Federico Wegener\", a known Roschmann alias, and was missing two toes on one foot and three on the other, consistent with Roschmann's known war injuries. Emilio Wolf, a delicatessen owner in Asuncion who had been a prisoner under Roschmann, positively identified the body as Roschmann's. Simon Wiesenthal, however, was sceptical of the identification, noting that Roschmann had been spotted in Bolivia only one month earlier. \"I wonder who died for him?\" he said.\n\nA fictionalised version of Roschmann was given in Frederick Forsyth's novel \"The Odessa File\". A film version of the novel was released in 1974, where Roschmann was played by Austrian actor Maximilian Schell. In the book and the film, Roschmann is portrayed as a ruthlessly efficient killer. Nazi hunter Simon Wiesenthal was portrayed in the film by actor Shmuel Rodensky. Wiesenthal himself also functioned as a \"documentary advisor\". Historian Schneider sharply disputes this fictionalised image of Roschmann. She describes this fiction novel as \"lurid\" and containing \"many inaccuracies\". Among the inaccuracies of Forsyth's fictional version of Roschmann are:\n\nResearcher Matteo San Filippo, who studied the issue of the discrepancies between the fictional and the real Roschmann, gives the following analysis: \n\"We cannot blame Forsyth for being inaccurate. He was writing a thriller, not an historical essay. The incidents were based on fact and the overall impression was not inaccurate (for example, some religious houses did shelter the wanted, just not in Genoa. Roschmann did murder many people, but not a Wehrmacht captain. ODESSA did supply faked travel documents of different kinds. And so on).\"\n\nThe role of Wiesenthal in the genesis of the novel is more interesting. Later, the Nazi hunter confessed that he wanted to influence the writer. In fact, Wiesenthal was using the thriller to force Roschmann out into the open, which is what actually happened.\nWiesenthal himself, in his 1990 book \"Justice Not Vengeance\", admitted that he had suggested, in response to Forsyth's inquiry, that Forsyth's book, and the later film, include fictional statements about Roschmann, and that he, Wiesenthal, had done so for the purpose of casting the light on Roschmann and forcing his arrest. Roschmann was eventually identified and denounced by a man who had just watched \"The Odessa File\" at the cinema.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "56586969", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=56586969", "title": "GenI process", "text": "GenI process\n\nThe GenI process ( for Generic Intelligence) models team decision making by launching a chaotic competition between so-called ideas, where one idea after another dwindles out until exactly one remains. The decision statistics are completely determined by the process start configuration and match those known from quantum measurements. The random process accomplishes this in a natural way without any fine adjustment. Therefore, it is also of interest for the interpretation of physical processes.\n\nIn mathematical terms, the GenI process describes a time-discrete stochastic process formula_1 in the state space of the finite subsets of a countable set \"E\", together with a mapping formula_2 of the power set on \"E\" into an n-dimensional complex vector space. In principle, it can be classified as a Markov chain of first order, with variable transition probabilities formula_3.\n\nThere are two expressions of the GenI process, for formula_4 and for formula_5.\n\nThe GenI random process determines changes in the complex vector space from the random behavior of independent individuals within a swarm-like construct. The swarm has a superposition state formula_6, that controls the individual activities via a target function. The amplitudes formula_7 are also called ideas (cf \"Generalized Quantum Modeling\" ). The swarm takes one of the eigenstates formula_8 after a finite number of steps, with the well-defined probability formula_9. The individuals follow defined rules and are allowed to make mistakes, based on the processes in simulated shoals of fish. The GenI algorithm starts a chaotic decision-making process as a competition of ideas, such as running in a team that has to choose from a limited number of solutions to a given task. In the course of the process, a selection mechanism leads to ideas becoming extinct one after the other until finally just one survives that represents the solution to the problem.\n\nLet \"E\" be a countable set and formula_10 the set of finite subsets of \"E\". Next formula_11 the canonical basis in formula_12 and formula_13, where \"i\" is the imaginary unit in formula_14.\n\nA given formula_15 maps each element of \"E\" into formula_16, so that formula_17. For a set formula_18 the complex vector formula_19 denotes its state with complex amplitudes formula_20. Each such set \"S\" is called an Eigenvector-swarm or E-swarm.\n\nA pair formula_21 with formula_22 is a null pair. A tuple formula_23 is called a null ring generated by formula_24, if formula_25.\n\nA set formula_26 is called a null set, if formula_27. A maximal null set formula_28 is called the entropy of \"S\" and formula_29 the entropy free residual swarm.\n\nThe term formula_30 denotes the excitation of the swarm in index \"j\".\n\nLet formula_31 be a series of swarms (as an instantiation of formula_32) with the respective separation into a maximal null swarm formula_33 and the entropy free residual swarm formula_34, formula_35 the respective state and formula_36 the excitations.\n\nAs soon as the excitation disappears in each index, the process naturally comes to rest in step 4 (except for the hard abort condition in step 2), since no null pair is \"burned\" and the state of the swarm no longer changes. The role of the excitation here reminds of the dynamics of a grain of sand in the formation of the Chladnic sound figures. On the other hand, excitation as a target in step 5 leads to a systematic distortion from 50% likelihood for an individual to remain. This leads here to an improved tendency to reduce the excitation. The following interpretation is obvious based on biological swarm behavior: Each individual tends to follow the rule \"reduce the excitation\". It remains free in its decision to do nothing (step 4), to follow the rule, or to disregard it (step 5).\n\nThe reference implementation under JAVA shows an excellent convergence of the process. The table shows an example of the result of 1000 simulation runs (each simulation run aborts after more than 500 iterations or for swarm sizes> 10 million for performance reasons):\n\nThese results support the statement of convergence (hypothesis):\n\nLet formula_49 be a given E-swarm with formula_50, formula_51, formula_52, formula_53.\n\nLet formula_54 be a GenI process with formula_55.\n\nThen formula_56\n\nThe P(auli) process represents a special version of the GenI process for binary YES-NO decisions. It determines a time discrete stochastic process formula_57 in the state space of finite subsets of a countable set E, together with a map formula_58 from the power set on E into the complex matrix algebra formula_59, a perspective vector formula_60 and a basis formula_61.\n\nThe GenI random process determines changes in the complex vector space out of the random behavior of independent individuals within a swarm-like construct. The swarm \"S\" has an image formula_62 in the complex matrix algebra. Together with a perspective formula_60, the state of the swarm is determined by formula_64. A basis formula_61 is called the environment and represents the options under which the swarm makes a decision. This can also be the eigenvectors of formula_62 itself and so create a self-reference. The environment, perspective and state of the swarm control the individual activities via a target variable (excitation). The amplitudes formula_67 in the decomposition are also referred to as ideas with respect to the environment (see regarding \"Generalized Quantum Modeling\" ).

{"id": "13410126", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13410126", "title": "George Carew (admiral)", "text": "George Carew (admiral)\n\nSir George Carew (c. 1504 – 19 July 1545) was an English soldier, admiral and adventurer during the reign of King Henry VIII who died in the sinking of the Royal Navy flagship \"Mary Rose\" at the Battle of the Solent during an attempted French invasion in the Italian War of 1542–1546. Scion of a controversial and dramatic family, Carew had a wild youth and explored widely, being arrested several times of associating with rebellious vassals of the king. Carew successfully tamed this nature in his later years, during which he became a trusted advisor and military officer in the King's service.\n\nHe was the son and heir of Sir William Carew (died 1538) of Mohuns Ottery near Luppitt in Devon by his wife Joane Courtenay, second daughter of Sir William I Courtenay (died 1485) of Powderham, Sheriff of Devon in 1488. The exact date of George Carew's birth is unknown, but it is thought to have occurred between 1497 and 1504.\n\nGeorge and his brother Peter Carew were sent to be educated in the household of their mother's cousin Henry Courtenay, 1st Marquess of Exeter. There they learned from adventurous relatives like their uncle Gawen Carew and kinsman Nicholas Carew, the latter of whom was later arrested and executed for treason.\n\nCarew trained in the law, but swiftly became bored and in 1526 was in Blois, France, seeking service with Louise of Savoy, the French Regent. This attempt to serve a foreign power came to nothing, and was pardoned by King Henry VIII in November of the same year. The King also overlooked his youthful indiscretions with the followers of Elizabeth Barton and encouraged responsible behaviour in the young man.\n\nCarew became interested in politics in the early 1530s and briefly sat in 1529 as a Member of Parliament for Devon and later served as High Sheriff of Devon (for 1536 and 1542), during which period he was knighted. Carew was also married for the first time during the 1530s, to Thomasine Pollard, daughter of Sir Lewis Pollard (c. 1465 – 1540), Justice of the Common Pleas.\n\nIn 1537, Carew was given his first sea commission, serving in the English Channel under Sir John Dudley during operations against pirates. In the following year 1538 he inherited his father's estates and returned to Devon to serve as Justice of the Peace. In 1539 Carew's wife Thomasine Pollard died and he again entered the King's service, taking over the strategically vital fort of Rysbank in the Calais Pale. The fort's previous commander and Carew's kinsman Nicholas Carew had paid with his life for his machinations against the King. George Carew was disgusted with the poor state of readiness and repair in which he found the fort and set about effecting repairs and became involved in the administration of Calais under its Deputy Arthur Plantagenet, 1st Viscount Lisle.\n\nCarew took pains during this period to distance himself from the Roman Catholic upbringing he had in the household of the Marquess of Exeter and openly supported Protestant groups who had fled to Calais after persecution elsewhere in Europe. His stance on this issue brought admiration from several contemporaries, including John Foxe. Carew was with the deputation which met Anne of Cleves in December 1539 and the following year he was briefly arrested and questioned in relation to a plan to hand Rysbank over to the French, a plot in which Lisle was implicated but Carew apparently was not. In the late autumn of 1540 Carew remarried, to Mary Norris, daughter of the courtier Sir Henry Norreys of Berkshire, and the couple settled at Polslo Priory near Exeter. Carew had taken his position seriously, and was rewarded with a second term as sheriff in 1542 and was appointed Steward of the possessions of the Marquis of Exeter, a role with annual salary of £30. Two years later in 1544 he was made lieutenant of the Gentlemen Pensioners and was awarded the large salary of £365 a year.\n\nApparently bored with Rysbank and political life, in the summer of 1543 Carew applied to join the army of Sir John Wallop in Flanders as a lieutenant general of horse. Although Carew was an accomplished jouster, he was tactically inexperienced and learned the military arts through his position on Wallop's army council. With his brother Peter, George Carew saw action in skirmishes outside the French-held towns of Thérouanne and Landrecies during Wallop's campaigns against those towns. At Landrecis, Carew twice came close to disaster, almost being killed by a sniper's bullet during the summer and in November actually being captured after pursuing a fleeing band of French cavalry too far and finding himself isolated. He was soon freed however at the express request of King Henry VIII and was returned to the English army. In 1544 Carew raised twenty soldiers to join Wallop's campaign against Boulogne and was also given a subordinate naval command under Dudley in the English Channel.\n\nIn July 1545, with a French invasion expected, Carew was summoned to King Henry VIII's council of war aboard his flagship \"Great Harry\" in Portsmouth. There Carew was appointed Vice-Admiral in charge of the fleet in Portsmouth and presented with a golden whistle as symbol of office. The French fleet landed on the Isle of Wight the same day and shortly afterwards sailed for Portsmouth. The French force greatly outnumbered the English, comprising 175 ships including 25 great galleys. Carew, as captain of the \"Mary Rose\", the vice-flagship of the English carrack fleet, sailed to confront them and met with disaster.\n\nThough it may never be known exactly why the \"Mary Rose\" sank in the entrance to Portsmouth harbour on 19 July 1545, it is believed that water entered open gunports after firing a broadside and the ship went down in minutes. The report that Carew's last words called out to his uncle Gawen Carew aboard an accompanying ship, that \"I have the sort of knaves I cannot rule\", may indicate command and discipline problems. Carew had only taken command of the ship that same day and his authority was far from established. The dangerous combination of winds, tides and shallows makes the Solent a particularly hazardous body of water. Modern studies have also indicated that the aging 700-ton warship was dangerously overloaded, with heavy bronze cannon that she was not designed to carry, and nearly 500 men aboard, many dressed in full armour. Forensic examination of the crew's skulls, has revealed that the majority of the men aboard 'Mary Rose' the day she foundered were probably from Southern Europe, maybe mercenaries or prisoners of war.\n\nHenry VIII watched from Southsea Castle as the \"Mary Rose\" heeled over and sank shortly after joining the battle, and heard the screams of her drowning crew, most of whom were trapped beneath a heavy anti-boarding net stretched across her weather deck. Of the 500 men aboard less than 25 survived and Carew was not among them. His body was never recovered. Despite the disaster, the French fleet failed to engage effectively with the English and turned away to perform minor raids elsewhere on the coast and returned to France in August. Carew's widow was given a job in the royal household as a lady in waiting to the King's daughters princesses Mary and Elizabeth. She later married Sir Arthur Champernowne, and died in 1570. When the \"Mary Rose\" was raised nearly 450 years later, pewter plates stamped with \"G.C.\", Carew's initials, were among the artifacts recovered from the wreck.\n\nGeorge Carew married twice, but left no children:\n\n"}
{"id": "14170", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14170", "title": "HIV", "text": "HIV\n\nThe human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is a lentivirus (a subgroup of retrovirus) that causes HIV infection and over time acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). AIDS is a condition in humans in which progressive failure of the immune system allows life-threatening opportunistic infections and cancers to thrive. Without treatment, average survival time after infection with HIV is estimated to be 9 to 11 years, depending on the HIV subtype. In most cases, HIV is a sexually transmitted infection and occurs by contact with or transfer of blood, pre-ejaculate, semen, and vaginal fluids. Non-sexual transmission can occur from an infected mother to her infant during pregnancy, during childbirth by exposure to her blood or vaginal fluid, and through breast milk. Within these bodily fluids, HIV is present as both free virus particles and virus within infected immune cells.\n\nHIV infects vital cells in the human immune system, such as helper T cells (specifically CD4 T cells), macrophages, and dendritic cells. HIV infection leads to low levels of CD4 T cells through a number of mechanisms, including pyroptosis of abortively infected T cells, apoptosis of uninfected bystander cells, direct viral killing of infected cells, and killing of infected CD4 T cells by CD8 cytotoxic lymphocytes that recognize infected cells. When CD4 T cell numbers decline below a critical level, cell-mediated immunity is lost, and the body becomes progressively more susceptible to opportunistic infections, leading to the development of AIDS.\n\nHIV is a member of the genus \"Lentivirus\", part of the family \"Retroviridae\". Lentiviruses have many morphologies and biological properties in common. Many species are infected by lentiviruses, which are characteristically responsible for long-duration illnesses with a long incubation period. Lentiviruses are transmitted as single-stranded, positive-sense, enveloped RNA viruses. Upon entry into the target cell, the viral RNA genome is converted (reverse transcribed) into double-stranded DNA by a virally encoded enzyme, reverse transcriptase, that is transported along with the viral genome in the virus particle. The resulting viral DNA is then imported into the cell nucleus and integrated into the cellular DNA by a virally encoded enzyme, integrase, and host co-factors. Once integrated, the virus may become latent, allowing the virus and its host cell to avoid detection by the immune system, for an indiscriminate amount of time. The HIV virus can remain dormant in the human body for up to ten years after primary infection; during this period the virus does not cause symptoms. Alternatively, the integrated viral DNA may be transcribed, producing new RNA genomes and viral proteins, using host cell resources, that are packaged and released from the cell as new virus particles that will begin the replication cycle anew.\n\nTwo types of HIV have been characterized: HIV-1 and HIV-2. HIV-1 is the virus that was initially discovered and termed both lymphadenopathy associated virus (LAV) and human T-lymphotropic virus 3 (HTLV-III). HIV-1 is more virulent and more infective than HIV-2, and is the cause of the majority of HIV infections globally. The lower infectivity of HIV-2, compared to HIV-1, implies that fewer of those exposed to HIV-2 will be infected per exposure. Due to its relatively poor capacity for transmission, HIV-2 is largely confined to West Africa.\n\nHIV is different in structure from other retroviruses. It is roughly spherical with a diameter of about 120 nm, around 60 times smaller than a red blood cell. It is composed of two copies of positive-sense single-stranded RNA that codes for the virus's nine genes enclosed by a conical capsid composed of 2,000 copies of the viral protein p24. The single-stranded RNA is tightly bound to nucleocapsid proteins, p7, and enzymes needed for the development of the virion such as reverse transcriptase, proteases, ribonuclease and integrase. A matrix composed of the viral protein p17 surrounds the capsid ensuring the integrity of the virion particle.\n\nThis is, in turn, surrounded by the viral envelope, that is composed of the lipid bilayer taken from the membrane of a human host cell when the newly formed virus particle buds from the cell. The viral envelope contains proteins from the host cell and relatively few copies of the HIV Envelope protein, which consists of a cap made of three molecules known as glycoprotein (gp) 120, and a stem consisting of three gp41 molecules that anchor the structure into the viral envelope. The Envelope protein, encoded by the HIV \"env\" gene, allows the virus to attach to target cells and fuse the viral envelope with the target cell's membrane releasing the viral contents into the cell and initiating the infectious cycle.\n\nAs the sole viral protein on the surface of the virus, the Envelope protein is a major target for HIV vaccine efforts. Over half of the mass of the trimeric envelope spike is N-linked glycans. The density is high as the glycans shield the underlying viral protein from neutralisation by antibodies. This is one of the most densely glycosylated molecules known and the density is sufficiently high to prevent the normal maturation process of glycans during biogenesis in the endoplasmic and Golgi apparatus. The majority of the glycans are therefore stalled as immature 'high-mannose' glycans not normally present on human glycoproteins that are secreted or present on a cell surface. The unusual processing and high density means that almost all broadly neutralising antibodies that have so far been identified (from a subset of patients that have been infected for many months to years) bind to or, are adapted to cope with, these envelope glycans.\n\nThe molecular structure of the viral spike has now been determined by X-ray crystallography and cryogenic electron microscopy. These advances in structural biology were made possible due to the development of stable recombinant forms of the viral spike by the introduction of an intersubunit disulphide bond and an isoleucine to proline mutation (radical replacement of an amino acid) in gp41. The so-called SOSIP trimers not only reproduce the antigenic properties of the native viral spike, but also display the same degree of immature glycans as presented on the native virus. Recombinant trimeric viral spikes are promising vaccine candidates as they display less non-neutralising epitopes than recombinant monomeric gp120, which act to suppress the immune response to target epitopes. \n\nThe RNA genome consists of at least seven structural landmarks (LTR, TAR, RRE, PE, SLIP, CRS, and INS), and nine genes (\"gag\", \"pol\", and \"env\", \"tat\", \"rev\", \"nef\", \"vif\", \"vpr\", \"vpu\", and sometimes a tenth \"tev\", which is a fusion of \"tat\", \"env\" and \"rev\"), encoding 19 proteins. Three of these genes, \"gag\", \"pol\", and \"env\", contain information needed to make the structural proteins for new virus particles. For example, \"env\" codes for a protein called gp160 that is cut in two by a cellular protease to form gp120 and gp41. The six remaining genes, \"tat\", \"rev\", \"nef\", \"vif\", \"vpr\", and \"vpu\" (or \"vpx\" in the case of HIV-2), are regulatory genes for proteins that control the ability of HIV to infect cells, produce new copies of virus (replicate), or cause disease.\n\nThe two \"tat\" proteins (p16 and p14) are transcriptional transactivators for the LTR promoter acting by binding the TAR RNA element. The TAR may also be processed into microRNAs that regulate the apoptosis genes \"ERCC1\" and \"IER3\". The \"rev\" protein (p19) is involved in shuttling RNAs from the nucleus and the cytoplasm by binding to the RRE RNA element. The \"vif\" protein (p23) prevents the action of APOBEC3G (a cellular protein that deaminates cytidine to uridine in the single-stranded viral DNA and/or interferes with reverse transcription). The \"vpr\" protein (p14) arrests cell division at G2/M. The \"nef\" protein (p27) down-regulates CD4 (the major viral receptor), as well as the MHC class I and class II molecules.\n\n\"Nef\" also interacts with SH3 domains. The \"vpu\" protein (p16) influences the release of new virus particles from infected cells. The ends of each strand of HIV RNA contain an RNA sequence called a long terminal repeat (LTR). Regions in the LTR act as switches to control production of new viruses and can be triggered by proteins from either HIV or the host cell. The Psi element is involved in viral genome packaging and recognized by \"gag\" and \"rev\" proteins. The SLIP element () is involved in the frameshift in the \"gag\"-\"pol\" reading frame required to make functional \"pol\".\n\nThe term viral tropism refers to the cell types a virus infects. HIV can infect a variety of immune cells such as CD4 T cells, macrophages, and microglial cells. HIV-1 entry to macrophages and CD4 T cells is mediated through interaction of the virion envelope glycoproteins (gp120) with the CD4 molecule on the target cells' membrane and also with chemokine co-receptors.\n\nMacrophage-tropic (M-tropic) strains of HIV-1, or non-syncytia-inducing strains (NSI; now called R5 viruses) use the \"β\"-chemokine receptor, CCR5, for entry and are thus able to replicate in both macrophages and CD4 T cells. This CCR5 co-receptor is used by almost all primary HIV-1 isolates regardless of viral genetic subtype. Indeed, macrophages play a key role in several critical aspects of HIV infection. They appear to be the first cells infected by HIV and perhaps the source of HIV production when CD4 cells become depleted in the patient. Macrophages and microglial cells are the cells infected by HIV in the central nervous system. In the tonsils and adenoids of HIV-infected patients, macrophages fuse into multinucleated giant cells that produce huge amounts of virus.\n\nT-tropic strains of HIV-1, or syncytia-inducing strains (SI; now called X4 viruses) replicate in primary CD4 T cells as well as in macrophages and use the \"α\"-chemokine receptor, CXCR4, for entry.\n\nDual-tropic HIV-1 strains are thought to be transitional strains of HIV-1 and thus are able to use both CCR5 and CXCR4 as co-receptors for viral entry.\n\nThe \"α\"-chemokine SDF-1, a ligand for CXCR4, suppresses replication of T-tropic HIV-1 isolates. It does this by down-regulating the expression of CXCR4 on the surface of HIV target cells. M-tropic HIV-1 isolates that use only the CCR5 receptor are termed R5; those that use only CXCR4 are termed X4, and those that use both, X4R5. However, the use of co-receptors alone does not explain viral tropism, as not all R5 viruses are able to use CCR5 on macrophages for a productive infection and HIV can also infect a subtype of myeloid dendritic cells, which probably constitute a reservoir that maintains infection when CD4 T cell numbers have declined to extremely low levels.\n\nSome people are resistant to certain strains of HIV. For example, people with the CCR5-Δ32 mutation are resistant to infection by the R5 virus, as the mutation leaves HIV unable to bind to this co-receptor, reducing its ability to infect target cells.\n\nSexual intercourse is the major mode of HIV transmission. Both X4 and R5 HIV are present in the seminal fluid, which enables the virus to be transmitted from a male to his sexual partner. The virions can then infect numerous cellular targets and disseminate into the whole organism. However, a selection process leads to a predominant transmission of the R5 virus through this pathway. In patients infected with subtype B HIV-1, there is often a co-receptor switch in late-stage disease and T-tropic variants that can infect a variety of T cells through CXCR4. These variants then replicate more aggressively with heightened virulence that causes rapid T cell depletion, immune system collapse, and opportunistic infections that mark the advent of AIDS. Thus, during the course of infection, viral adaptation to the use of CXCR4 instead of CCR5 may be a key step in the progression to AIDS. A number of studies with subtype B-infected individuals have determined that between 40 and 50 percent of AIDS patients can harbour viruses of the SI and, it is presumed, the X4 phenotypes.\n\nHIV-2 is much less pathogenic than HIV-1 and is restricted in its worldwide distribution to West Africa. The adoption of \"accessory genes\" by HIV-2 and its more promiscuous pattern of co-receptor usage (including CD4-independence) may assist the virus in its adaptation to avoid innate restriction factors present in host cells. Adaptation to use normal cellular machinery to enable transmission and productive infection has also aided the establishment of HIV-2 replication in humans. A survival strategy for any infectious agent is not to kill its host, but ultimately become a commensal organism. Having achieved a low pathogenicity, over time, variants that are more successful at transmission will be selected.\n\nThe HIV virion enters macrophages and CD4 T cells by the adsorption of glycoproteins on its surface to receptors on the target cell followed by fusion of the viral envelope with the target cell membrane and the release of the HIV capsid into the cell.\n\nEntry to the cell begins through interaction of the trimeric envelope complex (gp160 spike) on the HIV viral envelope and both CD4 and a chemokine co-receptor (generally either CCR5 or CXCR4, but others are known to interact) on the target cell surface. Gp120 binds to integrin αβ activating LFA-1, the central integrin involved in the establishment of virological synapses, which facilitate efficient cell-to-cell spreading of HIV-1. The gp160 spike contains binding domains for both CD4 and chemokine receptors.\n\nThe first step in fusion involves the high-affinity attachment of the CD4 binding domains of gp120 to CD4. Once gp120 is bound with the CD4 protein, the envelope complex undergoes a structural change, exposing the chemokine receptor binding domains of gp120 and allowing them to interact with the target chemokine receptor. This allows for a more stable two-pronged attachment, which allows the N-terminal fusion peptide gp41 to penetrate the cell membrane. Repeat sequences in gp41, HR1, and HR2 then interact, causing the collapse of the extracellular portion of gp41 into a hairpin shape. This loop structure brings the virus and cell membranes close together, allowing fusion of the membranes and subsequent entry of the viral capsid.\n\nAfter HIV has bound to the target cell, the HIV RNA and various enzymes, including reverse transcriptase, integrase, ribonuclease, and protease, are injected into the cell. During the microtubule-based transport to the nucleus, the viral single-strand RNA genome is transcribed into double-strand DNA, which is then integrated into a host chromosome.\n\nHIV can infect dendritic cells (DCs) by this CD4-CCR5 route, but another route using mannose-specific C-type lectin receptors such as DC-SIGN can also be used. DCs are one of the first cells encountered by the virus during sexual transmission. They are currently thought to play an important role by transmitting HIV to T cells when the virus is captured in the mucosa by DCs. The presence of FEZ-1, which occurs naturally in neurons, is believed to prevent the infection of cells by HIV.\nHIV-1 entry, as well as entry of many other retroviruses, has long been believed to occur exclusively at the plasma membrane. More recently, however, productive infection by pH-independent, clathrin-mediated endocytosis of HIV-1 has also been reported and was recently suggested to constitute the only route of productive entry.\n\nShortly after the viral capsid enters the cell, an enzyme called reverse transcriptase liberates the positive-sense single-stranded RNA genome from the attached viral proteins and copies it into a complementary DNA (cDNA) molecule. The process of reverse transcription is extremely error-prone, and the resulting mutations may cause drug resistance or allow the virus to evade the body's immune system. The reverse transcriptase also has ribonuclease activity that degrades the viral RNA during the synthesis of cDNA, as well as DNA-dependent DNA polymerase activity that creates a sense DNA from the \"antisense\" cDNA. Together, the cDNA and its complement form a double-stranded viral DNA that is then transported into the cell nucleus. The integration of the viral DNA into the host cell's genome is carried out by another viral enzyme called integrase.\n\nThe integrated viral DNA may then lie dormant, in the latent stage of HIV infection. To actively produce the virus, certain cellular transcription factors need to be present, the most important of which is NF-\"κ\"B (nuclear factor kappa B), which is upregulated when T cells become activated. This means that those cells most likely to be targeted, entered and subsequently killed by HIV are those actively fighting infection.\n\nDuring viral replication, the integrated DNA provirus is transcribed into RNA, some of which then undergo RNA splicing to produce mature messenger RNAs (mRNAs). These mRNAs are exported from the nucleus into the cytoplasm, where they are translated into the regulatory proteins Tat (which encourages new virus production) and Rev. As the newly produced Rev protein is produced it moves to the nucleus, where it binds to full-length, unspliced copies of virus RNAs and allows them to leave the nucleus. Some of these full-length RNAs function as new copies of the virus genome, while others function as mRNAs that are translated to produce the structural proteins Gag and Env. Gag proteins bind to copies of the virus RNA genome to package them into new virus particles.\n\nHIV-1 and HIV-2 appear to package their RNA differently. HIV-1 will bind to any appropriate RNA. HIV-2 will preferentially bind to the mRNA that was used to create the Gag protein itself.\n\nTwo RNA genomes are encapsidated in each HIV-1 particle (see Structure and genome of HIV). Upon infection and replication catalyzed by reverse transcriptase, recombination between the two genomes can occur. Recombination occurs as the single-strand, positive-sense RNA genomes are reverse transcribed to form DNA. During reverse transcription, the nascent DNA can switch multiple times between the two copies of the viral RNA. This form of recombination is known as copy-choice. Recombination events may occur throughout the genome. Anywhere from two to 20 recombination events per genome may occur at each replication cycle, and these events can rapidly shuffle the genetic information that is transmitted from parental to progeny genomes.\n\nViral recombination produces genetic variation that likely contributes to the evolution of resistance to anti-retroviral therapy. Recombination may also contribute, in principle, to overcoming the immune defenses of the host. Yet, for the adaptive advantages of genetic variation to be realized, the two viral genomes packaged in individual infecting virus particles need to have arisen from separate progenitor parental viruses of differing genetic constitution. It is unknown how often such mixed packaging occurs under natural conditions.\n\nBonhoeffer \"et al.\" suggested that template switching by reverse transcriptase acts as a repair process to deal with breaks in the single-stranded RNA genome. In addition, Hu and Temin suggested that recombination is an adaptation for repair of damage in the RNA genomes. Strand switching (copy-choice recombination) by reverse transcriptase could generate an undamaged copy of genomic DNA from two damaged single-stranded RNA genome copies. This view of the adaptive benefit of recombination in HIV could explain why each HIV particle contains two complete genomes, rather than one. Furthermore, the view that recombination is a repair process implies that the benefit of repair can occur at each replication cycle, and that this benefit can be realized whether or not the two genomes differ genetically. On the view that recombination in HIV is a repair process, the generation of recombinational variation would be a consequence, but not the cause of, the evolution of template switching.\n\nHIV-1 infection causes chronic inflammation and production of reactive oxygen species. Thus, the HIV genome may be vulnerable to oxidative damages, including breaks in the single-stranded RNA. For HIV, as well as for viruses in general, successful infection depends on overcoming host defensive strategies that often include production of genome-damaging reactive oxygen species. Thus, Michod \"et al.\" suggested that recombination by viruses is an adaptation for repair of genome damages, and that recombinational variation is a byproduct that may provide a separate benefit.\n\nThe final step of the viral cycle, assembly of new HIV-1 virions, begins at the plasma membrane of the host cell. The Env polyprotein (gp160) goes through the endoplasmic reticulum and is transported to the Golgi apparatus where it is cleaved by furin resulting in the two HIV envelope glycoproteins, gp41 and gp120. These are transported to the plasma membrane of the host cell where gp41 anchors gp120 to the membrane of the infected cell. The Gag (p55) and Gag-Pol (p160) polyproteins also associate with the inner surface of the plasma membrane along with the HIV genomic RNA as the forming virion begins to bud from the host cell. The budded virion is still immature as the gag polyproteins still need to be cleaved into the actual matrix, capsid and nucleocapsid proteins. This cleavage is mediated by the packaged viral protease and can be inhibited by antiretroviral drugs of the protease inhibitor class. The various structural components then assemble to produce a mature HIV virion. Only mature virions are then able to infect another cell.\n\nThe classical process of infection of a cell by a virion can be called \"cell-free spread\" to distinguish it from a more recently recognized process called \"cell-to-cell spread\". In cell-free spread (see figure), virus particles bud from an infected T cell, enter the blood or extracellular fluid and then infect another T cell following a chance encounter. HIV can also disseminate by direct transmission from one cell to another by a process of cell-to-cell spread, for which two pathways have been described. Firstly, an infected T cell can transmit virus directly to a target T cell via a virological synapse. Secondly, an antigen-presenting cell (APC), such as a macrophage or dendritic cell, can transmit HIV to T cells by a process that either involves productive infection (in the case of macrophages) or capture and transfer of virions \"in trans\" (in the case of dendritic cells). Whichever pathway is used, infection by cell-to-cell transfer is reported to be much more efficient than cell-free virus spread. A number of factors contribute to this increased efficiency, including polarised virus budding towards the site of cell-to-cell contact, close apposition of cells, which minimizes fluid-phase diffusion of virions, and clustering of HIV entry receptors on the target cell towards the contact zone. Cell-to-cell spread is thought to be particularly important in lymphoid tissues where CD4 T cells are densely packed and likely to interact frequently. Intravital imaging studies have supported the concept of the HIV virological synapse \"in vivo\". The many spreading mechanisms available to HIV contribute to the virus' ongoing replication in spite of anti-retroviral therapies.\n\nHIV differs from many viruses in that it has very high genetic variability. This diversity is a result of its fast replication cycle, with the generation of about 10 virions every day, coupled with a high mutation rate of approximately 3 x 10 per nucleotide base per cycle of replication and recombinogenic properties of reverse transcriptase.\n\nThis complex scenario leads to the generation of many variants of HIV in a single infected patient in the course of one day. This variability is compounded when a single cell is simultaneously infected by two or more different strains of HIV. When simultaneous infection occurs, the genome of progeny virions may be composed of RNA strands from two different strains. This hybrid virion then infects a new cell where it undergoes replication. As this happens, the reverse transcriptase, by jumping back and forth between the two different RNA templates, will generate a newly synthesized retroviral DNA sequence that is a recombinant between the two parental genomes. This recombination is most obvious when it occurs between subtypes.\n\nThe closely related simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) has evolved into many strains, classified by the natural host species. SIV strains of the African green monkey (SIVagm) and sooty mangabey (SIVsmm) are thought to have a long evolutionary history with their hosts. These hosts have adapted to the presence of the virus, which is present at high levels in the host's blood, but evokes only a mild immune response, does not cause the development of simian AIDS, and does not undergo the extensive mutation and recombination typical of HIV infection in humans.\n\nIn contrast, when these strains infect species that have not adapted to SIV (\"heterologous\" or similar hosts such as rhesus or cynomologus macaques), the animals develop AIDS and the virus generates genetic diversity similar to what is seen in human HIV infection. Chimpanzee SIV (SIVcpz), the closest genetic relative of HIV-1, is associated with increased mortality and AIDS-like symptoms in its natural host. SIVcpz appears to have been transmitted relatively recently to chimpanzee and human populations, so their hosts have not yet adapted to the virus. This virus has also lost a function of the \"nef\" gene that is present in most SIVs. For non-pathogenic SIV variants, \"nef\" suppresses T cell activation through the CD3 marker. \"Nef\"'s function in non-pathogenic forms of SIV is to downregulate expression of inflammatory cytokines, MHC-1, and signals that affect T cell trafficking. In HIV-1 and SIVcpz, \"nef\" does not inhibit T-cell activation and it has lost this function. Without this function, T cell depletion is more likely, leading to immunodeficiency.\n\nThree groups of HIV-1 have been identified on the basis of differences in the envelope (\"env\") region: M, N, and O. Group M is the most prevalent and is subdivided into eight subtypes (or clades), based on the whole genome, which are geographically distinct. The most prevalent are subtypes B (found mainly in North America and Europe), A and D (found mainly in Africa), and C (found mainly in Africa and Asia); these subtypes form branches in the phylogenetic tree representing the lineage of the M group of HIV-1. Co-infection with distinct subtypes gives rise to circulating recombinant forms (CRFs). In 2000, the last year in which an analysis of global subtype prevalence was made, 47.2% of infections worldwide were of subtype C, 26.7% were of subtype A/CRF02_AG, 12.3% were of subtype B, 5.3% were of subtype D, 3.2% were of CRF_AE, and the remaining 5.3% were composed of other subtypes and CRFs. Most HIV-1 research is focused on subtype B; few laboratories focus on the other subtypes. The existence of a fourth group, \"P\", has been hypothesised based on a virus isolated in 2009. The strain is apparently derived from gorilla SIV (SIVgor), first isolated from western lowland gorillas in 2006.\n\nHIV-2's closest relative is SIVsm, a strain of SIV found in sooty mangabees. Since HIV-1 is derived from SIVcpz, and HIV-2 from SIVsm, the genetic sequence of HIV-2 is only partially homologous to HIV-1 and more closely resembles that of SIVsm.\n\nMany HIV-positive people are unaware that they are infected with the virus. For example, in 2001 less than 1% of the sexually active urban population in Africa had been tested, and this proportion is even lower in rural populations. Furthermore, in 2001 only 0.5% of pregnant women attending urban health facilities were counselled, tested or receive their test results. Again, this proportion is even lower in rural health facilities. Since donors may therefore be unaware of their infection, donor blood and blood products used in medicine and medical research are routinely screened for HIV.\n\nHIV-1 testing is initially done using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to detect antibodies to HIV-1. Specimens with a non-reactive result from the initial ELISA are considered HIV-negative, unless new exposure to an infected partner or partner of unknown HIV status has occurred. Specimens with a reactive ELISA result are retested in duplicate. If the result of either duplicate test is reactive, the specimen is reported as repeatedly reactive and undergoes confirmatory testing with a more specific supplemental test (e.g., a polymerase chain reaction (PCR), western blot or, less commonly, an immunofluorescence assay (IFA)). Only specimens that are repeatedly reactive by ELISA and positive by IFA or PCR or reactive by western blot are considered HIV-positive and indicative of HIV infection. Specimens that are repeatedly ELISA-reactive occasionally provide an indeterminate western blot result, which may be either an incomplete antibody response to HIV in an infected person or nonspecific reactions in an uninfected person.\n\nAlthough IFA can be used to confirm infection in these ambiguous cases, this assay is not widely used. In general, a second specimen should be collected more than a month later and retested for persons with indeterminate western blot results. Although much less commonly available, nucleic acid testing (e.g., viral RNA or proviral DNA amplification method) can also help diagnosis in certain situations. In addition, a few tested specimens might provide inconclusive results because of a low quantity specimen. In these situations, a second specimen is collected and tested for HIV infection.\n\nModern HIV testing is extremely accurate, when the window period is taken into consideration. A single screening test is correct more than 99% of the time. The chance of a false-positive result in a standard two-step testing protocol is estimated to be about 1 in 250,000 in a low risk population. Testing post-exposure is recommended immediately and then at six weeks, three months, and six months.\n\nThe latest recommendations of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) show that HIV testing must start with an immunoassay combination test for HIV-1 and HIV-2 antibodies and p24 antigen. A negative result rules out HIV exposure, while a positive one must be followed by an HIV-1/2 antibody differentiation immunoassay to detect which antibodies are present. This gives rise to four possible scenarios:\n\nHIV/AIDS research includes all medical research that attempts to prevent, treat, or cure HIV/AIDS, as well as fundamental research about the nature of HIV as an infectious agent and AIDS as the disease caused by HIV.\n\nMany governments and research institutions participate in HIV/AIDS research. This research includes behavioral health interventions, such as research into sex education, and drug development, such as research into microbicides for sexually transmitted diseases, HIV vaccines, and anti-retroviral drugs. Other medical research areas include the topics of pre-exposure prophylaxis, post-exposure prophylaxis, circumcision and HIV, and accelerated aging effects.\n\nHIV latency, and the consequent viral reservoir in CD4 T cells, dendritic cells, as well as macrophages, is the main barrier to eradication of the virus.\n\nIt is important to note that although HIV is highly virulent, transmission is greatly reduced when an HIV-infected person has a suppressed or undetectable viral load (<50 copies/ml) due to prolonged and successful anti-retroviral treatment. Hence, it can be said to be almost impossible (but still non-zero) for an HIV-infected person who has an undetectable viral load to transmit the virus, even during unprotected sexual intercourse, as there would be a negligible amount of HIV present in the seminal fluid, vaginal secretions or blood, for transmission to occur. This does not mean, however, that prolonged anti-retroviral treatment will result in a suppressed viral load. An undetectable viral load, generally agreed as less than 50 copies per milliliter of blood, can only be proven by a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test.\n\nAt the same time, it is important to recognise that reaching an undetectable viral load is determined by many factors, including treatment adherence, HIV resistance to certain anti-retroviral drugs, stigma, and inadequate health systems.\n\nAIDS was first clinically observed in 1981 in the United States. The initial cases were a cluster of injection drug users and gay men with no known cause of impaired immunity who showed symptoms of \"Pneumocystis jirovecii\" pneumonia (PJP), a rare opportunistic infection that was known to occur in people with very compromised immune systems. Soon thereafter, additional gay men developed a previously rare skin cancer called Kaposi's sarcoma (KS). Many more cases of PJP and KS emerged, alerting U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and a CDC task force was formed to monitor the outbreak. The earliest retrospectively described case of AIDS is believed to have been in Norway beginning in 1966.\n\nIn the beginning, the CDC did not have an official name for the disease, often referring to it by way of the diseases that were associated with it, for example, lymphadenopathy, the disease after which the discoverers of HIV originally named the virus. They also used \"Kaposi's Sarcoma and Opportunistic Infections\", the name by which a task force had been set up in 1981. In the general press, the term \"GRID\", which stood for gay-related immune deficiency, had been coined. The CDC, in search of a name, and looking at the infected communities coined \"the 4H disease\", as it seemed to single out homosexuals, heroin users, hemophiliacs, and Haitians. However, after determining that AIDS was not isolated to the gay community, it was realized that the term GRID was misleading and \"AIDS\" was introduced at a meeting in July 1982. By September 1982 the CDC started using the name AIDS.\nIn 1983, two separate research groups led by American Robert Gallo and French investigators Françoise Barré-Sinoussi and Luc Montagnier independently declared that a novel retrovirus may have been infecting AIDS patients, and published their findings in the same issue of the journal \"Science\". Gallo claimed that a virus his group had isolated from a person with AIDS was strikingly similar in shape to other human T-lymphotropic viruses (HTLVs) his group had been the first to isolate. Gallo's group called their newly isolated virus HTLV-III. At the same time, Montagnier's group isolated a virus from a patient presenting with swelling of the lymph nodes of the neck and physical weakness, two classic symptoms of primary HIV infection. Contradicting the report from Gallo's group, Montagnier and his colleagues showed that core proteins of this virus were immunologically different from those of HTLV-I. Montagnier's group named their isolated virus lymphadenopathy-associated virus (LAV). As these two viruses turned out to be the same, in 1986 LAV and HTLV-III were renamed HIV.\n\nAnother group working contemporaneously with the Montagnier and Gallo groups was that of Dr. Jay Levy at the University of California, San Francisco. He independently discovered the AIDS virus in 1983 and named it the AIDS associated retrovirus (ARV). This virus was very different from the virus reported by the Montagnier and Gallo groups. The ARV strains indicated, for the first time, the heterogeneity of HIV isolates and several of these remain classic examples of the AIDS virus found in the United States.\n\nBoth HIV-1 and HIV-2 are believed to have originated in non-human primates in West-central Africa, and are believed to have transferred to humans (a process known as zoonosis) in the early 20th century.\n\nHIV-1 appears to have originated in southern Cameroon through the evolution of SIVcpz, a simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) that infects wild chimpanzees (HIV-1 descends from the SIVcpz endemic in the chimpanzee subspecies \"Pan troglodytes troglodytes\"). The closest relative of HIV-2 is SIVsmm, a virus of the sooty mangabey (\"Cercocebus atys atys\"), an Old World monkey living in littoral West Africa (from southern Senegal to western Côte d'Ivoire). New World monkeys such as the owl monkey are resistant to HIV-1 infection, possibly because of a genomic fusion of two viral resistance genes.\n\nHIV-1 is thought to have jumped the species barrier on at least three separate occasions, giving rise to the three groups of the virus, M, N, and O.\nThere is evidence that humans who participate in bushmeat activities, either as hunters or as bushmeat vendors, commonly acquire SIV. However, SIV is a weak virus, and it is typically suppressed by the human immune system within weeks of infection. It is thought that several transmissions of the virus from individual to individual in quick succession are necessary to allow it enough time to mutate into HIV. Furthermore, due to its relatively low person-to-person transmission rate, it can only spread throughout the population in the presence of one or more high-risk transmission channels, which are thought to have been absent in Africa prior to the 20th century.\n\nSpecific proposed high-risk transmission channels, allowing the virus to adapt to humans and spread throughout the society, depend on the proposed timing of the animal-to-human crossing. Genetic studies of the virus suggest that the most recent common ancestor of the HIV-1 M group dates back to circa 1910. Proponents of this dating link the HIV epidemic with the emergence of colonialism and growth of large colonial African cities, leading to social changes, including different patterns of sexual contact (especially multiple, concurrent partnerships), the spread of prostitution, and the concomitant high frequency of genital ulcer diseases (such as syphilis) in nascent colonial cities. While transmission rates of HIV during vaginal intercourse are typically low, they are increased manyfold if one of the partners suffers from a sexually transmitted infection resulting in genital ulcers. Early 1900s colonial cities were notable due to their high prevalence of prostitution and genital ulcers to the degree that as of 1928 as many as 45% of female residents of eastern Leopoldville were thought to have been prostitutes and as of 1933 around 15% of all residents of the same city were infected by one of the forms of syphilis.\n\nAn alternative view—unsupported by evidence—holds that unsafe medical practices in Africa during years following World War II, such as unsterile reuse of single-use syringes during mass vaccination, antibiotic, and anti-malaria treatment campaigns, were the initial vector that allowed the virus to adapt to humans and spread.\n\nThe earliest, well-documented case of HIV in a human dates back to 1959 in the Belgian Congo. The virus may have been present in the United States as early as the mid-to-late 1950s, as a sixteen-year-old male presented with symptoms in 1966 and died in 1969.\n\n\n\n"}

In 1917, Eaton conceived the \"memorial-park\" concept and Forest Lawn Cemetery was renamed Forest Lawn Memorial-Park. He envisioned Forest Lawn as a place for the living, having sweeping lawns and noble architecture, stained glass, and a place that uplifted the community rather than being a place of sorrow. Eaton became noted as, and referred to himself as, \"The Builder\" of Forest Lawn Glendale. During his life, he supervised the opening of Hollywood Hills, Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cypress, and Forest Lawn Memorial Park Covina Hills in the greater Los Angeles, California area which became the funeral and/or interment locations for many movie stars and other celebrities. With several beautiful chapels throughout the Glendale cemetery's park-like setting, it has also served as the wedding location for well-known celebrities, including U.S. President Ronald Reagan and his first wife, actress Jane Wyman.\n\nEaton's international connections enabled him to attract an incredible number of important art works to his memorial parks. He was well-known around the world as a collector and was respected at the highest levels of many governments.\n\nUpon his death in 1966, Eaton was entombed in the \"Memorial Court of Honor\" in the Great Mausoleum in his Glendale cemetery.

Some humanist celebrants are accredited by humanist organisations, such as Humanists UK, Humanist Society Scotland (HSS), and the Humanist Association of Canada (HAC).\n\nHumanist ceremonies are conducted in every part of the world by humanist organisations, although the legal status of non-religious ceremonies of different kinds varies from place to place. In general, funeral ceremonies are not typically regulated by states, but many countries with a religious history have stricter guidelines on who can perform legal marriages. Naming ceremonies, similarly, can be held anywhere without legal implications. In countries where legal marriages can only be performed by religious institutions or the state (such as England), humanist weddings are often performed before or after a civil legal proceeding, but presented as the more meaningful or significant of the two events.\n\nAs of 2018, humanist celebrants can conduct legally binding marriage ceremonies in Scotland, Ireland, Northern Ireland, Norway, Iceland, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Canada and the United States. The British island of Jersey legalised humanist marriages in 2018, but the civil service has yet to authorise any celebrants.\n\nThe charity Humanists UK (formerly the British Humanist Association) pioneered the practice of offering humanist ceremonies, and today organises a network of celebrants or officiants across England, Wales and Northern Ireland. A similar network exists in Scotland, where, following a June 2005 ruling by the Registrar General, celebrants belonging to Humanist Society Scotland have been permitted to conduct legal wedding ceremonies. Humanists UK celebrants in Northern Ireland were given the same rights in 2017 following a court case supported by Humanists UK. \n\nIn England and Wales the current legal position is that a humanist wedding or partnership ceremony must be supplemented by obtaining a civil marriage or partnership certificate through a Register Office. In December 2014 it was reported that the Prime Minister's Office was blocking the implementation of a change to give legal force to humanist weddings in England and Wales. That same year in Scotland, when same-sex marriage was legalised, the First Minister of Scotland attended the legal humanist marriage of a same-sex couple. In 2015, humanist weddings became more popular in Scotland than Church of Scotland weddings, or those of any religious denomination. Humanist Society Scotland's status as a trusted provider of marriages was written into Scots law in February 2017.\n\nNon-religious funerals are legal within the UK. Humanist celebrants are familiar with the procedures of cremation and burial, and are trained and experienced in devising and conducting suitable ceremonies. The British Humanist Association has in the past described officiants as follows:Officiants are generally at least 35 years old, have experience of public speaking, and have probably had paid or voluntary experience in a caring/supporting profession – such as nursing, teaching, police or social work, for example. They must be able to cope with the emotional burden of regularly meeting and working with bereaved people - often in relation to particularly difficult or unexpected deaths, such as the death of a child in a road accident. Funeral directors are able to make arrangements with trained officiants in their local area.\n\nHumanist funerals have reportedly been held in recent years for Claire Rayner, Keith Floyd, Linda Smith, Ronnie Barker, and Lynsey de Paul, among others. The humanist funeral for former First Minister of Wales Rhodri Morgan in 2017 was the first national funeral in the United Kingdom to be led by a humanist celebrant, former AM Lorraine Barrett, as well as the first national funeral held in Wales.\n\nCelebrants also undertake humanist baby namings as a non-religious alternative to ceremonies such as christenings. The purpose is to recognise and celebrate the arrival of a child, and welcome him or her in the family and circle of friends.\n\nIn Ireland, the Humanist Association of Ireland manages its own network of humanist ceremonies. Since 2012, these have been legally recognised, as in Scotland. In 2015, humanist marriages accounted for 6% of all marriages in Ireland, making them six times more popular than the Church of Ireland's weddings.\n\nLaws in each state of the United States vary about who has the right to perform wedding services, but humanist celebrants are usually categorized as \"clergy\" and have the same rights and responsibilities as ordained clergy. Humanist celebrants will perform both opposite-sex and same-sex marriage ceremonies. The Humanist Society, an adjunct of the American Humanist Association, maintains a list of humanist celebrants.\n\nHumanists conduct wedding ceremonies across Canada. These typically happen under the auspices of the national Humanist Canada group or through one of the province-level groups such as the British Columbia Humanist Association.\n\nHumanist weddings, funerals, and naming ceremonies are popular throughout Scandinavia, where humanist groups tend to be well-established. Humanist coming of age ceremonies are also popular in thesee countries, and in particular Norway, where humanists also conduct legally binding weddings. In Norway, coming of age ceremonies are a cultural norm dating back to when it was a legal requirement for young people to have a church-led confirmation ceremony. In an increasingly secular population, many Norwegians turn to the Norwegian Humanist Association (NHA) instead for a 'confirmation' that reflects their values. In 2017, 11,000 Norwegian young people registered for their ceremony with the NHA, representing nearly one in five young Norwegians.\n\nHumanist groups providing ceremonies as part of Humanistischer Verband Deutschlands are well-established across Germany and are particularly prominent in many of Germany's cities, where majorities of residents are non-religious. As in Scandinavia, humanist coming-of-age ceremonies are very popular, due to secularisation and a pre-existing tradition of religious confirmation. \"Jugendweihe\" ceremonies have been on offer since at least 1852, although these days they are more likely to be referred to as \"Jugendfeier\" (youth celebration, as opposed to youth ordination). 8,500 young Germans took part in these ceremonies in 2015.\n\n\n"}

A typical incentive trust might encourage a beneficiary to complete a degree, enter a profession, or abstain from harmful conduct such as substance abuse. The beneficiary might be paid a certain amount of money from the trust upon graduating from college, or the trust might pay a dollar of income from the trust for every dollar the beneficiary earns.\n\nAlthough incentive trusts have apparently become more common in the early 21st century, a 2007 survey found that less than one-third of wealthy Americans attach conditions to the distribution of their estates. According to Joshua Tate, an assistant professor at SMU Dedman School of Law, incentive trusts pose a problem of inflexibility: \"because the settlor cannot foresee all potential eventualities or circumstances and take them into account in the trust, the terms of the trust can prove to be a burden for the beneficiaries.\" Eileen Gallo, a noted psychotherapist, has argued that, although incentive trusts may be effective in changing behavior, they may in fact be damaging to the beneficiaries, in that they rely on external motivation to encourage activities that should be autotelic in nature. The seeming popularity of incentive trusts, however, is reflected in the many websites created by estate planners to market them.\n\n"}

It has been successfully used to describe the response characteristics of neurons in early sensory pathways, especially the visual system. The LNP model is generally implicit when using reverse correlation or the spike-triggered average to characterize neural responses with white-noise stimuli.\nThere are three stages of the LNP cascade model. The first stage consists of a linear filter, or linear receptive field, which describes how the neuron integrates stimulus intensity over space and time. The output of this filter then passes through a nonlinear function, which gives the neuron's instantaneous spike rate as its output. Finally, the spike rate is used to generate spikes according to an inhomogeneous Poisson process.\n\nThe linear filtering stage performs dimensionality reduction, reducing the high-dimensional spatio-temporal stimulus space to a low-dimensional feature space, within which the neuron computes its response. The nonlinearity converts the filter output to a (non-negative) spike rate, and accounts for nonlinear phenomena such as spike threshold (or rectification) and response saturation. The Poisson spike generator converts the continuous spike rate to a series of spike times, under the assumption that the probability of a spike depends only on the instantaneous spike rate.\n\nLet formula_1 denote the spatio-temporal stimulus vector at a particular instant, and\nformula_2 denote a linear filter (the neuron's linear receptive field), which is a vector with the same number of elements as formula_1. Let formula_4 denote the nonlinearity, a scalar function with non-negative output. Then the LNP model specifies that, in the limit of small time bins, \nFor finite-sized time bins, this can be stated precisely as the probability of observing \"y\" spikes in a single bin: \n\nFor neurons sensitive to multiple dimensions of the stimulus space, the linear stage of the LNP model can be generalized to a bank of linear filters, and the nonlinearity becomes a function of multiple inputs. Let formula_9 denote the set of linear filters that capture a neuron's stimulus dependence. Then the multi-filter LNP model is described by\nor\nwhere formula_12 is a matrix whose columns are the filters formula_13.\n\nThe parameters of the LNP model consist of the linear filters formula_14 and the nonlinearity formula_4. The estimation problem (also known as the problem of \"neural characterization\") is the problem of determining these parameters from data consisting of a time-varying stimulus and the set of observed spike times. Techniques for estimating the LNP model parameters include:\n\n\n"}

During the war, 25 Canadian soldiers were executed for purely military offences. Excluding the two who were found guilty of murder, Veteran Affairs Minister Ron Duhamel announced on December 11, 2001 that executed soldiers would have their names added to Canada's Books of Remembrance housed in Parliament Hill.\n\nOn 16 August 2006, British Defence Secretary Des Browne announced that the government would issue full pardons for all 306 Commonwealth soldiers (including the twenty-three Canadians) who were executed under these circumstances during World War I.\n\nWilliam Alexander was born in the UK during 1880, and served for 8 years in the British Army before emigrating to Canada. When the First World War started in August 1914, Alexander volunteered for service in the Canadian Army. Given his previous military service, Alexander was made a Sergeant in the 10th Battalion. After arriving in France during 1915, Sergeant Alexander fought with the battalion at the 2nd Battle of Ypres (April 1915), Festubert (May 1915) and Mount Sorrel (1916).\n\nFollowing his recovery from an inflamed knee, Alexander rejoined his battalion in time for its involvement in the attack on Hill 70, which started at 04:25 on 15 August 1917. This attack was intended to act as a diversion and draw some of the German forces from the ongoing battles at Passchendaele. Because of the severe casualties suffered by the 10th Battalion, CQMS Alexander was ordered forward to take over as Platoon Sergeant of D Company; in readiness for this platoon to take part in a further attack. However, Alexander was nowhere to be found and a Corporal had to lead the Company.\n\nTwo days later, on 17 August 1917, the 10th Battalion was pulled out of the front line. It had suffered some 400 casualties.\n\nIt was not until 19 August 1917 that CQMS Alexander was found in the village used by the 10th Battalion as a billet before the attack on Hill 70. After admitting that he had gone sick, but not reported it to an officer, and the absence of any marks on his person, Alexander was arrested and charged with desertion.\n\nFollowing his trial on 29 September 1917, Alexander (age 37) was executed by firing squad on 18 October 1917. His remains are located in Barlin Communal Cemetery Extension (Pas de Calais), Plot II, Row D, Grave 43.\n\nAn account of Alexander's execution was written by Canon Frederick Scott in his book \"The Great War as I Saw It\". (Although Canon Scott does not name Alexander, the date of this execution, October 1917 and Scott's mention that the condemned soldier had no next of kin makes Alexander, rather than Private Thomas L. Moles, the subject.)\n\nAlexander is listed in the Canadian Book of Remembrance on page 603.\n\nBorn in Cleveland, Ohio on 25 April 1890, Frederick Stanley Arnold initially served in the US Army before enlisting in the Canadian Field Artillery in September 1914.\n\nOnce stationed in France, Arnold fought at the Battle of Festubert and the Battle of Givenchy, twice being admitted to hospital, once for simple illness, and then to be treated for shell shock. After his discharge, Arnold disappeared on 5 June 1916, and was arrested at a nearby port dressed in civilian clothes. He was court-martialled on 5 July 1916, and executed at 04:37 on 25 July 1916. He is buried in Boulogne Eastern Cemetery, Plot VIII, Row A, Grave 137.\n\nBorn in Montreal in December 1890, Fortunat Auger joined the CEF's 14th Battalion in September 1914.\n\nAuger was present during both the Second Battle of Ypres and the Battle of Festubert in 1915. After the 14th Battalion was transferred Following his battalion's move to Ploegsteert Wood that summer, Auger's conduct became increasingly belligerent.\n\nHe was twice charged with going AWOL, before disappearing for two days in December and returning to find himself charged with desertion. His charge was lessened to AWOL once again, but he was sentenced to serve 12 months hard labour. His sentence was suspended a month later, and he was returned to his battalion, from which he immediately left. He was arrested three days later, on January 11, and sentenced to death for desertion.\n\nThe 25-year-old Private was executed by firing squad at 05:43 on 26 March 1916, and his remains were buried in Trois Arbres Cemetery, Plot III, Row H, Grave 5.\n\nBorn on 26 March 1894 in Toronto, Ontario, Harold George Carter enlisted in the 59th Battalion in March 1915. In January 1916, he was charged with going AWOL.\n\nThe Battalion was disbanded upon reaching England at the end of 1916, and its troops were used to re-man other units who had taken high casualty rates during the war. Carter was transferred to the 73rd Battalion, part of the 4th Canadian Division.\n\nHe was again found AWOL, during the September Battle of Flers-Courcelette, and was found guilty of desertion and sentenced to death. His sentence was commuted to 10 years' imprisonment. After serving six months, his sentence was suspended, and he was re-attached to his unit on March 16, 1917.\n\nWithin three weeks, Carter once again went AWOL, this time just before the Battle of Vimy Ridge, eluding military police for five days before being re-captured.

Comte travelled with the battalion to France, but was transferred to the 22nd Battalion (aka \"Van Doo\", then part of the 5th Canadian Brigade CEF) because of their recent loss of infantry.\n\nPrivate Comté went missing just before the attack on Vimy Ridge began, on April 4, 1917, as the 22nd began moving to the front lines through Gouy-Servins. He was found in Le Havre on 18 May, and a court martial sentenced him to death for desertion.\n\nAt 04:45 on 3 July 1917, Comté was executed by firing squad. His remains are now located in Aix-Noulette Communal Cemetery Extension, Plot I, Row F, Grave 20.\n\nArthur Charles Dagesse was born in New Bedford MA in 1886. On 23 September 1914, one month after the outbreak of war, Dagesse enlisted in the Canadian Expeditionary Force (CEF) under the name Dagasse. His conduct as a soldier started badly and continued in poor fashion, with no fewer than fifteen convictions, thirteen for absence and two for drunkenness.\n\nOn 4 April 1917, just before his unit's participation in the Vimy Ridge attack, Dagesse went absent until his arrest in Paris on 29 April 1917. While awaiting trial for this offence, Dagesse escaped custody and remained absent for five months before being re-arrested in Paris on 4 October 1917. When he was arrested for the second time, Dagesse was wearing the uniform of a Sergeant in the Royal Army Medical Corps (RAMC).\n\nFollowing his court-martial on 26 February 1918, Dagasse was found guilty of two counts of desertion and sentenced to death.\n\nAt 06:37 on 15 March 1918, Dagesse (aged 33) was executed by firing squad. His remains are now located in Lapugnoy Military Cemetery, Plot VIII, Row B, Grave 8.\n\nLéopold Delisle was born in Montreal in 1893. Following the outbreak of war, Delisle tried to enlist three times before he was finally accepted for overseas service in April 1915. One month later, Delisle sailed with the 22nd (French-Canadian) Battalion.\n\nDelisle had a number of offences on his conduct sheet.\n\nOn 29 March 1918 Delisle's unit was ordered forward to attempt to stem the German advance on Arras, but when the roll call was made, Delisle was absent. Delisle was arrested just outside Arras five days later. Delisle's court-martial found him guilty of desertion and sentenced him to be shot dead.\n\nAt 04:24 on 21 May 1918, Delisle (aged 25) was executed by firing squad. His remains are now located in Bellacourt Military Cemetery, Plot II, Row J, Grave 6.\n\nEdward Fairburn was born in St. Catharines, Ontario on 21 September 1895. After enlisting in November 1915, Fairburn was sent to France as part of a reinforcement for the 18th (Western Ontario) Battalion.\n\nAfter a period of service, Fairburn went missing during the week of 9–16 April 1917 and remained missing for 10 months before being arrested just north of Arras.\n\nOn 2 March 1918, Fairburn (aged 23) was executed by firing squad. His remains are now located in Villers Station Cemetery, Plot XI, Row B, Grave 23, 11 kilometres northwest of Arras.\n\nStephen McDermott Fowles was born on 13 June 1897 in Winnipeg. In February 1916 Fowles enlisted in the 107th Battalion, which sailed for England in September 1916. Fowles was later sent to France as part of a reinforcement of the 44th Canadian Infantry Battalion.\n\nWithin a year of his enlistment, Fowles was court-martialled for desertion and found guilty. His sentence of death was reduced during the confirmation process to 10 years' imprisonment, which was itself later reduced to a suspended sentence and Fowles was returned to his unit.\n\nDespite these events, Fowles deserted and on 29 December 1917 was again sentenced to death. For a second time, the sentence was commuted to a suspended sentence. Given the need to combat the German offensive, Fowles was returned to his unit.\n\nShortly after rejoining his unit, Fowles deserted for a 3rd time and was not detained until he turned himself in on 2 May 1918. Fowles was court-martialled for desertion, found guilty and sentenced to death. At 03:50 on 19 June 1918, Fowles was executed by firing squad. His remains are now located in Villers Station Cemetery, Plot XIII, Row B, Grave 1.\n\nJohn Maurice Higgins was born on 26 September 1891 in Charlottetown, before moving with his parents to Toronto.\n\nAfter enlisting in the 87th Battalion in Montreal, Higgins sailed with the battalion to England during April 1916.\n\nPrivate Higgins took part in the heavy fighting at Mount Sorrel and went with his unit into the fighting at Courcelette in September 1916. During this battle, Higgins went absent, and was arrested by French Police 16 days later. This time, Private Higgins was charged with desertion.\n\nHiggins escaped from custody while awaiting his court-martial and was rearrested until five days later. After his court-martial, Higgins was found guilty of both counts of desertion and sentenced to death by firing squad.\n\nAt 07:11 on 7 December 1916, Higgins was executed by firing squad. His remains are now located in Quatre-Vents Cemetery, Plot I, Row B, Grave 2.\n\nHenry Hesey Kerr was born in Montreal on 4 September 1891.\n\nAfter his battalion had arrived in England, Kerr was punished for five periods of AWOL on 10 June 1915, 27 November 1915, 3 December 1915, 17 June 1916 and 3 January 1916, bring fined two days pay for each offence.\n\nAfter entering France and joining the 7th (British Columbia) Battalion, Kerr's conduct continued to decline. After several more warnings about his conduct, Kerr rejoined his unit in October 1916 as it prepared to attack Regina Trench as part of the Somme Offensive. \n\nHowever, Kerr went absent after being warned he was required for duty in the front line. 24 hours later, Kerr was arrested when he was discovered in some billets located some miles behind the front lines.\n\nOn 7 November 1916, Kerr was charged with desertion. His court-martial found him guilty and sentenced him to death. At 06:45 on 21 November 1916, Kerr was executed by firing squad. Private Kerr's remains are now located in Quatre-Vents Military Cemetery, Plot III, Row A, Grave 9.\n\nJoseph LaLancette was born on 1 September 1895 in London. After enlisting in Quebec City, LaLancette arrived in France as part of a reinforcement of the 22nd Battalion.\n\nOn 6 April 1917, just before the attack on Vimy Ridge, LaLancette went absent and was shortly arrested together with Gustave Comté. Both soldiers faced separate courts-martial, charged with desertion. Both LaLancette and Comté were found guilty and sentenced to death.\n\nAt 04:45 on 3 July 1917, LaLancette and Comté were executed by firing squad.

After his arrest, Ling gave a false name and had another soldier's paybook in his possession. At his court-martial for desertion, Ling was found guilty and sentenced to death by shooting.\n\nOn 12 August 1918, Ling (aged 22) was executed by firing squad. His remains are now located in Cerisy-Gailly Military Cemetery, Plot II, Row N. Grave 20.\n\nBorn 22 December 1897 in Toronto, Harold Edward James Lodge enlisted in the CEF in April 1915. Lodge was stationed in France, as part of the 19th Battalion.\n\nLodge took a quick leave of absence from his unit in November 1917, during preparations for the Battle of Passchendaele, and was warned by an officer that if he tried again it would be considered desertion, yet nonetheless went AWOL again that same night. He got his hands on a British Red Cross corporal's uniform, and hid in Boulogne until his arrest.\n\nHe escaped detention, while awaiting his court-martial hearing in December. However he was found by Military Police three weeks later, aboard a sailing ship about to leave France. Being returned to detention aboard a train, Pte. Lodge once again escaped, but was quickly apprehended.\n\nHis court martial finally took place on 23 February 1918, charged with four counts of desertion.

The 54th Battalion for England in 1915, entering France in August 1916.\n\nMoles had a poor conduct sheet, with four convictions for AWOL and several convictions for drunkenness.\n\nDuring October 1917, Moles was ordered to rejoin his company which was about to go into action. Instead of going forward, Moles went to a village in the rear areas. He was eventually arrested three weeks later, and charged with desertion.\n\nAt his court-martial, Moles was found guilty and sentenced to death. At 05:30 on 22 October 1917, Moles was executed by firing squad. His remains are located in Ypres Reservoir Cemetery, Plot I, Row H, Grave 76.\n\nBorn April 1, 1896 in Bouctouche, New Brunswick, Pte.

His court-martial found him guilty of desertion and sentenced him to death by firing squad. His remains are located in Ecoivres Military Cemetery, Plot VI, Row C, Grave 7.\n\nEdward James Reynolds was born on 2 January 1896 in Toronto. During April 1915, Reynolds enlisted in the 35th Battalion. By November 1915, Reynolds was a member of the 3rd Battalion in the line near Ploegsteert.\n\nOn 25 July 1916, the Germans exploded a mine under a portion of the front line called \"The Bluff\". The 3rd Battalion was ordered forward to plug the resulting gap in the front line. However, Reynolds fell out from his platoon only to be found 2 days later at his battalion's transport lines. Reynolds claimed that he had been ordered back and got lost. This excuse was accepted.\n\nDuring the following night (26 July 1916), Reynolds was ordered to accompany a ration party up to the front line. Again Reynolds fell out and went back to his battalion's transport lines. This time Reynolds was arrested and charged with desertion.

In February 1915, he enlisted in the 52nd Battalion, which departed to England that summer. By the end of the year, he had been transferred to reinforce the 8th Battalion, who were fighting in Belgium.\n\nOver the next two months, the 8th Battalion was involved in a number of bloody skirmishes surrounding Passchendaele, and at some point during this fighting - Welsh went missing for a third time. He was found 8 weeks later, living in a cottage near Poperinghe, charged, and sentenced once again to death by firing squad. He was executed at 06:00 on 6 March 1918, and buried in the Mazingarbe Communal Cememtery Extension, Plot III, Row B, Grave 12.\n\nBorn in Limerick, Ireland in June 1879, James H. Wilson spent nine years serving in the Connaught Rangers before emigrating to Canada before the war.\n\nWilson enlisted at the start of the war in August 1914, but was discharged the following February 3 after a series of infractions left him \"undesirable for military service\". He was re-instated a month later on 13 March, but had further infractions soon after.\n\nHe went AWOL again on 25 February 1916, and was not seen again until he turned himself into the army nearly three months later.

He failed to report on time, though he arrived in time for the evening's rollcall.\n\nSeveral days later however, Young was arrested after being found miles behind the front lines, dressed in a Corporal's uniform. He initially gave a false name and rank to the Military Police who arrested him. He was charged with desertion, court-martialled and sentenced to death. He was executed by firing squad at 06:26 on 29 October 1916. His remains are today located in Bully-Grenay Communal Cemetery, Plot II, Row B, Grave 14.\n\nBorn in Kiev, Ukraine in 1895, Dimitro Sinicky (#830020) emigrated to Canada. His name is correctly spelled \"Dmytro Sinizki\" ().\n\nHe voluntarily enlisted in Winnipeg's 144th Canadian Infantry during December 1915, and after shipping out to England, was one of a handful of troops used to reinforce the Ontarian 52nd Battalion after its losses at the Battle of Vimy Ridge. His Attestation Paper indicates his religious affiliation was \"Greek Catholic,\" meaning he was a Ukrainian by ethnicity.\n\nIn August 1917, Sinicky was part of a trench-raiding team when he refused to participate in a raid. The following night he was forcibly brought along on the raid, but he simply sat down and refused to continue. He was arrested, court-martialled and charged with cowardice. Sentenced to death by firing squad, Sinicky was executed at 06:11 on 9 October 1917. He is buried in Plot VI K 19 of the Ecoivres Military Cemetery, France.\n\nBorn in London, England on 11 June 1888, Alexander Butler served in the 7th Queen's Own Hussars for nearly seven years, before emigrating to Canada.\n\nFollowing the outbreak of the war, Butler enlisted in the Royal Canadian Dragoons, and was dispatched to France in May 1915, where he participated in dismounted service at the Battle of Festubert, Battle of Givenchy and the Battle of Messines. Butler fell off his horse twice, once resulting in a head injury, which led to increasingly belligerent behaviour. The RCDs then saw mounted service in the forthcoming June 1916 Somme Offensive.\n\nOn 8 June 1916, while stationed behind the front lines of Hesdin, Butler took his rifle and opened fire, shooting Trooper Mickleburgh dead with five shots in the chest before he was overpowered and arrested.\n\nHe was court-martialled 16 days later, and while the courts made mention of his mental instability, several doctors testified that the claims were exaggerated and he was competent to stand trial. He was sentenced to death, and at 04:00 on 2 July 1916, was executed by firing squad. His remains are today located in Ribemont Communal Cemetery Extension, Plot IV, Row M, Grave 5.\n\nBorn 29 March 1888 in Winkler, Manitoba, Benjamin De Fehr enlisted as a driver in the Canadian Army Service Corps following the outbreak of war, and was duly transferred to England in 1916.\n\nHe had no incidents of poor conduct, until 19 August 1916, while serving in France with the 1st Canadian Reserve Park in the rear areas near Hazebrouck. He used his rifle to shoot 43-year-old Regimental Sergeant-Major J.R. Scott in the back, killing him instantly. De Fehr was overpowered and arrested immediately.\n\nHe was officially court-martialled on 22 August, and while he maintained that he had been drunk during the incident, several witnesses testified that he had been sober. He was found guilty of murder and sentenced to death by firing squad.\n\nDe Fehr was executed three days later, and his remains are today located in Hazebrouck Communal Cemetery, Plot I, Row A, Grave 13, only three graves away from his victim, RSM Scott.\n\nIn the Canadian army, only one soldier was executed for committing a military offense during the Second World War, Private Harold Joseph Pringle of The Hastings and Prince Edward Regiment. He was executed after VE-Day in Italy in 1945 for the crimes of desertion and accomplice to murder.\n\n\n"}

This requires both zygotic genome activation (ZGA) and degradation of maternal products. MZT is often thought to be synonymous with midblastula transition (MBT), but these processes are, in fact, distinct. However, the MBT roughly coincides with ZGA in many metazoans, and thus may share some common regulatory features. For example, both processes are proposed to be regulated by the nucleocytoplasmic ratio. MBT strictly refers to changes in the cell cycle and cell motility that occur just prior to gastrulation. In the early cleavage stages of embryogenesis, rapid divisions occur synchronously and there are no \"gap\" stages in the cell cycle. During these stages, there is also little to no transcription of mRNA from the zygotic genome, but zygotic transcription is not required for MBT to occur. Cellular functions during early cleavage are carried out primarily by maternal products – proteins and mRNAs contributed to the egg during oogenesis.\n\nTo begin transcription of zygotic genes, the embryo must first overcome the silencing that has been established. The cause of this silencing could be due to several factors: chromatin modifications leading to repression, lack of adequate transcription machinery, or lack of time in which significant transcription can occur due to the shortened cell cycles. Evidence for the first method was provided by Newport and Kirschner's experiments showing that nucleocytoplasmic ratio plays a role in activating zygotic transcription. They suggest that a defined amount of repressor is packaged into the egg, and that the exponential amplification of DNA at each cell cycle results in titration of the repressor at the appropriate time. Indeed, in \"Xenopus\" embryos in which excess DNA is introduced, transcription begins earlier. More recently, evidence has been shown that transcription of a subset of genes in \"Drosophila\" is delayed by one cell cycle in haploid embryos. The second mechanism of repression has also been addressed experimentally. Prioleau et al. show that by introducing TATA binding protein (TBP) into \"Xenopus\" oocytes, the block in transcription can be partially overcome. The hypothesis that shortened cell cycles can cause repression of transcription is supported by the observation that mitosis causes transcription to cease.\n\nTo eliminate the contribution of maternal gene products to development, maternally-supplied mRNAs must be degraded in the embryo. Studies in \"Drosophila\" have shown that sequences in the 3' UTR of maternal transcripts mediate their degradation (reviewed by Tadros and Lipshitz) These sequences are recognized by regulatory proteins that cause destabilization or degradation of the transcripts. Recent studies in both zebrafish and \"Xenopus\" have found evidence of a role for microRNAs in degradation of maternal transcripts. In zebrafish, the microRNA miR-430 is expressed at the onset of zygotic transcription and targets several hundred mRNAs for deadenylation and degradation. Many of these targets are genes that are expressed maternally. Similarly, in \"Xenopus\", the miR-430 ortholog miR-427 has been shown to target maternal mRNAs for deadenylation. Specifically, miR-427 targets include cell cycle regulators such as Cyclin A1 and Cyclin B2.\n"}

A player's turn consists of (in the following order):\nA) A draw phase: The active player draws until he has five cards in hand)\nB) A general phase: The active player can attack or use support cards. At this time the defending player can use defense cards to counter an opponent's attack)\nC) The discard phase: The active player can discard any number of cards from their hand. Those discarded cards become \"guts\", which can be used to pay for attacks.\n\nA monster is killed when its HP reaches 0. A player loses when they have no monsters remaining or when they are unable to draw a card.\n\nThe game consists of a character traveling to dungeons to obtain sacred stones needed to generate new monster cards and fighting ranked battles to increase their level to unlock new dungeons. Each dungeon contains multiple randomly generated floors, invisible guardians that automatically challenge the player, normal NPCs that the player can challenge, and a boss. After achieving the maximum rank and completing all the dungeons, a new dungeon is discovered and after defeating its boss a player has the option of starting a new game+ during which his normal deck is locked until he reaches the final dungeon. There's no actual story or objectives beyond unlocking content.\n\n\nThe game received \"mixed\" reviews according to the review aggregation website GameRankings.\n\n"}

{"id": "14139244", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14139244", "title": "Murder of Arlene Fraser", "text": "Murder of Arlene Fraser\n\nArlene Fraser was a 33-year-old woman from Elgin in Moray, Scotland, who vanished from her home on 28 April 1998 after her two children went to school. No trace of her was ever found, but her husband was convicted of her murder, upheld on appeal.\n\nInitially treated as a missing persons inquiry by Grampian Police, the senior detective in the case Detective Chief Inspector Peter Simpson said six months after her disappearance \"The only conclusion that's still left open to us, which I firmly believe has happened, is that something criminal has taken place here and that Arlene has been the victim of a crime. I am of the opinion that she's dead. There's no indication that she's living somewhere else\".\n\nAt the time her husband Nat Fraser was on bail for the attempted murder of his wife for an incident that occurred before she disappeared, but at this point in the investigation police were satisfied with his alibi. This charge was later reduced to one of assault, although he was jailed for 18 months when convicted nearly two years later. Defence counsel Neil Murray QC said part of the delay in bringing the case to court was that a number of challenges were made under the European Convention on Human Rights, claiming that Fraser could not get a fair trial because of publicity. Fraser was also charged with attempting to pervert the course of justice in relation to police inquiries into a beige Ford Fiesta which they believed to be involved in Arlene Fraser's disappearance. The car had been purchased by a friend of Nat Fraser, Hector Dick who also faced the same charges.\n\nDick had been due to appear at Elgin Sheriff Court in August 2000. However, the case was delayed and at the request of the defence moved, eventually being heard at Dingwall Sheriff Court at the start of 2001. On the fourth day of his trial Dick changed his plea, and pleaded guilty to a slightly lesser charge. He was subsequently jailed for a year, during which period he attempted to commit suicide by hanging himself.\n\nFraser was released from prison in April 2001 after serving half his sentence but was jailed again four months later after admitting lying to receive almost £19,000 in legal aid funding. In June 2001, a third man Glenn Lucas was charged with attempting to pervert the course of justice in relation to the case. Finally, on 26 April 2002, it was announced by the Crown Office that Fraser, Dick and Lucas had been indicted for the murder of Arlene Fraser, with each being charged with conspiring to murder Mrs Fraser, murdering her and attempting to defeat the ends of justice.\n\nDuring the trial in January 2003 it was announced that the Crown would not be proceeding with the charges against Dick and Lucas. Advocate depute Alan Turnbull QC, prosecuting, told the court that he intended to call Dick as a witness against Nat Fraser. The trial was then adjourned with the judge Lord Mackay explaining that there would be a delay before the trial could continue as Fraser's defence team would have a right to interview Dick and Lucas – something which could not be done while the two men were still facing charges. Dick then appeared as a witness for the prosecution and admitted burning and crushing the Ford Fiesta police had been looking for because he feared that it might be linked to the disappearance of Arlene Fraser. He claimed in evidence that Fraser told him he had arranged for his estranged wife to be killed and then disposed of her body by grinding it up and burying it. He denied any involvement at all in the disappearance of Arlene.\n\nAs the trial progressed the Crown dropped three charges of attempting to defeat the ends of justice against Fraser, leaving him to face the sole charge of murder \"with others unknown\". Fraser had lodged a special defence of alibi, claiming he was carrying out deliveries for his fruit and vegetable business on the day his wife vanished, a claim supported by an employee who was with him on the day.\n\nOn 29 January 2003, Nat Fraser was found guilty of the murder of his wife. Judge Lord Mackay described the 44-year-old as \"evil\" before sentencing him to life imprisonment, with a recommendation to serve a minimum of 25 years. Fraser collapsed as the judge passed sentence. His defence team immediately stated an intention to appeal. The case was described as the largest investigation Grampian Police had ever carried out but the absence of a body and any forensic evidence always hampered the inquiry.\n\nThe appeal against conviction was lodged in December 2003, and in May the following year the Court of Appeal granted leave for him to do so. On 19 October 2005 the BBC broadcast \"Arlene Fraser Murder Trial: The Missing Evidence\" which claimed that Dick had lied during the trial. The following year, in March 2006 two inquiries were announced after claims that relevant evidence was not made available to the original trial. Lord Advocate Colin Boyd stated that it was \"a matter of serious concern\" that the information had not been given to lawyers for Fraser. A Crown Office statement said \"The lord advocate regards it as a matter of serious concern that this evidence was not made available to the defence prior to the trial. For that reason, the area procurator fiscal for Glasgow, Catherine Dyer, has now been asked to conduct a full investigation into this matter.\" Grampian Police asked the Association of Chief Police Officers in Scotland (ACPOS) to investigate its handling of relevant information and evidence.That inquiry was to be carried out by a team from Strathclyde Police, headed by Deputy Chief Constable Ricky Gray.\n\nIn May 2006, Fraser was released from prison pending the outcome of his appeal. Shortly after fresh allegations about the case appeared in the press, prompting Arlene's family to call for Fraser to be returned to prison, though this did not happen. The case went to appeal in November 2007 with claims that the prosecution in the original case had withheld evidence, and that police officers had lied. In early December, Fraser was returned to prison pending the outcome of the appeal which was announced on 6 May 2008. The Lord Justice Clerk, Lord Gill, sitting with Lord Osborne and Lord Johnston refused the appeal. As he was led from court Fraser told waiting reporters \"The fight will go on, as will the fight to get to the truth.\" In October of that year, he announced that he intended to apply for leave to appeal to the Privy Council in London, the hearing to take place in the High Court in Edinburgh. Leave to appeal to the Privy Council was refused. A further appeal in November 2009 contended that earlier appeal hearings were not fair under human rights legislation. That appeal too was refused in January 2010. There were no further routes of appeal in the Scottish Courts, and in May 2010, Fraser announced an intention to appeal in the Supreme Court in London having been given special leave to do so. In May 2011, Fraser won his appeal. Allowing it, the Supreme Court judges said in their deliberations: \"The Supreme Court unanimously allows the appeal. It remits the case to a differently constituted Appeal Court to consider whether to grant authority for a new prosecution and then, having considered that point, to quash the conviction.\" The Crown Office immediately said it would seek to bring fresh proceedings against Fraser, whilst in a statement, Arlene Fraser's family said: \"Today's decision by the Supreme Court is bitterly disappointing. We accept today's decision. However, we fully support the Crown's intention to seek authority to bring fresh proceedings against Nat Fraser for Arlene's murder.\"\n\nIn 2012, Fraser went on trial again in the High Court in Edinburgh, before judge Lord Bracadale with Advocate Depute Alex Prentice QC leading for the prosecution. On 30 May, he was again found guilty by majority verdict of Arlene's murder and sentenced to a minimum seventeen years imprisonment. Hector Dick again gave evidence against Fraser. John Scott QC, defending, said the case was \"blighted by hindsight and assumption\", and argued much of the Crown evidence was \"unreliable\". During cross examination, Scott suggested that Dick had been responsible for the murder of Arlene Fraser, an allegation he denied.\n\nFollowing the verdict Lord Bracadale told Fraser: \"The evidence indicated that at some point you arranged for someone to kill your wife, Arlene, and dispose of her body. Thus you instigated in cold blood the pre-meditated murder of your wife and mother of your children, then aged 10 and five years. The murder and disposal of the body must have been carried out with ruthless efficiency, for there is not a trace of Arlene Fraser from that day to this and her bereft family continue to live with no satisfactory knowledge of what happened to her remains.\n\nFraser and his supporters maintain that he is the victim of a miscarriage of justice and that he did not murder his wife.\n\nThe second trial was the subject of a television documentary \"The Murder Trial\", which was shown on Channel 4 on 9 July 2013, only the second time that footage from a British murder trial was broadcast on television. The documentary won the award for the best single documentary at the 2014 British Academy Television Awards.\n\nIn October 2013 an appeal against conviction by Fraser was refused.\n\n"}
{"id": "12601389", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12601389", "title": "Murder of Glenn Kopitske", "text": "Murder of Glenn Kopitske\n\nGlenn Kopitske (July 24, 1966 – July 31, 2003), was murdered by 17-year-old Gary Hirte in Wisconsin. Hirte initially admitted to killing Kopitske \"to see if he could get away with it\". However, he later claimed to have experienced temporary insanity that resulted from his rage after a supposed homosexual encounter with Kopitske.\n\nGlenn Kopitske was adopted by Shirley and Virgil Kopitske, a couple who had already buried two children. After college at the University of Texas in Dallas, where he tried his hand at stand-up comedy, he returned to live near his parents in Winnebago County, Wisconsin. Diagnosed with bipolar disorder as a teenager, Kopitske needed to be close to his parents but required some independence as well.\n\nIn 1996, Kopitske—who received a monthly federal check due to his psychological disability, and supported himself by working at Wal-Mart and substitute teaching in New London—took $500 and declared himself a candidate for the White House, even though he was five years too young to qualify as a presidential candidate. He even invited citizens to a meet-and-greet luncheon. He did community theatre, appearing in a local theater production of \"Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat\".\n\nAt 37, Kopitske—never married—lived alone in Winnebago County, far from any neighbors.\n\nAt sixteen, Gary Hirte (born 1986) became the first Eagle Scout that Weyauwega, Wisconsin had produced in 20 years. By 17, Hirte was an all-conference football player, a straight-A student, and salutatorian of his graduating class at Weyauwega-Fremont High School. At 6-foot-3 and ., Hirte was two-time all-conference defensive lineman on his high school football team, and a member of the wrestling team. He had also achieved a 4.0 grade point average. Hirte worked at Dairy Queen during his senior year, and had big plans for his future. He'd won a scholarship to St. Cloud State University in Minnesota, where he planned to study criminal justice.\n\nGlenn Kopitske had been dead for almost two days when his mother drove to his house on Saturday, August 2, after not being able to reach him by phone, and discovered his nude body. Kopitske's back door was locked, which his mother said was unusual for him. Shirley Kopitske also noticed that her son's car keys, which he always kept on the kitchen table, were missing.\n\nThe summer heat had so affected Kopitske's body that authorities initially thought he had died of natural causes. Only on Monday, August 5, when a pathologist turned Kopitske's body over and noticed liquefied brain matter leaking from a wound in the back of the head did authorities realize that Kopitske had been shot to death, and that the marks on his chest and back were actually post-mortem stab wounds.\n\nThe physical search of the murder scene turned up no further evidence. During a canvas of the neighborhood, a neighbor claimed that a few nights earlier he had seen \"an older car with square headlights and rectangular taillights\" driving through the area, flashing a bright light at the three residences on the dead end street. It would be several months before investigators knew who had killed Kopitske, and why.\n\nTwo weeks after Kopitske's murder Hirte called his friend, Eric Wenzelow, and asked him if he knew about Kopitske's murder. Over two weeks earlier, Wenzelow had been with Hirte, cruising Winnegabo County at night, in Hirte's Dodge Dynasty shining a 500,000-candle-power spotlight around. Hirte called it \"shining for deer\". The game involved shining the light at deer, thus paralyzing them, and took them right past Kopitske's house.\n\n\"I did it,\" Hirte told Wenzelow during that call.\n\nWenzelow did not believe Hirte initially. So Hirte showed him the 8-inch long hunting knife he said he used to stab Kopitske in the back and chest, and the keys he said he'd taken from Kopitske's home.\n\nIn August 2003 Hirte met Olivia Thoma at the Waupaca County Fair, where she was chosen \"Fairest of the Fair\". Over the course of their relationship, Hirte told Thoma how he had murdered Kopitske. Thoma became convinced that Hirte was telling the truth and, in January 2004, told local police about her suspicions, providing details about the murder that had not been reported in the media.\n\nHirte told Thoma that he had driven his father's car, which matched the description given by Kopitske's neighbor, to Kopitske's home and shot him in the back of the head with a 12-gauge shotgun, then stabbed him twice in the back and once in the heart.\n\nOn January 28, 2004, Thoma agreed to engage Hirte in a telephone conversation about the murder, while the police listened and recorded what was said. During that telephone call, Hirte told Thoma he'd killed Kopitske \"to see if he could get away with it\".\n\nAfter his arrest, Hirte would confess to a very different motive.\n\nThe following day, police interviewed Hirte's friends at school, including Wenzelow, who told them about driving past Kopitske's house with Hirte in July while they were \"shining for deer\", and how Hirte had told him about the murder and showed him the knife.\n\nHirte was called to the principal's office and arrested. Hirte admitted telling friends that he had killed Kopitske but claimed to have been making it up. He later hired Gerald Boyle, who had previously defended Jeffrey Dahmer, as his defense attorney.\n\nThe same day, police arrived at the Hirtes' home with a search warrant. In Hirte's room, they found Kopitske's keys above the doorsill. They also found a 12-gauge shotgun in the basement.\n\nOn August 30, 2004, Hirte was charged with first-degree murder. He was held in Winnebago County jail on $400,000 bond. He pleaded not guilty, and later changed his plea to not guilty by reason of mental disease or defect. If he were found not guilty by reason of mental disease or defect, Hirte would be able to petition every six months for release.\n\nLawyers suggested that DNA evidence suggested the theory that Hirte killed Kopitske just to see if he could get away with it was not true.\n\nPolice alleged, based in part on Hirte's recorded comments to Thoma, that on the night of Kopitske's murder, Hirte parked his car at the end of the dead-end road, and retrieved a 12-gauge shotgun from the trunk of the car.\n\nKopitske was asleep, but likely woke up and got out of bed after Hirte entered the house. Upon seeing Hirte and his shotgun, Kopitske pleaded with Hirte not to shoot him. Hirte then said he ordered Kopitske to lie down on the floor.\n\nForensics tests show that Hirte then pressed the muzzle of the shotgun in to the back of Kopitske's head and then fired. Hirte said he then stabbed Kopitske twice. The second time, the knife plunged in so deep that Hirte had to use two hands to pull it out. Before leaving, Hirte spotted Kopitske's keys on the table, and slipped them into his pocket.\n\nOn January 31, 2005 Hirte's attorney said that Hirte had homosexual urges that intensified when he drank alcohol. Those urges, Boyle said, led to a sexual encounter between Hirte and Kopitske, after which Hirte's rage over the encounter led him to return to Kopitske's house and kill him. Boyle said that Hirte could not explain the murder for months, until a forensic report suggested a possible sexual element to the crime. Hirte then \"broke down\" and told the story of what he said happened between him and Kopitske.\n\n\"One of the torments he had\", Boyle told the jury about Hirte, was that \"he didn't understand his own sexuality\".\n\nHirte said that hours before the murder he had been sitting on top of his car, underneath a bridge, drinking alcohol and listening to Nirvana. He'd finished six malt liquors and 15 shots of vodka when Kopitske drove up in his car. Hirte said Kopitske flirted with him, and the two agreed to return to Kopitske's house where Hirte performed oral sex on Kopitske. According to Hirte, their encounter was consensual.\n\nHirte testified that afterward he returned to his car and fell asleep. When he awoke, he was sober and enraged about having had sex with another man. Hirte said he felt \"just grossed out beyond belief, disappointed ... [at] the proof of my imperfection that I had done these things\". He said he believed a homosexual act was \"not as bad as raping or torturing someone\" but was worse than murder.\n\nExpert witness for the defense, John Liccione, said that Hirte was in the middle of a psychotic depressive reaction, though he had no history of mental problems. Assistant District Attorney Michelle, emphasized that the sexual encounter did not come up until trial, asked Liccionne during cross examination if Hirte would rather have had his parents believe that he was a cold-blooded killer or a homosexual. Licionne answered that it would be very difficult for a teenager in a religious family to admit homosexual feelings or activities.\n\nHirte's parents believed their son's story about a sexual encounter with Kopitske, and that he would have been willing to risk life imprisonment to keep that secret to himself. Kopitske's parents said later that there was no way the sexual encounter Hirte talked about had happened.\n\nDistrict Attorney Bill Lennon doubted that the sexual encounter happened, and said that no forensic evidence suggested a sexual encounter.\n\nOn February 4, 2005 the jury rejected Hirte's insanity plea, resulting in a life sentence for Hirte.\n\n\nGary Hirte entry on NNDB\n"}

{"id": "30876653", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30876653", "title": "Musa al-Kadhim", "text": "Musa al-Kadhim\n\nMūsá ibn Ja‘far al-Kāzim (), also called Abūl-Hasan, Abū Abd Allah, Abū Ibrāhīm, and al-Kāzim (the one who controls his anger), was the seventh Shiite Imam after his father Ja'far al-Sadiq. He is regarded by Sunnis as a renowned scholar, and was a contemporary of the Abbasid caliphs Al-Mansur, Al-Hadi, Al-Mahdi and Harun al-Rashid. He was imprisoned several times; finally dying in Baghdad in the Sindi ibn Shahak prison. Ali al-Ridha, the eighth Imām, and Fatemah Masume were among his children.\n\nMusa al-Kadhim was born during the conflict between the Abbasids and Umayyads, and was four years old when As-Saffah, the first Abbasid Caliph, took the throne. His mother, Hamidah, was a former slave from either Berbery or Andalusia. Al-Kadhim was brought up in a large family, with nine sisters and six brothers. His oldest brother Ismail predeceased his father Ja'far al-Sadiq, who held the position of Imam. According to Twelver Shiites, Musa was chosen by divine order and decree of his father as the next Imam.\n\nAccording to some sources, al-Kadhim was religiously minded as a child. Muhammad Baqir Majlisi relates an incident where Abū Ḥanīfa called on Ja'far al-Sadiq to ask his advice. While there, he encountered al-Kadhim, who was then five years old. Hanifa asked al-Kadhim the question meant for his father, saying: \"Boy, from whom does disobedience (issue)? Does it issue from Allah or from the servant?\" Al-Kadhim answered, saying: \"Either it issues from God and not from the servant at all, so God does not punish the servant for what he does not do; or it issues from the servant and God, and God is a stronger partner. Therefore, the stronger partner has no right to punish the weak for a sin in which they are equal; or it issues from the servant and not from God. So if He wills to pardon (him), (He will pardon him), and if He wills to punish (him), (He will punish him); and God is He whose help is sought.\" Upon hearing this, Hanifa left, saying that the answer had been good enough for him.\nIn another incident, Abū Ḥanīfa complained to al-Sadiq, saying: \"I have seen your son, Musa, pray while the people were passing (walking) before him. He did not prevent them from that.\" The Imam ordered his son to be brought before him, and asked him whether it was true. Al-Khadhim replied \"Yes, father, the One to Whom I pray is nearer to me than them; Allah, the Great and Almighty, says: \"We are nearer to him than the jugular vein.\"\" On hearing this response, the Imam rose, hugged his son, and said; \"May my father and mother be your ransom, O he in whom secrets have been deposited!\"\n\nMusa al-Kadhim was said to be a gentle and tolerant man. He was called al-Kadhim because he was kind, forgiving and generous toward the people who treated him in a bad manner or were unfriendly towards him. Ibn Khallikan said \"that when a man had spoken ill of him he sent him a purse of money.\" One such incident concerned a man who cursed al-Kadhim's grandfather, Imam Ali. The Imam's followers intended to kill the man, but al-Kadhim prevented them. He went to the man's farm in the outskirts of Medina. He approached him, but the man shouted at him not to walk on his plants. The Imam paid no attention and when he reached him, sat beside him and treated him kindly, asking how much had the man paid to sow his land. \"One hundred dinars,\" said the man. \"How much do you hope to acquire from it?\" asked the Imam. \"I do not know the unknown,\" said the man. \"I only asked you about what you hope it would bring you,\" insisted the Imam. The man answered \"two hundred dinars\", and the Imam gave him three hundred dinars, saying \"This three hundred dinars is for you and your plants are as they are.\"\n\nThe Imam then headed for the mosque of the prophet, where he saw that the man was already sitting there. When he saw the Imam, the man stood up and called out the verse: \"Allah knows best where to put his (prophetic) mission.\"\nHis companions were surprised at this change, but the man recited to them the noble deeds of the Imam and invoked Allah for him. Hence, the Imam turned to his companions and said: \"Which was better – what you wanted or what I wanted? I have put right his attitude to the extent you have now become acquainted with.\"\nMusa al-Kadhim was also called Abdu' al-Salih (the Holy Servant) because his interests lay in religious rather than political matters. He was known to distribute money to the town of Medina despite his family being poor.\n\nThe Shiite Imams frequently had to deal with persecution, and sometimes resorted to the practice of taqiyya, a form of religious dissimulation, for protection. When Jafar al-Sadiq was poisoned, the Caliph Al-Mansur wanted to end the imamah, and so he wrote to the governor of Medina to behead the person that al-Sadiq had named as his successor in his last testament. When he read the testament, however, the governor of Medina saw that the Imam had chosen four people rather than one: the caliph himself, the governor of Medina, the Imam's older son Abdullah al-Aftah, and Musa, his younger son. As a result, Mansur was unable to end the imamate. However, unlike his father who had been able to teach freely in Medina, Musa al-Kadhim lived with tight restrictions set by Abbasid caliphs, such as al-Mansur and Harun al-Rashid. Musa al-Kadhim never accepted Harun's government, because he believed al- Rashid sought to destroy Islam by erasing the truth and effacing justice. Therefore, he forbade his Shi'ites from cooperating with Harun, excluding those who through their jobs could help the believers and save them from oppression.\n\nCaliph Harun al-Rashid, an opponent of the Imam, said that al-Kadhim had the qualities of a true Imam, and that he was better suited to inherit the Caliphate from Muhammad than al-Rashid. When his son al-Ma'mun asked him why he magnified the Imam, he said that Musa al-Kadhim was \"the Imam of the people, the proof of Allah's mercy to His creation and His caliph among His servants\". \"I am\", Harun said, \"outwardly the Imam of the masses by force and through oppression, while Musa ibn Ja'far is the Imam in truth.\" However, he said that he would not deliver the Caliphate to the Imam: \"by Allah, if you yourself attempt to take such caliphate from me, I shall take it away from you even if that means gouging your eyes, for power is blind.\" He advised his son to get true knowledge from the Imam, saying: \"This (Musa al-Kadhim) is the inheritor of the knowledge of the Prophets ... If you desire sound knowledge, you will find it with this.\" Afterwards when al-Ma'mun inherited the Caliphate from al-Rashid, he insisted on giving it to Musa al-Kadhim's son, Ali al-Ridha, the eighth Shiite Imam, arguing that he found \"no person on the face of earth more learned than this man.\"\n\nAfter the death of al-Kadhim's father, Ja'far al-Sadiq, the sixth Imam the majority of Shiites followed Musa al-Kadhim, while another group followed Isma'il, al-Sadiq's older son. Imam Jafar al-Sadiq tried hard to clarify that his son Musa will be the next Imam after his death because the Shi'a maintain that the infallibility of the Imam is a basic rule in the Imamate. “The theologians have defined the Imamate, saying: \"Surely the Imamate is a grace from Allah, Who grants it to the most perfect and best of His servants to Him” This latter group separated afterwards from the majority of Shiites and became known as Ismailis. Smaller groups accepted either Abdullah al-Aftah or Muhammad, other sons of Ja'far al-Sadiq, as the Imam. Finally, another group considered Ja'far al-Sadiq to be the last Imam. After the death of Musa al-Kadhim, the majority followed his son, Ali al-Ridha, while the rest believed that al-Kadhim was the last Imam. This latter group became known as the Waqifiyah.\n\nOne of the stories about the Imam concerns an incident where Harun al-Rashid and the Imam were together before the tomb of Muhammad in Medina, when, to show his family ties to Muhammad, al-Rashid had said, \"Salutation unto thee, O Prophet of God, unto thee who art my cousin!\" In response, the Imam said, \"Salutation unto thee, o my dear father!\" which made al-Rashid furious. \"Abul-Hasan, such glory as thine is truly to be vaunted of\" said al-Rashid. Later, al-Rashid found the opportunity to question him, asking why he had permitted people to ascribe him to Muhammad and to call him: \"O Sons of Allah's Apostle\", while he was actually the son of Ali, and that one is ascribed to his father, and that Fatimah, his mother, was a container, and that Muhammad was his grandfather on the side of his mother. The Imam replied, asking \"If the Prophet was raised from the dead and proposed to your daughter, would you respond to him?\" \"Rather I would through that pride myself on the Arabs, the non-Arabs, and Quraysh,\" answered al-Rashid. \"But he would not propose (to my daughter) and I would not marry (her) to him,\" said the Imam, \"because he begot me and did not beget you.\" Al-Rashid, however, was not satisfied with this answer, insisting that \"the progeny belongs to the male and not to the female\", and that the Imams were Muhammad's daughter's children.\n\nThe Imam quoted from the Quran, stating that in the Quran, God had said: \"and of his descendants, David and Solomon, Job, Joseph, Moses and Aaron; and thus do We reward those who do good. And Zechariah and John the Baptist, and Jesus and Elias: All in the company of the righteous\" \"Who is Jesus's father, O Commander of the faithful?\" asked the Imam. \"Jesus had no father,\" said al-Rashid. The Imam argued that God had ascribed Jesus to the descendants of the prophets through Mary; \"similarly, we have been ascribed to the descendants of the Prophet through our mother Fatimah,\" said the Imam. Nevertheless, al-Rashid asked the Imam to give him more evidence and proof, so he put forward another quote from the Quran, reciting the verse: \"But whoever disputes with you in this matter after what has come to you of knowledge, then say: Come, let us call our sons and your sons and our women and your women and ourselves and yourselves, then let us be earnest in prayer, and pray for the curse of Allah on the liars.\" Then he said: \"None claims that the Prophet made someone enter under the cloak when he challenged the Christians to a contest of prayer to God (mubahala) except Ali, Fatimah, al-Hasan, and al-Husayn. Therefore the explanation of the verse is: Our sons are al-Hasan and al-Husayn; our women is Fatimah; ourselves is Ali.\"\n\nAnother incident concerns Bishr al-Hafi, who led a Bacchic life. Once in the midst of the noise, music, alcoholic drink and frivolity, Musa al-Kadhim happened to pass by his house in Baghdad. Al-Kadhim saw a slave girl coming out of the house carrying some sweepings. He turned to the slave and asked her: \"Is the owner of this house free or a servant?\" \"He is free,\" she replied. \"You are right,\" responded Musa al-Kadhim, \"if he was a servant, he would fear his Lord.\" The slave girl came into the house while al-Hafi was still at the wine table: \"What delayed you?\" asked al-Hafi. She informed him of what had happened between her and the Imam. It is said that al-Hafi rushed to the door barefooted but the Imam had already left, so he left in search of the Imam, and when he found him, asked him to repeat his words. Al-Hafi was so taken aback by the Imam's words that he fell on the ground and began to cry. \"No, I am a slave, I am a slave.\" From then on, he would walk without shoes and people would call him Bishr al-Hafi (The barefooted one). When asked why he did not wear shoes, he would say that he was guided while he was barefoot, so he would remain in that condition till death.\n\nA final incident concerned Al-Abbas (born Hilal al-Shami), who said to Musa al-Kadhim that people admired those who ate simple food, wore coarse clothes, and showed reverence. For that reason, the Imam reminded him of Joseph, who had been a prophet; however, Joseph had worn silk mantles decorated with gold, and sat on the thrones of the Pharaohs. \"The people were in no need of his clothes, but they were in need of his justice,\" said the Imam. \"An Imam is required to be just and fair; when he says something, he says the truth; when he promises something, he fulfills his promise; when he passes a judgement, he judges equitably. Allah has not forbidden wearing a particular type of clothes or eating a particular type of food earned through a lawful way; rather He has forbidden the unlawful, little or much.\" Then he recited the verse: \"Say: Who has forbidden the beautiful (gifts) of Allah which He has produced for His servants, and the agreeable things of the sustenance.\"\n\nMusa al-Kadhim was imprisoned multiple times during his lifetime. The first time, Caliph al-Mahdi had him arrested and brought to Baghdad. According to Ibn Khallikan, \"This Caliph had a dream in which Ali ibn Abu Talib appeared to him and said, 'O Muhammad, were ye ready therefore, if ye had been put in authority, to commit evil in the earth, and to violate the ties of blood? Al-Fadl ibn al-Rabi' says: \"He sent for me at night and that put me in great dread. I went to him and found him chanting the above verse and no man had a finer voice than he. He said to me, 'Bring me Musa ibn Ja'far.' I did so and he embraced him, seated him by his side and said to him, 'Abul-Hasan, I have just seen in a dream the Commander of the Faithful, Ali ibn Abu Talib, and he has recited to me such and such a verse; give me the assurance that you will not revolt against me or against any of my children.' He answered, 'By Allah, I am incapable of revolting.' 'You say the truth!' replied the Caliph, 'give him three thousand pieces of gold and restore him to his family in Medina.' I arranged the affair of his departure that very night, lest some obstacle might turn up, and before morning the man was on his journey.\"\n\nAl-Kadhim's second imprisonment was a result of his argument with al-Rashid over descent from Muhammad. Al-Khuzai, the head of the palace guards, narrated a dream the Caliph supposedly had, which made him release the Imam: \"A messenger came to me from al-Rashid,\" he said, \"at an hour in which I never before received his visits; he pulled me from the place where I was and would not even allow me to change my clothes. This put me in great fear. When I arrived at the palace, I found the Caliph sitting up in his bed. I saluted him, but he kept silent for some time; so my mind was much troubled and my fears greatly augmented. At length he said, 'Do you know why I sent for you at such an hour?' I answered, 'By Allah, I do not, Commander of the Faithful.' 'Know,' said he, 'that I just had a dream in which it seemed to me as if an Abyssinian came to me with a javelin in his hand and said to me: \"Let Musa ibn Ja'far be set at liberty this very hour, otherwise I shall slay thee with this javelin.\" Do you therefore go and get him set free.' I replied, 'Commander of the Faithful, shall I then liberate Musa the son of Ja'far?' 'Yes,' said he, 'go and set Musa ibn Ja'far at liberty. Give him thirty thousand dirhems and say to him in my name, if you would like to remain with us you will obtain from me whatever you desire, but if you prefer going to Medina you have permission to do so.' I went to the prison and found the Imam waiting for me. 'Whilst I was asleep,' he said, 'behold the Apostle of God came to me and said, O Musa, thou hast been imprisoned unjustly; so recite the words I am going to repeat to thee, for assuredly thou shalt not pass all this night in prison.\n\nAl-Fakhri states the reason for his final imprisonment was that \"there were some of the relatives of Musa ibn Ja'far who were envious of him and carried false reports about him to al-Rashid, saying, 'The people are paying him the Khums, or one-fifth of their property, on accepting the Imamah, and he is about to come forth against you.' They brought this report to al-Rashid so frequently that it made him anxious and agitated. In that year al-Rashid went on the pilgrimage, and when he arrived in Medina, he arrested Musa ibn Ja'far, and brought him to Baghdad in a litter, and imprisoned him under the care of al-Sindi ibn Sha'hik.\"\nAl-Fakhri adds \"Al-Rashid was at Rakka when he sent orders that the Imam should be put to death. They then brought a number of reputable men to Karkh to act as coroners and to testify publicly that he had died a natural death. He, then, was buried in the cemetery of Quraish on the south side of Baghdad.\" The implication made by the Shi'a is that he was poisoned. The place he was buried was a cemetery, but soon this place became the focus of pilgrimage to the grave of the Imam. A town grew around the graveyard. The name of the town became Kadhimiya (the town of the Imam Kadhim). A reputed school of theology was founded in this town; the school is still a source of learning for many students from all over the world.\n\n\nThe Festival of Imam Musa al Kadhim is a Twelver Shia Muslim festival dedicated to the memory of the Imam Musa al-Kadhim. It occurs on the seventh day of the month of Rajab in the Islamic calendar.\n\n\n\n"}

He was drafted by the Detroit Lions second overall in the 2010 NFL Draft. He played college football at Nebraska, where he earned All-American honors.\n\nAs a college senior, Suh became one of the most decorated players in college football history. He won numerous awards including the Associated Press College Football Player of the Year Award, Bronko Nagurski Trophy, Chuck Bednarik Award, Lombardi Award, and Outland Trophy, and was recognized as a unanimous All-American.\n\nSuh has been criticized for his aggressive style of play and has been fined eight times through 2014 for a total of $255,375 by the NFL, with seven for player-safety violations, and suspended once (for two games), resulting in the loss of an additional $165,294 in pay. Despite issues with sportsmanship, Suh is recognized as one of the best defensive tackles in the NFL. In 2015, Suh was named the 24th best player in the NFL, while being the sixth highest ranked defensive player. He has won numerous awards and accolades, having been named the Defensive Rookie of the Year, while being selected to four Pro Bowls in his first five seasons, and having been named an All Pro six times. Four times to the All Pro First team, including his rookie year, and twice to the All Pro Second team. In 2015, Suh became the highest-paid defensive player in NFL history, having signed a six-year contract with the Miami Dolphins, worth in excess of $114 million, with nearly $60 million fully guaranteed; he was released after just three seasons.\n\nSuh was born in Portland, Oregon. He attended Grant High School in Portland, where he was a three-sport star in football, basketball, and track and field. He played as a two-way lineman for the Grant Generals. Suh earned first-team All-PIL honors on both offense and defense as a junior and was an honorable-mention All-state pick. In his senior year, he collected 65 tackles, including 10 sacks and recovered four fumbles, which earned him \"Parade\" magazine high school All-America honors, the 2004 Portland Interscholastic League Defensive Player of the Year, and a Class 4A first-team all-state selection. He also played in the 2005 U.S. Army All-American Bowl. In basketball, he earned honorable-mention All-League honors as a junior and senior.\n\nAlso a track & field athlete, Suh was one of the state's top performers in the shot put. He was the district shot put champion in 2004, and won the OSAA Class 4A shot put title in 2005 with a school-record throw of 18.71 meters (61 ft, 4 in). For his all-around athletic accomplishments, Suh was a finalist for the \"Portland Tribune\"’s Athlete of the Year.\n\nConsidered a four-star recruit by \"Rivals.com\", Suh was the sixth ranked defensive tackle in the United States. Recruited by many, Suh took official visits to Nebraska, Mississippi State, Oregon State, Miami (FL), and California, before committing to the Nebraska Cornhuskers on January 20, 2005.\n\nSuh attended the University of Nebraska, where he played for the Nebraska Cornhuskers football team from 2005 to 2009. As a true freshman in 2005, Suh played in the first two games and had an assisted tackle against Wake Forest before missing the remainder of the season after undergoing knee surgery. He received a medical redshirt.\n\nIn 2006, Suh played in all 14 games as a backup defensive lineman and earned freshman All-Big 12 honors from \"The Sporting News\". Despite coming off the bench, he finished the year with 19 total tackles, and ranked among the team leaders in tackles for loss (8) and quarterback sacks (3½). In his sophomore season, Suh started in 11 of the Cornhuskers' 12 games, and recorded 34 total tackles on the season.\n\nAs a junior in 2008, Suh recorded a team-high 76 tackles, 7.5 sacks, 19 tackles for loss, 2 interceptions (both returned for touchdowns), and a touchdown reception while playing fullback. He became the first Nebraska defensive lineman to lead the team in tackles since 1973. Suh earned First-team All-Big 12 honors in 2008, the first Nebraska interior defensive lineman to earn those honors since Steve Warren in 1999. He was also an honorable mention All-American.\n\nIn 2009, Suh registered 85 tackles, 12 quarterback sacks, 28 quarterback hurries, 24 tackles for loss, 10 pass breakups, 3 blocked kicks, and 1 interception. Suh had 12 tackles (seven for losses, a school single-game record) and 4½ sacks in a 13–12 loss to the Texas Longhorns in the Big 12 Championship Game, for which he received game MVP honors. He helped Huskers defense rank first nationally in scoring defense (10.4 ppg), tied for second in total sacks (44), first in pass efficiency defense (87.3), seventh in total defense (272.0 ypg), ninth in rushing defense (93.1 ypg) and 18th in passing defense (178.9 ypg). He also played all four quarters versus Arizona in the 2009 Holiday Bowl, helping Nebraska record the first shutout in the Holiday Bowl's 32-year history, as well as the first shutout in school bowl history. He earned unanimous first-team All-Big 12 honors and the Big-12 Defensive Player of the Year. Nationally, he was named the Associated Press College Football Player of the Year, the recipient of the Bill Willis Trophy, Bronko Nagurski Trophy, Chuck Bednarik Award, Lombardi Award and Outland Trophy, and was recognized as a unanimous first-team All-American. He was also a finalist for the Lott Trophy, Walter Camp Award, and Heisman Trophy.\n\nOn December 3, 2009, Suh was named as one of five finalists for the Walter Camp Award. On November 24, 2009, Suh was named one of three finalists for the 2009 Outland Trophy, alongside Mike Iupati and Russell Okung. On November 10, Suh was selected one of four finalists for the 2009 Lombardi Award, the first Cornhusker to receive this honor since Dominic Raiola in 2000. In October 2009, Suh was named to \"The Sporting News\" and \"CBS Sports\" midseason All-American team. Suh began season at No. 3 on \"Rivals.com′s\" preseason defensive tackle power ranking. He was also named to the 2009 Outland Trophy watch list.\n\nOn December 7, 2009, Suh was named a finalist for the Heisman Trophy. Later that evening, Suh was named the 2009 Bronko Nagurski Trophy winner as the top defensive player in the nation. CBS Sportsline also named Suh their Defensive Player of the Year. The Touchdown Club of Columbus named Suh the winner of the Bill Willis Trophy on December 9, 2009. That same evening Suh won the Lombardi Award for the top collegiate lineman or linebacker. On December 11, at the ESPN College Football Awards show, Suh was selected as the winner of the Chuck Bednarik Award as the nation's best defensive player and took home the Outland Trophy for the best interior lineman. Suh finished fourth in the Heisman race, accumulating 815 points, which is the highest total by a fourth-place finisher for the Heisman Trophy in its history. He was also one of four unanimous selections to the AP First-team All-America in 2009. Suh was named the 2009 AP Player of Year, becoming the first defensive player to receive the award in its history.\n\nSuh was widely considered to be one of the best prospects available in the draft. \"ESPN.com's\" draft analyst Mel Kiper, Jr., described Suh as \"maybe the most dominating defensive tackle I've seen in 32 years\" and projected him to go #1 overall. Suh was seen as an ideal fit at either defensive tackle in a 4–3 defense or as a defensive end in a 3–4 defense.\n\nFor off-the-field marketing activities, Suh signed with The Agency Sports Management & Marketing, where Russ Spielman served as lead agent. At the NFL Combine, Suh bench pressed 225 lbs 32 times and had a 35½ inch vertical leap, the highest for a defensive tackle since Al Lucas (36 in) in 2000.\n\nBefore the NFL draft, Suh signed with Maximum Sports Management and agent Roosevelt Barnes. This caused moderate concern for many teams who were hoping to draft him, as this was the same agent who represented Michael Crabtree. Crabtree was the longest 2009 NFL Draft first round contract hold out, waiting over six weeks into the NFL season before signing with the San Francisco 49ers. Crabtree had even threatened to re-enter the 2010 NFL Draft.\n\nDespite the concerns, Suh was selected second overall in the 2010 NFL Draft by the Detroit Lions, becoming the first defensive lineman selected by the team in the first round since Luther Elliss in 1995. Suh was the highest selected Cornhusker defender since Neil Smith in 1988.\n\nOn August 3, Suh agreed to a five-year, $68 million contract with the Lions, including $40 million guaranteed. On September 12, Suh had his first sack against Chicago Bears quarterback Jay Cutler. On October 10, during a game against the St. Louis Rams, he recorded his only career interception to date off of Sam Bradford. Suh scored the one touchdown of his NFL career against the Washington Redskins on October 31, 2010, on a recovery of a Rex Grossman fumble.\n\nAfter an injury to Lions kicker Jason Hanson, the Lions had Suh attempt an extra point on November 7, 2010, against the New York Jets. However, Suh missed the extra point when the ball hit the right upright.\n\nFor the 2010 season, Suh led the Lions, all rookies, and all defensive tackles in sacks with 10. He was picked as a starter for the Pro Bowl, becoming the first Lions rookie since Barry Sanders to be picked as a Pro Bowl starter. He missed the game, however, due to shoulder surgery. On January 25, 2011, Suh was named to the All-Pro Team. He was also named the Sporting News Rookie of the Year, the Pro Football Weekly and Pro Football Writers of America Rookie of the Year, the Pepsi NFL Rookie of the Year, and the AP Defensive Rookie of the Year.\n\nHis rookie year saw the beginning of what would take Suh to a league record amount of fines for on-the-field behavior. He was fined $7,500 in a preseason game against the Cleveland Browns for a facemask of Jake Delhomme, fined $5,000 for using an opponent as leverage on a field goal in a week 9 game against the Jets, and fined $15,000 in a week 13 game against the Bears for unnecessary roughness against quarterback Jay Cutler.\n\nDuring the third quarter of the Lions' Thanksgiving game against the Green Bay Packers on November 24, 2011, Suh pushed Packers' offensive lineman Evan Dietrich-Smith's head into the ground three times, then stomped on his arm. All of this took place after the whistle was blown. Suh was penalized for unnecessary roughness and ejected from the game. The resulting penalty gave the Packers an automatic first down. The Packers would score a touchdown two plays later, giving them a 14–0 lead and an eventual 27–15 victory.\n\nInitially, Suh denied stomping on Dietrich-Smith, saying he was only trying to get his balance back. However, on Friday morning, the Lions issued a statement calling Suh's actions \"unacceptable\". Within hours, Suh wrote on his Facebook page that he'd \"made a mistake\" a day before and intended to learn from it. Fox Sports NFL rules analyst and former vice president of officiating Mike Pereira said that based on his knowledge of league discipline, \"the question won’t be if the NFL will suspend Suh, but when—and for how many games\". He drew parallels between Suh's actions and those of Albert Haynesworth, who drew a five-game suspension—the longest suspension for an on-field incident in modern NFL history—for stomping on Andre Gurode's head in 2006.\n\nOn November 29, the NFL suspended Suh for two games without pay which was $165,294 in lost wages. In announcing the decision, Roger Goodell noted that it was the fifth time Suh had been disciplined for on-field conduct. Suh appealed the decision, and the NFL held an expedited hearing before former Oakland Raiders coach Art Shell, so that a decision could be handed down before the Lions' next game, on December 4, against the New Orleans Saints. The appeal was turned down on December 2, forcing Suh to sit out the game against the Saints and the December 11 game against the Minnesota Vikings.\n\nSuh was named a Pro Bowl alternate for the NFC after the 2011 NFL season. He finished the 2011 season with 4 sacks, a pass defended, and 26 tackles.\n\nDuring a Thanksgiving game on November 22, 2012, Suh was involved in a play in which he kicked Houston Texans quarterback Matt Schaub in the groin. The incident resulted in a $30,000 fine from the league, nearly double the mandated fine for a second offense of \"striking/kicking/kneeing\" an opponent. There was speculation the size of the fine was recognition by the league of Suh's history of questionable on-field hits, while others viewed it as a \"wishy-washy\" and \"cop-out\" action by the league in issuing a large fine without a suspension. In response, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell said that \"intent is something that’s very difficult for us to ever try to make a judgment on\". Suh denied the kick was intentional, stating his foot inadvertently hit Schaub as he was being dragged to the ground. Suh finished 2012 with 8 sacks, 2 passes defended, and 25 tackles in 16 games (15 starts).\n\nIn the Lions' Week 1 victory over the Minnesota Vikings, 34–24, Suh low blocked John Sullivan during a DeAndre Levy \"pick 6\"; the resulting personal foul nullified Levy's touchdown. Two days after the game, Suh was fined $100,000 for the hit—which, not counting lost pay for suspensions, is the largest fine ever issued to a player for on-the-field actions. He appealed the fine but the ruling was later upheld by the NFL.\n\nIn the Lions' Week 6 victory over the Cleveland Browns, Suh tackled Browns QB Brandon Weeden in a questionable manner. Though not called for a penalty during the game, Suh was fined $31,500 by the NFL, but fine was later rescinded.\n\nDuring a Thanksgiving game against the Packers on November 28, 2013, Suh sacked Matt Flynn in the end zone, forcing a safety for the first time of his career. On November 29, 2013, Suh was fined $7,875 for performing a throat slash gesture during a game against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.\n\nSuh racked up 53 tackles and 8.5 sacks in the 2014 season. In Week 17, against the Green Bay Packers, Suh stepped on quarterback Aaron Rodgers' calf. Suh received a one-game suspension, seemingly barring him from the Wild Card playoff game the following week against the Dallas Cowboys; but on appeal, arbitrator Ted Cottrell reversed the suspension, opting instead for another fine worth $70,000. Suh played in the Wild Card matchup against the Cowboys and sacked Tony Romo twice.\n\nOn March 11, 2015, the Miami Dolphins announced that they had signed Suh to a six-year, $114 million contract with $60 million guaranteed. The contract made him the highest-paid defensive player in NFL history, passing Houston Texans defensive end J. J. Watt.\n\nDuring a game against the Washington Redskins on September 13, 2015, as Redskins' running back Alfred Morris was still lying on the ground following a tackle, Suh appeared to knock Morris's helmet off with his leg. The next day, the NFL announced that they would not discipline him, as \"Suh's action was not deemed a kick\". Suh started all 16 games in 2015, finishing the season with 61 tackles, six sacks, and five passes defended. He was ranked 40th on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2016.\n\nIn 2016, Suh started all 16 games with 72 tackles, 5 sacks, and 6 passes defended. He was ranked 55th by his peers on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2017.\n\nDuring Thursday Night Football against the Baltimore Ravens in Week 8, Suh committed two unnecessary roughness penalties, including one moment where he attempted to choke Ryan Mallett and shove him out of reach. Suh claimed that his choke on Mallett was a self-defense, thinking that Mallett tried to attack him firsthand. The Dolphins were shut out as they lost 40-0.\n\nOn March 14, 2018, Suh was released, to free up a large amount of salary cap, after serving three seasons with the Dolphins.\n\nOn March 26, 2018, Suh signed a one-year, $14 million contract with the Los Angeles Rams.\n\nSuh has been criticized in the media by other players and by the NFL for his aggressive style of play and has been fined a total of $216,875 by the league for four violations in the first four years in his career. In a poll of fellow players conducted by the \"Sporting News\", Suh was named \"the dirtiest player\" in the NFL. As of December 2011, he had been flagged for nine personal fouls in his first two years, the most of any player in the league in that time frame. He was named the NFL's \"Least-Liked Player\" in a \"Forbes\"-publicized Nielsen report in October 2012.\n\nIn 2015, Forbes estimated Suh's annual income at $38.5 million.\n\nSuh’s mother, Bernadette (née Lennon) Suh, an elementary school teacher, was born in Spanish Town, Jamaica, and is a graduate of Southern Oregon University. His father, Michael Suh, is from Cameroon and played semi-professional soccer in Germany, while also playing for the Cameroonian National Team and working as a machinist. They met and married in Portland, Oregon, in 1982, after Michael Suh was admitted to a Portland trade school. Although his father is only , Suh's great-grandfather, also named Ndamukong Suh, stood . In the Ngemba language of Cameroon, Ndamukong means \"House of Spears\".\n\nSuh has a construction management degree from Nebraska and has aspirations to be a general contractor after his professional career. His father, Michael Suh, is a mechanical engineer and owns his own heating and cooling company in Portland. For his first two years in college before he knew about his professional prospects, Suh had wanted to \"work with my dad and build his company up to be as big as possible\" after graduation.\n\nSuh has four sisters; he is the second oldest of the children. His older sister and manager, Odette Lennon Ngum Suh, played soccer collegiately at Mississippi State University and is currently a midfielder on the Cameroon women's national football team. His cousin, Kameron Chatman, plays for the Michigan Wolverines men's basketball team.\n\nSuh is a fan of Arsenal F.C.\n\nIn 2012, Suh participated in Fox's dating game show \"The Choice\". Suh was nominated on \"Splash\" on March 10, 2013. He was eliminated on the 2nd week of the show.\n\nDuring the 2013 Stanley Cup Playoffs, Suh rode the Zamboni at Joe Louis Arena wearing a Detroit Red Wings jersey during the Detroit Red Wings playoff series against the Chicago Blackhawks.\n\nOn April 17, 2010, at the annual Husker Spring Game, Suh announced a $2.6 million donation to the University of Nebraska. Two million dollars of his gift will go to Nebraska Athletics for its Strength and Conditioning Program, and the remaining $600,000 will create an endowed scholarship for the UNL College of Engineering, from which he graduated in 2009 with a degree in construction management. His gift is the largest single charitable contribution by any former player and occurred before Suh was taken with the second overall pick in the 2010 NFL Draft. Suh, a former Grant High School football star, donated $250,000 toward the effort to bring a turf field to Grant High School in 2013.\n\nBefore Suh was drafted by an NFL team, he signed an endorsement deal with Nike. Suh has also signed endorsement deals with Subway, Dick's Sporting Goods, Omaha Steaks, and Chrysler.\n\n"}
{"id": "23141006", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23141006", "title": "Orc", "text": "Orc\n\nAn orc (also spelled ork) is a fictional humanoid creature that is part of a fantasy race akin to goblins. \n\nWhile the overall concept of orcs draws on a variety of pre-existing mythology, the main conception of the creatures stems from the fantasy writings of J. R. R. Tolkien, in particular \"The Lord of the Rings\". In Tolkien's works, orcs are a brutish, aggressive, repulsive and generally malevolent species, existing in stark contrast with the benevolent Elvish race and generally serving an evil power. Tolkien's concept of orcs has subsequently been adapted and imported into other works of fantasy fiction as well as role-playing and strategy games (such as \"Dungeons & Dragons\", \"Warhammer\", and \"Warcraft\"), broadening the recognition of the creatures in popular culture.\n\nEarlier references to creatures etymologically or conceptually similar to orcs can be found in Anglo-Saxon sources; including \"Beowulf\" and 16th-century Italian folk tales, in particular those of Giambattista Basile. \n\nIn popular culture (including fantasy fiction and games), orcs are variously portrayed but tend towards the descriptions originally set down by Tolkien. They are of approximately human shape (with bowed legs and long arms) and of varying size. Orcs are generally ugly and filthy, with prominent fangs and facial features tending toward the grotesque (generally a mixture of the ape-like and pig-like). Their skin is typically a shade of green, grey, black, brown, or sometimes red or sandy tan (Tolkien, in contrast, described some as \"sallow\", some as \"black\"—not necessarily a reference to skin colour—and one as \"black-skinned\").\n\nOrcs are aggressive scavengers and opportunistic carnivores (with a taste for both in-species cannibalism and human flesh). While possessing a low cunning and crude culture of their own, they are generally portrayed as a subject race used as soldiers (or battle fodder) by beings of greater power and intelligence. There are exceptions, as orcs sometimes have cunning leaders of their own species, such as Azog from the \"Lord of the Rings\" universe. Violent by nature, they will fight ferociously if compelled or directed by a guiding will, but tend towards more chaotic behaviour (including cowardice) if left to their own devices. They often use boars, wolves, wargs, and other unusual beasts for battle transport.\n\nThe modern use of the English term \"orc\" to denote a race of evil, humanoid creatures has its inception with J. R. R. Tolkien. Tolkien's earliest Elvish dictionaries include the entry \"Ork (orq-)\" \"monster\", \"ogre\", \"demon\", together with \"orqindi\" and \"ogresse\". Tolkien sometimes used the plural form \"orqui\" in his early texts.\n\nTolkien sometimes, particularly in \"The Hobbit\", used the word \"goblin\" instead of orc to describe the creatures. He notes that \"orc\" is \"usually translated\" as \"goblin\". In \"The Lord of the Rings\", \"goblin\" is also used as an alternative to \"orc\", particularly in chapters describing events from a hobbit's perspective. Thus, the Uruk-hai of Isengard and the Mordor orc-captain Grishnakh are described as both \"orcs\" and \"goblins\" in \"The Lord of the Rings\". Later in his life, Tolkien expressed an intention to change the spelling to \"ork\", but the only place where that spelling occurred in his lifetime was in the published version of \"The Adventures of Tom Bombadil\", in the poem \"Bombadil Goes Boating\": \"I'll call the orks on you: that'll send you running!\" In \"The Silmarillion\", published posthumously, \"orcs\" was retained.\n\nOld English glossaries record the word \"orc\" corresponding with Latin Orcus (deity of the Underworld), and synonymous with \"þyrs\"/\"ðyrs\" \"ogre\" (cognate to ), as well as \"hell devil\". The \"Woordenboek der Nederlandsche Taal\" defines \"ork\" in the very closely related Old Dutch language as a \"verslindend monster\" (\"devouring monster\"), and points at a possible origin in the Old Dutch \"nork\" \"petulant, crabbed, evil person\".\n\nThe is glossed as \"\" as given in the first Cleopatra Glossary (10th century), and on this entry Thomas Wright wrote, \"Orcus was the name for Pluto, the god of the infernal regions, hence we can easily understand the explanation of \"hel-deofol\". \"Orc\", in Anglo-Saxon, like \"thyrs\", means a spectre, or goblin.\"\nProbably the lone literary example is from \"Beowulf\", and its poet found use of the \"orc-\" stem in \"orcneas\", one of the tribes of creatures named alongside elves and ettins (giants) that have been condemned by God:\n\nThe compound \"orcneas\" is designated \"evil spirits\" above, but its accurate meaning is uncertain. Klaeber suggested it consisted of \"orc\" < L. \"orcus\" \"the underworld\" + \"neas\" \"corpses\" and that the translation \"evils spirits\" failed to do justice.\n\nThe lexicography has been complicated by the Bosworth-Toller dictionary's conjecture that \"orcneas\" devolved from the form \"*orcen\" possibly meaning \"(?) a sea-monster,\" possibly related to .\n\nThe \"Oxford English Dictionary\" refers to \"orke\", used in 1656 in a way that is reminiscent of giants and ogres. It is presumed that 'orke'/'ogre' came into English via continental fairy-tales, especially from the 17th-century French writer Charles Perrault, who borrowed most of his stories and developed his \"ogre\" from the 16th-century Italian writers Giambattista Basile, Giovanni Francesco Straparola (who has been credited with introducing the literary form of the fairy tale) and Basile, who wrote in the Naples dialect and claimed simply to be passing on oral folktales from his region that he had collected. In at least a dozen or more tales, Basile used \"huorco\", \"huerco\" or \"uerco\", the Neapolitan form of \"orco\" [Italian] \"giant\", \"monster\", to describe a large, hairy, tusked, mannish beast who could speak, that lived away in a dark forest or garden and that might capture and eat humans, or be indifferent or even benevolent—all depending on the tale.\n\nNote that the Italian term \"orco\" is derived directly from the Latin Orcus, and is correctly translated into English as \"ogre\". In early Roman mythology, Orcus was a god of the underworld, and in medieval times, by association with death and the underworld, the term \"orcus\" also began to see use for other monstrous creatures and incorporated into the medieval bestiary. In particular, the Italian \"orco\" implies an anthropomorphic creature with bestial aspects, often demonic, suggestive of the Anglo-Saxon ogre. Because of this, Italian translations of the terms \"orc\" or \"ork\", as found in Beowulf, as well as the writings of J. R. R. Tolkien and Markus Heitz, remain problematic, and are variously rendered—at the discretion of the translator—as \"orco\" (ogre), \"mezz'orco\" (half-ogre) or \"orchetto\" (small ogre).\n\nThe first English use of \"orke\", in 1656 (forty-one years before Perrault published his \"Mother Goose\" tales), comes from \"Don Zara\", a fairy tale by Samuel Holland. It is a pastiche and a parody of fantastical Spanish romances such as \"Don Quixote\" and presumably is populated by beasts and monsters in common to them.\nA monster called \"Orcus\" is mentioned in Edmund Spenser's \"Faerie Queene\" (Book II, Canto XII, line xlvii).\n\nThe word ultimately comes from Latin \"Orcus\", the demonic Roman god of death, who should not be confused with Pluto, the god of the underworld, and has transformed by several stages from the meanings \"underworld\", \"hell\", \"devil\", \"evil creature\" to \"ogre\". Tolkien and the lexicons he used attributed the origin of the doubtful Old English \"orc\" to \"Orcus\" and in one of his invented languages, the word for orc also had the form \"orco\".\n\nWords derived from or related to the Italian term \"orco\" exist in other countries: in addition to Italian dialectal \"uerco\", \"huerco\", and \"huorco\" and the Spanish word \"güercu\", there is also Tyrolean \"ork\", \"a house gnome\" or \"a mountain spirit\" that acts as a protector of wildlife.\n\nTolkien explicitly denied any intended connection between his orcs and the killer whale \"Orcinus orca\" and other cetaceans, that are also referred to as orcs. This is a borrowing from Latin \"orca\", as used by Pliny the Elder, that refers to some kind of whale, quite likely \"Orcinus orca\" and which also appears in John Milton's poem \"Paradise Lost\" during a description of the Great Flood.\n\nThe humanoid, non-maritime race of orcs that exists in Middle-earth is the invention of J. R. R. Tolkien, albeit one which he stated in a letter was influenced by George MacDonald's \"The Princess and the Goblin\". The word is usually capitalised in Tolkien's writing, but not necessarily in other works.\n\nWithin Tolkien's invented languages, the Elvish words for orc are derived from a root \"ruk\" referring to fear and horror, from which is derived an expanded form of the root \"uruk\". A noun \"*uruku\" is produced from the extended root. This eventually turns into Quenya \"urco\", plural \"urqui\". A related word \"*urkō\" produces Sindarin \"orch\", plural \"yrch\". The Quenya words are said to be less specific in meaning than the Sindarin, meaning 'bogey'. For the specific creatures called \"yrch\" by the Sindar, the Quenya word \"orco\", with plurals \"orcor\" and \"orqui\", was created.\n\nThese orcs had similar names in the other languages of Middle-earth: in Orkish \"uruk\" (restricted to the larger soldier-orcs); in the language of the Drúedain \"gorgûn\"; in Khuzdul \"rukhs\", plural \"rakhâs\"; and in the language of Rohan and in the Common Speech, \"orc\".\n\nIn Tolkien's writings, Orcs are of human shape, of varying size. They are depicted as ugly and filthy, with a taste for human flesh. They are fanged, bow-legged and long-armed and some have dark skin as if burned. In a private letter, Tolkien describes them as \"squat, broad, flat-nosed, sallow-skinned, with wide mouths and slant eyes. They are portrayed as miserable, crafty, and vicious beings.\n\nThey fight ferociously as long as a guiding \"will\" (such as Morgoth or Sauron) compels or directs them. Tolkien sometimes describes Orcs as mainly being battle fodder. Orcs are used as soldiers by both the greater and lesser villains of \"The Lord of the Rings\", such as Sauron and Saruman.\n\nOrcs eat all manner of flesh, including the flesh of Men. From descriptions and events relating to the Orcs, it seems likely that they indulge in cannibalism: in Chapter II of \"The Two Towers\", Grishnákh, an Orc from Mordor, claims that the Isengard Orcs eat Orc-flesh, but whether that is true, or a canard spoken in malice, is uncertain. What does seem certain is that the Isengard Orcs resented that description. In that chapter Pippin is flung stale bread and an explicitly vague \"strip of raw dried flesh... the flesh of he dared not guess what creature\" by an Orc after a fight occurred in which the Uruk-hai killed several Orcs.\n\nOrc origins are first described in \"The Tale of Tinúviel\" as \"foul broodlings of Melkor who fared abroad doing his evil work\". In \"The Fall of Gondolin\" Tolkien wrote that \"all that race were bred by Melko of the subterranean heats and slime. Their hearts were of granite and their bodies deformed; foul their faces which smiled not, but their laugh that of the clash of metal, and to nothing were they more fain than to aid in the basest of the purposes of Melko.\"\n\nIn \"The Silmarillion\", Tolkien conceived the Orcs to be Elves who had been enslaved and tortured by Morgoth and broken and twisted into his evil soldiers. In other versions of their origin, including those from Tolkien's notes, the Orcs are depicted as the parodies or false-creations of Morgoth, animated solely by his evil will or perhaps, by his own diffused essence, and made intentionally to mock or spite Eru Ilúvatar's creations—the Eldar and Edain.\n\nSee The origin of Orcs for a full list of possible Orc origins proposed by Tolkien.\n\nIn The Lord of the Rings, the orcs spoke Black Speech, the language of Mordor. In \"The Fellowship of the Ring\", Gandalf recites a poem about the Rings of Power which includes the lines \"One Ring to rule them all, One Ring to find them, One Ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind them\" for Frodo at Bag End. Later, in the protection of the elven stronghold of Rivendell, Gandalf himself feels safe enough to recite these lines in the original language, Black Speech: \"Ash nazg durbatulûk, ash nazg gimbatul, ash nazg thrakatulûk, agh burzum-ishi krimpatûl\".\n\nSome of these words contain similar pieces, such as \"atul\", and \"úk\", that are repeated, in Durbatulúk and Tharakutulúk. From this it can be shown that \"úk\" at some point in a word means \"all\" and \"atul\" means \"them\". The language contains many compound words.\n\nTolkien referred to the Old English origins of the word \"orc\", observing that \"the word is, as far as I am concerned, actually derived from Old English \"orc\" 'demon', but only because of its phonetic suitability\" and \"I originally took the word from Old English \"orc\" (\"Beowulf\" 112 \"orc-neas\" and the gloss \"orc\" = \"þyrs\" ('ogre'), \"heldeofol\" ('hell-devil')). This is supposed not to be connected with modern English \"orc\", \"ork\", a name applied to various sea-beasts of the dolphin order\". Tolkien also observed a connection with the Latin word \"orcus\", noting that \"the word used in translation of Q \"urko\", S \"orch\" is Orc. But that is because of the similarity of the ancient English word \"orc\", 'evil spirit or bogey', to the Elvish words. There is possibly no connection between them. The English word is now generally supposed to be derived from Latin \"orcus\" \". He also stated that, \"\"Orc\" I derived from Anglo-Saxon, a word meaning demon, usually supposed to be derived from the Latin \"Orcus\" – hell. But I doubt this, though the matter is too involved to set out here\".\n\nThe word \"orcné\", attested in the plural word \"orcnéas\", is a \"hapax legomenon\" in the poem \"Beowulf\". It is generally supposed to contain an element \"-né\", cognate to Gothic \"naus\" and Old Norse \"nár\", both meaning 'corpse'. The usual Old English word for corpse is \"líc\", but \"-né\" appears in \"nebbed\" 'corpse bed', and in \"dryhtné\" 'dead body of a warrior', where \"dryht\" is the name of a military unit that can be vaguely translated as 'band' or 'host'. In, If \"*orcné\" is to be glossed as \"orcus\" 'corpse', the meaning may be \"corpse from Orcus (i.e. the underworld)\", or \"devil-corpse\", understood as some sort of walking dead creature. This etymology is plausible, but it remains conjectural. \"Orc\" appears in two other locations in the poem \"Beowulf\", but refers to cups of precious metal found in a treasure-hoard.\n\nThe Old English word \"þyrs\", given as a gloss for Latin \"orcus\", is cognate to Old Norse \"þurs\" 'giant', 'ogre', both originating from the unattested Common Germanic term \"thurisaz\", which in Norse mythology refers to one of the monstrous descendants of the giant Ymir. But it is to be noted in connection with Tolkien's reference to a gloss \"orc\"=\"þyrs\", that while there is an entry in an 11th-century English glossary which implies such an equivalence, [Latin] \"orcus\" [Old English] \"orc þyrs oððe heldeofol\", this is in fact a conflation of two glosses in an earlier glossary of the 7th century, found in two different places: [Latin] \"orcus\" [Old English] \"orc\" and [Latin] \"orcus\" [Old English] \"þyrs oððe heldiubol\"\". The first of these two glosses is in a section devoted to household implements and 'orcus' is, in that place, a corruption of Latin \"urceus\" 'jug', 'pitcher', or of \"orca\" 'pot', 'jar'. The word 'orc' in the first gloss has the meaning 'cup': it is descended from an early Germanic borrowing from \"urceus\", related to Gothic \"aurkeis\" 'cup', both related to Modern English \"ark\" 'vessel', 'container'. In the second gloss, the Latin \"orcus\" is equated to Old English 'giant', 'hell-devil', but not to any already-existing Old English word 'orc', as Tolkien mistakenly thought.\n\nOrc is a proper name for one of the characters in the complex mythology of William Blake. Unlike the Tolkien's humanoid monster, his Orc is a positive figure, the embodiment of rebellion, and stands opposed to Urizen, the embodiment of tradition.\n\nIn Blake's illuminated book \"America a Prophecy\", Orc is described by his mythic opponent, \"Albion's Angel\" as the \"Lover of Wild Rebellion, and transgressor of God's Law\". He symbolizes the spirit of rebellion and freedom, which provoked the French Revolution.\n\nIn contemporary literature, a series of books written by Stan Nicholls focuses on the conflicts between a group of orcs and humans, but through the unconventional view of the orcs. The trilogy, first printed in the United Kingdom by Victor Gollancz Ltd, has become an international bestseller. It is one of the few series where orcs are featured as the main characters.\n\nIn Terry Pratchett's \"Discworld\" series, Orcs are a race that is close to extinction. They were originally bred (or made) from men and not goblins, as was commonly believed, in order to be used as weapons in a Great War, 'encouraged' by whips and beatings.\n\nTo date only one living Orc, called Nutt, has been shown as a primary character, although it has been indicated that there are others that exist in the wilds of far Uberwald. The brutal reputation and legends of Orcs reflects the traditional fantasy concept of soulless killers. Nutt was originally kept ignorant of his species, and believed as others suggested, that he was simply an unusually tall goblin. He is depicted as being a sensitive and intelligent creature, and by extension members of his species are portrayed as the victims of victors' propaganda.\n\nOrcs play an important role in Markus Heitz' Dwarves quartet, \"The Dwarves\", \"The War of the Dwarves,\" \"Revenge of the Dwarves\" and \"The Fate of the Dwarves\", collectively known as the \"Dwarves saga\".\n\nThe ork is a demon of Tyrol alpine folklore. As a dwarf, the ork was a well-behaved kobold/house spirit in wine cellars. He may be connected to the figure Orkise in the medieval poem \"Virginal\", about Dietrich von Bern's battle with a vaguely similar being.\n\nSince the publication of Tolkien's \"The Lord of the Rings\", orcs have become a fixture of fantasy fiction and role-playing games, where the orcs and goblins are usually considered to be distinct races of goblinoids. They were once often depicted with pig-like faces, although they were never described as such by Tolkien. In the 1980s, another orc archetype was introduced by the table-top miniature war games \"Warhammer Fantasy Battle\", a heavily muscled, green-skinned barbarian with exaggerated tusks, brow, and lower jaw, whose personality is not so much evil as crudely thuggish, often to a comical degree. This style of orc has since become popular in a vast number of fantasy settings and games, including a signature of the \"Warcraft\" series of computer games and spin-offs.\n\nGames Workshop's \"Warhammer Fantasy\" and \"Warhammer 40,000\" games feature Orcs ('Orks' in \"Warhammer 40,000\"). The latter setting is unique for featuring Orks in a science fiction environment that are capable of building crude, but functional vehicles, firearms and even spaceships. Anatomically, Warhammer Orcs are no taller than humans, unless when they are standing upright instead of slouching, but are substantially broader, with ape-like short legs and long arms. They have massive heads that come directly forward on their necks, giving them a stooping appearance. They have tough thick green skin that is highly resistant to pain. Warhammer Orcs lack intelligence, but can be cunning at times. They are warlike and their society is geared towards constant warfare. Their constant need to fight is an expression of Orc culture: Orcs do not form alliances except for temporary alliances with each other. In combat they can transform even the most common object into a lethal killing instrument. Orcs tend to ally with Goblins, who are called Gretchin in \"Warhammer 40,000\", and Snotlings, but when allied, the Orcs act as bullies towards their smaller Goblinoid (Orkoid in \"Warhammer 40,000\") cousins, using them as servants, Human (Goblin) shields, or an emergency food source. They worship a pair of gods known as Gork and Mork (other gods were included in earlier editions of the game, but are no longer included), one of which is described as brutally cunning and the other as cunningly brutal, though the orcs themselves do not seem to know which is which. In \"Warhammer 40,000\", orks develop from a fungus-like beginning. They are spread by spores which are emitted constantly during an ork's lifetime and are all expelled when it dies.\n\nOrcs are one of the most important races in the \"Warcraft\" computer game series. Originally presented as a race of typically savage monsters, more recent Warcraft games have revised their image into that of \"savage but noble\" warriors and shamans. Orcs originally hailed from the world of Draenor until the majority of the clans were tricked into serving a force of world-destroying demons, named the Burning Legion. Under the Legion's influence, the Orcish Horde slaughtered their onetime allies the Draenei and then were mystically transported to Azeroth to conquer it in the Legion's name. After two devastating wars, the orcs were finally defeated by the Human Alliance and rounded up into internment camps. They remained there until a young orc who had been raised by humans named Thrall (birth name Go'el), rallied them together and freed the bulk of the Horde from the influence of the demons. Thrall then founded a new Horde on the principles of strength and honor, hoping to reclaim the orcs' noble heritage.\n\n\"Warcraft\" orcs are humanoid, but prodigiously muscled, with broad noses and distinctive tusked mouths. There are many tribes of Orc, each one being specialized: Frostwolves serves as cavalry with their dire wolves, while the Shadowmoon clan provides powerful shamans. The Orcs originally had brown skin, but demonic corruption turned it green, and further demonic influence can turn it red. Male Orcs are significantly larger than humans, around tall when standing straight, however most male Orcs have a hunched back. Females, which first appeared as playable characters in \"World of Warcraft\", are slightly larger than a human female and while much more slender than their male counterparts, are nonetheless well-muscled. The tusks of female orcs are very small, and are arguably more exaggerated canines than tusks. Orc warriors wear little armor but have horned helmets and carry wielding axes. \"Warcraft\" is one of the few settings in which orcs are not inherently evil and, after significant plot developments in the latest \"Warcraft\" games, can even be heroic. One could consider the orcs to be unfairly treated by humans and not only misunderstood, but vilified. The humans' enmity and prejudice towards the Orcs can be traced back to the first and second invasions and could be partially justified, as it was orcs under the control of the Burning Legion that invaded. Despite the best efforts of reformist orcs (such as Thrall) to usher in an era of peace between humans and orcs, humankind's suspicions towards the orcs are further exacerbated by the bellicose and expansionist attitudes of parts of orc society, such as the Warsong Clan, who encroach upon the ancestral territories of the Night Elves, the allies of the humans. Thrall's orcs have occasionally formed successful alliances with humans.\n\nTheir political standpoint in the \"Warcraft\" universe is set as being the leading race of the Horde, an association of races created to promote mutual survival. The trolls, a similar race in the game, partially live in the same area as the orcs and are also scattered around Azeroth, where most live in the wilderness.\n\nIn Heroes of the Storm, Blizzard MOBA game, players can control several Orc heroes from \"Warcraft\" universe such as Thrall, Garrosh, Gul'dan, and Rehgar.\n\nIn the fantasy series The Harrow, author Philip Mazza includes a race of orcs or the \"Gulguthra\" in the ancient tongue. The \"Gulguthra\" are members of the Brood, or \"En' Rauko,\" an evil race of creatures that occupy a post-apocalypse fantasy world. Early in \"The Harrow: From Under a Tree\", Mazza describes the race of brood through the eyes of two Balor Guild felines, Lil' Man and Chumsey: \" . . . The cats were now able to clearly see the worm brood below as they gathered throughout the city: Cu Sith or Black Dogs, great black beasts, shaped like a hound, yet larger than any hound that ever lived, with eyes that shined white in darkness; Fachens, hideous muscular creatures, man-like in stature, these were monsters known for their despicable acts and a desire to inflict severe pain and suffering on their enemies; Trolls, dim-witted brutish hulks, ugly with a rubbery moss-green hide and quite evil, they fed on anything they come across; Firbolgs, a deformed race of man, possessing surprising strength with bent legs and arms and hunched backs, they were dark-skinned with long hair kept back and thick black beards, and it was said they were remnants of primitive man; Orcs or the \"Gulguthra\" in the ancient tongue, large creatures slightly stooped in posture, a low jutting forehead and a snout instead of a nose, and coarse hair covering ray-green skin, with eyes a reddish tint and well developed canine teeth and short pointed ears . . .\" . \n\nIn the fantasy role-playing games \"Earthdawn\" and \"Shadowrun\", orks are neither good nor evil. In \"Earthdawn\" they have their own place among the other name-giving races: humans, dwarfs, elves, obsidimen, T'skrang, trolls and windlings.\n\nIn \"Shadowrun\", the orks are one subspecies of \"Homo sapiens\" among others living on post-2011 Earth. They emerged during the Unexplained Genetic Expression in 2021, as either young humans transformed into orks, or babies that were born as orks from human parents. They are categorized as \"Homo sapiens robustus\" and are considered to be metahumans, like trolls, elves, and dwarfs. They are able to interbreed with humans and other fellow metahumans. Despite this, their offspring (like the offspring of all inter-racial metahuman matings in Shadowrun) is of the race of only one of their parents. Being an ork is due to the expression of a gene, and thus half-breeds do not exist. They grow much faster than humans, reach maturity at 12, and give birth to a litter of about four children, though six to eight are not uncommon. Their average life-expectancy is about 35 to 40 years. They are physically larger and stronger than humans and their mental capacities are considered slightly inferior, though they are still not as dull as the average troll.\n\nIn the collectible card game \"\", Orcs were originally portrayed as cowardly warriors who rely on the smaller, less intelligent Goblins when waging warfare. Very few creatures of the Orc type have been printed: most of them appeared in the \"\" and \"\" expansion sets. While Orcs were reprinted in more recent core sets, they never appeared in any subsequent expansion sets until \"\", which introduced more Orc cards, along with a legendary Orc Shaman: Sek'kuar, Deathkeeper. In the recent set Khans of Tarkir, 7 new Orc cards have been introduced, including a legendary Orc Warrior: Zurgo Helmsmasher. With this new set, they seem to be changing the portrayal of Orcs from cowardly warriors to extremely formidable warriors that are very powerful, but highly reckless in battle.\n\nWithin the universe of the \"Might and Magic\" franchise, orcs are portrayed as orange, green, or brown. In \"Heroes of Might and Magic\", they are associated with the Barbarian faction.\n\nIn Ashan, the orcs are orange, extremely muscular humanoids, that were created by wizards (by fusing demon blood with human flesh) to be used as shock troops against a demon invasion. In \"Dark Messiah\", a player spends a significant amount of time facing members of the Redskull Clan, a group of orcs living on an island that is important to the plot. They are led by a shaman (which is implied by a conversation between two orcs to be a popularly elected position) and make references to worshiping an unnamed fire goddess. In \"\", the mainland orcs are modelled after the Mongols, are led by a khan and worship a personified Father Sky.\n\nIn Hasbro's \"Heroscape\" line of game products, Orcs come from the pre-historic planet Grut and are thus known as Grut Orcs. They are blue-skinned, with prominent tusks or horns protruding from their chins or cheeks. They are slightly smaller than humans, except for the elite heavy gruts, which are the size of a normal human. Several Orc champions ride prehistoric animals (including a \"Tyrannosaurus Rex\", a \"Velociraptor\" and sabre-tooth tigers, known as Swogs, indicating that the Orcs are accomplished animal tamers.\n\nIn Tamriel, orcs are humanoids distantly related to their contemporary elves and are noted for their unshakable courage in battle, and barbaric history. Although now integrated into Imperial culture, Orcs still retain their barbaric nature, with many citizens of Tamriel reluctant to accept them as true members of society. They have large under-teeth that protrude from the bottom jaw out from their mouths. One of the taller races of the \"Elder Scrolls\" series, they are, contrary to other renditions, not muscle-bound and war-like, but are still significantly bulkier than most other races. They are distinguishable by their green skin. The orcs, or Orsimer (meaning 'the Pariah Folk' in the elven language), are a strain of descendants of the original elven race. The Orsimer were followers of the god Trinimac, but transformed from gold-skinned elves to green-skinned orcs when Trinimac was transformed into the Daedric Prince Malacath by Boethiah, the Daedric Prince of deceit and treachery. The Orcs now worship Malacath as their chief god. Originally a society of marauders prone to pillaging human settlements in the provinces of High Rock and Hammerfell, the orcs suffered a series of crushing defeats from the humans throughout the centuries; eventually, relations between orcs and humans improved considerably and the orcs have become respected members of the Empire's society (they get along with humans better than Tamriel's elves do, as the elves are susceptible to attempts at conquering the humans). However, most citizens of Tamriel are reluctant to accept Orcs into society, due to their barbaric history. Another unique quality about the Orcs in the \"Elder Scrolls\" is that they are talented smiths and excellent rank-and-file soldiers, traits that are generally attributed to dwarves. It is said that Orc troops in heavy armor are among the fiercest warriors in Tamriel, and they are known for their Berserker Rage. Though a constant in the \"Elder Scrolls\" series is the cultural assimilation of various fantasy races into whichever area they happen to live, there also exist isolated strongholds of Orcs dedicated to preserving the 'old ways' of their cultural heritage.\n\n\n"}

He was appointed lieutenant in the 65th Battery of the Canadian Field Artillery. He was later transferred to the 14th Brigade. In France, Armstrong served as an engineer. His duty was to ensure that the Canadian Expeditionary Force received an adequate supply of water. In 1918 he was awarded the Military Cross at a ceremony in Buckingham Palace for distinguished action under enemy fire.\n\nIn 1919, Armstrong became the first Town Manager of Woodstock, New Brunswick. In 1923 he married Muriel Smith of Woodstock. They would have two children. That same year he went to work for the Citizens Research Institute of Canada, where he was employed as a consultant for public and industrial groups, including hospitals. His consulting work involved making administrative surveys and playing an active role in administrative reorganization. In 1924 he was appointed acting Superintendent of Victoria Hospital in London, Ontario. He later returned to municipal management as Town Manager of Windsor, Nova Scotia.\n\nIn 1924, Kingston General Hospital suffered from a number of personnel and management problems. Based on the recommendation of Dr. Horace Brittain, the hospital's Board of Governors decided to appoint someone with an administrative background rather than a medical one to run the hospital. Brittain also recommended that Armstrong be interviewed for the position. In March 1925, Armstrong was appointed Superintendent of Kingston General Hospital.\n\nArmstrong was able to balanced the hospital's budget while maintaining and adding new services. He led the hospital through the Great Depression and World War II. Due to decreasing patient incomes during the Depression, Armstrong developed the Community Cooperative Group Hospital Plan, Ontario's first public health insurance plan. To help offset the reduction of rates caused by the Depression, In 1932, Armstrong and the entire hospital staff donated five percent of the salaries to the hospital. In 1942 he introduced a ten-year plan to expand the hospital. The expansion included the construction of the Victory Wing, which included the first cancer clinic in Ontario, a dietary wing, the Walter T. Connell Wing, and a children’s hospital. Armstrong retired from KGH in 1957, but stayed on as a consultant until the construction projects were completed.\n\nWhile at KGH, Armstrong was president of the Ontario Hospital Association and the Canadian Hospital Association, as well as was a fellow of the American College of Hospital Administrators.\n\nAfter his retirement, Armstrong became a member of the Board of Governors of Kingston General Hospital. In 1976 KHG's outpatient building, the Fraser Armstrong Patient Centre, was named in his honor. He also worked as a representative of the Montreal Trust Company.\n\nIn September 1983, Armstrong moved into a retirement home in Kingston, Ontario. He died on October 11, 1983 from burns he suffered in a fire at the retirement home. He was 94 years old.\n"}

He worked for AVC News agency and \"Proceso\" and \"Cuartoscuro\" magazines. He covered daily news and social protests. He documented several protests where individuals were assaulted. Espinosa was killed in Narvate, Mexico City, Mexico along with four women.\n\nEspinosa was born in Mexico City, Mexico.\n\nFor the majority of his career, Espinosa concentrated on social movements and protests. As a self-taught photographer and journalist, he began his career with Eclipse Photo in Mexico City, Mexico. While with Eclipse Photo, his primary job was photography. In 2009, he was hired by Javier Duarte during his campaign as governor. Espinosa also worked in Xalapa, Mexico for seven years. Xalapa is considered one of the most dangerous place to practice journalism. Espinosa's interest in social movements led him find employment elsewhere. In Veracruz, Espinosa became a correspondent for \"Proceso\" and \"Cuartoscuro\" magazines. During his employment with the magazine, Espinosa voiced his opinion regarding the treatment journalists in Mexico.\n\nBefore his death, Espinosa had received deadly threats. Espinosa began to receive threats towards him after the release of a photo of Duarte. During a social protest Espinosa was grabbed and told to quit taking photos or else he would end up like other dead journalists. Espinosa had also previously reported men standing outside his house and giving him intimidating glares and gestures. In June 2015, Espinosa decided to leave Veracruz and return to Mexico City. He reported experiencing symptoms of PTSD. Espinosa left his friends and even his dog Cosmos in Veracruz to find safety in Mexico City, which was a known refuge for journalists.\n\nEspinosa was found dead on 31 July 2015 with four female victims. All five were found beaten and shot execution style. The victims also had various signs of torture on their bodies. The women who were found had all been sexually assaulted by the culprits. The names of the women were not released at the time until days later. The authorities believe that deaths occurred between 9 a.m. and 3 p.m. A final text message was placed by Espinosa at 2:13 p.m.\n\nVideo surveillance caught three suspects walking out of the apartment. One of the suspects took the car of a victim and drove off with it. The car was later found abandoned on the outskirts of Mexico City. The case was viewed as a burglary due to the various objects taken from the residence. In August 2015, an unnamed serial rapist was arrested for the deaths of the victims. His fingerprints matched up to the evidence found in the apartment. There is still an ongoing investigation for the other two suspects caught on the surveillance video. The police department in charge of the investigation do have fifteen statements as well as evidence and photographs.\n\nEspinosa had reported threats being made towards him before his death. Espinosa had previously had several run ins with the law while covering several social movements. In 2012, Espinosa covered a student protest against Governor Javier Duarte during the anniversary of the revolution. During the protest Espinosa was grabbed and the man stated \"Stop taking pictures if you don't want to end up like Regina\". Regina Martinez Perez, was also a correspondent for \"Proceso\" and \"Cuartoscuro\" magazines. She had recently been killed after reporting on state official. Espinosa released a photograph of Governor Javier Duarte. The photograph showed Governor Duarte wearing a police cap and his stomach hanging over and below his belt. Espinosa received multiple threats after the release of the photograph. The governor was outraged by the photograph and article. He sent people to find and buy out all the prints released in various locations. Espinosa decided to flee Veracruz and find refugee in Mexico City, Mexico. His decision was made after seeing men standing outside of his house three separate times. He had reported that the men were giving him intimidating glances and gestures. On 31 July 2015 Espinosa was found alongside four other women. The women were identified as Nadia Vera, Yesenia Quiroz, Mile Virginia Martin, and Alejandra Negrete. His and the bodies of the women were all found killed execution style. Mile Virginia Marin was the last of the victims to be identified due to having a Colombian origin. Espinosa is the seventh journalist that has been killed in Mexico in the year 2015. Since 2011 under Javier Duarte's govern of Mexico 15 journalist have been killed. Regina Martinez Pérez, Miguel Angel Lopez Velasco, Yolanda Ordaz de la Cruz, and the other journalist who have been murdered all have one similar thing. All their murders have had no responsible culprit punished. Regina Martinez Pérez worked alongside Espinosa in the past and was murdered on 28 April 2012. According to Reporters without Borders, In 2014 Mexico was the named the 6th country in the world with high rates of journalist being killed. After the death of Espinosa protesters gathered holding cameras and signs that stated \"not one more\". The protesters also held signs stating \"How many more Javier Duarte?\". During his funeral journalist traveled to be present. They covered his grave with cameras. State and Legislative committees deal with the complaints made by reporters who has been attacked, harassed, or abused. However, nothing is ever resolved through the offices.\n\nAccording to Article 19, Espinosa is the 88th journalist that has been killed in Mexico. Espinosa decided to flee to Mexico City in seek of refugee. Until his death Mexico City was seen as a refugee for journalist who were being threatened. Citizens have become angry and disheartened at the lack of safety and protection Governor Duarte has provided for journalists. As a self-taught journalist and photographer, Espinosa was motivated and felt strongly about journalist rights in Mexico. However, after reporting and photographing several brutal attacks and protests Espinosa began to be a target of threats. After his death Mexico City was no longer a place safe for journalist seeking refugee. Hundreds of journalist and photographers from around the world published a letter in PEN America asking for a clear notice of what occurred that day and who was responsible. They urged for a further investigation into his death.\n\nAfter the death of Espinosa, several protesters have gathered in several different locations in his honor. In Mexico City a demonstration spread a network tag #JusticiaparaRubén to continue spreading his life story as well as his troubling death. A colleague of his stated \"He was both a photographer and activist...But most of all he was a great friend\". The Office of the High Commissioner For Human Rights (OHCHR) stated after the death of Espinosa: \"If the investigations confirm that this aberrant multiple homicide is related to Espinosa's work as a journalist, then we are in the presence of a grave act against freedom of expression\".\n\n"}

After she retired from the QAIMNS she was appointed as Matron-in-Chief of the Territorial Force Nursing Service. Browne was appointed Dame Grand Cross of the Order of the British Empire (GBE) in 1918.\n\nIn 1922 she became the first President of the Royal College of Nursing a post she held till 1925\n\nIn 1918, Browne told her nurses, 'Put a high ideal before you, and do your future service in a greater strength than your own, and your life will be for the betterment of the world.' \n\nBrowne lived in Cheltenham with her friend Hilda Hoole from 1927. Browne died on 13 August 1941, with her funeral taking place at St Stephen’s Church Cheltenham.\n\nIn December 2017 a blue plaque was unveiled at her former home, 11 Tivoli Road, by the Cheltenham Civic Society and the Royal College of Nursing. \n\nSidney Browne was born in Bexley. She grew up in a medical family, with a surgeon father and two brothers who were doctors.\n\nBrowne attended a series of lectures given by the pioneering district nurse Florence Lees which prompted her interest in nursing as a career. \n\nIn 1878 she briefly started nursing at the Guest Hospital, Dudley and later that year entered training at the District Hospital West Bromwich 1878-1882. In 1882 Browne worked as Staff Nurse at St Bartholomew's Hospital for a year, where she was influenced by the matron, Ethel Manson (later Mrs Ethel Gordon Fenwick). Browne was one of the first nurses registered with the British Nurses' Association on 7 March 1890, the precursor of the State Register of Nurses. \n\nIn 1883 Browne joined the Army Nursing Service, where she was posted to the Royal Victoria Hospital, Netley\nand in 1884 had her first overseas posting during the Egyptian War. For her work in the Sudan Wars she received the Khedive's Star and the Egyptian medal and bar (1885). Browne's postings took her to Malta (1887-1890), Ireland (Curragh Camp), Woolwich (Herbert Hospital) and Aldershot, rising steadily through the ranks. \n\nBrowne was posted to active service in the South African War from October 1899 where over the next three years she was superintending sister at three different base hospitals, for which she received the Royal Red Cross. Significant reforms of medical services led to the establishment of an army nursing service. In 1902 Browne was returned to England for her next post as the first Matron-in Chief of the newly created Queen Alexandra's Imperial Military Nursing Service (QAIMNS) - now Queen Alexandra's Royal Army Nursing Corps - where she introduced rigorous training procedures. She retired from the Army in 1906 at age 55, which gave her the time to be an active campaigner for the state registration of nurses. \n\nBrowne was still concerned about the lack of trained nurses available to the Army and with Elisabeth Haldane established the Territorial Force Nursing Service, a civilian trained nursing reserve, in 1908, for which she became Matron-in-Chief from 1910. With the outbreak of the First World War in 1914, Browne was responsible for the mobilisation of the Territorial Force Nursing Service, and its expansion from 3,000 to 7,000 nurses. Browne travelled across Britain and abroad inspecting living and working conditions of her nursing staff. \n\nIn 1916 Browne, who had long supported the nursing state registration bill, agreed that the time was right for a College of Nursing to be established. Both Browne and Sarah Swift had worked as Matron-in-Chief during the First World War, and both became actively involved in what was to become the Royal College of Nursing. Browne was a member of the first Royal College of Nursing Council from 1917 until her retirement in 1927 and was the first Honorary Treasurer of the College as well as the inaugural President. \n\nAt an investiture on 31 July 1919 Browne was recognised for her work in the First World War when she was appointed Dame Grand Cross (military division) of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire (GBE). She received many honours for her work including an honorary degree in 1925 from Leeds University, the freedom of West Bromwich; and in July 1927, she was awarded the International Florence Nightingale Medal by the League of Red Cross Societies. \n\n\n\n"}

In some jurisdictions, assisted suicide is legal.\n\nAn American expatriate who set up websites offering to help people make arrangements to kill themselves in Cambodia shut the sites down in 2005, saying he hoped to avoid problems with the authorities.\n\nA drug known as liquid pentobarbital is used by owners to euthanize pets. When given to humans, the drug can give them a painless death in under one hour. The pet shops across Mexico have such drugs. As a result, tourists from across the globe seeking to terminate their own lives were reported to be flying out to Mexico.\n\nCritics have claimed that the Dutch initiative for euthanasia will trigger a wave of \"euthanasia tourism\". However, a clause insisting on a well-established relationship between doctor and patient is designed to prevent this.\n\nRegulations were proposed to limit possibilities of legal suicide assistance for foreigners in Switzerland. The law primarily targeted Dignitas, one of two right-to-die groups in Switzerland assisting foreigners. The Swiss government rejected proposed stricter regulations in 2006, maintaining the \"status quo\" as regulated by Paragraph 115 of Swiss Criminal Code.\n\nAlthough the assisted suicide market is largely German, as of August 2015, approximately 300 British citizens had travelled to Switzerland from the UK to die at one of Dignitas' rented apartments in Zurich. The names of a few of these people are known, though most remain anonymous. By November 2008 the number of British members of Dignitas had risen to 725, a number exceeded only by Swiss and German membership. Given the size and population density of Europe, it is certain that there are Dignitas members in other European countries. Right-wing politicians in Switzerland have repeatedly criticized suicide assistance for foreigners, branding it \"suicide tourism\" (\"Sterbetourismus\" in German).\n\nIn 2007, Dignitas launched an effort to gain legal permission for healthy foreigners, including married couples committed to suicide pacts, to end their lives in Switzerland.\n\nIn July 2009, British conductor Sir Edward Downes and his wife Joan died together at a suicide clinic outside Zürich \"under circumstances of their own choosing.\" Sir Edward was not terminally ill, but his wife was diagnosed with rapidly developing cancer.\n\nIn March 2010, the PBS Frontline TV program in the United States showed a documentary called \"The Suicide Tourist\" which told the story of Professor Craig Ewert, his family, and Dignitas, and their decision to commit assisted suicide in Switzerland after he was diagnosed and suffering with ALS (Lou Gehrig's Disease).\n\nIn a referendum on 15 May 2011, voters in the Canton of Zurich have overwhelmingly rejected calls to ban assisted suicide or to outlaw the practice for non-residents. Out of more than 278,000 ballots cast, the initiative to ban assisted suicide was rejected by 85% of voters and the initiative to outlaw it for foreigners was turned down by 78%.\n\nIn 2009, the British Parliament said it would consider an amendment to a bill that would allow suicide tourism by not charging people with assisting suicide when they take their loved ones to another nation to kill themselves. Britain has a law banning assisted suicide, but it hasn't been enforced in those cases.\n\nIn 1997, the Oregon Death with Dignity Act went into effect. In 2008, Washington state passed their law which was then implemented in 2009. Laws may only be implemented by licensed physicians based on the individual needs of qualified patients. Patients must meet state requirements to be eligible for euthanasia.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "10177677", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10177677", "title": "Tamam Shud case", "text": "Tamam Shud case\n\nThe Tamam Shud case, also known as the Mystery of the Somerton Man, is an unsolved case of an unidentified man found dead at 6:30 am, 1 December 1948, on Somerton beach, Glenelg, just south of Adelaide, South Australia. It is named after the Persian phrase \"tamám shud\", meaning \"ended\" or \"finished\", printed on a scrap of paper found months later in the fob pocket of the man's trousers. The scrap had been torn from the final page of a copy of \"Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam\", authored by 12th-century poet Omar Khayyám. \"Tamam\" was misspelt as \"Taman\" in many early reports and this error has often been repeated, leading to confusion about the name in the media.\n\nFollowing a public appeal by police, the book from which the page had been torn was located. On the inside back cover, detectives were able to read – in indentations from handwriting – a local telephone number, another unidentified number and a text that resembled an encrypted message. The text has not been deciphered or interpreted in a way that satisfies authorities on the case.\n\nThe case has been considered, since the early stages of the police investigation, \"one of Australia's most profound mysteries\". There has been intense speculation ever since regarding the identity of the victim, the cause of his death and the events leading up to it. Public interest in the case remains significant for several reasons: the death occurred at a time of heightened international tensions following the beginning of the Cold War; the apparent involvement of a secret code; the possible use of an undetectable poison; and the inability of authorities to identify the dead man.\n\nIn addition to intense public interest in Australia during the late 1940s and early 1950s, the Tamam Shud case also attracted international attention. South Australian Police consulted their counterparts overseas and distributed information about the dead man internationally, in an effort to identify him. International circulation of a photograph of the man and details of his fingerprints yielded no positive identification. For example, in the United States, the FBI was unable to match the dead man's fingerprint with prints taken from files of domestic criminals. Scotland Yard was also asked to assist with the case, but could not offer any insights.\n\nIn recent years new evidence has emerged, including an old identification card possibly identifying the Somerton Man as one H. C. Reynolds and an ongoing DNA analysis of hair roots found on the plaster bust.\n\nOn 1 December 1948 at 6:30 am, the police were contacted after the body of a man was discovered on Somerton beach near Glenelg, about 11 kilometres (6.8 mi) southwest of Adelaide, South Australia. The man was found lying in the sand across from the Crippled Children's Home, which was on the corner of The Esplanade and Bickford Terrace. He was lying back with his head resting against the seawall, with his legs extended and his feet crossed. It was believed he had died while sleeping. An unlit cigarette was on the right collar of his coat. A search of his pockets revealed an unused second-class rail ticket from Adelaide to Henley Beach, a bus ticket from the city that could not be proved to have been used, a narrow aluminium American comb, a half-empty packet of Juicy Fruit chewing gum, an Army Club cigarette packet containing seven cigarettes of a different brand, and a quarter-full box of Bryant & May matches.\n\nWitnesses who came forward said that on the evening of 30 November, they had seen an individual resembling the dead man lying on his back in the same spot and position near the Crippled Children's Home where the corpse was later found. A couple who saw him at around 7 pm noted that they saw him extend his right arm to its fullest extent and then drop it limply. Another couple who saw him from 7:30 pm to 8 pm, during which time the street lights had come on, recounted that they did not see him move during the half an hour in which he was in view, although they did have the impression that his position had changed. Although they commented between themselves that he must be dead because he was not reacting to the mosquitoes, they had thought it more likely that he was drunk or asleep, and thus did not investigate further. One of the witnesses told the police she observed a man looking down at the sleeping man from the top of the steps that lead to the beach. Witnesses said the body was in the same position when the police viewed it.\n\nAnother witness came forward in 1959 and reported to the police that he and three others had seen a well-dressed man carrying another man on his shoulders along Somerton Beach the night before the body was found. A police report was made by Detective Don O'Doherty.\n\nAccording to the pathologist, John Burton Cleland, the man was of \"Britisher\" appearance and thought to be aged about 40–45; he was in \"top physical condition\". He was \"180 centimetres (5 ft 11 in) tall, with grey eyes, fair to ginger-coloured hair, slightly grey around the temples, with broad shoulders and a narrow waist, hands and nails that showed no signs of manual labour, big and little toes that met in a wedge shape, like those of a dancer or someone who wore boots with pointed toes; and pronounced high calf muscles consistent with people who regularly wore boots or shoes with high heels or performed ballet. He was dressed in a white shirt; a red, white and blue tie; brown trousers; socks and shoes; a brown knitted pullover and fashionable grey and brown double-breasted jacket of reportedly \"American\" tailoring. All labels on his clothes had been removed, and he had no hat (unusual for 1948) or wallet. The body was clean-shaven and carried no identification, which led police to believe he had committed suicide. His teeth did not match the dental records of any known living person. Coroner Cleland remarked that if the body had been carried to its final resting place then \"all the difficulties would disappear\".\nAn autopsy was conducted, and the pathologist estimated the time of death at around 2 a.m. on 1 December. The heart was of normal size, and normal in every way ...small vessels not commonly observed in the brain were easily discernible with congestion. There was congestion of the pharynx, and the gullet was covered with whitening of superficial layers of the mucosa with a patch of ulceration in the middle of it. The stomach was deeply congested... There was congestion in the second half of the duodenum. There was blood mixed with the food in the stomach. Both kidneys were congested, and the liver contained a great excess of blood in its vessels. ...The spleen was strikingly large ... about 3 times normal size ... there was destruction of the centre of the liver lobules revealed under the microscope. ... acute gastritis hemorrhage, extensive congestion of the liver and spleen, and the congestion to the brain.\n\nThe autopsy showed that the man's last meal was a pasty eaten three to four hours before death, but tests failed to reveal any foreign substance in the body. The pathologist Dr. Dwyer concluded: \"I am quite convinced the death could not have been natural ... the poison I suggested was a barbiturate or a soluble hypnotic\". Although poisoning remained a prime suspicion, the pasty was not believed to be the source of the poison. Other than that, the coroner was unable to reach a conclusion as to the man's identity, cause of death, or whether the man seen alive at Somerton Beach on the evening of 30 November was the same man, as nobody had seen his face at that time. The body was then embalmed on 10 December 1948 after the police were unable to get a positive identification. The police said this was the first time they knew that such action was needed.\n\nOn 14 January 1949, staff at the Adelaide railway station discovered a brown suitcase with its label removed, which had been checked into the station cloakroom after 11:00 a.m. on 30 November 1948. It was believed that the suitcase was owned by the man found on the beach. In the case were a red checked dressing gown; a size-seven, red felt pair of slippers; four pairs of underpants; pyjamas; shaving items; a light brown pair of trousers with sand in the cuffs; an electrician's screwdriver; a table knife cut down into a short sharp instrument; a pair of scissors with sharpened points; a small square of zinc thought to have been used as a protective sheath for the knife and scissors and a stencilling brush, as used by third officers on merchant ships for stencilling cargo.\n\nAlso in the suitcase was a thread card of Barbour brand orange waxed thread of \"an unusual type\" not available in Australia—it was the same as that used to repair the lining in a pocket of the trousers the dead man was wearing. All identification marks on the clothes had been removed but police found the name \"T. Keane\" on a tie, \"Keane\" on a laundry bag and \"Kean\" (without the last e) on a singlet, along with three dry-cleaning marks; 1171/7, 4393/7 and 3053/7. Police believed that whoever removed the clothing tags either overlooked these three items or purposely left the \"Keane\" tags on the clothes, knowing Keane was not the dead man's name. With wartime rationing still enforced, clothing was difficult to acquire at that time. Although it was a very common practice to use name tags, it was also common when buying secondhand clothing to remove the tags of the previous owner/s. What was unusual was that there were no spare socks found in the case, and no correspondence, despite that the police found pencils and unused letter stationery.\n\nA search concluded that there was no T. Keane missing in any English-speaking country and a nationwide circulation of the dry-cleaning marks also proved fruitless. In fact, all that could be garnered from the suitcase was that the front gusset and featherstitching on a coat found in the case indicated it had been manufactured in the United States. The coat had not been imported, indicating the man had been to the United States or bought the coat from someone of similar size who had been.\n\nPolice checked incoming train records and believed the man had arrived at the Adelaide railway station by overnight train from either Melbourne, Sydney or Port Augusta. They speculated he had showered and shaved at the adjacent City Baths (there was no Baths ticket on his body) before returning to the train station to purchase a ticket for the 10:50 a.m. train to Henley Beach, which, for whatever reason, he missed or did not catch. He immediately checked his suitcase at the station cloak room before leaving the station and catching a city bus to Glenelg. Although named the City Baths, the centre was not a public bathing facility but a public swimming pool. The railway station bathing facilities were adjacent to the station cloak room, which itself was adjacent to the station's southern exit onto North Terrace. The City Baths on King William St. were accessed from the station's northern exit via a lane way. There is no record of the station's bathroom facilities being unavailable on the day he arrived.\n\nAn inquest into the death, conducted by coroner Thomas Erskine Cleland, commenced a few days after the body was found but was adjourned until 17 June 1949. The investigating pathologist John Burton Cleland re-examined the body and made a number of discoveries. Cleland noted that the man's shoes were remarkably clean and appeared to have been recently polished, rather than being in the state expected of the shoes of a man who had apparently been wandering around Glenelg all day. He added that this evidence fitted in with the theory that the body might have been brought to Somerton beach after the man's death, accounting for the lack of evidence of vomiting and convulsions, which are the two main effects of poison.\n\nThomas Cleland speculated that as none of the witnesses could positively identify the man they saw the previous night as being the same person discovered the next morning, there remained the possibility the man had died elsewhere and had been dumped. He stressed that this was purely speculation as all the witnesses believed it was \"definitely the same person\" as the body was in the same place and lying in the same distinctive position. He also found there was no evidence as to who the deceased was.\n\nCedric Stanton Hicks, Professor of physiology and pharmacology at the University of Adelaide, testified that of a group of drugs, variants of a drug in that group he called \"number 1\" and in particular \"number 2\" were extremely toxic in a relatively small oral dose that would be extremely difficult if not impossible to identify even if it had been suspected in the first instance. He gave the coroner a piece of paper with the names of the two drugs which was entered as Exhibit C.18. The names were not released to the public until the 1980s as at the time they were \"quite easily procurable by the ordinary individual\" from a chemist without the need to give a reason for the purchase. (The drugs were later publicly identified as digitalis and ouabain, both of which are cardenolide-type cardiac glycosides). He noted the only \"fact\" not found in relation to the body was evidence of vomiting. He then stated its absence was not unknown but that he could not make a \"frank conclusion\" without it. Hicks stated that if death had occurred seven hours after the man was last seen to move, it would imply a massive dose that could still have been undetectable. It was noted that the movement seen by witnesses at 7 p.m. could have been the last convulsion preceding death.\n\nEarly in the inquiry, Cleland stated \"I would be prepared to find that he died from poison, that the poison was probably a glucoside and that it was not accidentally administered; but I cannot say whether it was administered by the deceased himself or by some other person.\" Despite these findings, he could not determine the cause of death of the Somerton Man, and after the inquest, a plaster cast was made of the man's head and shoulders. The lack of success in determining the identity and cause of death of the Somerton Man had led authorities to call it an \"unparalleled mystery\" and believe that the cause of death might never be known.\n\nAround the same time as the inquest, a tiny piece of rolled-up paper with the words \"Tamam Shud\" printed on it was found in a fob pocket sewn within the dead man's trouser pocket. Public library officials called in to translate the text identified it as a phrase meaning \"ended\" or \"finished\" found on the last page of the \"Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam\". The paper's verso side was blank. Police conducted an Australia-wide search to find a copy of the book that had a similarly blank verso. A photograph of the scrap of paper was released to the press.\n\nFollowing a public appeal by police, the copy of the \"Rubaiyat\" from which the page had been torn was located. A man showed police a 1941 edition of Edward FitzGerald's (1859) translation of the \"Rubaiyat\", published by Whitcombe and Tombs in Christchurch, New Zealand. Detective Sergeant Lionel Leane, who led the initial investigation, often protected the privacy of witnesses in public statements by using pseudonyms; Leane referred to the man who found the book by the pseudonym \"Ronald Francis\" and he has never been officially identified. \"Francis\" had not considered that the book might be connected to the case until he had seen an article in the previous day's newspaper. On the inside back cover of the book, detectives identified indentations from handwriting. These included a telephone number, an unidentified number, and a text that resembled an encrypted message. According to statements by police, the book was found in the rear footwell of a car, at about the same time that the body of the unidentified man had been found.\n\nThere is some uncertainty about the circumstances under which the book was found. One newspaper article refers to the book being found about a week or two before the body was found. Former South Australian Police detective Gerry Feltus (who dealt with the matter as a cold case), reports that the book was found \"just after that man was found on the beach at Somerton\". The timing is significant as the man is presumed, based on the suitcase, to have arrived in Adelaide the day before he was found on the beach. If the book was found one or two weeks before, it suggests that the man had visited previously or had been in Adelaide for a longer period. Most accounts state that the book was found in an unlocked car parked in Jetty Road, Glenelg – either in the rear floor well, or on the back seat.\n\nThe theme of the \"Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam\" is that one should live life to the fullest and have no regrets when it ends. The poem's subject led police to theorise that the man had committed suicide by poison, although there was no other evidence to back the theory. The book was missing the words \"Tamám Shud\" on the last page, which had a blank reverse, and microscopic tests indicated that the piece of paper was from the page torn from the book. Also, In the back of the book were faint indentations representing five lines of text, in capital letters. The second line has been struck out – a fact that is considered significant, due to its similarities to the fourth line and the possibility that it represents an error in encryption.\n\n<poem>WRGOABABD\nMLIAOI\nWTBIMPANETP\nMLIABOAIAQC\nITTMTSAMSTGAB</poem>\n\nIn the book it is unclear whether the first line begins with an \"M\" or \"W\", but it is widely believed to be the letter W, owing to the distinctive difference when compared to the stricken letter M. There appears to be a deleted or underlined line of text that reads \"MLIAOI\". Although the last character in this line of text looks like an \"L\", it is fairly clear on closer inspection of the image that this is formed from an 'I' and the extension of the line used to delete or underline that line of text. Also, the other \"L\" has a curve to the bottom part of the character. There is also an \"X\" above the last 'O' in the code, and it is not known if this is significant to the code or not. Initially, the letters were thought to be words in a foreign language before it was realised it was a code. Code experts were called in at the time to decipher the lines but were unsuccessful. In 1978, following a request from ABC-TV journalist Stuart Littlemore, Department of Defence cryptographers analysed the handwritten text. The cryptographers reported that it would be impossible to provide \"a satisfactory answer\": if the text was an encrypted message, its brevity meant that it had \"insufficient symbols\", from which a clear meaning could be extracted, and the text could be the \"meaningless\" product of a \"disturbed mind\".\n\nAn unlisted telephone number was also found in the back of the book, belonging to a nurse named Jessica Ellen \"Jo\" Thomson (1921–2007) – born Jessie Harkness in the Sydney suburb of Marrickville – who lived in Moseley St, Glenelg, about north of the location where the body was found. When she was interviewed by police, Thomson said that she did not know the dead man or why he would have her phone number and choose to visit her suburb on the night of his death. However, she also reported that, at some time in late 1948, an unidentified man had attempted to visit her and asked a next door neighbour about her. In his book on the case, Gerry Feltus stated that when he interviewed Thomson (2002), he found that she was either being \"evasive\" or she \"just did not wish to talk about it\". Feltus believed Thomson knew the Somerton man's identity. Thomson's daughter Kate, in a television interview (2014) with \"60 Minutes\", also said that she believed her mother knew the dead man.\n\nIn 1949, Jessica Thomson requested that police not keep a permanent record of her name or release her details to third parties, as it would be embarrassing and harmful to her reputation to be linked to such a case. The police agreed – a decision that hampered later investigations. In news media, books and other discussions of the case, Thomson was frequently referred to by various pseudonyms, including the nickname \"Jestyn\" and names such as \"Teresa Johnson née Powell\". Gerry Feltus (2010) claimed he was given permission by Thomson's family to disclose her names and that of her husband, Prosper Thomson. Nevertheless, the names Feltus used in his book were pseudonyms. Feltus also stated that her family did not know of her connection with the case, and he agreed not to disclose her identity or anything that might reveal it. Her real name was considered important as the possibility exists that it may be the decryption key for the purported code.\n\nWhen she was shown the plaster cast bust of the dead man by Detective Sergeant Leane, Thomson said she could not identify the person depicted. According to Leane, he described her reaction upon seeing the cast as \"completely taken aback, to the point of giving the appearance that she was about to faint\". In an interview many years later, Paul Lawson – the technician who made the cast and was present when Thomson viewed it – noted that after looking at the bust she immediately looked away and would not look at it again.\n\nThomson also said that while she was working at Royal North Shore Hospital in Sydney during World War II, she had owned a copy of the \"Rubaiyat\". In 1945, at the Clifton Gardens Hotel in Sydney, she had given it to an army lieutenant named Alf Boxall, who was serving at the time in the Water Transport Section of the Royal Australian Engineers. Thomson told police that, after the war ended, she had moved to Melbourne and married. She said that she had received a letter from Boxall and had replied, telling him that she was now married. (Subsequent research suggests that her future husband, Prosper Thomson, was in the process of obtaining a divorce from his first wife in 1949, and that he did not marry Jessica Harkness until mid-1950. There is no evidence that Boxall had any contact with Harkness after 1945.\n\nAs a result of their conversations with Thomson, police suspected that Boxall was the dead man. However, in July 1949, he was found in Sydney and the final page of his copy of the \"Rubaiyat\" (reportedly a 1924 edition published in Sydney) was intact, with the words \"Tamam Shud\" still in place. Boxall was now working in the maintenance section at the Randwick Bus Depot (where he had worked before the war) and was unaware of any link between the dead man and himself. In the front of the copy of the \"Rubaiyat\" that was given to Boxall, Jessica Harkness (as she was at the time) had signed herself \"JEstyn\" and written out verse 70:\n<poem>\nIndeed, indeed, Repentance oft before\nI swore—but was I sober when I swore?\nAnd then and then came Spring, and Rose-in-hand\nMy thread-bare Penitence a-pieces tore.\n</poem>\nThere has been persistent speculation that the dead man was a spy, due to the circumstances and historical context of his death. One such theory concerns Alf Boxall, who was reportedly involved in intelligence work during and immediately after World War II. In a 1978 television interview Stuart Littlemore asks: \"Mr Boxall, you had been working, hadn't you, in an intelligence unit, before you met this young woman [Jessica Harkness]. Did you talk to her about that at all?\" In reply, Boxall says \"no\", and when asked if Harkness could have known, Boxall replies \"not unless somebody else told her.\" When Littlemore suggests in the interview that there may have been an espionage connection to the dead man in Adelaide, Boxall replies: \"It's quite a melodramatic thesis, isn't it?\" Boxall's army service record suggests that he served initially in the 4th Water Transport Company, before being seconded to the North Australia Observer Unit (NAOU) – a special operations unit – and that during his time with NAOU, Boxall rose rapidly in rank, being promoted from Lance Corporal to Lieutenant within three months.\n\nIn 1949, the body of the unknown man was buried in Adelaide's West Terrace Cemetery, where The Salvation Army conducted the service. The South Australian Grandstand Bookmakers Association paid for the service to save the man from a pauper's burial. \nYears after the burial, flowers began appearing on the grave. Police questioned a woman seen leaving the cemetery but she claimed she knew nothing of the man. About the same time, Ina Harvey, the receptionist from the Strathmore Hotel opposite Adelaide railway station, revealed that a strange man had stayed in Room 21 or 23 for a few days around the time of the death, checking out on 30 November 1948. She recalled that he was English speaking and only carrying a small black case, not unlike one a musician or a doctor might carry. When an employee looked inside the case he told Harvey he had found an object inside the case he described as looking like a 'needle.'\n\nOn 22 November 1959 it was reported that an E.B. Collins, an inmate of New Zealand's Wanganui Prison, claimed to know the identity of the dead man.\n\nThere have been numerous unsuccessful attempts in the 60 years since its discovery to crack the letters found at the rear of the book, including efforts by military and naval intelligence, mathematicians, and amateur code crackers. In 2004, retired detective Gerry Feltus suggested in a \"Sunday Mail\" article that the final line \"ITTMTSAMSTGAB\" could stand for the initials of \"It's Time To Move To South Australia Moseley Street...\" (the former nurse lived in Moseley Street which is the main road through Glenelg). A 2014 analysis by computational linguist John Rehling strongly supports the theory that the letters consist of the initials of some English text, but finds no match for these in a large survey of literature, and concludes that the letters were likely written as a form of shorthand, not as a code, and that the original text can likely never be determined.\n\nThe Australian Broadcasting Corporation, in its documentary series \"Inside Story\", in 1978 produced a programme on the Tamam Shud case, entitled \"The Somerton Beach Mystery\", where reporter Stuart Littlemore investigated the case, including interviewing Boxall, who could add no new information on the case, and Paul Lawson, who made the plaster cast of the body, and who refused to answer a question about whether anyone had positively identified the body.\n\nIn 1994 John Harber Phillips, Chief Justice of Victoria and Chairman of the Victorian Institute of Forensic Medicine, reviewed the case to determine the cause of death and concluded that \"There seems little doubt it was digitalis.\" Phillips supported his conclusion by pointing out that the organs were engorged, consistent with digitalis, the lack of evidence of natural disease and \"the absence of anything seen macroscopically which could account for the death\".\n\nFormer South Australian Chief Superintendent Len Brown, who worked on the case in the 1940s, stated that he believed that the man was from a country in the Warsaw Pact, which led to the police's inability to confirm the man's identity.\n\nThe South Australian Police Historical Society holds the bust, which contains strands of the man's hair. Any further attempts to identify the body have been hampered by the embalming formaldehyde having destroyed much of the man's DNA. Other key evidence no longer exists, such as the brown suitcase, which was destroyed in 1986. In addition, witness statements have disappeared from the police file over the years.\n\nA number of possible identifications have been proposed over the years. An Adelaide newspaper, \"The Advertiser\", on reporting the discovery of the body, gave the possible identification as \"E.C. Johnson, about 45, of Arthur St, Payneham\". The following day, 3 December 1948, Johnson identified himself at a police station. That same day, another Adelaide newspaper, \"The News\", published a photograph of the dead man on its front page, leading to additional calls from members of the public about the possible identity of the dead man. By 4 December, police had announced that the man's fingerprints were not on South Australian police records, forcing them to look further afield. On 5 December, \"The Advertiser\" reported that police were searching through military records after a man claimed to have had a drink with a man resembling the dead man at a hotel in Glenelg on 13 November. During their drinking session, the mystery man supposedly produced a military pension card bearing the name \"Solomonson\".\n\nIn early January 1949, two people identified the body as that of 63-year-old former wood cutter Robert Walsh. A third person, James Mack, also viewed the body, initially could not identify it, but an hour later he contacted police to claim it was Walsh. Mack stated that the reason he did not confirm this at the viewing was a difference in the colour of the hair. Walsh had left Adelaide several months earlier to buy sheep in Queensland but had failed to return at Christmas as planned. Police were skeptical, believing Walsh to be too old to be the dead man. However, the police did state that the body was consistent with that of a man who had been a wood cutter, although the state of the man's hands indicated he had not cut wood for at least 18 months. Any thoughts that a positive identification had been made were quashed, however, when Elizabeth Thompson, one of the people who had earlier positively identified the body as Walsh, retracted her statement after a second viewing of the body, where the absence of a particular scar on the body, as well as the size of the dead man's legs, led her to realise the body was not Walsh.\n\nBy early February 1949, there had been eight different \"positive\" identifications of the body, including two Darwin men who thought the body was of a friend of theirs, and others who thought it was a missing station worker, a worker on a steamship or a Swedish man. Detectives from the state of Victoria initially believed the man was from there because of the similarity of the laundry marks to those used by several dry-cleaning firms in Melbourne. Following publication of the man's photograph in Victoria, 28 people claimed to know his identity. Victorian detectives disproved all the claims and said that \"other investigations\" indicated it was unlikely that he was a Victorian.\n\nA seaman by the name of Tommy Reade from the , in port at the time, was thought to be the dead man, but after some of his shipmates viewed the body at the morgue, they stated categorically that the corpse was not that of Tommy Reade.\n\nBy November 1953, police announced they had recently received the 251st \"solution\" to the identity of the body from members of the public who claimed to have met or known him. But, they said that the \"only clue of any value\" remained the clothing the man wore.\n\nIn 2011, an Adelaide woman contacted biological anthropologist Maciej Henneberg about an identification card of an H. C. Reynolds that she had found in her father's possessions. The card, a document issued in the United States to foreign seamen during World War I, was given to Henneberg in October 2011 for comparison of the ID photograph to that of the Somerton man. While Henneberg found anatomical similarities in features such as the nose, lips and eyes, he believed they were not as reliable as the close similarity of the ear. The ear shapes shared by both men were a \"very good\" match, although Henneberg also found what he called a \"unique identifier;\" a mole on the cheek that was the same shape and in the same position in both photographs.\"Together with the similarity of the ear characteristics, this mole, in a forensic case, would allow me to make a rare statement positively identifying the Somerton man.\"\n\nThe ID card, numbered 58757, was issued in the United States on 28 February 1918 to H.C. Reynolds, giving his nationality as \"British\" and age as 18. Searches conducted by the US National Archives, the UK National Archives and the Australian War Memorial Research Centre have failed to find any records relating to H.C. Reynolds. The South Australia Police Major Crime Branch, who still have the case listed as open, will investigate the new information. Some independent researchers believe the ID card belonged to one Horace Charles Reynolds, a Tasmanian man who died in 1953 and therefore could not have been the Somerton Man.\n\nIn March 2009 a University of Adelaide team led by Professor Derek Abbott began an attempt to solve the case through cracking the code and proposing to exhume the body to test for DNA. His investigations have led to questions concerning the assumptions police had made on the case. Abbott also tracked down the Barbour waxed cotton of the period and found packaging variations. This may provide clues to the country where it was purchased.\n\nDecryption of the \"code\" was being started from scratch. It had been determined the letter frequency was considerably different from letters written down randomly; the frequency was to be further tested to determine if the alcohol level of the writer could alter random distribution. The format of the code also appeared to follow the quatrain format of the \"Rubaiyat, \"supporting the theory that the code was a one-time pad encryption algorithm. Copies of the \"Rubaiyat, \"as well as the Talmud and Bible, were being compared to the code using computers to get a statistical base for letter frequencies. However, the code's short length meant the investigators would require the exact edition of the book used. With the original copy lost in the 1960s, researchers have been looking for a FitzGerald edition without success.\n\nAn investigation had shown that the Somerton Man's autopsy reports of 1948 and 1949 are now missing and the Barr Smith Library's collection of Cleland's notes do not contain anything on the case. Maciej Henneberg, professor of anatomy at the University of Adelaide, examined images of the Somerton man's ears and found that his cymba (upper ear hollow) is larger than his cavum (lower ear hollow), a feature possessed by only 1–2% of the Caucasian population. In May 2009, Derek Abbott consulted with dental experts who concluded that the Somerton Man had hypodontia (a rare genetic disorder) of both lateral incisors, a feature present in only 2% of the general population. In June 2010, Abbott obtained a photograph of Jessica Thomson's eldest son Robin, which clearly showed that he – like the unknown man – had not only a larger cymba than cavum but also hypodontia. The chance that this was a coincidence has been estimated as between one in 10,000,000 and one in 20,000,000.\n\nThe media have suggested that Robin Thomson, who was 16 months old in 1948 and died in 2009, may have been a child of either Alf Boxall or the Somerton Man and passed off as Prosper Thomson's son. DNA testing would confirm or eliminate this speculation. Abbott believes an exhumation and an autosomal DNA test could link the Somerton man to a shortlist of surnames which, along with existing clues to the man's identity, would be the \"final piece of the puzzle\". However, in October 2011, Attorney General John Rau refused permission to exhume the body, stating: \"There needs to be public interest reasons that go well beyond public curiosity or broad scientific interest.\"\n\nFeltus said he was still contacted by people in Europe who believed the man was a missing relative but did not believe an exhumation and finding the man's family grouping would provide answers to relatives, as \"during that period so many war criminals changed their names and came to different countries\".\n\nIn July 2013 Abbott released an artistic impression he commissioned of the Somerton man, believing this might finally lead to an identification. \"All this time we've been publishing the autopsy photo, and it's hard to tell what something looks like from that\", Prof Abbott said.\n\nAccording to a 2015 feature in \"California Sunday\", Derek Abbott married Rachel, the daughter of Roma Egan and Robin Thomson, in 2010.\n\nIn December 2017, Abbott announced three \"excellent\" hairs \"at the right development stage for extracting DNA\" had been found on the plaster cast of the corpse, and had been submitted for analysis to the Australian Centre for Ancient DNA at the University of Adelaide. Processing the results could reportedly take up to a year.\n\nIn February 2018, the University of Adelaide team obtained a high definition analysis of the mitochondrial DNA from the hair sample from Somerton Man. They found that he and his mother belonged to haplogroup H4a1a1a, which is possessed by only 1% of Europeans.\n\nIn November 2013 relatives of \"Jestyn\" gave interviews to the television current affairs program \"60 Minutes\". Kate Thomson, the daughter of Jessica and Prosper Thomson, said that her mother was the woman interviewed by the police and that her mother had told her she had lied to them – Jessica did know the identity of the \"Somerton Man\" and his identity was also \"known to a level higher than the police force\". Her father had died in 1995 and mother had died in 2007. Kate Thomson suggested that her mother and the \"Somerton Man\" may both have been spies, noting that Jessica Thomson taught English to migrants, was interested in communism, and could speak Russian, although she would not disclose to her daughter where she had learned it, or why.\n\nRobin Thomson's widow, Roma Egan, and their daughter Rachel Egan, also appeared on \"60 Minutes\" suggesting that the \"Somerton Man\" was Robin Thomson's father and, therefore, Rachel's grandfather. The Egans reported lodging a new application with the Attorney-General of South Australia, John Rau, to have the Somerton Man's body exhumed and DNA tested. Derek Abbott also subsequently wrote to Rau in support of the Egans, saying that exhumation for DNA testing would be consistent with federal government policy of identifying soldiers in war graves, to bring closure to their families. Kate Thomson opposed the exhumation as being disrespectful to her brother.\n\n\n\nIn June 1945 – three years before the death of the Somerton Man – a 34-year-old Singaporean named George Marshall (born Joseph Saul Haim Mashal) was found dead in Ashton Park, Mosman, Sydney, with an open copy of the \"Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam\" on his chest. Ashton Park is directly adjacent to Clifton Gardens. His death is believed to be a suicide by poisoning, and occurred two months before Harkness gave Boxall the inscribed copy of the \"Rubaiyat\". Marshall was a brother of David Marshall, who was later to become Singapore's first Chief Minister. An inquest was held on 15 August 1945; Gwenneth Dorothy Graham testified at the inquest and was found dead 13 days later face down, naked, in a bath with her wrists slit.\n\nOn 6 June 1949, the body of two-year-old Clive Mangnoson was found in a sack in the Largs Bay sand hills, about up the coast from Somerton. Lying next to him was his unconscious father, Keith Waldemar Mangnoson. The father was taken to a hospital in a very weak condition, suffering from exposure; following a medical examination, he was transferred to a mental hospital. The Mangnosons had been missing for four days. The police believed that Clive had been dead for twenty-four hours when his body was found. The two were found by Neil McRae of Largs Bay, who claimed he had seen the location of the two in a dream the night before. The coroner could not determine the young Mangnoson's cause of death, although it was not believed to be natural causes. The contents of the boy's stomach were sent to a government analyst for further examination.\n\nFollowing the death, the boy's mother, Roma Mangnoson, reported having been threatened by a masked man, who, while driving a battered cream car, almost ran her down outside her home in Cheapside Street, Largs North. Mrs Mangnoson stated that \"the car stopped and a man with a khaki handkerchief over his face told her to 'keep away from the police or else.'\" Additionally a similar-looking man had been recently seen lurking around the house. Mrs. Mangnoson believed that this situation was related to her husband's attempt to identify the Somerton Man, believing him to be Carl Thompsen, who had worked with him in Renmark in 1939. Soon after being interviewed by police over her harassment, Mrs. Mangnoson collapsed and required medical treatment.\n\nJ. M. Gower, secretary of the Largs North Progress Association received anonymous phone calls threatening that Mrs. Mangnoson would meet with an accident if he interfered while A. H. Curtis, the acting mayor of Port Adelaide received three anonymous phone calls threatening \"an accident\" if he \"stuck his nose into the Mangnoson affair\". Police suspect the calls may be a hoax and the caller may be the same person who also terrorised a woman in a nearby suburb who had recently lost her husband in tragic circumstances.\n\nThe two daily Adelaide newspapers, \"The Advertiser\" and \"The News\", covered the death in separate ways. \"The Advertiser\", then a morning broadsheet, first mentioned the case in a small article on page three of its edition of 2 December 1948. Entitled \"Body found on Beach\", it read:\n\nA body, believed to be of E.C. Johnson, about 45, of Arthur St, Payneham, was found on Somerton Beach, opposite the Crippled Children's Home yesterday morning. The discovery was made by Mr J. Lyons, of Whyte Rd, Somerton. Detective H. Strangway and Constable J. Moss are enquiring.\n\n\"The News\", an afternoon tabloid, featured their story of the man on its first page, giving more details of the dead man.\n\nAs one journalist wrote in June 1949, alluding to the line in the 'Rubaiyat\", \"the Somerton Man seems to have made certain that the glass would be empty, save for speculation.\"\n\nAn editorial called the case \"one of Australia's most profound mysteries\" and noted that if he died by poison so rare and obscure it could not be identified by toxicology experts, then surely the culprit's advanced knowledge of toxic substances pointed to something more serious than a mere domestic poisoning.\n\n\n\nSources\n\nTamam Shud case\n\n\nRoyal North Shore Hospital\n\n\nSouth Australia police articles\n\n\n"}
{"id": "37026607", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37026607", "title": "The Discovery of the Future", "text": "The Discovery of the Future\n\nThe Discovery of the Future is a 1902 philosophical lecture by H. G. Wells that argues for the knowability of the future. It was originally delivered to the Royal Institution on January 24, 1902. Before appearing in book form, it was published by Richard Gregory in \"Nature\" on February 6, 1902, and was also published as part of the \"Annual Report\" of the Smithsonian Institution. Available online.\n\nWells begins by distinguishing between \"two divergent types of mind,\" one that judges and attaches importance principally to what has happened in the past and one that judges and attaches importance principally to what will happen in the future. To the former he attributes the adjectives \"legal or submissive,\" \"passive,\" and \"oriental,\" and to the latter the adjectives \"legislative, creative, organizing, or masterful,\" and \"active,\" calling it \"a more modern and much less abundant type of mind.\"\n\nObserving that these two minds reach \"divergent and incompatible consequences\" in the spheres of morality and public affairs, Wells analyzes the reasons for which the past-oriented mind predominates and asserts that this is principally due to the evidently greater knowability of the personal past as compared to the future. But he argues that the inference from this attitude that the future is essentially unknowable does not square with \"modern science, that is to say the relentless systematic criticism of phenomena.\" Not only has science made us knowledgeable about a distant, impersonal past, it also regards the ability successfully to predict to be a criterion of validity. Though the unpredictability of human behavior complicates the problem, the fact that \"as individuals increase in number they begin to average out\" means that \"an inductive knowledge of a great number of things in the future is becoming a human possibility.\" Confessing himself to be among \"those who believe entirely in the forces behind the individual\" rather than in individuals themselves as determining causes, Wells argues that there is \"no reason why we should not aspire to, and discover and use, safe and servicable, generalizations upon countless issues in the human destiny.\" But personal prophecy and fortune-telling will never be possible; \"the knowledge of the future we may hope to gain will be general and not individual.\"\n\nWells devotes the last part of his text to speculations about \"the question what is to come after man,\" considering it \"the most persistently fascinating and the most insoluble question in the whole world.\" He concludes with a statement of personal faith \"in the coherency and purpose in the world and in the greatness of human destiny.\"\n\nWells's lecture followed on the heels of the great success of his recent book, \"Anticipations\" (1901), based on a series of articles commissioned in 1900 by W.L. Courtney for the \"Fortnightly Review\", but the original invitation to lecture to the Royal Institution had come in 1899.\n\nAccording to Graham Wallas, Wells's delivery of his lecture was too rapid, but it was well received and contributed to the rapid integration of the 35-year-old Wells into the literary and intellectual elite of London in 1902.\n"}
{"id": "949207", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=949207", "title": "The Man with the Flower in His Mouth", "text": "The Man with the Flower in His Mouth\n\nThe Man With the Flower in His Mouth ( ) is a 1922 play by the Italian playwright Luigi Pirandello. It is particularly noteworthy for becoming, in 1930, the first piece of television drama ever to be produced in Britain, when a version was screened by the British Broadcasting Corporation as part of their experimental transmissions.\n\nThe play is a one-act \"dialogue\" derived, with small variations, from the novella \"La Morte Adosso\" (1923). The dialogue takes place in a bar, late at night, between a man who is dying of an epithelioma\n(\"il fiore in bocca\") and a peaceful businessman who has missed his train. In other words, between someone who intensely lives the little time left to him and someone who is rich with time to spend idly and irresponsibly, waiting for the morning train and entirely absorbed by the banal contretemps.\n\nThe exceptional nature of the moment, for the man who feels death upon him—to use Pirandello's phrase—and the normality of it, for the one who is absorbed in the usual affairs of life with its small daily commitments, mark the two ends of the dialectic which is animated in the grand soliloquy of the protagonist.\n\nHe lucidly analyses his last sensations on earth, evoking scenes of common life, particulars of a quotidianity which are receding from him irremediably and which, for this reason, make precious the memories of even the most trivial events. In the solemnity of his solitude, he seems to have gained unexpected awarenesses of the life that is leaving him and of death. With no sense of regret or repentance, he almost seems to bitterly enjoy his unrepeatable experience marked by the echo of the end, which allows him to dedicate himself with interest to observing the anonymous life of others, in order to grasp its sense.\n\nThe BBC had been experimenting with John Logie Baird's primitive 30-line television technology since the previous year, running test transmissions both from Baird's own premises and from their own radio headquarters at Savoy Hill. In the summer of 1930 it was decided that a drama should be produced as a new test for and demonstration of the medium, and \"The Man With the Flower in His Mouth\" was selected for use because of its short length of around half an hour, its limited cast of only three characters and its confined setting.\n\nThe production was broadcast live on the afternoon of 14 July, from a set at the Baird company's headquarters, 133 Long Acre in London. The production starred Earle Grey as 'The Man', Gladys Young as 'The Woman' and Lionel Millard as 'The Customer'. It was directed by the BBC's head of radio drama at the time, Val Gielgud, and produced by Lance Sieveking. The artwork was by C. R. Nevinson.\n\nGenerally regarded as a successful experiment, the production was watched at the time by Ramsay MacDonald, the Prime Minister, with his family from their official residence at 10 Downing Street. Baird had installed one of his prototype 'televisors' here two months previously, so that MacDonald could view the test transmissions he and the BBC were regularly broadcasting.\n\nAs the 1930 production was transmitted live, no record survives of it in the archives. However, in 1967, Bill Elliott, a technician working at Granada Television in Manchester, decided to attempt a re-creation of an extract of the play, using a replica of one of the 30-line Baird Televisiors he had constructed himself, which acted as both camera and monitor.\n\nThe 30-line signal was sufficiently low-band for Elliott to be able to record the production onto a stereo audio tape recorder, thus preserving it for posterity. Although Elliott did not re-create the entire play and used amateur student actors in the roles, he did secure the services of the original production's producer, Lance Sieveking. Sieveking not only returned to produce the production in an attempt to assure as much authenticity as possible, but he was also able to provide the original artwork used in the play which was used again, and the very same 78-rpm gramophone record which had provided the music in 1930, which was also re-used.\n\nThe 1967 production survives in Elliott's hands, and a small segment was seen in the 1985 Granada documentary series \"Television\", a history of the medium.\n\nIn February 2007 an opera based on the play was premiered in De Munt in Brussels. The composer was Luc Brewaeys.\n\n\n\n \n"}

{"id": "32591", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=32591", "title": "Vegetarianism", "text": "Vegetarianism\n\nVegetarianism is the practice of abstaining from the consumption of meat (red meat, poultry, seafood, and the flesh of any other animal), and may also include abstention from by-products of animal slaughter.\n\nVegetarianism may be adopted for various reasons. Many people object to eating meat out of respect for sentient life. Such ethical motivations have been codified under various religious beliefs, as well as animal rights advocacy. Other motivations for vegetarianism are health-related, political, environmental, cultural, aesthetic, economic, or personal preference. There are variations of the diet as well: an ovo-lacto vegetarian diet includes both eggs and dairy products, an ovo-vegetarian diet includes eggs but not dairy products, and a lacto-vegetarian diet includes dairy products but not eggs. A vegan diet excludes all animal products, including eggs and dairy. Some vegans also avoid other animal products such as beeswax, leather or silk clothing, and goose-fat shoe polish.\n\nPackaged and processed foods, such as cakes, cookies, candies, chocolate, yogurt, and marshmallows, often contain unfamiliar animal ingredients, so may be a special concern for vegetarians due to the likelihood of such additions. Often, prior to purchase or consumption, vegetarians will scrutinize products for animal-derived ingredients. Vegetarians' feelings vary with regard to these ingredients. For example, while some vegetarians may be unaware of animal-derived rennet's role in the production of cheese, and may therefore unknowingly consume the product, other vegetarians may not take issue with its consumption.\n\nSemi-vegetarian diets consist largely of vegetarian foods but may include fish or poultry, or sometimes other meats, on an infrequent basis. Those with diets containing fish or poultry may define \"meat\" only as mammalian flesh and may identify with vegetarianism. A pescetarian diet has been described as \"fish but no other meat\". The common-use association between such diets and vegetarianism has led vegetarian groups such as the Vegetarian Society to state that diets containing these ingredients are not vegetarian, because fish and birds are also animals.\nThe first discovered written use of the term \"vegetarian\" dates to 1839 and refers to what was previously described as a vegetable regimen or diet, for example in print in 1811. Modern dictionaries based on scientific linguistic principles have always explained its origin as an irregular compound of \"vegetable\" (in the adjectival sense of any plant still common today) and the suffix \"-arian\" (in the sense of \"supporter, believer\" as in \"humanitarian\"), but there were amateur attempts, even by a Latin scholar not trained in linguistics, to find other origins of the word.\nThe term was popularized with the foundation of the Vegetarian Society in Manchester in 1847, although it may have appeared in print before 1847. The earliest occurrences of the term seem to be related to Alcott House—a school on the north side of Ham Common, London—which was opened in July 1838 by James Pierrepont Greaves. From 1841, it was known as \"A Concordium, or Industry Harmony College\", from which time the institution began to publish its own pamphlet entitled \"The Healthian\", which provides some of the earliest appearances of the term \"vegetarian\".\n\nThe earliest record of vegetarianism comes from the Indus Valley Civilization as early as the 7th century BCE, inculcating tolerance towards all living beings. Parshwanatha and Mahavira, the 23rd & 24th \"tirthankaras\" in Jainism respectively revived and advocated ahimsa and Jain vegetarianism in 8th to 6th century BC; the most comprehensive and strictest form of vegetarianism. Vegetarianism was also practiced in ancient Greece and the earliest reliable evidence for vegetarian theory and practice in Greece dates from the 6th century BC. The Orphics, a religious movement spreading in Greece at that time, also practiced and promoted vegetarianism. Greek teacher Pythagoras, who promoted the altruistic doctrine of metempsychosis, may have practiced vegetarianism, but is also recorded as eating meat. A fictionalized portrayal of Pythagoras appears in Ovid's \"Metamorphoses\", in which he advocates a form of strict vegetarianism. It was through this portrayal that Pythagoras was best known to English-speakers throughout the early modern period and, prior to the coinage of the word \"vegetarianism\", vegetarians were referred to in English as \"Pythagoreans\".\n\nVegetarianism was also practiced about six centuries later in another instance (30 BCE–50 CE) in the northern Thracian region by the Moesi tribe (who inhabited present-day Serbia and Bulgaria), feeding themselves on honey, milk, and cheese.\n\nIn Indian culture, vegetarianism has been closely connected with the attitude of nonviolence towards animals (called \"ahimsa\" in India) for millennia and was promoted by religious groups and philosophers. The ancient Indian work of Tirukkural explicitly and unambiguously emphasizes shunning meat and non-killing. Chapter 26 of the Tirukkural, particularly couplets 251–260, deals exclusively on vegetarianism or veganism. Among the Hellenes, Egyptians, and others, vegetarianism had medical or ritual purification purposes.\nFollowing the Christianization of the Roman Empire in late antiquity, vegetarianism practically disappeared from Europe, as it did elsewhere, except in India. Several orders of monks in medieval Europe restricted or banned the consumption of meat for ascetic reasons, but none of them eschewed fish. Moreover, the medieval definition of \"fish\" included such animals as seals, porpoises, dolphins, barnacle geese, puffins, and beavers. Vegetarianism re-emerged during the Renaissance, becoming more widespread in the 19th and 20th centuries. In 1847, the first Vegetarian Society was founded in the United Kingdom; Germany, the Netherlands, and other countries followed. In 1886, the vegetarian colony Nueva Germania was founded in Paraguay, though its vegetarian aspect would prove short-lived. The International Vegetarian Union, an association of the national societies, was founded in 1908. In the Western world, the popularity of vegetarianism grew during the 20th century as a result of nutritional, ethical, and—more recently—environmental and economic concerns.\n\n \nThere are a number of vegetarian diets that exclude or include various foods:\n\nWithin the \"ovo-\" groups, there are many who refuse to consume fertilized eggs (with balut being an extreme example); however, such distinction is typically not specifically addressed.\n\nSome vegetarians also avoid products that may use animal ingredients not included in their labels or which use animal products in their manufacturing. For example, sugars that are whitened with bone char, cheeses that use animal rennet (enzymes from animal stomach lining), gelatin (derived from the collagen inside animals' skin, bones, and connective tissue), some cane sugar (but not beet sugar) and beverages (such as apple juice and alcohol) clarified with gelatin or crushed shellfish and sturgeon, while other vegetarians are unaware of, or do not mind, such ingredients.\n\nIndividuals sometimes label themselves \"vegetarian\" while practicing a semi-vegetarian diet, as some dictionary definitions describe vegetarianism as sometimes including the consumption of fish, or only include mammalian flesh as part of their definition of meat, while other definitions exclude fish and all animal flesh. In other cases, individuals may describe themselves as \"flexitarian\".\nThese diets may be followed by those who reduce animal flesh consumed as a way of transitioning to a complete vegetarian diet or for health, ethical, environmental, or other reasons. Semi-vegetarian diets include:\n\nSemi-vegetarianism is contested by vegetarian groups, such as the Vegetarian Society, which states that vegetarianism excludes all animal flesh.\n\n \n\nStudies on the health effects of vegetarian diets observe heterogeneous effects on mortality. One review found a decreased overall risk of all cause mortality, cancer (except breast) and cardiovascular disease; however, a meta-analysis found lower risk for ischemic heart disease and cancer but no effect on overall mortality or cerebrovascular disease. Possible limitations include varying definitions used of vegetarianism, and the observation of increased risk of lung cancer mortality in those on a vegetarian diet for less than five years. An analysis pooling two large studies found vegetarians in the UK have similar all cause mortality as meat eaters. An older meta analysis found similar results, only finding decreased mortality in vegetarians, pescatarians, and irregular meat eaters in ischemic heart disease, but not from any other cause.\n\nVegetarian diets have been shown to prevent and treat gallstones, cardiovascular disease, rheumatoid arthritis, dementia, diverticular disease, renal disease, hypertension, osteoporosis, cancer, and diabetes.\n\nA vegetarian diet which is poorly planned can lead to hyperhomocysteinemia and platelet disorders; this risk may be offset by ensuring sufficient consumption of vitamin B 12 and polyunsaturated fatty acids.\n\nThe Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics and Dietitians of Canada have stated that at all stages of life, a properly planned vegetarian diet is \"healthful, nutritionally adequate, and provides health benefits in the prevention and treatment of certain diseases\". Large-scale studies have shown that mortality from ischemic heart disease was 30% lower among vegetarian men and 20% lower among vegetarian women than in non-vegetarians. Vegetarian diets offer lower levels of saturated fat, cholesterol and animal protein, and higher levels of carbohydrates, fibre, magnesium, potassium, folate, and antioxidants such as vitamins C and E and phytochemicals.\n\n\"Vegetarian diets can meet guidelines for the treatment of diabetes and some research suggests that diets that are more plant-based reduce risk of type-2 diabetes. Rates of self-reported Seventh-day Adventists (SDA) were less than half of those of the general population, and, among SDA, vegetarians had lower rates of diabetes than non-vegetarians. Among possible explanations for a protective effect of vegetarian diet are the Lower BMI of vegetarians and higher fiber intake, both of which improve insulin sensitivity.\"\n\nThe relationship between vegetarian diet and bone health remains unclear. According to some studies, a vegetarian lifestyle can be associated with vitamin B 12 deficiency and low bone mineral density. However, a study of vegetarian and non-vegetarian adults in Taiwan found no significant difference in bone mineral density between the two groups. Other studies, exploring animal protein's negative effects on bone health, suggest that vegetarians may be less prone to osteoporosis than omnivores, as vegetarian subjects had greater bone mineral density and more bone formation.\n\nThe China-Cornell-Oxford Project, a 20-year study conducted by Cornell University, the University of Oxford, and the government of China has established a correlation between the consumption of animal products and a variety of chronic illnesses, such as coronary heart disease, diabetes, and cancers of the breast, prostate and bowel (see \"The China Study\").\n\nA British study of almost 10,000 men found that those who gave up meat were almost twice as likely to suffer from depression as people on a conventional balanced diet. The study found that the 350 committed vegetarians studied had a higher average depression score compared to others.\n\nA vegetarian diet may help reduce the risk of Alzheimer's disease, as the most important dietary link to Alzheimer's disease appears to be meat consumption, with eggs and high-fat dairy also contributing.\n\nWestern vegetarian diets are typically high in carotenoids, but relatively low in omega-3 fatty acids and vitamin B. Vegans can have particularly low intake of vitamin B and calcium if they do not eat enough items such as collard greens, leafy greens, tempeh and tofu (soy). High levels of dietary fiber, folic acid, vitamins C and E, and magnesium, and low consumption of saturated fat are all considered to be beneficial aspects of a vegetarian diet. A well planned vegetarian diet will provide all nutrients in a meat-eater's diet to the same level for all stages of life.\n\nProtein intake in vegetarian diets is lower than in meat diets but can meet the daily requirements for most people. Studies at Harvard University as well as other studies conducted in the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and various European countries,\nconfirmed vegetarian diets provide sufficient protein intake as long as a variety of plant sources are available and consumed. Pumpkin seeds, peanut butter, hemp seed, almonds, pistachio nuts, flaxseed, tofu, oats, soybeans, walnuts, are great sources of protein for vegetarians. Proteins are composed of amino acids, and a common concern with protein acquired from vegetable sources is an adequate intake of the essential amino acids, which cannot be synthesised by the human body. While dairy and egg products provide complete sources for ovo-lacto vegetarian, several vegetable sources have significant amounts of all eight types of essential amino acids, including lupin beans, soy, hempseed, chia seed, amaranth, buckwheat, pumpkin seeds spirulina, pistachios, and quinoa. However, the essential amino acids can also be obtained by eating a variety of complementary plant sources that, in combination, provide all eight essential amino acids (e.g. brown rice and beans, or hummus and pita, though protein combining in the same meal is not necessary). A 1994 study found a varied intake of such sources can be adequate.\n\nVegetarian diets typically contain similar levels of iron to non-vegetarian diets, but this has lower bioavailability than iron from meat sources, and its absorption can sometimes be inhibited by other dietary constituents. According to the Vegetarian Resource Group, consuming food that contains vitamin C, such as citrus fruit or juices, tomatoes, or broccoli, is a good way to increase the amount of iron absorbed at a meal. Vegetarian foods rich in iron include black beans, cashews, hempseed, kidney beans, broccoli, lentils, oatmeal, raisins, spinach, cabbage, lettuce, black-eyed peas, soybeans, many breakfast cereals, sunflower seeds, chickpeas, tomato juice, tempeh, molasses, thyme, and whole-wheat bread. The related vegan diets can often be higher in iron than vegetarian diets, because dairy products are low in iron. Iron stores often tend to be lower in vegetarians than non-vegetarians, and a few small studies report very high rates of iron deficiency (up to 40%, and 58% of the respective vegetarian or vegan groups). However, the American Dietetic Association states that iron deficiency is no more common in vegetarians than non-vegetarians (adult males are rarely iron deficient); iron deficiency anaemia is rare no matter the diet.\n\nAccording to the United States National Institutes of Health, vitamin B is not generally present in plants and is naturally found in foods of animal origin. Lacto-ovo vegetarians can obtain B from dairy products and eggs, and vegans can obtain it from fortified foods (including some soy products and some breakfast cereals) and dietary supplements. Vitamin B can also be obtained from fortified yeast extract products.\n\nThe recommended dietary allowance of B in the United States is, per day, 0.4 mcg (0–6 months), rising to 1.8 mcg (9–13 years), 2.4 mcg (14+ years), and 2.8 mcg (lactating female). While the body's daily requirement for vitamin B is very small, deficiency of the vitamin is very serious leading to anemia and irreversible nerve damage.\n\nPlant-based, or vegetarian, sources of Omega 3 fatty acids include soy, walnuts, pumpkin seeds, canola oil, kiwifruit, hempseed, algae, chia seed, flaxseed, echium seed and leafy vegetables such as lettuce, spinach, cabbage and purslane. Purslane contains more Omega 3 than any other known leafy green. Olives (and olive oil) are another important plant source of unsaturated fatty acids. Plant foods can provide alpha-linolenic acid which the human body uses to synthesize the long-chain n-3 fatty acids EPA and DHA. EPA and DHA can be obtained directly in high amounts from oily fish or fish oils. Vegetarians, and particularly vegans, have lower levels of EPA and DHA than meat-eaters. While the health effects of low levels of EPA and DHA are unknown, it is unlikely that supplementation with alpha-linolenic acid will significantly increase levels. Recently, some companies have begun to market vegetarian DHA supplements containing seaweed extracts. Whole seaweeds are not suitable for supplementation because their high iodine content limits the amount that may be safely consumed. However, certain algae such as spirulina are good sources of gamma-linolenic acid (GLA), alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), linoleic acid (LA), stearidonic acid (SDA), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), and arachidonic acid (AA).\n\nCalcium intake in vegetarians and vegans can be similar to non-vegetarians, as long as the diet is properly planned. Lacto-ovo vegetarians that include dairy products can still obtain calcium from dairy sources like milk, yogurt, and cheese.\n\nNon-dairy milks that are fortified with calcium, such as soymilk and almond milk can also contribute a significant amount of calcium in the diet. The calcium found in broccoli, bok choy, and kale have also been found to have calcium that is well absorbed in the body. Though the calcium content per serving is lower in these vegetables than a glass of milk, the absorption of the calcium into the body is higher. Other foods that contain calcium include calcium-set tofu, blackstrap molasses, turnip greens, mustard greens, soybeans, tempeh, almonds, okra, dried figs, and tahini. Though calcium can be found in Spinach, swiss chard, beans and beet greens, they are generally not considered to be a good source since the calcium binds to oxalic acid and is poorly absorbed into the body. Phytic acid found in nuts, seeds, and beans may also impact calcium absorption rates. See the National Institutes of Health Office of Dietary Supplements for calcium needs for various ages, the Vegetarian Resource Group and the Vegetarian Nutrition Calcium Fact Sheet from the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics for more specifics on how to obtain adequate calcium intake on a vegetarian or vegan diet.\n\nVitamin D needs can be met via the human body's own generation upon sufficient and sensible exposure to ultraviolet (UV) light in sunlight. Products including milk, soy milk and cereal grains may be fortified to provide a source of Vitamin D. For those who do not get adequate sun exposure or food sources, Vitamin D supplementation may be necessary.\n\n\nVitamin D, or ergocalciferol is found in fungus (except alfalfa which is a plantae) and created from viosterol, which in turn is created when ultraviolet light activates ergosterol (which is found in fungi and named as a sterol from ergot). Any UV-irradiated fungus including yeast form vitamin D. Human bioavailability of vitamin D from vitamin D-enhanced button mushrooms via UV-B irradiation is effective in improving vitamin D status and not different from a vitamin D supplement according to study. For example, Vitamin D from UV-irradiated yeast baked into bread is bioavailable.\nBy visual assessment or using a chromometer, no significant discoloration of irradiated mushrooms, as measured by the degree of \"whiteness\", was observed making it hard to discover if they have been treated without labeling. Claims have been made that a normal serving (approx. 3 oz or 1/2 cup, or 60 grams) of mushrooms treated with ultraviolet light increase their vitamin D content to levels up to 80 micrograms, or 2700 IU if exposed to just 5 minutes of UV light after being harvested.\n\nThere have been many comparative and statistical studies of the relationship between diet and longevity, including vegetarianism and longevity.\n\nA 1999 metastudy combined data from five studies from western countries. The metastudy reported mortality ratios, where lower numbers indicated fewer deaths, for fish eaters to be 0.82, vegetarians to be 0.84, occasional meat eaters (eat meat less than once per week) to be 0.84. Regular meat eaters had the base mortality rate of 1.0, while the number for vegans was very uncertain (anywhere between 0.7 and 1.44) due to too few data points. The study reported the numbers of deaths in each category, and expected error ranges for each ratio, and adjustments made to the data. However, the \"lower mortality was due largely to the relatively low prevalence of smoking in these [vegetarian] cohorts\". Out of the major causes of death studied, only one difference in mortality rate was attributed to the difference in diet, as the conclusion states: \"...vegetarians had a 24% lower mortality from ischaemic heart disease than non-vegetarians, but no associations of a vegetarian diet with other major causes of death were established\".\n\nIn \"Mortality in British vegetarians\", a similar conclusion is drawn:\n\nBritish vegetarians have low mortality compared with the general population. Their death rates are similar to those of comparable non-vegetarians, suggesting that much of this benefit may be attributed to non-dietary lifestyle factors such as a low prevalence of smoking and a generally high socio-economic status, or to aspects of the diet other than the avoidance of meat and fish.\"\n\nThe Adventist Health Studies is ongoing research that documents the life expectancy in Seventh-day Adventists. This is the only study among others with similar methodology which had favourable indication for vegetarianism. The researchers found that a combination of different lifestyle choices could influence life expectancy by as much as 10 years. Among the lifestyle choices investigated, a vegetarian diet was estimated to confer an extra 1–1/2 to 2 years of life. The researchers concluded that \"the life expectancies of California Adventist men and women are higher than those of any other well-described natural population\" at 78.5 years for men and 82.3 years for women. The life expectancy of California Adventists surviving to age 30 was 83.3 years for men and 85.7 years for women.\n\nThe Adventist health study is again incorporated into a metastudy titled \"Does low meat consumption increase life expectancy in humans?\" published in \"American Journal of Clinical Nutrition\", which concluded that low meat eating (less than once per week) and other lifestyle choices significantly increase life expectancy, relative to a group with high meat intake. The study concluded that \"The findings from one cohort of healthy adults raises the possibility that long-term (≥ 2 decades) adherence to a vegetarian diet can further produce a significant 3.6-y increase in life expectancy.\" However, the study also concluded that \"Some of the variation in the survival advantage in vegetarians may have been due to marked differences between studies in adjustment for confounders, the definition of vegetarian, measurement error, age distribution, the healthy volunteer effect, and intake of specific plant foods by the vegetarians.\" It further states that \"This raises the possibility that a low-meat, high plant-food dietary pattern may be the true causal protective factor rather than simply elimination of meat from the diet.\" In a recent review of studies relating low-meat diet patterns to all-cause mortality, Singh noted that \"5 out of 5 studies indicated that adults who followed a low meat, high plant-food diet pattern experienced significant or marginally significant decreases in mortality risk relative to other patterns of intake.\"\n\nStatistical studies, such as comparing life expectancy with regional areas and local diets in Europe also have found life expectancy considerably greater in southern France, where a low meat, high plant Mediterranean diet is common, than northern France, where a diet with high meat content is more common.\n\nA study by the Institute of Preventive and Clinical Medicine, and Institute of Physiological Chemistry looked at a group of 19 vegetarians (lacto-ovo) and used as a comparison a group of 19 omnivorous subjects recruited from the same region. The study found that this group of vegetarians (lacto-ovo) have a significantly higher amount of plasma carboxymethyllysine and advanced glycation endproducts (AGEs) compared to this group of non-vegetarians. Carboxymethyllysine is a glycation product which represents \"a general marker of oxidative stress and long-term damage of proteins in aging, atherosclerosis and diabetes\" and \"[a]dvanced glycation end products (AGEs) may play an important adverse role in process of atherosclerosis, diabetes, aging and chronic renal failure\".\n\nVegetarian diets may lower the risk of heart disease, as well as reduce the need for medications prescribed for chronic illnesses.\n\nVegetarian diets have been studied to see whether they are of benefit in treating arthritis, but no good supporting evidence has been found.\n\nThe American Dietetic Association discussed that vegetarian diets may be more common among adolescents with eating disorders, indicating that vegetarian diets do not cause eating disorders, but rather \"vegetarian diets may be selected to camouflage an existing eating disorder\".\n\nVarious ethical reasons have been suggested for choosing vegetarianism, usually predicated on the interests of non-human animals. In many societies, controversy and debate have arisen over the ethics of eating animals. Some people, while not vegetarians, refuse to eat the flesh of certain animals due to cultural taboo, such as cats, dogs, horses or rabbits. Others support meat eating for scientific, nutritional and cultural reasons, including religious ones. Some meat eaters abstain from the meat of animals reared in particular ways, such as factory farms, or avoid certain meats, such as veal or foie gras. Some people follow vegetarian or vegan diets not because of moral concerns involving the raising or consumption of animals in general, but because of concerns about the specific treatment and practises involved in the raising and slaughter of animals, i.e. factory farming and the industrialisation of animal slaughter. Others still avoid meat because meat production is claimed to place a greater burden on the environment than production of an equivalent amount of plant protein.\n\nEthical objections based on consideration for animals are generally divided into opposition to the act of killing in general, and opposition to certain agricultural practices surrounding the production of meat.\n\nPrinceton University professor and animal rights activist Peter Singer believes that if alternative means of survival exist, one ought to choose the option that does not cause unnecessary harm to animals. Most ethical vegetarians argue that the same reasons exist against killing animals in the flesh to eat as against killing humans to eat, especially humans with cognitive abilities equal or lesser than the animals in question. Singer, in his book \"Animal Liberation,\" listed possible qualities of sentience in non-human creatures that gave such creatures the scope to be considered under utilitarian ethics, and this has been widely referenced by animal rights campaigners and vegetarians. Ethical vegetarians also believe that killing an animal, like killing a human, especially one who has equal or lesser cognitive abilities than the animals in question, can only be justified in extreme circumstances and that consuming a living creature for its enjoyable taste, convenience, or nutrition value is not a sufficient cause. Another common view is that humans are morally conscious of their behavior in a way other animals are not, and therefore subject to higher standards. One author proposes that denying the right to life and humane treatment to animals with equal or greater cognitive abilities than mentally disabled humans is an arbitrary and discriminatory practice based on habit instead of logic. Opponents of ethical vegetarianism argue that animals are not moral equals to humans and so consider the comparison of eating livestock with killing people to be fallacious. This view does not excuse cruelty, but maintains that animals do not possess the rights a human has.\n\nOne of the main differences between a vegan and a typical vegetarian diet is the avoidance of both eggs and dairy products such as milk, cheese, butter and yogurt. Ethical vegans do not consume dairy or eggs because they state that their production causes the animal suffering or a premature death.\n\nTo produce milk from dairy cattle, calves are separated from their mothers soon after birth and slaughtered or fed milk replacer in order to retain the cows milk for human consumption. Many vegans state that this breaks the natural mother and calf bond. Unwanted male calves are either slaughtered at birth or sent for veal production. To prolong lactation, dairy cows are almost permanently kept pregnant through artificial insemination. After about five years, once the cow's milk production has dropped, she is considered \"spent\" and sent to slaughter for beef and her hide. A dairy cow's natural life expectancy is about twenty years.\n\nIn battery cage and free-range egg production, unwanted male chicks are culled or discarded at birth during the process of securing a further generation of egg-laying hens.\n\nEthical vegetarianism has become popular in developed countries particularly because of the spread of factory farming, faster communications, and environmental consciousness. Some believe that the current mass demand for meat cannot be satisfied without a mass-production system that disregards the welfare of animals, while others believe that practices like well-managed free-ranging and consumption of game, particularly from species whose natural predators have been significantly eliminated, could substantially alleviate the demand for mass-produced meat.\n\nAncient Greek philosophy has a long tradition of vegetarianism. Pythagoras was reportedly vegetarian (and studied at Mt. Carmel, where some historians say there was a vegetarian community), as his followers were expected to be.\n\nRoman writer Ovid concluded his magnum opus Metamorphoses, in part, with the impassioned argument (uttered by the character of Pythagoras) that in order for humanity to change, or metamorphose, into a better, more harmonious species, it must strive towards more humane tendencies. He cited vegetarianism as the crucial decision in this metamorphosis, explaining his belief that human life and animal life are so entwined that to kill an animal is virtually the same as killing a fellow human.\n\nJainism teaches vegetarianism as moral conduct as do some major sects of Hinduism. Buddhism in general does not prohibit meat eating, while Mahayana Buddhism encourages vegetarianism as beneficial for developing compassion. Other denominations that advocate a vegetarian diet include the Seventh-day Adventists, the Rastafari movement, the Ananda Marga movement and the Hare Krishnas. Sikhism does not equate spirituality with diet and does not specify a vegetarian or meat diet.\n\nWhile there are no dietary restrictions in the Bahá'í Faith, `Abdu'l-Bahá, the son of the religion's founder, noted that a vegetarian diet consisting of fruits and grains was desirable, except for people with a weak constitution or those that are sick. He stated that there are no requirements that Bahá'ís become vegetarian, but that a future society should gradually become vegetarian. `Abdu'l-Bahá also stated that killing animals was contrary to compassion. While Shoghi Effendi, the head of the Bahá'í Faith in the first half of the 20th century, stated that a purely vegetarian diet would be preferable since it avoided killing animals, both he and the Universal House of Justice, the governing body of the Bahá'ís have stated that these teachings do not constitute a Bahá'í practice and that Bahá'ís can choose to eat whatever they wish but should be respectful of others' beliefs.\n\nTheravadins in general eat meat. If Buddhist monks \"see, hear or know\" a living animal was killed specifically for them to eat, they must refuse it or else incur an offense. However, this does not include eating meat which was given as alms or commercially purchased. In the Theravada canon, Buddha did not make any comment discouraging them from eating meat (except specific types, such as human, elephant meat, horse, dog, snake, lion, tiger, leopard, bear, and hyena flesh) but he specifically refused to institute vegetarianism in his monastic code when a suggestion had been made.\n\nIn several Sanskrit texts of Mahayana Buddhism, Buddha instructs his followers to avoid meat. However, each branch of Mahayana Buddhism selects which sutra to follow, and some branches, including the majority of Tibetan and Japanese Buddhists, do eat meat, while many Chinese Buddhist branches do not.\n\nChristians have always been free to make their own decisions about what to eat; however, there are groups within Christianity that practice specific dietary restrictions for various reasons. The early sect known as the Ebionites are considered to have practiced vegetarianism. Surviving fragments from their Gospel indicate their belief that – as Christ is the Passover sacrifice and eating the Passover lamb is no longer required – a vegetarian diet may (or should) be observed. However, orthodox Christianity does not accept their teaching as authentic. Indeed, their specific injunction to strict vegetarianism was cited as one of the Ebionites' \"errors\".\n\nAt a much later time, the Bible Christian Church founded by Reverend William Cowherd in 1809 followed a vegetarian diet. Cowherd was one of the philosophical forerunners of the Vegetarian Society. Cowherd encouraged members to abstain from eating of meat as a form of temperance.\n\nSeventh-day Adventists are encouraged to engage in healthy eating practices, and ova-lacto-vegetarian diets are recommended by the General Conference of Seventh-day Adventists Nutrition Council (GCNC). They have also sponsored and participated in many scientific studies exploring the impact of dietary decisions upon health outcomes. The GCNC has in addition adapted the USDA's food pyramid for a vegetarian dietary approach. However, the only kinds of meat specifically frowned upon by the SDA health message are unclean meats, or those forbidden in scripture.\n\nAdditionally, some monastic orders follow a vegetarian diet, and members of the Orthodox Church follow a vegan diet during fasts. There is also a strong association between the Quakers and vegetarianism dating back at least to the 18th century. The association grew in prominence during the 19th century, coupled with growing Quaker concerns in connection with alcohol consumption, anti-vivisection and social purity. The association between the Quaker tradition and vegetarianism, however, becomes most significant with the founding of the Friends' Vegetarian Society in 1902 \"to spread a kindlier way of living amongst the Society of Friends.\"\n\nAccording to Canon Law, Roman Catholics are required to abstain from meat (defined as all animal flesh excluding water animals) on Ash Wednesday and all Fridays of Lent including Good Friday. Canon Law also obliges Catholics to abstain from meat on the Fridays of the year outside of Lent (excluding certain holy days) unless, with the permission of the local conference of bishops, another penitential act is substituted. The restrictions on eating meat on these days is solely as an act of penance and not because of a religious objection to eating meat.\n\nSince the formation of the Seventh-day Adventist Church in the 1860s when the church began, wholeness and health have been an emphasis of the Adventist church, and has been known as the \"health message\" belief of the church. Adventists are well known for presenting a health message that recommends vegetarianism and expects adherence to the kosher laws in Leviticus 11. Obedience to these laws means abstinence from pork, shellfish, and other animals proscribed as \"unclean\". The church discourages its members from consuming alcoholic beverages, tobacco or illegal drugs (compare Christianity and alcohol). In addition, some Adventists avoid coffee, tea, cola, and other beverages containing caffeine.\n\nThe pioneers of the Adventist Church had much to do with the common acceptance of breakfast cereals into the Western diet, and the \"modern commercial concept of cereal food\" originated among Adventists. John Harvey Kellogg was one of the early founders of Adventist health work. His development of breakfast cereals as a health food led to the founding of Kellogg's by his brother William. In both Australia and New Zealand, the church-owned Sanitarium Health and Wellbeing Company is a leading manufacturer of health and vegetarian-related products, most prominently Weet-Bix.\n\nResearch funded by the U.S. National Institutes of Health has shown that the average Adventist in California lives 4 to 10 years longer than the average Californian. The research, as cited by the cover story of the November 2005 issue of \"National Geographic\", asserts that Adventists live longer because they do not smoke or drink alcohol, have a day of rest every week, and maintain a healthy, low-fat vegetarian diet that is rich in nuts and beans. The cohesiveness of Adventists' social networks has also been put forward as an explanation for their extended lifespan.\nSince Dan Buettner's 2005 \"National Geographic\" story about Adventist longevity, his book, \"The Blue Zones: Lessons for Living Longer From the People Who've Lived the Longest\", named Loma Linda, California a \"blue zone\" because of the large concentration of Seventh-day Adventists. He cites the Adventist emphasis on health, diet, and Sabbath-keeping as primary factors for Adventist longevity.\n\nAn estimated 35% of Adventists practice vegetarianism or veganism, according to a 2002 worldwide survey of local church leaders.\n\nThough there is no strict rule on what to consume and what not to, paths of Hinduism hold vegetarianism as an ideal. Some reasons are: the principle of nonviolence (ahimsa) applied to animals; the intention to offer only \"pure\" (vegetarian) food to a deity and then to receive it back as prasad; and the conviction that a sattvic diet is beneficial for a healthy body and mind and that non-vegetarian food is not recommended for a better mind and for spiritual development.\n\nHowever, the food habits of Hindus vary according to their community, location, custom and varying traditions. Historically and currently, those Hindus who eat meat prescribe Jhatka meat, while some Hindus believe that the cow is a holy animal whose slaughter for meat is forbidden.\n\nSome followers of Islam, or Muslims, chose to be vegetarian for health, ethical, or personal reasons. However, the choice to become vegetarian for non-medical reasons can sometimes be controversial due to conflicting fatwas and differing interpretations of the Quran. Though some more traditional Muslims may keep quiet about their vegetarian diet, the number of vegetarian Muslims is increasing.\n\nVegetarianism has been practiced by some influential Muslims including the Iraqi theologian, female mystic and poet Rabia of Basra, who died in the year 801, and the Sri Lankan Sufi master Bawa Muhaiyaddeen, who established The Bawa Muhaiyaddeen Fellowship of North America in Philadelphia. The former Indian president Dr. A. P. J. Abdul Kalam was also famously a vegetarian.\n\nIn January 1996, The International Vegetarian Union announced the formation of the Muslim Vegetarian/Vegan Society.\n\nMany non-vegetarian Muslims will select vegetarian (or seafood) options when dining in non-halal restaurants. However, this is a matter of not having the right kind of meat rather than preferring not to eat meat on the whole.\n\nFollowers of Jainism believe that all living organisms whether they are micro-organism are living and have a soul, and have one or more senses out of five senses and they go to great lengths to minimise any harm to any living organism. Most Jains are lacto-vegetarians but more devout Jains do not eat root vegetables because they believe that root vegetables contain a lot more micro-organisms as compared to other vegetables, and that, by eating them, violence of these micro-organisms is inevitable. So they focus on eating beans and fruits, whose cultivation do not involve killing of a lot of micro-organisms. No products obtained from dead animals are allowed, because when a living beings dies, a lot of micro-organisms (called as decomposers) will reproduce in the body which decomposes the body, and in eating the dead bodies, violence of decomposers is inevitable. Jain monks usually do a lot of fasting, and when they knew through spiritual powers that their life is very little, they start fasting until death. Some particularly dedicated individuals are fruitarians. Honey is forbidden, because honey is the regurgitation of nectar by bees and may also contain eggs, excreta and dead bees. Some Jains do not consume plant parts that grow underground such as roots and bulbs, because the plants themselves and tiny animals may be killed when the plants are pulled up.\n\nWhile classical Jewish law neither requires nor prohibits the consumption of meat, Jewish vegetarians often cite Jewish principles regarding animal welfare, environmental ethics, moral character, and health as reasons for adopting a vegetarian or vegan diet.\n\nA number of medieval rabbis (e.g., Joseph Albo and Isaac Arama) regard vegetarianism as a moral ideal because the slaughter of animals might cause the individual who performs such acts to develop negative character traits. Many modern rabbis, by contrast, advocate vegetarianism or veganism primarily because of concerns about animal welfare, especially in light of the traditional prohibition on causing unnecessary \"pain to living creatures\" (tza'ar ba'alei hayyim).\n\nAccording to Genesis, consumption of meat was prohibited to human beings (1:29-30) though Noah was given permission to consume meat after the Great Flood. Some advocates of Jewish vegetarianism, such as Rabbi Abraham Isaac Kook, describe vegetarianism as an eschatological ideal to which all human beings must eventually return. A number of Jewish vegetarian groups and activists promote such ideas and believe that the halakhic permission to eat meat is a temporary leniency for those who are not ready yet to accept the vegetarian diet. For some commentators, such as Rabbi Shlomo Ephraim Luntschitz, the complexity of the laws of sacrifice and slaughter (shechita) was intended to discourage the consumption of meat and make it less painful for the animals.\n\nJewish vegetarianism and veganism have become especially popular among Israeli Jews. In 2016, Israel was described as \"the most vegan country on Earth\", as five percent of its population eschewed all animal products. Interest in veganism has grown among both non-Orthodox and Orthodox Jews in Israel.\n\nWithin the Afro-Caribbean community, a minority are Rastafari and follow the dietary regulations with varying degrees of strictness. The most orthodox eat only \"Ital\" or natural foods, in which the matching of herbs or spices with vegetables is the result of long tradition originating from the African ancestry and cultural heritage of Rastafari. \"Ital\", which is derived from the word vital, means essential to human existence. Ital cooking in its strictest form prohibits the use of salt, meat (especially pork), preservatives, colorings, flavorings and anything artificial. Most Rastafari are vegetarian.\n\nThe tenets of Sikhism do not advocate a particular stance on either vegetarianism or the consumption of meat, but leave the decision of diet to the individual. The tenth guru, Guru Gobind Singh, however, prohibited \"Amritdhari\" Sikhs, or those that follow the Sikh Rehat Maryada (the Official Sikh Code of Conduct) from eating Kutha meat, or meat which has been obtained from animals which have been killed in a ritualistic way. This is understood to have been for the political reason of maintaining independence from the then-new Muslim hegemony, as Muslims largely adhere to the ritualistic halal diet.\n\n\"Amritdharis\" that belong to some Sikh sects (e.g. Akhand Kirtani Jatha, Damdami Taksal, Namdhari and Rarionwalay, etc.) are vehemently against the consumption of meat and eggs (though they do consume and encourage the consumption of milk, butter and cheese). This vegetarian stance has been traced back to the times of the British Raj, with the advent of many new Vaishnava converts. In response to the varying views on diet throughout the Sikh population, Sikh Gurus have sought to clarify the Sikh view on diet, stressing their preference only for simplicity of diet. Guru Nanak said that over-consumption of food (Lobh, Greed) involves a drain on the Earth's resources and thus on life. Passages from the \"Guru Granth Sahib\" (the holy book of Sikhs, also known as the \"Adi Granth\") say that it is \"foolish\" to argue for the superiority of animal life, because though all life is related, only human life carries more importance: \"Only fools argue whether to eat meat or not. Who can define what is meat and what is not meat? Who knows where the sin lies, being a vegetarian or a non-vegetarian?\" The Sikh langar, or free temple meal, is largely lacto-vegetarian, though this is understood to be a result of efforts to present a meal that is respectful of the diets of any person who would wish to dine, rather than out of dogma.\n\nEnvironmental vegetarianism is based on the concern that the production of meat and animal products for mass consumption, especially through factory farming, is environmentally unsustainable. According to a 2006 United Nations initiative, the livestock industry is one of the largest contributors to environmental degradation worldwide, and modern practices of raising animals for food contribute on a \"massive scale\" to air and water pollution, land degradation, climate change, and loss of biodiversity. The initiative concluded that \"the livestock sector emerges as one of the top two or three most significant contributors to the most serious environmental problems, at every scale from local to global.\"\n\nIn addition, animal agriculture is a large source of greenhouse gases. According to a 2006 report it is responsible for 18% of the world's greenhouse gas emissions as estimated in 100-year CO equivalents. Livestock sources (including enteric fermentation and manure) account for about 3.1 percent of US anthropogenic GHG emissions expressed as carbon dioxide equivalents. This EPA estimate is based on methodologies agreed to by the Conference of Parties of the UNFCCC, with 100-year global warming potentials from the IPCC Second Assessment Report used in estimating GHG emissions as carbon dioxide equivalents.\n\nMeat produced in a laboratory (called in vitro meat) may be more environmentally sustainable than regularly produced meat. Reactions of vegetarians vary. Rearing a relatively small number of grazing animals can be beneficial, as the Food Climate Research Network at Surrey University reports: \"A little bit of livestock production is probably a good thing for the environment.\n\nIn May 2009, Ghent, Belgium, was reported to be \"the first [city] in the world to go vegetarian at least once a week\" for environmental reasons, when local authorities decided to implement a \"weekly meatless day\". Civil servants would eat vegetarian meals one day per week, in recognition of the United Nations' report. Posters were put up by local authorities to encourage the population to take part on vegetarian days, and \"veggie street maps\" were printed to highlight vegetarian restaurants. In September 2009, schools in Ghent are due to have a weekly \"veggiedag\" (\"vegetarian day\") too.\n\nSome groups, such as PETA, promote vegetarianism as a way to offset poor treatment and working conditions of workers in the contemporary meat industry. These groups cite studies showing the psychological damage caused by working in the meat industry, especially in factory and industrialised settings, and argue that the meat industry violates its labourers' human rights by assigning difficult and distressing tasks without adequate counselling, training and debriefing. However, the working conditions of agricultural workers as a whole, particularly non-permanent workers, remain poor and well below conditions prevailing in other economic sectors. Accidents, including pesticide poisoning, among farmers and plantation workers contribute to increased health risks, including increased mortality. According to the International Labour Organization, agriculture is one of the three most dangerous jobs in the world.\n\nSimilar to environmental vegetarianism is the concept of economic vegetarianism. An economic vegetarian is someone who practices vegetarianism from either the philosophical viewpoint concerning issues such as public health and curbing world starvation, the belief that the consumption of meat is economically unsound, part of a conscious simple living strategy or just out of necessity. According to the Worldwatch Institute, \"Massive reductions in meat consumption in industrial nations will ease their health care burden while improving public health; declining livestock herds will take pressure off rangelands and grainlands, allowing the agricultural resource base to rejuvenate. As populations grow, lowering meat consumption worldwide will allow more efficient use of declining per capita land and water resources, while at the same time making grain more affordable to the world's chronically hungry.\"\n\nPrejudice researcher Gordon Hodson observes that vegetarians and vegans frequently face discrimination where eating meat is held as a cultural norm.\n\nA 1992 market research study conducted by the Yankelovich research organisation concluded that \"of the 12.4 million people [in the US] who call themselves vegetarian, 68% are female, while only 32% are male\".\n\nAt least one study indicates that vegetarian women are more likely to have female babies. A study of 6,000 pregnant women in 1998 \"found that while the national average in Britain is 106 boys born to every 100 girls, for vegetarian mothers the ratio was just 85 boys to 100 girls\". Catherine Collins of the British Dietetic Association has dismissed this as a \"statistical fluke\" given that it is actually the male's genetic contribution which determines the sex of a baby.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "12200878", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12200878", "title": "Viva Piñata: Party Animals", "text": "Viva Piñata: Party Animals\n\nViva Piñata: Party Animals is a video game developed by Krome Studios for the Microsoft Xbox 360 video game console, part of the \"Viva Piñata\" series. The game was announced in July, 2007, and was released on October 30, 2007 in North America, November 15, 2007 in Australia, November 16, 2007 in Europe, and December 6, 2007 in Japan.\n\nUnlike the original \"Viva Piñata\", \"Party Animals\" is based on elements from the television show, including its characters and voices. Furthermore, the title provides a minigame based experience, similar to the \"Mario Party\" series, rather than the sandbox environment of the original. There are over 40 minigames, as well as kart-style races which are conducted on foot.\n\nSimilar to other casual Xbox 360 titles such as \"Fuzion Frenzy 2\", \"Viva Piñata: Party Animals\" is framed as a game show, where contestants compete against each other while announcers provide colorful commentary.\n\nA game of \"Party Animals\" consists of three or more race events, each followed by one or more randomly selected challenge mini-games (depending on selected game length). The goal is to be the player who has earned the most candy (\"Candiosity\") after the final challenge is completed. Games always feature four player characters, although only one of these need be human-controlled. Multiple individuals can play on a single console (causing races to be conducted split-screen), or players can play online via Xbox Live.\n\nPlayers earn candy based on their performance during the challenge mini-games, with fixed awards for first, second, third, and fourth places. The races themselves do not earn players candy, but instead determine a bonus which influences the winnings from the challenge events which follow. As a result, candy awards are always a combination of these two separate placements, with players required to do well in both event types to guarantee overall victory.\n\nThere are eight playable characters: Hudson Horstachio, Paulie Pretztail, Fergy Fudgehog and Franklin Fizzlybear, as well as their newly introduced female counterparts.\n\n\"Viva Piñata: Party Animals\" was developed by a team of roughly 60 people at Krome Studios, the first Australian studio to develop a first-party game for Microsoft. The involvement of Rare, responsible for the original \"Viva Piñata\", was limited to supplying artwork and information about the game's visual style, while Krome retained full control over the design.\n\nWhen asked why the studio was chosen, Microsoft VP Shane Kim explained, \"They've got a long history in the industry and we have a ton of respect for their work\", referring to Krome's previous efforts on series such as \"Ty the Tasmanian Tiger\" and \"Spyro the Dragon\". In the same interview, Kim also noted that the \"Viva Piñata\" franchise was important to the success of the Xbox 360 in the casual game space. He summarized, \"Our aspiration is to win this generation, and in order to do that, we know we have to appeal beyond the core gamer segment\".\n\n\"Viva Piñata: Party Animals\" was not particularly well received by the gaming press, despite the appreciation of its vibrant visuals. IGN criticized the fact that many of the mini-games were simply minor variants of each other, with most being aimed at young children. The review remarks that, \"A few of them will be enjoyable for those under the age of seven, but if you're any older than that there's absolutely no challenge to be found within Party Animals\". The GameSpot review similarly frowned upon the lack of true variety, noting that \"... the [minigame] variants end up feeling so similar to one another that the game might as well just have six minigames\".\n\nSomewhat more positive remarks were earned from TeamXbox, where the reviewer felt that the better mini-games balanced out the poorer ones. The review concludes, \"The wide range of minigames almost guarantees everyone will find at least something they like in the title, and I’ve yet to find anyone who didn’t get a thrill out of the game’s fast paced racing\".\n\n"}
{"id": "17382950", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17382950", "title": "Viva Piñata: Trouble in Paradise", "text": "Viva Piñata: Trouble in Paradise\n\nViva Piñata: Trouble in Paradise is a 2008 simulation video game in the \"Viva Piñata\" series for the Xbox 360. Developed by Rare and published by Microsoft Studios, the game builds atop its predecessor, in which the player tends a garden and the piñata creatures that come to live there. New features to the series include a cooperative multiplayer mode, a new plot, additional types of piñata creatures, Xbox Live Vision Camera support, and two new areas for capturing piñatas.\n\nMicrosoft considered \"Viva Piñata\" a success and the sequel's development team sought to make a more definitive version of the original. The team re-used many of the development infrastructure set up for its predecessor and exhausted their gameplay ideas for the piñata gardening concept. The game released to generally favorable reviews in September 2008. Critics considered the game more accessible to newcomers and a worthwhile improvement on the original, but altogether closer to an expansion than a unique sequel. Reviewers praised its game design tweaks, but were mixed on its multiplayer modes and camera integration. Critics were mixed on whether the sequel would attract new players to the franchise. \"Trouble in Paradise\" was later included in the developer's 2015 Xbox One retrospective compilation, \"Rare Replay\".\n\nApart from a few new features, \"Trouble in Paradise\" is nearly identical to its predecessor, the 2006 \"Viva Piñata\", in gameplay: The player acts as a gardener whose land is visited by piñata creatures. The creatures are stylized like piñatas but have the qualities of animals. Creature types include ladybugs, crabs, geckos, gorillas, and vultures, among others. The player plants seeds, tends to plants, and digs ponds within the garden's boundaries. New types of piñata creatures visit and eventually come to reside in the garden when certain prerequisites are met. For instance, a piñata might be attracted to a garden with a specific plant, type of piñata, or amount of soil. The player uses an in-game encyclopedia to learn each piñata type's preferences, which grow in complexity: advanced creatures require more transformative changes to the garden or many other piñatas to eat. When multiple piñatas are satisfied, the player can \"romance\" two to make a baby piñata. The player continues to cultivate the garden and the piñata creatures to grow in experience level and unlock upgrades in garden size and gardening tools. An in-game store sells seeds, items, and upgrades. Both games are rendered in the same engine and their supporting casts are the same. The first game's online piñata gifting feature returns in \"Trouble in Paradise\".\n\nAtop the previous formula is a new plot, a cooperative multiplayer mode, Xbox Live Vision Camera support, 32 new types of piñata creatures, and two separate areas to trap piñatas. These latter areas—the Dessert Desert and Piñarctic—let the player set traps for wandering piñatas to bait, capture, and return to the garden. At a later player experience level, the player can add sand and ice to their main garden for the piñatas. In the new plot, the player must repopulate a database of piñata information that has been maliciously erased. \"Trouble in Paradise\" includes new challenges in which the player finds and indulges a specific piñata with actions it likes such that the piñata can be sent happily to a party somewhere around the world. The game also adds fashion show and side-scrolling racing minigames. A new \"Trick Stick\" lets players teach piñatas to perform new tricks. Up to four players can join together on Xbox Live to garden in the same plot. The plot's owner can set restrictions on what other players can access. Up to two players can join together locally on the same Xbox 360. The game's additional \"Just for Fun\" mode is designed for younger children by eliminating monetary restrictions, evil piñatas, and ruffian characters that might otherwise frustrate the player. These malicious \"sour\" piñatas, who try to poison the other piñatas, can be tamed to peaceably join the player's garden. Players can use the Xbox Live Vision Camera to scan collectible cards and unlock piñatas and items. New controls were added to streamline the player's interface interactions, and a leaderboard added for players to compare their progress.\n\nAs Rare released the original \"Viva Piñata\" for the Xbox 360 in 2006, its development team saw it as incomplete. The developers had cut partial ideas from the release to meet their deadlines. Rare's Gregg Mayles said that the game sold well and steadily on par with their expectations and Xbox's Phil Spencer added that the game was considered a success inside the company. The team incorporated player feedback and worked towards a \"more definitive version\" of the original. Mayles left the team to work on \"\" and Justin Cook became the team's lead designer. The sequel was built atop the original and the developers re-used many of the tools from the original game's development. In both the sequel and the original, the development team volunteered to record the sounds used for the piñatas. One of the team's new ideas was \"Piñata Vision\", a feature that detects printed cards via the Xbox camera to change the in-game environment (e.g., adding piñatas or altering the weather). Near the time of the sequel's release, Rare's Mayles figured that the team would likely not have enough new gameplay ideas to warrant a sequel to \"Trouble in Paradise\", though Cook said that he would work on the game's shop interface had he more time. \"Trouble in Paradise\" released in early September 2008. The two \"Viva Piñata\" console games were later re-released in the 2015 compilation of Rare games, \"Rare Replay\", but the server that handled their piñata sharing features had been shut down by that time.\n\nThe game received \"generally favorable\" reviews, according to video game review aggregator Metacritic. Critics had found its predecessor surprisingly engaging, and thought that \"Trouble in Paradise\" additions made it the definitive \"Viva Piñata\" release. Critics agreed that the changes made the game friendlier for new players and children. They appreciated the new game's improvements, but some were disappointed that the base game was essentially unchanged. Reviewers considered \"Trouble in Paradise\" to be an expansion of the original game rather than a unique sequel.\n\nCritics praised \"Trouble in Paradise\" new features. Mc Shea (\"GameSpot\") thought that the sequel's in-game challenges resolved the core issue of the original game—the lack of motivation to continue breeding new species, whereas the challenges direct players to collect new species. He appreciated the two new trap areas for adding to the game's variety of characters, though he did not find the actual laying of traps and transport of piñatas interesting. Geddes (\"IGN\") thought that it felt wrong but oddly satisfying to put piñatas in captivity. He considered the trap areas a good idea but unwelcome as another obstacle in the animal acquisition process. Geddes praised \"Trouble in Paradise\" cooperative features, but found local cooperative to lose most of the benefits of efficient multitasking. Mc Shea (\"GameSpot\") on the other hand felt that it was strange to be on either side of the cooperative gardening experience, which lacks the game's creative element when the visitor is directed by the garden's owner. Bramwell (\"Eurogamer\") saw a lack of depth in the online gameplay, both in feelings of connections with others and in how online matchmaking became a brief \"show and tell\" of a garden instead of a cross-exchange like in \"Animal Crossing\" or \"Spore\". Reviewers agreed that cooperative was useful for introducing new players to the game.\n\nReviewers considered some of the smaller additions useful and others gimmicky. Critics appreciated the release's time-saving interface tweaks and overall pacing, but thought, for instance, that the vision camera integration added little to the game. While \"Electronic Gaming Monthly\" had wanted more development of the story, Mc Shea (\"GameSpot\") was grateful that the story remained in the background of the game. While \"Electronic Gaming Monthly\" wrote that loading times had been improved, Geddes (\"IGN\") considered them \"frustratingly long\". Considering the previous game's slow start, Tom Bramwell (\"Eurogamer\") thought that \"Trouble in Paradise\" did a better job of introducing the player to the world by pre-loading player gardens with animals, plants, and decorations, and offering a tutorial. He wondered whether the game went too far, from too slow to hyperactive.\n\nReviewers praised \"Trouble in Paradise\" bright visuals and cute characters. Mc Shea (\"GameSpot\") was impressed by the game's visuals and wrote that players would continue playing the game if only to unlock nuanced, animated video of piñatas acting cute during major life milestones. Mc Shea recalled the human helper characters as an exception, who were off-putting with creepy masks and \"offensive\" voice acting. \"IGN\" praised the game's surround sound but not its soundtrack's composition, and Mc Shea (\"GameSpot\") considered the voice acting harsh against the game's otherwise tranquil mood.\n\nMc Shea (\"GameSpot\") called \"Trouble in Paradise\" \"a safe sequel to a great game\". Ultimately, Geddes (\"IGN\") wrote that an expansion pack on the original game would have served the same function. Even with \"Trouble in Paradise\" upgraded controls, Bramwell (\"Eurogamer\") preferred the precision of the Nintendo DS version's stylus or of a computer mouse, and thought the game could be further simplified. However, he saw the new release as a more polished opportunity to attract an audience that was not originally convinced by the reception of the first game. \"Electronic Gaming Monthly\" said that players that hated the original game would not be swayed by the sequel. \"GameSpot\" 2008 year in review staff nominated \"Trouble in Paradise\" as the \"Best Game No One Played\", which it did not win.\n"}
