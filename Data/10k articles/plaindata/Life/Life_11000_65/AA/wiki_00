It gained some international popularity for alleged links with the Preacher to the Papal Household, Franciscan Capuchin Raniero Cantalamessa. Informal membership is estimated at a few hundreds, mostly Italian.\n\nIn an interview Moccia described the method as a path to \"individual development and self-knowledge\". Some of Arkeon's key values are the \"feeling of belonging\", the spirit of fatherhood, the rites of passage, the devotion to ancestors, the strength which comes from courage and from being authentic. According to Moccia, these values are those of the \"civilization of farmers\", which he believes are being lost in modern society.\n\nArkeon was founded in 1999 by Vito Carlo Moccia and others, based on their experience in teaching reiki. Moccia, described as the first Italian Reiki Master, initiated by Phyllis Furumoto, seems to have expanded the original teaching in different directions. Apparently, his method had become too different from Furumoto's and a different designation was needed.\n\nIn 2004, after the appearance of an article on a Roman Catholic catechism magazine, Cantalamessa interviewed Vito Carlo Moccia for the TV show run by the Capuchin friar on the national Italian television (RAI). The topic was the father-son relationship.\n\nIn October 2007, after a series of extremely critical TV shows, with accounts of purported victims, and calls for police action by an Italian anti-cult movement organization, the Public Prosecutor's Office of Bari, Italy, started an investigation on Moccia and five other members of the movement. Arkeon seminars were suspended. At the beginning of April 2008, the investigation was still pending. Several forms of abuse are being alleged. Arkeon members deny any criminal wrongdoing.\n\nAfter his contacts with Arkeon were exposed, Cantalamessa, in an interview, said that \"he had not participated to any meeting\", but also called the media campaign on Arkeon a \"witch-hunt\".\n\nIn 2008, the Italian psychologist and theologian Raffaella Di Marzio, a leading Italian cult expert, began a research study on the movement. After collecting some interviews and participating in a meeting with members, she was accused by Italian police of joining a criminal conspiracy and attempting to continue Moccia's abuses as the new leader of Arkeon. Colleagues and observers reacted with disbelief.\n\n"}

Her other assistant producing credits included \"Hideaway\" in 1995, \"Race the Sun\" in 1996, and \"The Edge\" in 1997.\n\nSt. Clair and Brosnan were longtime friends by the mid-1990s. Brosnan had starred as James Bond in 1995's \"GoldenEye\", the seventeenth film in the Bond series. \"Goldeneye\", a commercial success, was a boost to Brosnan's career. He and St. Clair decided to begin producing films. In a 2014 interview, Brosnan recalled, \"When GoldenEye … had the success that it had, we said, 'Let’s make movies. Let's step forth and create our own projects.' It’s as simple as that, really.\" Together, Beau St. Clair and Pierce established the Irish DreamTime production company in 1996, with additional backing from Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM).\n\nUnder St. Clair and Brosnan, Irish DreamTime produced and released ten films between 1998 and 2016. Their first production was \"The Nephew\", a drama released in 1998. They then credited the 1999 remake, \"The Thomas Crown Affair\", which starred Brosnan and Rene Russo. Other Irish DreamTime films have included \"Evelyn\" in 2002, \"Laws of Attraction\" in 2004, \"The Matador\" in 2005, and \"The November Man\" in 2014.

As of 2017, there are at least 300 people in South Korea under a death sentence. Executions are carried out by hanging. \n\nOn August 27, 2015, the Supreme Court sentenced a man called \"Jiang Jaechin\" to death for multiple murder, rape, and child rape. This is the last civilian on death row.\n\nOn February 19, 2016, the Supreme Court upheld the death sentence passed on a man known by the surname 'Lim', a 24-year-old Army sergeant who killed five fellow soldiers and injured seven others in a shooting rampage near the border with North Korea in 2014. He became the 361st person on death row in South Korea. According to Yonhap, of the 361 people on death row, 45, including Lim, were soldiers.\n\nExecutions in Korea have existed since the Joseon Period. The purpose of executions was to cause reactions and stop crimes. Methods of executions included slow slicing, hanging, and dismemberment. Heads of executed people have always been used as warnings to others. Specifically, dismembered heads were displayed to the public both to serve as public warning and enforce military courtesy. However, bodies of executed people were allowed funeral proceedings.\n\nIn contemporary history, the first execution law was established on March 25, 1895, by the Supreme Court of Judicature of Japan acting under the Constitution of the Empire of Japan. The first death sentence was given four days later, on March 29, 1895 to Jeon Bongjun. Since 1948, a total of 902 people have been executed.\n\nCurrently, the Penal Code of South Korea regulates executions as a form of punishment for some crimes according to the Criminal Law section 41. Those crimes include: Rebellion (Section 87), Conspiracy with foreign countries (Section 92), homicide (Section 250), robbery-homicide (Section 338), and other 12 sections. People under 18 cannot be executed according to Juvenile Law (Section 59, Juvenile Law).\n\nIn February 1998, then-president Kim Dae-jung enacted a moratorium on executions. This moratorium is still in effect as of 2013. Thus, executions in Korea are considered to be abolished de facto. The last executions took place in December 1997, when 23 people (who has murdered at least 2 people) were put to death. However, there are still at least 60 people with a death sentence, as of 2013.\n\nIn 2010 the Constitutional Court of Korea ruled that capital punishment did not violate “human dignity and worth” in the Constitution of the Republic of Korea. In a five-to-four decision, capital punishment was upheld as constitutional. Institutions such as Amnesty International considered this a ‘major setback for South Korea'. Later in 2010, Justice Minister Lee Kwi-nam alluded to a possibility of resuming executions. In 2013, three bills which proposed abolishment of the death penalty lapsed at the end of the National Assembly’s term.\n\nExecutions are still a matter of debate. People have called for executions for violent crimes, especially those involving rape of minors.\n\nA 2017 poll found younger South Koreans are more likely to support capital punishment than older ones. People in their 20s were the most supportive at 62.6 percent.\n\nKang Ho-sun was convicted of kidnapping and killing eight women between 2006 and 2008, and of burning to death his wife and mother-in-law in 2005. Kang, 38, was arrested in January for the murder of a female college student and later confessed to killing and secretly burying seven other women. Other death row inmates include Yoo Young-chul and members of the Chijon family, a former gang of cannibals.\n\nIn March 2010, in contrast to prior speculations, Minister Lee Kwi-nam hinted that the executions of death row inmates will resume, breaking the virtual 13-year moratorium. The remarks came a few days after Kim Kil-tae, who raped and murdered a 15-year-old schoolgirl, was convicted. However, this did not happen.\n\nIn December 2010, Kimk's death sentence was reduced to life imprisonment and the prosecutors did not appeal to the Supreme Court.\n"}

Martin also played for the Birmingham Stallions of the USFL, the Edmonton Eskimos of the CFL, and the Houston Oilers and Atlanta Falcons in the NFL.\n\nMartin attended Cherokee High School in Canton, Georgia and was nicknamed \"Too Mean\" for his tendency to pile on ball carriers after the whistle. He originally dropped out of school at age 14 but then rejoined to play football. He originally signed to play college football at Western Carolina, but followed assistant coach Joe D'Alessandris to Livingston University. He then went on to play at The University of West Alabama (then known as Livingston), and was a Division II All-American. Martin was All-Gulf South Conference two years at Livingston, and was the Defensive Player of the Year in 1982.\n\nMartin began his pro football career with the Birmingham Stallions of the USFL in 1983, but was cut after his first season.\n\nMartin was signed by the Edmonton Eskimos of the Canadian Football League in early 1984 but was cut before he could make it through a season.\n\nMartin immediately jumped into a starting role once he was signed by the Green Bay Packers. He signed with the Packers after he was not selected in the Supplemental Draft. \n\nDuring pre-game warm-ups, Martin displayed a white hand-towel with a list of five Bears offensive players' numbers: 9 for Jim McMahon, 34 for Walter Payton, 83 for Willie Gault, 63 for Jay Hilgenberg and 29 for Dennis Gentry. Martin wore the towel during the game. He allegedly claimed that it was a hit-list. After Bears quarterback Jim McMahon threw an interception, Martin grabbed him from behind and body-slammed him shoulder first to the ground. Replays showed that Martin hit McMahon at least two seconds after the pass was thrown, well after McMahon was out of the play. McMahon landed full force on his previously injured shoulder, a situation exacerbated by Soldier Field's artificial turf surface of the time—and was knocked out for the rest of the season. Martin was ejected from the game by referee Jerry Markbreit and suspended for two games. Markbreit later said that Martin complained about the ejection until the threat of letting Bears players come after him was spoken. After the game, the Packers defensive coordinator defended Martin, saying \"We tell people that if we intercept a pass, go get anybody near you.\" This was the first multi-game suspension for an on-field incident in modern NFL history, and would remain the longest suspension for an on-field incident until Albert Haynesworth of the Tennessee Titans was suspended five games for stomping on the head of Dallas Cowboys center Andre Gurode in 2006.\n\nMartin played for the Packers from 1984–1987. He was cut early in the 1987 season after being implicated in a Green Bay bar fight.\n\nMartin played for the Oilers in the latter part of the 1987 season. In a game against the Pittsburgh Steelers, Martin speared Steelers running back Earnest Jackson, sparking a rivalry between Oilers coach Jerry Glanville and Steelers coach Chuck Noll.\n\nHe closed out his career with the Falcons in 1988, the only season in which he did not start a game.\n\nMartin was suspended two games in 1986 due to an incident at a bar. He later went into alcohol abuse treatment, and divorced both of his wives. He was arrested for disorderly conduct in 1987 for throwing an egg at the car of an NFL replacement player. Martin died in 2005 at age 45 in Houston due to complications from kidney failure.\n\n"}
{"id": "17271139", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17271139", "title": "Cognitive acceleration", "text": "Cognitive acceleration\n\nCognitive acceleration or CA is an approach to teaching designed to develop students' thinking ability, developed by Michael Shayer and Philip Adey from 1981 at King's College London . The approach builds on work by Jean Piaget and Lev Vygotsky and takes a constructivist approach.\n\nFrom Piaget, CA recognises there are stages in intellectual development. At school the most important transition is from concrete thinking - which deals with facts and descriptions, to abstract thinking - any thinking which involves a mental process. From Vygotsky, CA takes the concept of Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD): the difference between what a learner can do with and without help. The CA method requires a mediator to ask questions that allow \"guided self-discovery\". Mediation is effective between peers and promotes the idea of pupils working in groups to solve a problem.\n\nThe first teaching materials, written for Years 7 and 8 (ages 11–13) science lessons, were called Cognitive Acceleration through Science Education (CASE). After three years the results of intervening in science teaching in a dozen classes were compared with control classes which were taught in the usual way. The CASE learners not only scored about one grade better in their GCSE science, but Maths and English GCSE grades were improved by about the same amount. It is rare to see such ‘transfer’ of learning to other subjects in educational research.\n\nUsing the CA approach in teaching primary and secondary maths, known as CAME, produced similar results. Later development extended the range of lesson activities in primary science from the Foundation Stage through to year 5. Currently under development are activities for English at Key Stage 3. Several articles highlighting the effectiveness of CASE and CAME have appeared in the Times Educational Supplement (TES). Let's Think Forum (LT) produces CA packages for core subjects in primary and secondary education.\n\nCA acknowledges a set of subskills which underpin abstract thinking and shares with constructivism the view that concepts cannot be learned in the same way as facts and descriptions. Learners need to \"construct\" meaning for themselves. Lessons centre on a challenge which can only be mastered by using an abstract idea. Early CASE lessons focus on: classification, scale, ratio, proportion, probability, variables, fair testing.\n\nThe teacher sets up good learning-context and intervenes to guide the learners toward the learning goal. A mediator asks probing questions: \"What do you think?\", \"Which one will heat up most?\" \"What's happening to the atoms?\" gradually leading the learners to discover the answer for themselves. The mediator can offer clues which direct the learner, improving the chance of successful thinking.\n\nLessons which develop abstract thinking directly have the following structure.\n\nSetting the scene Concrete preparation serves a similar purpose to the \"bridging\" section and links the activity to current knowledge, explains the task and checks vocabulary.\n\nChallenge Challenge must be set just above the current level of secure knowledge - hard enough to be a challenge, but not so hard as to make the learners switch off. In a science lesson this can take the form of a demonstration with an unexpected effect. In English it could be reading a text which has an implied meaning.\n\nGroup work The teacher cannot be the mediator for every child in the class. If pupils work in groups and discuss their ideas (social construction) there are several benefits:\n\nPlenary Once the groups have solutions, the class shares ideas. The teacher does not give the answer but asks a group for a solution, then asks another if they agree or disagree and why. The discussion continues until there is agreement. The teacher leads the group towards the answer through questioning.\n\nMeta cognition During group-work and the plenary, the teacher asks questions that reveal the thinking process, meta-cognition, which has been shown to be effective in securing knowledge. The learner has to enunciate a line of thinking - making the process available to others.\n\nBridging Knowledge in isolation from the learner's secure knowledge is usually lost. The learner needs to bridge new learning to existing experiences. CA lessons conclude with a discussion about where ideas could be used in everyday life, the same concept as \"scaffolding\" in constructivism.\n\n\nFor CASE\n\nFor CAME\n"}

He was the younger son of Newaya Krestos.\n\nTaddesse Tamrat discusses a tradition that early in his reign, Dawit campaigned against Egypt, reaching as far north as Aswan. In response, the Emir forced the Patriarch of Alexandria, Matthew I, to send a deputation to Dawit to persuade him to retire back to his kingdom. Taddesse concludes, \"There seems to be little or no doubt that, on the eve of the advent of the Burji dynasty of Mamluk Egypt, King Dawit had in fact led his troops beyond the northern frontiers of his kingdom, and created much havoc among the Muslim inhabitants of the area who had been within the sphere of influence of Egypt since the thirteenth century.\" The Emperor apparently had a much friendlier relationship with the Sultan's successor, for according to the medieval historian al-Maqrizi, Dawit sent 22 camels laden with gifts to Berkuk, the first Sultan of the Burji dynasty.\n\nHe confronted the problem of raids from the Muslim kingdoms on his eastern border with numerous counterattacks on those kingdoms. According to al-Maqrizi, in 1403 Emperor Dawit pursued the Sultan of Adal, Sa'ad ad-Din II, to Zeila, where he killed Sa'ad ad-Din and sacked the city. However, another contemporary source dates the death of Sa'ad ad-Din to 1415, and gives the credit to Emperor Yeshaq.\n\nDawit sent an embassy to Europe, which had reached Venice by 23 June 1402, requesting that a number of artisans are sent to his domain. Carlo Conti Rossini assembled the surviving documents concerning this visit in 1927, which record that five artisans departed with the Ethiopian envoy that August, but not if they arrived in Ethiopia. However, Marilyn E. Heldman found evidence of a \"silver-gilt chalice\" made in Venice, which, if it was the one Francisco Álvares described as seeing in Ethiopia, did reach Dawit. Another possible sign of their arrival is an itinerary of a journey from Venice by Rhodes, Cyprus, Jerusalem, Cairo and Axum to the court of Preste John in Shewa. which O. G. S. Crawford dates to Dawit's reign. Crawford considers this document the \"first unambiguous account of Abyssinian geography which has survived; it certainly refers to the journey of a European, and the route followed can be identified pretty accurately.\"\n\nA noted horseman, Dawit was killed when he was kicked in the head by one of his horses. His body was interred in the monastery of St. Stephen on Daga Island in Lake Tana.\n\nThe Emperor Dawit was an enthusiastic Christian. He dealt with a revolt of the Beta Israel in Tigray, and encouraged missionary work in Gojjam. According to E. A. Wallis Budge, during Dawit's reign, a piece of the True Cross arrived in Ethiopia. He also made endowments to the Ethiopian Church: three charters survive of grants he made of lands in Wolqayt, Serae, Adiyabo, Shire, Addi Arkay, northern Semien, the Gar'alta, Manbarta, and Karnesem which lies north of present-day Asmara.\n\nDuring Dawit's time atop the throne, two surviving examples of illustrated manuscripts were produced. One is a translation of the \"Miracles of Mary\", which had been written in Arabic, done at the command of Emperor Dawit. This is the oldest surviving illustrated book commissioned by an Ethiopian Emperor. The other, described as \"one of the most beautiful illustrated books of the period\", is a copy of the gospels, which is now preserved at the monastery of Saint Gabriel on Kebran Island in southern Lake Tana.\n"}
{"id": "45240511", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=45240511", "title": "Death of Elisa Lam", "text": "Death of Elisa Lam\n\nThe body of Elisa Lam, also known by her Cantonese name, Lam Ho Yi (; April 30, 1991 – February 2013), a Canadian student at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, was recovered from a water tank atop the Cecil Hotel in Downtown Los Angeles on February 19, 2013. She had been reported missing at the beginning of the month. Maintenance workers at the hotel discovered the body when investigating guest complaints of problems with the water supply.\n\nHer disappearance had been widely reported; interest had increased five days prior to her body's discovery when the Los Angeles Police Department released video of the last time she was known to have been seen, on the day of her disappearance, by an elevator security camera. In the footage, Lam is seen exiting and re-entering the elevator, talking and gesturing in the hallway outside, and sometimes seeming to hide within the elevator, which itself appears to be malfunctioning. The video went viral on the Internet, with many viewers reporting that they found it unsettling. Explanations ranged from claims of paranormal involvement to bipolar disorder from which Lam suffered; it has also been argued that the video was altered prior to release.\n\nThe circumstances of Lam's death, once she was found, also raised questions, especially in light of the Cecil's history in relation to other notable deaths and murders. Her body was naked with most of her clothes and personal effects floating in the water near her. It took the Los Angeles County Coroner's office four months, after repeated delays, to release the autopsy report, which reports no evidence of physical trauma and states that the manner of death was accidental. Guests at the Cecil, now re-branded as Stay on Main, sued the hotel over the incident, and Lam's parents filed a separate suit later that year; the latter was dismissed in 2015. Some of the early Internet interest noted what were considered to be unusual similarities between Lam's death and the 2005 horror film \"Dark Water\". The case has since been referenced in international popular culture.\n\nLam, the daughter of emigrants from Hong Kong who opened a restaurant in Burnaby, just outside Vancouver, Canada, was a student at the University of British Columbia although she was not registered at the beginning of 2013.\n\nShe traveled alone, on Amtrak and intercity buses. She visited the San Diego Zoo and posted photos taken there on social media. On January 26, she arrived in Los Angeles. After two days, she checked into the Cecil Hotel, near downtown's Skid Row. She was initially assigned a shared room on the hotel's fifth floor; however, her roommates complained about what the hotel's lawyer would later describe as \"certain odd behavior,\" and she was moved to a room of her own after two days.\n\nBuilt as a business hotel in the 1920s, the Cecil fell on hard times during the Great Depression of the 1930s and never recaptured its original market as downtown decayed around it in the late 20th century. Several of Los Angeles's more notable murders have happened at or have connections to the hotel: Elizabeth Short, victim of the Black Dahlia murder, the city's best-known unsolved killing, supposedly made the Cecil her last stop before her death, and in 1964, Goldie Osgood, the \"Pigeon Lady of Pershing Square,\" was raped and murdered in her room at the Cecil, another crime that has never been solved. Serial killers Jack Unterweger and Richard Ramirez, the \"Night Stalker\", both resided at the Cecil while active. There have also been suicides, one of which also killed a pedestrian in the front of the hotel. After recent renovations, it has tried to market itself as a boutique hotel, but the reputation lingers. \"The Cecil will reveal to you whatever it is you're a fugitive from,\" says Steve Erickson, a journalist who spent a night in the hotel after Lam's death.\n\nLam had been diagnosed with bipolar disorder and depression. She had been prescribed four medications—Wellbutrin, Lamictal, Seroquel and Effexor—to treat her disorders. According to her family, who supposedly kept her history of mental illness a secret, she had no history of suicidal ideations or attempts, although one report claimed she had previously gone missing for a brief period.\n\nIn mid-2010, she began a blog named Ether Fields on Blogspot. Over the next two years, she posted pictures of models in fashionable clothing and accounts of her life, particularly her struggle with mental illness. In a January 2012 blog post, Lam lamented that a \"relapse\" at the start of the current school term had forced her to drop several classes, leaving her feeling \"so utterly directionless and lost.\" She titled her post, \"You're always haunted by the idea you're wasting your life\" after a quotation from novelist Chuck Palahniuk. She used that quote as an epigraph for her blog. She worried that her transcript would look suspicious with so many withdrawals and that it would result in her being unable to continue her studies and attend graduate school.\n\nA little over two years after Lam had started blogging, she announced she would be abandoning her blog for another she had started on Tumblr, Nouvelle/Nouveau. Its content mostly consisted of found fashion photos and quotes and a few posts in Lam's own words. The same Palahniuk quote was used as an epigraph.\n\nLam contacted her parents in British Columbia every day while traveling. On January 31, 2013, the day she was scheduled to check out of the Cecil and leave for Santa Cruz, they did not hear from her and called the Los Angeles police; her family flew to Los Angeles to help with the search.\n\nHotel staff who saw her that day said she was alone. Outside the hotel, Katie Orphan, manager of a nearby bookstore, was the only person who recalled seeing Lam that day. \"She was outgoing, very lively, very friendly,\" while getting gifts to take home to her family, Orphan told CNN. \"[She was] talking about what book she was getting and whether or not what she was getting would be too heavy for her to carry around as she traveled,\" Orphan added.\n\nPolice searched the hotel to the extent that they legally could. They searched Lam's room and had dogs go through the building, including the rooftop, but the canines were unsuccessful in detecting her scent. \"But we didn't search every room,\" Sgt. Rudy Lopez said later, \"we could only do that if we had probable cause\" to believe a crime had been committed.\n\nOn February 6, a week after Lam had last been seen, the LAPD decided more help was needed. Flyers with her image were posted in the neighborhood and online. It brought the case to the public's attention through the media.\n\nOn February 14, after another week with no sign of her, the LAPD released a video of the last known sighting of her taken in one of the Cecil's elevators by a video surveillance camera on February 1. It drew worldwide interest in the case due to Lam's strange behavior and has been extensively analyzed and discussed.\n\nIn the clip, the camera at one of the elevator cab's rear corners looks down from the ceiling, offering a view not just of its interior but the hallway outside. It is somewhat grainy, and the timestamp at the bottom is obscured. At some points Lam's mouth is pixelized.\n\nAt the start, Lam enters, clad in a red zippered hooded sweatshirt over a gray T-shirt, with black shorts and sandals. She enters from the left and goes to the control panel, appears to select several floors and then steps back to the corner. After a few seconds during which the door fails to close, she steps up to it, leans forward so her head is through the door, looks in both directions, and then quickly steps back in, backing up to the wall and then into the corner near the control panel. The door remains open.\n\nShe walks to it again and stands in the doorway, leaning on the side. Suddenly she steps out into the hall, then to her side, back in, looking to the side, then back out. She then steps sideways again, and for a few seconds she is mostly invisible behind the wall she has her back to just outside. The door remains open.\n\nHer right arm can be seen going up to her head, and then she turns to re-enter the cab, putting both hands on the side of the door. She then goes to the control panel, presses many more buttons, some more than once, and then returns to the wall she had come into the elevator from, putting both hands over her ears again briefly as she walks back to the section of wall she had been standing against before. The door remains open.\n\nShe turns to her right and begins rubbing her forearms together, then waves her hands out to her sides with palms flat and fingers outstretched, while bowing forward slightly and rocking gently. This can all be seen through the door, which remains open. After she backs to the wall again and walks away to the left, it finally closes.\n\nIt was reposted widely, including to the Chinese video-sharing site Youku, where it got 3 million views and 40,000 comments in its first 10 days. Many of the commenters found it unsettling to watch.\n\nSeveral theories evolved to explain her actions. One was that Lam was trying to get the elevator car to move in order to escape from someone pursuing her. Others suggested that she might be under the influence of ecstasy or some other party drug. When her bipolar disorder became known, the theory that she was having a psychotic episode also emerged.\n\nOther viewers argued that the video had been tampered with before being made public. Despite the obscuring of the timestamp, they claimed, parts had been slowed down, and nearly a minute of footage had been discreetly removed. This could have been done simply to protect the identity of someone who otherwise would be in the video but had little or nothing to do with the case, or to conceal evidence if Lam's disappearance and death had been the result of a criminal act.\n\nDuring the search for Lam, guests at the hotel began complaining about low water pressure. Some later claimed their water was colored black, and had an unusual taste.\nOn the morning of February 19, Lam's body was found in one of four 1,000-gallon (3,785 L) tanks providing water to guest rooms, a kitchen, and a coffee shop. The tank was drained and cut open since its maintenance hatch was too small to accommodate equipment needed to remove Lam's body.\n\nOn February 21, the Los Angeles coroner's office issued a finding of accidental drowning, with bipolar disorder as a significant factor.\nThe full coroner's report, released in June, stated that Lam's body had been found naked; clothing similar to that she was wearing in the elevator video was floating in the water, coated with a \"sand-like particulate\". Her watch and room key were also found with her.\n\nLam's body was moderately decomposed and bloated. It was mostly greenish, with some marbling evident on the abdomen and skin separation evident. There was no evidence of physical trauma, sexual assault, or suicide.\nToxicology testsincomplete because not enough of her blood was preservedshowed traces consistent with prescription medication found among her belongings, plus nonprescription drugs such as Sinutab and ibuprofen. A very small quantity of alcohol (about 0.02 g%) was present, but no other recreational drugs.\n\nThe investigation had determined how Lam died, but did not offer an explanation as to how she got into the tank in the first place. Doors and stairs that access the hotel's roof are locked, with only staff having the passcodes and keys, and any attempt to force them would supposedly have triggered an alarm. However, the hotel's fire escape could have allowed her to bypass those security measures, if she (or someone who might have accompanied her there) had known. A video made by a Chinese user after Lam's death and posted to the Internet showed that the hotel's roof was easily accessible via the fire escape and that two of the lids of the water tanks were open.\n\nApart from the question of how she got on the roof, others asked if she could have gotten into the tank by herself. All four tanks are cylinders propped up on concrete blocks; there is no fixed access to them and hotel workers had to use a ladder to look at the water. They are protected by heavy lids that would be difficult to replace from within. Police dogs that searched through the hotel for Lam, even on the roof, shortly after her disappearance was noted, did not find any trace of her (although they had not searched the area near the water tanks).\n\nTheories about Lam's behavior in the elevator video did not stop with her death. Some argued that she was attempting to hide from a pursuer, perhaps someone ultimately responsible for her death, while others said she was merely frustrated with the elevator's apparent malfunction. Some proponents of the theory that she was under the influence of illicit drugs are not dissuaded by their absence from the toxicology screen, suggesting that they might have broken down during the period of time her body decomposed in the tank, or that she might have taken rare cocktails of such drugs that a normal screen would not detect.\n\nThe autopsy report and its conclusions have also been questioned. For instance, it does not say what the results of the rape kit and fingernail kit were, or even if they were processed. It also records subcutaneous pooling of blood in Lam's anal area, which some observers suggested was a sign of sexual abuse; however one pathologist has noted it could also have resulted from bloating in the course of the body's decomposition, and her rectum was also prolapsed.\n\nEven the coroner's pathologists appeared to be ambivalent about their conclusion that Lam's death was accidental. One page of the report has a form with boxes to check as to whether the death was accidental, natural, homicide, suicide or undetermined, in large type and a sufficient distance from each other. The \"accident\" box is dated June 15; however three days later the \"undetermined\" box was checked instead. This was at some point in the three days before the report's release noted as an error and crossed out and initialed.\n\nSince her death, her Tumblr blog was updated, presumably through Tumblr's Queue option which allows posts to automatically publish themselves when the user is away. Her phone was not found either with her body or in her hotel room; it has been assumed to have been stolen at some time around her death. Whether the continued updates to her blog were facilitated by the theft of her phone, the work of a hacker, or through the Queue, is not known; nor is it known whether the updates are related to her death.\n\nIn September, Lam's parents filed a wrongful death suit, claiming the hotel failed to \"inspect and seek out hazards in the hotel that presented an unreasonable risk of danger to (Lam) and other hotel guests\" and seeking unspecified damages and burial costs.\nThe hotel argued it could not have reasonably foreseen that Lam might have entered the water tanks, and that since it remained unknown how Lam got to the water tank no liability could be assigned for failing to prevent that.\nIn 2015, the suit was dismissed.\n\nThe circumstances of Lam's death have been compared to plot elements in the 2005 horror film \"Dark Water\". In that film, an American remake of an earlier Japanese film of the same name based on a 1996 short story by Koji Suzuki, a mother and daughter move into a rundown apartment building. A dysfunctional elevator and discolored water gushing from the building's faucets eventually lead them to the building's rooftop water tank, where they discover the body of a girl who had been reported missing from the building a year earlier.\n\nAs life had imitated art with \"Dark Water\", the creators of films and television shows used the Lam case as inspiration for their own works. In May 2013, the episode \"Watershed\" aired as that year's season finale of the ABC series \"Castle\", in which a New York police detective and the title character, a mystery novelist, investigate crimes. In \"Watershed\", the duo pursue leads in the death of a young woman found dead in the rooftop water tank of the \"Cedric Hotel\" in Manhattan; among the evidence is a surveillance video of the woman taken in an elevator. Ultimately she is found to have been posing as a prostitute in order to investigate another guest at the hotel.\n\nAnother ABC series, \"How to Get Away with Murder\", had a similar story line. Over a series of flashbacks spread out across the first season, which began airing in 2014, it is revealed that a sorority girl missing at the start of the season was murdered and that her body has been hidden in the water tank on the roof of the sorority house. Similarly, her body is only discovered when a maintenance worker is called to the house to address a water pressure issue.\n\nIn Hong Kong, from which Lam's family had emigrated to Vancouver, filmmakers were also inspired by the case. Nick Cheung, an accomplished actor in Hong Kong films, made his directorial debut in 2014 with \"Hungry Ghost Ritual\", a horror thriller that includes a scene in which a ghost terrorizes a young woman in an elevator, shot to look like security-camera footage and believed to have been inspired by the Cecil's Lam footage. In mainland China, director Liu Hao announced a year after Lam's death that he would be making a film based on it; he went to Los Angeles himself and stayed for a few days at the Cecil doing research. Chinese media have reported that popular actress Gao Yuanyuan may be interested in playing Lam. Liu said if he made the film, it would likely be an American-Australian coproduction in English.\n\nIn March 2014, a little over a year after Lam's death, brothers Brandon and Philip Murphy sold a horror script, \"The Bringing\", that uses the investigation into it as a backstory for a fictional investigating detective's slowly unraveling sanity. They were widely criticized for doing this so soon after the death. Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn was originally slated to direct the film, but in August it was announced that Jeremy Lovering would direct the film for Sony Pictures whenever production began .\n\nThe 2014 video for Vancouver pop duo The Zolas' \"Ancient Mars\" is meant to be an idealized representation of Lam's last day, showing a young woman exploring Los Angeles and taking in simple pleasures. \"It bugged me how tidily people explained away her disappearance with drugs or mental illness,\" said singer Zach Gray, who attended UBC around the same time and had a friend who knew Lam. \"Though it's mostly fiction we wanted people to see it and feel like she was a real girl and a familiar girl and not just a police report.\" Later that year, the American post-hardcore band Hail the Sun wrote \"Disappearing Syndrome\", also inspired by Lam's story. \"It's such a chilling and eerie case,\" said the band's guitarist, Aric Garcia, in a Reddit Ask Me Anything.\n\nIn 2015, the media speculated that the of \"American Horror Story\" was inspired by Lam's death. In late spring creator Ryan Murphy said the next season would be set in a hotel in present-day Los Angeles. He was inspired, he added, by a surveillance video of a young woman who \"got into an elevator at a downtown hotel ... [and] was never seen again.\" He did not use her name but it was believed he was talking about Lam. In 2017, Sun Kil Moon released the songs \"Window Sash Weights\" and \"Stranger Than Paradise\" as part of their album \"Common as Light and Love Are Red Valleys of Blood\" (2017); the songs specifically reference the event and promote the idea that it was a hoax. Band member Mark Kozelek said in an interview \"I've come to the conclusion that nobody died in the water tank. There’s no way to identify the girl on the elevator, as her face is pixelated.\"\n\n\n"}

{"id": "4903304", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4903304", "title": "Eccky", "text": "Eccky\n\nEccky is an online game. Until 2009, it was an MSN-based life simulation game in which two people work together to create and raise a virtual baby. \"Eccky\" won the 2005 SpinAwards for Innovation and for Best Interactive Concept. In 2009, the game play changed to a real-time virtual world on Hyves.\n\n\"Eccky\" was created in August 2005 by Dutch developer Media Republic in association with MSN in the Netherlands. \"Eccky\" has characteristics of life simulation and virtual pet games. The gameplay of the first version of \"Eccky\" involved a virtual baby, or Eccky, which was born on the basis of information derived from both \"Eccky\" user players. \"Eccky\" used an AIML chatbot and MSN Messenger for chat between users and the Eccky baby. In 2006, \"Eccky\" became an independent company as a subsidiary of Media Republic.\n\nFrom its live introduction to the public until August 2006, \"Eccky\" required an initial fee which could be paid by either user player. However \"Eccky\" has been free to play since September 2006.\n\nIn the first version of \"Eccky\", two users create a virtual baby, and raise him/her with the goal of making the child as happy and satisfied as possible. A user fills out a questionnaire with information regarding their personal characteristics, child-rearing attitudes, favorites, etc. Once registration and the \"DNA\" test have been completed, a user may invite another person to make an Eccky. Upon accepting the invitation, the second user also registers on the Eccky website, and completes his/her own \"DNA\" test. Both players then choose both a masculine and feminine name for their future Eccky. Thereafter Eccky is born, with characteristics determined by the combination of both users' DNA profiles. Eccky's sex is randomly determined, as is Eccky’s name (which is chosen randomly between the four possible names chosen by the user parents).\n\nOver a six-day period from Eccky’s birth, Eccky grows and ages three years for every one day of gameplay. Thus, in six days, Eccky develops from a cooing baby into an eighteen-year-old young adult with its own character. Every Eccky is unique at birth, and the way in which the users raise their Eccky further individualizes Eccky’s demeanor and characteristics. On the sixth day, or upon turning 18, Eccky leaves the house to venture off into the wide world, and the game ends.\n\n\"Eccky\" played principally via the Eccky website and MSN Messenger, though also via mobile phone. Upon Eccky’s birth, Eccky is automatically added as a contact to the MSN contact lists of both players. This allows users to talk to their virtual child. Running on an AIML chat engine, Eccky is able to speak from the moment following birth, both in response to users addressing Eccky and by initiating conversations him/herself. Eccky initiates conversation either randomly or to express any particularly pressing need he/she may have (i.e. being extremely hungry, having to go to the bathroom, being very sick, feeling neglected, etc.) Eccky’s vocabulary is initially limited to newborn babble. Then, as with a real child, Eccky’s command of vocabulary grows with each day of gameplay, to a final capability of being able to respond with over 60,000 unique answers on more than 4,000 diverse subjects. Since June 2007, Eccky also features an in-game chat functionality.\n\nEccky and users can also exchange text messages via mobile phone. Exchange of text messages requires that the user have a mobile phone, and that the user purchase a mobile phone for Eccky within the game environment. This feature involves extra costs to the user, specifically the cost of sending text messages, and can be turned on and off at the user's discretion.\n\nMost games are intended to be played with users playing against their Eccky and vice versa. Others are played in cooperation with Eccky. Of note are the racing games, some of which allow users to create their own tracks and race on them with Eccky. Though most games are free to play, some games require additional credits to play.\n\nEccky’s physical and emotional states are subject to continual change, determined by 180 dynamic variables, and are influenced by the interaction with and treatment by users, both via the virtual world and via the chat. The levels of these physical and emotional states are continually assessed and are made visible to users via meters that gauge happiness, hunger, toilet needs, popularity, who Eccky’s favorite parent is, etc. For example, if Eccky is not sufficiently fed, users will see this in Eccky’s hunger meter. In worst-case scenarios, an Eccky can be neglected, physical and emotionally, to the point of needing to be sent to the hospital. During this time, gameplay continues and users may chat with Eccky, but may not interact with Eccky in the virtual world. Further, Eccky’s physical and emotional states are reflected in the chat element, as Eccky will either comment, unsolicited, on how he/she is doing physically and emotionally, or respond to a user in such a way as to make his/her physical and emotional state known.\n\nIt is also possible to send Eccky away for a period, either to live in other accommodations such as in a hotel, on vacation, or to stay with a babysitter. A babysitter may be anyone with an MSN Messenger account. Sending Eccky to a hotel or on vacation does involve additional costs (sending Eccky to a babysitter does not), and as with Eccky staying in the hospital, users may continue to speak with Eccky via chat but cannot interact with Eccky in the virtual world setting during this time. A user can retrieve their Eccky at any time during a stay away from home. Eccky was closed down in 2007 and until it was launched in a new format in 2009.\n\nIn 2009 Dutch/Chinese developer TribePlay created a new version of \"Eccky\" and launched it in Hyves as one of the first social networking virtual worlds. In \"Eccky\" players can make a character (an Eccky) with their social network profile. After that they enter the Eccky world. In this world they have access to various locations, such as a city center, park, mountain top and beach. Players can also visit their own or other users' houses. In any of these virtual locations players can chat, play mini games and do a variety of other things.\n\n\"Eccky\" is integrated into Hyves and Facebook. Together with their Hyves or Facebook friends players can chat, play mini games and post their Eccky's activities on their social networking profile. \"Eccky\" has many games. Games can be played in single-player or multi-player format. Ecckies can also play with their Wobble. A Wobble is Eccky’s own pet. Wobbles were the first inhabitants of the Eccky world. Wobbles live together with Ecckies and need to be taken care of. Once Ecckies advance in levels they receive superpowers to be used in the game.\n\n"}
{"id": "7934681", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7934681", "title": "Galápagos tortoise", "text": "Galápagos tortoise\n\nThe Galápagos tortoise complex or Galápagos giant tortoise complex (\"Chelonoidis nigra\" and related species) are the largest living species of tortoise. Modern Galápagos tortoises can weigh up to . Today, giant tortoises exist only on two remote archipelagos: the Galápagos Islands 1000 km due west of mainland Ecuador, and Aldabra in the Indian Ocean, 700 km east of Tanzania.\n\nThe Galápagos tortoises are native to seven of the Galápagos Islands, a volcanic archipelago about west of the Ecuadorian mainland. With lifespans in the wild of over 100 years, it is one of the longest-lived vertebrates. A captive individual lived at least 170 years. Spanish explorers, who discovered the islands in the 16th century, named them after the Spanish \"galápago\", meaning \"tortoise\".\n\nShell size and shape vary between populations. On islands with humid highlands, the tortoises are larger, with domed shells and short necks; on islands with dry lowlands, the tortoises are smaller, with \"saddleback\" shells and long necks. Charles Darwin's observations of these differences on the second voyage of the \"Beagle\" in 1835, contributed to the development of his theory of evolution.\n\nTortoise numbers declined from over 250,000 in the 16th century to a low of around 3,000 in the 1970s. This decline was caused by overexploitation of the species for meat and oil, habitat clearance for agriculture, and introduction of non-native animals to the islands, such as rats, goats, and pigs. The extinction of most giant tortoise lineages is thought to have also been caused by predation by humans or human ancestors, as the tortoises themselves have no natural predators. Tortoise populations on at least three islands have become extinct in historical times due to human activities. Specimens of these extinct taxa exist in several museums and also are being subjected to DNA analysis. Ten species of the original 15 survive in the wild; an 11th species (\"Chelonoidis abingdonii\") had only a single known living individual, kept in captivity and nicknamed Lonesome George until his death in June 2012. Conservation efforts, beginning in the 20th century, have resulted in thousands of captive-bred juveniles being released onto their ancestral home islands, and the total number of the species is estimated to have exceeded 19,000 at the start of the 21st century. Despite this rebound, the species as a whole is classified as \"vulnerable\" by the International Union for Conservation of Nature.\n\nThe Galápagos Islands were discovered in 1535, but first appeared on the maps, of Gerardus Mercator and Abraham Ortelius, around 1570. The islands were named \"Insulae de los Galopegos\" (Islands of the Tortoises) in reference to the giant tortoises found there.\n\nInitially, the giant tortoises of the Indian Ocean and those from the Galápagos were considered to be the same species. Naturalists thought that sailors had transported the tortoises there. In 1676, the pre-Linnaean authority Claude Perrault referred to both species as \"Tortue des Indes\". In 1783, Johann Gottlob Schneider classified all giant tortoises as \"Testudo indica\" (\"Indian tortoise\"). In 1812, August Friedrich Schweigger named them \"Testudo gigantea\" (\"gigantic tortoise\"). In 1834, André Marie Constant Duméril and Gabriel Bibron classified the Galápagos tortoises as a separate species, which they named \"Testudo nigrita\" (\"black tortoise\").\n\nThe first systematic survey of giant tortoises was by the zoologist Albert Günther of the British Museum, in 1875. Günther identified at least five distinct populations from the Galápagos, and three from the Indian Ocean islands. He expanded the list in 1877 to six from the Galápagos, four from the Seychelles, and four from the Mascarenes. Günther hypothesized that all the giant tortoises descended from a single ancestral population which spread by sunken land bridges. This hypothesis was later disproven by the understanding that the Galápagos, Seychelles, and Mascarene islands are all of recent volcanic origin and have never been linked to a continent by land bridges. Galápagos tortoises are now thought to have descended from a South American ancestor, while the Indian Ocean tortoises derived from ancestral populations on Madagascar.\n\nAt the end of the 19th century, Georg Baur and Walter Rothschild recognised five more populations of Galápagos tortoise. In 1905–06, an expedition by the California Academy of Sciences, with Joseph R. Slevin in charge of reptiles, collected specimens which were studied by Academy herpetologist John Van Denburgh. He identified four additional populations, and proposed the existence of 15 species. Van Denburgh's list still guides the taxonomy of the Galápagos tortoise, though now 10 populations are thought to have existed.\n\nThe current specific designation of \"nigra\" (\"black\" – Quoy & Gaimard, 1824b) was resurrected in 1984 after it was discovered to be the senior synonym (an older taxonomic synonym taking historical precedence) for the then commonly used species name of \"elephantopus\" (\"elephant-footed\" – Harlan, 1827). Quoy and Gaimard's Latin description explains the use of \"nigra: \"Testudo toto corpore nigro\"\" means \"tortoise with completely black body\". Quoy and Gairmard described \"nigra\" from a living specimen, but no evidence indicates they knew of its accurate provenance within the Galápagos – the locality was in fact given as California. Garman proposed the linking of \"nigra\" with the extinct Floreana species. Later, Pritchard deemed it convenient to accept this designation, despite its tenuousness, for minimal disruption to the already confused nomenclature of the species. The even more senior species synonym of \"californiana\" (\"californian\" – Quoy & Gaimard, 1824a) is considered a \"nomen oblitum\" (\"forgotten name\").\n\nPreviously, the Galápagos tortoise was considered to belong to the genus \"Geochelone\", known as 'typical tortoises' or 'terrestrial turtles'. In the 1990s, subgenus \"Chelonoidis\" was elevated to generic status based on phylogenetic evidence which grouped the South American members of \"Geochelone\" into an independent clade (branch of the tree of life). This nomenclature has been adopted by several authorities.\n\nWithin the archipelago, up to 15 species of Galápagos tortoises have been identified, although only 11 survive to this day. Six are found on separate islands; five of them on the volcanoes of Isabela Island. Several of the surviving species are seriously endangered. One of the species, \"C. abingdonii\" from Pinta Island, is considered extinct. The last known specimen, named Lonesome George, died in captivity on 24 June 2012; George had been mated with female tortoises of several other species, but none of the eggs from these pairings hatched. The species inhabiting Floreana Island (\"G. nigra\") is thought to have been hunted to extinction by 1850, only 15 years after Charles Darwin's landmark visit of 1835, when he saw shells, but no live tortoises there. The existence of the \"C. phantastica\" species of Fernandina Island is disputed, as it was described from a single specimen that may have been an artificial introduction to the island. However, recent DNA testing shows that an intermixed, non-native population currently existing on the island of Isabela is of genetic resemblance to the species native to Floreana, suggesting that \"G. nigra\" has not gone entirely extinct.\n\nPrior to widespread knowledge of the differences between the populations (sometimes called races) from different islands and volcanoes, captive collections in zoos were indiscriminately mixed. Fertile offspring resulted from pairings of animals from different races. However, captive crosses between tortoises from different races have lower fertility and higher mortality than those between tortoises of the same race, and captives in mixed herds normally direct courtship only toward members of the same race.\n\nThe valid scientific names of each of the individual populations are not universally accepted, and some researchers still consider each species to be a subspecies. The taxonomic status of the various races is not fully resolved.\n\"C. n. nigra\" (nominate subspecies)\n\"C. n. abingdoni\"\n\"C. n. becki\"\n\"C. n. chathamensis\"\n\"C. n. darwini\"\n\"C. n. duncanensis\"\n\"C. n. hoodensis\"\n\"C. n. phantastica\"\n\"C. n. porteri\"\n\"C. n. vicina\"\nChelonoidis nigra darwini \n| synonyms_ref=\nAll species of Galápagos tortoises evolved from common ancestors that arrived from mainland South America by overwater dispersal. Genetic studies have shown that the Chaco tortoise of Argentina and Paraguay is their closest living relative. The minimal founding population was a pregnant female or a breeding pair. Survival on the 1000-km oceanic journey is accounted for because the tortoises are buoyant, can breathe by extending their necks above the water, and are able to survive months without food or fresh water. As they are poor swimmers, the journey was probably a passive one facilitated by the Humboldt Current, which diverts westwards towards the Galápagos Islands from the mainland. The ancestors of the genus \"Chelonoidis\" are believed to have similarly dispersed from Africa to South America during the Oligocene.\n\nThe closest living relative (though not a direct ancestor) of the Galápagos giant tortoise is the Chaco tortoise (\"Chelonoidis chilensis\"), a much smaller species from South America. The divergence between \"C. chilensis\" and \"C. nigra\" probably occurred 6–12 million years ago, an evolutionary event preceding the volcanic formation of the oldest modern Galápagos Islands 5 million years ago. Mitochondrial DNA analysis indicates that the oldest existing islands (Española and San Cristóbal) were colonised first, and that these populations seeded the younger islands via dispersal in a \"stepping stone\" fashion via local currents. Restricted gene flow between isolated islands then resulted in the independent evolution of the populations into the divergent forms observed in the modern species. The evolutionary relationships between the species thus echo the volcanic history of the islands.\n\nModern DNA methods have revealed new information on the relationships between the species:\n\nThe five populations living on the largest island, Isabela, are the ones that are the subject of the most debate as to whether they are true species or just distinct populations or subspecies. It is widely accepted that the population living on the northernmost volcano, Volcan Wolf, is genetically independent from the four populations to the south and is therefore a separate species. It is thought to be derived from a different colonization event than the others. A colonization from the island of Santiago apparently gave rise to the Volcan Wolf species (\"C. becki\") while the four southern populations are believed to be descended from a second colonization from the more southerly island of Santa Cruz. Tortoises from Santa Cruz are thought to have first colonized the Sierra Negra volcano, which was the first of the island's volcanoes to form. The tortoises then spread north to each newly created volcano, resulting in the populations living on Volcan Alcedo and then Volcan Darwin. Recent genetic evidence shows that these two populations are genetically distinct from each other and from the population living on Sierra Negra (\"C. guentheri\") and therefore form the species \"C. vandenburghi\" (Alcedo) and \"C. microphyes\" (Darwin). The fifth population living on the southernmost volcano (\"C. vicina\") is thought to have split off from the Sierra Negra population more recently and is therefore not as genetically different as the other two. Isabela is the most recently formed island tortoises inhabit, so its populations have had less time to evolve independently than populations on other islands, but according to some researchers, they are all genetically different and should each be considered as separate species.\n\nPhylogenetic analysis may help to \"resurrect\" the extinct species of Floreana (\"C. nigra\") – a species known only from subfossil remains. Some tortoises from Isabela were found to be a partial match for the genetic profile of Floreana specimens from museum collections, possibly indicating the presence of hybrids from a population transported by humans from Floreana to Isabela, resulting either from individuals deliberately transported between the islands, or from individuals thrown overboard from ships to lighten the load. Nine Floreana descendants have been identified in the captive population of the Fausto Llerena Breeding Center on Santa Cruz; the genetic footprint was identified in the genomes of hybrid offspring. This allows the possibility of re-establishing a reconstructed species from selective breeding of the hybrid animals. Furthermore, individuals from the species possibly are still extant. Genetic analysis from a sample of tortoises from Volcan Wolf found 84 first-generation \"C. nigra\" hybrids, some less than 15 years old. The genetic diversity of these individuals is estimated to have required 38 \"C. nigra\" parents, many of which could still be alive on Isabela Island.\n\nThe Pinta Island species (\"C. abingdonii\", now extinct) has been found to be most closely related to the species on the islands of San Cristóbal (\"C. chathamensis\") and Española (\"C. hoodensis\") which lie over 300 km (190 mi) away, rather than that on the neighbouring island of Isabela as previously assumed. This relationship is attributable to dispersal by the strong local current from San Cristóbal towards Pinta. This discovery informed further attempts to preserve the \"C. abingdonii\" lineage and the search for an appropriate mate for Lonesome George, which had been penned with females from Isabela. Hope was bolstered by the discovery of a \"C. abingdonii\" hybrid male in the Volcán Wolf population on northern Isabela, raising the possibility that more undiscovered living Pinta descendants exist.\n\nMitochondrial DNA studies of tortoises on Santa Cruz show up to three genetically distinct lineages found in nonoverlapping population distributions around the regions of Cerro Montura, Cerro Fatal, and La Caseta. Although traditionally grouped into a single species (\"C. porteri\"), the lineages are all more closely related to tortoises on other islands than to each other: Cerro Montura tortoises are most closely related to \"G. duncanensis\" from Pinzón, Cerro Fatal to \"G. chathamensis\" from San Cristóbal, and La Caseta to the four southern races of Isabela as well as Floreana tortoises.\n\nIn 2015, the Cerro Fatal tortoises were described as a distinct taxon, \"donfaustoi\". Prior to the identification of this species through genetic analysis, it was noted that there existed differences in shells between the Cerro Fatal tortoises and other tortoises on Santa Cruz. By classifying the Cerro Fatal tortoises into a new taxon, greater attention can be paid to protecting its habitat, according to Adalgisa Caccone, who is a member of the team making this classification.\n\nWhen it was discovered that the central, small island of Pinzón had only 100–200 very old adults and no young tortoises had survived into adulthood for perhaps more than 70 years, the resident scientists initiated what would eventually become the Giant Tortoise Breeding and Rearing Program. Over the next 50 years, this program resulted in major successes in the recovery of giant tortoise populations throughout the archipelago.\n\nIn 1965, the first tortoise eggs collected from natural nests on Pinzón Island were brought to the Charles Darwin Research Station, where they would complete the period of incubation and then hatch, becoming the first young tortoises to be reared in captivity. The introduction of black rats onto Pinzón sometime in the latter half of the 19th century had resulted in the complete eradication of all young tortoises. Black rats had been eating both tortoise eggs and hatchlings, effectively destroying the future of the tortoise population. Only the longevity of giant tortoises allowed them to survive until The Galápagos National Park, Island Conservation, Charles Darwin Foundation, The Raptor Center, and Bell Laboratories removed invasive rats in 2012. In 2013, heralding an important step in Pinzón tortoise recovery, hatchlings emerged from native Pinzón tortoise nests on the island and the Galápagos National Park successfully returned 118 hatchlings to their native island home. Partners returned to Pinzón Island in late 2014 and continued to observe hatchling tortoises (now older), indicating that natural recruitment is occurring on the island unimpeded. They also discovered a snail species new to science. These exciting results highlight the conservation value of this important management action. In early 2015, after extensive monitoring, partners confirmed that Pinzón and Plaza Sur Islands are now both rodent-free.\n\nOn the southern island of Española, only 14 adult tortoises were found, two males and 12 females. The tortoises apparently were not encountering one another, so no reproduction was occurring. Between 1963 and 1974, all 14 adult tortoises discovered on the island were brought to the tortoise center on Santa Cruz and a tortoise breeding program was initiated. In 1977, a third Española male tortoise was returned to Galapagos from the San Diego Zoo and joined the breeding group. After 40 years' work reintroducing captive animals, a detailed study of the island's ecosystem has confirmed it has a stable, breeding population. Where once 15 were known, now more than 1,000 giant tortoises inhabit the island of Española. One research team has found that more than half the tortoises released since the first reintroductions are still alive, and they are breeding well enough for the population to progress onward, unaided.\n\nSpecies were described from three other islands, but their existence is based on scant evidence. The purported Rábida Island species (\"C. wallacei\") was described from a single specimen collected by the California Academy of Sciences in December 1905, which has since been lost. This individual was probably an artificial introduction from another island that was originally penned on Rábida next to a good anchorage, as no contemporary whaling or sealing logs mention removing tortoises from this island. The \"C. phantastica\" species from Fernandina is known from a single specimen — an old male from the voyage of 1905–06. No other tortoises or remains have been found on the island, suggesting the specimen was an artificial introduction from elsewhere. Fernandina has neither human settlements nor feral mammals, so if this species ever did exist, its extinction must have been by natural means, such as volcanic activity. The Santa Fe species has no binomial name, having been described from the limited evidence of bone fragments (but no shells, the most durable part) of 14 individuals, old eggs, and old dung found on the island in 1905–06. The island has never been inhabited by man nor had any introduced predators. The remains are considered artificial introductions, possibly from camping at the good anchorage on the island.\n\nThe tortoises have a large bony shell of a dull brown or gray colour. The plates of the shell are fused with the ribs in a rigid protective structure that is integral to the skeleton. Lichens can grow on the shells of these slow-moving animals. Tortoises keep a characteristic scute (shell segment) pattern on their shells throughout life, though the annual growth bands are not useful for determining age because the outer layers are worn off with time. A tortoise can withdraw its head, neck, and fore limbs into its shell for protection. The legs are large and stumpy, with dry, scaly skin and hard scales. The front legs have five claws, the back legs four.\n\nThe discoverer of the Galápagos Islands, Fray Tomás de Berlanga, Bishop of Panama, wrote in 1535 of \"such big tortoises that each could carry a man on top of himself.\" Naturalist Charles Darwin remarked after his trip three centuries later in 1835, \"These animals grow to an immense size ... several so large that it required six or eight men to lift them from the ground\". The largest recorded individuals have reached weights of over and lengths of . Size overlap is extensive with the Aldabra giant tortoise, however taken as a species, the Galápagos tortoise seems to average slightly larger, with weights in excess of being slightly more commonplace. Weights in the larger bodied species range from in mature males and from in adult females. However, the size is variable across the islands and species; those from Pinzón Island are relatively small with a maximum known weight of and carapace length of approximately compared to range in tortoises from Santa Cruz Island. The tortoises' gigantism was probably a trait useful on continents that was fortuitously helpful for successful colonisation of these remote oceanic islands rather than an example of evolved insular gigantism. Large tortoises would have a greater chance of surviving the journey over water from the mainland as they can hold their heads a greater height above the water level and have a smaller surface area/volume ratio, which reduces osmotic water loss. Their significant water and fat reserves would allow the tortoises to survive long ocean crossings without food or fresh water, and to endure the drought-prone climate of the islands. A larger size allowed them to better tolerate extremes of temperature due to gigantothermy. Fossil giant tortoises from mainland South America have been described that support this hypothesis of gigantism that pre-existed the colonization of islands.\n\nGalápagos tortoises possess two main shell forms that correlate with the biogeographic history of the species group. They exhibit a spectrum of carapace morphology ranging from \"saddleback\" (denoting upward arching of the front edge of the shell resembling a saddle) to \"domed\" (denoting a rounded convex surface resembling a dome). When a saddleback tortoise withdraws its head and forelimbs into its shell, a large unprotected gap remains over the neck, evidence of the lack of predation during the evolution of this structure. Larger islands with humid highlands over in elevation, such as Santa Cruz, have abundant vegetation near the ground. Tortoises native to these environments tend to have domed shells and are larger, with shorter necks and limbs. Saddleback tortoises originate from small islands less than in elevation with dry habitats (e.g. Española and Pinzón) that are more limited in food and other resources. Two lineages of Galápagos tortoises possess the Island of Santa Cruz and when observed it is concluded that despite the shared similarities of growth patterns and morphological changes observed during growth, the two lineages and two sexes can be distinguished on the basis of distinct carapace features. Lineages differ by the shape of the vertebral and pleural scutes. Females have a more elongated and wider carapace shape than males. Carapace shape changes with growth, with vertebral scutes becoming narrower and pleural scutes becoming larger during late ontogeny.\n\nIn combination with proportionally longer necks and limbs, the unusual saddleback carapace structure is thought to be an adaptation to increase vertical reach, which enables the tortoise to browse tall vegetation such as the \"Opuntia\" (prickly pear) cactus that grows in arid environments. Saddlebacks are more territorial and smaller than domed varieties, possibly adaptations to limited resources. Alternatively, larger tortoises may be better-suited to high elevations because they can resist the cooler temperatures that occur with cloud cover or fog.\n\nA competing hypothesis is that, rather than being principally a feeding adaptation, the distinctive saddle shape and longer extremities might have been a secondary sexual characteristic of saddleback males. Male competition over mates is settled by dominance displays on the basis of vertical neck height rather than body size (see below). This correlates with the observation that saddleback males are more aggressive than domed males. The shell distortion and elongation of the limbs and neck in saddlebacks is probably an evolutionary compromise between the need for a small body size in dry conditions and a high vertical reach for dominance displays.\n\nThe saddleback carapace probably evolved independently several times in dry habitats, since genetic similarity between populations does not correspond to carapace shape. Saddleback tortoises are, therefore, not necessarily more closely related to each other than to their domed counterparts, as shape is not determined by a similar genetic background, but by a similar ecological one.\n\n\nSexual dimorphism is most pronounced in saddleback populations in which males have more angled and higher front openings, giving a more extreme saddled appearance. Males of all varieties generally have longer tails and shorter, concave plastrons with thickened knobs at the back edge to facilitate mating. Males are larger than females — adult males weigh around while females are .\n\nThe tortoises are ectothermic (cold-blooded), so bask for 1–2 hours after dawn to absorb the sun's heat through their dark shells before actively foraging for 8–9 hours a day. They travel mostly in the early morning or late afternoon between resting and grazing areas. They have been observed to walk at a speed of .\n\nOn the larger and more humid islands, the tortoises seasonally migrate between low elevations, which become grassy plains in the wet season, and meadowed areas of higher elevation (up to ) in the dry season. The same routes have been used for many generations, creating well-defined paths through the undergrowth known as \"tortoise highways\". On these wetter islands, the domed tortoises are gregarious and often found in large herds, in contrast to the more solitary and territorial disposition of the saddleback tortoises.\n\nTortoises sometimes rest in mud wallows or rain-formed pools, which may be both a thermoregulatory response during cool nights, and a protection from parasites such as mosquitoes and ticks. Parasites are countered by taking dust baths in loose soil. Some tortoises have been noted to shelter at night under overhanging rocks.  - others have been observed sleeping in a snug depression in the earth or brush called a \"pallet\". Local tortoises using the same pallet sites, such as on Volcán Alcedo, results in the formation of small, sandy pits.\n\nThe tortoises are herbivores that consume a diet of cacti, grasses, leaves, lichens, berries, melons, oranges, and milkweed. They have been documented feeding on \"Hippomane mancinella\" ('poison apple'), the endemic guava \"Psidium galapageium\", the water fern \"Azolla microphylla\", and the bromeliad \"Tillandsia insularis\". Juvenile tortoises eat an average of 16.7% of their own body weight in dry matter per day, with a digestive efficiency roughly equal to that of hindgut-fermenting herbivorous mammals such as horses and rhinos.\n\nTortoises acquire most of their moisture from the dew and sap in vegetation (particularly the \"Opuntia\" cactus); therefore, they can survive longer than 6 months without water. They can endure up to a year when deprived of all food and water, surviving by breaking down their body fat to produce water as a byproduct. Tortoises also have very slow metabolisms. When thirsty, they may drink large quantities of water very quickly, storing it in their bladders and the \"root of the neck\" (the pericardium), both of which served to make them useful water sources on ships. On arid islands, tortoises lick morning dew from boulders, and the repeated action over many generations has formed half-sphere depressions in the rock.\n\nRegarding their senses, Charles Darwin observed, \"The inhabitants believe that these animals are absolutely deaf; certainly they do not overhear a person walking near behind them. I was always amused, when overtaking one of these great monsters as it was quietly pacing along, to see how suddenly, the instant I passed, it would draw in its head and legs, and uttering a deep hiss fall to the ground with a heavy sound, as if struck dead.\" Although they are not deaf, tortoises depend far more on vision and smell as stimuli than hearing.\n\nTortoises share a mutualistic relationship with some species of Galápagos finch and mockingbirds. Small groups of finches initiate the process by hopping on the ground in an exaggerated fashion facing the tortoise. The tortoise signals it is ready by rising up and extending its neck and legs, enabling the birds to reach otherwise inaccessible spots on the tortoise's body such as the neck, rear legs, cloacal opening, and skin between plastron and carapace. The birds benefit from the food source and the tortoises get rid of irritating ectoparasites.\n\nSome tortoises have been observed to insidiously exploit this mutualistic relationship. After rising and extending its limbs, the bird may go beneath the tortoise to investigate, whereupon suddenly the tortoise withdraws its limbs to drop flat and kill the bird. It then steps back to eat the bird, presumably to supplement its diet with protein.\n\nMating occurs at any time of the year, although it does have seasonal peaks between February and June in the humid uplands during the rainy season. When mature males meet in the mating season, they face each other in a ritualised dominance display, rise up on their legs, and stretch up their necks with their mouths gaping open. Occasionally, head-biting occurs, but usually the shorter tortoise backs off, conceding mating rights to the victor. The behaviour is most pronounced in saddleback species, which are more aggressive and have longer necks.\n\nThe prelude to mating can be very aggressive, as the male forcefully rams the female's shell with his own and nips her legs. Mounting is an awkward process and the male must stretch and tense to maintain equilibrium in a slanting position. The concave underside of the male's shell helps him to balance when straddled over the female's shell, and brings his cloacal vent (which houses the penis) closer to the female's dilated cloaca. During mating, the male vocalises with hoarse bellows and grunts, described as \"rhythmic groans\". This is one of the few vocalisations the tortoise makes; other noises are made during aggressive encounters, when struggling to right themselves, and hissing as they withdraw into their shells due to the forceful expulsion of air.\n\nFemales journey up to several kilometres in July to November to reach nesting areas of dry, sandy coast. Nest digging is a tiring and elaborate task which may take the female several hours a day over many days to complete. It is carried out blindly using only the hind legs to dig a -deep cylindrical hole, in which the tortoise then lays up to 16 spherical, hard-shelled eggs ranging from in mass, and the size of a billiard ball. Some observations suggest that the average clutch size for domed populations (9.6 per clutch for \"C. porteri\" on Santa Cruz) is larger than that of saddlebacks (4.6 per clutch for \"C. duncanensis\" on Pinzón). The female makes a muddy plug for the nest hole out of soil mixed with urine, seals the nest by pressing down firmly with her plastron, and leaves them to be incubated by the sun. Females may lay one to four clutches per season. Temperature plays a role in the sex of the hatchlings, with lower-temperature nests producing more males and higher-temperature nests producing more females. This is related closely to incubation time, since clutches laid early incubate during the cool season and have longer incubation periods (producing more males), while eggs laid later incubate for a shorter period in the hot season (producing more females).\n\nYoung animals emerge from the nest after four to eight months and may weigh only and measure . When the young tortoises emerge from their shells, they must dig their way to the surface, which can take several weeks, though their yolk sac can sustain them up to seven months. In particularly dry conditions, the hatchlings may die underground if they are encased by hardened soil, while flooding of the nest area can drown them. Species are initially indistinguishable as they all have domed carapaces. The young stay in warmer lowland areas for their first 10–15 years, encountering hazards such as falling into cracks, being crushed by falling rocks, or excessive heat stress. The Galápagos hawk was formerly the sole native predator of the tortoise hatchlings; Darwin wrote: \"The young tortoises, as soon as they are hatched, fall prey in great numbers to the buzzard\". The hawk is now much rarer, but introduced feral pigs, dogs, cats, and black rats have become predators of eggs and young tortoises. The adult tortoises have no natural predators apart from humans; Darwin noted: \"The old ones seem generally to die from accidents, as from falling down precipices. At least several of the inhabitants told me, they had never found one dead without some such apparent cause\".\n\nSexual maturity is reached at around 20–25 years in captivity, possibly 40 years in the wild. Life expectancy in the wild is thought to be over 100 years, making it one of the longest-lived species in the animal kingdom. Harriet, a specimen kept in Australia Zoo, was the oldest known Galápagos tortoise, having reached an estimated age of more than 170 years before her death in 2006. Chambers notes that Harriet was probably 169 years old in 2004, although media outlets claimed the greater age of 175 at death based on a less reliable timeline.\n\nCharles Darwin visited the Galápagos for five weeks on the second voyage of HMS \"Beagle\" in 1835 and saw Galápagos tortoises on San Cristobal (Chatham) and Santiago (James) Islands. They appeared several times in his writings and journals, and played a role in the development of the theory of evolution.\n\nDarwin wrote in his account of the voyage:\n\"I have not as yet noticed by far the most remarkable feature in the natural history of this archipelago; it is, that the different islands to a considerable extent are inhabited by a different set of beings. My attention was first called to this fact by the Vice-Governor, Mr. Lawson, declaring that the tortoises differed from the different islands, and that he could with certainty tell from which island any one was brought ... The inhabitants, as I have said, state that they can distinguish the tortoises from the different islands; and that they differ not only in size, but in other characters. Captain Porter has described* those from Charles and from the nearest island to it, namely, Hood Island, as having their shells in front thick and turned up like a Spanish saddle, while the tortoises from James Island are rounder, blacker, and have a better taste when cooked.\" \n\nThe significance of the differences in tortoises between islands did not strike him as important until it was too late, as he continued,\n\"I did not for some time pay sufficient attention to this statement, and I had already partially mingled together the collections from two of the islands. I never dreamed that islands, about fifty or sixty miles apart, and most of them in sight of each other, formed of precisely the same rocks, placed under a quite similar climate, rising to a nearly equal height, would have been differently tenanted\".\n\nThough the \"Beagle\" departed from the Galápagos with over 30 adult tortoises on deck, these were not for scientific study, but a source of fresh meat for the Pacific crossing. Their shells and bones were thrown overboard, leaving no remains with which to test any hypotheses. It has been suggested that this oversight was made because Darwin only reported seeing tortoises on San Cristóbal (\"C. chathamensis\") and Santiago (\"C. darwini\"), both of which have an intermediate type of shell shape and are not particularly morphologically distinct from each other. Though he did visit Floreana, the \"C. nigra\" species found there was already nearly extinct and he was unlikely to have seen any mature animals.\nHowever, Darwin did have four live juvenile specimens to compare from different islands. These were pet tortoises taken by himself (from San Salvador), his captain FitzRoy (two from Española) and his servant Syms Covington (from Floreana). Unfortunately, they could not help to determine whether each island had its own variety because the specimens were not mature enough to exhibit morphological differences. Although the British Museum had a few specimens, their provenance within the Galápagos was unknown. However, conversations with the naturalist Gabriel Bibron, who had seen the mature tortoises of the Paris Natural History Museum confirmed to Darwin that distinct varieties occurred.\n\nDarwin later compared the different tortoise forms with those of mockingbirds, in the first tentative statement linking his observations from the Galapagos with the possibility of species transmuting:\n\"When I recollect the fact that [from] the form of the body, shape of scales and general size, the Spaniards can at once pronounce from which island any tortoise may have been brought; when I see these islands in sight of each other and possessed of but a scanty stock of animals, tenanted by these birds, but slightly differing in structure and filling the same place in nature; I must suspect they are only varieties ... If there is the slightest foundation for these remarks, the zoology of archipelagos will be well worth examining; for such facts would undermine the stability of species.\"\n\nHis views on the mutability of species were restated in his notebooks: \"animals on separate islands ought to become different if kept long enough apart with slightly differing circumstances. – Now Galapagos Tortoises, Mocking birds, Falkland Fox, Chiloe fox, – Inglish and Irish Hare.\" These observations served as counterexamples to the prevailing contemporary view that species were individually created.\n\nDarwin also found these \"antediluvian animals\" to be a source of diversion: \"I frequently got on their backs, and then giving a few raps on the hinder part of their shells, they would rise up and walk away;—but I found it very difficult to keep my balance\".\n\nSeveral waves of human exploitation of the tortoises as a food source caused a decline in the total wild population from around 250,000 when first discovered in the 16th century to a low of 3,060 individuals in a 1974 census. Modern conservation efforts have subsequently brought tortoise numbers up to 19,317 (estimate for 1995–2009).\n\nThe species \"C. nigra\" became extinct by human exploitation in the 19th century. Another species, \"C. abingdonii\", became extinct on 24 June 2012 with the death in captivity of the last remaining specimen, a male named Lonesome George, the world's \"rarest living creature\". All the other surviving species are listed by the IUCN as at least \"Vulnerable\" in conservation status, if not worse.\n\nAn estimated 200,000 animals were taken before the 20th century. The relatively immobile and defenceless tortoises were collected and stored live on board ships, where they could survive for at least a year without food or water (some anecdotal reports suggest individuals surviving two years), providing valuable fresh meat, while their diluted urine and the water stored in their neck bags could be used as drinking water. The 17th-century British pirate, explorer, and naturalist William Dampier wrote, \"They are so extraordinarily large and fat, and so sweet, that no pullet eats more pleasantly,\" while Captain James Colnett of the British Navy wrote of \"the land tortoise which in whatever way it was dressed, was considered by all of us as the most delicious food we had ever tasted.\" US Navy captain David Porter declared, \"after once tasting the Galapagos tortoises, every other animal food fell off greatly in our estimation ... The meat of this animal is the easiest of digestion, and a quantity of it, exceeding that of any other food, can be eaten without experiencing the slightest of inconvenience.\" Darwin was less enthusiastic about the meat, writing \"the breast-plate roasted (as the Gauchos do \"carne con cuero\"), with the flesh on it, is very good; and the young tortoises make excellent soup; but otherwise the meat to my taste is indifferent.\"\n\nIn the 17th century, pirates started to use the Galápagos Islands as a base for resupply, restocking on food and water, and repairing vessels before attacking Spanish colonies on the South American mainland. However, the Galápagos tortoises did not struggle for survival at this point because the islands were distant from busy shipping routes and harboured few valuable natural resources. As such, they remained unclaimed by any nation, uninhabited and uncharted. In comparison, the tortoises of the islands in the Indian Ocean were already facing extinction by the late 17th century. Between the 1790s and the 1860s, whaling ships and fur sealers systematically collected tortoises in far greater numbers than the buccaneers preceding them. Some were used for food and many more were killed for high-grade \"turtle oil\" from the late 19th century onward for lucrative sale to continental Ecuador. A total of over 13,000 tortoises is recorded in the logs of whaling ships between 1831 and 1868, and an estimated 100,000 were taken before 1830. Since it was easiest to collect tortoises around coastal zones, females were most vulnerable to depletion during the nesting season. The collection by whalers came to a halt eventually through a combination of the scarcity of tortoises that they had created and the competition from crude oil as a cheaper energy source.\n\nGalápagos tortoise exploitation dramatically increased with the onset of the California Gold Rush in 1849. Tortoises and sea turtles were imported into San Francisco, Sacramento and various other Gold Rush towns throughout Alta California to feed the gold mining population. Galápagos tortoise and sea turtle bones were also recovered from the Gold Rush-era archaeological site, Thompson's Cove (CA-SFR-186H), in San Francisco, California.\n\nPopulation decline accelerated with the early settlement of the islands in the early 19th century, leading to unregulated hunting for meat, habitat clearance for agriculture, and the introduction of alien mammal species. Feral pigs, dogs, cats, and black rats have become predators of eggs and young tortoises, whilst goats, donkeys, and cattle compete for grazing and trample nest sites. The extinction of the Floreana species in the mid-19th century has been attributed to the combined pressures of hunting for the penal colony on the relatively small island, the conversion of the grazing highlands into land for farming and fruit plantations, and the introduction of feral mammals.\n\nScientific collection expeditions took 661 tortoises between 1888 and 1930, and more than 120 tortoises have been taken by poachers since 1990. Threats continue today with the rapid expansion of the tourist industry and increasing size of human settlements on the islands. The tortoises are down from 15 different types of species when Darwin first arrived down to 11.\n\nThreats\nCollection\n\nThe tortoises of the Galápagos’ island were not only hunted for the oil that they held for fuel but also once they were becoming more and more extinct people began to pay to have them in their collections, as well as being put into museums.\n\nThe remaining species of tortoise range in IUCN classification from extinct in the wild to vulnerable. Slow growth rate, late sexual maturity, and island endemism make the tortoises particularly prone to extinction without help from conservationists. The Galápagos giant tortoise has become a flagship species for conservation efforts throughout the Galápagos.\nThe Galápagos giant tortoise is now strictly protected and is listed on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora. The listing requires that trade in the taxon and its products is subject to strict regulation by ratifying states, and international trade for primarily commercial purposes is prohibited. In 1936, the Ecuadorian government listed the giant tortoise as a protected species. In 1959, it declared all uninhabited areas in the Galápagos to be a national park and established the Charles Darwin Foundation. In 1970, capturing or removing many species from the islands (including tortoises and their eggs) was banned. To halt trade in the tortoises altogether, it became illegal to export the tortoises from Ecuador, captive or wild, continental, or insular in provenance. The banning of their exportation resulted in automatic prohibition of importation to the United States under Public Law 91-135 (1969). A 1971 Ecuadorian decree made it illegal to damage, remove, alter, or disturb any organism, rock, or other natural object in the National Park.\n\n\nWith the establishment of the Galapagos National Park and the CDF in 1959, a review of the status of the tortoise populations began. Only 11 of the 14 original populations remained and most of these were endangered if not already on the brink of extinction. The breeding and rearing program for giant tortoises began in response to the condition of the population on Pinzón, where fewer than 200 old adults were found. All of the hatchlings had been killed by introduced black rats, for perhaps more than a century. Without help, this population would eventually disappear. The only thing preserving it was the longevity of the tortoise. Its genetic resistance to the negative effects of inbreeding would be another.\n\nBreeding and release programs began in 1965 and have successfully brought seven of the eight endangered species up to less perilous population levels. Young tortoises are raised at several breeding centres across the islands to improve their survival during their vulnerable early development. Eggs are collected from threatened nesting sites, and the hatched young are given a head start by being kept in captivity for four to five years to reach a size with a much better chance of survival to adulthood, before release onto their native ranges.\n\nThe most significant population recovery was that of the Española tortoise (\"C. hoodensis\"), which was saved from near-certain extinction. The population had been depleted to three males and 12 females that had been so widely dispersed that no mating in the wild had occurred. Fruitless attempts to breed one of the tortoises, Lonesome George for example, is speculated to be attributed to a lack of postnatal cues, and confusion over which would be the most appropriate genetic species would be the most appropriate to mate him with on the islands. The 15 remaining tortoises were brought to the Charles Darwin Research Station in 1971 for a captive breeding program and, in the following 33 years, they gave rise to over 1,200 progeny which were released onto their home island and have since begun to reproduce naturally. One of the tortoises, Diego, is one of the main drivers of a remarkable recovery of the \"hoodensis\" species having fathered between 350 and 800 progeny.\n\nThe Galápagos National Park Service systematically culls feral predators and competitors. Goat eradication on islands, including Pinta, was achieved by the technique of using \"Judas\" goats with radio location collars to find the herds. Marksmen then shot all the goats except the Judas, and then returned weeks later to find the \"Judas\" and shoot the herd to which it had relocated. Goats were removed from Pinta Island after a 30-year eradication campaign, the largest removal of an insular goat population using ground-based methods. Over 41,000 goats were removed during the initial hunting effort (1971–82). This process was repeated until only the \"Judas\" goat remained, which was then killed. Other measures have included dog eradication from San Cristóbal, and fencing off nests to protect them from feral pigs.\n\nEfforts are now underway to repopulate islands formerly inhabited by tortoises to restore their ecosystems (island restoration) to their condition before humans arrived. The tortoises are a keystone species, acting as ecosystem engineers which help in plant seed dispersal and trampling down brush and thinning the understory of vegetation (allowing light to penetrate and germination to occur). Birds such as flycatchers perch on and fly around tortoises to hunt the insects they displace from the brush. In May 2010, 39 sterilised tortoises of hybrid origin were introduced to Pinta Island, the first tortoises there since the evacuation of Lonesome George 38 years before. Sterile tortoises were released so the problem of interbreeding between species would be avoided if any fertile tortoises were to be released in the future. It is hoped that with the recent identification of a hybrid \"C. abingdonii\" tortoise, the approximate genetic constitution of the original inhabitants of Pinta may eventually be restored with the identification and relocation of appropriate specimens to this island. This approach may be used to \"retortoise\" Floreana in the future, since captive individuals have been found to be descended from the extinct original stock.\n\n\nThe Galapagos Tortoise Movement Ecology Programme is a collaborative project coordinated by Dr Stephen Blake of the Max Planck Institute for Ornithology. Its goal is to assist the Galapagos National Park to effectively conserve giant tortoises by conducting cutting-edge applied science, and developing an inspirational tortoise-based outreach and education programme. Since 2009, the project team have been analysing the movements of giant tortoises by tracking them via satellite tags. As of November 2014, the team have tagged 83 tortoises from four species on three islands. They have established that giant tortoises conduct migrations up and down volcanoes, primarily in response to seasonal changes in the availability and quality of vegetation. In 2015 they will start to track the movements of hatchling and juvenile tortoises, supported by the UK's Galapagos Conservation Trust.\n\n\n\n"}

He was also a member of the Cyberforce.\n\nHeatwave was a cybernetically-enhanced mutant, with the power to absorb and release ambient solar energy in the form of super-heated plasma. It was specially difficult for him when his powers first began to manifest because they led to a tragic incident when he accidentally killed his brother—something Heatwave was never able to come to terms with. His brother's death had such a devastating effect on the family that he chose to leave home and enroll in naval training school, rather than endure their accusing eyes anymore. He graduated with honors, got married, joined the Navy and eventually became one of the elite SEAL team. Tragedy struck once again shortly thereafter when his daughter was killed during a terrorist attack. His marriage soon fell apart, and his performance level dropped so low that he caused serious injury to himself and those under his command during a high-risk rescue operation. He felt that he had finally hit bottom; that's when Cyberdata showed up. They promised to heal him and provide him with a special suit. In return, he needed to supply them with his tremendous power for various combat operations. All he had to do was follow orders, with the help of a \"brain box\" in his head. He then became a S.H.O.C. and did Cyberdata's evil bidding, until the benign Dr. Corben removed the brain box from his head and showed Heatwave the error of his ways. He then teamed up with Corben, as well as former S.H.O.C.s Stryker and Cyblade, to form Cyberforce.\n\nAt one point, Heatwave became aware of a reality disruption that was threatening to isolate many superpowered beings from each other. He was in favor of that, for it would leave Cyberforce with less enemies to fight. Velocity and Ripclaw rebelled against this, for the disruption would also isolate them from many dear friends.\n\nWhen the demon Mephisto invaded from the Marvel Universe, he abducted Heatwave and brainwashed him into acting as his lieutenant. He was entrusted with overseeing the enforced hedonism as the 'Mayor' in New York and the 'Fire King' in Las Vegas. However, Cyblade talked him into his senses and he turned against Mephisto, sacrificing his life to thwart the demon’s plans.\n\nA copy of Heatwave was created by technology from a crashed alien ship. Through this ship, he was made aware of the threat posed by another alien ship approaching Earth. He went to Cyberforce’s part-completed backup base on Mikquit Island in Long Island Sound in order to make it ready to repel the aliens, and had the work completed by the time Ripclaw, Velocity, Ballistic and Cyblade arrived with the same aim.\n\nDuring the initial skirmish when the Hunter-Killer team attacked Long Island, Heatwave took a blast from Samantha Argent’s bioelectric powers. The damage to his suit left him vulnerable to being burnt up by his own powers, until the suit was repaired by Architect.\n\nWhen Ellis offered to stay with Cyberforce and safeguard against Velocity’s new Ultra-Sapien powers, Heatwave decided to join the Hunter-Killer team. He did this partly because he did not fully trust them, but also because he felt he had a diminished role within Cyberforce since his resurrection, as Cyblade had stepped up as leader in his absence.\n\nHeatwave was a cybernetically enhanced mutant who was able to absorb and retain ambient solar energy. He wore a specially designed suit that was built for him by Cyberdata that allowed him to regulate this energy and release it as a forced beam of super-heated sub-atomic particles called plasma. This plasma could then be used as a weapon or as a means of self-propelled flight. Heatwave could project a plasma beam and fly at high speed by riding super-heated air currents. Heatwave did not need the suit to absorb and release energy. His mutant metabolism enabled him to do this on his own. The suit made him much more efficient and magnified his powers considerably. Without it, though, he had to be extremely careful of the amount of energy he absorbed because his body would eventually be consumed by the plasma heat.\n"}

Mammals show little pairing apart from in germline cells, taking place at specific loci, and under the control of developmental signalling (understood as a subset of other long-range interchromosomal interactions such as looping, and organisation into chromosomal territories).\n\nWhile meiotic pairing has been extensively studied, the role of somatic pairing has remained less well understood, and even whether it is mechanistically related to meiotic pairing is unknown.\n\nThe first review of somatic pairing was made by Metz in 1916, citing the first descriptions of pairing made in 1907 and 1908 by N. M. Stevens in germline cells, who noted:\n\n“it may therefore be true that pairing of homologous chromosomes occurs in connection with each mitosis throughout the life history of these insects” (p.215)\n\nStevens noted the potential for communication and a role in heredity.\n\nWhile meiotic homologous pairing subsequently became well studied, somatic pairing remained neglected due to what has been described as \"limitations in cytological tools for measuring pairing and genetic tools for perturbing pairing dynamics\".\n\nIn 1998 it was determined that homologous pairing in \"Drosophila\" occurs through independent initiations (as opposed to a directed, 'processive zippering' motion).\n\nThe first RNAi screen (based on DNA FISH) was carried out to identify genes regulating \"D. melanogaster\" somatic pairing in 2012, described at the time as providing \"an extensive “parts list” of mostly novel factors\". These comprised 40 pairing promoting genes and 65 'anti-pairing' genes (of which 2 and 1 were already known, respectively), many of which have human orthologs.\n\nAn earlier RNAi screen in 2007 showed the disruption of Topoisomerase II activity impairs somatic pairing within \"Drosophila\" tissue culture, indicating a role for topoisomerase-mediated organisation (or the direct interactions of topoisomerase enzymes) in pairing. Condensin (despite dependent interactions with Topoisomerase II) is antagonistic to \"Drosophila\" homologous pairing.\n\n"}
{"id": "457673", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=457673", "title": "Implantable cardioverter-defibrillator", "text": "Implantable cardioverter-defibrillator\n\nAn implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) or automated implantable cardioverter defibrillator (AICD) is a device implantable inside the body, able to perform cardioversion, defibrillation, and (in modern versions) pacing of the heart. The device is therefore capable of correcting most life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias. The ICD is the first-line treatment and prophylactic therapy for patients at risk for sudden cardiac death due to ventricular fibrillation and ventricular tachycardia. Current devices can be programmed to detect abnormal heart rhythms and deliver therapy via programmable antitachycardia pacing in addition to low-energy and high-energy shocks.\n\n\"AICD\" was trademarked by the Boston Scientific corporation, so the more generic \"ICD\" is preferred terminology.\n\nCurrent device batteries last about 6–10 years, With advances in the technology (batteries with more capacity or, potentially in the future with rechargeable batteries ) it may be possible to increase this well past 10 years. The lead (the electrical cable connecting the device to the heart) has a much longer average longevity but can incur various types of malfunction, specifically insulation failure or fracture of the conductor and require replacement.\n\nThe process of implantation of an ICD system is similar to implantation of a pacemaker. In fact, ICDs are composed of an ICD generator and of wires. The first component or generator, contains a computer chip or circuitry with RAM (memory), programmable software, a capacitor and a battery; this is implanted typically under the skin in the left upper chest. The second part of the system is an electrode wire or wires that, similar to pacemakers, are connected to the generator and passed through a vein to the right chambers of the heart. The lead usually lodges in the apex or septum of the right ventricle. Just like pacemakers, ICDs can have a single wire or lead in the heart (in the right ventricle, single chamber ICD), two leads (in the right atrium and right ventricle, dual chamber ICD) or three leads (biventricular ICD, one in the right atrium, one in the right ventricle and one on the outer wall of the left ventricle). The difference between pacemakers and ICDs is that pacemakers are also available as temporary units and are generally designed to correct slow heart rates, i.e. bradycardia, while ICDs are often permanent safeguards against sudden life-threatening arrhythmias.\n\nRecent developments include the subcutaneous ICD (S-ICD), and the ability to pace the left ventricle from multiple sites near-simultaneously with Multipoint Pacing (Abbott). \n\nImplantation of ICD is meant to prevent sudden cardiac death and is indicated under various conditions. Two broad but distinct categories are primary and secondary prevention. Primary prevention refers to patients who have not suffered a life-threatening arrhythmia episode. Secondary prevention has the strongest evidence for benefit and it refers to survivors of cardiac arrest secondary to ventricular fibrillation or hemodynamically unstable sustained ventricular tachycardia after reversible causes are excluded.\nSimilarly, ICD use in primary prevention is to prevent cardiac death in patients who are at risk for sustained ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation. This population accounts for the bulk of all ICD implants. There are a multitude of guideline indications for ICD use in primary preventions with varying degree of supporting evidence. Periodically, both the American College of Cardiology (ACC)/American Heart Association (AHA) and European Society of Cardiology provide an update to this guideline. Some of the Class I indications are as follows:\n\n\nA number of clinical trials have demonstrated the superiority of the ICD over AAD (antiarrhythmic drugs) in the prevention of death from malignant arrhythmias.\nThe SCD-HeFT trial (published in 2005) showed a significant all-cause mortality benefit for patients with ICD. Congestive heart failure patients that were implanted with an ICD had an all-cause death risk 23% lower than placebo and an absolute decrease in mortality of 7.2 percentage points after five years in the overall population.\nReporting in 1999, the \"Antiarrhythmics Versus Implantable Defibrillators\" (AVID) trial consisted of 1,016 patients, and deaths in those treated with AAD were more frequent (\"n\" = 122) compared with deaths in the ICD groups (\"n\" = 80, \"p\" < 0.001). In 2002 the MADITII trial showed benefit of ICD treatment in patients after myocardial infarction with reduced left ventricular function (EF<30).\n\nInitially ICDs were implanted via thoracotomy with defibrillator patches applied to the epicardium or pericardium. The device was attached via subcutaneous and transvenous leads to the device contained in a subcutaneous abdominal wall pocket. The device itself acts as an electrode. Most ICDs nowadays are implanted transvenously with the devices placed in the left pectoral region similar to pacemakers. Intravascular spring or coil electrodes are used to defibrillate. The devices have become smaller and less invasive as the technology advances. Current ICDs weigh only 70 grams and are about 12.9 mm thick.\n\nA recent study by Birnie and colleagues at the University of Ottawa Heart Institute has demonstrated that ICDs are underused in both the United States and Canada. An accompanying editorial by Dr. Chris Simpson of Queen's University explores some of the economic, geographic, social and political reasons for this.\n\nThe development of the ICD was pioneered at Sinai Hospital in Baltimore by a team including Michel Mirowski, Morton Mower, and William Staewen. Mirowski teamed up with Mower and Staewen and together they commenced their research in 1969 but it was 11 years before they treated their first patient.\n\nThe work was commenced against much skepticism even by leading experts in the field of arrhythmias and sudden death. There was doubt that their ideas would ever become a clinical reality. In 1972 Bernard Lown, the inventor of the external defibrillator, and Paul Axelrod stated in the journal \"Circulation\" – \"The very rare patient who has frequent bouts of ventricular fibrillation is best treated in a coronary care unit and is better served by an effective anti-arrhythmic program or surgical correction of inadequate coronary blood flow or ventricular malfunction. In fact, the implanted defibrillator system represents an imperfect solution in search of a plausible and practical application.\"\n\nThe problems to be overcome were the design of a system which would allow detection of ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia. Despite the lack of financial backing and grants, they persisted and the first device was implanted in February 1980 at Johns Hopkins Hospital by Dr. Levi Watkins, Jr.\n\nThe first devices required the chest to be cut open and a mesh electrode sewn onto the heart; the pulse generator was placed in the abdomen.\n\nICDs constantly monitor the rate and rhythm of the heart and can deliver therapies, by way of an electrical shock, when the heart rate exceeds a preset number. More modern devices have software designed to attempt a discrimination between ventricular fibrillation and ventricular tachycardia (VT), and may try to pace the heart faster than its intrinsic rate in the case of VT, to try to break the tachycardia before it progresses to ventricular fibrillation. This is known as overdrive pacing, or anti-tachycardia pacing (ATP). ATP is only effective if the underlying rhythm is ventricular tachycardia, and is never effective if the rhythm is ventricular fibrillation.\n\nMany modern ICDs use a combination of various methods to determine if a fast rhythm is normal, supraventricular tachycardia, ventricular tachycardia, or ventricular fibrillation.\n\n\"Rate discrimination\" evaluates the rate of the lower chambers of the heart (the ventricles) and compares it to the rate in the upper chambers of the heart (the atria). If the rate in the atria is faster than or equal to the rate in the ventricles, then the rhythm is most likely not ventricular in origin, and is usually more benign. If this is the case, the ICD does not provide any therapy, or withholds it for a programmable length of time.\n\n\"Rhythm discrimination\" will see how regular a ventricular tachycardia is. Generally, ventricular tachycardia is regular. If the rhythm is irregular, it is usually due to conduction of an irregular rhythm that originates in the atria, such as atrial fibrillation. In the picture, an example of torsades de pointes can be seen; this represents a form of irregular ventricular tachycardia. In this case, the ICD will rely on rate, not regularity, to make the correct diagnosis.\n\n\"Morphology discrimination\" checks the morphology of every ventricular beat and compares it to what the ICD knows is the morphology of normally conducted ventricular impulse for the patient. This normal ventricular impulse is often an average of a multiple of normal beats of the patient acquired in the recent past and known as a template.\n\nThe integration of these various parameters is very complex, and clinically, the occurrence of inappropriate therapy is still occasionally seen and a challenge for future software advancements.\n\nPeople who have an implanted cardioverter-defibrillator can live full lives. Usually the ICD may not improve the quality of life of the patient, although it may provide a strong degree of reassurance. As with a pacemaker, however, living with an ICD does impose some restrictions on the person's lifestyle, outlined below.\n\nAlmost all forms of physical activities can be performed by patients with an ICD. All forms of sports that do not pose a risk of damaging the ICD or because of the underlying cardiomyopathy can be undertaken by the patient. Special care should be taken not to put excessive strain on the shoulder, arm and torso area where the ICD is implanted. Doing so may damage the ICD or the leads going from the ICD generator to the patient's heart. Particularly to be avoided are exercises that cause the clavicle to be pulled down towards the ribs, such as lifting weights with the arm, on the ICD site, while standing.\n\nEquipment using large magnets or generating magnetic fields, or any similar environment, must be avoided by patients with an ICD. \nAs with other metallic objects, an ICD is normally a contraindication to the use of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). However, several ICD manufacturers have recently introduced MR-Conditional ICDs, which allow the use of MRI under specified safe operating conditions.\n\nImplantable cardioverter defibrillators have demonstrated clear life-saving benefits, but concerns about patient acceptance and psychological adjustment to the ICD have been the focus of much research. Researchers, including those from the field of cardiac psychology, have concluded that the quality of life (QoL) of ICD patients is at least equal to, or better than, that of those taking anti-arrhythmic medications. The largest study of examined 2,521 patients with stable heart failure in the SCD-HeFT trial. Results indicated that there were no differences between ICD-treated and medication-treated groups at 30 months in patient-reported QoL. Psychological adjustment following ICD implantation has also been well studied. In rare cases, the ICD can become infected and is usually bacterial in origin but other organisms such as certain fungi have occasionally been implicated. This is more likely to occur in people with diabetes, heart failure, kidney failure, or a suppressed immune system.\n\nAnxiety is a common psychological side effect, with approximately 13–38% of ICD patients reporting clinically significant anxiety. The primary etiological factors contributing to anxiety in ICD patients have not been determined, however. Depressive symptoms are also common, but the incidence of these problems has been shown to be similar to those observed in other cardiac patient groups, with approximately 24–41% of patients with ICDs experiencing depressive symptoms. Problems in psychosocial adjustment to ICDs, including the experience of anxiety, among spouses or other romantic partners are also prevalent. This phenomenon may be related, at least in part, to shared shock anxiety and avoidance of physical and sexual contact.\n\n\n"}

Its common stock is a component of the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the company is ranked No. 37 on the 2018 Fortune 500 list of the largest United States corporations by total revenue.\n\nJohnson & Johnson is headquartered in New Brunswick, New Jersey, the consumer division being located in Skillman, New Jersey. The corporation includes some 250 subsidiary companies with operations in 60 countries and products sold in over 175 countries. Johnson & Johnson had worldwide sales of $70.1 billion during calendar year 2015.\nJohnson & Johnson's brands include numerous household names of medications and first aid supplies. Among its well-known consumer products are the Band-Aid Brand line of bandages, Tylenol medications, Johnson's baby products, Neutrogena skin and beauty products, Clean & Clear facial wash and Acuvue contact lenses.\n\nJohnson & Johnson operates over 250 companies in what is termed \"the Johnson & Johnson family of companies\". The company operates in three broad divisions; Consumer Healthcare, Medical Devices and Pharmaceuticals.\nInspired by a speech by antiseptic advocate Joseph Lister, Robert Wood Johnson joined his brothers James Wood Johnson and Edward Mead Johnson to create a line of ready-to-use surgical dressings in 1885. The company produced its first products in 1886 and incorporated in 1887. Those products already featured a logo resembling the signature of James Wood Johnson, very similar to the logo used today. It is one of the longest-used company logos in the world.\n\nRobert Wood Johnson served as the first president of the company. He worked to improve sanitation practices in the nineteenth century, and lent his name to the Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital in New Brunswick, New Jersey. Upon his death in 1910, he was succeeded in the presidency by his brother James Wood Johnson until 1932, and then by his son, Robert Wood Johnson II.\n\nRobert Wood Johnson's granddaughter, Mary Lea Johnson Richards, was the first baby to appear on a Johnson & Johnson baby powder label. His great-grandson, Jamie Johnson, made a documentary called \"Born Rich\" about the experience of growing up as the heir to one of the world's greatest fortunes.\nMcNeil Consumer Healthcare was founded on March 16, 1879, by 23-year-old Robert McNeil. In 1904, one of McNeil's sons, Robert Lincoln McNeil, became part of the company, and together they created McNeil Laboratories in 1933. The company focused on direct marketing of prescription drugs to hospitals, pharmacists, and doctors. Development of acetaminophen began under the leadership of Robert L. McNeil, Jr., who later served as the firm's chairman. In 1959, Johnson & Johnson acquired McNeil Laboratories and a year later the company was able to sell Tylenol for the first time ever, without a prescription. In 1977, two subsidiary companies were created; McNeil medicals products and McNeil Consumer Products Company (also known as McNeil Consumer Healthcare). The focus of McNeil medicals products is to market prescription drugs. In 1993 McNeil medicals products merged with the Ortho Pharmaceutical to form Ortho-McNeil Pharmaceutical. In 2001 McNeil Consumer Healthcare changed its name to McNeil Consumer & Specialty medicals products. However, it was later changed to \"McNeil Consumer Healthcare\". The company markets over-the-counter and prescription medicals products including complete lines of Tylenol and Motrin IB (ibuprofen) products for adults and children.\n\nIn 2008 a Wellness & Prevention Platform was established with the double acquisition of Orlando-based LGE Performance Systems, Inc. and Ann Arbor-based HealthMedia, Inc.\n\nIn 1933, Swiss chemist Bernhard Joos set up a small research laboratory in Schaffhausen, Switzerland. This set the basis for the founding of Chemische Industrie-Labor AG (Chemical Industry Laboratory AG or Cilag) on 12 May 1936. In 1959, Cilag joined the Johnson & Johnson family of companies. In the early nineties, the marketing organizations of Cilag and Janssen Pharmaceutica were joined to form Janssen-Cilag. The non-marketing activities of both companies still operate under their original name. Cilag continues to have operations under the Cilag name in Switzerland, ranging from research and development through manufacturing and international services.\n\nIn May 2011 Cilag acquired the over-the-counter operations of J B Chemicals & Pharmaceuticals Limited for around $260 million. In June 2012, the division announced the acquisition of CorImmun GmbH, and its lead compound, COR-1, a small cyclic peptide in development for the treatment of heart failure. In August 2014, Cilag acquired Covagen a biopharmaceutical company which specializes in the development of multi-specific protein-based therapeutics. As part of the acquisition Cilag will gain access to Covagen's lead drug candidate, COVA 322, a bi-specific anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha/anti-interleukin (IL)-17A FynomAb, is in a Phase Ib study for psoriasis.\n\nJanssen Pharmaceuticals can be traced back to 1933. In 1933, Constant Janssen, the father of Paul Janssen, acquired the right to distribute the pharmaceutical products of Richter, a Hungarian pharmaceutical company, for Belgium, the Netherlands and Belgian Congo. On 23 October 1934, he founded the N.V. Produkten Richter in Turnhout. After the Second World War, the name for the company products was changed to Eupharma, although the company name Richter would remain until 1956.\n\nPaul Janssen founded his own research laboratory in 1953 on the third floor of the building in the Statiestraat, still within the Richter-Eurpharma company of his father. On 5 April 1956, the name of the company was changed to NV Laboratoria Pharmaceutica C. Janssen (named after Constant Janssen). On 2 May 1958, the research department in Beerse became a separate legal entity, the N.V. Research Laboratorium C. Janssen. On 24 October 1961, the company was acquired by the American corporation Johnson & Johnson. On 10 February 1964, the name was changed to Janssen Pharmaceutica N.V. Between 1990 and 2004, Janssen Pharmaceuticals expanded worldwide, with the company growing in size to approximately 28000 employees worldwide. In 1999, clinical research and non-clinical development become a global organization within Johnson & Johnson. In 2001, part of the research activities was transferred to the United States with the reorganization of research activities in the Johnson & Johnson Pharmaceutical Research and Development organization. The research activities of the Janssen Research Foundation and the R.W. Johnson Pharmaceutical Research Institute were merged into the new global research organization. On 27 October 2004, the Paul Janssen Research Center, for discovery research, was inaugurated.\n\nIn August 2013, the company acquired Aragon Pharmaceuticals, Inc.. In November 2014, the company acquired Alios BioPharma, Inc. for $1.75 billion. As a result of the purchase, Alios was incorporated into the infectious diseases therapeutic area of the Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson. In March 2015, Janssen licensed Tipofarnib (a farnesyl transferase inhibitor) to Kura Oncology who will assume sole responsibility for developing and commercialising the anti-cancer drug. Later in the same month the company announced that Galapagos Pharma and regained the rights to the anti-inflammatory drug candidate GLPG1690 as well as two other compounds including GLPG1205 (a first-in-class inhibitor of GPR84). Finally, in March, the company acquired XO1 Limited In November 2015, the company acquired Novira Therapeutics, Inc., gaining the lead candidate, NVR 3-778.\n\nDePuy was acquired by J&J in 1998, rolling it into the Johnson & Johnson Medical Devices group.\n\nIn September 2010, Johnson & Johnson announced it had completed the acquisition of Micrus Endovascular, manufacturer of minimally invasive devices for hemorrhagic and ischemic strokes. Micrus will operate under Codman Neurovascular, a business unit of Codman & Shurtleff, Inc.\n\nOn June 14, 2012, Johnson and Johnson completed the acquisition of Synthes for $19.7 billion, which was then integrated with the DePuy franchise to establish the DePuy Synthes Companies of Johnson & Johnson which includes; Codman & Shurteff, Inc., DePuy Mitek, Inc., DePuy Orthopaedics, Inc. and DePuy Spine, Inc. In February 2015, DePuy announced it would acquire Olive Medical Corporation. In May 2016, DePuy Orthopaedics, Inc. acquired Biomedical Enterprises, Inc., an industry leader in small bone fixation.

In 1982, Centocor transitioned into a publicly traded company. In 1999, Centocor became a wholly owned subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson. Since the acquisition, Janssen Biotech increased its annual sales from $500 million to more than $2 billion. During the same period, research and development investment increased from $75 million to more than $300 million.\n\nIn 2008, Centocor, Inc. and Ortho Biotech Inc. merged to form Centocor Ortho Biotech Inc. In June 2009 Johnson & Johnson, through a new wholly owned subsidiary, Kite Merger Sub, Inc., announced it would purchase all outstanding shares of common stock of Cougar Biotechnology, Inc. for $43.00 in cash or around $970 million. In the same year, Johnson & Johnson Nordic AB acquired Amic, developer of in vitro diagnostic, further strengthening the Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics division.\n\nIn June 2010, Centocor Ortho Biotech acquired RespiVert, a privately held drug discovery company focused on developing small-molecule, inhaled therapies for the treatment of pulmonary diseases. In June 2011, Centocor Ortho Biotech changed its name to Janssen Biotech, Inc. as part of a global effort to unite the Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies around the world under a common identity. In December 2014, the company announced it would co-develop MacroGenics cancer drug candidate (MGD011) which targets both CD19 and CD3 proteins in treating B-cell malignant tumours. This could net MacroGenics up to $700 million. In January 2015, the company announced it will utilise Isis Pharmaceuticals' RNA-targeting technology to discover and develop antisense drugs targeting autoimmune disorders of the gastrointestinal tract, with the partnership potentially generating up to $835 million for Isis. In May 2018, Janssen announced it would acquire BeneVir Biopharm, Inc. for an undisclosed sum.\n\nIn 1915, George F. Merson opened a facility in Edinburgh for the manufacturing, packaging and sterilizing of catgut, silk and nylon sutures. Johnson & Johnson acquired Mr. Merson's company in 1947, and this was renamed Ethicon Suture Laboratories. In 1953 this became Ethicon Inc. In 1992, Ethicon was restructured, and Ethicon Endo-Surgery, Inc. became a separate corporation. During the 1990s, Ethicon diversified into new and advanced products and technologies and formed four different companies under the Ethicon umbrella, each of which specialize in different products.\n\nIn 2008 J&J announced it would acquire Mentor Corporation for $1 billion and merge its operations into Ethicon. In the same year, Ethicon acquired Omrix Biopharmaceuticals, Inc. for $25 per share, or $438 million in total. In May 2012 Johnson & Johnson (China) Investment Ltd announced it would acquire surgery blood clotting developer, Guangzhou Bioseal Biotechnology Co., Ltd. In March 2016, J&Js Ethicon business unit announced it would acquire NeuWave Medical, Inc. In January 2017, J&J subsidiary Ethicon announced it would acquire Megadyne Medical Products, Inc., a medical device company that develops, manufactures and markets electrosurgical tools. In February 2017, Ethicon acquired medical device manufacturer, Torax Medical for an undisclosed sum. In June 2018, the business announced that Advanced Sterilization Products would be sold off to Fortive Corporation for around $2.8 billion.\n\nEthicon Endo-Surgery was part of Ethicon Inc. until 1992, when it became a separate corporate entity under the J&J umbrella. In 2008 Ethicon Endo-Surgery acquired tissue sealing system developer, SurgRx, Inc. In September 2011 the business acquired SterilMed, Inc.\n\nIn January 2017, J&J fought off competition from Sanofi to acquire Swiss drugmaker Actelion. Later in the month J&J announced a $30 billion deal, the largest ever pursued by the company, to purchase the Swiss company Actelion and to spin off its research and development unit, into a separate legal entity. In March, the company declared its tender offer for Swiss biotechnology company Actelion successful on Friday, reporting that Janssen Holding GmbH controlled 77.2 percent of the voting rights after the main offer period, equating to 83,195,346 Actelion shares. In keeping with earlier agreements, the company announced its intention to delist Actelion, whilst spinning out its drug discovery operations and early-stage clinical development assets into a newly created Swiss-based biopharmaceutical company, Idorsia Ltd. J&J will control 16% of Idorsia, with the ability to raise their stake to 32% through convertible notes.\n\nIn July 2016, J&J announced its intention to acquire the privately held company, Vogue International LLC, boosting Johnson & Johnson Consumer Inc. In September of the same year, J&J announced it would acquire Abbott Medical Optics from Abbott Laboratories for $4.325 billion, adding the new division into Johnson & Johnson Vision Care, Inc.\n\nIn July 2017, Johnson & Johnson Vision Care, Inc announced that its Abbott Medical Optics subsidiary would acquire TearScience, who recently received FDA approval for an office-based approach to imaging meibomian glands and treating meibomian gland dysfunction. In September, the company acquired subscription-based contact lens startup Sightbox.\n\nIn October 2010, J&J acquired Crucell for $2.4 billion and will operate as the centre for vaccines, within the wider Johnson & Johnson pharmaceuticals group.\n\nIn November 2015, Biosense Webster, Inc. acquired Coherex, Medical Inc. expanding the companies range of treatment options for patients with atrial fibrillation.\n\nIn March 2018, the company announced that LifeScan, Inc. would be sold off to Platinum Equity for around $2.1 billion In September of the same year Johnson & Johnson Medical GmbH acquired Emerging Implant Technologies GmbH, manufacturer of 3D-printed titanium interbody implants for spinal fusion surgery.\n\nThe following is an illustration of the company's structure, maintained though a number of mergers & acquisitions (this is not a comprehensive list):\nFor the fiscal year 2017, Johnson & Johnson reported earnings of US$1.3 billion, with an annual revenue of US$76.5 billion, an increase of 6.3% over the previous fiscal cycle. Johnson & Johnson's shares traded at over $126 per share, and its market capitalization was valued at over US$367.5 billion in September 2018.\nCurrent members of the board of directors of Johnson & Johnson are: Mary Sue Coleman, James G. Cullen, Dominic Caruso, Michael M.E. Johns, Ann Dibble Jordan, Arnold G. Langbo, Susan L. Lindquist, Leo F. Mullin, William Perez, Steven S. Reinemund, David Satcher, and William C. Weldon.\n\nSandi Peterson has served as Group Worldwide Chairman since 2012.\n\nOn top of Alex Gorsky and Sandi Peterson, current members of Executive Committees of Johnson & Johnson are: Dominic Caruso (the company's chief financial officer), Peter Fasolo, Paul Stoffels, and Michael Sneed.\n\nOn July 2, 2018, Johnson & Johnson's head of pharmaceuticals, Joaquin Duato, became the vice chairman of the executive committee.\n\n\nThe company has historically been located on the Delaware and Raritan Canal in New Brunswick. The company considered moving its headquarters out of New Brunswick in the 1960s, but decided to stay in the town after city officials promised to gentrify downtown New Brunswick by demolishing old buildings and constructing new ones.\n\nWhile New Brunswick lost many historic structures, including the early home of Rutgers University, and most of its historic commercial waterfront to the redevelopment effort, the gentrification did attract people back to New Brunswick. Johnson & Johnson hired Henry N. Cobb from Pei Cobb Freed & Partners to design an addition to its headquarters. The white tower in a park across the railroad tracks from the older portion of the headquarters in one of tallest buildings in New Brunswick.\n\nThe stretch of Delaware and Raritan canal by the company's headquarters was replaced by a stretch of Route 18 in the late 1970s, after a lengthy dispute. In 2002, the company released its plan of setting up Asia-Pacific information technology headquarters in New South Wales within five years.\n\nThe company's business is divided into three major segments, Pharmaceuticals, Medical Devices, and Consumer Products. In 2015, these segments contributed 44.9%, 35.9%, and 19.2%, respectively, of the company's total revenues.\n\nThe company's major franchises in the Pharmaceutical segment include Immunology, Neuroscience, Infectious Disease, and Oncology.\n\nImmunology products include the anti-tumor necrosis factor antibodies Remicade (infliximab), and Simponi (golimumab) used for the treatment of autoimmune diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's disease (Remicade only), ulcerative colitis, ankylosing spondylitis, and other disorders. In 2013, these two products accounted for 29% of Johnson and Johnson's pharmaceutical revenues, and 11.3% of the company's total revenues. A third immunology product, Stelara (ustekinumab), targets interleukin-12 and interleukin-23 and is used for the treatment of psoriasis.\n\nKey infectious diseases products include Incivio (telaprevir), a hepatitis C protease inhibitor; Intelence (Etravirine), a non-nucleoside HIV polymerase inhibitor; and Prezista (darunavir), an HIV protease inhibitor. Telaprevir sales are expected to decline due to the recent approval of treatment regimens that are more efficacious and much better tolerated. Etravirine and darunavir are notable for their high barriers to resistance development. Darunavir in combination with HIV polymerase inhibitors is recommended as a first line treatment option for treatment naive persons with HIV infection but etravirine is approved only for use in treatment-experienced patients, owing in part to its requirement for twice-daily dosing.\n\nThe company's CNS products include the ADHD drug Concerta (methylphenidate extended release), and the long-acting injectable antipsychotics Invega Sustenna (paliperidone palmitate) and Risperdal Consta (risperidone). Invega Sustenna and Risperdal Consta were the first widely utilized long-acting depot injections for the treatment of schizophrenia. Designed to address the issue of poor patient compliance with oral therapy, they are administered by intramuscular injection at intervals of 2 weeks and one month, respectively. Only minimal improvements in outcomes relative to the oral versions of these drugs were observed in the clinical trial setting, but some evidence suggests that the advantages of long-acting injections in clinical practice may be greater than is readily demonstrated in the environment of a clinical trial.\n\nOncology products include Velcade (bortezomib), for the treatment of multiple myeloma and mantle cell lymphoma and Zytiga (abiraterone), an androgen antagonist for the treatment of prostate cancer. In clinical trials, abiraterone treatment was associated with a 4.6 to 5.2 survival advantage when used either before or after chemotherapy with platinum-based drugs. On December 31, 2012, the Food and Drug Administration approved Sirturo (bedaquiline), a Johnson & Johnson tuberculosis drug that is the first new medicine to fight the infection in more than forty years.\n\nSectors in which the company is active include:\n\nSectors in which the company is active include:\n\nThe company does not have a slogan per se, but they do have a lengthy credo that is frequently referenced:\nJohnson & Johnson has set several positive goals to keep the company environmentally friendly and was ranked third among the United States's largest companies in \"Newsweek's\" \"Green Rankings\". Some examples are the reduction in water use, waste, and energy use and an increased level of transparency. Johnson & Johnson agreed to change its packaging of plastic bottles used in the manufacturing process, switching their packaging of liquids to non-polycarbonate containers. The corporation is working with the Climate Northwest Initiative and the EPA National Environmental Performance Track program. As a member of the national Green Power Partnership, Johnson & Johnson operates the largest solar power generator in Pennsylvania at its site in Spring House, PA.\n\nOn September 29, 1982, a \"Tylenol scare\" began when the first of seven individuals died in Chicago metropolitan area, after ingesting Extra Strength Tylenol that had been deliberately laced with cyanide. Within a week, the company pulled 31 million bottles of capsules back from retailers, making it one of the first major recalls in American history. The incident led to reforms in the packaging of over-the-counter substances and to federal anti-tampering laws. The case remains unsolved and no suspects have been charged. Johnson & Johnson's quick response, including a nationwide recall, was widely praised by public relations experts and the media and was the gold standard for corporate crisis management.\n\nOn April 30, 2010, McNeil Consumer Healthcare, a subsidiary of Johnson and Johnson, voluntarily recalled 43 over-the-counter children's medicines, including Tylenol, Tylenol Plus, Motrin, Zyrtec and Benadryl. The recall was conducted after a routine inspection at a manufacturing facility in Fort Washington, Pennsylvania, United States revealed that some \"products may not fully meet the required manufacturing specifications\". Affected products may contain a \"higher concentration of active ingredients\" or exhibit other manufacturing defects. Products shipped to Canada, Dominican Republic, Guam, Guatemala, Jamaica, Puerto Rico, Panama, Trinidad and Tobago, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait and Fiji were included in the recall. In a statement, Johnson & Johnson said \"a comprehensive quality assessment across its manufacturing operations\" was underway. A dedicated website was established by the company listing affected products and other consumer information.\n\nOn August 2009, 2010, DePuy, a subsidiary of American giant Johnson & Johnson, recalled its ASR (articular surface replacement) hip prostheses from the market. DePuy said the recall was due to unpublished National Joint Registry data showing a 12% revision rate for resurfacing at five years and an ASR XL revision rate of 13%. All hip prostheses fail in some patients, but it is expected that the rate will be about 1% a year.\nPathologically, the failing prosthesis had several effects. Metal debris from wear of the implant led to a reaction that destroyed the soft tissues surrounding the joint, leaving some patients with long term disability. Ions of cobalt and chromium—the metals from which the implant was made—were also released into the blood and cerebral spinal fluid in some patients.\n\nIn March 2013, a jury in Los Angeles ordered Johnson & Johnson to pay more than $8.3 million in damages to a Montana man in the first of more than 10,000 lawsuits pending against the company in connection with the now-recalled DePuy hip.\n\nSome lawyers and industry analysts have estimated that the suits ultimately will cost Johnson & Johnson billions of dollars to resolve.\n\nIn 2010 and 2011, Johnson & Johnson voluntarily recalled some over-the-counter products including Tylenol due to an odor caused by tribromoanisole. In this case, 2,4,6-tribromophenol was used to treat wooden pallets on which product packaging materials were transported and stored.\n\nIn 2010 a group of shareholders sued the board for allegedly failing to take action to prevent serious failings and illegalities since the 1990s, including manufacturing problems, bribing officials, covering up adverse effects and misleading marketing for unapproved uses. The judge initially dismissed the case in September 2011, but allowed the plaintiffs opportunity to refile at a later time. In 2012 Johnson and Johnson proposed a settlement with the shareholders, whereby the company would institute new oversight, quality and compliance procedures binding for five years.\n\nJuries in several US states have found J&J guilty of concealing the adverse effects of Janssen Pharmaceuticals' antipsychotic medication Risperdal, produced by its unit, in order to promote it to doctors and patients as better than cheaper generics, and of falsely marketing it for treating patients with dementia. States that have awarded damages include Texas ($158 million), South Carolina ($327 million), Louisiana ($258 million), and most notably Arkansas ($1.2 billion).\n\nIn 2010, the United States Department of Justice joined a whistleblowers suit accusing the company of illegally marketing Risperdal through Omnicare, the largest company supplying pharmaceuticals to nursing homes. The allegations include that J&J were warned by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) not to promote Risperdal as effective and safe for elderly patients, but they did so, and that they paid Omnicare to promote the drug to care home physicians. The settlement was finalized on November 4, 2013, with J&J agreeing to pay a penalty of around $2.2 billion, \"including criminal fines and forfeiture totaling $485 million and civil settlements with the federal government and states totaling $1.72 billion.\"\n\nJohnson & Johnson has also been subject to congressional investigations related to payments given to psychiatrists to promote its products and ghost write articles, notably Joseph Biederman and his pediatric bipolar disorder research unit.\n\nIn 2011, J&J settled litigation brought by the US Securities and Exchange Commission under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and paid around $70M in disgorgement and fines. J&J's employees had given kickbacks and bribes to doctors in Greece, Poland, and Romania to obtain business selling drugs and medical devices and had bribed officials in Iraq to win contracts under the Oil for Food program. J&J fully cooperated with the investigation once the problems came to light.\n\nIn May 2017, J&J reached an agreement to pay $33 million to several states to settle consumer fraud allegations in some of the company's over-the-counter drugs.\n\nJohnson & Johnson registered the Red Cross as a U.S. trademark for \"medicinal and surgical plasters\" in 1905 and has used the design since 1887. The Geneva Conventions, which reserved the Red Cross emblem for specific uses, were first approved in 1864 and ratified by the United States in 1882. However, the emblem was not protected by U.S. law for the use of the American Red Cross and the U.S. military until after Johnson & Johnson had obtained its trademark. A clause in this law (now 18 U.S.C. 706) permits this pre-existing uses of the Red Cross to continue.\nA declaration made by the U.S. upon its ratification of the 1949 Geneva Conventions includes a reservation that pre-1905 U.S. domestic uses of the Red Cross, such as Johnson & Johnson's, would remain lawful as long as the cross is not used on \"aircraft, vessels, vehicles, buildings or other structures, or upon the ground,\" i.e., uses which could be confused with its military uses. This means that the U.S. did not agree to any interpretation of the 1949 Geneva Conventions that would overrule Johnson & Johnson's trademark. The American Red Cross continues to recognize the validity of Johnson & Johnson's trademark.\n\nIn August 2007, Johnson & Johnson filed a lawsuit against the American Red Cross (ARC), demanding that the charity halt the use of the red cross symbol on products it sells to the public, though the company takes no issue with the charity's use of the mark for non-profit purposes. In May 2008, the judge in the case dismissed most of Johnson & Johnson's claims, and a month later the two organizations announced a settlement had been reached in which both parties would continue to use the symbol.\n\nSince 2003, Johnson & Johnson and Boston Scientific have both claimed that the other had infringed on their patents covering heart stent medical devices. The litigation was settled when Boston Scientific agreed to pay $716 million to Johnson & Johnson in September 2009 and an additional $1.73 billion in February 2010. Their dispute was renewed in 2014, now on the grounds of a contract dispute.\n\nIn 2007, Johnson & Johnson sued Abbott Laboratories over the development and sale of the arthritis drug Humira. Johnson & Johnson claimed that Abbott used technology patented by New York University and licensed exclusively to Johnson & Johnson's Centocor division to develop Humira. Johnson & Johnson won the court case, and in 2009 Abbott was ordered to pay Johnson & Johnson $1.17 billion in lost revenues and $504 million in royalties. The judge also added $175.6 million in interest to bring the total to $1.84 billion. This was the largest patent-infringement award in U.S. history until the 2013 decision against Teva in favor of Takeda and Pfizer for over 2.1 billion dollars. In 2010 Abbott appealed the verdict and in 2011 won the appeal.\n\nTens of thousands of women worldwide have taken legal action against Johnson & Johnson after suffering serious complications following a vaginal mesh implant procedure. In 2016 the U.S. states of California and Washington filed a lawsuit against the company, accusing it of deception. More than 700 women began a class action against the company in the Federal Court of Australia in 2017, telling the court they \"suffered irreparable, debilitating pain after the devices began to erode into surrounding tissue and organs, causing infections and complications.\" The class action alleged that Johnson & Johnson, which \"aggressively marketed\" the implants \"failed to properly warn patients and surgeons of the risk, or test the devices adequately.\" Emails between executives show the company was aware of the risks in 2005 but still went ahead and made the product available.\n\nIn February 2016, J&J was ordered to pay $72 million in damages to the family of Jacqueline Fox, a 62-year-old woman who died of ovarian cancer in 2015: the company said it would appeal.\n\nBy March 2017, over 1,000 U.S. women had sued J&J for covering up the possible cancer risk from its Baby Powder product; the company says that 70 percent of its Baby Powder is used by adults.\n\nIn August 2017, a California jury ordered Johnson & Johnson to pay $417 million to a woman who claimed she developed ovarian cancer after using the company's talc-based products like Johnson's Baby Powder for feminine hygiene. The verdict included $70 million in compensatory damages and $347 million in punitive damages. J&J said they will appeal the verdict.\n\nIn October 2017, the Missouri Eastern District appeals court on Tuesday threw out a $72 million jury verdict. The appeals court ruled 3-0 that Jacqueline Fox's lawsuit lacked jurisdiction in Missouri because of a U.S. Supreme Court decision that imposed limits on where injury lawsuit can be filed which lawsuit's jurisdiction requires a stronger connection between the forum state and a plaintiff's claims. Fox, 62, of Birmingham, Ala., died in 2015, about four months before her trial was held in St. Louis Circuit Court. She was among 65 plaintiffs, of whom only two were from Missouri. Subsequently, it also would kill three other recent St. Louis jury verdicts of more than $200 million combined.\n\nIn July 2018, a St. Louis jury awarded nearly US$4.7 billion in damages to 22 women and their families after they claimed asbestos in Johnson & Johnson talcum powder caused their ovarian cancer.\n\nIn August 2018, Johnson & Johnson said that it removed several chemicals from baby powder products and re-engineered them to be safer for children.\n\nBy 2018, the company had become embroiled in the opioid epidemic in the United States and had become a target of lawsuits. Over 500 opioid-related cases have been filed as of May 2018 against Johnson & Johnson and its competitors. In Idaho, Johnson & Johnson is part of a lawsuit accusing the company for being partically to blame for opioid-related overdose deaths.\n"}

Her visage inspired numerous literary works. In the United States, the mask is also known as \"La Belle Italienne\".\n\nAccording to an often-repeated story, the body of the young woman was pulled out of the Seine River at the Quai du Louvre in Paris around the late 1880s. Since the body showed no signs of violence, suicide was suspected.\n\nA pathologist at the Paris Morgue was, according to the story, so taken by her beauty that he had to make a wax plaster cast death mask of her face. It has been questioned whether the expression of the face could belong to a drowned person. According to other accounts, the mask was taken from the daughter of a mask manufacturer in Germany. The identity of the girl was never discovered. Claire Forestier estimated the age of the model at no more than 16, given the firmness of the skin.\n\nIn the following years, numerous copies were produced. The copies quickly became a fashionable morbid fixture in Parisian Bohemian society. Albert Camus and others compared her enigmatic smile to that of the Mona Lisa, inviting numerous speculations as to what clues the eerily happy expression in her face could offer about her life, her death, and her place in society.\n\nThe popularity of the figure is also of interest to the history of artistic media, relating to its widespread reproduction. The original cast had been photographed, and new casts were created from the film negatives. These new casts displayed details that are usually lost in bodies taken from the water, but the apparent preservation of these details in the visage of the cast seemed to only reinforce its authenticity.\n\nCritic Al Alvarez wrote in his book on suicide, \"The Savage God\": \"I am told that a whole generation of German girls modeled their looks on her.\" According to Hans Hesse of the University of Sussex, Alvarez reports, \"the Inconnue became the erotic ideal of the period, as Bardot was for the 1950s. He thinks that German actresses such as Elisabeth Bergner modeled themselves on her. She was finally displaced as a paradigm by Greta Garbo.\"\n\nAs of 2017 a workshop called L’Atelier Lorenzi in Arcueil made plaster death masks from a 19th century mold, which is said to be that of L'Inconnue de la Seine.\n\nThe earliest mention can be found in Richard Le Gallienne's 1900 novella \"The Worshipper of the Image\", in which an English poet falls in love with the mask, eventually leading to the death of his daughter and the suicide of his wife.\n\nAn image of \"L'Inconnue\" has been used on the cover illustration for the family history mystery novel \"A Habit of Dying\" by D. J. Wiseman.\n\nThe protagonist of Rainer Maria Rilke's only novel, \"Die Aufzeichnungen des Malte Laurids Brigge\" (1910), reflects:\nIn 1926 published \"Das ewige Antlitz\", a book about 126 death masks, writing about our subject that she is \"like a delicate butterfly to us, who, carefree and exhilarated, fluttered right into the lamp of life, scorching her fine wings.\"\n\nReinhold Conrad Muschler's 1934 widely translated best-selling novel \"Die Unbekannte\" tells the maudlin story of the fate of the provincial orphan Madeleine Lavin, who has fallen in love with the British diplomat Lord Thomas Vernon Bentick and, after a romance, commits suicide in the Seine when Bentick returns to his fiancée. This novel was turned into a film of the same name in 1936.\n\nA male pathologist was said to have recorded the face of an unidentified young woman who, around the age of sixteen, according to his story, had been found drowned in the Seine River at Paris, France around the late 1880s. The man at the Paris Morgue was so taken by her beauty that he worked for hours to make a plaster cast of her face. She was considered so beautiful that the worker said: \"Her beauty was breathtaking, and showed few signs of distress at the time of passing. So bewitching that I knew beauty as such must be preserved.\" The cast was also known as \"Bewitching Woman\", a nickname that never caught on. The cast was also compared to the \"Mona Lisa\", and other famous paintings and sculptures so much that, in the following years, copies of the mask became fashionable figures in Parisian Bohemian society. Other accounts state that the cast was taken from a young German mistress (also said to be the man's natural-born daughter) who bore the child of a mask-maker who sold the cast and then committed suicide (in the Seine River) when her baby was stillborn.\n\nOther examples appear in:\n\nVladimir Nabokov's 1934 poem \"L'Inconnue de la Seine\", written in Russian, was published in \"Poslednie Novosti\" in 1934. It has been argued that this poem has as much to do with the Slavic myth of rusalka as with the mask itself.\n\n\"L'Inconnue\" is referenced in William Gaddis' 1955 novel \"The Recognitions\".\n\nCaitlín R. Kiernan writes about \"L'Inconnue\" as the model of Resusci Anne in her novel \"The Drowning Girl\" (2012). The story is deeply tied to the themes and images of the book.\n\nReferenced as the origin of the CPR doll by Chuck Palahniuk in \"Exodus\", a story in \"Haunted\".\n\nMaurice Blanchot, who owned one of the masks, described her as \"a young girl with closed eyes, enlivened by a smile so relaxed and at ease ... that one could have believed that she drowned in an instant of extreme happiness\".\n\nIn Louis Aragon's 1944 novel \"Aurélien\", \"L'Inconnue\" played a significant role as one of the main characters attempts to rejuvenate the mask from various photographs. At the beginning of the 1960s Man Ray contributed photographs to a new edition of the work.\n\nIn 2012, Didier Blonde wrote a novel called \"L'inconnue de la Seine\", about a man in Paris who stumbles upon a copy of the mask in an antiques store, and who tries to find out more about the girl it was modelled after. The book was published by Gallimard (Blanche).\n\nIn 1963, Bentley Stone choreographed a version of L'inconnue to music by Francis Poulenc for the Stone-Camryn Ballet. It premiered with a cast that included Ruth Ann Koesun and John Kriza. That ballet was moved to the American Ballet Theatre in 1965 with Koesun and Kriza reprising their roles, and with Christine Sarry taking the role of the \"River Girl\".\n\nDirector Agnès Varda talks about L'Innconnue in her 1988 documentary \"Jane B. par Agnès V.\" where she compares Jane Birkin's desire to be famous but anonymous as the state of L'Inconnue.\n\nThe face of the unknown woman was used for the head of the first aid mannequin Resusci Anne. It was created by Peter Safar and Asmund Laerdal in 1958 and was used starting in 1960 in numerous CPR courses. Therefore, the face has been called by some \"the most kissed face\" of all time.\n\n\n"}

World War I battles in this area of the Western Front include the First Battle of Artois (December 1914–January 1915), the Second Battle of Artois (9–15 May 1915), and the Third Battle of Artois (25 September–15 October 1915).\n\nIt divides this part of the Western Front into four distinct sections: \n\nFollowing the various declarations of war which were to lead to the First World War, the German Army opened the war on her western front by first invading Luxembourg and Belgium and then gaining military control of important industrial regions in France. The German Army forced the Allied armies to retreat until the Battle of the Marne was fought, when the tide turned and the German Army was forced to retreat northwards. They did so to the river Aisne, dug in on the high ground there, and fought the First Battle of the Aisne. This encounter was inconclusive and what historians call the race to the sea followed, during which neither side was able to achieve a breakthrough as they edged to the north and at the conclusion both sides were to dig in along a meandering line of fortified trenches, stretching from the North Sea to the Swiss frontier with France. This line, the Western Front, remained essentially unchanged for most of the war. A war of movement was over and a type of warfare that no side had planned for was to take its place: a static war of attrition with both sides entrenched on either side of the front line.\n\nBetween 1915 and 1917, there were several major offensives along this front. The attacks employed massive artillery bombardments and massed infantry advances. However a combination of entrenchments, machine gun nests, barbed wire, and artillery repeatedly inflicted severe casualties on the attackers and counterattacking defenders and as a result, no significant advances were made. Among the most costly of these offensives were the Battle of Verdun with a combined 700,000 dead, the Battle of the Somme with more than a million casualties, and the Battle of Passchendaele or \"Third Ypres\", which saw roughly 600,000 casualties.\n\nBoth sides tried to break the deadlock by introducing new military technology, including poison gas, aircraft and tanks but it was improved tactics that eventually restored some degree of mobility to the conflict. The German Spring Offensive of 1918 was made possible by the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk that marked the end of the conflict on the Eastern Front. Using the recently introduced infiltration tactics, the German armies advanced nearly to the west, which marked the deepest advance by either side since 1914 and they very nearly succeeded in forcing a breakthrough.\n\nThe Germans could not in the end break the Allied line and now the numerical advantage given the Allies by the volume of soldiers arriving from the United States of America fuelled an inexorable advance by the Allied armies during the second half of 1918. The German Army commanders finally realised that defeat was inevitable, and the government was forced to sue for conditions of an armistice. This took place on 11 November 1918 and the terms of peace were agreed upon with the signing of the Treaty of Versailles in 1919.\n\nAfter the Battle of the Marne and the Battle of the Aisne, the encounters between the two opposing armies moved northwards towards Compiègne on 17 to 18 September 1914, to Roye on 22 September 1914, the Battle of Albert from 27 to 28 September 1914, and then the Battle of Arras from 30 September to 5 October 1914. From 4 to 8 October 1914 there was fighting at the Battle of La Bassée and at Neuve Chapelle. The two armies then continued to move northwards until the Yser and the North Sea coast were reached.\n\nNeuve Chapelle was to see a further Battle of Neuve Chapelle from 10 to 13 March 1915, followed by the Battle of Aubers Ridge on 9 May 1915, Battle of Festubert from 15 to 25 May 1915, and the Battle of Loos from 25 September to 18 October 1915.\n\nNo major attacks took place in the Arras sector from the end of October 1915 to April 1917, but then we see the huge Battle of Arras fought from 9 April to 17 May 1917, fighting at Hill 70 in August 1917, the \"Kaiser's Battle\" from 21 to 28 March 1918, the Battle of the Lys in April 1918, and the Second Battle of Arras in August 1918.\n\nThe Battle of Armentières was part of the so-called \"Race to the Sea\", the series of battles that were ultimately to define the line of the Western Front as trench warfare finally took over in the autumn of 1914.\n\nSouth from Armentières was the front line dominated by the Aubers Ridge. The German army held this ridge, so much of the fighting in the sector involved attempts to dislodge them from it.\n\nBelow are some photographs of the \"Cobber\" memorial, and V C Corner.\n\nIt was on 24 March 1915, several days after the failed offensive at Neuve-Chapelle, that General Joffre made an official request for the British Army to take part in a huge offensive he was planning in Artois at the beginning of May. The aim of the offensive was to break through the German line north of Arras. The main thrust of the attack was to be made by the 10th French Army on Vimy Ridge and two supporting attacks on the flanks would, it was hoped, secure the heights of Lorette Spur to the north-west and other high ground to the east of Arras. If everything went according to plan the French hoped that they would be able to advance into the coal basin itself and take Douai.\n\nIn this context the British fought two battles, that at Aubers Ridge and at Festubert, both fought in May 1915, and both to distract the German's from Joffre's main attack.\n\nNeither battle achieved the results hoped for and huge casualties were sustained- it reportedly took three days to transfer the wounded of 9 May to the field ambulances on the second line. In one single day of fighting the British Army had lost 11,000 men (dead, wounded and lost in action) which was, in relative terms, one of the highest casualty rates of the Great War, in particular for officers.\n\nThe memorial at Le Touret remembers those who died at Aubers and Festubert and have no known grave.\n\nIn the autumn of 1915, the British High Command had little enthusiasm for another major offensive but the French were quite insistent on one. Joffre's plans involved a two-pronged attack. The French Army was to launch a major attack in the Champagne area and a Franco-Commonwealth attack was planned on a line to the north of Arras. Of this 32-kilometre stretch the British were allocated a section running from Givenchy just north of the La Bassée Canal and the industrial town of Bully-Grenay in front of Lens; the Gohelle Battlefields.\n\nOne reason for Haig and French's lack of enthusiasm was that they did not feel that they had fully absorbed the lessons of Second Ypres, Festubert, Neuve Chapelle and Aubers Ridge, the earlier offensives of 1915 and the doomed Gallipoli campaign had diverted precious men and munitions from the Western Front. However, their major concern was that the levels of ammunition available would not support a major offensive as the initial advances by the infantry would have to be supported by a high degree of artillery fire. The French demand was however met and the British Army allocated the 10 kilometre sector mentioned earlier. At this battle the British intended to make their first use of gas and the offensive would give Kitchener's \"New Army\" a chance to show their mettle.\n\nIn fact the offensive failed both in the Champagne and at Loos and the Loos Memorial at Loos-en-Gohelle commemorates the 20,605 British officers and men who were killed from 25 September 1915 to the end of the war in November 1918 in the little sector between the river Lys in French Flanders and the village of Grenay, near Lens, in Artois. The Loos memorial forms the rear and two sides of Dud Corner Cemetery, so called because of the high number of unexploded shells found there.\n\nThe thousands of names of the servicemen missing in action with no known grave are inscribed on 139 stone panels attached to these side and rear walls. The Loos Memorial was designed by Sir Herbert Baker with sculpture by Charles Wheeler. Stone tablets containing the names of the missing are numbered from 1 to 139, starting at the north-west corner of the memorial and running around the walls to the south-west corner. It was unveiled by Sir Nevil Macready on 4 August 1930.\n\nThe Battle of Loos had opened on 25 September 1915. The 9th (Scottish) Division scored one of the few successes by gaining a foothold on the Hohenzollern Redoubt and Fosse 8, the main observation posts used by the Germans to view the area and the 15th (Scottish) took Loos and pushed on to the Hill 70 Redoubt. However, the gains, won at such a horrific loss of life, had to be capitalized on quickly and the reserves (mostly inexperienced New Army Divisions) were brought into action too slowly. The Germans counter-attacked and by 27 September the offensive was breaking down and the Germans had retaken both the Hohenzollern Redoubt and Fosse 8. Attempts to retake these important positions were made on 13 October 1915, but failed after further heavy losses and by 19 October 1915, the battle petered to a halt. The British Army had lost over 20,000 men.\n\nField Marshal Sir John French, already being criticised before the battle, lost his remaining support in both the Government and Army as a result of the British failure at Loos and his perceived poor handling of his reserve divisions in the battle. He was replaced by Douglas Haig as Commander of the British Expeditionary Force in December 1915.\n\nThe first use of gas by the British had not been a success but Kitchener's New Army had at least been \"bloodied\" and in every sense of the word. It has been estimated that more than 14,000 of those named on the walls of the Loos Memorial died in the Battle of Loos and that of the 8,500 who died on the first day, over 6,500 were to have no known grave.\n\nAmong the dead on the British side at Loos were: Fergus Bowes-Lyon, brother to Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon (later Queen Consort, of George VI and \"Queen Mother\"), author and poet Rudyard Kipling's son, John, and the poet Charles Sorley.\n\n\"Loos was the fourth failure of 1915 for the British and this time losses reached almost 48,000 men; at Vimy the French figure was almost identical. In the wider Artois offensive the total was 143,567.\".\n\nNo further attacks were to take place in the Gohelle, Vimy and Arras sectors until the spring of 1917.\n\nThe south-eastern end of the Vimy Ridge the east of the ancient city of Arras. East of Arras the front line crossed farms and villages. Arras was evacuated by French forces on 29 August 1914 but reoccupied a month later. It remained in French hands throughout the war. Underneath the city there were tunnels and catacombs dug out of the chalk by the Romans. Some were used during the First World War by medical units and as safe shelter for Allied troops. The city was destroyed by German artillery bombardments from vantage points on the high ground.\n\n\"As the boundary of the clay plain of Flanders and the chalk uplands of Artois, the Vimy Ridge and its smaller cousin Notre Dame de Lorette created a formidable military barrier, a geological fracture destined to have a deep impact on the lives of soldiers struggling for topographical advantage.\" In 1914, the German Army had taken both these ridges and had occupied both Loos and Lens, and it was largely as a consequence of the efforts of French Alpine divisions, and troops from Senegal, that they were kept out of Arras. Once the front line had stabilised, Arras was left at the centre of a salient and open to constant artillery bombardment from the high ground to the north and south. The French were always sought to redress this situation and after an offensive in 1914 Foch launched the Second Battle of Artois from 9 May to 19 June 1915. The Germans were driven from Notre Dame de Lorette but a major break-through was not achieved. The Vimy Ridge and beyond it Douai remained in German hands. There was however to be little respite and 1915 was to see another offensive in the area, the Battle of Loos.\n\nSouth of the coalfields around Lens, the Artois landscape gently rises up in a series of finger-like spurs. Two spurs of particularly high ground afford magnificent views in all directions. These spurs lie in a north-west to south-east direction and are located north-west of the city of Arras. They are known as the Loretto Heights (Notre Dame de Lorette) and the Vimy ridge.\n\nThe ridge had fallen to the German Army in October 1914. The French Tenth Army attempted to dislodge the Germans from the region during the Second Battle of Artois in May 1915 by attacking their positions at Vimy Ridge and Notre Dame de Lorette. During the attack, the French 1st Moroccan Division briefly captured the height of the ridge, where the Vimy memorial is currently located, but was unable to hold it owing to a lack of reinforcements. (See photographs of the Moroccan memorial in the gallery below.) The French made another attempt during the Third Battle of Artois in September 1915, but were once again unsuccessful in capturing the top of the ridge.\n\nIn February 1916 the British XVII Corps relieved the French Tenth Army from the sector and, on 21 May 1916, the German infantry attacked the British lines along a front in an effort to force them from positions along the base of the ridge. The Germans captured several British-controlled tunnels and mine craters before halting their advance and entrenching their positions. British counter-attacks on 22 May did not manage to change the situation, and in October 1916 the Canadian Corps relieved the British IV Corps and took up position along the western slopes of Vimy Ridge.\n\nThe Canadian Corps, commanded by Sir Julian Byng, was ordered to seize Vimy Ridge in April 1917.\n\nIn the week leading up to the battle, Canadian and British artillery subjected the enemy positions on the ridge to a constant barrage and the new No. 106 fuze, which allowed shells to explode on contact, as opposed to burying themselves in ground, facilitated the destruction of hardened defences and barbed wire.\n\nThe four Canadian divisions involved stormed the ridge at 5:30 a.m. on 9 April 1917. The Canadians showed great bravery and Hill 145, the highest and most important feature of the Ridge, and where the Vimy monument now stands, was captured in a frontal bayonet charge against machine-gun positions. After a further three days of fighting the Canadians were victorious. Victory was however achieved at a great cost with 3,598 Canadians killed and another 7,000 wounded.\n\nThe capture of Vimy was more than just an important battlefield victory. For the first time all four Canadian divisions attacked together: men from all regions of Canada were present at the battle. Brigadier-General A.E. Ross declared after the war, \"in those few minutes I witnessed the birth of a nation.\"\n\nIn 1922, the French government ceded Vimy Ridge to Canada in perpetuity together with the land surrounding it. The gleaming white marble and haunting sculptures of the Vimy Memorial, unveiled in 1936, stand as a terrible and poignant reminder of the 11,285 Canadian soldiers killed in France who have no known graves.\n\nThe Battle of Arras was a British offensive during the First World War. From 9 April to 16 May 1917, British, Canadian, New Zealand, Dominion of Newfoundland, and Australian troops attacked German defences near the city of Arras.\n\nAt this phase of the war, the Allied objective was to end the stalemate of the trenches and break through the German defences into the open ground beyond and engage the numerically inferior German army in a war of movement. The French High Command's plan was to launch a massive attack (the \"Nivelle Offensive\") about to the south of the British sector in the Aisne region and at Arras the Allied objectives were to draw German troops away from the ground chosen for the French attack and to take the German-held high ground that dominated the plain of Douai. The British effort was a relatively broad front assault between Vimy in the northwest and Bullecourt in the southeast. After considerable bombardment, Canadian troops advancing in the north were able to capture the strategically significant Vimy Ridge and British divisions in the centre were also able to make significant gains astride the Scarpe river. In the south, British and Australian forces were frustrated by the elastic defence and made only minimal gains. When the battle officially ended on 16 May, British Empire troops had made significant advances but had been unable to achieve a breakthrough and the stalemate of the trenches returned.\n\nThe Battle of Arras is normally divided into two phases. Phase one would embrace three encounters: the First Battle of the Scarpe which ran from 9 to 14 April 1917; the First Battle of Vimy Ridge from 9 to 12 April 1917; and the First Battle of Bullecourt from 10 to 11 April 1917.\n\nThe Second phase would embrace the Battle of Lagnicourt on 15 April 1917; the Second Battle of the Scarpe from 23 to 24 April 1917; the Battle of Arleux from 28 to 29 April 1917; the Second Battle of Bullecourt from 3 to 19 May 1917; and the Third Battle of the Scarpe from 3 to 4 May 1917.\n\nA great deal of ground was gained for relatively few casualties in the first two days and a number of strategically significant points were captured, notably Vimy Ridge. Additionally, the offensive succeeded in drawing German troops away from the French offensive in the Aisne sector. In many respects, the battle might be deemed a victory for the British and their allies but these gains were offset by high casualties and the ultimate failure of the French offensive at the Aisne.\n\nSiegfried Sassoon makes reference to the battle in his famous anti-war poem \"The General\" in which he derides the incompetence of the British military staff. The Anglo-Welsh lyric poet, Edward Thomas was killed by a shell on 9 April 1917, during the first day of the Easter Offensive. Thomas's war diary gives a vivid and poignant picture of life on the Western front in the months leading up to the battle.\n\nSassoon's poem read-\n<poem>\n'Good-morning; good-morning!' the General said\nWhen we met him last week on our way to the line.\nNow the soldiers he smiled at are most of 'em dead,\nAnd we're cursing his staff for incompetent swine.\n'He's a cheery old card,' grunted Harry to Jack\nAs they slogged up to Arras with rifle and pack.\nBut he did for them both by his plan of attack.\n</poem>\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2000243", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2000243", "title": "Marek Hłasko", "text": "Marek Hłasko\n\nMarek Hłasko (14 January 1934 – 14 June 1969) was a Polish author and screenwriter.\n\nHłasko's biography is highly mythologized, and many of the legends about his life he spread himself. Marek was born in Warsaw, as the only son of Maciej Hłasko and Maria Łucja, née Rosiak. At first he lived with his parents in Złotokłos; later they moved to Warsaw. In the Hłasko family, children were baptised relatively late, hence the writer-to-be was baptized on 26 December 1935 in the Church of the Holy Redeemer in Warsaw. It is said that during the baptism ceremony when asked if he renounces the evil spirits Marek answered \"No\". Later, these words were reported as the evidence of Marek's strong character. \n\nHłasko was three years old when his parents divorced in 1937. Maciej remarried a year later. He died on 13 September 1939, when his only son was five. The war left its stamp on Marek's psyche: later he wrote \"it is obvious to me that I am a product of war times, starvation and terror; it is the reason for the intellectual poverty of my short stories. Simply, I cannot think up a story that does not end in death, catastrophe, suicide or imprisonment. Some people accuse me of pretending to be a strong man. They are wrong.\"\nAt the outbreak of World War II, Hłasko's mother was working in the management secretariat of the City Power Station in Warsaw. During the occupation she was fired and ran a food stall till the beginning of the Warsaw uprising. As a result, the family's financial situation worsened. At this time Marek started his education; however, all documents that might provide information about his education were destroyed during the Warsaw Uprising. Among the schools that he attended was one near the St. Kazimierz Factory on Tamka Street. During the Warsaw Uprising, Marek stayed with his mother in Warsaw, and when it ended they moved to Częstochowa to the house of a friend. In March 1945, Maria and her son moved to Chorzów and two months later to Białystok, where she settled with Kazimierz Gryczkiewicz. In early 1946, Gryczkiewicz, Maria Hłasko and Marek moved to Wrocław. \n\nIn the summer of 1946, Marek Hłasko joined the Bolesław Chrobry First Wrocław Scout Troops. In order to become a member of the troop, Marek with his family's consent, gave 1933 as the year of his birth. Later he was dismissed from the scouts because of the poor attendance at the meetings. Marek worked as a messenger at the World Congress of Intellectuals for Peace, held in August 1948 in Wrocław.\n\nThe problems connected with Marek's education also cropped up. In his biography of Hłasko, Andrzej Czyżewski writes: \"(Marek) began his education at the age of six and a half. During his school years he was always one of the youngest pupils in the class. To make matters worse, he had a childish appearance. Hence, he could not show off with what a boy in the primary school wants to impress others: strength, dexterity and maturity. He made up for it with the aggression and pertness, even towards his teachers. As a consequence, he had very few school mates. He was always an outsider. He walked away before he managed to make friends and get accustomed to them.\". In June 1948 he graduated from the Maria Konopnicka Elementary School in Wrocław.\n\nFrom September to November 1948, he studied at the Chamber of Commerce’ of the Secondary School of Business and Administration in Wrocław, and from March until June 1949 in the Labour Association of Children Friends’ School in Legnica (at that time he lived in a dormitory). Later, from December 1949 to January 1950, he attended the Technical and Drama High School in Warsaw, yet, in the end of December 1949 and early January 1950, he was expelled for \"a notorious disrespect to school regulations, criminal violations, and wielding a corrupting influence on his colleagues\". \n\nAt the age of 16, he obtained his driving licence and started working as a van driver. On 28 September 1950 he was sentenced by the Magistrates' Court to two months of work with a 10% deduction from his salary (as he violated Article 7, point 2 of the Act on Securing Socialist Discipline of Work). After working off his sentence, he changed his employer.\n\nFrom 15 November 1950 to 1 January 1951, he worked in the Transport Depot in Bystrzyca Kłodzka. Experiences gained there later inspired him to write a novel \"Następny do raju\" (\"Next Stop–Paradise\"). In January 1951 he moved to Warsaw with his mother and step-father. Hłasko often changed his occupation but it was always his own choice. Successively, he worked from 26 February to 15 April 1951 in an Equipment Base of the City's Construction Union, from 27 April 1951 to 16 June 1952 in a subway construction company \"Metrobudowa\", from 4 August to 1 December 1952 in a Transport Association of Warsaw Associations of Consumers, and till 30 March 1953 in a Warsaw Transport Enterprise of the City Retail Sale.\n\nWriting became a chance to get out of this mind-numbing activity. His literary career started in 1951 when he wrote \"Baza Sokołowska\", his first set of short stories. Hłasko became a correspondent for \"Trybuna Ludowa\" (a popular Polish daily) when he was working for \"Metrobudowa\". At the end of 1952 he decided to show extracts of his book to Bohdan Czeszko. His reply letter written on 3 December of the same year included a criticism of Hłasko's literary attempts, but also drew attention to the young author's talent. Moreover, also in 1952, Hłasko followed Stefan Łoś's advice and established contact with the Polish Literary Association and Igor Newerly, who was the protector of young writers. Hłasko introduced himself, to both Czeszko and Newerly, as \"an uneducated driver who tries to describe his life in his free time after work\". \n\nIn April 1953, he received a three-month artistic scholarship from the Polish Literary Association. He gave up his driver's job for good, and went to Wrocław to work on his debut. Moreover, following Bohdan Czeszko's advice, he wrote a story based on his sketches (a final version of Baza Sokołowska) and finished a novel Sonata marymoncka. \n\nHe made his debut with \"Baza Sokołowska\" in \"Sztandar Młodych\" (a daily paper published in Poland in 1950–1997) in 1954. He became quickly known as the most talented writer of the young generation. However, the entering to the literary circle resulted in his alcoholism, which was becoming more and more pronounced. In 1955–1957, he edited a prose section in \"Po Prostu\" (a Polish socio-political magazine published in 1947–57), but he was not a good publicist. In 1956 he finally got his own flat in Warsaw. \n\nHe gained publicity and popularity thanks to his original working style as well as his unconventional behaviour and clothing. He was a legendary figure of the young generation, a symbol of non-conformism. He was well-built; however, the physical appearance concealed over-sensitivity and uncertainty. He was prone to depression and could not adapt to everyday reality. Marek's inclination to rows contrasted with his friends' positive opinions of him.\n\nIn 1958, he went to Paris. The press there called him an Eastern European James Dean, as Hłasko strikingly resembled him. Hłasko really identified himself with this role: he vandalized pubs and restaurants. At this time, he gained worldwide publicity. Nonetheless, he liked the life of a vagrant, so he left Paris and went to Germany and then to Italy.\n\nThe anticommunist edition of \"Cmentarze\" in the émigré Polish-language Parisian monthly \"Kultura\" launched a press campaign against him. When Marek was refused a renewal of his passport, he asked for political asylum in the Western Germany. After three months, he changed his mind and tried to return to Poland. However, while waiting for an answer from the Polish government, he decided to go to Israel in 1959. He could not live without Poland but at the same time he could not return to his homeland. As he did not have a talent for languages, he found it difficult to adjust to the reality of life abroad. He led a life of a vagrant, but he did not have to work while his publications provided him with a steady income. He performed manual labour, but he did so out of curiosity rather than need. Since 1960, he had lived in Germany with his wife, German actress Sonja Ziemann.\n\nIn 1963, he spent a month in prison for his feuds with the police. In 1964 he twice attempted suicide. Between 1963 and 1965, he spent a total of 242 days in psychiatric clinics. In 1965, he divorced his wife, and in 1966, with Roman Polanski's help, he went to Los Angeles. He was supposed to write screenplays, but it did not work out. He had an affair with Betty, the wife of Nicholas Ray, the author of \"Rebel Without a Cause\", and thereby ended his career as a screenwriter. He got a pilot's licence instead.\n\nIn December 1968, during one of his parties, he playfully pushed Krzysztof Komeda off an escarpment. As a result of this accident, Komeda got a brain hematoma and died four months later. Hłasko was to say: \"If Krzysztof dies, I'll go along\" \"(Jeśli Krzysio umrze, to i ja pójdę)\". In 1969, he came back to Germany.\n\nHe died in Wiesbaden at the age of 35. The circumstances of his death remain unknown. One hypothesis is that he mixed alcohol with sedative drugs. However, those who knew him maintain that suicide was out of the question in his case.\n\nIn 1975, his ashes were taken to Poland, and buried at the Powązki Cemetery in Warsaw. Jan Himilsbach, a writer, actor and stonecutter who worked at the cemetery, was one of the initiators for taking Hłasko's remains back to Poland. Himilsbach carved the inscriptions on Hłasko's grave. The notice was suggested by Hłasko's mother and it says: \"His life was short, and everybody turned their backs on him\".\n\nMarek's private life resembled the life of characters of his works – romantic, tough outsiders, who became symbols of disappointment with realities of the 1950s.\nHumphrey Bogart and Fyodor Dostoevsky were his idols.\nHis prose works voiced his objections to conformity and the hypocrisy of socialist realist literature. He wrote about protest of a moral nature. In his works he depicted the lives of the lower classes as dominated by hopelessness and cynicism. His characters dream about changes which come out to be vain.\nPublishing of his works had been forbidden in Poland for 20 years. He was a co-screenwriter of films such as \"Koniec nocy\" (1957), \"Pętla\" (1957), \"Spotkania\" (1957), \"Ósmy dzień tygodnia\" (1958) and \"Baza ludzi umarłych\".\n\n\n\n\n\nWszyscy byli odwróceni (1969\n\n\n"}

The film stars Bella Thorne, Patrick Schwarzenegger, and Rob Riggle, and follows a teenage girl with the disease xeroderma pigmentosum, which prevents her from going out into sunlight. When she meets a boy, she struggles to decide whether to tell him about her condition or pretend to live a normal life. Principal photography began on October 12, 2015 in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. The film was released in the United States on March 23, 2018.\n\nSheltered since early childhood, Katie Price lives with a life-threatening sensitivity to sunlight caused by the rare genetic condition, xeroderma pigmentosum. During the day, she is housebound, having only her father, Jack and her best friend, Morgan, to keep her company. Katie comes out of the house every night, when the sun is not present.\n\nOne night, she is noticed and asked out by her longtime crush, Charlie, while playing guitar at the train station. Katie leaves suddenly, and forgets her notebook, which Charlie keeps. He returns the next day, and gives it to Katie when she shows up to retrieve it. He explains to her how he got his injury that prevented him from getting a scholarship to the University of California, Berkeley before kissing her on one of the boats.\n\nHowever, Katie has yet to tell Charlie of her condition, despite her father warning her to. Charlie takes Katie out for a night to Seattle, where they go to a live show, and Charlie makes Katie play one of her songs on one of the city's streets. Once home, they go swimming out in the lake, and dry off with a fire on the beach. Charlie mentions watching the sunrise, and Katie freaks out, running home in fear. Charlie picks her up and quickly drives her there, but she does not make it in time, and is exposed to the sunlight for a couple of seconds. Katie runs inside, while Morgan and Jack come home soon after. Charlie still is standing confused at the front door, and Morgan explains that Katie has xeroderma pigmentosum. Once the doctors run some tests, Katie's doctor comes to the conclusion that Katie's brain is contracting, and it's only a matter of time before she dies.\n\nKatie begins to experience twitches in her finger, which prevents her from playing the guitar. She also ignores Charlie's messages as she does not want to hurt him. Jack eventually convinces Katie to speak to Charlie, who still wants to be with Katie, and does not care about the medical condition. Katie goes to Charlie's swim meet with the Berkeley coach, and they hang out at the house with Morgan and Jack. Charlie takes Katie out one night, and surprises her by booking a recording session, where she sings a song she wrote for him. Soon after, while hanging out at her house, Charlie mentions that he has to visit the boat for the last time, which he has been hired to take care of the whole summer. Katie, fearing that she is going to die, eventually remembers the time Charlie told her that he wished they could sail together, and convinces Jack to let her go with Charlie, despite it being the day. Katie sails with Charlie, feels the sunlight, and spend her final moments with him, dying soon after.\n\n\nOn June 22, 2015, it was announced that Scott Speer would next direct a young adult romantic drama film, \"Midnight Sun\", based on the script by Eric Kirsten, which would star Patrick Schwarzenegger as Charlie and Bella Thorne as Katie. The film is based on the 2006 Japanese film of same name. It was financed by Boies / Schiller Film Group, and produced by John Rickard and Zack Schiller. On October 9, 2015, Rob Riggle joined the film to play Katie's father, Jack.\n\nPrincipal photography on the film began on October 12, 2015, in Vancouver, British Columbia.\n\nIn October 2016, Open Road Films acquired distribution rights to the film. They initially scheduled it for July 14, 2017, before setting it for March 23, 2018.\n\n\"Midnight Sun\" grossed $9.6 million in the United States and Canada, and $17.8 million in other territories for a combined $27.4 million against a 2.8 million budget.\n\nIn the United States and Canada, \"Midnight Sun\" was released alongside \"Pacific Rim Uprising\", \"Sherlock Gnomes\", \"Unsane\" and \"Paul, Apostle of Christ\", and was projected to gross around $5 million from 2,173 theaters in its opening weekend. It ended up debuting to a gross of a little over $4 million, finishing 10th at the box office.\n\nOn review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 21% based on 56 reviews, and an average rating of 4.2/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \"\"Midnight Sun\" is a typically manipulative and contrived teen romance that's unfortunately distinguished by its offensively inaccurate portrayal of a real-life disease.\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 38 out of 100, based on 14 critics, indicating \"generally unfavorable reviews.\" Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A−\" on an A+ to F scale.\n\nMidnight Sun is the soundtrack album for the movie. It was released on March 16, 2018. The album features music of the pop and soundtrack genres.\n\n"}

Lions, tigers, bears, and wolves were among some of the animals that escaped, and were hunted by local law enforcement out of fear for public safety. The animals were killed or captured and taken to the Columbus Zoo and Aquarium. Owner Terry Thompson allegedly set free 56 of his exotic animals before allegedly shooting himself in the head. One hundred ten animals were killed by the local police. The animals freed included lions, leopards, wolves, primates, bears, and eighty tigers. The animals confirmed to be dead were eighteen tigers, six black bears, two grizzly bears, two wolves, one macaque monkey, one baboon, three mountain lions; nine male lions and eight lionesses. Three leopards, one grizzly bear, a three legged giraffe, and two monkeys were left caged inside Thompson's home. Unidentifiable samples of frozen sperm was also discovered in Thompson's basement. These animals were tranquilized and sent to the Columbus Zoo. One of the surviving leopards was subsequently injured in an accident at the zoo and was euthanized. One monkey was eaten by a tiger, one monkey with herpes simplex virus was never recovered. The wolf was killed after being hit by a car.\n\nTerry Thompson, a Vietnam War veteran prone to extreme violence, was a lifelong collector of exotic animals. In the years leading up to his death he went to prison on federal gun charges and was deemed an anti-government radical, he was heavily in debt, and his wife had left him; he may also have suffered from paranoia and schizophrenia. He had acted as an animal handler on Wild Kingdom in 2008, and provided a lion cub to a photoshoot with Heidi Klum.\n\nJack Hanna, TV wildlife expert and Director Emeritus of the Columbus Zoo, lamented the killings but deemed the police actions necessary. Ohio governor John Kasich called for a temporary moratorium on the sale of exotic animals.\nIn August 2012, Britain's Channel 4 broadcast a documentary on the animal release called \"America's Animal Hoarder: Horror at the Zoo\", featuring footage of Thompson's animals and interviews with those who brought the situation under control.\n\n"}
{"id": "4825161", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4825161", "title": "Nuke (Marvel Comics)", "text": "Nuke (Marvel Comics)\n\nNuke (real name Frank Simpson) is a fictional supervillain appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. Created by writer Frank Miller and artist David Mazzucchelli, the character first appeared in \"Daredevil\" #232 (July 1986). Nuke's most distinguishing feature is an American Flag tattooed on his face.\n\nA version of the character, known as Will Simpson, appeared in the first and second seasons of \"Jessica Jones\", played by Wil Traval.\n\nNuke was created by Frank Miller and David Mazzuchelli. He first appeared in \"Daredevil\" #232. Nuke largely disappeared following his apparent death in \"Daredevil\" #233, although his origin was explored and touched upon in issues of \"Captain America\" and \"Wolverine\". It was not until Grant Morrison's \"New X-Men\", when Morrison revealed Nuke was involved in the Weapon Plus program, that the character made a return in subsequent stories.\n\nFrank Simpson was a test subject of the Weapon Plus program, the supersoldier program that had created Captain America and would later have their Weapon X facility transform Wolverine into a killing machine. The enhancing and conditioning process went awry, leaving Nuke seriously deranged.\n\nThe origins of Nuke are explained in the series \"\".\n\nThe disturbed son of a wealthy, abusive, alcoholic, upper-class woman in Ohio, Frank soon developed an unhealthy affection for his babysitter, the only real maternal figure in his life. The young woman, who was harboring feelings for his father Charles, capitalized on Frank's affection and talked the boy into killing his mother. Wolverine, who at that time was an operative for Weapon Plus, had been sent to kidnap Frank Simpson. Wolverine showed up, dressed as a cop. He then stalked Charles Simpson and the babysitter, eventually shooting the girl with Charles' gun, after which Charles committed suicide. Wolverine then went to Frank's place and abducted him for the supersoldier project.\n\nYears later, Frank Simpson was sent into the Vietnam War as a black-ops agent. Captured by the Viet Cong, Frank was severely tortured by Logan (who was posing as a Russian intelligence liaison), shattering Frank's still unbalanced mind. While torturing him (even carving into his face the American flag that years later would become part of his superpowered personality), he implanted the phrase \"No V.C.!\" as a trigger word, along with the compulsion to kill gruesomely, in retaliation for the tortures suffered, anyone who uttered the words. He then allowed Frank to escape, testing his work with a village of peasants, who, seeing an American soldier, tried to soothe his anger and convince him to spare them, shouting the \"No V.C.!\" phrase, meaning that they were not Viet Cong. Frank, in response to the trigger word, burnt the village to the ground, killing every inhabitant. The experiment being a success, Logan was installed as his handler. Due to his trauma, Nuke often hallucinates that the enemies he is fighting are the Viet Cong.\n\nAt some time during the war, Nuke was inducted into the final part of the \"Project Homegrown\", the Weapon VII programs, that turned him into a partial cyborg with a subdermal mesh able to deflect bullets, and a second heart that, working in conjunction with some (placebo) pills, controlled his aggression, leaving him addicted as well. His whereabouts after the war are still unknown.\n\nNuke resurfaces, employed by Generalissimo Felix Guillermo Carridad, of Tierra Verde, to destroy a rebel base. Carridad is impressed with his skills, and he enjoys using Nuke periodically as a superhuman iconic symbol. Following an operation in Nicaragua, the Kingpin hires Nuke through a corrupt general and sends him to kill Daredevil. Nuke launches an attack on Hell's Kitchen, but is defeated by Daredevil. Enraged at a \"Daily Bugle\" article reporting on his mass murder in Hell's Kitchen, he escapes his handlers, intending to destroy the \"Bugle\" building. He is intercepted by Captain America and shot by a military chopper. He faints from the wound and is presumed dead by the general public. Nuke was taken into custody by the government, still controlled by the Tierra Verde enclave.\n\nIn the series \"Wolverine: Origins\", following Wolverine's regaining of his full memories, and his embarking on a mission to take care of loose ends, the U.S. government dispatches Nuke to hunt Wolverine down. Though Wolverine dispatches Nuke, it is revealed that Nuke's enhanced physiology has further mutated, giving him cybernetic limbs, bones and skull, and the ability to survive the most gruesome injuries, but has left him devoid of any personality or conscience. When Wolverine tries to kill him, Captain America intervenes, believing that Nuke is a failed subject of the Super Soldier Program. Wolverine asked the telepath Emma Frost to restore Nuke's broken mind, saying that he would euthanize Nuke if she determined that it was not possible.\n\nDuring Norman Osborn's tenure as the head of the American peace-keeping organization H.A.M.M.E.R., he adds a man named Scourge to his black ops team, the Thunderbolts, but the man later reveals himself to be Nuke, and is demoted from the position of team leader. During the events of the storyline \"Siege\", Nuke sustains injuries that render him comatose. In \"Captain America\" Vol 7 #12, Simpson is allied with the Iron Nail, attacking individuals in Europe that he perceives as enemies of America, until he is stopped by Captain America. He is caught in an explosion and presumed dead.\n\nNuke later appears alive with a shaved head in the \"Death of Wolverine\" mini-series. He is seen working for Madame Hydra and hunting Wolverine as part of her bounty. While at a bar in British Columbia, Wolverine uses his adamantium skull to headbutt Nuke to spread the word that he spared him while also getting the information on who placed the bounty on him.\n\nNuke possesses various superhuman physical attributes as a result of various cybernetic enhancements. Nuke's bones have been replaced with advanced cybernetic components, granting him superhuman strength of an unrevealed limit. Aside from his strength, Nuke's body is considerably more resistant to physical injury than that of an ordinary human; even the arcane nerve strikes Daredevil learned during training by his sensei, Stick, have no effect. Nuke's skin has been replaced with an artificial type of plastic that looks identical to human skin but is much more durable. In addition, he has an artificial secondary heart that works in conjunction with his colored pills. Nuke is the victim of decades of systematic physical and psychological conditioning at the hands of various individuals working for the United States government. As a result, Nuke is insane. He is now little more than a puppet in the hands of his current handler, and able only to follow issued commands. Also in his first appearance in \"Daredevil\", Nuke was equipped with a monstrous multi-barrelled assault rifle which, in addition to being able to fire massive volleys of bullets, fragmentation grenades, and rockets, was also (due to mechanisms left unexplained) able to \"keep count\" of the casualties inflicted. Nuke also had a habit of resetting the counter after noting down each \"score\" trying to \"better\" it in the coming assignment.\n\nApparently Nuke's metabolism is now remote controlled from a secret base on Tierra Verde, whose technicians are able to \"shut down\" the biomech systems in Nuke's body.\n\nNuke has a second heart, and takes different colored pills to produce different bodily effects.\nNuke's pill colors are: red, for increased adrenaline; white, to keep him balanced between missions; and blue, to bring him down.\n\nIt was originally stated that the red pills Nuke took affected his adrenal glands, sending him into his bloodthirsty rages. The \"\" series retconned this, stating instead that these pills are placebos, suggesting that Nuke lives in a constant state of increased adrenaline, but is not aware of this. The pills, therefore, trigger his violent behavior, but the effect is psychosomatic.\n\nIn the \"House of M\" storyline, Nuke is one of the government agents (alongside Mimic and Agent Barnes) sent to Genosha to kill Magneto and as many of his followers as possible. He and Mimic served as a distraction while Agent Barnes snuck into Magneto's headquarters. When Nuke entered Wanda's bedroom in order to kill her, he was disassembled by her.\n\n\"What If\" vol. 2 #48 showed what would have happened if Daredevil had saved Nuke. This story manifests as Ben Urich pondering the situation and thinking of alternatives.\n\nIn the Ultimate Marvel universe, Frank Simpson appears in \"Ultimate Comics: Captain America\" #1 as the man who was given the Super Soldier Serum during the Vietnam War when Steve Rogers was MIA after World War II, but his origin is more reminiscent of the Grand Director, a Captain America post World War II. Like his mainstream counterpart, Simpson has the American Flag tattooed onto his face. Simpson, completely disillusioned by America after Vietnam (1972) is believed to have betrayed his country due to the war and the augmentations, but has \"seen the Light\". He is trying to sell his reverse-engineered serum blood to the North Koreans, but is stopped by British S.A.S. and Steve Rogers. After his identity is revealed to Colonel Danvers, Cap is beaten, and travels to Saloth, a Cambodian village, but Simpson and his army (all pumped up with the Super-Soldier Serum) beat him. Simpson vows to make Cap, \"see the light\", strongly believing America stands for a number of atrocities in the last 50 years. Cap escapes and stops Simpson. He is brought into S.H.I.E.L.D. custody. Simpson is later visited by Cap in the Triskelion, which has Rogers reading the Bible to a bed-ridden Simpson.\n\nIn the Amalgam Comics universe, in which the characters of Marvel Comics were merged with those of DC Comics, Nuke is combined with DC's Bane as Hydra agent Bane Simpson.\n\nThe character appears in the first season of \"Jessica Jones\" as Will Simpson, portrayed by Wil Traval. Simpson is a police sergeant at the 15th Precinct and previously served in the 39th Infantry Division. He is introduced when he is sent by Kilgrave to kill Trish Walker. Being convinced by Jessica that his mission has been accomplished, Kilgrave commands him to jump off a rooftop. Jessica saves him, freeing him of Kilgrave's control, after which Simpson becomes a lover to Trish. He remains at odds with Jessica, as he is determined to murder Kilgrave to prevent him from hurting anyone else. After his attempt to kill Kilgrave with a bomb fails, Simpson reconnects with his military unit, using experimental pills to increase combat awareness. They also make him more manic, to the point that he kills fellow detective Oscar Clemons and two of his fellow operatives. He then attempts to kill Jessica, but is thwarted by both Jessica and Trish, when the latter takes some of his combat enhancements and overpowers him. Left unconscious, Simpson is later taken away by his doctor Miklos Kozlov and members of the mysterious \"IGH\" organization who provided him with the supplements.\n\nAt the start of season 2, Simpson is now using an inhaler and spying on Trish. He eventually catches up to Trish at a movie set, where Trish shoots him in the leg. When Jessica catches up and confronts Simpson about a recent string of deaths of IGH members, Simpson states that Trish is being targeted because of her investigation into IGH, before they are abruptly attacked by the assailant, who is later revealed to be Jessica's mother Alisa. Alisa kills Simpson by breaking his neck before escaping. Afterwards, Jessica and Trish take his body to the beach near Playland Park and Jessica tosses his body into the ocean. As the season progresses, Trish develops an addiction to the combat enhancers in Simpson's inhaler.\n\n"}

It represents not a revolution in mourning, but rather a shift in the medium mourners utilize to express their grief and memorialize the deceased. This shift has occurred in tandem with the widespread popularity of social media in the West, a result of which has been the need for users to accept death within an online environment. It is estimated that by 2012, 30 million Facebook users had died. Online mourning does not occur exclusively on social media websites. There are websites such as Legacy.com dedicated to hosting obituaries. Two distinct types of online mourning have been identified, high-profile cases that draw attention from a broad online community, and profiles posthumously recreated and reframed as a medium to memorialize the deceased.\n\nSince the advent of newspapers, the obituary became a preferred method of memorializing the deceased. Until recently, obituaries were one of the most read sections of the newspaper. As new media technologies such as radio and television were created, the obituary adapted to best reflect capabilities available in the new communication media. Authors Brian Carroll and Katie Landry have argued that the appearance of online mourning reflects a logical progress of mourning via social media networks through use of new media. Changes to the obituary as it adapts over media include an exponential increase in information about the deceased, and the content reaching a wider geographic audience. The occurrence of online mourning presents a new paradigm in the memorialization process by providing interactive, sometimes competitive documents for mourners. Studies of Facebook and Myspace indicate that while the majority of living users visit memorialized profile accounts immediately after learning of an individual’s death, visitation often continues long after, albeit less frequently.\n\nThere have been so many cases of online memorialization that it has resulted in the creation of websites such as MyDeathSpace.com, which attempt to create a catalogue of memorializations available on social media websites. Dead users with active profiles became problematic due to the inability of social media algorithms to recognize a user is deceased. In 2009, Facebook addressed this issue updating its policy to include an outline for handling user deaths through switching dead users’ profiles to memorial statuses.\n\nAs previously mentioned, online mourning presents a new aspect of mourning by allowing users to interact with the memorialization of the deceased. By posting to a memorialized individual, mourners can celebrate the life of the deceased, connect to each other, and facilitate closure. Studies of mourners’ interactions with memorialized profile pages have identified distinct themes of interaction with the deceased:\n"}

She was the second wife of Charles de Rohan, Prince de Soubise, a military leader and friend of Louis XV.\n\nBorn at the Parisian \"Hôtel de Soissons\", she was a member of a cadet branch of the House of Savoy. Her father was the Prince di Carignano.\n\nThrough her mother, she was a granddaughter of the then king Victor Amadeus of Sicily. Her mother was Maria Vittoria Francesca, legittimata di Savoia, Marchesa di Susa, a legitimised daughter of Victor Amadeus II and his \"maîtresse-en-titre\", Jeanne Baptiste d'Albert de Luynes.\n\nShe grew up in Paris, their parents fleeing the court of Savoy due to embarrassingly large debts. Their parents arrived in Paris during the regency of Philippe d'Orléans (1715–1723), regent of the Kingdom for the infant Louis XV.\n\nHer husband to be was Charles de Rohan, the widower of Anne Marie Louise de La Tour d'Auvergne, a granddaughter of Marie Mancini. As head of the cadet branch of the House of Rohan, Charles bore the titles \"Prince de Soubise\" and Duke of Rohan-Rohan. He became a Marshal of France in 1758, and served as a minister to Louis XV and Louis XVI. Orphaned at the age of 9, he was a notorious libertine.\n\nThe couple married in the original (\"vieux\") donjon of the château de Rohan in the town of Saverne on 6 November 1741. Presiding over the ceremony was the bridegroom's brother, Armand de Rohan, bishop of Strasbourg. Anne Thérèse had a step-daughter, Charlotte de Rohan, future wife of Louis Joseph de Bourbon, prince de Condé and grandmother of Louis Antoine Henri de Bourbon, Duke of Enghien, an \"émigré\" whose seizure and execution by personal order of Napoleon I would shock Europe in 1804.\n\nAnne Thérèse died in childbirth at the \"Hôtel de Soubise\". In December 1745, her widowed husband married again; this time to Landgravine Anna Viktoria of Hesse-Rotenburg.\n\n"}
{"id": "34445482", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=34445482", "title": "Princess Bubblegum", "text": "Princess Bubblegum\n\nPrincess Bonnibel \"Bonnie\" Bubblegum of the Candy Kingdom (colloquial: PB; Peebles; P-Bubs; Bonnie; Bon-bon), , is a fictional character in the American animated Cartoon Network television series \"Adventure Time\", created by Pendleton Ward.\n\nPrincess Bubblegum is the current incarnation of the Candy Elemental, comparable to the inhabitants of the Candy Kingdom, who are all composed of types of desserts and candies. She rules over the Candy Kingdom, but in the Season 6 episode \"Hot Diggity Doom\" (the first part of the season's finale), an election was held and she lost to the King of Ooo by a landslide. As a result, she no longer ruled the Candy Kingdom and the King of Ooo replaced her as the new ruler, until a rebellion against King of Ooo allowed her to reclaim the throne in \"The Dark Cloud\".\n\nOn the Cartoon Network official website in 2010, Jake referred to Princess Bubblegum as \"a horrible mutant mix of bubblegum and human DNA.\" The validity of this hasn't been confirmed, but in the video game \"\" Princess Bubblegum explains that she was part of a sentient pink goo that was formed about one thousand years ago, and achieved sentience upon being spat out, with her current form being 827 years old. It is unclear how much of this story is canon to the cartoon show, but seeing as how in the episode \"Bonnie and Neddy\" it is revealed that she came from a pink, gum-like substance known as the \"Mother Gum,\" the basis of this information seems to coincide with the shows mythos.\n\nIn the season 7 episode \"Elemental,\" Princess Bubblegum was revealed to be the current Candy Elemental (in the \"Adventure Time\" universe, the Elementals are the embodiments of the four main elements that make up the world: ice, fire, candy and slime. They have existed since the beginning of life, living, dying and reincarnating for eons and millennia). \n\nWhile Princess Bubblegum is typically kind, good-hearted and well-mannered, she can be very temperamental—her temper can be a powerful force when provoked. She is also a rational thinker with skepticism towards magic. Her proficiency in science and fluency in Korean and German are a testament to her high intelligence. In the season 4 episode \"Goliad\", after the events in \"Mortal Recoil\" she begins to feel very vulnerable, and makes a clone-Sphinx of herself named Goliad. She also begins exhibiting strong authoritarian behavior, as she starts spying on all her subjects, and begins taking more assertive actions from then onwards.\n\nPrincess Bubblegum has light pink skin, long magenta-pink \"bubblegum\" hair and usually dresses in a puffy-sleeved flowing dark pink gown with pink trim at the sleeve, purple trim at the scoop-neck collar. When ever she does any science experiments, she wears a lab coat, with her hair often tied, either up in a bun or a ponytail, otherwise let out like in her formal outfit. Usually, she wears something different than her original gown from episode-to-episode and her hair is commonly seen in different styles\n\n\nShe is the former love interest of the protagonist, Finn, and while the two are friends she never showed any real attraction to him, due to the age difference. During the time she is 13 in the episode \"Too Young\", she is presented as having a crush on him. After Finn got a new girlfriend, Flame Princess, his feelings for her seem to have faded, and Finn becomes angry with Princess Bubblegum when she informs Finn the two have to break up (Finn thinks she is doing it out of jealousy; when actually it is because, for Flame Princess, the act of falling in love can destroy the Earth). In some episodes, however, it is suggested Finn may still have feelings for Princess Bubblegum (as in the episode \"King Worm\" he dreams that they are married). \n\nIn an interview, Olivia Olsen (who voices Marceline) stated that Marceline and Bubblegum are ex-girlfriends. This would explain the hostility between them in earlier episodes. Olsen claimed to be informed of this by Pendleton Ward, the creator of \"Adventure Time\", although Ward never confirmed this. Throughout the series, the two have grown closer; in \"Take Her Back\", the sixth episode of the \"Stakes\" miniseries, Princess Bubblegum even refers to Marceline as her \"best friend\". In the series finale \"Come Along with Me\", Marceline and Bubblegum share their first onscreen kiss, confirming mutual romantic feelings between them.\n\nPrincess Bubblegum has a genderswapped version of herself in the 61st episode, Fionna and Cake, who was Prince \"Bubba\" Gumball. In that episode it is revealed that the characters only exist in fanfiction written by the Ice King. Like Princess Bubblegum, Prince Gumball also has his own loyal companion, Lord Monochromicorn. Just as Princess Bubblegum can understand Lady's Korean, Prince Gumball can understand Lord Monochromicorn's Morse code. Prince Gumball has shown romantic feelings for Fionna, but that was actually the Ice Queen in disguise. However, the real Prince Gumball also shows feelings for Fionna and had actually asked her out on a date.\n\nThe third season episode \"What Was Missing\" became controversial because of an allegedly implied past relationship between Marceline and Princess Bubblegum. The controversy largely began after an accompanying \"Mathematical\" recap—a behind the scenes video series produced by Frederator Studios that implied that there were lesbian relations between Princess Bubblegum and Marceline and that the writing staff actively seeks input from fans. This incident was addressed by Fred Seibert, the show's executive producer, who said that \"in trying to get the show's audience involved we got wrapped up by both fan conjecture and spicy fanart and went a little too far.\" Soon after, the video recap and the entire channel was pulled off of YouTube, although \"What Was Missing\" still airs during reruns. Seibert's decision to remove the video also proved controversial; \"Bitch\" magazine later wrote an article about how the episode \"handled female desire—female queer desire at that—in a subtle but complex way\", but that the removal of the recap and the studio's perceived treatment of the controversy was detrimental towards the acceptance of queer romance in children's television. Ward later addressed the issue and gave a more neutral view; he said that, because there were \"so many extreme positions taken on it all over the Internet\", he did not \"really want to comment on it [because] it was a big hullaballoo.\"\n\nIn August 2014, Olivia Olson, the voice of Marceline, told a crowd of fans gathered at a Barnes & Noble book signing from \"The Adventure Time Encyclopedia\", that Marceline and Princess Bubblegum had dated in the past, but that because the series airs in some areas where homosexual relationships are illegal, the show has not been able to officially make clear the relationship in the series itself. Olsen seemed to redact the statement in a Tweet that same day by stating \"I like to make things up at panels. Ya'll take my stories way too seriously\". However that tweet has since been deleted so it is now unclear whether or not her statement was true. \n\nDuring the final episode \"Come Along with Me\" Bubblebum and Marceline's relationship was finally confirmed with them being seen kissing before defeating GOLB.\n\n"}
{"id": "40800345", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=40800345", "title": "Programming ethics", "text": "Programming ethics\n\nThis article gives an overview of professional ethics as applied to computer programming and software development, in particular the ethical guidelines that developers are expected to follow and apply when writing programming code (also called source code), and when they are part of a programmer-customer or employee-employer relationship. These rules shape and differentiate good practices and attitudes from the wrong ones when creating software or when making decisions on a crucial or delicate issue regarding a programming project. They are also the basis for ethical decision-making skills in the conduct of professional work.\n\nThe American scholar Norbert Wiener, professor of Mathematics and Engineering at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, was the first person to set the basis for a new type of \nEthics in the mid 1940s. He noticed that the innovations and advances in science and technology, along with the fast-growing computer industry, were leading to the appearance of this type of Ethics that he named “cybernetics” (from the Greek word for the pilot of a ship). The emerging use of computers and other technologies were bringing up new ethical issues that needed to be analyzed carefully using new ethical guidelines.\n\nWiener wrote three books that lay down a foundation to a new division of Ethics after World War II ended. The books were Cybernetics (1948), The Human Use of Human Beings (1950) and God and Golem, Inc. (1963). Even though he never saw himself creating a new area of Ethics, Wiener gave detailed examples where some ethical and social issues and implications, which were generated by the use of computers, could be identified. However, his ideas were not taken seriously by other scholars because they considered him an eccentric scientist that fantasized about Ethics (Bynum).\n\nIn 1976, a new term regarding Ethics, named “computer ethics,” was proposed by Walter Maner based on the ideas and principles of Norbert Wiener. Maner felt it was necessary to have a field of Ethics for the computer industry just as the medical and business industries had at that moment. Maner also defined that field as one that “studies ethical problems aggravated, transformed or created by computer technology” (Bynum), and he even designed a computer ethics course that could be imparted to university students.\n\nIn the early 1990s, Donald Gotterbarn claimed that computer ethics should be considered as professional ethics that could have the power to lead towards the development and advancement of standards of good practice and codes of conduct for computing professionals (Bynum). He worked with several professional-ethics advocates to write ethical guidelines for creating codes of Ethics. He formed part of the creation of Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct, adopted by the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) in 1992, and Software Engineering Code of Ethics and Professional Practice, adopted by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) and the ACM as well. These codes also include Programming Ethics principles.\n\nThe Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) is the world’s largest educational and scientific computing society. It has its own Code of Ethics and another set of ethical principles that were also approved by the IEEE as the standard for teaching and practicing software engineering. These codes are Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct and the Software Engineering Code of Ethics and Professional Practice, respectively, and some of their guidelines are presented below:\n\nFrom the Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct (ACM):\n\n\nFrom Software Engineering Code of Ethics and Professional Practice (IEEE, ACM):\n\n\nUniversity indirectly helps to form software developers that will follow programming ethics. According to Dr. Stephen Blythe, computer science professor at Lindenwood University, the Computer Science department of this university has made a goal to encourage students in classes to put in practice good conducts when programming. He adds that the application of ethical guidelines might not be clearly visible during the first years of the computer science career. However, “as students get to be a senior in this field, there is more information about programming ethics principles that is conveyed to them because it will be useful when they go out to the business world” (Blythe).\n\nOhio University also trains their computer science majors on the field of programming ethics. They expect every student to adhere to ACM’s principles and responsibilities before getting to programming. It is also needed that the students fully comprehend and follow those guidelines (World of Programming).\n\nBreaking any of the guidelines established on IEEE and ACM’s Codes of Ethics or other codes will result in an immediate termination of the membership to the correspondent professional associations. Moreover, Dr. Stephen Blythe expresses that a programmer who commits any violation of the Code of Ethics can also be prosecuted to US laws because of the implicit relationship programming ethics have with business laws, agreements, contracts, etc. Harm generated to third parties is punishable in the US legal system.\n\nIntentionally making mistakes like creating insecure passwords, or leaving security holes in the implementation of a program that could put on risk the system’s security and reliability exposes the programmer to trial (Savage). The specific sanctions that might result from a programming-related legal dispute will vary from one state to another. Sanctions may vary from corrective actions, to a certain number of hours of social work, or to months or years in jail.\n\n\n"}

The process of creating a reborn doll is referred to as reborning and the doll artists are referred to as reborners.\nReborn dolls are also known as \"lifelike dolls\" or \"reborn baby dolls\".\n\nThe hobby of creating reborn baby dolls began around 1995 when doll enthusiasts wanted more realistic dolls. Since then, an industry surrounding reborn dolls has emerged.\nReborn dolls are primarily purchased on the internet but are available at fairs. Depending on craftsmanship, they range in price from hundreds to thousands of dollars.\n\nReborning involves numerous time consuming steps. The most basic form of the process involves taking a vinyl doll, adding multiple hand painted layers of paint, and adding other physical features to the doll. Artists can pick different brands to best suit the doll they wish to create. Reborn artists can also buy reborn doll kits that are sculpted by reborn sculpt artists. A kit includes the vinyl doll parts. Customers can then purchase a reborn doll by choosing a kit (name) by sculptor (name) and have it reborned by a reborn artist (name) e.g. Adam by Mary reborned by Ann. Consumers can purchase a wide range of supplies for creating their own reborn. Making a doll from a kit allows artists to omit some steps in the fabrication process and begin with a blank canvas. Many supplies are needed for both external and internal modifications of reborns to make the doll seem more realistic.\n\nSome consumers of reborn dolls use them to replace a child they once lost, or a child that has grown up. Others collect reborns as they would regular dolls. These dolls are sometimes played with as if they are an infant. Critics debate whether reborn dolls are harmful, or whether these dolls can help in the grieving process. Because of their realistic appearance, reborn dolls have occasionally been mistaken for real babies and \"rescued\" from parked cars after being reported to the police by passers-by.\n\nThe craft of making reborn dolls began in the United States in the late 1990s. Reborning follows a long tradition of collectors, artists, and manufacturers restoring and enhancing dolls in order to portray more realism. The internet has allowed doll artists and collectors to create an online society focused on reborn dolls. In 2002, the first reborn was offered on eBay. This has expanded the reborn market allowing artists to open online stores which function figuratively as nurseries. The niche market for the dolls began with doll collectors who admired the superior lifelike accuracy of the doll. The market quickly reached those who wanted to use the doll as an emotional outlet, either to mother or for therapeutic purposes. Mass media coverage has helped to develop the phenomenon in other countries. Reborning enjoys popularity in the United Kingdom and Australia, but has also reached Canada, the rest of Europe, Africa, and Latin America. Doll manufacturers have also taken advantage of the trend and sell supplies, tools, and accessories catering to reborn followers. This has allowed reborners to invent new techniques causing the dolls to become increasingly realistic over time. Magazines, books, organizations, and conventions dedicated to reborn dolls have been started as a result of this popularity.\n\nThe appearance of the doll depends on the creator; however, certain reborn artists allow customers to customize their doll, usually using a photograph to replicate a particular infant.\n\nAny type of vinyl doll can be used for reborning. Dolls vary by size, shape, and materials, making some more desirable or popular than others. According to \"Doll Reader Magazine\", Berenguer Babies, Zapf, Lee Middleton, Ashton-Drake Galleries, Apple Valley, and Secrist Dolls are doll companies that make dolls which are easy to transform into reborns. Kathryn Peck of \"Doll Reader Magazine\" explains that with JC Toys Berenguer Babies, it is because the dolls already resemble human babies in their expressions, body shapes, surface materials, and other lifelike attributes. Ashton Drake uses a trademark vinyl for their outer skin. Almost all the Ashton-Drake dolls are created using a theme based marketing line. \"Preemies\" are smaller dolls molded after premature infants. Between \"preemie\" and regular dolls, sizes can range from 4 inches to Child size.\n\nIf a reborn is created from a kit as opposed to whole manufactured doll, it may be called newborning. Manufacturers have reacted to the growing trend of artists transforming dolls by hiring reborn artists to become doll sculptors and design doll molds and kits. When newborning from a kit, the first several steps of the process are completed by reborn sculpt artists and doll manufacturers. The kits come with an already disassembled baby and select supplies. Other supplies not provided in the kit can be purchased separately. The Secrist doll company started making Reborn Doll Kits in 2005. In 2009, they began producing supplies, tools, and tutorial videos specifically for reborning or newborning. JC Toys began selling kits in December 2007 Other suppliers offer product lines that give reborners a choice of body parts and skin tones to make a customized doll.\n\nStarter kits are equipped with basic reborning necessities such as limbs, faces, heads, paint brushes, eyelashes, weighting pellets, 'heat set' or air dry paints, cloth bodies, cable ties, nose drill bits, fake tears, thinning shears, cosmetic foam wedges, cotton dipped applicators, and glue These supplies may be purchased separately from a variety of retailers. The nose drill bits are used for creating and perfecting the nostrils of the doll. Acetone or a paint thinner medium is needed for removing the factory paint from the doll. Hair is an optional choice to add to a doll. Fine mohair, human hair, or wigs are usually used, but it is found in a variety of types. Rooting tools are utilized for this process and are available in numerous sizes 20,36,38, 40, and 42. The smaller the number the thicker the needle which will grab more hair and leave a bigger hole in the head of the doll. Eyes for a reborn doll are offered in a variety of brands and sizes.\n\nThe technique of reborning a play doll typically involves a number of steps. To begin the doll is taken apart and factory paint is removed. Then a blue color wash may be applied to give the appearance of realistic baby skin undertones. For dolls with an awake appearance eyes must be replaced. The outer layer of the vinyl doll is given its skin tone by adding dozens of layers of flesh colored paint. If heat set paints are used, the doll parts must be heat set by baking them inside an oven or by using a heatgun after each layer of paint is applied. Lighter skin tone dolls can take 15 to 30 layers. The effects of the blue color wash combined with the outside layers of paint creates the appearance of veins, and gives the doll its newborn mottled look. Manicured nails and opening of the nose holes are other details that are added during this process. There are air dry paints now available to reborn artists, sold under several brand names. Many feel that repeated baking of vinyl can cause it to break down over time. In addition, there are fumes and chemicals released during the heating process.\n\nThe next step is to apply hair. The hair can either be done in one of two ways; wigging, rooting or microrooting. when rooting hair is added 1–4 hair strands per plug. When microrooting, hair is added strand by strand. This can take up to 30 or more hours per head. Once the hair is finished, the original vinyl body is weighted with a soft stuffed body filled with pellets/fine glass beads/fiberfill.The weight corresponds with its age to achieve a real effect. Various additions also can be added to give the doll an even more life like appearance. Reborns heads are often weighted, so that owners have to support the head like one would a real newborn. Purchasers can have magnets attached inside the mouth or head for attaching a pacifier or hair bows. Electronic devices that mimic a heart beat, or make the chest rise and fall to simulate breathing are common. Reborns can come with an umbilical cord, baby fat, heat packs to make the reborn warm to the touch, or voice boxes that mimic infant sounds. For preemie dolls, they may come in incubators with a breathing apparatus attached to their nose.\n\nInstitutions have developed to aid reborn hobbyists with collecting by providing information, products, and social networking. These institutions include magazines, and associations and organizations which sponsor conferences and conventions. Collectors and artists have described their reasons for purchasing and/or creating reborn dolls as varying from a love of dolls to a passion for art.\n\nReborn dolls are usually found online and can be purchased through eBay, artists' online stores (often termed nurseries), and conventions/fairs. Incomplete crafting \"kits\" to create original reborns can also be purchased from various online stores. There is a large price range depending on the quality of the doll, the sculpt used and the experience of the artist, they can sell anywhere from hundreds to thousands of dollars. There are many factors to look for when purchasing a reborn. If the complexion is too dark this is called a blue baby, and indicates it was dyed excessively or uses colored sand for weight that could have seeped into the vinyl. The type of material used to weight the reborn should be considered because some materials do not react well with vinyl and will cause it to deteriorate. The doll should not be shiny. This indicates the doll was washed with acetone before painting, which prevents the color from correctly sticking to the doll's surface. It may also be caused by the type of paint used to color the doll. This is corrected with a special matte varnish. The parts used are important, as original parts may be replaced. The replacement parts must be appropriately proportioned with the doll and made of quality material. At times having the original body retains the doll's value either because it was made to fit that specific doll, or the artist left a signature mark. Eye brand, size, fitting, and alignment should be closely examined. Another feature to observe is the type of paint used for coloring and whether the doll is realistic in its details such as veins and newborn imperfections. The type of hair and technique used in applying the hair may determine the quality. Some artists open the nose, the holes should be correctly shaped, and the nails should be properly manicured.\n\nThe International Reborn Doll Artists (IRDA) originated at the first conference for reborn doll artists on January 21, 2005. The IRDA group was assembled in order to offer education for improved skills in the art of reborn doll creation. They offer skill building tutorials and instruction so reborners can remain up to date on the newest techniques and meet others who share a common interest in reborn doll fabrication. A reborn artist can join the organization at any skill level, but members are asked to uphold a list of standards that were created by the IRDA's executive board. This ethical code stipulates the guidelines members are to follow in advertising, listing, and describing their dolls in order to divide credit fairly between manufacturers, sculptors, and artists.\n\nThe First Annual International Reborn Doll Artists Conference was held in Orlando, Florida on January 21–23, 2005 in conjunction with IDEX The Annual Debut of the World's Finest Collectibles. In January 2006 in Las Vegas, Nevada, \"Doll Reader Magazine\" sponsored the IDEX Reborn Competition at the First International IDEX Reborn Convention. \"Doll Reader Magazine\" started publishing over twenty-five years ago. It is now published nine times a year, keeps collectors informed on trends of modern-day doll collecting, and continues to sponsor the IDEX trade shows that feature reborn competitions and conventions. In the summer of 2008, ABC News followed a reborn convention in Illinois. ABC News was also in St. Louis, Missouri to attend the first annual Tiny Treasures Show held in 2008. The show features exhibitors, collectors, retailers, manufacturers, workshops, and contests for reborners. Reborn dolls can be found at doll fairs as well.\n\nThe overwhelming majority of reborn customers are older women. The process of buying a reborn can be done to simulate an adoption process, rather than a prosaic sale of a product. As part of this, the dolls often come with fake birth certificates or adoption certificates. Many women collect reborns as they would a non-reborn doll, whilst others purchase them to fill a void of a lost child and may treat reborns as living babies. Media features and public receptions have used such adjectives as \"creepy\" to describe the reborns. This can be explained by the uncanny valley hypothesis. This states that as objects become more lifelike they gain an increasing empathetic response, until a certain point at which the response changes to repulsion. Department stores have refused to stock the dolls because of this reaction, claiming they are too lifelike.\n\nMany reborn owners are simply doll collectors, while others have experienced miscarriage, stillbirth or neonatal loss, have no means for adoption, or suffer from empty nest syndrome. They may utilize the dolls as a substitute for a child. Some owners dress the dolls, wash their hair, and may even take them for walks in strollers and take them shopping. Reborn hobbyists refer to the emotional response to holding their dolls as \"cuddle therapy\". Studies suggest cuddling a baby causes a release of hormones which produce a sense of emotional well-being, and some psychologists believe that this may happen with realistic dolls as well. Consultant psychiatrist Raj Persaud explains that mothering a real newborn baby releases the hormone oxytocin in the mother, and hypothesizes that this may explain why \"reborn mothers\" become emotionally attached to the reborn baby doll.\n\nFor grieving parents who form emotional bonds with reborn dolls, some child bereavement counselors advise against parents substituting their deceased child with the dolls. Reborn mothers contend that they are not replacing children but remembering them. Psychiatrist Sue Varma, teacher at the NYU school of medicine, says mothering reborn dolls rather than just collecting them can become a problem when it is used as prop and becomes the person's only form of socializing. Psychiatrist Gail Saltz with New York Presbyterian Hospital supports the use of reborns for people who do not want to make the commitment of having a real child, and also to comfort bereaved parents. She offers that in this case the reborn may symbolize a step in the grieving process. Concern should only come if someone who lost a baby grows too attached to their reborn because it could indicate their grief is not getting resolved. In this case, the likeness of the doll to the deceased child risks being harmful as a permanent replacement for the grieving parents. Ian James, a doctor at the Centre for the Health of the Elderly at Newcastle General Hospital in the U.K., said that holding the dolls helps calm elderly residents, helping them feel peaceful and quiet.\n\nReborn dolls look so real they have been mistaken for real babies. In July 2008, police in Queensland, Australia smashed a car window to rescue what seemed like an unconscious baby only to find it was a reborn doll. The police stated that the doll was \"incredibly lifelike\" and that bystanders who thought a baby was dying were frightened by the incident. A similar incident was reported in the United States, in which police broke the window of a Hummer to save a baby that turned out to be a reborn doll.\n\nIn 2009 reborners uncovered a blogging hoax in which a woman–described by \"ABC News\" as an \"anti-abortion blogger\"–claimed she was pregnant with a terminally ill child. She opened a P.O. box in order to receive gifts, money, and prayers. The hoax was uncovered when reborners reading the blog realized that the pictures of the baby posted on the blog were actually a reborn doll that they recognized through the familiar reborn sculpture.\n\nReborn dolls have been featured in a number of television shows. A December 10, 2008 episode of \"Dr. Phil\" entitled \"Obsessions\" discussed the topic of reborning. In January 2008, a Channel 4 series, \"My Fake Baby\", explored the lives of women who collect the lifelike baby dolls. Featuring this documentary the British television magazine show on Channel 4, Richard & Judy, held an interview with the reborn artist in the documentary, Jaime Eaton, collector Mary Flint and psychiatrist Raj Persuad. On January 2, 2009, an ABC News article described both the manufacturing and the emotional interaction of reborn dolls, while a January 2 \"20/20\" episode talked about the mothering process and attachment to reborns. On January 31, 2008, Inside Edition aired a segment showing artist Eve Newsom and her reborn dolls. In July 2014, an episode of Perception, an American fictional series about a neuropsychiatrist who helps solve murders, called \"Inconceivable\" was all about a real baby and a reborn. In December 2015, Shaylen Maxwell, owner & artist of Reborn, Sweet was featured in The Globe and Mail, in a LIFE feature on the therapeutic value of reborn dolls in treating anxiety and grief.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "55867424", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=55867424", "title": "Residual neural network", "text": "Residual neural network\n\nA residual neural network is an artificial neural network (ANN) of a kind that builds on constructs known from pyramidal cells in the cerebral cortex. Residual neural networks do this by utilizing \"skip connections\" or \"short-cuts\" to jump over some layers. In its limit as \"ResNets\" it will only skip over a single layer. With an additional weight matrix to learn the skip weights it is referred to as \"HighwayNets\". With several parallel skips it is referred to as \"DenseNets\". In comparison, a non-residual neural network is described as a \"plain network\" in the context of residual neural networks.\nThe brain has structures similar to residual nets, as cortical layer VI neurons gets input from layer I, skipping over all intermediary layers. In the figure (below, on the right), this compares to signals from the (3) apical dendrite skipping over layers, while the (2) basal dendrite collecting signals from the previous and/or same layer. Similar structures exists for other layers. How many layers in the cerebral cortex compare to layers in an artificial neural network is not clear, neither if every area in cerebral cortex exhibits the same structure, but over large areas they look quite similar.\n\nOne motivation for skipping over layers in ANNs is to avoid the problem of vanishing gradients by reusing activations from a previous layer until the layer next to the current one have learned its weights. During training the weights will adapt to mute the previous layer and amplify the layer next to the current. In the simplest case only the weights for the connection to the next to the current layer is adapted, with no explicit weights for the upstream previous layer. This usually works properly when a single non-linear layer is stepped over, or in the case when the intermediate layers are all linear. If not, then an explicit weight matrix should be learned for the skipped connection.\n\nThe intuition on why this works is that the neural network collapses into fewer layers in the initial phase, which makes it easier to learn, and thus gradually expands the layers as it learns more of the feature space. During later learning, when all layers are expanded, it will stay closer to the manifold and thus learn faster. A neural network without residual parts will explore more of the feature space. This makes it more vulnerable to small perturbations that cause it to leave the manifold altogether, and require extra training data to get back on track.\n\nFor single skips, the layers may be indexed either as formula_1 to formula_2 or as formula_2 to formula_4. (Script formula_2 used for clarity, usually it is written as a simple \"l\".) The two indexing systems are convenient when describing skips as going backward or forward. As signal flows forward through the network it is easier to describe the skip as formula_6 from a given layer, but as a learning rule (back propagation) it is easier to describe which activation layer you reuse as formula_7, where formula_8 is the skip number.\n\nIf there is a weight matrix formula_9for connection weights from layer formula_10 to formula_2, and a weight matrix formula_12 for connection weights from layer formula_1 to formula_2, then the forward propagation through the activation function would be (aka \"HighwayNets\")\nwhere we have\n\nIf there is no explicit matrix formula_12 (aka \"ResNets\"), then the forward propagation through the activation function simplifies to\nAnother way to formulate this is to substitute an identity matrix for formula_12, but that is only valid when the dimensions match. This is somewhat confusingly called an \"identity block\", which means that the activations from layer formula_1 are passed to layer formula_2 without a weight matrix.\n\nIn the cerebral cortex such forward skips are done for several layers. Usually all forward skips start from the same layer, and successively connect to later layers. In the general case this will be expressed as (aka \"DenseNets\")\n\nDuring backpropagation learning for the normal path\nand for the skip paths (note that they are close to identical)\nIn both cases we have\nIf the skip path has fixed weights (e.g. the identity matrix, see above), then they will not be updated. If they can be updated, then the rule will be an ordinary backprop update rule.\n\nIn the general case there can be formula_38 skip path weight matrices, thus\n\nAs the learning rules are similar the weight matrices can be merged and learned in the same step.\n\n"}
{"id": "1580022", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1580022", "title": "Richard Lancelyn Green", "text": "Richard Lancelyn Green\n\nRichard Gordon Lancelyn Green (10 July 1953 – 27 March 2004) was a British scholar of Arthur Conan Doyle and Sherlock Holmes, generally considered the world's foremost scholar of these topics.\n\nLancelyn Green was born in Bebington, Cheshire, England, the younger son of Roger Lancelyn Green and June, daughter of Sidney Herbert Burdett. His father was an author known for his popular adaptations of the Arthurian, Robin Hood and Homeric myths, and his mother was a drama teacher and adjudicator. The Lancelyn Green family had been lords of the manor of Poulton-Lancelyn in Cheshire since at least 1093; Randle Greene (sic) had married Elizabeth, daughter and heiress of William Lancelyn, in the reign of Elizabeth I.\n\nLancelyn Green attended Bradfield College in Berkshire, and then University College, Oxford, where he earned a degree in English. \nAfter leaving college, he travelled extensively, throughout Europe, India and South-east Asia.\n\nLancelyn Green was a collector of Sherlock Holmes-related material, and was co-editor of the first comprehensive bibliography of Arthur Conan Doyle, \"A Bibliography of A. Conan Doyle\", with John Michael Gibson, and also a series of collections of Doyle's writings that had never before been collected in book form: \"Uncollected Stories\" (1982), \"Essays on Photography\" (1982), and \"Letters to the Press\" (1986), all co-edited with Gibson. The Conan Doyle bibliography earned Lancelyn Green and Gibson a Special Edgar Award from the Mystery Writers of America during 1984.\n\nLancelyn Green also published other books on his own. \"The Uncollected Sherlock Holmes\" (1983) anthologised Doyle's non-canon Sherlock Holmes writings, \"The Further Adventures of Sherlock Holmes\" (1985) is a collection of Holmes pastiches and parodies, and \"Letters to Sherlock Holmes\" (1985) collected the most interesting of letters to Sherlock Holmes, arriving at the headquarters of the Abbey National Building Society, whose address in Baker Street was the closest to the fictional \"221b\".\n\nLancelyn Green was something of a showman, appearing as a 19th-century music hall master of ceremonies at events of the Sherlock Holmes Society, of which he was chairman from 1996 to 1999, and dressing in period costume to visit Reichenbach Falls, where Sherlock Holmes was thought to have died until Conan Doyle \"resurrected\" him eight years later. For his encyclopaedic knowledge of Arthur Conan Doyle and Sherlock Holmes, and for his scholarly works, he was well regarded among scholars of Holmes.\n\nLater in life, Lancelyn Green worked extensively on notes and collecting material for a planned three-volume biography of Conan Doyle, which remained unfinished at the time of his death. He lamented the legal wranglings needed to gain rights to Conan Doyle's private papers and manuscripts, which were planned to be sold at an auction.\n\nDuring August 2004, it was announced that Lancelyn Green had bequeathed his extensive collection on Conan Doyle to the Portsmouth Library Service. Lancelyn Green had chosen the city because Conan Doyle had a medical practice there, and it was where the two first Sherlock Holmes books were written.\n\nAs early as the age of seven years, Lancelyn Green began his collection of Sherlockiana, and created his version of 221b Baker Street in an attic room at Poulton Hall, gleaning material for a few shillings at junk shops and from the family's own Victoriana. Later he began to assemble his literary collection, and would add any edition of Doyle's output, as well as posters, ephemera and novelty items with a Sherlock Holmes theme or Doyle association.\n\nBy the date of his death Lancelyn Green had been collecting voraciously for more than 40 years and without doubt possessed the largest collection of Doyleiana that existed privately (and probably the largest such collection that ever could exist now that it has been bequeathed to the City of Portsmouth). The collection is now held by the Portsmouth City Museum where exhibitions have created much interest. The patron of the collection is Stephen Fry.\n\nLancelyn Green suspected that the Conan Doyle papers being auctioned at Christie's were part of a collection that Dame Jean Conan Doyle, the author's daughter, actually wanted the British Library to have. He attempted to stop the auction, but was unsuccessful.\n\nIn the weeks before his death, he told friends and journalists that an unidentified American was following him, and that he feared his opposition to the auction could endanger his life. His behaviour became increasingly erratic, and once he insisted on speaking to a visitor in the garden because he said his apartment was bugged.\n\nDuring the night of his death, his sister telephoned his apartment, obtaining only his answering machine, which had a new message with an American voice (this was found later to be the standard message tape supplied with the machine). Her worries about this resulted in the discovery of Lancelyn Green's body, face down on his bed, garrotted with a shoelace that had been tightened with the handle of a wooden spoon.\n\nMurder was suspected, and there was some newspaper gossip. Because the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) was not called at the start, any evidence that might have been useful for a murder enquiry had been disturbed or removed during the course of dealing with the body. \n\nThe Coroner returned an open verdict. Many of Lancelyn Green's best friends thought it was not in his nature to commit suicide. However, some thought the death to have been an elaborate suicide, intended to seem like murder, to cast suspicion upon one of his rivals. This replicates the plot of one of the last Sherlock Holmes mysteries, \"The Problem of Thor Bridge\", in which a woman commits suicide in a manner meant to implicate the woman with whom her husband had been flirting.\n\nLancelyn Green's bizarre death later inspired two novels that deal with a fictional Holmes expert who dies in exactly the same manner as Lancelyn Green. Those books are \"The Art of Detection\" (2006) by Laurie R. King and \"The Sherlockian\" (2010) by Graham Moore. Each novel's plot not only features a Holmes expert but a missing Doyle manuscript and each explores the possibility of suicide disguised as murder as was suspected in Lancelyn Green's death.\n\n"}
{"id": "12330887", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12330887", "title": "Romulus (comics)", "text": "Romulus (comics)\n\nRomulus is a fictional comic book supervillain appearing in books published by Marvel Comics, in particular those featuring Wolverine. He is the leader of the Lupines, a species resembling humans that he claims evolved from canines instead of primates through convergent evolution. He is a shadowy character whose origin and motives remain a mystery. He is shown to have orchestrated most major events in the life of Wolverine, manipulating and controlling him for most of his life.\n\nCreated by writer Jeph Loeb and artist Simone Bianchi, the character first appeared obscured by shadow in \"Wolverine\" vol. 3 #50 (March 2007), and made his first full appearance in \"\" #39 (August 2009).\n\nRomulus is first seen in several flashbacks that Wolverine experiences, later explained by Wild Child to have been induced by Romulus himself. He is shown leading the Lupines in prehistoric and barbaric times, being an emperor in Ancient Rome, as well as being the main force behind Weapon X.\n\nIn the present, Romulus restored Feral and Thornn's feline look after their depowerment on M-Day, augmented Wild Child's powers greatly, and seemed to have erased all humanity from Sabretooth causing the latter's death at the hands of Wolverine (later it was revealed Sabretooth was a clone). Romulus did all of this to reveal himself to Wolverine.\n\nRomulus was also the one who took Daken from his dead mother's womb and raised him as a ruthless killer. Nick Fury revealed to Wolverine that Romulus has been manipulating people from his family's bloodline for centuries, and that he plans for Daken to become the next-generation Weapon X. This was achieved through Tinkerer who bonded the metal from the Muramasa blade to Daken's inner claws. Daken hinted he complied with the process because of his own agenda. Romulus told Daken to kill all the Weapon X experiments that gave them a healing factor with his Muramasa claws. He killed every one except Deadpool.\n\nHe appears to have ties with Russian authorities, arranging Omega Red's transfer to a regular Russian prison to set a trap for Wolverine. After Wolverine temporarily subdues Omega Red, he is captured by Wild Child, who reveals that Romulus made Logan and several villains battle each other, his agenda being vaguely described as him needing a successor. Moments after Wolverine uses the Muramasa blade to kill Omega Red, Romulus reveals himself in front of him, prepared for battle with four claws already extended (the three between the knuckles of his fingers and one extending from behind his thumb). Wolverine attacks Romulus but is easily overpowered since he is only using the sword at this point. Romulus slashes and attacks Wolverine from the shadows as he reveals his plans. Telling Wolverine that everything has led up to this moment. Romulus is what Wolverine will become. Pushing Wolverine to the breaking point, he drops the sword and pops his claws, much to Romulus' amusement. However, Wolverine fights back and gains the upper hand and slashes at Romulus' hand, shattering what turned out to be a clawed gauntlet. Seeing that Romulus' claws are fake, Wolverine taunts him saying, \"You're not what I'm gonna become... I'm what you've always wanted to be\". Hearing this, Romulus blindly attacks Wolverine with his remaining claws only to be slashed open by Wolverine. Seemingly beaten, Romulus tells Wolverine that although he is at the top of the food chain, by making Daken in his own image, he has set the stage for a confrontation between Wolverine and his son. Only the most ruthless will survive. Only the one most like Romulus. Wolverine defeats Romulus, but leaves him alive saying that he will return when he is ready to finish the job. As Wolverine turns his back, Romulus seizes the opportunity to knock Wolverine unconscious with his own sword. Romulus then leaves, but not before telling Wolverine to keep the Muramasa blade: he will need it. After his confrontation with Wolverine he coordinates a successful assassination in Tokyo from what seems to be his base of operations, a European-style castle. It is here that Romulus first begins to doubt his own understanding of Wolverine's actions.\n\nWolverine decides to confront Romulus one last time, using the help of various other heroes and his son Daken. In the end, as Daken is about to kill Romulus, Logan has Cloak teleport him into the Dark Force dimension. For a second Wolverine thinks he should behead Romulus, just like he did with Creed, but in the end he decides to leave him stranded in the Dark Force dimension.\n\nHowever, thanks to Sabretooth's blackmailing life of Dagger, Romulus gets free from his prison. After a losing fight against Romulus, a mysterious woman with long red hair appears and tells Wolverine that the answers that he seeks are at the Weapon X facility. Following his fight with the Sabretooth clones, the mysterious woman appears to Wolverine again. She calls herself Remus and informs him that Romulus is her twin brother. She aids Wolverine in his struggle against Romulus and Sabretooth all while providing Wolverine with information about Romulus. She reveals to Wolverine that Romulus' claim about certain mutants evolving from canines rather than apes (referring to the Lupine) is untrue which Wolverine had long since guessed. She further reveals that the whole \"Lupine Sapiens\" story was all just an elaborate hoax by her brother intended to be a ruse for his real goal of creating a master race of natural mutants artificially enhanced by a new type of adamantium created using vibranium illegally mined from Wakanda, using Wolverine as a template. After tracking Romulus to his stronghold somewhere in Italy, Wolverine brutally attacks and incapacitates Sabretooth before confronting Romulus. Wolverine finds Romulus immersed within a tank very similar to the one Wolverine was held in during the days of the Weapon X Program. Wolverine breaks open the tank and savagely assaults Romulus with his claws. He gouges away much of the right side of Romulus' face, revealing that the bones beneath have been bonded with adamantium. As Romulus heals, Wolverine asks what the purpose is of becoming an imitation of him. Romulus declares that he is not as he once was, as he has \"taken the best from both Wolverine and Sabretooth\", implying that his animal-like powers were artificially copied from Sabretooth (as his twin sister has none of those traits and her only powers shown is a healing-factor). He reveals that he now has four adamantium claws from both his hands in exactly the same configuration he used on the gauntlets he wore. As he launches into his attack, Romulus says to Wolverine that having Romulus erase his memory and bond the adamantium to his skeleton was actually his idea rather than something that he was forced to endure as he's believed for so long (however, this assertion remains ambiguous). Romulus and Wolverine resume their battle with Wolverine ultimately proving victorious, resulting in Romulus being remanded to the Raft.\n\nLittle is known about the full extent of Romulus's powers. As with Wolverine, Romulus' primary power is an accelerated healing factor that allows him to rapidly regenerate damaged or destroyed tissue with far greater speed and efficiency than normal humans. The full limits of this power aren't known, but he has healed wounds that ripped away the flesh from the right side of his face, exposing the bone, within a matter of seconds. Romulus' healing factor also grants him virtual immunity to known diseases and renders him highly resistant to most forms of drugs. It also affords him greatly extended longevity by slowing his natural aging process to an extraordinary degree as he claims to be tens of thousands of years old. However, Romulus is known to mix exaggeration and half truths in order to perpetuate the mystique surrounding him, though Romulus is ancient. Since the appearance of Remus, she has confirmed that Romulus is at least several thousand years of age. While he does show signs of aging, such as his hair turning almost completely white where it was once black, Romulus still has the same physical vitality and overall appearance of his physical prime. Romulus' senses of sight, smell and hearing are also enhanced to unknown superhuman levels. While they constitute a separate power, their efficiency is still somewhat linked to his healing factor. Romulus also possesses some degree of superhuman strength, the limits of which aren't fully known, though it has been shown as sufficient to lift Wolverine by the arm over his head using one hand and hurl him across a room. Romulus' speed, agility, and reflexes are similarly enhanced. His healing factor grants him partial immunity to the fatigue toxins generated by his muscles during physical activity, so he has much greater stamina and endurance than an ordinary human. He can exert himself physically for at least several hours before the buildup of fatigue toxins in his blood begins to impair him. He also possesses a single, retractable claw at the tip of each finger as well as elongated canine teeth. Romulus' claws are extremely sharp and are capable of cutting most known conventional materials and flesh.\n\nRomulus has also displayed some degree of telepathic capabilities during past confrontations with Wolverine. He has been able to enter Wolverine's mind and to manipulate his memories, even going so far as to be able to create false memories or to awaken memories that have been suppressed. However, his telepathic powers are nowhere near the level of Charles Xavier, as Xavier has used his powers to shield Wolverine's mind from Romulus' influence for years.\n\nAfter his return from the Dark Dimension, Romulus underwent the process of bonding adamantium to his skeleton. As a result, his bones are now virtually indestructible. Romulus has also had four adamantium claws implanted into each arm that have the same configuration as the claws mounted onto his gloves. As with his skeleton, these claws are virtually unbreakable and can cut nearly any known substance. \n\nRomulus is consistently depicted as being of exceptional stature, surpassing Sabretooth in size. The font used for his words is unique, having a more ancient appearance than those of other characters. Although he often appears naked, he has been shown to wear clothes on several occasions, possibly making use of the fact that only a few living people can recognize him. Romulus has been seen wearing armor over his right knee which has a faint reminder of the adamantium armor worn by Cyber.\n\nHis facial features are very similar to both Sabretooth and Wolverine. This is seen in his sideburns, canine fangs, pointy ears, and white eyes. His hair is almost solid white with the exception of his bangs, which are black. Romulus has been seen wearing his hair in a long pony tail in a way similar to Omega Red. Romulus also speaks with a unique accent. According to Wolverine, it sounds part Italian and part Japanese.\n\nRomulus is extremely intelligent with detailed knowledge of genetics and other areas of science. Romulus also controls a vast criminal empire spread throughout the world and has contacts throughout the criminal underworld. Romulus is also a master manipulator that prefers to work behind the scenes. He is also a formidable hand-to-hand combatant with many thousands of years of experience and knowledge. He also has extensive knowledge of many foreign and ancient cultures as he has alleged to have participated in the rise and fall of many civilizations throughout his existence.\n\n"}
{"id": "3975854", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3975854", "title": "Sensory neuroscience", "text": "Sensory neuroscience\n\nSensory neuroscience is a subfield of neuroscience which explores the anatomy and physiology of neurons that are part of sensory systems such as vision, hearing, and olfaction. Neurons in sensory regions of the brain respond to stimuli by firing one or more nerve impulses (action potentials) following stimulus presentation. How is information about the outside world encoded by the rate, timing, and pattern of action potentials? This so-called neural code is currently poorly understood and sensory neuroscience plays an important role in the attempt to decipher it. Looking at early sensory processing is advantageous since brain regions that are \"higher up\" (e.g. those involved in memory or emotion) contain neurons which encode more abstract representations. However, the hope is that there are unifying principles which govern how the brain encodes and processes information. Studying sensory systems is an important stepping stone in our understanding of brain function in general. \n\nA typical experiment in sensory neuroscience involves the presentation of a series of relevant stimuli to an experimental subject while the subject's brain is being monitored. This monitoring can be accomplished by noninvasive means such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) or electroencephalography (EEG), or by more invasive means such as electrophysiology, the use of electrodes to record the electrical activity of single neurons or groups of neurons. fMRI measures changes in blood flow which related to the level of neural activity and provides low spatial and temporal resolution, but does provide data from the whole brain. In contrast,\nElectrophysiology provides very high temporal resolution (the shapes of single spikes can be resolved) and data can be obtained from single cells. This is important since computations are performed within the dendrites of individual neurons.\n\nIn most of the central nervous system, neurons communicate exclusively by sending each other action potentials, colloquially known as \"spikes\". It is therefore thought that all of the information a sensory neuron encodes about the outside world can be inferred by the pattern of its spikes. Current experimental techniques cannot measure individual spikes noninvasively.\n\nA typical single neuron experiment will consist of isolating a neuron (that is, navigating the neuron until the experimentor finds a neuron which spikes in response to the type of stimulus to be presented, and (optionally) determining that all of the spikes observed indeed come from a single neuron), then presenting a stimulus protocol. Because neural responses are inherently variable (that is, their spiking pattern may depend on more than just the stimulus which is presented, although not all of this variability may be true noise, since factors other than the presented stimulus may affect the sensory neuron under study), often the same stimulus protocol is repeated many times to get a feel for the variability a neuron may have. One common analysis technique is to study the neuron's average time-varying firing rate, called its post stimulus time histogram or PSTH.\n\nOne major goal of sensory neuroscience is to try to estimate the neuron's receptive field; that is, to try to determine which stimuli cause the neuron to fire in what ways. One common way to find the receptive field is to use linear regression to find which stimulus characteristics typically caused neurons to become excited or depressed. Since the receptive field of a sensory neuron can vary in time (i.e. latency between the stimulus and the effect it has on the neuron) and in some spatial dimension (literally space for vision and somatosensory cells, but other \"spatial\" dimensions such as the frequency of a sound for auditory neurons), the term spatio temporal receptive field or STRF is often used to describe these receptive fields.\n\nOne recent trend in sensory neuroscience has been the adoption of natural stimuli for the characterization of sensory neurons. There is good reason to believe that there has been evolutionary pressure on sensory systems to be able to represent natural stimuli well, so sensory systems may exhibit the most relevant behaviour in response to natural stimuli. The adoption of natural stimuli in sensory neuroscience has been slowed by the fact that the mathematical descriptions of natural stimuli tend to be more complex than of simplified artificial stimuli such as simple tones or clicks in audition or line patterns in vision. Free software is now available to help neuroscientists interested in estimating receptive fields cope with the difficulty of using natural stimuli.\n\nSensory neuroscience is also used as a bottom-up approach to studying consciousness. For example, visual sense and representation has been studied by Crick and Koch (1998), and experiments have been suggested in order to test various hypotheses in this research stream.\n\n"}

It was harpooned in a hunt, but escaped, and was found floating dead off Stonehaven a week later. It was towed into Dundee by a showman, John Woods, and exhibited on a train tour of Scotland and England.\n\nThe Regius Professor of Anatomy at Aberdeen University, John Struthers dissected the whale, much of the time in public with a military band playing in the background, organised by Woods. The decomposing whale made Woods a great deal of money, and Struthers famous.\n\nThe doggerel poet William McGonagall wrote an infamously bad poem about the events.\n\nIn December 1883, a humpback whale appeared in the Firth of Tay off the shore of Dundee, at that time Scotland's major whaling port, and attracted much local interest. The whalers normally hunted in the Arctic, but as the whaling boats were in harbour for the winter, some of the whalers decided to hunt this animal in their own waters.\n\nAfter several failed attempts, they harpooned the humpback on 31 December 1883. It was a strong male, and it towed two rowing boats and two steamboats as far as Montrose and then to the Firth of Forth. After a struggle that lasted all night, the harpoon lines broke and the whale escaped.\n\nA week later the whale was found dead, floating out at sea. It was towed to Stonehaven and dragged onto the beach. John Struthers, the Regius professor of Anatomy at Aberdeen, quickly visited the carcass, recording it as 40 feet long with flukes measuring 11 feet 4 inches. A local entrepreneur, John Woods, bought the whale and had it transported to his yard in Dundee. On the first Sunday that it was there, 12,000 people paid to see it.\nThe local newspaper, the \"Dundee Courier\", published at least 21 stories on the Tay Whale between 12 November 1883 and 11 January 1884. The headlines included:\nFinally on 25 January 1884, when the whale was too badly decomposed for further public exhibition, Struthers was allowed to come and dissect the famous specimen. He was well used to working on stinking carcasses: his dissecting room was reputed to stink \"like the deck of a Greenland whaler\". He had two assistants; but the dissection was disturbed by John Woods, who admitted the public, for a fee, to watch the dissection in progress, while a military band played in the background.\n\nThere were snow showers, but Struthers was able to remove much of the skeleton before Woods had the flesh embalmed; the carcass was then stuffed and sewn up to be taken on a profitable tour as far as Edinburgh and London. Finally on 7 August 1884 Struthers was able to remove the skull and the rest of the skeleton. Struthers eventually wrote seven anatomy articles over the next decade on the whale, and ultimately published a complete monograph on it in 1889, entitled \"Memoir on the Anatomy of the Humpback Whale, Megaptera Longimana\".\n\nIn 2011, the whale's skeleton was displayed in the McManus Galleries in Dundee.\n\nStruthers became popularly famous for his dissection of the Tay Whale, his largest specimen. It was one of a wide range of specimens of many species that he energetically collected to form a museum of zoology, to illustrate Darwin's theories.\n\nThe whale became so famous that the doggerel poet William Topaz McGonagall (1825–1902) wrote a notably bad poem, \"The Famous Tay Whale\", about it. Two of the verses run:\n\nThis was not the only piece of doggerel verse about the whale, as a poet signing himself \"Spectator\" published \"The Whale Interviewed by his Mother on his Exploits in the River Tay\" in the \"Dundee Courier\", with verses such as:\n\n\n\n"}

He worked hard to combat wrongful imprisonment of fellow Quakers.\n\nNothing is known of Aldham's parentage. He farmed successfully at Warmsworth, near Doncaster. In 1644, he married Mary Killam (d. 1660), whom her son Thomas described as \"a Woman that truly feared God, and served him in her Day and Generation.\" Aldham's son William was instrumental in opening the first permanent Quaker meeting house in the area, a building that survives as a private house in Quaker Lane.\n\nAldham was an early disciple of George Fox, with whom he was instrumental in establishing the Balby meeting. Fox, who had suffered violent assaults in Tickhill and Doncaster, preached for several hours under a walnut tree in Balby in 1652 to a large crowd. (A chair in the present Doncaster Meeting House is made from wood from this tree, and a table made from it was sent to America in 1967.)\n\nAldham was imprisoned in York in 1652 for speaking in a \"steeple-house\" (church), and fined 40 shillings for refusing to pay taxes, keeping on his hat, and saying \"thou\" to the judge, in keeping with the Quaker refusal to recognize ranks among men. He was imprisoned but released after two-and-a-half years, upon application, it is said, to Oliver Cromwell. He then travelled to various prisons where Quakers were confined and tried to obtain their release. He was also physically attacked by non-Quakers in 1654, 1655, and 1658. He prophesied the downfall of the Protector for disregarding his petitions, but said of Charles II of England, \"I find nothing to this Man.\" Aldham is counted among the Valiant Sixty who were active in the early days of the Religious Society of Friends. He died in Warmsworth in April 1660.\n\nDuring Aldham's lifetime the Friends grew from a small group of northern separatists into a national movement. Most of his writings date from the period of his imprisonment. They show an interest in wider Quaker affairs: he set about establishing contacts between northern Quakers and printers in London, and promoting the first general Quaker fund for missionary work.\n\nAccording to Catie Gill, author of his ODNB entry, \"His political and religious ideas were sometimes quite theatrically expressed. A parliamentarian sympathizer, he nevertheless once tore his hat into shreds when he was granted an audience with Oliver Cromwell, indicating, it seems, the certain belief that the protector would soon be torn from power.\" He did much to document and protest against the wrongful imprisonment of Quakers. Several of his letters appeared as or in tracts in the early 1650s, and in volume form in 1690.\n"}
{"id": "30468", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30468", "title": "Tollund Man", "text": "Tollund Man\n\nTollund Man is a naturally mummified corpse of a man who lived during the 4th century BC, during the period characterised in Scandinavia as the Pre-Roman Iron Age. He was found in 1950, preserved as a bog body, on the Jutland peninsula. The man's physical features were so well-preserved that he was mistaken at the time of discovery for a recent murder victim. Twelve years before Tollund Man's discovery, another bog body, Elling Woman, had been found in the same bog.\n\nOn 6 May 1950, peat cutters in the Bjældskovdal peat bog, west of Silkeborg, Denmark discovered a corpse in the peat layer which appeared so fresh that they at first believed they had discovered a recent murder victim. \n\nThe Tollund Man lay away from firm ground, buried under of peat, his body arranged in a fetal position. He wore a pointed skin cap of sheepskin and wool, fastened under his chin by a hide thong, and a smooth hide belt around his waist. Additionally, a noose made of plaited animal hide was drawn tight around his neck and trailed down his back. Other than these, the body was naked. His hair was cropped so short as to be almost entirely hidden by his cap. There was short stubble (1 mm length) on his chin and upper lip, suggesting that he had not shaved on the day of his death.\n\nScholars believe the man was a human sacrifice rather than executed criminal because of the arranged position of his body, and the fact that his eyes and mouth were closed.\n\nC radiocarbon dating of Tollund Man indicated that he died in approximately 375–210 BC. The preserved tender soft tissues of his body are the consequence of the acid in the peat, along with the lack of oxygen underneath the surface and the cold climate of the Nordic countries. The acid in the peat, needed for the preservation of a human body, is caused by a bryophyte named Sphagnum. Sphagnum fights against degradation due to resistant phenolic compounds contained in their cell walls. Due to the acidity of peat, bones are typically dissolved rather than preserved.\n\nExaminations and X-rays showed that the man's head was undamaged, and his heart, lungs and liver were well preserved. The Silkeborg Museum estimated his age as approximately 40 years and height at , a relatively short stature even for the time. It is likely that the body had shrunk in the bog.\n\nOn the initial autopsy report in 1950, doctors concluded that Tollund Man died by hanging rather than strangulation. The rope left visible furrows in the skin beneath his chin and at the sides of his neck. There was no mark, however, at the back of the neck where the knot of the noose would have been located. After a re-examination in 2002, forensic scientists found further evidence to support these initial findings. Although the cervical vertebrae were undamaged (these vertebrae are often damaged as a result of hanging), radiography showed that the tongue was distended—an indication of death by hanging.\n\nThe stomach and intestines were examined and tests carried out on their contents. Scientists identified the man's last meal as porridge or gruel made from grains and seeds, both cultivated and wild. Approximately 40 kinds of seeds were identified, but the porridge was primarily composed of four types: barley, flax, false flax (\"Camelina sativa\") and knotgrass. From the stage of digestion it was concluded that the man had eaten 12 to 24 hours prior to his death. Porridges were common for people of this time. Because neither meat nor fresh fruit was found in the last meal, it is suggested that the meal was eaten in winter or early spring when these items were not available.\n\nBoth feet and the right thumb, being well conserved by the peat, were also preserved in formalin for later examination. In 1976, the Danish police made a fingerprint analysis, making Tollund Man's thumbprint one of the oldest prints on record.\n\nThe body is displayed at the Silkeborg Museum in Denmark, although only the head is original. Because conservation techniques for organic material were insufficiently advanced in the early 1950s for the entire body to be preserved, the forensic examiners suggested the head be severed and the rest of the body remain unpreserved. Subsequently, the body desiccated and the tissue disappeared. In 1987, the Silkeborg Museum reconstructed the body using the skeletal remains as a base. As displayed today, the original head is attached to a replica of the body.\n\nIn Denmark, more than 500 bog bodies and skeletal remains dating to the Iron Age have been recovered. Specimens from Jutland include the relatively well-preserved Borremose bodies, Huldremose Woman, Grauballe Man on display at Moesgaard Museum near Aarhus, and the similarly conserved Haraldskær Woman. Approximately 30 of these bog bodies are housed and/or displayed in Danish museums for continued research.\n\nNobel Prize-winning Irish poet Seamus Heaney wrote a series of poems inspired by P.V. Glob's study of the mummified Iron Age bodies found in Jutland's peat bogs, finding contemporary political relevance in the relics of the ritualistic killings. Heaney's poem \"The Tollund Man\", published in his \"Wintering Out\" collection, compares the ritual sacrifice to those who died in the sectarian violence of \"the Troubles.\" Heaney wrote an excerpt from the poem in the Tollund Man exhibit's guest book in 1973.\n\nBritish author Margaret Drabble, in her 1989 novel, \"A Natural Curiosity\", uses her characters' obsession with the Tollund Man to provide a satirical criticism of Margaret Thatcher's modern England.\n\nTollund Man is featured in separate songs: \"Tollund Man\" (1995) by the American folk band The Mountain Goats and \"Curse of the Tollund Man\" (2004) by the English rock band The Darkness.\n\nTollund Man was mentioned in the episode \"Mummy in the Maze\" of the American television series \"Bones\" and was also mentioned in the 2016 movie \"Sacrifice\" in which a bog body was found in the Shetland Islands.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "985103", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=985103", "title": "Traffic ticket", "text": "Traffic ticket\n\nA traffic ticket is a notice issued by a law enforcement official to a motorist or other road user, indicating that the user has violated traffic laws. Traffic tickets generally come in two forms, citing a moving violation, such as exceeding the speed limit, or a non-moving violation, such as a parking violation, with the ticket also being referred to as a parking citation, notice of illegal parking or parking ticket.\n\nIn some jurisdictions, a traffic ticket constitutes a notice that a penalty, such as a fine or deduction of points, has been or will be assessed against the driver or owner of a vehicle; failure to pay generally leads to prosecution or to civil recovery proceedings for the fine. In others, the ticket constitutes only a citation and summons to appear at traffic court, with a determination of guilt to be made only in court.\n\nIn Australia, traffic laws are made at the state level, usually in their own consolidated Acts of Parliament which have been based upon the Australian Road Rules.\n\nTraffic tickets are known as Traffic infringement notices (TIN's) in NSW. The Roads and Maritime Services (formerly Roads and Traffic Authority) of NSW maintains a database of all registered holders of a driver's licence in NSW, including the driver's traffic history and registered motor vehicles.\nThe Roads and Maritime Services maintain a number of fixed, and mobile, speed cameras and red light cameras across the State. The State Debt Recovery Office (SDRO) manages the processing and issuing of traffic tickets detected and issued by these devices. These tickets are deemed to be 'owner onus' tickets with the vehicles registered owner deemed liable unless they nominate another driver via statutory declaration.\nThese are generally issued 'on the spot' by a police officer although there are other authorised officers that can issue traffic infringemnts such as Roads and Maritime Services heavy vehicle inspectors and Traffic Commanders. The infringement notice is written on three carbonised pieces of printed paper, known as Part A, B and C. Part A is the original and is sent to the State Debt Recovery Office (SDRO) by the issuing officer when they return to the station, Part B stays in the infringement book for accountability and Part C is given to the accused person at the scene or via post. Infringement notices issued by Council's or Commercial Clients by way of electronic handheld devices still have as associated application for details provided on a copy of the Part A, to be made available for perusal if required.\n\nIn NSW all Traffic infringement notices (TIN's) and Parking Infringement Notices (PIN's) are part of the Self-Enforcing Infringement Notice Scheme (SEINS). This scheme aims to minimize Court time for people who wish to plead guilty. The accused person can either elect to pay/part pay the infringement by way of a number of online means or through Australia Post, this can be found on the ticket. If the Accused person pays the infringement, they are deemed to have plead guilty and any demerit points will be deducted from their driver's licence. Matters only go to Court if the accused person elects to have the matter heard at Court.\n\nIf the accused person wishes to plead not guilty, they fill the reverse side of Part C out and mail it to the State Debt Recovery Office (SDRO). Once this is done, a Court date is set for hearing before a Magistrate and the officer is notified. The officer creates a brief of evidence and provides this to the Court and the accused person, this contains a copy of Part A, which includes the facts of the matter i.e. observations and contemporaneous notes, including description of vehicle, and whether or not any photographs of an offending vehicle have been taken. Quite often, an officer will indicate that they have taken only (1) photograph of a vehicle then, when a matter is defended in court and the prosecution provide a brief of evidence with anything up to 4-5 extra photographs this can lead to some of the photographs being excluded as evidence because there is no indication to show on the Part A that they were taken at the time of the offence.\n\nUpon being issued a traffic infringement, or parking infringement notice, (in person or to a vehicle) an accused person will generally receive a penalty reminder notice in the mail approximately 28 days later, if the fine remains unpaid.\n\nUnder the Fines Act of 1996 (NSW) Time for service of penalty reminder notices by post, is (7) days unless it is established that it was not served within (7) days. A due date for payment of Penalty Reminder notices under this Act is (21) days after it is served. Generally from the date of an offence approximately (28) days is given, after which time of the due date they will then have approximately an additional 21 days in which to take action, and finalise the matter. This includes (7) to allow for service, and (14) days for action to be taken.\n\nIf the fine is not actioned by the due date on the penalty reminder notice, an enforcement order will be issued and additional costs apply. If the enforcement order remains unpaid further enforcement action can follow, which may include suspension of the persons driver licence and/or vehicle registration, restrictions on conducting business with Roads and Maritime Services (RMS), garnisheeing of wages, property seizure order or a community service order and additional fees.\n\nIn Canada, most traffic laws are made at the provincial level. However, some serious violations are criminal offences, contrary to the federal Criminal Code. Both levels of government may deal with different aspects of the same misconduct. For example, drinking and driving may be a criminal offence of driving while impaired, or driving with a blood alcohol level greater than .08. At the same time, most provinces have laws specifying administrative penalties for driving with a blood alcohol level which does not exceed the criminal blood alcohol level of .08, in particular for newly licensed drivers.\n\nEach province maintains a database of motorists, including their convicted traffic violations. Upon being ticketed, a motorist has a chance to plead guilty or not guilty with an explanation. The motorist or their representative must attend the court for the town or city in which the violation took place to do so.\n\nIf the motorist pleads not guilty, a trial date is set and both the motorist, or a lawyer/paralegal representing the motorist, and the ticketing officer, are required to attend. If the officer fails to attend, the court judge will often find in favour of the motorist and dismiss the charge, although sometimes the trial date is moved to give the officer another chance to attend. In some provinces, officers are now paid time and a half to attend traffic proceedings. The court will also make provisions for the officer or the prosecutor to achieve a deal with the motorist, often in the form of a plea bargain. If no agreement is reached, both motorist and officer, or their respective representatives, formally attempt to prove their case before the judge or Justice of Peace, who then decides the matter.\n\nIf the motorist pleads guilty, the outcome is equivalent to conviction after trial. Upon conviction, the motorist is generally fined a monetary amount and, for moving violations, is additionally given demerit points, under each province's point system. Jail time is sometimes sought in more serious cases such as racing or stunt driving.\n\nIn the province of Ontario, drivers who are convicted of certain driving related offences result in demerit points recorded onto their driving records. It is commonly misconceived that drivers actually \"lose\" points due to convictions for certain traffic offences. In fact, a driver begins with zero demerit points and accumulates demerit points for convictions. Demerit points stay on a driver's record for two years from the original offence date. If a driver accumulates enough points, a suspension/loss of licence can occur.\n\nFor a fully licensed driver in Ontario, the accumulation of six demerit points results in a “warning” letter. At nine points, the driver is scheduled a mandatory interview to discuss their record and give specific reasonings as to why the licence should not be suspended. If a driver fails to attend this meeting, their licence may be automatically suspended. At 15 or more points, a driver’s licence will be suspended for 30 days. Surrendering a licence to the Ministry of Transportation is mandatory at this stage; failure to surrender the licence may result in a suspension/loss for up to two years.\n\nTraffic violations in India are listed out in the Motor Vehicle Act of 1988. The state government has the rights to decide on the officials who are to do traffic rule enforcement and how traffic citations are issued. Generally the Regional Transport Authority (RTA) and Traffic Police (which is part of the general law and order police force) are allowed to book traffic violations. Officers of and above the rank of Asst. Motor Vehicle Inspector (A.MVI) and Sub-Inspector in charge of the Traffic Police wing have the right to levy on-the-spot fines from the violators. This is known as \"compounding\" an offence. Fines would be paid on the spot and a \"Challan\" (receipt) would be given to the driver. Off late officers on Highway Police duty are also authorised to levy spot fines...\n\nOther officers issue a \"Vehicle Check report\" which lists out the violations noticed on the driver or on the vehicle. The notice would contain the relevant sections in which the driver is charged and also a date to appear in court. The accused can plead guilty by sending a Postal Money order (MO) to the court indicating that he is pleading guilty. Otherwise he/she can appear in person in the court and contest the case. The police officers who prepared the check report and charge sheet would be in the court. The court which handles these cases are the Judicial First Class Magistrate Courts and the trial is a \"summary trial\" (which means if a person is found guilty, he/she cannot appeal to higher courts).\n\nFor drivers who drive under the influence of liquor or other narcotic substance, on-the-spot fine cannot be levied. The driver would be taken to a hospital and a medical report made out. The accused should appear in court. A driver can also insist that he/she would not be paying the fine at the spot and the case have to be heard in the magistrate's court. In such a case the Police officer should issue a notice for appearance in the court.\n\nIn the city of Kolkata, certain traffic violations such as breaking a red light results in traffic police sending a ticket to the driver's home address. The ticket has to be paid to a state or central bank.\n\nIndian Police forces do not have mobile credit card readers, so the fine is generally paid in cash.\n\nIn the Republic of Ireland, a traffic ticket (which is mailed out to the driver) is in the form of a notice alleging that some crime — traffic offences are all criminal offences — has been committed, but stating that if a payment of a certain amount is made to the Garda Síochána within 28 days, or the amount increased by 50% is paid within 56 days, the driver will not be prosecuted for the alleged offence. Some tickets carry penalty points as well as the fine.\n\nMost of Scandinavia determines some traffic fines based on income. For example, Finland’s system for calculating fines starts with an estimate of the amount of spending money a Finn has for one day, and then divides that by two. The resulting number is considered a \"reasonable\" amount of spending money to deprive the offender of. Then, based on the severity of the crime, the system has rules for how many days the offender must go without that money. For example, driving about 15 mph over the speed limit results in a multiplier of 12 days. Most reckless drivers pay between $30 and $50 per day, for a total of about $400 or $500. In 2002, a Nokia executive was fined the equivalent of $103,000 for driving at 75 km/h (47 mph) in a 50 km/h (31 mph) zone on his motorcycle.\n\nIn the United States, most traffic laws are codified in a variety of state, county and municipal laws or ordinances, with most minor violations classified as infractions, civil charges or criminal charges. The classification of the charge depends on the violation itself as well as the jurisdiction, with infractions, civil charges and criminal charges relating to different standards of proof, trial rules and punishments.\n\nWhat constitutes a \"minor violation\" or infraction varies, examples include non-moving violations, defective or improper vehicle equipment, seat belt and child-restraint safety violations, and insufficient proof of license, insurance or registration. A trend in the late 1970s and early 1980s also saw an increased tendency for jurisdictions to re-classify certain speeding violations as civil infractions. In contrast, for more \"serious\" violations, traffic violators may be held criminally liable, accused of a misdemeanor or even a felony. Serious violations tend to involve multiple prior offenses, willful disregard of public safety, death or serious bodily injury, or damage to property. A frequently used penalty is a fine, and this is ordinarily a fixed amount of money, instead of being an amount of money determined based on the facts of each individual case.\n\nIf the motorist wishes to contest a traffic infraction, a hearing can be set by the court upon proper request. The hearings are before a magistrate or judge depending on the state or city. Hearing dates may potentially be adjourned, and witnesses or police officers may be subpoenaed to appear in court.\n\nAt any point after the issuance of a ticket, a motorists may retain an attorney to represent them in a traffic infraction. Retaining or consulting an attorney may be beneficial to the motorist because an attorney would better understand how to contest an infraction in any given state or municipality. Attorneys may offer full representation in court, taking a case from inception to disposal and potentially appeals, although it may be possible for a defendant to retain a lawyer to discuss legal options, identify important defenses, and determine a defense strategy without hiring the lawyer to provide in-court representation.\n\nThe motorist may be given the opportunity to schedule a hearing for a time at which the subpoenaed ticketing officer is unable to attend. If the officer or representative fails to attend the trial for a civil infraction, the trial court may adjourn the hearing to a date upon which the officer is able to appear or, particularly if good cause is not shown for the officer's absence, the court judge may dismiss the charge.\n\nAlthough each judge, state, county or municipality handle contested hearings a little differently, the court may make provisions for the prosecutor to achieve a deal with the motorist, often in the form of a plea bargain that may reduce the impact from that which would be incurred from pleading guilty without attending court. If no agreement is reached, and the prosecutor feels it is worth his time to charge the motorist, both motorist and officer, or their respective representatives, formally attempt to prove their case before the judge, who then decides the matter.\n\nIn some states and for criminal traffic violations, the judge may also order a jury trial, in which case a jury will hear arguments from both sides, and then consider the facts in the case and render a verdict. The motorist may, for example, put forward a reason their alleged violation was justified, such as to \"get out of the way of an ambulance or avoid a collision with another motorist\", and call into doubt the level to which the officer recalls the specific details of the situation among the many tickets they have issued.\n\nIn Washington state, there is a local option for courts to permit a decision on written statements, without the officer's live appearance in court. California offers a procedure in which both the officer and the ticketed driver may appear in writing, through a Trial by Written Declaration.\n\nSome states permit challenging a traffic infraction through a written statement instead of appearing in court. For example, California's Vehicle Code Section 40902 permits individuals to obtain a trial by written declaration instead of making an in-court appearance.\n\nEach state's Department of Motor Vehicles or Bureau of Motor Vehicles maintains a database of motorists, including their convicted traffic violations. Upon being ticketed, a motorist is given the option to mail into the local court or the court for the jurisdiction in which the violation is alleged—a plea of guilty, not guilty or nolo contendere within a certain time frame (usually ten to fifteen days, although courts generally provide leniency in this regard). Additionally, the motorist can request a mitigation hearing, which acknowledges that the driver is guilty of a moving violation, but is requesting a hearing with a judge to reduce the fines associated with the ticket.\n\nIf the motorist pleads guilty, the outcome is equivalent to a conviction after the hearing. Upon conviction, the motorist is generally fined a monetary amount and, for moving violations, is additionally assessed a penalty under each state's point system. If a motorist is convicted of a violation in a state other than the state in which the motorist is registered, information about the ticket is relayed in accord with state policy and agreements between the two states, including the Non-Resident Violator Compact. If the ticket information is not abstracted to the state in which the motorist is licensed, then the record of the conviction remains local to the state where the violation took place.\n\nThe practice of ticket fixing by police officers is a recurring source of controversy in the United States. Police officers in many jurisdictions surreptitiously cancel tickets as a \"professional courtesy\" to the friends and family of other police officers. This practice is not legal in most jurisdictions, but enforcement is often lax, leading to periodic scandals.\n\nThere are many competing claims as to the first speeding ticket ever issued depending whether the claim goes by the first traffic violation or the first \"paper ticket\" ever issued. Great Britain may have the earliest claim with the first person to be convicted of speeding, Walter Arnold of East Peckham, Kent, who on 28 January 1896 was fined for speeding at in a zone. He was fined 1 shilling plus costs. A New York City cab driver named Jacob German was arrested for speeding on May 20, 1899 for driving 12 miles per hour on Lexington Avenue in Manhattan. In Dayton, Ohio, police issued a \"paper ticket\" to Harry Myers for going twelve miles per hour on West Third Street in 1904.\n\nAnother early speeding ticket was issued in 1910 to Lady Laurier, the wife of Wilfrid Laurier, Prime Minister of Canada, in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, for exceeding the 10 miles per hour speed limit.\n\nThe fastest convicted speeder in the UK was Daniel Nicks, convicted of on a Honda Fireblade motorcycle in 2000. He received six weeks in jail and was banned from driving for two full years. The fastest UK speeder in a car was Timothy Brady, caught driving a 3.6-litre Porsche 911 Turbo at on the A420 in Oxfordshire in January 2007 and jailed for 10 weeks and banned from driving for 3 years.\n\nThe most expensive speeding ticket ever given is believed to be the one given to Jussi Salonoja in Helsinki, Finland, in 2003. Salonoja, the 27-year-old heir to a company in the meat-industry, was fined 170,000 euros for driving 80 km/h in a 40 km/h zone. The uncommonly large fine was due to Finnish speeding tickets (when excess speed is considerable) being relative to the offender's last known income. Salonoja's speeding ticket was not the first ticket given in Finland reaching six figures.\n\n"}
{"id": "43797", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=43797", "title": "Violence against LGBT people", "text": "Violence against LGBT people\n\nLesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) people can face violence motivated by hateful attitudes towards their sexuality or gender identity. Violence may be executed by the state, as in laws prescribing corporal punishment for homosexual acts (see homosexuality laws), or by individuals engaging in intimidation, mobbing, assault, or lynching (see gay bashing, trans bashing). Violence targeted at people because of their perceived sexuality can be psychological or physical and can extend to murder. These actions may be motivated by homophobia, lesbophobia, biphobia, transphobia, and may be influenced by cultural, religious, or political mores and biases.\n\nCurrently, homosexual acts are legal in almost all Western countries, and in many of these countries violence against LGBT people is classified as a hate crime, with such violence often being connected with conservative or religious leaning ideologies which condemn homosexuality, or being perpetrated by individuals who associate homosexuality with being weak, ill, feminine, or immoral. Outside the West, many countries, particularly those where the dominant religion is Islam, most African countries (excluding South Africa), most Asian countries (excluding the LGBT-friendly countries of Israel, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, and the Philippines) and some former-Communist countries in Eastern Europe and Central Asia, such as Russia, Poland, Albania, Kosovo, Montenegro and Bosnia and Herzegovina, are currently very dangerous for LGBT people because of discrimination against homosexuals which influences both discriminatory legislation and physical violence.\n\nIn Europe, the European Union's Employment Equality Framework Directive and Charter of Fundamental Rights offer some protection against sexuality-based discrimination.\n\nHistorically, state-sanctioned persecution of homosexuals was mostly limited to male homosexuality, termed \"sodomy\". During the medieval and early modern period, the penalty for sodomy was usually death. During the modern period (from the 19th century to the mid-20th century) in the Western world, the penalty was usually a fine or imprisonment.\n\nThere was a drop in locations where homosexual acts remained illegal from 2009 when there were 80 countries worldwide (notably throughout the Middle East, Central Asia and in most of Africa, but also in some of the Caribbean and Oceania) with five carrying the death penalty to 2016 when 72 countries criminalized consensual sexual acts between adults of the same sex. \n\nBrazil is reported to have the world's highest LGBT murder rate, with more than 380 murders in 2017 alone, an increase of 30% compared to 2016.\n\nAn early law against sexual intercourse between men is recorded in Leviticus by the Hebrew people, prescribing the death penalty. A violent law regarding homosexual intercourse is prescribed in the Middle Assyrian Law Codes (1075 BCE), stating: \"If a man lay with his neighbor, when they have prosecuted him (and) convicted him, they shall lie with him (and) turn him into a eunuch\".\n\nIn the account given in Tacitus \"Germania\", the death penalty was reserved for two kinds of capital offenses: military treason or desertion was punished by hanging, and moral infamy (cowardice and homosexuality: \"ignavos et imbelles at corpore infames\"); Gordon translates \"corpore infames\" as \"unnatural prostitutes\"; Tacitus refers to male homosexuality, see\nDavid F. Greenberg, \"The construction of homosexuality\", p. 242 f. Scholarship compares the later Germanic concept of Old Norse \"argr\", Langobardic \"arga\", which combines the meanings \"effeminate, cowardly, homosexual\", see Jaan Puhvel, 'Who were the Hittite \"hurkilas pesnes\"?' in: A. Etter (eds.), \"O-o-pe-ro-si\" (FS Risch), Walter de Gruyter, 1986, p. 154.\n\nIn Republican Rome, the poorly attested \"Lex Scantinia\" penalized an adult male for committing a sex crime \"(stuprum)\" against an underage male citizen \"(ingenuus)\". It is unclear whether the penalty was death or a fine. The law may also have been used to prosecute adult male citizens who willingly took a pathic role in same-sex acts, but prosecutions are rarely recorded and the provisions of the law are vague; as John Boswell has noted, \"if there was a law against homosexual relations, no one in Cicero's day knew anything about it.\" When the Roman Empire came under Christian rule, all male homosexual activity was increasingly repressed, often on pain of death. In 342 CE, the Christian emperors Constantius and Constans declared same-sex marriage to be illegal. Shortly after, in the year 390 CE, emperors Valentinian II, Theodosius I and Arcadius declared homosexual sex to be illegal and those who were guilty of it were condemned to be publicly burned alive. Emperor Justinian I (527–565 CE) made homosexuals a scapegoat for problems such as \"famines, earthquakes, and pestilences.\"\n\nLaws and codes prohibiting homosexual practice were in force in Europe from the fourth to the twentieth centuries, and Muslim countries have had similar laws from the beginnings of Islam in the seventh century up to and including the present day. Abbasid Baghdad, under the Caliph Al-Hadi (785–786 CE), punished homosexuality with death.\n\nDuring the Middle Ages, the Kingdom of France and the City of Florence also instated the death penalty. In Florence, a young boy named Giovanni di Giovanni (1350–1365?) was castrated and burned between the thighs with a red-hot iron by court order under this law. These punishments continued into the Renaissance, and spread to the Swiss canton of Zürich. Knight Richard von Hohenberg (died 1482) was burned at the stake together with his lover, his young squire, during this time. In France, French writer Jacques Chausson (1618–1661) was also burned alive for attempting to seduce the son of a nobleman.\n\nIn 17th century Malta, there was harsh prejudice and laws towards those who were found guilty or speak openly of being involved in same-sex activity. English voyager and author William Lithgow, writing in March 1616, says a Spanish soldier and a Maltese teenage boy were publicly burnt to ashes for confessing to have practiced sodomy together. As a consequence, and fear to similar faith, about a hundred males involved in same-sex prostitution sailed to Sicily the following day. This episode, published abroad by a foreign writer, is the most detailed account of LGBT life during the rule of the Order. It represents that homosexuality was still a taboo, but a widespread practice, an open secret, and LGBT-related information was suppressed.\n\nIn England, the Buggery Act of 1534 made sodomy and bestiality punishable by death. This act was replaced in 1828, but sodomy remained punishable by death under the new act until 1861. The last executions were in 1835.\n\nIn Nazi Germany, homosexuals were among the groups targeted by the Holocaust (\"See Persecution of homosexuals in Nazi Germany and the Holocaust\"). (In 1936, the homosexual Federico García Lorca was executed by right-wing rebels who became Franco's dictatorship in Spain, Hitler's ally.) Neo-Nazis generally oppose homosexuality to the extent of supporting a renewed persecution the way it took place in Nazi Germany. Being homosexual is equated with being unmasculine and the German word ″Schwul″ ('gay') is used by German Neonazis as a curse word.\n\n, 72 countries criminalize consensual sexual acts between adults of the same sex. They are punishable by death in eight countries:\n\nCountries where homosexual acts are criminalized but not punished by death, by region, include:\n\nAfrica\nAsia\nAmerica\nPacific Islands\n\nAfghanistan, where such acts remain punishable with fines and a prison sentence, dropped the death penalty after the fall of the Taliban in 2001, who had mandated it from 1996. India criminalized homosexuality until June 2, 2009, when the High Court of Delhi declared section 377 of the Indian Penal Code invalid. \n\nJamaica has some of the toughest sodomy laws in the world, with homosexual activity carrying a 10-year jail sentence.\n\nInternational human rights organizations such as Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International condemn laws that make homosexual relations between consenting adults a crime. Since 1994, the United Nations Human Rights Committee has also ruled that such laws violated the right to privacy guaranteed in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.\n\nWorldwide, As of September 2018, homosexuality is illegal in 69 or 70 countries (if Palestine is included, where homosexuality is illegal in Gaza but legal in West Bank), 2 disputed territories (Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic and Somaliland) and 1 territory (Cook Islands) by a total of 72 or 73. However, all the countries and territories in The Americas and Oceania where homosexuality is illegal the penalty is not enforced \"de facto\" and in some cases the legalization has been proposed or is pending, the same situation repeat itself in few countries in Asia and Africa:\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Africa, homosexuality is illegal in 34 of 54 countries (Algeria, Angola, Botswana, Burundi, Cameroon, Chad, Comoros. Egypt, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Kenya, Liberia, Libya, Malawi, Mauritania, Mauritius, Morocco, Namibia, Nigeria, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, Eswatini (Swaziland), Tanzania, Togo, Tunisia, Uganda, Zambia and Zimbabwe) and in 2 disputed territories (Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic and Somaliland) by a total of 36. However, is legal in 20 countries, in all 8 territories and in a few countries of Africa where homosexuality is illegal the penalty is not enforced \"de facto\" and in some cases the legalization has been proposed or is pending.\n\nIn The Americas, homosexuality is illegal in 9 of 35 countries (Antigua and Barbuda, Barbados, Dominica, Grenada, Guyana, Jamaica, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines) by a total of 9. However is legal 26 countries, in all 21 territories, and in all the countries in The Americas where homosexuality is illegal the penalty is not enforced \"de facto\" and in some cases the legalization has been proposed or is pending.\nIn Asia, homosexuality is illegal in 20 of 50 countries (Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Brunei, Iran, Kuwait, Lebanon, Malaysia, Maldives, Myanmar, Oman, Pakistan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, Syria, Turkmenistan, United Arab Emirates, Uzbekistan and Yemen) by a total of 20. However is legal in 29 countries, in all 4 territories, and in a few countires of Asia where homosexuality is illegal the penalty is not enforced \"de facto\" and in some cases the legalization has been proposed or is pending.\nIn Oceania, homosexuality is illegal in 6 of 14 countries (Kiribati, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tonga and Tuvalu) and in 1 of 12 territories (Cook Islands) by a total of 7. However, it is legal in 8 countries, in 11 territories and in all the countries and territories in Oceania where homosexuality is illegal the penalty is not enforced \"de facto\" and in some cases the legalization has been proposed or is pending.\nWorldwide, as of September 2018, homosexuality is legal in 135 of 193 countries (in the UN), in 7 of 9 disputed territories (with the exceptions of Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic and Somaliland) and in 50 of 51 territories (with the exception of the Cook Islands) by a total of 192. However, in various countries where homosexuality is illegal the penalty is not enforced \"de facto\" and in some cases the legalization has been proposed or is pending.\n\n\nIn Africa, as of September 2018, homosexuality is legal in 20 of 54 countries (Benin, Burkina Faso, Cape Verde, Central African Republic, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Djibouti, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Guinea-Bissau, Ivory Coast, Lesotho, Madagascar, Mali, Mozambique, Niger, Republic of the Congo, Rwanda, São Tomé and Príncipe, Seychelles and South Africa) and in all 8 territories (Canary Islands, Ceuta, French Southern and Antarctic Lands, Madeira, Mayotte, Melilla, Réunion and Saint Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha) by a total of 28. However, in a few countries in Africa where homosexuality is illegal the penalty is not enforced \"de facto\" and in some cases the legalization has been proposed or is pending.\nIn The Americas, as of September 2018, homosexuality is legal in 26 of 35 countries (Argentina, Bahamas, Belize, Bolivia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Cuba, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Haiti, Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Suriname, Trinidad and Tobago, United States, Uruguay and Venezuela) and in all 21 territories (Anguilla, Aruba, Bermuda, British Virgin Islands, Caribbean Netherlands , Cayman Islands, Curaçao, Falkland Islands, French Guiana, Greenland, Guadeloupe, Martinique, Montserrat, Puerto Rico, Saint Barthélemy, Saint Martin, Saint Pierre and Miquelon, Sint Maarten, South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands, Turks and Caicos Islands and United States Virgin Islands) by a total of 47. However, in all countries in The Americas where homosexuality is illegal the penalty is not enforced \"de facto\" and in some cases the legalization has been proposed or is pending.\nIn Asia, as of September 2018, homosexuality is legal in 30 of 50 countries (Armenia, Azerbaijan, Bahrain, Cambodia, China, Cyprus, East Timor, Georgia, India, Indonesia, Iraq, Israel, Japan, Jordan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Laos, Mongolia, Nepal, North Korea, Palestine, Philippines, Russia, South Korea, Sri Lanka, Taiwan, Tajikistan, Thailand, Turkey and Vietnam) with 3 exceptions (in the provinces of Aceh, South Sumatra, and the city of Palembang (Applies only to Muslims) in Indonesia; in Gaza, Palestine; and Chechnya, Russia where homosexuals are abducted and sent to concentration camps based on their perceived sexual orientation. See Gay concentration camps in Chechnya), but is also legal in all 4 disputed territories (Abkhazia, Artsakh, Northern Cyprus and South Ossetia) and in all 4 territories (Akrotiri and Dhekelia, British Indian Ocean Territory, Hong Kong and Macau). However, a few countries in Asia where homosexuality is illegal the penalty is not enforced \"de facto\" and in some cases the legalization has been proposed or is pending. \nSince 2014, homosexuality is legal in all 51 countries, 5 disputed territories and 6 dependencies and other territories of Europe, becoming in the first continent where homosexuality is legal completely.\nAs of September 2018, homosexuality is legal in 8 of 14 countries (Australia , Fiji, Marshall Islands, Micronesia, Nauru, New Zealand, Palau and Vanuatu) and in 11 of 12 territories (American Samoa, Easter Island, French Polynesia, Guam, New Caledonia, Niue, Northern Mariana Islands, Pitcairn Islands, Tokelau, United States Minor Outlying Islands and Wallis and Futuna) of Oceania. However, all the countries and territories in Oceania where homosexuality is illegal the penalty is not enforced \"de facto\" and in some cases the legalization has been proposed or is pending.\n\nEven in countries where homosexuality is legal (most countries outside of Africa and the Middle East), there are reports of homosexual people being targeted with bullying or physical assault or even homicide.\n\nAccording to the Grupo Gay da Bahia, Brazil's oldest gay rights NGO, the rate of murders of homosexuals in Brazil is particularly high, with a reported 3,196 cases over the 30-year period of 1980 to 2009 (or about 0.7 cases per 100,000 population per annum).\nBrazilian gay group Grupo Gay da Bahia (GGB) reported 190 documented alleged homophobic murders in Brazil in 2008, accounting for about 0.5% of intentional homicides in Brazil (homicide rate 22 per 100,000 population as of 2008). 64% of the victims were gay men, 32% were trans women or transvestites, and 4% were lesbians.\nBy comparison, the FBI reported five homophobic murders in the United States during 2008, corresponding to 0.03% of intentional homicides (homicide rate 5.4 per 100,000 population as of 2008).\n\nThe numbers produced by the Grupo Gay da Bahia (GGB) have occasionally been contested on the grounds that they include all murders of LGBT people reported in the media — that is, not only those motivated by bias against homosexuals. Reinaldo de Azevedo, columnist of the right-wing Veja magazine, Brazil's most read weekly publication, called the GGB's methodology \"unscientific\" based on the above objection: that they make no distinction between murders motivated by bias and those that were not. On the high level of murders of transsexuals, he suggested transsexuals' allegedly high involvement with the drug trade may expose them to higher levels of violence as compared to non-transgender homosexuals and heterosexuals. \nIn many parts of the world, including much of the European Union and United States, acts of violence are legally classified as hate crimes, which entail harsher sentences if convicted. In some countries, this form of legislation extends to verbal abuse as well as physical violence.\n\nViolent hate crimes against LGBT people tend to be especially brutal, even compared to other hate crimes: \"an intense rage is present in nearly all homicide cases involving gay male victims\".\nIt is rare for a victim to just be shot; he is more likely to be stabbed multiple times, mutilated, and strangled. \"They frequently involved torture, cutting, mutilation... showing the absolute intent to rub out the human being because of his (sexual) preference\".\nIn a particularly brutal case in the United States, on March 14, 2007, in Wahneta, Florida, 25-year-old Ryan Keith Skipper was found dead from 20 stab wounds and a slit throat. His body had been dumped on a dark, rural road less than 2 miles from his home. His two alleged attackers, William David Brown, Jr., 20, and Joseph Eli Bearden, 21, were indicted for robbery and first-degree murder. Highlighting their malice and contempt for the victim, the accused killers allegedly drove around in Skipper's blood-soaked car and bragged of killing him. According to a sheriff's department affidavit, one of the men stated that Skipper was targeted because \"he was a faggot.\"\n\nIn Canada in 2008, police-reported data found that approximately 10% of all hate crimes in the country were motivated by sexual orientation. Of these, 56% were of a violent nature. In comparison, 38% of all racially motivated offenses were of a violent nature.\n\nIn the same year in the United States, according to Federal Bureau of Investigation data, though 4,704 crimes were committed due to racial bias and 1,617 were committed due to sexual orientation, only one murder and one forcible rape were committed due to racial bias, whereas five murders and six rapes were committed based on sexual orientation.\nIn Northern Ireland in 2008, 160 homophobic incidents and 7 transphobic incidents were reported. Of those incidents, 68.4% were violent crimes; significantly higher than for any other bias category. By contrast, 37.4% of racially motivated crimes were of a violent nature.\n\nPeople's ignorance of and prejudice against LGBT people can contribute to the spreading of misinformation about them and subsequently to violence. In 2018, a transgender woman was killed by a mob in Hyderabad, India, following false rumors that transgender women were sex trafficking children. Three other transgender women were injured in the attack.\n\nRecent research on university-level students indicated the importance of queer visibility and its impact in creating a positive experience for LGBTIQ+ members of a campus community, this can reduce the impact and effect of incidents on youth attending university. When there is a poor climate - students are much less likely to report incidents or seek help.\n\nMembers of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe began describing hate crimes based on sexual orientation (as opposed to generic anti-discrimination legislation) to be counted as aggravating circumstance in the commission of a crime in 2003.\n\nThe United States does not have federal legislation marking sexual orientation as criteria for hate crimes, but several states, including the District of Columbia, enforce harsher penalties for crimes where real or perceived sexual orientation may have been a motivator. Among these 12 countries as well, only the United States has criminal law that specifically mentions gender identity, and even then only in 11 states and the District of Columbia. In November 2010, the United Nations General Assembly voted 79-70 to remove \"sexual orientation\" from the Special Rapporteur on Extrajudicial, Summary or Arbitrary Executions, a list of unjustified reasons for executions, replacing it with \"discriminatory reasons on any basis\". The resolution specifically mentions a large number of groups, including race, religion, linguistic differences, refugees, street children and indigenous peoples.\n\nLegal and police response to these types of hate crimes is hard to gauge, however. Lack of reporting by authorities on the statistics of these crimes and under-reporting by the victims themselves are factors for this difficulty. Often a victim will not report a crime as it will shed unwelcome light on their orientation and invite more victimization.\n\nLegal defenses like the gay panic defense allow for more lenient punishments for people accused of beating, torturing, or killing homosexuals because of their orientation. These arguments posit that the attacker was so enraged by their victim's advances as to cause temporary insanity, leaving them unable to stop themselves or tell right from wrong. In these cases, if the loss of faculties is proven, or sympathized to the jury, an initially severe sentence may be significantly reduced. In several common law countries, the mitigatory defense of provocation has been used in violent attacks against LGBT persons, which has led several Australian states and territories to modify their legislation, in order to prevent or reduce the using of this legal defense in cases of violent responses to non-violent homosexual advances.\n\nThere have been several highly publicized cases where people convicted of violence against LGBT people have received shorter sentences. One such case is that of Kenneth Brewer. On 30 September 1997, he met Stephen Bright at a local gay bar. He bought the younger man drinks and they later went back to Brewer's apartment. While there, Brewer made a sexual advance toward Bright, and Bright beat him to death. Bright was initially charged with second-degree murder, but he was eventually convicted of third-degree assault and was sentenced to one year in prison.\nCases like Bright's are not isolated. In 2001, Aaron Webster was beaten to death by a group of youths armed with baseball bats and a pool cue while hanging around an area of Stanley Park frequented by gay men. Ryan Cran was convicted of manslaughter in the case in 2004 and released on parole in 2009 after serving only 4 years of his six-year sentence. Two youths were tried under Canada's Youth Criminal Justice Act and sentenced to three years after pleading guilty. A fourth assailant was acquitted.\n\nJudges are not immune to letting their own prejudices affect their judgment either. In 1988, Texas Judge Jack Hampton gave a man 30 years for killing two gay men, instead of the life sentence requested by the prosecutor. After handing down his judgment, he said: \"I don't much care for queers cruising the streets picking up teenage boys ...[I] put prostitutes and gays at about the same level ... and I'd be hard put to give somebody life for killing a prostitute.\"\n\nIn 1987, a Florida judge trying a case concerning the beating to death of a gay man asked the prosecutor, \"That's a crime now, to beat up a homosexual?\" The prosecutor responded, \"Yes, sir. And it's also a crime to kill them.\" \"Times have really changed,\" the judge replied. The judge, Daniel Futch, maintained that he was joking, but was removed from the case.\n\nLGBT Pride Parades often attract violence because of their public nature. Though many countries where such events take place attempt to provide police protection to participants, some would prefer that the parades not happen, and police either ignore or encourage violent protesters. The country of Moldova has shown particular contempt to marchers, shutting down official requests to hold parades and allowing protesters to intimidate and harm any who try to march anyway. In 2007, after being denied a request to hold a parade, a small group of LGBT people tried to hold a small gathering. They were surrounded by a group twice their size who shouted derogatory things at them and pelted them with eggs. The gathering proceeded even so, and they tried to lay flowers at the Monument to the Victims of Repression. They were denied the opportunity, however, by a large group of police claiming they needed permission from city hall.\n\nThe following year, a parade was again attempted. A bus carried approximately 60 participants to the capital, but before they could disembark, an angry crowd surrounded the bus. They shouted things like \"let's get them out and beat them up\", and \"beat them to death, don't let them escape\" at the frightened passengers. The mob told the activists that if they wanted to leave the bus unharmed, they would have to destroy all of their pride materials. The passengers complied and the march was called off. All the while, police stood passively about 100 meters away, taking no action even though passengers claimed at least nine emergency calls were made to police while on the bus.\n\nRussia's officials are similarly averse to Pride Parades. Mayor of Moscow Yury Luzhkov has repeatedly banned marches, calling them \"satanic\". Pride participants instead tried to peacefully assemble and deliver a petition to city hall regarding the right of assembly and freedom of expression. They were met by skinheads and other protesters, and police who had closed off the square and immediately arrested activists as they entered. As some were being arrested, other participants were attacked by protesters. Police did nothing. Around eleven women and two men were arrested and left in the heat, denied medical attention, and verbally abused by police officers. The officers told the women, \"No one needs lesbians, no one will ever get you out of here.\" When participants were released from custody hours later, they were pelted by eggs and shouted at by protesters who had been waiting.\n\nHungary, on the other hand, has tried to afford the best protection they can to marchers, but cannot stem the flow of violence. In 2008, hundreds of people participated in the Budapest Dignity March. Police, on alert due to attacks on two LGBT-affiliated businesses earlier in the week, erected high metal barriers on either side of the street the march was to take place on. Hundreds of angry protesters threw petrol bombs and rocks at police in retaliation. A police van was set on fire and two police officers were injured in the attacks. During the parade itself, protesters threw Molotov cocktails, eggs and firecrackers at marchers. At least eight participants were injured. Forty-five people were detained in connection with the attacks, and observers called the spectacle \"the worst violence during the dozen years the Gay Pride Parade has taken place in Budapest\".\n\nIn Israel, three marchers in a gay pride parade in Jerusalem on June 30, 2005 were stabbed by Yishai Shlisel, a Haredi Jew. Shlisel claimed he had acted \"in the name of God\". He was charged with attempted murder.Ten years later, On 30 July 2015, six marchers were injured, again by Yishai Shlisel when he stabbed them. It was three weeks after he was released from jail. One of the victims, 16-year-old Shira Banki, died of her wounds at the Hadassah Medical Center three days later, on 2 August 2015. Shortly after, Prime Minister Netanyahu offered his condolences, adding \"We will deal with the murderer to the fullest extent of the law.\"\n\nAs a result of the strong anti-homosexual culture in Jamaica, many reggae and dancehall artists, such as Buju Banton, Elephant Man, Sizzla, have published song lyrics advocating violence against homosexuals.\nSimilarly, hip-hop music occasionally includes aggressively homophobic lyrics, but has since appeared to reform.\n\nBanton wrote a song when he was 15 years old that became a hit when he released it years later in 1992 called \"Boom Bye Bye\". The song is about murdering homosexuals and \"advocated the shooting of gay men, pouring acid on them and burning them alive.\" A song by Elephant Man proclaims: \"When you hear a lesbian getting raped/It's not our fault ... Two women in bed/That's two sodomites who should be dead.\"\n\nCanadian activists have sought to deport reggae artists from the country due to homophobic content in some of their songs, which they say promote anti-gay violence. In the UK, Scotland Yard has investigated reggae lyrics and Sizzla was barred from entering the United Kingdom in 2004 over accusations his music promotes murder.\n\nGay rights advocates have started the group Stop Murder Music to combat what they say is the promotion of hate and violence by artists. The group organized protests, causing some venues to refuse to allow the targeted artists to perform, and the loss of sponsors. In 2007, the group asked reggae artists to promise \"not to produce music or make public statements inciting hatred against gay people. Neither can they authorise the re-release of previous homophobic songs.\" Several artists signed that agreement, including Buju Banton, Beenie Man, Sizzla and Capleton, but some later denied signing it.\n\nDuring the 1980s, skinheads in North America who promoted emerging neo-Nazi pop culture and racist rock songs increasingly went to punk rock concerts that with anti-gay music advocating violence.\n\nThe vast majority of homophobic criminal assault is perpetrated by male aggressors on male victims, and is connected to aggressive heterosexual machismo or male chauvinism.\nTheorists including Calvin Thomas and Judith Butler have suggested that homophobia can be rooted in an individual's fear of being identified as gay.\nHomophobia in men is correlated with insecurity about masculinity. For this reason, allegedly homophobia is rampant in sports, and in the subculture of its supporters, that are considered stereotypically \"male\", such as football and rugby.\n\nThese theorists have argued that a person who expresses homophobia does so not only to communicate their beliefs about the class of gay people, but also to distance themselves from this class and its social status. Thus, by distancing themselves from gay people, they are reaffirming their role as a heterosexual in a heteronormative culture, thereby attempting to prevent themselves from being labeled and treated as a gay person.\n\nVarious psychoanalytic theories explain homophobia as a threat to an individual's own same-sex impulses, whether those impulses are imminent or merely hypothetical. This threat causes repression, denial or reaction formation.\n\nSome verses of the Bible are often interpreted as forbidding homosexual relations.\n\nThe above verses are the cause of tension between the devout of the Abrahamic religions and members of the LGBT community. It is viewed by many as an outright condemnation of homosexual acts between men, and, more commonly in ancient times than today, justification for violence.\n\nIn \"Religion Dispatches\" magazine, Candace Chellew-Hodge argues that the six or so verses that are often cited to condemn LGBT people are referring instead to \"abusive sex.\" She states that the Bible has no condemnation for \"loving, committed, gay and lesbian relationships\" and that Jesus was silent on the subject.\n\nIn today's society, many Christian denominations welcome people attracted to the same sex, but teach that same sex relationships and homosexual sex are sinful. These denominations include the Roman Catholic Church, the Eastern Orthodox church, the Methodist Church, and many other mainline denominations, such as the Reformed Church in America and the American Baptist Church, as well as Conservative Evangelical organizations and churches, such as the Evangelical Alliance, and the Southern Baptist Convention. Likewise, Pentecostal churches such as the Assemblies of God, as well as Restorationist churches, like Jehovah's Witnesses and The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, also take the position that homosexual activity is immoral.\n\nSome Christian groups advocate conversion therapy and promote ex-gay groups. One such group, Exodus International, argued that conversion therapy may be a useful tool for decreasing same-sex desires, and, while former affiliates of Exodus continue with such views, Exodus has since repudiated the organization's mission and apologised for the pain and hurt and promoting \"sexual orientation change efforts and reparative theories about sexual orientation that stigmatized parents.\" The medical and scientific consensus in the United States is that conversion therapy is likely harmful and should be avoided because it may exploit guilt and anxiety, thereby damaging self-esteem and leading to depression and even suicide. There is a broad concern in the mental health community that the advancement of conversion therapy itself causes social harm by disseminating inaccurate views about sexual orientation and the ability of gay, lesbian and bisexual people to lead happy, healthy lives. This promotion of the idea that homosexuality is immoral and can be corrected may make would-be attackers of homosexuals feel justified in that they are \"doing God's work\" by ridding the world of LGBT people.\n\nThe Catholic Church teaches that a homosexual orientation is not sinful and that LGBT people are to be treated with compassion and respect, as all others are. It also teaches that sex is meant to be had between opposite sex spouses. A 1992 letter from Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, the future Pope Benedict XVI, condemned gay bashing. It said that LGBT people \"have the same rights as all persons including the right of not being treated in a manner which offends their personal dignity.\" It adds that \nIt is deplorable that homosexual persons have been and are the object of violent malice in speech or in action. Such treatment deserves condemnation from the Church's pastors wherever it occurs. It reveals a kind of disregard for others which endangers the most fundamental principles of a healthy society. The intrinsic dignity of each person must always be respected in word, in action and in law.\n\nHowever, in the same letter Ratzinger suggested that anti-gay violence could be the fault of victims if they push too hard to seek equal rights, thereby absolving responsibility by those who conduct violent behaviour:\n\nWhen civil legislation is introduced to protect behavior to which no one has any conceivable right, neither the church nor society at large should be surprised when other distorted notions and practices gain ground and irrational and violent reactions increase. \n\nPope Benedict XVI, then the leader of the Roman Catholic Church stated that \"protecting\" humanity from homosexuality was just as important as saving the world from climate change and that all relationships beyond traditional heterosexual ones are a \"destruction of God's work.\" Pope Francis has been seen as more welcoming to LGBT people, saying to a gay man that \"God made you like this. God loves you like this. The Pope loves you like this and you should love yourself and not worry about what people say.\"\n\nEvangelicals in Africa sometimes use religion to justify violence against LGBT people and criminalizing homosexual behavior. Archbishops Peter Akinola of Nigeria and Henry Orombi of Uganda would not condemn violence against gays and lesbians when questioned on the issue at the Global Anglican Future Conference. Mark Russell, Chief Executive of Church Army, expressed outrage over their resistance, stating \"Quite honestly [refusal to condemn violence against gay people in their home countries] is disgraceful, it sullies their cause, and is totally un-Christian. You cannot justify violence in God's name. Period. [...] Those who perpetrate violence against gay people in Africa now can use this silence to justify their behaviour. Christians must speak up and say this is wrong.\"\n\nThe Quran, the book of Islam, cites the story of the \"people of Lot\" (also known as the people of Sodom and Gomorrah), destroyed by the wrath of Allah because they engaged in lustful carnal acts between men.\n\nScholars of Islam, such as Shaykh al-Islām Imam Malik, and Imam Shafi amongst others, ruled that Islam disallowed homosexuality and ordained capital punishment for a person guilty of it.\n\nThe legal punishment for sodomy has varied among juristic schools: some prescribe capital punishment; while other prescribe a milder discretionary punishment. Homosexual activity is a crime and forbidden in most Muslim-majority countries. In some relatively secular Muslim-majority countries such as Indonesia, Jordan and Turkey, this is not the case.\n\nThe Quran, much like the Bible and Torah, has a vague condemnation of homosexuality and how it should be dealt with, leaving it open to interpretation. For this reason, Islamic jurists have turned to the collections of the hadith (sayings of Muhammad) and Sunnah (accounts of his life). These, on the other hand, are perfectly clear and particularly harsh. Ibn al-Jawzi records Muhammad as cursing sodomites in several hadith, and recommending the death penalty for both the active and passive partners in same-sex acts.\n\nSunan al-Tirmidhi again reports Muhammad as having prescribed the death penalty for both the active and the passive partner: \"Whoever you find committing the sin of the people of Lot, kill them, both the one who does it and the one to whom it is done.\" The overall moral or theological principle is that a person who performs such actions challenges the harmony of God's creation, and is therefore a revolt against God.\n\nThough it must be noted that these views vary depending upon sect. It is noteworthy to point out that Quranists (those who do not integrate the aforementioned Hadiths into their belief system) do not advocate capital punishment.\n\nSome imams still preach their views, stating that homosexuals and \"women who act like men\" should be executed under the Islamic law. Abu Usamah at Green Lane Mosque in Birmingham defended his words to followers by saying \"If I were to call homosexuals perverted, dirty, filthy dogs who should be executed, that's my freedom of speech, isn't it?\"\n\nOther contemporary Islamic views are that the ″crime of homosexuality is one of the greatest of crimes, the worst of sins and the most abhorrent of deeds″. Homosexuality is considered the 11th major sin in Islam, in the days of the companions of Muhammad, a slave boy was once forgiven for killing his master who sodomized him.\n\nThe 2016 Orlando nightclub shooting was at the time the deadliest mass shooting by an individual and remains the deadliest incident of violence against LGBT people in U.S. history. On June 12, 2016, Omar Mateen killed 49 people and wounded more than 50 at Pulse gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida. The act has been described by investigators as an Islamic terrorist attack and a hate crime.\n\nIn Judaism, the death penalty against homosexuality has not been used in practice for more than 2000 years, though many movements still view homosexual acts as sinful. Orthodox Judaism generally prohibits homosexual conduct. While there is disagreement about which acts come under core prohibitions, all of Orthodox Judaism puts certain core homosexual acts, including sodomy in the category of \"yehareg ve'al ya'avor\"—\"die rather than transgress\"—the small category of Biblically-prohibited acts (also including murder, idolatry, adultery, and incest) which an Orthodox Jew is obligated under the laws of self-sacrifice under Jewish Law to die rather than do.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "542403", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=542403", "title": "Zygon", "text": "Zygon\n\nThe Zygons are an extraterrestrial race in the long-running British science fiction television programme \"Doctor Who\". The Zygons have shape-shifting abilities, allowing them to replicate the appearance of another being, but they must keep the subject alive in order to use its body print. Limited by the small size of their force, they rely on shape-shifting and their organic space craft to conceal their numbers and seize power on Earth.\n\nTenth Doctor actor David Tennant has stated that they are his favourite monsters from the show.\n\nThe Zygons first appeared in the 1975 serial \"Terror of the Zygons\", in which they planned to conquer Earth following the destruction of the Zygon homeworld. One of their spacecraft, commanded by warlord Broton, crash-landed into Loch Ness in Antiquity. The Zygons used a Skarasen (a creature that provides milk for their sustenance and which had become known as the Loch Ness Monster by humans) to attack an energy conference in London. The plan was foiled and Broton and his crew were killed, due to the intervention of the Fourth Doctor and the United Nations Intelligence Taskforce (UNIT). The Skarasen retreated into the depths of Loch Ness.\n\nThe Zygons are briefly mentioned (but not seen) in the Eleventh Doctor episode \"The Pandorica Opens\" (2010) as one of the many races in an alliance against the Doctor. In the 2012 episode, \"The Power of Three\", a Zygon ship is hidden beneath the Savoy Hotel where the Doctor takes Amy Pond and Rory Williams on their wedding anniversary. All the Zygons are disguised as hotel staff.\n\nThe Zygons returned in 2013 in \"The Day of the Doctor\", the 50th anniversary episode of the programme. The episode hints the stellar explosion (said to have destroyed their homeworld in the 1975 serial) was an effect of the Time War. A squad places themselves in suspended animation in Elizabethan England, planning to awaken in 2013 to infiltrate the Tower of London's Black Archive disguised as UNIT members. The scheme is foiled by the intervention of the Tenth Doctor, the Eleventh Doctor and the War Doctor. When UNIT is overrun by Zygon doppelgangers, Kate Lethbridge-Stewart threatens to detonate a nuclear device to prevent Zygon access to UNIT's storehouse of alien technology. The Doctors successfully negotiate a truce between the two species.\n\nThe ramifications of this treaty are explored in the ninth series two-parter \"The Zygon Invasion\" / \"The Zygon Inversion\" (2015). Zygons were allowed to re-home on Earth on the condition that they disguised themselves as people and lived incognito. In the intervening time, they developed the ability to retain a person's likeness after the death of the original and shapeshift into someone based on a telepathic scan of a nearby being. Although older generations of Zygons were committed to integration with human communities, the younger generations resented being forced to live as humans and quickly radicalised. The radicals and UNIT once again enter stalemate at the Tower of London, both poised to destroy one another, but the Twelfth Doctor makes an impassioned plea and convinces the radical Zygon leader to understand the lasting peace which the treaty was written to preserve.\n\n\"Terror of The Zygons\" was novelized by Target in 1976, written by Terrance Dicks, under the title \"Doctor Who and the Loch Ness Monster\". The book further expounded on the concept of the Zygon \"sting,\" poisonous barbs protruding from their hands, which explains why, in the television episode, the Zygons were able to inflict pain on other beings with a mere touch. (The original shooting script for the episode also included references to the sting but the on-screen portrayal of the concept failed to make it clear to the audience.)\n\nThe comic story \"Skywatch-7\", written by Alan McKenzie (under the pseudonym \"Maxwell Stockbridge\") and illustrated by Mick Austin, features a UNIT team encountering a single Zygon at a remote base. It was first published, in two parts, in \"Doctor Who Monthly\" #58 and the \"Doctor Who Winter Special 1981\".\n\nThe Eighth Doctor encountered the Zygons in the spin-off novel \"The Bodysnatchers\" by Mark Morris, which also named the now-destroyed Zygon homeworld as Zygor. The novel also revealed that Zygor had been destroyed as a result of an attack by an arachnid alien race from Tau Ceti, the Xaranti. The Doctor, his companion Sam Jones, and the Fourth Doctor's old acquaintance Professor Litefoot are able to stop the Zygons by poisoning the milk supply (although the Doctor had intended to merely drug them and miscalculated the dose), the Doctor taking the survivors to another planet.\n\nThe Zygons appear in the New Series Adventures novel \"Sting of the Zygons\" by Stephen Cole, featuring the Tenth Doctor and Martha Jones, which is set in the Lake District in 1909. A plan to set up a royal funeral where the Zygons could replace the rulers of various nations is thwarted through the Doctor's intervention, as well as a Zygon civil war when one of their two Skarasens is killed.\n\nThe Zygons have been featured in three audio plays produced by BBV, \"Homeland\" by Paul Dearing, \"Absolution\" (not to be confused with the Big Finish play Absolution) by Paul Ebbs and \"The Barnacled Baby\" by Anthony Keetch.\n\nThey made their Big Finish debut in the Eighth Doctor audio adventure \"The Zygon Who Fell to Earth\" by Paul Magrs and returned in \"Death in Blackpool\" by Alan Barnes.\n\nThe Zygons also feature in \"Zygon Hunt\" by Nicholas Briggs, facing the Fourth Doctor and Leela.\n\nThe Zygons were featured in the second Doctor Who Weetabix promotional set and were card number 9 in the Typhoo tea card set. Harlequin Miniatures produced two 28 mm figures, and Fine Art Castings produced two Zygon figurines, sized 80 mm and 40 mm. In October 2016 Recent onscreen versions have now been released in 28mm, by Warlord Games.\n\nIn 2008, a Zygon figure was released by Character Options in the first wave of their classic \"Doctor Who\" toy line.\n\nOn 26 June 2014 a Zygon as featured in \"The Day of the Doctor\" was released as part of the ongoing \"Doctor Who\" figurine collection from Eaglemoss. The Zygon will be the 23rd in the regular line of releases.\n\n\"Zygon\" is a spin-off drama production from BBV, featuring the Zygons. Early drafts were written by Lance Parkin and later ones by Jonathan Blum, although both authors removed their names from the final version (which was heavily rewritten again). It was eventually released in 2008 as \"Zygon: When Being You Just Isn't Enough \" (with an 18 certificate due to scenes of an adult nature), after a post-production period of about 5 years.\n"}
