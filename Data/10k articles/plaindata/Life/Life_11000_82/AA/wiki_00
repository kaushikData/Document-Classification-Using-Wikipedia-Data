By contrast, autogamy is the term used for self-fertilization. In humans, the fertilization event is an instance of allogamy. Self-fertilization occurs in hermaphroditic organisms where the two gametes fused in fertilization come from the same individual. This is common in plants (see Sexual reproduction in plants) and certain protozoans.\n\nIn plants, allogamy is used specifically to mean the use of pollen from one plant to fertilize the flower of another plant and usually synonymous with the term \"cross-fertilization\" or \"cross-pollination\" (outcrossing), though the latter term can be used more specifically to mean pollen exchange between different plant strains or even different plant species (where the term \"cross-hybridization\" can be used) rather than simply between different individuals.\n\nParasites having complex life cycles can pass through alternate stages of allogamous and autogamous reproduction, and the description of a hitherto unknown allogamous stage can be a significant finding with implications for human disease.\n\nAllogamy ordinarily involves cross-fertilization between unrelated individuals leading to the masking of deleterious recessive alleles in progeny. By contrast, close inbreeding, including self-fertilization in plants and automictic parthenogenesis in hymenoptera, tends to lead to the harmful expression of deleterious recessive alleles (inbreeding depression).\n\nIn dioecious plants, the stigma may receive pollen from several different potential donors. As multiple pollen tubes from the different donors grow through the stigma to reach the ovary, the receiving maternal plant may carry out pollen selection favoring pollen from less related donor plants. Thus post-pollination selection may occur in order to promote allogamy and avoid inbreeding depression. Also, seeds may be aborted selectively depending on donor–recipient relatedness.\n\n\n"}

She was their second child, another daughter, Susan Elizabeth, having been born in 1941. Harrison attended Greystones School, Bradford. The family later moved to Scarborough, where Harrison attended Newby County Primary School. In 1955 her mother died. She passed her 11-plus and attended Scarborough Girls' High School. In 1961, her father moved to Doncaster. Harrison stayed on at Scarborough to complete her O levels before joining her father in the summer of 1961. She then attended Doncaster High School until Easter, 1962.\n\nAfter leaving school, Harrison worked at Martins Bank from 1962 until 1964, then took a job as a nanny for a Swiss farmer in the Canton of Neuchâtel in order to improve her French. She later took another job as a nanny in San Francisco. While in San Francisco she applied for a job as a flight attendant with British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC), and she joined BOAC in May 1966. \n\nAfter completing her training, Harrison was assigned work onboard BOAC's Boeing 707 fleet. She moved to Emperor's Gate, Kensington, London, where she shared a flat with other BOAC flight attendants, and purchased a Ford Anglia car for use in getting to work at Heathrow Airport. She also joined Universal Aunts, which provided staff to do odd jobs; one of her assignments was babysitting Jason Connery, son of actor Sean Connery. While she enjoyed her job, long-haul flights with their several stopovers were exhausting, and she had told a friend she was considering quitting BOAC.\n\nOn 8 April 1968 Harrison was rostered at her own request to work BOAC Flight 712 Whiskey Echo long-haul to Sydney, Australia, via Zurich, Tel Aviv, Tehran, Bombay (now Mumbai), Singapore and Perth. She told a colleague that she had been invited to a wedding in Sydney, but it is possible that she wanted to see a Qantas pilot whom she had met some months before.\n\nHarrison, aged 22, was a flight attendant on board BOAC Flight 712 when it left Heathrow Airport at 16.27 BST on 8 April 1968, bound indirectly for Sydney.\nThe citation for Harrison's George Cross recites what happened almost immediately after takeoff:\nAccording to witnesses, after the escape chute had been burnt away Harrison continued to force passengers to safety by pushing them out the starboard rear door, even as \"flames and smoke [were] licking around her face\".\nShe then seemed to be preparing to jump but instead turned back inside; there was another explosion and she was not seen alive again. Her body was later found with four others near the rear door; all had died from \"asphyxia due to inhalation of fire fumes\".\n\nAnthony Crosland (President of the Board of Trade and the minister responsible for civil aviation) later wrote of Harrison's \"lonely and courageous action\" and \"devotion to duty, in the highest traditions of her calling\".\n\nIn August 1969 Harrison became the only woman to receive the George Cross in peacetime, and its youngest female recipient.\nIt is now at British Airways' Speedbird Centre, which is dedicated to the history of the crew and story of British Airways.\n\nThe \"Barbara Jane Harrison, GC, Memorial Fund\" was set up in October 1969 with the aim of raising £1,000 by October 1970. Almost £1,500 was raised which was used to buy a computer for the National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery, London, for use by the muscular dystrophy laboratories for research into the disease.\n\nA plaque in memory of Harrison was unveiled on 23 October 1970. The \"Barbara Harrison Prize\" was established in 1968 by the Royal Air Force Institute of Aviation Medicine. It is awarded to the best student on a Diploma in Aviation Medicine course whose first language is not English. The prize is now under the remit of the Department of Aviation Medicine at King's College, London.\nSince 2010, the Barbara Harrison Memorial Prize is awarded to the student of the Diploma in Aviation Medicine Course \"who has demonstrated commitment to others and determination to succeed through the course and in gaining the Diploma\".\n\nAlso in 1970, a plaque memorial was unveiled in St. George's Interdenominational Chapel in Heathrow Airport dedicated to Harrison.\n\nA plaque remembering Harrison is on the churchyard wall of St Laurence's Church, Scalby, Scarborough. \n\nHarrison's bravery is also commemorated with a memorial window in Bradford City Hall.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "55695648", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=55695648", "title": "Black beetle virus", "text": "Black beetle virus\n\nBlack beetle virus (BBV) is a virus that was initially discovered on the north island of New Zealand in Hellensville in dead New Zealand black beetles (\"Heteronychus arator\") in 1975\n\nBBV is recognized as a member of a group of small split arboviruses from the same line as Nodamura virus which was discovered 20 years prior to BBV in Japan. The genomes of these viruses are unusually small compared to others such as picorna and retroviruses. Because the virus only has 2 initial RNAs, this is the simplest class of virus. It should be noted that there is an RNA 3 that does appear only in infected cells.\nBBV has only been shown to infect insect cells. When transmitted to wax moth larvae, it can cause paralysis; however it cannot replicate in mammalian cells like other viruses in its family. Viruses such as Nodamura Virus and Flock house virus have been shown to infect mammals and fishes.\nBBV comes from the family of Nodaviridae that contains nine different viruses divided into two different sub groups: Alphanodavirus and Betanodavirus. BBV falls into the Alphanodavirus group along with Nodavirus. These viruses are non-enveloped, with icosahedral geometries, and T=3 symmetry. Their diameter is typically around 30 nm with BBV's being 32.4 nm. The virus genomes are linear and segmented, bipartite, around 21.4kb in length as well.\nAlphanodaviruses life cycles begin with penetration into the host cell. Once in the cytoplasm, RNA is transcribed within envagininations of the host cell using its own RNA dependent polymerase. To release, the virus causes lysis of the host cell from which copies of newly made virus are released.\n\nBBV is a (+)ssRNA virus from the family Nodaviridae and of the genus Alphanodavirus. The two other viruses within the Nodaviridae are Noramura virus and Flock House virus. Each member of the Nodaviridae is then classified as either an alpha or beta-nodavirus with BBV being an alphanodavirus. BBV, Flock House, and nodavirus are all group IV viruses with varying abilities to infect other animals in terms of species specificity.\n\nThe structure of BBV is similar to the other viruses in its family. BBV is made of a non-enveloped virion that has a diameter of approximately 32.4 nm. The virion is made up of 180 copies of a single viral coating protein. The virion is organized in T=3 icosahedral symmetry, meaning there are 60 triangular subunits each made up of 3 viral capsid proteins. The virion contains both RNA1 and RNA2 inside of it, but RNA3 is not included into the virion and is transcribed after infection of a host cell. RNA3 is not necessary for replication, however it is coded for with RNA1 making it always synthesized.\n\nThe BBV insect virus genome is made of two mRNA molecules encapsidated in a single virion. The nucleotide sequence of BBV RNA1 is 3015 bases long, this along with RNA2's 1399 base pairs completes the viral genome. The genome of BBV and other viruses in its family are incredibly small, nearly half the size of picornaviruses, making it the smallest class of virus with a segmented genome. The RNA1 sequence contains a 5' region of 38 nucleotides with no coding role. It also contains a coding region for protein A, which is used in RNA synthesis.Also a 3' proximal region encoding RNA3 (389 bases)is overlapped within the RNA1 sequence. RNA3 is a subgenomic messenger RNA made in infected cells but not encapsidated into the original virions. The RNA3 sequence begins inside the coding region of protein A and also forms protein B from its own frames. RNA1 and RNA2 seem to be fairly independent of each other, except for their ability to bond when forming the capsid. RNA2 is also found to suppress the function of RNA3, which could be a marker to begin capsid construction.\n\nThe genome and viral messenger for (+)ssRNA noroviridae viruses is the initial virion RNA. RNA1 sequence encodes for the virus' RNA-dependand RNA polymerase which is protein A. Thee virion also contains code for RNA2 which forms a precursor protein for capsid formation. RNA3 is also formed in infected cells from RNA1 sequence, and is inhibited by RNA2 though independently coded. RNA3 encodes for proteins B! and B2. B1 is used as the end terminal for RNA replicase, but the function is to totally clear. B2 is a separate unique protein which also has an unknown use. When tested, neither B1 or B2 was necessary for replication, however the new genotypes did not match exactly with the wild type.\n\nNot much information is known on the infection and replication cycle of BBV. However, it is respectively assumed to follow the path of other viruses of the same family.\n\nThe cell will first enter the cell via penetration of the membrane. Once in the cell, the virus uncoats itself and releases the genomic RNA into the cytoplasm of the cell. Typically, Nodaviridae will form an invagination within the membrane of the host cell mitochondria where it will prepare to replicate.\n\nOnce set in the invagination, RNA1 is transcribed, thus allowing for the RNA-dependent polymerase to be synthesized. The space occupied by the virus is then known as a cytoplasmic viral factory in which the virus uses the host cell machinery to continue replication of RNA strands that will then be turned into dsRNA. The dsRNA is then finally transcribed or replicated into either viral mRNA or more ssRNA to be replicated again.\n\nOnce RNA2 is synthesized, the virus then prepares for assembly. When the ratio of ribosomes to N proteins becomes favorable to switch to capsid formation, the virus spontaneously assembles around RNA1 and RNA2 into an icosahedral capsid leaving the previously synthesized RNA3 outside of the capsid. Once Capsid maturation occurs via autoproteolytic cleavage of capsid protein alpha, capsid protein beta and peptide gamma are formed. Peptide gamma is assumed to be released in the endosome where it disrupts the endosomal membrane allowing the new viral RNA to be released into the cytoplasm of the cell creating the new infected cell.\n\nAlthough BBV has been shown to infect multiple types of insect cells, it has only been seen in the wild to infect \"Heteronychus arator\" - the New Zealand black beetle. The virus is able to kill the host organism, and plays a key role in suppressing the population of black beetles when they verge on overpopulating.\n"}

Recognized for their unique bond and their prodigious rat-killing ability, they became a fixture of city newspapers, were exempted from local ordinances, and immortalized in cartoons.\n\nSan Francisco, in common with other cities in the United States at the time, had a problem with free-ranging dogs. In Los Angeles in the 1840s, dogs outnumbered people by nearly two to one, and while the situation in San Francisco had not reached this extreme, the large numbers of strays and feral dogs did cause problems. Dogs were regularly poisoned or trapped and killed. Nevertheless, if a dog turned out to be a good ratter or distinguished itself in some other way, it was still possible for it to survive.\n\nBummer was a black-and-white Newfoundland or Newfoundland cross who established himself outside the saloon of Frederick Martin in 1860 and quickly proved to be an exceptional rat-killer. His ratting talent spared him the fate of the former owner of the territory, Bruno, who had been poisoned with strychnine shortly before Bummer's arrival. He scraped a living begging scraps from passers-by and the patrons of the saloon and other establishments along Montgomery Street.\n\nIn 1861 Bummer rescued another dog from a fight with a larger canine opponent. The rescued dog was badly injured, with a deep wound on his leg, and was not expected to live. Bummer coaxed him to eat, brought back scraps from his scavenging missions and huddled next to him to keep him warm during the night. The injured dog quickly recovered and within days was following Bummer as he made his begging rounds in the streets. His remarkable recovery earned him the name Lazarus, and he proved to be an even more prodigious ratter than Bummer. As a team they turned out to be exceptional, once finishing off 85 rats in 20 minutes.\n\nTheir ratting talent and unique bond was seized upon by the city's press. Martin's saloon was a favorite haunt of newspapermen and journalists, so, with the dogs a fixture outside the bar, they never had to travel far for a story. The exploits of the dogs were recorded in detail in the \"Californian\", \"Daily Alta California\", \"Daily Morning Call\", and \"Daily Evening Bulletin\", the editors vying with each other in their attempts to endow the pair's adventures with thrills and parallels to the human condition. Bummer was portrayed as the gentleman down on his luck, yet still faithful and conscientious, while Lazarus, the mongrel, was cast in the role of the sly and self-serving fair-weather friend. When Bummer was shot in the leg after only a couple of months, and Lazarus left him to run with another dog, it suited the press no end: Bummer was said to be feeling the sting of ingratitude at the desertion of the cur he had saved from death. Lazarus' return when Bummer recovered only added to the excitement.\n\nThe two dogs had the run of the streets, and when, on June 14, 1862, Lazarus was taken by a new dog catcher, a mob of angry citizens demanded his release, petitioning to have the pair declared city property so they could wander the streets unmolested. The city supervisors released Lazarus and declared he and Bummer were exempt from the city ordinance against strays. A week later the two were reported to have stopped a runaway horse. Despite their reputations, the two could be vicious: Bummer was a sheep killer and regularly fought other dogs in the street, occasionally assisted by Lazarus (although normally Lazarus would restrict himself to barking encouragement). They also ransacked shops when they had entered unnoticed and had been locked in by the owners.\n\nThe two dogs were sometimes seen in the company of the \"Emperor of the United States\", the eccentric Joshua A. Norton, and a popular legend made him their owner. However, no contemporary records make any mention of Norton being the owner and only one newspaper report made any connection between him and the dogs. The rumor may have arisen because the cartoonist Edward Jump frequently featured the three together, most notably in \"The Three Bummers\" which showed Norton eating from a heavily laden buffet table while the dogs wait patiently for scraps. Norton was apparently outraged when he saw the picture displayed in a shop-front window: the imperial dignity was affronted by the depiction of His Majesty in the company of lowly dogs. Despite the apparent antipathy felt by Norton for the dogs, the close association was still being claimed in the 1950s:\n\nLazarus was killed in October 1863. In the \"San Francisco Kaleidoscope\", Dickson claimed he was kicked by the horse of one of the city's fire engines, but contemporary accounts say he was poisoned by being given meat laced with \"ratbane\" after biting a boy. San Franciscans put up a $50 reward for the capture of the poisoner. A wit suggested that he be buried in a place of honor alongside other great men of the city. Jump produced a cartoon of his \"Funeral\" with Norton as the Pope performing the ceremony and Freddy Coombs—another San Francisco eccentric who claimed to be the reincarnation of George Washington—digging the grave. Notable San Franciscans formed the cortège and Bummer looked on mournfully. This may have led to the rumor that large numbers of San Franciscans turned out for Lazarus' funeral. The dog was not buried though, but stuffed by a taxidermist and displayed behind the bar in Martin's saloon. (According to Dickson, Martin paid the taxidermist $50 to turn the dog over—even though its remains had already been claimed by the city council.) The \"Daily Evening Bulletin\" featured a long obituary entitled \"Lament for Lazarus\" in which they praised the virtues of both dogs and recounted their various adventures together.\n\nBummer continued alone, although Mark Twain reported a year later in the \"Daily Morning Call\" that he had taken a small black puppy under his wing. Nothing more was heard of the puppy and without his companion, Lazarus, Bummer was of less interest to the press. He died a lingering death in November 1865 after being kicked by a drunk, Henry Rippey. Bummer was still popular enough that, to avoid violence, the city immediately arrested Rippey. He also did not escape popular justice: on learning of his crime, his cellmate, David Popley, \"popped him in the smeller\".\n\nBummer's passing did not make the headlines in the same way that Lazarus' death had, but Jump created a new cartoon showing him lying in state while Lazarus tucked into a table of food in the ether above him and rats paid their respects. Mark Twain produced a eulogy for him in the \"Virginia City Enterprise\" which was reprinted in the \"Californian\" on 11 November 1865:\n\nBummer was also mounted by the taxidermist and placed on display. In 1906, both specimens were donated to the Golden Gate Park museum (now the M. H. de Young Memorial Museum) where they remained in storage until they were destroyed in 1910.\n\nOn 28 March 1992, a brass plaque commemorating the two dogs was placed at Transamerica Redwood Park, a small park adjacent to the base of the Transamerica Pyramid.\n\n"}

The model is regarded as Kline's most significant contribution.\n\nIn the chain-linked model, new knowledge is not necessarily the driver for innovation. Instead, the process begins with the identification of an unfilled market need.

Mr. Cowart is an American attorney noted for the ethical issues raised by efforts to sustain his life against his wishes following an accident in which he suffered severe and disabling burns over most of his body. His case is often cited in discussions of medical ethics.\n\nIn 1973 Cowart, then a 25-year-old Air Force reserve pilot, visited with his father a tract of land his father was considering for purchase. The land lay in a small valley and, unbeknownst to the Cowarts, a gas leak had filled the area with heavier-than-air propane gas. When the two men started their car the propane was ignited, severely burning them. Cowart's father died.\n\nMr. Cowart's burn injuries included loss of both hands, eyes, and ears, and two-thirds of his skin area.

After consulting with several specialists, he decided to have it treated via surgery. The surgery was performed at the Santa María Clinic in Santiago on November 18, 1981 by a team of three surgeons: Dr Augusto Larraín Orrego, Dr Patricio Silva Garín, and Dr Ivo Eterovic. At the time, Dr Larrain was a world-renowned gastric surgeon, as well as a cousin of Andrés Zaldívar, one of Frei's closest advisers.\n\nThe initial surgery was considered a success and, after a few days, Frei was discharged to continue his recovery at his home. However, Frei began experiencing fever and pain a few days later and was readmitted to the Santa María Clinic on 4 December. After a complete check, he was diagnosed with an intestinal occlusion and a partial necrosis of the small intestine. He underwent a second (corrective) surgery on 6 December, this time performed by Dr. Patricio Silva Garín.\n\nDespite another initial bout of improvement over the next several days, Frei's health once again severely deteriorated and he was found to be suffering from septic shock and septicaemia. After suffering a complete immune system collapse, Frei died on January 22, 1982. \n\nAt the time, his death was attributed to an infection by \"candida albicans\", contracted either during surgery or due to hospital contamination. He was buried in the Cementerio General de Santiago.\n\nFrei's death is a matter of controversy due to allegations that he was poisoned by the DINA, the intelligence service of the military government, allegedly using a toxin produced by biochemist Eugenio Berrios. After Belgian researchers from the University of Ghent reportedly found biological remnants of mustard gas in Frei's body, the former president's family filed a lawsuit, which is still pending as of 2009. \n\nFrei's personal doctor, Patricio Rojas, who was also his minister of Interior and minister of defense during Eduardo Frei Ruiz-Tagle's administration, has denied the accusations. El Mercurio columnist Hermógenes Pérez de Arce disputes even the existence of the Belgian report, citing the denial by the University's chief of communications, Tom de Smedt, that an investigation had been done in that university.\n\nIn December 2009, six persons were arrested for their roles in the alleged assassination of Frei. \n\nJudge Alejandro Madrid based his decision on a report that determined that Frei was administered low doses of thallium and mustard gas over an extended period while he was hospitalized at the Santa María Clinic in Santiago and that these toxic substances had the effect of decreasing Frei's immune system, making him too weak to survive his surgery\". \n\nNonetheless, the report has been widely criticized on scientific basis as well as by the medical team that participated in the surgery. The Appeals Court attempted to suspend Judge Madrid from the case, while the accused were set free on bail. However, the case re-opened in 2010 after a failed attempt to disqualify Judge Madrid. \n\nIn April 2013, the body of poet Pablo Neruda, who died in the same hospital one day before departing for exile, was exhumed amid suspicious of foul play in his death.\n\n\nOn October 10, 2014, two of the accused were found guilty as perpetrators, two were deemed accomplices, and the other two were found guilty of covering up the operation.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Milošević died a few months before the verdict was due for his four-year trial. It occurred shortly after the Tribunal rejected his request to seek specialized medical treatment at a cardiology clinic in Moscow, but the report of 30 May 2006 confirmed that he had died of natural causes and that there was \"no poison or other chemical substance found in his body that contributed to the death\".\n\nMilošević was found dead in his cell on 11 March 2006 in the UN war crimes tribunal's detention centre in the Scheveningen section of The Hague. An official in the chief prosecutor's office said that Milošević had been found at about 10 a.m. and had apparently been dead for several hours. His trial had been due to resume on 14 March with testimony from the former president of Montenegro, Momir Bulatović. A request for the autopsy in the presence of a Serbian pathologist was granted, and his body was transported to the Dutch Forensic Institute.\n\nIt was established that Milošević died of a heart attack. Suspicions have been voiced:\n\nMilošević had been suffering from heart problems and high blood pressure. Initially, the Dutch coroner failed to establish the cause of his death. Consequently, the president of the ICTY ordered an autopsy and a toxicological investigation. Immediately after his death was announced, rumours that Milošević had been poisoned started circulating.\n\nAn autopsy was held in the Netherlands; its preliminary results found that Milošević had died of myocardial infarction, the scientific term for a heart attack. The Tribunal warned that it was impossible to rule out poisoning at the time of their statement, as the toxicological tests had not been completed. The Tribunal had denied Milošević's request for travel to Russia for specialist medical treatment. He planned to appeal against this decision, saying that his condition was worsening. Shortly before his death, Milošević complained about wrong medical treatment to Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov. The Russian Foreign Ministry confirmed that it received the letter from Milošević with his medical complaints. In the letter as provided by Milošević's lawyer Zdenko Tomanović, Milošević complained that he was being given a drug used against tuberculosis and leprosy, and that it was done in secrecy and without him (Milošević) knowing anything about it. In his hand written letter to Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, Milošević said he never used any drugs on his own, nor he was ill and in need to take medicines: \n\nMilošević complained, in the same letter, that even though the medical report containing information about the fact the drug against leprosy was found in his blood dated from 12 January, he had only found out and received the report four days earlier before his death. The same was reported later by former pro-Milošević Montenegrin President Momir Bulatović, who was due to testify for Milošević's defence. According to Bulatović, Milošević had stopped taking the drug and consequently was afraid of being poisoned. In his letter, Milošević motivated his desire to be treated in Russia (by \"Russian physicians, who rank among the most respected physicians in the world\"), saying that: \n\nLawyer Zdenko Tomanović told reporters that his client had feared Milošević was being poisoned and cited the aforementioned letter, as well as the medical report two months before his death, according to which Milošević's blood contained rifampicin - a drug that is normally used to treat leprosy and tuberculosis and which would have neutralized some of the effects of Milošević's medicines for his high blood pressure and heart condition. Tomanović said he had made a formal request for the autopsy to take place in Moscow. The Tribunal rejected the request, allowing instead a pathologist from Serbia to attend the autopsy. In his statement, Tomanović said: \"I demanded protection for Slobodan Milošević over his claims that he was being poisoned. I still haven't received any reply and that's all I have to say at this time.\"\n\nDutch toxicologist Donald Uges confirmed that the drug had been found in Milošević's blood and suggested that he may have deliberately taken these drugs in order to get out of jail and seek medical treatment in Russia, where Milošević's widow, Mirjana Marković, and son, Marko, were still living in exile. Likewise, sources at the Tribunal stated that Milošević had regular access to unprescribed drugs that were smuggled into his cell under a lax prison regime. Timothy McFadden, the prison governor responsible for Milošević, is reported to have complained, in vain, in December and January that he could no longer monitor drugs taken by the former leader. Milošević has the key to his own office, which had a fax machine, a computer and a telephone, and access to a private \"comfort room\" for visits by his wife.\n\nThe Tribunal confirmed that preliminary results of blood tests shows there is no indication that Milošević's death by heart attack was caused by poisoning. Judge Fausto Pocar, president of the UN war crimes tribunal, told a news conference: \"So far no indications of poisoning have been found. I would like to stress that these are provisional results.\" Tribunal registrar Hans Holthuis confirmed that traces of rifampicin were found in an earlier 12 January blood test. However, Pocar said that there are no traces of the drug were found at the time of Milošević's death. According to The Hague, district public prosecutor Moraal, referring to the NFI/Dutch Forensic Institute, \"rifampicin disappears from the body quickly, and the fact that no traces were found implies only that it is not likely that rifampicin had been ingested or administered in the last few days before death\".\n\nLeo Bokeria, Director of Moscow's Bakulev Heart Surgery Center, confirmed that Milošević had died of a heart attack, but said adequate treatment in Moscow or in any one of many countries, including the Netherlands, would have rescued him. According to Bokeria, the necessary medical procedures (coronary angiography and stenting) were \"elementary\". Bokeria said he saw \"nothing showing signs of suicide\", but there remained questions over whether Milošević received adequate care while standing trial at the U.N. tribunal. \n\nBokeria also claimed that the center had sent Pocar a letter informing him that Milošević needed hospital treatment and naming several countries beside Russia where that could be done. \"The Times\"' medical columnist Thomas Stuttaford commented that, taking into account what had been known about Milošević's health condition for years, he was \"surprised that he (Milošević) lived for as long as he did\". According to Stuttaford, given the data that existed, Milošević should have been considered for a coronary bypass or angioplasty; while these operations might be rendered impossible by severe heart defects, that can only be established by a careful analysis of the heart, and one would have thought that if this had been done, someone would have mentioned it. According to Stuttaford, using rifampicin might have been a cunning way to kill a man that needs no expertise.\n\nThe conclusions of the Dutch investigation into Milošević's death were finally announced. Investigators concluded that Milošević had died of natural causes, and final toxicological studies had confirmed there were no traces of poisoning or substances which could have triggered the heart attack. Tribunal prosecutors also announced that although non-prescribed medicines had been found in Milošević's cell three months earlier, there is no such medicines were found in his cell on the day he died. The president of the UN Yugoslav war crimes tribunal welcomed the final report that formally closed the Dutch investigation, but he said that the Tribunal will continue to investigate the medical treatment Milošević had received during his five-year detention.\n\nICTY Chief Prosecutor Carla Del Ponte deplored Milošević's death, saying that it had \"deprived victims of justice\". Concerning the causes of Milošević's death, she concluded that suicide could not be ruled out and declined to comment on speculation that Milošević may have been poisoned. In an interview with the Rome newspaper, \"La Repubblica\", Del Ponte stated:\n\nIn Serbia, tens of thousands of Milošević's supporters criticized the Tribunal for allegedly being more or less responsible for his death. Members of his Socialist Party advisors were particularly harsh - for example, senior official Ivica Dačić said that \"Milošević did not die in The Hague, he was killed in The Hague\". President Boris Tadić, who was an opponent of Milošević and the Socialist Party, said that in his opinion the U.N. war crimes tribunal was responsible for Milošević's death, but he added that it would not hamper Serbia's future cooperation with the court.\n\nMost notable was a letter Marko Milošević, son of Slobodan Milošević, sent to The President of the ICTY, The Chairman of the Security Council of the OUN, The Secretary General of the OUN, and to Judge Parker who led the investigation into Slobodan Milošević's death. In his letter, Marko Milošević accuses the Hague Tribunal for negligence and for the death of his father.\nIn one part of the letter, Milošević agrees that his father was not poisoned and accuses the ICTY for being misleading:\nMarko Milošević then continues about the logic of the investigation into his father's death:\nThe Milošević family raised questions about the legitimacy of the ICTY conducted investigation:\n\nMarko Milošević then concludes that the ICTY is playing on \"straw man\" policy:\n\nMarko Milošević doubted the intentions of the ICTY:\n\nAs (one of the) conclusion(s), Marko Milošević offers:\n\nThere was a strong controversy across Serbia regarding on Milošević's funeral, as the Socialist Party and nationalist leaders demanded that it should be state-sponsored and high-profile. In particular, it was argued that Milošević ought to have a prominent resting place in the \"Alley of the Greats,\" where other Serbian leaders are buried, which the Tribunal rejected such requests. As a result, the Socialist Party threatened to withdraw its support, which was essential for the ruling coalition. Finally, the Tribunal decided that Milošević should have a private burial in his hometown, Požarevac. Nevertheless, a farewell ceremony was organised by the Socialist Party outside the federal parliament in Belgrade. About 50,000 of Milošević's supporters attended the ceremony, which turned into a mass demonstration, with a succession of fiery speeches by prominent supporters. Afterwards, Milošević's coffin was taken to his hometown for burial in the backyard of his family home. Milošević's family and close friends pulled out of his funeral, citing anonymous threats and contradictory statements from Serbian authorities regarding the requested guarantees that they would not be arrested. Milošević's daughter Mirjana stated that the Socialist Party had hijacked the funeral for political ends.\n\n"}

{"id": "1347945", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1347945", "title": "Great Filter", "text": "Great Filter\n\nThe Great Filter, in the context of the Fermi paradox, is whatever prevents dead matter from undergoing abiogenesis, in time, to expanding lasting life as measured by the Kardashev scale. The concept originates in Robin Hanson's argument that the failure to find any extraterrestrial civilizations in the observable universe implies the possibility something is wrong with one or more of the arguments from various scientific disciplines that the appearance of advanced intelligent life is probable; this observation is conceptualized in terms of a \"Great Filter\" which acts to reduce the great number of sites where intelligent life might arise to the tiny number of intelligent species with advanced civilizations actually observed (currently just one: human). This probability threshold, which could lie behind us (in our past) or in front of us (in our future), might work as a barrier to the evolution of intelligent life, or as a high probability of self-destruction. The main counter-intuitive conclusion of this observation is that the easier it was for life to evolve to our stage, the bleaker our future chances probably are.\n\nThe idea was first proposed in an online essay titled \"The Great Filter - Are We Almost Past It?\", written by economist Robin Hanson. The first version was written in August 1996 and the article was last updated on September 15, 1998. Since that time, Hanson's formulation has received recognition in several published sources discussing the Fermi paradox and its implications.\n\nUsing extinct civilizations such as Easter Island as models, a study conducted in 2018 posited that climate change induced by \"energy intensive\" civilizations may prevent sustainability within such civilizations, thus explaining the lack of evidence for intelligent extraterrestrial life.\n\nThere is no reliable evidence aliens have visited Earth and we have observed no intelligent extraterrestrial life with current technology nor has SETI found any transmissions from other civilizations. The Universe, apart from the Earth, seems \"dead\"; Hanson states:\n\nOur planet and solar system, however, don't look substantially colonized by advanced competitive life from the stars, and neither does anything else we see. To the contrary, we have had great success at explaining the behavior of our planet and solar system, nearby stars, our galaxy, and even other galaxies, via simple \"dead\" physical processes, rather than the complex purposeful processes of advanced life.\n\nWith no evidence of intelligent life other than ourselves, it appears that the process of starting with a star and ending with \"advanced explosive lasting life\" must be unlikely. This implies that at least one step in this process must be improbable. Hanson's list, while incomplete, describes the following nine steps in an \"evolutionary path\" that results in the colonization of the observable universe:\n\n\nAccording to the Great Filter hypothesis at least one of these steps—if the list were complete—must be improbable. If it's not an early step (i.e., in our past), then the implication is that the improbable step lies in our future and our prospects of reaching step 9 (interstellar colonization) are still bleak. If the past steps are likely, then many civilizations would have developed to the current level of the human species. However, none appear to have made it to step 9, or the Milky Way would be full of colonies. So perhaps step 9 is the unlikely one, and the only thing that appears likely to keep us from step 9 is some sort of catastrophe or resource exhaustion leading to the impossibility of making the step due to consumption of the available resources (like for example highly constrained energy resources). So by this argument, finding multicellular life on Mars (provided it evolved independently) would be bad news, since it would imply steps 2–6 are easy, and hence only 1, 7, 8 or 9 (or some unknown step) could be the big problem.\n\nAlthough steps 1–8 have occurred on Earth, any one of these may be unlikely. If the first seven steps are necessary preconditions to calculating the likelihood (using the local environment) then an anthropically biased observer can infer nothing about the general probabilities from its (pre-determined) surroundings.\n\nThere are many alternative scenarios that might allow for the evolution of intelligent life to occur multiple times without either catastrophic self-destruction or glaringly visible evidence. These are possible resolutions to the Fermi paradox: \"They do exist, but we see no evidence\". Other ideas include: it is too expensive to spread physically throughout the galaxy, Earth is purposely isolated, it is dangerous to communicate and hence civilizations actively hide, among others.\n\nAs one example, astronomer Seth Shostak of the SETI Institute argues that one can postulate a galaxy filled with intelligent extraterrestrial civilizations that have failed to colonize the Earth. Perhaps the aliens lacked the intent and purpose to colonize or depleted their resources, or maybe the galaxy \"is\" colonized but in a heterogeneous manner, or the Earth could be located in a \"galactic backwater\". Although absence of evidence generally is only weak evidence of absence, the absence of extraterrestrial megascale engineering projects, for example, might point to the Great Filter at work. Does this mean that one of the steps leading to intelligent life is unlikely? According to Shostak:\n\nThis is, of course, a variant on the Fermi paradox: We don't see clues to widespread, large-scale engineering, and consequently we must conclude that we're alone. But the possibly flawed assumption here is when we say that highly visible construction projects are an inevitable outcome of intelligence. It could be that it's the engineering of the small, rather than the large, that is inevitable. This follows from the laws of inertia (smaller machines are faster, and require less energy to function) as well as the speed of light (small computers have faster internal communication). It may be—and this is, of course, speculation—that advanced societies are building small technology and have little incentive or need to rearrange the stars in their neighborhoods, for instance. They may prefer to build nanobots instead. It should also be kept in mind that, as Arthur C. Clarke said, truly advanced engineering would look like magic to us—or be unrecognizable altogether. By the way, we've only just begun to search for things like Dyson spheres, so we can't really rule them out.\n\n"}

An archetype of inbreeding is self-pollination. When a plant has both anthers and a stigma, the process of inbreeding can occur. Another word for this self-fertilization is autogamy, which is when an anther releases pollen to attach to the stigma on the same plant. Self-pollination is promoted by homogamy. Homogamy is when the anthers and the stigma of a flower are being matured at the same time. The action of self-pollination guides the plant to homozygosity, causing a specific gene to be received from each of the parents leading to the possession of two exact formats of that gene.\n\nAssortative mating is the choosing of a mate to breed with based on their physical characteristics, phenotypical traits. There are social factors that enhance one's choosing, such as religion, physical traits, and culture. For instance, research has been conducted by sociologists who found that men and women look for individuals who fall under the educational homogamy he or she is in. The homogamy theory holds that when organisms look for a potential partner, they search for organisms that have similar traits to themselves. The idea of sexual imprinting plays a role in this theory. Based on whether or not an individual is a male or a female, the individual tends to be attracted to other people that have most similar characteristics to their parent of the opposite gender. This is a form of positive assortative mating, where people choose a mate with attributes that correlate with their own. According to Kalmijn and Flap, there are five places individuals could become acquainted with each other in. These five places are: work, school, neighborhood, common family networks, and voluntary associations. They also studied the five criteria that are usually looked for to decide on the status of wanting to mate. As such, the five traits are: age, education, class destinations, class origins, and religious background.\n\nThere is a evolutionary theory that explain that there are two specific qualities that are looked out. These two traits are male dominance and the attractiveness of the female. According to the evolutionary perspective, the purpose of mating is to procreate for the purpose of survival. It is the ones with the best features and traits that survive, a known phrase called survival of the fittest. If there was a couple who lacked the ability to become fertile or have a child with a disease or a handicap, there is a great rise in the risk of the couple receiving a divorce. When there are traits that are found in a spouse that are not favorable, then the homogamy in the relationship decreases, and there begins to have a need for it for a better production of children.\n"}

{"id": "10381173", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10381173", "title": "Lightning Over Water", "text": "Lightning Over Water\n\nLightning Over Water is a 1980 documentary film by Wim Wenders and Nicholas Ray about the last days of Ray's own life; the director was most famous for his 1955 film \"Rebel Without a Cause\". It was screened out of competition at the 1980 Cannes Film Festival.\n\nThe film is a collaboration between Wenders and Ray to document Ray's last days due to terminal cancer in 1979. The film is partially an homage to Ray who had a strong influence on Wenders' work, and partially an investigation on life and death. Ray's influence on Wenders includes Ray's \"love on the run\" subgenre as well as his \"film noir\" photography. \n\nThe film features excerpts from Ray's movies \"The Lusty Men\" and his unfinished final work \"We Can't Go Home Again\". The sequence featuring the former excerpt was shot at Vassar College, at which Ray presented the movie and then gave a lecture, which itself is excerpted.\n\nNicholas Ray appears in a minor role in Wenders' film \"The American Friend\". Wenders' science fiction film \"Until the End of the World\" is named for the last spoken words in Ray's 1961 Biblical epic film \"King of Kings\".\n\nThe film crew is extensively featured onscreen. Jim Jarmusch, Ray's personal assistant at the time — and later a notable film director in his own right — can be briefly glimpsed at the 50:28 mark sitting at an editing console.\n\nWhen Wenders goes to the Vassar campus to attend a lecture, a brief one-man performance is seen on-stage. It is Franz Kafka's story \"A Report for an Academy\", about an ape who becomes a man.\n\nThe American independent film director Jon Jost has recently come out against Wenders' status as the sole co-director, saying that Wenders \"used his celebrity\" to push Jost and Raúl Ruiz (director) out of the project that they had been the creators of.\n\n"}

This article primarily discusses different models used by genocide scholars to explain and predict the onset of mass killing events.\n\nAccording to Weiss-Wendt, any attempts to develop a universally accepted terminology describing mass killings of non-combatants was a complete failure Below are listed the terms used by genocide scholars to describe mass killings.\n\n\nBenjamen Valentino, who sees ruler's motives as the key factor explaining the onset of mass killings, outlines two major category of mass killings, dispossessive mass killings and coercive mass killings. The first category included ethnic cleansing, killings that accompany agrarian reforms in some states led by communists, mass killings during colonial expansion, etc. The second category includes mass killings during counter-guerilla warfare, killings during the Axis imperialist conquests during the World War II, etc. Although Valentino does not consider ideology or regime type as an important factor that explains mass killings, he outlines communist mass killings as a subtype of dispossessive mass killings, which is considered as a complication of original theory his book is based on.\n\nTwo global databases of mass killings are currently available. The first compilation, by Rudolph Rummel, covers a time period from the beginning of the 20th century till 1977, and the second compilation, by Barbara Harff, combines all mass killing events since 1955. The Harff database is the most frequently used by genocide scholars. These data are intended mostly for statistical analysis of mass killings in attempt to identify the best predictors for their onset. According to Harff, these data are not necessarily the most accurate for a given country, since some sources are general genocide scholars and not experts on local history. A comparative analysis of these two databases revealed a significant difference between the figures of killed per years and low correlation between Rummel's and Harff's data sets. Tomislav Dulić criticized Rummel's generally higher numbers as arising from flaws in Rummel's statistical methodology.\n\nThis list does not include deaths from the Great Chinese Famine and Great Leap Forward.\n\nThe term \"mass killing\" was proposed by genocide scholars in attempts to collect a uniform global database of genocidal events and identify statistical models for prediction of onset of mass killings.\n\nFrank Wayman and Atsushi Tago use the term \"mass killing\" as defined by Valentino, and they concluded that, even with a lower threshold (10,000 killed per year, 1,000 killed per year, or even 1), \"autocratic regimes, especially communist, are prone to mass killing generically, but not so strongly inclined (i.e. not statistically significantly inclined) toward geno-politicide.\n\n"}
{"id": "22044082", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=22044082", "title": "Mitchell Johnson and Andrew Golden", "text": "Mitchell Johnson and Andrew Golden\n\nMitchell Scott Johnson (born August 11, 1984) and Andrew Douglas Golden (born May 25, 1986) are former middle school students and the 13 and 11 year old perpetrators, respectively, of the March 24, 1998 massacre at Westside Middle School in unincorporated Craighead County, Arkansas near the city of Jonesboro. Johnson and Golden fatally shot four students and a teacher with multiple weapons, and both were arrested when they attempted to flee the scene. Ten others were wounded in the shooting. Both Golden and Johnson were charged with the five murders and 10 injuries that were caused by the shooting, and were imprisoned until each turned 21 years of age.\n\nMitchell Scott Johnson was born in Grand Meadow, Minnesota to Gretchen and Scott Johnson. When Mitchell was seven, his parents divorced, and he and his brother moved with their mother to Jonesboro, Arkansas. His mother soon remarried to Terry Woodward, an inmate at the prison where she was a guard. Johnson had a good relationship with his stepfather and brother, and adults who remembered him described him as being quiet and respectful. He was a former member of the Central Baptist Church youth choir, later joining the youth group at the Revival Tabernacle Church, in Jonesboro.\n\nFollowing the shooting, Johnson's attorney claimed that he had been sexually abused when he was 6 and 7 years by a \"family member of the day care where he was placed.\" One year prior to the shooting, 12-year-old Mitchell was charged with molesting a 3-year-old girl while visiting southern Minnesota with his family. However, the record of the case was expunged because of Mitchell's age.\n\nAndrew Douglas Golden was born and raised in Jonesboro to Jacqueline and Dennis Golden. By all accounts, he came from a stable household, having a good relationship with both his parents, and he regularly visited his grandparents and great-grandmother. Both of his parents worked as postal workers, and his paternal grandfather, Douglas Golden, was a wildlife conservation officer in Jonesboro. He was raised to be familiar with firearms and their use at an early age; he was given his first firearm by his father when he was six years old.\n\nJohnson and Golden were both students at Westside Middle School. They met and became friends on a school bus that they rode home from school. Together, they were known to bully other students, and people recalled Johnson talking of wanting to belong to the Bloods and smoke marijuana. The Texaco truck stop was a popular hang-out for youths in Jonesboro, and adolescents there remember Johnson claiming to belong to street gangs. He also spoke of \"having a lot of killing to do\" and his classmates also commented that he had a fascination with firearms. He had particularly threatened to kill sixth-grader Candace Porter, his former girlfriend who ended their relationship.\nGolden was a sixth grader at the school, where schoolmates said he displayed troublesome behavior. He would often engage other students in fist fights and use profane language. A classmate accused him of killing her cat with a BB gun.\n\nThree months prior to the incident, one of the students reported to a school counsellor that Golden had stated he intended to shoot some people at the school. When Golden was called to the counselor, he stated that he had a nightmare in which he followed through and then was killed, scaring him off the plan. Near the end of the school day on March 23, 1998, the day before the massacre, Johnson talked to his sister Jennifer, warning her not to come to school the next day, as Johnson heard that something bad was going to happen. The day before the massacre Golden told friends he had \"a lot of killing to do\" and suggested to them that they would know the next day whether they were destined to live or die.\n\nOn the night before the shooting, Golden assisted Johnson in loading his mother's Dodge Caravan with camping supplies, snack foods, nine weapons (Remington 742 .30-06 rifle, Universal .30 M1 carbine replica, Ruger .44 Magnum rifle, Smith & Wesson .38 revolver, Double Deuce Buddie .22 two-shot derringer, FIE .380 pistol, Star .380 pistol, Ruger Security Six .357 revolver, Davis Industries .38 two-shot derringer, and a Charter Arms .38 revolver), which had been stolen from Golden's grandfather's house, and 2000 rounds of ammunition. \n\nThe following morning, the boys drove in the van to Westside Middle School, arriving late after feigning illnesses to get out of school. As they arrived, Golden pulled the fire alarm just after 12:30 pm, during the beginning of fifth period, while Johnson took the weapons to the woods outside of the school. Golden then ran back to the woods where Johnson had taken the weapons. When children and teachers filed out of the school, the two boys opened fire, with officials stating that the shooting began at 12:41 pm. During the incident many became confused initially with reports of shouting of \"It's all fake\", as friends of wounded tried to evacuate their friends and teacher Shannon Watts used her body to protect a wounded student. Another teacher had been checking students off on her class list, when she heard pops, \"like firecrackers\" and thought it was an ill-advised attempt to frighten the kids, to potentially make them take the drill seriously. A student reported that the sounds were at first dismissed by some as construction workers had been working on the new fifth-grade building nearby.\n\nStudents who had initially evacuated for the drill, were brought back into the school's gymnasium, where students could hear the bullets ricocheting off the outside bricks and walls. Some victims were brought back inside by uninjured students and teachers, after a teacher opened the doors from the inside as they had automatically locked due to the fire alarm. A student who had sought shelter in the school, told a teacher with them that they believed the shooter was Mitchell Johnson, as they had been told by him not to come to school that day. \n\nThe boys killed four female students and one teacher and wounded ten others. All ten of those injured survived their injuries. Golden and Johnson attempted to run back to the van and escape, but police captured them. The shooters were apprehended about 10 minutes after the shooting began, according to a Lieutenant with the Jonesboro Police Department. The boys evidently planned to run away, as they had food, sleeping bags, and survival gear in their van.\n\nAs the incident was the third fatal multiple shooting at an American school since October 1997; following the Pearl High School shooting and the Heath High shooting, then President Clinton ordered Attorney General Janet Reno to organize experts on school violence to analyze the recent incidents, determine what they may have had in common and what steps could be taken to reduce the chance of a similar incident.\n\nWhite ribbons were tied on tree trunks, and other objects in memory of the victims. The school installed a memorial bench outside the school that is carved with the date of the massacre, and a sundial memorial, installed in a park area behind the school, is engraved with the names of the victims. The park area was designed as a memorial park, based around the number 5 to commemorate the 5 dead victims, with five trees, with five picnic tables, and five stepping-stones, along with the sundial.\n\nDuring the trial, Johnson hung his head and read a letter of apology he had written to victims' families. He said he had not been targeting anyone. \"We were not going to shoot at anyone in particular,\" he said. \"I really thought we would scare them. I am sorry. I hope anyone who listens to these words knows how truly sorry I am.\"\n\nWhile in detention awaiting trial, Johnson wrote a letter that stated: \"Hi. My name is Mitchell. My thoughts and prayers are with those people who were killed, or shot, and their families. I am really sad inside about everything. My thoughts and prayers are with those kids that I go to school with. I really want people to know the real Mitchell someday. Sincerely, Mitchell Johnson.\"\n\nDue to their age, they were tried as juveniles, and were found guilty of five counts of murder. Following their convictions, Johnson and Golden were taken by National Guard helicopter to Alexander, Arkansas, so they could be placed at the Arkansas Juvenile Assessment & Treatment Center (AJATC), the Arkansas Department of Human Services Youth Services Division's juvenile facility and the state's most secure juvenile facility.\n\nThe two youths were among the youngest people ever charged with murder in U.S. history. The Jonesboro prosecutor later stated that were it not for their ages, he would have sought a death sentence for the pair. In August 1998, both boys were sentenced to confinement until they reached the age of 21, which is the maximum sentence available under Arkansas law. They would have served until only age 18 had federal authorities not added additional confinement for weapons charges. Judge Ralph Wilson commented, \"This is a case where the punishment will not fit the crime.\" The case led to wide public outcry for tougher sentencing laws pertaining to juvenile offenders.\n\nJohnson was released on his 21st birthday, August 11, 2005, having spent seven years in prison.\n\nGolden was released on May 25, 2007, also his 21st birthday, after spending nine years in prison. Golden's whereabouts were unknown until he applied for a concealed weapon permit in Arkansas on October 7, 2008, under the name he now uses, Drew Douglas Grant. His application was denied by the Arkansas State Police, who noted that Golden had lied on the application about his previous residences and declared it was illegal for Golden to own or possess a firearm. The assumed name that Golden was using had been unknown up until this point due to a gag order, but police were able to tie Andrew Golden to Grant through fingerprint records during the background check for the permit.\n\nGolden completed his civil case deposition on May 6, 2008.\n\nOn January 1, 2007, Johnson was arrested by the ATF after a traffic stop in Fayetteville, Arkansas on misdemeanor charges of carrying a weapon, a loaded 9 mm pistol, and possession of 21.2 g of marijuana. Though the van that Johnson was riding in was registered to him, the driver was 22-year-old Justin Trammell. Trammell and Johnson reportedly met at Alexander Youth Services Correctional Facility in Alexander, Arkansas, where Trammell was incarcerated after pleading guilty to the 1999 crossbow murder of his father, a crime committed when Trammell was 15. The pair were roommates and provided officers with the same Fayetteville address. Trammell was cited for careless driving and released. Johnson was arrested for possession of marijuana and a loaded weapon and later released on a $1,000 bond. He appeared in court on January 26, 2007 at the Washington County, Arkansas courthouse.\n\nJohnson was indicted by a federal grand jury on October 24, 2007 for possession of a firearm while either using or addicted to a controlled substance. The US Attorney's Office for the Western District of Arkansas reported that Johnson pleaded not guilty and was released on a $5,000 bond. Johnson's trial began on January 28, 2008. After two days of testimony from the prosecution and the defense witnesses, Johnson was found guilty on a charge of possessing a weapon while being a drug user. In February 2008, just days after his conviction, Johnson was arrested again, now for possession of marijuana at the convenience store he worked at and on suspicion of using a stolen credit card.\n\nOn September 2008, US District Judge Jimm Larry Hendren sentenced Mitchell Johnson to four years in prison on the weapon and drug charges. During his sentencing, the judge expressed dismay that Johnson had not taken advantage of the chance he had to go straight. He told him, \"No matter your sentence, you still have a life; those killed in 1998 do not.\" On October 7, 2008, Johnson pleaded guilty to a felony theft charge and misdemeanor possession of marijuana. Johnson admitted that he stole a debit card left by a disabled man at the Bentonville gas station where he worked and subsequently used it to purchase a meal at a local Burger King. He also admitted that at the time he was arrested, he was in possession of marijuana. On November 14, 2008, Johnson, now 24 years old, was sentenced to 12 years in prison for the theft charge and misdemeanor possession charges. Although Johnson could have faced up to 30 years, the sentence of 12 years was chosen because Johnson technically had no criminal record from the Jonesboro shooting.\n\nOn January 23, 2009, Johnson was sentenced to six additional years in prison for an additional charge of theft by receiving and financial identity fraud for using the stolen card to purchase a meal from a local Burger King. Circuit Judge William Storey told Johnson, \"You continue to run afoul of the law. I am hopeful this is the last time.\" That brought Johnson's combined state sentences to 18 years. In February 2010, the Arkansas Supreme Court granted Johnson leave to appeal his sentence by saying that the trial judge should not have admitted evidence of the juvenile convictions during the sentencing phase of the theft and possession trial. Johnson will have to complete his federal sentence of four years after serving his 18-year state sentence. He could have remained incarcerated well into his thirties but was eligible for parole from his Arkansas sentence in 2011, after which he served the four-year federal sentence. In February 2016, ABC News reported online that Johnson was released in July 2015 into the custody of the US Probation Office for the Southern District of Texas and placed in a drug rehabilitation program. The office did not respond to ABC News' multiple requests for comment. It was pointed out that Johnson and Golden were the only two living \"school shooters\" who were not incarcerated.\n"}

Creek's body was found in Burlington, Wisconsin not long after she ran away from a youth shelter. Creek remained unidentified for approximately one year, and it was not until April 2014 that police arrested a suspect, James Eaton, a native of Palatine. Eaton pled guilty to a reduced charge of reckless homicide in late 2016.\n\nAmber Gail Creek was born on July 12, 1982, in Park Ridge, Illinois, and was raised in Palatine, Illinois. She was described as a normal girl by friends and family until mid-1996, when her behavior drastically changed shortly after graduating from eighth grade at junior high school. Creek began to suffer from long periods of depression that had resulted in her using drugs and alcohol, and was described as a frequent runaway. Creek's father had taken her to a local police station and requested that she be removed from his custody, and be made a ward of the state. Subsequently, after unsuccessful attempts to place her in foster care, she was placed in a group home. It is also believed that Creek began to practice prostitution for an income. Although she did not disclose her location, she did regularly speak with family members by telephone.\n\nCreek ran away from a juvenile shelter for abused and neglected children in Chicago on January 23, 1997, and was reported missing. She was last seen alive in February 1997, attending a hotel party with a group of men in Rolling Meadows, Illinois.\n\nOn February 9, 1997, Creek's frozen body was discovered by hunters in Karcher Springs State Natural Area, a nature reserve near Burlington, Wisconsin. It had been around two weeks after she had been reported missing, and it was believed she had been murdered at a different location, which has never been identified, and then disposed of at the nature reserve.\n\nCreek was found with a plastic garbage bag around her head, which was used to kill her by asphyxiation. She had been extensively physically abused, including being beaten and raped, slashed in the facial area, and bitten on the neck causing compression which played a role in her death. The word \"hi\" was written on the girl's palm, which was raised in an upward position. A price tag from a bookstore was observed to have been present on one of her arms. She wore few clothes, as some were likely removed in the process of the assault, including her jacket and backpack containing personal items. Her underwear was later discovered inside of her pants pocket. A possible explanation to why some of her belongings were not found at the scene is that the murderer may have taken souvenirs. Authorities surmise that Creek may have been murdered by someone that may have received prostitution services from her.\n\nAround one hundred Wisconsin inhabitants attended the then-unidentified victim's funeral where she was buried in a donated casket. Initially, Creek was buried in a grave that read \"Jane Doe\" due to the fact that her identity was not yet known. Afterwards, she was later reburied and a new headstone was created that bore her name and lifespan.\n\nPolice reportedly spent thousands of hours comparing DNA, dental records and fingerprints to many different missing person cases. Consequently, it was not until June 26, 1998 when her body was positively identified, through DNA and dental comparison over a year after her death. After viewing the television show \"America's Most Wanted\" that aired in December 1998, which documented the case, Creek's father had notified police that he suspected that the body belonged to his daughter. When Creek had first vanished, she was not reported missing for five weeks, as her history of running away had prevented investigation. After the identification, laws in the state were changed to prevent an issue like this from happening again.\n\nIn October 2013, an Oklahoma crime lab began re-examining fingerprints taken from scenes of unsolved murders. In February 2014, Creek's case was reopened; examiners in an Oklahoma crime lab were able to match a thumbprint on the garbage bag concealing the body to James Paul Eaton, a 36-year-old divorced man. Eaton was nineteen at the time of the murder and lived in Palatine, Illinois, the same town as Creek. One of the men seen with Amber in early February 1997 bore a strong resemblance to Eaton. Eaton's fingerprints were not on record at the time of the murder, recorded only in 2000 after his arrest for possession of drug paraphernalia. Investigators located the suspect in Chicago, and on March 22 collected discarded cigarette butts to match his DNA to that found at the crime scene. Eaton was subsequently arrested in early April and is currently incarcerated in Racine, Wisconsin. Authorities also looked through his computer, Facebook profile and phone, as well as searching his residence for possible souvenirs from the scene, as some of Amber's belongings had been suspected to have been taken by her killer.\n\nPolice attempted to garner a confession from Eaton by showing him images of Creek when she was alive and also by showing pictures of her body after she was found.\n\nCreek's uncle, Anthony Mowers, has expressed that he believes that others may be involved in the murder, particularly in the transportation of Eaton and Amber to Wisconsin, claiming she may have believed she was being taken to her grandmother's residence that was located in the state at the time. Police have also stated that they believe there are more who know details about the crime. It has not yet been reported if the bite on the body matched Eaton's dental records, which has also led some to suspect that there have been more responsible for the victim's death. However, it has been stated that his saliva was found at the scene but has not explicitly been reported to have been on the bite area.\n\nEaton's original charges consisted of first-degree murder and concealing a body, which carried a sentence of life in prison. He pleaded not guilty to both charges at his October 2014 arraignment. The trial itself was scheduled to begin in November 2015. His defense attorney has stated that they had not been given all of the evidence available in the case, despite strong indication that he played some role in Creek's death. However, the final pretrial conference and trial were later delayed to May 31 and June 6, 2016, respectively, as the defense was attempting to locate an individual to examine the bite mark on Creek's neck as well as the DNA from the scene.\n\nA judge, convinced by Eaton's attorney, eventually ruled that information that was obtained through interrogation of Eaton after his arrest, including his reaction to Amber's photographs, could not be used in court, as police had continued to interrogate him after he requested getting a lawyer, which they did not acknowledge until his third request, on April 5, 2014. However, it was ruled that information obtained by police the next day could still be used.\n\nOn October 25, 2016, Eaton plead no contest to a reduced charge of first-degree reckless homicide. Another unnamed man is also under investigation for suspected involvement in the murder. Eaton was sentenced to 40 years with eligibility for parole after serving ten years.\n\n"}

It highlights growing environmental and ethical concerns associated with industrial livestock production.\n\nThe 501(c)(3) non-profit was established in 2004. Today, New Harvest funds university-based research to develop breakthroughs in cellular agriculture, such as new culture media formulations, bioreactors, and methods of tissue assembly for the production of cultured meat.\n\nNew Harvest organizes a yearly conference – among the first professional conferences related to cellular agriculture – where it connects scientists, entrepreneurs, and other interested parties in the biosciences and food security fields.\n\nIn 2004, New Harvest was founded by Jason Matheny to fund academic research into the use of cell cultures, instead of live animals, to grow meat. Matheny became interested in cultured meat after researching infectious diseases in India for a Master's degree in public health. In the course of his research, he toured a poultry farm outside Delhi where he saw \"tens of thousands of chickens in a metal warehouse, doped with drugs, living in their own manure and being bred for production traits that caused them to be immune-compromised.\" He said the experience made him recognize the need for a new way to meet a global demand for meat that is \"exponentially growing\" in even a traditionally vegetarian country like India.\n\nWhen Matheny returned to the States, he read about a NASA-funded project that \"grew\" goldfish meat to explore food possibilities for astronauts on long-range space missions. He contacted all 60 of the cited authors and teamed up with three—a tissue engineer, cell biologist and animal scientist—to consider the viability of producing cultured meat on a large scale. In 2005, their research was published in the journal \"Tissue Engineering\" which generated considerable public and scientific interest in New Harvest.\n\nWhen a new Executive Director, Isha Datar, was appointed in 2013, New Harvest's focus grew to include other animal commodities like milk and eggs, that could be produced by biotechnology rather than livestock. Since 2014, New Harvest has helped found two start-up companies, Muufri and Clara Foods.\n\nIsha Datar, Perumal Gandhi and Ryan Pandya (two New Harvest volunteers) founded Muufri in 2014 to produce an animal-free cow's milk via biotechnology. The start-up got seed funding from a synthetic biology accelerator program in Cork, Ireland. They are currently trying to modify yeast to synthesize casein and whey, the two key proteins in milk. Six months into research, Muufri received a $2M investment from Li-Ka-Shing's VC – Horizons Ventures. Muufri has since re-branded to Perfect Day and have raised ~$25mn in VC funding in February 2018.\n\nIsha Datar, David Anchel, and Arturo Elizondo founded Clara Foods in February 2015 to develop a chickenless egg white. The company participated in the Indie.Bio accelerator program in San Francisco, California. Clara Foods is working to produce an egg white that is cholesterol-free and salmonella-free, while using lower land and water inputs and available at a reduced cost.\n\nIsha Datar\n\nDatar holds a BSc. in Cell & Molecular Biology from the University of Alberta, where she contributed to Canada's first cultured meat laboratory, and an M.Biotech from the University of Toronto. Datar said she was inspired by a meat science course to explore the environmental consequences of livestock production.

It is a very sensitive test and is often used for determining the nutritional requirements of cells, testing serum lots, measuring the effects of growth factors, and for toxicity testing.\n\nPlating Efficiency is the number of cells that grow into colonies per 100 cells inoculated. That is, it is the proportion of cells that attach and grow to the number of cells originally plated, expressed as a percentage. PE can be determined by the following formulae:\nor\nThe first method is more accurate.\n\nCell growth in culture generally undergoes a decline after plating, and graphically, PE is the global minimum (lowest point) of the growth curve at day one, after which growth rises again. The decrease in viable cells after plating is due to \"anchorage-dependence\"--cells must attach to the bottom of the culture dish.\n\nPlating Efficiency is one of the parameters typically used to define growth properties of cells in culture. Other common parameters are doubling time (\"DT\") (which is an average of generation time (\"GT\")), and saturation density (\"SD\").\n\n"}
{"id": "456706", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=456706", "title": "Rebirth (Buddhism)", "text": "Rebirth (Buddhism)\n\nRebirth in Buddhism refers to its teaching that the actions of a person lead to a new existence after death, in endless cycles called \"saṃsāra\". This cycle is considered to be \"dukkha\", unsatisfactory and painful. The cycle stops only if liberation is achieved by insight and the extinguishing of desire. Rebirth is one of the foundational doctrines of Buddhism, along with Karma, nirvana and moksha.\n\nThe rebirth doctrine in Buddhism, sometimes referred to as reincarnation or metempsychosis, asserts that rebirth does not necessarily take place as another human being, but as an existence in one of the six \"Gati\" (realms) called \"Bhavachakra\". The six realms of rebirth include Deva (heavenly), Asura (demigod), Manusya (human), Tiryak (animals), Preta (ghosts), and Naraka (resident of hell). This rebirth, state Buddhism traditions, is determined by karma, with good realms favored by \"Kushala\" (good karma), while a rebirth in evil realms is a consequence of \"Akushala\" (bad karma). While Nirvana is the ultimate goal of Buddhist teaching, much of traditional Buddhist practice has been centered on gaining merit and merit transfer, whereby one gains rebirth in the good realms and avoids rebirth in the evil realms.\n\nThe rebirth doctrine has been a subject of scholarly studies within Buddhism since ancient times, particularly in reconciling the rebirth doctrine with its \"Anatman\" (no self, no soul) doctrine. The Buddhist traditions have disagreed on what it is in a person that is reborn, as well as how quickly the rebirth occurs after each death. Some Buddhist traditions assert that \"no self\" doctrine means that there is no perduring self, but there is \"avacya\" (inexpressible) self which migrates from one life to another. The majority of Buddhist traditions, in contrast, assert that Vijnana (a person's consciousness) though evolving, exists as a continuum and is the mechanistic basis of what undergoes rebirth, rebecoming and redeath. Some traditions assert that the rebirth occurs immediately, while others such as the Tibetan Buddhism posits an interim state wherein as many of 49 days pass between death and rebirth and this belief drives the local funerary rituals.\n\nThere is no word corresponding exactly to the English terms \"rebirth\", \"metempsychosis\", \"transmigration\" or \"reincarnation\" in the traditional Buddhist languages of Pāli and Sanskrit. Rebirth is referred to by various terms, representing an essential step in the endless cycle of \"samsara\", terms such as \"re-becoming\" or \"becoming again\"(Sanskrit: punarbhava, Pali: punabbhava), re-born (\"punarjanman\"), re-death (\"punarmrityu\"), or sometimes just \"becoming\" (Pali/Sanskrit: bhava), while the state one is born into, the individual process of being born or coming into the world in any way, is referred to simply as \"birth\" (Pali/Sanskrit: jāti). The entire universal process of beings being reborn again and again is called \"wandering about\" (Pali/Sanskrit: ).\n\nSome English-speaking Buddhists prefer the term \"rebirth\" or \"re-becoming\" (Sanskrit: \"punarbhava\"; Pali: \"punabbhava\") to \"reincarnation\" as they take the latter to imply an entity (soul) that is reborn. Buddhism denies there is any such soul or self in a living being, but does assert that there is a cycle of transmigration consisting of rebirth and redeath as the fundamental nature of existence.\n\nBefore the time of the Buddha, many ideas on the nature of existence, birth and death were in vogue. The ancient Indian Vedic and Sramana schools affirmed the idea of soul, karma and cycle of rebirth. The competing Indian materialist schools denied the idea of soul, karma and rebirth, asserting instead that there is just one life, there is no rebirth, and death marks complete annihilation. From these diverse views, Buddha accepted the premises and concepts related to rebirth, but introduced innovations. According to various Buddhist scriptures, Buddha believed in other worlds,\n\nBuddha also asserted that there is karma, which influences the future suffering through the cycle of rebirth, but added that there is a way to end the cycle of karmic rebirths through \"nirvana\". The Buddha introduced the concept that there is no soul (self) tying the cycle of rebirths, in contrast to themes asserted by various Hindu and Jaina traditions, and this central concept in Buddhism is called \"anattā\"; Buddha also affirmed the idea that all compounded things are subject to dissolution at death or \"anicca\". The Buddha's detailed conception of the connections between action (karma), rebirth and causality is set out in the twelve links of dependent origination.\n\nThere are many references to rebirth in the early Buddhist scriptures. These are some of the more important; Mahakammavibhanga Sutta (Majjhima Nikaya 136); Upali Sutta (Majjhima Nikaya 56); Kukkuravatika Sutta (Majjhima Nikaya 57); Moliyasivaka Sutta (Samyutta Nikaya 36.21); Sankha Sutta (Samyutta Nikaya 42.8).\nRebirth is discussed in Buddhist scriptures with various terms, such as \"Āgati-gati\", \"Punarbhava\" and others. The term \"Āgati\" literally means 'coming back, return', while \"Gati\" means 'going away' and \"Punarbhava\" means 're-becoming'. \"Āgati-gati\" in the sense of rebirth and re-death appears in many places in early Buddhist texts, such as in Samyutta Nikaya III.53, Jataka II.172, Digha Nikaya I. 162, Anguttara III.54-74 and Petavatthu II.9. \"Punarbhava\" in the sense of rebirth, similarly appears in many places, such as in Digha II.15, Samyutta I.133 and 4.201, Itivuttaka 62, Sutta-nipata 162, 273, 502, 514 and 733. Numerous other terms for rebirths are found in the Buddhist scriptures, such as \"Punagamana\", \"Punavasa\", \"Punanivattati\", \"Abhinibbatti\", and words with roots of \"*jati\" and \"*rupa\".\n\nWhile all Buddhist traditions except Navayana accept some notion of rebirth, they differ in their theories about rebirth mechanism and precisely how events unfold after the moment of death. The early Buddhist texts suggest that Buddha faced a difficulty in explaining what is reborn and how rebirth occurs, after he innovated the concept that there is \"no self\" (Anatta). The texts also suggest that the \"Anicca\" theory led to difficulties in explaining that there is a permanent consciousness that moves from life to life. Later Buddhist scholars such as Buddhaghosa suggested that the lack of a self or soul does not mean lack of continuity; and the rebirth across different realms of birth – such as heavenly, human, animal, hellish and others – occurs in the same way that a flame is transferred from one candle to another.\n\nThe Sautrantika sub-school of the Saravastivada Buddhist tradition, that emerged in 2nd century BCE, and influenced the 4th-century CE Yogacara school of Buddhism, introduced the idea of \"transmigrating substratum of consciousness\". It stated that each personal act \"perfumes\" the individual and leads to the planting of a \"seed\" that would later germinate as a good or bad karmic result.\n\nThe Pudgalavada school of early Buddhism accepted the core premise of Buddhism that there is no \"attā\" (ātman, soul, self), but asserted that there is a \"personal entity\" (\"pudgala\", \"puggala\") that retains a karma balance sheet and is mechanistically involved in rebirth; this personal entity, stated Pudgalavada Buddhists, is neither different nor identical to the five aggregates (skandhas). This concept of personal entity to explain rebirth by Pudgalavada Buddhists was polemically attacked by Theravada Buddhists in early 1st millennium CE. The personal entity concept was rejected by the mid-1st millennium CE Pali scholar Buddhaghosa, who attempted to explain rebirth mechanism with \"rebirth-linking consciousness\" (\"patisandhi\").\nSome schools conclude that karma continued to exist and adhere to the person until it had worked out its consequences. Theravada Buddhists assert that rebirth is immediate while the Tibetan schools hold to the notion of a bardo (intermediate state) that can last up to forty-nine days.\n\nThe \"bardo\" rebirth concept of Tibetan Buddhism, along with \"Yidam\", developed independently in Tibet, and involves forty two peaceful deities, and fifty eight wrathful deities. These ideas led to mechanistic maps on karma and what form of rebirth one takes after death, discussed in texts such as \"The Tibetan Book of the Dead\".\n\nAnother mechanistic rebirth theory that emerged in Buddhism posits that a being is reborn through \"evolving consciousness\" (Pali: \"samvattanika viññana,\" M.1.256) or \"stream of consciousness\" (Pali: \"viññana sotam\", D.3.105) that reincarnates. Death dissolves all prior aggregates (Pali: \"khandha\"s, Sanskrit: \"skandha\"s), and this consciousness stream combined with karma of a being contributes to a new aggregation, which is rebirth. Nirvana is the state that marks the end of this consciousness continuum and the associated karmic cycle of suffering through rebirths and redeaths.\n\nIn traditional Buddhist cosmology the rebirth, also called reincarnation or metempsychosis, can be in any of six realms. These are called the \"Gati\" in cycles of re-becoming, \"Bhavachakra\". The six realms of rebirth include three good realms – Deva (heavenly, god), Asura (demigod), Manusya (human); and three evil realms – Tiryak (animals), Preta (ghosts), and Naraka (hellish). The realm of rebirth is conditioned by the karma (deeds, intent) of current and previous lives; good karmas will yield a happier rebirth into good realm, bad karmas is believed to produce rebirth which is more unhappy and evil .\n\nThe release from this endless cycle of rebirths, rebecoming and redeaths is called nirvana (nibbana) in Buddhism, and achievement of nirvana is the ultimate goal of Buddhist teaching. However, much of traditional Buddhist practice has been centered on gaining merit and merit transfer, whereby an individual gains rebirth for oneself or one's family members in the good realms, and avoids rebirth in the evil realms.\n\nAncient Buddhists as well as some moderns cite the reports of the Buddha and his disciples of having gained direct knowledge into their own past lives as well as those of other beings through a kind of parapsychological ability or extrasensory perception (termed \"abhiñña\"). Likewise, Buddhist philosophers have defended the concept of special yogic perception (\"yogipratyakṣa\") which is able to empirically verify the truth of rebirth.\n\nModern Buddhists have also pointed to parapsychological phenomena as possible empirical evidence for rebirth, mainly near-death experiences, past life regression, reincarnation research and xenoglossy.\n\nBesides defending the status of the Buddha as an epistemically authoritative or reliable person (\"pramāṇa puruṣa\"), Indian Buddhist philosophers like Dignaga (c. 480–540 CE) and Dharmakirti (fl. c. 6th or 7th century), as well as later commentators on their works, also put forth philosophical arguments in favor of rebirth and especially directed against the reductionist materialist philosophy of the Carvaka school. To defend rebirth, Dharmakirti initially focuses on refuting the materialist doctrine of the Carvaka school, which held that the support (\"asraya\") for cognition is the body and that when the body is destroyed, cognition is destroyed.\n\nAccording to Richard P. Hayes, Dharmakirti denied that mental events were a mere byproduct of the body, instead holding that \"both mental events and physical events can be seen as effects of the same set of causal conditions.\" For Dharmakirti, all events are dependent on multiple causes, and they must be preceded by an \"antecendent causal condition\" of the same class. This means that all mental events \"must have\" a previous mental event as part of its causal nexus (presumably stretching back before one's birth). According to Hayes, Dharmakirti holds therefore that \"both physical factors and nonphysical factors play a role in the formation of mental events\", if not there would be no difference between sentient beings and inanimate matter. Eli Franco mentions that for Dharmakirti, the position that cognition \"can arise from the body alone, independent of their similar causes\" at the moment of birth is irrational. That is, if the mind is not being conditioned by a previous cognitive event, then it cannot arise from inert matter. Dharmakirti also argues that mental events can causally condition physical events, and thus there is no reason to privilege matter as being primary. According to Martin Willson, this kind of argument is the most commonly used in the Tibetan philosophical tradition to establish the truth of rebirth and in its most simple form can be put as follows: With respect to the knowing (consciousness or mind) of an ordinary being just born: it is preceded by earlier knowing; because it is knowing.Willson notes that this relies on two further assumptions, the first is that any mental continuum must have previous causes, the second is that materialism is false and that mind cannot emerge solely from matter (emergentism). Because of this, Indian Buddhist philosophers who argued in this way attempted to disprove the theories of materialists (Carvaka).\n\nTheravada Abhidhamma makes a similar argument. According to the Abhidhamma teacher Nina van Gorkom, physical and mental events (\"dhammas\") both depend on each other and on previous events of the same category (i.e. mental events must also be conditioned by previous mental events, and so on). In Abhidhamma, the mental event (\"citta\") which arises at the first moment of life is called the rebirth consciousness or \"patisandhi-citta.\" According to van Gorkom, \"there isn’t any citta which arises without conditions, the \"patisandhi-citta\" must also have conditions. The \"patisandhi-citta\" is the first \"citta\" of a new life and thus its cause can only be in the past.\"\n\nVarious Buddhists and interpreters of the Buddhist texts such as David Kalupahana and Etienne Lamotte, have argued that the Buddha is a kind of pragmatist regarding truth, and that he saw truths as important only when they were soteriologically useful. Thus, the Buddhist position on rebirth could be defended on pragmatic grounds instead of empirical or logical grounds. Some modern Buddhists have taken this position.\n\nThe American monk Thanissaro Bhikkhu has argued for the acceptance of the Buddhist idea of rebirth as a type of pragmatic wager argument (Pali: \"apaṇṇaka\", \"safe bet\" or \"guarantee\"). Thanissaro argues that \"the Buddha stated that it's a safe wager to assume that actions bear results that can affect not only this lifetime for also lifetimes after this than it is to assume the opposite.\" Thanissaro cites Majjhima Nikaya 60 (\"Apaṇṇaka sutta\") where the Buddha says that if there is an afterlife, those who perform bad actions have \"made a bad throw twice\" (because they are harmed in this world and in the next) while those who perform good actions will not, and thus he calls his teaching a \"safe-bet teaching\". According to Thanissaro:The Buddha's main pragmatic argument is that if one accepted his teachings, one would be likely to pay careful attention to one's actions, so as to do no harm. This in and of itself is a worthy activity regardless of whether the rest of the path was true. When applying this argument to the issue of rebirth and karmic results, the Buddha sometimes coupled it with a second pragmatic argument that resembles Pascal's wager: If one practices the Dhamma, one leads a blameless life in the here-and-now. Even if the afterlife and karmic results do not exist, one has not lost the wager, for the blamelessness of one's life is a reward in and of itself. If there is an afterlife with karmic results, then one has won a double reward: the blamelessness of one's life here and now, and the good rewards of one's actions in the afterlife. These two pragmatic arguments form the central message of this sutta.Sri Lankan Buddhist philosopher K.N. Jayatilleke writes that the Buddha's \"wager argument\" in MN 60 is that a rational person (\"viññu puriso\") would reason as follows:\n\nThe Kalama Sutta also contains a similar wager argument towards rebirth, called the \"four assurances\" or \"four consolations\".\n\nThe rebirth theories in different traditions within Hinduism rely on their foundational assumption that soul exists (Atman, attā), in contrast to Buddhist assumption that there is no soul. Hindu traditions consider soul to be the unchanging eternal essence of a living being, and in many of its theistic and non-theistic traditions the soul asserted to be identical with Brahman, the ultimate reality. Thus while both Buddhism and Hinduism accept the karma and rebirth doctrine, and both focus on ethics in this life as well as liberation from rebirth and suffering as the ultimate spiritual pursuit, they have a very different view on whether a self or soul exists, which impacts the details of their respective rebirth theories.\n\nRebirth and karma doctrine in Jainism differ from those in Buddhism, even though both are non-theistic Sramana traditions. Jainism, in contrast to Buddhism, accepts the foundational assumption that soul exists (\"Jiva\") and is involved in the rebirth mechanism. Further, Jainism considers that the rebirth has a start, that rebirth and redeath cycle is a part of a progression of a soul, karmic dust particles emanate from ethical or unethical intent and actions, these karmic particles stick to the soul which determines the next birth. Jainism, further asserts that some souls can never achieve liberation, that ethical living such as Ahimsa (non-violence) and asceticism are means to liberation for those who can attain liberation, and that liberated souls reach the eternal \"siddha\" (enlightened state) that ends their rebirth cycles. Jainism, like Buddhism, also believes in realms of birth and is symbolized by its emblematic Swastika sign, with ethical and moral theories of its lay practices focussing on obtaining good rebirth.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

That morning, 16-year-old Jeffrey Weise killed his grandfather (a tribal police officer) and his grandfather's girlfriend at their home. After taking his grandfather's police weapons and vest, Weise drove his grandfather's police vehicle to Red Lake Senior High School, where he had been a student some months before.\n\nWeise shot and killed seven people at the school and wounded five others. The dead included an unarmed security guard at the entrance of the school, then a teacher and five students. After the police arrived, Weise exchanged gunfire with them. After being wounded, he shot and killed himself, committing suicide in a vacant classroom.\n\nBy some accounts, at the time of the shooting Weise was living with his paternal grandfather, Daryl Lussier, Sr., a sergeant with the Red Lake Police Department, run by the Red Lake Ojibwe tribal government. The household included his grandfather's younger girlfriend, Michelle Leigh Sigana. His paternal aunts Shauna and Tammy Lussier said he had lived mostly with them for the past several years, and they helped him get treatment to deal with some of his behavioral issues and depression. In 1999, Jeff Weise's mother suffered severe brain damage in a car accident and since then had to receive care in a nursing home. Still a child, Weise was forced to move from Minneapolis to live with his father's family on the reservation. His father had committed suicide in 1997, so Weise was officially placed with his grandmother, Shelda (Gurneau) Lussier. His aunts Shauna and Tammy Lussier helped care for him, especially after the grandmother's death in 2003.\n\nThe reservation of the Red Lake Band of Ojibwe (aka Chippewa) is in northwest Minnesota and is one of two nationally that are \"closed\"; only Ojibwe tribal members may live there and own land. Its residents suffer high rates of unemployment, violence, and suicide. Housing is poor, and many students do not finish high school. Work opportunities are limited on the reservation, which has a population of more than 5,000. A study in 2004 found that a high proportion of students in high school had thought of suicide.\n\nThe day of the shootings, Weise retrieved a Ruger MK II .22 caliber pistol from his bedroom and fatally shot his grandfather as he was sleeping; he shot him two times in the head and ten times in the chest. According to Weise's friends, the teenager may have had the gun for as long as a year. He took Lussier's two police-issue weapons, a .40 caliber Glock 23 pistol and a Remington 870 12 gauge pump-action shotgun, a gunbelt and a bullet-proof vest. He fatally shot Sigana, his grandfather's girlfriend, two times in the head as she carried laundry up the stairs.\n\nWeise drove his grandfather's squad car to Red Lake Senior High School, arriving at around 2:45 p.m. Central Standard Time. As he entered the school through the main entrance, he encountered two unarmed security guards manning a metal detector. Weise shot and killed Derrick Brun, while the other security guard escaped without injury. Weise proceeded into the main corridor of the school.\n\nHe began shooting into an English classroom, killing three students and one teacher, and wounding three students. Ashley Lajeunesse said that Chase Lussier (no direct relation to Daryl Lussier) sheltered her, and was one of those shot by Weise. Jeffrey May, a 16-year-old sophomore, tried to wrestle Weise inside the classroom, and stabbed him in the stomach with a pencil. His diversion allowed students to flee the classroom to safety, but Weise shot May two times in the neck and once in the jaw, leaving him seriously injured.\n\nWitnesses said Weise smiled as he was shooting at people. One witness said that Weise asked a student if he believed in God. This is believed to have been a reference to a widely publicized exchange during the 1999 Columbine High School massacre between Dylan Klebold and Valeen Schnurr, a Columbine survivor.\n\nAt around 2:52 p.m., Weise returned to the main entrance, where he killed two students and wounded two others. The police had arrived quickly and engaged him in gunfire. FBI special agent Paul McCabe said the shootout lasted for about four minutes. None of the officers were injured. After being hit in the abdomen and right arm, Weise retreated to a vacant classroom. He leaned against a wall, put the shotgun barrel to his chin, and fired, killing himself.\n\nPolice said a total of ten people, including the perpetrator, had died in these events.\n\n\nThe night after the shooting, many people of the community gathered at the high school gymnasium for a healing ceremony. They used traditional Ojibwe ceremony and prayer.\n\nWithin days, preparations started for funerals on the reservation. Tribal members drew from Ojibwe traditions as well as Catholic rites. They \"collected bundles of sage, to be given as gifts and burned during funeral ceremonies.\" Families picked personal items to be placed in the caskets.\n\n\nMinnesota has a state fund that aids victims and their families. In addition, the Red Lake Band of Chippewa established a memorial fund; it reached $200,000 in donations from across the country by April 2005. Initially the tribe made 15 grants of $5,000 each to victims and families, including one to Weise's relatives. A tribal spokesman noted his family was not eligible for state compensation and said that they carried \"a double burden.\" The grant was to help pay for Weise's funeral and burial.\n\nOn July 21, 2006, the Red Lake school district reached a settlement with the families of the massacre victims. The school district agreed to pay $1,000,000 total to 21 of the victims' families, the maximum amount allowed by Minnesota law. Of the settlement, $900,000 will immediately be granted to the families, and the remaining $100,000 will be set aside for future distribution.\n\nJeffrey Weise was labeled an outsider in the community and had been placed in \"homebound\" schooling for breaking school rules. He is remembered as a quiet kid, that normally wore a black trench coat, and gel in his hair.\n\nWeise had grown up with a difficult and disrupted family life; his parents were a young unmarried couple who separated before he was born. His 17-year-old mother's family insisted that Joanne Weise give up her son to the father, who was a few years older. Jeff Weise did not live again with his mother until after he was two years old, when she reclaimed him and took him to Minneapolis. In later Internet postings, Weise wrote that his mother had become an alcoholic who was sometimes physically and emotionally abusive. In 1992 she started dating Timothy Troy DesJarlait, and they married in 1998 after having had two children together. Jeffrey attended several different schools during his years as a student.\n\nIn 1997, when Weise was eight, his father Daryl Lussier, Jr. committed suicide by shooting himself. He had a standoff over several days with the Red Lake Police Department in Red Lake, where his father Daryl Lussier, Sr. was a sergeant with the tribal police.\n\nIn 1999, when Weise was ten, his mother was in a car accident and suffered severe brain damage. She had to be committed to a nursing home for rehabilitation. After separating from her in 2000, Timothy DesJarlait divorced Weise's mother in May 2004.\n\nJeff was placed in the custody of his paternal grandmother Shelda (Gurneau) Lussier, who lived on the Red Lake Reservation. He had to leave Minneapolis, where he had lived most of his life, to be with her and other paternal relatives.\n\nPolice investigators began searching for a motive behind the shootings. According to their findings and media reports, Weise was often bullied or teased in school by classmates. A tall youth weighing 250 pounds (115 kg), he was known to wear dark eyeliner, as well as a long black trench coat and other black clothing to school year round. He was referred to as a \"goth kid\" by many of his classmates. He did not usually respond to taunts. Some fellow students thought of him as a loner, but he had his own circle of friends.\n\nJeff Weise expressed frustration about living in Red Lake, and felt his life was beyond his control. During these years, he got close to his grandfather, Daryl Lussier, Sr., who gave him a bedroom of his own. Lussier, Sr. lived with his companion Michele Sigana. Weise was said to have a good relationship with his grandfather.\n\nAlthough Jeff had been separated from his mother and stepfather for years by the time of their divorce in May 2004, he attempted suicide soon after, and again in June 2004. At that time, his aunts and the Red Lake Medical Center arranged for Weise to be taken to a hospital for psychiatric treatment, where he stayed for three days.\n\nThe teen was prescribed Prozac as an anti-depressant, to be continued as treatment together with counseling. His doctor had increased his dosage a week before the shooting, to 60 mg a day of Prozac. His aunts Shauna and Tammy Lussier, with whom Weise lived much of the time at Red Lake, said they had arranged for his medical care and were concerned about the increase in his dosage. Weise's murders reopened the debate about Prozac use among children and adolescents. In October 2004, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) had issued a warning about its use; but it is still the only anti-depressant approved for use with children.\n\nLorene Gurneau, a relative of his paternal grandmother, said she and other family members thought Jeff had never gotten over his father's suicide in 1997. In addition, his mother's car accident in 1999 had left her comatose and in a nursing home, which meant that Jeff had effectively lost both parents by the age of ten.\n\nWeise was discovered to have been active on the Internet. According to The Smoking Gun, Weise created two violent Flash animations for the flash website Newgrounds, using the alias \"Regret.\" One animation entitled \"Target Practice\", features a character who murders three people with a rifle, blows up a police car with a grenade, and kills a Klansman. The 30-second animation ends with the shooter committing suicide. Weise had created another Flash animation entitled \"Clown\", in which a clown kills a man by eating his head.\n\nA LiveJournal account, apparently created by Weise, contained his three entries posted between December 2004 and January 2005. The weblog was customized to be rendered in black and white. Weise expressed his desire for change and salvation in his life.\n\nWeise was a fan of the music genre known as horrorcore. It was reported on KARE 11 that Weise was a fan of horrorcore rappers such as Mars, Jimmy Donn and Prozak. Weise was known to frequent the Mars website. Jimmy Donn's song \"Game Over\" (which is a song about a school shooting) was said to be one of Weise's favorite songs, and Weise owned Jimmy Donn's album \"The Darker Side.\"\n\nSiblings of the victims and survivors participated in the 2018 School Walk Outs, that was designed to show respect for shooting victims seen nationally but especially in Florida and Red Lake.\n\n\n\n"}

Thompson\n\nRichard Leslie Thompson, also known as Sadaputa Dasa (February 4, 1947 – September 18, 2008), was an American mathematician, author and Gaudiya Vaishnava religious figure, known principally for his promotion of Vedic creationism and as the co-author (with Michael Cremo) of \"Forbidden Archeology: The Hidden History of the Human Race\" (1993), which has been widely criticised by the scientific community. Thompson also published several books and articles on religion and science, Hindu cosmology and astronomy. He was a member of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness (popularly known as the \"Hare Krishna movement\" or \"ISKCON\") and a founding member of the Bhaktivedanta Institute, the branch of ISKCON dedicated to examining the relationship of modern scientific theories to the Vaishnava worldview. In the 'science and religion' community he was known for his articulation of ISKCON's view of science. Danish historian of religion Mikael Rothstein described Thompson as \"the single dominating writer on science\" in ISKCON whom ISKCON has chosen to \"cover the field of science more or less on his own\". C. Mackenzie Brown, professor of religion at Trinity University, San Antonio, Texas, described him as \"the leading figure\" in ISKCON's critique of modern science.\n\nRichard L. Thompson was born in Binghamton, New York, in 1947. In 1974 he received a Ph.D. in mathematics from Cornell University. In the same year he formally became a member of ISKCON, receiving spiritual initiation from ISKCON's founder, A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada, and adopting the spiritual name Sadaputa Dasa. Thompson carried out research in the fields of statistical mechanics, probability theory, and mathematical biology. He published scholarly articles in refereed journals and series, such as \"Journal of Mathematical Geology\", \"Remote Sensing of the Environment\", \"Biosystems\", and \"International Review of Cytology\". In 1976 he became a founding member of the Bhaktivedanta Institute, the scientific branch of ISKCON dedicated to examining the relationship of modern scientific theories to Swami Prabhupada’s Vaishnava worldview. Soon after joining ISKCON, Thompson became \"ISKCON's dominating figure in science\" and \"established himself as the leading figure in the movement's critique of modern science in the light of Vedic spiritual (or 'higher-dimensional') science.\" He formulated ISKCON's view on the concept of \"higher-dimensional science\" and wrote extensively on scientific subjects from this perspective. In support of ISKCON's theology, he made research and analysis of the relation between the Vaishnava theological worldview and modern science.\n\nThompson died on September 18, 2008. He had suffered a heart attack, a condition there has been some history of in his family.\n\nCoauthor Michael Cremo writes in the Preface to the first edition that the work's central claim, that anomalous paleontological evidence dating in many hundreds of thousands of years, with examples such as the Laetoli footprints (which are thought by paleontologists to have been made by distant ancestors of homo sapiens, perhapsAustralopithecus afarensis), stretching possibilities toward the low millions, suggest that modern human beings \"perhaps ... coexisted with more apelike creatures,\" and that the scientific establishment, influenced by confirmation bias, has suppressed fossil evidence of extreme human antiquity. This argument has been critiqued by mainstream scholars from a variety of disciplines.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "4875080", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4875080", "title": "Self-care", "text": "Self-care\n\nIn health care, self-care is any necessary human regulatory function which is under individual control, deliberate and self-initiated.\n\nSome place self-care on a continuum with health care providers at the opposite end to self-care. In modern medicine, preventive medicine aligns most closely with self-care. A lack of adherence to medical advice and the onset of a mental disorder can make self-care difficult. Self-care is seen as a partial solution to the global rise in health care costs placed on governments. The notion that self-care is a fundamental pillar of health and social care means it is an essential component of a modern health care system governed by regulations and statutes.\n\nSelf-care is considered a primary form of care for patients with chronic conditions who make many day-to-day decisions, or self-manage, their illness. Self-management is critical and self-management education complements traditional patient education in primary care to support patients to live the best possible quality of life with their chronic condition. Self-care is learned, purposeful and continuous. In philosophy, self-care refers to the care and cultivation of self in a comprehensive sense, focusing in particular on the soul and the knowledge of self.\n\nThere are a number of self-care requisites applicable to all humans across all ages and necessary to fundamental human needs. For example, as humans we need to intake sufficient air, water and food; care also needs to be taken with the process of elimination and excrement. There must be a balance between rest and activity as well as between solitude and social activities. The prevention and avoidance of human hazards and participation in social groups are also requisites. Maturity requires the autonomous performance of self-care duties.\n\nSelf-care includes all health decisions people (as individuals or consumers) make for themselves and their families to ensure they are physically and mentally fit.\n\nSelf-care maintenance behaviors include illness prevention, illness behaviors, and proper hygiene. Illness prevention measures include tobacco avoidance, exercise, and diet. Tobacco use is the largest preventable cause of death and disease in the US. By avoiding or quitting tobacco use, overall health and quality of life are improved and risk of disease and premature death are reduced. The benefits of regular physical activity may include weight control, reduced risk of chronic disease, strengthened bones and muscles, improved mental health, improved ability to participate in daily activities, and increased chance of living longer. The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends 2 hours and thirty minutes of moderate activity each week. Examples of this include brisk walking, swimming, dancing, riding a bike, and even jumping rope. Another important aspect to self care includes eating fresh fruits and vegetables, lean meats and other proteins. Processed foods should be limited. Limiting saturated fats, trans fats, sugars, and sodium will also contribute to a healthy diet.\n\nIllness behaviors include taking medicines as prescribed and getting vaccinations. When medicines are not taken as prescribed, complications can occur. These complications include disease progression, reduced functional abilities, lower quality of life, and increased hospital visits. Vaccinations helps protect individuals from serious illnesses and complications related to vaccine-preventable diseases like pneumonia.\n\nHygiene is another important part of self-care maintenance. Hygiene behaviors include adequate sleep, regular oral care, and hand washing. Getting 7–8 hours of sleep each night can protect physical and mental health. Sleep deficiency increases the risk of heart disease, kidney disease, high blood pressure, diabetes, and obesity. Sleep deficiency can also lead to depression, suicide, and risk-taking behavior. Teeth brushing and personal hygiene can prevent infection.\n\nSelf-care maintenance behaviors can be influenced by external factors, such as access to healthcare and living environments. Social determinants of health play a huge role in how people take care of themselves. Access to care is one major determinant of one's ability to carry out self-care maintenance behaviors.This includes having access to transportation to visit a health care service, availability of open hours of offices/clinics, and whether or not the care is affordable. These external factors can determine a person's ability to perform self-care maintenance because a person may not be able to perform a behavior based on its availability. Access within a one's living environment is another factor that influences self-care maintenance. An individual's environment determines whether they are able to go to the gym to exercise or go to a grocery store to buy healthy food. Living in a food desert or having limited resources that allow for physical activity would decrease the likelihood of participating in self-care maintenance behaviors.\n\nInternal factors, such as motivation, emotions, and cognitive abilities also influence self-care maintenance behaviors. Motivation is often the driving force behind performing self-care maintenance behaviors. A person who is motivated to stay healthy and managing and/or prevent a chronic illness is more likely to be interested in performing maintenance behaviors, such as those mentioned above. Emotions are also indicative of whether a person is going to perform such behaviors. A person with depression is more likely to have a poor dietary intake low in fruits and vegetables, reduced physical activity, and poor medication adherence. An individual with impaired cognitive or functional abilities also has a diminished ability to performing self-care maintenance behaviors. Some of these behaviors, such as medication adherence, require the ability to maintain a schedule, but someone with memory impairment may have difficulty completing tasks based on memory.\n\nSkills are also a significant aspect that influences an individual's ability to perform self-care behaviors. Individuals need to be able to plan, set goals, and make appropriate decisions regarding their health needs. In addition, self-care is influenced by an individual's attitude and belief in his or her self-efficacy. Having the confidence to perform an action and to overcome barriers is indicative of success in performing self-care behaviors. Cultural beliefs and values may also influence self-care. Self-care may be viewed as highly important in some countries or within certain cultures that value independence, but in other cultures, self-care may contradict their beliefs and values.\n\nSocial supports also influence how an individual performs self-care maintenance. Social supports include family, friends, and support groups. Support groups can be through religious groups, groups that manage chronic illnesses, or a community group. These supports can help by having people to talk to or help make decisions about your care. Individuals who live with chronic illness acknowledge that shared care can help make living with a chronic illness less stressful. If you are suffering from a chronic illness and would like to join a support group, there are resources that could be found online or offered by your primary care provider.\n\nLiving with one or more chronic illnesses can be very difficult. There are numerous medications, different specialists, and self-care maintenance behaviors that are necessary. With all of these working parts, it can be difficult to keep track of everything. The presence of co-morbid conditions makes performing self-care maintenance behaviors harder to complete. Pill burden is a huge factor in self-care maintenance of multiple chronic illnesses because many people may complain of not wanting to take all the medication or get confused regarding the schedule of their medications. As an example, a patient with diabetes would need to exercise, but if they also have COPD they easily develop shortness of breath which would cause them to stop exercising. It is important to address all the symptoms of each chronic illness an individual suffers from so that individuals with chronic illnesses can successfully perform self-care maintenance behaviors.\n\nThe benefits of living a healthy lifestyle were analyzed in the Caerphilly Heart Disease Study. Evidence showed a risk reduction in chronic diseases (including dementia and cognitive impairment) to be significantly associated with healthy lifestyles.\n\nSelf-care is also taking care of minor ailments, long term conditions, or one's own health after discharge from secondary and tertiary health care. For instances of neck pain, for example, self-care is the recommended treatment.\n\nPatients who are better informed and more educated possess greater motivation for self-care. Individuals conduct self-care and experts and professionals support self-care to enable individuals to undertake enhanced self-care. The recognition and evaluation of symptoms is a key aspect of self-care. The main issues involved with self-care and the onset of illness are medically related such managing drug side effects, emotions and psychological issues, changes to lifestyle and knowledge acquisition to assist in decision-making.\n\nSelf-care support has crucial enabling value and considerable scope in developing countries with an already overburdened health care system. But it also has an essential role to play in affluent countries where people are becoming more conscious about their health and want to have a greater role in taking care of themselves.\n\nTo enable people to do enhanced self-care, they can be supported in various ways and by different service providers.\nMultifaceted interventions that tailor education to the individual are more effective than patient education alone. Approaches used to improve self-care are summarized here.\n\nSelf-care monitoring is the process of surveillance that involves measurement and perception of bodily changes. Effective self-care monitoring also requires being able to label and interpret changes in the body as normal or abnormal. Listening to your body and recognizing signs and symptoms, increasing factual knowledge towards disease or illness are all important factors. Being able to interpret and label your symptoms, understanding the process of your disease, and knowing how to act and treat accordingly allows competency in knowing when to seek further medical help.\n\nSelf-care monitoring consists of both the perception and measurement of symptoms. Symptom perception is the process of monitoring one's body for signs of changing health. This includes body awareness or body listening, recognizing symptoms relevant to health, and interpreting and labeling these symptoms. For example, a patient with diabetes may use body listening to perceive feelings of shakiness and sweating. These feelings are labeled as symptoms of low blood sugar, and the patient will decide how to act based on this information. Prompt and accurate recognition of symptoms is a necessary part of a patient's management of their health. In heart attack patients, delays in seeking treatment for worsening symptoms have been found to contribute to poor health outcomes.\n\nChanges in health status or body function can be monitored with various tools and technologies. The range and complexity of medical devices used in both hospital and homecare settings are increasing. Certain devices are specific to a common need of a disease process. For example, various types of glucose monitors are used by patients with diabetes to track their blood sugar levels. Other devices can provide a more general set of information, such as a weight scale, blood pressure cuff, pulse oximeter, etc. Less technological tools can include organizers, charts, and diagrams to trend or keep track of things such as amount of calories, mood, vital sign measurements, and more.\n\nA patient's ability to engage in self-care monitoring greatly impacts the progression of his/her disease. Barriers to monitoring can go unrecognized and end up interfering with effective self-care. Barriers can include knowledge deficits, undesirable self-care regimens, different instructions from multiple providers, and limitations to access related to income or disability. Psychosocial factors such as motivation, anxiety, depression, confidence can also serve as barriers.\n\nBecause self-care monitoring is conducted primarily by patients and their caregivers, it is necessary to work with patients closely on this topic. Providers should assess the current self-care monitoring regimen and build off this to create an individualized plan of care. Knowledge and education specifically designed for the patient's level of understating is central to self-care monitoring. When patients understand the symptoms that correspond with their disease, they can learn to recognize these symptoms early on. Then they can self-manage their disease and prevent complications.\n\nAdditional research to improve self-care monitoring is underway in the following fields:\n\nSelf-care management is defined as the response to signs and symptoms when they occur. Self-care management involves the evaluation of physical and emotional changes and deciding if these changes need to be addressed. Changes may occur because of illness, treatment, or the environment. Once treatment is done, it needs to be evaluated to judge whether it would be useful to do again in the future. Treatments are based on the signs and symptoms experienced. Treatments are usually specific to the illness.\n\nSelf-care management includes recognizing symptoms, treating the symptoms, and evaluating the treatment. Self-care management behaviors are symptom- and disease-specific. For example, a patient with asthma may recognize the symptom of shortness of breath. This patient can manage the symptom by using an inhaler and seeing if their breathing improves. A patient with heart failure manages their condition by recognizing symptoms such as swelling and shortness of breath. Self-care management behaviors for heart failure may include taking a water pill, limiting fluid and salt intake, and seeking help from a healthcare provider.\n\nRegular self-care monitoring is needed to identify symptoms early and judge the effectiveness of treatments. Some examples include:\n\nAccess to care: Access to care is a major barrier affecting self-care management. Treatment of symptoms might require consultation with a healthcare provider. Access to the health care system is largely influenced by providers. Many people suffering from a chronic illness do not have access to providers within the health care system for several reasons. Three major barriers to care include: insurance coverage, poor access to services, and being unable to afford costs. Without access to trained health care providers, outcomes are typically worse.\n\nFinancial constraints: Financial barriers impact self-care management. The majority of insurance coverage is provided by employers. Loss of employment is frequently accompanied by loss of health insurance and inability to afford health care. In patients with diabetes and chronic heart disease, financial barriers are associated with poor access to care, poor quality of care, and vascular disease. As a result, these patients have reduced rates of medical assessments, measurements of Hemoglobin A1C (a marker that assesses blood glucose levels over the last 3 months), cholesterol measurements, eye and foot examinations, diabetes education, and aspirin use. Research has found that people in higher social classes are better at self-care management of chronic conditions. In addition, people with lower levels of education often lack resources to effectively engage in self-management behaviors.\n\nAge: Elderly patients are more likely to rate their symptoms differently and delay seeking care longer when they have symptoms. For example, an elderly person with heart failure may experience the symptom of shortness of breath differently than someone with heart failure who is younger. There are many reasons contributing to this difference in symptom experience. Providers should be aware of the potential delay in provider-seeking behavior in elderly patients which could worsen their overall condition.\n\nPrior experience: Prior experience contributes to the development of skills in self-care management. Experience helps the patient develop cues and patterns that they can remember and follow, leading to reasonable goals and actions in repeat situations. A patient who has skills in self-management knows what to do during repeated symptomatic events. This could lead to them recognizing their symptoms earlier, and seeking a provider sooner.\n\nHealth care literacy: Health care literacy is another factor affecting self-care management. Health care literacy is the amount of basic health information people are able to understand. Health care literacy is the major variable contributing to differences in patient ratings of self-management support. Successful self-care involves understanding the meaning of changes in one's body. Individuals who can identify changes in their body are then able to come up with options and decide on a course of action. Health education at the patient's literacy level can increase the patient's ability to problem solve, set goals, and acquire skills in applying practical information. A patient's literacy can also affect their rating of healthcare quality. A poor healthcare experience may cause a patient to avoid returning to that same provider. This creates a delay in acute symptom management. Providers must consider health literacy when designing treatment plans that require self-management skills.\n\nCo-morbid conditions: A patient with multiple chronic illnesses may experience compounding effects of their illnesses. This can include worsening of one condition by the symptoms or treatment of another. People tend to prioritize one of their conditions. This limits the self-care management of their other illnesses. One condition may have more noticeable symptoms than others. Or the patient may be more emotionally connected to one illness, for example, the one they have had for a long time. If providers are unaware of the effect of having multiple illnesses, the patient's overall health may fail to improve or worsen as a result of therapeutic efforts.\n\nThere are many ways for patients and healthcare providers to work together to improve the patient's self-care management. Stoplight and skill teaching allow patients and providers to work together to develop decision-making strategies.\n\n1. Stoplight is an action plan for the daily treatment of a patient's chronic illness created by the healthcare team and the patient. It makes decision making easier by categorizing signs and symptoms and determining the appropriate actions for each set. It separates signs and symptoms into three zones:\n\n\nThe stoplight plan helps patients to make decisions about what actions to take for different signs and symptoms and when to contact their healthcare team with a problem. The patient and their provider will customize certain signs and symptoms that fit in each stoplight category.\n\nHere are three links to sample stoplight plans that can be tailored to a patient's needs:\n\n2. Skills teaching is a learning opportunity between a healthcare provider and a patient where a patient learns a skill in self-care unique to his or her chronic illness. Some of these skills may be applied to the daily management of the symptoms of a chronic illness. Other skills may be applied when there is an exacerbation of a symptom. An exacerbation of a symptom means that the symptom is in a worsened state or is different from what the patient normally experiences. The patient should not only learn the purpose of self-care skills. It is also important to learn when to apply skills in daily management of a chronic illness and how the skill might be modified or changed when the patient experiences an exacerbation of a symptom.\n\nFor example, a patient newly diagnosed with persistent asthma might learn about taking an oral medicine for daily management, control of chronic symptoms and prevention of an asthma attack. However, there may come a time when the patient might be exposed to an environmental trigger or stress that causes an asthma attack. The patient starts to experience shortness of breath, chest tightness or wheezing. When this unexpected symptom occurs, the skill of taking daily medicines and the medicine that is taken may change. Rather than taking an oral medicine daily, a different medication is needed for quick rescue and relief of symptoms. The rescue medication works quickly with an inhaler. Knowing to choose the right medication and knowing how to take the medicine with an inhaler is a skill that is learned for the self-care management of asthma. Here is a source on how to safely use a rescue inhaler: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogAdPhk4GJA\n\nIn skills teaching, it is important for the patient and provider to discuss skills and address any lingering questions. It is important for the patient to know when and how a skill is to be implemented, and how the skill may need to be changed when the symptom is different from normal. See the summary of tactical and situational skills above. Learning self-care management skills for the first time in the care of a chronic illness is not easy, but with patience, practice, persistence and experience, personal mastery of self-care skills can be achieved.\n\nSelf-care support can include the following:\n\nSelf-care practices are shaped by what are seen as the proper lifestyle choices of local communities.\nHealth-related self-care topics include;\n\nA lack of self-care in terms of personal health, hygiene and living conditions is referred to as self-neglect. The use of caregivers and Personal Care Assistants may be needed. An aging population is seeking greater self-care knowledge primarily within families connections and with responsibility usually belonging to the mother.\n\nMichel Foucault understood the art of living (French \"art de vivre\", Latin \"ars vivendi\") and the care of self (French \"le souci de soi\") to be central to philosophy. The third volume of his three-volume study \"The History of Sexuality\" is dedicated to this notion. For Foucault, the notion of \"care of self\" (\"epimeleia heautou\") of Ancient Greek and Roman philosophy comprises an attitude towards the self, others and the world, as well as a certain form of attention. For Foucault, the pursuit of the care for one's own well-being also comprises self-knowledge (gnōthi seauton).\n\nAround the same time that Foucault developed his notion of care of the self, the notion of self-care as a revolutionary act in the context of social trauma was developed as a social justice practice in Black feminist thought in the US. Notably, civil rights activist and poet Audre Lorde wrote that in the context of multiple oppressions as a black woman, “caring for myself is not self-indulgence, it is self-preservation, and that is an act of political warfare.” With the rise of the term in the medical usages, for instance, to combat anxiety, the association with black feminism has fallen away in clinical and popular usage. However, in feminist and queer theory, the link to Lorde and other scholars is retained.\n\nThe self-care deficit nursing theory was developed by Dorothea Orem between 1959 and 2001. The positively viewed theory explores the use professional care and an orientation towards resources. Under Orem's model self-care has limits when its possibilities have been exhausted therefore making professional care legitimate. These deficits in self-care are seen as shaping the best role a nurse may provide. There are two phases in Orem's self-care; the investigative and decision-making phase and the production phase.\n\n"}
{"id": "500163", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=500163", "title": "Self-replicating spacecraft", "text": "Self-replicating spacecraft\n\nThe idea of self-replicating spacecraft has been applied – in theory – to several distinct \"tasks\". The particular variant of this idea applied to the idea of space exploration is known as a von Neumann probe. Other variants include the Berserker and an automated terraforming seeder ship.\n\nIn theory, a self-replicating spacecraft could be sent to a neighbouring planetary system, where it would seek out raw materials (extracted from asteroids, moons, gas giants, etc.) to create replicas of itself. These replicas would then be sent out to other planetary systems. The original \"parent\" probe could then pursue its primary purpose within the star system. This mission varies widely depending on the variant of self-replicating starship proposed.\n\nGiven this pattern, and its similarity to the reproduction patterns of bacteria, it has been pointed out that von Neumann machines might be considered a form of life. In his short story, \"Lungfish\" (see Self-replicating machines in fiction), David Brin touches on this idea, pointing out that self-replicating machines launched by different species might actually compete with one another (in a Darwinistic fashion) for raw material, or even have conflicting missions. Given enough variety of \"species\" they might even form a type of ecology, or – should they also have a form of artificial intelligence – a society. They may even mutate with untold thousands of \"generations\".\n\nThe first quantitative engineering analysis of such a spacecraft was published in 1980 by Robert Freitas, in which the non-replicating Project Daedalus design was modified to include all subsystems necessary for self-replication. The design's strategy was to use the probe to deliver a \"seed\" factory with a mass of about 443 tons to a distant site, have the seed factory replicate many copies of itself there to increase its total manufacturing capacity, over a 500-year period, and then use the resulting automated industrial complex to construct more probes with a single seed factory on board each.\n\nIt has been theorized that a self-replicating starship utilizing relatively conventional theoretical methods of interstellar travel (i.e., no exotic faster-than-light propulsion, and speeds limited to an \"average cruising speed\" of 0.1c.) could spread throughout a galaxy the size of the Milky Way in as little as half a million years.\n\nIn 1981, Frank Tipler put forth an argument that extraterrestrial intelligences do not exist, based on the absence of von Neumann probes. Given even a moderate rate of replication and the history of the galaxy, such probes should already be common throughout space and thus, we should have already encountered them. Because we have not, this shows that extraterrestrial intelligences do not exist. This is thus a resolution to the Fermi paradox – that is, the question of why we have not \"already\" encountered extraterrestrial intelligence if it is common throughout the universe.\n\nA response came from Carl Sagan and William Newman. Now known as \"Sagan's Response\", it pointed out that in fact Tipler had underestimated the rate of replication, and that von Neumann probes should have already started to consume most of the mass in the galaxy. Any intelligent race would therefore, Sagan and Newman reasoned, not design von Neumann probes in the first place, and would try to destroy any von Neumann probes found as soon as they were detected. As Robert Freitas has pointed out, the assumed capacity of von Neumann probes described by both sides of the debate are unlikely in reality, and more modestly reproducing systems are unlikely to be observable in their effects on our Solar System or the Galaxy as a whole.\n\nAnother objection to the prevalence of von Neumann probes is that civilizations of the type that could potentially create such devices may have inherently short lifetimes, and self-destruct before so advanced a stage is reached, through such events as biological or nuclear warfare, nanoterrorism, resource exhaustion, ecological catastrophe, or pandemics.\n\nSimple workarounds exist to avoid the over-replication scenario. Radio transmitters, or other means of wireless communication, could be used by probes programmed not to replicate beyond a certain density (such as five probes per cubic parsec) or arbitrary limit (such as ten million within one century), analogous to the Hayflick limit in cell reproduction. One problem with this defence against uncontrolled replication is that it would only require a single probe to malfunction and begin unrestricted reproduction for the entire approach to fail – essentially a technological cancer – unless each probe also has the ability to detect such malfunction in its neighbours and implements a seek and destroy protocol (which in turn could lead to probe-on-probe space wars if faulty probes first managed to multiply to high numbers before they were found by sound ones, which could then well have programming to replicate to matching numbers so as to manage the infestation). Another workaround is based on the need for spacecraft heating during long interstellar travel. The use of plutonium as a thermal source would limit the ability to self-replicate. The spacecraft would have no programming to make more plutonium even if it found the required raw materials. Another is to program the spacecraft with a clear understanding of the dangers of uncontrolled replication.\n\nThe details of the mission of self-replicating starships can vary widely from proposal to proposal, and the only common trait is the self-replicating nature.\n\nA von Neumann probe is a spacecraft capable of replicating itself. The concept is named after Hungarian American mathematician and physicist John von Neumann, who rigorously studied the concept of self-replicating machines that he called \"Universal Assemblers\" and which are often referred to as \"von Neumann machines\". While von Neumann never applied his work to the idea of spacecraft, theoreticians since then have done so.\n\nIf a self-replicating probe finds evidence of primitive life (or a primitive, low-level culture) it might be programmed to lie dormant, silently observe, attempt to make contact (this variant is known as a Bracewell probe), or even interfere with or guide the evolution of life in some way.\n\nPhysicist Paul Davies of Arizona State University has even raised the possibility of a probe resting on our own Moon, having arrived at some point in Earth's ancient prehistory and remained to monitor Earth, which is very reminiscent of Arthur C. Clarke's \"The Sentinel\" and the Stanley Kubrick .\n\nA variant idea on the interstellar von Neumann probe idea is that of the \"Astrochicken\", proposed by Freeman Dyson. While it has the common traits of self-replication, exploration, and communication with its \"home base\", Dyson conceived the Astrochicken to explore and operate within our own planetary system, and not explore interstellar space.\n\nOxford-based philosopher Nick Bostrom discusses the idea that future powerful superintelligences will create efficient cost-effective space travel and interstellar Von Neumann probes.\n\nAnders Sandberg and Stuart Armstrong argued that launching the colonization of the entire reachable universe through self-replicating probes is well within the capabilities of a star-spanning civilization, and proposed a theoretical approach for achieving it in 32 years, by mining planet Mercury for resources and constructing a Dyson Swarm around the Sun.\n\nA variant of the self-replicating starship is the \"Berserker\". Unlike the benign probe concept, Berserkers are programmed to seek out and exterminate lifeforms and life-bearing exoplanets whenever they are encountered.\n\nThe name is derived from the \"Berserker\" series of novels by Fred Saberhagen which describe a war between humanity and such machines. Saberhagen points out (through one of his characters) that the Berserker warships in his novels are not von Neumann machines themselves, but the larger complex of Berserker machines – including automated shipyards – \"do\" constitute a von Neumann machine. This again brings up the concept of an ecology of von Neumann machines, or even a von Neumann hive entity.\n\nIt is speculated in fiction that Berserkers could be created and launched by a xenophobic civilization (see \"Anvil of Stars\", by Greg Bear, in the section In fiction below) or could theoretically \"mutate\" from a more benign probe. For instance, a von Neumann ship designed for terraforming processes – mining a planet's surface and adjusting its atmosphere to more human-friendly conditions – might malfunction and attack inhabited planets, killing their inhabitants in the process of changing the planetary environment, and then self-replicate and dispatch more ships to attack other planets.\n\nYet another variant on the idea of the self-replicating starship is that of the seeder ship. Such starships might store the genetic patterns of lifeforms from their home world, perhaps even of the species which created it. Upon finding a habitable exoplanet, or even one that might be terraformed, it would try to replicate such lifeforms – either from stored embryos or from stored information using molecular nanotechnology to build zygotes with varying genetic information from local raw materials.\n\nSuch ships might be terraforming vessels, preparing colony worlds for later colonization by other vessels, or – should they be programmed to recreate, raise, and educate individuals of the species that created it – self-replicating colonizers themselves. Seeder ships would be a suitable alternative to Generation ships as a way to colonize worlds too distant to travel to in one lifetime.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "5178616", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5178616", "title": "Seven Heavens", "text": "Seven Heavens\n\nIn religious or mythological cosmology, the seven heavens refer to seven layers of the sky. These were associated in ancient times both with the metaphysical realms of deities and with observed celestial bodies such as the classical planets and fixed stars. The concept, derived from ancient Mesopotamian religions, can be found in the Abrahamic religions such as Islam, Judaism and Christianity; a similar concept is also found in some Indian religions such as Hinduism. Some of these traditions, including Jainism, also have a concept of seven earths or seven underworlds.\n\nThe number seven corresponds to the seven classical planets known to antiquity. Ancient observers noticed that these objects moved at different paces in the sky both from each other and from the fixed stars beyond them: Mercury, Venus, the Moon, the Sun, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn. Unlike comets, which appeared in the sky with no warning, they did move in regular patterns that could be predicted. They also observed that objects in the sky influenced objects on earth, as when movements of the sun affect the behavior of plants or movements of the moon affect ocean tides. \n\nObservations like these led to the development of geocentric cosmologies: earth-centered ideas about the structure of the universe. In some cultures the layers, or \"heavens\", in the sky were understood as vast spheres. Each rotated around the earth at its own pace, taking its associated point of light, and any associated heavenly beings, along. Speculation spread about the effect all celestial objects--not only the sun and moon, but other points of light such as Mars, Jupiter, and fixed stars--might exercise over earthly events. Stories and symbolic associations followed.\n\nThe concept of seven heavens as developed in ancient Mesopotamia symbolised both physical and metaphysical concepts. In the Sumerian language, the words for heaven (or sky) and earth are An and Ki. Sumerian incantations of the late second millennium BCE make references to seven heavens and seven earths. One such incantation is: \"an-imin-bi ki-imin-bi\" (the heavens are seven, the earths are seven.)\n\nThe understanding that the heavens can influence things on earth lent heavenly, magical properties to the number seven itself, as in stories of seven demons, seven churches, seven spirits, or seven thrones. The number seven appears frequently in Babylonian magical rituals. The seven Jewish and the seven Islamic heavens may have had their origin in Babylonian astronomy.\n\nIn general, heaven is not a place for humans in Mesopotamian religion. As Gilgamesh says to his friend Enkidu, in the Epic of Gilgamesh: \"Who can go up to heaven, my friend? Only the gods dwell with Shamash forever\". Along with the idea of seven heavens, the idea of three heavens was also common in ancient Mesopotamia.\n\nThe Qur'an frequently mentions the existence of seven \"samaawat\" (سماوات), plural of \"samaa'a\" (سماء), which is customarily translated as 'heaven'. The word is cognate to Hebrew \"shamayim\" (שמים). Some of the verses in which Qur'an mentions seven \"samaawat\", are , , .\n\nThere are two interpretations of using the number \"seven\". One viewpoint is that the number \"seven\" here simply means \"many\" and is not to be taken literally (the number 7 is often used to imply that in the Arabic language). But many other commentators use the number 7 literally.\n\nOne interpretation of \"heavens\" is that all the stars and galaxies (including the Milky Way) are all part of the \"first heaven\", and \"beyond that six still bigger worlds are there,\" which have yet to be discovered by scientists.\n\nIn other sources, the concept is presented in metaphorical terms. Each of the seven heavens is depicted as being composed of a different material, and Islamic prophets are resident in each. The first heaven is depicted as being made of silver and is the home of Adam and Eve, as well as the angels of each star. The second heaven is depicted as being made of gold and is the home of John the Baptist and Jesus. The third heaven is depicted as being made of pearls or other dazzling stones; Joseph and Azrael are resident there. The fourth heaven is depicted as being made of white gold; Enoch and the Angel of Tears resides there. The fifth heaven is depicted as being made of silver; Aaron and the Avenging Angel hold court over this heaven. The sixth heaven is composed of garnets and rubies; Moses can be found here. The seventh heaven, which borrows some concepts from its Jewish counterpart, is depicted as being composed of divine light incomprehensible to the mortal man. Abraham is a resident of the seventh heaven. According to some hadiths, the highest level of Jannah is \"firdaws\", and Sidrat al-Muntaha, a Lote tree, marks the end of the seventh heaven.\n\nAccording to Shi'ite sources, A Hadith from Imam Ali mentioned the name of Seven Heavens as below:\n\nAccording to the Talmud, the universe is made of seven heavens (\"Shamayim\")\n\n\nThe Jewish Merkavah and Heichalot literature was devoted to discussing the details of these heavens, sometimes in connection with traditions relating to Enoch, such as the Third Book of Enoch.\n\nAn explicit reference to the Third Heaven appears in the Christian New Testament canon. A Pauline epistle, penned in Macedonia around 55CE, describes this mystical experience: \n\n\"I know a person in Christ who fourteen years ago was caught up to the third heaven—whether in the body or out of the body I do not know; God knows. And I know that such a person—whether in the body or out of the body I do not know; God knows—was caught up into Paradise and heard things that are not to be told, that no mortal is permitted to repeat.\" \n\nThe description is usually taken as an oblique reference by the author to himself. The passage appears to reflect first-century beliefs among Jews and Christians that the realm of Paradise existed in a different heaven than the highest one--an impression that may find support in the original Greek wording (closer to \"caught away\" than \"caught up\").\n\nIn the second century, Irenaeus also knows seven heavens (see his \"Demonstration of Apostolic Preaching\" 9; cf. \"Against Heresies\" 1.5.2).\n\nOver the course of the middle ages Christian thinkers expanded the ancient Mesopotamian seven-heaven model into a system of ten heavens. This cosmology, taught in the first European universities by the Scholastics, reached its supreme literary expression in The Divine Comedy by Dante Aligheri.\n\nThe Second Book of Enoch, also written in the first century CE, describes the mystical ascent of the patriarch Enoch through a hierarchy of Ten Heavens. Enoch passes through the Garden of Eden in the Third Heaven on his way to meet the Lord face-to-face in the Tenth (chapter 22). Along the way he encounters vividly described populations of angels who torment wrongdoers; he sees homes, olive oil, and flowers.\n\nThe book's depiction of ten heavens represented an expansion of the ancient seven-heaven model. This expanded cosmology was developed further in medieval Christianity.\n\nAccording to some Puranas, the Brahmanda is divided into fourteen worlds. Among these worlds, seven are upper worlds which constitute of Bhuloka (the Earth), Bhuvarloka, Svarloka, Maharloka, Janarloka, Tapoloka and Satyaloka, and seven are lower worlds which constitute of Atala, Vitala, Sutala, Talatala, Mahatala, Rasatala and Patala.\n\n\n\n\n"}

He is a Catholic martyr, declared venerable by Pope Leo XIII. The year of death is in question: the \"Victoria County History\" for Kent puts the events in 1534. It references Thomas Bourchier's \"Historia Ecclesiastica de Martyrio Fratrum...\", \"though the writer assigns them to 1537\". Dom Bede Camm, O.S.B., places Belchiam's date of death as August 3, 1537. \"Notes and Queries\" lists him as dying in 1538.\n\nBelchiam was a friar of the convent at Greenwich. He was imprisoned, with other Franciscans, for refusing to take the oath of the royal supremacy, and declaring the king to be a heretic. He was considered an accomplished prescher, and wrote a sermon on the text, 'Behold, they that wear soft clothing are in kings' houses' (Matt. xi. 8), in which he lashed the vices of the court and the avarice and inconstancy of the clergy. At the intercession of Thomas Wriothesley some of the friars were released. Belchiam was kept in Newgate, where he died of starvation on 3 August 1537. Belchiam survived the last of his two fellow-prisoners upwards of a month, he likely being the youngest. As he lay dying, \"...it so fell out that the frame of the earth gave a surprising shock, that the jail keepers were affrighted, and it was thought to be a universal earthquake...It is said that the king gave orders for the burial of Belchiam, his majesty being startled at the uncommon accidents that happened at his departure out of this life.\" \n\nA copy of his sermon, found in the prison after his death, was brought to Henry VIII, who was affected by it, but had it burnt. Another copy was preserved by the friars, and Thomas Bourchier, writing in 1583, expressed a hope that it might be published; which apparently was never done.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "27498249", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27498249", "title": "Wiedergänger", "text": "Wiedergänger\n\nThe name Wiedergänger refers to different zombie or ghost phenomena from different cultural areas. The word means \"one who walks again\" in German. The core of the wiedergänger myth is the concept of the deceased, who — often in the form of a physical phenomenon — return to the world of the living. They usually cause problems and frighten living people. They exist either to avenge some injustice they experienced while alive, or because their soul is not ready to be released, as a consequence of their former way of life.\n\nIn different parts of Germany, until the early 20th century, the belief was common that dead ones lived on, after their death, and exerted a disastrous influence from the grave. This influence was believed to be partly done via a telepathic effect (sympathy charm), so that the \"nachzehrer\", as the villain was called, did not need to rise from the grave and still could suck the vitality from living persons with his open mouth, his open eye and by gnawing on the burial shroud. Other undead, in the belief of the people, rose from the graves and jumped on the back of night ramblers. This \"Aufhocker\" could assume different shapes, for example in the Rhineland, the form of the werewolf. The humans had to carry him, frequently as far as to the wall of the churchyard or to the place where the body was buried. The aufhocker (also called \"huckop\" or \"huckupp\") became ever more heavy, and the victim would finally break down exhausted or dead. In some legends, the troubled humans succeeded in banishing or redeeming the villain by a spell or a prayer. Especially in the areas marked by Catholicism the belief of the up-squatting wiedergänger merged with the belief of the soul, so that folklorists around 1920 had considerable difficulties to separate a belief in ghosts from the old nuclear belief of the undead wiedergänger. The Aufhocker after all could, according to the tradition, not be a ghost, because he had a tangible body, which also increased in weight from step to step, which would not have been possible for an immaterial spirit. Another form of the physical wiedergänger is the headless rider that, frequently mentioned in West German legends, entered into world literature and even into the history of film through the American poet Washington Irving and his novel \"The Legend of Sleepy Hollow\".\n\nIn the sagas, wiedergänger in the form of draugar are a frequent motif. This occurs, for example, in the Hrómundar saga Gripssonar or in the Laxdœla saga. Whoever met a wiedergänger is often threatened by imminent death. Remarkable here is the stress on the physicality of the wiedergänger, which on the one hand shows in its superhuman power, but on the other hand, in its vulnerability: draugar can be killed by decapitation.\n\n\n\n"}

Broadnax (December 28, 1916 – June 1, 1992), also known as \"Little Ax\", \"Wilbur\", \"Willie\", and \"Wilmer\", was an American hard gospel quartet singer.\n\nBroadnax was born in Houston, Texas in 1916, William Broadnax and Gussie Frazier.\n\nAfter moving to southern California in the mid-1940s, Wilmer and brother, William, joined the Southern Gospel Singers, a group which performed primarily on weekends. Wilmer and William soon formed their own quartet, the Golden Echoes. William eventually left for Atlanta, where he joined the Five Trumpets, but Willmer stayed on as lead singer. In 1949 the group, augmented by future Soul Stirrer Paul Foster, recorded a single of \"When the Saints Go Marching In\" for Specialty Records. Label chief Art Rupe decided to drop them before they could record a follow-up, and shortly thereafter the Golden Echoes disbanded.\n\nIn 1950, Broadnax joined the Spirit of Memphis Quartet. Along with Broadnax, the group featured two other leads -- Jethro \"Jet\" Bledsoe, a bluesy crooner, and Silas Steele, an overpowering baritone. The Spirit of Memphis Quartet recorded for King Records, and Broadnax appeared on their releases at least until 1952. Shortly after that, Broadnax moved on, working with The Fairfield Four, and in the early 1960s as one of the replacements for Archie Brownlee in the Five Blind Boys of Mississippi. Until 1965 Wilmer headed a quartet called \"Little Ax and the Golden Echoes,\" which released some singles on Peacock Records. By then, quartet singing was fading in commercial viability, and Broadnax retired from touring.\n\nIn retirement, Broadnax continued to record new material occasionally with the Blind Boys into the 1970s and 1980s.\n\nUpon Broadnex's death in 1992, it was discovered that Broadnax was a trans man.\n"}
