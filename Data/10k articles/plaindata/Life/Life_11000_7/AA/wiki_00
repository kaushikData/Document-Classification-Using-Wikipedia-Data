UN peacekeepers and Nato troops scrambled to contain a raging gun battle between Serbs and ethnic Albanians. In Serbia the events were also called the March Pogrom.\n\nInternational courts in Pristina have prosecuted several people who attacked several Serbian Orthodox churches, handing down jail sentences ranging from 21 months to 16 years.\n\nThe Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) was an ethnic-Albanian paramilitary organisation which had as its founding goal unification of Albanian inhabited lands in the Balkans, stressing Albanian culture, ethnicity and nation. Conflict escalated from 1997 onward due to the Yugoslavian army retaliating with a crackdown in the region resulting in violence and population displacements. The bloodshed, ethnic cleansing of thousands of Albanians driving them into neighbouring countries and the potential of it to destabilize the region provoked intervention by international organizations and agencies, such as the United Nations, NATO and INGOs. Some people from non-Albanian communities such as the Serbs and Romani fled Kosovo fearing revenge attacks by armed people and returning refugees while others were pressured by the KLA and armed gangs to leave. Post conflict Kosovo was placed under an international United Nations framework with the \"UN Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo\" (UNMIK) overseeing administrative affairs and the \"UN Kosovo Force\" (KFOR) dealing with defence. Within post-conflict Kosovo Albanian society, calls for retaliation for previous violence done by Serb forces during the war circulated through public culture. In 2004, prolonged negotiations over Kosovo's future status, sociopolitical problems and nationalist sentiments resulted in the Kosovo unrest.\n\nOn 15 March 2004 an 18-year-old Serb, Jovica Ivić, was murdered in a drive-by shooting in the village of Čaglavica in the central region of Kosovo.\n\nOn 16 March, three KLA war veterans associations organized widespread demonstrations in ethnic Albanian cities and towns, protesting the arrests of former KLA leaders on war crime charges, including the February arrests of four commanders. The pro-KLA, anti-UNMIK protests, with 18,000 protesters, lay the basis for the following demonstrations sparked by the sensational reports of drowning of three Albanian children.\n\nOn 16 March, three Albanian children drowned in the Ibar River in the village of Čabar, near the Serb community of Zubin Potok. A fourth boy survived. It was speculated that he and his friends had been chased into the river by Serbs in revenge for the shooting of Ivić the previous day, but this claim has not been proven.\n\nUN police spokesman Neeraj Singh said the surviving boy had been under intense pressure from ethnic Albanian journalists who had suggested what he should say. His version of events differed from that of two other children who had also been in the river, Singh told a news conference in Pristina. The spokesperson said there were \"very significant\" inconsistencies in the accounts given by the child during two separate interviews, and a lack of corroboration of his story. \"In fact, it is logically at odds in several respects with other evidence,\" Mr. Singh said. The UN found no evidence that Serbs were responsible for drowning the three Albanian children.\n\nOn 17 and 18 March 2004, a wave of violent riots swept through Kosovo, triggered by two incidents perceived as ethnically-motivated acts. Demonstrations, although seemingly spontaneous at the outset, quickly focused on Serbs throughout Kosovo.\n27 people were killed (11 Kosovo Albanians, 16 Kosovo Serbs), more than 900 persons were injured (including 65 international police officers and 58 Kosovo Police Service officers), and more than 800 buildings destroyed or damaged (including 29 churches or monasteries). \n\nBy one estimate, more than 50,000 people participated in the riots. The Legal System Monitoring Section of the OSCE Mission in Kosovo (“the OSCE”) has closely monitored the investigations and trials from March 2004 until present. With its monitoring of 73 cases (Municipal, District and Minor Offences Courts) pending between December 2005 and March 2008, the OSCE now follows up on a first report of December 2005.\n\nThousands of Albanians gathered at the south end of the bridge across the Ibar at Kosovska Mitrovica, which divides the Serb and Albanian districts of the town. A large crowd of Serbs gathered at the north end to prevent the Albanians from crossing. Peacekeepers from the NATO-led Kosovo Force (KFOR) blockaded the bridge, using tear gas, rubber bullets and stun grenades to keep the crowds apart. However, gunmen on both sides opened fire with sub-machine guns and grenades, killing at least eight people (two Albanians and six Serbs) and wounding over 300. Eleven peacekeepers were also injured, of which two seriously.\n\nThe violence quickly spread to other parts of Kosovo, with Kosovo Serb communities and Serbian cultural heritage (churches and monasteries) attacked by crowds of Albanians. Serb returnees were attacked. Some of the locations were ostensibly under the protection of KFOR at the time. During the riots and violence, eight Serbs were killed. Among damaged property were at least 35 churches, including 18 monuments of culture, demolished, burnt or severely damaged. The casualty toll at the end of the day was 28 and 600 people were injured, including 61 peacekeepers and 55 police officers.\n\nIn Čaglavica, 12,000 Kosovo Albanian rioters tried to storm the Serb-populated areas. Norwegian KFOR peacekeepers created a blockade by using tear gas, rubber bullets, and stun grenades, in order to keep the two groups apart. A truck was driven by a Kosovo Albanian at full speed towards the barricade in an attempt to penetrate the line. After firing warning shots at the truck, the Norwegians had to use deadly force to avoid friendly casualties, and shot the driver. 16 Norwegian peacekeepers were injured, and 13 had to be evacuated. \n\nAnother KFOR unit consisting of mostly Swedish soldiers also participated in defending Čaglavica that day, supported by people from the barracks who normally worked with non-military tasks. Lieutenant Colonel Hans Håkansson, who commanded 700 people during the unrest, reported that the fighting went on for 11 hours, and that many collapsed due to dehydration and injuries while struggling to fend off waves of rioters. In total, 35 people were injured while defending the town. Hans Håkansson was awarded with a medal for his actions by the Royal Swedish Academy of War Sciences in 2005.\n\nFollowing the attacks in Čaglavica, the mob of Albanians turned their attention on the few remaining Serbs living in Priština in the YU Program apartments. The apartments came under attack after the mob of Albanians blocked all of the entrances and set fire to the ground floors. Serbs who tried to flee the apartments were shot at by firearms or stabbed by members of the crowd. The mob began to loot apartments and were chanting pro Kosovo Liberation Army chants and calling for the killing of Serbs. It took KFOR and UNMIK police over 6 hours to evacuate the Serbs who were under constant fire from armed Albanians. Following the evacuation the crowd began to converge on the Church of the Christ Savour burning and damaging the facade and inside.\n\nAlbanians rioted in the city of Peć, attacking UN offices. One Albanian was killed by UN police. Serb returnees were attacked at .\n\nAlbanians and KFOR were engaged in gunfights in the town of Lipljan. Four Serbs were murdered, while Serbs taking refuge in the local Orthodox church were attacked.\n\nAll Serb houses in the Serb-inhabited village of Svinjare in Vučitrn, near Kosovska Mitrovica, were burnt down.\n\nOn 17 March, ethnic Albanians started attacking the Serb settlement in Prizren, including the Seminary, and reportedly there was no UNMIK, Kosovo Police and KFOR present there at the time. The mob set the Seminary on fire, with people inside, and beat several elder people, with one man dying in the burning. \n\nThe German KFOR's refusal to mobilize to protect the local Serbs are one of the main security failures of the 2004 unrest. UNMIK in Prizren said that the terror, 56 Serb houses and 5 historical churches that were burnt down, could have been prevented by the KFOR.\n\nIn an urgent appeal, issued on 18 March by the extraordinary session of the Expanded Convocation of the Holy Synod of Serbian Orthodox Church (), it was reported that a number of Serbian churches and shrines in Kosovo had been damaged or destroyed by rioters. At least 30 sites were completely destroyed, more or less destroyed, or further destroyed (sites that had been previously damaged). Apart from the churches and monasteries, tens of support buildings (such as parish buildings, economical buildings and residences), bringing the number close to 100 buildings of the SPC destroyed. \n\nAll churches and objects of the SPC in Prizren were destroyed. The list includes several UNESCO World Heritage Sites. Among those destroyed and damaged were:\n\n\nHRW lists 27 Orthodox churches and monasteries burned and looted.\n\nKosovo Albanian politicians such as President Ibrahim Rugova and Prime Minister Bajram Rexhepi joined UN governor Harri Holkeri, NATO southern commander Gregory Johnson, and other KFOR officials in condemning the violence and appealing for peace in Kosovo.\n\nHashim Thaçi, the former Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) leader, \"rejected ethnic division of Kosovo and said independence is a pre-condition for stability in the region.\" He has also said, \"Kosovo, NATO and the West have not fought for Kosovo only for Albanians, nor for a Kosovo ruled by violence. Violence is not the way to solve problems, violence only creates problems.\"\n\nKosovo Police established a special investigation team to handle cases related to the 2004 unrest and according to Kosovo Judicial Council by the end of 2006 the 326 charges filed by municipal and district prosecutors for criminal offenses in connection with the unrest had resulted in 200 indictments: convictions in 134 cases, and courts acquitted eight and dismissed 28; 30 cases were pending. International prosecutors and judges handled the most sensitive cases. By March 2010, 143 Kosovars of Albanian ethnicity were convicted, of which 67 received prison terms of over a year.\n\nThe events in Kosovo brought an immediate angry reaction on the streets of Serbia. On the evening of 17 March, crowds gathered in Belgrade, Novi Sad and Niš to demonstrate against the treatment of the Kosovo Serbs. Despite appeals for calm by Metropolitan Amfilohije, the 17th-century Bajrakli Mosque was set on fire. Islam Aga mosque in the southern city of Niš was also set on fire, while demonstrators chanted \"Kill, kill Albanians!\" When police arrived the mosque was already burning and some media reported that the police didn't move the crowd, so they blocked the fire fighters access to the mosque, leaving them unable to extinguish the fire. Both buildings were extensively damaged but were saved from complete destruction by the intervention of police and firefighters. Also properties of Muslim minorities, such as Goranis, Turks or Albanians were vandalized in Novi Sad and other cities throughout Serbia. Human Rights Watch has concluded that the Serbian state failed to prosecute violence in Novi Sad.\n\nThe Serbian government publicly denounced the violence in Kosovo. Prime Minister Vojislav Koštunica strongly criticized the failure of NATO and the UN to prevent the violence, and called for a state of emergency to be imposed on Kosovo. He gave a speech blaming organized Albanian separatists: \"The events in northern Kosovo-Metohija reveal the true nature of Albanian separatism, its violent and terrorist nature ... [The government will] do all it can to stop the terror in Kosovo\". The Minister of Minority Rights of Serbia and Montenegro, Rasim Ljajić, himself a Muslim, said \"What is now happening in Kosovo confirms two things: that this is a collapse of the international mission, and a total defeat of the international community.\" Nebojsa Čović, the Serbian government's chief negotiator on matters relating to Kosovo, was sent to Kosovska Mitrovica on March 18 in a bid to calm the situation there. Serbian security forces also guarded the border between Serbia and Kosovo in a bid to prevent demonstrators and paramilitaries from entering the province to foment further unrest. The events were compared by Prime Minister Koštunica to ethnic cleansing.\n\nThe Serbs, represented by the \"Union of Serbs in Kosovo and Metohija\", described the ordeal as \"genocide\" in a letter sent to the Serbian and Russian patriarchs, to Russian President Vladimir Putin and the Serbian government, where, besides that, they quote the burning of seven villages during the World War II-German occupation to the \"several hundreds\" burnt \"under the rule of the troops of Christian Europe and America\" and according to which the \"occupation of Kosovo surpasses all we had to sustain under fascism.\" The spared Serb villages are compared to \"concentration camps\" because of the missing freedom of movement, electricity and heating. According to the letter, after 1999 there were 8,500 homicides or disappearances of non-Albanian people with no single accomplice tried.\n\nIn 2011, seven years after the incident, Foreign Minister Vuk Jeremić spoke at the Wheaton College in Chicago:\n\nIn less than 72 hours, 35 churches and monasteries were set on fire, many of which date back to the 14th century or even further away in history, which represents an irretrievable loss for the mankind. Dozens of people were killed. Several thousand were wounded. Thousands of houses and shops were leveled to the ground. More than 4,000 Kosovo Serbs were expelled from their homes.\n\nIn Serbia the events were also called the March Pogrom.\n\nThe international community was taken by surprise by the sudden upsurge in violence. Kosovo had been fairly quiet since the end of 1999, although there had been occasional small-scale ethnic clashes throughout the past five years and an ongoing tension between Serbs and Albanians. This had, however, largely gone unnoticed by the Western media since 1999.\n\nKFOR troops closed Kosovo's borders with the remainder of Serbia and Montenegro and the UN suspended flights in and out of the province. NATO announced on 18 March that it would send another 1,000 troops – 750 of them from the United Kingdom – to reinforce the 18,500 troops already there.\n\nThe UN and European Union both appealed for calm, calling on local leaders to restrain their supporters. UN Secretary General Kofi Annan urged both sides to cooperate with the peacekeeping forces but pointedly reminded the Kosovo Albanians that they had a responsibility \"to protect and promote the rights of all people within Kosovo, particularly its minorities\".\n\nAn Austrian OSCE official called the events an orchestrated plan to drive out the remaining Serbs, while one anonymous UNMIK official reportedly referred to the event as \"Kosovo's Kristallnacht\". The commander of NATO's South Flank, Admiral Gregory G. Johnson, said on 19 March that the violence verged on ethnic cleansing of Serbs by Albanians. On 20 March, Kosovo's UN administrator, Harri Holkeri, told journalists that \"Maybe the very beginning was spontaneous but after the beginning certain extremist groups had an opportunity to orchestrate the situation and that is why we urgently are working to get those perpetrators into justice.\"\n\nAccording to Amnesty International, at least 19 people died—11 Albanians and eight Serbs—and over 1,000 were injured while some 730 houses belonging to minorities, mostly Kosovo Serbs, as well as 36 Orthodox churches, monasteries and other religious and cultural sites were damaged or destroyed. In less than 48 hours, 4,100 minority community members were newly displaced (more than the total of 3,664 that had returned throughout 2003), of whom 82% were Serbs and the remaining 18% included Romani (and Ashkali) as well as an estimated 350 Albanians from the Serb-majority areas of Kosovska Mitrovica and Leposavić.\n\n\n\n\n"}

A. Bayona and written by Patrick Ness, based on his novel of the same name. The film stars Sigourney Weaver, Felicity Jones, Toby Kebbell, Lewis MacDougall, and Liam Neeson, and tells the story of Conor (MacDougall), a child whose mother (Jones) is terminally ill; one night, he is visited by a monster in the form of a giant anthropomorphic yew tree (Neeson), who states that he will come back and tell Conor three stories. The film is an international co-production between Spain, United Kingdom and the United States.\n\n\"A Monster Calls\" premiered at the 2016 Toronto International Film Festival on 10 September 2016. It was then released in Spain on 7 October 2016, and in the United Kingdom on 1 January 2017. In the United States, the film began a limited release in on 23 December 2016, followed by a wide release on 6 January 2017. It received positive reviews, being praised for its themes, directing, performances and visual effects, but underperformed at the box office, grossing $47 million worldwide on a budget of $43 million.\n\nTwelve-year-old Conor O'Malley must face his mother's terminal cancer, his strict grandmother, his estranged father and the school bully, Harry. One night at 12:07 a.m., Conor is visited by the tree-like Monster, who tells Conor it has to come to tell him three true stories, after which Conor must tell the Monster his own story: the truth behind his nightmare, which Conor refuses to do.\n\nAn old king who has lost his entire family (with his sons killed in fierce battles and his wife committing suicide in her grief) save a young grandson, remarries a beautiful young woman. He dies before the prince comes of age, and many believe the queen poisoned the king. Not wanting to hand the kingdom over to the prince in a year, she plots to marry the prince and remain queen. The prince runs away with a farm girl he loves. They stop and sleep under a yew tree (the Monster), but in the morning he finds the young woman murdered. The prince tells the villagers that the queen, a witch, must have done it, and they rally to overthrow her. Before the commoners can reach the queen, the Monster carries her away to a far-off land where she lives out the rest of her life in peace. Though she was indeed a witch, she did not kill the farm girl or the king, who actually died of old age. The prince had murdered the farm girl himself in order to inspire his people to back him into overthrowing the queen. After the queen was taken to safety by the Monster, the prince continued to rule the kingdom in the grandfather's place.\n\nAn apothecary follows old traditions and beliefs, using herbs and brews to cure ailments. His business becomes less popular as a local parson tells his congregation not to accept the apothecary's old ways and denying the apothecary use of an old Yew tree. When the parson's two daughters become sick, the parson asks the apothecary to save their lives after all other resources are exhausted. When the apothecary asks why he should help a man who has turned people away from his skills and denied him the yew tree, his best source of healing ingredients, the parson promises to give him the tree and deliver the parishioners to him as customers. Yet the apothecary says that he cannot help, and the girls die. The Monster awakens from the yew tree to destroy the parson's house and raze it to the ground as punishment.\n\nWhile the apothecary was a greedy man, he was a healer and would have saved lives, including the girls', if the parson had allowed him his way of life. The parson was a man of belief but was willing to discard his beliefs when they were in the way. The healing traditions followed by the apothecary require belief in order to work; without the parson's, the apothecary was unable to treat the two girls. Belief is half the cure.\n\nA man was invisible because no one ever saw him. Tired of this, he summoned the Monster to ensure people would notice him. Though people now notice him, the man finds himself more alone than before.\n\nConor must confront his nightmare to tell the fourth story. His mother has been pulled to the edge of a cliff by a sudden collapse of the ground, and Conor must hold her hand to save her from falling. Eventually, his grip fails and his mother falls. The Monster forces Conor to confess the truth: Conor loosened his grip on purpose. While he could have held on longer, he let go in order to stop the pain of having to hold on.\n\nThrough the Monster, Conor ultimately understands that although he does not want his mother to die, it is something he must accept, and he must not feel guilty for wanting it to be over so he does not have to feel pain anymore. After this, Conor returns, with the Monster by his side, to comfort his mother one last time, and she dies at 12:07. He returns home with his grandmother, with whom he has reached an understanding, and she gives Conor the room that used to be his mother's. In the room, he finds his mother's old art book, which depicts the stories that were told to him by the Monster, and a drawing of his mother as a child with the Monster.\n\n\nFocus Features bought the rights to the book in March 2014. Patrick Ness, the book's author, served as the film's screenwriter, with J. A. Bayona hired as director. On 23 April 2014, Felicity Jones joined the film to play the boy's mother. On 8 May, Liam Neeson was cast to voice the Monster, and on 18 August, Sigourney Weaver joined to play the boy's grandmother. On August 19, Toby Kebbell was also cast in the film. On 3 September, author Ness tweeted that Lewis MacDougall had been set for one of the lead roles as the boy in the film. On 30 September, Geraldine Chaplin joined the cast.\n\nPrincipal photography began on 30 September 2014, in Spain and Britain. On 9 October, the filming began on location in Preston, Lancashire, Rivington Pike (Chorley/Horwich), Blackpool Pleasure Beach and Marsden, West Yorkshire\n\nLiam Neeson, who voices the titular tree creature, was not on set throughout the shooting process, and completed his motion-capture performance during a two-week period beforehand, with MacDougall in the room. Tom Holland worked on set as The Monster with Neeson absent.\n\nOriginally scheduled for an October 2016 release, the film was delayed in order to avoid competition from \"\", \"Boo! A Madea Halloween\", \"\", and \"Keeping Up with the Joneses\". It was rescheduled for a limited roll out on 23 December 2016, followed by a wide release on 6 January 2017. The film was released in the United Kingdom on 1 January 2017, by Entertainment One and Lionsgate, and in India on 6 January 2017, by B4U Relativity.\n\n\"A Monster Calls\" grossed $3.7 million in the United States and Canada and $43.5 million in other territories for a worldwide total of $47.2 million, against a production budget of $43 million.\n\nIn North America, the film had its wide release alongside the opening of \"\" and the wide expansions of \"Hidden Figures\" and \"Lion\", and was initially expected to gross around $10 million from 1,523 theaters over the weekend. However, after making just $659,000 on its first day, weekend projections were lowered to $2 million, which it ended up grossing, finishing 13th at the box office. In its second weekend of wide release it grossed $537,262 (a drop of 74.2%) and in its third week made just $19,080 (a drop of 96.4%) after being pulled from all but 42 theaters, one of the biggest third week theater drops in history.\n\nThe aggregate site Rotten Tomatoes gives the film an approval rating of 86% based on 241 reviews, and an average rating of 7.6/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \"\"A Monster Calls\" deftly balances dark themes and fantastical elements to deliver an engrossing and uncommonly moving entry in the crowded coming-of-age genre\". UK film website, Movie Metropolis called the film \"a masterpiece\" and one of the finest movies of the year, rating it a full 5 stars out of 5. At Metacritic, the film has an average score of 76 out of 100 based on 40 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A\" on an A+ to F scale.\n\n"}

Agüeybaná II led the Taínos of Puerto Rico in the Battle of Yagüecas, also known as the \"Taíno rebellion of 1511\" against Juan Ponce de León and the Spanish Conquistadors.\n\n\"Agüeybana\", which has been interpreted by 19th and 20th-century authors as meaning \"The Great Sun\", was the hereditary title shared by the family that ruled the theocratic monarchy of Borikén, governing the hierarchy over the rest of the regional chiefs or caciques. Like other nobiliary recognitions within Taíno culture, it was passed down through the maternal bloodline. The Spanish Hispanicized the title to be the equivalent of the European concept of kings, with contemporary writers such as Juan de Castellanos employing the title of \"Rey Agüeybana\" (literally meaning \"King Agüeybana\") when referring to him after inheriting it from his brother and becoming the second monarch to lead the Taíno during the 1510s.\n\nAgüeybaná, the older, received Spanish conquistador Juan Ponce de León upon Ponce de León's arrival to Puerto Rico in 1508. According to an old Taíno tradition, Agüeybaná practiced the \"guaytiao\", a Taíno ritual in which he and Juan Ponce de León became friends and exchanged names. The hospitality and friendly treatment that the Spaniards received from Agüeybaná made it easy for the Spaniards to betray and conquer the island later. Agüeybaná's actions helped to maintain the peace between the Taíno and the Spaniards, a peace which was to be short-lived.\n\nUpon the senior Agüeybaná's death in 1510, his brother Güeybaná (better known as Agüeybaná II) became the most powerful Cacique in the entire island. Agüeybaná II had his doubts about the \"godly\" status of the Spaniards. He came up with a plan to test the perceived godly nature of the Spanish: he and Urayoán (cacique of Añasco) sent some of their tribe members to lure a Spaniard by the name of Diego Salcedo into a river and drown him. They watched over Salcedo's body to make sure that he would not resuscitate. Salcedo's death was enough to convince him and the rest of the Taíno people that the Spaniards were not gods.\n\nAgüeybaná II, held \"Areytos\" (war dances) or secret meetings with others caciques where he organized a revolt against the Spaniards. Cristobal de Sotomayor sent a spy, Juan González, to one of the \"Areitos\" where he learned of Agüeybaná's plans. In spite of the warning, Agüeybana II killed Sotomayor and his men, and gravely wounded González. Juan González escaped making his way to Caparra where he reported the killings to Ponce de León. Meanwhile, Guarionex, cacique of Utuado, attacked the village of Sotomayor (present day Aguada) and killed eighty of its inhabitants.\n\nIn 1511, in the region known as Yagüecas some 11,000 to 15,000 Taínos had assembled against some 80 to 100 Spaniards. Before the start of the battle, a Spanish soldier using an arquebus shot and killed a native. It is presumed this was Agüeybaná II, because the warrior was wearing a golden necklace which only a cacique wore.\n\nAfter the death of Agüeybaná II, the native warriors retracted and became disorganized. Agüeybaná II's followers opted for engaging the Spaniards via guerilla tactics. Such guerilla warfare rebellion lasted for next 8 years, until 1519. A second round of raids erupted in 1513 when Ponce de Leon departed the island to explore Florida. The settlement of Caparra, the seat of the island government at that time, was sacked and burned by an alliance between Taínos and natives from the northeastern Antilles.\n\nBy 1520 the Taíno presence in the Island had almost disappeared. A government census in 1530 reports the existence of only 1,148 Taínos remaining in Puerto Rico. However, oppressive conditions for the surviving Taíno continued. Many of those who stayed on the island soon died of either the cruel treatment that they had received or of the smallpox epidemic, which had attacked the island in 1519.\n\nAgüeybaná II is admired in Puerto Rico for his loyalty to his people. Puerto Rico has named many public buildings and streets after him:\n\n\n"}

Starting with Fr. James Fitton's account in 1872, Rev. Sherwood Healy (1876), Bernard Corr (1891), and Harold Dijon (1905), George Francis O’Dwyer (1921), Michael O’Brien (1937), John Henry Cutler (1962), Rev. Vincent A. Lapomarda (1989-90), Margaret E. Fitzgerald and Joseph A. King (1990), \"White Cargo\" (2008), Alan Titley (2011-14), Prof. Robert Allison of Suffolk University, Boston (2014), all added various fictions to her biography .\n\nAll that can be said of her early life is that she was born in Ireland, apparently transported to Barbados after the Cromwell's invasion of Ireland.\n\nBy 1680, Ann and her daughter Mary were living in Boston — at the time, part of the Massachusetts Bay Colony — where they worked as housekeepers for John Goodwin. In the summer of 1688, Martha Goodwin (age 13) accused Ann Glover's daughter of stealing laundry. This caused Ann to have a fierce argument with Martha and the Goodwin children, which then supposedly caused them to become ill and to start acting strangely. The doctor who was called suggested it was caused by witchcraft, because he could not offer another diagnosis or heal the children. Martha and the other children seemed to be \"bewitched\" \n\nGlover was arrested and tried for witchcraft. Her answers could not be understood, and for a time her accusers thought she was speaking a language of the devil, but it became clear that this was not the case. In the words of her leading accuser, the Reverend Cotton Mather, “the court could have no answer from her but in the Irish which was her native language…” (\"Memorable Providence\", 1689). By that time she had apparently lost the ability to speak English, though she could still understand it. An interpreter was found for her and the trial proceeded.\n\nCotton Mather wrote that Glover was \"a scandalous old Irishwoman, very poor, a Roman Catholic and obstinate in idolatry.\" At her trial it was demanded of her to say the Lord's Prayer. She recited it in Irish and broken Latin, but was unable to say it in English. There was a belief that an inability to recite the Lord's prayer was the mark of a witch. Her house was searched and \"small images\" or doll-like figures were found. When Mather was interrogating her she supposedly said that she prayed to a host of spirits and Mather took this to mean that these spirits were demons. Many of the accusations against Ann used spectral evidence, which cannot be proven. Cotton Mather visited Glover in prison where he said that she supposedly engaged in night-time trysts with the devil and other evil spirits. It was considered that Ann might not be of sound mind and could possibly be mentally ill. Five of the six physicians who examined her found her to be competent. She was therefore pronounced guilty and put to death by hanging.\n\nOn November 16, 1688, Glover was hanged in Boston amid mocking shouts from the crowd. When she was taken out to be hanged she said that her death would not relieve the children of their malady. There are several testaments as to her final words. According to some she said that the children would keep suffering because she was not the only witch to have afflicted them, but when asked to name the other witches, she refused. Another account says that Glover said that killing her would be useless because it was someone else who had bewitched the children. Either way, Ann Glover did believe in witches. A Boston merchant who knew her, Robert Calef, said that \"Goody Glover was a despised, crazy, poor old woman, an Irish Catholic who was tried for afflicting the Goodwin children. Her behavior at her trial was like that of one distracted. They did her cruel. The proof against her was wholly deficient. The jury brought her guilty. She was hung. She died a Catholic.\"\n\nThe evidence adduced against her is open to question. When Glover told Mather that she prayed to a host of spirits she may have been talking about Catholic saints. The dolls she had in her possession and which were believed to have been used for witchcraft might actually have been crude representations of Catholic saints. The majority of the population at that time and place was Puritan, and there was Puritan prejudice against Catholics.\n\nOne contemporary writer recorded that, \"There was a great concourse of people to see if the Papist would relent, her one cat was there, fearsome to see. They would to destroy the cat, but Mr. Calef would not permit it. Before her executioners she was bold and impudent, making to forgive her accusers and those who put her off. She predicted that her death would not relieve the children saying that it was not she that afflicted them.\"\n\nAnn's daughter Mary reportedly suffered a mental break from the strain of her mother's trial: \"her mind gave way under the strain,\" and she ended her days \"a raving maniac.\" She was likely the same “Mary Glover the Irish Catholic Witch” who was imprisoned in Boston alongside convicted pirates Thomas Hawkins, Thomas Pound, and William Coward (whose trial shared some of the same judges as Ann Glover's, and who were also ministered to by Cotton Mather) in late 1689.\n\nThree hundred years later in 1988, the Boston City Council proclaimed November 16 as \"Goody Glover Day\". She is the only victim of the witchcraft hysteria in the Massachusetts Bay Colony to receive such a tribute. Glover's accusations and death occurred before the better known Salem Witch Trials in Massachusetts and her trial would become the basis for many of the cases in the 1692 Salem witch trials.\n\nIt has sometimes been asserted that Glover was an Irish slave (see Irish slaves myth). However, after reviewing the evidence, Liam Hogan has stated that \nwhile this “Irish slave” narrative has been presented to thousands of contemporary readers as historical fact, it was only added to Glover’s story centuries after her death, first as speculation and later as absolute certainty. My research also shows that the tendency towards certainty around the “slavery” aspect of the narrative is apocryphal and primarily based on a pseudo-historical article written by Harold Dijon for \"The Ave Maria\" Catholic magazine in 1905. \n\nwhile contemporary accounts of her trial and death \nnot only upends the “slavery” assertion, but they also clearly show that Glover was scapegoated and murdered by Puritans on a charge of witchcraft because they fanatically believed that she was a witch in league with the devil and not because she was (a) Irish (b) a Catholic or (c) an Irish speaker.\n\n\n\n"}

The \"starting sentence\" is a short custodial sentence, and it is considered a more serious offence than common assault.\n\nThe constable must be acting \"in the execution of his duty\" for this offence to be made out. If he exceeds the remit of his duty (e.g. acts unlawfully in assaulting the Defendant), the offence will not be made out.\n\nThe Defendant does not actually have to be aware that the person he is assaulting is a constable.\n\nThe fact that the victim is a police officer is not, in itself, an aggravating factor which would justify more serious charge. The criteria for a charge under section 47 of the Offences Against the Person Act 1861 do not distinguish between members of the public and police officers as the victim.\n\nAccording to \"R (Fullard) v Woking Magistrates' Court\" (2005) EWHC 2922 (Admin) a constable cannot be acting in the execution of their duty when unlawfully on private property. Thus, if the officer is not acting under the authority of a warrant, acting under a statutory or common law power of entry, or in hot pursuit, the person lawfully in possession of land is entitled to withdraw permission for the officer to remain. Should the officer refuse to leave, the officer will cease to be \"acting in the execution of their duty\". To make an effective withdrawal of permission, clear words must be used. Merely directing offensive remarks at the officer which amount to 'go away' will not necessarily withdraw any implied permission to enter or remain. Further, when properly required to leave, the officer must be allowed a reasonable opportunity to leave. However, once the opportunity to leave voluntarily has passed, it will not be an assault for the land owner to use reasonable force to cause the officer to leave.\n\nFor the purposes of section 89 of the Police Act 1996, any person who is carrying out surveillance in England and Wales under section 76A of the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 is to be treated as if he were acting as a constable in the execution of his duty.\n\nSection 90 of the Police and Fire Reform (Scotland) Act 2012 provides that it is an offence for a person to, amongst other things, assault a constable in the execution of his duty or a person assisting a constable in the execution of his duty.\n\nSection 66(1) of the Police (Northern Ireland) Act 1998 (c.32) now provides that it is an offence for a person to, amongst other things, assault a constable in the execution of his duty, or a person assisting a constable in the execution of his duty.\n\n\nThe offence of 'assault on a constable in the execution of his duty' was formerly created section 7(1)(a) of the Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act (Northern Ireland) 1968.\nIn Hong Kong this can be a summary offence, and also prosecutable under the Police Force Act or the Offences Against the Person Act. \n"}

The discovery was made in 1945 and it is believed that the body had lain undiscovered for 60 years. Inquiries named a strong (but unconfirmed) candidate for the identity of the decedent; however, the cause of death and the reason for their presence in the cylinder remain a mystery.\n\nIn the summer of 1943 American soldiers were clearing a blitzed site at the back of the Methodist Church on Boundary Street East in Liverpool. An American bulldozer uncovered the cylinder while it was clearing building debris. One end of the cylinder was capped with a steel plate and the other was open. The bulldozer moved the cylinder and during the operation it unintentionally crushed the open end. Building contractors then extracted the cylinder from the building rubble and laid it level.\n\nAfter the summer of 1943 the cylinder went largely unnoticed. A local witness, Norman Garner of 278 Great Homer Street, stated that he had seen people use the cylinder as a seat and children often played with it. About two weeks prior to the discovery of the body witnesses saw children rolling the cylinder across from some waste land in Great Homer Street to Claudia Street.\n\nThe cylinder had a length of a diameter of and was made of gauge 9 steel which has a thickness of . The metal cap to the closed end of the cylinder was bolted in place. The open end of the cylinder had been compressed, and almost crimped shut, by the bulldozer leaving an aperture of about . No traces of paint were found inside the cylinder and the opinion in 1945 was that it had been part of a ventilation shaft.\n\nOn 13 July 1945 three small boys were playing with the cylinder. They were rolling it through the streets when one tried to see what was inside. At first they saw what appeared to be a shoe, however, on closer inspection it appeared to be part of an human skeleton. The police were called to the scene and they used an Oxy acetylene burner to cut the cylinder open. The contents were revealed to be a complete human skeleton accompanied by a number of items. The police removed the remains and took them to the mortuary.\n\nThe remains were found to be those of an adult male who would have been about tall in life. It was thought, in 1945, that the man was aged between 25 and 50 at the time of his death. The body appeared to have been in situ for a long time. \n\nThe left base of the skeletons skull was missing. The cranium was broken near to the left middle-ear but this did not appear to be due to violence. The head and torso had become detached at some point through movement. A small amount of hair was found still adhered to the skull.\n\nIt appeared that the man had crawled into the cylinder. The position of the skeleton suggested that the man was lying down and using a brick wrapped in sacking as a pillow when he died. The body was found fully clothed and lying full length on some sacking but not within it. He was dressed in clothes typical of the later Victorian period and they appeared to be of good quality.\n\nNumerous items were found with the body. These items included two diaries, seven keys (heavily corroded), and some miscellaneous papers. No money or other valuables were found in the decedents pockets. The list of items found in the cylinder, as reported in 1945, is as follows:\n\nThe inquest was opened on 19 July 1945 and adjourned for a month by the Liverpool Coroner Mr G C Mort.\n\nThere was no evidence that the man had been killed in the blitz as had been suspected initially. The pathologist noted a large amount of moisture in the cylinder which indicated three possible scenarios. 1. The victim could had been in the unsealed cylinder for about 10 years. 2. The cylinder could have been sealed airtight. 3. There could have been moisture ingress and it had not dried out. The last two scenarios indicated that it was possible that the body had been in the cylinder since 1885 or 1890. Conditions in the cylinder indicated that the body had undergone normal decomposition.\n\nOn 31 August 1945 the coroner closed the inquest by recording an open verdict stating that it was impossible to establish cause of death due to insufficient information. The date of death was believed to have been 1885.\n\nIn August 1945 the inquest named T C Williams, a paint and brush manufacturer of 5 Leeds Street, Liverpool, as a potential identity for the decedent. T C Williams and Co. were a paint, varnish and colour merchants in Tithebarn Street with works in Smithfield Street around 1885. Thomas Cregeen Williams, lived at 29 Cambridge Road in Seaforth, then Woodville House, Abbotsford Road in Blundellsands.\n\nWilliams was declared bankrupt on 10 March 1884. The inquest hypothesised that Williams had left his family home due to financial difficulties and was sleeping in the cylinder at what were assumed to be his business premisses. Somehow the cylinder became sealed and he asphyxiated. It was thought that his disappearance may been interpreted in 1885 as deliberate absconding in order to avoid his creditors as working ones passage on ship to another country was not an unknown method of escaping debt at the time.\n\nAccording to records obtained by the inquiry Williams’s wife was buried alone in Liverpool but no records of the death of Williams or his burial in Liverpool could be found. Indeed, there were no records in England and Wales of a T C Williams being buried. T C Williams had one son born 1859. The inquiry sought relatives of Williams but had no success at the time.\n"}

{"id": "426399", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=426399", "title": "Caul", "text": "Caul\n\nA caul or cowl (, literally, \"helmeted head\") is a piece of membrane that can cover a newborn's head and face. Birth with a caul is rare, occurring in fewer than 1 in 80,000 births. The caul is harmless and is immediately removed by the physician or midwife upon delivery of the child.\n\nThe \"en-caul\" birth, not to be confused with the \"caul\" birth, occurs when the infant is born inside the entire amniotic sac. The sac balloons out at birth, with the amniotic fluid and child remaining inside the unbroken or partially broken membrane.\n\nA child \"born with the caul\" has a portion of a birth membrane remaining on the head. There are two types of caul membranes, and there are four ways such cauls can appear.\n\nThe most common caul type is a piece of the thin, translucent inner lining of the amnion which breaks away and forms tightly against the head during the birthing process. Such a caul typically clings to the head and face, but on rarer occasions drapes over the head and partly down the torso. In Germany, this would be called a \"helmet\" (') for boys; in the Netherlands it is also called a \"helmet\", both for boys and girls (') and in Italy a \"fillet\" (') or \"shirt\" ('). In Poland, it is called a \"bonnet\" (\"\"), for both sexes.\n\nThe caul is harmless and is immediately removed by the physician or midwife upon delivery of the child. If the membrane is of the amniotic tissue, it is removed by easily slipping it away from the child's skin. The removal of the thicker membrane is more complex. If done correctly, the attending practitioner will place a small incision in the membrane across the nostrils so that the child can breathe. The loops are then carefully un-looped from behind the ears. Then, the remainder of the caul can be either peeled back very carefully from the skin, or gently rubbed with a sheet of paper, which is then peeled away. If removed too quickly, the caul can leave wounds on the infant's flesh at the attachment points, which may leave permanent scars.\n\nBirth with a caul is rare, occurring in fewer than 1 in 80,000 births. This statistic includes caul births, which occur more frequently than authentic en-caul births; therefore authentic en-caul births are rarer than the statistic indicates. Most \"en-caul\" births are premature.\n\nAccording to Aelius Lampridius, the boy-emperor Diadumenian (208–218) was so named because he was born with a diadem formed by a rolled caul.\n\nIn medieval times the appearance of a caul on a newborn baby was seen as a sign of good luck. It was considered an omen that the child was destined for greatness. Gathering the caul onto paper was considered an important tradition of childbirth: the midwife would rub a sheet of paper across the baby's head and face, pressing the material of the caul onto the paper. The caul would then be presented to the mother, to be kept as an heirloom. Some Early Modern European traditions linked caul birth to the ability to defend fertility and the harvest against the forces of evil, particularly witches and sorcerers.\n\nFolklore developed suggesting that possession of a baby's caul would give its bearer good luck and protect that person from death by drowning. Cauls were therefore highly prized by sailors. Medieval women often sold these cauls to sailors for large sums of money; a caul was regarded as a valuable talisman.\n\nIn the Polish language, the idiom ' ('born in a bonnet'), and, in Italian, ' ('born with a shirt'), they both mean a person who is always very lucky.\n\nThe Russian phrase (\"rodilsya v rubashke\", literally, \"born in a shirt\") refers to caul birth and figuratively means \"born lucky\". It is often applied to someone who is oblivious to a pending disaster that is avoided only through luck as if the birth caul persists as supernatural armor, and in this sense commonly appears in titles or descriptions of Russian dashcam videos.\n\nNot all cultural beliefs about cauls are positive. In Romanian folklore, babies born with a caul are said to become vampires upon death.\n\nCharles Dickens, \"David Copperfield\", published London 1850:\nI was born with a caul, which was advertised for sale, in the newspapers, at the low price of fifteen guineas. Whether sea-going people were short of money about that time, or were short of faith and preferred cork jackets, I don't know; all I know is, that there was but one solitary bidding, and that was from an attorney connected with the bill-broking business, who offered two pounds in cash, and the balance in sherry, but declined to be guaranteed from drowning on any higher bargain. Consequently the advertisement was withdrawn at a dead loss ... and ten years afterwards, the caul was put up in a raffle down in our part of the country, to fifty members at half-a-crown a head, the winner to spend five shillings. I was present myself, and I remember to have felt quite uncomfortable and confused, at a part of myself being disposed of in that way. The caul was won, I recollect, by an old lady with a hand-basket... It is a fact which will be long remembered as remarkable down there, that she was never drowned, but died triumphantly in bed, at ninety-two. \n\nIn \"The Legend of Thyl Ulenspiegel and Lamme Goedzak\" by Charles De Coster (published 1867), Thyl was born with a caul.\n\nIn Betty Smith's novel \"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn\", Francie Nolan is born with a caul. The midwife who officiated the birth stole the caul and later sold it for $2 to a sailor from the Brooklyn Navy Yard.

Therion,1998), protagonist Annette \"was born with a caul over her face\" (p. 111).

{"id": "149353", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=149353", "title": "Computational biology", "text": "Computational biology\n\nComputational biology involves the development and application of data-analytical and theoretical methods, mathematical modeling and computational simulation techniques to the study of biological, ecological, behavioral, and social systems. The field is broadly defined and includes foundations in biology, applied mathematics, statistics, biochemistry, chemistry, biophysics, molecular biology, genetics, genomics, computer science and evolution.\n\nComputational biology is different from biological computing, which is a subfield of computer science and computer engineering using bioengineering and biology to build computers, but is similar to bioinformatics, which is an interdisciplinary science using computers to store and process biological data.\n\nComputational Biology, which includes many aspects of bioinformatics, is the science of using biological data to develop algorithms or models to understand biological systems and relationships. \nUntil recently, biologists did not have access to very large amounts of data. This data has now become commonplace, particularly in molecular biology and genomics. Researchers were able to develop analytical methods for interpreting biological information, but were unable to share them quickly among colleagues. \nBioinformatics began to develop in the early 1970s. It was considered the science of analyzing informatics processes of various biological systems. At this time, research in artificial intelligence was using network models of the human brain in order to generate new algorithms. This use of biological data to develop other fields pushed biological researchers to revisit the idea of using computers to evaluate and compare large data sets. By 1982, information was being shared among researchers through the use of punch cards. The amount of data being shared began to grow exponentially by the end of the 1980s. This required the development of new computational methods in order to quickly analyze and interpret relevant information.\nSince the late 1990s, computational biology has become an important part of developing emerging technologies for the field of biology.\nThe terms computational biology and evolutionary computation have a similar name, but are not to be confused. Unlike computational biology, evolutionary computation is not concerned with modeling and analyzing biological data. It instead creates algorithms based on the ideas of evolution across species. Sometimes referred to as genetic algorithms, the research of this field can be applied to computational biology. While evolutionary computation is not inherently a part of computational biology, Computational evolutionary biology is a subfield of it.\n\nComputational biology has been used to help sequence the human genome, create accurate models of the human brain, and assist in modeling biological systems.\n\nComputational anatomy is a discipline focusing on the study of anatomical shape and form at the visible or gross anatomical formula_1 \nscale of morphology. It involves the development and application of computational, mathematical and data-analytical methods for modeling and simulation of biological structures. It focuses on the anatomical structures being imaged, rather than the medical imaging devices. Due to the availability of dense 3D measurements via technologies such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computational anatomy has emerged as a subfield of medical imaging and bioengineering for extracting anatomical coordinate systems at the morphome scale in 3D.\n\nThe original formulation of computational anatomy is as a generative model of shape and form from exemplars acted upon via transformations. The diffeomorphism group is used to study different coordinate systems via coordinate transformations as generated via the Lagrangian and Eulerian velocities of flow from one anatomical configuration in formula_2 to another. It relates with shape statistics and morphometrics, with the distinction that diffeomorphisms are used to map coordinate systems, whose study is known as diffeomorphometry.\n\nComputational biomodeling is a field concerned with building computer models of biological systems. Computational biomodeling aims to develop and use visual simulations in order to assess the complexity of biological systems. This is accomplished through the use of specialized algorithms, and visualization software. These models allow for prediction of how systems will react under different environments. This is useful for determining if a system is robust. A robust biological system is one that “maintain their state and functions against external and internal perturbations”, which is essential for a biological system to survive. Computational biomodeling generates a large archive of such data, allowing for analysis from multiple users. While current techniques focus on small biological systems, researchers are working on approaches that will allow for larger networks to be analyzed and modeled. A majority of researchers believe that this will be essential in developing modern medical approaches to creating new drugs and gene therapy.\nA useful modelling approach is to use Petri nets via tools such as esyN \n\nComputational genomics is a field within genomics which studies the genomes of cells and organisms. It is sometimes referred to as Computational and Statistical Genetics and encompasses much of Bioinformatics. The Human Genome Project is one example of computational genomics. This project looks to sequence the entire human genome into a set of data. Once fully implemented, this could allow for doctors to analyze the genome of an individual patient. This opens the possibility of personalized medicine, prescribing treatments based on an individual’s pre-existing genetic patterns. This project has created many similar programs. Researchers are looking to sequence the genomes of animals, plants, bacteria, and all other types of life.\n\nOne of the main ways that genomes are compared is by sequence homology. Homology is the study of biological structures and nucleotide sequences in different organisms that come from a common ancestor. Research suggests that between 80 and 90% of genes in newly sequenced prokaryotic genomes can be identified this way.\n\nThis field is still in development. An untouched project in the development of computational genomics is the analysis of intergenic regions. Studies show that roughly 97% of the human genome consists of these regions. Researchers in computational genomics are working on understanding the functions of non-coding regions of the human genome through the development of computational and statistical methods and via large consortia projects such as ENCODE (The Encyclopedia of DNA Elements) and the Roadmap Epigenomics Project.\n\nComputational neuroscience is the study of brain function in terms of the information processing properties of the structures that make up the nervous system. It is a subset of the field of neuroscience, and looks to analyze brain data to create practical applications. It looks to model the brain in order to examine specific types aspects of the neurological system. Various types of models of the brain include:\nIt is the work of computational neuroscientists to improve the algorithms and data structures currently used to increase the speed of such calculations.\n\nComputational pharmacology (from a computational biology perspective) is “the study of the effects of genomic data to find links between specific genotypes and diseases and then screening drug data”. The pharmaceutical industry requires a shift in methods to analyze drug data. Pharmacologists were able to use Microsoft Excel to compare chemical and genomic data related to the effectiveness of drugs. However, the industry has reached what is referred to as the Excel barricade. This arises from the limited number of cells accessible on a spreadsheet. This development led to the need for computational pharmacology. Scientists and researchers develop computational methods to analyze these massive data sets. This allows for an efficient comparison between the notable data points and allows for more accurate drugs to be developed.\n\nAnalysts project that if major medications fail due to patents, that computational biology will be necessary to replace current drugs on the market. Doctoral students in computational biology are being encouraged to pursue careers in industry rather than take Post-Doctoral positions. This is a direct result of major pharmaceutical companies needing more qualified analysts of the large data sets required for producing new drugs.\n\nComputational biology has assisted the field of evolutionary biology in many capacities. This includes:\n\nCancer computational biology is a field that aims to determine the future mutations in cancer through an algorithmic approach to analyzing data. Research in this field has led to the use of high-throughput measurement. High throughput measurement allows for the gathering of millions of data points using robotics and other sensing devices. This data is collected from DNA, RNA, and other biological structures. Areas of focus include determining the characteristics of tumors, analyzing molecules that are deterministic in causing cancer, and understanding how the human genome relates to the causation of tumors and cancer.\n\nComputational neuropsychiatry is the emerging field that uses mathematical and computer-assisted modeling of brain mechanisms involved in mental disorders. It was already demonstrated by several initiatives that computational modeling is an important contribution to understand neuronal circuits that could generate mental functions and dysfunctions.\n\nComputational Biologists use a wide range of software. These range from command line programs to graphical and web-based programs.\n\nOpen source software provides a platform to develop computational biological methods. Specifically, open source means that every person and/or entity can access and benefit from software developed in research. PLOS cites four main reasons for the use of open source software including:\n\nThere are several large conferences that are concerned with computational biology. Some notable examples are Intelligent Systems for Molecular Biology (ISMB), European Conference on Computational Biology (ECCB) and Research in Computational Molecular Biology (RECOMB).\n\nThere are numerous journals dedicated to computational biology. Some notable examples include Journal of Computational Biology and PLOS Computational Biology. The PLOS computational biology journal is a peer-reviewed journal that has many notable research projects in the field of computational biology. They provide reviews on software, tutorials for open source software, and display information on upcoming computational biology conferences. PLOS Computational Biology is an open access journal. The publication may be openly used provided the author is cited. Recently a new open access journal Computational Molecular Biology was launched.\n\nComputational biology, bioinformatics and mathematical biology are all interdisciplinary approaches to the life sciences that draw from quantitative disciplines such as mathematics and information science. The NIH describes computational/mathematical biology as the use of computational/mathematical approaches to address theoretical and experimental questions in biology and, by contrast, bioinformatics as the application of information science to understand complex life-sciences data.\n\nSpecifically, the NIH defines\n\nWhile each field is distinct, there may be significant overlap at their interface.\n\n"}
{"id": "1234129", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1234129", "title": "Death's Head", "text": "Death's Head\n\nDeath's Head is a fictional character appearing in British comics and American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The character is depicted as a robotic bounty hunter (or rather, as he calls himself, a \"freelance peace-keeping agent\"). The character was created by writer Simon Furman and artist Geoff Senior for the company's Marvel UK imprint. Furman decided to use Death's Head in his Transformers stories, but believed that characters appearing in Transformers \"were prone to be absorbed into that title's catchall copyright\" (allowing Hasbro to contest their ownership) and led to a one-page strip titled \"High Noon Tex\" (which was subsequently published in various Marvel UK titles) being hastily created to establish Marvel's ownership of the character. Furman has stated that he chose the name Death's Head for the character while unaware of the \"Nazi-connotations of the name\", referring to the Waffen-SS Totenkopf Division, whose name translates to \"death's head\".\n\nThe character was later redesigned and relaunched as Death's Head II, acting as one of the flagship characters for Marvel UK's 1990s expansion. This version of Death's Head also inspired two spin-off characters, Death Wreck and Death Metal, each of which starred in its own limited series.\n\nLater, in 2005, fans used a poll on Marvel's website to vote for the character's return. This led to a third version of Death's Head, Death's Head 3.0, created by original Death's Head writer Simon Furman. Simon Furman said in 2011 that the character was still popular because “he'll never change or compromise or grow or repent or agonise like most comic book characters. He's this unchanging, uncompromising rock that other characters bounce off. But you still kind of love him. Weird.”\n\nDeath's Head was originally created as a \"throwaway character\" for use in the UK \"Transformers\" comic, a bounty hunter who would feature in a single story-arc and then, according to writer Simon Furman, would \"be discarded down the line (probably at the end of the first story arc)\".\n\nGeoff Senior then showed Furman the initial character designs, at which point they decided that the character had potential beyond his planned appearance as a \"generic, stock mech-with-an-attitude\". As a result of this, Simon Furman also rewrote the Transformers scripts to change Death's Head's dialogue in line with the revised character concept.\n\nTo avoid Hasbro claiming ownership of the character as a consequence of the \"Transformers\" copyright terms they had agreed with Marvel, Death's Head had to make his debut in another Marvel comic before appearing in \"Transformers\" (this situation had also applied to another Marvel character created for use in \"Transformers\", Circuit Breaker). Accordingly, Furman wrote a single-page strip (\"High Noon Tex\", illustrated by Bryan Hitch) that was published in a number of Marvel UK titles.\n\nAfter the initial \"Transformers\" storylines, the character appeared in \"Doctor Who Magazine\" #135 (Apr. 1988), in a story which saw him reduced from a giant robot to a more human stature, by means of \"one of the Master's Tissue Compression Eliminators.\" He then made a guest appearance in Marvel UK's \"Dragon's Claws\" #5 (Nov. 1988), which led into an ongoing series of his own. The first issue prompted a letter from Stan Lee, praising the character and creative team, but a variety of factors, such as distribution and \"Death's Head\"'s smaller size ('US format') causing it to be obscured by larger comics, meant the comic was cancelled at #10.\n\nAfter the cancellation of the series, Marvel UK published an origin story for the character, \"The Body in Question\", initially serialised in the Marvel UK anthology \"Strip #13-20\", and later collected in a single trade paperback.\n\nDeath's Head returned to the main Marvel Universe in \"S.W.O.R.D.\" #1 (November 2009), written by Kieron Gillen. Gillen has confirmed that the character will feature in the first story arc, spanning issues 1-5. Gillen has said \"if you can't bring back a time-traveling dimension-skipper, who \"can\" you bring back?\" He asked Furman before using the character. It was implied that this was Death's Head \"before\" he meets the Transformers (see Fictional Biography).\n\nDeath's Head appeared in the Panini Comics title \"Marvel Heroes\" #33 (March 2011). He appears in the last frame of \"The Hero Inside\" written by Ferg Handley, with art by John Ross. Death's Head battles The Hulk in part two \"The Brute and the Bounty Hunter,\" written by Simon Furman. with art by Simon Williams.\n\nIn 2013, Death's Head started to show up in \"Marvel NOW!\". He appeared in both Kieron Gillen's \"Iron Man\", as part of the start of \"The Secret Origin of Tony Stark\" and in \"Avenging Spider-Man\" #17. In the latter, he's human-sized and still working for the TVA.\n\nAfter the initial Death's Head stories ceased publication, the character was revamped for inclusion in Marvel UK's next wave of titles, where it became the company's biggest ever exported seller.\n\nThere were plans in 1991 to bring back the original Death's Head, which would have featured the character on trial and facing the death penalty, and flashing back to how he'd got there. Early into production the new editor Paul Neary scrapped it and commissioned \"Death's Head II\" instead: replacing the character with a new version, created by Dan Abnett, Andy Lanning, and Liam Sharp. In an autumn 1992 interview with \"Comic World\", Neary was dismissive about the original character and the aborted : \"I didn't like the pages that had been produced - I didn't think there was much future in Transformers-style robots and I thought we could do an awful lot better.\" He produced some sample sketches of how he wanted the character to look,and Liam Sharp's take gave the project \"a kickstart\". Ironically, the success of Death's Head II meant Neary was ordered to create more titles and the easiest way was to reprint the original series (\"The Incomplete Death's Head\"); editor John Freeman had to talk him into it.\n\nOriginally launched as a four-issue limited series, \"Death's Head II\" then became an ongoing series - and also featured in a number of team-up limited series designed to showcase new Marvel UK characters. One of these was \"Death\", teaming up Death's Head II with newly created \"brothers\", Death Metal and his prototype Death Wreck. The recurring character throughout this was Dr Evelyn Necker, the scientist who creates the Minion series (Death's Head II and his \"brothers\"). Death's Head II became the flagship character for Marvel UK - a costume was even made for promotional appearances and was part of the 1993 Lord Mayor's Show - and there were concerns at Marvel UK in early 1993 that they could be overestimating his popularity and over-exposing the character. When Marvel UK was cancelled, a Death's Head II/Punisher crossover was in production and he was playing a key role in the completed, but never published, \"Loose Cannons\" (released online).\n\nFurman has said he felt Death's Head II \"lost his [DH's] most important aspect; the dark-edged gallows humour. So in and of itself I think it's a very tight, proficient and action-packed comic that really tapped into that early 90s anti-hero vibe. But to me it was never Death's Head. It was another character.” \n\nAside from a cameo in the \"Avengers Forever\" limited series, Death's Head II was not featured in a Marvel comic again until 2009. A planned \"Punisher-Death's Head II\" series never saw the light of day, and Liam Sharp pitched a revival on which Marvel passed.\n\nIn 2008, Abnett and Lanning (collectively referred to as \"DnA\") used Doctor Necker as a member of Project Pegasus, while writing the ongoing \"Nova\" series during that comic's involvement with Marvel's \"Secret Invasion\" storyline. In the story, it was mentioned that Necker was working on a project to develop a cyborg called \"Minion\". DnA said \"This is us just having fun - the Death's Head thread has recently been worked back into the Marvel Universe via \"Planet Hulk\", and we thought we would tie a few loose ends together.\"\n\nWriter Paul Cornell featured Death's Head in a cameo appearance in the final issue of \"Captain Britain and MI13\", appearing alongside a number of other Marvel UK characters who had not appeared for several years. Paul Cornell mentioned in an interview that he wrote the splash page due to #15 being the final issue and had no plans before to use Death's Head \"because the character isn't actually British\".\n\nDavid Leach, then a Marvel UK editor on the Death's Head titles, was greenlit to write a new reboot on Death's Head II in the mid-90s, which would feature only that character and no other ties to the previous title: Leach's title for the series was \"Death's Head Quorum\", and Simon Coleby would be artist. It was part of a wider reboot of Marvel UK, involving four titles. Leach got the job after telling Paul Neary that the character was boring and joking \"we should completely overhaul him, reduce his power, lose the time travel aspect and set it in present day England\", only to find Neary liked the idea.\n\nThe series would have a powerful entity called the Time Keeper, meant to be watching timelines but had started creating hunting tournaments out of boredom, viciously beating DHII, depowering him, and stranding him in 90s Earth: the remaining personalities in Death's Head II's databanks form a quorum and force Death's Head to follow their dictats or they'll shut down his body. Death's Head would join a secret community underneath London, preyed upon by the hunts organised by the Time Keeper, and finally getting revenge on the Time Keeper but deciding to stay in London; the first issue would also end with Death's Head's \"mask\" being broken and showing his \"true human face\" (Leach apparently believed Death's Head II's face was a mask). However, the comic was wound up before more than #1 could be written, and the details are only known because of a November 2010 interview with Leach.\n\nA third version of Death's Head was introduced in 2005, the result of an online poll on the Marvel Comics website. Fans were given the chance to choose between four existing Marvel characters - Death's Head, Woodgod, The Aquarian and Texas Twister. The winning character was to be revamped and would then receive their own storyline in Marvel's \"Amazing Fantasy\" title. Death's Head won, receiving 49% of the vote.\n\nDeath's Head creator Simon Furman stated that he contacted Marvel as soon as he became aware of the poll. \"Amazing Fantasy\" editor Mark Paniccia had already intended to contact Furman to ask him some questions about the character, and their conversation also led to Furman writing the initial \"Death's Head 3.0\" story. The character's look was one of the Reaver cyborgs from the Incredible Hulk storyline \"Planet Hulk\".\n\nThe initial \"Death's Head 3.0\" story also included a number of elements which tied it into previous \"Amazing Fantasy\" stories - Death's Head's sentience and power source comes from AIM's attempts to first capture and then replicate the power that created Captain Universe. Issue #16 revealed the scientist that began the project was Monica Rappaccini, mother of the new Scorpion, on the back of her attempts to capture the Uni-Power in other titles. Varina Goddard is revealed via AIM records to be Monica's granddaughter. Furman says he has \"mixed feelings\" about the story, as he likes it but feels that this isn't Death's Head; “I always thought it strange that poll was to bring back one character and what readers got was another entirely... I'd have much rather done the original.” \n\nWhile the Minion project is mentioned as the reason for Death's Head being given his name, no other ties to the previous Death's Heads were included. However, Simon Furman has stated that he would \"work in a little retroactive back story to create a kind of unified Death's Head-verse\" if the character was revived in the future at some point and it has come out that he had originally intended to imply Death's Head 3.0 was the \"original\" in an early form., which the warlock Lupex would abduct and turn into Death's Head's body. Marvel rejected the idea though. In \"Nova\" #17, Dan Abnett and Andy Lanning did their own version, showing the Minion project was originally based on a Death's Head \"3.0\" cyborg.\n\nIn 2006, Liam Sharp and Bryan Hitch pitched a Death's Head revival mini-series, originally for Marvel's Ultimate line, which was not greenlit. The details of the pitch are unknown, though the design for \"Ultimate Death's Head\" (based mainly on DHII) is available online, as is a poster image marked \"Death's Head reboot pic\" that showed a recoloured Minion marked with the Saint George Cross and holding a tattered English flag. Sharp's comments on the latter were that the revival was \"on the surface a real gung-ho macho nationalistic piece of work - but anybody who knows me would know it wouldn't have stayed that way for long...\".\n\nOn February 12, 2014, Marvel's Marvel Universe imprint released #1 of a new series featuring both the original incarnation of Death's Head, and Death's Head II: 'The long-awaited return of DEATH'S HEAD—one of the biggest hits of the original Marvel UK! Death's Head! Death's Head II! On an adventure together for the first time EVER! What threat could be grave enough to bring these two heroes together from across time? How about the villainous Mys-Tech organization resurfacing with an army?!' Both characters would remain a team at the end of the miniseries, departing to \"discuss the future\".\nDeath's Head makes a appearance in the comic. \n\nDeath's Head's first appearance after \"High Noon Tex\" was in the \"Transformers\", seeing him attempt to claim the bounty that Rodimus Prime had placed on Galvatron's head, travelling back in time to the 1980s in pursuit of his quarry. Realising the error he had made in placing the bounty, Rodimus followed him back, and stopped him from destroying Galvatron, forcibly returning him to the future. Subsequently, Death's Head was contracted by the Decepticons to take out Rodimus Prime, a piece of business that Death's Head considered a pleasure. However, Rodimus outsmarted him, and instead paid him to terminate Cyclonus and Scourge. Over the course of the next year, Death's Head pursued them, eventually confronting them on the Planet of Junk, where they all fell under the mental control of Unicron.\n\nDeath's Head tried to resist the control, but was manipulated into killing Shockwave, only to eventually help Rodimus Prime seal Unicron within the Matrix. Finally, prevented from escaping the scene by the explosions wracking the area, Death's Head forced himself, Cyclonus and Scourge through Unicron's time portal, vowing to kill them \"another time\". However, in the course of the time travel they became separated, and while Cyclonus and Scourge wound up on Cybertron in the past, eventually joining with Scorponok and becoming Targetmasters, Death's Head instead encountered the Time Lord known as the Doctor. As a matter of self-defense, The Doctor shrank him to human size and shot him off through time. He arrived on Earth in the year 8162, leading to an encounter with the future government's troubleshooting team, Dragon's Claws, where he was heavily damaged in an explosion and buried under a collapsing building.\n\nDeath's Head was recovered by the Chain Gang and rebuilt (with a redesigned body) by one of their members, Spratt. In exchange for this rescue, he confronted Dragon's Claws again on the Chain Gang's behalf, defeating and capturing Scavenger. When the Claws came to recover their missing member, Death's Head defeated Dragon - but opted not to kill him, instead walking away and stating that his chronometer was \"a minute slow\" and his contract had therefore expired. The Chain Gang were arrested and Spratt, who had escaped arrest, opted to join Death's Head.\n\nDeath's Head and Spratt then relocated to the Los Angeles Resettlement, where Death's Head once again went into business as a Freelance Peacekeeping Agent. Death's Head was later hired to capture the Doctor and his TARDIS, which led him to being stuck in the present day (where he confronted the \"Fantastic Four\") and then sent by Reed Richards to the year 2020 (where he met the Iron Man of that era and gave him friendly advice on mercenary work). The series was ended abruptly with a cliffhanger at issue 10 due to the closure of Marvel UK's own creative team.\n\nIn 1990, the ongoing storyline was resolved in the Marvel UK \"Death's Head: The Body in Question\" story, which was serialized in the magazine \"Strip\" before being reprinted in the Marvel Graphic Novel format. In this story, Death's Head was becoming worried that he was starting to enjoy killing and was prolonging missions for fun rather than simply doing it for money. In addition, Death's Head's origins were revealed to him for the first time. His mechanoid body had originally been constructed to host the life energy of the techno-mage Lupex, a psychotic who hunted beings for sport and stole their bodies upon killing them. However, a woman named Pyra, who wished to steal Lupex' secrets, ultimately decided to use the mechanoid body against him. She gave it a cold and calculating business-like mind, but before it could be used against Lupex, the body was stolen by an unknown party, enlarged to the size of the Cybertronians, and catapulted through time. Death's Head was used as a pawn by Pyra, who wished to get him to a point where he could kill Lupex, while Lupex had begun to hunt Death's Head with the intention of gaining his body. Driven to his mental limits and nearly killed, he eventually was able to kill Lupex and, refusing to be anything like his \"father\", killed him quickly while declaring he \"kill[s] \"only\" for profit or survival!\".\n\nAround this time, Death's Head's also made a few appearances in some US Marvel comics, most notably the \"Fantastic Four\", (where he was hired by the Time Variance Authority) \"She-Hulk\" (where he resigned from the TVA), and \"Marvel Comics Presents\".\n\nIn the final issue (#12) of \"The Incomplete Death's Head\", the Doctor claims to have been responsible for sending Death's Head to the Transformers Universe. Despite being a manipulative being, especially in his seventh incarnation, it could be that this claim is false. There is nothing else within Death's Head's history to substantiate this claim.\n\nDeath's Head appears in the first five issues of the \"S.W.O.R.D.\" ongoing series, hunting down Abigail Brand's brother. He was given a partial redesign, with his head having some elements from the Minion version, and is his original giant size. He is not using the term \"freelance peacekeeper\" until the Beast suggests it to him and Death's Head notes that he likes it, and he doesn't appear to be a time/dimensional traveler. This seems to indicate this is Death's Head \"before\" he met the Transformers and the human-sized, Bryan Hitch model Death's Head would appear separately in other comics.\n\nIn an \"Iron Man\" run by the same writer, he was hired by the alien race Voldi to face Tony Stark in a gladiator-like trial by combat; afterwards, Stark hired him to help track down the Voldi's killer, Unit 451. (Death's Head asked if he was one of \"those guys who has a code against killing \"except for robots\"? I \"hate\" those krypto-fascists.\") Unfortunately for Stark, 451 had hired the peacekeeper first and he led him into a trap (and returned Stark's fee). He passed up Stark's offer to double 451's fee as \"a mech has to have ethics, yes?\"\n\nWhen Doctor Octopus was masquerading as the Superior Spider-Man, he had to battle Death's Head; the Time Variance Authority had sent the mercenary to kill the Future Foundation. Octavius found a way around this.\n\n\nEventually, after many undocumented adventures, Death's Head was beheaded and his personality \"assimilated\" into the mind of the cyborg Minion. Minion was a cyborg created by Dr. Evelyn Necker, a long-term pet project created after years of research which included the Xandarian Worldmind being temporarily uploaded into the Minion program's gestalt matrix. By the year 2020, she was an employee of AIM and the final Minion (as well as its prototype Death Wreck) was designed to protect the organisation from a psychically predicted threat; it killed and assimilated the minds of multiple targets as preparation for this!\".\n\nDeath's Head's personality overwhelmed Minion's programming before it could take out its final target (Reed Richards of the Fantastic Four), and they became the gestalt lifeform that called itself Death's Head II. Death's Head II was partnered with Tuck, an artificial human from the pseudo-medieval planet of Lionheart, where humans had outlawed advanced technology and waged war against androids and cyborgs. Neo-Nazi black mage Baron Strucker IV would magically combine himself with the original Death's Head's corpse to become the supervillain Charnel, a recurring enemy for Death's Head II and the threat AIM had predicted.\n\nWith other assimilated personalities mingling with that of the \"freelance peacekeeper\", Death's Head changed as a character, becoming a more heroic and far less amoral figure than the original, as well as losing his unique mannerisms. He hopped across time and realities in many adventures, often fighting for the greater good; in one adventure, he volunteered for a heroic sacrifice whereas before he'd have required payment. He encountered many Marvel characters, including the Fantastic Four, X-Men, Spider-Man, the Hulk, and Cable, and crossed over with almost every Marvel UK character who was published at the time.\n\nThe original Death's Head was only ever seen again in flashbacks or within Death's Head II's gestalt mind, as well as the twelve-issue \"The Incomplete Death's Head\" limited series (which reprinted various Death's Head stories from the past with a new framing sequence), in which Death's Head and Death's Head II join forces to defeat a servant of an enemy of the original Death's Head.\n\nDeath's Head appeared briefly in the final issue of the \"Captain Britain and MI13\" ongoing series, as one of the MI13 reserves battling against an army of vampires on the moon. Whereas the other Marvel UK characters reintroduced in the issue were accompanied with captions explaining their long absences from the Marvel Universe (e.g. \"Back from space\"), Death's Head was captioned as \"Just... back!\", and given the line \"Surprise appearance, yes?!\".\n\nIn 2010, Death's Head II was shown as a resident of a possible future in \"Avengers\" #2; this appearance also featured as one of the issue's alternative covers.\n\nIn the \"Days of Future Past\" timeline, Death's Head II was part of Britain's Resistance Coordination Executive. Seen as indestructible, he became a symbol of their resolve until he was murdered in battle.\n\nDeath's Head II's design was created by artist Liam Sharp, and he was primarily scripted by Dan Abnett.\n\nDeath's Head II titles included the four-issue introductory mini-series, a sixteen-issue ongoing series, and \"Death's Head II Gold\", a second mini-series (written by Liam Sharp), that was cancelled after the first issue.\n\nIn issue #54 of the \"What If\" (vol. 2) series, Simon Furman and Geoff Senior wrote and drew a tale showing Death's Head surviving Minion's attack and later killing the cyborg; something Furman has said was \"deeply satisfying and cathartic\". Death's Head rebuilt his injured body into a larger, more heavily armed form; meanwhile the Minion cyborg went on to kill Reed Richards, only to be possessed by Strucker and became Charnel itself. Evelyn Necker had to hire Death's Head to stop this threat.\n\nUsing a time machine, Death's Head went back in time to gather the surviving Fantastic Four and several other superheroes, offering them a shot at avenging Reed by ending Charnel - and then let them all get killed softening up Charnel for him. Using his firepower on Charnel and goading him at not using the full potential of his gestalt mind, he got the cyborg to access these scientific minds - knowing this would allow Reed Richards' mind (still fighting within Charnel) to take control of the cyborg's motor functions, allowing him to kill it. His mission complete, Death's Head thought about the selfless, non-profit nature of heroes: \"I just hope it's not catching, yes?\"\n\nThe third version of Death's Head was introduced in a five-part storyline within the pages of Marvel's anthology series \"Amazing Fantasy\", beginning in #16 (December 2005). Written by Death's Head creator Simon Furman and drawn by James Raiz, the story is set 100 years in the future and does not appear to be directly linked to the previous Death's Head stories.\n\nAdvanced Idea Mechanics are set to make peace with the UN and become a legitimate non-terrorist organisation. Hardliner AIM Senior Scientist Patricia Goddard has decided to stop the peace treaty and force AIM back underground by assassinating the UN Secretary General, using a mysterious alien cyborg in AIM's possession codenamed Death's Head. Powered and given intelligence by an artificial variant on the Uni-Power, the cyborg is sent out into the field with preprogrammed objectives, but the clash between its murderous inclinations and an instinctive desire to help people leave it unsure what side it wants to be on.\n\nThe final panel of the Death's Head 3.0 story concludes with an image of the cyborg with mouth horns, alluding to the original Death's Head. It is mentioned as now operating as a deniable troubleshooter for the GEIST organisation (Global Enforcement/Intelligence Symposium Taskforce), carrying out operations they cannot be officially involved in for political reasons. \n\nThis incarnation of Death's Head went on to appear on Sakaar, during the \"Planet Hulk\" series. Similar models are used by the Hulk as soldiers during the \"World War Hulk\" event and one is used as an AIM courier in the \"MODOK's 11\" limited series by Monica Rappaccini.\n\nIt is shown during Nova's Secret Invasion Issues that the Hulk's Death's Head units have been handed over to Project P.E.G.A.S.U.S. for study by a Dr Necker under her \"Minion\" Project. After Norman Osborn's H.A.M.M.E.R. forces come in to shut the facility down, it is revealed that Dr Necker is an A.I.M. double agent, setting up how Death's Head was in A.I.M. possession during the Death's Head 3.0 miniseries.\n\nMore recently, during the Enigma Force tie-in miniseries of the Incredible Hulks Dark Son arc, it was revealed that this model of Death's Head were built in the Microverse during a war with K'ai thousands of years ago. Sometime after the war some of the warships they were aboard were sucked through the Great Portal of Sakaar, which is said to breach time and space.\n\nIn 2014's \"Revolutionary War\", Death's Head II took a contract from Psycho-Wraith Prime to capture Captain Britain so that he could track where the villain's base was and find out if Mys-Tech were returning (and so he could have the money). When he was himself double-crossed and captured and handed to an earlier Evelyn Necker to be dissected, he sent a failsafe signal to Tuck to hire the earlier Death's Head—this one human-sized, rather than the Transformer-sized version in contemporary settings - and come to his rescue. (\"Hrm. That's me? Bio-organic? Droopy horns? \"No cape?!\" You're right -- I really \"do\" need saving!\") After a brief fight, the two of them tore through an army of Death's Head 3.0's but were defeated and the original Death's Head was captured to be used to create a portal to Hell. Both Death's Heads and Tuck fought against Mephisto's armies, gunning down the demonic Killpower. Afterwards, they departed to discuss the future.\n\nThe \"Death's Head\" one-shot had multiple references to the character's history and fan views: Necker controlled Death's Head II and sicced him on the original as in \"Death's Head II\" #1, only for the original to stab him through the head and remark \"the past always catches up with you, yes?\"; Necker decided on the name \"Minion\" after getting DH2 under control and told him she'd see him again in 2020; and both characters are dismissive of the Death's Head 3.0's sharing their name, remarking \"you can't beat the \"real thing\"\".\n\nIn Iron Man's \"Godkiller\" story arc, an all new, all different Death's Head makes an appearance. It is similar to the original Death's Head in appearance except 30 feet tall.\n\nThere are other characters who have went by the name of Death's Head.\n\nDr. Paxton Page was a scientist who perfected the cobalt bomb. He later went mad and faked his own kidnapping and death so that he could assume the guise of the villain Death's Head. He dressed in a glowing radioactive costume, riding a horse whose flesh was made transparent, and wielding fireballs and scimitars of radioactive cobalt. Page's daughter Karen returned to her parents' home to investigate her father's disappearance, and Daredevil followed her. In the ensuing battle between Daredevil and Death's-Head, Death's-Head spilled a vat of molten cobalt over Daredevil, but realized that Karen was endangered. This brought him back to his senses, and he pushed Daredevil and Karen to safety. He appeared to die in this act of self-sacrifice, when he was coated in the molten cobalt.\n\n\nIn the film \"Planet Hulk\", numerous Death's Heads appear on Sakaar as the Red King's personal military.\n\nPaxton Page appears in the third season of \"Daredevil\", portrayed by Lee Tergesen. This version is Karen's religious father living in Fagan Corners, Vermont. Ever since his wife passed away, Paxton has been running the family diner with Karen and Kevin despite the financial issues. Following Kevin's death and Sheriff Bernie covering it up, Paxton advised Karen to take her leave. During this time, Paxton had the diner closed until further notice. When Karen calls him up following the massacre at the Daily Bulletin, Paxton is relieved that Karen is not among the victims. When she asks if she can come home for a while, Paxton states that now is not the time. Death's Head may or may not be confirmed in season four of Daredevil or not but not certain.\n\nDeath's Head makes a cameo appearance in Strider Hiryu's ending in \"Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3\". He is shown helping Strider and the X-Men in a battle against the Reavers.\n\nA skull that is or looks like Death's Head makes a small cameo in \"Guardians of the Galaxy: Mission Breakout\".\n\nDeath's Head was added to the superhero-featuring board game Heroclix in 2013, after winning a fan poll in 2012.\n\nDeath's Head was released as an action figure as part of the Marvel Infinite Series in 2014, and Death's Head II made his Marvel Legends debut in the Guardians of the Galaxy Mantis Build a Figure wave released in 2017 to coincide with the release of the second Guardians film.\n\nVarious Death's Head comics have been collected into a number of trade paperbacks and other reprints:\n\n\n"}

The cause of this posture—sometimes called a \"death pose\"—has been a matter of scientific debate. Traditional explanations ranged from strong ligaments in the animal's neck desiccating and contracting to draw the body into the pose, to water currents randomly arranging the remains in the position. \n\nFaux and Padian suggested in 2007 that the live animal was suffering opisthotonus during its death throes, and that the pose is not the result of any post-mortem process at all. They also reject the idea of water as responsible for randomly arranging the bodies in a \"death pose\", as different parts of the body and the limbs can be in different directions, which they found unlikely to be the result of moving water. They also found that the claim that drying out of ligaments would make the position does not seem believable either. \n\nAlicia Cutler and colleagues from Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah, think it is related to water. In 2012, paleontologists Achim G. Reisdorf and Michael Wuttke published a study regarding death poses. According to the conclusions of this study, the so-called \"opisthotonic posture\" is not the result of a cerebral illness creating muscle spasms, and also not of a rapid burial. Rather, peri-mortem submersion resulted in buoyancy that enabled the Ligamentum elasticum to pull the head and tail back. \n\n"}

Fearing for the boy's life, a zoo worker shot and killed Harambe. The incident was recorded on video and received broad international coverage and commentary, including controversy over the choice to kill Harambe. A number of primatologists and conservationists wrote later that the zoo had no other choice under the circumstances, and that it highlighted the danger of zoo animals in close proximity to humans and the need for better standards of care.\n\nHarambe ( ) was born at the Gladys Porter Zoo in Brownsville, Texas, on May 27, 1999. He was named by Dan Van Coppenolle, a local area counselor who won a naming contest sponsored by the zoo. He came up with the name after listening to the song \"Harambe (Working Together for Freedom)\" by Rita Marley, widow of Bob Marley. \"Harambee\" is a Swahili term for communal labor.\n\nOn September 18, 2014, Harambe was transferred to the Cincinnati Zoo and Botanical Garden to learn adult gorilla behavior and join a new social group.\n\nOn May 28, 2016, a three-year-old boy visiting the Cincinnati Zoo fell into the moat at the Gorilla World habitat. Witnesses said they heard the child say he wanted to go into the gorilla enclosure. The boy then climbed a fence, crawled through of bushes, and then fell into a moat of shallow water. Zoo officials immediately signaled for the three gorillas in the habitat to return inside, and two females did so. However, the third gorilla, the inquisitive 440 pound male silverback, Harambe, climbed down into the moat to investigate the child splashing in the water.\n\nOver the next 10 minutes, Harambe became increasingly \"agitated and disoriented\" by the screams of onlookers. He dragged the child through the water, occasionally propping him up when he sat, or pushing him down when he stood. Harambe exhibited \"strutting\" behavior—walking around with legs and arms stiffly extended to appear bigger—a bluffing move, though one with inherent danger should he throw or drag the boy around too roughly. Harambe then carried the boy up a ladder out of the moat onto dry land. Afraid for the boy's life, zoo officials made the decision to kill the gorilla, doing so with a single rifle shot. Cincinnati firefighters said the boy was between Harambe's legs when the shot was fired. Harambe was killed one day after his 17th birthday.\n\nThe incident was recorded in a dramatic video by an anonymous bystander and uploaded to YouTube, where it went viral, sparking global publicity and controversy. Some observers said that it was unclear whether Harambe was likely to harm the child. Others called for the boy's parents or the zoo to be held accountable for the gorilla's death. Director Thane Maynard stated, \"The child was being dragged around ... His head was banging on concrete. This was not a gentle thing. The child was at risk.\" Police investigated possible criminal charges against the parents, while the parents defended the zoo's actions. The boy's mother also became the target of harassment on the Internet and social media. On June 6, 2016, Ohio prosecutor Joe Deters said that the mother would not face any charges of wrongdoing. The zoo was investigated by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA), which sets the standards for zoos, and the USDA.\n\nSeveral vigils took place to honor Harambe's death. As many as 3,400 people attended a candlelight vigil at Hyde Park, London. Anthony Seta, an animal rights activist, spoke at a vigil at Cincinnati Zoo, saying, \"I'm not here to decide what was right and what was wrong, the fact is that a gorilla who just celebrated his birthday has been killed.\"\n\nThe incident received criticism from several high-profile celebrities, including Ricky Gervais, Brian May, and Piers Morgan.\n\nThe incident sparked debate among biologists and primatologists on whether gorillas and other primates should be held in captivity at all. Primatologist Jane Goodall said that according to the video it seemed Harambe was trying to protect the child. Goodall later issued a longer explanation in an interview with the president of the International Fund for Animal Welfare, concluding that the zoo had no choice but to kill Harambe. She wrote, \"It was awful for the child, the parents, Harambe, the zoo, the keepers and the public. But when people come into contact with wild animals, life and death decisions sometimes have to be made.\" Goodall said that as long as humans and wild animals are kept in close proximity in zoos, there is no way to prevent accidents from happening, but she believed that zoos \"with the highest standards of care\" could play an important role. Zookeeper Jack Hanna strongly defended the zoo's actions as the \"correct decision\", noting that a tranquilizer dart might have taken five or ten minutes to take effect and could have aggravated Harambe further. Primatologist Frans de Waal said he saw few options for the zoo: \"A gorilla is so immensely strong that even with the best of intentions—and we are not sure that Harambe had those—the child's death was a probable outcome.\"\n\nFollowing the killing, Harambe became subject of multiple viral memes. Vox wrote in November that Harambe has an \"undeniable status as 2016's meme of the year.\" As \"People\" magazine wrote: \"Harambe continues to live on in the collective mind of the internet, entering into a rarefied state of venerated meme status.\" One of the most widespread memes was noted by \"The Washington Post\" and \"New York\" magazine who observed a proliferation of over-the-top and fake tributes to Harambe. \"The idea is, the more intense and more sincere-seeming the expression of mourning is, the funnier the joke.\" For example, the \"Dicks out for Harambe\" meme can be seen as a fake tribute to an incident that would normally engender sincere mourning. As Aja Romano of \"Vox\" wrote, \"If you were a progressive, the Harambe meme gave you a chance to mock what you viewed as the hypocritical haranguing of the mainstream while avoiding real issues of social justice; and if you were a conservative, the Harambe meme gave you a chance to mock liberal hysteria.\" One meme is a play on conspiracy theories, such as \"Bush did Harambe\", a reference to the 9/11 conspiracy theories. In Australia, people joked about supporting Harambe's corpse as a write-in candidate on the ballot for the federal election. Public Policy Polling included Harambe in their polling for the U.S. presidential election. The dead gorilla had 5% support in late July 2016 (ahead of Green Party nominee Jill Stein) and 2% in August 2016 (tied with Stein).\nCincinnati Zoo director Thane Maynard reacted negatively: \"We are not amused by the memes, petitions and signs about Harambe. Our zoo family is still healing, and the constant mention of Harambe makes moving forward more difficult for us. We are honoring Harambe by redoubling our gorilla conservation efforts and encouraging others to join us.\" In late August, the zoo deleted its Twitter account after being daily targeted by trolls mentioning Harambe. However, after two months, the zoo had resumed its account.\n\nA self-described underground culture collective known as \"Otaku Gang\" released a computer parody fighting game known as \"Harambe vs. Capcom\", with Harambe being able to fight characters from Capcom's \"Street Fighter\" franchise. The game itself is a fullgame of \"M.U.G.E.N\", a customizable fighting game.\n\nAmerican rappers Young Thug and Dumbfoundead each released songs entitled \"Harambe\". The former did so on his album \"Jeffery\", each track of which is named after one of his \"idols\", although the song does not reference the gorilla; the latter likens the fate of the ape to gang violence and police brutality. Canadian dubstep producer Excision included a song titled \"Harambe\" on his 2016 album \"Virus\".\n\nOn naming contests for newborn baby gorillas, a teenager made a petition to Dublin Zoo to name a newborn baby gorilla as \"Harambe Jr.\" (\"Harambetta\" if female) after Dublin Zoo announced the newborn baby gorilla by tweet.\n\nOn June 16, 2017, satire news site \"The Onion\" featured an article of professional wrestler The Big Show being killed by WWE after a seven-year-old boy wandered into a steel cage during a live event in Indianapolis.\n\nIn September 2017, the zoo added Mshindi, a 29-year-old male western lowland gorilla transferred from the Louisville Zoo. He joined females Chewie, 21, and Mara, 22, who were present the day of the killing. At the same time, the zoo created a new indoor habitat where the gorillas could safely view the public year-round from behind safety glass.\n\n\n"}

Megaguirus was first mentioned in the movie \"Godzilla vs. Megaguirus\" after a swarm of Meganulon absorbed energy from Godzilla and quickly fled to a flooded section of Tokyo. After diving into the flood waters, the entire swarm latched on to an enormous, mutated version of Meganulon. This mutated creature, regarded as the queen, begins to molt once enough energy had been obtained. After leaving behind her exoskeleton, Megaguirus rose above the water's surface and entered the skies of Tokyo.\n\nImmediately after getting above water, Megaguirus began her rampage across Tokyo, destroying numerous buildings by creating supersonic shock waves with her wings. The Japanese military, already deployed to the city to assist in evacuating residents caught in the flood, was helpless to stop Megaguirus. In addition to being practically immune to bullets, her wings emitted a piercing buzz which forced people to stop what they were doing and cover their ears in pain. Before leaving the city, the creature leveled a skyscraper and caused a chain reaction of explosions in several other buildings near where she was born. Several days later, Megaguirus returned to Tokyo in pursuit of Godzilla.\n\nMoments before Megaguirus's second arrival in Tokyo, the G-Graspers, a legion of anti-Godzilla soldiers in the Japan Self Defense Unit, attempts to take down Godzilla \"once and for all.\" However, Megaguirus interrupts this and begins a lengthy duel with Godzilla. Initially, Megaguirus takes Godzilla by surprise, using her speed to avoid Godzilla's attacks, including his atomic breath, as well as knock him over multiple times. Eventually, Megaguirus grabs onto Godzilla's neck with her vice-like claws. Although Godzilla breaks free of the grasp and begins to charge up his atomic breath, Megaguirus jabs Godzilla with her stinger and begins absorbing energy, preventing Godzilla from using his atomic breath while giving more power to Megaguirus.\n\nMegaguirus uses her newly obtained energy to pick Godzilla up and throw him into a building. Once Godzilla recovers, Megaguirus again stabs him with her stinger, but this time, Godzilla grabs Megaguirus's tail and slams it into the ground and follows through by tackling her. Shortly thereafter, Megaguirus uses the absorbed energy to launch an \"atomic blast\" which causes Godzilla to collapse. Seemingly having defeated Godzilla, Megaguirus goes in for the kill, but just as she makes her move, Godzilla quickly gets up and bites off Megaguirus's stinger. Stunned, Megaguirus floats backwards from Godzilla, only to be set aflame by his atomic breath. To ensure his victory, Godzilla hits Megaguirus again, causing her to explode into a ball of fire before the burning remains fell to the ground and exploded for a final time.\n\nSimilar to nearly every monster in the Godzilla series, Megaguirus was at one point exposed to radioactive materials, resulting in a substantial increase in strength, speed and size. After obtaining energy from the minor Meganulon, Megaguirus is able to fly at incredibly fast speeds, up to mach 4. It is able to flap its dragonfly-like wings at super-sonic speeds, creating shock waves that can destroy buildings. Its enlarged tail works similar to the stinger of a scorpion, it jabs its foe and latches on to it. Once the stinger is in Megaguirus's opponent, it can either absorb energy for itself or release a blast of energy composed of its opponent's beam weapon. Additionally, while flying, its wings cause electronic disturbances.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1580265", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1580265", "title": "Mike Wieringo", "text": "Mike Wieringo\n\nMichael Lance \"Mike\" Wieringo (June 24, 1963\n– August 12, 2007), who sometimes signed his work under the name Ringo, was an American comics artist best known for his work on DC Comics' \"The Flash\" and Marvel Comics' \"Fantastic Four\". In 2017, the Ringo Award was created and it was named after Wieringo to honor people in the comic book industry; it is presented at the Baltimore Comic-Con.\n\nMike Wieringo became interested in comics through his father, who was an avid reader. Wieringo began drawing comics when he was 11. He studied fashion illustration at Virginia Commonwealth University, though he began to consider drawing comics as a profession, and showed his artwork at comics convention during his college years. Soon after graduating, he determined that that field was \"dying out\". Realizing that he did not possess the fortitude for commercial illustration, he decided to draw comic books.\n\nWieringo's first professionally published work was \"Doc Savage: Doom Dynasty #1\", published by Millennium Publications in 1991. Editor Mark Ellis had to overrule his partner to give the fledgling artist his first assignment.\n\nWieringo took his samples to the 1992 San Diego Comic Con, where he met DC Comics group editor of creative services Neil Pozner, who showed Wieringo's art to other DC editors. He was eventually given his first work, a story in \"Justice League Quarterly\" #11. That was followed by a second \"JLQ\" in issue #12.\n\n\"The Flash\" editor Brian Augustyn asked Wieringo to try out for \"The Flash\". After submitting some sample pages of the Flash running, Wieringo was offered the penciling duties on Volume 2 of that series, on which he was paired with writer Mark Waid, and on which he rose to prominence in the industry, drawing all but two issues from #80–92 (Early Sept. 1993–July 1994), plus #0 (Oct. 1994). He additionally penciled covers through #100, #118–124, and 128–129, and for \"The Flash 80-Page Giant\" #2 (April 1999). Wieringo and Waid co-created the young speedster Bart Allen, a.k.a. Impulse, in \"The Flash\" vol. 2 #91 (cameo) and #92 (first full appearance).\n\nWieringo followed this with a short run on \"Robin\", another DC title, with writer Chuck Dixon, while concurrently penciling Marvel Comics' \"Rogue\" #1–4 (Jan.–April 1995), a miniseries starring that X-Men superheroine. During this period, he also penciled occasional covers and small miscellaneous jobs for Marvel Comics.\n\nOther work around this time included penciling the cover and co-penciling (with Rob Haynes) the lead story of \"Firearm\" #0 (Nov. 1993) and penciling the back cover and one story in \"Godwheel\" #2 (Feb. 1995) for Malibu Comics. He penciled the cover of \"Explorers\" #2 (1995) for Explorer Press.\n\nAfter having penciled the \"Spider-Boy\" #1 (April 1996) one-shot, which combined Spider-Man and Superboy as part of the Marvel Comics–DC Comics intercompany crossover series of one-shots Amalgam Comics, Wieringo became the regular artist on Marvel's \"The Sensational Spider-Man\", beginning with issue #8 (September 1996). Teaming with writer Todd Dezago, Wieringo penciled all but eight issues from #8–31 (September 1996 – October 1998), and some covers on issues he did not pencil. Additionally, Wieringo co-plotted several issues and penciled the quirkily numbered flashback issue, # −1 (July 1997). During his run he signed a two–year contract with Marvel, beginning December 1997.\n\nAfter \"Spider-Man\", Wieringo's next major project was at Image Comics, where he reteamed with Dezago on their creator-owned fantasy series \"Tellos\". The comic, a coming-of-age adventure set in a magical, piratical world, ran 10 issues (May 1999–November 2000). The last three issues were released by Gorilla Comics, a short-lived Image imprint co-founded by Wieringo and several other creators in 2000. Following the demise of the series, Wieringo also penciled one 13–page story in a post-series one-shot, \"Tellos: Maiden Voyage\" #1 (March 2001).\n\nWieringo returned to DC Comics for all but one issue of \"The Adventures of Superman\" #592–600 (July 2001 – March 2002), with writer Joe Casey. He then returned to Marvel and reunited with writer Mark Waid on \"Fantastic Four\". Beginning with #60 (October 2002), Wieringo eventually drew 27 issues of Waid's 36 issues, wrapping up their run with #524, by which time the previously relaunched series had returned to its original numbering. The comics-hobbyist webzine Newsarama commented that the Waid–Wieringo run \"was perhaps best known for fan outcry when Marvel announced that [it was] going to replace the team. Marvel quickly reversed [its] decision, and the two completed their run on the series\".\n\nWieringo penciled the interior art on issues #1–5 and #8–10 of \"Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man\" and was the cover artist of #1–19 (December 2005 – June 2007). He and writer Jeff Parker began work on the miniseries \"Spider-Man and the Fantastic Four\" in April 2007.\n\nWieringo explained the philosophy behind his drawing style thus: \"I just try to keep things fun. I like to do fun comics. It doesn't have to be realistic to be believable. In fact, I sometimes think that funny [material] might actually add something to certain books.\" When he began illustrating the \"Rogue\" miniseries, he was intimidated by the dark tone of that book's story, but once he finished the first issue, the editors decided to light up the \"grim and gritty\" tone of the story.\n\nOn August 12, 2007, Wieringo died of an aortic dissection at his home in Durham, North Carolina, at age 44. He was survived by his parents, Cecil and Shirley Dean Wieringo, and his brother Matt.\n\nMirage Comics' \"Tales Of TMNT\" #40, Image Comics' \"Elephantmen\" #11 and \"The Walking Dead\" #42, and Marvel Comics' \"Spider-Man: Family\" #7 were dedicated to his memory.\n\nAt the time of his death, Wieringo had completed seven pages of a \"What If?\" story featuring the temporary \"replacement\" Fantastic Four of Spider-Man, Wolverine, Hulk, and Ghost Rider that had originally been assembled in a 1990 three-part \"Fantastic Four\" storyline. Marvel Comics donated the script and Wieringo's art to The Hero Initiative, a charity dedicated to assisting Golden Age and Silver Age comics creators who retired without pensions or benefits and require financial assistance. Wieringo's colleagues stepped in to complete the story. The completed 48-page book, \"What If?—The Fantastic Four Tribute to Mike Wieringo\", features, in addition to Wieringo's art, artwork by Arthur Adams, Paul Renaud, Stuart Immonen, Cully Hamner, Alan Davis, David Williams, Sanford Greene, Humberto Ramos, Skottie Young, Mike Allred, and Barry Kitson, and was released in June 2008.\n\nIn June 2017, the Baltimore Comic-Con announced the creation of the Mike Wieringo Comic Book Industry Awards (the \"Ringo Awards\"), to be held annually at Baltimore Comic-Con beginning in September 2017.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "9427109", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9427109", "title": "Mozambique tilapia", "text": "Mozambique tilapia\n\nThe Mozambique tilapia (\"Oreochromis mossambicus\") is a tilapiine cichlid fish native to southern Africa. It is a popular fish for aquaculture. Dull colored, the Mozambique tilapia often lives up to a decade in its native habitats. Due to human introductions, it is now found in many tropical and subtropical habitats around the globe, where it can become an invasive species because of its robust nature. These same features make it a good species for aquaculture because it readily adapts to new situations. It is known as black tilapia in Colombia and as blue kurper in South Africa.\n\nThe native Mozambique tilapia is laterally compressed, and has a deep body with long dorsal fins, the front part of which have spines. Native coloration is a dull greenish or yellowish, and weak banding may be seen. Adults reach approximately in length and up to . Size and coloration may vary in captive and naturalized populations due to environmental and breeding pressures. It lives up to 11 years.\n\nIt is a remarkably robust and fecund fish, readily adapting to available food sources and breeding under suboptimal conditions. It also tolerates brackish water and survives temperatures below and above , but sustained water temperatures of 55°F are lethal to Mozambique tilapia.\n\nThe Mozambique tilapia is native to coastal regions and the lower reaches of rivers in southern Africa, from the Zambezi River delta to Bushman River in the eastern Cape. It is threatened in its home range by competition with the invasive Nile tilapia.\n\nMozambique tilapia are omnivorous. They can consume detrital material, diatoms, invertebrates, small fry and vegetation ranging from macroalgae to rooted plants. This broad diet helps the species thrive in diverse locations.\n\nThe Mozambique tilapia is an invasive species in many parts of the world, having escaped from aquaculture or been deliberately introduced to control mosquitoes. It has been nominated by the Invasive Species Specialist Group as one of the 100 worst invasive species in the world. It can harm native fish populations through competition for food and nesting space, as well as by directly consuming small fish. In Hawaii, striped mullet \"Mugil cephalus\" are threatened because of the introduction of this species. Mozambique tilapia may also be responsible for the decline of the desert pupfish, \"Cyprinodon macularius\", in California's Salton Sea.\n\nAs with most species of tilapia, Mozambique tilapia have a high potential for hybridization. They are often crossbred with other tilapia species in aquaculture because purebred Mozambique tilapia grow slowly and have a body shape poorly suited to cutting large fillets. Also, hybrids between certain parent combinations (such as between Mozambique and Wami tilapia) result in offspring that are all or predominantly male. Male tilapia are preferred in aquaculture as they grow faster and have a more uniform adult size than females. The \"Florida Red\" tilapia is a popular commercial hybrid of Mozambique and blue tilapia.\n\nAlthough Mozambique tilapias generally live in rivers and lagoons, they can also colonize fast-flowing areas of water such as creeks and streams. Due to their robust nature, Mozambique tilapias often over-colonize the habitat around them, eventually becoming the most abundant species in a particular area. When over-crowding happens and resources get scarce, adults will sometimes cannibalize the young for more nutrients. Mozambique tilapia, like other fish such as Nile tilapia and trout, are opportunistic omnivores and will feed on algae, plant matter, organic particles, small invertebrates and other fish. Feeding patterns vary depending on which food source is the most abundant and the most accessible at the time. In captivity, Mozambique tilapias have been known to learn how to feed themselves using demand feeders. During commercial feeding, the fish may energetically jump out of the water for food.\n\nMozambique tilapias often travel in groups where a strict dominance hierarchy is maintained. Positions within the hierarchy correlate with territoriality, courtship rate, nest size, aggression, and hormone production. In terms of social structure, Mozambique tilapias engage in a system known as lek-breeding, where males establish territories with dominance hierarchies while females travel between them. Social hierarchies typically develop because of competition for limited resources including food, territories, or mates. During the breeding season, males cluster around certain territory, forming a dense aggregation in shallow water. This aggregation forms the basis of the lek through which the females preferentially choose their mates. Reproductive success by males within the lek is highly correlated to social status and dominance. \nIn experiments with captive tilapias, evidence demonstrates the formation of linear hierarchies where the alpha male participates in significantly more agonistic interactions. Thus, males that are higher ranked initiate much more aggressive acts than subordinate males. However, contrary to popular belief, Mozambique tilapias display more agonistic interactions towards fish that are farther apart in the hierarchy scale than they do towards individuals closer in rank. One hypothesis behind this action rests with the fact that aggressive actions are costly. In this context, members of this social system tend to avoid confrontations with neighboring ranks in order to conserve resources rather than engage in an unclear and risky fight. Instead, dominant individuals seek to bully subordinate tilapias both for an easy fight and to keep their rank.\n\nUrine in Mozambique tilapias, like many freshwater fish species, acts as a vector for communication amongst individuals. Hormones and pheromones released with urine by the fish often affect the behavior and physiology of the opposite sex. Dominant males signal females through the use of a urinary odorant. Further studies have suggested that females respond to the ratio of chemicals within the urine, as opposed to the odor itself. Nevertheless, females are known to be able to distinguish between hierarchical rank and dominant vs. subordinate males through chemicals in urine.\n\nUrinary pheromones also play a part in male – male interaction for Mozambique tilapias. Studies have shown that male aggression is highly correlated with increased urination. Symmetrical aggression between males resulted in an increase in the release of urination frequency. Dominant males both store and release more potent urine during agonistic interactions. Thus, both the initial stage of lek formation and the maintenance of social hierarchy may highly depend on the males’ varying urinary output.\n\nAggression amongst males usually involve a typical sequence of visual, acoustic, and tactile signals that eventually escalates to physical confrontation if no resolution is reached. Usually, conflict ends before physical aggression as fights are both costly and risky. Bodily damage may impede an individual’s ability to find a mate in the future. In order to prevent cheating, in which individual may fake his own fitness, these aggressive rituals incur significant energetic costs. Thus, cheating is prevented by the sheer fact that the costs of initiating a ritual often outweigh the benefits of cheating. In this regard, differences between individuals in endurance plays a critical role in resolving the winner and the loser.\n\nIn the first step in the reproductive cycle for Mozambique tilapia, males excavate a nest into which a female can lay her eggs. After the eggs are laid, the male fertilizes them. Then the female stores the eggs in her mouth until the fry hatch; this act is called mouthbrooding. One of the main reasons behind the aggressive actions of Mozambique tilapias is access to reproductive mates. The designation of Mozambique tilapias as an invasive species rests on their life-history traits: Tilapias exhibit high levels of parental care as well as the capacity to spawn multiple broods through an extended reproductive season, both contributing to their success in varying environments. In the lek system, males congregate and display themselves to attract females for matings. Thus, mating success is highly skewed towards dominant males, who tend to be larger, more aggressive, and more effective at defending territories. Dominant males also build larger nests for the spawn. During courtship rituals, acoustic communication is widely used by the males to attract females. Studies have shown that females are attracted to dominant males who produce lower peak frequencies as well as higher pulse rates. At the end of mating, males guard the nest while females take both the eggs and the sperm into their mouth. Due to this, Mozambique tilapias can occupy many niches during spawning since the young can be transported in the mouth. These proficient reproductive strategies may be the cause behind their invasive tendencies.\n\nMale Mozambique tilapias synchronize breeding behavior in terms of courtship activity and territoriality in order to take advantage of female spawning synchrony. One of the costs associated with this synchronization is the increase in competition among males, which are already high on the dominance hierarchy. As a result, different mating tactics have evolved in these species. Males may mimic females and sneak reproduction attempts when the dominant male is occupied. Likewise, another strategy for males is to exist as a floater, travelling between territories in an attempt to find a mate. Nevertheless, it is the dominant males who have the greatest reproductive advantage.\n\nTypically, Mozambique tilapias, like all species belonging to the \"Oreochromis\" genus and species like \"Astatotilapia burtoni\", are maternal mouthbrooders, meaning that spawn is incubated and raised in the mouth of the mother. Parental care is, therefore, almost exclusive to the female. Males do contribute by providing nests for the spawn before incubation, but the energy costs associated with nest production is low relative to mouthbrooding. Compared to nonmouthbrooders, both mouthbrooding and growing a new clutch of eggs is not energetically feasible. Thus, Mozambique tilapias arrest oocyte growth during mouthbrooding to conserve energy. Even with oocyte arrest, females that mouthbrood take significant costs in body weight, energy, and low fitness. Hence, parental-offspring conflict is visible through the costs and benefits to the parents and the young. A mother caring for her offspring carries the cost of reducing her own individual fitness. Unlike most fish, Mozambique tilapias exhibit an extended maternal care period believed to allow social bonds to be formed.\n\nMozambique tilapia are hardy individuals that are easy to raise and harvest, making them a good aquacultural species. They have a mild, white flesh that is appealing to consumers. This species constitutes about 4% of the total tilapia aquaculture production worldwide, but is more commonly hybridized with other tilapia species. Tilapia are very susceptible to diseases such as whirling disease and ich. Mozambique tilapia are resistant to wide varieties of water quality issues and pollution levels. Because of these abilities they have been used as bioassay organisms to generate metal toxicity data for risk assessments of local freshwater species in South Africa rivers.\n\nThe species is known by a number of other names including:\n\n\n\n"}

Most deck-building articles suggest a limit of 2-3 species for the Basic Neopets, along with a minimum of 20 Item and/or Equipment cards (essentially half of the deck). Each card may have only 3 copies included. Players start with a single Neopet on the first turn, moving up to three by the third turn. These Neopets compete against opposing Neopets in four different arenas: Strength, Agility, Intelligence, and Magic. Winning a competition during a player's own turn allows the player to bank or draw a card; banking enough cards of sufficient value eventually leads to victory.\n\nThe various Neopets cards are divided into categories that affect gameplay in different ways. The different card types are as follows:\n\n\nThe Basic Neopet cards are the foundation of the game, and are based upon fictional Neopets taken from the Neopets website, including the species and color of the Neopet. The cards list four abilities or attributes, which are: strength, agility, intelligence, and magic. Each of these is given a value, with a higher number denoting a greater power or skill in a given category. Basic Neopets never have a printed score higher than 10, or lower than 1.\n\nThe Experienced Neopet is much like an evolved Pokémon in the \"Pokémon Trading Card Game\". An Experienced Neopet has higher attributes, and often has helpful side effects that influence various part of the game. The Experienced Neopet cards consists of a Neopet species, and an adjective describing that Neopet's advanced occupation, e.g. Jubjub Engineer. However, only Neopets of the matching base species can transform into the Experienced Neopet role, so, for example, only a Jubjub could turn into a Jubjub Engineer, while a Mynci could not.\n\nItem and Equipment cards both increase a Neopet's abilities, by adding points onto the printed base number in one or more categories, and frequently have certain side effects that affect game play. Whereas Items can only be used once before being discarded, Equipment is attached to the Neopet and remains there until removed by another card. The advantage to Items is that can be sprung upon an opponent unexpectedly.\n\nItem and Equipment cards are also the only cards worth points, ranging from 0 to 8. A player needs to \"bank\" 21 points worth of Items and Equipment cards to win the game.\n\nVillain cards and Hero cards both have extremely high ability numbers, and are designed to oppose one another. If a villain is played, the arena in which the villain is located is effectively sealed off until the villain is confronted and beaten, until which point the players cannot start contests against their opponent in that arena, only the villain. A Hero card can be used to fight a difficult battle (often against a villain), but can be used only once before being discarded.\n\nSomething Has Happened! cards usually cause a one-time, instantaneous event or effect to occur. These cards often are used to influence the outcome of a battle, and are then discarded. Because one can discover that \"Something has Happened!\" at virtually any time, such cards can introduce a heavy element of surprise.\n\nLocation cards can be played in one area to affect all future battles taking place there (until replaced by another Location). The Location can give an advantage to a certain kind of Neopet, or can cause some side effect to any battles occurring there. Location cards are typically based upon fantasy locations on the Neopets website.\n\nFate cards are divided into two sub-categories: Curse and Quest. Curses are usually played on a Neopet belonging to the opponent, and have a negative or detrimental effect on that Neopet. Because Curse cards typically remain in play, they can cripple a given Neopet's ability to perform effectively. Quest cards affect all parts of the game, and are (usually) neutral.\n\nConstellation cards represent star constellations in the sky which impact play in some way. For example, a given Constellation might confer an additional power to the Neopets in play, or otherwise might change the game in some fashion. Wizards of the Coast has not given any official ruling as to the rules regarding constellations, but popular rule sets online (most notably in player-created \"guilds\" on the Neopets web site) considered them similar to Magic's enchantments.\n\nThe \"Neopets Trading Card Game\" has seen a series of expansions, with each release including new cards and in many cases, new categories of cards. Only three Neopets species did not make it into the TCG, as produced by Wizards of the Coast: Gnorbu, Ogrin, and Xweetok. Checklists can be accessed if you have a Neopets user account.\n\nThe first \"Neopets\" card set was simply an introductory 234-card set, with no prevailing theme whatsoever. This set introduced the card types Basic Neopet, Experienced Neopet, Hero, Villain, Item, Equipment, and \"Something Has Happened!\". The Basic Neopet types that were introduced were Aishas, Korbats, Myncis, Scorchios, Shoyrus, Kacheeks, Acaras, Lupes, Wockies, Poogles, Eyries, and Grarrls.\n\nThis expansion's release was coordinated with an online plot/war, which was set in the virtual feudal-themed land of Meridell. Thus, the 140 cards in this set were designed with a Middle Ages-like style. This expansion introduced ten new species of Neopets, (Basic Type: Blumaroo, Draik, Gelert, Ixi, Meerca, Quiggle, Skeith, Uni, Usul, and Zafara) in addition to the Location card type.\n\nIntending to be tied into an online plot, this set was released in 2004 & the online tie-in was delayed until early 2008 due to workload. This set totaled 100 cards. This expansion's theme was space, providing players with futuristic and robotic items and equipment. Six new Neopet species made their debut in this expansion. (Basic Type: Cybunny, Grundo, Jetsam, Jubjub, and Kougra)\n\nBased upon a tropical island locale, this 100-card expansion provided no new card types, but did introduce four new Neopet species, including the Pteri and Techo. (other Basic Type: Krawk and Peophin) The related plot was the Secret of the Volcano mystery plot in Fall 2003, but the plot and the expansion were not released together.\n\nRevolving around a central popular game character known as Hannah the Usul, a substantial plot was released on the Neopets website along with this 150-card set; it was also the first set to have \"secret\" cards (5 Jelly cards 151/150-Jelly Poogle, 152/150-Jelly Shoyru, 153/150-Jelly World, 154/150-Jelly Puppyblew, and 155/150-Orange Jelly). The locale for this expansion, released in October 2004, was a wintry, icy environment. A game is also based upon the plot of this expansion of the same name, and is currently online at the Neopets website. This expansion introduced the Basic Neopets known as the Bori, and the Bruce. (other Basic Type: Elephante, Flotsam, Kyrii, and Moehog) One new card type was released: Fates.\n\nThis 120-card expansion revolved around the underwater city of Maraqua, which was rebuilt during the plot of the same name on the Neopets website. Four new Neopet species were released with this set, including the Yurble. (other Basic Type: Chomby, Lenny, and Tuskaninny)\n\nThis 100-card expansion took players to the shifting sands of the Lost Desert. Basic Neopets released in this expansion are the Ruki, the Kau, and the Tonu. Site-wise, there was a plot and war revolving around this expansion.\n\nThis 150-card expansion (with 5 secret cards)featured several cards relating to the PlayStation 2 game, including several familiar characters from previous sets. The most notable of these were the Darkest Faerie, the Dark Faerie Sisters, and the Werelupe King. This expansion also introduced another new type of card, the Constellation. (Basic Type: Buzz, Koi, Nimmo) Oddly, this expansion was absent of any Fates.\n\nSecret cards: 151- Amulet fo Thilg, 152- Bewitched Ring, 153- Fyora, Tower Guardian, 154- The Hidden Tower, 155- Wand of Ultanova,\n\nThis \"Neopets\" card \"expansion\" is actually a re-packaging of 200 cards from previous card sets. This includes favorite cards, as well as Neopets from each and every known Neopet species; 3 exceptions from the list of 54- Gnorbu, Ogrin, and Xweetok. (introduced Basic Type: Hissi, Kiko, and Lutari) Only one color for each Basic species was included. The general theme of this set is about encouraging fans to re-live past plots, or, for those new to \"Neopets\", catch them up with some of the more well known aspects of the series. There was barely any publicity at all related to this expansion.\n\nThe newest expansion, featuring 100 cards with a spooky theme. Cards are related to ghosts, werewolves, and zombies, among others. This deck is associated with the plot, Tale of Woe; where a village has fallen under a curse, and only the Neopets can determine what happened to the townsfolk. There are no new Basic Type cards, although they did fill out the basic 4 colors for the Lenny and Tonu. Special color versions are included for Acara, Aisha, Cybunny, and Korbat. As with previous recent releases, this release appears to be being done with a minimum of publicity. This is the last expansion produced by Wizards of the Coast.\n\nA game was created to tie in with the TCG, the game was named \"Hubrid's Hero Heist\". It features several Neopian heroes being captured by Hubrid Nox and the player, as the Poogle Apprentice, is to save these heroes. The heroes which the player saves are, in order of saving, Magnus the Torch, Jeran, Master Vex, Illusen, Jerdana, and finally, Fyora the Faerie Queen.\n\n"}

{"id": "2686634", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2686634", "title": "Polyphenism", "text": "Polyphenism\n\nA polyphenic trait is a trait for which multiple, discrete phenotypes can arise from a single genotype as a result of differing environmental conditions. It is therefore a special case of phenotypic plasticity.\n\nThere are several types of polyphenism in animals, from having sex determined by the environment to the castes of honey bees and other social insects. Some polyphenisms are seasonal, as in some butterflies which have different patterns during the year, and some Arctic animals like the snowshoe hare and Arctic fox, which are white in winter. Other animals have predator-induced or resource polyphenisms, allowing them to exploit variations in their environment. Some nematode worms can develop either into adults or into resting dauer larvae according to resource availability.\n\nA polyphenism is a biological mechanism that causes a trait to be polyphenic. For example, crocodiles possess a sex-determining polyphenism, and therefore their gender is a polyphenic trait.\n\nWhen polyphenic forms exist at the same time in the same panmictic (interbreeding) population they can be compared to genetic polymorphism. With polyphenism the switch between morphs is environmental, but with genetic polymorphism the determination of morph is genetic. These two cases have in common that more than one morph is part of the population at any one time. This is rather different from cases where one morph predictably follows another during, for instance, the course of a year. In essence the latter is normal ontogeny where young forms can and do have different forms, colours and habits to adults.\n\nThe discrete nature of polyphenic traits differentiates them from traits like weight and height, which are also dependent on environmental conditions but vary continuously across a spectrum. When a polyphenism is present, an environmental cue causes the organism to develop along a separate pathway, resulting in distinct morphologies; thus, the response to the environmental cue is “all or nothing.” The nature of these environmental conditions varies greatly, and includes seasonal cues like temperature and moisture, pheromonal cues, kairomonal cues (signals released from one species that can be recognized by another), and nutritional cues.\n\nSex-determining polyphenisms allow a species to benefit from sexual reproduction while permitting an unequal gender ratio. This can be beneficial to a species because a large female-to-male ratio maximizes reproductive capacity. However, temperature-dependent sex determination (as seen in crocodiles) limits the range in which a species can exist, and makes the species susceptible to endangerment by changes in weather pattern. Temperature-dependent sex determination has been proposed as an explanation for the extinction of the dinosaurs.\n\nPopulation-dependent and reversible sex determination, found in animals such as the blue wrasse fish, have less potential for failure. In the blue wrasse, only one male is found in a given territory: larvae within the territory develop into females, and adult males will not enter the same territory. If a male dies, one of the females in his territory becomes male, replacing him. While this system ensures that there will always be a mating couple when two animals of the same species are present, it could potentially decrease genetic variance in a population, for example if the females remain in a single male's territory.\n\nThe caste system of insects enables eusociality, the division of labor between non-breeding and breeding individuals. A series of polyphenisms determines whether larvae develop into queens, workers, and, in some cases soldiers. In the case of the ant, \"P. morrisi\", an embryo must develop under certain temperature and photoperiod conditions in order to become a reproductively-active queen. This allows for control of the mating season but, like sex determination, limits the spread of the species into certain climates.\nIn bees, royal jelly provided by worker bees causes a developing larva to become a queen. Royal jelly is only produced when the queen is aging or has died. This system is less subject to influence by environmental conditions, yet prevents unnecessary production of queens.\n\nPolyphenic pigmentation is adaptive for insect species that undergo multiple mating seasons each year. Different pigmentation patterns provide appropriate camouflage throughout the seasons, as well as alter heat retention as temperatures change. Because insects cease growth and development after eclosion, their pigment pattern is invariable in adulthood: thus, a polyphenic pigment adaptation would be less valuable for species whose adult form survives longer than one year.\n\nBirds and mammals are capable of continued physiological changes in adulthood, and some display reversible seasonal polyphenisms, such as in the Arctic fox, which becomes all white in winter as snow camouflage.\n\nPredator-induced polyphenisms allow the species to develop in a more reproductively-successful way in a predator's absence, but to otherwise assume a more defensible morphology. However, this can fail if the predator evolves to stop producing the kairomone to which the prey responds. For example, the fly larvae that feed on \"Daphnia cucullata\" (a water flea) release a kairomone that \"Daphnia\" can detect. When the fly larvae are present, \"Daphnia\" grow large helmets that protect them from being eaten. However, when the predator is absent, \"Daphnia\" have smaller heads and are therefore more agile swimmers.\n\nOrganisms with resource polyphenisms show alternative phenotypes that allow differential use of food or other resources. One example is the western spadefoot toad, which maximizes its reproductive capacity in temporary desert ponds. While the water is at a safe level, the tadpoles develop slowly on a diet of other opportunistic pond inhabitants. However, when the water level is low and desiccation is imminent, the tadpoles develop a morphology (wide mouth, strong jaw) that permits them to cannibalize. Cannibalistic tadpoles receive better nutrition and thus metamorphose more quickly, avoiding death as the pond dries up.\n\nAmong invertebrates, the nematode \"Pristionchus pacificus\" has one morph that primarily feeds on bacteria and a second morph that produces large teeth, enabling it to feed on other nematodes, including competitors for bacterial food. In this species, cues of starvation and crowding by other nematodes, as sensed by pheromones, trigger a hormonal signal that ultimately activates a developmental switch gene that specifies formation of the predatory morph.\n\nDensity-dependent polyphenism allows species to show a different phenotype based on the population density in which it was reared. In Lepidoptera, African armyworm larvae exhibit one of two appearances: the gregarious or solitary phase. Under crowded or \"gregarious\" conditions, the larvae have black bodies and yellow stripes along their bodies. However, under solitary conditions, they have green bodies with a brown stripe down their backs. The different phenotypes emerge during the third instar and remain until the last instar.\n\nUnder conditions of stress such as crowding and high temperature, L2 larvae of some free living nematodes such as \"Caenorhabditis elegans\" can switch development to the so-called dauer larva state, instead of going the normal molts into a reproductive adult. These dauer larvae are a stress-resistant, non-feeding, long-lived stage, enabling the animals to survive harsh conditions. On return to favorable conditions, the animal resumes reproductive development from L3 stage onwards.\n\nA mechanism has been proposed for the evolutionary development of polyphenisms:\n\n\nEvolution of novel polyphenisms through this mechanism has been demonstrated in the laboratory. Suzuki and Nijhout used an existing mutation (\"black\") in a monophenic green hornworm (\"Manduca sexta\") that causes a black phenotype. They found that if larvae from an existing population of \"black\" mutants were raised at 20˚C, then all the final instar larvae were black; but if the larvae were instead raised at 28˚C, the final instar larvae ranged in color from black to green. By selecting for larvae that were black if raised at 20˚C but green if raised at 28˚C, they produced a polyphenic strain after thirteen generations.\n\nThis fits the model described above because a new mutation (black) was required to reveal pre-existing genetic variation and to permit selection. Furthermore, the production of a polyphenic strain was only possible because of background variation within the species: two alleles, one temperature-sensitive and one stable, were present for a single gene upstream of \"black\" (in the pigment production pathway) before selection occurred. The temperature-sensitive allele was not observable because at high temperatures, it caused an increase in green pigment in hornworms that were already bright green. However, introduction of the black mutant caused the temperature-dependent changes in pigment production to become obvious. The researchers could then select for larvae with the temperature-sensitive allele, resulting in a polyphenism.\n\n\n"}

Asimov himself declared his coined word to be \"uneuphonious\" (not pleasant to the ear), and defined it as being a portmanteau of the two words \"space home\". \n\nAsimov described how energy flows through a life-support system from a low entropic state from which it moves all material resources, such as air, water, and food with the rejection of low-grade heat as the final energy output. The concept reflects the dynamics of ecosystem ecology as described by Howard T. Odum.\n\nThe term applies to any life-support system from submarines to spaceships, and includes the operation of the Earth's own biosphere.\n\nThe word \"spome\" was also referenced in a reprint of Asimov's original article in \"Is anyone there?\", 1967 by Doubleday, Ash.

{"id": "12395051", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12395051", "title": "The World Without Us", "text": "The World Without Us\n\nThe World Without Us is a non-fiction book about what would happen to the natural and built environment if humans suddenly disappeared, written by American journalist Alan Weisman and published by St. Martin's Thomas Dunne Books. It is a book-length expansion of Weisman's own February 2005 \"Discover\" article \"Earth Without People\". Written largely as a thought experiment, it outlines, for example, how cities and houses would deteriorate, how long man-made artifacts would last, and how remaining lifeforms would evolve. Weisman concludes that residential neighborhoods would become forests within 500 years, and that radioactive waste, bronze statues, plastics, and Mount Rushmore would be among the longest-lasting evidence of human presence on Earth.\n\nThe author of four previous books and numerous articles for magazines, Weisman traveled to interview academics, scientists and other authorities. He used quotations from these interviews to explain the effects of the natural environment and to substantiate predictions. The book has been translated and published in many countries. It was successful in the U.S., reaching #6 on the \"New York Times\" Best Seller list and #1 on the \"San Francisco Chronicle\" Best-Sellers list in September 2007. It ranked #1 on \"Time\" and \"Entertainment Weekly's\" of 2007.\n\nThe idea of exploring the effects of the depopulating of the Earth is an old one, having been a regular trope in science fiction novels for decades. Post-apocalyptic literature in general had often tried to imagine the fate of civilization and its artifacts after the end of humanity. Indeed, an extremely popular 1949 novel, \"Earth Abides,\" portrayed the breakdown of urban systems and structures after a pandemic, through the eyes of a survivor, who muses at the end of the first chapter: \"What would happen to the world and its creatures without man? That he was left to see.\"\n\n\"The World Without Us\" applies a more ecological view to \"Earth Abides\". Before writing it, the author, Alan Weisman, had written four books, including, \"Gaviotas: A Village to Reinvent the World,\" in 1998, about the eco-village of Gaviotas in Colombia; and \"An Echo In My Blood,\" in 1999, about his family's history immigrating from Ukraine to the United States. He has worked as an international journalist for American magazines and newspapers, and at the time of writing the book was an Associate Professor of Journalism and Latin American Studies at the University of Arizona. The position required him to teach only one class in the spring semester, and he was free to travel and conduct research the rest of the year.\n\nThe idea for \"The World Without Us\" was suggested to Weisman in 2004 by Josie Glausiusz, an editor at \"Discover\". She had pondered the idea for several years and asked Weisman to write a feature on the subject after she re-read \"Journey through a Doomed Land\", an article he published in 1994 in \"Harper's Magazine\" about the state of Chernobyl eight years after abandonment. His \"Discover\" article, \"Earth Without People\", published in the February 2005 issue and re-printed in \"The Best American Science Writing 2006\" anthology, describes how nature has thrived in the abandoned Korean Demilitarized Zone and how nature would overwhelm the built environment of New York City. Using interviews with paleoecologists, the article speculates that megafauna would return and that forest cover, like the Białowieża Forest, would spread over Europe and the eastern United States. The article raises the prospect of failing power plants, chemical plants, dams, and petroleum tanks.\n\nTo expand this into a book, Weisman's agent found an editor and publisher at St. Martin's Press. Among the 23-page bibliography are two articles he wrote for the Los Angeles Times Magazine (\"Naked Planet\" on persistent organic pollutants, and \"The Real Indiana Jones\" on the Mayan civilization) and one published in the \"Condé Nast Traveler\" (\"Diamond in the Wild\" on diamond mining), as well as \"Discover\"'s \"Earth Without People\". Additional research saw Weisman travel to England, Cyprus, Turkey, Panama, and Kenya. Interviews with academics quoted in the book include biologist E. O. Wilson on the Korean Demilitarized Zone, archaeologist William Rathje on plastics in garbage, forest botanist Oliver Rackham on vegetative cover across Britain, anthropologist Arthur Demarest on the crash of Mayan civilization, paleobiologist Douglas Erwin on evolution, and philosopher Nick Bostrom on Transhumanism.\n\nThe book is divided into 27 chapters, with a prelude, coda, bibliography and index. Each chapter deals with a new topic, such as the potential fates of plastics, petroleum infrastructure, nuclear facilities, and artworks. It is written from the point of view of a science journalist with explanations and testimonies backing his predictions. There is no unifying narrative, cohesive single-chapter overview, or thesis.\n\nWeisman's thought experiment pursues two themes: how nature would react to the disappearance of humans and what legacy humans would leave behind. To foresee how other life could continue without humans, Weisman reports from areas where the natural environment exists with little human intervention, like the Białowieża Forest, the Kingman Reef, and the Palmyra Atoll. He interviews biologist E. O. Wilson and visits with members of the Korean Federation for Environmental Movement at the Korean Demilitarized Zone where few humans have penetrated since 1953. He tries to conceive how life may evolve by describing the past evolution of pre-historic plants and animals, but notes Douglas Erwin's warning that \"we can't predict what the world will be 5 million years later by looking at the survivors\". Several chapters are dedicated to megafauna, which Weisman predicts would proliferate. He profiles soil samples from the past 200 years and extrapolates concentrations of heavy metals and foreign substances into a future without industrial inputs. Carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere and implications for climatic change are likewise examined.\n\nWith material from previous articles, Weisman uses the fate of the Mayan civilization to illustrate the possibility of an entrenched society vanishing and how the natural environment quickly conceals evidence. To demonstrate how vegetation could compromise human built infrastructure, Weisman interviewed hydrologists and employees at the Panama Canal, where constant maintenance is required to keep the jungle vegetation and silt away from the dams. To illustrate abandoned cities succumbing to nature, Weisman reports from Chernobyl, Ukraine (abandoned in 1986) and Varosha, Cyprus (abandoned in 1974). Weisman finds that their structures crumble as weather does unrepaired damage and other life forms create new habitats. In Turkey, Weisman contrasts the construction practices of the rapidly growing Istanbul, as typical for large cities in less developed countries, with the underground cities in Cappadocia. Due to a large demand for housing in Istanbul much of it was developed quickly with whatever material was available and could collapse in a major earthquake or other natural disaster. Cappadocian underground cities were built thousands of years ago out of volcanic tuff, and are likely to survive for centuries to come.\n\nWeisman uses New York City as a model to outline how an unmaintained urban area would deconstruct. He explains that sewers would clog, underground streams would flood subway corridors, and soils under roads would erode and cave in. From interviews with members of the Wildlife Conservation Society and the New York Botanical Gardens Weisman predicts that native vegetation would return, spreading from parks and out-surviving invasive species. Without humans to provide food and warmth, rats and cockroaches would die off.\n\nWeisman explains that a common house would begin to fall apart as water eventually leaks into the roof around the flashings, erodes the wood and rusts the nails, leading to sagging walls and eventual collapse. After 500 years, all that would be left would be aluminum dishwasher parts, stainless steel cookware, and plastic handles. The longest-lasting evidence on Earth of a human presence would be radioactive materials, ceramics, bronze statues, and Mount Rushmore. In space, the Pioneer plaques, the Voyager Golden Record, and radio waves would outlast the Earth itself.\n\nBreaking from the theme of the natural environment after humans, Weisman considers what could lead to the sudden, complete demise of humans without serious damage to the built and natural environment. That scenario, he concludes, is extremely unlikely. He also considers transhumanism, the Voluntary Human Extinction Movement, the Church of Euthanasia and John A. Leslie's \"The End of the World: the Science and Ethics of Human Extinction\". Weisman concludes the book considering a new version of the one-child policy. While he admits it is a \"draconian measure\", he states, \"The bottom line is that any species that overstretches its resource base suffers a population crash. Limiting our reproduction would be damn hard, but limiting our consumptive instincts may be even harder.\" He responded to criticism of this saying \"I knew in advance that I would touch some people's sensitive spots by bringing up the population issue, but I did so because it's been missing too long from the discussion of how we must deal with the situation our economic and demographic growth have driven us too (sic)\".\n\nThe book was first published on July 10, 2007, as a hardback in the United States by St. Martin's Thomas Dunne Books, in United Kingdom by Virgin Books and in Canada by HarperCollins. The paperback was released in July 2008. It has been translated and published in Denmark by Borgen as \"Verden uden os\", France by Groupe Flammarion as \"Homo disparitus\", in Germany by Piper as \"Die Welt ohne uns\", in Portugal by Estrela Polar as \"O Mundo Sem Nós\", in Italy by Einaudi as \"Il mondo senza di noi\", in Poland by CKA as \"Świat bez nas\", and in Japan by Hayakawa Publishing as \"Jinrui ga kieta sekai\" (人類が消えた世界 ; \"A World where the Human Race has Disappeared\").\n\nPete Garceau designed the cover art for the American release, which one critic said was \"a thick layer of sugar-coated sweetness in an effort to not alarm potential readers. 'Yes, I am a book about the environment. But I'm harmless! No, really!' \" The Canadian version, designed by Ellen Cipriano, is similar to the American version but with a photo illustration rather than the disarming cartoon illustration. Cover art for the international releases contrast the natural environment with a decaying built environment. Adam Grupper voiced the ten-hour-long, unabridged English language audiobook which was published by Macmillan Audio and BBC Audiobooks, and released simultaneously with the hardcover book. AudioFile gave the audio presentation its Earphones Award, called Grupper's reading sincere and balanced, and wrote, \"Never veering into sensationalism, always objective and phlegmatic, Grupper takes what could be a depressing topic and makes it a book you just can't stop listening to\".\n\nAs the book was released Weisman launched his book tour with stops throughout the United States, Canada and overseas to Lisbon and Brussels. Weisman did television interviews on \"The Daily Show\" and \"The Today Show\" and radio interviews on \"Weekend Edition\", \"Talk of the Nation\", \"The Diane Rehm Show\", \"Living on Earth\", \"Marketplace\", and \"As It Happens\". Meanwhile, the book debuted on the New York Times Best Seller list for non-fiction hardcovers at #10 on July 29 and spent nine weeks in the top ten, peaking at #6 on August 12 and September 9. In the Canadian market, it spent 10 weeks on \"The Globe and Mail\"'s non-fiction best seller list, peaking at #3 on August 11. The book reached #1 on the \"San Francisco Chronicle\" Best-Sellers list for non-fiction on September 23 and spent 11 weeks on the \"USA Today\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s Top 150 Best-Selling Books, peaking at #48. Reviewers at the Library Journal recommended the book for all environmental collections and the audiobook for most public and academic library audiobook collections. The book ranked #1 on \"Time\" and \"Entertainment Weekly's\" top of 2007 and was listed in the Hudson Booksellers' \"Best Books published in 2007\". In the Amazon.com \"Best Books of 2007\", it placed #4 overall in the United States and #1 in the non-fiction category in Canada.\n\nThe writing style was positively received as being vivid and well-written, sometimes grim, but with appropriate language. Even an overall negative review by Michael Grunwald in \"The Washington Post\" remarked the writing was \"always lucid, sometimes elegant\". In \"The New York Times Book Review\" Jennifer Schuessler said Weisman has a \"flirtation with religious language, his occasionally portentous impassivity giving way to the familiar rhetoric of eco-hellfire\". Janet Maslin of \"The New York Times\" found the writing had \"an arid, plain, what-if style\" while being \"strangely uniform in tone\". On the reporting techniques, Kamiya wrote that \"[Weisman's] science reporting, at once lucid and full of wonder ... is the heart and soul of this book\" and that it is \"written as if by a compassionate and curious observer on another planet\". \"The Plain Dealer\" book editor Karen Long said Weisman \"uses the precise, unhurried language of a good science writer and shows a knack for unearthing unexpected sources and provocative facts\".\n\nSeveral critics found the lack of an anthropomorphic point of view hurt the book's relevance. Robert Braile in \"The Boston Globe\" wrote that it has \"no real context ... no rationale for probing this fantasy other than [Weisman's] unsubstantiated premise that people find it fascinating\". Michael Grunwald in \"The Washington Post\" also questioned the premise: \"Imagining the human footprint on a post-human planet might be fun for dormitory potheads who have already settled the questions of God's existence and Fergie's hotness, but it's not clear why the rest of us need this level of documentary evidence\". On the other hand, Alanna Mitchell in the \"Globe and Mail\" review found relevance in the context of society's passiveness to resource depletion combined with an anthropomorphic vanity. She writes the \"book [is] designed to help us find the how of survival by shaking us out of our passive dance with death\".\n\nThe book's environmental focus was also criticized by some. Christopher Orlet of \"The American Spectator\" wrote that it is \"a prime example of the wrongheaded, extremist views of the Greens\". Braile agrees that the book could be \"an environmentalist's nightmare, possibly fueling the cheap shots taken at the green movement ... by critics who say environmentalists care more about nature than people\". Environmentalist Alex Steffen found the book presents nothing new, but that using the sudden and clean disappearance of humans provides a unique framework, although extremely unlikely and insensitive. Two critics who call the book a \"Jeremiad\" ultimately gave it a positive review. \"The Guardian\" says \"we learn during the course of this book, to feel good about the disappearance of humanity from the Earth\".\n\nOther critics hailed the environmental perspective. Chauncey Mabe of the \"South Florida Sun-Sentinel\" calls the book \"one of the most satisfying environmental books of recent memory, one devoid of self-righteousness, alarmism or tiresome doomsaying\". Tom Spears of the CanWest News Service concludes \"it's more a portrait of ourselves, taken through an odd lens\" and \"[s]ometimes an obituary is the best biography\".\n\nThe book is categorized as non-fiction science but some commentators emphasize it may be better described as speculative fiction. \"The World Without Us\" is grounded in environmental and science journalism. Like other environmental books, it discusses the impact that the human race has had on the planet. Weisman's thought experiment removes the judgments and sufferings of humans by focusing on a hypothetical post-human world. This approach to the genre, which \"throw[s] the spotlight on the earth itself\", was found to be creative and objective. There have been other books that address similar topics, such as Gregory Benford's 1999 book \"Deep Time: How Humanity Communicates Across Millennia\". Science fiction writers such as H. G. Wells (\"The War of the Worlds\", 1898) and John Wyndham (\"The Day of the Triffids\", 1951) had earlier touched upon the possible fate of cities and other man-made structures after the sudden removal of their creators. Similar parallels in the decay of civilization are detailed in 1949 post-apocalyptic science fiction novel by Berkeley English professor George R. Stewart, \"Earth Abides.\"\n\nAddressing his approach, Weisman said that eliminating the human element eliminated the \"fear factor\" that people are doing something wrong or that they will die; it is meant to be read as a fantasy, according to the author. Josie Appleton of \"Spiked\" related the book to \"today's romanticisation of nature\" in that it linked \"the decadence and detachment of a modern consumerist society\" with an ignorance of the efforts required to produce products so easily disposed. Appleton also felt the book countered the \"Nature knows best\" notion by highlighting the randomness of natural forces.\n\nWeisman's science journalism style uses interviews with academic and professional authorities to substantiate conclusions, while maintaining the \"cool and dispassionate [tone]...of a scientific observer rather than an activist\". Weisman said he purposely avoided the activist label: \"Some of our finest science and nature writers only get read by people who already agree with them. It's nice to get some affirmation for whatever it is you believe is true, even if it's quite sobering, but I wanted to write something that people would read ... without minimizing the significance of what's going on, nor trivializing it, nor oversimplifying it.\" Richard Fortey compares the book to the works of Jared Diamond, Tim Flannery and E.O. Wilson, and writes that \"The World Without Us\" \"narrowly avoids engendering the gloom-and-doom ennui that tends to engulf the poor reader after reading a catalogue of human rapacity\". Mark Lynas in the \"New Statesman\" noted that \"whereas most environmental books sag under the weight of their accumulated bad news, \"The World Without Us\" seems refreshingly positive\". Demonstrating the optimism on the grim subject matter Appleton quotes an ecologist from the book saying \"if the planet can recover from the Permian, it can recover from the human\".\n\n\nThere have been several TV specials relating to the same topic:\n\nThe 2009 hip-hop song \"The High Line\" by Kinetics & One Love, inspired by \"The World Without Us\", is a pro-green, anti-deforestation song that paints the picture of trees and plants reclaiming the buildings of New York City long after the presence of humans. Like author Alan Weisman, rapper Kinetics uses the High Line railway in Manhattan as an example of nature’s potential for reclamation of manmade structures.\n\nThe 2013 video game \"The Last of Us\", which takes place twenty years after an apocalyptic event, uses \"The World Without Us\" as inspiration for the look of the city settings.\n\nIn 2009 20th Century Fox purchased the rights to the book with the intent of creating a motion picture.\n"}
{"id": "1207231", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1207231", "title": "Vaughn Bodē", "text": "Vaughn Bodē\n\nVaughn Bodē (; July 22, 1941 – July 18, 1975) was an American underground cartoonist and illustrator known for his character Cheech Wizard and his artwork depicting voluptuous women. A contemporary of Ralph Bakshi, Bodē has been credited as an influence on Bakshi's animated films \"Wizards\" and \"The Lord of the Rings\". Bodē has a huge following among graffiti artists, with his characters remaining a popular subject.\n\nBodē was inducted into the Will Eisner Award Hall of Fame for comics artists in 2006.\n\nIn 1963, at age 21, and while living in Utica, New York, Bodē self-published \"Das Kämpf\", considered one of the first underground comic books. Created after Bodē's stint in the U.S. Army, \"Das Kampf\" has been called \"a war-themed spoof on Charles Schulz's 1962 book \"Happiness is a Warm Puppy\".\" With money borrowed from his brother Vincent, Bodē photocopied about 100 copies of the 52-page book and (mostly unsuccessfully) attempted to sell it around the Utica area.\n\nIn the mid 1960s Bodē was living in Syracuse, New York, attending classes at Syracuse University and contributing to \"The Sword of Damocles\", a student-run, though not university-sanctioned, humor magazine similar to \"The Harvard Lampoon\". It was here that Bodē's most famous comic creation, Cheech Wizard, first saw publication. Cheech Wizard (sometimes characterized as a \"cartoon messiah\") is a wizard whose large yellow hat (decorated with black and red stars) covers his entire body except his legs and his big red feet. Cheech Wizard is constantly in search of a good party, cold beer, and attractive women. Usually depicted without arms, it is never actually revealed what Cheech Wizard looks like under the hat, or exactly what kind of creature he is, although in the episode entitled \"The Unmasking of Cheech Wizard\", when he \"doffs the hat\", it is evident that underneath was a low-rent Oz man all along (in an interview, reference is made to the frontal lump in the hat caused by crossed arms). Characters pressing the issue generally are rewarded with a swift kick to the groin by Cheech. After an initial run in \"The Sword of Damocles\", the strip continued for a few more years in \"The Daily Orange\", the student-written newspaper at Syracuse University.\n\nIn 1968, Bodē illustrated the cover & interior art for R. A. Lafferty's science fiction novel \"Space Chantey\", published by Ace Double. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, he illustrated covers and interior art for the science fiction digests \"Amazing Stories\", \"Fantastic\", \"Galaxy Science Fiction\", \"Witzend\" and \"Worlds of If\".\n\nDiscovered by fellow cartoonist Trina Robbins, Bodē moved to Manhattan in 1969 and joined the staff of the underground newspaper the \"East Village Other\". It was here that Bodē met Spain Rodriguez, Robert Crumb and other founders of the quickly expanding underground comics world. At the \"East Village Other\", he helped found \"Gothic Blimp Works\", an underground comics supplement to the magazine, which ran for eight issues, the first two edited by Bodē.\n\nBodē's post-apocalyptic science fiction action series \"Cobalt 60\" featured an antihero wandering a devastated post-nuclear land, seeking to avenge the murder of his parents. \"Cobalt-60\" debuted as a ten-page black-and-white story in the science fiction fanzine \"Shangri L'Affaires\" (a.k.a. \"Shaggy\") #73, published in 1968. Bodē won the 1969 Hugo Award for Best Fanzine Artist largely on the strength of \"Cobalt 60\", but he never did anything else with the character. (\"Cobalt-60\" was later \"completed\" in the early 1980s by Bodē's's son Mark Bodé, with stories by Larry Todd, who was Vaughn's friend and collaborator in the 1960s on projects for \"Eerie\", \"Creepy\", and \"Vampirella\" magazines.)\n\nBeginning in 1968 and continuing until his untimely death, Bodē entered a prolific period of creativity, introducing a number of strips and ongoing series, most of which ran in underground newspapers or erotic magazines:\n\nPrint Mint published four issues of Bodē's solo series \"Junkwaffel\" from 1971–1974. Bodē's graphic novel \"The Man\", published by Print Mint in 1972, is about a caveman who accidentally makes important observations about life.\n\nBeginning in 1972, Bodē toured with a show called the \"Cartoon Concert,\" that featured him vocalizing his characters while their depictions were presented on a screen behind him via a slide projector. The first of these was presented in October 1972 at the Detroit Triple Fan Fair in front of 80 people. He next did the \"Concert\" at Bowling Green State University, and eventually performed it at several comic book conventions, including the November 1972 Creation Con in New York City. Observing the crowd reaction, The Bantam Lecture Bureau immediately signed him on, and the show became very popular on the college lecture circuit. Bodē even performed it at The Louvre, in Paris.\n\nBodē was born in Utica, New York, the son of Kenneth and Elsie Bodé. His surname suggests German heritage. Vaughn was one of four children, including his older brother Victor and younger siblings Vincent and Valerie. Vaughn's father was an alcoholic; he started drawing as a way of escaping a less-than-happy childhood. Bodē's parents divorced when he was around ten years old, and he was sent to live with an uncle near Washington, D.C.\n\nAfter joining the Army at age 19, Bodē went AWOL but later received an honorable discharge due to a psychiatric diagnosis.\n\nBodē married Barbara Hawkins at age 20 in 1961. Their son Mark was born in 1963. Barbara divorced Bodē in 1972, and he moved to San Francisco in 1973 (with some of his underground contemporaries, including Robbins and Spain).\n\nAround 1970–1971, conversations with the guru Prem Rawat and fellow cartoonist Jeffrey Catherine Jones (with whom Bodē shared a studio in Woodstock, New York) led Bodē to cross-dressing, transvestism, and even a short-lived experiment with female hormones. Bodē described his sexuality as \"auto-sexual, heterosexual, homosexual, mano-sexual, sado-sexual, trans-sexual, uni-sexual, omni-sexual.\"\n\nBodē's death was due to autoerotic asphyxiation. His last words were to his son: \"Mark, I've seen God four times, and I'm going to see him again soon. That's No. 1 to me, and you're No. 2.\" Thirty-three years old at the time of his death, Bodē's ashes were dropped from a Cessna airplane over the waters off the coast of Point Reyes.\n\nHe left behind a library of sketchbooks, journals, finished and unfinished works, paintings, and comic strips. Most of his art has since been published in a variety of collections, mostly from Fantagraphics.\n\nBodē was a friend of animator Ralph Bakshi, and warned him against working with Robert Crumb on the animated film adaptation of Crumb's strip \"Fritz the Cat\". Bodē has been credited as an influence on Bakshi's films \"Wizards\" and \"The Lord of the Rings\".\n\nThe above statement is very unclear. It is far more likely that Robert Crumb warned Bode against working with Ralph Bakshi. It was Bakshi's film, inspired by Crumb's Fritz the Cat creation. Crumb states that he did not want the film made, but that the production \"steamrollered\" right over him.\n\nBodē has a huge following among graffiti artists and his work can often be seen replicated in the world of street art. As the original New York graffiti train writers (such as DONDI) chose to replicate his characters, images from his work have remained popular throughout the history of graffiti.\n\nHis son Mark Bodé is also an artist, producing works similar to the elder Bodē's style, and further cementing his father's legacy. In 2004, Mark completed one of his father's unfinished works, \"The Lizard of Oz\", a send-up of \"The Wizard of Oz\", starring Cheech Wizard one more time.\n\nThe Hugo Award for Best Fan Artist was bestowed upon him in 1969, and he was nominated for Best Professional Artist the following year. He also won the , awarded by the International Congress of Cartoonists and Animators at the Italian Lucca comics festival, in 1974. He was a finalist for induction into the Eisner Hall of Fame in 1998 and 2002, before finally being inducted in 2006.\n\n\nCollected comics series, artwork and sketches published by Fantagraphics; 14 trade-paperback volumes and one comic book:\n\nAlso material collected only by other publishers:\n\n"}
{"id": "2548579", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2548579", "title": "Voluntary euthanasia", "text": "Voluntary euthanasia\n\nVoluntary euthanasia is the practice of ending a life in a painless manner. Voluntary euthanasia (VE) and physician-assisted suicide (PAS) have been the focus of great controversy in recent years.\n\nAs of 2009, some forms of voluntary euthanasia are legal in Belgium, Colombia, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Switzerland, and Canada.\n\nVoluntary refusal of food and fluids (VRFF) or Patient Refusal of Nutrition and Hydration (PRNH) is bordering on euthanasia. Some authors classify it as a form of passive euthanasia, while others treat it separately because it is treated differently from legal point of view and often perceived as a more ethical option. VRFF is sometimes suggested as a legal alternative to euthanasia in jurisdictions disallowing euthanasia.\n\nAssisted suicide is a practice in which a person receives assistance in bringing about their death, typically people suffering from a severe physical illness, in which the final step in the process is actively performed by the person concerned. In physician-assisted suicide (also called physician aid-in-dying or PAD) a physician knowingly provides a competent but suffering patient, upon the patient's request, with the means by which the patient intends to end his or her own life. Assisted suicide is contrasted with \"active euthanasia\" when the difference between providing the means and actively administering lethal medicine is considered important. For example, Swiss law allows assisted suicide while all forms of active euthanasia (like lethal injection) remain prohibited.\n\nThe term euthanasia comes from the Greek words \"eu\"-meaning good and \"thanatos\"-meaning death, which combined means “well-death” or \"dying well\". Hippocrates mentions euthanasia in the Hippocratic Oath, which was written between 400 and 300 BC The original Oath states: “To please no one will I prescribe a deadly drug nor give advice which may cause his death.” Despite this, the ancient Greeks and Romans generally did not believe that life needed to be preserved at any cost and were, in consequence, tolerant of suicide in cases where no relief could be offered to the dying or, in the case of the Stoics and Epicureans, where a person no longer cared for his life.\n\nEnglish Common Law from the 14th century until the middle of the last century made suicide a criminal act in England and Wales. Assisting others to kill themselves remains illegal in that jurisdiction. However, in the 16th century, Thomas More, considered a saint by Roman Catholics, described a utopian community and envisaged such a community as one that would facilitate the death of those whose lives had become burdensome as a result of \"torturing and lingering pain\", see The meaning of the work.\n\nSince the 19th century, euthanasia has sparked intermittent debates and activism in Europe and the Americas. According to medical historian Ezekiel Emanuel, it was the availability of anesthesia that ushered in the modern era of euthanasia. In 1828, the first known anti-euthanasia law in the United States was passed in the state of New York, with many other localities and states following suit over a period of several years. After the Civil War, voluntary euthanasia was promoted by advocates, including some doctors. Support peaked around the start of the 20th century in the US and then grew again in the 1930s.\n\nIn an article in the \"Bulletin of the History of Medicine\", Brown University historian Jacob M. Appel documented extensive political debate over legislation to legalize physician-assisted suicide in both Iowa and Ohio in 1906. Appel indicates social activist Anna S. Hall was the driving force behind this movement. According to historian Ian Dowbiggin, leading public figures, including Clarence Darrow and Jack London, advocated for the legalization of euthanasia.\n\nIn 1937, doctor-assisted euthanasia was declared legal in Switzerland as long as the doctor ending the life had nothing to gain. During this same era, US courts tackled cases involving critically ill people who requested physician assistance in dying as well as \"mercy killings,\" such as by parents of their severely disabled children.\n\nDuring the post-war period, prominent proponents of euthanasia included Glanville Williams (\"The Sanctity of Life and the Criminal Law\") and clergyman Joseph Fletcher (\"Morals and medicine\"). By the 1960s, advocacy for a right-to-die approach to voluntary euthanasia increased.\n\nIn 1996, the world's first euthanasia legislation, the Rights of the Terminally Ill Act 1996, was passed in the Northern Territory of Australia. Four patients died through assisted suicide under the Act, using a device designed by Dr Philip Nitschke. The legislation was overturned by Australia’s Federal Parliament in 1997. In response to the overturning of the Act, Nitschke founded EXIT International. In 2009, an Australian quadriplegic was granted the right to refuse sustenance and be allowed to die. The Supreme Court of Western Australia ruled that it was up to Christian Rossiter, aged 49, to decide if he was to continue to receive medical care (tube feeding) and that his carers had to abide by his wishes. Chief Justice Wayne Martin also stipulated that his carers, Brightwater Care, would not be held criminally responsible for following his instructions. Rossiter died on 21 September 2009 following a chest infection.\n\nOn 20 May 1997, the Constitutional Court of Colombia decriminalised piety homicide, for terminally ill patients, stating that \"the medical author cannot be held responsible for the assisted suicide of a terminally ill patient\" and urged Congress to regulate euthanasia \"in the shortest time possible\".\n\nOn 15 December 2014, the Constitutional Court had given the Ministry of Health and Social Protection 30 days to publish guidelines for the healthcare sector to use in order to guarantee terminated ill patients, with the wish to undergo euthanasia, their right to a dignified death.\n\nIn 1957 in Britain, Judge Devlin ruled in the trial of Dr John Bodkin Adams that causing death through the administration of lethal drugs to a patient, if the intention is solely to alleviate pain, is not considered murder even if death is a potential or even likely outcome. In 1993, the Netherlands decriminalized doctor-assisted suicide, and in 2002, restrictions were loosened. During that year, physician-assisted suicide was approved in Belgium. Belgium's at the time most famous author Hugo Claus, suffering from Alzheimer's disease, was among those that asked for euthanasia. He died in March 2008, assisted by an Antwerp doctor.\n\nA key turning point in the debate over voluntary euthanasia (and physician assisted dying), at least in the United States, was the public furor over the Karen Ann Quinlan case. The Quinlan case paved the way for legal protection of voluntary passive euthanasia. In 1977, California legalized living wills and other states soon followed suit.\n\nIn 1980 the Hemlock Society USA was founded in Santa Monica by Derek Humphry. It was the first group in the United States to provide information to the terminally ill in case they wanted a hastened death. Hemlock also campaigned and partially financed drives to reform the law. In 2003 Hemlock was merged with End of Life Choices, which changed its name to Compassion and Choices.\n\nIn 1990, Dr. Jack Kevorkian, a Michigan physician, became famous for educating and assisting people in committing physician-assisted suicide, which resulted in a Michigan law against the practice in 1992. Kevorkian was tried and convicted in 1999 for a murder displayed on television. Also in 1990, the Supreme Court approved the use of non-active euthanasia.\n\nIn 1994, Oregon voters approved the Death with Dignity Act, permitting doctors to assist terminal patients with six months or less to live to end their lives. The U.S. Supreme Court allowed such laws in 1997. The Bush administration failed in its attempt to use drug law to stop Oregon in 2001, in the case \"Gonzales v. Oregon\".\n\nIn 2005, amid U.S. government roadblocks and controversy, Terri Schiavo, a Floridian who had been in a vegetative state since 1990, had her feeding tube removed. Her husband had won the right to take her off life support, which he claimed she would want but was difficult to confirm as she had no living will and the rest of her family claimed otherwise.\n\nIn November 2008, Washington Initiative 1000 made Washington the second U.S. state to legalize physician-assisted suicide.\n\nEuthanasia is a criminal offense in China. For example, in Shanghai a 67-year-old man was sentenced to 5 years in prison when he euthanized his 92-year-old mother when she emerged from a hospital procedure only able to move one finger and one toe. The sentence was considered lenient because he had displayed filial piety toward his mother.\n\nWhile active euthanasia remains illegal in China, it is gaining increasing acceptance among doctors and the general populace.\n\nIn Hong Kong, support for euthanasia among the general public is higher among those who put less importance on religious belief, those who are non-Christian, those who have higher family incomes, those who have more experience in taking care of terminally ill family members, and those who are older.\n\nSince World War II, the debate over euthanasia in Western countries has centered on voluntary euthanasia within regulated health care systems. In some cases, judicial decisions, legislation, and regulations have made voluntary euthanasia an explicit option for patients and their guardians. Proponents and critics of such voluntary euthanasia policies offer the following reasons for and against official voluntary euthanasia policies:\n\nProponents of voluntary euthanasia emphasize that choice is a fundamental principle for liberal democracies and free market systems.\n\nThe pain and suffering a person feels during a disease, even with pain relievers, can be incomprehensible to a person who has not gone through it. Even without considering the physical pain, it is often difficult for patients to overcome the emotional pain of losing their independence.\n\nThose who witness others die are \"particularly convinced\" that the law should be changed to allow assisted death.\n\nToday in many countries there is a shortage of hospital space. Medical personnel and hospital beds could be used for people whose lives could be saved instead of continuing the lives of those who want to die, thus increasing the general quality of care and shortening hospital waiting lists. It is a burden to keep people alive past the point they can contribute to society, especially if the resources used could be spent on a curable ailment.\n\nCritics argue that voluntary euthanasia could unduly compromise the professional roles of health care employees, especially doctors. They point out that European physicians of previous centuries traditionally swore some variation of the Hippocratic Oath, which in its ancient form excluded euthanasia: \"To please no one will I prescribe a deadly drug nor give advice which may cause his death..\" However, since the 1970s, this oath has largely fallen out of use.\n\nSome people, including many Christians, consider euthanasia of some or all types to be morally unacceptable. This view usually treats euthanasia to be a type of murder and voluntary euthanasia as a type of suicide, the morality of which is the subject of active debate.\n\nIf there is some reason to believe the cause of a patient's illness or suffering is or will soon be curable, the correct action is sometimes considered to attempt to bring about a cure or engage in palliative care.\n\nFeasibility of implementation: Euthanasia can only be considered \"voluntary\" if a patient is mentally competent to make the decision, i.e., has a rational understanding of options and consequences. Competence can be difficult to determine or even define.\n\nConsent under pressure: Given the economic grounds for voluntary euthanasia, critics of voluntary euthanasia are concerned that patients may experience psychological pressure to consent to voluntary euthanasia rather than be a financial burden on their families. Even where health costs are mostly covered by public money, as in most developed countries, voluntary euthanasia critics are concerned that hospital personnel would have an economic incentive to advise or pressure people toward euthanasia consent.\n\nNon-voluntary euthanasia is sometimes cited as one of the possible outcomes of the slippery slope argument, in which it is claimed that permitting voluntary euthanasia to occur will lead to the support and legalization of non-voluntary and involuntary euthanasia.\n\nThe right to life movement opposes voluntary euthanasia.\n\nEuthanasia brings about many ethical issues regarding a patient’s death. Some physicians say euthanasia is a rational choice for competent patients who wish to die to escape unbearable suffering.\n\nPhysicians who are in favor of euthanasia state that to keep euthanasia or physician-assisted suicide (PAS) illegal is a violation of patient freedoms. They believe that any competent terminally-ill patient should have the right to choose death or refuse life-saving treatment. Suicide and assistance from their physician is seen as the only option those patients have. With the suffering and the knowledge from the doctor, this may also suggest that PAS is a humane answer to the excruciating pain.\n\nAn argument against PAS is the violation of the Hippocratic oath that some doctors take. The Hippocratic oath states \"I will not give a lethal drug to anyone if I am asked, nor will I advise such a plan\".\n\nAnother reason for prohibiting PAS and euthanasia is the option of abusing PAS if it were to become legal. Poor or uninsured patients may not have the money or no access to proper care will have limited options, and they could be pressured towards assisted death.\n\nDuring the 20th century, efforts to change government policies on euthanasia have met limited success in Western countries. Euthanasia policies have also been developed by a variety of NGOs, most notably medical associations and advocacy organizations.\n\nThere are many different religious views on the issue of voluntary euthanasia, although many moral theologians are critical of the procedure.\n\nEuthanasia can be accomplished either through an oral, intravenous, or intramuscular administration of drugs, or by oxygen deprivation (anoxia), as in some euthanasia machines. In individuals who are incapable of swallowing lethal doses of medication, an intravenous route is preferred. The following is a Dutch protocol for parenteral (intravenous) administration to obtain euthanasia:\n\nIntravenous administration is the most reliable and rapid way to accomplish euthanasia. A coma is first induced by intravenous administration of 20 mg/kg sodium thiopental (Nesdonal) in a small volume (10 ml physiological saline). Then a triple intravenous dose of a non-depolarizing neuromuscular muscle relaxant is given, such as 20 mg pancuronium bromide (Pavulon) or 20 mg vecuronium bromide (Norcuron). The muscle relaxant should preferably be given intravenously, in order to ensure optimal availability. Only for pancuronium bromide (Pavulon) are there substantial indications that the agent may also be given intramuscularly in a dosage of 40 mg.\n\nWith regards to voluntary euthanasia, many people argue that 'equal access' should apply to access to suicide as well, so therefore disabled people who cannot kill themselves should have access to voluntary euthanasia.\n\nApart from \"The Old Law\", a 17th-century tragicomedy written by Thomas Middleton, William Rowley, and Philip Massinger, one of the early books to deal with euthanasia in a fictional context is Anthony Trollope's 1882 dystopian novel, \"The Fixed Period\". Ricarda Huch's novel \"The Deruga Case\" (1917) is about a physician who is acquitted after performing euthanasia on his dying ex-wife.\n\n\"Quality of Mercy\" in \"The Prosecution Rests\" is a fable exploring the facets of aging, Alzheimer's disease, and euthanasia. The story line makes no judgement but frees the reader to decide.\n\nThe plot of Christopher Buckley's 2007 novel \"Boomsday\" involves the use of 'Voluntary euthanasia' of seniors as a political ploy to stave off the insolvency of social security as more and more of the aging US population reaches retirement age.\n\nThe films \"Children of Men\" and \"Soylent Green\" depict instances of government-sponsored euthanasia in order to strengthen their dystopian themes. The protagonist of the film \"Johnny Got His Gun\" is a brutally mutilated war veteran whose request for euthanasia furthers the work's anti-war message. The recent films \"Mar Adentro\" and \"Million Dollar Baby\" argue more directly in favor of euthanasia by illustrating the suffering of their protagonists. These films have provoked debate and controversy in their home countries of Spain and the United States respectively.\n\nIn March 2010, the PBS \"Frontline\" TV program in the United States showed a documentary called \"The Suicide Tourist\" which told the story of Professor Craig Ewert, his family, and the Swiss group Dignitas, and their decision to help him commit assisted suicide in Switzerland after he was diagnosed and suffering with ALS (Lou Gehrig's Disease).\n\nThrash metal band Megadeth's 1994 album \"Youthanasia\" (the title is a pun on euthanasia) implies that society is euthanizing its youth.\n\nThe documentary film \"How to Die in Oregon\" follows the lives of select terminally ill individuals who weigh the options of continuing to live and euthanasia. This film employs emotional appeal to the audience on the controversial topic of voluntary euthanasia.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "457455", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=457455", "title": "Zeng Guofan", "text": "Zeng Guofan\n\nZeng Guofan, Marquis Yiyong ( ; 26 November 1811 – 12 March 1872), birth name Zeng Zicheng, courtesy name Bohan, was a Chinese statesman, military general, and Confucian scholar of the late Qing dynasty. He is best known for raising and organizing the Xiang Army to aid the Qing military in suppressing the Taiping Rebellion and restoring the stability of the Qing Empire. Along with other prominent figures such as Zuo Zongtang and Li Hongzhang, Zeng set the scene for the Tongzhi Restoration, an attempt to arrest the decline of the Qing dynasty. Zeng was known for his strategic perception, administrative skill and noble personality on Confucianist practice, but also for the ruthlessness of his repression of the rebellion. He exemplified loyalty in an era of chaos, but is also regarded as a precursor to the rise of warlordism. William T. Rowe describes him as the \"de facto representative of Qing control in most of central and south China\" during the 1850's and 60's.\n\nBorn Zeng Zicheng in Xiangxiang, Hunan Province in 1811, Zeng was the grandson of Zeng Yuping, a farmer with social and political ambitions. He was also a descendant of the philosopher Zengzi, a student of Confucius. He studied in Yuelu Academy in Changsha Prefecture, where he passed the prefectural examination in 1833, only a year after his father, Zeng Linshu. He passed the provincial examination a year later, and by 1838, at age 27, he had successfully passed the imperial examination, a prestigious achievement in China. He had earned the \"jinshi\" degree, the highest level in the civil service examinations, which led to his appointment to the Hanlin Academy, a body of outstanding Chinese literary scholars who performed literary tasks for the imperial court. It was at the Hanlin Academy where Zeng changed his given name to \"Guofan\", which sounded more prestigious. Zeng served in Beijing for more than 13 years, and remained devoted to the interpretation of the Confucian classics. He moved relatively quickly up the ranks with the aid of his teacher, Mujangga; within five years, he had become a second-grade official.\n\nIn 1843, Zeng was appointed as the chief literary examiner in Sichuan Province. Six years later, he was made Senior Deputy Secretary of the Board of Rites. When holding the office of Military Examiner (1851), he was compelled by the death of his mother to return to Hunan Province to carry out filial mourning, which is supposed to last three years. Around the time, the Taiping rebels had overrun Hunan Province and captured the cities and strongholds on both shores of the Yangtze River. By a special decree, Zeng was ordered to assist the provincial governor in raising a volunteer force, and, on his own initiative, he built a fleet of war junks and multiple arsenals, with which he attacked the rebels. This force eventually became known as the Xiang Army (a.k.a. Hunan Army or Chu Army). In training and commanding the Xiang Army, Zeng emphasized \"family ties, individual responsibility, flexible yet responsible disciple, enhanced military pay, respect for intellectuals serving in the army, and a strong bond between officers and soldiers.\" In his first engagement with the rebels, Zeng was defeated, but his lieutenants were more successful. They recovered the provincial capital, Changsha, and destroyed the rebel fleet. Following up these victories of his subordinates, Zeng recaptured Wuchang and Hanyang, near Hankou, and was rewarded for his success by being appointed vice-president of the Board of War. The Xiang Army under Zeng contained some integrated Hangzhou drill groups.\n\nIn 1853, other triumphs led to Zeng being made a \"baturu\", and to his being decorated with a yellow riding-jacket. Meanwhile, in his absence, the rebels retook Wuchang and burnt the protecting fleet. The tide quickly turned, however, on May 1, 1854 Zeng defeated the Taiping at Xiangtan and in July at Yuezhou. Zeng succeeded in clearing the country round Poyang Lake, and subsequently in ridding Jiangsu Province of the rebels. In January–February 1855 the Xiang Army sufferers a disastrous defeat at Jiujiang, Jiangxi, leading to Zeng attempting suicide. His father died in 1857, and after a brief mourning he was ordered to take supreme command in Zhejiang Province, and to cooperate with the governor of Fujian Province in defence.\n\nSubsequently, the rebels were driven westwards, and Zeng would have started in pursuit had he not been called on to clear Anhui Province of rebel forces. In June 1860, he was appointed Viceroy of Liangjiang (covering Jiangxi, Anhui and Jiangsu provinces) and Imperial Commissioner, overseeing military affairs. At this time, and for some time previously, he had been fortunate in having the active support of Zuo Zongtang, who at a later period recovered Kashgar for the Qing Empire, and of Li Hongzhang. Like all true leaders of men, Zeng knew how to reward good service, and when occasion offered he appointed the former to the governorship of Zhejiang and the latter to that of Jiangsu. In 1862, he was appointed Assistant Grand Secretary of State. At this time, the Qing imperial forces, assisted by the Ever Victorious Army, had checked the progress of the Taiping Rebellion, and Zeng was able to carry out a scheme which he had long formulated of besieging Tianjing, the rebel capital. While Charles George Gordon of the Ever Victorious Army was clearing the cities on the lower waters of the Yangtze River with support from Li Hongzhang, Zeng drew closer his besieging lines around the city.\n\nIn July 1864, Tianjing fell into Zeng's hands, and he was rewarded with the noble peerage \"First Class Marquis Yiyong\" (一等毅勇侯) and the right to wear the double-eyed peacock's feather. He, Zuo Zongtang and Li Hongzhang were collectively called \"Zeng, Zuo, Li\" – the military leaders who suppressed the Taiping Rebellion. After the suppression of the rebellion, the Nian Rebellion, closely related to the former Taiping movement, broke out in Shandong Province, and Zeng was sent to quell it.\n\nSuccess did not, however, always attend him on this campaign, and by imperial order he was relieved of his command by Li Hongzhang, who in the same way succeeded him as the Viceroy of Zhili, where, after the Tianjin Massacre (1870), Zeng failed to carry out the wishes of the imperial court. Instead of the desired policy towards foreigners, Zeng took on a more diplomatic stance. After this rebuff, he retired to his viceroyalty at Nanjing, where he died in 1872 mysteriously in Hong Xiuquan's former mansion.\n\nZeng was a voluminous writer. His papers addressed to the throne and his literary disquisitions are held in high esteem by Chinese scholars, who treasure as the edition of his collected works in 156 books, which was edited by Li Hongzhang in 1876, as a memorial of a great and incorruptible statesman. Zeng enjoyed reading and held a special interest in the \"Twenty-Four Histories\" and other Chinese classics. He was also a dedicated poet and a diary author.\n\nZeng called Hakka females \"big foot hillbilly witch(es)\" during the Taiping Rebellion after his encountering with them.\n\nUnlike his contemporaries, who had multiple wives or kept concubines, Zeng was officially married only once, to a woman of the Ouyang family when he was in his late teens. His wife was known to be a capable woman. He had three sons and five daughters with her, and two of his eldest children died young. His eldest son, Zeng Jize, who inherited his noble peerage \"First Class Marquis Yiyong\", went on to become a famous diplomat in the late Qing dynasty.\n\nZeng's ninth brother, Zeng Guoquan, was an ambitious general in the Xiang Army. He was later appointed Viceroy of Liangjiang in 1884. Zeng's great-granddaughter, Zeng Baosun, was a feminist, historian, and Christian educator.\n\nZeng is said to be a descendant of Zengzi, which in turn is a descendant of King Shao Kang of the Xia Dynasty.\n\nZeng's legacy in history is twofold. On one hand he is criticised as a staunchly conservative traitor, but on another he is seen as a hero in preserving order and stability. Many in China and abroad admire his ability to successfully survive in the ruthless bureaucracy of the late Qing dynasty. Many have blamed Zeng for all the civilian losses and damages done during the Taiping Rebellion, while others criticise him for being too friendly with certain foreign ideas.\n\nSince the Cultural Revolution, criticism of Zeng gradually began to disappear. Tang Haoming published in 1992 his three-book trilogy \"Zeng Guofan\", a novelisation of Zeng's life during and after the Taiping Rebellion. This trilogy characterised Zeng as a common person, but had adopted a much more positive view of Zeng. Mao Zedong and Chiang Kai-shek also praised Zeng's ability in military and political affairs.\n\nIn recent years, Zeng's life and his works have been widely celebrated, especially as an example of local pride in Hunan Province. Zeng's leadership and military skills had been used by many as a new field of thought aiding in business or bureaucratic dealings, as in the \"self-help\" \"99 Strategems from Zeng Guofan\".\n\n\n\n"}
