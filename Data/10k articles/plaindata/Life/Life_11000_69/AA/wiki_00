He wrote a chronicle in the 1530s that gives an insight into contemporary thought and contains anecdotes that appear in later writings. The manuscript of the Roit or Quheil of Tyme is kept at the National Library of Scotland, Ms. 1746. It was donated by Lt.-Colonel W. W. Cunninghame of Caprington.\n\nAbell was born at Prestonpans around 1480. He was related to the Bellenden family; Robert Bellenden, Abbot of Holyrood was his great-uncle. Abell became a monk at Inchaffray Abbey in 1495, then moved to be an Observantine Franciscan Friar at Jedburgh. His chronicle, the \"Roit or Quheil of Tyme\" ends in 1537. Possibly Abell died soon after. The manuscript survived in the family of Sinclair of Roslin Castle.\n\nAbell recounts much legendary history including the story of King Lear and his daughters, and Macbeth and the witches. The chronicle ends in 1537 mentioning a process of divorce between Margaret Tudor, and Harry Stewart, Lord Methven. Norman Macdougall thought the three pages of the \"Quheil of Tyme\" that refer to James III of Scotland significant enough to print in his study of the king. Abell said of the death of James III in 1488:\"thai conspirit againis the king and gaif him batell beside striwiling and thare he wes slane. He wes confessit before with maistir Johne Yrland proffessor of theologie., ... thai slew him in the mill of bannoburne.. Macdougall found nothing strikingly original in Abell's account of James III, which depends in part on Hector Boece, but was able to infer that his other sources for the reign were sympathetic to James III and Alexander Stewart, Duke of Albany, and to Abell's contemporary, John Stewart, Duke of Albany. Writing in 1537 of events in the previous year, Abell tells the story of the visit of James V of Scotland to Mary of Bourbon, with the interesting suggestion that there had been an exchange of portraits;\"In ane dissimilit vestement he com to the duik of Vendôme fathir of the lady that he suld haif marreit. He wes knawin thare be his picture.\"\n\nAlasdair Stewart contends that Abell's moralising handling of his subject matter and the examples he offers show his own strong character, contemporary attitudes and a unique view of international events from the cloister at Jedburgh.\n\n"}

{"id": "18915928", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18915928", "title": "As We May Think", "text": "As We May Think\n\n\"As We May Think\" is a 1945 essay by Vannevar Bush which has been described as visionary and influential, anticipating many aspects of information society. It was first published in \"The Atlantic\" in July 1945 and republished in an abridged version in September 1945—before and after the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Bush expresses his concern for the direction of scientific efforts toward destruction, rather than understanding, and explicates a desire for a sort of collective memory machine with his concept of the memex that would make knowledge more accessible, believing that it would help fix these problems. Through this machine, Bush hoped to transform an information explosion into a knowledge explosion.\n\nThe article was a reworked and expanded version of Bush's essay \"Mechanization and the Record\" (1939). Here, he described a machine that would combine lower level technologies to achieve a higher level of organized knowledge (like human memory processes). Shortly after the publication of this essay, Bush coined the term \"memex\" in a letter written to the editor of \"Fortune\" magazine. That letter became the body of \"As We May Think\", which added only an introduction and conclusion. As described, Bush's memex was based on what was thought, at the time, to be advanced technology of the future: ultra high resolution microfilm reels, coupled to multiple screen viewers and cameras, by electromechanical controls. The memex, in essence, reflects a library of collective knowledge stored in a piece of machinery described in his essay as \"a piece of furniture\". The \"Atlantic\" publication of Bush's article was followed, in the September 10, 1945 issue of \"Life\" magazine, by a reprint that showed illustrations of the proposed memex desk and automatic typewriter. (Coincidentally, the same issue of \"Life\" contained aerial photos of Hiroshima after the dropping of the atomic bomb, a project Bush was instrumental in starting). Bush also discussed other technologies such as dry photography and microphotography where he elaborates on the potentialities of their future use. For example, Bush states in his essay that: \n\n\"As We May Think\" predicted (to some extent) many kinds of technology invented after its publication, including hypertext, personal computers, the Internet, the World Wide Web, speech recognition, and online encyclopedias such as Wikipedia: \"Wholly new forms of encyclopedias will appear, ready-made with a mesh of associative trails running through them, ready to be dropped into the memex and there amplified.\" Bush envisioned the ability to retrieve several articles or pictures on one screen, with the possibility of writing comments that could be stored and recalled together. He believed people would create links between related articles, thus mapping the thought process and path of each user and saving it for others to experience. Wikipedia is one example of how this vision has in part been realized, allowing elements of an article to reference other related topics. A user's browser history maps the trails of possible paths of interaction, although this is typically available only to the user that created it.\nBush's article also laid the foundation for new media. Doug Engelbart came across the essay shortly after its publication, and keeping the memex in mind, he began work that would eventually result in the invention of the mouse, the word processor, the hyperlink and concepts of new media for which these groundbreaking inventions were merely enabling technologies.\n\nToday, storage has greatly surpassed the level imagined by Vannevar Bush, On the other hand, it still uses methods of indexing of information which Bush described as artificial: This description resembles popular file systems of modern computer operating systems (FAT, NTFS, ext3 when used without hard links and symlinks, etc.), which do not easily enable associative indexing as imagined by Bush.\n\nBush urges that scientists should turn to the massive task of creating more efficient accessibility to our fluctuating store of knowledge. For years inventions have extended people's physical powers rather than the powers of their mind. He argues that the instruments are at hand which, if properly developed, will give society access to and command over the inherited knowledge of the ages. The perfection of these pacific instruments, he suggests, should be the first objective of our scientists.\n\nThrough this process, society would be able to focus and evolve past the existing knowledge rather than looping through infinite calculations. We should be able to pass the tedious work of numbers to machines and work on the intricate theory which puts them best to use. If humanity were able to obtain the \"privilege of forgetting the manifold things he does not need to have immediately at hand, with some assurance that he can find them again if proven important\" only then \"will mathematics be practically effective in bringing the growing knowledge of atomistic to the useful solution of the advanced problems of chemistry, metallurgy, and biology\". To exemplify the importance of this concept, consider the process involved in 'simple' shopping: \"Every time a charge sale is made, there are a number of things to be done. The inventory needs to be revised, the salesman needs to be given credit for the sale, the general accounts need an entry, and most important, the customer needs to be charged.\" Due to the convenience of the store's central device which rapidly manage thousands of these transactions, the employees may focus on the essential aspects of the department such as sales and advertising.\n\nIndeed, as of today, \"science has provided the swiftest communication between individuals; it has provided a record of ideas and has enabled man to manipulate and to make extracts from that record so that knowledge evolves and endures throughout the life of a race rather than of an individual\". Improved technology has become an extension of our capabilities, much as how external hard drives function for computers so it may reserve more memory for more practical tasks.\n\nAnother significant role of practicality in technology is the method of association and selection. \"There may be millions of fine thoughts, and the account of the experience on which they are based, all encased within stone walls of acceptable architectural form; but if the scholar can get at only one a week by diligent search, his synthesis are not likely to keep up with the current scene.\" Bush believes that the tools available in his time lacked this feature, but noted the emergence and development of such ideas such as the Memex, a cross referencing system.\n\nBush concludes his essay by stating that: \n\nMany scientists, especially physicists, get new duties during the War. Now, after the war, they need new duties.\n\n\"Section 1:\" The use of Science has improved tremendously in many ways for humans. The knowledge of science has grown considerably. However, the way we manage it still remains the same for centuries. We are no longer able to use what Science finds out. Alternatively, the technology has matured greatly and allows us to now produce complicated, yet cheap and dependable machines.\n\n\"Section 2:\" Science is really useful. However, in order to have it to be very efficient and useful it should not only be stored but also be frequently consulted and enhanced. In the future we would probably be able to store human writings in a small room with the use of photography.\n\n\"Section 3:\" Using the latest advances of speech recording and stenography, we will soon be able to make printing immediate. The advancement of photography is not going to stop. The thought process of repetition could be in relation to machine. Electrical machines will be the advancement of arithmetical computation.\n\n\"Section 4:\" There is more to the scientific reasoning than just arithmetic. There are a few machines that are not used for arithmetic, partly due to the market’s needs. Solving higher mathematics require other repetitive processes of thought to be mechanized.\n\n\"Section 5:\" A machine could be used anywhere where there is logical thought process. At this moment we do not have the necessary tools for the selection (the key to utilize science) of knowledge. One of the best forms of selection is illustrated by the automatic telephone exchange.\n\n\"Section 6:\" There is a problem with selection. The main problem of it is the deficiency of the indexing systems. When data is recorded and put into storage, it is usually filed alphabetically or numerically. The human mind works differently. It works according to association. Instead of using selection by indexing, selection by association may be mechanized. Thus, improving the permanence and clarity of the items stored. The memex is a device that could store information and communication (large memory). Some things that can be entered are, newspaper and books. The user is also able to find a particular book as he or she taps on its code on the keyboard. The codes that are frequently used to call forth pages are mnemonic and its possible to browse these pages at different speeds.\n\n\"Section 7:\" The main feature of the memex is the ability to tie two things together at will. In other words, to be able to associate two arbitrary items when wanted. The user is also able to build a trail, in which they name it, insert a name into the code book, and then taps it out on the keyboard. At any time, the user is able to view two items at the same time, parallel viewing. It is also possible to pass items to another memex.\n\n\"Section 8:\" The trails made can be shared with others and can also be published, like an encyclopedia (many more new forms are to appear). Soon we will be able to establish some kind of direct connection with absorbing material of the record with one of our senses, tactilely, orally, and visually. It would be great for humans to be able analyze present issues. As of now, science has been applied to live better, as well as for destruction. Possibly we may be able to apply the record to become wiser.\n\n\"As We May Think\" has turned out to be a visionary and influential essay. In their introduction to a paper discussing information literacy as a discipline, Johnston and Webber write \n\nIndeed, Bush was very concerned with information overload inhibiting the research efforts of scientists. His scientist, operating under conditions of \"information explosion\" and requiring respite from the tide of scientific documents could be construed as a nascent image of the \"Information Literate Person\" in an information saturated society. \n\n"}

The term was formed through a combination of the Spanish word \"balcón\" (balcony) and the English suffix \"ing\", a suffix that most Spanish associate with English culture and English people, in reference the origin of most practitioners.\n\nIn 2010 and 2011, a spate of injuries attributed to \"balconing\" by the Spanish press occurred among tourists in the Balearic Islands of Ibiza and Majorca in Spain. Videos of people jumping into pools from balconies were posted on video sharing web sites such as YouTube, which were alleged to have played a role in the spread of the phenomenon.\n\nIn 2010 in Spain, there were six deaths and 11 injuries in falls from balconies which were identified as relating to \"balconing\" in the Spanish press. Most of the casualties were young British and German tourists with traces of alcohol in their blood, and the incidents occurred between 10 p.m. and 7 a.m. In the same year, hotels were reported to have raised the height of hotel railings from 1.05 to 1.20 metres to reduce these incidents. In Mallorca 3 tourists died in 2017 in falls from balconies identified as \"balconing\" incidents in the Spanish press. Between 2010 and 2015 it has been described up to 46 injured to this practice.\n\nAccording to Juan José Segura, doctor at Son Espases´s hospital, 85% of the victims fall accidentally, usually while trying to jump from one balcony to the next or do some reckless movement near the edge, while the rest actively jump off the balcony. He estimates an average of 10 to 15 cases each year since 2011, with an increase since more of these jumps have been posted on YouTube.\n\nDoctor Segura and the British Foreign Office established the profile of the \"average practitioner\" as a 24 year old British male. \n97% of people involved in balconing are men, 61% are British. German and other nationalities are less numerous.\n\nThe medical assistance of the tourists injured in this practice costs an average of 32000 euros per case.\n\nThe balcon is a median height of eight meter, and the people have a median age of 24 years.\n\nIn 2018, the Foreign Office teamed up with Spanish surgeon, Juan José Segura-Sampedro to run a campaign of video messages to British tourists heading to the Balearic Islands during the summer. RTÉ also made a special program where the doctor participated from Mallorca.\n\nDespite of the previous campaigns \"balconing\" is still a problem and various hotels in the Balearic Islands have been forced to implement measurements against it, like closing their balconies or building taller walls around them.\nMagaluf, a very touristic city in the East coast of Spain, has been forced to regulate drinking in an attempt to control tourist behaviour, including but not limited to balconing. It has also introduced heavy fines for the practice of balconing - 750 to 1500 Euro.\n\nIn 2018, six victims have had \"balconing\" accidents (British, Irish, and one French). Three of them were killed by falling. This is more than during the years 2016 and 2017. Nonetheless, some cases might not be due to the practice of \"balconing\", but might have other causes like accidental fall due to excessive alcohol consumption.\n\n"}
{"id": "238512", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=238512", "title": "Bartholomew Roberts", "text": "Bartholomew Roberts\n\nBartholomew Roberts (17 May 1682 – 10 February 1722), born John Roberts, was a Welsh pirate who raided ships off the Americas and West Africa between 1719 and 1722. He was the most successful pirate of the Golden Age of Piracy as measured by vessels captured, taking over 400 prizes in his career. He is also known as Black Bart (), but this name was never used in his lifetime.\n\nHe was born John Roberts in 1682 in Casnewydd-Bach, between Fishguard and Haverfordwest in Pembrokeshire, Wales. His father was most likely George Roberts. It's not clear why Roberts changed his name from John to Bartholomew, but pirates often adopted aliases. He may have chosen his first name after the well-known buccaneer Bartholomew Sharp. He is thought to have gone to sea when he was 13 in 1695, but there is no further record of him until 1718, when he was mate of a Barbados sloop.\n\nIn 1719, Roberts was second mate on the slave ship \"Princess\" under Captain Abraham Plumb. In early June that year, the \"Princess\" was anchored at Anomabu (then spelled Annamaboa, which is situated along the Gold Coast of West Africa, present-day Ghana) when she was captured by pirates. The pirates were in two vessels, \"Royal Rover\" and \"Royal James,\" and were led by captain Howell Davis. Davis, like Roberts, was a Welshman, originally from Milford Haven in Pembrokeshire. Roberts and several other of the crew of the \"Princess\" were forced to join the pirates.\n\nDavis quickly discovered Roberts' abilities as a navigator and took to consulting him. He was also able to confide information to Roberts in Welsh, thereby keeping it hidden from the rest of the crew. Roberts is said to have been reluctant to become a pirate at first, but soon came to see the advantages of this new lifestyle. Captain Charles Johnson reports him as saying:\n\nIn the merchant navy, Roberts' wage was less than £4 per month and he had no chance of promotion to captaincy.\n\nA few weeks after Roberts' capture, \"Royal James\" had to be abandoned because of worm damage. \"Royal Rover\" headed for the island of Príncipe. Davis hoisted the flags of a British man-of-war and was allowed to enter the harbour. After a few days, Davis invited the governor to lunch on board his ship, intending to hold him hostage for a ransom. Davis had to send boats to collect the governor, and he was invited to call at the fort for a glass of wine first. The Portuguese had discovered that their visitors were pirates. They ambushed Davis' party on its way to the fort, shooting Davis dead.\n\nA new captain had to be elected. Davis' crew was divided into \"Lords\" and \"Commons\", and it was the \"Lords\" who had the right to propose a name to the remainder of the crew. Within six weeks of his capture, Roberts was elected captain. This was unusual, especially as he had objected to serving on the vessel. Historians believe he was elected for his navigational abilities and his personality, which history reflects was outspoken and opinionated.\nRoberts' first act as captain was to lead the crew back to Príncipe to avenge the death of Captain Davis. Roberts and his crew landed on the island in the darkness of night, killed a large portion of the male population, and stole all items of value that they could carry away. Soon afterwards, he captured a Dutch Guineaman, then two days later a British ship called \"Experiment\". The pirate ship took on water and provisions at Anamboe, where a vote was taken on whether the next voyage should be to the East Indies or to Brazil. The vote was for Brazil.\n\nThe combination of bravery and success that marked this adventure cemented most of the crew's loyalty to Roberts. They concluded that he was \"pistol proof\" and that they had much to gain by staying with him.\n\nRoberts and his crew crossed the Atlantic and watered and boot-topped their ship on the uninhabited island of Ferdinando. They spent about nine weeks off the Brazilian coast but saw no ships. They were about to leave for the West Indies when they encountered a fleet of 42 Portuguese ships in the Todos os Santos' Bay, waiting for two men-of-war of 70 guns each to escort them to Lisbon. Roberts took one of the vessels and ordered her master to point out the richest ship in the fleet. He pointed out \"Sagrada Familia,\" a ship of 40 guns and a crew of 170, which Roberts and his men boarded and captured. \"Sagrada Familia\" contained 40,000 gold moidores and jewellery designed for the King of Portugal, including a cross set with diamonds.\n\n\"Rover\" next headed for Devil's Island off the coast of Guiana to spend the booty. A few weeks later, they headed for the River Surinam where they captured a sloop. After they sighted a brigantine, Roberts took 40 men to pursue it in the sloop, leaving Walter Kennedy in command of \"Rover.\" The sloop became wind-bound for eight days, and when Roberts and his crew finally returned to their ship, they discovered that Kennedy had sailed off with \"Rover\" and what remained of the loot. Roberts and his crew renamed their sloop \"Fortune\" and agreed on new articles, now known as a pirate code, which they swore on a Bible to uphold:\nIn late February 1720, they were joined by French pirate Montigny la Palisse in another sloop, \"Sea King\". The inhabitants of Barbados equipped two well-armed ships, \"Summerset\" and \"Philipa\", to try to put an end to the pirate menace. On 26 February, they encountered the two pirate sloops. \"Sea King\" quickly fled, and \"Fortune\" broke off the engagement after sustaining considerable damage and was able to escape. Roberts headed for Dominica to repair the sloop, with twenty of his crew dying of their wounds on the voyage. There were also two sloops from Martinique out searching for the pirates, and Roberts swore vengeance against the inhabitants of Barbados and Martinique. He had a new flag made with a drawing of himself standing upon 2 skulls, one labelled ABH (A Barbadian's Head) and the other AMH (A Martiniquian's Head).\n\n\"Fortune\" next headed northwards towards Newfoundland, raiding Canso, Nova Scotia, and capturing a number of ships around Cape Breton and the Newfoundland banks. Roberts raided the harbour of Ferryland, capturing a dozen vessels. On 21 June, he attacked the larger harbour of Trepassey, sailing in with black flags flying. In the harbour he discovered 22 merchant ships and 150 fishing ships, all of which were abandoned by their panic-stricken captains and crews, and the pirates were masters of Trepassey without any resistance being offered. Roberts had captured all 22 merchant ships, but was angered by the cowardice of the captains who had fled their ships. Every morning he had a gun fired and the captains were forced to attend Roberts on board his ship; they were told that anyone who was absent would have his ship burnt. One brig from Bristol was taken over by the pirates to replace the sloop \"Fortune\" and fitted out with 16 guns. When the pirates left in late June, all the other vessels in the harbour were set on fire. During July, Roberts captured nine or ten French ships and commandeered one of them, fitting her with 26 cannons and changing her name to \"Good Fortune\". With this more powerful ship, the pirates captured many more vessels before heading south for the West Indies, accompanied by Montigny la Palisse's sloop, which had rejoined them.\n\nIn September 1720, \"Good Fortune\" was careened and repaired at the island of Carriacou before being renamed \"Royal Fortune\", the first of several ships to be given this name by Roberts. In late September, \"Royal Fortune\" and \"Fortune\" headed for the island of St. Christopher's and entered Basse Terra Road, flying black flags and with their drummers and trumpeters playing. They sailed in among the ships in the Road, all of which promptly struck their flags. The next landfall was at the island of St. Bartholomew, where the French governor allowed the pirates to remain for several weeks to carouse. By 25 October, they were at sea again off St. Lucia, where they captured up to 15 French and English ships in the next three days. Among the captured ships was \"Greyhound\", whose chief mate James Skyrme joined the pirates. He later became captain of Roberts' consort, \"Ranger\".\n\nDuring this time, Roberts reportedly caught the Governor of Martinique, who was sailing aboard a 52-gun French warship. The Governor was caught and promptly hanged on the yardarm of his own ship, which the pirates converted into the new \"Royal Fortune\". According to Konstam and Rickman, this reported capture was an embellishment by Captain Charles Johnson in his \"A General History of the Pyrates\".\n\nBy the spring of 1721, Roberts' depredations had almost brought seaborne trade to a standstill in the West Indies. \"Royal Fortune\" and \"Good Fortune\" therefore set sail for West Africa. On 18 April, Thomas Anstis, the commander of \"Good Fortune\", left Roberts in the night and continued to raid shipping in the Caribbean, with future captains John Fenn and Brigstock Weaver aboard. \"Royal Fortune\" continued towards Africa.\n\nBy late April, Roberts was at the Cape Verde islands. \"Royal Fortune\" was found to be leaky, and was abandoned there. The pirates transferred to \"Sea King\", which was renamed \"Royal Fortune\". The new \"Royal Fortune\" made landfall off the Guinea coast in early June, near the mouth of the Senegal River. Two French ships, one of 10 guns and one of 16 guns, gave chase, but were captured by Roberts. Both ships were commandeered. One, \"Comte de Toulouse\", was renamed \"Ranger\", while the other was named \"Little Ranger\" and used as a storeship. Thomas Sutton was made captain of \"Ranger\" and James Skyrme captain of \"Little Ranger\".\n\nRoberts next headed for Sierra Leone, arriving on 12 June. Here he was told by retired pirate John \"Old Crackers\" Leadstone that two Royal Navy ships, and , had left at the end of April, planning to return before Christmas. On 8 August, he captured two large ships at Point Cestos, now River Cess in Liberia. One of these was the frigate \"Onslow\", transporting soldiers bound for Cape Coast (Cabo Corso) Castle. A number of the soldiers wished to join the pirates, and they were eventually accepted, however they only received a quarter of a pirates pay because they were not sailors most of their lives. \"Onslow\" was converted to become the fourth \"Royal Fortune\". In November and December, the pirates careened their ships and relaxed at Cape Lopez and the island of Annobon. Sutton was replaced by Skyrme as captain of \"Ranger\".\n\nThey captured several vessels in January 1722, then sailed into Ouidah (Whydah) harbour with black flags flying. Ten of the eleven ships at anchor there immediately struck their colours, but were restored to their owners after a ransom of eight pounds of gold dust per ship was paid. The refusal of the eleventh vessel to surrender so enraged Roberts' crew that, under cover of night, they climbed aboard and set her on fire. The captured vessels were slave ships, and the one set on fire had around eighty enslaved Africans on board. They perished either as a result of the fire or by drowning or shark attack after jumping overboard.\n\nOn 5 February 1722, Captain Chaloner Ogle of HMS \"Swallow\" came upon the pirate ships \"Royal Fortune\", \"Ranger\", and \"Little Ranger\" careening at Cape Lopez. \"Swallow\" veered away to avoid a shoal, making the pirates think that she was a fleeing merchant ship; some sources claim Ogle spotted Roberts' ships and turned \"Swallow\" as a ruse. \"Ranger\" departed in pursuit, commanded by James Skyrme. Once out of earshot of the other pirates, \"Swallow\" opened her gun ports and opened fire. Ten pirates were killed and Skyrme had his leg taken off by a cannonball, but he refused to leave the deck. Eventually, \"Ranger\" was forced to strike her colors and the surviving crew were captured.\n\nOn 10 February, \"Swallow\" returned to Cape Lopez and found \"Royal Fortune\" still there. On the previous day, Roberts had captured \"Neptune\", and many of his crew were drunk and unfit for duty just when he needed them most. At first, the pirates thought that the approaching ship was \"Ranger\" returning, but a deserter from \"Swallow\" recognized her and informed Roberts while he was breakfasting with Captain Hill, the master of \"Neptune\". As he usually did before action, he dressed himself in his finest clothes:\nThe pirates' plan was to sail past \"Swallow\", which meant exposing themselves to one broadside. Once past, they would have a good chance of escaping. However, the helmsman failed to keep \"Royal Fortune\" on the right course, and \"Swallow\" was able to approach to deliver a second broadside. Captain Roberts was killed by grapeshot, which struck him in the throat while he stood on the deck. Before his body could be captured by Ogle, Roberts's wish to be buried at sea was fulfilled by his crew, who weighed his body down and threw it overboard after wrapping it in his ship's sail. It was never found.\n\nRoberts's death shocked the pirate world, as well as the Royal Navy. The local merchants and civilians had thought him invincible, and some considered him a hero.\n\nAs recorded by Captain Charles Johnson regarding the articles of Bartholomew Roberts.\n\nThe battle continued for another two hours until \"Royal Fortune\"s mainmast fell and the pirates signaled for quarter. One member of the crew, John Philips, tried to reach the magazine with a lighted match to blow up the ship, but was prevented by two men. Only three pirates had been killed in the battle, including Roberts. A total of 272 men had been captured by the Royal Navy. Of these, 65 were black, and they were sold into slavery. The remainder were taken to Cape Coast Castle, apart from those who died on the voyage back. 54 were condemned to death, of whom 52 were hanged and two reprieved. Another twenty were allowed to sign indentures with the Royal African Company; Burl comments that they \"exchanged an immediate death for a lingering one\". Seventeen men were sent to the Marshalsea prison in London for trial, where some were acquitted and released.\n\nOf the captured pirates who told their place of birth, 42% were from Cornwall, Devon, and Somerset, and another 19% from London. There were smaller numbers from northern England and from Wales, and another quarter from a variety of countries including Ireland, Scotland, the West Indies, the Netherlands, and Greece. Roberts experienced problems with mutinous Irishmen early in his pirate career and was known to generally avoid recruiting Irishmen, to the extent that captured merchant sailors would sometimes affect an Irish accent to discourage Roberts from forcing them into his pirate crew.\n\nCaptain Chaloner Ogle was rewarded with a knighthood, the only British naval officer to be honoured specifically for his actions against pirates. He also profited financially, taking gold dust from Roberts' cabin, and he eventually became an admiral.\n\nThis battle proved a turning point in the war against the pirates, and many consider the death of Roberts to mark the end of the Golden Age of Piracy.\n\nMost of the information on Roberts comes from the book \"A General History of the Pyrates\", published a few years after Roberts' death. The original 1724 title page credits one Captain Charles Johnson as the author. (The book is often printed under the byline of Daniel Defoe on the assumption that \"Charles Johnson\" is a pseudonym, but there is no proof that Defoe is the author, and the matter remains in dispute.) Johnson devotes more space to Roberts than to any of the other pirates in his book, describing him as:\nAfter his exploits in Newfoundland, a state Governor from New England commented that \"one cannot with-hold admiration for his bravery and courage\". He hated cowardice, and when the crews of 22 ships in Trepassey harbour fled without firing a shot he was angry at their failure to defend their ships.\n\nRoberts was the archetypal pirate captain in his love of fine clothing and jewelry, but he had some traits unusual in a pirate, notably a preference for drinking tea rather than rum. He is often described as a teetotaler and a Sabbatarian, but there is no proof of this. He certainly disliked drunkenness while at sea, yet it appears that he drank beer. Ironically, Roberts' final defeat was facilitated by the drunkenness of his crew. The Sabbatarian claim arises from the fact that musicians were not obliged to play on the Sabbath – this may merely have been intended to ensure the musicians a day's rest, as they were otherwise obliged to play whenever the crew demanded. \n\nBlack Bart was not as cruel to prisoners as some pirates such as Edward Low, but did not treat them as well as did Samuel Bellamy, Howell Davis, or Edward England. Roberts sometimes gave gifts to cooperative captains and crews of captured ships, such as pieces of jewelry or items of captured cargo. He would sometimes ill-use prisoners if he felt that the crew demanded it, but:\nIn 1997, a book was published that theorized Bartholomew Roberts was a woman transvestite. It was argued that Roberts' corpse was thrown overboard to conceal this fact.\n\n\n\n\n"}

He was from the Shala tribe of Mitrovica. When the Axis powers occupied Kosovo in the 1940s, Kosovar-Albanians saw the chance to free themselves from Serb rule and collaborated with the Germans. Chetnik forces had been expelling and killing Albanians and the family of Bislim Bajgora had fled to Gjirokaster. When the Germans occupied Kosovo, the Albanians freely chose to serve in the German Army which surprised the Germans. Bislim Bajgora was offered by the DDR,to join the German military police and get a plot in Hamburg, and Bislim rejected it, and said that he will not accept it and he will fight for his country.\n\nThe Germans had for a long time been very interested in working the Trepca mines and when they seized it, they started producing zinc and lead for the army. When the German forces occupied Mitrovica, they were not attacked as the Albanians saw it as liberation fromm the chetnik-Serbian forces. The city was handed over to influential leaders such as Bislim Bajgora, Ahmet Selaci, Ukshin Kovaqica, etc. Bislim Bajgora had a good reputation among the Shala tribe and the region had a good, strategic location enabling a good defence. When the Germans occupied the city they asked for an authoritative character and the Albanians picked Bislim Bajgora to lead the liberation forces of Mitrovica thus the Germans, in need of an ally against the Serb, gave Albanians arms and training. \nImmediately, the Shala-tribe and the Germans began cooperating and they received help from one of the most educated Albanians named Xhafer Deva who ran the German-Albanian politics in the city. Bislim Bajgora and Xhafer Deva got along well and showed mutual respect. \nOn 21 April 1941, there was a gathering of the Albanian forces and the Germans at the \"Jadran\" hotel, where Xhafer Deva sought to station his political activities and the Germans approved of his request. Bislim Bajgora had now won full support from the Germans and was considered a good ally of Germany. He became an adjutant for Gunther Hausding, head of Gestapo, the German secret police. After the 21st of April the Germans opened up schools for Albanian language for the first time in 40 years Albanians were able to educate themselves. The tribes of Shala and Bajgora was given arms and they were enforced further by more recruits led by commander Ahmet Selaci and Pajazit Boletini (nephew of Isa Boletini).\nThe forces of the Balli Kombetar were mainly stationed in Mitrovica, but also among regions which were under control of Bislim Bajgora, Ukshin Kovaqica, Mehmet Gradica, Shaban Polluzha, Sylejman Viquterna, etc. The Balli Kombetar patrolled the city, keeping order but they mainly focused on guarding the borders of Greater Albania which the Germans had created for the first time since 1912.\n\nIn 1941, chetnik forces began burning houses and killing civilians in the Albanian village of in which Bislim Bajgora and his forces headed for the village in order to save Albanians. When they arrived, the Chetniks fled and the village was saved from further attacks. In 1943, during the chetnik occupation of Novi Pazar, Serbs killed Albanian and Bosniak civilians. The chetnik leaders were Žika Marković and Kosta Pećanac who encouraged the Serbian forces to burn houses, massacre civilians and plunder. Bislim Bajgora arrived in Novi Pazar with 200 fighters, along with Shaban Polluzha, who also had 200 fighters and many others. The list of commanders involved in the fighting was Mulla Iljas Broja, Miftar and Cen Bajraktari, Col Bajraktari, Ymer Fazlija, Isuf Gradica, Imer Selaci, Pajazit Boletini, Sadik Lutani, etc. The first commander to reach the town was Hysen Llakiqi from Polaci, Drenica. During the fight with the chetniks there were numerous casualties among the Albanian forces. The Balli Kombetar killed 163 Chetniks and captured the town of Novi Pazar.\n\nIn 1943 the Serb forces of Peć began committing war crimes against civilians to which the Albanians responded by sending their forces. The Serb casualties numbered 130 that day. The Serbian population of Kosovo, fearing revenge from the Albanian forces after the Chetnik war crimes against Albanians, began fleeing Kosovo. 40,000 Serbs fled to Italy, 30,000 to Germany and 25,000 to a Bulgarian peace-zone. The total amount of Serbs who fled Kosovo was 100,000. During the war, Albanians were given jobs, arms and schools were opened for the first time in several decades. Albanians were free from Serbian fascist rule and Kosovo was united with Albania as it was planned in 1912.\n\nBajgora was one of the leaders of the ONDSH (Albanian National Democratic Organization), an anti-communist and nationalist league founded in 1945 to oppose Kosovo returning under Yugoslav rule. After guerrilla fights against chetnik forces, winter came and Bislim Bajgora and his men were forced to find shelter. Some of the fighters chose the village of Lupq in Llap where they hid in a bunker. They were discovered by spies who reported them to the Yugoslav forces. On 1 March 1947, they were surrounded. The Yugoslav forces consisted of Albanians and they did not want to open fire against the Balli Kombetar and one commander approached them and asked if they would surrender their weapons in peace. Bislim Bajgora and his friends answered \"Back away from the frontline because we did not gather arms only to surrender them!\". After the fighting the Yugoslav casualties numbered 350. The surviving friends of Bislim Bajgora took his body away and buried it nearby. His grave remains unknown to this very day.\n\nAfter the war, Albanians from Kosovo and Mitrovica were expelled to Turkey. The family of Rashit Bajgora, relative of Bislim Bajgora, had fled to Turkey in 1914. The family of Nuh Bajgora, also relative, had fled to Turkey in 1921. The only remaining relative of Bislim Bajgora was Sar Bajgora. After 100 years, in 2014, a forgotten relative of the family, Tuncay Baygora from Istanbul, returned to Kosovo to visit the remaining places of his family. Tuncay also met up with Miradije Bajgora Shala, the daughter of Bislim Bajgora.\n\nBislim Bajgora is said to have been one of the greatest Albanian riflemen. He was tall, well-built and often wore his Albanian national costume. \nToday he is a venerated symbol of Albanians in Mitrovica and a he is celebrated as a hero. Recently, there was a book published by the Albanian author and professor Asllan Istrefi about the life of Bislim Bajgora.\n\n"}

{"id": "2016022", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2016022", "title": "Charles Melville Hays", "text": "Charles Melville Hays\n\nCharles Melville Hays (May 16, 1856 – April 15, 1912) was the president of the Grand Trunk Railway. He began working in the railroad business as a clerk at the age of 17 and quickly rose through the ranks of management to become the General Manager of the Wabash, St. Louis and Pacific Railway. He became Vice-President of that company in 1889 and remained as such until 1896 when he became General Manager of the Grand Trunk Railway (GTR) of Canada.\n\nHays left GTR for a short time to serve as the President of the Southern Pacific Railway Company but returned to GTR after one year. As Vice-President and General Manager of GTR he is credited with keeping the company from bankruptcy. In 1909, he became the president of GTR and all its consolidated lines, subsidiary railroads, and steamship companies. He was known for his philanthropy and received the Order of the Rising Sun, third class, from the Emperor of Japan in 1907.\n\nHays is credited with the formation of the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway (GTP), a dream he had to create a second transcontinental railroad within the borders of Canada. He is also blamed for the insolvency of both the GTR and the GTP. He died before his dream was complete as he perished at sea in the sinking of the RMS \"Titanic\". Before the ship collided with an iceberg, Hays made a statement that was prophetic of the disaster. His body was recovered, and he was buried in Montreal. He was survived by his wife and four daughters.\n\nCharles Melville Hays was born in Rock Island, Illinois, on May 16, 1856. His family moved to St. Louis, Missouri, when he was a child.\n\nIn 1873, at the age of 17, he began his career in the railroad business working for the Atlantic and Pacific Railroad in St. Louis. From 1877 to 1884, Hays was Secretary to the General Manager of the Missouri Pacific Railroad. Beginning in 1884, he held the same position with the Wabash, St. Louis and Pacific Railway until 1886, when he became that company's General Manager. In 1889, he became Vice-President of the Wasbash Railroad and remained as such until 1896, when he became General Manager of the Grand Trunk Railway (GTR) of Canada.\n\nIn 1901, Hays left GTR to serve as the President of the Southern Pacific Railway Company but returned to the company in January 1902 as Vice-President and General Manager. In October 1909, he was appointed president of GTR, which also gave him control of its subsidiary railroad and steamship companies. These included the Central Vermont Railway, the Grand Trunk Western Railway, the Grand Haven and Milwaukee Railway, the Detroit and Toledo Shoreline Railroad, the Toledo, Saginaw and Muskegon Railway, the Southern New England Railway Company, the Canadian Express Company, and several others. In addition, he was sought after to help manage several philanthropies. He was Governor of the Royal Victoria Hospital, Montreal, Montreal General Hospital and McGill University. He received the Order of the Rising Sun, third class, from the Emperor of Japan in 1907 for assistance he gave the Imperial Government Railways.\n\nWhen Hays became General Manager of GTR in 1896, it was near bankruptcy and under-performing its rival, the Canadian Pacific Railway(CPR). On the advice of American financier J. Pierpont Morgan, the GTR board selected Hays as General Manager to bring more aggressive, \"American\" business practices to the company. He reorganized the management of the company and successfully negotiated running rights with CPR. He also brought more efficiency to the handling of accounts, built new track and ordered more powerful locomotives. These changes produced an era of greater success for the railroad.\n\nAt the time, the western prairies were being rapidly settled. Hays wanted to capitalize on the trend by constructing a transcontinental railroad, within the borders of Canada, to run 3,600 miles from Moncton, New Brunswick, to Prince Rupert, British Columbia. In 1900, he introduced a proposal to extend the lines of the Grand Trunk Western, an American subsidiary, from Chicago to Winnipeg, \"and thence to the Pacific.\" However, he was turned down by the railroad's directors in London. Later that year, Hays left GTR to work for Southern Pacific, but a change in ownership there lead to his resignation. He returned to the GTR to find that the president, Sir Charles Rivers Wilson, had convinced the Board of Directors to pursue the transcontinental railway. Meanwhile, the government, under Sir Wilfrid Laurier, had also decided to back the project. Plans to construct the transcontinental line were announced on November 24, 1902.\n\nHays' plan involved the creation of a subsidiary line from Winnipeg to Prince Rupert, with the government building the line from New Brunswick to Winnipeg. The cabinet became weary of Hays' demands for subsidies, but after negotiations between the government and Hays, aided by the railroad's president Rivers Wilson, the National Transcontinental Railway Act was passed in 1903. It enabled the incorporation of the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway (GTP). The government's portion of the line would be called the National Transcontinental Railway (NTR).\n\nThere were problems with some of Hays' policies regarding the GTP. \n\nHays made the construction of the mainline his priority, failing to develop feeder lines. CNoR and CPR joined forces to gain control of the prairie traffic. The competition among the three railroads led to Canada's ending up with three transcontinental railways instead of one. This was to result in the GTP's being starved of traffic; even though it was arguably the best of the three, it ultimately failed to attract enough freight to make it profitable.\n\nAfter construction on the GTP began in 1905, Hays started the Grand Trunk Pacific Development Company in order to purchase thousands of acres of land on which he established town sites along the route of the railway, including Melville, Saskatchewan, which was named after him. Hays' vision went beyond the building of the railway. He also had plans for a fleet of ocean liners and a string of resort hotels across the Rocky Mountains. He hired the famed architect Francis Rattenbury from CPR to design a grand hotel, the Château Prince Rupert, at the westernmost stop on the railway. In 1909, only 3000 people lived in Prince Rupert, but anticipation of the railroad caused it to grow rapidly, despite the rapidly rising cost of property and the muddy environs. The city was incorporated in 1910.\n\nAfter Rivers Wilson retired as the railroad's president in 1909, Hays was appointed to fill the position. By 1910, Grand Trunk union workers were demanding wages on par with those of railroad workers in the United States. A strike put a stop to construction. Hays finally gave into the workers' demands but failed to re-hire 250 previously-fired strikers despite promising to do so. He also denied workers their pensions, causing one member of Parliament to describe him as \"heartless, cruel, and tyrannical.\"\n\nBy 1912, the cost of constructing the railway was increasing, with rising wages and price increases on materials, while the government refused to allow a rate increase. Another reason for the mounting costs was Hays' insistence on \"building to the very highest standards\". Meanwhile, CNoR and CPR monopolized the traffic in the west. In addition, Grand Trunk, which would be leasing the NTR from the government, was responsible for paying back the construction cost of that line. Hays began to fear insolvency.\n\nIn April 1912, Hays was in London soliciting financial support for the GTP. He was anxious to get back to Canada for the opening of the Château Laurier in Ottawa, Ontario, named after Prime Minister Laurier. The gala opening of this hotel was set for April 25, 1912. Hays had also received news that his daughter Louise was having difficulty with her pregnancy.\n\nAdditionally, he might have had business with J. Bruce Ismay, chairman of the White Star Line; in any case, Ismay had invited Hays to join him on the RMS \"Titanic\". Hays, his wife, Clara, his daughter, Orian (see source note), his son-in-law, Thornton Davidson (son of Charles Peers Davidson), his secretary, Mr. Vivian Payne, and a maid, Miss Mary Anne Perreault, shared a deluxe suite (cabin B69) on B Deck, also known as the Bridge Deck.\n\nAt 11:40 pm on April 14, 1912, \"Titanic\" struck an iceberg. Hays helped the women in his party into one of the ship's 20 lifeboats, but he, his son-in-law, and his secretary remained and perished when the ship sank, along with 1,500 other \"Titanic\" passengers and crew. Hays was reported to have made a prophetic remark on the evening of the disaster; deploring the way the steamship lines were competing to win passengers with ever-faster vessels, he is said to have commented, \"The time will come soon when this trend will be checked by some appalling disaster.\"\n\nOne source, Hacking, names the daughter with Hays on the \"Titanic\" as \"Margaret,\" but it was his daughter, Orian, who was traveling with her husband, Thorton Davidson. That source does not mention Orian as a passenger on the ship. There was a 24-year-old woman, Margaret Bechstein Hays, on the \"Titanic\", but she was staying in a different compartment from the C.M. Hays party with another group of people. She escaped via lifeboat No. 7 (with her Pomeranian, \"Lady\"), while the other Hays women boarded lifeboat No. 3. Early newspaper reports said that Clara and Margaret Hays, and Mrs. Thornton [Orian] Davidson disembarked the rescue ship in New York City together and boarded a train for Montreal, but other sources say that Margaret Hays lived in New York and took care of two young child survivors (Edmond and Michael Navratil), who were unclaimed immediately following the disaster. Margaret (Hays) Easton's 1913 wedding announcement says her father, Frank Hays, walked her down the aisle. Finally, Orian's death notice lists Marjorie (Mrs. George Hall), not Margaret Easton, as a predeceased sister.\n\nHays' body was recovered from the waters of the North Atlantic by the \"Minia\", and he was buried at Mount Royal Cemetery in Montreal. Two funerals were held for him on May 8, one at the American Presbyterian Church in Montreal, the other in London at the Church of St Edmund, King and Martyr\nHays died before he could see the GTP completed. He was eulogized as one of the greatest railwaymen in Canada, and work on the GTR was stopped for five minutes, on April 25, 1912, in his memory. The period in which Hays led the GTR was its most prosperous era.\n\nHowever, his policies led to the GTP's collapse in 1919. The company was placed in receivership, and the government seized GTR's stock. It was later alleged that Hays had deceived the company's London directors in 1903 by committing them to conditions in the railway's agreements with the Canadian government for the building of the GTP to which they did not agree. That scheme was blamed for the company's collapse.\n\nThe railroad car in which his body was transported back to Montreal is preserved at the Canadian Railway Museum, near Delson, Quebec. There is a statue of him in Prince Rupert, and the city of Melville, Saskatchewan, is named after him, as is the village of Haysport, British Columbia.\n\nHe was survived by his wife, Clara Jennings (née Gregg), whom he married in St. Louis, Missouri on October 13, 1881. They had four daughters: Orian (Mrs. Thornton Davidson, Mrs. Robert N. Hickson), Clara (Mrs. Hope Scott), Marjorie (Mrs. George Hall), and Louise (Mrs. Grier).\n"}

{"id": "8486109", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8486109", "title": "Eocene–Oligocene extinction event", "text": "Eocene–Oligocene extinction event\n\nThe transition between the end of the Eocene (33.9 Ma) and the beginning of the Oligocene is marked by large-scale extinction and floral and faunal turnover (although minor in comparison to the largest mass extinctions). Most of the affected organisms were marine or aquatic in nature. They included the last of the ancient cetaceans, the Archaeoceti.\n\nThis was a time of major climatic change, especially cooling, not obviously linked with any single major impact or any catastrophic volcanic event. One cause of the extinction event is speculated to be extended volcanic activity. Another speculation is that the extinctions are related to several large meteorite impacts that occurred about this time. One such event caused the Chesapeake Bay impact crater (40 km), and another at the Popigai crater (100 km) of central Siberia, scattering debris perhaps as far as Europe. New dating of the Popigai meteor suggests it may be a cause of the mass extinction.\n\nA leading scientific theory on climate cooling at this time predicts a decrease in atmospheric carbon dioxide, which slowly declined in the mid to late Eocene and possibly reached some threshold approximately 34 million years ago. This boundary is closely linked with the Oligocene Oi-1 event, an oxygen isotope excursion that marks the beginning of ice sheet coverage on Antarctica.\n\nThe \"Grande Coupure\", or \"great break\" in continuity, with a major European turnover in mammalian fauna about 33.5 Ma, marks the end of the last phase of Eocene assemblages, the Priabonian, and the arrival in Europe of Asian species. The Grande Coupure is characterized by widespread extinctions and allopatric speciation in small isolated relict populations. It was given its name in 1910 by the Swiss palaeontologist Hans Georg Stehlin, to characterise the dramatic turnover of European mammalian fauna, which he placed at the Eocene-Oligocene boundary. A comparable turnover in Asian fauna has since been called the \"Mongolian Remodelling\".\n\nThe Grande Coupure marks a break between endemic European faunas before the break and mixed faunas with a strong Asian component afterwards. J. J. Hooker and his team summarized the break:\n\nIt has been suggested that this was caused by climate change associated with the earliest polar glaciations and a major fall in sea levels, or by competition with taxa dispersing from Asia. However, few argue for an isolated single cause. Other possible causes are related to the impact of one or more large bolides in northern hemisphere at Popigai, Toms Canyon and Chesapeake Bay. Improved correlation of northwest European successions to global events confirms the Grande Coupure as occurring in the earliest Oligocene, with a hiatus of about 350 millennia prior to the first record of post-Grande Coupure Asian immigrant taxa.\n\nAn element of the paradigm of the Grande Coupure was the apparent extinction of all European primates at the Coupure: the 1999 discovery of a mouse-sized early Oligocene omomyid, reflecting the better survival chances of small mammals, further undercut the Grand Coupure paradigm.\n\nEvidence in the world’s ocean current system indicates an abrupt cooling from 34.1 to 33.6 Ma across the Eocene–Oligocene boundary at 33.9 Ma. The remarkable cooling period in the ocean is correlated with pronounced mammalian faunal replacement within continental Asia as well. The Asian biotic reorganization events are comparable to the Grande Coupure in Europe and the Mongolian Remodeling of mammalian communities. The global cooling is also correlated with marked drying conditions in low-latitudes Asia.\n\n"}

Gun-related violence may or may not be considered criminal. Criminal violence includes homicide (except when and where ruled justifiable), assault with a deadly weapon, and suicide, or attempted suicide, depending on jurisdiction. Non-criminal violence includes accidental or unintentional injury and death (except perhaps in cases of criminal negligence). Also generally included in gun violence statistics are military or para-military activities.\n\nAccording to GunPolicy.org, 75 percent of the world's 875 million guns are civilian controlled. Roughly half of these guns (48 percent) are in the United States, which has the highest rate of gun ownership in the world. Globally, millions are wounded and killed by the use of guns. Assault by firearm resulted in 180,000 deaths in 2013 up from 128,000 deaths in 1990. There were additionally 47,000 unintentional firearm-related deaths in 2013.\n\nLevels of gun-related violence vary greatly among geographical regions, countries, and even subnationally. Rates of violent deaths by firearm range from as low as 0.03 and 0.04 per 100,000 population in Singapore and Japan, to 59 and 67 per 100,000 in Honduras and Venezuela. The highest rates of violent deaths by firearm in the world occur in low-income South and Central American countries such as Honduras, Venezuela, Colombia, El Salvador, Guatemala and Jamaica. The United States has the 11th highest rate of gun violence in the world, and by far the largest of any large or highly developed nation, having a gun homicide rate which is 25 times higher, an unintentional gun death rate which is 6 times higher, a firearm suicide rate which is 8 times higher, and an overall firearm death rate which is 10 times higher than the average respective rates of other high income nations. Compared to similarly wealthy nations with strict gun control laws, such as Japan, the United Kingdom, or South Korea, the United States has an overall rate of firearms death per capita, which is 50–100 times greater than many of its peers. The high rates of gun violence in the United States, which has the highest rate of gun-related deaths per capita among developed countries, despite having the highest number of police officers, is sometimes thought to be attributable to its extreme rate of gun ownership, as it is the only nation in which guns exceed people. Nearly all studies have found a positive association between gun ownership and gun-related homicide and suicide rates.\n\nAccording to the United Nations, deaths from small firearms exceed that of all other weapons combined, and more die each year from gun-related violence than did in the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki combined. The global death toll from use of guns may number as high as 1,000 dead each day.\n\nA number of ideas have been proposed on how to lessen the incidence of gun-related violence.\n\nSome propose keeping a gun at home to keep one safer. Studies show that guns in the home is associated with an increased risk of violent death in the home. According to the FBI, gun-related violence is linked to gun ownership and is not a function or byproduct of crime. Their study indicates that more than 90% of gun-related deaths were not part of a commission of a crime, rather they were directly related to gun ownership. \"Mother Jones\" reports that \"[a] Philadelphia study found that the odds of an assault victim being shot were 4.5 times greater if he carried a gun\" and that \"[h]is odds of being killed were 4.2 times greater\" when armed.Others propose arming civilians to counter mass shootings. FBI research shows that between 2000 and 2013, \"In 5 incidents (3.1%), the shooting ended after armed individuals who were not law enforcement personnel exchanged gunfire with the shooters.\" Another proposal is to expand self defense laws for cases where a person is being aggressed upon, although \"those policies have been linked to a 7 to 10% increase in homicides\" (that is, shootings where self-defense cannot be claimed).\n\nThere is a strong relationship between guns in the home, as well as access to guns more generally, and suicide risk, the evidence for which is strongest in the United States. A 1992 case-control study conducted in Tennessee and Washington found that individuals in a firearm owning home are close to five times more likely to commit suicide than those individuals who do not own firearms. A 2002 study found that access to guns in the home was associated with an increased risk of suicide among middle-aged and older adults, even after controlling for psychiatric illness. As of 2008, there were 12 case-control studies that had been conducted in the U.S., all of which had found that guns in the home were associated with an increased risk of suicide. However, a 1996 New Zealand study found no significant relationship between household guns and suicide. Assessing data from 14 developed countries where gun ownership levels were known, the Harvard Injury Control Research Center found statistically significant correlations between those levels and suicide rates. However, the parallels were lost when data from additional nations was included. A 2006 study found a significant effect of changes in gun ownership rates on gun suicide rates in multiple Western countries. During the 1980s and 1990s, the rate of adolescent suicides with guns caught up with adult rates, and the 75-and-older rate rose above all others. The use of firearms in suicides ranges from less than 10 percent in Australia to 50 percent in the United States, where it is the most common method and where suicides outnumber homicides 2-to-1. Those whoe purchased a firearm where found to be high risk for suicide within a week of the purchase The United States has both the highest number of Suicides and Gun ownerships for a developed country and firearms are the most popular method to commit suicide. In the United States when Gun ownerships rise so too does suicide by firearm. Suicide can be an impulsive act, 40% of those who survived a suicide attempt said that they only considered suicide up to five minutes before attempting the act. This impulsivity can lead to the use of a firearm as it is seen as a quick and lethal method.\n\nAccording to U.S. criminologist Gary Kleck, studies that try to link gun ownership to victimology often fail to account for the presence of guns owned by other people. Research by economists John Lott of the U.S. and John Whitley of Australia indicates that safe-storage laws do not appear to affect juvenile accidental gun-related deaths or suicides. In contrast, a 2004 study led by Daniel Webster found that such laws were associated with slight reductions in suicide rates among children. The same study criticized Lott and Whitley's study on the subject for inappropriately using a Tobit model. A committee of the U.S. National Research Council said ecological studies on violence and firearms ownership provide contradictory evidence. The committee wrote: \"[Existing] research studies and data include a wealth of descriptive information on homicide, suicide, and firearms, but, because of the limitations of existing data and methods, do not credibly demonstrate a causal relationship between the ownership of firearms and the causes or prevention of criminal violence or suicide.\"\n\nThe United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) defines intentional homicide as \"acts in which the perpetrator intended to cause death or serious injury by his or her actions.\" This excludes deaths: related to conflicts (war); caused by recklessness or negligence; or justifiable, such as in self-defense or by law enforcement in the line of duty. A 2009 report by the Geneva Declaration using UNODC data showed that worldwide firearms were used in an average of 60 percent of all homicides. In the U.S. in 2011, 67 percent of homicide victims were killed by a firearm: 66 percent of single-victim homicides and 79 percent of multiple-victim homicides. In 2009, the United States' homicide rate was reported to be 5.0 per 100,000. A 2016 Harvard study claims that in 2010 the homicide rate was about 7 times higher than that of other high-income countries, and that the US gun homicide rate was 25.2 times higher. Another Harvard study found that higher gun availability was strongly correlated with higher homicide rates across 26 high-income countries. Access to guns is associated with an increased risk of being the victim of homicide. Access to firearms is not the sole contributor to increased homicide rates, however, as one study by the Southern Criminal Justice Association in 2011 found. Equally important seems to be the particular societal conditions in a given area, socio-culturally. These conditions include, but are not limited to societal age structure, economic inequality, cultural symbolism associated with firearms and the cultural value of individual life. \n\nSome gun control advocates say that the strongest evidence linking availability of guns to death and injury is found in domestic violence studies, often referring to those by public health policy analyst Arthur Kellermann. In response to suggestions by some that homeowners would be wise to acquire firearms for protection from home invasions, Kellermann investigated in-home homicides in three cities over five years. He found that the risk of a homicide was in fact slightly higher in homes where a handgun was present. The data showed that the risk of a crime of passion or other domestic dispute ending in a fatal injury was higher when a gun was readily available (essentially loaded and unlocked) compared to when no gun was readily available. Kellerman said this increase in mortality overshadowed any protection a gun might have deterring or defending against burglaries or invasions. He also concluded that further research of domestic violence causes and prevention are needed.\n\nCritics of Kellermann's study say that it is more directly a study of domestic violence than of gun ownership. Gary Kleck and others dispute the work. Kleck says that few of the homicides that Kellermann studied were committed with guns belonging to the victim or members of his or her household, and that it was implausible that victim household gun ownership contributed to their homicide. Instead, according to Kleck, the association that Kellermann found between gun ownership and victimization reflected that people who live in more dangerous circumstances are more likely to be murdered, but also were more likely to have acquired guns for self-protection.\n\nIn studies of nonfatal gun use, it was found that guns can contribute to coercive control, which can then escalate into chronic and more severe violence. Guns can have a negative impact on victims even without being discharged. Threats of gun use or showing a weapon can create damaging and long-lasting fear and emotional stress in victims because they are aware of the danger of having an abuser who has access to a gun.\n\nThe United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime defines robbery as the theft of property by force or threat of force. Assault is defined as a physical attack against the body of another person resulting in serious bodily injury. In the case of gun-related violence, the definitions become more specific and include only robbery and assault committed with the use of a firearm. Firearms are used in this threatening capacity four to six times more than firearms used as a means of protection in fighting crime. Hemenway's figures are disputed by other academics, who assert there are many more defensive uses of firearms than criminal uses. See John Lott's \"More Guns, Less Crime\".\n\nIn terms of occurrence, developed countries have similar rates of assaults and robberies with firearms, whereas the rates of homicides by firearms vary greatly by country.\n\nFrom 1979 to 1997, almost 30,000 people in the United States alone died from accidental firearm injuries. A disproportionately high number of these deaths occurred in parts of the United States where firearms are more prevalent.\n\nViolence committed with guns leads to significant public health, psychological, and economic costs.\n\nThe economic cost of gun-related violence in the United States is $229 billion a year, meaning a single murder has average direct costs of almost $450,000, from the police and ambulance at the scene, to the hospital, courts, and prison for the murderer. A 2014 study found that from 2006 to 2010, gun-related injuries in the United States cost $88 billion.\n\nAssault by firearm resulted in 180,000 deaths worldwide in 2013, up from 128,000 deaths worldwide in 1990. There were 47,000 unintentional firearm deaths worldwide in 2013.\n\nEmergency medical care is a major contributor to the monetary costs of such violence. It was determined in a study that for every firearm death in the United States for the year beginning 1 June 1992, an average of three firearm-related injuries were treated in hospital emergency departments.\n\nChildren exposed to gun-related violence, whether they are victims, perpetrators, or witnesses, can experience negative psychological effects over the short and long terms. Psychological trauma also is common among children who are exposed to high levels of violence in their communities or through the media. Psychologist James Garbarino, who studies children in the U.S. and internationally, found that individuals who experience violence are prone to mental and other health problems, such as post-traumatic stress disorder and sleep deprivation. These problems increase for those who experience violence as children.\n\nGun violence in the United States results in tens of thousands of deaths and injuries annually. In 2013, there were 73,505 nonfatal firearm injuries (23.2 injuries per 100,000 U.S. citizens), and 33,636 deaths due to \"injury by firearms\" (10.6 deaths per 100,000 U.S. citizens). These deaths consisted of 11,208 homicides, 21,175 suicides, 505 deaths due to accidental or negligent discharge of a firearm, and 281 deaths due to firearms use with \"undetermined intent\". Of the 2,596,993 total deaths in the US in 2013, 1.3% were related to firearms. The ownership and control of guns are among the most widely debated issues in the country.\n\nIn 2010, 67% of all homicides in the U.S. were committed using a firearm. In 2012, there were 8,855 total firearm-related homicides in the US, with 6,371 of those attributed to handguns. In 2012, 64% of all gun-related deaths in the U.S. were suicides. In 2010, there were 19,392 firearm-related suicides, and 11,078 firearm-related homicides in the U.S. In 2010, 358 murders were reported involving a rifle while 6,009 were reported involving a handgun; another 1,939 were reported with an unspecified type of firearm.\n\nFirearms were used to kill 13,286 people in the U.S. in 2015, excluding suicide. Approximately 1.4 million people have been killed using firearms in the U.S. between 1968 and 2011, equivalent to a top 10th largest U.S. city in 2016, falling between the populations of San Antonio and Dallas, Texas.\n\nCompared to 22 other high-income nations, the U.S. gun-related murder rate is 25 times higher. Although it has half the population of the other 22 nations combined, the U.S. had 82 percent of all gun deaths, 90 percent of all women killed with guns, 91 percent of children under 14 and 92 percent of young people between ages 15 and 24 killed with guns. In 2010, gun violence cost U.S. taxpayers approximately $516 million in direct hospital costs.\n\nGun violence is most common in poor urban areas and frequently associated with gang violence, often involving male juveniles or young adult males. Although mass shootings have been covered extensively in the media, mass shootings in the US account for a small fraction of gun-related deaths and the frequency of these events steadily declined between 1994 and 2007, rising between 2007 and 2013.\n\nLegislation at the federal, state, and local levels has attempted to address gun violence through a variety of methods, including restricting firearms purchases by youths and other \"at-risk\" populations, setting waiting periods for firearm purchases, establishing gun buyback programs, law enforcement and policing strategies, stiff sentencing of gun law violators, education programs for parents and children, and community-outreach programs. Despite widespread concern about the impacts of gun violence on public health, Congress has prohibited the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) from conducting research that advocates in favor of gun control. The CDC has interpreted this ban to extend to all research on gun violence prevention, and so has not funded any research on this subject since 1996.\n\nThe Port Arthur massacre of 1996 horrified the Australian public. The gunman opened fire on shop owners and tourists, killing 35 people and wounding 23. This massacre, kick started Australia’s laws against guns. The Prime Minister at that time, John Howard, proposed a gun law that prevented the public from having all semi-automatic rifles, all semi-automatic and pump-action shotguns, in addition to a tightly restrictive system of licensing and ownership controls.\n\nThe government also bought back guns from people. In 1996–2003 it was estimated they bought back and destroyed nearly 1 million firearms. By the end of 1996, whilst Australia was still reeling from the Port Arthur massacre, the gun law was fully in place. Since then, the number of deaths related to gun-related violence dwindled almost every year. In 1979 six hundred and eighty-five people died due to gun violence, and in 1996 it was five hundred and sixteen. The numbers continue to drop, however they were declining also before the gun law was in place.\n\nOn the Australia's most mediated gun violence-related incident since Port Arthur, was the 2014 Sydney Hostage Crisis. On 15–16 December 2014, a lone gunman, Man Haron Monis, held hostage 17 customers and employees of a Lindt chocolate café. The perpetrator was on bail at the time, and had previously been convicted of a range of offences.\n\nThe following year in August, the New South Wales Government tightened the laws of bail and illegal firearms, creating a new offence for the possession of a stolen firearm, with a maximum of 14 years imprisonment.\n\nSweden witnessed a steep increase in gun violence in males aged 15 to 29 in the two decades prior to 2018, in addition to a rising trend in gun violence there was also a high rate of gun violence in Sweden compared to other countries in Western Europe. According to a report published by academic researchers in 2017, shooting incidents with fatal outcomes are about 4 to 5 times as common in Sweden compared to neighbouring countries such as Germany and Norway when taking population size into account. The city with the highest prevalence of shootings was Malmö. The grave violence in the studied period also changed character, from criminal motorcycle gangs to city suburbs.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2977808", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2977808", "title": "HMS Affray (P421)", "text": "HMS Affray (P421)\n\nHMS \"Affray\", a British \"Amphion\"-class submarine, was the last Royal Navy submarine to be lost at sea, on 16 April 1951, with the loss of 75 lives. All vessels of her class were given names beginning with the letter A; she was the only ship of the Royal Navy to be named after a particularly noisy and disorderly fight.\n\n\"Affray\" was built in the closing stages of the Second World War. She was one of 16 submarines of her class which were originally designed for use in the Pacific Ocean against Japan.\n\nShe was laid down at the Cammell Laird yard in Birkenhead on 16 January 1944, launched on 12 April and commissioned on 25 November 1945. \"Affray\" and her sisters were state-of-the-art submarines at the time of their launching. They were the culmination of a rapid submarine development driven by the Second World War. Some elements of her design were taken from captured Nazi German U-boats. Her modular style of manufacture and all-welded hull were unique at the time. For work in the Far East she was equipped with refrigeration and two huge air conditioners, and all her accommodation was placed as far away from the engine room as possible. She also had ten torpedo tubes which made her and her class some of the most formidable submarines in the world at that time.\n\nShe was sent to the submarine tender HMS \"Montclare\" at Rothesay, as part of the 3rd Submarine Flotilla, before joining her sisters HMS \"Amphion\", \"Astute\", \"Auriga\", \"Aurochs\" and the submarine tender HMS \"Adamant\" in the British Pacific Fleet. The following four years \"Affray\" was on travel and took part in exercises all over the globe, visiting such places as Australia, Singapore, Japan, Morocco, South Africa, Pearl Harbor and Bergen.\n\nOn 11 March 1949 she was transferred to the 5th Submarine Flotilla reserve and entered drydock to be retrofitted with a snort mast (snorkel device)—a pneumatically raised and lowered steel tube which, when in the vertical position, worked as an air induction/exhaust emission device. Once vertical it was self-locking and drew air into the submarine at periscope depth, permitting the submarine to charge batteries and run diesels for propulsion below the surface, allowing the sub to remain underwater. At the point where the air intake entered the pressure hull of the submarine there was a bulbous casting—set about half a metre above the hull, this housed the main induction valve. This very important casing was totally concealed and protected by the free flooding hull. The snort mast on the \"Affray\" was designed for both air intake and exhaust venting; this was later changed so the snort mast was an air intake only and the exhaust was moved to the rear of the conning tower. The snort mast had a float valve that would close automatically if the submarine dropped below periscope depth. In December of that same year \"Affray\" was sent to the Mediterranean; it was recorded during deep dives in this sea that she began \"leaking like a sieve\" and that the Admiralty class diesels started leaking oil.\n\nIn January 1951 \"Affray\" was transferred to Portsmouth Naval base to join Reserve group \"G\". In March she was brought out of reserve and Lieutenant John Blackburn DSC was appointed CO and given the task of bringing her and the new crew up to operational status.\n\nOn 16 April 1951, \"Affray\" set out on a simulated war mission called Exercise \"Spring Train\" with a reduced crew of 50 from 61. They were joined by one sergeant, one corporal, and two marines from the Special Boat Service; a commander (Engineer), a naval instructor, seven lieutenants in the engineering branch, and 13 sub-lieutenants. The last two groups were undergoing essential submarine officer training. This made her complement 75 in total. Her captain's orders were unusually flexible: the Marines were to be dropped off somewhere along the south west coast of England—the captain told the Admiralty he had chosen an isolated beach in Cornwall—come ashore and return under the cover of darkness. The exercise was expected to continue until \"Affray\" was due to return to base on 23 April for essential defect repairs including a leak in a battery tank. \"Affray\" left her home base at about 1600 hrs, and made normal contact to confirm position, course, speed etc at 2100 hrs, and indicated she was preparing to dive. The last ship to see her on the surface was the 'Co' Class destroyer HMS \"Contest\" returning to Portsmouth that evening. As they passed each other, both vessels piped the side. When she missed her 0800 report due the next day she was declared missing and an immediate search began.\n\nShore stations called \"Affray\" all day and HMS \"Agincourt\" led a fleet of search vessels which eventually totalled 24 ships from four nations. The Portland 2nd Training Flotilla which included HMS \"Tintagel Castle\", \"Flint Castle\", , and ASDIC (sonar) trials vessel \"Helmsdale,\" left Portland. Also out of Portland, they were joined by the submarines HMS \"Scorcher\", \"Scythian\", and \"Sirdar\" all flying large white flags to distinguish them from the missing \"Affray\". \"Sirdar\" later sat on the bottom for six hours while the ASDIC boats familiarised themselves with the identification of a submarine sitting on the bottom. The codeword 'SUBMISS' was sent to all ships in the NATO navies to notify them of the fact the \"Affray\" was missing and all other \"Amphion\"-class boats were confined to port pending investigation as to what happened to their missing sister. At the time \"Affray\" went missing it was such big news in Britain it relegated the first events that culminated in the Suez Crisis to page two of the national newspapers. There was some urgency in the initial 48 hours of the search as it was estimated the crew would not survive much longer than this if they had survived whatever had sunk the submarine in the first place. During the search a Morse code signal (via tapping on the submarine hull) had been received by two of the searching ships, reading \"We are trapped on the bottom\", but this did not help in locating the sub. After three days the search was slowed down and fewer ships were used to locate \"Affray\". In Britain, the missing submarine was getting a lot of publicity. Rumours abounded of mutiny, and even seizure by the Russians. Meanwhile the Royal Navy continued its search. During the search many strange things happened. The strangest was a massive object found on the bottom by sonar; the search vessel, realising it could not have been \"Affray\" owing to its size, continued on—when it returned several days later to establish what it was, it had gone. Another strange event was that the wife of a skipper of one of \"Affray\"'s sister submarines claiming to have seen a ghost in a dripping wet submarine officer's uniform telling her the location of the sunken sub (this position later turned out to be correct)— she recognised him as an officer who had died during the Second World War, not a crew member of \"Affray\". As there were so many shipwrecks littering the English Channel (161 were found, most of them sunk during the Second World War), it was almost two months before \"Affray\" was located.\n\nOn 14 June the primary search vessel HMS \"Loch Insh\" made a sonar contact near Hurds Deep, a deep underwater valley in the English Channel. It was the same location where an oil slick had been sighted at the same time \"Affray\" vanished and was in an area that had been searched before. HMS \"Reclaim\" arrived several hours later after an excited call from the Captain of \"Loch Insh\" who, as an ex-submariner, was convinced this was \"Affray\". A dive was made down to the contact and the diver reported seeing a long white handrail before being dragged along with the flow of the current. Due to the weather being worse than usual the crew decided to use the underwater camera that they had previously been skeptical of. As soon as it was sent down the very first thing the camera picked up were the letters \"YARFFA\"—\"Affray\" backwards. At last she had been found. She was northwest of Alderney, a lot closer to France than England. She lay slightly to port facing northeast in 86 metres of water, and during the next few months she slid a little more to port where she appears to have rested on a roughly 50 degree angle. Divers could find no evidence of collision or damage to the hull, casing or bridge and it was noted that the search periscope and ANF radar mast were extended, indicating she had been at periscope depth when she foundered. However the snort mast had been broken and lay next to the sub attached by only a thin shred of metal. The hatches and torpedo doors were all shut and the two emergency buoys were still located within the casing, although the after one could not have been released as the hinged wooden gratings retaining it had been wired shut (sadly, it was later discovered that it had been wired shut because it often broke free whilst the sub was underway). It was obvious that no attempt to escape had been made. The only external clue that the crew had done anything to rectify their dilemma was the bow hydroplanes being set to hard arise; the bridge telegraphs also were in the stop position. The snort mast was the only part of the submarine that was recovered, and it was later found to be of faulty manufacture. This may have contributed to the sinking of \"Affray\" (see below).\n\nThere have been many reasons put forward as to what caused the submarine to sink. The snort mast was broken and lay next to the hull so initially it was thought that this had broken and flooded the submarine. After a detailed inspection of the snort mast itself, which showed no sign of being struck, it was thought that it was more likely that it had been broken when the sub hit the bottom (the snort mast was later tested and although it was found to be of faulty manufacture, tests indicated it should still have stood up to normal use). A battery explosion has also been suggested as a possibility. The Royal Navy had tried to scan the interior when \"Affray\" was first discovered using a primitive radioactive device. This yielded minimal information about the internal condition of the submarine, but it did seem to show that the internal valve for the snort mast was in the open position, which would indicate that at least one compartment flooded and some of the crew had drowned when she first hit the bottom (see USS \"Squalus\" for a similar situation). During this attempt one of the (pea-sized) X-ray pods was accidentally lost near the sub and the Admiralty decided against further attempts to establish why \"Affray\" sank, mostly due to the various dangers to any divers (one Royal Navy diver lost his life attempting to identify another sunken submarine during the search). A more recent theory put forward by a few experts is that the snort mast dropped below the surface and the float valve (described above) jammed or somehow failed to stop the water entering the sub. With up to 13 tons of water per minute entering the submarine this could have caused her to drop rapidly to the bottom. With a reduced crew and the trainees in the way hampering activities, there would have been a delay in stopping the inflow of water. By the time the valve was shut or the flooding compartment that contained the valve sealed off, there would have been so much water aboard that even blowing all her ballast would not have been sufficient to get her to the surface. Or if the flooded compartment/s included the control room, there would have been no one alive to blow ballast. It is also possible, with trainees on board possibly operating systems, that a problem with the clutch caused the \"Affray\" to accelerate into the sea bottom disabling some parts of the submarine that would have helped her rise to the surface.\n\nAlmost half a century after the loss, Innes McCartney, an experienced trimix diver with a passion for sunken submarines, obtained the position of \"Affray\" from the Ministry of Defence and dived to the sunken submarine. He reported:\n\nAs we descended down the shotline, a large dark shape emerged from the gloom. Little ambient light penetrates to 83 metres even on a good day on the edge of Hurd Deep and it was a while before we recognised the unmistakable shape of a submarine. She is a hugely impressive sight, sitting almost totally clear of a hard seabed, offering in excess of 10 metres of relief in places. Our lighting showed that she is now covered with sponges and anemones, offering some welcome colour in the darkness. The first thing that struck me about the wreck was her sheer size. She is one of the largest submarine wrecks in the Channel and a diver is hard pushed to swim all the way around her on a single dive. She lies slightly over on her port side, with her bows pointing Northeast. She is not very heavily netted with only a few craypots caught up around the hull. The wreck is in a very good state of preservation considering the 47 years she has been on the seabed. Her bridge is completely intact with speaking tubes, the projector binnacle and radio aerials all in evidence. On the side of the conning tower her navigation lights are present and the conning tower ladder is still in place. Her periscope shafts stand proudly upright and even the cables that ran between them are still there. Forward of the tower the foredeck is intact with the gun layers hatch clearly visible. I was keen to find the cradle in which the snort mast was located when in use. This was on the port side, aft of the tower and on our second dive on the wreck I found it. The base of the snort mast was still in place, with the area where the mast broke off clearly visible. On a later visit to the Royal Navy Submarine Museum, I saw the base of the section of the mast that was raised. They would still fit together perfectly. The fore and aft hydroplanes are still in position and the external torpedo tubes on the bow are a very impressive sight. Aft of the conning tower, there is evidence of the salvage attempts made by the Royal Navy in 1951. The diving team discovered no other damage to the wreck apart from the missing snort mast. This is in accordance with the findings of the Royal Navy's investigation. She remains a significant and salutary reminder of our naval heritage. Very few divers in the UK have the experience and capability to undertake such a dive. This should ensure that the \"Affray\" remains undisturbed for posterity. She is a war grave and the final resting place of 75 naval personnel and this should be respected.\n\nTo this day, the crew are entombed in the submarine on the northern edge of Hurd's Deep. As of 2001, under the Protection of Military Remains Act 1986, \"Affray\" was made a controlled site, making it illegal to dive her without a permit from the Ministry of Defence.\n\nAbbreviations used\n\n\n\n\nGallop, Alan: 'Subsmash - the Mysterious Disappearance of HMS Affray' published by The History Press, 2007\n\n"}

In 1870, his family moved to Kansas, where it settled in Clay County.\n\nBefore becoming active in politics, Allen acquired ownership of newspapers throughout Kansas, beginning in 1894 with the \"Manhattan Nationalist\" in Manhattan, Kansas. He owned the \"Topeka State Journal\" with Arthur J. Carruth Jr. and William P. Snyder. Generally forward-looking in his outlook, he hired Frank Lloyd Wright to design his home in Wichita, Kansas. Allen's home is the only residence designed by Wright in Kansas.\n\nAllen was in France with William Allen White inspecting the facilities provided to Kansas soldiers of the American Expeditionary Force during World War I when his party nominated him for the office of governor. During the campaign in 1918, Allen never spent any of his own money and learned about his nomination from a Paris newspaper. He served from 1919 to 1923.\n\nAllen expressed some admiration for Benito Mussolini's policies in the 1920s and pushed through a similar industrial court provision.

As the popularity of the game grew, the interest in Horseland spawned a new Junior Version, and later, a series of cartoons and short novels. In 2006, Horseland LLC partnered with DIC Entertainment to produce a cartoon TG4 based on the website.\n\nOn October 28, 2008 Horseland released a revamped website that includes an interactive 3D world with customizable horses and avatars. A new store sells clothing and tack for the avatars. A 3D interactive world was introduced that allows players to ride their horses and chat with other people. There are new interactive 3D jumping shows. Alongside these changes, Horseland introduced micro-transaction pay model through Horseland \"Coins\" which they sell through a variety of pay options. Horseland also offers a \"Premium Membership\" which unlocks exclusive features in the game.\n\nThe Horseland Jr. game was launched on September 1, 2006. This game featured characters from the Horseland cartoon. It was a very simplified version of Horseland World and suitable for kids younger than 13 years old. Graphics were simple and colorful, appealing to the younger audience. \nThe Junior game was a Flash based game similar to the World game in that players could create and interact with a virtual horse. Horseland Jr. let you select a horse (choosing from characters you'd also find in the Horseland cartoon series), pick the horse's name and the player name. Players could visit their horse in its stall, and care for it in a variety of ways (\"shown in the image on the right\"). The horse needed to be fed daily, exercised regularly, seen by a veterinarian and farrier, and fitted with tack.\n\nThere were simple jumping shows that players could enter for fun. During the holidays, Horseland released themed shows (e.g. Halloween, Christmas, Easter, etc.). There was a leaderboard showing the scores of the last 10 people who entered the show.\n\nIn December 2008 the \"Trail Ride\" was introduced. This gave players the ability to actually ride their horse around scenes from the Horseland cartoon and interact with other players, including making friends and chatting restricted to an option of phrases. (\"shown in the image on the right\"). Horseland Jr. players could upgrade to the Horseland World game with parental permission.\n\nThe Horseland Jr. game was closed in February 2009. Players under 13 are now given a \"Junior\" account in the main Horseland game. Junior accounts are COPPA Compliant. They can't send or receive private messages, and can't chat freely.\n\nThe original game on the Horseland website was renamed from \"Horseland\" to \"Horseland World\" on September 1, 2006 when the Jr. game was launched. It was renamed \"Horseland\" in February 2009 when the Jr. game was closed. In the Horseland game, players buy and sell horses, find good stables to board their horses at, find a fair trainer, chat with friends, and participate in horse shows and have a homepage.\n\nThere was some controversy among the players after the October 28, 2008 changes. The change in currency from HLD to HLC was one of them. The value of 1 HLC is different from the value of one old HLD, so prices across the game were changed to reflect the new value. Horseland also removed the ability for Basic Players (free-accounts) to get free money. Players now earn money by playing games.\n\nThe game also consists of a group of people who \"moderate\" the website and take action against players who act inappropriately or are cyber bullying other players. These players will have a badge beside their name. Whether they are active or not, you will have to see their status updates. If anyone has any concerns or even questions pertaining to the game, they can reach a mod, who then in turn can attempt to contact Horseland themselves.\n\nThe world is a place where players can meet, chat and roleplay in a virtual world. The world has several different servers to accommodate many players, with a variety of places to explore. It is monitored by \"moderators\" who are there to prevent harassment, vulgar language, etc. There are groups of players who have formed a roleplaying subgame within Horseland, creating their own characters and acting as their said characters either in the world or through messages with other players. Roleplayers usually act out the role of a wolf, cat or horse, with many being inspired by the Warriors book series by Erin Hunter. Roleplaying in the world is often illiterate, however through messages players tend to be more detailed and literate. \nEveryone is represented in the world by an avatar that's created when one signs up. These avatars can be modified somewhat to resemble the player. For example, you can change the hair, eye and skin color.However,you can't change your avatar's gender. If a player has the right amount of money, they can customize their horses and avatar with a variety of clothing and tack, which can be purchased from the store. (\"Picture of The World is shown on right.\")\n\nThe \"Horseland Outfitters\" shop sells tack and clothing to customize player and horse avatars. Tack can cost from 800 to 3750 coins, and clothing ranges from 530 to 4000 coins. Players may add multiple items to their cart and buy them all at once. They also sell horses and dogs for stables and kennels. All animals purchased at the shop are 3 years old. The price range is generally from 200 to about 350 coins. Players may buy crates and stalls for them. Also, shops sell food for players' animals, at a cost of 95 coins per bag of feed, which contains 100 daily servings for animals. \nHorseland is an escalating system of gameplay, where players strive to earn as many points as possible, both for their player account as well as their individual horses. Players earn points through the training of their horses or dogs. A single player can own many animals of varying breeds and descriptions. While there is no single point goal for their animals, the players are restricted by the trainable lifespan of their horses and dogs. While a horse or a dog can only participate in show training for a period of time, it can participate in ticket training its whole life. When an animal becomes too old for show training, it is offered the option of retirement. Most players do not retire their animals, as it creates \"broken lines\" where the horses' or dogs' records are wiped off the Horseland database and cannot be found again. However, horses can pass a portion of their earned points to their offspring if they breed before reaching retirement age, and thus an evolving system of gameplay continues through the lineage of the animals that players foster and maintain.\n\nPoints usually take time, depending on the points. The horse or dog must have all their checkups completed before they show.\n\nThere are 2 types of shows: Jumping Shows and Automatic Shows. Jumping Shows were added to the game in October 2008. Every player can start one show a week. The Jumping shows are flash based and interactive. A player literally maneuvers the horse around a jumping course using the arrow keys and space bar. The player receives the points immediately after he/she finishes the course. The owner of a jumping show designs the courses using different jumps and obstacles to design the classes in her show. The Automatic Shows are not interactive. In Automatic Shows, a player puts her horse on the list for a particular show then, over night, the winners of the show are randomly picked and points awarded.\n\nHorseland players can train their animals by \"Show Training\" or \"Ticket Training.\" Show Training involves players entering their horses or dogs in shows where points are awarded the next day. As their animals gain points, the user will also gain \"Player Points,\" which are equal to the number of points the animal gains. However, with every show, the animal's health bar decreases, limiting the number of shows a horse or dog can enter.\n\nThe other method, Ticket Training, is through the use of tickets that Premium players can purchase at the online store. One training ticket gives a horse or dog 30 points, without it affecting the animal's health. These tickets may be used on a player's own animals, or the player may choose to sell it as a service to other players. As it is a player-operated service, ticket prices can fluctuate depending on the seller. Horse tickets were removed from the game in October 2008, and re-introduced in January 2009.\n\nSome players offer a service referred to as \"point training\". What they will do is train a horse/dog using one of the above methods to \"x\" amount of points for \"x\" amount of money. Generally, hiring other players to do such a thing will be more expensive than doing so personally.\n\nBreeding is an important part of the Horseland World game, through which a player can extend the capability of an animal to earn more points by passing a portion of the points earned by ancestors on to their offspring, giving that foal a higher starting point level.\n\nPlayers can choose to breed among their own horses or with horses owned by others. The owners of the stallions control the breeding by having the option to accept or reject a \"breed request\" by another player. Mares can be bred once every 21 days, and stallions every 2 days (both from the age of 3 until the age of 21).\n\nBreeding is tracked by the game, listing all ancestors of a horse still in play. Once retired, however, the information for that horse (name, age, points etc.) is lost and the offspring of that horse will lose that portion of their lineage and have what is referred to as a \"broken line\". Most players become very attentive to the tracking of blood-lines, so they often choose to not retire their horses.\n\nCrossbreeds (aka CB) are two different breeds that were bred together.\n\nOverbred (aka OB) means that the horse/dog has a large number of offspring.\n\nInbred (aka IB) means that one horse/dog is in the pedigree more than once.\n\nBroken-Lined (aka BL) means that the horse/dog's parents, grandparents, great grandparents, etc.,cannot be found.\n\nA horse that is either inbred, overbred, or both, is generally frowned upon. A horse or dog is less likely to be bought if this applies to it.\n\nGraphics are modified pictures and \"layouts\" designed by graphic makers. A layout is usually a manipulated image with the player's name and ID number on it, with text boxes for writing any information about the player and their services. Layouts require knowledge of HTML and photo-manipulation, often resulting in large sums of money being paid to the graphic maker. They are a popular and satisfying way of keeping homepages neat and interesting. These can be simple or complex, depending on the player's budget and needs. Graphic makers range from beginners who are experimenting with novice programs, to more experienced people using programs such as Gimp or Photoshop. People often have layout contests in which they offer a large sum of money to the winners. They choose the layout they like best and pay that person. They can also buy other layouts they like and award other prizes.\n\nThe economic system in Horseland evolved into a free, open market by players, originally beginning with the buying and selling of horses and items included by the Horseland game system, and eventually including services offered by the players themselves, such as home page design and artwork.\n\nPlayers use \"Coins\" to buy most things in the game. Coins can be earned by playing mini-games, or purchased for real money. Horseland also offers a \"Premium Membership\". Premium Players are given a weekly income of 3,500 Coins and access to exclusive features like forum avatars & signatures, featured listing in search results, dog training tickets, themed jumping shows, and the previously standard 100 classes/show.\n\nThough the game itself requires players to purchase automated services, such as veterinary visits to maintain the health of their animals, elective services, such as the boarding of animals in privately owned stables and kennels, are handled by the players themselves.\n\nHorseland allows players to dictate the price of their services and creates a natural division of labor, as some players elect to specialize their gameplay, by being \"trainers\" or \"boarders\", for example. The ability of open discussion on the Horseland Forum pages lends itself to players looking for and advertising services offered for players by players, and fosters a fluctuating open market.\n\nIn addition to being a simulation game, Horseland also has many attributes of a social network. A great deal of Horseland's social network centers around user-generated content. Each player has a homepage that s/he can alter with HTML or CSS. Players often create and \"sell\" design codes for homepages, turning the code over to other players in exchange for coins. \"Professional\" (a.k.a. \"pro\") photographs and illustrations for horses and dogs are also exchanged between players.\nPlayers can communicate with each other through flash-based chat rooms, in-game messages, personal blogs, forums and the flash-based 3D world. An additional feature of the game are lists of \"Friends\" which highlight each friend's last status or activity in the game. Players can send digital cards (sometimes called \"Love/Luff Cards\") to their friends (the occasion for this can vary, from birthdays to holidays).\nUnofficial clubs are popular. Players create their own clubs through creating a new account. (Note: this is different from the official Horseland Clubs.) These clubs are run in a similar way to a \"official\" Horseland Club: they hold contests, gather members, create logos (called \"club cards\"), and propagate campaigns.\nPlayers can also run in Horseland \"Official\" sponsored clubs. Becoming the \"President\" of a club allows a players to control animals that are accepted and rejected from the club. The \"President\" sets their own registry for the club for their term, each term lasts for one month. Players campaign to become \"President\" by TV'ing (trading votes) with other premium players. Often players hold voting contests in hopes of luring other players to help them gain enough votes to win in the club. Players can also \"buy\" votes off of other players who do not want to trade their votes. This is sometimes a controversial topic, as players can become presidents simply by \"bribing\" other players with a lot of money, instead of voting for a more ideal president.\n\n"}

Harding. He was born in Toledo, Ohio. His father was Champion Tintern Tip Top. He was presented to US President Warren G. Harding by Charles Quetschke of Caswell Kennels and became a celebrity during the Harding administration.\n\nLaddie Boy was a faithful dog. When the president played golf and hit a tree, Laddie Boy would run up to the tree and retrieve the ball. Laddie Boy had his own hand carved chair to sit in during Cabinet meetings. The White House held birthday parties for the dog, invited other neighborhood dogs to join, and served them dog biscuit cake. Newspapers published mock interviews with the dog. Laddie Boy was so famous, he even had a caretaker.\n\nHe was the first \"First Dog\" to be regularly covered in the national press.\nHarding and his wife Florence shared a love of animals and the First Lady, also an advocate for the care of abused and neglected animals, soon began employing this handsome dog as a poster child for the national promotion of animal rights issues.\n\nPurportedly, the dog howled constantly for three days prior to President Harding's death in August 1923 at the Palace Hotel in San Francisco, knowing of his master's imminent demise. In memory of President Harding and honoring his former employment as a paperboy, newsboys collected 19,134 pennies to be remelted and sculpted into a statue of Laddie Boy. Harding's widow died before the statue was completed in 1927 and the statue was presented to the Smithsonian Institution. Harding's death and the dog were commemorated in song.\n\nAfter the president’s death in 1923, Florence Harding gave the Airedale to Harry Barker, her favorite Secret Service agent. She knew her poor health wouldn’t allow her to look after the dog properly. Harry took Laddie home to his family in Boston, and the dog lived a very normal life and was much loved by the Barker family. Laddie’s death in 1929 was proclaimed in newspaper headlines across the country.\n\nIn the summer of 2012, Laddie Boy's unique collar, fashioned from Alaskan gold nuggets, was stolen from the Harding Home and Museum.\n\n\n"}

On the basis of his collection of cases, Moody identified a common set of elements in NDEs:\n\n\"Life After Life\" sold more than 13 million copies, was translated into a dozen foreign languages and became an international best seller, which made the subject of NDEs popular and opened the way for many other studies.\n\nMoody expected to be criticized, and of course he was. Some scientists have written that Moody's alleged evidence for an afterlife is flawed, logically and empirically. The psychologist James Alcock has noted that \"[Moody] appears to ignore a great deal of the scientific literature dealing with hallucinatory experiences in general, just as he quickly glosses over the very real limitations of his research method.\"\n\nThe philosopher Paul Kurtz has written that Moody's evidence for the NDE is based on personal interviews and anecdotal accounts and there has been no statistical analyses of his data. According to Kurtz \"there is no reliable evidence that people who report such experiences have died and returned, or that consciousness exists separate from the brain or body.\"\n\n"}
{"id": "183290", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=183290", "title": "Life extension", "text": "Life extension\n\nLife extension is the idea of extending the human lifespan, either modestly – through improvements in medicine – or dramatically by increasing the maximum lifespan beyond its generally settled limit of 125 years. The ability to achieve such dramatic changes, however, does not currently exist.\n\nSome researchers in this area, and \"life extensionists\", \"immortalists\" or \"longevists\" (those who wish to achieve longer lives themselves), believe that future breakthroughs in tissue rejuvenation, stem cells, regenerative medicine, molecular repair, gene therapy, pharmaceuticals, and organ replacement (such as with artificial organs or xenotransplantations) will eventually enable humans to have indefinite lifespans (agerasia) through complete rejuvenation to a healthy youthful condition. The ethical ramifications, if life extension becomes a possibility, are debated by bioethicists.\n\nThe sale of purported anti-aging products such as supplements and hormone replacement is a lucrative global industry. For example, the industry that promotes the use of hormones as a treatment for consumers to slow or reverse the aging process in the US market generated about $50 billion of revenue a year in 2009. The use of such products has not been proven to be effective or safe.\n\nDuring the process of aging, an organism accumulates damage to its macromolecules, cells, tissues, and organs. Specifically, aging is characterized as and thought to be caused by \"genomic instability, telomere attrition, epigenetic alterations, loss of proteostasis, deregulated nutrient sensing, mitochondrial dysfunction, cellular senescence, stem cell exhaustion, and altered intercellular communication.\" Oxidation damage to cellular contents caused by free radicals is believed to contribute to aging as well.\n\nThe longest a human has ever been proven to live is 122 years, the case of Jeanne Calment who was born in 1875 and died in 1997, whereas the maximum lifespan of a wildtype mouse, commonly used as a model in research on aging, is about three years. Genetic differences between humans and mice that may account for these different aging rates include differences in efficiency of DNA repair, antioxidant defenses, energy metabolism, proteostasis maintenance, and recycling mechanisms such as autophagy.\n\nAverage lifespan in a population is lowered by infant and child mortality, which are frequently linked to infectious diseases or nutrition problems. Later in life, vulnerability to accidents and age-related chronic disease such as cancer or cardiovascular disease play an increasing role in mortality. Extension of expected lifespan can often be achieved by access to improved medical care, vaccinations, good diet, exercise and avoidance of hazards such as smoking.\n\nMaximum lifespan is determined by the rate of aging for a species inherent in its genes and by environmental factors. Widely recognized methods of extending maximum lifespan in model organisms such as nematodes, fruit flies, and mice include caloric restriction, gene manipulation, and administration of pharmaceuticals. Another technique uses evolutionary pressures such as breeding from only older members or altering levels of extrinsic mortality.\nSome animals such as hydra, planarian flatworms, and certain sponges, corals, and jellyfish do not die of old age and exhibit potential immortality.\n\nMuch life extension research focuses on nutrition—diets or supplements— although there is little evidence that they have an effect. The many diets promoted by anti-aging advocates are often contradictory. \n\nIn some studies calorie restriction has been shown to extend the life of mice, yeast, and rhesus monkeys. However, a more recent study did not find calorie restriction to improve survival in rhesus monkeys. In humans the long-term health effects of moderate caloric restriction with sufficient nutrients are unknown.\n\nThe free-radical theory of aging suggests that antioxidant supplements might extend human life. However, evidence suggest that β-carotene supplements and high doses of vitamin E increase mortality rates. Resveratrol is a sirtuin stimulant that has been shown to extend life in animal models, but the effect of resveratrol on lifespan in humans is unclear as of 2011.\n\nThe anti-aging industry offers several hormone therapies. Some of these have been criticized for possible dangers and a lack of proven effect. For example, the American Medical Association has been critical of some anti-aging hormone therapies.\n\nWhile growth hormone (GH) decreases with age, the evidence for use of growth hormone as an anti-aging therapy is mixed and based mostly on animal studies. There are mixed reports that GH or IGF-1 modulates the aging process in humans and about whether the direction of its effect is positive or negative.\n\nThe extension of life has been a desire of humanity and a mainstay motif in the history of scientific pursuits and ideas throughout history, from the Sumerian Epic of Gilgamesh and the Egyptian Smith medical papyrus, all the way through the Taoists, Ayurveda practitioners, alchemists, hygienists such as Luigi Cornaro, Johann Cohausen and Christoph Wilhelm Hufeland, and philosophers such as Francis Bacon, René Descartes, Benjamin Franklin and Nicolas Condorcet. However, the beginning of the modern period in this endeavor can be traced to the end of the 19th – beginning of the 20th century, to the so-called \"fin-de-siècle\" (end of the century) period, denoted as an \"end of an epoch\" and characterized by the rise of scientific optimism and therapeutic activism, entailing the pursuit of life extension (or life-extensionism). Among the foremost researchers of life extension at this period were the Nobel Prize winning biologist Elie Metchnikoff (1845-1916) -- the author of the cell theory of immunity and vice director of Institut Pasteur in Paris, and Charles-Édouard Brown-Séquard (1817-1894) -- the president of the French Biological Society and one of the founders of modern endocrinology.\n\nSociologist James Hughes claims that science has been tied to a cultural narrative of conquering death since the Age of Enlightenment. He cites Francis Bacon (1561–1626) as an advocate of using science and reason to extend human life, noting Bacon's novel \"New Atlantis\", wherein scientists worked toward delaying aging and prolonging life. Robert Boyle (1627–1691), founding member of the Royal Society, also hoped that science would make substantial progress with life extension, according to Hughes, and proposed such experiments as \"to replace the blood of the old with the blood of the young\". Biologist Alexis Carrel (1873–1944) was inspired by a belief in indefinite human lifespan that he developed after experimenting with cells, says Hughes.\n\nIn 1970, the American Aging Association was formed under the impetus of Denham Harman, originator of the free radical theory of aging. Harman wanted an organization of biogerontologists that was devoted to research and to the sharing of information among scientists interested in extending human lifespan.\n\nIn 1976, futurists Joel Kurtzman and Philip Gordon wrote \"No More Dying. The Conquest Of Aging And The Extension Of Human Life\", () the first popular book on research to extend human lifespan. Subsequently, Kurtzman was invited to testify before the House Select Committee on Aging, chaired by Claude Pepper of Florida, to discuss the impact of life extension on the Social Security system.\n\nSaul Kent published \"The Life Extension Revolution\" () in 1980 and created a nutraceutical firm called the Life Extension Foundation, a non-profit organization that promotes dietary supplements. The Life Extension Foundation publishes a periodical called \"Life Extension Magazine\". The 1982 bestselling book \"\" () by Durk Pearson and Sandy Shaw further popularized the phrase \"life extension\".\n\nRegulatory and legal struggles between the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Life Extension Foundation included seizure of merchandise and court action. In 1991, Saul Kent and Bill Faloon, the principals of the Foundation, were jailed. The LEF accused the FDA of perpetrating a \"Holocaust\" and \"seeking gestapo-like power\" through its regulation of drugs and marketing claims.\n\nIn 2003, Doubleday published \"The Immortal Cell: One Scientist's Quest to Solve the Mystery of Human Aging,\" by Michael D. West. West emphasised the potential role of embryonic stem cells in life extension.\n\nOther modern life extensionists include writer Gennady Stolyarov, who insists that death is \"the enemy of us all, to be fought with medicine, science, and technology\"; transhumanist philosopher Zoltan Istvan, who proposes that the \"transhumanist must safeguard one's own existence above all else\"; futurist George Dvorsky, who considers aging to be a problem that desperately needs to be solved; and recording artist Steve Aoki, who has been called \"one of the most prolific campaigners for life extension\".\n\nIn 1991, the American Academy of Anti-Aging Medicine (A4M) was formed. The American Board of Medical Specialties recognizes neither anti-aging medicine nor the A4M's professional standing.\n\nIn 2003, Aubrey de Grey and David Gobel formed the Methuselah Foundation, which gives financial grants to anti-aging research projects. In 2009, de Grey and several others founded the SENS Research Foundation, a California-based scientific research organization which conducts research into aging and funds other anti-aging research projects at various universities. In 2013, Google announced Calico, a new company based in San Francisco that will harness new technologies to increase scientific understanding of the biology of aging. It is led by Arthur D. Levinson, and its research team includes scientists such as Hal V. Barron, David Botstein, and Cynthia Kenyon. In 2014, biologist Craig Venter founded Human Longevity Inc., a company dedicated to scientific research to end aging through genomics and cell therapy. They received funding with the goal of compiling a comprehensive human genotype, microbiome, and phenotype database.\n\nAside from private initiatives, aging research is being conducted in university laboratories, and includes universities such as Harvard and UCLA. University researchers have made a number of breakthroughs in extending the lives of mice and insects by reversing certain aspects of aging.\n\nPolitics relevant to the substances of life extension pertain mostly to communications and availability.\n\nIn the United States, product claims on food and drug labels are strictly regulated. The First Amendment (freedom of speech) protects third-party publishers' rights to distribute fact, opinion and speculation on life extension practices. Manufacturers and suppliers also provide informational publications, but because they market the substances, they are subject to monitoring and enforcement by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), which polices claims by marketers. What constitutes the difference between truthful and false claims is hotly debated and is a central controversy in this arena.\n\nSome critics dispute the portrayal of aging as a disease. For example, Leonard Hayflick, who determined that fibroblasts are limited to around 50 cell divisions, reasons that aging is an unavoidable consequence of entropy. Hayflick and fellow biogerontologists Jay Olshansky and Bruce Carnes have strongly criticized the anti-aging industry in response to what they see as unscrupulous profiteering from the sale of unproven anti-aging supplements.\n\nResearch by Sobh and Martin (2011) suggests that people buy anti-aging products to obtain a hoped-for self (e.g., keeping a youthful skin) or to avoid a feared-self (e.g., looking old). The research shows that when consumers pursue a hoped-for self, it is expectations of success that most strongly drive their motivation to use the product. The research also shows why doing badly when trying to avoid a feared self is more motivating than doing well. When product use is seen to fail it is more motivating than success when consumers seek to avoid a feared-self.\n\nThough many scientists state that life extension and radical life extension are possible, there are still no international or national programs focused on radical life extension. There are political forces staying for and against life extension. By 2012, in Russia, the United States, Israel, and the Netherlands, the Longevity political parties started. They aimed to provide political support to radical life extension research and technologies, and ensure the fastest possible and at the same time soft transition of society to the next step – life without aging and with radical life extension, and to provide access to such technologies to most currently living people.\n\nSome tech innovators and Silicon Valley entrepreneurs have invested heavily into anti-aging research. This includes Larry Ellison (founder of Oracle), Peter Thiel (former Paypal CEO), Larry Page (co-founder of Google), and Peter Diamandis.\n\nLeon Kass (chairman of the US President's Council on Bioethics from 2001 to 2005) has questioned whether potential exacerbation of overpopulation problems would make life extension unethical. He states his opposition to life extension with the words:\nJohn Harris, former editor-in-chief of the Journal of Medical Ethics, argues that as long as life is worth living, according to the person himself, we have a powerful moral imperative to save the life and thus to develop and offer life extension therapies to those who want them.\n\nTranshumanist philosopher Nick Bostrom has argued that any technological advances in life extension must be equitably distributed and not restricted to a privileged few. In an extended metaphor entitled \"The Fable of the Dragon-Tyrant\", Bostrom envisions death as a monstrous dragon who demands human sacrifices. In the fable, after a lengthy debate between those who believe the dragon is a fact of life and those who believe the dragon can and should be destroyed, the dragon is finally killed. Bostrom argues that political inaction allowed many preventable human deaths to occur.\n\nControversy about life extension is due to fear of overpopulation and possible effects on society. Biogerontologist Aubrey De Grey counters the overpopulation critique by pointing out that the therapy could postpone or eliminate menopause, allowing women to space out their pregnancies over more years and thus \"decreasing\" the yearly population growth rate. Moreover, the philosopher and futurist Max More argues that, given the fact the worldwide population growth rate is slowing down and is projected to eventually stabilize and begin falling, superlongevity would be unlikely to contribute to overpopulation.\n\nA Spring 2013 Pew Research poll in the United States found that 38% of Americans would want life extension treatments, and 56% would reject it. However, it also found that 68% believed most people would want it and that only 4% consider an \"ideal lifespan\" to be more than 120 years. The median \"ideal lifespan\" was 91 years of age and the majority of the public (63%) viewed medical advances aimed at prolonging life as generally good. 41% of Americans believed that radical life extension (RLE) would be good for society, while 51% said they believed it would be bad for society. One possibility for why 56% of Americans claim they would reject life extension treatments may be due to the cultural perception that living longer would result in a longer period of decrepitude, and that the elderly in our current society are unhealthy.\n\nReligious people are no more likely to oppose life extension than the unaffiliated, though some variation exists between religious denominations.\n\nMainstream medical organizations and practitioners do not consider aging to be a disease. David Sinclair says: \"I don't see aging as a disease, but as a collection of quite predictable diseases caused by the deterioration of the body\". The two main arguments used are that aging is both inevitable and universal while diseases are not. However, not everyone agrees. Harry R. Moody, director of academic affairs for AARP, notes that what is normal and what is disease strongly depend on a historical context. David Gems, assistant director of the Institute of Healthy Ageing, argues that aging should be viewed as a disease. In response to the universality of aging, David Gems notes that it is as misleading as arguing that Basenji are not dogs because they do not bark. Because of the universality of aging he calls it a \"special sort of disease\". Robert M. Perlman, coined the terms \"aging syndrome\" and \"disease complex\" in 1954 to describe aging.\n\nThe discussion whether aging should be viewed as a disease or not has important implications. One view is, this would stimulate pharmaceutical companies to develop life extension therapies and in the United States of America, it would also increase the regulation of the anti-aging market by the FDA. Anti-aging now falls under the regulations for cosmetic medicine which are less tight than those for drugs.\n\nTheoretically, extension of maximum lifespan in humans could be achieved by reducing the rate of aging damage by periodic replacement of damaged tissues, molecular repair or rejuvenation of deteriorated cells and tissues, reversal of harmful epigenetic changes, or the enhancement of enzyme telomerase activity.\n\nResearch geared towards life extension strategies in various organisms is currently under way at a number of academic and private institutions. Since 2009, investigators have found ways to increase the lifespan of nematode worms and yeast by 10-fold; the record in nematodes was achieved through genetic engineering and the extension in yeast by a combination of genetic engineering and caloric restriction. A 2009 review of longevity research noted: \"Extrapolation from worms to mammals is risky at best, and it cannot be assumed that interventions will result in comparable life extension factors. Longevity gains from dietary restriction, or from mutations studied previously, yield smaller benefits to Drosophila than to nematodes, and smaller still to mammals. This is not unexpected, since mammals have evolved to live many times the worm's lifespan, and humans live nearly twice as long as the next longest-lived primate. From an evolutionary perspective, mammals and their ancestors have already undergone several hundred million years of natural selection favoring traits that could directly or indirectly favor increased longevity, and may thus have already settled on gene sequences that promote lifespan. Moreover, the very notion of a \"life-extension factor\" that could apply across taxa presumes a linear response rarely seen in biology.\"\n\nThere are a number of chemicals intended to slow the aging process currently being studied in animal models. One type of research is related to the observed effects of a calorie restriction (CR) diet, which has been shown to extend lifespan in some animals. Based on that research, there have been attempts to develop drugs that will have the same effect on the aging process as a caloric restriction diet, which are known as Caloric restriction mimetic drugs. Some drugs that are already approved for other uses have been studied for possible longevity effects on laboratory animals because of a possible CR-mimic effect; they include rapamycin, metformin and other geroprotectors. MitoQ, resveratrol and pterostilbene are dietary supplements that have also been studied in this context.\n\nOther attempts to create anti-aging drugs have taken different research paths. One notable direction of research has been research into the possibility of using the enzyme telomerase in order to counter the process of telomere shortening. However, there are potential dangers in this, since some research has also linked telomerase to cancer and to tumor growth and formation.\n\nFuture advances in nanomedicine could give rise to life extension through the repair of many processes thought to be responsible for aging. K. Eric Drexler, one of the founders of nanotechnology, postulated cell repair machines, including ones operating within cells and utilizing as yet hypothetical molecular computers, in his 1986 book Engines of Creation. Raymond Kurzweil, a futurist and transhumanist, stated in his book \"The Singularity Is Near\" that he believes that advanced medical nanorobotics could completely remedy the effects of aging by 2030. According to Richard Feynman, it was his former graduate student and collaborator Albert Hibbs who originally suggested to him (circa 1959) the idea of a \"medical\" use for Feynman's theoretical nanomachines (see biological machine). Hibbs suggested that certain repair machines might one day be reduced in size to the point that it would, in theory, be possible to (as Feynman put it) \"swallow the doctor\". The idea was incorporated into Feynman's 1959 essay \"There's Plenty of Room at the Bottom.\"\n\nSome life extensionists suggest that therapeutic cloning and stem cell research could one day provide a way to generate cells, body parts, or even entire bodies (generally referred to as reproductive cloning) that would be genetically identical to a prospective patient. Recently, the US Department of Defense initiated a program to research the possibility of growing human body parts on mice. Complex biological structures, such as mammalian joints and limbs, have not yet been replicated. Dog and primate brain transplantation experiments were conducted in the mid-20th century but failed due to rejection and the inability to restore nerve connections. As of 2006, the implantation of bio-engineered bladders grown from patients' own cells has proven to be a viable treatment for bladder disease. Proponents of body part replacement and cloning contend that the required biotechnologies are likely to appear earlier than other life-extension technologies.\n\nThe use of human stem cells, particularly embryonic stem cells, is controversial. Opponents' objections generally are based on interpretations of religious teachings or ethical considerations. Proponents of stem cell research point out that cells are routinely formed and destroyed in a variety of contexts. Use of stem cells taken from the umbilical cord or parts of the adult body may not provoke controversy.\n\nThe controversies over cloning are similar, except general public opinion in most countries stands in opposition to reproductive cloning. Some proponents of therapeutic cloning predict the production of whole bodies, lacking consciousness, for eventual brain transplantation.\n\nReplacement of biological (susceptible to diseases) organs with mechanical ones could extend life. This is the goal of the 2045 Initiative.\n\nFor cryonicists (advocates of cryopreservation), storing the body at low temperatures after death may provide an \"ambulance\" into a future in which advanced medical technologies may allow resuscitation and repair. They speculate cryogenic temperatures will minimize changes in biological tissue for many years, giving the medical community ample time to cure all disease, rejuvenate the aged and repair any damage that is caused by the cryopreservation process.\n\nMany cryonicists do not believe that legal death is \"real death\" because stoppage of heartbeat and breathing—the usual medical criteria for legal death—occur before biological death of cells and tissues of the body. Even at room temperature, cells may take hours to die and days to decompose. Although neurological damage occurs within 4–6 minutes of cardiac arrest, the irreversible neurodegenerative processes do not manifest for hours. Cryonicists state that rapid cooling and cardio-pulmonary support applied immediately after certification of death can preserve cells and tissues for long-term preservation at cryogenic temperatures. People, particularly children, have survived up to an hour without heartbeat after submersion in ice water. In one case, full recovery was reported after 45 minutes underwater. To facilitate rapid preservation of cells and tissue, cryonics \"standby teams\" are available to wait by the bedside of patients who are to be cryopreserved to apply cooling and cardio-pulmonary support as soon as possible after declaration of death.\n\nNo mammal has been successfully cryopreserved and brought back to life, with the exception of frozen human embryos. Resuscitation of a postembryonic human from cryonics is not possible with current science. Some scientists still support the idea based on their expectations of the capabilities of future science.\n\nAnother proposed life extension technology would combine existing and predicted future biochemical and genetic techniques. SENS proposes that rejuvenation may be obtained by removing aging damage via the use of stem cells and tissue engineering, telomere-lengthening machinery, allotopic expression of mitochondrial proteins, targeted ablation of cells, immunotherapeutic clearance, and novel lysosomal hydrolases.\n\nWhile many biogerontologists find these ideas \"worthy of discussion\" and SENS conferences feature important research in the field, some contend that the alleged benefits are too speculative given the current state of technology, referring to it as \"fantasy rather than science\".\n\nGenome editing, in which nucleic acid polymers are delivered as a drug and are either expressed as proteins, interfere with the expression of proteins, or correct genetic mutations, has been proposed as a future strategy to prevent aging.\n\nA large array of genetic modifications have been found to increase lifespan in model organisms such as yeast, nematode worms, fruit flies, and mice. As of 2013, the longest extension of life caused by a single gene manipulation was roughly 50% in mice and 10-fold in nematode worms.\n\nIn \"The Selfish Gene\", Richard Dawkins describes an approach to life-extension that involves \"fooling genes\" into thinking the body is young. Dawkins attributes inspiration for this idea to Peter Medawar. The basic idea is that our bodies are composed of genes that activate throughout our lifetimes, some when we are young and others when we are older. Presumably, these genes are activated by environmental factors, and the changes caused by these genes activating can be lethal. It is a statistical certainty that we possess more lethal genes that activate in later life than in early life. Therefore, to extend life, we should be able to prevent these genes from switching on, and we should be able to do so by \"identifying changes in the internal chemical environment of a body that take place during aging... and by simulating the superficial chemical properties of a young body\".\n\nOne hypothetical future strategy that, as some suggest, \"eliminates\" the complications related to a physical body, involves the copying or transferring (e.g. by progressively replacing neurons with transistors) of a conscious mind from a biological brain to a non-biological computer system or computational device. The basic idea is to scan the structure of a particular brain in detail, and then construct a software model of it that is so faithful to the original that, when run on appropriate hardware, it will behave in essentially the same way as the original brain. Whether or not an exact copy of one's mind constitutes actual life extension is matter of debate.\n\nSome scientists believe that the dead may one day be \"resurrected\" through simulation technology.\n\nSome clinics currently offer injection of blood products from young donors. The alleged benefits of the treatment, none of which have been demonstrated in a proper study, include a longer life, darker hair, better memory, better sleep, curing heart diseases, diabetes and Alzheimer. The approach is based on parabiosis studies such as Irina Conboy do on mice, but Conboy says young blood does not reverse aging (even in mice) and that those who offer those treatments have misunderstood her research. Neuroscientist Tony Wyss-Coray, who also studied blood exchanges on mice as recently as 2014, said people offering those treatments are \"basically abusing people's trust\" and that young blood treatments are \"the scientific equivalent of fake news\". The treatment appeared in HBO's Silicon Valley fiction series.\n\nTwo clinics in California, run by Jesse Karmazin and David C. Wright, offer $8,000 injections of plasma extracted from the blood of young people. Karmazin has not published in any peer-reviewed journal and his current study does not use a control group.\n\n\n"}

An RNN composed of LSTM units is often called an \"LSTM network\". A common LSTM unit is composed of a cell, an input gate, an output gate and a forget gate. The cell remembers values over arbitrary time intervals and the three \"gates\" regulate the flow of information into and out of the cell.\n\nLSTM networks are well-suited to classifying, processing and making predictions based on time series data, since there can be lags of unknown duration between important events in a time series. LSTMs were developed to deal with the exploding and vanishing gradient problems that can be encountered when training traditional RNNs. Relative insensitivity to gap length is an advantage of LSTM over RNNs, hidden Markov models and other sequence learning methods in numerous applications .\n\nLSTM was proposed in 1997 by Sepp Hochreiter and Jürgen Schmidhuber and improved in 2000 by Felix Gers' team.\n\nAmong other successes, LSTM achieved record results in natural language text compression, unsegmented connected handwriting recognition and won the ICDAR handwriting competition (2009). LSTM networks were a major component of a network that achieved a record 17.7% phoneme error rate on the classic TIMIT natural speech dataset (2013).\n\nAs of 2016, major technology companies including Google, Apple, and Microsoft were using LSTM as fundamental components in new products. For example, Google used LSTM for speech recognition on the smartphone, for the smart assistant Allo and for Google Translate. Apple uses LSTM for the \"Quicktype\" function on the iPhone and for Siri. Amazon uses LSTM for Amazon Alexa.\n\nIn 2017 researchers from Michigan State University, IBM Research, and Cornell University published a study in the Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (KDD) conference. Their study describes a novel neural network that performs better than the widely used long short-term memory neural network.\n\nFurther in 2017 Microsoft reported reaching 95.1% recognition accuracy on the Switchboard corpus, incorporating a vocabulary of 165,000 words. The approach used \"dialog session-based long-short-term memory\".\n\nThere are several architectures of LSTM units. A common architecture is composed of a memory \"cell\", an \"input gate\", an \"output gate\" and a \"forget gate\".\n\nAn LSTM \"cell\" takes an input and stores it for some period of time. This is equivalent to applying the identity function (formula_1 to the input. Because the derivative of the identity function is constant, when an LSTM network is trained with backpropagation through time, the gradient does not vanish.\n\nThe activation function of the LSTM \"gates\" is often the logistic function. Intuitively, the \"input gate\" controls the extent to which a new value flows into the cell, the \"forget gate\" controls the extent to which a value remains in the cell and the \"output gate\" controls the extent to which the value in the cell is used to compute the output activation of the LSTM unit.\n\nThere are connections into and out of the LSTM \"gates\", a few of which are recurrent. The weights of these connections, which need to be learned during training, determine how the gates operate.\n\nIn the equations below, the lowercase variables represent vectors. Matrices formula_2 and formula_3 contain, respectively, the weights of the input and recurrent connections, where formula_4 can either be the input gate formula_5, output gate formula_6, the forget gate formula_7 or the memory cell formula_8, depending on the activation being calculated.\n\nThe compact forms of the equations for the forward pass of an LSTM unit with a forget gate are:\n\nwhere the initial values are formula_10 and formula_11 and the operator formula_12 denotes the Hadamard product (element-wise product). The subscript formula_13 indexes the time step.\n\n\nwhere the superscripts formula_23 and formula_24 refer to the number of input features and number of hidden units, respectively.\n\n\nThe figure on the right is a graphical representation of an LSTM unit with peephole connections (i.e. a peephole LSTM). Peephole connections allow the gates to access the constant error carousel (CEC), whose activation is the cell state. formula_29 is not used, formula_30 is used instead in most places.\n\nPeephole convolutional LSTM. The formula_32 denotes the convolution operator.\n\nTo minimize LSTM's total error on a set of training sequences, iterative gradient descent such as backpropagation through time can be used to change each weight in proportion to the derivative of the error with respect to it. A problem with using gradient descent for standard RNNs is that error gradients vanish exponentially quickly with the size of the time lag between important events. This is due to formula_34 if the spectral radius of formula_35 is smaller than 1. With LSTM units, however, when error values are back-propagated from the output, the error remains in the unit's memory. This \"error carousel\" continuously feeds error back to each of the gates until they learn to cut off the value. Thus, regular backpropagation is effective at training an LSTM unit to remember values for long durations.\n\nLSTM can also be trained by a combination of artificial evolution for weights to the hidden units, and pseudo-inverse or support vector machines for weights to the output units. In reinforcement learning applications LSTM can be trained by policy gradient methods, evolution strategies or genetic algorithms.\n\nMany applications use stacks of LSTM RNNs and train them by connectionist temporal classification (CTC) to find an RNN weight matrix that maximizes the probability of the label sequences in a training set, given the corresponding input sequences. CTC achieves both alignment and recognition.\n\nApplications of LSTM include:\nLSTM has Turing completeness in the sense that given enough network units it can compute any result that a conventional computer can compute, provided it has the proper weight matrix, which may be viewed as its program.\n\n\n"}

Hora described it as \"a scientific method of healing and education based on metaphysical concepts of man and the universe.\" Metapsychiatry was inspired by Hora's dissatisfaction with what he believed was psychoanalysis's failure to account for human spirituality, and his observation that psychiatric healing was often temporary. It is characterized by a hermeneutic approach, with precise definitions of psychological terms and conditions, and what it calls “spiritual reality.”\n\nMetapsychiatry borrows from Judeo-Christian, Zen Buddhist and Taoist religious traditions, along with theistic existentialist philosophy and phenomenology; similarities to Morita therapy have been noted. While the teachings of Christ are central, metapsychiatry is not aligned with a Christian denomination, refrains from valuing historical and sacramental teachings, and makes a distinction between religious practice and spiritual interest. God is perceived as \"limitless, infinite and non-material.\"\n\nIts style originates with the assertion that “the meaning and purpose of life are to come to know reality,” which is defined as “God”, “Love-Intelligence” or “Infinite Mind.”\n\nStudy of metapsychiatry includes implementation of “the two intelligent questions”, which seek to distinguish between experiential and spiritual existence. The first question is \"What is the meaning of what seems to be?\" The second question asks \"What is what really is?\" The aim is a reorientation from a preoccupation with material appearances toward the apprehension of spiritual reality. Metapsychiatry maintains that the problems of humankind are based in ignorance, and may be overcome through \"Knowledge of the truth of what really is.\" Problems are viewed as psychological; answers are spiritual. Metapsychiatry holds that suffering is the product of self-confirmatory thought, the insistence on affirming one's existence, and that relief from suffering is realized through enlightened transcendence of the material world. \n\nThe qualities of peace, assurance, gratitude and love (PAGL) are cited as indicating a state of spiritual consciousness.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "223430", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=223430", "title": "Monito del monte", "text": "Monito del monte\n\nThe monito del monte (Spanish for \"little monkey of the bush\") or colocolo opossum, \"Dromiciops gliroides\", also called \"chumaihuén\" in Mapudungun, is a diminutive marsupial native only to southwestern South America (Argentina and Chile). It is the only extant species in the ancient order Microbiotheria, and the sole New World representative of the superorder Australidelphia (all other New World marsupials are members of the paraphyletic \"Ameridelphia\"). The species is nocturnal and arboreal, and lives in thickets of South American mountain bamboo in the Valdivian temperate rain forests of the southern Andes, aided by its partially prehensile tail. It eats primarily insects and other small invertebrates, supplemented with fruit.\n\nThe monito del monte is the sole extant member of the order Microbiotheria. It was first described by English zoologist Oldfield Thomas in 1894. The generic name \"Dromiciops\" is based on the resemblance of the monito del monte to the eastern pygmy possum (\"Cercartetus nanus\"), one of the synonyms of which is \"Dromicia nana\". The specific name \"gliroides\" is a combination of the Latin \"gliris\" (\"dormouse\", more generally \"rodent\") and Greek \"oides\" (\"similar to\"). The name \"australis\" in a synonym (\"D. australis\") refers to the southern distribution of the animal.\n\nIn his 1943 \"Mammals of Chile\", American zoologist Wilfred Hudson Osgood identified two subspecies of the monito del monte:\n\n\nSouth American marsupials have long been suspected to be ancestral to those of Australia, consistent with the fact that the two continents were connected via Antarctica in the early Cenozoic. Australia’s earliest known marsupial is \"Djarthia\", a primitive mouse-like animal that lived in the early Eocene about 55 million years ago (mya). \"Djarthia\" had been identified as the earliest known australidelphian, and this research suggested that the monito del monte was the last of a clade that included \"Djarthia\". This relationship suggests that the ancestors of the monito del monte might have reached South America by back-migration from Australia. The time of divergence between the monito del monte and Australian marsupials was estimated to have been 46 mya.\n\nHowever, in 2010, analysis of retrotransposon insertion sites in the nuclear DNA of a variety of marsupials, while confirming the placement of the monito del monte in Australidelphia, also clarified that its lineage is the most basal of that superorder. The study further confirmed that the most basal of all marsupial orders are the other two South American lineages (Didelphimorphia and Paucituberculata, with the former probably branching first). This conclusion indicates that Australidelphia arose in South America (along with the ancestors of all other living marsupials), and probably reached Australia in a single dispersal event after Microbiotheria split off. Fossils of another Eocene australidelphian, the microbiotherian \"Woodburnodon casei\", have been described from the Antarctic peninsula, and fossils of a related early Eocene woodburnodontid have been found in Patagonia.\n\nMonitos del monte live in the dense, humid forests of highland Argentina and Chile, mainly in trees, where they construct spherical nests of water resistant colihue leaves. These leaves are then lined with moss or grass, and placed in well-protected areas of the tree, such as underbrush, tree cavities, or fallen timber. The nests are sometimes covered with grey moss as a form of camouflage. These nests provide the monito del monte with some protection from the cold, both when it is active and when it hibernates.\n\nMonitos del monte are small marsupials that look like mice. \"Dromiciops\" have the same dental formula as \"Didelphids\": , a total of 50 teeth. Their size ranges from . They have short and dense fur that is primarily brown-gray with patches of white at their shoulders and back, and their underside is more of a cream or light gray color. Monitos del monte also have distinct black rings around their eyes. Their small furred ears are well-rounded and their rostrums are short. The head to body length is around , and their tail length is between . Their tails are somewhat prehensile and mostly furred with the exception of of the underside. The naked underside of their tails may contribute to increasing friction when the mammal is on a tree. The base of their tails also functions as a fat storage organ which they use during winter hibernation. In a week, monitos del monte can store enough fat to double their body size.\n\n\nAt the end of the summer, female Monitos del monte tend to be larger and heavier than males. The tails of the sexes also vary in size during this time; females have a thicker tail, which is where they store fat; the difference suggests that females need more energy than males during hibernation. The sexual dimorphism is only seen during this time and not year-round.\n\nMonitos del monte have a monogamous mating system. The females have well-formed, fur-lined marsupium containing four mammae. They normally reproduce in the spring once a year and can have a litter size varying from one to five. They can feed a maximum of four offspring, so if there are five young, one will not survive. When the young are mature enough to leave the pouch, approximately five months, they are nursed in a distinctive nest. They are then carried on the mother's back. The young remain in association with the mother after weaning. Males and females both reach sexual maturity after two years.\n\nThe monito del monte is adapted to arboreal life; its tail and paws are prehensile. It is largely nocturnal and, depending on the ambient and internal temperature, and on the availability of food, it spends much of the day in a state of torpor. Such behaviour enables it to survive periods of extreme weather and food shortage, conserving energy instead of foraging to no effect.\n\nThe animal covers its nest with moss for concealment, and for insulation and protection from bad weather.\n\nMonitos del monte are primarily insectivores. They eat insects and other invertebrates they find on the branches of trees and cracks in bark, but during the summer they eat large quantities of fruit, especially mistletoe fruit.\n\n\nA study performed in the temperate forests of southern Argentina showed a mutualistic seed dispersal relationship between \"D. gliroides\" and \"Tristerix corymbosus\", also known as the loranthacous mistletoe. The monito del monte is the sole dispersal agent for this plant, and without it the plant would likely become extinct. The monito del monte eats the fruit of \"T. corymbosus\", and germination takes place in the gut. Scientists speculate that the coevolution of these two species could have begun 60–70 million years ago.\n\nFor the past few years the number of \"Dromiciops\" has declined, and the species is now classified as 'near threatened'. Many factors contribute to the decline:\n\nThe monito del monte is not the only organism which will be affected if it becomes endangered. \"Dromiciops\" illustrate parasite-host specificity with the tick \"Ixodes neuquenensis\". This tick can only be found on the monito del monte, so it depends on the survival of this nearly endangered mammal. \"T. corymbosus\" also depends on the survival of this species, because without the seed dispersal agency of the monito del monte, it would not be able to reproduce.\n\nLittle conservation effort is being undertaken at the moment, but there are ecological studies being conducted in the Chiloé Island that might help future conservation efforts. \"Dromiciops\" has been found in the Los Ruiles National Reserve and the Valdivian Coastal Reserve, which are protected areas in Chile.\n\n"}
{"id": "4208984", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4208984", "title": "Parliamentary Office of Science and Technology", "text": "Parliamentary Office of Science and Technology\n\nThe Parliamentary Office of Science and Technology, (POST) is the Parliament of the United Kingdom's in-house source of independent, balanced and accessible analysis of public policy issues related to science and technology. POST (rather distinctively) serves BOTH Houses of Parliament (the House of Commons and equally the House of Lords) as a joint establishment, through output that is apolitical and of widely acclaimed value to Parliamentarians of all parties. Thorough quality-control ensures that MPs and Peers can have confidence in its analyses should they wish to cite them in debate. These principles are reflected in the structure of POST’s Board with members from the Commons and Lords together with distinguished scientists and engineers from the wider world.\nSince 1939, a group of MPs and peers interested in science and technology, through the first parliamentary \"All Party Group\", the UK Parliamentary and Scientific Committee (P&S), had encouraged UK Parliamentarians to explore the implications of scientific developments for society and public policy. As the UK economy became more dependent on technological progress, and the varied effects of technology (especially on the environment) became more apparent, it was felt that UK Parliament needed its own resources on such issues. Parliamentarians not only required access to knowledge and insights into the implications of technology for their constituents and society, but also needed to exercise their scrutiny functions over UK government legislation and administration. This thinking was also influenced by the fact that specialised parliamentary science and technology organisations already existed overseas.\n\nP&S members (Sir Ian Lloyd MP, Sir Trevor Skeet MP, Sir Gerry Vaughan MP, Lords Kennet, Gregson and Flowers among others) visited already established organisations in the US, Germany and France, and this reinforced their view that modern Parliaments needed their own ‘intelligence’ on science and technology-related issues. Initially they asked the then Thatcher government to fund such services at Westminster but were asked first to demonstrate a real need. This led to the P&S creating a charitable foundation to raise funds from P&S members.\n\nThe parliamentary reaction was positive and led to the appointment of a first Director, Dr Michael Norton. In 1989, POST was formally established as a charitable foundation, though not an internal part of Parliament.\n\nPOST had attracted more resources by 1992 and then recruited 3 specialist science advisers and began its fellowship programme with the UK research councils.\n\nIn 1992 the House of Commons Information Committee, supported by the House of Lords, recommended that Parliament should itself fund POST for 3 years, and a subsequent review in 1995 extended this for a further 5 years. This was the result of POST demonstrating real interest and demand from MPs and peers.\n\nPOST's financial reliance on donations from bodies external to Parliament, even those as prestigious as the Royal Society, had always slightly compromised the perceived independence of the office.\n\nFrom 1997 the chair of the POST board was appointed by government Whips. Since then, chairs have been Dr Ian Gibson MP 1997-2001, Dr Phyllis Starkey MP 2001-2005, and Dr Ashok Kumar MP 2005-2010. Dr Kumar died shortly before the UK 2010 General Election. Since then, subject to parliamentary approval, the Chair of POST has been Adam Afiyie, MP.\n\nIn 1998 Professor David Cope took over as Director of POST. He guided the Office towards the goal of establishing POST as a permanent office of the UK Parliament - and dramatically expanded its staffing, wider links and more general recognition of its role as a special, distinctive, institution that the UK Parliament had agreed, enthusiastically, to endorse.\n\nIn 2001, both Houses decided that POST should indeed be established as a permanent bicameral institution, funded exclusively by Parliament itself, through the two Houses, in a ratio of 70%/30%, Commons/Lords.\n\nIn 2009, POST celebrated its 20th anniversary with, among other events, a special conference, arranged by the Director, Prof Cope, on \"Images of the Future\". The keynote participants were the Hon. Bart Gordon, Chair of the US House of Representatives' Committee on Science and Technology and Dr Jim Dator of the University of Hawaii Futures Research Centre, along with many other Members and staff of Parliaments across the world.\n\nBecause of the enthusiasm of Members of both Houses, POST had enjoyed a unique status within Parliament. It was from its inception attached administratively to the House of Commons COMMISSION (though always with its link to the House of Lords.)\n\nThis arrangement was intended specifically to distinguish the office and its functions from the Libraries of either House. These conduct non peer-reviewed \"studies\", of varying quality. POST - on the other hand - was expected to provide proactive analysis and options, freed from the immediate pressure of political or administrative expectations, trying to embrace futures thinking, and above all, to subject all its work to the most critical peer review analysis.\n\nPOST'S Director, Prof David Cope, returned to Cambridge University in 2012 and Dr. Chris Tyler was appointed by parliamentary authorities to a reduced role, which saw the fundamental rationale of POST as a \"science and technology assessment\" institution increasingly changed to one which more engaged with the ongoing debate on \"science policy\".\n\nPOST, from its foundation, had always been an institution \"of\", rather than \"for\" - science and technology -in other words - it did not in any way lobby for more public funds for scientific or technological research. Dr Tyler, however, was closely involved with the \"Campaign for Science and Engineering\" - a UK body which does so lobby. On appointment, he did not immediately resign his role in any lobbying body, and this continued seriously to undermine his perceived independence while head of POST.\n\nDr. Tyler left POST in 2017 for a secondary position at University College London.\n\nThe Acting Directorship of POST was taken over by a longstanding staff member, Dr Chandrika Nath, who was totally immune from any such lobbying role. In 2018, in a reconfirmed acknowledgement of POST's immutable science and technology assessment role, she was appointed Executive Director of the international Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research, the highly prestigious intergovernmental organisation.\n\nDr. Grant Hill-Cawthorne (University of Sydney) became Head of POST from May 2018. \n\nMost parliamentarians do not have a scientific or technological background but science and technology issues are increasingly integral to public policy. Parliamentarians are bombarded daily with lobbying, public enquiries and media stories about science and technology. These cover diverse areas such as medical advances, environmental issues and global communications. POST helps parliamentarians examine such issues effectively by providing information resources, in depth analysis and impartial advice. POST works closely with a wide range of organisations involved in science and technology, including select committees, all-party parliamentary groups, government departments, scientific societies, policy think tanks, business, academia and research funders.\n\nPOST's aim is to inform parliamentary debate through:\n\nA parliamentary board guides POST's choice of subjects. A team of advisers conduct analyses, drawing on a wide range of external expertise. All reports and POSTnotes are externally peer reviewed, and scrutinised by the board before publication.\n\nPOST's work falls into four topical areas:\n\nPOST is a member of the European Parliamentary Technology Assessment network, which brings together parliamentary organisations throughout Europe sharing information and working on joint projects. POST also liaises with science and technology organisations across the world.\n\nBetween November 2005 to 2009, POST, collaborating with four of its sister organisations - at the Danish, Dutch, Flemish and German Parliaments - provided technology assessment services to the Science and Technology Options Assessment unit of the European Parliament, in Brussels and Strasbourg.\n\nFrom 2001 POST received a growing number of requests for advice from parliamentarians in developing countries. It became clear that a real need existed to strengthen capacity in developing country parliaments. In 2005, POST held discussions on this issue with the Gatsby Foundation, which led to a special initiative to assist African Parliaments, and other organisations in their countries, in building parliamentary capacity to handle policy issues related to science and technology. At a time when there is growing awareness of the importance of science and technology in decision making, as demonstrated by, for example, the focus on science, technology and innovation at the African Union summit meeting in January 2007, this programme continues to contribute towards the overall objective of ensuring that parliaments have the capacity to scrutinise decision making processes and act as the national fora for discussion and debate on the broad implications of issues with a basis in science and technology. By sharing information and best practice with overseas parliaments and assemblies, the programme supports one of the primary objectives of the House: to promote public knowledge and understanding of the work and role of Parliament through the provision of information and access.\n\nThe POST Board oversees POST's objectives, outputs and future work programme. It meets quarterly. The Board comprises:\n\n\n\n\n\nPOST has eight science advisers, covering the fields of biology and health; physical sciences and ICT; environment and energy; and social sciences. Science advisers generally have a postgraduate qualification and science policy experience.\n\nPOST runs formal fellowship schemes with scientific societies and research councils, whereby PhD students can spend three months working at POST through an extension of their maintenance grants. These include:\n\n\nThe Following two organisations collaborate to offer an annual Fellowship in memory of the late Chemical Engineer and Parliamentarian Ashok Kumar MP. This Fellowship enables an Engineering or Science PhD student to spend three months working at POST and get a better understanding of how parliament works. By 2017 the 6th Ashok Kumar Fellow had been appointed to work with POST she was a postgraduate engineering student, Erin Johnson, from Imperial College, London.\n\n\nFor more information on fellowship applications see the 'POST Fellowships' section of the POST website.\n\n"}
{"id": "1626446", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1626446", "title": "Phenomenological life", "text": "Phenomenological life\n\nPhenomenological life () is life considered from a philosophical and rigorously phenomenological point of view. The relevant philosophical project is called \"radical phenomenology of life\" (\"phénoménologie radicale de la vie\") or \"material phenomenology of life\" (\"phénoménologie matérielle de la vie\").\n\nThe philosopher Michel Henry defines life from a phenomenological point of view as that which possesses the faculty and the power \"of feeling and experiencing oneself in each point of its being\".\n\nFor Michel Henry, life is essentially subjective force and affectivity — it consists of a pure subjective experience of oneself which perpetually oscillates between suffering and joy. A \"subjective force\" is not an impersonal, blind and insensitive force like the objective forces we meet in nature, but a living and sensible force experienced from within and resulting from an inner desire and a subjective effort of the will to satisfy it. Starting from this phenomenological approach to life, in \"Incarnation, une philosophie de la chair (Incarnation, a Philosophy of the Flesh)\" Michel Henry establishes a radical opposition between the living flesh endowed with sensibility and the material body, which is in principle insensible.\n\nThe word \"phenomenological\" refers to phenomenology, which is the study of phenomena and a philosophical method which fundamentally concerns the study of phenomena as they appear. What Henry calls \"absolute phenomenological life\" is the subjective life of individuals reduced to its pure inner manifestation, as we perpetually live it and feel it. It is life as it reveals itself and appears inwardly, its self-revelation: life is both what reveals and what is revealed.\n\nLife is by nature invisible because it never appears in the exteriority of a look; it reveals itself in itself without gap or distance. The fact of seeing does in effect presuppose the existence of a distance and of a separation between what is seen and the one who sees, between the object that is perceived and the subject who perceives it. A feeling, for example, can never be seen from the exterior, it never appears in the \"horizon of visibility\" of the world; it feels itself and experiences itself from within in the radical immanence of life. Love cannot see itself, any more than hatred; feelings are felt in the secrecy of our hearts, where no look can penetrate. \n\nLife is constituted of sensitivity and affectivity — it is the unity of their manifestation, affectivity being however the essence of sensibility (as Henry shows in \"The Essence of Manifestation\") which means that every sensation is affective by nature. Phenomenological life is the foundation of all our subjective experiences (like the subjective experience of a sorrow, of seeing a color or the pleasure of drinking fresh water in summer) and of each of our subjective powers (the subjective power of moving the hand or the eyes, for example).\n\nIn \"Incarnation, a philosophy of the flesh\", Henry establishes a radical opposition between the living flesh endowed with sensibility and the material body which is as a matter of principle insensitive.\n\nThis phenomenological definition of life is founded, then, in the concrete subjective experience we have of life in our own existence. It thus corresponds to human life. In \"I am the Truth. Toward a Philosophy of Christianity\", Michel Henry writes about the other forms of life studied by biology and from which Heidegger derives his own philosophical conception of life: \"Is it not paradoxical for anyone who wants to know what life is to go and ask protozoa or, in the best case, honeybees? As if our only relation with life was a wholly external and fragile relation with beings about whom we know nothing – or so very little! As if we ourselves were not living beings!\"\n\nThis definition, however, fails to include living organisms that cannot experience themselves, such as plant life — unless one can find evidence of the existence of a certain kind of sensibility in them, as Professor A. Tronchet appears to suggest in his book \"La sensibilité des plantes (Plant Sensibility)\": \"The protoplasm of plant cells, like that of animal cells, is endowed with irritability, i.e. a particular form of sensibility, thanks to which it is capable of being affected by excitations originating externally or internally\".\n\nMichel Henry explains in \"C’est Moi la Vérité. Pour une philosophie du christianisme (I am the Truth. Towards a Philosophy of Christianity)\" what Christianity considers to be the Truth and which he calls \"the Truth of Life\". He shows that the Christian concept of Truth is opposed to what men habitually consider to be the truth, which originates in Greek thought and which he calls \"the truth of the world\". But what is truth? Truth is what shows itself and thus demonstrates its reality in its effective manifestation in us or in the world. \n\nThe truth of the world designates an external and objective truth, a truth in which everything appears to our gaze in the form of a visible object at a distance from us, i.e. in the form of a representation which is distinct from what it shows: when we look at an apple, it is not the apple in itself that we see but a mere image of the apple that appears in our sensibility and which changes depending on the lighting or the angle from which we view it. In the same way, when we look at a person's face, it is not the person in herself that we see, but only an image of her face, her visible appearance in the world. According to this way of conceiving truth, life is nothing more than a set of objective properties characterised (for example) by the need to feed oneself or one's aptitude for reproduction.\n\nIn Christianity, Life is reduced to its internal reality, which is absolutely subjective and radically immanent. Considered in its phenomenological reality, Life is quite simply the faculty and the subjective ability to feel sensations, small pleasures or great hurts, to experience desires and feelings, to move our bodies from within by exerting subjective effort, or even to think. All such faculties possess the fundamental characteristic of appearing and manifesting themselves in themselves, with no gap or distance; we do not perceive them from outside our being or as present to our gaze, but only in us: we coincide with each of these abilities. Life is in itself the power of manifestation and revelation, and what it manifests is itself, in its feeling self-revelation — it is a power of revelation which is perpetually at work within us and which we continually forget.\n\nThe Truth of Life is \"absolutely\" subjective — that is, it is independent of our subjective beliefs and tastes. The perception of a coloured sensation or a pain, for example, is not a matter of personal preference but a fact and an incontestable inner experience which pertains to the \"absolute\" subjectivity of Life. The Truth of Life does not therefore differ in any way from that which it makes true, it is not distinct from that which manifests itself in it. Truth is manifestation itself in its pure inner revelation, and Life is what Christianity calls God.\n\nThe Truth of Life is not a relative truth which varies from one individual to another, but absolute Truth which is the inner foundation of each of our faculties and abilities, and which illuminates the least of our impressions. The Truth of Life is not an abstract and indifferent truth; on the contrary, it is that which is most essential for man, as it is this alone that can lead him to salvation in his inner identification with it and in becoming the Son of God, rather than losing himself in the world.\n\n"}
{"id": "490832", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=490832", "title": "Pokémon Gold and Silver", "text": "Pokémon Gold and Silver\n\nPokémon Gold Version and Silver Version are role-playing video games developed by Game Freak and published by Nintendo for the Game Boy Color. They are the first installments in the second generation of the \"Pokémon\" series. They were released in Japan in 1999, Australia and North America in 2000, and Europe in 2001. \"Pokémon Crystal\", a special edition, was released roughly a year later in each region. In 2009, Game Freak remade \"Gold\" and \"Silver\" for the Nintendo DS as \"Pokémon HeartGold\" and \"SoulSilver\".\n\nThe games introduce 100 new species of Pokémon, and follow the progress of the central character, whose name the player may choose, in his quest to master Pokémon battling. Both games are independent of each other but feature largely the same plot and, while both can be played separately, it is necessary to trade between them and their backward compatible predecessors in order to fully complete the games' Pokédexes. The Johto Saga of the Pokémon anime is based on the new region introduced in the games.\n\n\"Pokémon Gold\" and \"Silver\" were critically acclaimed upon release and they are considered by many to be the best games in the entire series, as well as some of the fifth generation console gaming's most significant titles. They continued the enormous success of their predecessors as Pokémon began to form into a multi-billion dollar franchise. The games almost matched the sales of \"Pokémon Red\" and \"Blue\" and went on to jointly sell millions of copies worldwide. By 2010, the recorded sales of \"Gold\" and \"Silver\" were at 23 million units.\n\nOn June 6, 2017, The Pokémon Company announced via a Pokémon Direct broadcast that the games would be re-released via the Nintendo 3DS Virtual Console on September 22 that year in all regions.\n\nLike \"Pokémon Red\", \"Blue\" and \"Yellow\", \"Pokémon Gold\" and \"Silver\" are played from a top-down perspective, or third-person, with players directly navigating the protagonist around the fictional universe, interacting with objects and people. As the player explores this world, he or she will encounter different terrains, such as grassy fields, forests, caves, and seas in which different Pokémon species reside. As the player randomly encounters one of these creatures, the field switches to a turn-based \"battle scene\", where the Pokémon will fight.\n\nThere are two main goals within the games: following through the main storyline and defeating the Elite Four and Pokémon Master Lance to become the new Champion, and completing the Pokédex by capturing, evolving, and trading to obtain all 251 creatures. A major aspect of this is developing and raising the player's Pokémon by battling other Pokémon, which can be found in the wild or owned by other Trainers. This system of accumulating experience points (EXP) and leveling up, characteristic and integral to all \"Pokémon\" video games, controls the physical properties of the Pokémon, such as the battle statistics acquired, and the moves learned.\n\nWhile \"Pokémon Gold\" and \"Silver\" retain the basic mechanics of capturing, battling, and evolving introduced in \"Pokémon Red\" and \"Blue\", new features were added. A time system was introduced using a real-time internal clock that keeps track of the current time and day of the week. Certain events, including Pokémon appearances, are influenced by this feature. New items were added, with some designed to exploit a new mechanic: Pokémon being able to hold items. A new type of item able to be held was the berry, which comes in varieties and can restore health or cure status effects. Other held items can give boosts to the Pokémon during battle. More specialized Poké Balls were introduced, which make Pokémon catching easier in certain situations. A new item called the was introduced, functioning as a watch, map, radio, and phone, allowing the player to call other characters who offer their phone number. Trainers will call for a rematch and others will call about rare Pokémon that can be caught in a certain area.\n\nThe games introduce Raikou, Entei, and Suicune, some new types of legendary Pokémon that wander around Johto, changing locations frequently. They can be tracked by the Pokédex once encountered, and will always attempt to flee, but will retain HP loss. In addition there is the possibility of encountering a shiny Pokémon, which have a different coloration than normal Pokémon of their species, and appear very rarely. Two new Pokémon types were added, the Steel-type and the Dark-type. Steel-type Pokémon are immune to Poison-type moves, and they have very high defense and resistance to other types, while Dark-type Pokémon are immune to Psychic-type moves and are strong against Psychic-type Pokémon (which provides an offensive strategy, formerly absent against Psychic-types), as well as having few weaknesses. In \"Gold\" and \"Silver\", new moves were added, but Pokémon knowing these moves are not allowed to be traded to the first generation games. To solve this, a move deleter was introduced, capable of erasing moves known by the Pokémon. Another major change was the splitting of the \"Special\" stat into \"Special Attack\" and \"Special Defense\", which increased aspects of strategy.\n\nWith the introduction of Pokémon breeding, Pokémon are assigned to one or two breeding groups. When a male and female Pokémon that share at least one breeding group are left at a Pokémon Daycare, they may produce an egg, which will hatch into a young Pokémon. The young Pokémon will inherit the species of its mother, and moves from its father. However, legendary Pokémon, among certain other species, cannot breed.\n\n\"Pokémon Gold\" and \"Silver\" are set in the region of Johto, situated to the west of the Kanto region from the previous \"Red\" and \"Blue\" games, and three years after the conclusion of the previous games. The design of Johto was inspired by Japan's Kansai and Tōkai regions, with many of the region's temples and more traditional Japanese aesthetics finding their way into Johto.\n\nAs with the previous games, the player character receives his first Pokémon, a choice between Chikorita, Cyndaquil, and Totodile, from the region's local Pokémon scientist Professor Elm and then begins his journey to win the eight Gym Badges of the Johto region and then challenge the Elite Four and Champion to become the region's new Pokémon Master. Opposing him is his mysterious rival, a boy who stole one of the other Pokémon from Professor Elm and regularly challenges the player to test his strengths. The player also encounters the villainous Team Rocket, having reunited to seek out their previous leader Giovanni to return the group to their former glory. After the player defeats Team Rocket once and for all and defeats the Elite Four and Champion of the Pokémon League on Indigo Plateau, the player can then travel to the Kanto region from the previous games and challenge the Gym Leaders there, discovering how much has changed in the three years following the events of \"Red\" and \"Blue\". After defeating the Kanto region's Gym Leaders, the player is allowed to enter the treacherous Mt. Silver area, home to very powerful Pokémon, and deep within Mt. Silver's caves is Red, the protagonist of \"Red\" and \"Blue\", who the player can challenge for the most difficult battle in the game.\n\n\"Gold\" and \"Silver\" were first publicly showcased at the 1997 Nintendo Space World Expo in Japan, becoming the most popular exhibit at the program. Unlike the previous game in the series, \"Pokémon Yellow\", the new titles were announced to be more than a small upgrade to \"Pokémon Red\" and \"Blue\". Instead, they would feature a new storyline, a new world, and new species of Pokémon. \"Gold\" and \"Silver\" were designed for the Game Boy Color, allowing them full color support and more detailed sprites. Other additions that were shown included Pokémon breeding, held items, an in-game gadget known as the PokéGear, a real-time internal clock, and backward compatibility with the previous games in the series.\n\nDuring an \"ABC News\" interview, president of Creatures Inc. Tsunekazu Ishihara gave insight into the brainstorming process for developing new Pokémon species. He explained, \"The ideas for each of these monsters came from the imagination of the software developers at Game Freak who get these ideas from their childhood experiences, including from reading Manga, the name for Japanese comic books. Ideas come from scary experiences they had as kids, catching insects, and so forth. So from these experiences in childhood, these ideas for Pokemon came out\". In the same vein as the Pokémon Mew of the \"Red\" and \"Blue\" versions, the exclusive Pokémon Celebi was implemented in the \"Gold\" and \"Silver\" games but is only accessible after attending a Nintendo promotional event. The first official event offering Celebi was Nintendo Space World 2000 in Japan, in which 100,000 attendees would be awarded the rare Pokémon. In order to be selected, players had to send in a postcard to enter a lottery for one of 100,000 certificates of Celebi, allowing them to enter the event and obtain it.\n\nIn an interview with Nintendo president Satoru Iwata, Ishihara stated that \"Gold\" and \"Silver\" started development right after \"\"Pokémon Red\" and \"Green\"\" were released in Japan. The original intention was to release the game in 1998, even synchronizing with the supposed end of the anime's . Development issues, worsened by Game Freak being sidetracked with \"Pokémon Stadium\" and the localization of the first generation, led the game to be postponed, and the original release slate was taken over by \"Pokémon Yellow\". Programmer Shigeki Morimoto stated that part of why development took three and a half years was due to being a small team of only four programmers. \n\nJunichi Masuda composed his music on an Amiga computer,\npresumably in a music tracker format, converted to MIDI data and converted again to the Game Boy Color.\n\nThe games were announced for release in Japan in November 1999 and at the same time a U.S. release date was estimated for September 2000. Nintendo announced the release of the Pocket Pikachu Color, a full-color portable digital pet similar to the one released the year before. The unit was made compatible with \"Gold\" and \"Silver\", allowing the transfer of in-game currency known as \"watt points\". Pocket Pikachu Color was slated for release in Japan on November 21, 1999, the same day as the release of \"Gold\" and \"Silver\". In addition, an officially licensed Pikachu-themed Game Link Cable developed by Kemco was set for release in Japan on November 18, 1999. The product functions like a normal Game Link Cable and consists of a yellow cable with a figure of Pikachu on one end, and a Poké Ball on the other.\n\nAnticipating high sales, Nintendo set its first production shipment for the games in Japan at three million, predicting that eventually more than eight million copies would be sold in the country alone. However, they were soon forced to cut the first shipment number in half following an earthquake in Taiwan, which Nintendo claimed had damaged their cartridge manufacturing facilities. Regardless, speculation arose that Nintendo was instead using the event as an excuse to limit shipment and keep the demand high.\n\nAs a precursor to the North American release, \"Gold\" and \"Silver\" were displayed for audiences to interact with at the 2000 American International Toy Fair in New York City. To further promote the games, Nintendo modified five Chrysler PT Cruisers to resemble the new Pokémon Lugia and had them driven around the U.S.A. The vehicles had fins and tails attached to them and were painted with logos and images of the Pokémon franchise. In addition, they were equipped with a television set hooked up to game consoles which allowed spectators to play \"Pokémon Puzzle League\", \"Hey You, Pikachu!\", and \"Pokémon Gold\" and \"Silver\". The television series \"Pokémon GS\", based on the games, was announced to be a part of the fall lineup on Kids' WB. The show would feature the same protagonist Ash Ketchum in a new region with different Pokémon species from the games. The Americanized names of the 100 new Pokémon were kept confidential by Nintendo, with the company releasing names periodically. The domain names 'pokemongold.com' and 'pokemonsilver.com' were registered for this very purpose, and such names released included Chikorita, Lugia, Ho-Oh, Togepi, Hoothoot, and Marill.\n\nIn May 2000 Nintendo announced the official North American release date of \"Gold\" and \"Silver\" to be on October 16 of that year. Nintendo started accepting pre-orders for the games in August, and announced that consumers who pre-ordered one of the games would receive a free CD-ROM with a Pokémon-themed web browser developed by MediaBrowser which featured floating Pokémon species and links to Pokémon sites. The application was available for download on the official Pokémon website. The games broke record sales as approximately 600,000 copies of them were pre-ordered in just two months, compared to \"Pokémon Yellow\"'s number of 150,000. As the release date neared, retailers such as Electronics Boutique reported receiving shipments of games earlier than October 16, and opted to sell them immediately; first giving them to pre-orderers and then selling the leftover copies. The games were obtainable as early as October 11.\n\n\"Pokémon Gold\" and \"Silver\" continued the enormous success of its predecessors, beginning the formation of Pokémon into a multi-billion dollar franchise. As of April 2000 roughly 6.5 million copies of the games had been sold in Japan. \"Silver\" proved to be the slightly more popular version, edging out \"Gold\" by approximately 100,000 copies. By the first week of their release in the U.S.A. the games had eclipsed \"Pokémon Yellow\"'s previous record sales of a little over 600,000 copies; selling a combined total of 1.4 million copies to become the fastest selling games ever. The commercial success was expected, as Peter Main, the executive vice president of sales and marketing, stated \"There's no question about it; kids love to play Pokemon. So far in 2000 the best-selling game in America for any home console is Pokemon Stadium for Nintendo 64, and the best-selling game for any handheld video game system is Pokemon Yellow for Game Boy Color, but Pokemon Gold and Silver will eclipse even those impressive sales totals. We project sales of 10 million units total of these two games in less than six months time\". By 2010, the recorded sales of \"Gold\" and \"Silver\" were at 23 million units sold.\n\n\"Pokémon Gold\" and \"Silver\" was met with critical acclaim, with many saying that the extended length of gameplay and the new features were valued additions that kept the sequels as interesting as the original games. Craig Harris of IGN gave the games a \"masterful\" 10 out of 10 rating, stating that: \"As awesome as the original Pokémon edition was, \"Pokémon Gold\" and \"Silver\" blow it away in gameplay elements, features, and goodies. There are so many little additions to the design it's impossible to list them all\". There was particular praise given to the innovative internal clock feature, with Frank Povo of GameSpot, noting: \"The first major addition to Pokémon GS is the presence of a time element... Although it may sound like a gimmick, the addition of a clock adds quite a bit of variety to the game\". Povo went on to give the games a \"great\" 8.8 rating. \"Nintendo Power\" listed the \"Gold\" and \"Silver\" versions of it combined as the sixth best Game Boy/Game Boy Color video game, praising it for its new Pokémon, features, and full-color graphics.\n\nOverall, \"Gold\" and \"Silver\" were stated to be solid gaming additions that would please a large audience. \"After playing the game dozens of hours, I really can't think of a bad point to make about \"Pokémon Gold\" and \"Silver\". Nintendo and Game Freak have tweaked the original and built a sequel that's long, challenging and tremendous fun to play. There's a reason why Pokémon is so popular, and \"Pokémon Gold\" and \"Silver\" is going to help the series move further into the 21st century\", said Harris.\n\n is an enhanced version of \"Pokémon Gold\" and \"Silver\", developed by Game Freak and published by Nintendo for the Game Boy Color. It was released in Japan on December 14, 2000, North America on July 29, 2001 and in Europe on November 2, 2001..\n\nThe plot and gameplay of \"Pokémon Crystal\" is largely the same as in \"Gold\" and \"Silver\", although it holds new features. It is the first game to allow players to choose the sex of their character, while previously the character was always male. Pokémon have animated sprites; for example, when a Cyndaquil enters battle, the flames on its back flicker. This feature was absent in \"Pokémon Ruby\" and \"Sapphire\" and \"Pokémon FireRed\" and \"LeafGreen\", but has appeared in all subsequent games starting with \"Pokémon Emerald\". In addition, a couple of subplots were added, one involving the legendary Pokémon Suicune, featured on the front cover of the game, and the other involving the Unown. The game's biggest addition was the Battle Tower, a new building which allows players to participate in \"Pokémon Stadium\"-like fights. The Japanese edition of the game was exclusively bundled with the , a device that allowed for connecting with other players via mobile phone.\n\n\"Pokémon Crystal\" was received well by critics, although many commented that there were just not enough new additions and features to significantly set it apart from \"Pokémon Gold\" and \"Silver\". Craig Harris of IGN gave the game an \"outstanding\" 9 out of 10 stating, \"The final (hopefully) Game Boy Color edition is definitely the version to get if you aren't already one of the upteenth billion owners of the previous games, with \"Crystal\"s slight updates to the design and graphics. But there's not much in this edition that makes it a \"must buy\" for folks who already own a copy or two of the previous editions\". In Japan, \"Famitsu\" magazine scored the game a 34 out of 40.\n\nOn January 26, 2018, \"Pokémon Crystal\" was released worldwide for the Nintendo 3DS Virtual Console. \n\nPokémon HeartGold Version and SoulSilver Version are enhanced remakes of \"Pokémon Gold\" and \"Silver\". The games are part of the \"Pokémon\" series of role-playing video games, and were developed by Game Freak and published by Nintendo for the Nintendo DS. First released in Japan on September 12, 2009, the games were later released to North America, Australia, and Europe during March 2010.\n\nGame director Shigeki Morimoto aimed to respect the feelings of those who played the previous games, while also ensuring that it felt like a new game to those that were introduced to the series in more recent years. Reception to the games was highly positive, the two being amongst the highest rated DS games of all time on Metacritic. Commercially, the two are among the best-selling Nintendo DS games of all time, with combined sales of 10 million units as of July 29, 2010.\n\n"}

This process is called re-identification.

{"id": "681579", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=681579", "title": "Quasiparticle", "text": "Quasiparticle\n\nIn physics, quasiparticles and collective excitations (which are closely related) are emergent phenomena that occur when a microscopically complicated system such as a solid behaves as if it contained different weakly interacting particles in free space. For example, as an electron travels through a semiconductor, its motion is disturbed in a complex way by its interactions with all of the other electrons and nuclei; however it approximately behaves like an electron with a different mass (effective mass) traveling unperturbed through free space. This \"electron with a different mass\" is called an \"electron quasiparticle\". In another example, the aggregate motion of electrons in the valence band of a semiconductor or a hole band in a metal is the same as if the material instead contained positively charged quasiparticles called electron holes. Other quasiparticles or collective excitations include phonons (particles derived from the vibrations of atoms in a solid), plasmons (particles derived from plasma oscillations), and many others.\n\nThese particles are typically called \"quasiparticles\" if they are related to fermions, and called \"collective excitations\" if they are related to bosons, although the precise distinction is not universally agreed upon. Thus, electrons and electron holes are typically called \"quasiparticles\", while phonons and plasmons are typically called \"collective excitations\".\n\nThe quasiparticle concept is most important in condensed matter physics since it is one of the few known ways of simplifying the quantum mechanical many-body problem.\n\nSolids are made of only three kinds of particles: electrons, protons, and neutrons. Quasiparticles are none of these; instead, each of them is an \"emergent phenomenon\" that occurs inside the solid. Therefore, while it is quite possible to have a single particle (electron or proton or neutron) floating in space, a quasiparticle can only exist inside interacting many-particle systems (primarily solids).\n\nMotion in a solid is extremely complicated: Each electron and proton is pushed and pulled (by Coulomb's law) by all the other electrons and protons in the solid (which may themselves be in motion). It is these strong interactions that make it very difficult to predict and understand the behavior of solids (see many-body problem). On the other hand, the motion of a \"non-interacting\" classical particle is relatively simple; it would move in a straight line at constant velocity. This is the motivation for the concept of quasiparticles: The complicated motion of the \"real\" particles in a solid can be mathematically transformed into the much simpler motion of imagined quasiparticles, which behave more like non-interacting particles.\n\nIn summary, quasiparticles are a mathematical tool for simplifying the description of solids.\n\nThe principal motivation for quasiparticles is that it is almost impossible to \"directly\" describe every particle in a macroscopic system. For example, a barely-visible (0.1mm) grain of sand contains around 10 nuclei and 10 electrons. Each of these attracts or repels every other by Coulomb's law. In principle, the Schrödinger equation predicts exactly how this system will behave. But the Schrödinger equation in this case is a partial differential equation (PDE) on a 3×10-dimensional vector space—one dimension for each coordinate (x,y,z) of each particle. Directly and straightforwardly trying to solve such a PDE is impossible in practice. Indeed, solving a PDE on a 2-dimensional space is typically much harder than solving a PDE on a 1-dimensional space (whether analytically or numerically); solving a PDE on a 3-dimensional space is significantly harder still; and thus solving a PDE on a 3×10-dimensional space is quite impossible by straightforward methods.\n\nOne simplifying factor is that the system as a whole, like any quantum system, has a ground state and various excited states with higher and higher energy above the ground state. In many contexts, only the \"low-lying\" excited states, with energy reasonably close to the ground state, are relevant. This occurs because of the Boltzmann distribution, which implies that very-high-energy thermal fluctuations are unlikely to occur at any given temperature.\n\nQuasiparticles and collective excitations are a type of low-lying excited state. For example, a crystal at absolute zero is in the ground state, but if one phonon is added to the crystal (in other words, if the crystal is made to vibrate slightly at a particular frequency) then the crystal is now in a low-lying excited state. The single phonon is called an \"elementary excitation\". More generally, low-lying excited states may contain any number of elementary excitations (for example, many phonons, along with other quasiparticles and collective excitations).\n\nWhen the material is characterized as having \"several elementary excitations\", this statement presupposes that the different excitations can be combined together. In other words, it presupposes that the excitations can coexist simultaneously and independently. This is never \"exactly\" true. For example, a solid with two identical phonons does not have exactly twice the excitation energy of a solid with just one phonon, because the crystal vibration is slightly anharmonic. However, in many materials, the elementary excitations are very \"close\" to being independent. Therefore, as a \"starting point\", they are treated as free, independent entities, and then corrections are included via interactions between the elementary excitations, such as \"phonon-phonon scattering\".\n\nTherefore, using quasiparticles / collective excitations, instead of analyzing 10 particles, one needs to deal with only a handful of somewhat-independent elementary excitations. It is, therefore, a very effective approach to simplify the many-body problem in quantum mechanics. This approach is not useful for \"all\" systems, however: In strongly correlated materials, the elementary excitations are so far from being independent that it is not even useful as a starting point to treat them as independent.\n\nUsually, an elementary excitation is called a \"quasiparticle\" if it is a fermion and a \"collective excitation\" if it is a boson. However, the precise distinction is not universally agreed upon.\n\nThere is a difference in the way that quasiparticles and collective excitations are intuitively envisioned. A quasiparticle is usually thought of as being like a dressed particle: It is built around a real particle at its \"core\", but the behavior of the particle is affected by the environment. A standard example is the \"electron quasiparticle\": A real electron particle, in a crystal, behaves as if it had a different mass. On the other hand, a collective excitation is usually imagined to be a reflection of the aggregate behavior of the system, with no single real particle at its \"core\". A standard example is the phonon, which characterizes the vibrational motion of every atom in the crystal.\n\nHowever, these two visualizations leave some ambiguity. For example, a magnon in a ferromagnet can be considered in one of two perfectly equivalent ways: (a) as a mobile defect (a misdirected spin) in a perfect alignment of magnetic moments or (b) as a quantum of a collective spin wave that involves the precession of many spins. In the first case, the magnon is envisioned as a quasiparticle, in the second case, as a collective excitation. However, both (a) and (b) are equivalent and correct descriptions. As this example shows, the intuitive distinction between a quasiparticle and a collective excitation is not particularly important or fundamental.\n\nThe problems arising from the collective nature of quasiparticles have also been discussed within the philosophy of science, notably in relation to the identity conditions of quasiparticles and whether they should be considered \"real\" by the standards of, for example, entity realism.\n\nBy investigating the properties of individual quasiparticles, it is possible to obtain a great deal of information about low-energy systems, including the flow properties and heat capacity.\n\nIn the heat capacity example, a crystal can store energy by forming phonons, and/or forming excitons, and/or forming plasmons, etc. Each of these is a separate contribution to the overall heat capacity.\n\nThe idea of quasiparticles originated in Lev Landau's theory of Fermi liquids, which was originally invented for studying liquid helium-3. For these systems a strong similarity exists between the notion of quasiparticle and dressed particles in quantum field theory. The dynamics of Landau's theory is defined by a kinetic equation of the mean-field type. A similar equation, the Vlasov equation, is valid for a plasma in the so-called plasma approximation. In the plasma approximation, charged particles are considered to be moving in the electromagnetic field collectively generated by all other particles, and hard collisions between the charged particles are neglected. When a kinetic equation of the mean-field type is a valid first-order description of a system, second-order corrections determine the entropy production, and generally take the form of a Boltzmann-type collision term, in which figure only \"far collisions\" between virtual particles. In other words, every type of mean-field kinetic equation, and in fact every mean-field theory, involves a quasiparticle concept.\n\nThis section contains examples of quasiparticles and collective excitations. The first subsection below contains common ones that occur in a wide variety of materials under ordinary conditions; the second subsection contains examples that arise only in special contexts.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "18410383", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18410383", "title": "Secular morality", "text": "Secular morality\n\nSecular morality is the aspect of philosophy that deals with morality outside of religious traditions. Modern examples include humanism, freethinking, and most versions of consequentialism. Additional philosophies with ancient roots include those such as skepticism and virtue ethics. Greg M. Epstein also states that, \"much of ancient Far Eastern thought is deeply concerned with human goodness without placing much if any stock in the importance of gods or spirits.\" An example is the non-denominational Kural text of Valluvar, an ancient Indian theistic poet-philosopher whose work remains secular. Other philosophers have proposed various ideas about how to determine right and wrong actions. An example is Immanuel Kant's categorical imperative.\n\nA variety of positions are apparent regarding the relationship between religion and morality. Some believe that religion is necessary as a guide to a moral life. According to some, this idea has been with us for nearly 2,000 years. Others suggest this idea goes back at least 2,600 years as exemplified in Psalm 14 of the Hebrew Bible. According to others, the idea goes back as far as 4,000 years, with the ancient Egyptians' 42 Principles of Ma'at. \n\nOthers eschew the idea that religion is required to provide a guide to right and wrong behavior. The \"Westminster Dictionary of Christian Ethics\" however states that religion and morality \"are to be defined differently and have no definitional connections with each other\". Some believe that religions provide poor guides to moral behavior. Various commentators, such as Richard Dawkins (\"The God Delusion\"), Sam Harris (\"The End of Faith\") and Christopher Hitchens (\"God Is Not Great\") are among those who have asserted this view.\n\n\"Consequentialists\", as described by Peter Singer, \"start not with moral rules, but with goals. They assess actions by the extent to which they further those goals.\" Singer also notes that utilitarianism is \"the best-known, though not the only, consequentialist theory.\" Consequentialism is the class of normative ethical theories holding that the consequences of one's conduct are the ultimate basis for any judgment about the rightness of that conduct. Thus, from a consequentialist standpoint, a morally right act (or omission) is one that will produce a good outcome, or consequence. In his 2010 book, \"The Moral Landscape\", Sam Harris describes a utilitarian science of morality.\n\nFreethought is a philosophical viewpoint that holds that opinions should be formed on the basis of science, logic, and reason, and should not be influenced by authority, tradition, or other dogmas. Freethinkers strive to build their opinions on the basis of facts, scientific inquiry, and logical principles, independent of any logical fallacies or intellectually limiting effects of authority, confirmation bias, cognitive bias, conventional wisdom, popular culture, prejudice, sectarianism, tradition, urban legend, and all other dogmas.\n\nSecular humanism focuses on the way human beings can lead happy and functional lives. It posits that human beings are capable of being ethical and moral without religion or God, it neither assumes humans to be inherently evil or innately good, nor presents humans as \"above nature\" or superior to it. Rather, the humanist life stance emphasizes the unique responsibility facing humanity and the ethical consequences of human decisions. Fundamental to the concept of secular humanism is the strongly held viewpoint that ideology—be it religious or political—must be thoroughly examined by each individual and not simply accepted or rejected on faith. Along with this, an essential part of secular humanism is a continually adapting search for truth, primarily through science and philosophy.\n\nThe subject of secular morality has been discussed by prominent secular scholars as well as popular culture-based atheist and anti-religious writers. These include Paul Chamberlain's \"Can We Be Good Without God?\" (1996), Richard Holloway's \" Godless Morality: Keeping Religion Out of Ethics\" (1999), Robert Buckman's \"Can We Be Good Without God?\" (2002), Michael Shermer's \"The Science of Good and Evil\" (2004), Richard Dawkins's \"The God Delusion\" (2006), Christopher Hitchens's \"God Is Not Great\" (2007), Greg Epstein's \"Good Without God: What A Billion Nonreligious People \"Do\" Believe\" (2010), and Sam Harris's \"The Moral Landscape: How Science Can Determine Human Values\" (2011).\n\nAccording to Greg Epstein, \"the idea that we can't be 'good without God' \" has been with us for nearly 2,000 years. Others suggest this idea goes back further; for example in Psalm 14 of the Hebrew Bible which according to Hermann Gunkel date to the exile period of approximately 580 BCE. It states, \"The fool says in his heart, 'there is no God.' They are corrupt, they do abominable deeds, there is none who does good ... not even one.\" \n\nFriedrich Nietzsche famously declared God is Dead but also warned \"When one gives up the Christian faith, one pulls the right to Christian morality out from under one's feet. This morality is by no means self-evident...Christianity is a system, a whole view of things thought out together. By breaking one main concept out of it, the faith in God, one breaks the whole.\" \n\nThis idea is still present today. \"Many today ... argue that religious beliefs are necessary to provide moral guidance and standards of virtuous conduct in an otherwise corrupt, materialistic, and degenerate world.\" For example, Christian writer and medievalist C. S. Lewis made the argument in his popular book \"Mere Christianity\" that if a supernatural, objective standard of right and wrong does not exist outside of the natural world, then right and wrong becomes mired in the is-ought problem. Thus, he wrote, preferences for one moral standard over another become as inherently indefensible and arbitrary as preferring a certain flavor of food over another or choosing to drive on a certain side of a road. In the same vein, Christian theologian Ron Rhodes has remarked that \"it is impossible to distinguish evil from good unless one has an infinite reference point which is absolutely good.\" Peter Singer states that, \"Traditionally, the more important link between religion and ethics was that religion was thought to provide a reason for doing what is right, the reason being that those who are virtuous will be rewarded by an eternity of bliss while the rest roast in hell.\"\n\nProponents of theism argue that without a God or gods it is impossible to \"justify\" moral behavior on metaphysical grounds and thus to make a coherent case for abiding by moral standards. C. S. Lewis makes such an argument in \"Mere Christianity\". Peter Robinson, a political author and commentator with Stanford's Hoover Institution, has commented that, if an inner moral conscience is just another adaptive or evolved feeling in the human mind like simple emotional urges, then no inherent reason exists to consider morality as over and above other urges.\nAccording to Thomas Dixon, \"Religions certainly do provide a framework within which people can learn the difference between right and wrong.\"\n\nVarious commentators have stated that morality does not require religion as a guide. \"The Westminster Dictionary of Christian Ethics\" states that, \"it is not hard to imagine a society of people that has no religion but has a morality, as well as a legal system, just because it says that people cannot live together without rules against killing, etc., and that it is not desirable for these all to be legally enforced. There have also certainly been people who have had a morality but no religious beliefs.\" Bernard Williams, an English philosopher, stated that the secular \"utilitarian outlook\"—a popular ethical position wherein the morally right action is defined as that action which effects the greatest amount of happiness or pleasure for the greatest number of people—is \"non-transcendental, and makes no appeal outside human life, in particular not to religious considerations.\" Williams also argued that, \"Either one's motives for following the moral word of God are moral motives, or they are not. If they are, then one is already equipped with moral motivations, and the introduction of God adds nothing extra. But if they are not moral motives, then they will be motives of such a kind that they cannot appropriately motivate \"morality\" at all ... we reach the conclusion that any appeal to God in this connection either adds to nothing at all, or it adds the wrong sort of thing.\"\n\nSocrates' \"Euthyphro dilemma\" is often considered one of the earliest refutations of the idea that morality requires religion. This line of reasoning is described by Peter Singer:\n\nGreg Epstein, a Humanist chaplain at Harvard University, dismisses the question of whether God is needed to be good \"because that question does not need to be answered—it needs to be rejected outright,\" adding, \"To suggest that one \"can't\" be good without belief in God is not just an opinion ... it is a prejudice. It may even be discrimination.\" This is in line with the \"Westminster Dictionary of Christian Ethics\" which states that religion and morality \"are to be defined differently and have no definitional connections with each other. Conceptually and in principle, morality and a religious value system are two distinct kinds of value systems or action guides.\" Others share this view. Singer states that morality \"is not something intelligible only in the context of religion\". Atheistic philosopher Julian Baggini stated that \"there is nothing to stop atheists believing in morality, a meaning for life, or human goodness. Atheism is only intrinsically negative when it comes to belief about God. It is as capable of a positive view of other aspects of life as any other belief.\" He also states that \"Morality is more than possible without God, it is entirely independent of him. That means atheists are not only more than capable of leading moral lives, they may even be able to lead more moral lives than religious believers who confuse divine law and punishment with right and wrong.\n\nPopular atheist author and \"Vanity Fair\" writer Christopher Hitchens remarked on the program \"Uncommon Knowledge\":\nPhilosopher Daniel Dennett says that secular organizations need to learn more 'marketing' lessons from religion—and from effective secular organizations like the TED conferences. This is partly because Dennett says that the idea that people need God to be morally good is an extremely harmful, yet popular myth. He believes it is a falsehood that persists because churches are currently much better at organizing people to do morally good work. In Dennett's words: \nPopular atheist author and biologist Richard Dawkins, writing in \"The God Delusion\", has stated that religious people have committed a wide variety of acts and held certain beliefs through history that are considered today to be morally repugnant. He has stated that Adolf Hitler and the Nazis held broadly Christian religious beliefs that inspired the Holocaust on account of antisemitic Christian doctrine, that Christians have traditionally imposed unfair restrictions on the legal and civil rights of women, and that Christians have condoned slavery of some form or description throughout most of Christianity's history. Dawkins insists that, since Jewish and Christian interpretations of the Bible have changed over the span of history so that what was formerly seen as permissible is now seen as impermissible, it is intellectually dishonest for them to believe theism provides an absolute moral foundation apart from secular intuition. In addition, he argued that since Christians and other religious groups do not acknowledge the binding authority of all parts of their holy texts (e.g., The books of Exodus and Leviticus state that those who work on the Sabbath and those caught performing acts of homosexuality, respectively, were to be put to death.), they are already capable of distinguishing \"right\" from \"wrong.\"\n\nThe well-known passage from Dostoyevsky's \"The Brothers Karamazov\", \"If God is dead, all is permitted,\" suggests that non-believers would not hold moral lives without the possibility of punishment by a God. Greg M. Epstein notes a similar theme in reverse. Famous apologies by Christians who have \"sinned\" (such as Bill Clinton and Jimmy Swaggart) \"must embolden some who take enormous risks for the thrill of a little immoral behavior: their Lord will forgive them, if they only ask nicely enough when—or if—they are eventually caught. If you're going to do something naughty, you're going to do it, and all the theology in the world isn't going to stop you.\" Some survey and sociological literature suggests that theists do no better than their secular counterparts in the percentage adhering to widely held moral standards (e.g., lying, theft and sexual infidelity).\n\nSome non-religious nihilistic and existentialist thinkers have affirmed the prominent theistic position that the existence of the personal God of theism is linked to the existence of an objective moral standard, asserting that questions of right and wrong inherently have no meaning and, thus, any notions of morality are nothing but an anthropogenic fantasy. Agnostic author and Absurdist philosopher Albert Camus discussed the issue of what he saw as the universe's indifference towards humankind and the meaninglessness of life in his prominent novel \"The Stranger\", in which the protagonist accepts death via execution without sadness or feelings of injustice. In his philosophical work, \"The Myth of Sisyphus\", Camus argues that human beings must choose to live defiantly in spite of their longing for purpose or direction and the apparent lack of evidence for God or moral imperatives. The atheistic existentialist philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre proposed that the individual must create his own essence and therefore must freely and independently create his own subjective moral standards by which to live.\n\nCases can also be seen in nature of animals exhibiting behavior we might classify as \"moral\" without religious directives to guide them. These include \"detailed studies of the complex systems of altruism and cooperation that operate among social insects\" and \"the posting of altruistic sentinels by some species of bird and mammal, who risk their own lives to warn the rest of the group of imminent danger.\"\n\nGreg Epstein states that \"sociologists have recently begun to pay more attention to the fact that some of the world's most secular countries, such as those in Scandinavia, are among the least violent, best educated, and most likely to care for the poor\". He adds that, \"scientists are beginning to document, though religion may have benefits for the brain, so may secularism and Humanism.\"\n\nOn April 26, 2012, the results of a study which tested their subjects' pro-social sentiments were published in the Social Psychological and Personality Science journal in which non-religious people had higher scores showing that they were more inclined to show generosity in random acts of kindness, such as lending their possessions and offering a seat on a crowded bus or train. Religious people also had lower scores when it came to seeing how much compassion motivated participants to be charitable in other ways, such as in giving money or food to a homeless person and to non-believers. But, global research done by Gallup between 2006 and 2008 on people from 145 countries give the opposite results. According to research, adherents of all the major world religions who attended religious services in the past week got higher rates of generosity such as donating money, volunteering, and helping a stranger than do their coreligionists who did not attend services (non-attenders).For the people who were nonreligious, but said that they attended religious services in the past week exhibited more generous behaviors than those who did not. Another global study by Gallup showed that highly religious people are more likely to help others in terms of donating money, volunteering, and helping strangers despite of having, on average, lower incomes than those who are less religious or nonreligious who reported higher incomes. In the research, it is said that cannot conclusively attribute these helping behaviors to the direct influence of religiosity, but that it is intuitive that religious people are more likely to engage in helping behaviors because values promoted by religions such as selflessness and generosity.\n\nA number of studies have been conducted on the empirics of morality in various countries, and the overall relationship between faith and crime is unclear. A 2001 review of studies on this topic found \"The existing evidence surrounding the effect of religion on crime is varied, contested, and inconclusive, and currently no persuasive answer exists as to the empirical relationship between religion and crime.\" Phil Zuckerman's 2008 book, \"Society without God\", notes that Denmark and Sweden, \"which are probably the least religious countries in the world, and possibly in the history of the world\", enjoy \"among the lowest violent crime rates in the world [and] the lowest levels of corruption in the world\". Dozens of studies have been conducted on this topic since the twentieth century. A 2005 study by Gregory S. Paul published in the \"Journal of Religion and Society\" stated that, \"In general, higher rates of belief in and worship of a creator correlate with higher rates of homicide, juvenile and early adult mortality, STD infection rates, teen pregnancy, and abortion in the prosperous democracies,\" and \"In all secular developing democracies a centuries long-term trend has seen homicide rates drop to historical lows\" with the exceptions being the United States (with a high religiosity level) and \"theistic\" Portugal. In a response, Gary Jensen builds on and refines Paul's study. His conclusion is that a \"complex relationship\" exists between religiosity and homicide \"with some\ndimensions of religiosity encouraging homicide and other dimensions discouraging it\".\n\n\n"}

{"id": "10869371", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10869371", "title": "Supercompensation", "text": "Supercompensation\n\nIn sports science theory, supercompensation is the post training period during which the trained function/parameter has a higher performance capacity than it did prior to the training period.\n\nThe fitness level of a human body in training can be broken down into four periods: initial fitness, parietal fitness training, recovery, and supercompensation. During the initial fitness period, the target of the training has a base level of fitness (shown by the first time sector in the graph). Upon entering the training period, the target's level of fitness decreases (shown by the second time sector in the graph). After training, the body enters the recovery period during which level of fitness increases up to the initial fitness level (shown by the third time sector in the graph). Because the human body is an adjustable organism, it will feel the need to adjust itself to a higher level of fitness in anticipation of the next training session. Accordingly, the increase in fitness following a training session does not stop at the initial fitness level. Instead the body enters a period of supercompensation during which fitness surpasses the initial fitness level (shown by the fourth time sector in the graph). If there are no further workouts, this fitness level will slowly decline back towards the initial fitness level (shown by the last time sector in the graph). First put forth by Russian scientist Nikolai N. Yakovlev (1911–1992) in 1949-1959, this theory is a basic principle of athletic training.\n\nIf the next workout takes place during the recovery period, overtraining may occur. If the next workout takes place during the supercompensation period, the body will advance to a higher level of fitness. If the next workout takes place after the supercompensation period, the body will remain at the base level.\n\nMore complex variations are possible; for instance, sometimes a few workouts are intentionally made in the recovery period to achieve greater supercompensation effects.\n\nAt a first glance, creating effective training programs might look simple. All you need is to determine the intensity level and how long it takes you to get to the supercompensation period. Afterwards, continue training with the intensity level that was determined previously and keep the necessary intervals between workouts required for supercompensation. However, things become more complex because training affects many different bodily functions and parameters. Each bodily function or parameter has a different recovery time, a different amount of time needed to reach peak supercompensation, a different amount of time between supercompensation peak and return to base fitness.\n\nThe aforementioned functions and parameters are basic ones. Muscle strength and mass are complex parameters. For instance, muscle mass is a function of many different simple parameters. For example, amount of glycogen in muscles is a basic parameter that influences muscle mass.\n\nIn classical sport science, the yearly (sometimes multi-yearly) period is divided to micro and macro cycles, where each microcycle is responsible for the development of a specific (sometimes several) basic training function and parameter, whereas macrocycles are responsible for the development of complex parameters/functions (such as muscle strength). During each microcycle, the resting period is the same as the amount of time needed for reaching the supercompensation stage of the current training parameter/function (also during such a micro cycle there shouldn't be any negative influence on the recovery of the main function). Such a training method will work only when the developed functions/parameters are non-related. Unfortunately, for muscle strength and mass this is not the case (functions/parameters are related). Therefore, for muscle strength and mass different approaches are needed. During a training cycle the intensity and volume of training varies, waves of different functions are overlaid so that until the end of the microcycle supercompensation of the main required functions is achieved.\n\n"}

TechnoSphere, created by Jane Prophet and Dr Gordon Selley, was a place where users from around the globe could create creatures and release them into the 3D environment, described by the creators as a \"digital ecology.\" Earlier incarnations of TechnoSphere didn't have the advantage of web-accessible 3D graphics, but was still governed by chaos theory and similar algorithms that determined each creature's unique behavior based on their components and interactions with each other and their environment. This online program was one of many digital artificial life simulations that evolved as the World Wide Web began to grow. Many museums and classrooms found the tool to be a valuable complement to learning material on natural selection and ecosystems. The experiment operated online until 2002 and was unavailable until January 15, 2007 when it was launched again but as of November 2012 is again off-line.\nTechnoSphere was a real-time, 3D simulation of an environment that was populated by virtual creatures. Users across the globe had the capability to create their own creatures through a website. TechnoSphere III, one of many incarnations of the original design, used an artificial life program and fractal landscapes, which were governed by a complex set of rules and algorithms that determined how the virtual ecosystem reacted. The program was capable of modeling such concepts as simple evolution and carrying capacity. Despite limited available creature designs, no two would ever behave in the same way, due to chance interactions with its environment and other creatures.\n\nPhysically, the virtual landscape of TechnoSphere consisted of 16 km² of terrain. It was capable of supporting approximately 4,000 creatures, though other sources suggest that as many as 20,000 creatures typically would coexist in the virtual environment at one time. After the relaunch, it was explicitly stated that the software limited the number of creatures at 200,000. Because each creature's behavior was unique, no single event could have been predicted, though some significant patterns developed. For example, even though there was no explicit flocking algorithm written into the program, creatures could be found organizing themselves into groups, most likely impelled by urges to mate and eat. The programs that supported the website were scalable, and could be modified to support a larger or smaller community of creatures.\n\nUsers accessing the site were able to create their own artificial life forms, building carnivores or herbivores from a select few component parts (heads, bodies, eyes, and wheels). Their \"digital DNA\" was linked to each component and the completed creature's attributes (speed, visual perception, rate of digestion, etc.) was determined by the combination of each feature's strengths and weaknesses—their \"fitness for survival.\" Once a creature design was finished, users would name their digital creature, tag it with their e-mail address, and enter it into the digital environment.\n\nThere they chased or evaded each other, ate, grew, and mated. They also produced offspring, which were variants of the parents, sometimes incorporating aspects of both parents and other times favoring one parent creature's attributes over the others. General behavior patterns had emerged, but it was difficult to predict what was going to happen based solely on a creature's design. The one thing all TechnoSphere creatures did have in common was that they would all eventually die.\n\nThere was only one gender in TechnoSphere, so the creature that initiated mating was the parent that ended up carrying and caring for the offspring. Creature behavior was directed by a set of algorithms called Creature Comforts, designed by Julian Saunderson. It dictated, for example, that mating behavior (recombination of digital DNA) could only be initiated if both creatures' hunger was at least 50% satiated.\n\nWhen significant events occurred in the TechnoSphere, a user's creature would send brief email messages \"home.\" Users were also able to visit the website and view 2D snapshots of their creature, check family trees, \"world\" statistics, and search for other creatures and their users.\n\nOne report described the project's popularity by citing that the online version had attracted over a 100,000 users who had created 3,286,148 and growing creatures. Over the years in which the website was operating, the growing popularity facilitated necessary updates to the server software and hardware, causing website downtime and often slow response times.\n\nMany museums and educators found the digital ecology interesting and some teachers even used TechnoSphere as a teaching tool. The technological innovations and digital images produced by the project were of such interest that temporary installations were put in at several museums, including the National Museum of Photography, Film and Television (now the National Media Museum) (Bradford, UK), Casula Powerhouse Arts Centre (Sydney, Australia), and the Donald R. and Joan F. Beall Center for Art and Technology at the University of California, Irvine (Irvine, California, US). Museum visitors created creatures using touchscreen terminals and then released them immediately into the TechnoSphere. Once in the digital environment, the creatures could be observed within the world on a series of large projection screens, further expanding the popularity of the project.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "12344752", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12344752", "title": "The Monument to the Unknown Soldier", "text": "The Monument to the Unknown Soldier\n\nThe Monument to the Unknown Soldier (Arabic: نصب الجندي المجهول) is a monument in central Baghdad built by Italian architect, Marcello D'Olivo, based on a concept by Iraqi sculptor, Khaled al-Rahal, and constructed between 1979 and 1982. It was dedicated to the martyrs of the Iran–Iraq War. In 1986 the national square of Iraq, Great Celebrations square, was built near the monument, and two other monuments were built close to the square in memory of the matyrs. In 1983, the Al-Shaheed Monument on the River, was opened and in 1989 the newly built Victory Arch became the entrances to the square. The \"Unknown Soldier's Monument\" represents a traditional shield (dira¹a) dropping from the dying grasp of an Iraqi warrior. The monument also houses an underground museum.\n\nThe \"Monument to the Unknown Soldier\" was commissioned in 1979 and completed in 1982. It was part of a broader Ba'athist government program to build a number of public works that would help instil a sense of national pride, and at the same time immortalise Saddam Hussein's reputation as a powerful leader. Saddam turned to his favourite artist, Khaled al-Rahal, who did more than any other Iraqi artist to incorporate ancient motifs in his work, to devise the concept for the monument.\n\nFollowing the construction of the \"Monument to the Unknown Soldier,\" another colossal structure, the \"Al-Shaheed Monument\" (1983) was opened in the same area, and Saddam commissioned a third monument, the \"Victory Arch,\" another concept, also by the sculptor, Khaled Al-Rahal, to be built in the same vicinity (commenced in 1983 and completed in 1989 after the sculptor's death). The three monuments form a visual and psychological unit, and all represent the pain and suffering of the eight-year war.\n\nThe original concept was the work of Iraqi sculptor, Khaled al-Rahal, with the architectural designs developed by the Italian architect, Marcello D'Olivo.\n\nThe monument sits on top of an artificial hill, shaped like a low, truncated cone of 250 m diameter. The monument itself consists of several elements grouped on the hilltop. The centrepiece is a cantilevered dome, 42 m in diameter, with an inclination of 12 degrees and made of reinforced concrete. The dome represents a \"dira'a\" (Iraqi shield) falling from the grasp of a dying warrior.\n\nAt the side of the dome, is a spiral tower, which is reminiscent of the minaret at Samarra. Its external surface is clad with copper, while its inner surface features a soffit finished with pyramidal modules alternating steel and copper. The promenade is covered by a semi-circular, flat roof supported on a triangular steel bracing. The roof is covered with a copper sheet and the soffit displays V-shaped panels of stainless steel and Murano glass. It is surrounded by slanting girders of triangular section that are covered with marble. Red granite, stepped platforms of elliptical form lead to the dome and cubic sculpture. The steel flagpole is entirely covered with Murano glass panels fixed on stainless steel arms and displaying the national flag colours.\n\nBeneath the shield is a cube, made of seven layers of metal, said to represent the seven levels of Jannah in the Islamic faith. Inside the layers of metal are sheets of red acrylic, said to represent the blood of the slain Iraqi soldiers. The cube itself is connected to the underground museum by a long shaft with windows that allow light to shine in from above. Inside the museum, visitors can look up at the ceiling and see through the openings leading to the cube above.\n\nThe monument appeared on the Iraqi dinar bank-note in the 1990-2003 series (pictured). \nThe 1982 \"Monument to the Unknown Soldier\" was not the first of such monuments to be constructed in Baghdad. In 1959, an arched monument to the Unknown Soldier was erected in Baghdad's Firdos Square. It was designed by Iraqi architect, Rifat Chadirji, and was a modern adaption of the arch of Ctesiphon in the ancient capital of the Parthian Empire. \n\nSketches of the design found at the Institute of Fine Arts in Baghdad, reveal the inspiration for the design which represents a mother bending over to pick up her martyred child. Described as a simple, symbolic, modernist structure, a comparison between the original and its later replacement illustrates the increasing level of abstraction and sophistication in Iraqi art during the period. \n\nThe original was removed from al-Fardous Square to make way for a statue of Saddam Hussein in the early 1980s. The replacement statue was destroyed by the American forces after they captured Baghdad in 2003 while the world watched via television. \n\nReports that Chadirji had been invited to rebuild the monument circulated for many years, but no progress has been evident, and the elderly Chadirji has since emigrated to England, where he lives with his wife.\n\n\n"}

It consists of a tiger shark preserved in formaldehyde in a vitrine. It was originally commissioned in 1991 by Charles Saatchi, who sold it in 2004, to Steven A. Cohen for an undisclosed amount, widely reported to have been at least $8 million. However, the title of Don Thompson's book, \"The $12 Million Stuffed Shark: The Curious Economics of Contemporary Art\", suggests a higher figure.\n\nOwing to deterioration of the original tiger shark, it was replaced with a new specimen in 2006. It was on loan to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City from 2007 to 2010.\n\nIt is considered the iconic work of British art in the 1990s, and has become a symbol of Britart worldwide.\n\nThe work was funded by Charles Saatchi, who in 1991 had offered to pay for whatever artwork Hirst wanted to create. The shark itself cost Hirst £6,000 and the total cost of the work was £50,000. The shark was caught off Hervey Bay in Queensland, Australia, by a fisherman commissioned to do so. Hirst wanted something \"big enough to eat you\".\nIt was first exhibited in 1992 in the first of a series of \"Young British Artists\" shows at the Saatchi Gallery, then at its premises in St John's Wood, north London. The British tabloid newspaper \"The Sun\" ran a story titled \"£50,000 for fish without chips.\" The show also included Hirst's artwork \"A Thousand Years\". He was then nominated for the Turner Prize, but it was awarded to Grenville Davey. Saatchi sold the work in 2004 to Steven A. Cohen for an estimated $8 million.\n\nIts technical specifications are: \"Tiger shark, glass, steel, 5% formaldehyde solution, 213 × 518 × 213 cm.\"\n\n\"The New York Times\" in 2007 gave the following description of the artwork:\n\nMr. Hirst often aims to fry the mind (and misses more than he hits), but he does so by setting up direct, often visceral experiences, of which the shark remains the most outstanding.\n\nIn keeping with the piece's title, the shark is simultaneously life and death incarnate in a way you don't quite grasp until you see it, suspended and silent, in its tank. It gives the innately demonic urge to live a demonic, deathlike form.\n\nBecause the shark was initially preserved poorly, it began to deteriorate and the surrounding liquid grew murky. Hirst attributes some of the decay to the fact that the Saatchi Gallery had added bleach to it. In 1993 the gallery gutted the shark and stretched its skin over a fiberglass mold, and Hirst commented, \"It didn't look as frightening ... You could tell it wasn't real. It had no weight.\" When Hirst learned of Saatchi's impending sale of the work to Cohen, he offered to replace the shark, an operation which Cohen then funded, calling the expense \"inconsequential\" (the formaldehyde process alone cost around $100,000). Another shark was caught off Queensland (a female aged about 25–30 years, equivalent to middle age) and shipped to Hirst in a 2-month journey. Oliver Crimmen, a scientist and fish curator at London's Natural History Museum, assisted with the preservation of the new specimen in 2006. This involved injecting formaldehyde into the body, as well as soaking it for two weeks in a bath of 7% formalin solution. The original 1991 vitrine was then used to house it.\n\nA philosophical question was acknowledged by Hirst, as to whether the replacement shark meant that the result could still be considered the same artwork. He observed:\nIt's a big dilemma. Artists and conservators have different opinions about what's important: the original artwork or the original intention. I come from a conceptual art background, so I think it should be the intention. It's the same piece. But the jury will be out for a long time to come.\n\nHirst has made other works subsequently which also feature a preserved shark in formaldehyde in a vitrine. In September 2008, \"The Kingdom\", a tiger shark, sold at Hirst's Sotheby's auction, \"Beautiful Inside My Head Forever\", for £9.6 million (more than £3 million above its estimate).\n\nHirst has made a miniature version of \"The Physical Impossibility of Death in the Mind of Someone Living\" for the Miniature Museum in the Netherlands. In this case he put a guppy in a box (10 × 3.5 × 5 centimetres) filled with formaldehyde.\n\nIn 2003, under the title \"A Dead Shark Isn't Art\", the Stuckism International Gallery exhibited a shark which had first been put on public display two years before Hirst's by Eddie Saunders in his Shoreditch (London) shop, JD Electrical Supplies. The Stuckists suggested that Hirst may have got the idea for his work from Saunders' shop display.\n\nIn a speech at the Royal Academy in 2004, art critic Robert Hughes used \"The Physical Impossibility of Death in the Mind of Someone Living\" as a prime example of how the international art market at the time was a \"cultural obscenity\". Without naming the artwork or the artist, he stated that brush marks in the lace collar of a painting by Velázquez could be more radical than a shark \"murkily disintegrating in its tank on the other side of the Thames\".\n\nThe 2009 British-Hungarian film \"The Nutcracker in 3D\" features a scene in which a pet shark is electrocuted in a water tank, which director Andrei Konchalovsky cites as a reference to Hirst's artwork.\n\nHirst's response to those who said that anyone could have done this artwork was, \"But you didn't, did you?\"\n\n"}

It explores themes of grief, mortality, and the convenient disconnection of watching life through a camera lens.\n\nThe title comes from a passage from the Bible mentioned by a visiting Jehovah's Witness. McElwee is filming the interaction and focused on adjusting the exposure to try to catch the play of light over the man's face; distracted, he \"hears\" the phrase about 30 seconds after the man says it and understands it to refer to the unpredictable imminence of death.\n\nIn the film, director Ross McElwee gets married, finally putting an end to his family's worrying; his grandmother dies; his wife Marilyn has a miscarriage; and his father, a medical doctor, dies suddenly within a week of McElwee's wife's miscarriage. His mother had died of cancer ten years earlier and so McElwee returns to his father's house, where his father's housekeeper ministers to him about Christianity and faith.\n\nMcElwee goes to visit his friend Charleen, who is now living alone in a new apartment. She had lived on an island in an old two-story house abandoned by the U.S. Army; she and her husband worked to restore it and lived together there for years before becoming estranged. Charleen then lived there alone, but on returning home from a trip she finds that her husband has set fire to the house and died downstairs at the grand piano in an arson/suicide. Charleen has her husband's cremated remains in a bag inside a box and tries to get rid of them but can't bring herself to do it.\n\nMcElwee's brother is a successful doctor; on a visit to his brother's practice, Ross talks with his brother about their father's death, which took them both by surprise. Ross's brother receives a patient who has a large malignant tumor on her breast; the woman has had the tumor for years without seeking medical help. Ross's brother takes a slide of the tumor for his files; it has spread across much of her chest and is both multifaceted and multicolored. Ross incorporates his brother's interview with the woman—and the slide his brother takes—into his film, musing in voiceover about motivation and fatality and marvelling at the power of denial.\n\nEventually Ross abandons the film, only to continue it later: his wife is pregnant. The pregnancy comes to term and Ross and Marilyn go with their baby son to visit Charleen, who criticizes them for bringing children into such a hostile and unpredictable world but speaks to the passion that drives life and procreation. Ross and Marilyn dote on their son and seem largely unbothered by the criticism.\n\n"}
