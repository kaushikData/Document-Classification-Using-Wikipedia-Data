The three channels are: the near-infrared channel (NIR), the mid-infrared channel (MIR), and the far infrared channel (FIR, also called TIRVIM).\n\nThe ACS was proposed in 2011 by Russian Academy Section and eventually accepted by the European Space Agency (ESA) and Roscosmos as one of two Russian instruments onboard TGO. The instrument was funded by Roscosmos and Centre national d'études spatiales (CNES) of France, and has components of both Russia and France. Its development and fabrication was under Russian leadership. The functionality of all the three channels was confirmed during cruise to Mars.\n\nThe main objective of the ACS suite is to make an inventory and map minor atmospheric species or trace gases in the atmosphere of Mars. This will allow scientists to profile the upper limits on the methane contents, and to possibly to detect sulfur dioxide (), a gas of volcanic origin.\n\nThe near-infrared channel (NIR), is a compact spectrometer operating in the range of 0.7–1.7 μm\nwith a resolving power of λ/Δλ ~ 20,000 and with a spectral range of 10-20 nm. It is designed to operate in nadir and in solar occultation modes. \n\nThe mid-infrared channel (MIR) is an echelle spectrometer with crossed dispersion, designed exclusively\nfor solar occultation measurements in the 2.2–4.4 μm spectral range with a resolving power of approximately 50,000.\n\nThe far-infrared channel covers the thermal infrared spectroscopy; it is a Fourier spectrometer called the TIRVIM. It has an aperture of ~5 cm and it measures the spectrum of 1.7–17 μm. Its main task will be for temperature sounding of the Martian atmosphere in the 15-μm band. TIRVIM has 10 times higher\nperformances than the PFS spectrometer of Mars Express orbiter. \nOf particular interest to this astrobiology mission, is the detection and characterization of the atmospheric methane (), as it may be of geological or biological nature. Large differences in the abundances were measured between observations taken in 2003, 2006, and on 2014 NASA reported that the \"Curiosity\" rover detected a tenfold increase ('spike') in methane in the atmosphere in late 2013 and early 2014. This suggestes that the methane was locally concentrated and is probably seasonal. Because methane on Mars would quickly break down due to ultraviolet radiation from the Sun and chemical reactions with other gases, its persistent presence in the atmosphere also implies the existence of an unknown source to continually replenish the gas.\n\nMeasuring the ratio of hydrogen and methane levels on Mars may help determine the likelihood of life on Mars. According to the scientists, \"...low H/CH ratios (less than approximately 40) indicate that life is likely present and active.\"\n"}

{"id": "713540", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=713540", "title": "Brainiac 5", "text": "Brainiac 5\n\nBrainiac 5 (Querl Dox) is a fictional character who exists in the 30th and 31st centuries of the DC Universe. He is a long-standing member of the Legion of Super-Heroes. Brainiac 5 is from the planet Colu.\n\nThe first live-action version of the character appeared in the tenth and final season of \"Smallville\", played by James Marsters. Brainiac 5 is introduced in the third season of \"Supergirl\", portrayed by Jesse Rath. He became part of the main cast in the fourth season.\n\nBrainiac 5 first appeared in name in \"Action Comics\" #276 (May 1961) and was created by Jerry Siegel and Jim Mooney.\n\nBrainiac 5 is a green-skinned, blond-haired teenage native of the planet Colu, who claimed to be descended from the original Brainiac, one of Superman's deadliest enemies. He wished to join the Legion as atonement for his great-great-grandfather's misdeeds. When Brainiac 1 was revealed to be an android created by the Computer Tyrants, Brainiac 5 \"discovered\" he was actually descended from Brainiac 2, the leader of the rebellion against the tyrants, as well as being the clone of the original Brainiac. Brainiac 5's ingenuity led to the invention of, amongst other things, the Legion flight ring (perfecting an invention of the original Invisible Kid based on a metal discovered by Mon-El), the anti-lead serum that allowed Mon-El to leave the Phantom Zone and the force field belt which became the signature device of the character. Another of Brainiac 5's creations had less beneficial effects: the super computer Computo, which attempted to take over the world, killing one of Triplicate Girl's three selves in the process. He successfully destroyed his creation with \"an anti-matter force\", but this highlighted one of his major flaws: a habit of initiating projects without considering the dangers. A much later example was his transformation of fellow scientist Professor Jaxon Rugarth into the psychotic, all-powerful Infinite Man in conjunction with honorary Legionnaire Rond Vidar.\n\nAs time went on, Brainiac 5 began to be portrayed as unstable. Long attracted to Supergirl, Brainiac 5 created a robot duplicate of her in his sleep, convincing himself this was the real Supergirl. A few years the Legion encountered Pulsar Stargrave, a villain who convinced Brainiac 5 that he was the Coluan's long-lost father. Brainiac 5 joined Stargrave to battle the sorcerer Mordru, but the android's influence would haunt him long after that. It was claimed in \"Superboy\" #225 that Stargrave was actually the original Brainiac android, but the truth of this is uncertain.\n\nWhen Stargrave murders Ultra Boy's ex-girlfriend An Ryd, Brainiac 5 frames Ultra Boy for the murder. Chameleon Boy, who suspected Brainiac 5 from the beginning, finds proof when Brainiac's madness leads him to an attempt to destroy the universe using the Miracle Machine, a device that turns thoughts into reality. He is stopped by Matter-Eater Lad, who eats the machine, and both are committed to a mental institution (the energies of the Machine having driven Matter-Eater Lad insane). Brainiac 5 eventually recovers his sanity and rejoins the group. Shortly afterward, however, he is accused of having murdered Ultra Boy's ex-girlfriend himself. To prove his innocence, he finds Stargrave and defeats him. He later manages to cure Matter-Eater Lad's insanity. Around this time, he corrects another of his mistakes by finding a way of controlling Computo.\n\nBrainiac 5 enters a state of deep melancholy upon the thousand-year anniversary of Supergirl's death at the hands of the Anti-Monitor during \"Crisis on Infinite Earths\" and flew down to hell and finished his life. However, as the Crisis eliminated Supergirl from existence, Brainiac 5 (as well as everyone else) has no recollection of her. Beyond this, however, Brainiac 5's history was relatively unaffected by the Crisis, although it would be some time before he received an origin that reflected the new Brainiac 1. Following the death of the pocket universe Superboy, Brainiac 5 is one of a number of Legionnaires who swear revenge on the Time Trapper. To this end, he recreated the Infinite Man. The Infinite Man and Time Trapper seemingly destroy each other, but Brainiac 5 quits the Legion after being accused of murdering Professor Rugarth. He rejoins in \"Legion of Super-Heroes\" (vol. 3) #63 (Aug 1989), shortly before the \"Five Year Gap\".\n\nFive years after the end of the \"Magic Wars\", things had radically changed for the heroes, most notably the disbanding of the Legion and an ongoing war with the Khund Empire, which had resulted in Earth's government (Earthgov) signing a deal with the Dominators. When \"Legion of Super-Heroes\" (vol. 4) began, Brainiac 5 was dedicated to finding a cure to the Validus Plague, a virulent disease that had afflicted an entire planet and crippled the former Lightning Lad, Garth Ranzz. Soon after the start of \"Legion\" (vol. 4) a retcon removed the Superman family of characters almost completely from Legion continuity. Supergirl was replaced by Laurel Gand, a Daxamite descendant of Lar Gand's brother. Unlike Supergirl, she was a native of the 30th century. Brainiac 5 and Laurel did have a relationship, but the couple eventually separated and she became the common law wife of Rond Vidar (a Legion ally and Green Lantern who had been a close friend of Brainiac 5).\n\nBrainiac 5 joined other Legionnaires in searching for the space pirate Roxxas, and was present when the team officially reformed. The reassembled Legion repelled a Khund invasion fleet, and confronted Darkseid, but shortly thereafter, was swept into the war against the corrupt Earthgov and the Dominators. During the Dominators' subjugation of Earth, the members of their highly classified \"Batch SW6\" escaped captivity. Originally, Batch SW6 appeared to be a group of teenage Legionnaire clones, created from samples apparently taken just prior to Ferro Lad's death at the hands of the Sun-Eater. Later, they were revealed to be time-paradox duplicates, every bit as legitimate as their older counterparts. After Earth was destroyed in a disaster reminiscent of the destruction of Krypton over a millennium earlier, a few dozen surviving cities and their inhabitants reconstituted their world as New Earth. The SW6 Legionnaires — including their version of Brainiac 5 — remained.\n\nNot long after the destruction of Earth, Brainiac 5 discovered the timestream was extremely unstable, and that Legion history was in a state of constant flux. This was the first indication of \"Zero Hour\", the event that would lead to the Legion's whole history being rebooted. During a battle with Glorith, a time-warping sorceress, Brainiac 5 was rapidly aged into a weathered, enfeebled older man. Due to the trauma of this rapid aging, Brainiac's already-prickly personality took a turn for the worse, and he became colder, more clinical, and even amoral. When the Legion was forced to go on the run as fugitives after being framed by Universo and the Khund Empire, Brainiac wore a high-tech combat suit to protect his ravaged new body, and went by the simpler moniker of \"5\". When \"Zero Hour\" befell the Legion, Brainiac 5 redoubled his efforts to save the timestream and reality as the 30th century knew it. Despite all the brilliance of Brainiac and his youthful SW6 counterpart combined, they could not save themselves from being swallowed up by temporal entropy, and their timeline was rebooted.\n\nFollowing the Zero Hour event and the rebooting of the Legion, the \"new\" Brainiac 5 was extremely antisocial and disrespectful of his colleagues. He barely interacted with the other Legionnaires, although he was still somewhat attracted to Laurel Gand, now called Andromeda, who was now also something of an outsider. When Andromeda was believed killed, he was the only person who really missed her, a wrenching experience for someone used to suppressing emotion. It was later revealed that, even amongst Coluans, Querl Dox had been something of a loner, due to his even higher intelligence, interest in practical experiments rather than \"pure\" thought, and lack of concern about the consequences of his experiments. It was also revealed that his mother, Brainiac 4, had abandoned him at birth, having no emotional attachment whatsoever to her newborn child. As a child, he was cared for by robots and given almost no contact with other living people, developing no social skills. Having created a method of traveling back to the 20th century, leading to the Legion's rescue of Valor, Brainiac 5 was arrested for unauthorized time-travel. He was later pardoned when R.J. Brande became President of the United Planets.\n\nIn addition to having a crush on Andromeda, Brainiac 5 had a secret stash of lustful holo-collection featuring Andromeda herself, Dreamer (Nura Nal), Spark (Ayla Ranzz) and another fellow legionary whose alias begins with \"In-\" (obviously Invisible Kid (Lyle Norg)), and probably others. Before that, in a moment of rare emotional outburst, Brainy kisses Lyle's cheek as he finds him again, and right after he feels embarrassed.\n\nBrainiac 5 was one of a number of Legionnaires who were trapped in the 20th century. He spent his efforts then trying to find a way back to his own time using 20th century equipment. He finally produced a computer capable of doing this, utilizing a 30th Century Omnicom, a New Gods Mother Box loaned to him by Metron and the responsometer of Veridium of the Metal Men. Unfortunately, this became the post-Zero Hour C.O.M.P.U.T.O. The Legion had to defeat it and separate it into its component pieces before returning to their own time. While in the 20th century, he also encountered his ancestors, Brainiac and Vril Dox II, as well as the post-Crisis Supergirl. Ironically, he was attracted to Supergirl due to her similarity to Andromeda (some stories suggested that Brainiac 5's attraction for tall blonde women was linked to his desire to find his mother, a tall blonde who had abandoned him at birth).\nUpon his return, he was part of a team that investigated a mysterious space anomaly. The anomaly \"upgraded\" him: he was now more considerate of others, and had vastly improved people skills. He also internalized his force shield apparatus. Following his return from the space anomaly, a friendship was formed with his teammate Gates, who dubbed the improved Querl Dox \"Brainiaon investigated the criminal/terrorist organization called the Dark Circle. Querl learned his mother, Brainiac 4, was the leader of the Dark Circle, having found that mass destruction was the only thing capable of making her feel emotions. The shock of this almost caused him to revert to his former, distant self. Although he did not revert, he began to be somewhat sarcastic and impatient again. He also began researching without considering the consequences again, inadvertently transforming the team into a \"Bizarro Legion\".\n\nBrainiac 5.1 was amongst the Legionnaires who were cast into a distant galaxy when the Stargate network was shut down. They spent a year travelling through the \"Lost Galaxy\". During this time, he felt a great amount of stress, as his teammates all believed he could devise a way of getting them home in addition to all the other responsibilities forced upon him by the circumstances of their situation. As he eventually confessed to Saturn Girl, he did not have a clue how to get them home - or even where \"home\" was, relative to their location. In the same conversation, he also complained that he'd \"always hated [his] name upgrade,\" and on the way out, as well as reassuring him, she made a point of redubbing him \"Brainiac Five,\" and he dropped the \".1\" from his name thereafter. Eventually, using his teammate Shikari's tracking skills and an interdimensional doorway they'd earlier found, but been forced to leave, he did get them home. Upon their return, Brainiac began developing a replacement for the Stargates, based on the \"threshold\" doorway they had used to return from the Lost Galaxy. Restoring the connection to the planet Xanthu, they learned that it had been at war with Robotica, the \"robot homeworld\", until they mysteriously disappeared. Robotica's leader was revealed as C.O.M.P.U.T.O. A strike team was launched against it, but Brainiac 5 tricked it into upgrading itself, so it no longer sought vengeance. It was revealed that the Coluans disapproved of artificial intelligence, however, and Brainiac 5 was made a pariah on his homeworld for saving machine-life from destruction.\n\nDuring the Reboot Legion's heyday, they are tangentially involved in the DC One Million crossover, where the audience is shown the \"Justice Legion L\" of the 853rd Century. Loosely based on members of the Legion of the 31st Century, the Justice Legion L are tasked with protecting the remains of the United Planets, by that point reduced to a small system of worlds joined together by a powerful magnetic core centered on Braal. Several of the planets involved had actually merged to form new, symbiotic worlds, including Colu-Bgztl. The Justice Legion L includes Brainiac 417, a counterpart to Brainiac 5 who is from this particular combined world: Brainiac 417. As with all members of his race, he combines super-intelligence with an ephemeral, intangible state; Brainiac 417 appears to be a shimmering green brain inside a transparent humanoid body. His race are purported to have become beings of pure intelligence and thought. Brainiac 417 is not the leader of the Justice Legion L (that duty fell to Cosmicbot), but is one of the most valuable members, and is shown to have integrated his technologies to the point where he can jump back a thousand years to recruit an earlier version of Superboy for the purposes of saving the day.\n\nIn volume 5 of the \"Legion of Super-Heroes\" title, Brainiac 5 is portrayed as similar to his ancestor Vril Dox II in \"L.E.G.I.O.N.\". He is just as arrogant and unthinking of others as the previous version was initially, but is more politically savvy. He has a tendency to put plans in motion without consulting Legion leader Cosmic Boy, who suspects him of planning a coup. He also has problems with Dream Girl as he hates that she is able to predict the future without scientific means. \"Brainy\" was also unnerved when she told him that they would one day marry. When she was killed during Terror Firma's attack on the Legion HQ on Earth, he became obsessed with \"outthinking death.\" In a botched experiment to restore her to life, he however manages to store her consciousness in his own subconscious mind, enabling the girl to interact with him in his dreams, and keep using her precognition in his behalf. Following Cosmic Boy's disappearance, Brainiac 5 has become the advisor to Legion leader Supergirl and later to Lightning Lad.\n\nBrainiac 5 eventually proposes to Dream Girl after spending the night together in which Dream Girl inhabited the body of a spiritualist, however, on the same night, Princess Projectra has her own urges and primal, repressed emotion, viciously attack Dream Girl upon her return to Querl's mind, viciously beating her and gouging out her eyes, leaving the girl blind and powerless, thus hoping to strip Brainiac 5 of her constant counseling. He much later manages to turn their dream into reality when, forced to rebuild new bodies for his teammates, mangled to shreds by a race of digitalized aliens while connected to the cyberspace, creates a new body for Dream Girl, imprinting her personality, into the cloned body. Successful in his attempt, that, despite Nura's previsions, even restored her lost sight, Brainiac 5 happily extends to all the legionnaires his invitation to their marriage, holding hands with his resurrected soon-to-be bride \n\nUnbeknownst to Brainiac 5, the \"dark side\" of his mind, the avatar of his repressed urges and dark feelings, was granted a physical\nbody by Princess Projectra and sent to the physical body.\n\nThe events of the \"Infinite Crisis\" miniseries have apparently restored a close analogue of the Pre-Crisis Legion to continuity, as seen in \"The Lightning Saga\" story arc in \"Justice League of America\" and \"Justice Society of America\", and in the \"Superman and the Legion of Super-Heroes\" story arc in \"Action Comics\". This incarnation of the Legion shares roughly the same history as the original Legion up to the events of \"Crisis on Infinite Earths\".\n\nThe original Brainiac 5 from the Pre-Crisis universe briefly appeared in the Justice League/Justice Society \"Lightning Saga\" crossover. He was revealed as the mastermind behind the Legion's plot to return to the 21st century to retrieve someone connected to the Flash. At the end of the storyline, Brainiac 5 was seen holding one of the lightning rods the Legionnaires used on 21st century Earth, and told his teammates that the Legion had gotten what it came for. This Brainiac 5's agenda does not end there, however; in the pages of \"Countdown\", Una arrived in the present to stop Karate Kid from returning to the 31st century, explaining that Brainiac 5 says the two of them have another mission in the present day.\n\nIn this follow-up story to the Lightning Saga (Taking place in Action Comics #858-863), Brainiac 5 is masquerading as a tyrannical dictator of Colu, but only to delay Colu, which is the strategical beachhead of a United Planets attack on Earth, and keep them from completing their calculations. Brainiac still possesses the Lightning Rod, and states that the person inside is crucial to stopping the \"Crisis of the 31st century\". However, his ruse is discovered, and Brainiac leaves with the Legion, with only four hours until the United Planets go to war. After Superman and the Legion defeat Earthman and his \"Justice League of Earth\", and convince the armada to stand down, Brainiac 5 tells Superman that the Legion will not forget him this time.\n\nIn this Final Crisis tie-in, Brainiac 5 is driven to the breaking point after being banished by Colu, and by Earth's continued xenophobia. He considers leaving the Legion, but is convinced to remain as a way to prove all his naysayers wrong. When Superboy-Prime attacks Takron-Galtos and frees the Legion of Super-Villains, Brainiac 5 informs his fellow Legionnaires of his plan to recruit their post-\"Zero Hour\" and \"Threeboot\" selves to help. His plan succeeds, and Brainiac meets his alternate selves from two other realities. The \"Threeboot\" version of Brainiac refuses to work with his older self, due to his rebellious nature, while the post-\"Zero Hour\" version sees his older counterpart as wiser and more experienced, and tries to mediate between his alternate selves. Despite their differences, all three versions of Brainiac 5 work together to set in motion the final phases of the original Brainiac's master contingency plan against Superboy-Prime. This plan, which involved the resurrections of Superboy-Prime foes Bart Allen/Kid Flash (whose essence was in the lightning rod) and Connor Kent/Superboy, was devised long ago when Brainiac 5 was forewarned of Prime's arrival by one of Dream Girl's prophesies.\n\nBrainiac 5 seems to be largely unaffected by the changes of the \"Flashpoint\" miniseries, as is true for the Legion of Super-Heroes as a whole. However, the term \"Brainiac\" is no longer his name but an honorable title. This adds understanding to the opening arcs of \"Action Comics\" vol. 2 (2011) by Grant Morrison, where an alien is stealing and bottling cities, an act usually committed by Brainiac, but is only named \"the Collector\".\n\nA younger Brainiac 5 appears briefly during \"Justice League\" vol. 3 (2017) by Bryan Hitch, though unconnected to the Legion. He is also not referred to by his name, only as the \"brainy kid\" by Cyborg. After analyzing the Timeless technology with specialized contacts, he lends Cyborg his prototype flight bracelet, marked with the Brainiac sigil, so the League member can reach the weapon.\n\nBrainiac 5 possesses a twelfth level intellect which grants him superhuman calculation skills, amazing memory and exceptional technical knowledge. By comparison, 20th century Earth as a whole constitutes a sixth level intellect, and most of his fellow Coluans have an eighth level intellect. 31st century Earth as a whole is a ninth level intellect. His incredible memory allows him to retain knowledge of events that all other characters forget such as the first meeting of the three different Legions.\n\nThe Post-\"Zero Hour\" version of Brainiac 5 was shown in several issues to be able to ponder twelve lines of thought simultaneously. When a renegade Titanian read his mind, she discovered that his subconscious — usually the more active and chaotic part of the mind — was less active than his twelve simultaneous conscious thoughts. Whether any other version of Brainiac also exhibits this trait remains to be seen.\n\nSince Brainiac 5 processes a super intelligent mind, his main method of aiding himself and his fellow Legionnaires has always been through devices he himself invented. His primary role in any version of the Legion has always been that of the scientist. One of his most important inventions is the Legion Flight Ring, which he has either invented or had a significant role in creating over the various versions of the Legion. Another invention, which has proved invaluable to him, is the force field belt which has remained his main method of self-defense in cases where he found himself in battle in every version of the Legion.\n\nIn recent issues of \"The Legion of Super Heroes\", Brainiac 5's force field belt, one of his signature inventions, has now been relegated to one of the predecessors of the title, with Brainiac 5 calling the invention an irreplaceable piece of his family history. \n\nIn various storylines, another invention of his has been the super-computer C.O.M.P.U.T.O. This machine has been included in most versions of the Legion, but always reworked in the storyline to suit the situation required. Brainiac 5 modified the \"Time Sphere\" to create the \"Time Bubble\" he used it to time travel to send or bring other DC characters to and from the 31st century. Other methods of travel that have not involved time travel have included devices such as the developments on the Threshold technology and the wormhole-conduit teleporter.\n\nNot all of Brainiac 5's inventions have proved useful to the Legion. Both versions of C.O.M.P.U.T.O. each proved to be among Brainiac 5's worst mistakes. While not a product of his own research but rather stolen data, Brainiac 5.1 also managed to create Bizarro versions of many of the Legion members.\n\n\n\n"}

Designed by Atsuko Nishida, its name is a combination of the words \"bulb\" and \"dinosaur.\" First appearing in \"Pokémon Red\" and \"Green\" as a Starter Pokémon, it later appeared in subsequent sequels, spin-off games, related merchandise, and animated and printed adaptations of the franchise.\n\nKnown as the Seed Pokémon, Bulbasaur can survive for days solely on sunlight. It is a central character in the anime, being one of Ash's main Pokémon for the first season, and a different one later being obtained by May. It is featured in various manga, and is owned by protagonist Red in the \"Pokémon Adventures\" manga. Bulbasaur has been featured in myriad pieces of merchandise, including toys, key chains, and plush dolls.\n\nBulbasaur was designed by Atsuko Nishida, one of the character designers for \"Pocket Monsters Red\" and \"Green\", who based its design on Venusaur. The species first appeared as one of three starter Pokémon the player could choose from at the beginning of the initial Game Boy games, \"Pokémon Red\" and \"Blue\", released in Japan in 1996. Its Japanese name, \"Fushigidane\", is a combination of the Japanese words for and . In translating the game for English speaking audiences, Nintendo gave the Pokémon \"cleverly descriptive names\" related to their appearance or features as a means to make the characters more relatable to American children; thus \"Bulbasaur\", relating to both its dinosaur appearance and the large garlic-shaped bulb on its back. The idea to feature Bulbasaur and the other \"Red\" and \"Green\" starters in a significant role in \"Pokémon X\" and \"Y\" came about a year and a half into the development of the games. The Mega Evolutions for the three Pokémon's final forms were created, and the designers decided that they should give players an opportunity to receive one of these Pokémon from Professor Sycamore, the games professor, to see their Mega Evolved form.\n\nDespite their English names, Ken Sugimori confirmed that the design of Bulbasaur and its evolutions is based on frogs. In the \"Pokémon\" franchise, Bulbasaur are small, squat amphibian and plant Pokémon that move on all four legs, and have light blue-green bodies with darker blue-green spots. As a Bulbasaur undergoes evolution into Ivysaur and then later into Venusaur, the bulb on its back blossoms into a large flower. The seed on a Bulbasaur's back is planted at birth and then sprouts and grows larger as the Bulbasaur grows. The bulb absorbs sunlight which makes it grow. For this reason, Bulbasaur enjoy soaking up the sun's rays, and can survive for days without eating because the bulb stores energy. The distinctive differences of Bulbasaur from other Pokémon such as Diglett are well understood by children and so motivate their play and trading of the creature.\n\nBulbasaur made its video game debut on February 27, 1996, in the Japanese-language games \"Pocket Monsters Red\" and \"Green\". Along with Charmander and Squirtle, Bulbasaur is a starter Pokémon the player can choose from at the beginning of the games. Bulbasaur's Grass type is in contrast to Charmander's Fire type and Squirtle's Water type. Bulbasaur and the other starters from \"Red\" and \"Blue\" are replaced by Pikachu in \"Pokémon Yellow\", the only starter available in it. Instead, they are obtained throughout the game from several trainers. In \"Pokémon FireRed\" and \"LeafGreen\", remakes of \"Red\" and \"Green\", Bulbasaur is selectable as a starter Pokémon once again, along with Charmander and Squirtle. In \"Pokémon HeartGold\" and \"SoulSilver\", after obtaining all sixteen badges and defeating Red, the player can choose to obtain either Bulbasaur, Charmander, or Squirtle. In \"Pokémon X\" and \"Y\", players can also choose between Bulbasaur, Charmander, and Squirtle near the start of the game shortly after having chosen the games' new starter Pokémon.\n\nThe Nintendo 64 spin-off \"Pokémon Stadium\", and other spin-offs such as \"Pokémon Mystery Dungeon\", give the player a choice of a Bulbasaur (among fifteen other Pokémon), and in \"Pokémon Snap\", Bulbasaur are one of the Pokémon that the player can photograph. It also appears in \"Pokémon Puzzle League\" as one of Ash's Pokémon. Bulbasaur also appears in \"Hey You, Pikachu!\" as a supporting character who lives in the Ochre Woods and makes the five recipes with Pikachu's help. In \"Super Smash Bros. Melee\" and \"Brawl\", Bulbasaur appears as one of the obtainable trophies. Bulbasaur appears in \"\" as the host of a mini-game called \"Daring Dash\".\n\nIn 2016, Bulbasaur was one of the four starter Pokémon in \"Pokémon Go\".\n\nScenes from the \"Pokémon\" anime have depicted both the characters Ash and May training a Bulbasaur at different times, with Ash's Bulbasaur garnering more prominence within the storylines. Ash’s Bulbasaur has remained with Ash longer than all of his other Pokémon, with the exception of his Pikachu. Before joining Ash's team, it lives with a girl named Melanie, who takes care of abandoned Pokémon. Bulbasaur is given to Ash, but it is pessimistic about him. However, its loyalties begin to improve and it eventually becomes one of Ash's most faithful Pokémon. May catches a Bulbasaur while traveling in a grass-type Pokémon nature reserve during her journey in Hoenn. Bulbasaur defends her from the other grass Pokémon in the forest, who see her as a threat, and when May leaves, Bulbasaur decides to go with her. She later makes a guest appearance on the series and it is revealed that her Bulbasaur has fully evolved into a Venusaur.\n\nIn the original Japanese version the two Bulbasaur are each played by separate voice actresses, Ash's Bulbasaur by Megumi Hayashibara and May's by Miyako Itō. In the English dub, they are both voiced by Tara Jayne until Michele Knotz took over the job for the ninth season.\n\nBulbasaur is featured in an eclectic range of different \"Pokémon\" manga series. In \"\", \"\", and \"\", which loosely parallel the storyline of the anime, Pikachu is separated from Ash temporarily, and travels with a Bulbasaur to a secret Pokémon village in the mountains. Later, Ash finds Pikachu and catches the Bulbasaur. Bulbasaur accompanies Ash throughout his journeys in the Orange Islands, and eventually fights in the final showdown with Drake, the Orange Crew Supreme Gym Leader. In \"Magical Pokémon Journey\", a character named Pistachio has a female Bulbasaur (nicknamed Danerina in the Japanese version), who is infatuated by him.\n\nIn \"Pokémon Adventures\", a manga based on the plot of the \"Pokémon Red\" and \"Blue\" games, the character Red receives a Bulbasaur from Professor Oak, which he nicknames Saur. In Chapter 15, \"Wartortle Wars\", it evolves into an Ivysaur after battling a wild Mankey.\n\nBulbasaur appeared in the first episode of \"Pokemon Generations\" which is owned by Red.\n\nBulbasaur is the main character of two \"Pokémon\" children's books, \"Pokémon Tales Volume 3: Bulbasaur’s Trouble\" and \"Bulbasaur’s Bad Day\", published in 1999 and 2000 respectively by Sagebrush. In \"Pokémon Tales Volume 3: Bulbasaur’s Trouble\", Bulbasaur resolves an argument between two other Pokémon. In \"Bulbasaur’s Bad Day\", Meowth traps Bulbasaur in a pit and it has to outwit Team Rocket (the antagonists of the \"Pokémon\" anime) to escape.\n\nBulbasaur has been featured in varying pieces of merchandise, including toys and plush dolls. Bulbasaur has been depicted in action figures sold by Hasbro in the United States, while Tomy in Japan sold extensive merchandise of the character, including vinyl dolls, wind-up model kits, and terry cloth bean bags. It has also been used in promotional merchandising at fast-food chains such as McDonald's and Burger King. Bulbasaur has also been included in various versions of the Pokémon painting on ANA Boeing 767s. The island nation of Niue issued a commemorative coin with a legal tender value of one crown which has a Bulbasaur on the reverse side.\n\nIGN named Bulbasaur the \"52nd best\" Pokémon. IGN author Audrey Drake noted that she had a \"very special attachment\" to it due to it being her first Pokémon. She also stated that it may be her \"favorite\". \"Game Informer\" also included it in its list of the best Pokémon at #3 (along with Charmander and Squirtle). Author O'Dell Harmon noted the choice between these three Pokémon as the \"most important\" one in the series' history. Game Revolution called Bulbasaur the \"best Pokémon ever\". Author Alex Osborn stated that it \"embodies the charm that makes Pokémon what it is\" and called it his \"personal favourite\". Fellow Game Revolution editor Daniel Bischoff noted it as his \"favourite Pokémon\" as well. Nintendo World Report's Pedro Hernandez also called it his \"favourite\" Pokémon. He noted that it \"represented\" a number of \"firsts\" for him - including his \"first episode\" of the \"Pokémon\" anime, his \"first Pokémon\", and the \"first Pokémon\" he \"saw in 3D.\" He also attributes Bulbasaur to the reason he became interested in the \"Pokémon\" series. \"Official Nintendo Magazine\"s John Vekinis attributed his \"love of Grass-type Pokémon\" to Bulbasaur in spite of the Grass type's weaknesses. \"Official Nintendo Magazine\" readers voted Bulbasaur as the \"second best\" Grass-type Pokémon. Author Thomas East noted that it \"looked better\" than his later forms. Their readers also named it the \"best\" starting Pokémon. \"GamesTM\" called it the \"best starting Pokémon\" for \"Red\" and \"Blue\". CNN reporter Dennis Michael described Bulbasaur as one of the \"lead critters\" of the games and \"perhaps the Carmen Miranda\" of Pokémon figures. Bulbasaur was selected as one of the top ten Pokémon by fans who voted at Pokemon.com.\nIn an IGN biography page, Bulbasaur is described as \"the odd man out\" in the \"Pokémon Red\" and \"Blue\" game because it represented neither color, thought added \"it’s perhaps the best-known grass-type Pokémon, even though it’s a little bit more animal than vegetable\", as well as noting its popularity with new players of the games. IGN editor \"Pokémon of the Day Chick\" agreed, despite the fact its later evolutions were \"slightly eclipsed by Charizard\", and also praised the anime incarnation for its attitude. GamesRadar editor Brett Elston described Bulbasaur as being \"popular\" for more than just being the first Pokémon numerically, citing its moveset and evolutions. Fellow GamesRadar editor Carolyn Gudmundson, in an article on the \"top 7 gut-wrenching choices\", listed the choice between fire, grass, or water with Bulbasaur as a \"frontrunner\", due to being a dinosaur as well as being grass type, though found its later evolutions \"ugly and charmless\".\n\nAccording to a panel of five-to-eight-year-olds assembled by the \"Honolulu Star-Bulletin\" in 1999, Bulbasaur was one of the children's \"three favorite Pokémon\". One boy in a study by Dafna Lemish and Linda Renee-Bloch identified with Bulbasaur's attributes of being \"strong and also cute\". Lemish and Renee-Bloch feel that the importance of cuteness is an example of the \"appropriation of Japanese values\" in an Israeli context, and note that boys' desire for strength has been correlated with \"a desire for social interaction\".\n\nBulbasaur was among the eleven Pokémon chosen as Japan's mascots in the 2014 FIFA World Cup.\n\n"}
{"id": "37040492", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37040492", "title": "Capital punishment in Montenegro", "text": "Capital punishment in Montenegro\n\nCapital punishment in Montenegro was first prescribed by law in 1798. It was abolished on 19 June 2002. The last execution, by shooting, took place on 29 January 1981, and the two last death sentences were pronounced on 11 October 2001. Montenegro is bound by the following international conventions prohibiting capital punishment (dates of ratification are given in parentheses): Second Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (6 September 2001), as well as Protocols No. 6 and No. 13 to the European Convention on Human Rights (3 March 2004). According to Art. 26 of the Montenegrin Constitution (2007): „In Montenegro, capital punishment is forbidden”.\n\nUntil 1851, Montenegro was a theocracy, ruled by an Orthodox Bishop and a Senate, composed of representatives of Montenegrin tribes, which enjoyed a full autonomy. The first written law was passed in 1789 (and amended in 1803), during the rule of Bishop Peter I. It prescribed the death penalty for murder and treason and allowed three modes of execution: hanging, shooting and stoning. The shooting was performed by representatives of all tribes (at times, several hundred men), in order to prevent the blood revenge by the offender's tribe. Although not prescribed by law, capital punishment was also applied to thieves. According to historical sources, „a thief was hanged and a murderer shot“ in 1831. In 1839/1840, „about 20 criminals“ were executed. \nAfter Montenegro became a secular Princedom, a new penal code was adopted in 1855 (The Prince Danilo's Code). It prescribed capital punishment for some 18 offenses, including murder, treason, offences against the dignity of the Prince (lese-majesty), various forms of theft, and refusal to pay tax. A man who kills his wife and/or her lover having found them in an act of adultery (in flagrante) was exempt from all punishment. The legal mode of execution was shooting, but only for men. Women could not be shot (as it would „soil the rifles“), but were to be hanged, drowned or stoned instead. Executions of women were extremely rare – one documented case involved a woman stoned for murdering her husband in 1854.\nThe first modern Penal Code, adopted in 1906, prescribed capital punishment for more than twenty offenses. Execution was by shooting, performed by a firing squad of ten soldiers. The true number of death sentences and executions prior to 1914 is not known, but it was small: on the average, one or two executions per year. An exception to this were two political trials in 1908 and 1909, when 13 persons accused of conspiring against the government were sentenced to death (nine were executed).\n\nWhen Yugoslavia was created in 1918, different legal systems remained in force in different parts of the new country. In the north-western provinces (Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Slovenia and Vojvodina), executions were by hanging in an enclosed space with restricted public attendance. In the remainder of the country (Serbia, Kosovo, Montenegro and Macedonia), executions were by shooting and in public. When a single Penal Code was introduced for the whole country (1929), hanging remained the only legal mode of execution, with the exception of sentences passed by military courts, which were executed by shooting.\nCrimes punished by death were mostly murder and robbery leading to death, as well as terrorism. According to the official statistics, there were 14 death sentences and 5 executions in Montenegro from 1920 to 1940 (In the same period, in the whole of Yugoslavia there were 904 sentences and 291 executions).\n\nIn the first years after WWII, death sentences were passed in large numbers daily on collaborationists and war criminals, but also on the „enemies of the people“, i.e. all those who opposed the new communist regime. There are no reliable data, but it seems likely that in Yugoslavia until 1951 there were as many as 10,000 death sentences, a majority of which were executed. In Montenegro, there may have been several hundred death sentences, approximately two thirds of which were executed. In addition to political offences, capital crimes included the theft of the government property, as well as aggravated murder and robbery. Until 1959, executions were either by shooting or by hanging, as determined by the sentence of the court in each individual case, although hangings were considered as an aggravated form and were used less frequently. In the first post-war years, executions of major war criminals were often public. After 1950, the number of death sentences fell sharply. According to the official statistics, from 1950 to 1958 there were 229 death sentences in all of Yugoslavia, while in Montenegro there were only between ten and twenty.\nThe 1959 reforms resulted in a less strict system of criminal justice. Number of capital offences was reduced and capital punishment was abolished for property offences. Hanging was abolished and the only legal mode of execution remained shooting, performed by a platoon of eight policemen, only half of whom had rifles loaded with live ammunition. Executions could not be performed publicly. From 1959 to 1991, there were, on average, two or three executions per year in Yugoslavia. In the same 32-year period, there were fewer than ten executions in Montenegro. The last execution in Montenegro took place in Kotor on 29 January 1981. The person executed was one Dragiša Ristić, sentenced to death for raping and murdering a minor.\n\nFrom April 1992, Serbia was a part of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, which consisted of two federal units – Serbia and Montenegro. From 1991 to 2002, Montenegrin courts passed 8 death sentences, none of which had been executed. The two last death sentences were passed by the Higher Court in Podgorica on Slavko Dević and Rade Arsović, convicted of murder.\n\nIn 1906, a pamphlet against capital punishment was published in Cetinje, and in 1907 the minister of justice informed the Parliament that it was the Prince’s wish to have the death penalty abolished in Montenegro, except for treason. However, no amendments to the Penal Code were made in the Parliament and the capital punishment remained in force.\n\nConstitution of FR Yugoslavia (which consisted of Serbia and Montenegro), adopted on 25 April 1992, abolished capital punishment for federal crimes (including genocide, war crimes, political and military offences), but the federal units kept the right to prescribe capital punishment for crimes under their jurisdiction (murder and robbery). In the drafting of the Constitution, the proposal to abolish capital punishment came from the Montenegrin members of the Drafting Commission.\n\nOn 19 June 2002, the Montenegrin Parliament amended the Penal Code by deleting from it all references to capital punishment. As was stressed in the parliamentary debate, a paramount motive for this abolition was the desire of the then FR Yugoslavia to join the Council of Europe.\n\n"}

Additionally, increased functional demand can also stimulate this growth in tissues and organs. The growth can be a result of increased cell size (compensatory hypertrophy) or an increase in cell division (compensatory hyperplasia) or both. For instance, if one kidney is surgically removed, the cells of other kidney divide at an increased rate. Eventually, the remaining kidney can grow until its mass approaches the combined mass of two kidneys. Along with the kidneys, compensatory growth has also been characterized in a number of other tissues and organs including:\n\nA large number of growth factors and hormones are involved with compensatory growth, but the exact mechanism is not fully understood and probably varies between different organs. Nevertheless, angiogenic growth factors which control the growth of blood vessels are particularly important because blood flow significantly determines the maximum growth of an organ.\n\nCompensatory growth may also refer to the accelerated growth following a period of slowed growth, particularly as a result of nutrient deprivation.\n\n"}
{"id": "28601722", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=28601722", "title": "Constructional apraxia", "text": "Constructional apraxia\n\nConstructional apraxia is characterized by an inability or difficulty to build, assemble, or draw objects. Apraxia is a neurological disorder in which people are unable to perform tasks or movements even though they understand the task, are willing to complete it, and have the physical ability to perform the movements. Constructional apraxia may be caused by lesions in the parietal lobe following stroke or it may serve as an indicator for Alzheimer's disease.\n\nA key deficit in constructional apraxia patients is the inability to correctly copy or draw an image. There are qualitative differences between patients with left hemisphere damage, right hemisphere damage, and Alzheimer's Disease.\n\nPatients with damage to their left hemisphere tend to preserve items, oversimplify drawing features and omit details when drawing from memory. In addition, left hemisphere patients are less likely to systematically arrange the parts of their drawing.\n\nPatients with damage to their right hemisphere have trouble correctly replicating spatial relationships of complex figures. Drawing elements are often piecemeal, transposed to different positions or orientations, or shown diagonally on the page. As a result, right hemisphere patients tend to produce asymmetric or distorted drawings characterized by hemispatial neglect, the omission of elements from one side of the model. It was once thought that right hemisphere patients were twice as likely to make mistakes in 3D construction tasks as left hemisphere patients but this inaccurate conclusion was attributable to participant selection bias in that researchers excluded from studies individuals with severe left hemisphere lesions due to the debilitating language impairments of those individuals. However, included in studies were individuals with severe right hemisphere lesions. Subsequent research has substantiated the absence of a marked difference in performance between left and right hemisphere patients on 3D construction tasks.\n\nAlzheimer's disease patients with constructional apraxia have unique symptoms. Their drawings contain fewer angles, spatial alterations, a lack of perspective and simplifications, which are uncharacteristic of left hemisphere or right hemisphere patients. Constructional disabilities are present early on in the disease and get progressively worse over time; however even patients with advanced Alzheimer's disease may be able to do some constructional tasks. Spontaneous drawing is affected early and is heavily dependent upon semantic memory; therefore simplifications in the drawing may be due to impaired access to semantic knowledge. As Alzheimer's disease progresses, the patient's ability to copy objects becomes increasingly impaired and they may lose the ability to correctly draw simple figures due to a motor loss in routine memories.\n\nConstructional apraxia cannot be localized to a specific hemisphere or cerebral area because drawing and constructional tasks require both perceptual and motor functioning. It has been linked to parietal lesions in the left and right hemisphere, stroke and Alzheimer's disease.\n\nInitially, researchers tried to isolate the cause to left hemisphere lesions in the parietal lobe because of its similarities to Gerstmann syndrome; however, lesions in the dorsal stream also result in visual agnosia and a piecemeal drawing. Although constructional apraxia can result from lesions in any part of the brain, it is most commonly associated with lesions in the parietal-occipital lobes. Constructional apraxia is common after right parietal stroke and it continues after visuospatial symptoms have subsided. Patients with posterior and parietal lobe lesions tend to have the most severe symptoms.\n\nIn Alzheimer's disease research, the AT8 antibody has proven to be an early indicator of tau protein pathology. Constructional apraxia patients with the most AT8 pathology were least able to copy an image, while those best able to had the least neuritic pathology. Therefore, figure copying ability is highly correlated with Alzheimer's disease pathology.\n\nAs the study of constructional apraxia impairments narrows, research is concentrating on analyzing drawing abilities. Drawing abilities may be decomposed into three steps: visual perception, visual imagery, and graphic production.\n\nAccording to the two-streams hypothesis, as information exits the occipital lobe it follows two pathways. The dorsal stream (\"where pathway\") ends in the parietal lobe while the ventral stream (\"what pathway\") terminates in the temporal lobe. Damage to the parietal lobe is highly correlated with constructional apraxia since it is involved in drawing and copying. The parietal lobe is also critical for remapping spatial position across saccades. There is an attentional subsystem responsible for moving the eyes, head, and body to focus on different images. Damage at various levels of this system could lead to trouble localizing a stimulus or hemispatial neglect which manifests as perseverative errors on the drawing. There are a couple theories used to describe the neurological mechanisms behind drawing.\n\nKosslyn proposes that there is an early split of information in the dorsal stream. The first pathway captures coordinate relations by defining distances between points in space. These points become a continuum which can transform into other points through intermediate points. This coding of points would allow space to be perceived qualitatively, which would also help with movement.\n\nThe other pathway encodes \"categorical\" information, which synthesizes information about the shape and spatial arrangement of an objects parts. It decomposes objects into their most basic form, by looking for boundaries, lines, or patches. These categorical relations in turn lead to abstract spatial relations that allow one to perceive objects as being \"on top,\" \"inside,\" \"between,\" \"beside,\" etc.\n\nThe Van Sommers model describes two hierarchical systems for drawing: one for visual perception, another for graphic production. The visual perception model utilizes David Marr's three stage system to describe visual perception in copying. In the first stage, an image us represented in 2D based on changes in intensity. Foreground and background are not distinguished. In the second stage, a 2.5D representation is formed which encodes the object in a viewer-centered coordinate system. Finally a 3D object-centered representation is established making it possible to appreciate volume. Visual representations of familiar drawings are stored in memory. This representation sends feedback to the other areas of the brain which encoded the spatial and physical properties of the object. Feedback from these areas allows the drawer to successfully encode the coordinate and categorical relations.\n\nIn the graphic production model, the viewer begins by making a series of \"depiction decisions\" about the dimensions, amount of detail to include, etc. Depiction decisions are not used when copying a drawing because they're dictated by the situation. Next, the \"production strategy\" is formed. If the drawing is unfamiliar, then the drawer will divide and rank the different portions of the drawings. If the drawing is familiar (e.g. a sun), then the drawer will reproduce the item line by lie regardless of the pictures organization due to automatic execution. The third component, \"contingent planning,\" reflects the importance of planning in drawing. Contingent planning is a result of production strategy. If the drawing is unfamiliar and requires a segmented approach, then the most appropriate sequence is determined before the drawing. At this point, the drawing task becomes a problem solving task. The fourth and final component of the model refers to the \"articulatory and economic constraints\" placed on the drawer by using a pencil. Certain directions are favored due to the orientation of the hand and fingers, etc. However, some feel the Van Sommers model does not adequately account for all aspects of drawing.\n\nDrawing from memory in response to a verbal order requires the image to be recalled from associative memory and brought into the visual buffer. Once there, it can be successfully drawn and copied from memory. Familiar images (like the sun) may not require visual imagery to draw, as the production schemes and action programming stored in the associative memory and procedural memory may be sufficient to reproduce the drawing.\n\nConstruction problems are usually caused by visual perception deficits. They require normal vision and the ability to execute a series of motor activities. When looking at performance, it is important to consider perceptual and executive functioning. A patient with trouble visually recognizing patterns or spatial relations may have difficulty correctly building a model. In addition, problems planning, organizing, or carrying out action may impede the ability to solve a construction problem.\n\nModern attempts to understand constructional apraxia have moved away from anatomical functions towards a cognitive neuropsychological approach. Both adults and children alike experience difficulty reproducing oblique lines. Some feel that these deficiencies may be attributed to planning since it is easier to plan horizontal and vertical lines than oblique lines. Research indicates that both adults and children are more able to draw squares than diamonds, although as children grow into adults they are more accurately able to depict diamonds.\n\nOne study showed that constructional apraxia patients were significantly less accurate than the control patients in producing angles with vertical and horizontal orientations. In this study, constructional apraxia patients drew patterns usually found in children 8 and younger. Gregory argues that ontogenetically and phylogenically earlier behavioral traits are present in the brain, but inhibited. When these inhibitory mechanisms become compromised, then the childlike behavior patterns re-emerge. Therefore, according to this theory, the inhibitory mechanisms in patients with constructional apraxia have failed, causing them to draw like young children who have difficulty drawing oblique lines.\n\nConstructional disabilities are often tested by asking the patient to draw a 2D model or assemble an object. Some researchers feel that neuronal mechanisms involved in drawing and copying differ, thus they should be tested individually. Free drawing is a commonly used test in which the patient is asked to draw a named object. It can be an effective tool in measuring the patient's ability to maintain spatial relations, organize the drawing, and draw complete shapes. The complexity of the task should be noted as such tasks often require lexical-semantic abilities as well as imagery abilities.\n\nMotor imagery has been explored as a potential therapy for constructional apraxia patients. Motor imagery is a process by which a specific action is mimicked in the working memory without a corresponding motor output. Since constructional apraxia is a visuospatial problem not a motor problem, rehabilitation-treatment based on motor imagery has not proven to be an effective in patients with right hemisphere stroke or hemispatial neglect.\n\nIn 1934, Karl Kleist characterized constructional apraxia as a disturbance \"in formative activities such as assembling, building and drawing, in which the spatial form of the product proves to be unsuccessful, without there being an apraxia for single movements.\" In the years following, the definition of constructional apraxia \ndiverged. There were those who felt it was an executive processing order and those who felt it was a visuospatial disorder. Due to discrepancies in definitions, constructional apraxia became a blanket term to describe any kind of constructional impairment. Modern researchers question whether the term \"apraxia\" is appropriate to describe this condition.\n\n"}
{"id": "33485306", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=33485306", "title": "Death of Wang Yue", "text": "Death of Wang Yue\n\nWang Yue (), also known as \"Little Yue Yue\" (), was a two-year-old Chinese girl who was run over by two vehicles on the afternoon of 13 October 2011 in a narrow road in Foshan, Guangdong. As she lay bleeding on the road for more than seven minutes, at least 18 passers-by skirted around her body, ignoring her. She was eventually helped by a female rubbish scavenger and sent to a hospital for treatment, but succumbed to her injuries and died eight days later. The closed-circuit television recording of the incident was uploaded onto the Internet, and quickly stirred widespread reaction in China and overseas. Many commentators saw this as indicative of a growing apathy in contemporary Chinese society.\n\nWang, who was two years old, wandered away from her home in Foshan while her mother was quickly collecting laundry during a thunderstorm. Closed-circuit television cameras captured the child wandering into a narrow, busy market street. Within a few moments of her appearance on the screen, Wang was struck by a white van, and knocked to the ground and under the van's front wheels. The van driver pauses, but does not get out. After a moment, he pulls forward slowly, at which time his rear wheel drives over Wang. The driver moves on. Subsequently, at least 18 people walk past her, and fail to assist her, some pausing to stare before moving on. In that time, another large truck runs over Wang's legs with both front and back tires. She is eventually helped by a female rubbish scavenger, Chen Xianmei (). It is apparent in the video that Wang is crying, holding her head, moving her arms and legs, and bleeding.\nWang's parents Wang Chichang and Qu Feifei chose not to blame anyone besides themselves for their daughter's death. Qu said, \"Granny Chen represents the best of human nature, it's the nicest and most natural side of us.\"\n\nThe drivers of both vehicles were detained by police in the days after the incident.\n\nOn May 26, 2012, Hu Jun, who was driving the first minivan that ran over Wang, was put on trial in Foshan and charged with Wang's death. He pleaded guilty to traffic crimes, but not homicide. On September 6, 2012, Hu was convicted of involuntary homicide and sentenced to years in prison. The sentence was lightened because he turned himself in and had paid part of Wang's medical expenses.\n\nClosed-circuit footage of the incident was broadcast by a local television station, then posted online. The footage sparked worldwide news reports, and triggered dozens of editorials and millions of posts on social media sites, the majority criticizing the callousness and cruelty of those who passed Wang Yue without helping her.\n\nPreviously, there have been incidents in China, such as the Peng Yu incident in 2006, wherein Good Samaritans who helped people injured in accidents were accused of having injured the victim themselves and in many cases were forced to pay for the victim's medical bills. Some commentators have explained that this may have caused people to fear getting in trouble for doing the right thing in Wang's case, thus failing to help.\n\nThe Communist Party Chief of the Guangdong province, Wang Yang, called the incident \"a wake-up call for everybody\". The Sina Weibo website attracted more than 4.5 million posts on the incident within a few days and launched a \"stop apathy\" campaign online. There are also reports that some of the 18 people identified in the camera footage have received harassment, threats, and crank calls since the news broke.\n\nIn November 2011, the results of a poll by the \"China Youth Daily\", the official Communist party newspaper for youth, showed that 80% of the young people surveyed said they had been following the case closely, and 88% of those polled thought Wang died because of growing indifference [in China] towards other people. A majority, 71%, also thought the people who passed the child without helping were afraid of getting into trouble themselves. According to an article by Chen Weihua, deputy editor of the \"China Daily\", \"Various surveys in the past weeks have shown that the majority of the people polled believe our morals have suffered a major setback in the past decade.\"\n\nAccording to \"China Daily\", “At least 10 Party and government departments and organizations in Guangdong, including the province's commission on politics and law, the women's federation, the Academy of Social Sciences, and the Communist Youth League, have started discussions on punishing those who refuse to help people who clearly need it.”\n\nOfficials of Guangdong province, along with many lawyers and social workers, also held three days of meetings in the provincial capital of Guangzhou to discuss the case. It was reported that various lawmakers of the province were drafting a \"Good Samaritan\" law, which would \"penalize people who fail to help in a situation of this type and indemnify them from lawsuits if their efforts are in vain.\" Legal experts and the public debated the idea ahead of discussions and a legislative push. On 1 August 2013, the nation's first Good Samaritan law took effect in Shenzhen.\n\nWhile most attention was focused on the passers-by who failed to assist Wang, a British journalist interviewed other shopkeepers in the Foshan hardware market who were just meters away yet failed to respond. He found that the area where the incident occurred was inhabited mainly by internal migrant families (the Wangs had migrated from Shandong seven years earlier). In the writer's view, there was little sense of community and little in common there. One resident noted, \"It is quite sad that we don't really talk to each other.\"\n\nWhile media outlets reported on the perceived Chinese apathy in the aftermath of Wang Yue's death, another incident occurred in Hangzhou when a Chinese woman attempted suicide by drowning in a lake, while local Chinese bystanders gathered at the edge of the lake to watch. After noticing that no one was attempting to rescue the woman, a Uruguayan visitor to China named Maria Fernanda Gomez Arregui swam into the water and saved the woman from drowning. Chinese government officials announced that Maria Fernanda would receive a cash reward of 3000 yuan for her heroic display of \"traditional Chinese virtues\". The rescue achieved a high profile after the media presented photographs by Wang Ronggui to contrast with the lack of action of bystanders in the death of Wang Yue, and several other similar deaths that occurred around the same time.\n\nLater incidents in China continue to be compared with the death of Wang Yue. In December 2012, a five-year-old boy named Yan Zhe received crush injuries from a minibus in Zhejiang province. Despite the pleas of the child's mother, other drivers and passers-by refused to help. He was eventually taken to a hospital but died on the way.\n\n"}

After an extensive search, portions of their bodies were found a few months later. Their cause of death could not be determined definitively, but Dutch authorities working with forensic and search-rescue investigators thought it likely the students had accidentally fallen from a cliff after becoming lost. The circumstances and aftermath of their disappearance have resulted in much speculation about the cause of death. Foul play could not be entirely ruled out and Panamanian officials came under fire for allegedly mishandling the disappearance and aftermath. Further investigation into the case in 2017 uncovered enough new evidence to suggest foul play, as well as a possible link to other murders in the area.\n\nLisanne Froon, 22, was described as aspiring, optimistic, intelligent, and a passionate volleyball player, and Kris Kremers, 21, as open, creative, and responsible. Both grew up in Amersfoort. Froon had graduated with a degree in Applied Sciences from Deventer the previous September, and Kremers had just completed her studies in cultural social education, specializing in art education at the University of Utrecht. Only a few weeks prior to leaving for Panama, Froon had moved in with Kremers in a dorm room in Amersfoort, and they worked together at the café/restaurant 'In den Kleinen Hap'. They both saved up money for six months and planned to go to Panama together on a special trip to learn Spanish, as well as to do something of significance for the locals, particularly volunteering with children. The trip was also supposed to be a reward to Froon for graduating.\n\nKremers and Froon arrived in Panama for a six-week vacation on March 15, 2014. They toured Panama for two weeks before arriving in Boquete on March 29 to live with a local family for a month while volunteering with children. On April 1, they went hiking with their hosts' dog around 11:00 near the clouded forests that surrounded the Baru volcano, possibly the trail of Pianista, not far from Boquete. They wrote on Facebook that they intended to walk around Boquete, and it was reported that they had been seen having brunch with two young Dutch men before embarking on the trail.\n\nTheir hosts became alarmed when their dog returned home that night without the young women. Froon's parents stopped receiving text messages, which both women had been sending to their families daily. On the morning of April 2, Froon and Kremers missed an appointment with a local guide. On April 3, authorities began aerial searches of the forest and local residents began searching. On April 6, the parents of Kremers and Froon arrived in Panama along with police, dog units, and detectives from the Netherlands to conduct a full-scale search of the forests for ten days. The parents offered a US$30,000 reward.\n\nTen weeks later, a local woman turned in Froon's blue backpack, which she said she had found in a rice paddy by a riverbank near her village of Alto Romero, in the Bocas del Toro region. She said she was sure it had not been there the day before. The backpack contained two pairs of sunglasses, US$83 in cash, Froon's passport, a water bottle, Froon's camera, two bras, and the women's phonesall packed, dry, and in good condition. The women's phones showed that some hours after the start of their hike, someone had dialed 112 (the international emergency number) and 911 (the emergency number in Panama).\n\nThe first distress call had been made just hours after beginning their hike: one from Kremers's iPhone at 16:39 and shortly after that, one from Froon's Samsung Galaxy at 16:51. None of the calls had gone through due to a lack of reception in the area except for one 911 call attempt on April 3 that lasted for a little over a second before breaking up. After April 5, Froon's phone battery became exhausted after 05:00 and was not used again. Kremers's iPhone would not make any more calls either but was intermittently turned on to search for reception. After April 6, multiple attempts of a false PIN code were entered into the iPhone; it never received the correct code again. One report showed that between 7 and 10 April, there were 77 emergency call attempts with the iPhone. On April 11, the phone was turned on at 10:51, and was turned off for the last time at 11:56.\n\nFroon's camera contained photos from April 1 suggesting that the women had taken a trail at the overlook of the Continental Divide and wandered into some wilderness hours before their first attempt to reach 911, but with no signs of anything unusual. On April 8, ninety flash photos were taken between 01:00 and 04:00, apparently deep in the jungle and in near-complete darkness. A few photos show that they were possibly near a river or a ravine. Some show a twig with plastic bags and candy wrappers on top of a rock, another shows what looks like toilet paper and a mirror on another rock, and another shows the back of Kremers's head with what looks like blood by her temple.\n\nThe discovery of the backpack led to new searches along the Culebra. Kremers' jean shorts, zipped and neatly folded, were found atop a rock on the opposite bank of the tributary a few kilometers away from where Froon's backpack had been discovered (although later witnesses would claim the jeans were not neatly folded but found in the river itself). Two months later, closer to where the backpack was discovered, a pelvis and a boot with a foot inside were found. Soon at least 33 widely scattered bones were discovered along the same river bank. DNA testing confirmed they belonged to Froon and Kremers. Froon's bones still had some skin attached to them, but Kremers's bones appeared to have been bleached. A Panamanian forensic anthropologist later claimed that under magnification \"there are no discernible scratches of any kind on the bones, neither of natural nor cultural origin—there are no marks on the bones at all.\"\n"}

{"id": "3368580", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3368580", "title": "Dynamic energy budget theory", "text": "Dynamic energy budget theory\n\nThe Dynamic Energy Budget (DEB) theory is a formal metabolic theory which provides a single quantitative framework to dynamically describe the aspects of metabolism (energy and mass budgets) of all living organisms at the individual level, based on assumptions about energy uptake, storage, and utilization of various substances. The DEB theory adheres to stringent thermodynamic principles, is motivated by universally observed patterns, is non-species specific, and links different levels of biological organization (cells, organisms, and populations) as prescribed by the implications of energetics. Models based on the DEB theory have been successfully applied to over a 1000 species with real-life applications ranging from conservation, aquaculture, general ecology, and ecotoxicology (see also the Add-my-pet collection). The theory is contributing to the theoretical underpinning of the emerging field of metabolic ecology.\n\nThe explicitness of the assumptions and the resulting predictions enable testing against a wide variety of experimental results at the various levels of biological organization. The theory explains many general observations, such as the body size scaling relationships of certain physiological traits, and provides a theoretical underpinning to the widely used method of indirect calorimetry. Several popular empirical models are special cases of the DEB model, or very close numerical approximations.\n\nThe theory presents simple mechanistic rules that describe the uptake and allocation of energy (and nutrients) and the consequences for physiological organization throughout an organism's life cycle, including the relationships of energetics with aging and effects of toxicants. Assumptions of the DEB theory are delineated in an explicit way, the approach clearly distinguishes mechanisms associated with intra‐ and interspecific variation in metabolic rates, and equations for energy flows are mathematically derived following the principles of physics and simplicity.\n\nCornerstones of the theory are:\n\n\nThe theory specifies that an organism is made up two main compartments: (energy) reserve and structure. Assimilation of energy is proportional to surface area of the structure, and maintenance is proportional to its volume. Reserve does not require maintenance. Energy mobilization will depend on the relative amount of the energy reserve, and on the interface between reserve and structure. Once mobilized, the energy is split into two branches:\n\n\nThe κ-rule therefore states that the processes of growth and maturation do not directly compete. Maintenance needs to be paid before allocating energy to other processes.\n\nIn the context of energy acquisition and allocation, the theory recognizes three main developmental stages: embryo, which does not feed or reproduce, juvenile, which feeds but does not reproduce, and adult, which both feeds and is allocating energy to reproduction. Transitions between these life stages occur at events specified as birth and puberty, which are reached when energy invested into maturation (tracked as 'level of maturity') reaches a certain threshold. Maturity does not increase in the adult stage, and maturity maintenance is proportional to maturity.\n\nBiochemical composition of reserve and structure is considered to be that of generalised compounds, and is constant (the assumption of strong homeostasis) but not necessarily identical. Biochemical transformation from food to reserve (assimilation), and from reserve to structure (growth) include overhead costs. These overheads, together with processes of somatic and maturity maintenance and reproduction overheads (inefficiencies in transformation from reserve to reproductive material), all contribute to the consumption of oxygen and production of carbon dioxide, i.e. metabolism.\n\nAll dynamic energy budget models follow the energy budget of an individual organism throughout its life cycle; by contrast,\"static\" energy budget models describe a specific life stage or size of an organism. The main advantage of the DEB-theory based model over most other models is its description of energy assimilation and utilization (reserve dynamics) simultaneously with decoupled processes of growth, development/ maturation, and maintenance. DEB theory specifies reserves as separate from structure: these are the two state variables that contribute to physical volume, and (in combination with reproduction buffer of adults) fully define the size of an individual. Maturity (also a state variable of the model) tracks how much energy has been invested into maturation, and therefore determines the life stage of the organism relative to maturity levels at which life stage transitions (birth and puberty) occur. Dynamics of the state variables are given by ordinary differential equations which include the major processes of energy uptake and use: assimilation, mobilization, maintenance, growth, maturation, and reproduction.\n\n\nParameters of the model are individual specific, but similarities between individuals of the same species yield species-specific parameter estimations. DEB parameters are estimated from several types of data simultaneously. Routines for data entry and parameter estimation are available as free software package DEBtool implemented in the MATLAB environment, with the process of model construction explained in a Wiki-style manual. Estimated parameters are collected in the online library called the Add-my-pet project.\n\nThe standard model quantifies the metabolism of an isomorph (organism that does not change in shape during ontogeny) that feeds on one type of food with a constant composition (therefore the weak homeostasis applies, i.e. the chemical composition of the body is constant). The state variables of the individual are 1 reserve, 1 structure, maturity, and (in the adult stage) the reproduction buffer. Parameter values are constant throughout life. The reserve density at birth equals that of the mother at egg formation. Foetuses develop similarly, but receive unrestricted amount of reserve from the mother during development.\n\nDEB theory has been extended into many directions, such as \n\nA list and description of most common typified models can be found here.\n\nThe main criticism is directed to the formal presentation of the theory (heavy mathematical jargon), number of listed parameters, the symbol heavy notation, and the fact that modeled (state) variables and parameters are abstract quantities which cannot be directly measured, all making it less likely to reach its intended audience (ecologists) and be an \"efficient\" theory.\n\nHowever, more recent publications aim to present the DEB theory in an \"easier to digest\" content to \"bridge the ecology-mathematics gap\". The general methodology of estimation of DEB parameters from data is described in van der Meer 2006; Kooijman et al 2008 shows which particular compound parameters can be estimated from a few simple observations at a single food density and how an increasing number of parameters can be estimated if more quantities are observed at several food densities. A natural sequence exists in which parameters can be known in principle. In addition, routines for data entry and scripts for parameter estimation are available as a free and documented software package DEBtool, aiming to provide a ready-to-use tool for users with less mathematical and programing background. Number of parameters, also pointed as relatively sparse for a bioenergetic model, vary depending on the main application and, because the whole life cycle of an organism is defined, the overall number of parameters per data-set ratio is relatively low. Linking the DEB (abstract) and measured properties is done by simple mathematical operations which include auxiliary parameters (also defined by the DEB theory and included in the DEBtool routines), and include also switching between energy-time and mass-time contexts. Add my pet (AmP) project explores parameter pattern values across taxa. The DEB notation is a result of combining the symbols from the main fields of science (biology, chemistry, physics, mathematics) used in the theory, while trying to keep the symbols consistent. As the symbols themselves contain a fair bit of information (see DEB notation document), they are kept in most of the DEB literature.\n\nDynamic energy budget theory presents a quantitative framework of metabolic organization common to all life forms, which could help to understand evolution of metabolic organization since the origin of life. As such, it has a common aim with the other widely used metabolic theory: the West-Brown-Enquist (WBE) metabolic theory of ecology, which prompted side-by-side analysis of the two approaches. Though the two theories can be regarded as complimentary to an extent, they were built on different assumptions and have different scope of applicability. In addition to a more general applicability, the DEB theory does not suffer from consistency issues pointed out for the WBE theory.\n\n\nMany more examples of applications have been published in scientific literature.\n\n\n\n"}

Goldratt\n\nEliyahu Moshe Goldratt (March 31, 1947 – June 11, 2011) was an Israeli business management guru. He was the originator of the Optimized Production Technique, the Theory of Constraints (TOC), the Thinking Processes, Drum-Buffer-Rope, Critical Chain Project Management (CCPM) and other TOC derived tools.\n\nHe was the author of several business novels and non-fiction works, mainly on the application of the theory of constraints to various manufacturing, engineering, and other business processes.\n\nThe processes are typically modeled as resource flows, the constraints typically represent limits on flows. In his book \"The Goal\", the protagonist is a manager in charge of a troubled manufacturing operation. At any point in time, one particular constraint (such as inadequate capacity at a machine tool) limits total system throughput, and when the constraint is resolved, another constraint becomes the critical one. The plot of Goldratt's stories revolve around identifying the current limiting constraint and raising it, which is followed by finding out which is the next limiting constraint. Another common theme is that the system being analyzed has excess capacity at a number of non-critical points, which, contrary to conventional wisdom, is absolutely essential to ensure constant operation of the constrained resource.\n\nGoldratt was born into a rabbinic family, the son of Avraham-Yehuda Goldrat, in British Mandatory Palestine one year prior to Israel's modern statehood. He obtained BSc degree from Tel Aviv University; Israel, and MSc and PhD degrees from Bar-Ilan University; Israel. Goldratt died June 11, 2011 at noon, in his home in Israel. \n\nAfter some experience helping Israeli manufacturers, Goldratt left the academic world to join a company called Creative Output. The company developed and sold a software package, the Optimized Production Technology (OPT). OPT was billed as the first software to provide finite capacity scheduling for production environments. This software and the principles behind it were analyzed by a number of major publications\n\nGoldratt was actively involved in many controversies such as Cost Accounting v Throughput Accounting and culminated in the publication of \"A Town Without Walls\".\n\nWithin the company, Goldratt noticed elements that made him uncomfortable several software implementations did not come close to their estimated potential. After some work, Goldratt discovered that the habits and assumptions (paradigms) of employees and managers prior to using the software were still prominent and negatively influenced results after implementation.\n\nHis answer was the book The Goal that took 13 months to write. After completion, the book was not well received by the company staff and by large publishers. Finally, with help from Larry Gadd the owner of North River Press, the book was published and became a great success. After a while, Goldratt noticed that many implementations were conducted using the Book but not the software. This caused further stress in the company and Goldratt tried to capture the essence of how to implement the solution directly in what is now known as Drum-Buffer-Rope method. He published The Race to explain some of the concepts he was working on and developed a course to teach people how to manage their production using a computer simulation game.\n\nGoldratt tried to move the company down the path of \"consulting,\" trying to help people rethink the way they did things, but Creative Output's declining revenues and Goldratt involvement with anything but the sales of OPT software convinced the shareholders to fire Goldratt (and afterward his closer collaborators).\n\nAfter leaving Creative Output circa 1985, Goldratt created the Avraham Y Goldratt Institute or AGI (named after his father) to promote the Theory of Constraints and help it be implemented worldwide.\n\nDuring the time of the AGI, Goldratt got deeply involved with the further development of TOC, mainly the Thinking Processes (and launched it publicly in 1991), Critical Chain Project Management and other applications. His concepts influenced applications outside manufacturing and supply management, including the field of sales process engineering.\n\nIn 1997, Goldratt followed his plan to retire from the Institute prior to his 50th birthday.\n\nFrom the beginning of the 2000s, Goldratt created the self-funded Goldratt Group and launched the Viable Vision initiative.\n\nHe continued the development of TOC both in the Goldratt Group and in active support for other developments like TOC for Education, TOC in Healthcare, TOC for the Individual (in the continuity of the Odyssey Program, and the publishing of \"The Choice\").\n\nGoldratt produced many works. Some of the more noteworthy are:\n\nMore recent works:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "36053717", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36053717", "title": "Endogenous regeneration", "text": "Endogenous regeneration\n\nEndogenous regeneration in the brain is the ability of cells to engage in the repair and regeneration process. While the brain has a limited capacity for regeneration, endogenous neural stem cells, as well as numerous pro-regenerative molecules, can participate in replacing and repairing damaged or diseased neurons and glial cells. Another benefit that can be achieved by using endogenous regeneration could be avoiding an immune response from the host.\n\nDuring the early development of a human, neural stem cells lie in the germinal layer of the developing brain, ventricular and subventricular zones. In brain development, multipotent stem cells (those that can generate different types of cells) are present in these regions, and all of these cells differentiate into neural cell forms, such as neurons, oligodendrocytes and astrocytes. A long-held belief states that the multipotency of neural stem cells would be lost in the adult human brain. However, it is only \"in vitro\", using neurosphere and adherent monolayer cultures, stem cells that can be found in the adult mammalian brain that have shown mutipotent capacity, while the \"in vivo\" study is not convincing. Therefore, the term \"neural progenitor\" is used instead of \"stem cell\" to describe limited regeneration ability in the adult brain stem cell.\n\nNeural stem cells (NSC) reside in the subventricular zone (SVZ) of the adult human brain and the dentate gyrus of the adult mammalian hippocampus. Newly formed neurons from these regions participate in learning, memory, olfaction and mood modulation. It has not been definitively determined whether or not these stem cells are multipotents. NSC from the hippocampus of rodents, which can differentiate into dentate granule cells, have developed into many cell types when studied in culture. However, another \"in vivo\" study, using NSCs in the postnatal SVZ, showed that the stem cell is restricted to developing into different neuronal sub-type cells in the olfactory bulb. It is believed that the various spatial location niches regulate the differentiation of the neural stem cell.\n\nSantiago Ramon y Cajal, a neuroscience pioneer, concluded that the generation of neurons occurs only in the prenatal phase of human development, not after birth. This theory had long been the fundamental principle of neuroscience. However, in the mid-20th century, evidence of adult mammalian neurogenesis was found in rodent hippocampus and other region of the brain.\nIn the intact adult mammalian brain, neuroregeneration maintains the function and structure of the central nervous system (CNS). The most adult stem cells in the brain are found in the subventricular zone at the lateral walls of the lateral ventricle. Another region where neurogenesis takes place in the adult brain is the subgranular zone (SGZ) of the dentate gyrus in the hippocampus. While the exact mechanism that maintains functional NSCs in these regions is still unknown, NSCs have shown an ability to restore neurons and glia in response to certain pathological conditions. However, so far, this regeneration by NSCs is insufficient to restore the full function and structure of an injured brain. However, endogenous neuroregeneration, unlike using embryonic stem cell implantation, is anticipated to treat damaged CNS without immunogenesis or tumorigenesis.\n\nProgenitor cells in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus migrate to the nearby location and differentiate into granule cells. As a part of the limbic system, new neurons of the hippocampus maintain the function of controlling mood, learning and memory. In the dentate gyrus, putative stem cells, called type 1 cells, proliferate into type 2 and type 3 cells, which are transiently amplifying, lineage-determined progenitor cells. Type 1 cells in the hippocampus are multipotent \"in vitro\". However, although there is evidence that both new neurons and glia are generated in the hippocampus \"in vivo\", no exact relationship of neurogenesis to type 1 cells is shown.\n\nIn the hippocampus, newly formed neurons contribute only a small portion to the entire neuron population. These new neurons have different electrophysiology compared to the rest of the existing neurons. This may be evidence that generating new neurons in the SGZ is part of learning and memorizing activity of mammals. Several studies have been performed to explain the relationship between neruogenesis and learning. In the case of learning, that related to the hippocampal function, a significantly increased number of neurons are generated in the SGZ and survival of the new neurons is increased if they are required for retention of memory.\nIn addition to learning and memorizing, neurogenesis in the SGZ is also affected by mood and emotion. With constant, inescapable stress, which usually results in emotional depression, there is a significant decrease in neurogensis, the effect of which can be reversed by treatment with fluoxetine.\n\nThe largest NSC population in the brain is found in the SVZ. The SVZ is considered a micro-environment called a \"stem cell niche\" that retains the NSC's capacity of self-renewing and multipotency. Basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF2), hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), Notch-1, sonic hedgehog (SHH), noggin, ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF), and a soluble carbohydrate-binding protein, Galectin-1, are reported as factors that maintain such properties of NSC in stem cell niche. Like stem cells in SGZ, progenitor cells in SVZ also differentiate into neurons and form an intermediate cell called a transiently amplifying cell (TAC). A recent study revealed that beta-catenin signaling, Wnt β-catenin, regulates the differentiation of TAC.\n\nNSCs in the SVZ have a distinct capacity to migrate into the olfactory bulb in the anterior tip of the telencephalon\nby a pathway called the rostral migratory stream (RMS). This migration is unique to new neurons in the SVZ that embryonic neurogenesis and nerogenesis at other region of the brain are not able to perform. Another unique neurogensis in the SVZ is neurogenesis by astrocytes. A study done by Doetsch (1999) showed that astrocytes in the SVZ can be dedifferentiate and differentiate into neurons in the olfactory bulb. Among four types of cells in the SVZ (migrating neuroblasts, immature precursors, astrocytes, and ependymal cells), migrating neuroblasts and immature precursors are silenced with the anti-mitotic agent and astrocytes are infected with a retrovirus. In the result, neurons that have the retrovirus are found in the olfactory bulb.\n\nNeurogenesis in the adult mammalian brain is affected by various factors, including exercise, stroke, brain insult and pharmacological treatments. For example, kainic acid-induced seizures, antidepressant (fluoxetine), neurotransmitters such as GABA and growth factors (fibroblast growth factors (FGFs), epidermal growth factor (EGF), neuregulins (NRGs), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF) induce formation of neuroblasts. The final destination of NSCs is determined by \"niche\" signals. Wnt signaling drives NSCs to the formation of new neurons in the SGZ, whereas bone morphogenic proteins (BMPs) promote NSC differentiation into glia cells in the SVZ.\n\nHowever, in the case of brain injury, neurogenesis seems insufficient to repair damaged neurons. Thus, Cajal's theory was accepted for a long time. In actuality, in the intercranial physiological condition, many neurogenesis inhibitors are present (for example, axon growth-inhibitory ligands expressed in oligodendrocytes, myelin, NG2-glia, and reactive astrocytes in the lesion and degenerating tracts, and fibroblasts in scar tissue). The inhibitory ligands bind to growth cone receptors on a damaged neuron, which causes repulsion and collapse of the growth cone in the damaged regions. Among inhibitory factors, oligodendrocyte and myelin-derived inhibitory ligands are membrane-bound, meaning that, in the case of injury, those factors are not upregulated or overexpressed, rather it is from direct contact between intact or degraded myelin (or oligodendrocytes) and newly forming neurons.\n\nNevertheless, with scar formation, many cell types in the brain release growth-inhibitory ligands such as basal lamina components, inhibitory axon guidance molecules and chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans.\nInhibitory action of such factors may be a protection of the brain from inflammation. Okano and Sawamoto used an astrocyte-selective conditional Stat3-deficient mice model to examine the role of reactive astrocytes. The result was increased widespread CD11b-positive inflammatory cell invasion and demyelination.\n\nBrain damage itself can induce endogenous regeneration. Many studies have proven endogenous regeneration as a possible treatment of brain damage. However, the inhibitory reaction of the surrounding tissue of damaged region must be overcome before the treatment produces significant improvement.\n\nIn the study of the endogenous regeneration of the brain done by Scharff and co-researchers, damaged neurons in a songbird brain are regenerated with the same neuronal types where regeneration occurs (in the case of the study, the hippocampus). However, in places where normal regeneration of the neuron does not occur, there was no replacement of damaged neurons. Thus, recovering brain function after a brain injury was supposed to have limitations. However, a current study revealed that neurons are repaired to some degree after damage, from the SVZ.\n\nThe migrating ability of progenitor cells in the SVZ form chain-like structures and laterally move progenitor cells towards the injured region. Along with progenitor cells, thin astrocytic processes and blood vessels also play an important role in the migration of neuroblasts, suggesting that the blood vessels may act as a scaffold. Other factors that contribute of the migration are slit proteins (produced at the choroid plexus) and their gradient (generated by the flow of cerebrospinal fluid). However, only 0.2% of new neurons survived and functioned in this study. Enhancing neurogenesis can be done by injecting growth factors such as fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2) and epidermal growth factor (EGF). However, enhanced neurogenesis also have the possibility of epilepsy resulting in prolonged seizures.\n\nAlthough endogenous regeneration methods are showing some promising evidence in treating brain ischemia, the current body of knowledge regarding promoting and inhibiting endogenous regeneration is not sufficient to treat Parkinson's disease. Both extrinsic and intrinsic modulation of pathological and physiological stimulation prevent the progenitor cell from differentiating into dopamine cells. Further research must be done to understand factors that affect progenitor cell differentiation in order to treat Parkinson's disease.\n\nDespite the difficulties in replacing compromised dopamine neurons through endogenous sources, recent work suggests that pharmacological activation of endogenous neural stem cells or neural precursor cells results in powerful neuronal rescue and motor skill improvements through a signal transduction pathway that involves the phosphorylation of STAT3 on the serine residue and subsequent Hes3 expression increase (STAT3-Ser/Hes3 Signaling Axis).\n"}

One method of obtaining this estimate uses the time and pattern of arthropod colonization. This method will provide an estimation of the period of insect activity, which may or may not correlate exactly with the time of death. While insect successional data may not provide as accurate an estimate during the early stages of decomposition as developmental data, it is applicable for later decompositional stages and can be accurate for periods up to a few years.\n\nDecomposition is a continuous process that is commonly divided into stages for convenience of discussion. When studying decomposition from an entomological point of view and for the purpose of applying data to human death investigations, the domestic pig Sus scrofa (Linnaeus) is considered to be the preferred human analogs. In entomological studies, five stages of decomposition are commonly described: (1) Fresh, (2) Bloat, (3) Active Decay, (4) Advanced or Post-Decay, and (5) Dry Remains. While the pattern of arthropod colonization follows a reasonably predictable sequence, the limits of each stage of decomposition will not necessarily coincide with a major change in the faunal community. Therefore, the stages of decomposition are defined by the observable physical changes to the state of the carcass. A pattern of insect succession results as different carrion insects are attracted to the varying biological, chemical and physical changes a carcass undergoes throughout the process of decay.\nA decaying carcass provides \"a temporarily, rapidly changing resource which supports a large, dynamic arthropod community.\" --M. Grassberger and C. Frank \n\nThe fresh stage of decomposition is generally described as the period between the moment of death and when the first signs of bloat are apparent. There are no outward signs of physical change, though internal bacteria have begun to digest organ tissues. No odor is associated with the carcass. Early post-mortem changes, used by pathologists as medical markers for early post-mortem interval estimations, have been described by Goff and include livor mortis, rigor mortis and algor mortis.\n\nThe first insects to arrive at decomposing remains are usually Calliphoridae, commonly referred to as blow flies. These flies have been reported to arrive within minutes of death or exposure, and deposit eggs within 1–3 hours. Adult flies of the families Sarcophagidae (flesh flies) and Muscidae are also common in this first stage of decomposition. First eggs are laid in or near the natural orifices of the head and anus, as well as at the site of perimortem wounds. Depending on the rate of decomposition and the development time of particular blowfly species, eggs may hatch and young larvae begin to feed on tissues and liquids while the carcass is still classified in the fresh stage.\n\nAdult ants may also be seen at a carcass during the fresh stage. Ants will feed both on the carcass flesh as well as eggs and young larvae of first arriving flies.\n\nThe first visible sign of the Bloat Stage is a slight inflation of the abdomen and some blood bubbles at the nose. Activity of anaerobic bacteria in the abdomen create gases, which accumulate and results in abdominal bloating. A colour change is observed in the carcass flesh, along with the appearance of marbling. During the bloat stage the odor of putrefaction becomes noticeable.\n\nBlowflies remain present in great numbers during the bloat stage, and blowflies, flesh flies and muscids continue to lay eggs. Insects of the families Piophilidae and Fanniidae arrive during the bloat stage. Ants continue to feed on the eggs and young larvae of flies.\n\nThe first species of Coleoptera arrive during the bloat stage of decomposition, including members of the families Staphylinidae (rove beetles), Silphidae (carrion beetles) and Cleridae. These beetles are observed feeding on fly eggs and larvae. Beetle species from the families Histeridae may also be collected during this stage, and are often hidden beneath remains.\n\nThe beginning of active decay stage is marked by the deflation of the carcass as feeding Dipteran larvae pierce the skin and internal gases are released. During this stage the carcass has a characteristic wet appearance due to the liquefaction of tissues. Flesh from the head and around the anus and umbilical cord is removed by larval feeding activity. A strong odor of putrefaction is associated with the carcass.\n\nFeeding larvae of Calliphoridae flies are the dominant insect group at carcasses during the active decay stage. At the beginning of the stage larvae are concentrated in natural orifices, which offer the least resistance to feeding. Towards later stages, when flesh has been removed from the head and orifices, larvae become more concentrated in the thoracic and abdominal cavities.\n\nAdult calliphorids and muscids decreased in numbers during this stage, and were not observed to be mating. However, non-Calliphoridae Dipterans are collected from carcasses. The first members of Sepsidae arrive at the carcass during the active decay stage. Members of Coleoptera become the dominant adult insects at the site of remains. In particular, the numbers of staphylinids and histerids increase.\n\nMost of the flesh is removed from the carcass during the advanced decay stage, though some flesh may remain in the abdominal cavity. Strong odors of decomposition begin to fade.\n\nThis stage marks the first mass migration of third instar calliphorid larvae from the carcass Piophilidae larvae may also be collected at this stage. Few adult calliphoridae are attracted to carcasses in advanced decay. Adult Dermestidae (skin beetles) arrive at the carcass; adult dermestid beetles may be common, whereas larval stages are not\n\nThe final stage of decomposition is dry remains. Payne described a total of six stages of decay, the last two being separate dry and remains. As these stages are nearly impossible to distinguish between, many entomological studies combine the two into a single final stage. Very little remains of the carcass in this stage, mainly bones, cartilage and small bits of dried skin. There is little to no odor associated with remains. Any odor present may range from that of dried skin to wet fur.\n\nThe greatest number of species are reported to occur in the late decay and dry stages. The dry decay stage is characterized by the movement from previously dominant carrion fauna to new species. Very few adult calliphorids are attracted to the carcass at this stage, and adult piophilids emerge. The dermestid beetles, common in advanced decay, leave the carcass. Non-carrion organisms that commonly arrive at remains in dry decay are centipedes, millipedes, isopods, snails and cockroaches.\n\nUnderstanding how a corpse decomposes and the factors that may alter the rate of decay is extremely important for evidence in death investigations. Campobasso, Vella, and Introna consider the factors that may inhibit or favor the colonization of insects to be vitally important when determining the time of insect colonization.\n\nLow temperatures generally slow down the activity of blow-flies and their colonization of a body. Higher temperatures in the summer favor large maggot masses on the carrion. Dry and windy environments can dehydrate a corpse, leading to mummification. Dryness causes cessation in bacterial growth since there are no nutrients present to feed on.\n\nAccess to the body can limit which insects can get to the body in order to feed and lay eggs. Those circumstances that enhance the availability of corpses for arthropod colonization are called \"physical barriers\". For example, corpses found in brightly lit areas are generally inhabited by \"Lucilia illustris\", in contrast to \"Phormia regina\", which prefers more shaded areas. Darkness, cold, and rain limit the amount of insects that would otherwise colonize the body. A submerged corpse can vary in temperature and is colonized by very few terrestrial insects. Fish, crustaceans, aquatic insects and bacteria would be the likely fauna in this case. Bodies that have been buried are harder to get to than freely available bodies which limits the availability of certain insects to colonize. The Coffin fly \"Megaselia scalaris\" is one of the few fly species seen on buried bodies because it has the ability to dig up to six feet underground to reach a body and oviposit.\n\nScavengers and carnivores such as wolves, dogs, cats, beetles, and other insects feeding on the remains of a carcass can make determining the time of insect colonization much harder. This is because the decomposition process has been interrupted by factors that may speed up decomposition. Corpses with open wounds, whether pre or post mortem, tend to decompose faster due to easier insect access. The cause of death likewise can leave openings in the body that allow insects and bacteria access to the inside body cavities in earlier stages of decay. Flies oviposit eggs inside natural openings and wounds that may become exaggerated when the eggs hatch and the larvae begin feeding.\n\nWraps, garments, and clothing have shown to affect the rate of decomposition because the corpse is covered by some type of barrier. Wraps, such as tight fighting tarps can advance the stages of decay during warm weather when the body is outside. However, loose fitting coverings that are open on the ends may aid colonization of certain insect species and keep the insects protected from the outside environment. This boost in colonization can lead to faster decomposition. Clothing also provides a protective barrier between the body and insects that can delay stages of decomposition. For instance, if a corpse is wearing a heavy jacket, this can slow down decomposition in that particular area and insects will colonize elsewhere. Bodies that are covered in pesticides or in an area surrounded in pesticides may be slow to have insect colonization. The absence of insects feeding on the body would slow down the rate of decomposition.\n\nMore fat on the body allows for faster decomposition. This is due to the composition of fat, which is high in water content. Larger corpses with higher percent body fat also tend to retain heat much longer than corpses with less body fat. Higher temperatures favor the reproduction of bacteria inside high nutrient areas of the liver and other organs.\n\nOn occasion, drugs that are present in the body at death can also affect how fast insects break down the corpse. Development of these insects can be sped up by cocaine and slowed down by drugs containing arsenic.\n\nNew research in the related field entomotoxicology is currently studying the effects of drugs on the development of insects who have fed on the decomposing tissue of a drug user. The effects of drugs and toxins on insect development are proving to be an important factor when determining the insect colonization time. It has been shown that cocaine use can accelerate the development of maggots. In one case, \"Lucilia sericata\" larvae that fed in the nasal cavity of a cocaine abuser, grew over 8 mm longer than larvae of the same generation found elsewhere on the body. Other researchers in entomotoxicology are developing techniques to detect and measure drug levels in older fly pupae. This research is useful for determining cause of death for bodies that are found during later stages of decay. To this date, bromazepam, levomepromazine, malathion, phenobarbital, trazolam, oxazepam, alimemazine, clomipramine, morphine, mercury, and copper have been recovered from maggots.\n\nUnderstanding the stages of decomposition, the colonization of insects, and factors that may affect decomposition and colonization are key in determining forensically important information about the body. Different insects colonize the body throughout the stage of decomposition. In entomological studies these stages are commonly described as fresh, bloat, active decay, advanced decay and dry decay. Studies have shown that each stage is characterized by particular insect species, the succession of which depends on chemical and physical properties of remains, rate of decomposition and environmental factors. Insects associated with decomposing remains may be useful in determining post-mortem interval, manner of death, and the association of suspects. Insect species and their times of colonization will vary according to the geographic region, and therefore may help determine if remains have been moved.\n\n"}

It is thought to have been a main-sequence star of spectral type A0V with around three times the mass of the Sun that has aged and passed through a red-giant phase, leaving a dense, hot remnant that has around 70% of the Sun's mass and a surface temperature of 17,280 K. It is thought to be around 600 million years old, including both its life as a main-sequence star and as a white dwarf. It has an apparent magnitude of 14.8. GD 61 was first noted as a potential degenerate star in 1965, in a survey of white-dwarf suspects by astronomers from the Lowell Observatory in Arizona.\n\nIn 2013, a circumstellar disk that resulted from the destruction of a water-rich asteroid was detected in close orbit around GD 61, which makes this the first detection of solid or liquid water on an extrasolar body. This asteroid would originally have been 26% water by mass, close to the water content of Ceres. This evidence suggests that a planet, with a rocky surface similar to Earth's, may have existed in the past, with the asteroid thus being an artifact from this period, now possibly part of a debris field from the hypothetical planet's breakup. Such a planet would have had both a rocky surface and water, two key ingredients for life. The researchers used the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph on the Hubble Space Telescope to determine the elemental composition. The elements magnesium, silicon, iron, and oxygen were detected, all components of rocky planets, although the levels of oxygen were much higher than what could be accounted for. The lack of associated carbon left only one candidate for the oxygen excess—water.\n\n"}

It sets out a history of moral philosophy and presents new ideas in ethics, which have been described as quasi-utilitarianism.\n\n\"How to Make Good Decisions and Be Right All the Time\" has forty chapters, which are grouped into six parts.\n\nFor ethical advice to be credible, the book says it cannot be perceived as arbitrary. The book cites The Dice Man – a man who makes choices based on dice rolls – as an example of advice-following which is arbitrary and so cannot be regarded as ethical.\n\nChapter three argues intuitions about what we should do can be more useful, but are undermined because our multiple intuitions often lead to contradictory advice (e.g. ‘help a stranger’ or ‘put family first’?). Philosophers have sought to eliminate these contradictions by locating right and wrong in a single part of the decision-making process: for example, in the actions we take (e.g. Kant), in our character (e.g. Aristotle, virtue ethics) or in the consequences of our actions (e.g. Utilitarianism).\n\nChapter four explains how ‘do whatever is best’ (utilitarianism) still dominates modern philosophical and economic thinking.\n\nChapter five cites seven faults with utilitarianism. These are that it can be self-defeating; that it considers only future events and ignores the past; that it places decision-making authority in questionable hands; that it doesn’t discriminate fairly between people; that it sacrifices individual concerns to the group interest; that it down-grades promises, fairness and truth-telling; and that it doesn’t offer any clear rules. The chapter also argues that the main argument for utilitarianism is invalid, and ‘empty’.\n\nPart II starts with a secular revision of Pascal’s Wager, arguing “What does it hurt to pursue value and virtue? If there is value, then we have everything to gain, but if there is none, then we haven’t lost anything.” Thus, it rationally makes sense for us to pursue something of value.\n\nIt says that “people ultimately derive their choices from what they want to do and what other people want to do” \n\nIt then presents four different arguments for deriving a basic principle from which right and wrong can be developed. These are an adaptation of utilitarianism; an adaptation of John Rawls' theory; an argument from evolutionary theory; and a 'Sherlock Holmes' approach.\n\nAll four arguments converge on empathy, obligation and the ‘Help Principle’, which the book argues are kernels of a viable ethical system. According to Audrey Tang, King's philosophy advocates: \"If spending one unit of your effort could help another person by two units, he detailed in his book, you should help.\"\n\nPart III defines the Help Principle more carefully, with a section on autonomy, and a critique of the golden rule.\n\nIt results in an approach to ethics which combines deontology, consequentialism and virtue ethics. This has been described as quasi-utilitarianism.\n\nPart IV attempts to distinguish white lies from bad lies. Contradicting Aristotle, who believed no general rule on lying was possible, 'For he who advocates lying can never be believed or trusted,' and St Augustine, who believed all lies were sinful, the book presents a definition of good lies, and argues why it is credible and superior.\n\nChapters 28 and 29 reconcile individual human rights with group interests. Both individual justice and social justice feature.\n\nPart V deals with situations when information is not certain, and other real world problems which are absent from much academic philosophy. These problems make effective altruism impractical and rare.\n\nChapter 34 argues that the notion of integrity can only make sense in ethics if it is applied to the consequences people allow to happen rather than to people themselves.\n\nPart VI claims a hybrid system can be internally-consistent and address several problems of the main schools of ethics.\n\nChapter 40 concludes it is impossible to make good decisions all the time because we can never know enough about the world, and the consequences of our actions. Hence, ethics can never emulate the scientific revolution by offering a simple set of rules for every situation, similar to those derived by Newton. This is because Newton’s own rules can never be applied perfectly, because we can never know how the world really is.\n\nIt was published on December 1, 2008. It became a bestseller within the category of philosophy books in 2013.\n\nThe book answers the Frege–Geach Problem, the Fact–Value Gap, and the Open Question Argument, although the given answers have been challenged.\n\nThe book has been used to reconcile utilitarian and rules-based ethics. \n\nHumanist psychologists have used the book to explain why only proven phenomena is needed to prove why morality exists, and what the parameters of morality should be. Theists have commented on the way the book grounds ethics without recourse to religion.\n\nThe book has been used in freshman philosophy classes, to teach teenagers, and in SATs.\n\n"}

Two victims, , age 10, and , age 11, were murdered by a 14-year-old boy under the alias .\n\nThe perpetrator was arrested on June 28, 1997 in connection with the Hase murder, and later confessed to both murders. As a juvenile offender, he was prosecuted and convicted as \"Boy A\". His real name has not been released to the press because Japanese law prohibits publishing the identification, but in some weekly magazines his real name has been reported. Beginning in 2004, \"Boy A\" was released on a provisional basis, with a full release announced to follow on January 1, 2005. The murders and subsequent release of the perpetrator gained widespread attention from Japanese media and politicians.\n\nOn May 27, 1997, the head of , a special education pupil at Tainohata Elementary School, was found in front of the school gate hours before pupils arrived for classes. Hase had been beheaded with a handsaw, with further mutilations being done before being left in front of the school, for students to discover when they arrived in the morning. A note, written in red pen, was found stuffed in his mouth, identifying the killer as \"Sakakibara.\" The note read:\n\n\"This is the beginning of the game... Try to stop me if you can you stupid police... I desperately want to see people die, it is a thrill for me to commit murder. A bloody judgment is needed for my years of great bitterness.\" Additionally, some English was on the note as well: \"shooll killer\".\n\nPolice commented that the style of Hase's killing and the note was reminiscent of that of the Zodiac murders in the San Francisco area during the late 1960s.\n\nOn June 6, a letter was sent to the newspaper \"Kobe Shinbun\", in which Sakakibara claimed responsibility for the slaying and decapitation of Jun Hase, and threatened that more killings would follow. This second letter, delivered in a brown envelope postmarked June 3, had no return address or name. Enclosed was a three-page, 1400-word letter, also written in red ink, which included a six-character name that can be pronounced as \"Sakakibara Seito\". The same characters, which mean \"alcohol\", \"devil\", \"rose\", \"saint\" and \"fight\", were used in the first message that was inserted into the boy's mouth.\n\nBeginning with the phrase \"Now, it's the beginning of a game\", the letter stated that \"I am putting my life at stake for the sake of this game... If I'm caught, I'll probably be hanged... police should be angrier and more tenacious in pursuing me... It's only when I kill that I am liberated from the constant hatred that I suffer and that I am able to attain peace. It is only when I give pain to people that I can ease my own pain.\" The letter also lashed out against the Japanese educational system, calling it \"compulsory education that formed me, an invisible person.\"\n\nIn the initial panic, the Japanese media misreported the name as \"Onibara\" - Demon's Rose, though the killer insisted it was as he gave it. Infuriated by the mixup, Sakakibara later wrote to the station, \"From now on, if you misread my name or spoil my mood I will kill three vegetables a week... If you think I can only kill children you are greatly mistaken.\" (In this context, the \"vegetables\" that Sakakibara meant were human).\n\nThe 14-year-old junior high school student was arrested as a suspect in the Hase murder on June 28. Shortly after his arrest, \"Boy A\" also confessed to the murder of 10-year-old Ayaka Yamashita (山下彩花 \"Yamashita Ayaka\") on March 16, as well as the assaults of three other girls on and around that same date. After the March 16 attack, he wrote in his diary: \"I carried out sacred experiments today to confirm how fragile human beings are... I brought the hammer down, when the girl turned to face me. I think I hit her a few times but I was too excited to remember.\" The following week, on March 23, he added: \"This morning my mom told me, 'Poor girl. The girl attacked seems to have died.' There is no sign of me being caught... I thank you, \"Bamoidōkishin\", for this... Please continue to protect me.\"\n\nAfter the murders, Japanese politician Shizuka Kamei called for restricting objectionable content, stating, \"Movies lacking any literary or educational merit made for just showing cruel scenes... Adults should be blamed for this\", and that \"[the incident] gives adults the chance to rethink the policy of self-imposed restrictions on these films and whether they should allow them just because they are profitable.\"\n\nIn 2000, the Diet lowered the age for criminal responsibility from 16 to 14. However, in the wake of the June 1, 2004 murder of Satomi Mitarai by 11-year-old \"Girl A\" (Sasebo slashing), there has been some discussion for the need for further revision.\n\nOn March 11, 2004, in an unprecedented act, the Japanese Ministry of Justice announced that Sakakibara, 21 at the time, was being released on a provisional basis, with a full release to follow on January 1, 2005. Critics have charged that since the government had taken the unusual step of notifying the public, that Sakakibara was likely not fit for release and should be transferred to prison. In the wake of the Sasebo slashing, three months later, this criticism was exacerbated.\n\nDue to the seriousness of the crimes and the fact that they had been committed by a minor, his name and new residence to this day remain a highly-guarded secret. Yet, his real name has been circulated on the Internet since June 29, 1997, according to journalist Fumihiko Takayama.\n\nA number of people, including Shōjirō Gotō (a lawyer who dealt with many false accusation cases), Hidehiko Kumagai and Nobuyoshi Iwata (former principal of the junior high school that Boy A attended), insist that Boy A was wrongfully accused and point out contradictions in the statements of the investigating authorities, for example:\n\nIn 2002, the boy's mother visited him in prison and asked him if he had really committed the crimes. He affirmed this to her.\n\nIn June 2015, Sakakibara, then aged 32, released an autobiography through Ohta Publishing called \"Zekka\" (絶歌), in which he expressed remorse for his crimes and recounted the murders in graphic detail. Despite attempts by Jun Hase's family to block the release of \"Zekka\", and despite one bookstore chain refusing to stock the book, it quickly reached the top of Japanese bestseller lists. A few months later, Sakakibara set up a vanity website in which he posted bizarre photoshopped images of a nude male, suggested to be himself. In response to these controversies, the tabloid \"Shūkan Post\" publicized Sakakibara's real name and location.\n\n\n"}

Declared dead in 1960, Bader was found alive five years later, as John \"Fritz\" Johnson, a local TV personality living in Omaha, Nebraska. The incident is described by author Jay Robert Nash as \"... one of the most baffling amnesia disappearances on record, a weird story forever unanswered.\"\n\nOn March 15, 1957, Larry Bader, a cookware salesman for the Reynolds Metals Corporation from Akron, Ohio, rented a boat, kissed his wife Mary Lou goodbye, and went to Lake Erie to go fishing. His boat was found the next day, after a storm. The boat had minor damage and a missing oar. Bader, who was $20,000 in debt and in trouble with the IRS, was never found. The couple had three children, with another on the way.\n\nFour days later, John \"Fritz\" Johnson made his first known appearance at Roundtable Bar in Omaha, Nebraska. Johnson immediately attracted attention by sitting on a flagpole for 30 days to raise money for polio. His popularity led to his becoming a bartender, radio announcer, and TV sports director at KETV-7. With his flamboyant personality, he became one of Omaha's most popular personalities.\n\nJohnson lived an equally colorful bachelor lifestyle, driving a hearse equipped with pillows, a bar, and an incense burner, aptly naming it his \"hunting vehicle\". In 1961 Johnson married Nancy Zimmer, a 20-year-old divorcee, and adopted her daughter. Later they had a son together.\n\nIn 1964, it was discovered that Johnson had a cancerous tumor behind his left eye. He lost the eye and wore an eye patch, adding to his flamboyance.\n\nOn February 2, 1965, Johnson, who like Bader was an archery enthusiast, attended a tournament in Chicago. An acquaintance from Akron saw him and, despite the eye patch and mustache, recognized Bader. He then brought Bader's 21-year-old niece, Suzanne Peika, to have a look. Convinced, she asked him, \"Pardon me, but aren't you my Uncle Larry Bader, who disappeared seven years ago?\"\n\nJohnson laughed it off, but Mrs. Peika called in his two brothers from Akron, who had his fingerprints compared with Bader's military records. They matched. Johnson was now faced with the fact that all his memories were false and that he had two wives.\n\nBader's reappearance caused many problems for Mary Lou, his first wife. She had been receiving $254 monthly from Social Security. She also received $39,500 from Bader's life insurance that would have to be paid back. Also, Mary Lou had been dating since her husband's \"death\", and had recently accepted a marriage proposal. With the marriage reinstated, her new marriage was impossible, since she was Catholic. Since Bader's reappearance, his marriage to Nancy was regarded as legally null and void. However, she claimed she would stick by him.\n\nA team of psychiatrists examined Bader for ten days. Their conclusion was that Johnson had no recollection of his former life. There was evidence in his past that he might have wanted to \"start again\". He was from a well-to-do family and never needed money. Later on, he tried various get-rich-quick schemes that failed. He flunked his first semester at the University of Akron because he concentrated more on his hamburger stand than his studies. As an adult, he barely made enough money to maintain the lifestyle he was used to, and got into trouble with the IRS, trying to save money by not paying taxes.\n\nAccording to psychologists, cases of amnesia lasting several years, in which the person filled the missing time with false memories, are rare but not unheard of. Another theory was that the tumor may have been responsible for Bader's apparent memory loss. This was never determined.\n\nThe malignant tumor that cost Bader his eye eventually resurfaced. Bader/Johnson died on September 16, 1966, at St. Joseph's Medical Hospital in Omaha. His death meant that the question of whether he was an amnesiac or a hoaxer was never resolved.\n\n"}
{"id": "505847", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=505847", "title": "Left-handed specialist", "text": "Left-handed specialist\n\nIn baseball, a left-handed specialist (also known as lefty specialist) is a relief pitcher who throws left-handed and specializes in pitching to left-handed batters, weak right-handed batters, and switch-hitters who bat poorly right-handed. Because baseball practices permanent substitution, these pitchers frequently pitch to a very small number of batters in any given game (often only one), and rarely pitch to strictly right-handed batters. Most Major League Baseball (MLB) teams have several left-handed pitchers on their rosters, at least one of whom is a left-handed specialist. A left-handed specialist is sometimes called a \"LOOGY\" (or Lefty One-Out GuY), coined by John Sickels, and may be used pejoratively.\n\nThe pitcher generally has an advantage when his handedness is the same as the batter's, and the batter has an advantage when they are opposite. This is because a right-handed pitcher's curveball breaks to the left, from his own point of view, which causes it to cross the plate with its lateral movement away from a right-handed batter but towards a left-handed batter (and vice versa for a left-handed pitcher), and because batters generally find it easier to hit a ball that is over the plate. Furthermore, since most pitchers are right-handed, left-handed batters generally have less experience with left-handed pitchers. A left-handed pitcher may also be brought in to face a switch-hitter who generally bats left-handed, forcing the batter to shift to his less-effective right-handed stance or to take the disadvantages of batting left-handed against a left-handed pitcher. Research from 2011-2013 has shown that a pinch hitter (usually right-handed) is often used when a left-handed reliever is inserted in the game, thereby reducing or negating the pitcher's platoon split advantage. Only a handful of left-handed relievers face a higher percentage of left-handed batters than right-handed batters over the course of a season.\n\nIn the 1991 MLB season, there were 28 left-handed relievers who were not their team's closer and pitched 45 or more games. Only four averaged fewer than an inning per appearance. From 2001 to 2004, over 75 percent of left handed relievers meeting those criteria averaged less than one inning. Left-handed reliever John Candelaria was one of the early specialists in 1991, pitching 59 games and averaged .571 innings. In 1992, he allowed no earned runs—excluding inherited runners—in 43 of the 50 games. Jesse Orosco became a left-handed specialist later in his 24-season career and retired at the age of 46. From 1991 to 2003, he never averaged more than an inning pitched per appearance.\n\nDuring the 2013 MLB season, there were seven relief pitchers who averaged less than two outs recorded per appearance, all of whom were left-handed. Joe Thatcher, a left-handed specialist, appeared in 72 games with 39.2 innings pitched, and had the fewest outs recorded per appearance with 1.6.\n\nThe right-handed specialist (sometimes called a \"ROOGY\", for Righty One-Out GuY) is less common than the left-handed specialist, but are occasionally featured.\n\n"}

{"id": "19562", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19562", "title": "Mandelbrot set", "text": "Mandelbrot set\n\nThe Mandelbrot set is the set of complex numbers formula_1 for which the function formula_2 does not diverge when iterated from formula_3, i.e., for which the sequence formula_4, formula_5, etc., remains bounded in absolute value.\nIts definition and name are due to Adrien Douady, in tribute to the mathematician Benoit Mandelbrot. The set is connected to a Julia set, and related Julia sets produce similarly complex fractal shapes. \n\nMandelbrot set images may be created by sampling the complex numbers and testing, for each sample point formula_1, whether the sequence formula_7 goes to infinity (in practice -- whether it leaves some predetermined bounded neighborhood of 0 after a predetermined number of iterations). Treating the real and imaginary parts of formula_1 as image coordinates on the complex plane, pixels may then be coloured according to how soon the sequence formula_9 crosses an arbitrarily chosen threshold, with a special color (usually black) used for the values of formula_1 for which the sequence has not crossed the threshold after the predetermined number of iterations (this is necessary to clearly distinguish the Mandelbrot set image from the image of its complement). If formula_1 is held constant and the initial value of formula_12—denoted by formula_13—is variable instead, one obtains the corresponding Julia set for each point formula_1 in the parameter space of the simple function. \n\nImages of the Mandelbrot set exhibit an elaborate and infinitely complicated boundary that reveals progressively ever-finer recursive detail at increasing magnifications. The \"style\" of this repeating detail depends on the region of the set being examined. The set's boundary also incorporates smaller versions of the main shape, so the fractal property of self-similarity applies to the entire set, and not just to its parts.\n\nThe Mandelbrot set has become popular outside mathematics both for its aesthetic appeal and as an example of a complex structure arising from the application of simple rules. It is one of the best-known examples of mathematical visualization and mathematical beauty.\n\nThe Mandelbrot set has its place in complex dynamics, a field first investigated by the French mathematicians Pierre Fatou and Gaston Julia at the beginning of the 20th century. This fractal was first defined and drawn in 1978 by Robert W. Brooks and Peter Matelski as part of a study of Kleinian groups. On 1 March 1980, at IBM's Thomas J. Watson Research Center in Yorktown Heights, New York, Benoit Mandelbrot first saw a visualization of the set.\n\nMandelbrot studied the parameter space of quadratic polynomials in an article that appeared in 1980. The mathematical study of the Mandelbrot set really began with work by the mathematicians Adrien Douady and John H. Hubbard, who established many of its fundamental properties and named the set in honor of Mandelbrot for his influential work in fractal geometry.\n\nThe mathematicians Heinz-Otto Peitgen and Peter Richter became well known for promoting the set with photographs, books, and an internationally touring exhibit of the German Goethe-Institut.\n\nThe cover article of the August 1985 \"Scientific American\" introduced a wide audience to the algorithm for computing the Mandelbrot set. The cover featured an image located at -0.909 + -0.275 and was created by Peitgen, et al. The Mandelbrot set became prominent in the mid-1980s as a computer graphics demo, when personal computers became powerful enough to plot and display the set in high resolution.\n\nThe work of Douady and Hubbard coincided with a huge increase in interest in complex dynamics and abstract mathematics, and the study of the Mandelbrot set has been a centerpiece of this field ever since. An exhaustive list of all who have contributed to the understanding of this set since then is long but would include Mikhail Lyubich, Curt McMullen, John Milnor, Mitsuhiro Shishikura and Jean-Christophe Yoccoz.\n\nThe Mandelbrot set is the set of values of \"c\" in the complex plane for which the orbit of 0 under iteration of the quadratic map\n\nremains bounded. That is, a complex number \"c\" is part of the Mandelbrot set if, when starting with \"z\" = 0 and applying the iteration repeatedly, the absolute value of \"z\" remains bounded however large \"n\" gets. This can also be represented as\n\nFor example, letting \"c\" = 1 gives the sequence 0, 1, 2, 5, 26, ..., which tends to infinity. As this sequence is unbounded, 1 is not an element of the Mandelbrot set. On the other hand, \"c\" = −1 gives the sequence 0, −1, 0, −1, 0, ..., which is bounded, and so −1 belongs to the Mandelbrot set.\n\nThe Mandelbrot set formula_18 is defined by a family of complex quadratic polynomials\n\ngiven by\n\nwhere formula_1 is a complex parameter. For each formula_1, one considers the behavior of the sequence\n\nobtained by iterating formula_24 starting at critical point formula_25, which either escapes to infinity or stays within a disk of some finite radius. The Mandelbrot set is defined as the set of all points formula_1 such that the above sequence does \"not\" escape to infinity.\nMore formally, if formula_27 denotes the \"n\"th iterate of formula_24 (i.e. formula_24 composed with itself \"n\" times), the Mandelbrot set is the subset of the complex plane given by\n\nAs explained below, it is in fact possible to simplify this definition by taking formula_31.\n\nMathematically, the Mandelbrot set is just a set of complex numbers. A given complex number \"c\" either belongs to \"M\" or it does not. A picture of the Mandelbrot set can be made by coloring all the points formula_1 that belong to \"M\" black, and all other points white. The more colorful pictures usually seen are generated by coloring points not in the set according to which term in the sequence formula_33 is the first term with an absolute value greater than a certain cutoff value, usually 2. The list of colors used are always predefined by the program used or created by the user, the next color in the list is chosen when the iteration count rises. See the section on computer drawings below for more details.\n\nThe Mandelbrot set can also be defined as the connectedness locus of the family of polynomials formula_24. That is, it is the subset of the complex plane consisting of those parameters formula_1 for which the Julia set of formula_36 is connected.\n\nformula_37 is a polynomial in c and its leading terms settle down as n grows large enough. These terms are given by the Catalan numbers. The polynomials formula_37 are bounded by the generating function for the Catalan numbers and tend to it as n goes to infinity.\n\nThe Mandelbrot set is a compact set, since it is closed and contained in the closed disk of radius 2 around the origin. More specifically, a point formula_1 belongs to the Mandelbrot set if and only if\n\nIn other words, if the absolute value of formula_37 ever becomes larger than 2, the sequence will escape to infinity in a short amount of time.\nThe intersection of formula_18 with the real axis is precisely the interval [−2, 1/4]. The parameters along this interval can be put in one-to-one correspondence with those of the real logistic family,\nThe correspondence is given by\n\nIn fact, this gives a correspondence between the entire parameter space of the logistic family and that of the Mandelbrot set.\n\nDouady and Hubbard have shown that the Mandelbrot set is connected. In fact, they constructed an explicit conformal isomorphism between the complement of the Mandelbrot set and the complement of the closed unit disk. Mandelbrot had originally conjectured that the Mandelbrot set is disconnected. This conjecture was based on computer pictures generated by programs that are unable to detect the thin filaments connecting different parts of formula_18. Upon further experiments, he revised his conjecture, deciding that formula_18 should be connected. There also exists a topological proof to the connectedness that was discovered in 2001 by Jeremy Kahn.\n\nThe dynamical formula for the uniformisation of the complement of the Mandelbrot set, arising from Douady and Hubbard's proof of the connectedness of formula_18, gives rise to external rays of the Mandelbrot set. These rays can be used to study the Mandelbrot set in combinatorial terms and form the backbone of the Yoccoz parapuzzle.\n\nThe boundary of the Mandelbrot set is exactly the bifurcation locus of the quadratic family; that is, the set of parameters formula_1 for which the dynamics changes abruptly under small changes of formula_50 It can be constructed as the limit set of a sequence of plane algebraic curves, the \"Mandelbrot curves\", of the general type known as polynomial lemniscates. The Mandelbrot curves are defined by setting \"p\" = \"z\", \"p\" = \"p\" + \"z\", and then interpreting the set of points |\"p\"(\"z\")| = 2 in the complex plane as a curve in the real Cartesian plane of degree 2 in \"x\" and \"y\". These algebraic curves appear in images of the Mandelbrot set computed using the \"escape time algorithm\" mentioned below.\n\nUpon looking at a picture of the Mandelbrot set, one immediately notices the large cardioid-shaped region in the center. This \"main cardioid\"\nis the region of parameters formula_1 for which formula_36 has an attracting fixed point. It consists of all parameters of the form\nfor some formula_54 in the open unit disk.\n\nTo the left of the main cardioid, attached to it at the point formula_55, a circular-shaped bulb is visible. This bulb consists of those parameters formula_1 for which formula_36 has an attracting cycle of period 2. This set of parameters is an actual circle, namely that of radius 1/4 around −1.\n\nThere are infinitely many other bulbs tangent to the main cardioid: for every rational number formula_58, with \"p\" and \"q\" coprime, there is such a bulb that is tangent at the parameter\n\nThis bulb is called the \"formula_58-bulb\" of the Mandelbrot set. It consists of parameters that have an attracting cycle of period formula_61 and combinatorial rotation number formula_58. More precisely, the formula_61 periodic Fatou components containing the attracting cycle all touch at a common point (commonly called the \"formula_64-fixed point\"). If we label these components formula_65 in counterclockwise orientation, then formula_36 maps the component formula_67 to the component formula_68.\n\nThe change of behavior occurring at formula_69 is known as a bifurcation: the attracting fixed point \"collides\" with a repelling period \"q\"-cycle. As we pass through the bifurcation parameter into the formula_58-bulb, the attracting fixed point turns into a repelling fixed point (the formula_64-fixed point), and the period \"q\"-cycle becomes attracting.\nAll the bulbs we encountered in the previous section were interior components of\nthe Mandelbrot set in which the maps formula_36 have an attracting periodic cycle. Such components are called \"hyperbolic components\".\n\nIt is conjectured that these are the \"only\" interior regions of formula_18. This problem, known as \"density of hyperbolicity\", may be the most important open problem in the field of complex dynamics. Hypothetical non-hyperbolic components of the Mandelbrot set are often referred to as \"queer\" or ghost components.\nFor \"real\" quadratic polynomials, this question was answered positively in the 1990s independently by Lyubich and by Graczyk and Świątek. (Note that hyperbolic components intersecting the real axis correspond exactly to periodic windows in the Feigenbaum diagram. So this result states that such windows exist near every parameter in the diagram.)\n\nNot every hyperbolic component can be reached by a sequence of direct bifurcations from the main cardioid of the Mandelbrot set. However, such a component \"can\" be reached by a sequence of direct bifurcations from the main cardioid of a little Mandelbrot copy (see below).\n\nEach of the hyperbolic components has a \"center\", which is a point \"c\" such that the inner Fatou domain for formula_24 has a super-attracting cycle – that is, that the attraction is infinite (see the image ). This means that the cycle contains the critical point 0, so that 0 is iterated back to itself after some iterations. We therefore have that formula_36formula_76 for some \"n\". If we call this polynomial formula_77 (letting it depend on \"c\" instead of \"z\"), we have that formula_78 and that the degree of formula_77 is formula_80. We can therefore construct the centers of the hyperbolic components by successively solving the equations formula_81. The number of new centers produced in each step is given by Sloane's .\n\nIt is conjectured that the Mandelbrot set is locally connected. This famous conjecture is known as \"MLC\" (for \"Mandelbrot locally connected\"). By the work of Adrien Douady and John H. Hubbard, this conjecture would result in a simple abstract \"pinched disk\" model of the Mandelbrot set. In particular, it would imply the important \"hyperbolicity conjecture\" mentioned above.\n\nThe work of Jean-Christophe Yoccoz established local connectivity of the Mandelbrot set at all finitely renormalizable parameters; that is, roughly speaking those contained only in finitely many small Mandelbrot copies. Since then, local connectivity has been proved at many other points of formula_18, but the full conjecture is still open.\n\n The Mandelbrot set is self-similar under magnification in the neighborhoods of the Misiurewicz points. It is also conjectured to be self-similar around generalized Feigenbaum points (e.g., −1.401155 or −0.1528 + 1.0397\"i\"), in the sense of converging to a limit set.\nThe Mandelbrot set in general is not strictly self-similar but it is quasi-self-similar, as small slightly different versions of itself can be found at arbitrarily small scales.\n\nThe little copies of the Mandelbrot set are all slightly different, mostly because of the thin threads connecting them to the main body of the set.\n\nThe Hausdorff dimension of the boundary of the Mandelbrot set equals 2 as determined by a result of Mitsuhiro Shishikura. It is not known whether the boundary of the Mandelbrot set has positive planar Lebesgue measure.\n\nIn the Blum-Shub-Smale model of real computation, the Mandelbrot set is not computable, but its complement is computably enumerable. However, many simple objects (\"e.g.\", the graph of exponentiation) are also not computable in the BSS model. At present, it is unknown whether the Mandelbrot set is computable in models of real computation based on computable analysis, which correspond more closely to the intuitive notion of \"plotting the set by a computer\". Hertling has shown that the Mandelbrot set is computable in this model if the hyperbolicity conjecture is true.\n\nAs a consequence of the definition of the Mandelbrot set, there is a close correspondence between the geometry of the Mandelbrot set at a given point and the structure of the corresponding Julia set. For instance, a point is in the Mandelbrot set exactly when the corresponding Julia set is connected.\n\nThis principle is exploited in virtually all deep results on the Mandelbrot set. For example, Shishikura proved that, for a dense set of parameters in the boundary of the Mandelbrot set, the Julia set has Hausdorff dimension two, and then transfers this information to the parameter plane. Similarly, Yoccoz first proved the local connectivity of Julia sets, before establishing it for the Mandelbrot set at the corresponding parameters. Adrien Douady phrases this principle as:\n\nFor every rational number formula_58, where \"p\" and \"q\" are relatively prime, a hyperbolic component of period \"q\" bifurcates from the main cardioid. The part of the Mandelbrot set connected to the main cardioid at this bifurcation point is called the \"p\"/\"q\"-limb. Computer experiments suggest that the diameter of the limb tends to zero like formula_84. The best current estimate known is the \"Yoccoz-inequality\", which states that the size tends to zero like formula_85.\n\nA period-\"q\" limb will have \"q\" − 1 \"antennae\" at the top of its limb. We can thus determine the period of a given bulb by counting these antennas.\n\nIn an attempt to demonstrate that the thickness of the \"p\"/\"q\"-limb is zero, David Boll carried out a computer experiment in 1991, where he computed the number of iterations required for the series to diverge for z = formula_86 (formula_87 being the location thereof). As the series doesn't diverge for the exact value of z = formula_87, the number of iterations required increases with a small ε. It turns out that multiplying the value of ε with the number of iterations required yields an approximation of π that becomes better for smaller ε. For example, for ε = 0.0000001 the number of iterations is 31415928 and the product is 3.1415928.\n\nThe Fibonacci sequence is a sequence such that every number in the sequence is the sum of the two previous numbers and can be found in the Mandelbrot Set. Starting with the period one cardioid and the period two bulb, the sequence of bulb periods where each successive bulb is the largest bulb attached to the cardioid between the previous two bulbs follows the Fibonacci sequence. For instance, the period three bulb is the next largest bulb after the period two bulb, the period five bulb is the largest between the period two and period three bulbs, and the period eight bulb is the largest between the period three and period five bulbs. These correspond with the numbers of the Fibonacci sequence beginning with 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, and so on.\n\nThe Mandelbrot set shows more intricate detail the closer one looks or magnifies the image, usually called \"zooming in\". The following example of an image sequence zooming to a selected \"c\" value gives an impression of the infinite richness of different geometrical structures and explains some of their typical rules.\n\nThe magnification of the last image relative to the first one is about 10 to 1. Relating to an ordinary monitor, it represents a section of a Mandelbrot set with a diameter of 4 million kilometers. Its border would show an astronomical number of different fractal structures.\n\nThe seahorse \"body\" is composed by 25 \"spokes\" consisting of two groups of 12 \"spokes\" each and one \"spoke\" connecting to the main cardioid. These two groups can be attributed by some kind of metamorphosis to the two \"fingers\" of the \"upper hand\" of the Mandelbrot set; therefore, the number of \"spokes\" increases from one \"seahorse\" to the next by 2; the \"hub\" is a so-called Misiurewicz point. Between the \"upper part of the body\" and the \"tail\" a distorted small copy of the Mandelbrot set called satellite may be recognized.\nThe islands above seem to consist of infinitely many parts like Cantor sets, as is actually the case for the corresponding Julia set \"J\". However, they are connected by tiny structures, so that the whole represents a simply connected set. The tiny structures meet each other at a satellite in the center that is too small to be recognized at this magnification. The value of \"c\" for the corresponding \"J\" is not that of the image center but, relative to the main body of the Mandelbrot set, has the same position as the center of this image relative to the satellite shown in the 6th zoom step.\n\nMultibrot sets are bounded sets found in the complex plane for members of the general monic univariate polynomial family of recursions\n\nFor an integer d, these sets are connectedness loci for the Julia sets built from the same formula. The full cubic connectedness locus has also been studied; here one considers the two-parameter recursion formula_90, whose two critical points are the complex square roots of the parameter \"k\". A parameter is in the cubic connectedness locus if both critical points are stable. For general families of holomorphic functions, the \"boundary\" of the Mandelbrot set generalizes to the bifurcation locus, which is a natural object to study even when the connectedness locus is not useful. is\n\nThe Multibrot set is obtained by varying the value of the exponent \"d\". The article has a video that shows the development from \"d\" = 0 to 7, at which point there are 6 i.e. (\"d\" − 1) lobes around the perimeter. A similar development with negative exponents results in (1 − \"d\") clefts on the inside of a ring.\n\nAlthough there is no accepted extension of the set into 3D, the use of quaternions allows for an extension into 4 dimensions. \n\nOf particular interest is the\ntricorn fractal, the connectedness locus of the anti-holomorphic family\n\nThe tricorn (also sometimes called the \"Mandelbar set\" [most likely due to the difference between the Tricorn and Mandelbrot set is a Bar over the right hand Z]) was encountered by Milnor in his study of parameter slices of real cubic polynomials. It is \"not\" locally connected. This property is inherited by the connectedness locus of real cubic polynomials.\n\nAnother non-analytic generalization is the Burning Ship fractal, which is obtained by iterating the following :\n\nThere are many programs used to generate the Mandelbrot set and other fractals, some of which are described in fractal-generating software. These programs use a variety of algorithms to determine the color of individual pixels and achieve efficient computation.\n\nThe simplest algorithm for generating a representation of the Mandelbrot set is known as the \"escape time\" algorithm. A repeating calculation is performed for each \"x\", \"y\" point in the plot area and based on the behavior of that calculation, a color is chosen for that pixel.\n\nThe \"x\" and \"y\" locations of each point are used as starting values in a repeating, or iterating calculation (described in detail below). The result of each iteration is used as the starting values for the next. The values are checked during each iteration to see whether they have reached a critical \"escape\" condition, or \"bailout\". If that condition is reached, the calculation is stopped, the pixel is drawn, and the next \"x\", \"y\" point is examined. For some starting values, escape occurs quickly, after only a small number of iterations. For starting values very close to but not in the set, it may take hundreds or thousands of iterations to escape. For values within the Mandelbrot set, escape will never occur. The programmer or user must choose how much iteration, or \"depth\", they wish to examine. The higher the maximal number of iterations, the more detail and subtlety emerge in the final image, but the longer time it will take to calculate the fractal image.\n\nEscape conditions can be simple or complex. Because no complex number with a real or imaginary part greater than 2 can be part of the set, a common bailout is to escape when either coefficient exceeds 2. A more computationally complex method that detects escapes sooner, is to compute distance from the origin using the Pythagorean theorem, i.e., to determine the absolute value, or \"modulus\", of the complex number. If this value exceeds 2, or equivalently, when the sum of the squares of the real and imaginary parts exceed 4, the point has reached escape. More computationally intensive rendering variations include the Buddhabrot method, which finds escaping points and plots their iterated coordinates.\n\nThe color of each point represents how quickly the values reached the escape point. Often black is used to show values that fail to escape before the iteration limit, and gradually brighter colors are used for points that escape. This gives a visual representation of how many cycles were required before reaching the escape condition.\n\nTo render such an image, the region of the complex plane we are considering is subdivided into a certain number of pixels. To color any such pixel, let formula_1 be the midpoint of that pixel. We now iterate the critical point 0 under formula_36, checking at each step whether the orbit point has modulus larger than 2. When this is the case, we know that formula_1 does not belong to the Mandelbrot set, and we color our pixel according to the number of iterations used to find out. Otherwise, we keep iterating up to a fixed number of steps, after which we decide that our parameter is \"probably\" in the Mandelbrot set, or at least very close to it, and color the pixel black.\n\nIn pseudocode, this algorithm would look as follows. The algorithm does not use complex numbers and manually simulates complex-number operations using two real numbers, for those who do not have a complex data type. The program may be simplified if the programming language includes complex-data-type operations.\n\nHere, relating the pseudocode to formula_1, formula_12 and formula_36:\nand so, as can be seen in the pseudocode in the computation of \"x\" and \"y\":\n\nTo get colorful images of the set, the assignment of a color to each value of the number of executed iterations can be made using one of a variety of functions (linear, exponential, etc.). One practical way, without slowing down calculations, is to use the number of executed iterations as an entry to a look-up color palette table initialized at startup. If the color table has, for instance, 500 entries, then the color selection is \"n\" mod 500, where \"n\" is the number of iterations.\n\nA more complex coloring method involves using a histogram, which keeps track of how many pixels reached each iteration number, from 1 to \"n\". This method will equally distribute colors to the same overall area, and, importantly, is independent of the maximal number of iterations chosen.\n\nFirst, create an array of size \"n\". For each pixel, which took \"i\" iterations, find the \"i\"th element and increment it. This creates the histogram during computation of the image. Then, when finished, perform a second \"rendering\" pass over each pixel, utilizing the completed histogram. If you had a continuous color palette ranging from 0 to 1, you could find the normalized color of each pixel as follows, using the variables from above.\nThis method may be combined with the smooth coloring method below for more aesthetically pleasing images.\n\nThe escape time algorithm is popular for its simplicity. However, it creates bands of color, which, as a type of aliasing, can detract from an image's aesthetic value. This can be improved using an algorithm known as \"normalized iteration count\", which provides a smooth transition of colors between iterations. The algorithm associates a real number formula_104 with each value of \"z\" by using the connection of the iteration number with the potential function. This function is given by\n\nwhere \"z\" is the value after \"n\" iterations and \"P\" is the power for which \"z\" is raised to in the Mandelbrot set equation (\"z\" = \"z\" + \"c\", \"P\" is generally 2).\n\nIf we choose a large bailout radius \"N\" (e.g., 10), we have that\n\nfor some real number formula_107, and this is\n\nand as \"n\" is the first iteration number such that |\"z\"| > \"N\", the number we subtract from \"n\" is in the interval <nowiki>[0, 1)</nowiki>.\n\nFor the coloring we must have a cyclic scale of colors (constructed mathematically, for instance) and containing \"H\" colors numbered from 0 to \"H\" − 1 (\"H\" = 500, for instance). We multiply the real number formula_107 by a fixed real number determining the density of the colors in the picture, take the integral part of this number modulo \"H\", and use it to look up the corresponding color in the color table.\n\nFor example, modifying the above pseudocode and also using the concept of linear interpolation would yield\nOne can compute the distance from point \"c\" (in exterior or interior) to nearest point on the boundary of the Mandelbrot set.\n\nThe proof of the connectedness of the Mandelbrot set in fact gives a formula for the uniformizing map of the complement of formula_18 (and the derivative of this map). By the Koebe quarter theorem, one can then estimate the distance between the midpoint of our pixel and the Mandelbrot set up to a factor of 4.\n\nIn other words, provided that the maximal number of iterations is sufficiently high, one obtains a picture of the Mandelbrot set with the following properties:\n\nThe distance estimate \"b\" of a pixel \"c\" (a complex number) from the Mandelbrot set is given by\n\nwhere \n\nThe idea behind this formula is simple: When the equipotential lines for the potential function formula_123 lie close, the number formula_124 is large, and conversely, therefore the equipotential lines for the function formula_125 should lie approximately regularly.\n\nFrom a mathematician's point of view, this formula only works in limit where \"n\" goes to infinity, but very reasonable estimates can be found with just a few additional iterations after the main loop exits.\n\nOnce \"b\" is found, by the Koebe 1/4-theorem, we know that there is no point of the Mandelbrot set with distance from \"c\" smaller than \"b/4\".\n\nThe distance estimation can be used for drawing of the boundary of the Mandelbrot set, see the article Julia set.\n\nIt is also possible to estimate the distance of a limitly periodic (i.e., inner) point to the boundary of the Mandelbrot set. The estimate is given by\n\nwhere\n\nAnalogous to the exterior case, once \"b\" is found, we know that all points within the distance of \"b\"/4 from \"c\" are inside the Mandelbrot set.\n\nThere are two practical problems with the interior distance estimate: first, we need to find formula_13 precisely, and second, we need to find formula_127 precisely.\nThe problem with formula_13 is that the convergence to formula_13 by iterating formula_24 requires, theoretically, an infinite number of operations.\nThe problem with any given formula_127 is that, sometimes, due to rounding errors, a period is falsely identified to be an integer multiple of the real period (e.g., a period of 86 is detected, while the real period is only 43=86/2). In such case, the distance is overestimated, i.e., the reported radius could contain points outside the Mandelbrot set.\n\nOne way to improve calculations is to find out beforehand whether the given point lies within the cardioid or in the period-2 bulb. Before passing the complex value through the escape time algorithm, first check that:\n\nwhere \"x\" represents the real value of the point and \"y\" the imaginary value. The first two equations determine that the point is within the cardioid, the last the period-2 bulb.\n\nThe cardioid test can equivalently be performed without the square root:\n\n3rd- and higher-order buds do not have equivalent tests, because they are not perfectly circular. However, it is possible to find whether the points are within circles inscribed within these higher-order bulbs, preventing many, though not all, of the points in the bulb from being iterated.\n\nTo prevent having to do huge numbers of iterations for points in the set, one can perform periodicity checking. Check whether a point reached in iterating a pixel has been reached before. If so, the pixel cannot diverge and must be in the set.\n\nPeriodicity checking is, of course, a trade-off. The need to remember points costs memory and \"data management\" instructions, whereas it saves \"computational\" instructions.\n\nHowever, checking against only one previous iteration can detect many periods with little performance overhead. For example, within the while loop of the pseudocode above, make the following modifications.\n\nIt can be shown that if a solid shape can be drawn on the Mandelbrot set, with all the border colors being the same, then the shape can be filled in with that color. This is a result of the Mandelbrot set being simply connected. Boundary tracing works by following the lemniscates of the various iteration levels (colored bands) all around the set, and then filling the entire band at once. This can be a good speed increase, because it means that large numbers of points can be skipped.\n\nA similar method operating on the same principle uses rectangles instead of arbitrary border shapes. It is usually faster than boundary tracing because it requires fewer calculations to work out the rectangle. It is inefficient, however, because boundaries are not rectangular, and so some areas can be missed. This issue can be minimized by creating a recursive algorithm that, if a rectangle border fails, will subdivide it into four smaller rectangles and test those, and either fill each or subdivide again and repeat the process.\n\nHowever, this only works using discrete colors in the escape time algorithm. It will not work for smooth/continuous coloring.\n\nSimply put, rendering less than 100 percent of the image is required if the real axis is present in the image due to the symmetry of the set along the real axis, therefore the programmer would have to simply mirror the pixel color and placement as the image is rendered. \n\nSimple programs and scripts generally tend to set the escape, or bailout value to two. In doing so, the borders for the color bands are not smooth. The rendering process and colorization method can be improved by utilizing the distance from the origin and the point being rendered with the Pythagorean theorem by summing the squares of the real and imaginary portions of formula_12 and then escaping if the value is larger or equal to four. The result of this optimization are smoother borders of the color bands, which leads to the images showing a resemblance to most others. Plus, of course, the rendering process of said image is faster.\n\nVery highly magnified images require more than the standard 64–128 or so bits of precision that most hardware floating-point units provide, requiring renderers to use slow \"bignum\" or \"arbitrary-precision\" math libraries to calculate. However, this can be sped up by the exploitation of perturbation theory. Given\n\nas the iteration, and a small epsilon and delta, it is the case that\n\nor\n\nso if one defines\n\none can calculate a single point (e.g. the center of an image) using high-precision arithmetic (\"z\"), giving a \"reference orbit\", and then compute many points around it in terms of various initial offsets delta plus the above iteration for epsilon, where epsilon-zero is set to 0. For most iterations, epsilon does not need more than 16 significant figures, and consequently hardware floating-point may be used to get a mostly accurate image. There will often be some areas where the orbits of points diverge enough from the reference orbit that extra precision is needed on those points, or else additional local high-precision-calculated reference orbits are needed. By measuring the orbit distance between the reference point and the point calculated with low precision, it can be detected that it is not possible to calculate the point correctly, and the calculation can be stopped. These incorrect points can later be re-calculated e.g. from another closer reference point.\n\nFurther, it is possible to approximate the starting values for the low-precision points with a truncated Taylor series, which often enables a significant amount of iterations to be skipped.\nRenderers implementing these techniques are publicly available and offer speedups for highly magnified images by around two orders of magnitude.\n\nAn alternate explanation of the above: \n\nFor the central point in the disc formula_163 and its iterations formula_164, and an arbitrary point in the disc formula_165 and its iterations formula_166, it is possible to define the following iterative relationship:\n\nWith formula_168. Successive iterations of formula_169 can be found using the following:\n\nNow from the original definition:\n\nIt follows that:\n\nAs the iterative relationship relates an arbitrary point to the central point by a very small change formula_176, then most of the iterations of formula_169 are also small and can be calculated using floating point hardware.\n\nHowever, for every arbitrary point in the disc it is possible to calculate a value for a given formula_178 without having to iterate through the sequence from formula_179, by expressing formula_169 as a power series of formula_176.\n\nWith formula_183.\n\nNow given the iteration equation of formula_184, it is possible to calculate the coefficients of the power series for each formula_169:\n\nTherefore it follows that:\n\nThe cooefficents in the power series can be calculated as iterative series using only values from the central point's iterations formula_193, and do not change for any arbitrary point in the disc. If formula_176 is very small, formula_169 should be calculable to sufficient accuracy using only a few terms of the power series. As the Mandlebrot Escape Contours are 'continuous' over the complex plane, if a points escape time has been calculated, then the escape time of that points neighbours should be similar. Interpolation of the neighbouring points should provide a good estimation of where to start in the formula_169 series. \n\nFurther, separate interpolation of both real axis points and imaginary axis points should provide both an upper and lower bound for the point being calculated. If both results are the same (i.e. both escape or dot not escape) then the difference formula_197 can be used to recuse until both an upper and lower bound can be established. If floating point hardware can be used to iterate the formula_184 series, then there exists a relation between how many iterations can be achieved in the time it takes to use BigNum software to compute a given formula_169. If the difference between the bounds is greater than the number of iterations, it is possible to perform binomial search using BigNum software, successively halving the gap until it becomes more time efficient to find the escape value using floating point hardware.\n\n\n\n\n"}

She was killed in the sinking of the RMS \"Lusitania\", and she is commemorated in Belgium alongside the British nurse Edith Cavell\n\nShe was born Marie Pauline Picard, in Ixelles near Brussels in Belgium, one of two daughters and two sons of the engineer Désiré Émile Picard and Julie Marie Victorine Héger. She was a niece of Professor Paul Héger and granddaughter of Constantin Héger.\n\nShe married a Belgian doctor Antoine Depage on 8 August 1893. They had three sons.\n\nHer husband was a surgeon to the Belgian King Albert, and chairman of the Belgian Red Cross. He was also a founder of the International Society of Surgery (Societe internationale de chirurgie) in 1902. Depage showed talent in drawing and painting; after studying human anatomy, she drew illustrations of her husband's surgical work.\n\nConcerned at the antiquated nursing practice in Belgian hospitals run by nuns, Antoine Depage founded a laicised non-denominational medical institute in 1907, the Berkendael Medical Institute (also known as \"L'École Belge d’Infirmières Diplômées\"), in Uccle near Brussels, with Edith Cavell as head nurse. Marie Depage took on the administrative work. The couple were also involved in the introduction of Baden-Powell's scouting movement into Belgium in 1909-10, and Marie translated and published several of Baden-Powell's books.\n\nWith her husband and eldest son Pierre, also a surgeon, Depage organised sending four Belgian ambulances to the Balkans during the First Balkan War in 1912-13, accompanying the ambulance sent to a hospital in Constantinople.\n\nAfter the outbreak of the First World War in 1914, Depage volunteered at the Red Cross hospital established at the Royal Palace in Brussels, and then helped her husband to covert the \"Grand Hôtel de l'Océan\" at De Panne (also known in French as La Panne) into a Red Cross hospital for military casualties (see ), and organised surgical units to treat wounded soldiers of the Belgian Army near the Yser Front.\n\nDepage travelled to the US in January 1915 to raise funds for the \"L'Océan\" hospital.

{"id": "4209781", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4209781", "title": "Multi-level governance", "text": "Multi-level governance\n\nMulti-level (or multilevel) governance is an approach in political science and public administration theory that originated from studies on European integration. Political scientists Liesbet Hooghe and Gary Marks developed the concept of multi-level governance in the early 1990s and have continuously been contributing to the research program in a series of articles (see Bibliography). Their theory resulted from the study of the new structures that were put in place by the EU (Maastricht Treaty) in 1992. Multi-level governance gives expression to the idea that there are many interacting authority structures at work in the emergent global political economy. It \"illuminates the intimate entanglement between the domestic and international levels of authority\".\n\n'Multi-level governance' is a recent concept, having first entered the lexicon of political science around fifteen years ago as comparativists became re-acquainted with European integration and discovered that authority was shifting not only from central states up to Europe, but also down to subnational authorities. The first efforts to understand this were descriptive, spawning concepts that have generated an extensive literature. Multi-level, polycentric, and multi-layered governance emphasize the dispersion of decision making from the local to the global level. In recent years these concepts have cross-pollinated subfields of political science including European studies and decentralization, federalism and international organization, public policy (e.g. environmental policy, health policy) and public-private governance, local governance and transnational governance.\n\nThe authors of a recent survey of the literature on the structure of government conclude that ‘We attribute many of the recent “cutting-edge” theoretical contributions in political science to studies of “multi-level governance”’ and they note that although students of federalism ‘considered the current subject matter of their field to be based on well-defined, well rooted and broadly accepted ideas, they were nevertheless open to a new flowering of federal theory as a result of fertilization by these new MLG theoretical developments’. However, there is nothing entirely new under the sun. Though scarcely recognized at the time, this research revives a rich tradition in political science represented by Karl Deutsch (1966) on the effect of societal transactions on government structure, Robert Dahl (1973) on the virtues and vices of multilevel democracy, and Stein Rokkan (1983) on identity and territorial politics.\n\nThe study of the European Union has been characterized by two different theoretical phases. The first phase was dominated by studies from the field of international relations; in the second phase these studies were revised and insights from among others, public policy were added. The most straightforward way of understanding this theoretical shift is to see it as a move away from treating the EU as an international organisation similar to others (e.g. NATO) to seeing it as something unique among international organisations. The uniqueness of the EU relates both to the nature and to the extent of its development. This means that in some areas of activity the EU displays more properties related to national political systems than to those of international organisations.\n\nThe theory of multi-level governance belongs to the second phase. Multi-level governance characterizes the changing relationships between actors situated at different territorial levels, both from the public and the private sectors. The multi-level governance theory crosses the traditionally separate domains of domestic and international politics and highlights the increasingly fading distinction between these domains in the context of European integration. \nMulti-level governance was first developed from a study of EU policy and then applied to EU decision-making more generally. An early explanation referred to multi-level governance as \"a system of continuous negotiation among nested governments at several territorial tiers\" and described how \"supranational, national, regional, and local governments are enmeshed in territorially overarching policy networks\". The theory emphasized both the increasingly frequent and complex interactions between governmental actors and the increasingly important dimension of non-state actors that are mobilized in cohesion policy-making and in the EU policy more generally. As such, multi-level governance raised new and important questions about the role, power and authority of states.\n\nNo other international form of cooperation is characterized by such far-reaching integration as the European Union. This becomes evident by the number and scope of policy areas covered by the European Union and the way policy is developed. The European Union can be characterised by a mix of classic intergovernmental cooperation between sovereign states and far-reaching supranational integration.\n\nMulti-level governance within the EU is understood as respecting competences, sharing responsibilities and cooperating between the various levels of governance: the EU, the Member States and the regional and local authorities. In this context, it refers to the principle of subsidiarity, which places decisions as close as possible to the citizens and ensures that that action at Union level is justified in light of the possibilities available at national, regional or local level. In practice Multilevel Governance within the EU is about participation and coordination between all levels of government both in the decision making process and in the implementation or evaluation of European policies.\n\nThe combination of communal decision-making with the wide area of policy areas results in a deep entanglement of the member states’ national policy levels with the European policy level. This entanglement is one of the basic principles of the multi-level governance theory. The multi-level governance theory describes the European Union as a political system with interconnected institutions that exist at multiple levels and that have unique policy features. The European Union is a political system with a European layer (European Commission, European Council and European Parliament), a national layer and a regional layer. These layers interact with each other in two ways: first, across different levels of government (vertical dimension) and second, with other relevant actors within the same level (horizontal dimension).\n\nConcerning with the changes of the institutional design of the European Union, the current model governance has been shaped as a setup of constraints upon political margin of discretion, applying the central tenet of ordoliberalism with the aim to use strong rules in order to reduce the discretionary exercise of powers by institutions so as to avoid an arbitrary use of them. This principle has achieved an extreme effect at the European level, that one not to avoid arbitrary use of political powers but to keep political responsibility and participation out of the decision-making process. As Laruffa concludes: \n\"It is quite clear that such a model of governance, which is made only by rules without any role for a democratic policy-making process, imposes a de facto limit to on the political rights of the European citizens. This means that there is a control exercised by rules over the European citizens rather than a control by the European citizens over rules and policies.\"\n\nThe European Union: Multilevel Governance in Practise\n\nWithin the European Union nearly 95,000 local and regional authorities currently have significant powers in key sectors such as education, the environment, economic development, town and country planning, transport, public services and social policies. These local and regional authorities implement nearly 70% of EU legislation. They help ensure the exercise of European democracy and citizenship. Special rights and competences for regions, cities and communities are supposed to enable and preserve diversity of governance at local and regional level. By thinking beyond traditional EU - Member States relations the EU multi-level governance concept further strengthens regional and transnational cooperation. In a broader sense, this concept also includes the participation of non-state players like economic and social partners and civil society in the decision making process of all levels of governance(thus taking up the vertical and horizontal dimensions of multilevel governance).\n\nThe Treaty of Lisbon as an important step towards Multilevel Governance\n\nThe Treaty of Lisbon represents an important step towards institutional recognition of multi-level governance in the way the European Union operates. It strengthens the competences and influence of local and regional authorities in the Community decision-making process giving roles to national (and regional) parliaments and the Committee of the Regions and enshrines the territorial dimension of the European Union, notably territorial cohesion as part of the process of European integration. The Committee of the Regions has established a system to monitor the compliance with the subsidiarity thorough the whole EU policy and law making process.\n\nMultilevel governance within the EU as an ongoing process\n\nNevertheless, multi-level governance within the EU is a dynamic and ongoing process. On 16 June 2009 the Committee of the Regions adopted a White Paper on multi-level governance which recommended specific mechanisms and instruments for stimulating all stages of the European decision-making process. This document, together with the follow-up opinion \"Building a European culture of Multilevel Governance\" affirmed the Committee’s political commitment to Multi-level Governance, proposing a first political project for Building Europe in partnership. As a follow up to the 2009 White paper on Multi-level Governance, the Committee developed a \"Scoreboard on Multi-level Governance\" to monitor on a yearly basis the development of multi-level governance at European Union level.\n\nThe Charter for Multi-level Governance in Europe\n\nOn 3 April 2014 the Committee of the Regions adopted a Charter for Multi-level Governance calling public authorities of all levels of governance to use and promote multi-level governance in their future undertakings. The Charter is open for signature to:\n\n• all European Union local and regional authorities;\n\n• European and national associations of local and regional authorities, as well as local and regional authorities' network are invited to officially commit to multilevel governance principles, giving the Charter their formal support;\n\n• National and European political figures wishing to back up the Charter are also invited to declare their support\n\nThe point of departure for multi-level governance was Europe, but recent books and articles have dealt with the dispersion of authority away from central states in Latin America, Asia, and North America. Decentralization has been at least as marked in Latin America as in Europe over the past two decades, and several Asian countries have decentralized in the past decade. Dispersion of authority above the national state is most evident in the EU, but it is not sui generis. A recent survey counts 32 regional IGOs pooling authority over quite wide areas of policy and which cover all but a handful of states in the world today. The number of governmental and non-governmental international organizations has increased markedly over the past two decades, as has their scope, range and intrusiveness. Crossborder interdependence – from migration to climate change to terrorism – has stimulated regional organization in many parts of the world.\n\nThe \"vertical\" dimension refers to the linkages between higher and lower levels of government, including their institutional, financial, and informational aspects. Here, local capacity building and incentives for effectiveness of sub national levels of government are crucial issues for improving the quality and coherence of public policy.\n\nThe \"horizontal\" dimension refers to co-operation arrangements between regions or between municipalities. These agreements are increasingly common as a means by which to improve the effectiveness of local public service delivery and implementation of development strategies.\n\nThere has been an intensification of research on the consequences as well as the character of multi-level governance. The concept was developed as a tool of pure research, but it now motivates policy makers. From the late 1990s the European Commission began to refer to its own mission as one of achieving multilevel governance, especially in cohesion policy. In 2001, the Commission set up a committee on multilevel governance to contribute to its White Paper on governance. José Manuel Barroso, President of the European Commission, claims that ‘the multilevel system of governance on which our European regional policy is based provides a key boost to the Union's competitive edge’ and that, in the current economic crisis, 'multilevel governance must be a priority'. In an October 2008 resolution, the European Parliament called on the member states ‘to develop as quickly as possible the practical measures set out in the First Action Programme . . . with a view to strengthening multilevel governance’. In 2009, 344 representatives of elected regional and local authorities across the EU approved a resolution on a 'European Union Charter for Multilevel Governance', which would bring localities and regions into European democratic decision making.\n\nThis theme has been taken up by several political parties including the European Peoples Party, representing Christian democratic parties in the European Parliament, which recently stated that ‘multilevel governance should be one of the guiding principles of the EU, an integral part of any European strategy or policy where local and regional authorities are widely implicated, and monitored closely to ensure that it is indeed being put into practice on the ground’.\n\nInternational organizations have also taken positions on the issue. In 2009, the United Nations Development Programme released a report, ‘Delivering Human Security through Multilevel Governance’, which argued that ‘the two-level approach to international relations . . . is being replaced by a much more complex multilevel system of governance that also involves local, sub-national providers of public goods as well as regional governance actors acting at a supranational but not a global level’. The World Bank has commissioned a series of studies examining multilevel governance; the United Nations has a research and training institute on comparative regional integration that studies ‘multilevel regulatory processes and the relations between sub- and supra-national regional governance’, and the OECD has created a directorate on multilevel governance.\n\nHowever, the consequences of multilevel governance are debated. In the eyes of its detractors, multilevel governance exacerbates corruption (Treisman 2000), leads to gridlock (Scharpf 2007), engenders moral hazard (Rodden 2006), constrains redistribution (Obinger, Castles, Leibfried 2005), obfuscates accountability (Peters & Pierre 2004), and wastes money (Berry 2009). Research on both causes and consequences of multi-level governance is ongoing and more and more information about the subnational as well as the international dimension of multi-level governance is available in the context of larger data sets.\n\nGlobal climate change is being contributed to by ever increasing levels of greenhouse gas emissions emanating from decisions and activities of individuals and organisations at local, regional, national and international levels. Cities are suggested to contribute up to 75% of global carbon dioxide emissions, reflecting the increasing proportions of global populations living and working in cities. As we know, tackling climate change is an extensive, time-consuming and costly task, a task that cannot be achieved solely through the policy implementation and regulation from central governments and bodies alone. It has become increasingly clear that nation-states will be unable to commit to and meet international targets and agreements for offsetting climate change without engaging with the activity of sub-national and local action. Hereby, warranting the extreme importance of multi-level governance of climate change within cities.\n\nForms of governance at multi-levels have taken off increasingly at the local scale, building upon the notion of ‘think global, act local’, in cities in particular. Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions stem from certain activities that originate from specific places, bringing about thought that the local scale is the most appropriate political scale to produce necessary offsets in emissions. Cities are exemplary of such specific places in which local governance action can and will help reduce GHG emissions. The levels of governance authority handed down to local governments within cities has been perceived to out-do policy goals within the national and international arena, with some local governments taking on their own initiatives for tackling urban climate change. This sets an important stance to which the local scale of multi-level governance is important for tackling global climate change within the urban arena.\n\nFour distinct modes of governance exist within the dynamics of climate change in cities. Each stems from the local level with the ability of being implemented on multi-scales to mitigate and adapt to urban climate change. Self-governing is the capacity of local governments to govern its own activities such as improving energy efficiency within a designated city, without the burdening pressure to meet targets of increased energy efficiencies set by national governments. A form of self-governing within multi-level systems is horizontal collaboration where cities may collaborate with regions demonstrating multi-levels of governance to tackle urban climate change, imperative to the success of city climate change policy. Governing through enabling is the co-ordination and facilitation of partnerships with private organisations by the local government. National governments also implement this mode of governance to implement policy and action within cities. Governing through provision, a form of vertical collaboration along with governing through enabling, applies itself to the multi-levels of governance. Climate change in cities is tackled here through the shaping of and delivery of services and resources, with additional support aided to local governments from regional and national authorities. Lastly, another form of vertical collaboration, is governing through regulation. Such regulation characterises traditional forms of authoritative governance, exemplifying local to nation-state relations, almost nearly covering the entirety of the multi-level governance scale.\n\nWithin the various initiatives of the Low Emission Development Strategies Global Partnership (LEDS GP), the thematic working group on Subnational Integration (SNI-WG) was created in 2013 to support learning and facilitate collaboration between national and subnational governments for accelerated effective climate actions. The SNI-WG realizes several activities at global and regional levels including organizing panels at multiple regional and global forums, hosting peer-learning discussions, publishing reports and case studies, along with facilitating technical workshops, webinars and providing advisory Remote Expert Assistance on LEDS (REAL) support upon request. This process has generated observations, feedback and insights on the potential of the vertical integration and coordination of subnational climate actions to accelerate and scale-up both local and global emission reductions. Improving coordination and integration between the different levels of authority in a country is critical in determining both national and global capacity to govern climate change. City and subnational governments require support from the national government, and vice versa, in order to design and implement intersectoral policies and actions for domestic decarbonization pathways.\n\nMultilevel governance theory and empirical evidence demonstrate that the coordination and vertical integration of climate actions can:\n\nThe Cities for Climate Protection (CCP) program is one example of multi-level governance of climate change. Roles and responsibilities are shared within different levels of governance, from state actors to non-state actors (Betsill & Bulkeley, 2006). Membership consists of 40 large cities worldwide (Large Cities Climate Leadership Group), with local governments often working in close connection with national governments. However, the CCP can overlook the activity of nation-states giving local governments the opportunity to amend positions of policy implementation and regulation for offsetting urban climate change, which may be of a controversial nature to national governments. Thus illustrating even though climate change in cities can be addressed and governed at local, regional, national and international levels, it does not always follow a hierarchical order.\n\nMany of the problems associated with multi-level governance revolve around the notion of levels. The very idea of levels and levels of analysis is imbued with hierarchical implications. However, different levels or social spaces often interact or cut across with one another in complex ways that are not strictly hierarchical. To what extent can 'levels' be identified at all? The notion that international bodies constitute a discrete level of authority and governance is contestable. International regulatory networks may not be separate sources of authority but instead represent the reconstitution of state authority and the pursuit of state-level governance by other means. While territorial levels make sense when we are referring to public forms of authority, they seem less compatible with private and market forms of authority.\n\nAnother criticism on the theory of multi-level governance is that it's not really a proper theory, rather that it is an approach. The main difference between multi-level governance and other theories of integration is that it gets rid of the continuum or grey area between intergovernmentalism and supranationalism and leaves in its place a descriptive structure. This theory does not address the sovereignty of states directly, but instead simply says that a multi-level structure is being created by subnational and supranational actors. One of the main questions of integration theory, namely, the transfer of loyalty and sovereignty between national and supranational entities and the future of this relationship in the EU is not specifically addressed in this theory.\n\nThe identification of partial political measures and general macroeconomics is divided on diverse decisional levels. National governments maintain an important decisional role but the control unlocalizes at supranational level. Individual national sovereignty is dilated in this decisional process and the supranational institutions have an autonomic role.\n\nThe use of security as a means of instituting ideals of democracy. The shift to a multi-level governance perspective of enforcing the ideals prevents one nation from imposing its personal agenda or perception of what these ideals entail. Additionally, the use of supranational judgement creates a uniformity for the international portrayal and enforcement of democratic principles. The utilization of multi-level security governance allows for a pooling of resources to manage this enforcement, while still allowing States to act autonomously. The supranational level merely acts as a medium for allowing the promotion of mutually beneficial security. With the rise of transnational threats, a method for ensuring international security without the reliance on a single policing nation is required. Multi-level governance provides functional means of dealing with the deficiencies of merely national actors dealing with transnational issues on the international stage.\n\nThe preliminary notion of the European Union was the European Coal and Steel Community. The union was between the nations of France, Belgium, Italy, Netherlands, Luxembourg, and West Germany. Striving for the concept of European peace the nations sought to bind the nations through economic interdependence. Coming about as a reaction to World War II, the ECSC created an economic tie for previously independent nations. It provided the European peace the nations sought, and would evolve into the European Union seen today. It was not a new concept as trade has historically been viewed as a catalyst for peace between nations. Creating multi-level governance is shown to create the necessary ties for fostering economic interdependence to a greater degree than mere trade between nations. The linking of nations through a sharing of capital creates an adhesiveness that deters the escalation of political conflict from reaching a state of war. On the international stage, political conflict leads to war as a result of perception of potential gains being larger than the opportunity costs. Interdependence created by multi-level governance is shown to greatly reduce the probability of war by increasing the opportunity costs. The increase in opportunity cost to war can be viewed from even the economic ties perspective. It is seen by noting that economic ties between participatory nations makes the cost of disruption to the system through the escalation of the political sphere towards war illogical.\n\nMulti-level government has shown to increase efficiency of governance by creating an agreed upon standard for the implementation and execution of policies. To elaborate, the establishment of a supranational institution can be used to set standards for the way cooperating nations run their environmental, industrial, and safety policies. A key factor for multi-level governance is the terms the national actors agree to when forming the supranational institution as they will give certain decision making processes to the higher level, and agree to abide by the outcome. Nations consent to the terms as they face a common issue of international policy that has to deal with collective-action problems making it nonsensical to attend to by themselves. Agreements between nations to form a multi-level government creates an efficiency gain that allows them to all share in the positive benefit.\n\n\n\n"}

He was murdered as a result of exposing illegal mining and land grabbing.\n\nBefore his murder, Kothari told police he had received threats. He was already known to police, since as a result of his controversial reporting, Kothari had a long list of over 19 false accusations on record in various police stations in his home state, including common goat theft and rape. Although he was jailed for over 16 months awaiting trial for rape, none of the cases led to a conviction. Both Kothari’s sister Sandhya and brother Rahul begged him to stop reporting about the sand mafia as it was risking his life.\n\nKothari came from a business family. His father had a small convenience store, known in India as a kirana store. Kothari and his two brothers were forest contractors and shared this family business before his brothers opened an automobile repair shop and Kothari went into journalism at \"Deshbandhu\".\n\nSandeep Kothari was a Hindi-language journalist since 2005. Over his career, he wrote for prominent newspapers, such as \"Nai Duniya\", \"Hari Bhoomi\" (sometimes transliterated as \"Haribhumi\"), and \"Deshbandhu\" around Jabalpur. After 2012, he left \"Nai Duniya\" to freelance. He specialized in investigating illegal chit fund schemes, manganese and sand mining and land grabbing around Katangi and Tirodi, and he became adept at using India's Right to Information (RTI) Act to get information about his subjects. More recently, Kothari had turned to freelance work as journalist and published his own work out of Katangi. The police called him a \"history sheeter\" -- a term used to disparage journalism -- in reference to his recent investigations around Katangi.\n\nSandeep Kothari's murderers first attacked him and his friend, who were on their way to the village of Umri, in the Balaghat district, by ramming their four-wheel motor vehicle into their bike on 19 June 2015. While his friend managed to escape, Kothari was beaten and kidnapped from the site of the wreckage. After the abduction, Kothari's friend was the one who reported to the police that Kothari was missing.\n\nThe men first strangled him, dumped him next to a railroad track and then burned him alive. His autopsy showed he had been alive when he was burned but also lists strangulation as a cause of death.\n\nAfter the murder, the Madhya Pradesh Police appointed a Special Investigation Team to look into the murder. Three arrests have been made after the murder. Taken in to custody were Brijendra Geharwar, Vishal Tandi (both from Katangi), and Rakesh Naraswani. The three suspects are alleged to have been involved with illegal mining and confessed to the murder. They had previously tried to frame Kothari on a charge of rape but were unsuccessful in court. The accused led police to the site where they had left Kothari for dead. Police found his body at Butibori, Nagpur, Maharashtra, which is 50 km from Wardha, Maharashtra.\n\nPolice received complaints that Kothari was a blackmailer, however, his family and colleagues assert that these are just more false accusations like the ones made during his final years.\n\nThere has not yet been a conviction in the case\n\nKothari’s murder was connected to the local sand mining mafia as he was exposing their practices. Sand mining is an illegal process of removing sand and selling it as material to a construction company. Worldwide sand mining is a $70 billion industry. The activity is primarily a local operation that is set up close to construction work. India does not have enough legal sand to fill demand. However, the Indian Planning Commission estimates that sand mining constitutes almost 9 percent of the nation's GDP. While sand mining has a high profit margin for those who run it, it has environmental impacts and is therefore regulated. Sand mining companies, therefore have been known to rely on bribing government and law enforcement to work untouched. The mining mafias in India have been implicated in hundreds of deaths, including government officials, police officers, journalists, and citizens.\n\nSandeep Kothari was targeted by the mining mafia because of his reports to expose the sand mafia and illegal mining activities. However, Kothari was not the only journalist to suffer this fate at the hands of the sand mafia. Weeks before Sandeep's murder, Jagendra Singh, a journalist from Shahjahanpur, Uttar Pradesh, was burned 1 June 2015 and he died from the attack on 8 June. And Haider Khan, a journalist from the same area as Singh, was beaten by the sand mining mafia.\n\nIrina Bokova, director-general of UNESCO, has called for an investigation into the death of Sandeep Kothari and is urging authorities to bring the crime’s perpetrators to trial. \n\nThe International Federation of Journalists (IFJ) said, \"It is critical for the safety and independence of media in India that these incidents be investigated swiftly and transparently and with immediate steps taken to remedy the situation.\"\n\nThe Indian Journalists Union (IJU) and the Press Council of India (PCI) addressed the \"intolerance\" directed at Indian journalists that raises their security risks, and have called on the police departments of India to investigate Kothari’s murder along with the other recent.\n\n\n"}

He was of the Clann Faílbe sept of this branch and a grandson of Tnúthgal mac Donngaile (died 820), whom some sources name as King of Munster and brother of Áilgenán mac Donngaile (died 853), also King of Munster. His branch of the ruling dynasty had their lands in the Cashel area of modern County Tipperary. He reigned from 856 to 859.\n\nAfter the death of Áilgenán in 853 there was an interregnum until the succession of his brother Máel Gualae in 856. The Danes had arrived in Ireland in 849 and took control of Dublin in 851. The dispersed Norse went off to plunder different areas of Ireland and a rivalry began between these two Viking groups with Irish kings using this rivalry in their own conflicts. A number of men in Munster joined up with these Norse and were known as \"Gall Gaedil\" (\"foreign Gaels\"). Cerball mac Dúnlainge (died 888), King of Osraige aligned himself with the Danes versus the Norse to become the most powerful ruler in southern Ireland during this period. \n\nDuring the interregnum, the High King of Ireland Máel Sechnaill mac Máele Ruanaid (died 862) of Clann Cholmáin led an expedition into Munster in 854 as far as the borders of the Déisi in Tipperary County and took hostages from Munster. The \"Fragmentary Annals of Ireland\" claim that Cerball, brother-in-law of the high king, was sent by the high king into Munster as well to claim the hostages. According to the \"Annals of the Four Masters\", the Norse had instigated the opposition to the high king in Munster. The high king appeared again at Cashel to take hostages from Munster in 856, probably at the time of the accession of Máel Gualae. \n\nThe Norse activities in Munster were a disruptive influence and around 855 the men of Munster appealed to Cerball of Osraige for aid against the Norse. Cerball arrived with a force of Danes under a leader named Horm and they surrounded the Norse and massacred them. In 856 a Norse force slew Gormán son of Lonán, heir designate of Cashel, at Loch Cenn. In 857 Cerball and his Danish allies, Amlaíb Conung and Ímar, won a victory over the Norse and Gall Gaeill under Kettil \"The Fair\" in the Munster territory of Arad Tíre in northern Tipperary.\n\nIn 858 Máel Sechnaill led a large muster of the men of Ireland into Munster to exact hostages. This time Cerball was his enemy as well as the Leinstermen had complained to the high king of him. The forces of Cerball and Máel Gualae had been stationed at Belach Gabrán in southern Osraige, possibly at Goresbridge on the River Barrow, to oppose the High King's army, but this took an unexpected route and their forces were divided. The High King inflicted a shattering defeat on the forces of Máel Gualae at the Battle of Carn Lugdoch (near modern Waterford) and the King of the Déisi, Máel Crón mac Muiredaig, was slain. The High King remained at Emly for a month raiding all of Munster as far as the sea in Desmond. He took hostages from all the lands of Munster. Many of the Norse-Gaels were slain by the High King's army. The defeat of the Munstermen led Cerball to also submit and give hostages to the high king. \n\nThe next year however in 859 Cerball again defied Máel Sechnaill and with his Danish allies led an expedition into Mide. This led to a royal conference at Ráith Aeda Meic Bric (modern Rahugh, County Westmeath) with the High King, the kingdom of Cerball was made directly subject to the high king and separated from Munster. Máel Gualae accepted this transfer of authority. That same year Máel Gualae was captured by the Norsemen who stoned him to death\n\nHis son Dub Lachtna mac Máele Gualae (died 895) was also a King of Munster.\n\n"}

He was successful at the European Tour qualifying school at his first attempt in 1998 and played regularly on the European Tour from 1999 through 2007. He has not won on the European Tour, but had two second-place finishes in 2003, two more in 2004 and one each in 2005, 2006 and 2007.\n\nIn 2005, O'Hern began to play quite regularly in the United States. He was not a member of the PGA Tour, but having reached the top twenty of the Official World Golf Rankings, he received a substantial number of invitations and sponsors exemptions for PGA Tour events. In 2006 he became a member of the PGA Tour on the basis of his membership of the International Team at the 2005 Presidents Cup, and has since played mostly on that tour.\n\nAlso in 2006, O'Hern won the Australian PGA Championship, after he holed out from the greenside bunker for birdie on the fourth hole of a two-man play-off with Peter Lonard. The win brought to an end a seven-year drought for O'Hern, and propelled him to the top of the PGA Tour of Australasia's Order of Merit for 2006.

{"id": "19777897", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19777897", "title": "Nonviolent video game", "text": "Nonviolent video game\n\nNonviolent video games are video games characterized by little or no violence. As the term is vague, game designers, developers, and marketers that describe themselves as non-violent video game makers, as well as certain reviewers and members of the non-violent gaming community, often employ it to describe games with \"comparatively\" little or no violence. The definition has been applied flexibly to games in such purposive genres as the Christian video game. However, a number of games at the fringe of the \"non-violence\" label can only be viewed as objectively violent.\n\nThe purposes behind the development of the nonviolent genre are primarily reactionary in nature. As video quality and level of gaming technology have increased, the violent nature of some video games has gained worldwide attention from moral, political, gender, and medical/psychological quarters. The popularity of violent video games and increases in youth violence have led to much research into the degree to which video games may be blamed for societally negative behaviors. Despite the inconclusive nature of the scientific results, a number of groups have rejected violent video games as offensive and have promoted the development of non-violent alternatives. The existence of a market for such games has in turn led to the manufacture and distribution of a number of games specifically designed for the nonviolent gaming community. Video game reviewers have additionally identified a number of games belonging to traditionally violent gameplay genres as \"nonviolent\" in comparison to a typical game from the violent genre. Despite the fact that some of these games contain mild violence, many of them have entered the argot of nonviolent gamers as characteristic non-violent games.\n\nControversies surrounding the negative influences of video games are nearly as old as the medium itself. In 1964, Marshall McLuhan, a noted media theorist, suggested in his book, \"\", that \"[t]he games people play reveal a great deal about them. \" This was built upon in the early 1980s in an anti-video-game crusade spearheaded by the former Long Island PTA president, Ronnie Lamm, who spoke about her cause on the MacNeil/Lehrer NewsHour in December 1982. The same year, Surgeon General, C. Everett Koop, had suggested that games had no merit and offered little in the way of anything constructive to young people. Despite early general claims of the negative effects of video games, however, effects of these concerns were relatively minor prior to the early 1990s.\n\nDiscussion of the impact of violence in video games came as early as 1976's \"Death Race\" arcade game (a game with black and white graphics which involved running over screaming zombies). In the 1980s titles such as Exidy's \"Chiller\" (1986), Namco's \"Splatterhouse\" (1987) and Midway's \"NARC\" (1988) raised concerns about video game violence in the arcade. Home games such as Palace's \"Barbarian\" (1987) featured the ability to decapitate opponents. It was not until graphic capabilities increased and a wave of new ultra-violent titles were released in the early 1990s that the mainstream news began to pay significant attention to the phenomenon. In 1992, with Midway's release of the first \"Mortal Kombat\" video game, and then in 1993 with id's \"Doom\", genuine controversy was first ignited as the wide and growing popularity of violent video games came into direct conflict with the moral and religious ethics of concerned citizens. Protests and game-bannings followed the publicizing of these conflicts, and controversies would erupt periodically throughout the 1990s with the releases of such games as \"Dreamweb\" (1992), \"Wolfenstein 3D\" (1992), \"Mortal Kombat II\" (1993), \"Phantasmagoria\" (1995), \"Duke Nukem 3D\" (1996), \"Blood\" (1997), \"Grand Theft Auto\" (1997), \"Carmageddon\" (1997), \"Postal\" (1997), \"Mortal Kombat 3\" (1997), \"\" (1998), \"\" (1998), \"Grand Theft Auto 2\" (1999), and \"\" (1999) among others.\nIn April 1999, the fears of the media and violence-watch groups were legitimated in their eyes as investigations into the lives of Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, the shooters in the Columbine High School massacre, revealed that they had been fans of the video game, \"Doom\", and had even created levels for it today dubbed \"the Harris levels\". A great deal of discussion of violence in video games followed this event with strong arguments made on both sides, and research into the phenomenon which had begun during the 1980s received renewed support and interest.\n\nIn December 2001, Surgeon General David Satcher, led a study on violence in youth and determined that while the impact of video games on violent behavior has yet to be determined, \"findings suggest that media violence has a relatively small impact on violence,\" and that \"meta-analysis [had demonstrated that] the overall effect size for both randomized and correlational studies was small for physical aggression and moderate for aggressive thinking.\"\n\nDespite this, the controversies and debate have persisted, and this has been the catalyst for the emergence of the non-violent video game genre. Non-violent video games are defined in the negative by a \"Modus tollendo ponens\" disjunctive argument. In other words, in order to recognize a non-violent game, an identifier must recognize the violent game as a distinct class. This has led to a degree of ambiguity in the term as it relies upon a definition of violence which for different identifiers may mean different things. In general, violence may be placed into at least three distinct categories:\n\nThe majority of these games have not been scientifically tested to see whether children learn the skills the games claim to teach.In another study performed in Chile, educational video games were put into some first and second grade classrooms. Children who had the games in their classroom showed more progress in math, reading comprehension, and spelling than the children who did not use games in their classrooms.\n\nThe history of video game development shares approximate contemporaneity with media violence research in general. In the early 1960, studies were conducted on the effects of violence in cartoons, and throughout the 1970s and 1980s a number of studies were conducted on how televised violence influenced viewers (especially younger viewers). The focus of many of these studies was on the effects of exposure of children to violence, and these studies frequently employed the social learning theory framework developed by Albert Bandura to explore violent behavioral modeling.\nWith advancements in video technology and the rise of video games containing graphic violence in the late 1980s and early 1990s, media violence research shifted to a great degree from televised violence to video game violence. Although under current debate, a number of researchers have claimed that violent games may cause more intense feelings of aggression than nonviolent games, and may trigger feelings of anger and hostility. Theoretical explanations for these types of effects have been explained in myriad theories including social cognitive theory, excitation transfer theory, priming effect and the General Aggression Model. However recent scholarship has suggested that social cognitive theories of aggression are outdated and should be retired.\n\nOne difference between video games and television which nearly all media violence studies recognize is that video games are primarily interactive while television is primarily passive in nature. Video game players identify with the character they control in the video games and there have been suggestions that the interactivity available in violent video games narrows the gap between the theory and practice of youth violence in a manner that goes beyond the effects of televised violence. Acknowledgment of the fact that, for better or worse, video games are likely to remain a part of modern society has led to a brace of comparative studies between violent games and non-violent games. As technology has advanced, such studies have adapted to include the effects of violent games and non-violent games in new media methods such as immersive virtual reality simulations.\n\nResults have varied, with some research indicating correlation between violence in video games and violence in players of the games, and other research indicating minimal if any relationship. Despite the lack of solid conclusion on the issue, the suggestion that violent games cause youth violence together with the clear popularity of violent video game genres such as the first-person shooter have led some game designers to publish non-violent alternatives.\n\nAs research supporting the view that video game violence leads to youth violence has been produced, there have been a number of lawsuits initiated by victims to gain compensation for loss alleged to have been caused by video-game-related violence. Similarly, in the US Congress and the legislatures of states and other countries, a number of legislative actions have been taken to mandate rating systems and to curb the distribution of violent video games. At times, individual games considered too violent have been censored or banned in such countries as Australia, Greece, etc.\nIn 1997, Christian conservative activist and (now former) attorney Jack Thompson brought suit against Atari, Nintendo, Sega, and Sony Computer Entertainment on behalf of the victims of Heath High School shooting in \"James v. Meow Media\". The suit was dismissed in 2000, absolving the companies of responsibility for the shooter's actions based on a lack of remedy under Kentucky tort law. In 2002, the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the dismissal, and in 2003, the U.S. Supreme Court denied certiorari, refusing to review the case because it was not dismissed on 1st Amendment grounds.\n\nIn 2000, the County Council for St. Louis, Missouri enacted Ordinance 20,193 that barred minors from purchasing, renting, or playing violent video games deemed to contain any visual depiction or representation of realistic injury to a human or a \"human-like being\" that appealed to minors' \"morbid interest in violence.\" This ordinance was challenged in 2001 by the Interactive Digital Software Association (IDSA) as violative of freedom of expression as guaranteed by the first amendment. The IDSA cited the 7th Circuit case of \"American Amusement Machine Association v. Kendrick\" as precedent suggesting that video game content was a form of freedom of expression, however in 2002 the Eastern District Court of Missouri ultimately issued the controversial ruling that \"video games are not a form of expression protected by the First Amendment\" in \"Interactive Digital Software Association v. St. Louis County\".\n\nIn the aftermath of the Columbine High School massacre, a $5 billion lawsuit was filed in 2001 against a number of video game companies and id Software, the makers of the purportedly violent video game, \"Doom\" by victims of the tragedy. Also named in the suit were Acclaim Entertainment, Activision, Capcom, Eidos Interactive, GT Interactive Software, Interplay Entertainment, Nintendo, Sony Computer Entertainment, Square Co., Midway Games, Apogee Software, Atari Corporation, Meow Media, and Sega. Violent video games mentioned by name included \"Doom\", \"Quake\", \"Redneck Rampage\", and \"Duke Nukem\". The suit was dismissed by Judge Babcock in March 2002 in a ruling suggesting that a decision against the game makers would have a chilling effect on free speech. Babcock noted that \"it is manifest that there is social utility in expressive and imaginative forms of entertainment, even if they contain violence.\"\n\nIn 2003, Washington State enacted a statute banning the sale or rental to minors of video games containing \"aggressive conflict in which the player kill, injures, or otherwise causes physical harm to a human form in the game who is depicted by dress or other recognizable symbols as a public law enforcement officer.\" In 2004, this statute was subsequently declared an unconstitutional violation of the first amendment right to free speech in the Federal District Court case of \"Video Software Dealers Ass'n v. Maleng\".\n\nIn 2005, Jack Thompson brought suit against Sony Computer Entertainment and \"Grand Theft Auto\" in representation of the victims of the Devin Moore shooting incident. On 7 November 2005, Thompson withdrew from \"Strickland v. Sony\", stating, \"It was my idea [to leave the case].\" He was quick to mention that the case would probably do well with or without his presence. This decision followed scrutiny from Judge James Moore, however Thompson claimed he received no pressure to withdraw. At the same time, Judge James Moore had taken the motion to revoke Thompson's license under advisement. Jack Thompson appeared in court to defend his \"pro hac vice\" right to practice law in Alabama, following accusations that he violated legal ethics. Shortly thereafter, the case was dismissed and Thompson's license was revoked following a denial of his \"pro hac vice\" standing by Judge Moore who noted that \"Mr. Thompson's actions before this Court suggest that he is unable to conduct himself in a manner befitting practice in this state.\" In March 2006, the Alabama Supreme Court upheld Judge Moore's ruling against the dismissal of the case.\n\nIn 2005, California State Senator, Leland Yee introduced California Assembly Bills 1792 & 1793 which barred ultra-violent video games and mandated the application of ESRB ratings for video games. Yee, a former child psychologist has publicly criticized such games as \"\" and \"Manhunt 2\", and opposes the U.S. Army's \"Global Gaming League\". Both of these bills were passed by the assembly and signed by Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger in October 2005. By December 2005, both bills had been struck down in court by Judge Ronald Whyte as unconstitutional, thereby preventing either from going into effect on 1 January 2006. Similar bills were subsequently filed in such states as Michigan and Illinois, but to date all have been ruled to be unconstitutional.\n\nIn 2005, in reaction to such controversial games as \"\", Senator Hillary Clinton along with Senators Joe Lieberman and Evan Bayh, introduced the Family Entertainment Protection Act (S.2126), intended to protect children from inappropriate content found in video games by imposing a federal mandate for inclusion of ESRB ratings. All three senators have actively sought restrictions on video game content with Sen. Lieberman denouncing the violence contained in video games and attempting to regulate sales of violent video games to minors, arguing that games should have to be labeled based upon age-appropriateness. Regarding \"Grand Theft Auto\", Lieberman has stated, \"The player is rewarded for attacking a woman, pushing her to the ground, kicking her repeatedly and then ultimately killing her, shooting her over and over again. I call on the entertainment companies—they've got a right to do that, but they have a responsibility not to do it if we want to raise the next generation of our sons to treat women with respect.\"\n\nIn June 2006, the Louisiana case of \"Entertainment Software Association v. Foti\" struck down a state statute that sought to bar minors from purchasing video games with violent content. The statute was declared an unconstitutional violation of the 1st Amendment. Amici filing briefs included Jack Thompson.\n\nOn 27 September 2006, Senator Sam Brownback (R-KS) introduced the United States Truth in Video Game Rating Act (S.3935). The act would require the ESRB to have access to the full content of and hands-on time with the games it was to rate, rather than simply relying on the video demonstrations submitted by developers and publishers. Two days later, Congressman Fred Upton introduced the Video Game Decency Act (H.R.6120) to the House.\n\nVideo game rating boards exist in a number of countries, typically placing restrictions (suggested or under force of law) for content that is violent or sexual in nature. About 5% of games fall into a category rated \"mature\" and recommended to those 17 years old and older. Those games account for about a quarter of all video game sales. Gamers seeking violence find themselves increasingly age restricted as identified violence level increases. This means that non-violent games, which are the least restricted, are available to all players at any age. This moral or legislative public policy against violence has the indirect effect of encouraging players of all ages and especially younger players to play non-violent games, however it also produces something of a forbidden fruit effect. For this and other reasons, the effectiveness of rating systems such as the ESRB to actually curb violent gameplay in youth gaming has been characterized as futile.\n\nTable of violence ratings\n\nA number of studies have been conducted specifically analyzing the differences between male and female preference in video game styles. Studies have vacillated between findings that the gender effect on violence preference in games is significant and insignificant, however no firm conclusions have been achieved to date. The number of studies in this field has blossomed contemporaneously with greater gender studies, and a degree of tension exists in the field between the traditional stereotype of violence as a male-dominant characteristic and the realities of the marketing data for violent games.\n\nIn 2008, an example of such studies was funded by the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention, U.S. Department of Justice to the Center for Mental Health and Media. These studies were released in the book, \"Grand Theft Childhood\", wherein it was found that among girls, nine of the \"top ten [most popular video games] were nonviolent games such as \"Mario\" titles, \"Dance Dance Revolution\" or simulation games\" compared to a majority of violent games in the top ten favorites of boys. Ultimately, the conclusion reached in \"Grand Theft Childhood\" was that \"focusing on such easy but minor targets as violent video games causes parents, social activists and public-policy makers to ignore the much more powerful and significant causes of youth violence that have already been well established, including a range of [non-gender-linked] social, behavioral, economic, biological and mental-health factors.\" This conclusion supports Surgeon General Satcher's 2001 study (\"supra\").\n\nDespite this conclusion, general awareness of the issue together with traditional stereotyping has led a number of game developers and designers to create non-violent video games specifically for female audiences. Advertisement placement and other marketing techniques have in the past targeted women as more receptive to non-violent video game genres such as life simulation games, strategy games, or puzzle video games. Although these genres often contain certain degrees of violence, they lack the emphasis on graphic violence characterized for instance by the first-person shooter genre.\n\nCriticism for the violent aspects of video game culture has come from a number of anti-violence groups, and perhaps the most vocal of these are the numerous religious opposition groups. The moral codes of nearly all major religions contain prohibitions against murder and violence in general. In some cases this prohibition even extends to aggression, wrath, and anger. Violent video games, while merely vicarious in nature, have been the focus of religious disapproval or outrage in various circles. Notable anti-violent-video-game crusader, former attorney Jack Thompson is a self proclaimed Christian conservative, and his legal actions against violent video games have been intimately linked to his religious views. As groups like the fundamentalist Christian population have increased in number of adherents, new marketing opportunities have developed contemporaneously. Several religion-centric games forums such as GameSpot's \"Religion and Philosophy\" forum have developed within the greater gaming community in reaction to this growing niche.\n\nThere has been a rapid increase in Christian video games in the last decade, however as Christian games have striven to compete with their more popular secular progenitors, there has been an increasing number of games released that blur the lines between Christian and non-Christian values. Jack Thompson, for instance, has publicly decried such Christian games as \"\", stating \"It's absurd, ... you can be the Christians blowing away the infidels, and if that doesn't hit your hot button, you can be the Antichrist blowing away all the Christians.\" (The game reviewers IGN, Ars Technica and GameSpy have disagreed that \"Left Behind: Eternal Forces\" is overtly violent.) Similarly, James Dobson, PhD., founder of the Focus on the Family group, has advised parents in relation to video games to \"avoid the violent ones altogether.\nAlthough Christian games have been around since Sparrow Records' \"Music Machine\" for the Atari 2600, there have been few genres as unassailably violent as that of the first-person shooter (FPS). The majority of games that have been banned for violence have been FPS games, and for this reason, Christian games in the FPS genre have struggled to overcome the blurring effects of the violence inherent to the genre. Games such as \"Revelation 7\" and \"Xibalba\", for instance, have attempted to avoid claims of violence by using \"off the wall\" absurdist humor with enemies such as flying, bat-winged clown heads (modeled after the biblical Jezebel) that shoot rays out of their nose, or alien Nazis (a mocking reference to Raëlian religious beliefs) Other Christian FPS games such as \"Eternal War\" have avoided the issue by expressing the view that justified violence is morally acceptable.\n\nSome of these games, despite containing objectively violent content, have been affirmatively labeled \"non-violent video games\" by marketers and faith-based non-violent gaming communities. In direct response to the Columbine High School massacre (alleged to have been caused by the shooters' obsession with the game, \"Doom\"), Rev. Ralph Bagley began production on \"Catechumen\", a Christian first-person game produced by N'Lightening Software involving holy swords instead of guns. In \"Catechumen\", the player fights inhuman demons using holy armament. When \"sent back\" the demons produce no blood or gore, and for this reason it has been described as a non-violent game. The intent of \"Catechumen\", according to Rev. Bagley, is \"to build the genre of Christian gaming. People are tired of having these violent, demonic games dictating to their kids.\" Among Christian FPS games, a lack of gore has often been used as the minimum standard for non-violence. Christian game reviewers have at times characterized non-Christian games such as \"Portal\" and \"Narbacular Drop\" as comparatively non-violent games despite their lack of a Christian focus.\n\nAn example of a notable Christian video game organization is the Christian Game Developers Foundation, focusing on family-friendly gameplay and Biblical principles. Another well known Christian video game creator and distributor is Wisdom Tree which is best known for its unlicensed Christian video games on the Nintendo Entertainment System.\n\nIn 2006, Escapist magazine reported that a Hindu first-person shooter entitled \"My Hindu Shooter\" was in the works. In \"My Hindu Shooter\", a game based on the Unreal Engine, the player employs the Vedic abilities of astrology, Ayurvedic healing, breathing (meditation), herbalism, Gandharva Veda music, architecture (which let you purify demonic areas) and yagyas (rituals). Gameplay involved acquisition of the siddhis of clairvoyance, levitation, invisibility, shrinking and strength, and the ultimate goal of the game was to achieve pure consciousness by removing karma through completion of quests and cleansing the six chakras in ascending order. The only way to actually win the game is to complete it without harming or killing any other living creature. Despite the violence-free requirements of the main character, however, a player could die and be reincarnated in a number of different forms like a human, a pig, a dog, or a worm. Whatever form you came back as would limit the way in which you could interact with other characters in the game. Like the majority of games that have been labeled non-violent, violence in the game that is applied to the character rather than that the character applies is not considered to make the game a violent game.\n\nAccording to Buddhist morality, the first of the Five Precepts of Śīla is a personal rule of not killing. This moral guideline extends to human as well as non-human life. \nThere are five conditions to violate the first precept:\n\nAs the first precept requires an actual living being to be killed to be considered as violated, Buddhists can still enjoy video games with violence because there is no real being that is dying or being hurt. The fuller extent of the first precept is to maintain a harmless attitude towards all. The main problem is the mind, which is the main focus of Buddhism. Violent video games tend to create ill-will and tension, thus it is not conducive for meditation practice. Other than that, the action of the mind also creates \"kamma\" (action) which will bear its fruit when the conditions are right.\n\nAlthough primarily browser games, a number of stand-alone video games eschewing violence, such as the 2007 Thai game \"Ethics Game\" have been created that promote the Five Precepts and Buddhism generally. The Buddhist concept of dharma has been emphasized in a number of Buddhist games as a reaction to perceptions of the adharmic state of modern games. The concept of zen has also influenced a number of nonviolent video games such as \"Zen of Sudoku\", and The Game Factory's \"Zenses\" series.\n\nWhile the earliest games to feature a Jewish main character (the \"Wolfenstein\" series' William \"B.J.\" Blazkowicz) are characterized by militant anti-Nazism, a number of non-violent Jewish games (such as the \"Avner\" series by Torah Educational Software (TES)) primarily aimed at younger audiences has emerged with the intention of promoting Jewish religious concepts related to the Torah. One notable non-violent game that explores Jewish themes is \"The Shivah\", a puzzle-adventure game featuring a non-violent battle between Rabbis that takes the form of an insult swordfight.\n\nDespite notoriety in the Western press for controversial violent games such as \"Under Ash\", and \"Under Siege\", Muslim developer Afkar Media has also produced at least one non-violent game entitled \"Road Block Buster\". In \"Road Block Buster\" the hero must \"jump[] around [] doing tricks to soldiers ... [attempt] to get over any barrier or road block implanted by Israeli Defense forces without using violence, [and] earn respect by helping surrounded people whom can't get through the separation walls.\"\n\nExceptionally rare, the few Sikh games (e.g. \"Sikh Game\") in existence are primarily browser-based. \"Sarbloh Warriors\", planned to contain mild violence, and characterized by the BBC as Anti-Muslim, entered production as a major Sikh game, but seems to have left active production around 2007.\n\nIn January 2007, artist Chris Nelson produced a non-violent art game called \"The Seven Valleys\" which he exhibited during the ACSW conference at the University of Ballarat. Based on the \"Unreal Tournament\" engine, \"The Seven Valleys\" was designed with the intention of \"illustrat[ing] the unillustratable, and 'subvert[ing]' the image of violent video games in the process.\" Nelson was interviewed by ABC Radio on the subject in February of the same month.\n\nVideo game publisher, Destineer's non-violent puzzle video game, \"WordJong\" for the Nintendo DS has been considered a Taoist puzzle game.\n\nNon-profit organization Heartseed set out to produce several non-violent games, drawing inspiration from a claimed agreement between several religions under the sign of nonviolence: \"Christianity, Hinduism, Islam, Buddhism, Taoism, Judaism and others, – because throughout all of them can be found a common thread of decency meant to propel us toward spiritual enlightenment\". This project seems to have been discontinued.\n\nNon-violent video games as a genre are characterized as a genre by purpose. Unlike genres described by style of gameplay, non-violent video games span a wide number of gameplay genres. Defined in the negative, the purpose of non-violent games is to provide the player with an experience that \"lacks\" violence. Many traditional gameplay genres naturally lack violence and application of the term \"non-violent video games\" to titles that fall under these categories raises no questions regarding accuracy. For game developers and designers who self-identify as non-violent video game makers, however, the challenge has been to expand the concepts of non-violence into such traditionally violent gameplay genres as action games, role-playing games, strategy games, and the first-person shooter.\n\nEmergent and more recent gameplay genres such as music video games are for the most part naturally non-violent. Purposive video game genres such as educational games also are primarily non-violent in nature. Other electronic game genres like audio games are also most frequently non-violent. The indisputably non-violent nature of these games are often considered self-evident by members of both the non-violent gaming community and the gaming community at large. As such they are often not explicitly identified as such. Typically, explicit identification is applied counterintuitively to titles where there might otherwise be a question concerning non-violence. This has led such categorization to be viewed with mistrust, hostility, and mockery by those who fail to recognize the comparative nature of the definition or who disagree fundamentally with the underlying purpose of the genre.\n\nAmong traditionally non-violent games are included maze games, adventure games, life simulation games, construction and management simulation games, and some vehicle simulation games among others. These games are generally less frequently described as non-violent due to the self-evident nature of the descriptive term. Prior to the development of games specifically designed for non-violence, non-violent gamers were limited to these traditionally non-violent genres, however a number of games even under the traditionally non-violent umbrella may be considered arguably violent. \"Minesweeper\", for instance, is an abstraction of a scenario that often leads to a patently violent result.\n\nOther common traditionally non-violent genres include adventure games, puzzle games, music video games, programming games, party games, and traditional games.\n\nExamples of traditionally non-violent games include:\n\nAction games have typically been among the most violent of video games genres with the liberal employment of enemies to thwart the actions of the player-character, and an emphasis on killing these enemies to neutralize them. As action games have developed they have become progressively more violent over the years as advances in graphic capabilities allowed for more realistic enemies and death sequences. Nevertheless, some companies like Nintendo have tended to shy away from this kind of realism in favor of cartoon and fantasy violence, a concept also implicated in the increase of youth violence by media violence researchers. This has created a spectrum of violence in action games. Non-violent video game proponents have labeled a number of games containing comparatively low-level violence as non-violent as well as games such as the anti-violent serious game, \"Food Force\".\n\nStudies have also shown that there are tangible benefits to violence in action games such as increased ability to process visual information quickly and accurately. This has led to support for the development of action games that are non-violent which will allow players to retain the positive visual processing benefits without the negatives associated with violence.\n\nExamples of non-violent action games include:\n\nThe application of the term \"non-violent\" to genres such as the first-person shooter (FPS), that many players consider \"inherently\" or \"definitionally\" violent, has at times generated vociferous arguments that the concept is inconceivable and at best oxymoronic. This argument typically derives from a strict definition of violence as \"extreme, destructive, or uncontrollable force especially of natural events; intensity of feeling or expression, \" a definition by which the vast majority of video games may be described as violent. Despite arguments to the contrary, however, such characterizations have been employed as a marketing tool by makers and distributors of non-violent video games, and the degree of popularity enjoyed by games so described may be attributed to the comparative violence of other more violent members of the supergenre.\n\nNon-violent first-person shooter developers have expressed the notion that it is the challenge of making a non-violent game in a violent genre that motivates them in part. Rarely, FPS games such as \"Garry's Mod\" and \"Portal\" that have been developed without the specific intent of non-violence have been identified by reviewers and the non-violent gaming community as non-violent FPSes. Such characterizations have led to the concern that parents may allow their children to play these games, not realizing that there are still some elements of violence including violent deaths. Further ambiguities arise when determining whether a game is a first-person \"shooter\", as in certain games such as \"Narbacular Drop\", the player doesn't shoot anything at all, but merely clicks walls with the cursor. Similarly, in games such as \"realMyst\", the player merely interacts with the environment by touching things in the first-person and the term \"shooter\" is seen to be objectively inaccurate. Despite this, non-violent first-person games have often been characterized oxymoronically as shooters because of all comparable genres, these games are most closely similar to the FPS and often employ engines designed for the FPS genre.\n\nOften modeled upon violent FPS games, non-violent FPSes such as \"Chex Quest\" or the newer Sherlock Holmes games, may bear striking resemblance to the violent game whose engine they are using. Developers of such games often have done little to change the game other than replacing violent or scary imagery and recasting the storyline to describe \"zorching\", \"slobbing\", or otherwise non-lethally incapacitating enemies. Examples of simple changes intended to reduce violence for non-violent FPSes include the alteration of the red shroud from the death-sequence in \"Doom\" to become the green shroud from the slime-sequence in \"Chex Quest\" or the removal of the red shroud from the death-sequence in \"Half-Life 2\" for the deaths in \"Portal\". At times, similarities between violent progenitors and their non-violent descendants have proved strong enough that the non-violent developers have cast their game as a spoof of the violent version. This is apparent in \"Chex Quest\". Off-beat and absurdist humor have been employed in a number of games order to tone down the serious content by makers of non-violent FPSes.\n\nOne subgenre of the FPS that typically is not characterized as non-violent despite the fact that gameplay revolves to a great degree around avoidance of battle, is that of stealth games. Although much of the gameplay characteristic to stealth games accords closely with the requirements of the non-violent genre, stealth games most frequently simply delay chaotic violence to focus instead upon controlled precision violence. When stealth and violence are both present as options, stealth is often presented as the superior option for being morally superior or requiring greater skill.\n\nExamples of non-violent FPSes include:\n\nThough infrequently regarded as explicitly violent, role-playing video games (RPGs) have traditionally focused on the adventures of a party of travelers as they spend days and months leveling-up to fight greater and greater foes. Fighting in these games is highly stylized and often turn-based, however the actions of the player-characters and the enemies that attack them are distinctly violent. There have been some attempts made to reduce this violence by rendering it in cartoonish format as in some members of the \"Final Fantasy\" series or by recasting the enemies' deaths as \"fainting,\" \"sleeping,\" or becoming \"stunned\" as in the \"Pokémon\" series, however neither of these series has been explicitly labeled non-violent.\n\nOne rare example of an RPG that was designed as a non-violent video game is \"Spiritual Warfare\", a game with enemies featuring a non-violent main-character wherein the player wanders about converting the denizens of his town to Christianity while fending off the attacks of wild animals with holy food. Another example is \"A Tale in the Desert\", an MMORPG based on economic development.\n\nSecular examples include Capcom's \"Ace Attorney\" series and Victor's \"Story of Seasons\" series – a simulation/RPG game. Additionally, such RPGs as \"\", \"\", and \"Deus Ex\" have all been identified as containing certain modes of play that are mostly non-violent. This concept is also explored in the higher difficulty levels of the \"Thief\" series.\n\nIn 2015 the fan-funded indie RPG \"Undertale\" allowed players to choose whether or not to use violent methods, in a story that includes both explicit and subtextual commentary on the nature of violence in videogames.\n\nAs with role-playing games, strategy games have traditionally focused on the development and expansion of a group as they defend themselves from the attacks of enemies. Strategy games tend not to be explicitly described as violent, however they nearly universally contain violent content in the form of battles, wars, and other skirmishes. Additionally, strategy games tend to more often strive for realistic scenarios and depictions of the battles that result. Counteracting this violence, however, is the fact that strategy games tend to be set at a distant third party perspective and as such the violence of the battles tends to be minute and highly stylized.\n\nFor the most part, non-violent groups have not explored this genre of violent game. Gender-marketers have designed strategy games for both male and female audiences, however gender-linked treatment of violence has not occurred in this genre and as such, male- and female-oriented strategy games tend to contain equal degrees of violence. Christian developers have made various attempts at the genre including \"\" in which the player attempts to convert as many civilians in an apocalyptic future as possible by raising their spirit level and shielding them from the corrupting influences of rock-and-roll music and general secularism. The game has been criticized by such anti-violent video game personalities as former attorney Jack Thompson for strategy involving the slaying of infidels and non-believers, and for the ability of players engaged in multi-play modes to play as the Antichrist on the side of the Forces of Satan.\n\nSecular non-violent video game designers have emerged from the serious games movement and include such anti-violence titles as \"PeaceMaker\", a game where the player tries to foster peace between Israelis and Palestinians, and \"A Force More Powerful\", a nonviolence-themed game designed by Steve York, a documentary filmmaker and director of Bringing Down a Dictator, a non violent resistance film featuring Ivan Marovic, a resistance leader against Slobodan Milošević who was instrumental in bringing him down in 2000. Though these games are anti-violent, however, failure on the part of the player leads to violence. Thus the goal of the game is merely shifted to active violence-prevention while the degree of violence used to challenge the player remains consistent with violent strategy games.\n\nSome examples of relatively nonviolent strategy games include:\n\nAccording to the Funk and Buchman method for classifying video games, there are six categories into which games may be divided:\n\nThe separation of violent and nonviolent sports here illustrates a phenomenon also recognizable in the vehicle simulation game genre. With both sport and vehicle simulation games, gameplay has traditionally been highly bipolar with nearly as many violent titles as non-violent. Just as there are non-violent and \"violent\" sports games, so too are there flight and \"combat\" flight simulators, space flight and space \"combat\" simulators, and racing games and vehicular \"combat\" games. Distinction of games as violent or non-violent here serves a purely practical purpose as gameplay may differ considerably beyond the merely aesthetic.\n\nSuch sports as Ping-pong, golf, and billiards, have in the past been identified as nonviolent. A common example of a nonviolent game that has been employed in a number of studies and government committee reports is \"\".\n\nAn example of a notable non-violent sports game company is Kush Games.\n\n"}

{"id": "2683082", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2683082", "title": "Passage (Willis novel)", "text": "Passage (Willis novel)\n\nPassage is a science fiction novel by Connie Willis, published in 2001. The novel won the Locus Award for Best Novel in 2002, was shortlisted for the Nebula Award in 2001, and received nominations for the Hugo, Campbell, and Clarke Awards in 2002.\n\n\"Passage\" follows the efforts of Joanna Lander, a research psychologist, to understand the phenomenon of near-death experiences (or NDEs) by interviewing hospital patients after they are revived following clinical death. Her work with Dr. Richard Wright, a neurologist who has discovered a way to chemically induce an artificial NDE and conduct an \"RIPT\" brain scan during the experience, leads her to the discovery of the biological purpose of NDEs. \n\nScience fiction scholar Gary K. Wolfe writes, \"Willis tries something truly astonishing: without resorting to supernaturalism on the one hand or clinical reportage on the other, without forgoing her central metaphor, she seeks to lift the veil on what actually happens inside a dying mind.\" Through Lander's work, Dr. Wright is able to develop a medicine that brings patients back from clinical death.\n\nThe novel contains enlightening discussions of various disasters, including the \"RMS Titanic\", the Hartford circus fire, the Hindenburg disaster, the Eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79, the 1883 eruption of Krakatoa, the Boston Molasses Disaster, and, almost as prominently as the \"Titanic\", the sinking of the \"USS Yorktown\". (Willis has written extensively in several novels about events in World War II.)\n\nConnie Willis's inspiration for \"Passage\" came in part from her mother's death, when Willis was 12. Willis felt frustrated that relatives and friends tried to comfort her with platitudes, so she wanted to write a novel that dealt with death honestly and could help people understand the process of death and mourning.\n\nThe character of Maurice Mandrake was inspired by Willis's anger at psychics and mediums who take advantage of vulnerable people.\n\nJoanna Lander, a clinical psychologist, interviews patients who have had near-death experiences; she aspires to understand what occurs between the times when a person dies and then is revived. She becomes frustrated when many of her patients cannot or will not give accurate information about their experiences. She realizes that the scientific evidence is contaminated by the influence of Dr. Maurice Mandrake, a persistent and almost omnipresent charlatan \"researcher\" who publishes best-selling books about near-death experiences and convinces patients that their experiences happened exactly the way his books describe NDEs, such as learning cosmic secrets from angels:\n\nDr. Richard Wright, who has discovered a way to induce artificial NDEs in patients and monitor their brain activity throughout, contacts Joanna and asks if she will join his research study and interview his patients after he induces NDEs. She agrees. They are intellectually compatible and have a budding, mutual romantic interest.\n\nMandrake considers the pair his competitors, and he sabotages their efforts by approaching revived patients before they can. Mandrake's method is to ask mellifluous leading questions of the patients and thereby taint their self-reported NDEs; this causes Joanna and Richard hardship in finding un-interviewed volunteers for their own study. The reader later learns that two of their volunteers are liars, which also corrupts their conjectures.\n\nLacking enough volunteers for proper methodology, Joanna elects to undergo the process. She gets the help of Tish, a nurse, to help with the prep; Tish is happy to, because she thinks Richard Wright is \"cute\" and can flirt with him while Joanna is \"under\".\n\nJoanna finds herself in a dark passage that, through further NDEs, she realizes is part of a dream-like version of the \"RMS Titanic\", on which she encounters passengers of the real \"Titanic\" as well as someone symbolically near death, a high school teacher whom she had studied with a decade or so earlier, Mr. Pat Briarley. Between NDE sessions, Joanna struggles to figure out why she sees the \"Titanic\", and she eventually tracks down Mr. Briarley, who spoke often of the \"Titanic\" in class. Joanna discovers that Mr. Briarley, once a highly animated and keen teacher, now suffers from Alzheimer's disease. This is crushing to Joanna, who was certain that Mr. Briarley could give her \"the key\" to clarify why she sees the \"Titanic\". However, Mr. Briarley's niece, Kit, promises to help.\n\nJoanna also consults with Maisie Nellis, a nine-year-old girl who suffers from a heart defect, \"V-fib\", because Maisie, a born rationalist, gives only accurate information about her NDEs. Maisie also gives Joanna important information about the \"Titanic\".\n\nThrough talking with her patients and undergoing more NDEs, Lander realizes that the near-death experience is a mechanism that the brain uses to create a scenario symbolic of what the brain attempts to do when it is dying: find a suitable neural pathway by which to send a message that can \"jump start\" the rest of the body back into life. If the person having a real near-death experience can metaphorically send a message to someone appearing in the NDE, she learns (specifically, from a revived coma patient), the person will awaken and survive.\n\nBefore she can tell Richard Wright about her discovery, she goes to visit Nurse Vielle in the Emergency Room and is stabbed by a man deranged by a drug called \"rogue\". Before losing consciousness, she manages to say a few words to Vielle, trying to communicate her discovery about NDEs. She finds herself on the \"Titanic\" again and races against dream-like obstacles to escape and awaken.\n\nRichard Wright, on hearing that Joanna is dying or dead, enters an artificial NDE, thinking that he will find himself in the \"Titanic\" and be able to rescue Lander. He instead finds himself at the offices of the White Star Line, where the names of the victims of the \"Titanic\" disaster are being read to the public - he is too late to \"save\" Joanna. He awakens many hours later, and Tish, crying, tells him that Joanna has died.\n\nAs Richard and Joanna's friends struggle with her death, Joanna herself remains on the \"Titanic\" until it sinks, and her memories of life fade away.\n\nRichard realizes that Joanna was trying to tell him something before she died (they had discussed the importance of last words), and he tracks down all the people she spoke to before she was stabbed. He learns what Joanna discovered. Before she could reach him, Joanna had told, of all people, Mandrake, \"The NDE is a message. It's an SOS. It's a call for help.\" Grasping her dying message, Richard develops a chemical treatment that he believes can revive a patient. Maisie suffers V-fib and dies, but Richard successfully uses his experimental treatment on her, and she later receives a heart transplant; she will live.\n\nWithin her final NDE, on an imaginary ship, Joanna finds herself adrift on the water, with some memories still intact and accompanied by a child and a dog which Maisie has told her about from other disasters. As the novel ends, they watch the approach of a ship repeatedly mentioned by Ed Wojakowski.\n\n\nWillis includes elements of madcap comedy in the style and form of \"Passage\", and links different events thematically in order to foreshadow later events.\n\nThe novel celebrates metaphor, the very idea of which gives Joanna the understanding of how the NDE works to help the dying brain, rather than to ease it into death.\n\nWillis gives certain dialogue traits to some characters. Joanna, seeking to avoid leading questions, continuously asks of patients and even friends, \"Can you describe it?\" and \"Can you be more specific?\" (When she finds Dr. Wright starting to unconsciously mimic her, she grins in approval.) Maisie, meanwhile, always manipulating Joanna and others to remain with her during her boring bouts in hospital rooms, tends to begin questions with, \"Did you know...?\" as in, about the \"Hindenburg\", \"Did you know they had a piano? Up in a balloon?\" Later, when Kit Briarley begins a question, \"Did you know...?\" Joanna laughs in appreciation.\n\nWhen they gather to watch movies one night, Vielle tells Richard, \"As if talking to patients about their NDEs isn't bad enough, in her spare time Joanna researches famous people's last words.\" So does Willis: each chapter section and each chapter has an epigraph; they include:\n\n\nWillis has the characters discuss a great many movies, some of which have indirect or obvious bearing on the novel's themes. They include \"Coma\", \"Fight Club\", \"Final Destination\", \"Flatliners\", \"Harold and Maude\", and \"Peter Pan\", as well as \"The Twilight Zone\" and \"The X-Files\".\n\nJoanna frequently talks about the \"Titanic\" movie; she, Vielle, Pat and Kit Briarley, and others share her dislike of it because of the changes to historical fact. Joanna (speaking for Willis), complains:\n\nGary K. Wolfe, the first of many \"Locus\" reviewers to discuss the book at time of publication, compares the novel at many points with Willis's \"Lincoln's Dreams\" and writes:\nWolfe continues: \n\nFaren Miller wrote in \"Locus\": \n\nSciFi.com describes \"Passage\" as \"an emotionally exhausting trip\" that is ultimately \"a rewarding experience.\" Laura Miller, writing for \"Salon\", says that \"its construction is a marvel of ingenuity and — what's even more remarkable, given the wizardry of Willis' storytelling — its intellectual honesty is impeccable... You won't find the beautiful sentences of more-celebrated 'novelists of ideas' here, though the ideas themselves are far better, more daring and more original, than those chewed over by most literary heavyweights. The dialogue can sound a trifle canned, the minor characters feel a mite thin (not that many novels of ideas don't share these flaws, too), which explains in part why \"Passage\" seems to hover between genre and genius. Given how rare a searching intelligence like Willis' is among today's novelists, does it really matter?\"\n\nThe \"SF Site\" review judges that the novel \"starts slowly, and it's too long. Willis' trademark habit of making some set of frustrating everyday-life details a recurring motif or running joke (in this case, the difficulty of navigating the hospital corridors, plus the never-open cafeteria) is over-extended here...\"; conversely, reviewer Steven Wu felt that \"Part One of the book is masterful, with several chilling scenes, a compelling mystery, and a doozy of a cliffhanger ending. But then, only a third of the way through the book, things begin slowing down.\" \n\n\"The A.V. Club\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s reviewer writes: \n\nA reviewer from Scientific Gems wrote of the novel, \"it is well-written, it has an interesting plot, and it has useful things to say about the nature of science and the nature of medicine. One piece of good advice, for example: 'Joanna says you should only say what you saw, not what anybody else says you should see.'\" [Spoken by Maisie Nellis] \"Indeed, the importance of truth is underscored repeatedly in the book. Thanks partly to a very young female patient with a strange taste in literature [Maisie again], there is also some interesting discussion of historical disasters...\"https://scientificgems.wordpress.com/2015/10/08/passage-a-book-review/\n\n"}
{"id": "23479", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23479", "title": "Physicalism", "text": "Physicalism\n\nIn philosophy, physicalism is the metaphysical thesis that \"everything is physical\", that there is \"nothing over and above\" the physical, or that everything supervenes on the physical. Physicalism is a form of ontological monism—a \"one substance\" view of the nature of reality as opposed to a \"two-substance\" (dualism) or \"many-substance\" (pluralism) view. Both the definition of \"physical\" and the meaning of physicalism have been debated.\n\nPhysicalism is closely related to materialism. Physicalism grew out of materialism with advancements of the physical sciences in explaining observed phenomena. The terms are often used interchangeably, although they are sometimes distinguished, for example on the basis of physics describing more than just matter (including energy and physical law). Common arguments against physicalism include both the philosophical zombie argument and the multiple observers argument, that the existence of a physical being may imply zero or more distinct conscious entities.\n\nThe word \"physicalism\" was introduced into philosophy in the 1930s by Otto Neurath and Rudolf Carnap.\n\nThe use of \"physical\" in physicalism is a philosophical concept and can be distinguished from alternative definitions found in the literature (e.g. Karl Popper defined a physical proposition to be one which can at least in theory be denied by observation). A \"physical property\", in this context, may be a metaphysical or logical combination of properties which are physical in the ordinary sense. It is common to express the notion of \"metaphysical or logical combination of properties\" using the notion of supervenience: A property \"A\" is said to supervene on a property \"B\" if any change in \"A\" necessarily implies a change in \"B\". Since any change in a combination of properties must consist of a change in at least one component property, we see that the combination does indeed supervene on the individual properties. The point of this extension is that physicalists usually suppose the existence of various abstract concepts which are non-physical in the ordinary sense of the word; so physicalism cannot be defined in a way that denies the existence of these abstractions. Also, physicalism defined in terms of supervenience does not entail that all properties in the actual world are type identical to physical properties. It is, therefore, compatible with multiple realizability.\n\nFrom the notion of supervenience, we see that, assuming that mental, social, and biological properties supervene on physical properties, it follows that two hypothetical worlds cannot be identical in their physical properties but differ in their mental, social or biological properties.\n\nTwo common approaches to defining \"physicalism\" are the theory-based and object-based approaches. The theory-based conception of physicalism proposes that \"a property is physical if and only if it either is the sort of property that physical theory tells us about or else is a property which metaphysically (or logically) supervenes on the sort of property that physical theory tells us about\". Likewise, the object-based conception claims that \"a property is physical if and only if: it either is the sort of property required by a complete account of the intrinsic nature of paradigmatic physical objects and their constituents or else is a property which metaphysically (or logically) supervenes on the sort of property required by a complete account of the intrinsic nature of paradigmatic physical objects and their constituents\".\n\nPhysicalists have traditionally opted for a \"theory-based\" characterization of the physical either in terms of current physics, or a future (ideal) physics. These two theory-based conceptions of the physical represent both horns of Hempel's dilemma (named after the late philosopher of science and logical empiricist Carl Gustav Hempel): an argument against theory-based understandings of the physical. Very roughly, Hempel's dilemma is that if we define the physical by reference to current physics, then physicalism is very likely to be false, as it is very likely (by pessimistic meta-induction) that much of current physics is false. But if we instead define the physical in terms of a future (ideal) or completed physics, then physicalism is hopelessly vague or indeterminate.\n\nWhile the force of Hempel's dilemma against theory-based conceptions of the physical remains contested, alternative \"non-theory-based\" conceptions of the physical have also been proposed. Frank Jackson (1998) for example, has argued in favour of the aforementioned \"object-based\" conception of the physical. An objection to this proposal, which Jackson himself noted in 1998, is that if it turns out that panpsychism or panprotopsychism is true, then such a non-materialist understanding of the physical gives the counterintuitive result that physicalism is, nevertheless, also true since such properties will figure in a complete account of paradigmatic examples of the physical.\n\nDavid Papineau and Barbara Montero have advanced and subsequently defended a \"via negativa\" characterization of the physical. The gist of the via negativa strategy is to understand the physical in terms of what it is not: the mental. In other words, the via negativa strategy understands the physical as \"the non-mental\". An objection to the via negativa conception of the physical is that (like the object-based conception) it doesn't have the resources to distinguish neutral monism (or panprotopsychism) from physicalism.\n\nAdopting a supervenience-based account of the physical, the definition of physicalism as \"all properties are physical\" can be unravelled to:\n\n1) Physicalism is true at a possible world \"w\" if and only if any world that is a physical duplicate of \"w\" is also a duplicate of \"w simpliciter\".\n\nApplied to the actual world (our world), statement 1 above is the claim that physicalism is true at the actual world if and only if at \"every possible world\" in which the physical properties and laws of the actual world are instantiated, the non-physical (in the ordinary sense of the word) properties of the actual world are instantiated as well. To borrow a metaphor from Saul Kripke (1972), the truth of physicalism at the actual world entails that once God has instantiated or \"fixed\" the physical properties and laws of our world, then God's work is done; the rest comes \"automatically\".\n\nUnfortunately, statement 1 fails to capture even a necessary condition for physicalism to be true at a world \"w\". To see this, imagine a world in which there are \"only\" physical properties—if physicalism is true at any world it is true at this one. But one can conceive physical duplicates of such a world that are \"not\" also duplicates simpliciter of it: worlds that have the same physical properties as our imagined one, but with some additional property or properties. A world might contain \"epiphenomenal ectoplasm\", some additional pure experience that does not interact with the physical components of the world and is not necessitated by them (does not supervene on them). To handle the epiphenomenal ectoplasm problem, statement 1 can be modified to include a \"that's-all\" or \"totality\" clause or be restricted to \"positive\" properties. Adopting the former suggestion here, we can reformulate statement 1 as follows:\n\n2) Physicalism is true at a possible world \"w\" if and only if any world that is a \"minimal\" physical duplicate of \"w\" is a duplicate of \"w simpliciter\".\n\nApplied in the same way, statement 2 is the claim that physicalism is true at a possible world \"w\" if and only if any world that is a physical duplicate of \"w\" (without any further changes), is duplicate of \"w\" without qualification. This allows a world in which there are only physical properties to be counted as one at which physicalism is true, since worlds in which there is some extra stuff are \"not\" \"minimal\" physical duplicates of such a world, nor are they minimal physical duplicates of worlds that contain some non-physical properties that are metaphysically necessitated by the physical.\n\nBut while statement 2 overcomes the problem of worlds at which there is some extra stuff (sometimes referred to as the \"epiphenomenal ectoplasm problem\") it faces a different challenge: the so-called \"blockers problem\". Imagine a world where the relation between the physical and non-physical properties at this world (call the world \"w\") is slightly weaker than metaphysical necessitation, such that a certain kind of non-physical intervener—\"a blocker\"—could, were it to exist at \"w,\" prevent the non-physical properties in \"w\" from being instantiated by the instantiation of the physical properties at \"w.\" Since statement 2 rules out worlds which are physical duplicates of \"w\" that also contain non-physical interveners by virtue of the minimality, or that's-all clause, statement 2 gives the (allegedly) incorrect result that physicalism is true at \"w.\" One response to this problem is to abandon statement 2 in favour of the alternative possibility mentioned earlier in which supervenience-based formulations of physicalism are restricted to what David Chalmers (1996) calls \"positive properties\". A positive property is one that \"...if instantiated in a world W, is also instantiated by the corresponding individual in all worlds that contain W as a proper part.\" Following this suggestion, we can then formulate physicalism as follows:\n\n3) Physicalism is true at a possible world \"w\" if and only if any world that is a physical duplicate of \"w\" is a positive duplicate of \"w\".\n\nOn the face of it, statement 3 seems able to handle both the epiphenomenal ectoplasm problem and the blockers problem. With regard to the former, statement 3 gives the correct result that a purely physical world is one at which physicalism is true, since worlds in which there is some extra stuff are positive duplicates of a purely physical world. With regard to the latter, statement 3 appears to have the consequence that worlds in which there are blockers are worlds where positive non-physical properties of \"w\" will be absent, hence \"w\" will not be counted as a world at which physicalim is true. Daniel Stoljar (2010) objects to this response to the blockers problem on the basis that since the non-physical properties of \"w\" aren't instantiated at a world in which there is a blocker, they are not positive properties in Chalmers' (1996) sense, and so statement 3 will count \"w\" as a world at which physicalism is true after all.\n\nA further problem for supervenience-based formulations of physicalism is the so-called \"necessary beings problem\". A necessary being in this context is a non-physical being that exists in all possible worlds (for example what theists refer to as God). A necessary being is compatible with all the definitions provided, because it is supervenient on everything; yet it is usually taken to contradict the notion that everything is physical. So any supervenience-based formulation of physicalism will at best state a necessary but not sufficient condition for the truth of physicalism.\n\nAdditional objections have been raised to the above definitions provided for supervenience physicalism: one could imagine an alternate world that differs only by the presence of a single ammonium molecule (or physical property), and yet based on statement 1, such a world might be completely different in terms of its distribution of mental properties. Furthermore, there are differences expressed concerning the modal status of physicalism; whether it is a necessary truth, or is only true in a world which conforms to certain conditions (i.e. those of physicalism).\n\nClosely related to supervenience physicalism, is realisation physicalism, the thesis that every instantiated property is either physical or realised by a physical property.\n\nToken physicalism is the proposition that \"for every actual particular (object, event or process) x, there is some physical particular y such that x = y\". It is intended to capture the idea of \"physical mechanisms\". Token physicalism is compatible with property dualism, in which all substances are \"physical\", but physical objects may have mental properties as well as physical properties. Token physicalism is not however equivalent to supervenience physicalism. Firstly, token physicalism does not imply supervenience physicalism because the former does not rule out the possibility of non-supervenient properties (provided that they are associated only with physical particulars). Secondarily, supervenience physicalism does not imply token physicalism, for the former allows supervenient objects (such as a \"nation\", or \"soul\") that are not equal to any physical object.\n\nThere are multiple versions of reductionism. In the context of physicalism, the reductions referred to are of a \"linguistic\" nature, allowing discussions of, say, mental phenomena to be translated into discussions of physics. In one formulation, every concept is analysed in terms of a physical concept. One counter-argument to this supposes there may be an additional class of expressions which is non-physical but which increases the expressive power of a theory. Another version of reductionism is based on the requirement that one theory (mental or physical) be logically derivable from a second.\n\nThe combination of reductionism and physicalism is usually called reductive physicalism in the philosophy of mind. The opposite view is non-reductive physicalism. Reductive physicalism is the view that mental states are both nothing over and above physical states and reducible to physical states. One version of reductive physicalism is type physicalism or mind-body identity theory. Type physicalism asserts that \"for every actually instantiated property F, there is some physical property G such that F=G\". Unlike token physicalism, type physicalism entails supervenience physicalism.\n\nA common argument against reductive physicalism is multiple realizability, the possibility that a psychological process (say) could be instantiated by many different neurological processes (even non-neurological processes, in the case of machine or alien intelligence). For in this case, the neurological terms translating a psychological term must be disjunctions over the possible instantiations, and it is argued that no physical law can use these disjunctions as terms. Type physicalism was the original target of the multiple realizability argument.\n\nThere are two versions of emergentism, the strong version and the weak version. Supervenience physicalism has been seen as a strong version of emergentism, in which the subject's psychological experience is considered genuinely novel. Non-reductive physicalism, on the other side, is a weak version of emergentism because it does not need that the subject's psychological experience be novel. The strong version of emergentism is incompatible with physicalism. Since there are novel mental states, mental states are not nothing over and above physical states. However, the weak version of emergentism is compatible with physicalism. \n\nWe can see that emergentism is actually a very broad view. Some forms of emergentism appear either incompatible with physicalism or equivalent to it (e.g. posteriori physicalism), others appear to merge both dualism and supervenience. Emergentism compatible with dualism claims that mental states and physical states are metaphysically distinct while maintaining the supervenience of mental states on physical states. This proposition however contradicts supervenience physicalism, which asserts a denial of dualism.\n\nPhysicalists hold that physicalism is true. A natural question for physicalists, then, is whether the truth of physicalism is deducible a priori from the nature of the physical world (i.e., the inference is justified independently of experience, even though the nature of the physical world can itself only be determined through experience) or can only be deduced a posteriori (i.e., the justification of the inference itself is dependent upon experience). So-called \"a priori physicalists\" hold that from knowledge of the conjunction of all physical truths, a totality or that's-all truth (to rule out non-physical epiphenomena, and enforce the closure of the physical world), and some primitive indexical truths such as \"I am A\" and \"now is B\", the truth of physicalism is knowable a priori. Let \"P\" stand for the conjunction of all physical truths and laws, \"T\" for a that's-all truth, \"I\" for the indexical \"centering\" truths, and \"N\" for any [presumably non-physical] truth at the actual world. We can then, using the material conditional \"→\", represent a priori physicalism as the thesis that PTI → N is knowable a priori. An important wrinkle here is that the concepts in N must be possessed non-deferentially in order for PTI → N to be knowable a priori. The suggestion, then, is that possession of the concepts in the consequent, plus the empirical information in the antecedent is sufficient for the consequent to be knowable a priori.\n\nAn \"a posteriori physicalist\", on the other hand, will reject the claim that PTI → N is knowable a priori. Rather, they would hold that the inference from PTI to N is justified by metaphysical considerations that in turn can be derived from experience. So the claim then is that \"PTI and not N\" is metaphysically impossible.\n\nOne commonly issued challenge to a priori physicalism and to physicalism in general is the \"conceivability argument\", or zombie argument. At a rough approximation, the conceivability argument runs as follows:\n\nP1) PTI and not Q (where \"Q\" stands for the conjunction of all truths about consciousness, or some \"generic\" truth about someone being \"phenomenally\" conscious [i.e., there is \"something it is like\" to be a person x] ) is conceivable (i.e., it is not knowable a priori that PTI and not Q is false).\n\nP2) If PTI and not Q is conceivable, then PTI and not Q is metaphysically possible.\n\nP3) If PTI and not Q is metaphysically possible then physicalism is false.\n\nC) Physicalism is false.\n\nHere proposition P3 is a direct application of the supervenience of consciousness, and hence of any supervenience-based version of physicalism: If PTI and not Q is possible, there is some possible world where it is true. This world differs from [the relevant indexing on] our world, where PTIQ is true. But the other world is a minimal physical duplicate of our world, because PT is true there. So there is a possible world which is a minimal physical duplicate of our world, but not a full duplicate; this contradicts the definition of physicalism that we saw above.\n\nSince a priori physicalists hold that PTI → N is a priori, they are committed to denying P1) of the conceivability argument. The a priori physicalist, then, must argue that PTI and not Q, on ideal rational reflection, is incoherent or contradictory.\n\nA posteriori physicalists, on the other hand, generally accept P1) but deny P2)--the move from \"conceivability to metaphysical possibility\". Some a posteriori physicalists think that unlike the possession of most, if not all other empirical concepts, the possession of consciousness has the special property that the presence of PTI and the absence of consciousness will be conceivable—even though, according to them, it is knowable a posteriori that PTI and not Q is not metaphysically possible. These a posteriori physicalists endorse some version of what Daniel Stoljar (2005) has called \"the phenomenal concept strategy\". Roughly speaking, the phenomenal concept strategy is a label for those a posteriori physicalists who attempt to show that it is only the \"concept\" of consciousness—not the \"property\"—that is in some way \"special\" or sui generis. Other a posteriori physicalists eschew the phenomenal concept strategy, and argue that even ordinary macroscopic truths such as \"water covers 60% of the earth's surface\" are not knowable a priori from PTI and a non-deferential grasp of the concepts \"water\" and \"earth\" \"et cetera\". If this is correct, then we should (arguably) conclude that conceivability does not entail metaphysical possibility, and P2) of the conceivability argument against physicalism is false.\n\nGalen Strawson's \"realistic physicalism\" (or \"realistic monism\") entails panpsychism – or at least micropsychism. Strawson argues that \"many—perhaps most—of those who call themselves physicalists or materialists [are mistakenly] committed to the thesis that physical stuff is, in itself, in its fundamental nature, something wholly and utterly non-experiential... even when they are prepared to admit with Eddington that physical stuff has, in itself, 'a nature capable of manifesting itself as mental activity', i.e. as experience or consciousness\". Because experiential phenomena allegedly cannot be emergent from wholly non-experiential phenomena, philosophers are driven to substance dualism, property dualism, eliminative materialism and \"all other crazy attempts at wholesale mental-to-non-mental reduction\".\n\n\n"}
{"id": "74154", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=74154", "title": "Poison Ivy (character)", "text": "Poison Ivy (character)\n\nPoison Ivy is a fictional supervillain, appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics, commonly in association with the superhero Batman. Created by Robert Kanigher and Sheldon Moldoff, the character made her debut in \"Batman\" #181 (June 1966). \n\nPoison Ivy, whose real name is Pamela Lillian Isley (), has been portrayed as a love interest of Batman and is known for her infatuation with him. As a Gotham City botanist obsessed with plants, ecological extinction, and environmentalism, Ivy typically wears a green one-piece outfit adorned with leaves and often has plant vines extending over her limbs and uses plant toxins and mind-controlling pheromones for her criminal activities, which are usually aimed at protecting endangered species and the natural environment. She was originally characterized as a supervillain, but as of the New 52 and DC Rebirth, she has periodically been depicted as an antiheroine, often doing the wrong things for the right reasons.\n\nOne of the world's most notorious eco-terrorists, Poison Ivy is one of Batman's most enduring enemies and belongs to the collective of adversaries who make up Batman's rogues gallery, and has has been featured in many media adaptations related to Batman. Uma Thurman portrayed the character in \"Batman & Robin\" and Clare Foley, Maggie Geha and Peyton List played her in \"Gotham\". She has also been voiced by Diane Pershing in \"\", Piera Coppola on \"The Batman\" animated series, Tasia Valenza for the \"\" video game franchise, and Riki Lindhome in \"The Lego Batman Movie\".\n\nPoison Ivy was created by Robert Kanigher and Sheldon Moldoff, and the character first appeared in \"Batman\" #181 (June 1966). Robert Kanigher originally modeled Poison Ivy after Bettie Page, giving her the same haircut and look.\n\nThe character was partly inspired by the short story \"Rappaccini's Daughter',\" written by Nathaniel Hawthorne, about a maiden who tends a garden of poisonous plants; she becomes resistant to the poisons, but in the process she herself becomes poisonous to others. According to Octavio Paz, the sources of Hawthorne's story lie in Ancient India. In the play \"Mudrarakshasa\", one of two political rivals employs the gift of a visha kanya, a beautiful girl who is fed on poison. This theme of a woman transformed into a phial of venom is popular in Indian literature and appears in the Puranas. From India, the story passed to the West and contributed to the \"Gesta Romanorum\", among other texts. In the 17th century, Robert Burton picked up the tale in \"The Anatomy of Melancholy\" and gave it a historical character: the Indian king Porus sends Alexander the Great a girl brimming with poison.\n\nFollowing the character's initial appearance, Poison Ivy continued to appear in the various Batman comic books and had a major role in the \"Black Orchid\" miniseries. The character did not have an origin in her first appearances during the 1960s; she was merely a temptress. An origin story was later retconned for her. Poison Ivy is typically depicted with long flowing hair, plant vines extending over her neck or limbs, and a green one-piece suit adorned with leaves.\n\nDr. Lillian Rose, PhD is a promising botanist who is persuaded by Marc LeGrande into assisting him with the theft of an Egyptian artifact containing ancient herbs. Fearing she would implicate him in the theft, he attempts to poison her with the herbs, which are deadly and untraceable. She survives this murder attempt and discovers she has acquired an immunity to all natural toxins and diseases.\n\nFollowing the events of the DC maxi-series comic \"Crisis on Infinite Earths\", which massively retconned DC Universe history and continuity, Poison Ivy's origins were revised in \"Secret Origins\" #36, 1988, written by Neil Gaiman. Poison Ivy's real name is Dr. Pamela Lillian Isley, PhD, a Gotham City botanist. She grows up wealthy with emotionally distant parents and later studies advanced botanical biochemistry at a university with Alec Holland under Dr. Jason Woodrue. Isley, a shy girl, is easily seduced by her professor. Woodrue injects Isley with poisons and toxins as an experiment, causing her transformation. She nearly dies twice as a result of these poisonings, driving her insane. Later, Woodrue flees from the authorities leaving Isley in the hospital for six months. Enraged at the betrayal, she suffers from violent mood swings, being sweet one moment and evil the next. When her boyfriend has a car accident after mysteriously suffering from a massive fungal overgrowth, Isley drops out of school and leaves Seattle, eventually settling in Gotham City.\n\nShe begins her criminal career by threatening to release her suffocating spores into the air unless the city meets her demands. Batman, who appears in Gotham that very same year, thwarts her scheme, and she is incarcerated in Arkham Asylum. From this point on, she has a kind of obsession with Batman, he being the only person she could not control. Over the years, she develops plant-like superpowers, the most noticeable being a lethal toxin in her lips; she is literally able to kill with a kiss.\n\nIn subsequent issues, she states that she only started a life of crime to attain sufficient funds to find a location to be alone with her plants, undisturbed by humanity. A few years later, she attempts to leave Gotham forever, escaping Arkham to settle on a desert island in the Caribbean. She transforms the barren wasteland into a second Eden, and is, for the first time in her life, happy. It is soon firebombed, however, when an American-owned corporation tests their weapons systems out on what they think is an abandoned island. Ivy returns to Gotham with a vengeance, punishing those responsible. After being willingly apprehended by Batman, she resolves that she can never leave Gotham, at least not until the world was safe for plants. From then on, she dedicates herself to the impossible mission of \"purifying\" Gotham.\n\nAt one point, Batman travels to Seattle to ascertain information on Pamela Isley's life before she became Poison Ivy. Here, Batman states that both of Pamela's parents are dead. When and why they died has been left undetermined.\n\nWhile in Arkham, Poison Ivy receives a message through flowers that someone is to help her escape. That night, two women, Holly and Eva, successfully break Ivy out and bring her back to their employer. She is less than happy to discover that it is the Floronic Man, formerly known as Dr. Jason Woodrue, her former college professor that conducted the experiments on her. The only human portion of him remaining is his head, while the rest of his body is plant-based.\n\nAfter striking a deal with him in the underground tunnels of Gotham, Ivy receives a trunk full of money in return for samples of her DNA. Woodrue intends to combine their DNA to create a \"child\", all while flooding the streets of Gotham with high-grade marijuana. The purpose of this is to create a world economy run on hemp and to have their offspring control it. Batman intervenes, but is overcome by Woodrue's henchwomen, Holly and Eva. However, Ivy turns on Floronic Man and lets Batman go to fight the intoxicated maniac. In the end, Batman decapitates the Floronic Man, and Ivy escapes with her money.\n\nAt times, Ivy demonstrates positive and maternal traits. When Gotham City is destroyed in an earthquake, rather than fight over territory like most of Batman's enemies, she holds dominion over Robinson Park and turns it into a tropical paradise. Sixteen children who are orphaned during the quake come to live with her as she sympathizes with them having suffered a traumatic childhood herself. She cares for them like sons and daughters, despite her usual misanthropy.\n\nThat winter, Clayface (Basil Karlo) pays Ivy a visit, hoping to form a bargain with her. This would entail her growing fruits and vegetables, having the orphans harvest them, and him selling the produce to the highest bidder. She wants nothing to do with the plan, and she attempts to kill him with a kiss. Clayface overpowers her, however, and imprisons Ivy and the orphans for six months in a chamber under the park's lake. He feeds her salt and keeps her from the sun to weaken her. Eventually, Batman comes and discovers the imprisoned orphans and Ivy. The two agree to work together to take Karlo down. Batman battles Clayface and instructs Robin to blow up the lake bed above, allowing the rushing water to break apart the mud, effectively freeing Ivy. She fights Karlo, ensnaring him in the branches of a tree and fatally kissing him. She then proceeds to sink him down into the ground, where he becomes fertilizer for Ivy's plants. Batman, originally intending to take the orphans away from Ivy, recognizes that staying with her is what is best for them, and they remain in her care until the city is restored. Also, as part of a bargain to keep her freedom, Batman arranges it so that Ivy provides fresh produce to the starving hordes of earthquake survivors.\nSoon after, Ivy finds Harley Quinn, who had almost been murdered by the Joker, among the debris of the earthquake and nurses her back to health. The two have been best friends and partners-in-crime ever since.\n\nAfter Gotham City is reopened to the public, the city council wants to evict her from the park and send her back to Arkham Asylum, as they are uncomfortable with the thought of a \"psychotic eco-terrorist controlling the equivalent of 30-odd square blocks.\" They also mistakenly believe that the orphans in Ivy's care are hostages. The Gotham City Police Department threaten to spray the park with R.C. Sixty, a powerful herbicide that most certainly would have killed every living plant in the park, including Ivy, and more than likely do harm to the children. Ivy refuses to leave the park to the city and let them destroy the paradise she had created, so she chooses martyrdom. It is only after Rose, one of the orphans, is accidentally poisoned by Ivy that the hardened eco-terrorist surrenders herself to the authorities in order to save the girl's life. Batman says that, as much as she would hate to admit it, Ivy is still more human than plant.\n\nLater on, she and other Gotham characters are manipulated by the Riddler and Hush. Her task is to hypnotize both Superman and Catwoman, using Catwoman to steal ransom money from Killer Croc after the original plan is interrupted by Batman while Superman serves as a 'bodyguard' when she hides in Metropolis. However, she abandons Catwoman to be killed by Killer Croc, and Batman is able to keep Superman busy in a fight (aided by the Kryptonite ring he was given long ago) long enough for the Man of Steel to break out of the spell. Soon afterwards, the Riddler, who is being chased and attacked by Hush, approaches Ivy and seeks her protection. Ivy, who is angered by the manipulation, battles the Riddler physically and psychologically. She comes to physically dominate her opponent, humiliating Riddler and temporarily breaking his spirit.\n\nPoison Ivy comes to believe that her powers are killing the children she had looked after, so she seeks Bruce Wayne's help to reverse her powers and make her a normal human being once more. Soon after, she is convinced by Hush to take another serum to restore her powers and apparently dies in the process. However, in \"Batman: Gotham Knights\", when her grave is visited shortly thereafter, it is covered with ivy, creating the impression her death would be short-lived.\n\nShortly after, Poison Ivy appears briefly in Robinson Park, killing two corrupt cops who killed one of her orphans (although whether this takes place before or after the aforementioned storyline is unknown).\n\n\"One Year Later\", Ivy is alive and active. Her control over flora has increased, referred to as being on a par with Swamp Thing or Floronic Man. She also appears to have resumed her crusade against the corporate enemies of the environment with a new fanaticism, regarding Batman no longer as a main opponent, but as a \"hindrance\". After arriving back from a year-long absence, Batman discovers that Ivy has been feeding people including \"tiresome lovers\", \"incompetent henchmen\", and those who \"returned her smile\" to a giant plant which would digest the victims slowly and painfully. She refers to these murders as a \"guilty pleasure\". In an unprecedented event, her victims' souls merge with the plant, creating a botanical monster called \"Harvest\", who seeks revenge upon Poison Ivy. With the intervention of Batman however, she is saved. Poison Ivy is left in critical condition, and the whereabouts of Harvest are unknown.\n\nIn \"Countdown #37\", the Pied Piper and the Trickster are hiding out in a greenhouse, picking fruits and vegetables from the plants. They run into Ivy, who is talking to her plants (presumably being told that Piper and Trickster hurt them), to which she reacts by tying them up in vines with the intention of killing them. She is then shown to have joined the Injustice League Unlimited and is one of the villains featured in \"Salvation Run\".\n\nIn the \"Battle for the Cowl\" storyline, she is coerced by a new Black Mask into joining his group of villains that aims to take over Gotham. She and Killer Croc unsuccessfully attempt to murder Damian Wayne.\n\nShortly after, she escapes from Black Mask's control and forms an alliance with Catwoman and Harley Quinn, leading into the ongoing series \"Gotham City Sirens\".\n\nDuring Hush's ploy to hurt Batman through hurting his loved ones, Hush kidnaps Catwoman and surgically removes her heart. After being saved by Batman, she is operated on by some of the most gifted surgeons in the world, including Doctor Mid-Nite and Mr. Terrific. Zatanna also gives her a magic antidote to help heal her wounds. In order to get even with Hush, Selina enlists the help of Poison Ivy, Harley Quinn, Oracle, Holly Robinson, and Slam Bradley to track down all of Hush's accounts, pilfer them, and leave him penniless. Selina pays Holly, Harley, and Ivy over $30 million each, hoping that they would use the funds to leave Gotham to start fresh somewhere else.\nHowever, Harley uses her money to go on a shopping spree, while Ivy gives her money away to organizations in Madagascar and Costa Rica for reforestation.\n\nAfter rescuing Catwoman from Boneblaster, a new villain trying to make a name for himself, Poison Ivy takes Catwoman back to Edward Nigma's townhouse. When there, Catwoman sees that Ivy has been keeping the Riddler under mind control so that she and Harley could use his townhouse as a hideout. Here, Catwoman decides that with Gotham City more dangerous than ever with all the gang wars and a new Batman, a partnership with the other two women would be advantageous. However, Ivy fears that Catwoman has lost her edge and prowess, and consults with Zatanna on the nature of Catwoman's injuries. Zatanna responds that Catwoman has psychological wounds that would need healing. Ivy resolves that she and Harley would provide Catwoman with \"positive female reinforcement\". The three then agree to become a team. However, Harley and Ivy have one condition that Catwoman is to reveal to them the true identity of Batman.\n\nEventually, Ivy and the other Sirens ambush the Riddler at his office (with Ivy using her plants to trust and gag his secretary), telling him that they've been framed for the murder of a young nurse. He agrees to help clear their names, and during the discussion Ivy reveals that she has recently taken up a job at the Gotham division of S.T.A.R. Labs under an assumed name (Dr. Paula Irving). She is eventually kidnapped and placed in a specialized containment unit by a researcher named Alisa Adams, but escapes and turns the table on her captor by binding her with vines. Ivy initially informs Adams that she plans to kill her, but instead decides to let her live after seeing a photograph of Alisa's young daughter. Ivy then threatens Alisa into keeping her mouth shut about her true identity, telling her that she will change her mind and kill her if she reveals her secret to anyone.\n\nWhen Harley Quinn betrays her friends and breaks into Arkham Asylum with the goal of killing the Joker, she ultimately chooses instead to release Joker from his cell, and together the two orchestrate a violent takeover of the facility. Poison Ivy arrives and tries to convince Harley Quinn that the Joker is evil, but Harley Quinn refuses to believe her and knocks Poison Ivy unconscious. After they are defeated by Catwoman and Batman, Catwoman then tells Poison Ivy that they are no longer friends, after Ivy had drugged Catwoman in an attempt to discover Batman's identity. Poison Ivy is taken in Arkham Asylum. Ivy soon escapes and ambushes Harley in her cell, binding and gagging her former friend before she can defend herself. Ivy struggles with the decision to execute Harley for her betrayal, but ultimately releases her after realizing that she is still her friend. Together, the two set off to find Catwoman and make her pay for leaving them behind. The two of them find Catwoman and fight her on the streets. While fighting, Catwoman confesses that she saw good in the both of them and only wanted to help them. When she tells them that she only kept tabs on them because Batman wanted to keep them under control, Ivy lashes out onto the city by using giant vines to destroy buildings, cursing at Batman for manipulating her. Batman is about to arrest them, but Catwoman helps the two of them escape.\n\nIn The New 52 (the 2011 reboot of the DC Comics universe), Poison Ivy is recruited into the covert-ops group known as the Birds of Prey. Though she is specifically hand-picked by the team's leader Black Canary, the other members of the group protest Ivy's inclusion, citing her violent past and connections to various murders. These suspicions are proven correct when Ivy poisons the team and forces them to attack corrupt companies she wants to destroy until Katana apparently kills her.\n\nIvy survives the injuries and returns to Gotham, breaking out Clayface/Basil Karlo in order to manipulate him into becoming her husband. Batman intervenes to help her, mainly because the locations she attacked were the Penguin's properties. Poison Ivy ends up captured by Penguin's men. She is buried alive by them, but survives long enough to be rescued by Penguin's right-hand man Emperor Penguin who has taken over his boss' businesses after the Joker's return. He proposes an alliance with her. However, Karlo, who Batman had set free from Ivy's control, tracks down and attacks Poison Ivy.\n\nThe character's origin, in this new DC universe, was presented in a special issue of \"Detective Comics\" (#23.1), during the \"Villains Month\" event in September 2013.\n\nIn this timeline of The New 52, Pamela Isley was born with a skin condition that prevented her from leaving her home. The garden was the place where she spent most of her limited time outside. Her father constantly beat her mother until he finally murdered her and buried her in the garden. While in college, Pamela sold pheromone pills to other students to study its effects until she was caught by police. She used a powerful version of the pills to mind-control the dean so he would drop the charges and let her graduate from college with honors. While visiting her father in prison, she kissed him with a poison that was secreted from her lips that killed him.\n\nLater she landed an internship in Wayne Enterprises in its Bio-Chemistry division developing pharmaceutical and cosmetic applications. She was fired after proposing Bruce Wayne to develop chemicals that could brainwash people by triggering social or behavioral responses from them. As she was escorted out by security, she accidentally spilled the chemicals she was working with on herself, giving her powers to control plant life and immunity to all poisons and viruses.\n\nIn January 2016, DC Comics debuted Ivy's first six-issue miniseries, \"\". As Dr. Pamela Isley, PhD, she joins the prestigious plant sciences department at Gotham Botanical Gardens, but things quickly get complicated when Luisa Cruz, Ivy's friend and mentor, is murdered via poisoning. Ivy investigates whilst working on her latest project, successfully giving life to two children who are plant-human hybrids like herself, as well as her biological daughters. Ivy names them Rose and Hazel.\n\nWith the help of Selina Kyle and fellow researcher, Darshan, she finds that the Gotham Botanical Gardens were performing experiments which resulted in creating another plant-human hybrid named Thorn. Ivy destroys the laboratory and rescues the child. Ivy raises Rose, Hazel and Thorn who grow to adult size at an exponential rate, becoming young women within 35 weeks. When the girls sneak out to see Gotham City at night for the first time, they cause an incident at a strip club that gets the police involved and Ivy has to help them escape.\n\nReturning to the apartment, Ivy locks Rose, Hazel and Thorn away so they will not leave again. Ivy finds Doctor Eric Grimley - Chair of the Gotham Botanical Gardens Research Department - waiting on her balcony and he attacks her. Grimley had transformed himself into a large plant-like monster to escape dying from cancer. Grimley murdered Luisa because she was suspicious of the experiments he was performing and now, with his cancer returning, intends to harvest Rose, Thorn, and Hazel for spores to help escape death again.\n\nDarshan arrives and releases the girls, who help Ivy fight Grimley along with Swamp Thing - who seeks to punish Grimley for wanting to defy nature by escaping the cycle of life and death. Together they defeat Grimley, with Thorn hacking him up with a machete for the experiments she was put through.\n\nDarshan later helps Rose, Thorn, and Hazel leave Ivy, reasoning that they were getting so restless they'd go eventually with or without his help, and they set off away from Gotham to places unknown, claiming they planned to live out their lives regardless of how short they may be.\n\nDC Comics began the next relaunch of its entire line of titles called DC Rebirth in June 2016. DC opted to rebrand its titles under the \"DC Universe\" name in December 2017, using the continuity established from DC Rebirth. Within the DC Universe, Poison Ivy appears in the first story arc of \"Trinity\" vol. 2 (issues 1-6), trying to create a portal between a dream world inhabited by an entity of the Green called White Mercy which is related to the Black Mercy plant. She builds the portal at an old shed at Clark Kent's farmhouse but doesn't realise that Diana, Clark and Bruce Wayne are actually the Trinity. It is later revealed that this is a plan orchestrated by Mongul trying to conquer Earth using Superman as a vessel. With the help of Poison Ivy and the White Mercy entity, Mongul is stopped, but Poison Ivy loses her memories of this incident.\n\nShe later appears in \"Batgirl\" #6 where she teams up with Batgirl to save an airplane and its passengers from a plant that is growing uncontrollably in the cargo bay. It is hinted that she knows Batgirl's true identity, but decides to keep it a secret. Poison Ivy is also a recurrent character in the \"Harley Quinn\" series and Harley's main love interest, though the two are not exclusive.\n\nIn \"All Star Batman\" #7 Batman is asking for Poison Ivy's help as a scientist so he can stop a deadly virus that is threatening to destroy the planet. After helping him and manufacturing the cure, Batman promises to clear her name.\n\nPoison Ivy appears in \"The War of Jokes and Riddles\" story arc of \"Batman\", where she allied herself with the Riddler in his war against the Joker. In the arc, when the Riddler was trying to convince her to join his side, she is seen stopping Carmine Falcone's men—who are sent to kill the Riddler—by capturing them in vines.\n\nPoison Ivy appears in the \"Gotham Resistance\" tie-in story arc for \"\", where she controls a jungle-like realm within a Gotham City warped by the dark energy emitted from the dark metal in the cards given by the Batman Who Laughs to various enemies of Batman including Poison Ivy herself. Poison Ivy captures Harley Quinn—who realizes that Poison Ivy isn't herself—Green Arrow, Nightwing, Robin, and Killer Croc as they try to solve what's going on and stop it. They manage to escape when Poison Ivy violently reacts to her plants being harmed during an attack by several members of the Teen Titans and Suicide Squad, who all also have been twisted, as well as a Dark Robin.\n\nIn the \"Source Code\" story arc of \"Batgirl and the Birds of Prey\", Poison Ivy has infiltrated and was trying to take down Terracare, a company whose fertilizers had a secret ingredient destructive to bee populations. She comes across the Birds of Prey—Huntress, Black Canary, and Batgirl—and Catwoman who were trying to save the Calculator's family held hostage by Terracare. Earlier, Terracare had traced back a data breach to the Calculator—who sold the information to Catwoman, which she used to steal a vial of the ingredient from Terracare for Poison Ivy—so the company demanded the return of their stolen items in exchange for his family. After they stopped those responsible at Terracare, Batgirl arranges that Poison Ivy becomes the chemist in charge of the fertilizers. After this arc, Poison Ivy is occasionally seen working at Terracare or helping the Birds of Prey against villains, such as the Daughters of Gotham or the Calculator.\n\nIn the \"Unnatural Disaster\" storyline of \"Damage\", Poison Ivy has fallen under the influence of forces that led to a desire to destroy humanity. She partnered with Gorilla Grodd for that intend. They fought against Damage (Ethan Avery) who is trying to protect people from them. However, Poison Ivy eventually resists the control of these forces, as she thinks that people are worth saving and doesn't want to be a killer. At the end, Swamp Thing (Alec Holland) reveals to Ethan Avery that the Green is trying to change Poison Ivy but hasn't succeeded.\n\n\"Batman\" #41–43 features a Poison Ivy arc titled \"Everyone Loves Ivy\". Fueled by her guilt over the men she thought she killed in \"The War of Jokes and Riddles\", Poison Ivy uses her powers to take control of everyone on earth, except Batman and Catwoman. With the help of Harley Quinn, Batman and Catwoman convince Poison Ivy to release the world from her control. At the end of arc, Poison Ivy enters a facility known as the Sanctuary for rehabilitation.\n\nIn \"Heroes in Crisis\", at the mental health institution Sanctuary, Poison Ivy is seen giving a confession in which she states that she shouldn't be there because they are made for heroes and she is a terrorist. Earlier, Harley Quinn had told Poison Ivy to go to Sanctuary and followed her there. In the aftermath of several murders at Sanctuary, Booster Gold seeks out the Flash (Barry Allen) in his effort to solve the situation. He explains to him that either Harley or maybe he himself killed everyone, mentioning \"Ivy\" and a few other names of those killed. In contrast, Harley Quinn is convinced that Booster Gold had killed those people and lets herself be found by Batman, Superman, and Wonder Woman to reveal this to them before escaping. Later, while standing on a bridge, Harley Quinn regretfully reflects upon Poison Ivy as she drops a red rose into the water.\n\n\"Harley Quinn\" features Ivy several times first as Harley's best friend and then lover. Ivy has helped Harley out on several adventures between her ecological terrorism gigs back in Harley's new home on Coney Island. She helps Harley explain to the local assassins that Harley posted her own bounty while sleepwalking and that trying to kill her would just lead to their deaths and no pay day. Harley rescued her from a super villain's mind control while Ivy was secretly held prisoner and used by said villain in Arkham. She assisted in hiring the Gang of Harleys and nursing Harley back to health when Captain Strong's mutant possibly alien seaweed put her in the hospital. She and Catwoman joined Harley on a road trip when Harley's uncle died and found that while both she and Harley are immune to most toxins, that does not include some secret drink brewed up on an Indian reservation. She and Harley were invited to spend a romantic week in Bermuda on a nudist colony by Sy Borgman. When there was a dispute over some real-estate Ivy helped turn it into protected swampland. Also when Penguin attacked new York with giant killer penguins she helped out by growing a giant daisy in what their friend Eggy called the worst Kaiju fight ever.\n\nIvy calls herself an \"eco-terrorist of global importance\" and has demonstrated philanthropic contributions to conservation efforts. A Gotham Girls episode \"Pave Paradise\" has her going out of her way to get Gotham's mayor to prevent bulldozing of a park because he swore he would not do it in his election campaign. In \"Gotham City Sirens\", Ivy reveals that she donated her $30 million share of Hush's money to a reforestation fund.\n\nThe experiments that transformed Dr. Isley introduced a mixture of several potent toxins originating from a selection of venomous predators and poisonous plant life into her bloodstream to act as a mutagen; making her touch deadly while also giving her a superhuman immune system. This immunity also extends to synthetic toxins such as Joker venom. Some versions of the character show her as more plant than human, such as breathing carbon dioxide and undergoing photosynthesis as well as having a more plantlike appearance with aloe blood and chlorophyll skin.\n\nPoison Ivy's body produces pheromones that make people susceptible to mind control around her, especially men, although strong-minded people like Batman are usually capable of resisting. She specializes in hybrids and can create the most potent floral toxins in Gotham City, ranging from truth serums and love potions. Often these toxins are secreted from her lips and administered in her preferred way, a poisonous kiss, usually after professing false love or affection for her victim. They come in a number of varieties, from mind-controlling drugs to instantly fatal toxins.\n\nShe has the ability to mentally control all forms of plant life on a molecular level. This plant growth can occur in an instant, allowing her to use plants in the environment to attack or ensnare her opponents, and even to create powerful new plant hybrids for specialized purposes. In volume three of \"Batman\", she causes giant plant roots to become uprooted at a moment's notice, and directs the roots to entangle her enemies. While in Arkham Asylum, she manipulates and animates plants, using roots to form supports for a tunnel she and another inmate named Magpie dig to escape, and also spawning glowing fungi to entertain Magpie. Plant vines are also commonly seen extending over her limbs and neck, creating part of her overall appearance. She controlled an entire tree to come down on Clayface, ensnaring him in its branches, and once brought a whole skyscraper down with giant vines.\n\nPoison Ivy is identified by the Swamp Thing as a being with an elemental mystical component, whom he calls the \"May Queen\". Writers have not referred to her in this way in quite some time. She has shown an ability to use the Green, a force connected to plant life. Ivy is able to communicate over great distances with this talent, as she manifests in a vase of roses in Zatanna's dressing room to talk to the magician.\n\nThe character carries a certain number of live vines: coupled with her natural ability to commune with plant life, they act as weaponry, or defensive/grabbing appendages. Their supply is, however, limited.\n\nBeyond her metahuman traits, Ivy is shown to be exceptionally physically fit both due to gymnastics and her enhanced health; being both similar to Harley Quinn in skill as well as showing enough hand-to-hand combat prowess to challenge Batman without relying solely on her powers.\n\nAlthough Poison Ivy has been historically portrayed as a supervillainess, Batman and Poison Ivy have worked together in achieving common goals and are frequently depicted as having a romantic relationship. While not at the same level as his relationship with Catwoman, Batman's attraction to Ivy is present in some way. \n\nIn her first appearance, Poison Ivy is established as having an attraction to Batman, and tries to convince Batman to join her side and creates love potions that ensnare him. \n\nIn one of the annuals of \"\", a mutual attraction between Poison Ivy and the Batman is obvious right from the start. ]\n\nIn the 1989 story, \"Batman: Poison Ivy\", Christopher DeJardin tries to kill Ivy, and Batman takes the bullet. Batman, who was wearing body armor, knocks him out. Ivy considers his saving her from death as proof he loves her, though he responds that that she doesn't know the meaning of the word.\n\nIn \"Batman: Hothouse\" (1992), Batman gains an obsession with Isley. Later, she kisses him. Now completely deranged, Ivy thinks herself \"Titania, Queen of the May\", and Batman her Oberon - as Batman struggles with the hallucinations induced by the kiss, she pins him down and prepares to unmask him. With his last burst of strength, Batman kicks the greenhouse's sprinklers on, washing away Ivy's pheromones. The sobered Batman chases an increasingly desperate Ivy onto the greenhouse's catwalks, where he barely manages to save Ivy from falling to her death. Subsequently, Ivy is returned to Arkham Asylum, her twisted love for Batman stronger than ever.\n\nIn the 2004 story \"\", Batman and Ivy work together to find a killer carrying out a series of Ivy-like murders at Arkham. Batman gets poisoned by the flowers, and he has to kiss Poison Ivy for the cure. Ivy insists for him to trust her, despite Batman's doubts. Batman at first decides to punch her, hesitates, then willingly shares a kiss with her instead, curing him, but when — assuming Batman dead — Poison Ivy tries to kill herself, once more insinuating that it is more than just lust she feels for him. Later, Ivy returns to Arkham to finish her rehabilitation, but some \"anonymous benefactor\" makes sure her time there isn't as daunting as it might have been. Ivy discovers that Batman filled her cell with flowers as a gift.\n\nIn \"Gothtopia\", Batman comes to her rescue when he realizes she was telling him the truth, even though he put her in Arkham. First she punches him for not believing her claims, and then she kisses him for coming to her rescue, poisoning him with her mind control toxin. Resisting it, he warns that they would be best off helping each other for now. Thanks to her own resistance and the kiss he received, both Batman and Ivy become immune to Scarecrow's gas effect.\n\nPrior to the New 52 reboot, Ivy is sometimes shown as romantically involved with Harley Quinn. Unlike most villain team-ups, their partnership seems to be based on genuine friendship. Ivy sincerely wants to save Harley from her unhealthy abusive relationship with the Joker. Accordingly, Poison Ivy despises the Joker, and the two exchange vicious banter at every opportunity. In the final storyline of the \"Gotham City Sirens\" series, Harley suggests that Ivy may be in love with her, an accusation that stuns her. The following issue has Poison Ivy acknowledge that she may indeed love Harley, but the details of her love are never specified. \n\nIn June 2015, Poison Ivy was revealed to be bisexual by \"Harley Quinn\" series writers Jimmy Palmiotti and Amanda Conner, stating that she is in a romantic relationship with Harley \"without the jealousy of monogamy\".\n\nIn \"Harley Quinn\" #8, Harley went on a vacation with Ivy to a nudist colony in which she tried to convince Ivy to move in with her, but while Ivy admitted that she loves Harley more than any other person on Earth and would love to spend as much time with her as possible, she is currently more dedicated to saving the environment. Harley was disappointed and very sad, but accepted it and the two parted with promises to meet again.\n\nIvy teamed up on occasion with fellow villain, Harley Quinn with Harley being her close friend and recurring ally. The partnership between Harley and Ivy has also at times included Catwoman, such as in episodes and issues of the \"Gotham Girls\" webtoon and comic book series. In the mainstream DC Universe, the three formed an alliance in the pages of \"Gotham City Sirens\".\n\nPoison Ivy was invited to join the Birds of Prey by Black Canary in The New 52 continuity reboot. Katana and Starling reject the idea and even attack Ivy, but after a brief scuffle, the women begin working together as a team. She remained with the team for a time, but eventually betrayed them, shortly before the team split-up. When the Birds were reformed under the leadership of Batgirl, Poison Ivy was not invited back. \n\nPoison Ivy joins Two-Face's gang for a short period of time during \"\", when she murders crime boss Lucia Viti on Two-Face's orders. She is notably the only member of the gang to be upset by Two-Face's casual murder of fellow gang member Solomon Grundy, a plant-based entity. The gang is broken up after Two-Face's apparent death at the hands of the Joker. \n\nPoison Ivy is a member of the original Injustice Gang of the World, which fights the Justice League on several occasions.\nShe joins the Secret Society of Super Villains for a mission against the Justice League. She later joins Alexander Luthor, Jr.'s incarnation of the Society.\n\nShe is coerced into being a member of the Suicide Squad. During this time, she uses her abilities to enslave Count Vertigo.\n\nIGN's list of the Top 100 Comic Book Villains of All Time ranked Poison Ivy as #64. She was ranked 21st in \"Comics Buyer's Guide\"s \"100 Sexiest Women in Comics\" list.\n\nIn \"\", Ivy and Swamp Thing team up to mentally travel through the Green, to try and discover what exactly caused the event which wiped out almost every male on the planet. But the trip is too much for her and it shatters her mind.\n\nIn \"\", Ivy is one of the many villains whom the now vampiric Batman kills for blood, the vampire Batman's presence causing her plants to wither around him as he gives Ivy the kiss she always wanted, commenting that he could only want her while in the darkness and decay of corruption. Her head is apparently left at GCPD headquarters after her demise.\n\n\nIn \"JLA/Avengers\" #3, Poison Ivy appears as a servant of Krona and attacks Aquaman and the Vision as a part of a group of villains. Poison Ivy strangles Aquaman in vines but is blasted by Iron Man and defeated.\nPoison Ivy is featured in the \"Smallville Season 11\" digital comic based on the TV series.\n\nIn the alternate timeline of the \"Flashpoint\" event, Poison Ivy is one of the many villains subsequently killed by Batman.\n\nIn \"Batman '66\" (which is based on the 1960s TV series), Poison Ivy appears. In this continuity, Pamela Isley had botanist parents who started their own nursery called Isley Nursery and worked at a university. After her father Dr. Isley died from a toxic tropical plant, Pamela blamed the university that her father worked for as they did not bother to find an antidote for him. Upon moving back to the south with her mother, Pamela improved in her botany and became immune to the toxin that killed her father. With her new powers, she became Poison Ivy and committed crimes with her plants. Batman and Robin came across her while investigating Louie the Lilac's apparent demise.\n\nIvy appears as one of the mutated Arkham inmates in the \"Batman/Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles\" crossover. She was mutated into a praying mantis humanoid.\n\nIn the to \"\", Poison Ivy first appears in \"Chapter 21\" of Year Three, where Dick Grayson, now the new Deadman, possesses Ivy and has her drive the Batplane to the House of Mystery and House of Secrets, where Batman's Insurgency and Superman's Regime are doing battle. Before she can figure out where she is, she gets attacked by Swamp Thing as the 2 of them battle, before they stop and use their powers to save the forest from Trigon's hellfire. As Trigon and Mister Mxyzptlk's battle continues to tear reality apart, the 2 teams retreat into the respective houses, before Doctor Fate and Shazam stops them. Ivy then reappears in Year Four, where her best friend, Harley Quinn tries to convince her to commit a crime with her because she's bored, but Ivy refuses and suggests that Harley turn to someone else. Ivy then reappears in \"Ground Zero\", where Harley calls her to recruit her for her gang, the Joker Clan, but Ivy refuses until Harley can stand up to Joker and since the Regime's peace, plant life is now prospering. Ivy then reappears at the end, where she shows up at Gary's funeral, much to Harley's surprise. Ivy then tries to convince Harley that they can run away together and be free, but Harley refuses to leave her gang behind until the war between the Regime and Insurgency is over, which Ivy accepts. The two of them then share a kiss before Ivy leaves, wishing Harley good luck.\n\nIn the tie-in comic to \"Injustice 2\", one year after the Regime's fall, Poison Ivy joins Ra's al Ghul and his team for the purpose of creating a better world for The Green. The comic establishes that Ivy and Harley were a couple, and issue #70 hints that the two got married in Las Vegas.\n\nPoison Ivy has a minor appearance in the 2017 series . Ivy, along with several other Batman villains, is tricked by Jack Napier (who in this reality was a Joker who had been force fed an overdose of pills by Batman which temporarily cured him of his insanity) into drinking drinks that had been laced with particles from Clayface’s body. This was done so that Napier, who was using Mad Hatter’s technology to control Clayface, could control them by way of Clayface’s ability to control parts of his body that had been separated from him. Ivy and the other villains are then used to attack a library which Napier himself was instrumental in building in one of Gotham City’s poorer districts. Later on in the story, the control hat is stolen by Neo-Joker (the second Harley Quinn, who felt that Jack Napier was a pathetic abnormality while Joker was the true, beautiful personality), in an effort to get Napier into releasing the Joker persona.\n\n\n\n\n\nPoison Ivy has appeared in most of the Batman video games over the years. In most of these games, she does not fight Batman directly and usually watches in the background while Batman fights one of her plant monsters. She appeared as a boss in:\nShe is able to jump higher than any other character (an ability given to all female villains), increase the growth rate of particular plants, blow long-range poison kisses, and give up-close poison kisses to foes which, in turn, fall apart.\n\n\nPoison Ivy appears in the \"Batman: Arkham\" series voiced primarily by Tasia Valenza. \n\n\n\n\n\n"}

An example of a retinal-based organism today is the photosynthetic microbe collectively called halobacteria.\n\nThe difficulty with this hypothesis is that retinal-based photosynthesis requires either arginine or oxygen in the environment. As a complex amino acid, arginine is not likely to have been available in the levels needed. Oxygen only became available in earth's environment after the development of chlorophyll-based photosynthesis, and given that retinal organisms also require oxygen to synthesize critical substances for life, the possibility that retinal life-forms could have preceded chlorophyll-based ones as the most common photosynthetic organisms is unlikely.\n\n\n"}

This, his one play, is described by John Joseph Knight in the first edition of \"The Dictionary of National Biography\" as \"a work of some merit and of considerable value and rarity.\" There are no contemporary records of the play, except for its entry in the register of the Stationers' Company for 1598, and it was not reprinted until 1909.\n\n\"The Virtuous Octavia\" is modelled on Samuel Daniel's \"Cleopatra\". The plot, taken from the life of Augustus by Suetonius, and that of Mark Antony by Plutarch, follows to some extent classical models. It is set is Rome, and its catastrophe is the death of Mark Antony. The fact that at the close the heroine, who oscillates between love for her husband and jealousy of Cleopatra, is still alive, is the excuse for calling it a tragicomedy. Knight comments that though \"weak in structure and deficient in interest, the \"Virtuous Octavia\" has claims to attention as poetry.\" It is written in decasyllabic verse with rhymes to alternate lines, with choruses at the end of each act. John Payne Collier, writing in 1831, noted Brandon's innovative use of compound epithets of a type derived from ancient Greek literature, such as \"pearl-dropping showers\", \"sceptre-bearing hands\" and \"terror-breeding crown\".\n\nTwo epistles between Octavia and Mark Antony, in an imitation of Ovid's style, but written in long Alexandrines are appended to the play. These epistles are dedicated \"to the honourable, virtuous, and excellent Mrs. Mary Thin\", while the play itself is dedicated to Lady Lucia Audelay. At the close of the work are the Italian words: \"L'acqua non temo dell'eterno oblio\", a phrase described in the play's entry in the \"Biographia Dramatica\" (1812) as \"an instance among many of the vanity of authors, who flatter themselves into an imaginary immortality, which frequently terminates even before the close of their mortal existence, much less extends beyond it\".\n"}

{"id": "4044299", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4044299", "title": "Spin–charge separation", "text": "Spin–charge separation\n\nIn condensed matter physics, spin–charge separation is an unusual behavior of electrons in some materials in which they 'split' into three independent particles, the spinon, the orbiton and the holon (or chargon). The electron can always be theoretically considered as a bound state of the three, with the spinon carrying the spin of the electron, the orbiton carrying the orbital degree of freedom and the chargon carrying the charge, but in certain conditions they can become deconfined and behave as independent particles.\n\nThe theory of spin–charge separation originates with the work of Sin-Itiro Tomonaga who developed an approximate method for treating one-dimensional interacting quantum systems in 1950. This was then developed by Joaquin Mazdak Luttinger in 1963 with an exactly solvable model which demonstrated spin–charge separation. In 1981 F. Duncan M. Haldane generalized Luttinger's model to the Tomonaga–Luttinger liquid concept whereby the physics of Luttinger's model was shown theoretically to be a general feature of all one-dimensional metallic systems. Although Haldane treated spinless fermions, the extension to spin-½ fermions and associated spin–charge separation was clear so that the promised follow-up paper did not appear.\n\nSpin–charge separation is one of the most unusual manifestations of the concept of quasiparticles. This property is counterintuitive, because neither the spinon, with zero charge and spin half, nor the chargon, with charge minus one and zero spin, can be constructed as combinations of the electrons, holes, phonons and photons that are the constituents of the system. It is an example of fractionalization, the phenomenon in which the quantum numbers of the quasiparticles are not multiples of those of the elementary particles, but fractions.\n\nSince the original electrons in the system are fermions, one of the spinon and chargon has to be a fermion, and the other one has to be a boson. One is theoretically free to make the assignment in either way, and no observable quantity can depend on this choice. The formalism with bosonic chargon and fermionic spinon is usually referred to as the \"slave-fermion\" formalism, while the formalism with fermionic chargon and bosonic spinon is called the \"Schwinger boson\" formalism. Both approaches have been used for strongly correlated systems, but neither has been proved to be completely successful. One difficulty of the spin–charge separation is that while spinon and chargon are not gauge-invariant quantities, i.e. unphysical objects, there are no direct physical probes to observe them. Therefore more often than not one has to use thermal dynamical or macroscopic techniques to see their effects. This implies that which formalism we choose is irrelevant to real physics, so in principle both approaches should give us the same answer. The reason we obtain radically different answers from these two formalisms is probably because of the wrong mean field solution we choose, which means that we are dealing with the spin–charge separation in a wrong way.\n\nThe same theoretical ideas have been applied in the framework of ultracold atoms. In a two-component Bose gas in 1D, strong interactions can produce a maximal form of spin–charge separation.\n\nBuilding on physicist F. Duncan M. Haldane's 1981 theory, experts from the Universities of Cambridge and Birmingham proved experimentally in 2009 that a mass of electrons artificially confined in a small space together will split into spinons and holons due to the intensity of their mutual repulsion (from having the same charge). A team of researchers working at the Advanced Light Source (ALS) of the U.S. Department of Energy’s Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory also observed peak spectral structures of spin–charge separation around the same time.\n\n"}

Research is underway to develop various sources for stem cells, as well as to apply stem-cell treatments for neurodegenerative diseases and conditions such as diabetes and heart disease, among others.\n\nStem-cell therapy has become controversial following developments such as the ability of scientists to isolate and culture embryonic stem cells, to create stem cells using somatic cell nuclear transfer and their use of techniques to create induced pluripotent stem cells. This controversy is often related to abortion politics and to human cloning. Additionally, efforts to market treatments based on transplant of stored umbilical cord blood have been controversial.\n\nFor over 30 years, bone marrow has been used to treat people with cancer with conditions such as leukaemia and lymphoma; this is the only form of stem-cell therapy that is widely practiced. During chemotherapy, most growing cells are killed by the cytotoxic agents. These agents, however, cannot discriminate between the leukaemia or neoplastic cells, and the hematopoietic stem cells within the bone marrow. It is this side effect of conventional chemotherapy strategies that the stem-cell transplant attempts to reverse; a donor's healthy bone marrow reintroduces functional stem cells to replace the cells lost in the host's body during treatment. The transplanted cells also generate an immune response that helps to kill off the cancer cells; this process can go too far, however, leading to graft vs host disease, the most serious side effect of this treatment.\n\nAnother stem-cell therapy called Prochymal, was conditionally approved in Canada in 2012 for the management of acute graft-vs-host disease in children who are unresponsive to steroids. It is an allogenic stem therapy based on mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) derived from the bone marrow of adult donors. MSCs are purified from the marrow, cultured and packaged, with up to 10,000 doses derived from a single donor. The doses are stored frozen until needed.\n\nThe FDA has approved five hematopoietic stem-cell products derived from umbilical cord blood, for the treatment of blood and immunological diseases.\n\nIn 2014, the European Medicines Agency recommended approval of limbal stem cells for people with severe limbal stem cell deficiency due to burns in the eye.\n\nStem cells are being studied for a number of reasons. The molecules and exosomes released from stem cells are also being studied in an effort to make medications. The paracrine soluble factors produced by stem cells, known as the stem cell secretome, has been found to be the predominant mechanism by which stem cell-based therapies mediate their effects in degenerative, auto-immune and inflammatory diseases.\n\nResearch has been conducted on the effects of stem cells on animal models of brain degeneration, such as in Parkinson's, Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and Alzheimer's disease. There have been preliminary studies related to multiple sclerosis.\n\nHealthy adult brains contain neural stem cells which divide to maintain general stem-cell numbers, or become progenitor cells. In healthy adult laboratory animals, progenitor cells migrate within the brain and function primarily to maintain neuron populations for olfaction (the sense of smell). Pharmacological activation of endogenous neural stem cells has been reported to induce neuroprotection and behavioral recovery in adult rat models of neurological disorder.\n\nStroke and traumatic brain injury lead to cell death, characterized by a loss of neurons and oligodendrocytes within the brain. Clinical and animal studies have been conducted into the use of stem cells in cases of spinal cord injury.\n\nStem cells are studied in people with severe heart disease. The work by Bodo-Eckehard Strauer was discredited by identifying hundreds of factual contradictions. Among several clinical trials reporting that adult stem cell therapy is safe and effective, actual evidence of benefit has been reported from only a few studies. Some preliminary clinical trials achieved only modest improvements in heart function following use of bone marrow stem cell therapy.\n\nStem-cell therapy for treatment of myocardial infarction usually makes use of autologous bone marrow stem cells, but other types of adult stem cells may be used, such as adipose-derived stem cells.\n\nPossible mechanisms of recovery include:\n\nIn 2013, studies of autologous bone marrow stem cells on ventricular function were found to contain \"hundreds\" of discrepancies. Critics report that of 48 reports there seemed to be just five underlying trials, and that in many cases whether they were randomized or merely observational accepter-versus-rejecter, was contradictory between reports of the same trial. One pair of reports of identical baseline characteristics and final results, was presented in two publications as, respectively, a 578 patient randomized trial and as a 391 subject observational study. Other reports required (impossible) negative standard deviations in subsets of people, or contained fractional subjects, negative NYHA classes. Overall there were many more people published as having receiving stem cells in trials, than the number of stem cells processed in the hospital's laboratory during that time. A university investigation, closed in 2012 without reporting, was reopened in July 2013.\n\nIn 2014, a meta-analysis on stem cell therapy using bone marrow stem cells for heart disease revealed discrepancies in published clinical trial reports, whereby studies with a higher number of discrepancies showed an increase in effect sizes. Another meta-analysis based on the intra-subject data of 12 randomized trials was unable to find any significant benefits of stem cell therapy on primary endpoints, such as major adverse events or increase in heart function measures, concluding there was no benefit.\n\nThe TIME trial, which used a randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled trial design, concluded that \"bone marrow mononuclear cells administration did not improve recovery of LV function over 2 years\" in people who had a myocardial infarction. Accordingly, the BOOST-2 trial conducted in 10 medical centers in Germany and Norway reported that the trial result \"does not support the use of nucleated BMCs in patients with STEMI and moderately reduced LVEF\". Furthermore, the trial also did not meet any other secondary MRI endpoints, leading to a conclusion that intracoronary bone marrow stem cell therapy does not offer a functional or clinical benefit.\n\nThe specificity of the human immune-cell repertoire is what allows the human body to defend itself from rapidly adapting antigens. However, the immune system is vulnerable to degradation upon the pathogenesis of disease, and because of the critical role that it plays in overall defense, its degradation is often fatal to the organism as a whole. Diseases of hematopoietic cells are diagnosed and classified via a subspecialty of pathology known as hematopathology. The specificity of the immune cells is what allows recognition of foreign antigens, causing further challenges in the treatment of immune disease. Identical matches between donor and recipient must be made for successful transplantation treatments, but matches are uncommon, even between first-degree relatives. Research using both hematopoietic adult stem cells and embryonic stem cells has provided insight into the possible mechanisms and methods of treatment for many of these ailments.\n\nFully mature human red blood cells may be generated \"ex vivo\" by hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), which are precursors of red blood cells. In this process, HSCs are grown together with stromal cells, creating an environment that mimics the conditions of bone marrow, the natural site of red-blood-cell growth. Erythropoietin, a growth factor, is added, coaxing the stem cells to complete terminal differentiation into red blood cells. Further research into this technique should have potential benefits to gene therapy, blood transfusion, and topical medicine.\n\nIn 2004, scientists at King's College London discovered a way to cultivate a complete tooth in mice and were able to grow bioengineered teeth stand-alone in the laboratory. Researchers are confident that the tooth regeneration technology can be used to grow live teeth in people. \n\nIn theory, stem cells taken from the patient could be coaxed in the lab turning into a tooth bud which, when implanted in the gums, will give rise to a new tooth, and would be expected to be grown in a time over three weeks. It will fuse with the jawbone and release chemicals that encourage nerves and blood vessels to connect with it. The process is similar to what happens when humans grow their original adult teeth. Many challenges remain, however, before stem cells could be a choice for the replacement of missing teeth in the future.\n\nHeller has reported success in re-growing cochlea hair cells with the use of embryonic stem cells.\n\nSince 2003, researchers have successfully transplanted corneal stem cells into damaged eyes to restore vision. \"Sheets of retinal cells used by the team are harvested from aborted fetuses, which some people find objectionable.\" When these sheets are transplanted over the damaged cornea, the stem cells stimulate renewed repair, eventually restore vision. The latest such development was in June 2005, when researchers at the Queen Victoria Hospital of Sussex, England were able to restore the sight of forty people using the same technique. The group, led by Sheraz Daya, was able to successfully use adult stem cells obtained from the patient, a relative, or even a cadaver. Further rounds of trials are ongoing.\n\nPeople with Type 1 diabetes lose the function of insulin-producing beta cells within the pancreas. In recent experiments, scientists have been able to coax embryonic stem cell to turn into beta cells in the lab. In theory if the beta cell is transplanted successfully, they will be able to replace malfunctioning ones in a diabetic patient.\n\nUse of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) derived from adult stem cells is under preliminary research for potential orthopedic applications in bone and muscle trauma, cartilage repair, osteoarthritis, intervertebral disc surgery, rotator cuff surgery, and musculoskeletal disorders, among others. Other areas of orthopedic research for uses of MSCs include tissue engineering and regenerative medicine.\n\nStem cells can also be used to stimulate the growth of human tissues. In an adult, wounded tissue is most often replaced by scar tissue, which is characterized in the skin by disorganized collagen structure, loss of hair follicles and irregular vascular structure. In the case of wounded fetal tissue, however, wounded tissue is replaced with normal tissue through the activity of stem cells. A possible method for tissue regeneration in adults is to place adult stem cell \"seeds\" inside a tissue bed \"soil\" in a wound bed and allow the stem cells to stimulate differentiation in the tissue bed cells. This method elicits a regenerative response more similar to fetal wound-healing than adult scar tissue formation. Researchers are still investigating different aspects of the \"soil\" tissue that are conducive to regeneration.\n\nCulture of human embryonic stem cells in mitotically inactivated porcine ovarian fibroblasts (POF) causes differentiation into germ cells (precursor cells of oocytes and spermatozoa), as evidenced by gene expression analysis.\n\nHuman embryonic stem cells have been stimulated to form Spermatozoon-like cells, yet still slightly damaged or malformed. It could potentially treat azoospermia.\n\nIn 2012, oogonial stem cells were isolated from adult mouse and human ovaries and demonstrated to be capable of forming mature oocytes. These cells have the potential to treat infertility.\n\nDestruction of the immune system by the HIV is driven by the loss of CD4+ T cells in the peripheral blood and lymphoid tissues. Viral entry into CD4+ cells is mediated by the interaction with a cellular chemokine receptor, the most common of which are CCR5 and CXCR4. Because subsequent viral replication requires cellular gene expression processes, activated CD4+ cells are the primary targets of productive HIV infection. Recently scientists have been investigating an alternative approach to treating HIV-1/AIDS, based on the creation of a disease-resistant immune system through transplantation of autologous, gene-modified (HIV-1-resistant) hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (GM-HSPC).\n\nStem cells are thought to mediate repair via five primary mechanisms: 1) providing an anti-inflammatory effect, 2) homing to damaged tissues and recruiting other cells, such as endothelial progenitor cells, that are necessary for tissue growth, 3) supporting tissue remodeling over scar formation, 4) inhibiting apoptosis, and 5) differentiating into bone, cartilage, tendon, and ligament tissue.\n\nTo further enrich blood supply to the damaged areas, and consequently promote tissue regeneration, platelet-rich plasma could be used in conjunction with stem cell transplantation. The efficacy of some stem cell populations may also be affected by the method of delivery; for instance, to regenerate bone, stem cells are often introduced in a scaffold where they produce the minerals necessary for generation of functional bone.\n\nStem cells have also been shown to have a low immunogenicity due to the relatively low number of MHC molecules found on their surface. In addition, they have been found to secrete chemokines that alter the immune response and promote tolerance of the new tissue. This allows for allogeneic treatments to be performed without a high rejection risk.\n\nThe ability to grow up functional adult tissues indefinitely in culture through Directed differentiation creates new opportunities for drug research. Researchers are able to grow up differentiated cell lines and then test new drugs on each cell type to examine possible interactions \"in vitro\" before performing \"in vivo\" studies. This is critical in the development of drugs for use in veterinary research because of the possibilities of species specific interactions. The hope is that having these cell lines available for research use will reduce the need for research animals used because effects on human tissue \"in vitro\" will provide insight not normally known before the animal testing phase.\n\nStem cells are being explored for use in conservation efforts. Spermatogonial stem cells have been harvested from a rat and placed into a mouse host and fully mature sperm were produced with the ability to produce viable offspring. Currently research is underway to find suitable hosts for the introduction of donor spermatogonial stem cells. If this becomes a viable option for conservationists, sperm can be produced from high genetic quality individuals who die before reaching sexual maturity, preserving a line that would otherwise be lost.\n\nMost stem cells intended for regenerative therapy are generally isolated either from the patient's bone marrow or from adipose tissue. Mesenchymal stem cells can differentiate into the cells that make up bone, cartilage, tendons, and ligaments, as well as muscle, neural and other progenitor tissues, they have been the main type of stem cells studied in the treatment of diseases affecting these tissues. The number of stem cells transplanted into damaged tissue may alter efficacy of treatment. Accordingly, stem cells derived from bone marrow aspirates, for instance, are cultured in specialized laboratories for expansion to millions of cells. Although adipose-derived tissue also requires processing prior to use, the culturing methodology for adipose-derived stem cells is not as extensive as that for bone marrow-derived cells. While it is thought that bone-marrow derived stem cells are preferred for bone, cartilage, ligament, and tendon repair, others believe that the less challenging collection techniques and the multi-cellular microenvironment already present in adipose-derived stem cell fractions make the latter the preferred source for autologous transplantation.\n\nNew sources of mesenchymal stem cells are being researched, including stem cells present in the skin and dermis which are of interest because of the ease at which they can be harvested with minimal risk to the animal. Hematopoetic stem cells have also been discovered to be travelling in the blood stream and possess equal differentiating ability as other mesenchymal stem cells, again with a very non-invasive harvesting technique.\n\nThere is widespread controversy over the use of human embryonic stem cells. This controversy primarily targets the techniques used to derive new embryonic stem cell lines, which often requires the destruction of the blastocyst. Opposition to the use of human embryonic stem cells in research is often based on philosophical, moral, or religious objections. There is other stem cell research that does not involve the destruction of a human embryo, and such research involves adult stem cells, amniotic stem cells, and induced pluripotent stem cells.\n\nOn 23 January 2009, the US Food and Drug Administration gave clearance to Geron Corporation for the initiation of the first clinical trial of an embryonic stem-cell-based therapy on humans. The trial aimed evaluate the drug GRNOPC1, embryonic stem cell-derived oligodendrocyte progenitor cells, on people with acute spinal cord injury. The trial was discontinued in November 2011 so that the company could focus on therapies in the \"current environment of capital scarcity and uncertain economic conditions\". In 2013 biotechnology and regenerative medicine company BioTime () acquired Geron's stem cell assets in a stock transaction, with the aim of restarting the clinical trial.\n\nScientists have reported that MSCs when transfused immediately within few hours post thawing may show reduced function or show decreased efficacy in treating diseases as compared to those MSCs which are in log phase of cell growth(fresh), so cryopreserved MSCs should be brought back into log phase of cell growth in invitro culture before these are administered for clinical trials or experimental therapies, re-culturing of MSCs will help in recovering from the shock the cells get during freezing and thawing. Various clinical trials on MSCs have failed which used cryopreserved product immediately post thaw as compared to those clinical trials which used fresh MSCs.\n\nResearch has been conducted on horses, dogs, and cats can benefit the development of stem cell treatments in veterinary medicine and can target a wide range of injuries and diseases such as myocardial infarction, stroke, tendon and ligament damage, osteoarthritis, osteochondrosis and muscular dystrophy both in large animals, as well as humans. While investigation of cell-based therapeutics generally reflects human medical needs, the high degree of frequency and severity of certain injuries in racehorses has put veterinary medicine at the forefront of this novel regenerative approach. Companion animals can serve as clinically relevant models that closely mimic human disease.\n\nVeterinary applications of stem cell therapy as a means of tissue regeneration have been largely shaped by research that began with the use of adult-derived mesenchymal stem cells to treat animals with injuries or defects affecting bone, cartilage, ligaments and/or tendons. There are two main categories of stem cells used for treatments: allogeneic stem cells derived from a genetically different donor within the same species and autologous mesenchymal stem cells, derived from the patient prior to use in various treatments. A third category, xenogenic stem cells, or stem cells derived from different species, are used primarily for research purposes, especially for human treatments.\n\nBone has a unique and well documented natural healing process that normally is sufficient to repair fractures and other common injuries. Misaligned breaks due to severe trauma, as well as treatments like tumor resections of bone cancer, are prone to improper healing if left to the natural process alone. Scaffolds composed of natural and artificial components are seeded with mesenchymal stem cells and placed in the defect. Within four weeks of placing the scaffold, newly formed bone begins to integrate with the old bone and within 32 weeks, full union is achieved. Further studies are necessary to fully characterize the use of cell-based therapeutics for treatment of bone fractures.\n\nStem cells have been used to treat degenerative bone diseases. The normally recommended treatment for dogs that have Legg–Calve–Perthes disease is to remove the head of the femur after the degeneration has progressed. Recently, mesenchymal stem cells have been injected directly in to the head of the femur, with success not only in bone regeneration, but also in pain reduction.\n\nBecause of the general positive healing capabilities of stem cells, they have gained interest for the treatment of cutaneous wounds. This is important interest for those with reduced healing capabilities, like diabetics and those undergoing chemotherapy. In one trial, stem cells were isolated from the Wharton's jelly of the umbilical cord. These cells were injected directly into the wounds. Within a week, full re-epithelialization of the wounds had occurred, compared to minor re-epithelialization in the control wounds. This showed the capabilities of mesenchymal stem cells in the repair of epidermal tissues.\n\nSoft-palate defects in horses are caused by a failure of the embryo to fully close at the midline during embryogenesis. These are often not found until after they have become worse because of the difficulty in visualizing the entire soft palate. This lack of visualization is thought to also contribute to the low success rate in surgical intervention to repair the defect. As a result, the horse often has to be euthanized. Recently, the use of mesenchymal stem cells has been added to the conventional treatments. After the surgeon has sutured the palate closed, autologous mesenchymal cells are injected into the soft palate. The stem cells were found to be integrated into the healing tissue especially along the border with the old tissue. There was also a large reduction in the number of inflammatory cells present, which is thought to aid in the healing process.\n\nAutologous stem cell-based treatments for ligament injury, tendon injury, osteoarthritis, osteochondrosis, and sub-chondral bone cysts have been commercially available to practicing veterinarians to treat horses since 2003 in the United States and since 2006 in the United Kingdom. Autologous stem cell based treatments for tendon injury, ligament injury, and osteoarthritis in dogs have been available to veterinarians in the United States since 2005. Over 3000 privately owned horses and dogs have been treated with autologous adipose-derived stem cells. The efficacy of these treatments has been shown in double-blind clinical trials for dogs with osteoarthritis of the hip and elbow and horses with tendon damage.\n\nRace horses are especially prone to injuries of the tendon and ligaments. Conventional therapies are very unsuccessful in returning the horse to full functioning potential. Natural healing, guided by the conventional treatments, leads to the formation of fibrous scar tissue that reduces flexibility and full joint movement. Traditional treatments prevented a large number of horses from returning to full activity and also have a high incidence of re-injury due to the stiff nature of the scarred tendon. Introduction of both bone marrow and adipose derived stem cells, along with natural mechanical stimulus promoted the regeneration of tendon tissue. The natural movement promoted the alignment of the new fibers and tendocytes with the natural alignment found in uninjured tendons. Stem cell treatment not only allowed more horses to return to full duty and also greatly reduced the re-injury rate over a three-year period.\n\nThe use of embryonic stem cells has also been applied to tendon repair. The embryonic stem cells were shown to have a better survival rate in the tendon as well as better migrating capabilities to reach all areas of damaged tendon. The overall repair quality was also higher, with better tendon architecture and collagen formed. There was also no tumor formation seen during the three-month experimental period. Long-term studies need to be carried out to examine the long-term efficacy and risks associated with the use of embryonic stem cells. Similar results have been found in small animals.\n\nOsteoarthritis is the main cause of joint pain both in animals and humans. Horses and dogs are most frequently affected by arthritis. Natural cartilage regeneration is very limited and no current drug therapies are curative, but rather look to reduce the symptoms associated with the degeneration. Different types of mesenchymal stem cells and other additives are still being researched to find the best type of cell and method for long-term treatment.\n\nAdipose-derived mesenchymal cells are currently the most often used because of the non-invasive harvesting. There has been a lot of success recently injecting mesenchymal stem cells directly into the joint. This is a recently developed, non-invasive technique developed for easier clinical use. Dogs receiving this treatment showed greater flexibility in their joints and less pain.\n\nStem cells have successfully been used to ameliorate healing in the heart after myocardial infarction in dogs. Adipose and bone marrow derived stem cells were removed and induced to a cardiac cell fate before being injected into the heart. The heart was found to have improved contractility and a reduction in the damaged area four weeks after the stem cells were applied.\n\nA different trial is underway for a patch made of a porous substance onto which the stem cells are \"seeded\" in order to induce tissue regeneration in heart defects. Tissue was regenerated and the patch was well incorporated into the heart tissue. This is thought to be due, in part, to improved angiogenesis and reduction of inflammation. Although cardiomyocytes were produced from the mesenchymal stem cells, they did not appear to be contractile. Other treatments that induced a cardiac fate in the cells before transplanting had greater success at creating contractile heart tissue.\n\nSpinal cord injuries are one of the most common traumas brought into veterinary hospitals. Spinal injuries occur in two ways after the trauma: the primary mechanical damage, and in secondary processes, like inflammation and scar formation, in the days following the trauma. These cells involved in the secondary damage response secrete factors that promote scar formation and inhibit cellular regeneration. Mesenchymal stem cells that are induced to a neural cell fate are loaded onto a porous scaffold and are then implanted at the site of injury. The cells and scaffold secrete factors that counteract those secreted by scar forming cells and promote neural regeneration. Eight weeks later, dogs treated with stem cells showed immense improvement over those treated with conventional therapies. Dogs treated with stem cells were able to occasionally support their own weight, which has not been seen in dogs undergoing conventional therapies.\n\nTreatments are also in clinical trials to repair and regenerate peripheral nerves. Peripheral nerves are more likely to be damaged, but the effects of the damage are not as widespread as seen in injuries to the spinal cord. Treatments are currently in clinical trials to repair severed nerves, with early success. Stem cells induced to a neural fate injected in to a severed nerve. Within four weeks, regeneration of previously damaged stem cells and completely formed nerve bundles were observed.\n\nStem cells are also in clinical phases for treatment in ophthalmology. Hematopoietic stem cells have been used to treat corneal ulcers of different origin of several horses. These ulcers were resistant to conventional treatments available, but quickly responded positively to the stem cell treatment. Stem cells were also able to restore sight in one eye of a horse with retinal detachment, allowing the horse to return to daily activities.\n\nIn the late 1990s and early 2000s there was an initial wave of companies and clinics offering stem cell therapy to desperate people, often with extraordinary claims about what stem cells could do. Such companies and clinics included Advanced Cell Therapeutics, Stowe BioTherapy, Cells4Health run by Cornelis Kleinbloesem, the Beijing Xishan Institute for Neuroregeneration and Functional Recovery in Shijingshan run by Huang Hongyun, and EmCell in Kiev, Ukraine run by Alexandr Smikodub. These clinics made strong claims about their outcomes, but rarely published their protocols or rigorous research showing that their therapies were safe and effective.\n\nBy 2012 a second wave of companies and clinics had emerged, usually located in developing countries where medicine is less regulated and offering stem cell therapies on a medical tourism model. Like the first wave companies and clinics, they have made similar strong claims and also have not published their protocols or rigorous research; Mexico, Thailand, and India have been centers of this activity, as has South Africa.\n\nIn 2018 the FDA sent a warning letter to StemGenex Biologic Laboratories in San Diego, which marketed a service in which it took body fat from people, processed it into mixtures it said contained various forms of stem cells, and administered it back to the person by inhalation, IV, or infusion into their spinal cords; the company said the treatment was useful for many chronic and life-threatening conditions.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2546655", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2546655", "title": "Stolen body hypothesis", "text": "Stolen body hypothesis\n\nThe stolen body hypothesis posits that the body of Jesus Christ was stolen from his burial place. His tomb was found empty not because he was resurrected, but because the body had been hidden somewhere else by the apostles or unknown persons. Both the stolen body hypothesis and the debate over it presume the basic historicity of the gospel accounts of the tomb discovery. The stolen body hypothesis finds the idea that the body was not in the tomb plausible - such a claim could be checked if early Christians made it - but considers it more likely that early Christians had been misled into believing the resurrection by the theft of Jesus's body.\n\nThe hypothesis has existed since the days of Early Christianity; it is discussed in the Gospel of Matthew, generally agreed to have been written between AD 70 and 100. Matthew's gospel raises the hypothesis only to refute it; according to it, the claim the body was stolen is a lie spread by the Jewish high priests.\n\nThe primary sources of details about Jesus are the Gospels. Roman records are spottier - there is no extant contemporary record of the execution of Jesus, for example, not that such a thing would be expected, and thus no details about what was done with the body afterward. As such, accounts of the days between Jesus's execution and the discovery of the empty tomb are almost exclusively based on the Gospel accounts and knowledge of society at the time, and it is difficult to say more than scenarios such as the stolen body hypothesis are \"plausible\" or \"unlikely,\" rather than \"proven\" or \"disproven\".\n\nAccording to the Gospel of Mark, generally thought to be the oldest of the gospels, Joseph of Arimathea asked Pontius Pilate for the body of Jesus. Afterward, a group of women went to the tomb, and found the stone rolled away, an angel there, and no body. The Gospel of Luke largely concurs with this account, though the list of women slightly differs. According to the Gospel of John, Nicodemus helped Joseph of Arimathea with the burial of Jesus. It also notes that Jesus was buried in a garden near the site of the crucifixion, and that no body had lain there before. In John, Simon Peter and the beloved disciple also come to the tomb to verify Mary Magdalene's claim of an empty tomb; there is no direct reference to this in Mark and Luke, where it is implied that the apostles only believe upon seeing the resurrected Jesus.\n\nThe Gospel of Matthew includes a distinct account of the period between Jesus's death and the discovery of the empty tomb not in the other gospels, and directly addresses skepticism about the resurrection. In Matthew's account, the chief priests and the Pharisees know of prophecies that Jesus will return in three days, and fear that his disciples will steal the body to make it appear that he has been resurrected. They ask Pilate to secure the tomb, and Pilate sends a guard to watch the tomb. When Mary Magdalene arrives at the tomb, unlike the accounts in the other gospels, there is an earthquake and the tomb rolls open in front of her. An angel appears and scares away the guards, and the empty tomb is revealed. When the guards report this to the chief priests, the priests bribe the guards to lie about the events:\n\nThis is the chief reference to the stolen body hypothesis in the New Testament.\n\nAccording to this version of the stolen body hypothesis, some of the disciples stole away Jesus's body. Potential reasons include wishing to bury Jesus themselves; believing that Jesus would soon return and wanting his body in their possession; a \"pious deceit\" to restore Jesus's good name after being crucified as a criminal; or an outright plot to fake a resurrection. In the pious deceit theory, the proposed motive is that if people believed God had taken Jesus's body up to heaven, this would \"prove\" Jesus was a true holy man and vindicate his name. The \"faked resurrection\" theory is the only scenario discussed in the gospels, although Matthew brings it up solely to refute it and claim that the tale was a concoction of Jerusalem's high priests. According to proponents of this theory, the fact that Matthew raises the issue makes it likely that such an anti-Christian narrative already existed at the time. Jesus's entourage may have been at least as many as seventy (the Seventy Disciples), so it is not improbable according to proponents that at least one or two of them might have been willing to undertake such a plot. This theory also obviates the need for a miraculous resurrection.\n\nA Jewish anti-Christian work dating from the 5th-century, the Toledoth Yeshu, contains the claim the disciples planned to steal Jesus's body from his tomb. In this account, the body had already been moved, and when the disciples arrived at the empty tomb they came to the incorrect conclusion that he had risen from the dead. Later, the corpse was sold to the Jewish leaders for thirty pieces of silver, who confirmed Jesus's death; Jesus's corpse was then dragged through the streets of Jerusalem. Another variant comes from a record of a 2nd-century debate between a Christian and a Jew, Justin Martyr's \"Dialogue with Trypho\": \"his disciples stole him by night from the tomb, where he was laid when unfastened from the cross, and now deceive men by asserting that he has risen from the dead and ascended to heaven.\"\n\nChristian apologists find the idea that the disciples stole the body unconvincing. Both Eusebius and church tradition hold that a large number of apostles were martyred for their faith. Therefore, it is unlikely that any conspirators would preach and ultimately die for something they knew to be false. J.N.D. Anderson, dean of the faculty of law at the University of London and Christian apologist, said \"This [the stolen body theory] would run totally contrary to all we know of them [the apostles]: their ethical teaching, the quality of their lives. Nor would it begin to explain their dramatic transformation from dejected and dispirited escapists into witnesses whom no opposition could muzzle.\"\n\nE.P. Sanders agrees with apologists that it is unlikely that the disciples would create a fraud but looks at it differently. He claims:\n\"It is difficult to accuse these sources, or the first believers, of deliberate fraud. A plot to foster belief in the Resurrection would probably have resulted in a more consistent story. Instead, there seems to have been a competition: 'I saw him,' 'so did I,' 'the women saw him first,' 'no, I did; they didn't see him at all,' and so on. Moreover, some of the witnesses of the Resurrection would give their lives for their belief. This also makes fraud unlikely.\" \n\nResponses from proponents include the possibility that the number of actual conspirators was small, or that early Christian theology on the matter of the resurrection was very different from proto-orthodox Christianity.\n\nAnother apologetical argument is to argue that the disciples had no compelling reason to fabricate a resurrection story because they earnestly believed (at that time) Jesus was not the Messiah after all. According to J.N.D. Anderson in his work, the disciples simply didn't anticipate the resurrection and were surprised by the physical presence of the risen Christ. This is emphasized by the disciples fearful response upon seeing Jesus for the first time after his resurrection: \"...They were startled and frightened, thinking they saw a ghost\" (). They seemingly failed to \"expect\" the resurrection and were either unfamiliar with or discounted prophecies indicating the Messiah would be resurrected. The Gospel of John seems to support this: \"...Finally the other disciple, who had reached the tomb first, also went inside. He saw and believed. They still did not understand from Scripture that Jesus had to rise from the dead...\" (). If the apostles \"did not understand\" these prophecies, they would have no logical purpose in robbing the body of Jesus from his tomb, as there was nothing to prove.\n\nProponents refer to the Gospel of Matthew in response to this. If the high priests and the Pharisees understood that Jesus claimed he would rise from the dead in three days, it is plausible his disciples understood this as well.\n\nGraverobbing was a known problem in 1st century Judaea; the famous Nazareth Inscription details an edict of Caesar that mandates capital punishment for meddling with tombs. Several other pieces of evidence exist as well, such as a decree of Emperor Septimius Severus reasserting the existing law, implying that its violation continued to be a problem in the 2nd century AD. It is thus possible that Jesus's body was taken by graverobbers. Gary Habermas finds this unlikely; he writes: \"Robbing a tomb for valuables is one thing - taking the body with you is something else! Why take a male body with you when you are trying to escape?\" Nevertheless, it appears some ancient graverobbers did steal bodies. A possible motive for such would be the usage of Jesus's body in necromancy; several rites of the time required \"one untimely dead\" or the body of a holy person. For example, a person could insert a scroll into a corpse's mouth and ask questions of the dead according to one belief of the time. Tacitus notes that \"the remains of human bodies\" were found along with curse paraphernalia in the quarters of Germanicus. William Lane Craig dismisses these cases from elsewhere in the Roman Empire as too remote as they are \"non-Jewish, non-Palestinian, and non-contemporary — in other words, irrelevant to Jesus.\"\n\nHistorian Charles Freeman posits that Caiaphas and members of the Sanhedrin removed Jesus's body to stave off possible civil disorder from Jesus's followers. By emptying the tomb, the Sanhedrin hoped to prevent it from becoming a shrine. Also, he noted that the gospels of Matthew and Mark both record that one or more young men (or angels) dressed in white appeared to the myrrhbearers and told them to seek Jesus in Galilee. Freeman argued that these young men/angels could have been priests from the Temple in Jerusalem, as their Gospel description matches that of temple priests (white clothes). By encouraging Jesus's followers to return to Galilee, then, the priests were trying to get them to leave Jerusalem and avoid unrest.\n\nAccording to this version of the stolen body hypothesis, there was no conspiracy; Jesus's body was moved from the tomb for unknown or irrelevant reasons. The apostles then found an empty tomb and became genuinely convinced that Jesus had been resurrected, which would explain their later fervor in the spread of Christianity. Author and textual critic Bart Ehrman contends that while the stolen body hypothesis is unlikely, from a historical perspective it is still far more probable than the resurrection. Ehrman also says that there are plenty of motives for stealing the body. Maybe Jesus's family wanted it buried in the family tomb?\n\nAnother possibility, if a rather bizarre one, is the gardener. Tertullian, in \"De Spectaculis\" 30, mentions that in addition to the theory that the disciples stole the body the theory that the gardener did the deed such that \"his lettuces might come to no harm from the crowds of visitants [to the body].\" Tertullian, an early Christian polemicist, may have merely meant to mock those who doubted the resurrection by putting the petty gardener theory in their mouths. The passage also perhaps only references a joke at the time or other non-serious accusation. However, the gospel of John possibly addresses the issue, as does Tatian's \"Diatessaron\". In and the \"Diatessaron\" Section 53, Mary, after supposing the resurrected Jesus to be the gardener, asks him what he had done with the body - implying that the gardener may in fact have had a motive to move the body. In addition, in the Toledoth Yeshu, it is a gardener named Juda who originally moves the body, and then later sells the body of Jesus to the Jewish leadership. Even if this all only attests to a Jewish polemic against Christianity, it implies that people at that time found the gardener having a motive to steal the body plausible, even if this motive is unknown to us today.\n\nAccording to the Gospel of Matthew, a guard was sent to the tomb: \"Pilate said to them, 'You have a guard of soldiers; go, make it as secure as you can.' So they went with the guard and made the tomb secure by sealing the stone.\" () It is unclear whether Roman soldiers were used, or if the priests were to use their own temple guard. Nevertheless, Christian tradition has generally claimed that Roman guards were used. Apologists consider it implausible that grave robbers would risk robbing a guarded tomb when surely many unguarded ones existed. Furthermore, while traditionally depicted as only two guards, Matthew does not specify how many there were; since \"some\" guards report the tale to the chief priests, it's plausible to assume there may have been more than two, which would render a raid even chancier. Apologists also doubt that the disciples could possibly have sneaked past a Roman guard at a sealed tomb, and that attacking the guards would be even more implausible. In response, it could be hypothesized that the guard was not on duty at night, and thus the thieves would be able to have struck then. A bribe to the soldiers is also possible, although most of the disciples were of modest means.\n\nAlternatively, the entire account of the guard and the chief priests can be discounted as likely to be an ahistorical addition written by Matthew to make the stolen body hypothesis appear implausible. Among scholars, it \"is widely regarded as an apologetic legend\"; L. Michael White and Helmut Koester argue the story was probably added as an attempt to refute the Jewish claims that the disciples stole the body which were circulating at the time. Atheist and historian Richard Carrier writes:\nWilliam Lane Craig considers the historicity of the guards plausible, although he suspects it was more likely Jewish temple guards, especially considering the chief priests' promises to keep them \"out of trouble\" would mean little to Roman soldiers who might be executed for claiming to have slept on duty. The best objection to Matthew's version, to Craig, is that Matthew's account \"presupposes not only that Jesus predicted his resurrection in three days, but also that the Jews understood this clearly while the disciples remained in ignorance.\" While the gospel accounts give good reason to believe that the disciples would not understand the resurrection until it happened, Craig grants that it is indeed harder to explain the chief priest's actions, although far from impossible - perhaps it was simply an attempt to ensure no trouble started. In favor of the existence of the guards being historical, however, Craig notes that the non-canonical Gospel of Peter also includes a story of guards being placed at the tomb, yet one that is quite different, suggesting that the guards are less likely to have been invented entirely by Matthew. Additionally, Matthew's account isn't as foolproof as an invented or exaggerated account could be - the Gospel of Peter has an explicitly Roman guard guarding the tomb sent immediately on Good Friday (rather than Matthew's Saturday), the tomb is sealed seven times, and the Jewish elders keep watch the entire time. On Easter Sunday, Jesus rises, flanked by two angels, in front of the Jews and a crowd from Jerusalem out to see him. This account, given credence by neither Christians nor historians, clearly makes a secret theft of the body impossible. Additionally, Craig writes that the polemic mentioned by Matthew suggests that Jews didn't contest the existence of a guard at the time. In other words, if the guard didn't exist, the logical Jewish counterargument would be to argue against that Christian claim; instead, Matthew's story has the Jewish side using the weak \"but the guards were asleep when the theft occurred\" argument, suggesting the Jews of the time knew guards had been placed.\n\nThe gospels of Luke and John record that the burial wrappings of Jesus were left inside the tomb. The head wrapping was folded and placed separate from the other linens (). Christian apologists contend that a grave robber would probably have stolen everything, especially since Joseph of Arimathea was a man of means and the wrappings were likely to have been valuable. Further, carefully removing, then wrapping and folding the linens would be difficult and serve no useful purpose. Thus these claims in the gospel are also brought into contention by the theory, especially if a grave robber is proposed as the culprit. Replies from proponents include noting that if the motive of the graverobbers was body parts for necromancy, the cloths might be irrelevant; and if the culprit was a conspirator out to \"prove\" Jesus's holiness, then the wrappings might have been \"deliberately\" left behind to foster the notion of the body miraculously disappearing. Richard Carrier also considers the mention of the cloths \"a natural embellishment to such a narrative and thus cannot be trusted to be historical,\" since historians of the era would often illustrate such scenes with plausible minor details that lack a source, similar to military historians describing specific sword interplay.\n\nSome apologists note that the disciples, as practicing Jews, could not come near a dead body without breaking ritual purity regulations. Exceptions included the nearest male relative could claim a dead body and women. Thus, the fact that women discovered the empty tomb first is seen as very plausible, and the (presumably devout) disciples taking the body is seen as a less likely explanation. However, if a genuine conspiracy was afoot, breaking purity is unlikely to have stopped the conspirators, and grave robbers violate this law constantly by profession. If Jesus's family reclaimed the body, this would not apply either. It does, however, make it less plausible other Jews would have stolen the body.\n\n\n"}

The party's inception was strongly supported by Dr Philip Nitschke, director of Exit International and Richard Mills, then President of Dying with Dignity NSW.\n\nThe party applied to the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) to be registered as a political party on 10 May 2013. The application was assessed on 20 May and the party was registered on 1 June.\n\nThe party was founded in 2013 to bring attention to the need for voluntary assisted dying law reform and to bring together advocates from the Dying with Dignity and Exit International movements. The immediate goal of the VEP was to make voluntary euthanasia a central issue at the September 2013 Federal election, and it nominated six candidates for the Senate (two each in New South Wales, the ACT and South Australia); and a candidate for the House of Representatives seat of Solomon in the Northern Territory. Three of the candidates were terminally ill.\n\nProfessor Ranjan Ray, former President of the Western Australia Voluntary Euthanasia Society, was the first convenor of the Party, and was succeeded by Kerry Bromson in 2014. Philip Nitschke, the founder of Exit International, is the Deputy Convenor, and has been since the party's launch in 2013.\n\nThere is no universally agreed definition of \"voluntary euthanasia\". Terms like dying with dignity, physician-assisted dying, physician-assisted suicide and voluntary assisted dying are also used. The VEP regards voluntary euthanasia as involving a request by a terminally or incurably ill person for medical assistance to end his or her life painlessly and peacefully. A doctor may administer the medication or prescribe medication that the patient self-administers.\n\nIn New South Wales, the VEP will be standing candidates for the Legislative Council in the state election on 28 March 2015. The lead candidate for the VEP in the New South Wales state election, 2015 is Shayne Higson. Mrs Higson began advocating for voluntary assisted dying legislation after her mother died from a brain tumour in 2012.\n\nThe VEP fielded candidates in five Legislative Council (upper house) regions at the Victorian state election on 29 November 2014. The lead candidate for the VEP in Victoria was Dr Fiona Stewart, public health sociologist and co-author of four books about end of life issues including \"The Peaceful Pill Handbook\". The VEP received 16,769 first preference votes (0.5 per cent of formal upper house votes) and did not win a seat.\n\nThe party nominated several candidates at the 2013 Australian federal election: six candidates for the Senate (two each in New South Wales, the ACT and South Australia); and a candidate for the House of Representatives seat of Solomon in the Northern Territory. Three of the candidates were terminally ill.\n\nIn the 2016 federal election the Voluntary Euthanasia Party fielded two senate candidates in each of New South Wales, South Australia and Victoria, and one candidate in Victoria for the House of Representatives seat of Menzies.\n\nThe VEP has over 3500 members (current as of February 2015), many of whom are also members of their state dying with dignity branch, voluntary euthanasia organisation and/or Exit International.\n"}
