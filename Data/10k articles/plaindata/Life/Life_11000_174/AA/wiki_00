It was founded by Russian entrepreneur Dmitry Itskov in February 2011 with the participation of Russian specialists in the field of neural interfaces, robotics, artificial organs and systems.\n\nThe main goal of the 2045 Initiative, as stated on site, is \"to create technologies enabling the transfer of an individual’s personality to a more advanced non-biological carrier, and extending life, including to the point of immortality. We devote particular attention to enabling the fullest possible dialogue between the world’s major spiritual traditions, science and society\".\n\nThe 2045 Initiative has a roadmap for developing cybernetic immortality. The Initiative has the goal for an avatar controlled by a \"brain-computer\" interface to be developed between 2015 and 2020, between 2020 and 2025 creating an autonomous life-support system for the human brain linked to a robot, between 2030 and 2035 creating a computer model of the brain and human consciousness with the means to transfer it into an artificial carrier, and by 2045 create a new era for humanity with holographic bodies.\n\nOne of the featured life-extension projects is to design an artificial humanoid body (called an \"avatar\") and an advanced brain–computer interface system. On the biological side, a life support system will be developed for hosting a human brain inside the avatar and maintaining it alive and functional. A later phase of the project will research into the creation of an artificial brain into which the original individual consciousness may be transferred.\n\nA robotic copy of a human body remotely capable of interpreting commands directly from the mind, and sending information back to the mind in a form that can be interpreted via brain–computer interface. It is estimated to be popularized in or before 2020.\n\nAn avatar in which a human brain is transplanted at the end of one's life. Avatar B has an autonomous system providing life support for the brain and allowing it interaction with the environment, possibly mounted into an existing Avatar A Chassis. Deadline of this phase is year 2025.\n\nAn avatar with an artificial brain to which a human personality is transferred for emulation at the end of one's life. The first successful attempt to upload one's personality to a computer is estimated to happen around 2035.\n\nA hologram- or diagram-like avatar. This is the ultimate goal of this project but is optional since, assuming either the upload is involuntary or all humans chose to upload, biological diseases are prevented in the previous phase, and it is far away from current technological achievement and our understanding on physics.\n\nProfessor George M. Church has complained that \"there's a lot of dots that aren't connected in (Itskov's) plans. It's not a real road map.\" Martine A. Rothblatt, the founder of United Therapeutics, has claimed the Avatar Project is \"no more wild than in the early '60s, when we saw the advent of liver and kidney transplants.\"\n\n"}

He was a Sanskrit, Vedic and Persian scholar of the early 19th century Maharashtra. He was a native of the Satara district of Maharashtra.\n\nAba was one of the three scholars who were consultants to the British Historian James Grant Duff, specifically in Persian sources of the \nhistory of Maharashtra - the other two scholars being Balajipant Natu and Balvantrao Chitnis. Duff would persistently demand more material and would consult and ask them for interpretations of terms and policies and explanations for events in the materials that he had in his possession. His questions were directed to the origin and justification of specific policies and concepts - taxes such as \"chauth\" and \"sardeshmukhi\". Duff would be frustrated by what he deemed as \"inconsistent answers\" from these knowledgeable people. The scholars such as Parasnis, on their part, resented the \"insistent cross examination\" by Duff.\n\nParasnis is most notable for a unique \"Brahmin varna vs Kshatriya varna\" debate that took place at Satara. It involved discussions and disputes related to the intricacies of the Hindu Shastras, Vedas and Puranas. The Kshatriya varna was represented by Parasnis and the Brahman varna was \nrepresented by Raghvacharya Gajendragadkar. This historic debate took place in the early 19th century Maharashtra. It was attended by hundreds of prominent Brahmins all over Maharashtra. Historians have credited Parasnis for debating effectively and \"holding his own\".\n\nTwo Sanskrit books \"Karmakalapdruma\" and \"Siddhantavijaya\" were authored by Parasnis and published by Pratapsimha. \nThe \"Siddhantavijaya\" is considered important because it gives details of the Maratha clan system. It is written in Sanskrit with some content in\nmarathi. The other Sanskrit scripture authored by him is \"Karmakalpadruma\". It is a manual for Hindu rituals and hence called the samskara manual. A translation of Siddhanatavijaya and some commentary was written by Mahadev Ganesh Dongre in the early 20th century.\n\nPratapsimha realized the importance of the knowledge of Sanskrit and decided to open a \"pathshala\" to teach Sanskrit to boys from the Maratha caste. Parasnis was the first head of this school.\n"}

The node is a failure node if there is no method for solving P.\n\nIf all of the children of a node N, conjoined by the same arc, are success nodes, then the node N is also a success node. Otherwise the node is a failure node.\n\nAn and-or tree specifies only the search space for solving a problem. Different search strategies for searching the space are possible. These include searching the tree depth-first, breadth-first, or best-first using some measure of desirability of solutions. The search strategy can be sequential, searching or generating one node at a time, or parallel, searching or generating several nodes in parallel.\n\nThe methods used for generating and-or trees are propositional logic programs (without variables). In the case of logic programs containing variables, the solutions of conjoint sub-problems must be compatible. Subject to this complication, sequential and parallel search strategies for and-or trees provide a computational model for executing logic programs.\n\nAnd–or trees can also be used to represent the search spaces for two-person games. The root node of such a tree represents the problem of one of the players winning the game, starting from the initial state of the game. Given a node N, labelled by the problem P of the player winning the game from a particular state of play, there exists a single set of conjoint children nodes, corresponding to all of the opponents responding moves. \nFor each of these children nodes, there exists a set of non-conjoint children nodes, corresponding to all of the player's defending moves.\n\nFor solving game trees with proof-number search family of algorithms, game trees are to be mapped to and-or trees. MAX-nodes (i.e. maximizing player to move) are represented as OR nodes, MIN-nodes map to AND nodes. The mapping is possible, when the search is done with only a binary goal, which usually is \"player to move wins the game\".\n\n"}

The explosives are strapped to a pack animal such as a horse, mule or donkey. The pack animal may be set off in a crowd. \n\nProjects of bat bombs and pigeon bomb have also been studied.\n\nIn 2009, the Taliban strapped an improvised explosive device to a donkey. The gate guard noticed something suspicious when a group of men let the donkey go a short way from the camp and then hurried off. The donkey was stopped with a rifle shot. One soldier set fire to the hay with a flare provoking a \"considerable explosion\".\n\nIn April 2013, in Kabul, a bomb attached to a donkey blew up in front of a police security post, killing a policeman and wounding three civilians. A government spokesman claimed insurgents were challenging the competence of the Afghan government prior to the 2014 withdrawal of the U.S. military.\n\nOn 21 November 2003, eight rockets were fired from donkey carts at the Iraqi oil ministry and two hotels in downtown Baghdad, injuring one man and causing some damage.\nIn 2004 a donkey in Ramadi was loaded with explosives and set off towards a US-run checkpoint. It exploded before it was able to injure or kill anyone. The incident, along with a number of similar incidents involving dogs, fueled fears of terrorist practices of using living animals as weapons, a change from an older practice of using the bodies of dead animals to hold explosives. The use of improvised explosive devices concealed in animal's carcasses was also a common practice among the Iraqi Insurgency.\n\nMalia Sufangi, a young Lebanese woman, was caught in the Security Zone in November 1985 with an explosive device mounted on a donkey with which she had failed to carry out an attack. She claimed that she had been recruited and dispatched by Syrian Brigadier-General Ghazi Kanaan who supplied the explosives and instructions on how the attack was to be carried out from his headquarters in the town of Anjer in the Bekaa Valley.\n\nIn 1862, during the New Mexico Campaign of the American Civil War a Confederate force approached the ford at Valverde, six miles north of Fort Craig, hoping to cut Union communications between the fort and their headquarters in Santa Fe. About midnight, Union Captain James Craydon tried to blow up a few rebel picket posts by sending mules loaded with barrels of fused gunpowder into the Confederate lines, but the faithful old army mules insisted on wandering back toward the Union camp before blowing to bits. Although the only casualties were two mules, the explosions stampeded a herd of Confederate beef cattle and horses into the Union's lines, so depriving the Confederate troops of some much-needed provisions and horses.\n\nIn the Wall Street bombing of 1920, an incident thought to be related to the 1919 United States anarchist bombings, anarchists used a bomb carried by horse-drawn cart.\n\n\nDuring World War II the U.S. investigated the use of \"bat bombs\", or bats carrying small incendiary bombs. During the same war, Project Pigeon (later Project Orcon, for \"organic control\") was American behaviorist B. F. Skinner's attempt to develop a pigeon-guided missile. At the same time the Soviet Union developed the \"anti-tank dog\" for use against German tanks. \nMore recently, Iran purchased several dolphins, some of which were former Soviet military dolphins, along with other sea mammals and birds, in what some have alleged to be an attempt by Iran to develop \"kamikaze dolphins\", intended to seek out and destroy submarines and enemy warships. However, the animals are today on display at the Kish Dolphin Park, on Iran's resort island of Kish in the Persian Gulf. During the Cold War, the Soviet Navy trained dolphins to attach underwater explosives and beacons to ships and submarines at Object 825 GTS at Balaklava, Crimea.\n\n"}

It is also concerned to contribute in the other direction: to export tools and techniques developed in the context of legal problems to AI in general. For example, theories of legal decision making, especially models of argumentation, have contributed to knowledge representation and reasoning; models of social organization based on norms have contributed to multi-agent systems; reasoning with legal cases has contributed to case-based reasoning; and the need to store and retrieve large amounts of textual data has resulted in contributions to conceptual information retrieval and intelligent databases.\n\nAlthough Loevinger, Allen and Mehl anticipated several of the ideas that would become important in AI and Law, the first serious proposal for applying AI techniques to law is usually taken to be Buchanan and Headrick. Early work from this period includes Thorne McCarty's influential TAXMAN project in the USA and Ronald Stamper's LEGOL project in the UK. The former concerned the modeling of the majority and minority arguments in a US Tax law case (Eisner v Macomber), while the latter attempted to provide a formal model of the rules and regulations that govern an organization. Landmarks in the early 1980s include Carole Hafner's work on conceptual retrieval, Anne Gardner's work on contract law, Rissland's work on legal hypotheticals and the work at Imperial College, London on executable formalisations of legislation.\n\nEarly meetings of scholars included a one-off meeting at Swansea, the series of conferences organized by IDG in Florence and the workshops organised by Charles Walter at the University of Houston in 1984 and 1985. In 1987 a biennial conference, the International Conference on AI and Law (ICAIL), was instituted. This conference began to be seen as the main venue for publishing and the developing ideas within AI and Law, and it led to the foundation of the International Association for Artificial Intelligence and Law (IAAIL), to organize and convene subsequent ICAILs. This, in turn, led to the foundation of the Artificial Intelligence and Law Journal, first published in 1992. In Europe, the annual JURIX conferences (organised by the Jurix Foundation for Legal Knowledge Based Systems), began in 1988. Initially intended to bring together the Dutch-speaking (i.e. Dutch and Flemish) researchers, JURIX quickly developed into an international, primarily European, conference and since 2002 has regularly been held outside the Dutch speaking countries. Since 2007 the JURISIN workshops have been held in Japan under the auspices of the Japanese Society for Artificial Intelligence.\n\nToday, AI and law embrace a wide range of topics, including:\n\nFormal models of legal texts and legal reasoning have been used in AI and Law to clarify issues, to give a more precise understanding and to provide a basis for implementations. A variety of formalisms have been used, including propositional and predicate calculi; deontic, temporal and non-monotonic logics; and state transition diagrams. Prakken and Sartor give a detailed and authoritative review of the use of logic and argumentation in AI and Law, and has an excellent set of references.\n\nAn important role of formal models is to remove ambiguity. In fact, legislation abounds with ambiguity: because it is written in natural language there are no brackets and so the scope of connectives such as \"and\" and \"or\" can be unclear (legal drafters do not observe the mathematical conventions in this respect). \"Unless\" is also capable of several interpretations, and legal draftsman never write \"if and only if\", although this is often what they intend by \"if\". In perhaps the earliest use of logic to model law in AI and Law, Layman Allen advocated the use of propositional logic to resolve such syntactic ambiguities in a series of papers.\n\nIn the late 1970s and throughout the 1980s a significant strand on AI and Law work involved the production of executable models of legislation. Originating in the LEGOL work of Ronald Stamper the idea was to represent legislation using a formal language and to use this formalisation (typically with some sort of user interface to gather the facts of a particular case) as the basis for an expert system. This became popular, mainly using the Horn Clause subset of first order predicate calculus. In particular Sergot et al.'s representation of the British Nationality Act did much to popularise the approach. In fact, as later work showed, this was an untypically suitable piece of legislation on which to employ the approach: it was new, and so had not been amended, relatively simple and almost all of the concepts were non-technical. Later work, such as that on Supplementary Benefits, showed that larger, more complicated (containing many cross references, exceptions, counterfactuals, and deeming provisions), legislation which used many highly technical concepts (such as contribution conditions) and which had been the subject of many amendments produced a far less satisfactory final system. Some efforts were made to improve matters from a software engineering perspective, especially to handle problems such as cross reference, verification and frequent amendment. The use of hierarchical representations was suggested to address the first problem, and so-called isomorphic representation was intended to address the other two. As the 1990s developed this strand of work became largely absorbed in the development of formalisations of domain conceptualisations, (so-called ontologies), which became popular in AI following the work of Gruber. Early examples in AI and Law include Valente's functional ontology and the frame based ontologies of Visser and van Kralingen. Legal ontologies have since become the subject of regular workshops at AI and Law conferences and there are many examples ranging from generic top-level and core ontologies to very specific models of particular pieces of legislation.\n\nSince law comprises sets of norms, it is unsurprising that deontic logics have been tried as the formal basis for models of legislation. These, however, have not been widely adopted as the basis for expert systems, perhaps because expert systems are supposed to enforce the norms, whereas deontic logic becomes of real interest only when we need to consider violations of the norms. In law directed obligations, whereby an obligation is owed to another named individual are of particular interest, since violations of such obligations are often the basis of legal proceedings. There is also some interesting work combining deontic and action logics to explore normative positions.\n\nIn the context of multi-agent systems, norms have been modelled using state transition diagrams. Often, especially in the context of electronic institutions, the norms so described are regimented (i.e., cannot be violated), but in other systems violations are also handled, giving a more faithful reflection of real norms. For a good example of this approach see Modgil et al.\n\nLaw often concerns issues about time, both relating to the content, such as time periods and deadlines, and those relating to the law itself, such as commencement. Some attempts have been made to model these temporal logics using both computational formalisms such as the Event Calculus and temporal logics such as defeasible temporal logic.\n\nIn any consideration of the use of logic to model law it needs to be borne in mind that law is inherently non-monotonic, as is shown by the rights of appeal enshrined in all legal systems, and the way in which interpretations of the law change over time. Moreover, in the drafting of law exceptions abound, and, in the application of law, precedents are overturned as well as followed. In logic programming approaches, negation of failure is often used to handle non-monotonicity, but specific non-monotonic logics such as defeasible logic have also been used. Following the development of abstract argumentation, however, these concerns have been addressed through argumentation rather than through the use of non-monotonic logics.\n\n\n"}

He is sometimes called 'King of Livonia', Chronicle of Henry of Livonia calls him \"quasi rex\", 'like a king'.\n\nHe was the first prominent Livonian to be christened. He was probably baptized around 1191 by a priest called Theoderic. He became an ardent Christian and friend of Albert of Buxhoeveden, Bishop of Riga, who took him 1203-1204 all the way to Rome and introduced him to Pope Innocent III. The Pope was impressed by the converted pagan chief and presented him a Bible. When he returned from travel, his tribe rebelled against him and Caupo helped to conquer and destroy his own former Castle of Turaida in 1212. The castle was rebuilt two years later as a stone castle that is well preserved even today.\n\nCaupo participated in a crusader raid against the still pagan Estonians and was killed in the Battle of St. Matthew's Day in 1217 against the troops of the Estonian leader Lembitu of Lehola. He did not have any male heirs as his son Bertold had been killed 1210 in the Battle of Ümera against Estonians. He left his inheritance to the church, but the Lieven family later claimed female-line descent from him.\n\nModern Estonians, Latvians, and the remaining few Livonians do not have consensus view about the historical role of Caupo. Some consider him traitor and enemy agent. Others consider him a visionary leader who wanted his people to be part of Christian and European culture. Both these judgments attribute 19th-century views about nationality to a medieval chieftain. Latvian legends, however, are unequivocal: there he is named \"Kaupo the accursed, the scourge of the Livs... Kaupo who has sold his soul to the foreign bishops.\"\n\n"}

{"id": "1814699", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1814699", "title": "Death mask", "text": "Death mask\n\nA death mask is a likeness (typically in wax or plaster cast) of a person's face following death, often made by taking a cast or impression directly from the corpse. Death masks may be mementos of the dead, or be used for creation of portraits. Such casts obviate idealised representations by revealing the actual features. It is sometimes possible to identify portraits that have been painted from death masks, because of the characteristic slight distortions of the features caused by the weight of the plaster during the making of the mold.\n\nThe main purpose of the death mask from the Middle Ages until the 19th century was to serve as a model for sculptors in creating statues and busts of the deceased person. Not until the 1800s did such masks become valued for themselves.\n\nIn other cultures a death mask may be a funeral mask, an image placed on the face of the deceased before burial rites, and normally buried with them. The best known of these are the masks used in ancient Egypt as part of the mummification process, such as Tutankhamun's mask, and those from Mycenaean Greece such as the Mask of Agamemnon.\n\nIn some European countries, it was common for death masks to be used as part of the effigy of the deceased, displayed at state funerals; the coffin portrait was an alternative. Mourning portraits were also painted, showing the subject lying in repose. During the 18th and 19th centuries masks were also used to permanently record the features of unknown corpses for purposes of identification. This function was later replaced by post-mortem photography.\n\nIn the cases of people whose faces were damaged by their death, it was common to take casts of their hands. An example of this occurred in the case of Thomas D'Arcy McGee, the Canadian statesman whose face was shattered by the bullet which assassinated him in 1868.\nWhen taken from a living subject, such a cast is called a life mask. Proponents of phrenology used both death masks and life masks for pseudoscientific purposes.\n\nMasks of deceased persons are part of traditions in many countries. The most important process of the funeral ceremony in ancient Egypt was the mummification of the body, which, after prayers and consecration, was put into a sarcophagus enameled and decorated with gold and gems. A special element of the rite was a sculpted mask, put on the face of the deceased. This mask was believed to strengthen the spirit of the mummy and guard the soul from evil spirits on its way to the afterworld. The best known mask is Tutankhamun's mask. Made of gold and gems, the mask conveys the highly stylized features of the ancient ruler. Such masks were not, however, made from casts of the features; rather, the mummification process itself preserved the features of the deceased.\n\nIn 1876 the archaeologist Heinrich Schliemann discovered in Mycenae six graves, which he was confident belonged to kings and ancient Greek heroes—Agamemnon, Cassandra, Evrimdon and their associates. To his surprise, the skulls were covered with gold masks. It is now thought most unlikely that the masks actually belonged to Agamemnon and other heroes of the Homeric epics; in fact they are several centuries older.\n\nThe lifelike character of Roman portrait sculptures has been attributed to the earlier Roman use of wax to preserve the features of deceased family members (the so-called \"imagines maiorum\"). The wax masks were subsequently reproduced in more durable stone.\n\nThe use of masks in the ancestor cult is also attested in Etruria. Excavations of tombs in the area of the ancient city of Clusium (modern Chiusi, Tuscany) have yielded a number of sheet bronze masks dating from the Etruscan Late Orientalising period. In the 19th century it was thought that they were related to the Mycenaean examples, but whether they served as actual death masks cannot be proven. The most credited hypothesis holds that they were originally fixed to cinerary urns, to give them a human appearance. In Orientalising Clusium, the anthropomorphization of urns was a prevalent phenomenon that was strongly rooted in local religious beliefs.\n\nIn the late Middle Ages, a shift took place from sculpted masks to true death masks, made of wax or plaster. These masks were not interred with the deceased. Instead, they were used in funeral ceremonies and were later kept in libraries, museums, and universities. Death masks were taken not only of deceased royalty and nobility (Henry VIII, Sforza), but also of eminent persons—composers, dramaturges, military and political leaders, philosophers, poets, and scientists, such as Dante Alighieri, Ludwig van Beethoven, Napoleon Bonaparte (whose death mask was taken on the island of Saint Helena), Filippo Brunelleschi, Frédéric Chopin, Oliver Cromwell (whose death mask is preserved at Warwick Castle), Joseph Haydn, John Keats, Franz Liszt, Blaise Pascal, Nikola Tesla (commissioned by his friend Hugo Gernsback and now displayed in the Nikola Tesla Museum), Torquato Tasso, and Voltaire. As in ancient Rome, death masks were often subsequently used in making marble sculpture portraits, busts, or engravings of the deceased.\n\nIn Russia, the death mask tradition dates back to the times of Peter the Great, whose death mask was taken by Carlo Bartolomeo Rastrelli. Also well known are the death masks of Nicholas I, and Alexander I. Stalin's death mask is on display at the Stalin Museum in Gori, Georgia.\n\nOne of the first real Ukrainian death masks was that of the poet Taras Shevchenko, taken by Peter Clodt von Jürgensburg in St. Petersburg, Russia.\n\nIn early spring of 1860 and shortly before his death in April 1865, two life masks were created of President Abraham Lincoln.\n\nDeath masks were increasingly used by scientists from the late 18th century onwards to record variations in human physiognomy. The life mask was also increasingly common at this time, taken from living persons. Anthropologists used such masks to study physiognomic features in famous people and notorious criminals. Masks were also used to collect data on racial differences.\n\nBefore the widespread availability of photography, the facial features of unidentified bodies were sometimes preserved by creating death masks so that relatives of the deceased could recognize them if they were seeking a missing person.\n\nOne mask, known as L'Inconnue de la Seine, recorded the face of an unidentified young woman who, around the age of sixteen, according to one man's story, had been found drowned in the Seine River at Paris, France around the late 1880s. A morgue worker made a cast of her face, saying \"Her beauty was breathtaking, and showed few signs of distress at the time of passing. So bewitching that I knew beauty as such must be preserved.\" The cast was also compared to Mona Lisa, and other famous paintings and sculptures. In the following years, copies of the mask became a fashionable fixture in Parisian Bohemian society.\n\nThe face of Resusci Anne, the world's first CPR training mannequin, introduced in 1960, was modeled after \"L'Inconnue de la Seine\".\n\n\n"}

Roosevelt and Harry S. Truman from 1944 to 1945, and as U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations from 1945 to 1946.\n\nHe was born in Chicago, Illinois on October 22, 1900, the younger of two sons and third of four children of Edward R. Stettinius and Judith Carrington. His mother was a Virginian of colonial English ancestry. His father was of German descent and was a native of St. Louis, Missouri.\n\nThe younger Stettinius grew up in a mansion on the family's estate on Staten Island and graduated from the Pomfret School in 1920 after which he attended the University of Virginia until 1924. He finished very few courses and never took a degree, Instead he spent his time on charitable outreach to poor families. He became a member of the secret Seven Society.\n\nPrematurely white-haired, with dark eyebrows, blue eyes, tanned face, and a quick smile, Stettinius was striking in appearance and inspired goodwill. On May 15, 1926, Stettinius married Virginia Gordon Wallace, daughter of a prominent family of Richmond, Virginia. They had three children: Edward Reilly and twins Wallace and Joseph.\n\nIn 1926, Stettinius began working at General Motors as a stock clerk, but his connections made for rapid advancement. He became assistant to John Lee Pratt, a friend of the family, and by 1931 he had become vice president, in charge of public and industrial relations. At General Motors, he worked to develop unemployment relief programs and came into contact with Franklin Roosevelt.\n\nIn the 1930s, Stettinius's work in the private sector alternated with public service. He served on the Industrial Advisory Board of the National Recovery Administration (1933), but in 1934, he returned to the private sector when he joined U.S. Steel; he eventually become chairman of the nation's largest corporation in 1938.\n\nHe then returned to public service, serving on the National Defense Advisory Commission, as chairman of the War Resources Board (1939) and administrator of the Lend-Lease Program (1941). He held the latter position until he became undersecretary of state in 1943. The poor health of Secretary of State Cordell Hull made him chair the 1944 Dumbarton Oaks Conference and, in December 1944, succeed Hull as Secretary of State. Stettinius was a member of the US delegation to the 1945 Yalta Conference.\n\nTruman thought Stettinius was too soft on communism and had yielded too much to Moscow when he was Roosevelt's advisor at Yalta. Truman had an old Senate friend in mind as a replacement, James F. Byrnes. Stettinius resigned as Secretary of State to take up the position of the first United States Ambassador to the United Nations. He chaired the United States delegation to the United Nations Conference on International Organization held in San Francisco from April 25 to June 26, 1945, which brought together delegates from 50 Allied nations to create the United Nations. Charles W. Yost, who had been Under Secretary of State Stettinius' assistant in the State Department, was named Stettinius' Executive Secretary at the United Nations Conference. Stettinius resigned in June 1946, as he became critical of what he saw as Truman's refusal to use the UN as a tool to resolve tensions with the Soviet Union.\n\nFor three years after his return to private life, he served as rector of the University of Virginia. In 1947, Stettinius and friend William Tubman, the president of Liberia, helped form the Liberia Company, a partnership between the Liberian government and American financiers to provide funds for the development of the African nation. During his retirement, Stettinius lived at his Virginia estate, The Horseshoe, on the Rapidan River. He died of a coronary thrombosis on October 31, 1949, at the home of a sister in Greenwich, Connecticut, at the age of 49, and was buried in the family plot in Locust Valley Cemetery, Locust Valley, New York.\n\nStettinius's voluminous archive of more than 1,000 boxes resides at the Albert and Shirley Small Special Collections Library at the University of Virginia.\n\n\n\n"}

He served as a teacher after his ordination in two different areas until he returned to his hometown towards the end of the devastating World War II to tend to wounded and displaced people. But the fierce fighting between the Nazis and Allies plus the partisan forces saw Comini and fellow priest (and future Servant of God) Nicola Capelli captured and murdered after the Nazis made accusations of the pair being spies.\n\nComini's cause for beatification was introduced in 1995 at which stage he became titled as a Servant of God.\n\nElia Comini was born in Bologna on 7 May 1910 to Claudio Comini (a carpenter) and Emma Limoni (a dressmaker); one brother was Amleto. He was baptized in the local parish church on 8 May. In 1914 the Comini's moved to Casetta in the Salvaro parish in Bologna on the banks of the River Rhine along the Porrettana road.\n\nHe attended the Salesian school in Finale Emilia where he later asked to be admitted into their order. He did his novitiate period in Castel de'Britti from 1925 to 1926 before making his first religious profession on 3 October 1926. His father died sometime during 1926 with the Salvaro archpriest Fidenzio Mellini (who himself knew Saint Giovanni Bosco) acted as a sort of surrogate father. Mellini had in fact predicted that Comini would become a priest and held him in high regard due to his goodness and intellect.\n\nComini completed his studies at the Salesian-run high school in Valsalice in Turin (1926-28) and then graduated in literature from the college in Milan prior to receiving his ordination to the priesthood on 16 March 1935 in the Brescia Cathedral from Bishop Giacinto Tredici. He afterwards served as a teacher at the order's schools in both Chiari in Brescia (1936-41) and Treviglio at the Salesian Aspirantate (1941-44).\n\nIn summer 1944 during World War II he returned to Salvaro to aid his frail mother and to render his aid to the aging Monsignor Mellini. But that area was the epicenter of war between the Nazis and the Allies as well as those partisan forces. To that end he turned his attention to the poor and displaced peoples that the war affected. He made himself available for hearing confessions and for preaching while also using his musical abilities to enliven the people.\n\nHe soon came into contact with fellow priest (and future Servant of God) Nicola Capelli (in religious \"Martino\") and the pair often visited refugees and rendered medical aid to those who were wounded. On 29 September 1944 both he and Capelli were arrested en route to Grizzana where 69 people were about to be massacred. He had just celebrated his last Mass that morning. The Nazi S.S. considered them to be spies and so mistreated the pair and used them to transport their ammunition in terrible conditions. On 30 September he and Capelli spent their time comforting their fellow prisoners. The attempts made to rescue them were useless for Comini said \"either all or none\" even after his friend Commissioner Prefect Emilio Veggetti tried to secure his release.\n\nHe and 44 others were shot dead around dusk on 1 October 1944 in the reservoir of the warehouse of the Industrie Canapiere Italiano. His remains were then cast into the Rhine. Before being shot he and Capelli heard each other's confessions before he granted their fellow hostages absolution in a loud and defiant voice.\n\nThe beatification process was launched under Pope John Paul II on 14 February 1995 after the Congregation for the Causes of Saints accepted a formal application to launch the process (providing the \"nihil obstat\" edict) and titling Comini as a Servant of God. Cardinal Giacomo Biffi inaugurated the diocesan investigation in Bologna on 3 December 1995 and closed it later on 25 November 2001 after documentation had been compiled to support the cause. The C.C.S. later validated the process on 1 October 2004 after receiving the documentation submitted to them; the Positio dossier was then sent to the C.C.S. for assessment in 2009 following its compilation.\n\nTheologians approved the cause with nine affirmative votes in favor at their meeting held on 4 April 2017.\n\nThe current postulator for this cause is the Salesian priest Pierluigi Cameroni.\n\n"}

He avoided being recaptured for nearly two weeks, despite a massive effort using equipment borrowed from the Royal Navy and British Civil Defence. Goldie spent most of the time in Regent's Park, which surrounds the zoo, but he also made excursions into the nearby neighbourhoods of Camden Town, Tottenham Court Road and Euston.\n\nGoldie's escape enthralled the British public. The zoo received thousands of phone calls and letters, and large crowds gathered in Regent's Park to watch the bird's keepers trying to catch him. There were severe traffic jams in the area as drivers circled the park, watching Goldie in flight.\n\nThe saga was closely covered by the media. On a BBC television programme, the reporter John Timpson unsuccessfully tried to lure Goldie by playing an Ethiopian bird pipe. Goldie was also mentioned during a debate in the House of Commons, where Members of Parliament greeted his name with cheers.\n\nWhile free, the predatory bird killed and ate a duck in the garden of the American ambassador to Britain.

Hoffmann-La Roche AG is a Swiss multinational healthcare company that operates worldwide under two divisions: Pharmaceuticals and Diagnostics. Its holding company, Roche Holding AG, has bearer shares listed on the SIX Swiss Exchange. The company headquarters are located in Basel.\n\nThe company controls the American biotechnology company Genentech, which is a wholly owned affiliate, and the Japanese biotechnology company Chugai Pharmaceuticals, as well as the United States-based Ventana. Roche's revenues during fiscal year 2016 were 50.58 billion Swiss francs, or approximately US$51 billion. Roche is the third-largest pharmaceutical company worldwide.\nDescendants of the founding Hoffmann and Oeri families own slightly over half of the bearer shares with voting rights (a pool of family shareholders 45%, and Maja Oeri a further 5% apart), with Swiss pharma firm Novartis owning a further third of its shares. Roche is one of the few companies increasing their dividend every year, for 2016 as the 30th consecutive year. F. Hoffmann-La Roche is a full member of the European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations (EFPIA).\n\nFounded in 1896 by Fritz Hoffmann-La Roche, the company was early on known for producing various vitamin preparations and derivatives. In 1934, it became the first company to mass-produce synthetic vitamin C, under the brand name Redoxon. In 1957 it introduced the class of tranquilizers known as benzodiazepines (with Valium and Rohypnol being the best known members). It manufactures and sells several cancer drugs and is a leader in this field. In 1956, the first antidepressant, iproniazid, was accidentally created during an experiment while synthesizing isoniazid. Originally, it had been intended to create a more efficient drug at combatting Tuberculosis. Iproniazid, however, revealed to have its own benefits; some people felt it made them feel happier. It was withdrawn from the market in the early 1960s due to toxic side-effects.\n\nIn 1976, an accident at a chemical factory in Seveso, Italy, owned by a subsidiary of Roche, caused a large dioxin contamination; see Seveso disaster. In 1982, the United States arm of the company acquired Biomedical Reference Laboratories for US$163.5 million. That company dated from the late 1960s, and was located in Burlington, North Carolina. That year Hoffmann–La Roche then merged it with all of its laboratories, and incorporated the merged company as Roche Biomedical Laboratories, Inc. in Burlington. By the early 1990s, Roche Biomedical became one of the largest clinical laboratory networks in the United States, with 20 major laboratories and US$600 million in sales.\n\nRoche has also produced various HIV tests and antiretroviral drugs. It bought the patents for the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique in 1992. In 1995 the era of highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART) was initiated by the United States FDA's approval of Hoffman LaRoche's HIV protease inhibitor saquinavir. Within 2 years of its approval (and that of ritonavir 4 months later) annual deaths from AIDS in the United States fell from over 50,000 to approximately 18,000 On 28 April 1995 Hoffmann–La Roche sold Roche Biomedical Laboratories, Inc. to National Health Laboratories Holdings Inc. (which then changed its name to Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings). Roche acquired Syntex in 1994 and Chugai Pharmaceuticals in 2002.\n\nOseltamivir is considered to be the primary antiviral drug used to combat avian influenza, commonly known as the bird flu. Roche is the only drug company authorized to manufacture the drug, which was discovered by Gilead Sciences. Roche purchased the rights to the drug in 1996 and in 2005 settled a royalty dispute, agreeing to pay Gilead tiered royalties of 14–22% of annual net sales without adjusting the payments for manufacturing costs, as had been allowedin the original licensing agreement.\n\nOn 20 October 2005, Hoffmann–La Roche decided to license other companies to manufacture Oseltamivir.\n\nAlso in 2005, Roche acquired the Swiss company GlycArt Biotechnology in order to acquire technology to afucosylate antibodies; one of its products in development was obinutuzumab, which gained FDA approval in November 2013 for the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia.\n\nOn 22 January 2008, Roche acquired Ventana Medical Systems for $3.4 billion. On 2 January 2009, Roche acquired Memory Pharmaceuticals Corp. On 26 March, Roche acquired Genentech for $46.8 billion.\n\nOn 12 March 2009 Roche agreed to fully acquire Genentech, in which it had held a majority stake since 1990, after 8 months of negotiations. As a result of the Genentech acquisition, Roche closed its Palo Alto based research facilities and moved them to their campus that straddles the border between Clifton, New Jersey and Nutley, New Jersey while Roche's United States headquarters, located on the site since 1929, was moved to Genentech's facility in South San Francisco. Genentech became a wholly owned subsidiary group of Roche on 25 March 2009.\n\nOn 13 April, Roche acquired Medingo Ltd., for $160 million. In August, Roche acquired BioImagene, Inc., for $100 million. \n\nIn 2011, the company received the ISPE Facility of the Year Award for Process Innovation for Roche’s \"MyDose\" Clinical Supply project. In March 2011, Roche acquired PVT Probenverteiltechnik GmbH for up to €85 million. In July 2010, Roche acquired mtm laboratories AG for up to 190 million EUR. On October, Roche acquired Anadys Pharmaceuticals, Inc. for $230 million. In December, Roche announced it would acquire Munich-based Verum Diagnostica GmbH, gaining entry to the fastest-growing field in the coagulation diagnostics market.\n\nOn 26 June 2012, Roche announced the closure of the Nutley/Clifton campus, which was completed in 2013. The property is in the process of remediation. \n\nIn July 2013, Roche Diagnostics acquired blood diagnostics company Constitution Medical Inc. for $220 million.

On 2 June, Roche announced its intention to acquire Genia Technologies Inc. for up to $350 million. In August 2014, the company agreed to purchase Californian-based pharmaceutical firm InterMune for $8.3 billion, at $74 a share this represents a 38% premium over the final share closing price, as well as Santaris Pharma A/S for $450 million. In December 2014, the company acquired next-generation sequencing processing company Bina Technologies for an undisclosed sum and Dutalys GmbH a developer of next-generation anti-bodies.\n\nOn 16 January 2015, the company announced that they would acquire Trophos for €470 million ($543 million) in order to increase the company's neuromuscular disease presence. The deal will centre on the Phase II and III spinal muscular atrophy drug olesoxime (TRO19622).In April 2015, Roche acquired CAPP Medical, and its chief development of technology for cancer screening and monitoring via the detection of circulating tumor DNA.\n\nIn August, the company announced its intention to acquire GeneWEAVE BioSciences, Inc. for up to $425 million in order to strengthen its microbial diagnostics business. Days later the company acquired Kapa Biosystems, Inc. focussing on next generation sequencing and polymerase chain reaction applications.

In June, the company acquired the diabetes management platform, mySugr GmbH for an undisclosed price. In November Roche acquired Viewics, Inc. In late December the company announced it would acquire Ignyta Inc, expanding its global oncology business.\n\nIn February 2018, Roche announced it would acquire Flatiron Health, a business specialising in US cancer data analytics, for $1.9 billion. In June of the same year the company announced it would acquire the outstanding shares of Foundation Medicine for $2.4 billion ($137 per share). Later in September Roche announced its intention to acquire Tusk Therapeutics for up to €655 million ($759 million) expanding Roche's oncology pipeline. Tusk announced that the anti-CD38 antibody it is developing will be spun off to form a new company, Black Belt Therapeutics. In late November, the company announced that Genentech would acquire Jecure Therapeutics, gaining access to Jecure's portfolio of NLRP3 inhibitors developed to fight inflammatory diseases like non-alcoholic steatohepatitis and liver fibrosis.\n\nThe following is an illustration of the company's major mergers and acquisitions and historical predecessors (this is not a comprehensive list):\n\nHoffmann-La Roche is strong in the field pharmaceuticals for cancer treatment, against virus diseases and for treatment of metabolic diseases.

Roche was fined accordingly, but a bungle on the part of the EEC allowed the company to discover that it was Adams who had blown the whistle. He was arrested for unauthorised disclosure — an offence under Swiss law — and imprisoned. His wife, having learnt that he might face decades in jail, committed suicide.\n\nIn 1999 the firm pleaded guilty to participation in a worldwide conspiracy to raise and fix prices for vitamins sold in the US and globally. Hoffmann-La Roche paid $500 million in criminal fines to the United States.\n\nIn addition to internal research and development activities F. Hoffmann–La Roche is also involved in publicly funded collaborative research projects, with other industrial and academic partners. One example in the area of non-clinical safety assessment is the InnoMed PredTox. The company is expanding its activities in joint research projects within the framework of the Innovative Medicines Initiative of EFPIA and the European Commission.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "216174", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=216174", "title": "Homeothermy", "text": "Homeothermy\n\nHomeothermy or homothermy is thermoregulation that maintains a stable internal body temperature regardless of external influence. This internal body temperature is often, though not necessarily, higher than the immediate environment (from Greek ὅμοιος \"homoios\" \"similar\" and θέρμη \"thermē\" \"heat\"). Homeothermy is one of the three types of thermo regulation in warm-blooded animal species. Homeothermy's opposite is poikilothermy.\n\nHomeotherms are \"not\" necessarily endothermic. Some homeotherms may maintain constant body temperatures through behavioral mechanisms alone, \"i.e.\", behavioral thermoregulation. Many reptiles use this strategy. For example, desert lizards are remarkable in that they maintain near-constant activity temperatures that are often within a degree or two of their lethal critical temperatures.\n\nEnzymes have a relatively narrow temperature range at which their efficiencies are optimal. Temperatures outside this range can greatly reduce the rate of a reaction or stop it altogether. A creature with a fairly constant body temperature can therefore specialize in enzymes which are efficient at that particular temperature. A poikilotherm must either operate well below optimum efficiency most of the time, migrate, hibernate or expend extra resources producing a wider range of enzymes to cover the wider range of body temperatures.\n\nHowever, some environments offer much more consistent temperatures than others. For example, the tropics often have seasonal variations in temperature that are smaller than their diurnal variations. In addition, large bodies of water, such as the ocean and very large lakes, have moderate temperature variations. The waters below the ocean surface are particularly stable in temperature.\n\nBecause many homeothermic animals use enzymes that are specialized for a narrow range of body temperatures, hypothermia rapidly leads to torpor and then death. Additionally, homeothermy obtained from endothermy is a high energy strategy and many environments will offer lower carrying capacity to these organisms. In cold weather the energy expenditure to maintain body temperature accelerates starvation and may lead to death.\n\n"}

As a child, he became obsessed with the films of director Elia Kazan. When, aged 11, he found out that Kazan had started his career as an actor and stage manager, he decided to do the same. Following the death of his mother, he left school when he was 15. He was accepted as a student assistant stage manager at Salford Repertory where he soon started taking on small acting roles. Seasons at Liverpool Playhouse, Newcastle Playhouse and Manchester Library Theatre followed.\n\nAged 20, Hazeldine made his London debut at the Royal Court Theatre in Sloane Square. Initially hired to understudy as Cliff in \"Look Back In Anger\", Hazeldine soon started taking on small roles in Edward Bond's \"Narrow Road to the Deep North\" and \"Early Morning\". He worked constantly at the Royal Court during the 1969-70 season. Spotting Hazeldine's potential, Peter Gill then cast him in his play \"Over Gardens Out\" and went on to direct him in \"Crete and Sergeant Pepper\" by John Antrobus.\n\nAlthough Hazeldine was rarely cast in starring roles, he became noted as an exceptionally honest and truthful actor who after his inductory season at the Royal Court was regularly seen in new plays, e.g. \"The Old Ones\" by Arnold Wesker, \"The Foursome\" by EA Whitehead and \"Cato Street\" by Peter Gill. In 1981 he joined the Royal Shakespeare Company for a season to appear in productions of \"Troilus and Cressida\", \"Timon of Athens\", \"Richard III\" and Edward Bond's play \"The Fool\".\n\nIn 1984 Hazeldine made his Broadway debut as Sam Evans in \"Strange Interlude\" with Glenda Jackson. He returned to New York in 1998 when he played Harry Hope in \"The Iceman Cometh\" starring Kevin Spacey. His last stage performance was that of the guilt-ridden Joe Keller in Arthur Miller's \"All My Sons\" (2000), praised by John Peter of the \"Sunday Times\" as \"the subtlest and most harrowing performance of his career.\"\n\nHazeldine was also a prolific television actor who is probably best known for his role as firefighter Mike \"Bayleaf\" Wilson in the LWT drama \"London's Burning\". He played the role from 1986 to 1996 and also directed some episodes.\n\nOther major TV roles include that of Frank Barraclough in the 1973-75 drama series \"Sam\" and the role of journalist Tom Crane in the 1979 paranormal thriller series \"The Omega Factor\". He also starred in the children's series \"Chocky\" (1984) and its sequels \"Chocky's Children\" (1985) and \"Chocky's Challenge\" (1986), all scripted by one of \"The Omega Factor's\" writers, Anthony Read. In 1983 he played the part of Kidder in Willy Russell's five part Channel 4 drama \"One Summer\", also starring David Morrissey. In the later 1980s Hazeldine had major roles in two BBC comedy dramas: as haulage firm owner Picard in \"Truckers\" (1987) and as Bernie in\" Streets Apart\" (1988–89). In 1999, he played Austin Danforth in the ITV drama \"The Last Train\" and in 2001 he appeared as Ivan Braithwaite in \"\".\n\nHazeldine also appeared in Granada Television's production of \"The Musgrave Ritual\", as part of ITV's \"The Return of Sherlock Holmes\" series, as Richard Brunton, alongside Jeremy Brett, as well as the \"Miss Marple\" story \"The Murder at the Vicarage\", as Lawrence Redding, alongside Joan Hickson, Paul Eddington and Cheryl Campbell. Shortly before he died, Hazeldine played DI Stan Egerton in the ITV television drama \"Shipman\" (2002).\n\nHis film credits are less numerous. Hazeldine made his screen debut as Stalin in \"Nicholas and Alexandra\" (1971). His credits also include \"The National Health\" (1973), \"The Medusa Touch\" (1978) and \"Pink Floyd – The Wall\" (1982).\n\nAt the time of his death Hazeldine was appearing at the Cottesloe Theatre as Sigmund Freud in Christopher Hampton's play \"The Talking Cure\". He was taken ill on 10 December 2002, the day after having performed in a preview of the play.\n\nHe died one week later of aortic dissection, caused by complications from a triple heart bypass he had received six months earlier. Following Hazeldine's death, Trevor Nunn, director of the Royal National Theatre, described him as \"a leading actor of minutely observed truthfulness, comic brio and emotional daring\" who \"was also a man of infectious enthusiasm, great warmth and humanity who was universally popular amongst his colleagues\".\n\n\n\n"}

She was allegedly married to Munir Khan, a member of the banned Bangladeshi Harkat-ul-Jihad al-Islami. Khan, along with some members of her family, was allegedly shot dead in 2011 in Maharashtra.\n\nKhan allegedly supplied the Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), a terrorist organization was planning an attack, with information on the city of Mumbai.\n\nOn the night of 30 January 2011, Khan, accompanied by her mother Shelina, older sister Hashmina, twin siblings Imran and Zara, and cousin Rehshma, drove out of Mumbai towards their holiday home in Igatpuri, 126 km north of Mumbai. On 9 February 2011, Khans's mother spoke with her sister, Albana Patel, and said that Khan was in Chandigarh with her third husband Pervez Iqbal Tak. After this, the family vanished without a trace.\n\nSubsequently, Khans's father, Nadir Shah Patel (Shelina's first husband), filed a complaint at a Mumbai police station stating that his daughter had gone missing along with other members of her family. A similar complaint was also filed by Bollywood film director Rakesh Sawant, who was shooting his second film Jinnat with Khan just before she disappeared from Mumbai.\nNadir Shah Patel has appealed to the Bombay High Court on 17 July 2012 seeking transfer of her daughter's murder case from Crime Branch to CBI, alleging that the former did not probe the case promptly.\n\nKhan's step-fathers, Parvez Iqbal Tak, a suspected Lashkar-e-Taiba member, and Asif Sheikh (Shelina's second husband), were suspected of being behind Khan and her family's disappearance. Police also questioned Nadir Shah Patel during the investigation.\n\nParvez Iqbal Tak was arrested by the Jammu and Kashmir Police in connection with another case on 21 June 2012. During interrogation Tak admitted that Khan and some members of her family were shot dead in Maharashtra in February 2011. The next day Tak retracted his story, claiming instead that Khan and her family were still alive. The Crime Branch of Mumbai Police investigating the kidnapping case brought Tak to Mumbai, where he was produced before Esplanade Court, Southern Mumbai on 10 July 2012. The Court sent Tak to Police custody until 19 July. Confessing before the Crime Branch, Tak changed his statement for a third time, claiming instead, that he intended to kill Khan's mother Shelina for continuously humiliating him, and for having relationship with other men. Tak told interrogators that he, along with his associates killed Khan and her five family members and buried their bodies behind her Igatpuri bungalow. He allegedly killed all of them as Khan had witnessed her mother's murder. Owing to Tak's continuously changing statements, the Mumbai Police was reluctant to place full reliance on his testimony. Tak was taken to Igatpuri to corroborate the claims he made during his interrogation.\n\nAsif Sheikh was arrested from Bangalore. Sheikh confessed that he and Tak shot and killed Khan and her family. Asif Sheikh's name was revealed as one of the co-conspirators by Parvez Tak in his earlier confession before the Jammu and Kashmir Police.\n\nWhile examining Khan's Igatpuri bungalow, the Police investigation team found six buried bodies, believed to be those of Khan and her family members.\n\nIt is believed that money, jealousy, property and possible shifting of the family to Dubai were the cause of the family murder. Investigation of Tak revealed that he intended to flee to Nepal where his Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) connections would have helped him to avoid arrest. He was, however, arrested by J&K police in another case, before he could flee to Nepal.\n\nThe Police has also detained two persons - Jolly Guilder and Mehboob, who Tak had hired to drive Khan's car from Igatpuri to Indore and onward to Delhi, and finally to Kishtwar where it was eventually recovered.\n\nAs a part of their investigations, police are likely to open Khan's bank locker and scan three bank accounts of the family.\nIn November 2012, based on a DNA test report crime branch officer claimed that the remains discovered at Khan's Igatpuri farmhouse belonged to her and her relatives.\n\n"}

LVQ is the supervised counterpart of vector quantization systems.\n\nLVQ can be understood as a special case of an artificial neural network, more precisely, it applies a winner-take-all Hebbian learning-based approach. It is a precursor to self-organizing maps (SOM) and related to neural gas, and to the k-nearest neighbor algorithm (k-NN). LVQ was invented by Teuvo Kohonen.\n\nAn LVQ system is represented by prototypes formula_1 which are defined in the feature space of observed data. In winner-take-all training algorithms one determines, for each data point, the prototype which is closest to the input according to a given distance measure. The position of this so-called winner prototype is then adapted, i.e. the winner is moved closer if it correctly classifies the data point or moved away if it classifies the data point incorrectly.\n\nAn advantage of LVQ is that it creates prototypes that are easy to interpret for experts in the respective application domain.\nLVQ systems can be applied to multi-class classification problems in a natural way. \nIt is used in a variety of practical applications. See http://liinwww.ira.uka.de/bibliography/Neural/SOM.LVQ.html\nfor an extensive bibliography.\n\nA key issue in LVQ is the choice of an appropriate measure of distance or similarity for training and classification. Recently, techniques have been developed which adapt a parameterized distance measure in the course of training the system, see e.g. (Schneider, Biehl, and Hammer, 2009) and references therein.\n\nLVQ can be a source of great help in classifying text documents.\n\nBelow follows an informal description.<br>\nThe algorithm consists of 3 basic steps.

{"id": "1179733", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1179733", "title": "Live A Live", "text": "Live A Live\n\n\"Live A Live\"s story begins with a series of seven seemingly unrelated chapters that can be played in any order, based on popular genres such as Western, science fiction, and mecha. Each chapter has its own plot, setting, and characters. Although the basic gameplay is the same throughout the game, every chapter has its own unique gimmick, such as the stealth elements in the ninja chapter. After the first seven chapters are completed, the game's final sequence plays out, linking the previous chapters together and resolving the story.\n\n\"Live A Live\" contains the basic elements of a role-playing video game. The characters explore dungeons, towns, or similar areas, fight enemies, and gain experience points to level up. However, the game eschews some elements typical of the genre, such as magic points and money.\n\nThe game has turn-based, tactical battles that play out on a grid. Certain attacks can change tiles into damage zones. More powerful skills often have long charge times, which commits the character to that single attack for a long time, and gives the enemy an opportunity to interrupt them. Characters can be inflicted with status ailments, and certain items, attacks, and skills can raise or lower a character or enemy's stats while in battle. When a character's hit points reach zero, they collapse and are unable to move, but can be revived by using a healing item or spell. However, if they are hit when in the knocked-out state, they permanently disappear from the battle.\n\nIn addition to these basic gameplay mechanics, each chapter contains some variations on the standard formula.\n\n\"Live A Live\" has a large number of characters. The main character of the prehistoric chapter, Pogo (ポゴ), is a young caveman who has just come of age, who is only capable of saying the word \"love\". Master Xin Shan Quan (心山拳老師, \"Shinzanken-roushi\", \"Xīn Shān Quán-lǎoshī\") is an old kung-fu master seeking to pass on his art before he dies; his three pupils are an obese yet agile man named Sammo Hakka (サモ・ハッカ \"Samo Hakka\"), a female bandit named Li Kuugo (レイ・クウゴ \"Rei Kuugo\"), and a boy named Yuan Jou (ユン・ジョウ \"Yun Jou\") who stood up to the local gangsters. Oboro-maru (おぼろ丸) is a ninja of the Enma with great potential sent on an important mission. The Sundown Kid (サンダウン・キッド \"Sandaun Kiddo\") is a wandering cowboy famous for his skill with a gun. Masaru Takahara (高原 日勝 \"Takahara Masaru\") is a wrestler with the dream of being the strongest fighter in the world who possesses a strong sense of justice. Akira Tadokoro (田所 晃 \"Tadokoro Akira\") is an orphan in the near future with psychic powers. Cube (キューブ \"Kyūbu\") is a self-aware robot created by the mechanic Kato (カトゥー \"Katū\") aboard the spaceship Cogito Ergosum. Oersted (オルステッド \"Orusuteddo\") is a famous knight in the realm of Lucretia, betrothed to the King's only daughter. Odio (オディオ \"Odio\"), whose name is Latin for hate, is the Demon King and the main antagonist of the game.\n\nThe first seven chapters can be played in any order, and the final two chapters open up after they are completed.\n\nIn prehistoric times, a tribe of cavemen prepares to sacrifice a woman named Bel (べる \"Beru\") to their deity, a living Tyrannosaurus rex named O-D-O (おーでぃーおー \"Ōdīō\"). She escapes to the south and hides in a cave belonging to another tribe, stealing their food to survive. She is discovered by a young caveman named Pogo, who falls in love with her and decides to help her hide from the rest of the tribe. The northern tribe attacks to retrieve her, but Pogo repels them. However, Bel is discovered in the process, and the elder exiles them. Eventually, Pogo is forced to fight O-D-O, and is assisted by a warrior of the northern tribe named Zaki (ざき). After the beast is defeated, peace is established between the two tribes and the first word, \"Love\", is said.\n\nIn ancient China, an old kung-fu master of the Xin Shan Quan tradition takes on three students to pass on his art before he dies. While the master is away one day, the dojo is attacked by a rival dojo seeking revenge for an insult. Two of the students are killed (the surviving student being the one the player trained the most), prompting the master and the surviving student to avenge their deaths. The rival school, led by Odi Wang Lee (オディワン・リー \"Odiwan Rī\"), is defeated, but the master dies afterward, having used the last of his strength in the fight. The student succeeds him as master of the tradition and takes a new generation of students.\n\nIn feudal Japan, a mysterious figure named Ode Iou (尾手 院王 \"Ode Iō\") is trying to throw Japan into chaos. The ninja clan Enma sends one of their ninja named Oboro-maru to rescue a prisoner who can stabilize Japan, then kill Ode Iou. After being rescued, the prisoner joins Oboro in the battle with Ode Iou. After Ode Iou is slain, the prisoner reveals that he is Sakamoto Ryōma. Oboro is then given the choice of returning to the Enma or joining Ryōma in his plans to rebuild Japan.\n\nThis chapter takes place in the American Old West. An outlaw called the Sundown Kid and his rival, a bounty hunter named Mad Dog (マッド・ドッグ \"Maddo Doggu\"), arrive in Success Town, a place terrorized by a group of bandits called the Crazy Bunch (クレイジー・バンチ \"Kureijī Banchi\"), led by O. Dio (O・ディオ \"O Dio\"), the last remaining survivor of the 7th Cavalry. Sundown stands up to the bandits, and they decide to raze the town in retaliation. Mad Dog agrees to help Sundown and the townsfolk prepare the town's defenses. After the town emerges from the battle victorious, Mad Dog challenges Sundown to one final duel. The player has the option of killing Mad Dog or running away.\n\n\"The Strongest\" is set in the present day. Masaru Takahara strives to become the strongest fighter in the world by fighting the masters of different fighting disciplines to learn their techniques. However, another fighter, Odie Oldbright (オディ・オブライト \"Odi Oburaito\"), has the same idea, but deliberately kills each of his opponents during the fight. He then challenges Masaru, who defeats him.\n\nIn the near future in Japan, a biker gang called the Crusaders has been kidnapping people with unknown intentions. A young orphan with psychic powers named Akira Tadokoro grows up in an orphanage with his sister. One day, the Crusaders kidnap one of the children from the orphanage, so Akira and his friend Matsu (無法松 \"Muhoumatsu\") set out to rescue him. Akira learns the location of the Crusaders' base, and discovers a plot by the Japanese government to liquefy people and use them to power a giant idol named Odeo (御出居). Matsu then sacrifices himself to power an ancient mech called Buriki Daioh (ブリキ大王 \"Buriki Daiō\", \"Tin-Plated Great King\"), which Akira uses to destroy Odeo.\n\nIn the distant future, a space ship called Cogito Ergosum is returning to earth carrying a dangerous alien called the Behemoth (ベヒーモス \"Behīmosu\"). The mechanic, Kato, creates a spherical robot and gives it the ironic name of Cube. The player takes the role of Cube as it explores the ship and meets the crew. However, things begin to go wrong as the ship malfunctions and a crew member named Kirk (カーク \"Kāku\") dies in a freak accident. Soon, the Behemoth is released, and it kills more crew members. The remaining crew members continue to blame and mistrust one another, but it is finally revealed that the culprit is the ship's computer, OD-10. Cube hacks into the computer and defeats it.\n\nAfter completing the first seven chapters, the medieval chapter is unlocked. A brave knight named Oersted, a hero beloved by the people, defeats his best friend, the wizard Straybow (ストレイボウ \"Sutoreibou\"), in the final round of a fighting tournament, winning the right to marry Princess Alicia (アリシア \"Arishia\") of Lucretia (ルクレツィア \"Rukuretsia\"). That night, she is kidnapped by the Demon King (魔王 \"Maō\"). The next day, Oersted and Straybow set out to rescue her. First, they find the heroes who defeated the Demon King thirty years prior, the knight Hash (ハッシュ \"Hasshu\") and the priest Uranus (ウラヌス \"Uranusu\"), and convince them to join. They fight and defeat the Demon King, but Hash dies due to a plague, Alicia is nowhere to be found, and Straybow is seemingly killed by falling rocks. Oersted and Uranus return to Lucretia in defeat. That night, Oersted is tricked into slaying the King of Lucretia by an apparition of the Demon King after seeing what looks like Straybow exit his room. He is accused of being the Demon King himself, and he is later imprisoned. Uranus, who is also imprisoned for being a \"demon ally\", uses the last of his strength to help him escape. Oersted returns to the mountain of the Demon King and finds Straybow alive, having faked his own death. Straybow reveals that, out of jealousy for Oersted, he sold his soul to become the next Demon King, and tricked Oersted into killing the King. Oersted is forced to kill him. He then rescues Alicia, but she confesses her love for Straybow and blames Oersted's heroism for Straybow's fall to evil, before killing herself. Oersted is driven insane by his rage and grief, sacrifices his soul to become the next Demon King, and names himself Odio, deciding to teach humans \"the folly of their selfishness\". He then takes revenge on all of Lucretia, killing everything.\n\nIn the final chapter, Oersted summons the protagonists of the first seven chapters to Lucretia, which is now colorless and depopulated, for a final battle. The player's chosen hero meets and recruits the other six heroes. During their exploration of Lucretia, they can encounter Straybow, who laments what his jealousy had caused. Once ready, the group confronts Odio, who questions the heroes' motives, and then transforms into a monster to fight them. Once defeated, he reverts to his human form, and asks the hero to kill him. The hero refuses, so Oersted attacks again, forcing each hero to fight the incarnation of Odio from their chapter. After the heroes win again, Oersted is unable to understand why he cannot win. The hero explains what he or she fights for to Oersted—each one having a different reason. He is finally moved, and so agrees to return them all to where they came from. He warns the heroes that anyone can become a demon with enough hatred before dying, and Lucretia is restored.\n\nIf the player chooses Oersted as the final chapter's lead character, he will take control of the seven different incarnations of Odio in each chapter in turn. If he defeats each of the heroes, he is left to wander in an empty Lucretia. Alternately, he can choose to cause armageddon once an incarnation becomes low on health, destroying all of space-time instantly.\n\nThe characters of each of the game's chapters were illustrated by a group of different manga artists involving Yoshihide Fujiwara, Yoshinori Kobayashi, Osamu Ishiwata, Yumi Tamura, Ryōji Minagawa, Gosho Aoyama and Kazuhiko Shimamoto.\n\n\"Live A Live's\" soundtrack was composed by Yoko Shimomura. The \"Live A Live Original Sound Version\", a single CD containing 41 songs, was released on August 25, 1994. A promotional Mini CD was included with the \"Live A Live Perfect Strategy Guide Book.\" It contained two arranged medley tracks, and was released on October 21, 1994. Both items were published by NTT Publishing. In 2008, the tracks \"The Bird Flies in the Sky, the Fish Swims in the River\" and \"Forgotten Wings\" were included on \"Drammatica: The Very Best of Yoko Shimomura\", a compilation of the composer's work at Square Enix.\n\nOn release, \"Famicom Tsūshin\" scored the game a 29 out of 40. In 2011, \"GamePro\" included it on the list of the 14 best JRPGs that were not released in English, adding that \"rumor has it the game was originally slated for a US release, making its absence here sting all the more.\"\n\nThe songs \"Birds in the Sky, Fish in the River\" and \"Megalomania\" appear in the rhythm action game \"\", as playable songs through downloadable content. When playing \"Megalomania\", the music stage features the Demon King's mountain, with Oersted and Straybow confronting each other in the background.\n\n"}

She succeeded to the title of suo jure Countess of Soissons, on 18 February 1397, upon the death of her father, Enguerrand VII de Coucy. In addition to her titles, she also owned numerous estates in North-Eastern France. She was the wife of Henry of Bar, and the granddaughter of King Edward III of England and Philippa of Hainault.\n\nMarie was born in April 1366 at Coucy Castle, Picardy, France. She was the eldest daughter of a powerful French nobleman, Enguerrand VII de Coucy, and Isabella of England, daughter of King Edward III of England and Philippa of Hainault. She had a younger sister, Philippa de Coucy (1367–1411), who married Robert de Vere, 9th Earl of Oxford, Marquess of Dublin, Duke of Ireland.\n\nWhen Marie was about a month old, she accompanied her parents to England, where on 11 May 1366 her father received the title of Earl of Bedford and was inducted into the Order of the Garter. In 1376 at the age of ten, Marie joined the household of the French queen, Joanna of Bourbon and was educated alongside the Dauphin and his siblings.\n\nIn November 1384, she married Henry of Bar, Marquis de Pont-à-Mousson, son of Robert I, Duke of Bar and Marie of Valois, sister of King Charles V of France. The marriage produced two sons: \n\nBy the 15th century, Marie and her husband Henry moved to the Château de Condé, which had been in the Coucy family since the end of the 12th century.\n\nMarie's mother, Isabella, died in 1379. Her father, Enguerrand, remarried in February 1386 to Isabelle, the daughter of John I, Duke of Lorraine. Upon Enguerrand's death on 18 February 1397 in a Turkish prison at Bursa, Anatolia, five months after the ferocious Battle of Nicopolis, Marie inherited his title and became the \"suo jure\" Countess of Soissons. Near the end of that same year, she was widowed. Her husband Henry was also taken prisoner at the Battle of Nicopolis and later ransomed. In October 1397, on the lengthy journey home to France, Henry of Bar died at the Crusaders' camp in Treviso after having contracted the plague during his sojourn in Venice. He was buried at the convent of the Celestines in Paris.\n\nMarie disputed the wealthy de Coucy inheritance with her stepmother, with Marie claiming the entire inheritance, while Isabelle insisted upon receiving half. Neither of them yielded. The rich barony was described as \"having castles of grandeur, with its 150 towns and villages, its famous forests, fine ponds, many good vassals, much great nobility and inestimable revenues\". The women lived in mutual hostility, each in a separate castle of the domain, with her own captains and entourage of relatives, both of them endlessly pursuing lawsuits. \n\nMarie was coerced by Louis d'Orléans into selling the barony to him in 1404. She brought at least eleven lawsuits against Orléans in an attempt to recover her property, but following a wedding feast which she had attended in 1405, Marie died suddenly. There were persistent rumours that she had been poisoned, but nothing could be proven to substantiate the allegations. Her son Robert continued the litigation, but eventually, the barony of Coucy passed to the French Crown.\n\n"}
{"id": "358669", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=358669", "title": "Marsupilami", "text": "Marsupilami\n\nMarsupilami is a comic book character created by André Franquin, first published on 31 January 1952 in the Franco-Belgian comics magazine \"Spirou\". Since then it appeared regularly in the popular Belgian comics series \"Spirou et Fantasio\" until Franquin stopped working on the series in 1968 and the character dropped out soon afterward. In the late 1980s, the Marsupilami got its own successful spin-off series of comic albums, \"Marsupilami\", written by Greg, Yann and Dugomier and drawn by Batem, launching the publishing house Marsu Productions. Later, two animated shows featuring this character, as well as the \"Marsupilami\" Sega Genesis video game and a variety of other merchandise followed. The asteroid 98494 Marsupilami is named in its honour.\n\nThe name is a portmanteau of the words \"marsupial\", \"Pilou-Pilou\" (the French name for Eugene the Jeep, a character Franquin loved as a kid) and \"ami\", French for \"friend\".\n\nMarsupilami's adventures had been translated to several languages, like Dutch, German, Greek, Catalan, Spanish, Portuguese and several Scandinavian languages. More than three million albums of the \"Marsupilami\" series are claimed to have been sold by Marsu Productions.\n\nOne album of \"Spirou and Fantasio\" featuring Marsupilami, number 15, was translated to English by Fantasy Flight Publishing in 1995, although it is currently out of print. Plans on releasing number 16 ended halfway through the translation process, due to bad sales. In 2007, Egmont's subsidiary Euro Books translated albums number 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 and 14 for the Indian market.\n\nIn 2013, Dupuis bought Marsu Productions and its characters, thereby allowing a new production of Spirou and Fantasio adventures including Marsupilami.\n\nThe marsupilami is a black-spotted yellow monkey-like creature with dog-like ears. Male marsupilamis have an incredibly long, strong, flexible, prehensile tail, used for almost any task. Female marsupilamis have a much shorter tail, but still long compared to real animals. Both the male and female are able to use their tail as a weapon, by tightening the end into a fist and the remainder of the tail into a spring-like spiral for maximal force. This attack was responsible for the Danish and Norwegian translators choosing words similar to \"spiral\" over \"marsupial\" as the creature's name. Unlike the males, the females also walk on the tips of their toes. When the animal rebounds, he makes the noise: \"Boing\". Males also have eyes that are not completely separate while females have two separate eyes. Female marsupilamis also have a totally different voice than the males. Males say \"houba\" most of the time, while females say \"houbii\". According to the \"L'Encyclopédie du Marsupilami\", they are monotremes like the platypus and echidna, which explains why they lay eggs while having mammalian features.\n\n\"The Marsupilami\" refers originally to the individual captured and then adopted by Spirou and Fantasio, which they never bothered to name because he was the only known specimen. The \"Spirou et Fantasio\" album \"Le nid des Marsupilamis\" is mostly concerned with a documentary-within-the-comic about the life of a family of marsupilamis still living in the wild in Palombia. The spin-off comics later drawn by Batem star those, and the title of the series now refers to the - also unnamed - father in this family, and not to Spirou's original Marsupilami.\n\nIn these series, Marsupilami's wife is referred to as Marsupilamie (a female version of the name) but their three young are named, respectively, Bibi, Bibu and Bobo. Mars le noir (\"Mars the Black\") is another specimen, which first appears in the album \"Mars le Noir\". A former captive marsupilami, he first finds it hard to live again in the forest. After failing to seduce Marsupilamie, he becomes jealous of Marsupilami and nearly gets into a fight with him. Later, he meets a black female marsupilami, named Vénus, who becomes his mate. In \"Baby Prinz\", another specimen, an elderly male who lives in a zoo, is featured. Altogether, that comes to eight specimens in Palombia, plus Spirou and Fantasio's pet. Marsupilamis can come in colours of yellow, yellow with black spots, dark blue, white, white with black spots, and dark blue with yellow spots. They can also be black. Only the yellow, yellow with black spots and dark blue marsupilami's show up in cartoon.\n\nThese albums of \"Spirou and Fantasio\" feature the Marsupilami\n\nBy the late 1960s, Franquin decided to retire from drawing the \"Spirou et Fantasio\" series, which was passed to a new artist, Jean-Claude Fournier. Franquin did not give permission for the character to continue appearing in the series after the first Fournier story, \"Le faiseur d'or\" (\"The Gold Maker\"), in which he drew the Marsupilami himself. Spirou's Marsupilami did not feature in comics after that.\n\nIn 1987 however, Franquin launched the Marsupilami series with the new publishing house, Marsu Productions, with Greg and Batem. This series featured the Marsupilami family which had appeared in \"Le nid des Marsupilamis\". Later, Greg abandoned the series, and other collaborators were chosen by Franquin, such as Yann, Fauche and Adam. The first published album of the series is \"La Queue du Marsupilami\". In 2002, an album #0 was published, consisting of short stories featuring the Marsupilami, drawn by Franquin before 1987. The series, drawn by Batem, has survived André Franquin.\n\n\nDisney's version of the Marsupilami first appeared on television in \"Raw Toonage\" in 1992, and was then spun off into his own eponymous show on the CBS network and Syndication in 1993. Marsupilami's supporting characters included among others Maurice the gorilla, Stewart the elephant, Eduardo the jaguar, Leonardo the lion, and Norman the poacher. The original Marsupilami stories by Franquin never encountered a gorilla or elephant, since these species are native to Africa, while the marsupilami in the comic was said to come from South America (however, in the album \"Le dictateur et le champignon\", the Marsupilami escapes from his cell on a boat with a gorilla). Another change is Marsupilami can speak in difference to his comic counterpart that can only mimic sound like a parrot. In this version, Marsupilami is voiced by Steve Mackall.\nShnookums and Meat was a secondary segment on this show.\n\nThere were thirteen episodes in the series, and the series lasted one season. Reruns of the show were aired on The Disney Channel (from October 1994 to June 1995), and later on Toon Disney.\n\nAnimators Tony Bancroft and Michael Surrey are in the character design ending credits.\n\nA second series, this time produced in France, premiered in March 2000 and ran for 26 episodes in France's Canal J. Produced by Cactus Animation, Marathon Production & Marsu Productions, this series more closely followed the character in the original comic.\n\nIn this first season, Marsupilami lived adventures alone or with his family (his wife Marsupilamie and their three young, Bibi, Bibu and Bobo). For example, in one episode he saved a group of circus animals, got them back to the city and saved the circus from closing. In another, he had to go to the city again to save one of his young, captured by their constant enemy, the hunter Bring M. Backalive.\n\nIn the 15 episode second season, called \"Mon ami Marsupilami\" (translated as \"My friend Marsupilami\" in the Disney Channel version), Marsupilami and his family become best friends with a human family, the Du Jardin, that comes to live near them. Amanda is a Marsupilami researcher, while her husband Jean-Pierre is a computer technician that works from home and they have two children, Teo (Leo in the Disney Channel version) and toddler Zoe. Leo and Marsupilami become best friends and they have lots of adventures, with both new friends and old enemies, like Backalive.\n\nThe third series, started in 2009, features a preteen boy named Hector and his aunt Diane, who are going to live in the jungle for one year to study its fauna and flora. They become the best friends with the Marsupilami family. Their main enemies are megalomaniac industrialist and jungle-hater Felicia Devort, who plans to level out the Palombian jungle and build the Devort City megalopolis in its place, and her two henchmen, and Blouprint. Their old enemy, hunter Bring M. Backalive, also appears.\n\nThe fourth series, translated to \"Our Neighbors the Marsupilamis\", featured the Marsupilami family living with veterinarian Bernard Vanderstadt and his four children Sarah, Iris, Isidore and Zoe. Their mother, Caroline, frequently contacts them by phone, but appears in the last three episode. Once again Backalive makes an appearance.\n\nThis series has been broadcast in 36 countries, among them Germany (Super RTL), Algeria (Programme National), Belgium (RTL TVI), Canada (Télé-Quebec), Estonia (ETV), Bulgaria (Super7), Spain (Antena 3, Disney Channel, Toon Disney and TV3), Finland (MTV3), Cyprus (CyBC), Greece (Alter Channel), Ireland (RTÉ), Italy (Italia 1), Portugal (Prisvideo), Switzerland (TSR), Russia (THT Network), Hungary (Minimax (Hungary)), Slovenia (RTV), Serbia (Happy TV (Season 1), Minimax (Serbia)), Montenegro (Happy TV (Season 1), Minimax (Serbia)), Bosnia and Herzegovina (Minimax (Serbia) (no Season 1)), Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (Minimax (Serbia) (no Season 1)), Morocco (2M TV), Turkey (Yumurcak TV), Sri Lanka (Rupavahini), Mexico (Canal 22 (the \"Houba Houba Hop!\" season), Brazil (Rede Globo), Venezuela (RCTV), Indonesia (B-Channel and RCTI), Malaysia (TV3 and TV9), the Africa Pansat (CFI), and Latin America (ZAZ (first season only), the Near East and Middle East (TV5), (E-Junior), Vietnam (HTV7), Thailand (United Broadcasting Corporation), South Korea (EBS), Iceland (Uppeldi EHF), and South Africa (SABC).\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "26646400", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26646400", "title": "Murder of James Bulger", "text": "Murder of James Bulger\n\nJames Patrick Bulger (16 March 1990 – 12 February 1993) was a boy from Kirkby, Merseyside, England, who was murdered on 12 February 1993, at the age of two. He was abducted, tortured and killed by two ten-year-old boys, Robert Thompson (born 23 August 1982) and Jon Venables (born 13 August 1982). Bulger was led away from the New Strand Shopping Centre in Bootle whilst his mother took her eyes off him momentarily. His mutilated body was found on a railway line away in Walton, Liverpool, two days after his murder. Thompson and Venables were charged on 20 February 1993 with Bulger's abduction and murder.\n\nThey were found guilty on 24 November 1993, making them the youngest convicted murderers in modern English history. They were sentenced to detention during Her Majesty's pleasure until a Parole Board decision in June 2001 recommended their release on a lifelong licence aged 18. In 2010, Venables was sent to prison for breaching the terms of his licence, and was released on parole again in 2013. In November 2017, Venables was again sent to prison for possessing child abuse images on his computer.\n\nThe Bulger case has prompted widespread debate on the issue of how to handle young offenders when they are sentenced or released from custody.\n\nClosed-circuit television (CCTV), surveillance from the New Strand Shopping Centre in Bootle taken on Friday 12 February 1993 showed Thompson and Venables casually observing children, apparently selecting a target. The boys were playing truant from school, which they did regularly. Throughout the day, Thompson and Venables were seen stealing various items including sweets, a troll doll, some batteries and a can of blue paint, some of which were later found at the murder scene. One of the boys later revealed that they were planning to find a child to abduct, lead him to the busy road alongside the shopping centre, and push him into the path of oncoming traffic.\n\nThat same afternoon, Bulger, from nearby Kirkby, went with his mother, Denise, to the New Strand Shopping Centre. Whilst inside the A. R. Tym's butcher's shop on the lower floor of the centre at around 15:40, Denise, who had been temporarily distracted, realised that her son had disappeared. Thompson and Venables approached him and took him by the hand, leading him out of the shopping centre. The moment was caught on CCTV at 15:42. Thompson and Venables took Bulger on a meandering walk across Liverpool to the Leeds and Liverpool Canal where he was dropped on his head and suffered injuries to his face. The boys joked about pushing Bulger into the canal. During the walk across Liverpool, the boys were seen by 38 people.\n\nBulger had a bump on his forehead and was crying, but most bystanders did nothing to intervene. Two people challenged Thompson and Venables, but they claimed Bulger was their younger brother or that he was lost and they were taking him to the local police station. At one point, the boys took Bulger into a pet shop, from which they were ejected. Eventually the boys arrived in the village of Walton, and with Walton Lane police station across the road facing them, they hesitated and led Bulger up a steep bank to a railway line near the disused Walton & Anfield railway station, close to Anfield Cemetery, where they began torturing him.\n\nOne of the boys threw blue Humbrol modelling paint, which they had stolen earlier, into Bulger's left eye. They kicked him, stamped on him and threw bricks and stones at him. Batteries were placed in Bulger's mouth and, according to police, some batteries may have been inserted into his anus, although none were found. Finally, the boys dropped a iron bar, described in court as a railway fishplate, on Bulger. He sustained 10 skull fractures as a result of the bar striking his head. Dr Alan Williams, the case's pathologist, stated that Bulger suffered so many injuries —42 in total— that none could be isolated as the fatal blow. Thompson and Venables laid Bulger across the railway tracks and weighted his head down with rubble, in the hope that a train would hit him and make his death appear to be an accident. After they left the scene, his body was cut in half by a train. Bulger's severed body was discovered two days later on 14 February. A forensic pathologist testified that he had died before he was struck by the train.\n\nPolice suspected that there was a sexual element to the crime, since Bulger's shoes, socks, trousers and underpants had been removed. The pathologist's report, which was read out in court, found that Bulger's foreskin had been forcibly retracted. When Thompson and Venables were questioned about this aspect of the attack by detectives and a child psychiatrist, Dr Eileen Vizard, Thompson and Venables were reluctant to give details; they also denied inserting some of the batteries into Bulger's anus. At his eventual parole, Venables's psychiatrist, Dr Susan Bailey, reported that \"visiting and revisiting the issue with Jon as a child, and now as an adolescent, he gives no account of any sexual element to the offence.\"\n\nThe police quickly found low-resolution video images of Bulger's abduction from the New Strand Shopping Centre by two unidentified boys. The railway embankment upon which his body had been discovered was adorned with hundreds of bunches of flowers. The family of one boy, who was detained for questioning but subsequently released, had to flee the city due to threats by vigilantes. The breakthrough came when a woman, on seeing slightly enhanced images of the two boys on national television, recognised Venables, whom she knew had played truant with Thompson that day. She contacted police and the boys were arrested.\n\nThe fact that the suspects were so young came as a shock to investigating officers, headed by Detective Superintendent Albert Kirby, of Merseyside Police. Early press reports and police statements had referred to Bulger being seen with \"two youths\" (suggesting that the killers were teenagers), the ages of the boys being difficult to ascertain from the images captured by CCTV. Forensic tests confirmed that both boys had the same blue paint on their clothing as found on Bulger's body. Both had blood on their shoes; the blood on Thompson's shoe was matched to Bulger's through DNA tests. A pattern of bruising on Bulger's right cheek matched the features of the upper part of a shoe worn by Thompson; a paint mark in the toecap of one of Venables's shoes indicated he must have used \"some force\" when he kicked Bulger. Thompson is said to have asked police whether the two-year-old had been taken to hospital to \"get him alive again\".\nThe boys were each charged with the murder of James Bulger on 20 February 1993, and appeared at South Sefton Youth Court on 22 February 1993, when they were remanded in custody to await trial. In the aftermath of their arrest, and throughout the media accounts of their trial, the boys were referred to as 'Child A' (Thompson) and 'Child B' (Venables). Awaiting trial, they were held in the secure units where they would eventually be sentenced to be detained indefinitely.\n\nUp to five hundred protesters gathered at South Sefton Magistrates' Court during the boys' initial court appearances. The parents of the accused were moved to different parts of the country and assumed new identities following death threats from vigilantes. The full trial opened at Preston Crown Court on 1 November 1993, conducted as an adult trial with the accused in the dock away from their parents, and the judge and court officials in legal regalia. The boys denied the charges of murder, abduction and attempted abduction. The attempted abduction charge related to an incident at the New Strand Shopping Centre earlier on 12 February 1993, the day of Bulger's death. Thompson and Venables had attempted to lead away another two-year-old boy, but had been prevented by the boy's mother.\n\nEach boy sat in view of the court on raised chairs (so they could see out of the dock designed for adults) accompanied by two social workers. Although they were separated from their parents, they were within touching distance when their families attended the trial. News stories reported the demeanour of the defendants. These aspects were later criticised by the European Court of Human Rights, which ruled in 1999 that they had not received a fair trial by being tried in public in an adult court. At the trial, the lead prosecution counsel Richard Henriques QC successfully rebutted the principle of \"doli incapax\", which presumes that young children cannot be held legally responsible for their actions.\n\nThompson and Venables were considered by the court to be capable of \"mischievous discretion\", meaning an ability to act with criminal intent as they were mature enough to understand that they were doing something seriously wrong. A child psychiatrist, Dr Eileen Vizard, who interviewed Thompson before the trial, was asked in court whether he would know the difference between right and wrong, that it was wrong to take a young child away from his mother, and that it was wrong to cause injury to a child. Vizard replied, \"If the issue is on the balance of probabilities, I think I can answer with certainty.\" Vizard also said that Thompson was suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder after the attack on Bulger. Dr. Susan Bailey, the Home Office forensic psychiatrist who interviewed Venables, said unequivocally that he knew the difference between right and wrong.\n\nThompson and Venables did not speak during the trial, and the case against them was based to a large extent on the more than 20 hours of tape-recorded police interviews with the boys, which were played back in court. Thompson was considered to have taken the leading role in the abduction process, though it was Venables who had apparently initiated the idea of taking Bulger to the railway line. Venables later described how Bulger seemed to like him, holding his hand and allowing him to pick him up on the meandering journey to the scene of his murder. Laurence Lee, who was the solicitor of Venables during the trial, later said that Thompson was one of the most frightening children he had seen, and compared him to the Pied Piper. After his appearances in court, Venables would strip off his clothes, saying \"I can smell James like a baby smell\" The prosecution admitted a number of exhibits during the trial, including a box of 27 bricks, a blood-stained stone, Bulger's underpants, and the rusty iron bar described as a railway fishplate. The pathologist spent 33 minutes outlining the injuries sustained by Bulger; many of those to his legs had been inflicted after he was stripped from the waist down. Brain damage was extensive and included a haemorrhage.\n\nThe boys, by then aged 11, were found guilty of Bulger's murder at the Preston court on 24 November 1993, becoming the youngest convicted murderers of the 20th century. The judge, Mr Justice Morland, told Thompson and Venables that they had committed a crime of \"unparalleled evil and barbarity... In my judgment, your conduct was both cunning and very wicked.\" Morland sentenced them to be detained at Her Majesty's pleasure, with a recommendation that they should be kept in custody for \"very, very many years to come\", recommending a minimum term of eight years. At the close of the trial, the judge lifted reporting restrictions and allowed the names of the killers to be released, saying \"I did this because the public interest overrode the interest of the defendants... There was a need for an informed public debate on crimes committed by young children.\" Sir David Omand later criticised this decision and outlined the difficulties created by it in his 2010 review of the probation service's handling of the case.\n\nShortly after the trial, and after the judge had recommended a minimum sentence of eight years, Lord Taylor of Gosforth, the Lord Chief Justice, recommended that the two boys should serve a minimum of ten years, which would have made them eligible for release in February 2003 at the age of 20. The editors of the \"Sun\" newspaper handed a petition bearing nearly 280,000 signatures to Home Secretary Michael Howard, in a bid to increase the time spent by both boys in custody. This campaign was successful, and in July 1994, Howard announced that the boys would be kept in custody for a minimum of fifteen years, meaning that they would not be considered for release until February 2008, by which time they would be 25 years old.\n\nLord Donaldson criticised Howard's intervention, describing the increased tariff as \"institutionalised vengeance ... [by] a politician playing to the gallery.\" The increased minimum term was overturned in 1997 by the House of Lords, who ruled that it was \"unlawful\" for the Home Secretary to decide on minimum sentences for young offenders. The High Court and European Court of Human Rights have since ruled that, though the parliament may set minimum and maximum terms for individual categories of crime, it is the responsibility of the trial judge, with the benefit of all the evidence and argument from both prosecution and defence counsel, to determine the minimum term in individual criminal cases.\n\nTony Blair, then Shadow Home Secretary, gave a speech in Wellingborough during which he said: \"We hear of crimes so horrific they provoke anger and disbelief in equal proportions... These are the ugly manifestations of a society that is becoming unworthy of that name.\" Prime Minister John Major said that \"society needs to condemn a little more, and understand a little less.\" The trial judge Mr. Justice Morland stated that exposure to violent videos might have encouraged the actions of Thompson and Venables, but this was disputed by David Maclean, the Minister of State at the Home Office at the time, who pointed out that police had found no evidence linking the case with \"video nasties\".\n\nSome UK tabloid newspapers claimed that the attack on Bulger was inspired by the film \"Child's Play 3\", and campaigned for the rules on \"video nasties\" to be tightened. During the police investigation, it emerged that \"Child's Play 3\" was one of the films that Jon Venables' father had rented in the months prior to the killing, but it was not established that Venables had ever watched it. One scene in the film shows the malevolent doll Chucky being splashed with blue paint during a paintball game. A Merseyside detective said \"We went through something like 200 titles rented by the Venables family. There were some you or I wouldn't want to see, but nothing—no scene, or plot, or dialogue—where you could put your finger on the freeze button and say that influenced a boy to go out and commit murder.\" Inspector Ray Simpson of Merseyside Police commented: \"If you are going to link this murder to a film, you might as well link it to \"The Railway Children\"\". The Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 clarified the rules on the availability of certain types of video material to children.\n\nAfter the trial, Thompson was held at the Barton Moss Secure Care Centre in Manchester. Venables was detained in Vardy House, a small eight-bedded unit at Red Bank secure unit in St. Helens on Merseyside. These locations were not publicly known until after the boys' release. Details of the boys' lives were recorded twice daily on running sheets and signed by the member of staff who had written them. The records were stored at the units and copied to officials in Whitehall. The boys were taught to conceal their real names and the crime they had committed which resulted in their being in the units. Venables' parents regularly visited their son at Red Bank, just as Thompson's mother did, every three days, at Barton Moss. The boys received education and rehabilitation; despite initial problems, Venables was said to have eventually made good progress at Red Bank, resulting in him being kept there for the full eight years, despite the facility only being a short-stay remand unit. Both boys, however, were reported to suffer post-traumatic stress disorder, and Venables in particular told of experiencing nightmares and flashbacks of the murder.\n\nIn 1999, lawyers for Thompson and Venables appealed to the European Court of Human Rights that the boys' trial had not been impartial, since they were too young to follow proceedings and understand an adult court. The European Court dismissed their claim that the trial was inhuman and degrading treatment, but upheld their claim they were denied a fair hearing by the nature of the court proceedings. The European Court also held that Michael Howard's intervention had led to a \"highly charged atmosphere\", which resulted in an unfair judgment. On 15 March 1999, the court in Strasbourg ruled by 14 votes to five that there had been a violation of Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights regarding the fairness of the trial of Thompson and Venables, stating: \"The public trial process in an adult court must be regarded in the case of an 11-year-old child as a severely intimidating procedure.\"\n\nIn September 1999, Bulger's parents applied to the European Court of Human Rights, but failed to persuade the court that a victim of a crime has the right to be involved in determining the sentence of the perpetrator. The European Court case led to the new Lord Chief Justice, Lord Woolf, reviewing the minimum sentence. In October 2000, he recommended the tariff be reduced from ten to eight years, adding that young offender institutions were a \"corrosive atmosphere\" for the juveniles.\n\nIn June 2001, after a six-month review, the parole board ruled the boys were no longer a threat to public safety and could be released as their minimum tariff had expired in February of that year. The Home Secretary David Blunkett approved the decision, and they were released a few weeks later on lifelong licence after serving eight years. Both men \"were given new identities and moved to secret locations under a 'witness protection'-style programme.\" This was supported by the fabrication of passports, national insurance numbers, qualification certificates and medical records. Blunkett added his own conditions to their licence and insisted on being sent daily updates on the men's actions.\n\nThe terms of their release included the following: they were not allowed to contact each other or Bulger's family; they were prohibited from visiting the Merseyside region; curfews may be imposed on them and they must report to probation officers. If they breached the rules or were deemed a risk to the public, they could be returned to prison. An injunction was imposed on the media after the trial, preventing the publication of details about Thompson and Venables. The worldwide injunction was kept in force following their release on parole, so their new identities and locations could not be published. Blunkett stated in 2001: \"The injunction was granted because there was a real and strong possibility that their lives would be at risk if their identities became known.\"\n\nIn the months after the trial, and following the birth of their second son, the marriage of Bulger's parents, Ralph and Denise, broke down; they divorced in 1995. Denise married Stuart Fergus and they have two sons together. Ralph also remarried and has three daughters by his second wife.\n\n\"The Observer\" revealed that both Venables and Thompson had passed A-levels during their sentences. The paper also told how the Bulger family's lawyers had consulted psychiatric experts in order to present the parole panel with a report which suggested that Thompson is an undiagnosed psychopath, citing his lack of remorse during his trial and arrest. The report was ultimately dismissed. However, his lack of remorse at the time, in stark contrast to Venables, led to considerable scrutiny from the parole panel. Upon release, both Thompson and Venables had lost all trace of their Liverpool accents. In a psychiatric report prepared in 2000 before Venables' release, he was described as posing a \"trivial\" risk to the public and unlikely to reoffend. The chances of his successful rehabilitation were described as \"very high\".\n\nThe \"Manchester Evening News\" published details that suggested the names of the secure institutions in which the pair were housed, in breach of the injunction against publicity which had been renewed early in 2001. In December that year, the paper was fined £30,000 for contempt of court and ordered to pay costs of £120,000.\n\nNo significant publication or vigilante action against Thompson or Venables has occurred. Despite this, Bulger's mother, Denise, told how in 2004 she received a tip-off from an anonymous source that helped her locate Thompson. Upon seeing him, she was \"paralysed with hatred\" and was unable to confront him.\n\nIn April 2007, documents released under the Freedom of Information Act confirmed that the Home Office had spent £13,000 on an injunction to prevent a foreign magazine from revealing the new identities of Thompson and Venables.\n\nOn 14 March 2008, an appeal to set up a Red Balloon Learner Centre in Merseyside in memory of James Bulger was launched by Denise Fergus, his mother, and Esther Rantzen. A memorial garden in Bulger's memory was created in Sacred Heart Primary School in his hometown of Kirkby, the school he would have been expected to attend had he not been murdered.\n\nIn March 2010, a call was made to raise the age of criminal responsibility in England from ten to twelve. Children's commissioner Maggie Atkinson said that the killers of James Bulger should have undergone \"programmes\" to help turn their lives around, rather than being prosecuted. The Ministry of Justice rejected the call, saying that children over the age of ten knew the difference \"between bad behaviour and serious wrongdoing\".\n\nIn April 2010, a 19-year-old man from the Isle of Man was given a three-month suspended prison sentence for falsely claiming in a Facebook message that one of his former colleagues was Robert Thompson. In passing sentence, Deputy High Bailiff Alastair Montgomerie said that the teenager had \"put that person at significant risk of serious harm\" and in a \"perilous position\" by making the allegation.\n\nIn March 2012, a 26-year-old man from Chorley, Lancashire, was arrested after allegedly setting up a Facebook group with the title \"What happened to Jamie Bulger was f**king hilarious.\" The man's computer was seized for further investigations.\n\nOn 25 February 2013, the Attorney General's Office announced that it was instituting contempt of court proceedings against several people who had allegedly published photographs online showing Thompson or Venables as adults. A spokesman commented \"There are many different images circulating online claiming to be of Venables or Thompson; potentially innocent individuals may be wrongly identified as being one of the two men and placed in danger. The order, and its enforcement, is therefore intended to protect not only Venables and Thompson but also those members of the public who have been incorrectly identified as being one of the two men.\"\n\nOn 26 April 2013, two men received suspended jail sentences of nine months after admitting to contempt of court, by publishing photographs which they claimed to be of Venables and Thompson on Facebook and Twitter. The posts were seen by 24,000 people. According to BBC legal correspondent Clive Coleman, the purpose of the prosecution was to ensure that the public was aware that Internet users were also subject to the law of contempt.\n\nOn 27 November 2013, a man from Liverpool received a fourteen-month suspended jail sentence for posting images on Twitter claiming to show Venables.\n\nOn 14 July 2016, a woman from Margate in Kent was jailed for three years after sending Twitter messages to Bulger's mother in which she posed as one of his killers and his ghost. The sentence was reduced to years on appeal.\n\nOn 25 October 2016, a man was jailed for 26 weeks for stalking Denise Fergus. He had previously received a police warning for stalking her in 2008.\n\nOn 2 March 2010, the Ministry of Justice revealed that Jon Venables had been returned to prison for an unspecified violation of the terms of his licence of release. The Justice Secretary Jack Straw stated that Venables had been returned to prison because of \"extremely serious allegations\", and stated that he was \"unable to give further details of the reasons for Jon Venables's return to custody, because it was not in the public interest to do so.\" On 7 March, Venables was returned to prison accused of child pornography offences.\n\nIn a statement to the House of Commons on 8 March 2010, Jack Straw reiterated that it was \"not in the interest of justice\" to reveal the reason why Venables had been returned to custody. Baroness Butler-Sloss, the judge who made the decision to grant Venables anonymity in 2001, warned that he could be killed if his new identity was revealed.\n\nBulger's mother, Denise Fergus, said that she was angry that the parole board did not tell her that Venables had been returned to prison, and called for his anonymity to be removed if he was charged with a crime. A spokesperson for the Ministry of Justice stated that there is a worldwide injunction against publication of either killer's location or new identity.\n\nVenables's return to prison revived a false claim that a man from Fleetwood, Lancashire, was Jon Venables. The claim was reported and dismissed in September 2005, but reappeared in March 2010 when it was circulated widely via SMS messages and Facebook.\n\nChief Inspector Tracie O'Gara of Lancashire Constabulary stated: \"An individual who was targeted four-and-a-half years ago was not Jon Venables and now he has left the area.\"\n\nOn 21 June 2010, Venables was charged with possession and distribution of indecent images of children. It was alleged that he had downloaded 57 indecent images of children over a 12-month period to February 2010, and allowed other people to access the files through a peer-to-peer network. Venables faced two charges under the Protection of Children Act 1978. On 23 July 2010, Venables appeared at a court hearing at the Old Bailey via a video link, visible only to the judge hearing the case. He pleaded guilty to charges of downloading and distributing child pornography, and was given a sentence of two years' imprisonment.\n\nAt the court hearing, it emerged that Venables had posed in online chat rooms as 35-year-old Dawn \"Dawnie\" Smith, a married woman from Liverpool who boasted about abusing her 8-year-old daughter, in the hope of obtaining further child pornography. Venables had contacted his probation officer in February 2010, fearing that his new identity had been compromised at his place of work. When the officer arrived at his flat, Venables was attempting to remove or destroy the hard drive of his computer with a knife and a tin opener. The officer's suspicions were aroused, and the computer was taken away for examination leading to the discovery of the child pornography, which included children as young as two being raped by adults and penetrative rape of seven- or eight-year-olds.\n\nThe judge, Mr Justice Bean, ruled that Venables's new identity could not be revealed, but the media was allowed to report that he had been living in Cheshire at the time of his arrest. The High Court also heard that Venables had been arrested on suspicion of affray in September 2008, following a drunken street fight with another man. Later the same year, he was cautioned for possession of cocaine.\n\nIn November 2010, a review of the National Probation Service handling of the case by Sir David Omand found that probation officers could not have prevented Venables from downloading child pornography. Harry Fletcher, the assistant general secretary of the National Association of Probation Officers, commented that only 24-hour surveillance would have prevented Venables from downloading the material.\n\nVenables was eligible for parole in July 2011. On 27 June 2011, the parole board decided that Venables would remain in custody, and that his parole would not be considered again for at least another year.\n\nShortly before his 2001 release, when aged 17, Venables was alleged to have had sex with a woman who worked at the Red Bank secure unit where he was held. In April 2011, in the aftermath of his 2010 imprisonment, these allegations were outlined in a \"Sunday Times Magazine\" article written by David James Smith, who had been following the Bulger case since the 1993 trial, and again later in a BBC documentary titled \"Jon Venables: What Went Wrong?\" The female staff member was accused of sexual misconduct and suspended; she never returned to work at Red Bank. A spokesman for St Helens Borough Council denied that the incident had been covered up, saying: \"All allegations were thoroughly investigated by an independent team on the orders of the Home Office and chaired by Arthur de Frischling, a retired prison governor.\"\n\nVenables began living independently in March 2002. Some time thereafter, he began a relationship with a woman who had a five-year-old child. It is not known whether Venables had already begun downloading child pornography at the time of dating the woman, though he denies having ever met the child. In 2005, when Venables was 23, his probation officer met another girlfriend of his, who was aged 17. After a number of \"young girlfriends\", it was presumed that Venables was having a delayed adolescence.\n\nAfter a period of apparently reduced supervision, Venables began excessively drinking, taking drugs, downloading child pornography, as well as visiting Merseyside (a breach of his licence). In 2008, a new probation officer noted that he spent \"a great deal of leisure time\" playing video games and on the Internet. In September that year, Venables was arrested on suspicion of affray, following a fight outside a nightclub; he claimed he was acting in self-defence and the charges were later dropped after he agreed to go on an alcohol-awareness course. Three months later he was found to be in possession of cocaine; he was subjected to a curfew.\n\nOn two separate occasions, Venables revealed his true identity to a friend.\n\nOn 4 May 2011, it was reported that Venables would once again be given a new identity, following what was described as a \"serious security breach\" which revealed an identity that he had been using before his imprisonment in 2010. Details of the breach could not be reported for legal reasons. A spokesman for the Ministry of Justice commented: \"Such a change of identity is extremely rare and granted only when the police assess that there is clear and credible evidence of a sustained threat to the offender's life on release into the community.\" The incident occurred after a man from Exeter posted photographs on a website devoted to identifying paedophiles, allegedly showing Venables as an adult and giving his name.\n\nIn November 2011, it was reported that officials had decided that Venables would stay in prison for the foreseeable future, as he would be likely to reveal his true identity if released. A Ministry of Justice spokesman declined to comment on the reports. On 4 July 2013, it was reported that the Parole Board for England and Wales had approved the release of Venables. On 3 September 2013, it was reported that Venables had been released from prison.\n\nOn 23 November 2017, it was reported that Venables had again been recalled to prison for possession of child abuse imagery. The Ministry of Justice declined to comment on the reports. On 5 January 2018, Venables was charged with unspecified offences relating to indecent images of children.\n\nOn 7 February 2018, Venables pleaded guilty to possession of indecent images of children for a second time. He pleaded guilty via video link to three charges of making indecent images of children and one of possessing a paedophile manual. He admitted being in possession of 392 category A, 148 category B, and 630 category C child pornography images, and was sentenced to three years and four months in prison. The parole board will decide whether to release him at the end of his sentence.\n\nIn June 2007, a computer game based on the TV series \"Law & Order\", titled \"\" (made in 2003), was withdrawn from stores in the UK following reports that it contained an image of Bulger. The image in question is the , Thompson and Venables. The scene in the game involves a computer-generated detective pointing out the picture, which is meant to represent a fictional child abduction that the player is then asked to investigate. Bulger's family, along with many others, complained and the game was subsequently withdrawn by its UK distributor, GSP. The game's developer, Legacy Interactive, released a statement in which it apologised for the image's inclusion in the game; according to the statement, the image's use was \"inadvertent\" and took place \"without any knowledge of the crime, which occurred in the UK and was minimally publicized in the United States.\"\n\nIn 2008, Swedish playwright Niklas Rådström used the interview transcripts from interrogations with the murderers and their families to recreate the story. His play, \"Monsters,\" opened to mixed reviews at the Arcola Theatre in London in May 2009.\n\nIn August 2009, Australia's Seven Network used real footage of the abduction to promote its crime drama \"City Homicide\". The use of the footage was criticised by Bulger's mother and Seven apologised. On 24 August 2009, co-hosts on Seven's breakfast show \"Sunrise\" asked whether the killers were now living in Australia in an apparent tie-in with that week's episode of \"City Homicide\". They answered the question the next day, on 25 August 2009, relaying the Australian government's denial that the killers had been settled in the country.\n\nA \"Hollyoaks\" storyline, set to begin in December 2009, was cancelled after the show gave Bulger's mother Denise Fergus a special screening. The storyline was to feature Loretta Jones and her friend Chrissy, who had been given new identities before arriving in the village, after being convicted of murdering a child at the age of 12.\n\nThe critical theorist Terry Eagleton introduced his 2010 book \"On Evil\" with the story of Bulger's murder.\n\n\n"}

Among the most compelling pieces of evidence in the case was a leather jacket covered in Duguay's blood and over two dozen white feline hairs.\n\nRoyal Canadian Mounted Police investigators recalled that during a previous interview with the estranged husband, Douglas Beamish, that he had a white cat named Snowball. The detectives confiscated the cat and drew blood in which they intended to use DNA fingerprinting to compare it to the DNA found in the white hairs from the jacket, but they found that no one in the world had done this before.\n\nAfter contacting the Laboratory of Genomic Diversity, a laboratory specializing not in forensics, but in the study of genetic diseases, detectives and scientists were able to develop a method in which to test the feline DNA. The test included a fail-safe method of randomly testing 20 other cats from the isolated Prince Edward Island, in order to establish the degree of genetic diversity among cats in the area, to rule out the possibility that the hairs found in the jacket came from a close relative of Snowball, or if all the cats on the island had a common ancestor, rendering the DNA test useless.\n\nThe tests revealed that the hairs did come from the cat; Beamish was subsequently convicted for the murder of his wife. The forensic science of testing cat and dog hairs has been firmly established and studied, but it was an unknown science until the Duguay case. Convicted of second-degree murder, Douglas Beamish is serving a life sentence in an Ontario prison. His request for parole in 2013 was denied.\n\nIn an episode entitled \"Purr-fect Match,\" \"Forensic Files\" outlined this story on February 12, 2002 (Episode 7 of Season 7). It was also told on \"The New Detectives\" on December 10, 2002, in episode 3 of season 8, \"Material Witness.\"\n\n\n"}

Usyk won the undisputed championship in his 15th professional fight, which is an all-time boxing record, and is the first undisputed champion from Ukraine. As an amateur, he won gold medals at the 2011 World Championships and 2012 Olympics, both in the heavyweight division.\n\nAs of July 2018, Usyk is ranked as the world's best active cruiserweight by \"The Ring\", the Transnational Boxing Rankings Board (TBRB), ESPN, and BoxRec. He is also currently ranked as the world's fourth best active boxer, pound for pound, by \"The Ring\" and the TBRB; fourth by BoxRec; and eighth by ESPN.\n\nUsyk was born in Simferopol, Crimean Oblast, Ukrainian SSR.

The following month he stopped 38 year old Epifanio Mendoza in four rounds. In his 3rd professional fight on April 2014, Usyk made his debut in Germany on the undercard of Klitschko-Leapai at the Koenig Pilsener Arena defeating Ben Nsafoah via 3rd-round knockout. A month later, Usyk returned home and knocked out Cesar David Crenz in round 4, having knocked him down in round 3 as well.\n\nUsyk won his first title on 4 October 2014 after beating South African boxer Daniel Bruwer via round 7 technical knockout for the Interim WBO Inter-Continental cruiserweight title. Usyk defended the title two months later stopping 35 year old Danie Venter in round 9. Usyk was ahead on all three judges' scorecards at the time of stoppage.\n\nUsyk made another defence in April 2015 against former Russian cruiserweight champion Andrey Knyazev (11-1, 6 KOs) in Kiev.

This win kept Usyk on course to a WBO title fight against then champion Marco Huck.\n\nIn August 2015, Usyk defeated former South African light heavyweight champion Johnny Muller via 3rd-round technical knockout at the Sport Palace in Kiev, which saw Usyk control the fight with a jab.

Usyk won the fight scoring his 9th straight knockout in as many fights, first dropping Rodriguez in round 6 with an uppercut before the fight was stopped in round 7, being knocked down again, although he beat the count. This win put Usyk at WBO's number 1 position, with a World title fight on the cards for 2016.\n\nIn June 2016, it was announced that Usyk would challenge undefeated Polish boxer Krzysztof Głowacki (26-0, 16 KOs) for his WBO cruiserweight champion on 17 September at the Ergo Arena in Gdansk, Poland. It was reported that Usyk's trainer James Ali Bashir wanted to recruit former world champion Antonio Tarver as a sparring partner. It was said that Tarver not only requested too much money, but he also wanted to appear on the card as a co-featured main event. Głowacki weighed 199.3 pounds, which Usyk coming in slightly lighter at 198.75 pounds. The fight was shown live on Sky Sports in the UK. On the night, Usyk outpointed Głowacki after an exciting 12 round fight with the judges scoring it 119–109, 117–111, and 117–111 all in Usyk's favour. The decision win also ended Usyk's run of having won his opening 9 fights via stoppage. Usyk dominated the fight with a jab, eventually injuring Głowacki's eye early in the fight leading it to eventually bleed. The cut continued to bleed for the remainder of the contest. Usyk also used his dominant hand speed and footwork which helped him score the decision win.\n\nUsyk announced he would be making his American debut on the Bernard Hopkins vs. Joe Smith Jr. card on 17 December 2016. The fight would take place at the Forum in Inglewood, California. On 11 November K2 Promotions announced Usyk would be defending his WBO title against 28 year old South African boxer Thabiso Mchunu (17-2, 11 KOs).

Although the fight started very slow, the fans in attendance began to boo. The pace was picked up after the first couple of rounds, when Usyk started connecting with his trademark combos. CompuBox statistics showed that Usyk landed 163 of 517 punches thrown (32%), and Mchunu landed 76 of his 278 (27%).\n\nThe official time of the stoppage was at 2:53. Prior to the fight, Usyk spoke of his desire to fight other cruiserweight titlists as well as fighting Anthony Joshua at heavyweight. The fight averaged 560,000 viewers on HBO, this was considered good numbers considering it was Usyk's HBO debut and on the undercard.\n\nK2 Promotions announced that Usyk would be returning on regular HBO to defend his cruiserweight world title in April 2017. He was originally planned to appear on the undercard of the Golovkin-Jacobs HBO PPV in March at Madison Square Garden, however since Roman Gonzalez and Carlos Cuadras were scheduled to appear in separate fights and not fight each other, Usyk was pulled from the card.\n\nOn 12 February 2017, Usyk announced that he had parted ways with long time trainer James Ali Bashir and replaced him with Vasyl Lomachenko's father and trainer, Anatoly Lomachenko. Bob Arum announced that Usyk would be part of a triple header including Vasyl Lomachenko at the MGM National Harbor in Oxon Hill, Maryland on 8 April 2017 against Michael Hunter (12-0, 8 KOs). Usyk weighed 199.4 whilst Hunter came in at 199 pounds. In front of a sold out crowd of 2,828, where there was majority Ukrainian fans in attendance, Usyk was taken the distance for the second time in his career and won a rather one-sided unanimous decision to retain his WBO title. Hunter unexpectedly controlled the first three rounds behind the jab. It wasn't until the fourth round, when Usyk took control of the bout using his left and connecting well to the body to win majority of the remainder rounds. Pundits thought Hunter was gifted going the distance and the fight should have been stopped by referee Bill Clancy in the championship rounds. In round 12, it appeared in the last minute, Hunter, while taking punches, was only standing because of the ropes where holding him up. Referee halted the fight and gave Hunter a standing eight count, ruling it a knockdown for Usyk. All three judges scored the fight unanimously 117–110 for Usyk. Although it took him a few rounds to get into the fight, Usyk was happy with his performance and called out other titleholders, \"I'm very happy with my performance. I did what I wanted to do. He took a lot of punches. I thought maybe they would stop the fight (in the 12th round). I'd love to fight any of the titleholders, any time, any place.\"\n\nAccording to CompuBox punch stats, Usyk landed 321 of his 905 punches thrown, 36%. Hunter managed to land 24% of his punches, connecting 190 of 794.

I've been dreaming of putting together all the champs to see who is the strongest and becomes the undisputed king of the division.\" The draw was to take place on July 8 in Monte Carlo. The winner of the tournament would receive a grand money prize and the Muhammad Ali trophy.\n\nAt the Draft Gala, Usyk, who had first pick, chose to fight former WBO champion Marco Huck (40–4–1, 27 KOs). When asked why he chose Huck, Usyk said, \"Because of my fans.\" Huck, who was equally excited, replied that Usyk was his 'wish opponent'. On 26 July it was announced that the fight would take place at the Max-Schmeling-Halle in Berlin on 9 September 2017. This would mark the second time Usyk would fight in Germany in his professional career, having fought there on his third professional bout in April 2014. It would also mark the first fight of the tournament.\n\nOn 6 September 2017, at the final presser, Huck pushed Usyk in the face-off. In regards to the shove, Huck said, \"I wanted to show Usyk that he is my hometown and that he should be prepared for the battle of his life on Saturday.\" Usyk, who remained professional and calm, replied, \"If you want to be a great champion, you have to beat the best and Huck is one of the best. I chose to enter this tournament because it is a path to achieve my dream of unifying all the belts. There’s a prestigious trophy at stake too, the Muhammad Ali Trophy. We were born on the same day and I admire Ali because he is the biggest role model in boxing and I will thank God if I win a trophy with his name on it.\" As he was leaving the building, Usyk claimed he would 'bury' Huck.\n\nOn fight night, Usyk used his footwork and combination punching to cruise to a TKO win. On top of his dominant performance, Usyk taunted Huck throughout the fight. In round 8, Usyk tripped on Huck's feet and Huck lost a point on the scorecards as he threw a punch at Usyk when the latter was down. Usyk continued to land combinations with little to no response from Huck until referee Robert Byrd stopped the fight in the tenth round. With the win, Usyk progressed to the semi-final stage of the Super Series and was to face the winner of the Mairis Briedis vs. Mike Perez, scheduled for 30 September.\n\nUsyk would next fight Mairis Briedis (23–0, 18 KOs) following the latter's win over Perez via unanimous decision. In November 2017, it was reported the fight would take place on 27 January 2018 in Riga, Latvia, a week before Gassiev vs. Dorticos takes place. Arēna Rīga was confirmed as the location by Comosa's Chief Boxing Officer Kalle Sauerland. Usyk came in at 199.5 pounds and Briedis weighed 199.1 pounds. Usyk moved on to the final of the tournament after defeating Briedis via majority decision. With a high work rate, Usyk controlled most of the fight with his jab put on pressure when needed. Briedis was credited with landing the more harder punches. The opening four rounds were closely contested and Usyk was cut from a head-butt over his right eye in round 3. From round 5, Usyk became busier and took control of the fight, although he was still hit with some hard shots to the head from Briedis. One judge scored the fight 114–114, whilst the remaining two judges scored the fight 115–113 in favour of Usyk giving him the win. After the fight, Usyk stated it was the hardest fight of his career. According to CompuBox Stats, Usyk landed 212 of 848 punches thrown (25%) and Briedis was more accurate, landing 195 of his 579 thrown (33.7%). Usyk landed 40% of his power punches. Many boxers and pundits praised the fight.\n\nAfter Usyk beat Briedis, it was announced in the post-fight press conference that the final in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, would take place on 11 May 2018. However, once Murat Gassiev (26-0, 19 KOs) stopped Yunier Dorticos, setting up the final, the secretary general of the Russian Boxing Federation, Umar Kremlev, stated that he would push forward in order to outbid Saudi Arabia and have the final of the tournament take place in Russia on the Day of Russian Boxing on 22 July. On 16 April, it was reported that Usyk had suffered an elbow injury during training, pushing the final to possibly June or July 2018. On 18 June, at a press conference, Kremlev announced the final would take place on 21 July at the Olympic Stadium in Moscow, Russia. On 29 June, the final was officially confirmed. On the release date, 7,000 tickets were sold. Both boxers came in at 198.45 pounds at the weigh-in.\n\nUsyk quickly took control of the fight, moving rapidly and using his \"beautiful, commandeering jab\". Despite facing a hostile hometown crowd, Usyk controlled the fight, not allowing Gassiev to use his power. Gassiev did not land a solid punch until the end of round 2. According to many reports, Usyk outclassed, outboxed, and dominated Gassiev. The result was never in question as Usyk was declared winner by unanimous decision with the scores of 120–108, 119–109, and 119–109. Muhammad Ali's widow, Lonnie Ali presented the trophy to Usyk. After the fight, both combatants were exemplars of good sportsmanship, embracing, with Gassiev saying \"I had the best opponent of my professional career ... today is Oleksandr's day\". Usyk humbly adding \"My team made me look like I looked in the ring. This is our victory\". The win made Usyk the first ever four-belt undisputed cruiserweight champion. Usyk dominated throughout, landing 252 of 939 thrown punches (27%), compared to Gassiev's 91 landed of 313 thrown (29%). Usyk used his superior conditioning to finish the fight, also increasing his output by landing 47 of 117 punches thrown in round 12. Usyk managed to withstand the 32 power body shots he received and continued to move around the ring. \n\nWhen asked who he would like to fight next, Usyk said, \"At this time I have heard that Tony Bellew wants to fight the winner of the Muhammad Ali Trophy. I hope he will see me talking... 'hey Tony Bellew, are you ready?' If he doesn't want to go down, I will go up for him. I will eat more spaghetti for my dinner!\" Also after the fight Usyk said: \"Olympic [stadium], thanks. People, countrymen and those who supported. Moscow 2018. Bang! Daddy's in the building!\".\n\nAfter calling out Tony Bellew (30-2-1, 20 KOs) after winning the tournament, Bellew responded via Social Media that he would accept the fight, however stated the fight would need to take place in 2018 and for the undisputed cruiserweight championship. Bellew believed a fight at heavyweight would not be as appealing as he would not gain much with a win. Bellew also stated it would be his last fight as a professional. By the end of July, it was said the fight would likely take place in November 2018 in London. After positive meetings between Bellew's promoter Eddie Hearn and K2's Alexander Krassyuk, on 20 August, Boxing Scene reported the fight was likely to take place on 10 November 2018. A week later, K2 Promotions confirmed the date of the fight. On 5 September, the WBA ordered Usyk to start negotiating with Denis Lebedev (30-2, 22 KO), who was their 'champion in recess' and gave them until the first week of October 2018 to complete negotiations. There was said to be a stumbling block for the potential Usyk vs. Bellew fight. According to Hearn, the fight was likely to be pushed back to 2019. Prior to negotiations, Bellew stated the fight must happen in 2018.\n\nOn 7 September, Usyk signed a multi-fight deal with Matchroom Boxing, which meant he would fight exclusively on Sky Sports in the UK and DAZN in USA. The agreement meant Matchroom would co-promote Usyk alongside K2 Promotions. Usyk's next fight would be confirmed 'in the very near future', according to Hearn. A week after signing with Matchroom, the Usyk vs. Bellew fight announced to take place on 10 November at the Manchester Arena, live and exclusive on Sky Box Office. Experienced British referee Terry O'Connor was named as the official. Bellew weighed 199¼ pounds, just over 2 years since he last made the cruiserweight limit and Usyk weighed 198¼ pounds.\n\nOn fight night, Usyk, who is usually a slow starter, eventually took full control of the bout and stopped Bellew in round 8 to retain all the cruiserweight belts. The official time of the stoppage was at 2:00 of round 8. There was very little action in round 1 as both boxers showed each other respect. It was a feeling out round.Due to the lack of action, the crowd began to boo towards the end. Overall, Usyk landed just 3 jabs and Bellew landed 1 power shot. Round 2 was similar, however Bellew stepped on the gas, managed to land some clean shots along with some showboating. Bellew took control in round 3, landing two straight right hands. Usyk began using his jab more and after landing an overhand left, Bellew was left slightly shaken. By the end of round 4, Bellew was backed up against the ropes and looked to tire. Bellew aimed most of his shots to Usyk's body and by round 7, was missing a lot of shots and ended up with a bloodied nose, mostly due to Usyk's foot movement. In round 8, whilst in a neutral corner, Usyk landed a hard left, again buzzing Bellew, forcing him to move away against the ropes. Another left hand wobbled Bellew before Usyk finished him off with another left which dropped Bellew backwards with his head landing on the bottom rope. A brave Bellew tried to get up slowly and beat the count but referee Terry O'Connor stopped the fight. Bellew's 10-fight winning streak came to an end. Judges Alejandro Cid and Steve Gray scored the first seven round 68–65 and 67–66 respectively and Yury Koptsev had the fight 67–67 entering round 8.\n\nAfterwards, Bellew paid tribute to Usyk and announced his retirement from boxing, saying; \"I have been doing this for 20 years, and it is over.\" Usyk stated 2018 was the most difficult year of his career, but most successful. \"We need to put goals in front of us and move towards them,\" Usyk later stated. There was a small concern during Bellew's post-fight interview as many felt he was clearly concussed. According to compubox stats, Usyk landed 112 of his 424 punches thrown (26%) and Bellew landed 61 of his 268 thrown (23%). Both landed 47 power shots each.\n\nUsyk is married to Kateryna and the couple have 3 children (born in 2009, 2013 and 2015). They now live in Kiev, Ukraine.\n\nRoughly one month after the annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation, Usyk declared (on 28 April 2014) he would never exchange his Ukrainian citizenship for a Russian one and that he considered Crimea a part of Ukraine.\n\nIn 2016, answering to a question if he can still enter Crimea and his patriotic position, he stated that he can enter Crimea after each of his fights; that he doesn't like to talk politics due to the fact that people like to take words out of context, that in Russia he has many fans and that he doesn't divide \"our peoples because we are Slavs\".\n\n\n"}

She was an executive of the Ukrainian Women's Union branch in Lviv Ukraine. She was arrested by the Polish police after being accused of working with the Ukrainian Military Organization and of spying for Germany (with whom the Ukrainian Military Organization had a working relationship). Materials indicating cooperation with Germany's intelligence were found at her home. Different accounts of her death in prison exist range from suicide to murder. Afterwards she was seen as a martyr and source of inspiration within the Ukrainian community.\n\nOlha Basarab was born Olha Levytska in 1889 into the family of petty gentry (coat-of-arms Rogala) near the town of Rohatyn. In 1914 she married Dmytry Basarab, who died fighting for Austrian on the Italian front in 1915. During World War I Basarab was a member of the first Women's Platoon of the Ukrainian Sich Riflemen, a unit of Ukrainian volunteers within the Austrian army. After the war she worked in the years 1918-1923 as an accountant of Embassy of Ukraine in Vienna, she also visited Denmark, Germany, Norway and other states to collect military and political intelligence.\nShe was involved in charity work involving helping wounded soldiers and civilians, and was recognized by the International Red Cross for her efforts.

She was accused by the Polish authorities of working with intelligence from Germany and Bolshevik Ukraine in Poland and belonging to the Ukrainian Military Organization which organised assassinations on Poles and Ukrainians. After her imprisonment, materials concerning cooperation with German intelligence were found (the Ukrainian Military Organization signed an agreement on May 1923 with Weimar Germany's intelligence service according to which UVO would conduct espionage work against Poland while the German side was to provide financial aid and military equipment). She died in prison in unclear circumstances. The Polish government was accused of torturing her to death, although this accusation was never conclusively proven. Martha Bohachevsky-Chomiak from Canadian Institute of Ukrainian Studies claims the Polish government initially presented her death as a suicide but subsequent exhumation of her body showed that she had been murdered in their custody. Basarab's death resulted in protests from Ukrainians, demands for an inquiry from Ukrainian members of the Polish parliament, and calls from the Jewish members of the Polish parliament to investigate prisoner conditions in Polish jails. Her body was exhumed on February 26 and the Polish forensic expert stated that she had died by hanging. He declined to publicly identify the bruises on her body as being the results of beatings, although his student stated that he had told her during the autopsy that Basarb's body showed traces of having been beaten. Rumors spread in Lviv that police tortured people through the use of electric shocks.\n"}

The film stars the voice of James Corden as the title character, with Rose Byrne, Domhnall Gleeson, Sam Neill, Daisy Ridley, Elizabeth Debicki, and Margot Robbie also starring. The film was released on February 9, 2018, and grossed $351 million worldwide. A sequel is set to be released on February 7, 2020.\n\nIn England's Lake District, Peter Rabbit, his cousin Benjamin Bunny, and Peter's triplet sisters Flopsy, Mopsy, and Cottontail, spend most of their days picking on Mr. Joe McGregor and stealing vegetables from his garden. They are friends with a local woman named Bea who spends her time painting pictures of the rabbits as well as the surrounding nature. Bea takes on a mother-like relationship with the rabbits due to the death of their parents, who were killed by McGregor. One day, Peter is forced to leave his jacket in McGregor's garden and goes back to retrieve it. McGregor spots and catches him, but suddenly dies of a heart attack due to decades of unhealthy eating habits. Enthralled, Peter invites all of the local animals and takes over McGregor's manor.\n\nMeanwhile in London, McGregor's great-nephew Thomas McGregor, an uptight, controlling workaholic, works at the toy department of Harrods department store where he waits for a promotion to associate general manager. He indifferently accepts the news about his great-uncle's death, someone he was completely unaware of, but is infuriated over losing the promotion to a lazy nephew of the managing director and is fired for losing his temper. His now-former manager encourages him to get a hobby and spend some time in the country.\n\nWhen Thomas learns that his great-uncle's manor is valuable and that he's inherited it, he decides to appraise and prepare it for resale in order to start his own toy store to get even with his former employers. He kicks out Peter and his friends and begins to upgrade the security of the garden wall and gates, despite Bea's objections. When Peter and Benjamin sneak back into the garden, Thomas catches the latter and attempts to drown Benjamin in a river. His cousins rescue him; Thomas instead accidentally drops a prized set of binoculars that Bea had given him earlier, forcing him to retrieve it.\n\nThomas and Peter start a war with each other by setting up traps and other offensive nuisances. Thomas and Bea end up falling in love with each other, which causes Peter to become jealous and wanting to separate them more. This all culminates when Peter rewires an electric fence set up by Thomas, prompting Thomas to throw dynamite at Peter's burrow. Thomas then attacks Peter in the garden, telling Peter that his antics caused him to become aggressive. When Peter detonates the dynamite to prove to Bea that Thomas was using it, he ends up knocking down the tree on top of the burrow, which crushes Bea's art studio. Bea, ignoring Thomas’s explanation of his quarrel with the rabbits, breaks up with him, and he goes back to London to work at Harrods again.\n\nPeter feels bad for what he has done, and upon learning that Bea intends to leave the neighborhood, he and Benjamin head to London to find Thomas at Harrods. Tricking Thomas into believing he was imagining the rabbits’ ability to communicate, Peter apologizes for his part of the conflict and convinces Thomas to follow his heart. They rush back to the country, where Peter shows Bea the detonator and presses it for her to see, confirming Thomas’s previous claims that the rabbits were responsible for the explosion. Peter and Thomas apologize and convince Bea not to leave her home.\n\nWishing to remain with Bea, Thomas no longer wants to sell the manor but discovers that an unpleasant wealthy couple had already bought the house and finalized the sale. Peter and his friends use their tricks to force the couple out of the house, allowing Thomas to move back in. Thomas and Bea resume their relationship, and he permits the wildlife to freely take food from the garden as long as it's within reason. Peter and his family restore the burrow with Bea and Thomas’s help. Thomas sets up his own toy shop in the village, where Bea showcases her illustrations of the rabbits.\n\n\n\nThe Singing Sparrows were voiced by Jessica Freedman, Shana Halligan, Katharine Hoye, Chris Mann, Chad Reisser, and Fletcher Sheridan.\n\nThe film was first revealed in April 2015 through email leaks as a result of the Sony Pictures hack. The official announcement of the film came that December.\n\nIn August 2016, Will Gluck was reported to direct from a script by Gluck and Rob Lieber. James Corden was cast to voice Peter Rabbit, and Rose Byrne was selected to play one of the live-action roles. Gluck produced the film along with Zareh Nalbandian of Animal Logic, which will be providing the visual effects and animation for the film.\n\nDaisy Ridley and Elizabeth Debicki joined the cast in September 2016, and the live action production was scheduled to commence in Sydney, Australia, in January 2017. The next month, Domhnall Gleeson was cast as Thomas McGregor, the descendent of the original Mr. McGregor, and Margot Robbie joined the cast, expected to voice a bunny. In November, Sia was cast as Mrs Tiggy-Winkle.\n\nOn December 18, 2016, a first image of the title character, along with the film's logo, was revealed. Production began in December 2016. Live action scenes were filmed at Centennial Park in Sydney. In March 2017, filming took place at Central railway station, Sydney, which was depicted as London Paddington station along with Mortuary railway station being depicted as the country station.\n\n\"Peter Rabbit\" was originally scheduled to be released on March 23, 2018, but it was moved up to February 9, 2018.\n\nThe first trailer received negative feedback from critics and fans of the character, many of whom labelled the film as being too modern and insulting to Beatrix Potter's works. Collider called the trailer \"garbage\" and a \"low brow 'comedy' cringe fest\".\n\nStuart Heritage from \"The Guardian\" stated that \"the \"Peter Rabbit\" film looks like the result of some blisteringly inept manhandling [...] there's something genuinely harrowing about the sight of \"Peter Rabbit\" – gentle, Edwardian Peter Rabbit – thoughtlessly injuring some birds, or grabbing a pile of lettuce leaves and making it rain like a banker in a strip club, or literally twerking\" and argued \"there is no way on Earth that [Beatrix Potter would] have ever given the green light to a slow motion car crash like this.\"\n\n\"Metro\" writer James Baldock found that the trailer was \"so gut wrenchingly bad\" and that \"if the movie lives up to its two minute preview – [it] is set to be the greatest abomination to grace the big screen since \"The Emoji Movie\".\" He finished by writing \"Listen carefully, and you can just about hear the sound of Beatrix Potter, turning furiously in her grave.\" On November 7, a new trailer for the United Kingdom was released.\n\nThe film was released on digital platforms on April 20, 2018. A Blu-ray and DVD and 4K followed on May 1, 2018.\n\n\"Peter Rabbit\" grossed $115.3 million in the United States and Canada, and $235.9 million in other territories (including $20.5 million in Australia), for a worldwide total of $351.2 million, against a production budget of $50 million.\n\nIn the United States and Canada, the film was released alongside \"Fifty Shades Freed\" and \"\", and was projected to gross around $16 million from 3,725 theaters in its opening weekend, with some estimates as high as $25 million. It ended up making $25 million over the weekend, finishing second at the box office behind \"Fifty Shades\" ($38.8 million). The film dropped 30% in its second weekend to $17.5 million ($23.4 million over the four-day Martin Luther King Jr. weekend), finishing second behind newcomer \"Black Panther\".\n\nIn the UK, \"Peter Rabbit\" became the biggest family film of 2018, overtaking Pixar's \"Coco\" with $56.3 million. Totals from other markets include China ($26.5 million), Australia ($20.2 million), France ($12.3 million) and Germany ($12.1 million).\n\nOn Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 64% based on 133 reviews and an average rating of 5.8/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \"\"Peter Rabbit\" updates Beatrix Potter's classic characters with colorfully agreeable results that should entertain younger viewers while admittedly risking the wrath of purists.\" On Metacritic, the film has a score of 51 out of 100 based on 26 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A−\" on an A+ to F scale.\n\nIn the first week after the film's release, groups in multiple countries criticized it for \"allergy bullying\" and called for an apology from Sony. The accusations focused on a scene where Thomas McGregor — whose character has a known severe allergy to blackberries — is pelted with the berries until one enters his mouth, causing him to enter anaphylactic shock and grab for his Epipen. In response, Sony published a statement saying \"We sincerely regret not being more aware and sensitive to this issue, and we truly apologize\".\n\nSony is developing a sequel set to be released on February 7, 2020. Gluck will return to write and direct the film.\n\n"}
{"id": "231376", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=231376", "title": "Pluralism (philosophy)", "text": "Pluralism (philosophy)\n\nPluralism is a term used in philosophy, meaning \"doctrine of multiplicity\", often used in opposition to monism (\"doctrine of unity\") and dualism (\"doctrine of duality\"). The term has different meanings in metaphysics, ontology, epistemology and logic.\n\nIn metaphysics, pluralism is the doctrine that - contrary to the assertions of monism and dualism, there are in fact many different substances in nature that constitute reality.\n\nIn ontology, pluralism refers to different ways, kinds, or modes of being. For example, a topic in ontological pluralism is the comparison of the modes of existence of things like 'humans' and 'cars' with things like 'numbers' and some other concepts as they are used in science.\n\nIn epistemology, pluralism is the position that there is not one consistent means of approaching truths about the world, but rather many. Often this is associated with pragmatism, or conceptual, contextual, or cultural relativism. In the philosophy of science it may refer to the acceptance of co-existing scientific paradigms which though accurately describing their relevant domains are nonetheless incommensurable. \n\nIn logic, pluralism is the view that there is no one correct logic, or alternatively, that there is more than one correct logic. One may, for instance, believe that classical logic is the correct logic generally, but believe that paraconsistent logic is the correct logic for dealing with certain paradoxes. However, there are different versions of logical pluralism depending on what one believes 'logic' to be and what it means for a logical system to be 'correct'.\n\nMetaphysical pluralism in philosophy is the multiplicity of metaphysical models of the structure and content of reality, both as it appears and as logic dictates that it might be, as is exhibited by the four related models in Plato's \"Republic\" and as developed in the contrast between phenomenalism and physicalism. It is similar to the many-worlds interpretation. Pluralism is in contrast to the concept of monism in metaphysics, while dualism is a limited form, a pluralism of exactly two models, structures, elements, or concepts. A distinction is made between the metaphysical identification of realms of reality and the more restricted sub-fields of ontological pluralism (that examines what exists in each of these realms) and epistemological pluralism (that deals with the methodology for establishing knowledge about these realms).\n\nIn Greece, Empedocles wrote that they were fire, air, water and earth, although he used the word \"root\" rather than \"element\" (στοιχεῖον; \"stoicheion\"), which appeared later in Plato. From the association (φιλία; \"philia\") and separation (νεῖκος; \"neikos\") of these indestructible and unchangeable root elements, all things came to be in a fullness (πλήρωμα; \"pleroma\") of ratio (λόγος; \"logos\") and proportion (ἀνάλογος; \"analogos\").\n\nSimilar to Empedocles, Anaxagoras was another ancient greek philosohper with ties to the Pluralist school. His metaphysical system is centered around mechanically necessitated Nous which governs, combines and diffuses the various \"roots\" of reality (known as \"homoioneroi\"). Unlike Empedocles' four \"root elements\" and similar to Democritus's multitude of atoms (yet not physical in nature), these homoioneroi are used by Anaxagoras to explain the multiplicity in reality and becoming. This pluralist theory of being influenced later thinkers such as Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz's theory of \"monads\" and Julius Bahnsen's idea of \"will henades\". The notion of a governing Nous would also be used by Socrates and Plato, but they will assign it a more active and rational role in their philosophical systems.\n\nAristotle incorporated these elements, but his substance pluralism was not material in essence. His hylomorphic theory allowed him to maintain a reduced set of basic material elements as per the Milesians, while answering for the ever-changing flux of Heraclitus and the unchanging unity of Parmenides. In his \"Physics,\" due to the continuum of Zeno's paradoxes, as well as both logical and empirical considerations for natural science, he presented numerous arguments against the atomism of Leucippus and Democritus, who posited a basic duality of \"void\" and \"atoms\". The atoms were an infinite variety of \"irreducibles\", of all shapes and sizes, which randomly collide and mechanically hook together in the void, thus providing a reductive account of changeable figure, order and position as aggregates of the unchangeable atoms.\n\nThe topic of ontological pluralism discusses different ways, kinds, or modes of being. Recent attention in ontological pluralism is due to the work of Kris McDaniel, who defends ontological pluralism in a number of papers. The name for the doctrine is due to Jason Turner, who, following McDaniel, suggests that \"In contemporary guise, it is the doctrine that a logically perspicuous description of reality will use multiple quantifiers which cannot be thought of as ranging over a single domain.\" \"There are numbers, fictional characters, impossible things, and holes. But, we don't think these things all exist in the same sense as cars and human beings.\"\n\nIt is common to refer to a film, novel or otherwise fictitious or virtual narrative as not being 'real'. Thus, the characters in the film or novel are not real, where the 'real world' is the everyday world in which we live. However, some authors may argue that fiction informs our concept of reality, and so has \"some\" kind of reality.\n\nLudwig Wittgenstein's notion of language-games argues that there is no overarching, single, fundamental ontology, but only a patchwork of overlapping interconnected ontologies ineluctably leading from one to another. For example, Wittgenstein discusses 'number' as technical vocabulary and in more general usage:\n\nEklund has argued that Wittgenstein's conception includes as a special case the technically constructed, largely autonomous, \"forms of language\" or \"linguistic frameworks\" of Carnap and Carnapian ontological pluralism. He places Carnap's ontological pluralism in the context of other philosophers, such as Eli Hirsch and Hilary Putnam.\n\nEpistemological pluralism is a term used in philosophy and in other fields of study to refer to different ways of knowing things, different epistemological methodologies for attaining a full description of a particular field. In the philosophy of science epistemological pluralism arose in opposition to reductionism to express the contrary view that at least some natural phenomena cannot be fully explained by a single theory or fully investigated using a single approach.\n\n\"Logical pluralism\" can be defined a number of ways: the position that there is more than one correct account of logical consequence (or no single, 'correct' account at all), that there is more than once correct set of logical constants or even that the 'correct' logic depends on the relevant logical questions under consideration (a sort of logical instrumentalism). Pluralism about logical consequence says that because different logical systems have different logical consequence relations, there is therefore more than one correct logic. For example, classical logic holds that the argument from explosion is a valid argument, but in Graham Priest's paraconsistent logic - LP, the 'Logic of Paradox' - it is an invalid argument. However, logical monists may respond that a plurality of logical theories does not mean that no single one of the theories is the correct one. After all, there are and have been a multitude of theories in physics, but that hasn't been taken to mean that all of them are correct.\n\nPluralists of the instrumentalist sort hold if a logic can be correct at all, it based on its ability to answer the logical questions under consideration. If one wants to understand vague propositions, one may need a many-valued logic. Or if one wants to know what the truth-value of the Liar Paradox is, a dialetheic paraconsistent logic may be required. Rudolf Carnap held to a version of logical pluralism:\n\n"}
{"id": "56345675", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=56345675", "title": "Predation risk allocation hypothesis", "text": "Predation risk allocation hypothesis\n\nThe predation risk allocation hypothesis attempts to explain how and why animals' behaviour and foraging strategies differ in various predatory situations, depending on their risk of endangerment. The hypothesis suggests that an animal's alertness and attention, along with its willingness to hunt for food, will change depending on the risk factors within that animal's environment and the presence of predators that could attack. The model assumes there are different levels of risk factors within various environments and prey animals will behave more cautiously when they are found in high-risk environments. The overall effectiveness of the model for predicting animal behaviour varies, therefore, its results are dependent on the prey species used in the model and how their behaviour changes. There are several reasons the predation risk allocation hypothesis was developed to observe how animal behaviour varies depending on its risk factors. Mixed results have been found for the model's effectiveness in predicting predator defensive behaviour for various species.\n\nThe hypothesis attempts to explain how animals demonstrate anti-predator behaviours in different environments depending on risk factors, ie. predatory threats. Threat levels can vary among different habitats, depending on the type of terrain and other animals inhibiting that zone.\n\nThere are two main predictions used in the predation risk allocation hypothesis. The first assumes that animals will increase foraging in safer environments, at times when predators are not present. The predicted advantage of foraging while predators are absent allows animals to eat and gain energy to then fight against predators upon their arrival.\n\nThe second prediction anticipates that animals will demonstrate less anti-predator behaviours when they have been in a high-risk environment for a long period of time. When significant time has passed in the same environmental location, the animal needs to eat to survive, therefore they are more likely to forage and spend less energy defending against predators when they have been in the same environment for a long period of time. These animals have to be less selective over their foraging times since they are not left with many options.\n\nThe model cannot be used for animals that exhibit control over their predation risk. These animals would not demonstrate the anticipated behavioural responses in accordance with the hypothesis predictions. For instance, if animals could control their predation risk, they would not exhibit avoidance behaviours in response to predation in safer situations and therefore not supporting the hypothesis. Another observation found animals with more time to learn about risk factors in their habitats were then better able to demonstrate behaviours found to be consistent with this hypothesis. Likewise, those animals without sufficient time to learn or understand the risk factors in their area will not display behaviours that support the hypothesis.\n\nVarious studies have observed the effectiveness of the predation risk allocation hypothesis for both vertebrate and invertebrate animals. The results both support and refute the hypothesis. \n\nFreshwater physid snails \"(Physella gyrina)\" act in accordance with the hypothesis in response to crayfish predators in their environments. The snails' frequency of activity, response to predators and interaction behaviours with their environments have been observed in different contexts. The physid snails' behaviour occurs in response to the level of predatory threat in their habitat area, they increase foraging and demonstrate higher activity measures in lower predation risk levels whereas they will decrease these behaviours in high risk predation areas.\n\nThe convict cichlids \"(Archocentrus nigrofasciatus)\" have been observed in two different contexts, high and low-risk predatory settings. These fish behave with less anti-predator and foraging behaviours when located in dangerous predatory areas, high-risk compared to the low-risk zones. These behaviour adjustments in various contexts support the risk allocation hypothesis since the animals follow its assumptions.\n\nTadpoles of the pool frog \"(Rana lessonae)\" do not follow the predictions risk allocation hypothesis with their foraging behaviours. Tadpoles were observed and these animals did not increase their foraging behaviours in zones with less threat. Instead, they continued a constant feeding pattern, not dependant on their living condition.\n\nBehaviour of bank voles \"(Clethrionomys glareolus)\" in response to least weasel prey does not support the risk allocation hypothesis, which can demonstrate that bank voles cannot assess risk in their territories. There were no changes in the foraging behaviours in different risk contexts or the amount of time these animals spent in these zones. The voles demonstrated more anti-predator behaviour in the high-risk situation however they did not increase their foraging behaviour in the high-risk zones. Since the bank vole behaviour was not demonstrated as predicted in both zones, they cannot be used to support the hypothesis.\n\nThe predation risk allocation hypothesis can help researchers learn how animals make behavioural responses to predators, since it is the first research that observes temporal variation in different risk situations. Animals' responses to predators can be better understood by observing behaviour adjustments to modified risk levels. The hypothesis however, does not explain behaviour in all types of variable risk situations, since this concept assumes that risk levels in every environment will change over time. The risk allocation hypothesis best supports observations of animal behaviour for those animals that developed and evolved in the same environments where they received information about that zone's local predators. These animals would therefore be most informed on what to expect and how to react in their environments. Animals that are exposed to risky situations i.e. predation, more frequently, may demonstrate similar behaviours in both high-risk and safe situations due to habituation. These animals become used to the constant threat and therefore would not act the same compared to animals who are not used to high-risk situations since they have become more immune to these instances. \n"}
{"id": "2283367", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2283367", "title": "Prelabor rupture of membranes", "text": "Prelabor rupture of membranes\n\nPrelabor rupture of membranes (PROM), also known as premature rupture of membranes, is breakage of the amniotic sac before the onset of labor. Women usually experience a painless gush or a steady leakage of fluid from the vagina. Complications in the baby may include premature birth, cord compression, and infection. Complications in the mother may include placental abruption and postpartum endometritis.\nRisk factors include infection of the amniotic fluid, prior PROM, bleeding in the later parts of pregnancy, smoking, and a mother who is underweight. Diagnosis is suspected based on symptoms and speculum exam and may be supported by testing the vaginal fluid or by ultrasound. If it occurs before 37 weeks it is known as preterm PROM otherwise it is known as term PROM.\nTreatment is based on how far along a women is in pregnancy and whether complications are present. In those at or near term without any complications, induction of labor is generally recommended. Time may also be provided for labor to begin spontaneously. In those 24 to 34 weeks of gestation without complications corticosteroids and close observation is recommended. Antibiotics may be given for those at risk of \"Group B streptococcus\". Delivery is generally indicated in those with complications, regardless of how far along in pregnancy. \nAbout 8% of term pregnancies are complicated by PROM while about 30% of preterm births are complicated by PROM. Before 24 weeks PROM occurs in fewer than 1% of pregnancies. Prognosis is primarily determined by complications related to prematurity such as necrotizing enterocolitis, intraventricular hemorrhage, and cerebral palsy.\nMost women will experience a painless leakage of fluid out of the vagina. They may notice either a distinct \"gush\" or a steady flow of small amounts of watery fluid in the absence of steady uterine contractions. Loss of fluid may be associated with the baby becoming easier to feel through the belly (due to the loss of the surrounding fluid), decreased uterine size, or meconium (fetal stool) seen in the fluid.\n\nThe cause of prelabor rupture of membranes (PROM) is not clearly understood, but the following are risk factors that increase the chance of it occurring. In many cases, however, no risk factor is identified.\n\nFetal membranes likely break because they become weak and fragile. This weakening is a normal process that typically happens at term as the body prepares for labor and delivery. However, this can be a problem when it occurs before 37 weeks (preterm). The natural weakening of fetal membranes is thought to be due to one or a combination of the following. In PROM, these processes are activated too early:\n\nInfection and inflammation likely explains why membranes break earlier than they are supposed to. In studies, bacteria have been found in the amniotic fluid from about one-third of cases of PROM. Often, testing of the amniotic fluid is normal, but a subclinical infection (too small to detect) or infection of maternal tissues adjacent to the amniotic fluid, may still be a contributing factor. In response to infection, the resultant infection and release of chemicals (cytokines) subsequently weakens the fetal membranes and put them at risk for rupture. PROM is also a risk factor in the development of neonatal infections.\n\nMany genes play a role in inflammation and collagen production, therefore inherited genes may play a role in predisposing a person to PROM.\n\nTo confirm if a woman has experienced prelabor rupture of membranes (PROM), a health care clinician must prove that the fluid leaking from the vagina is amniotic fluid, and that labor has not yet started. To do this, a careful medical history is taken, a gynecological exam is conducted using a sterile speculum, and an ultrasound of the uterus is performed. \n\nThe following tests should only be used if the diagnosis is still unclear after the standard tests above. \n\nIt is unclear if different methods of assessing the fetus in a woman with PPROM affects outcomes.\n\nLike amniotic fluid, blood, semen, vaginal secretions in the presence of infection, soap, urine, and cervical mucus also have an alkaline pH and can also turn nitrazine paper blue. Cervical mucus can also make a pattern similar to ferning on a microscope slide, but it is usually patchy and with less branching.\n\nOther conditions that may present similarly to premature rupture of membranes are the following:\n\nWomen who have had prelabor rupture of membranes (PROM) are more likely to experience it in future pregnancies. There is not enough data to recommend a way to specifically prevent future PROM. However, any woman that has had a history of preterm delivery, because of PROM or not, is recommended to take progesterone supplementation to prevent recurrence.\n\nThe management of PROM remains controversial, and depends largely on the gestational age of the fetus and other complicating factors. The risks of quick delivery (induction of labor) vs. watchful waiting in each case is carefully considered before deciding on a course of action.\n\nAs of 2012, the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists advised, based on expert opinion and not clinical evidence, that attempted delivery during maternal instability increases the rates of both fetal death and maternal death, unless the source of instability is an intrauterine infection.\n\nIn all women with PROM, the age of the fetus, its position in the uterus, and its well being should be evaluated. This can be done with ultrasound, Doppler fetal heart rate monitoring, and uterine activity monitoring. This will also show whether or not uterine contractions are happening which may be a sign that labor is starting. Signs and symptoms of infection should be closely monitored, and, if not already done, a group B streptococcus (GBS) culture should be collected.\n\nAt any age, if the fetal well-being appears to be compromised, or if intrauterine infection is suspected, the baby should be delivered quickly by induction of labour.\n\nBoth expectant management (watchful waiting) and an induction of labor (artificially stimulating labor) are considered in this case. 90% of women start labor on their own within 24 hours, and therefore it is reasonable to wait for 12–24 hours as long as there is no risk of infection. However, if labor does not begin soon after the PROM, an induction of labor is recommended because it reduces rates of infections, decreases the chances that the baby will require a stay in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), and does not increase the rate of caesarean sections. If a woman strongly does not want to be induced, watchful waiting is an acceptable option as long as there is no sign of infection, the fetus is not in distress, and she is aware and accepts the risks of PPROM. There is not enough data to show that the use of prophylactic antibiotics (to prevent infection) is beneficial for mothers or babies at or near term because of the potential side effects and development of antibiotic resistance.\n\nWhen the fetus is premature (less than 37 weeks gestation), the risk of being born prematurely must be weighed against the risk of PROM. As long as the fetus is 34 weeks or greater, delivery is recommended as if the baby was term.\n\nBefore 34 weeks, the fetus is at a much higher risk of the complications of prematurity. Therefore, as long as the fetus is doing well, and there are no signs of infection or placental abruption, watchful waiting (expectant management) is recommended. The younger the fetus, the longer it takes for labor to start on its own, but most women will deliver within a week. Waiting usually requires a woman to stay in the hospital so that health care providers can watch her carefully for infection, placental abruption, umbilical cord compression, or any other fetal emergency that would require quick delivery by induction of labor.\n\nIn 2017, a review of watchful waiting vs the early birth strategy was conducted to ascertain which was associated with a lower overall risk. Focusing on the 24–37-week range, the review analysed twelve randomised controlled trials from the \"Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth's Trials Register\", concluding that \"In women with PPROM before 37 weeks' gestation with no contraindications to continuing the pregnancy, a policy of expectant management with careful monitoring was associated with better outcomes for the mother and baby.\" \n\nThere is believed to be a correlation between volume of amniotic fluid retained and neonatal outcomes before 26 weeks' gestation. Amniotic fluid levels are an important consideration when debating expectant management vs clinical intervention, as low levels, or oligohydramnios, can result in lung and limb abnormalities. Additionally, labor and infection are less likely to occur when there are sufficient levels of amniotic fluid remaining in the uterus. Serial amnioinfusion in pregnancies with PPROM-related oligohydramnios at less than 26 weeks gestation, successfully alleviates oligohydramnios, with perinatal outcomes that are significantly better than the outcome in those with the persistent condition and is comparable with gestations with PPROM in which oligohydramnios never develops.\n\n\n\nBefore 24 weeks, a fetus is not viable meaning it cannot live outside the mother. In this case, either watchful waiting at home or an induction of labor done.\n\nBecause the risk of infection is so high, the mother should check her temperature often and return to the hospital if she develops any signs or symptoms of infection, labor, or vaginal bleeding. These women are typically admitted to the hospital once their fetus reaches 24 weeks and then managed the same as women with PPROM before 34 weeks (discussed above). When possible, these deliveries should take place in a hospital that has expertise in the management of the potential maternal and neonatal complications, and has the necessary infrastructure in place to support the care of these patients (ie. neonatal intensive care unit). Antenatal corticosteroids, latency antibiotics, magnesium sulfate, and tocolytic medications are not recommended until the fetus reaches viability (24 weeks). In cases of pre-viable PPROM, chance of survival of the fetus is between 15–50%, and the risk of chorioamnionitis is about 30%.\n\nChorioamnionitis is a bacterial infection of the fetal membranes, which can be life-threatening to both mother and fetus. Women with PROM at any age are at high risk of infection because the membranes are open and allow bacteria to enter. Women are checked often (usually every 4 hours) for signs of infection: fever (more than 38 °C or 100.5 °F), uterine pain, maternal tachycardia, fetal tachycardia, or foul-smelling amniotic fluid. Elevated white blood cells are not a good way to predict infection because they are normally high in labor. If infection is suspected, artificial induction of labor is started at any gestational age and broad antibiotics are given. Caesarean section should not be automatically done in cases of infection, and should only be reserved for the usual fetal emergencies.\n\nThe consequences of PROM depend on the gestational age of the fetus. When PROM occurs at term (after 36 weeks), it is typically followed soon thereafter by the start of labor and delivery. About half of women will give birth within 5 hours, and 95% will give birth within 28 hours without any intervention. The younger the baby, the longer the latency period (time between membrane rupture and start of labor). Rarely, in cases of preterm PROM, amniotic fluid will stop leaking and the amniotic fluid volume will return to normal.\n\nIf PROM occurs before 37 weeks, it is called preterm prelabor rupture of membranes (PPROM), and the baby and mother are at greater risk of complications. PPROM causes one-third of all preterm births. PROM provides a path for disease-causing organisms to enter the womb and puts both the mother and baby at risk for infection. Low levels of fluid around the baby also increase the risk of umbilical cord compression and can interfere with lung and body formation of the baby in early pregnancy.\n\nAt any gestational age, an opening in the fetal membranes provides a route for bacteria to enter the womb. This can lead to chorioamnionitis (an infection of the fetal membranes and amniotic fluid) which can be life-threatening to both the mother and fetus. The risk of infection increases the longer the membranes remain open and baby undelivered. Women with preterm PROM will develop an intra-amniotic infection 15–25% of the time, and the chances of infection increase at earlier gestational ages.\n\nPROM occurring before 37 weeks (PPROM) is one of the leading causes of preterm birth. Thirty to 35% of all preterm births are caused by PPROM. This puts the fetus at risk for the many complications associated with prematurity such as respiratory distress, brain bleeds, infection, necrotizing enterocolitis (death of the fetal bowels), brain injury, muscle dysfunction, and death. Prematurity from any cause leads to 75% of perinatal mortality and about 50% of all long-term morbidity. PROM is responsible for 20% of all fetal deaths between 24 and 34 weeks' gestation.\n\nBefore 24 weeks the fetus is still developing its organs, and the amniotic fluid is important for protecting the fetus against infection, physical impact, and for preventing the umbilical cord from becoming compressed. It also allows for fetal movement and breathing that is necessary for the development of the lungs, chest, and bones. Low levels of amniotic fluid due to mid-trimester or previable PPROM (before 24 weeks) can result in fetal deformity (e.g. Potter-like facies), limb contractures, pulmonary hypoplasia (underdeveloped lungs), infection (especially if the mother is colonized by group B streptococcus or bacterial vaginosis), prolapsed umbilical cord or compression, and placental abruption.\n\nMost cases of PROM occur spontaneously, but the risk of PROM in women undergoing a second trimester amniocentesis for prenatal diagnosis of genetic disorders is 1%. Although, no studies are known to account for all cases of PROM that stem from amniocentesis. This case, the chances of the membranes healing on their own and the amniotic fluid returning to normal levels is much higher than spontaneous PROM. Compared to spontaneous PROM, about 70% of women will have normal amniotic fluid levels within one month, and about 90% of babies will survive.\n\nOf term pregnancies (more than 37 weeks) about 8% are complicated by PROM, 20% of these become prolonged PROM. About 30% of all preterm deliveries (before 37 weeks) are complicated by PPROM, and rupture of membranes before viability (before 24 weeks) occurs in less than 1% of all pregnancies. Since there are significantly fewer preterm deliveries than term deliveries, the number of PPROM cases make up only about 5% of all cases of PROM.\n\n"}

Rancho Dobe's Storm (12 December, 1949 – October, 1960) also known as Storm or Stormie, a Doberman Pinscher, best known for being Best in Show at the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show in both 1952 and 1953. He was the grandson of the 1939 champion, Ferry v. Rauhfelsen of Giralda. Born in California, he was sold to his New York based owner Len Carey at the age of three months. At the age of sixteen months he won Best of Breed at his first adult dog show, something he would repeat in all 25 of the shows he was entered into, becoming undefeated in breed competition.\n\nHe became a popular sire, having sired over 300 puppies. Royal Doulton released a ceramic figurine of him, and the American Kennel Club inducted him in 1993 as one of only three conformation show dogs in the Hall of Fame at the Museum of the Dog in St. Louis, Missouri.\n\nStorm was born on 12 December, 1949, at the Ranch Dobe kennels in Van Nuys, California. He was one of thirteen puppies whelped by his mother, Champion Maedel von Randahof, who died shortly after giving birth. In addition to Storm, only three other puppies survived, Zephyr, Breeze and Gale – all females. The puppies great-grandsire was the 1939 Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show Best in Show winner, Ferry v. Rauhfelsen of Giralda. At the age of three months he was sold by his original owners, Mr and Mrs Brint Edwards to Len Carey, an advertising executive for Batten, Barton, Durstine & Osborn in New York. Carey had a standing order with the Edwards for the next male Doberman with conformation show potential.\n\nOnce in New York, Storm lived with Carey and his family in a 12th-floor apartment in Manhattan. Initially the dog had some difficulties with house training and using the elevators, but a strike by elevator workers in New York changed that. \"Twelve floors down and twelve floors up, four times a day. It housebroke the dog and made a man of my son Jeff.\" recalled Carey later in an interview for \"Life\" magazine. At the age of four months while being walked in Central Park he slipped off his lead while being walked by Mrs Carey, and was seized by a police officer. Charged with permitting an animal to run at large, his owners were fined $1. The normal range of fines for such a charge were between $5 and $25. On another occasion, Storm was left sitting in a parked car with the window open slightly. Mrs Carey returned to the car to find a drunken man had shoved his fist through the gap in the window and was waving his hand around Storm's nose. The dog did not bite, and the entire drive home simply laid down and trembled.\n\nThe family moved out of the city in 1951 to Cos Cob, Connecticut, from New York. Storm shared the bed of Jeff Carey, Len's son, and ate eggs, biscuits and canned beef for his meals.\n\nStorm was entered into his first adult show at the age of sixteen months at the Yonkers Kennel Club. He was named Best of Breed for Dobermans, although was defeated in the Group round by a Boxer who went on to become Best in Show. He had only been trained for ten hours in conformation show handling and maneuvers.\n\nMore titles followed, during the course of his career he was entered in 25 dog shows and won Best of Breed in all of them. Furthermore, he won his Group round on 22 occasions and was named Best in Show seventeen times. Storm was never entered into competition at the Westchester Kennel Club Shows as his owner was a club official. Len Carey claims that Storm knew how he had performed by the photographers after the event, \"He knows what a flashbulb is. He's a real ham.\" Although when a paper crown was placed on his head by a photographer, he knocked it to the floor, chewed on it and then buried it. At the Wilmington Kennel Club Dog Show on 28 April, 1951, he was named Best in Show, beating English Setter Ch. Sir Herbert Kennelworth into second place in front of a crowd of 2,000 people.\n\nHis thirteenth show was the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show in 1952, held at Madison Square Garden in New York. It was thirteen years since the only previous Doberman had won the title of Best in Show at the event, and the unlucky number was compounded as Stormie was registered in the show catalogue as #13. During the Best in Show round, Storm stood dead still for thirteen minutes while judge Joseph P. Sims reviewed the other competitors, a Dachshund, a Poodle, a Brussels Griffon, a Welsh Terrier and an English Setter. Sims said of Storm, \"The dog is a great showman and never lets up. I couldn't get away from him.\" Peter Knopp was Storm's handler during the event, it was the thirteenth occasion he had led a dog to Best in Show.\n\nStorm was entered in the 1953 Westminster Kennel Club in order to attempt to retain the title. Only five dogs had previously retained the title over the course of the previous 76 years. He won the Best of Breed title once more, beating 65 other Dobermans in the process. He went on to win the Best in Show title for the second time.\n\nStorm became a popular sire, having sired over 300 puppies by the time he competed at Westminster in 1954. Before his victory at the event in 1953, his stud fees were $100, which went up to $150 after the event. The Careys kept one of Storm's puppies, officially named Stormson, but known about the house as \"Mo\". In 1959, one of Storm's sons, named Storm's Donner, won Best in Show at the Westchester Kennel Club Dog Show, an event that Storm himself was never entered into. Donner was line bred to Storm, meaning that Storm was both the dog's father and grandfather.\n\nHis owner, Len Carey, would return to the Westminster show in 1964 and 1974, but this time as the Best in Show judge. He chose the Whippet Ch. Courtenay Fleetfoot of Pennyworth and the German Shorthaired Pointer Ch. Gretchenhof Columbia River for the titles, respectively. As of 2011, Storm remains in a group of only eight dogs who have won the Westminster show on more than one occasion, and the only Doberman to have done so.\n\nRoyal Doulton released a ceramic figurine of Storm between 1955 and 1985. By 2011, these figures were worth $165. Storm is one of only fourteen dogs inducted into the American Kennel Club's Hall of Fame at the Museum of the Dog in St. Louis, Missouri, having been inducted in 1993. He is one of only three show dogs to have been inducted, along with Ch. Bang Away of Sirrah Crest, a Boxer, and Ch. Vin-Melca's Vagabond, a Norwegian Elkhound.\n\n"}
{"id": "12215295", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12215295", "title": "Remarriage", "text": "Remarriage\n\nRemarriage is a marriage that takes place after a previous marital union has ended, as through divorce or widowhood.\nSome individuals are more likely to remarry than others; the likelihood can differ based on previous relationship status (e.g. divorced vs. widowed), level of interest in establishing a new romantic relationship, gender, race, and age among other factors. Those who choose not to remarry may prefer alternative arrangements like cohabitation or living apart together.\nRemarriage also provides mental and physical health benefits. However, although remarried individuals tend to have better health than individuals who do not repartner, they still generally have worse health than individuals who have remained continuously married.\n\nAs of 1995, depending on individual and contextual factors, up to 50% of couples in the USA ended their first marriage in divorce or permanent separation (i.e. the couple is not officially divorced but they no longer live together or share assets). Couples typically end their marriage because they are unhappy during the partnership; however, while these couples give up hope for their partner, this does not mean they give up on the institution of marriage. The majority of people who have divorced (close to 80%) go on to marry again. On average, they remarry just under 4 years after divorcing; younger adults tend to remarry more quickly than older adults. For ķn, just over half remarry in less than 5 years, and by 10 years after a divorce 75% have remarried.\n\nPeople may be eager to remarry because they do not see themselves as responsible for the previous marriage ending. Generally, they are more likely to believe their partner's behaviors caused the divorce, and minimize the influence of their own actions. Therefore, they remain optimistic that a new partnership will lead to better results.\n\nAccording to data analyzed by USA Today in 2013, remarriage rates in the United States have dropped by 40 percent over the last 20 years.\n\nNumerous religions and sects forbid, or formerly forbade, remarriage after divorce. Some still do, although in many countries the percentage of the populace that adhere to them has been shrinking for more than half a century. Old-fashioned terms for second marriage that date to the earlier era of more widespread censure include \"deuterogamy\" and \"digamy\", but the terms \"second marriage\" or \"remarriage\" are more readily understood.\n\nMany factors influence the likelihood of remarrying after a divorce. Based on the 2006 census, men remarry more often than women. Remarriage rates also differ by ethnicity; remarriage is most common among White women, while Black women have the lowest probability of marrying again. Age is another determining factor; women who are older than 25 at the time of divorce are less likely to remarry than women who are younger at the time of marital dissolution. Having children is associated with higher rates of remarriage for men and women. Remarriage also differs by community setting. Women from urban areas or areas with a greater proportion of women who never married are less likely to marry again. Some environmental factors do not affect all ethnicities: only non-White women from communities with high unemployment and poverty have reduced likelihood of remarriage.\n\nSome women enter cohabiting relationships after a divorce instead of remarrying. This pattern of cohabiting after a divorce is more likely for White than Black women, for women without religious affiliation, with few or no children, and who live in more economically stable communities.\n\nOn the whole, remarriages are associated with greater socioeconomic security and life satisfaction compared to remaining divorced or separated. People who remarry tend to have better adjustment to their divorce, reporting more positive evaluations of their lives compared to divorced individuals who remain single. While divorced couples have a higher risk of developing a wide range of physical and mental health problems, remarrying may attenuate, but not eliminate, some of these health risks.\nSecond Marriages: Triumph of decision over hope?\nIt is often assumed that second marriages are riskier than first marriages - “The triumph of hope over experience” as popularised by Samuel Johnson in 1791. A new analysis of data commissioned from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) challenges this assumption. In fact, second marriages overall do consistently better than first marriages. Where one or both spouses are marrying for the second time, couples marrying today face an estimated 31% risk of divorce during their lifetime, compared to an estimated 45% risk of divorce amongst couples where both spouses are marrying for the first time.\nHowever, second marriages do not always fare any better than the first. Again the rates of divorce and separation vary based on demographic and social factors. Second marriage disruptions are more likely for Black women and for women in communities that are less economically well off. Conversely, rates of divorce decline as age at the time of second marriage increases. Also, women who enter their second marriage with no children are generally more likely to sustain their marriages.\n\nThere are several reasons why second marriages can be more vulnerable to disruption. Partners bring the same personal qualities to their subsequent marriage as they had during the first, but some of these qualities may have contributed to the first marriage’s problems. People who have divorced and remarried multiple times tend to be relatively impulsive and nonconformist. In second marriages, partners also often have to deal with additional complications that do not exist in first marriages, like combining families. Remarriages involving stepchildren have a greater rate of dissolution than those without.\n\nAs of the 2006 census, 32% of the U.S. population over age 65 was widowed. Most people successfully adjust after losing a partner; research on bereavement patterns finds the most frequent outcome is resilience. Even so, remarriage rates among older widowers are fairly low, and even lower among older widows. However, looking at rates of remarriage vastly underestimates interest in new romantic relationships.\n\nMen and women not only have different remarriage rates, but they also differ in their desire to repartner (to establish a new romantic relationship). A year and a half after the death of a spouse, 15% of widows and 37% of widowers ages 65 and older were interested in dating. Differences in desire to repartner may stem from the different benefits men and women receive in and outside of a marriage.\n\nThe most frequent reasons older adults give for remaining without a partner after losing a spouse are gender-specific. While the common myth is \"women grieve, men replace,\" research does not support this pattern. Rather, widows are more likely to report that they are reluctant to give up newfound freedom and independence. Many widows perceive a sense of liberation no longer having to take care of another person, and value this more than additional companionship. Widowers, on the other hand, tend to report that they have not repartnered because they are concerned about being undesirable partners due to older age and ill health.\n\nSome studies have found that women who are not interested in a new relationship have explicitly decided to remain unpartnered. In contrast, men were more likely to report that they would not rule out the possibility but had not encountered a suitable relationship yet. Interviews indicate that widowers are more prepared than widows to take a chance on a new relationship.\n\nAmong widows, social support appears to promote interest in new intimate partnerships. Widows with confidants are more interested in repartnering than those without close friends. However, for men this pattern may be reversed. While overall widowers are more interested in remarriage than widows, only the men with low or average levels of support from friends are any more likely than women to report desire to remarry in the future. When widowers have high levels of social support from friends, they have equivalent levels of interest as widows. This suggests that men may be more motivated to repartner if they do not have as much social support as they would like. Women on the other hand tend to have more diverse sources of social support within their social networks.\n\nAlthough the gender differences in desire to repartner are most well documented,\nyounger age and greater unhappiness also predict increased interest in remarriage.\n\nMen are more likely to repartner after losing their spouse; more than 60% of men but less than 20% of women are involved in a new romance or remarried within just over two years of being widowed. Interest in repartnering is only one factor in determining the likelihood that a widow or widower will establish a new romantic relationship. Davidson (2002) describes a framework which proposes three primary intervening conditions affecting likelihood of repartnering following widowhood: availability of partners, the feasibility of a relationship, and desirability of companionship.\n\nThere are frequent gender differences in availability, desirability, and feasibility of new relationships. Availability of partners is a greater constraint for older widows; there are far fewer partners available for older women than older men, given that women tend to live longer and men tend to prefer younger partners. As detailed in the previous section, older widowers also typically have greater desire to repartner than widows.\n\nStudies have identified many other factors that increase or decrease the likelihood of successfully repartnering following widowhood. Most of these factors fit within Davidson’s framework. For widows, younger age is associated with greater probability of repartnering; younger women typically have more available potential partners. For widowers, new romance is predicted by greater income and education. In Davidson's model, feasibility of a relationship is affected by age, health, and financial resources; being younger, healthier, and having financial resources makes one a more attractive partner.\n\nWidowed older adults show high increases in loneliness, but expanding their social network or repartnering can attenuate this loneliness. Dating and remarriage following widowhood appear to be both fairly common and highly adaptive responses. Surviving spouses who remarry within about 1–5 years of being widowed have more positive outcomes (e.g. greater wellbeing, greater life satisfaction, and less depression) than widows and widowers who have not remarried. Further research has shown this reduced depression in repartnered compared to single widows and widowers is due to the remarried individuals’ greater socioeconomic resources. For example, compared to widows who do not remarry, remarried widows tend to report higher household incomes and are less likely to report anxiety about financial matters.\n\nRemarriage is not always the goal or ideal arrangement for divorced and widowed adults. Especially among older adults, there is a growing acceptance and interest in alternative romantic commitments like cohabitation or Living Apart Together (LAT). While for younger adults cohabitation is typically a precursor to marriage, older adults have additional reasons why they may not want to remarry and cohabiting may be the ideal partnership. For some, remarriage inspires feelings of disloyalty, and adult children can discourage remarriage based on concerns about inheritance. Many older women are interested in companionship but may want to avoid long-term obligations and are hesitant to give up their new independence. However, an arrangement called Living Apart Together (LAT) offers an appealing alternative; it is a form of intimate ongoing companionship that allows each partner to maintain autonomy and independent households.\n\nHealth is influenced both by current marital status and marital transition history. Marriage confers mental and physical health advantages, but remarried individuals who have been widowed or divorced continue to be disadvantaged compared to continuously married individuals.\n\nMarriage has been shown to impart significant mental health benefits and remarriage seems to be protective as well. Overall, people who remarry have lower levels of depressive symptoms compared to others who have lost a partner (through widowhood, divorce, or separation) and remain single. Remarriage seems to be especially beneficial for men, who have lower levels of depressive symptoms than remarried women.\n\nHowever, the health benefits of remarriage do not appear to be as strong as those for continuous marriage. Several studies have found that the mental and physical health benefits of remarriage do not fully balance out the negative effects of a previous marital disruption. Compared to the strong advantage of being continuously married, the mental health benefits are progressively weaker the more previous marriages a person has had. Although men seem to benefit as much from remarriage as being continuously married, remarried women have weaker mental health benefits.\n\nThe mental health differences between remarried women and unpartnered women appear to be due to differences in economic resources and social support. Findings also indicate that the mental health benefit of marriage for women is primarily driven by the fact that married women tend to be physically healthier than cohabiting and unpartnered women. There may be a selection effect whereby healthy women are more likely to remarry, and subsequently, based on their greater physical health, experience less depression. On the other hand, even when controlling for economic resources, social support, and health, married men experience fewer depressive symptoms compared to cohabiting or unpartnered men. This is likely because depression symptoms in married men are so low.\n\nThe physical health benefits of marriage are well documented, but marital disruptions have been shown to negatively affect health. Remarriage can attenuate but not completely eliminate the negative health effects of a marital disruption. Among currently married persons, those who have previously been divorced or widowed have worse health than those who have been continuously married. Research has not found any difference in physical health between persons with only one compared to multiple marital disruptions. The lingering negative health effects of marital disruption include increased risk for chronic conditions (e.g. diabetes and heart disease) and mobility limitations (e.g. difficulty walking a block or climbing stairs). However, it is also important to consider that it is difficult to determine causality; it is possible that a person’s health determines their likelihood of marrying and experiencing a disruption. In fact, it is possible that there are effects in both directions.\n\n"}

The eight-county region, officially named the Raleigh–Durham–Chapel Hill combined statistical area (CSA), comprises the Raleigh and Durham–Chapel Hill metropolitan areas and the Dunn, Henderson, Oxford, and Sanford Micropolitan Statistical Areas.\n\nA 2017 Census estimate put the population at 2,156,253, making it the second largest metropolitan area in the state of North Carolina behind Charlotte. The Raleigh–Durham television market includes a broader 24-county area which includes Fayetteville, North Carolina, and has a population of 2,726,000 persons.\n\nThe \"Triangle\" name was cemented in the public consciousness in the 1950s with the creation of Research Triangle Park, home to numerous high-tech companies and enterprises. Although the name is now used to refer to the geographic region, \"the Triangle\" originally referred to the universities, whose research facilities, and the educated workforce they provide, have historically served as a major attraction for businesses located in the region.\n\nMost of the Triangle is part of North Carolina's second, fourth, and thirteenth congressional districts.\n\nThe region is sometimes confused with The Triad, which is a North Carolina region adjacent to and directly west of the Triangle comprising Greensboro, Winston-Salem, and High Point, among other cities.\n\nDepending on which definition of the Research Triangle region is used, as few as three or as many as 16 counties are included as part of the region. All of these counties when included hold a population over 2,167,000 people.\n\nRaleigh–Durham-Chapel Hill Combined Statistical Area\nPopulation (Census Estimates 2017) 2,199,459\n\nThe Triangle region, as defined for statistical purposes as the Raleigh–Durham–Chapel Hill CSA, comprises eight counties, although the U.S. Census Bureau divided the region into two metropolitan statistical areas and one micropolitan area in 2003. The Raleigh metropolitan area comprises Wake,Franklin, and Johnston Counties; the Durham-Chapel Hill metropolitan area comprises Durham, Orange, Chatham, and Person Counties; and the Dunn micropolitan area comprises Harnett County.\n\nSome area television stations define the region as Raleigh–Durham–Fayetteville. Fayetteville is more than from Raleigh, but is part of the Triangle television market.\n\n\nPublic secondary education in the Triangle is similar to that of the majority of the state of North Carolina, in which there are county-wide school systems (the exception is Chapel Hill-Carrboro City Schools within Orange County but apart from Orange County Schools). Based in Cary, the Wake County Public School System, which includes the cities of Raleigh and Cary, is the largest school system in the state of North Carolina and the 15th-largest in the United States, with average daily entollment of 159,949 as of the second month of the 2016-17 school year. Other larger systems in the region include Durham Public Schools (about 33,000 students) and rapidly growing Johnston County Schools (about 31,000 students).\n\n\nWith the significant number of universities and colleges in the area and the relative absence of major league professional sports, NCAA sports are very popular, particularly those sports in which the Atlantic Coast Conference participates, most notably basketball.\n\nThe Duke Blue Devils (representing Duke University in Durham), NC State Wolfpack (representing North Carolina State University in Raleigh), and North Carolina Tar Heels (representing the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill) are all members of the ACC. Rivalries among these schools are very strong, fueled by proximity to each other, with annual competitions in every sport. Adding to the rivalries is the large number of graduates the high schools in the region send to each of the local universities. It is very common for students at one university to know many students attending the other local universities, which increases the opportunities for \"bragging\" among the schools. The four ACC schools in the state, Duke, North Carolina, North Carolina State, and Wake Forest University (the last of which was originally located in the town of Wake Forest before moving to Winston-Salem in 1956), are referred to as Tobacco Road by sportscasters, particularly in basketball. All four teams consistently produce high-caliber teams. Each of the Triangle-based universities listed has won at least two NCAA Basketball national championships.\n\nThree historically black colleges, including recent Division I arrival North Carolina Central University and Division II members St. Augustine College and Shaw University also boost the popularity of college sports in the region.\n\nOther colleges in the Triangle that field intercollegiate teams include Campbell University, Meredith College, and William Peace University.\n\nThe region has only one professional team of the four major sports, the Carolina Hurricanes of the NHL, based in Raleigh. Since moving to the Research Triangle region from Hartford, Connecticut, they have enjoyed great success, including winning a Stanley Cup. With only one top-level professional sports option, minor league sports are quite popular in the region. The Durham Bulls in downtown Durham are a AAA Minor League baseball affiliate of the Tampa Bay Rays, and the Carolina Mudcats, based in Zebulon, 10 miles east of Raleigh, are the Advanced-A affiliate of the Milwaukee Brewers. In Cary, North Carolina FC plays in the second-level United Soccer League, and the North Carolina Courage began play in the National Women's Soccer League in 2017 after the owner of North Carolina FC bought the NWSL franchise rights of the Western New York Flash and relocated the NWSL franchise to the Triangle.\n\nThe area also had a team in the fledgling World League of American Football – however, the Raleigh–Durham Skyhawks, coached by Roman Gabriel, did not exactly cover themselves in glory; they lost all 10 games of their inaugural (and only) season in 1991. The team folded after that, being replaced in the league by the Ohio Glory, which fared little better at 1-9, ultimately suffering the same fate – along with the other six teams based in North America – when the league took a two-year hiatus, returning as a six-team all-European league in 1995.\n\nWith over 1200 active participants in multiple recreation centers and university campuses throughout the area, Research Triangle is home to one of the largest badminton communities in the Southeastern United States. The American Badminton Academy is also located here in a dedicated facility with seven permanent courts. The Academy is unique among U.S. badminton facilities in that it hosts an international player development program run by Dennis Christensen, an Olympic-level coach from Denmark.\n\nAnchored by leading technology firms, government and world-class universities, medical centers and schools, the area's economy has performed exceptionally well. Significant increases in employment, earnings, personal income, and retail sales are projected over the next 15 years.\n\nThe region's growing high-technology community includes such companies as IBM, SAS Institute, Cisco Systems, NetApp, Red Hat, EMC Corporation, and Credit Suisse First Boston. In addition to high-tech, the region is consistently ranked in the top three in the U.S. with concentration in life science companies. Some of these companies include GlaxoSmithKline, Biogen Idec, BASF, Merck & Co., Novo Nordisk, Novozymes, and Pfizer. Research Triangle Park and North Carolina State University's Centennial Campus in Raleigh support innovation through R&D and technology transfer among the region's companies and research universities (including Duke University and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill).\n\nThe area fared relatively well during the late-2000s recession, ranked as the strongest region in North Carolina by the Brookings Institution and among the top 40 in the country. The change in unemployment during 2008 to 2009 was 4.6% and home prices was 2%. The Greensboro metropolitan area was listed among the second-weakest and the Charlotte area among the middle in the country.\n\nThe Research Triangle region is served by these hospitals and medical centers:\n\nThe Triangle proper is served by three major interstate highways: I-40, I-85, and I-87 along with their spurs: I-440 and I-540, and seven U.S. Routes: 1, 15, 64, 70, 264, 401, and 501. US Highways 15 and 501 are multiplexed through much of the region as US 15-501. I-95 passes 30 miles east of Raleigh through Johnston County, with I-87 connecting I-95 at Rocky Mount, NC to Raleigh via the US 64-264 Bypass.\n\nThe two interstates diverge from one another in Orange County, with I-85 heading northeast through northern Durham County toward Virginia, while I-40 travels southeast through southern Durham, through the center of the region, and serves as the primary freeway through Raleigh. The related loop freeways I-440 and I-540 are primarily located in Wake County around Raleigh. I-440 begins at the interchange of US 1 and I-40 southwest of downtown Raleigh and arcs as a multiplex with US 1 northward around downtown with the formal designation as the Cliff Benson/Raleigh Beltline (cosigned with US 1 on three-fourths of its northern route) and ends at its junction with I-40 in southeast Raleigh. I-540, sometimes known as the Raleigh Outer Loop, extends from the US 64-264 Bypass to I-40 just inside Durham County, where it continues across the interstate as a state route (NC 540), prior to its becoming a toll road from the NC 54 interchange to the current terminus at NC Highway 55 near Holly Springs. I-95 serves the extreme eastern edge of the region, crossing north-south through suburban Johnston County.\n\nU.S. Routes 1, 15, and 64 primarily serve the region as limited-access freeways or multilane highways with access roads. US 1 enters the region from the southwest as the Claude E. Pope Memorial Highway and travels through suburban Apex where it merges with US 64 and continues northeast through Cary. The two highways are codesignated for about until US 1 joins I-440 and US 64 with I-40 along the Raleigh–Cary border. Capital Boulevard, which is designated US 1 for half of its route and US 401 the other is not a limited-access freeway, although it is a major thoroughfare through northeast Raleigh and into the northern downtown area.\n\nNorth Carolina Highway 147 is a limited-access freeway that connects I-85 with Toll Route NC 540 in northwestern Wake County. The older, toll-free portion of the four-lane route—known as the Durham Freeway or the I.L. \"Buck\" Dean Expressway—traverses downtown Durham and extends through Research Triangle Park to I-40. The Durham Freeway is often used as a detour or alternate route for I-40 through southwestern Durham the Chapel Hill area in cases of traffic accident, congestion or road construction delays. The tolled portion of NC 147, called the Triangle Expressway—North Carolina's first modern toll road when it opened to traffic in late 2011—continues past I-40 to Toll NC 540. Both Toll NC 147 and Toll NC 540 are modern facilities which collect tolls using transponders and license plate photo-capture technology.\n\nA partnering system of multiple public transportation agencies currently serves the Triangle region under the joint GoTransit branding. Raleigh is served by the Capital Area Transit (CAT) municipal transit system, while Durham has the Durham Area Transit Authority (DATA) system. Chapel Hill is served by Chapel Hill Transit, and Cary is served by C-Tran public transit systems. However, Triangle Transit, formerly called the Triangle Transit Authority (TTA), works in cooperation with all area transit systems by offering transfers between its own routes and those of the other systems. Triangle Transit also coordinates an extensive vanpool and rideshare program that serves the region's larger employers and commute destinations.\n\nPlans have been made to merge all of the area's municipal systems into Triangle Transit, and Triangle Transit also has proposed a regional rail system to connect downtown Durham, downtown Cary and downtown Raleigh with multiple suburban stops, as well as stops in the Research Triangle Park area. The agency's initial proposal was effectively cancelled in 2006, however, when the agency could not procure adequate federal funding. A committee of local business, transportation and government leaders currently are working with Triangle Transit to develop a new transit blueprint for the region, with various modes of rail transit, as well as bus rapid transit, open as options for consideration.\n\nThe General Assembly of North Carolina chartered the Raleigh–Durham Aeronautical Authority in 1939, which was changed in 1945 to the Raleigh–Durham Airport Authority. The first new terminal opened in 1955. Terminal A (now Terminal 1) opened in 1981. American Airlines began service to RDU in 1985.\n\nRDU opened the runway, 5L-23R, in 1986. American Airlines opened its north-south hub operation at RDU in the new Terminal C in June 1987, greatly increasing the size of RDU's operations with a new terminal including a new apron and runway. American brought RDU its first international flights to Bermuda, Cancun, Paris and London.\n\nIn 1996, American Airlines ceased its hub operations at RDU due to Pan Am and Eastern Airlines. Pan Am and Eastern were Miami's main tenants until 1991, when both carriers went bankrupt. Their hubs at MIA were taken over by United Airlines and American Airlines. This created a difficulty in competing with US Airways' hub in Charlotte and Delta Air Lines' hub in Atlanta, Georgia for passengers traveling between smaller cities in the North and South. Midway Airlines entered the market, starting service in 1995 with the then somewhat novel concept of 50-seat Canadair Regional Jets providing service from its RDU hub primarily along the East Coast. Midway, originally incorporated in Chicago, had some success after moving its operations to the midpoint of the eastern United States at RDU and its headquarters to Morrisville, NC. The carrier ultimately could not overcome three weighty challenges: the arrival of Southwest Airlines, the refusal of American Airlines to renew the frequent flyer affiliation it had with Midway (thus dispatching numerous higher fare-paying businesspeople to airlines with better reward destinations), and the significant blow of September 11, 2001. Midway Airlines filed Chapter 11 bankruptcy on August 13, 2001, and ceased operations entirely on October 30, 2003.\n\nIn February 2000, RDU was ranked as the nation's second fastest-growing major airport in the United States, by Airports Council International, based on 1999 statistics. Passenger growth hit 24% over the previous year, ranking RDU second only to Washington Dulles International Airport. RDU opened Terminal A south concourse for use by Northwest and Continental Airlines in 2001. The addition added and five aircraft gates to the terminal. Terminal A became designated as Terminal 1 on October 26, 2008. In 2003, RDU also dedicated a new general aviation terminal. RDU continues to keep pace with its growth by redeveloping Terminal C into a new state-of-the-art terminal, now known as Terminal 2, which opened in October 2008.\n\nCarriers at RDU International Airport:\n\nIn addition to RDU, several smaller publicly owned general-aviation airports also operate in the metropolitan region:\n\nSeveral licensed private general-aviation and agricultural airfields are located in the region's suburban areas and nearby rural communities:\n\nThese licensed heliports serve the Research Triangle region:\n\nA number of helipads (i.e. marked landing sites not classified under the FAA LID system) also serve a variety of additional medical facilities (such as UNC Hospitals in Chapel Hill), as well as private, corporate and governmental interests, throughout the region.\n\nAmtrak serves the region with the Silver Meteor, Silver Star, Palmetto, Carolinian, and Piedmont routes.\n\nAlthough still in the planning and evaluation phases as of the end of 2014, the SEHSR (Southeast High Speed Rail Corridor) project is expected to serve the area.\n\n\"Notable shopping centers and malls:\"\n\n\n\n\"Other shopping centers\"\n\n\"Notable locally based or independent retailer:\"\n\nFilm festivals and events:\nNotable performing arts and music venues:\nTheatre and dance events:\nMusic festivals:\nMovie theatre chains:\n\nThe area is part of the Raleigh–Durham–Fayetteville television designated media area and is the 25th-largest in the country with 1,135,920 households (2014) included in that area and the second largest television market in North Carolina. It is part of the Raleigh–Durham Nielsen Audio radio market (code 115) and is the 42nd-largest in the country with a population of 1,365,900.\n\nThe Raleigh–Durham–Fayetteville market is defined by Nielsen as including Chatham, Cumberland, Dunn, Durham, Granville, Halifax, Harnett, Hoke, Johnston, Lee, Moore, Northampton, Orange, Robeson, Vance, Wake, Warren, Wayne, and Wilson Counties, along with parts of Franklin County.\n\nNumerous newspapers and periodicals serve the Triangle market.\n\n\n\n\nThe Triangle is part of the Raleigh–Durham–Fayetteville Designated Market Area for broadcast television. –16, the area was the 25th-largest in the country.

The ship was owned by the St. Lawrence & Chicago Steam and Navigation Company of Toronto, Ontario, with the official registry number 131090.\n\nThe \"Carruthers\" was lost 9 November 1913 on Lake Huron during the Great Lakes Storm of 1913. The crew of 22 perished with the vessel.\n\nThe \"James Carruthers\" was built at Collingwood, Ontario by the Collingwood Shipbuilding Company, her hull number was 00038. She was a steel hulled, propeller driven lake freighter; 550 feet in length, 58 feet wide and 27 feet deep. The gross tonnage was 7862 and the net tonnage 5606.\n\nOn the evening of November 6, 1913, the \"James Carruthers\" loaded a total of 375,000 bushels of wheat at Fort William, Ontario. Her destination was Midland, Ontario, on the shores of Georgian Bay. Captain William H. Wright had conferred with another downbound skipper, S.A. Lyons of the \"J.H. Sheadle\", and planned to travel down Lake Superior together. Wright commented on his new boat, \"We've still to learn all her tricks, and some of the lads in the fo'c'sle are complaining that the paint in their rooms is still a little sticky.\"\n\nBy 3 o'clock on the morning of Saturday, November 8, the first hints of the storm blew over Lake Superior. The winds quickly shifted from southwest to northwest, bringing with them freezing temperatures, snow squalls, and high waves. The \"Carruthers\" and the \"Sheadle\" were better than halfway to the Soo when the storm hit. By the evening, both vessels were locking through and snaking their way down the St. Mary's River. While going down the river the Canadian freighter passed the upbound \"Midland Prince\". Angus \"Ray\" McMillan, wheelsman of the \"Carruthers\", sighted his friend Jack Daley aboard the \"Prince\" and yelled out, \"We're going to Midland this time, Jack! I'll tell your father we passed you!\" At 12:53 on the morning of Sunday, November 9, the \"Carruthers\" was sighted taking on coal at the Picklands, Mather & Company dock near De Tour, Michigan. Shortly after refueling, the \"James Carruthers\" entered Lake Huron, with the \"J.H. Sheadle\" a short distance behind. The lights of the \"Carruthers\" were visible for a short time aboard the \"Sheadle\" as they sailed on a southeastern heading. A little after dawn, the \"Carruthers\" turned to port on a course that would keep her south of Great Duck Island and on a straight line for Georgian Bay. The \"Carruthers\" hasn't been seen since.\n\nAfter the great storm finally blew itself out late on Monday, November 10, copious amounts of wreckage from several boats began to wash onto Lake Huron's shores. Evidence of the \"James Carruthers\" was slow at first, until great amounts of debris from Canada's newest and largest freighter began coming ashore, mostly near Kincardine and Point Clark. A large field of wreckage was found offshore between Kincardine and Goderich, nearly seventy miles (113 km) south of the \"Carruthers\"'s known course. Several bodies of the crew washed ashore as well, mostly around Point Clark. Captain Wright was identified by his large red mustache. Most of the bodies wore life jackets and heavy coats, indicating that they had had time to prepare for disaster. During the height of the storm late on the afternoon of the 9th, several witnesses heard steamer whistles and sighted distress rockets far offshore of Inverhuron. It was concluded that the rockets were from the \"Carruthers\" as most of her wreckage and crew were found in the vicinity. How the brand-new freighter sank, and how she came to be so far off course (she was bound for Georgian Bay) are mysteries that have never been answered. As of 2018, the wreck of the \"James Carruthers\" has not been located, she is also the largest unidentified shipwreck on the lakes.\n\nBy the evening of Tuesday, November 11, there were still several unidentified bodies in the Goderich morgue from a few different vessels. Thomas Thompson of Hamilton, Ontario scanned the corpses for signs of his son John, a crewman aboard the \"James Carruthers\". Thomas saw one body who looked a lot like his son. The facial features and hair color were identical. The corpse was missing an eyetooth like his son and had a tattoo of J.T. on the left forearm. Several scars and a birth defect (the second and third toes of the feet grew together) convinced Thomas Thompson that he had finally found his son John. He arranged to take possession of the body and notified his family.\n\nMeanwhile, in Toronto, John Thompson read newspaper accounts of the great storm and saw his name on a list of the known dead. Thompson had not accompanied the \"Carruthers\" on its final voyage. Instead of immediately wiring his family, young Thompson leisurely took a train to Hamilton to explain what happened in person. While John dawdled, his father Thomas had purchased a coffin, somberly watched as a grave was dug, and made funeral preparations for his dead son. Once in Hamilton, John still inexplicably wandered around town, visiting a friend who advised him to return home at once. Young Thompson walked into his family's house while the wake was in progress. Mrs. Thompson, after the tremendous shock, was overjoyed that her son was still alive. Thomas Thompson was angered beyond belief at the debts incurred and shame, and yelled \"It's just like you to come home and attend your own wake, and you can get right out of this house until this thing blows over!\" The young man whom Thomas Thompson mistook for his son remains unidentified to this day; he rests with four other unknown sailors in Goderich, Ontario.\n\n"}

{"id": "583073", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=583073", "title": "Segmentation (biology)", "text": "Segmentation (biology)\n\nSegmentation in biology is the division of some animal and plant body plans into a series of repetitive segments. This article focuses on the segmentation of animal body plans, specifically using the examples of the taxa Arthropoda, Chordata, and Annelida. These three groups form segments by using a \"growth zone\" to direct and define the segments. While all three have a generally segmented body plan and use a growth zone, they use different mechanisms for generating this patterning. Even within these groups, different organisms have different mechanisms for segmenting the body. Segmentation of the body plan is important for allowing free movement and development of certain body parts. It also allows for regeneration in specific individuals.\n\nSegmentation is a difficult process to satisfactorily define. Many taxa (for instance the molluscs) have some form of serial repetition in their units, but are not conventionally thought of as segmented. Segmented animals are those considered to have organs that were repeated, or to have a body composed of self-similar units, but usually it is the parts of an organism that are referred to as being segmented.\n\nSegmentation in animals typically falls into three types, characteristic of different arthropods, vertebrates, and annelids. Arthropods such as the fruit fly form segments from a field of equivalent cells based on transcription factor gradients. Vertebrates like the zebrafish use oscillating gene expression to define segments known as somites. Annelids such as the leech use smaller blast cells budded off from large teloblast cells to define segments.\n\nAlthough \"Drosophila\" segmentation is not representative of the arthropod phylum in general, it is the most highly studied. Early screens to identify genes involved in cuticle development led to the discovery of a class of genes that was necessary for proper segmentation of the \"Drosophila\" embryo.\n\nTo properly segment the \"Drosophila\" embryo, the anterior-posterior axis is defined by maternally supplied transcripts giving rise to gradients of these proteins. This gradient then defines the expression pattern for gap genes, which set up the boundaries between the different segments. The gradients produced from gap gene expression then define the expression pattern for the pair-rule genes. The pair-rule genes are mostly transcription factors, expressed in regular stripes down the length of the embryo. These transcription factors then regulate the expression of segment polarity genes, which define the polarity of each segment. Boundaries and identities of each segment are later defined.\n\nWithin the arthropods, the body wall, nervous system, kidneys, muscles and body cavity are segmented, as are the appendages (when they are present). Some of these elements (e.g. musculature) are not segmented in their sister taxon, the onychophora.\n\nWhile not as well studied as in \"Drosophila\" and zebrafish, segmentation in the leech has been described as “budding” segmentation. Early divisions within the leech embryo result in teloblast cells, which are stem cells that divide asymmetrically to create bandlets of blast cells. Furthermore, there are five different teloblast lineages (N, M, O, P, and Q), with one set for each side of the midline. The N and Q lineages contribute two blast cells for each segment, while the M, O, and P lineages only contribute one cell per segment. Finally, the number of segments within the embryo is defined by the number of divisions and blast cells. Segmentation appears to be regulated by the gene Hedgehog, suggesting its common evolutionary origin in the ancestor of arthropods and annelids.\n\nWithin the annelids, as with the arthropods, the body wall, nervous system, kidneys, muscles and body cavity are generally segmented. However, this is not true for all of the traits all of the time: many lack segmentation in the body wall, coelom and musculature.\n\nAlthough perhaps not as well studied as \"Drosophila\", segmentation in zebrafish is actively studied. The process is similar in zebrafish and other chordates, such as the chicken and the mouse. Segmentation in chordates is characterized as the formation of a pair of somites on either side of the midline. This is often referred to as somitogenesis.\n\nIn the zebrafish, segmentation is coordinated by the clock and wavefront model. The \"clock\" refers to the periodic oscillation of specific genes, such as Her1, a hairy/Enhancer of split- gene. Expression starts at the posterior end of the embryo and moves towards the anterior. The wavefront is where the somites mature, defined by gradients of retinoic acid and FGF. Retinoic acid is high in the anterior and FGF is high in the posterior; the wavefront is the point at which both concentrations are at their lowest. Cells at this point will mature and form a pair of somites. Elaboration of this process with other signalling chemicals allows for structures such as muscles to span the basic segments.\n\nIn other taxa, there is some evidence of segmentation in some organs, but this segmentation is not pervasive to the full list of organs mentioned above for arthropods and annelids. One might think of the serially repeated units in many Cycloneuralia, or the segmented body armature of the chitons (which is not accompanied by a segmented coelom).\n\nSegmentation can be seen as originating in two ways. To caricature, the 'amplification' pathway would involve a single-segment ancestral organism becoming segmented by repeating itself. This seems implausible, and the 'parcellization' framework is generally preferred – where existing organization of organ systems is 'formalized' from loosely defined packets into more rigid segments. As such, organisms with a loosely defined metamerism, whether internal (as some molluscs) or external (as onychophora), can be seen as 'precursors' to eusegmented organisms such as annelids or arthropods.\n\n"}
{"id": "1047465", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1047465", "title": "Spiritual ecology", "text": "Spiritual ecology\n\nSpiritual ecology is an emerging field in religion, conservation, and academia recognizing that there is a spiritual facet to all issues related to conservation, environmentalism, and earth stewardship. Proponents of Spiritual Ecology assert a need for contemporary conservation work to include spiritual elements and for contemporary religion and spirituality to include awareness of and engagement in ecological issues.\n\nContributors in the field of Spiritual Ecology contend there are spiritual elements at the root of environmental issues. Those working in the arena of Spiritual Ecology further suggest that there is a critical need to recognize and address the spiritual dynamics at the root of environmental degradation.\n\nThe field is largely emerging through three individual streams of formal study and activity: science and academia, religion and spirituality, and ecological sustainability.\n\nDespite the disparate arenas of study and practice, the principles of spiritual ecology are simple: In order to resolve such environmental issues as depletion of species, global warming, and over-consumption, humanity must examine and reassess our underlying attitudes and beliefs about the earth, and our spiritual responsibilities toward the planet. U.S. Advisor on climate change, James Gustave Speth, said: \"I used to think that top environmental problems were biodiversity loss, ecosystem collapse and climate change. I thought that thirty years of good science could address these problems. I was wrong. The top environmental problems are selfishness, greed and apathy, and to deal with these we need a cultural and spiritual transformation.\"\n\nThus, it is argued, ecological renewal and sustainability necessarily depends upon spiritual awareness and an attitude of responsibility. Spiritual Ecologists concur that this includes both the recognition of creation as sacred and behaviors that honor that sacredness.\n\nRecent written and spoken contributions of Pope Francis, particularly his May 2015 Encyclical, Laudato si', as well as unprecedented involvement of faith leaders at the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris reflect a growing popularity of this emerging view. The UN secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, stated on December 4, 2015, that “Faith communities are vital for global efforts to address the climate challenge. They remind us of the moral dimensions of climate change, and of our obligation to care for both the Earth’s fragile environment and our neighbours in need.” \n\nSpiritual ecology identifies the Scientific Revolution—beginning the 16th century, and continuing through the Age of Enlightenment to the Industrial Revolution—as contributing to a critical shift in human understanding with reverberating effects on the environment. The radical expansion of collective consciousness into the era of rational science included a collective change from experiencing nature as a living, spiritual presence to a utilitarian means to an end.\n\nDuring the modern age, reason became valued over faith, tradition, and revelation. Industrialized society replaced agricultural societies and the old ways of relating to seasons and cycles. Furthermore, it is argued that the growing predominance of a global, mechanized worldview, a collective sense of the sacred was severed and replaced with an insatiable drive for scientific progress and material prosperity without any sense of limits or responsibility.\n\nSome in Spiritual Ecology argue that a pervasive patriarchal world-view, and a monotheistic religious orientation towards a transcendent divinity, is largely responsible for destructive attitudes about the earth, body, and the sacred nature of creation. Thus, many identify the wisdom of indigenous cultures, for whom the physical world is still regarded as sacred, as holding a key to our current ecological predicament.\n\nSpiritual ecology is a response to the values and socio-political structures of recent centuries with their trajectory away from intimacy with the earth and its sacred essence. It has been forming and developing as an intellectual and practice-oriented discipline for nearly a century.\n\nSpiritual ecology includes a vast array of people and practices that intertwine spiritual and environmental experience and understanding. Additionally, within the tradition itself resides a deep, developing spiritual vision of a collective human/earth/divine evolution that is expanding consciousness beyond the dualities of human/earth, heaven/earth, mind/body. This belongs to the contemporary movement that recognizes the unity and interrelationship, or \"interbeing,\" the interconnectedness of all of creation.\n\nVisionaries carrying this thread include Rudolf Steiner (1861-1925) who founded the spiritual movement of anthroposophy, and described a \"co-evolution of spirituality and nature\" and Pierre Teilhard de Chardin, a French Jesuit and paleontologist (1881-1955) who spoke of a transition in collective awareness toward a consciousness of the divinity within every particle of life, even the most dense mineral. This shift includes the necessary dissolution of divisions between fields of study as mentioned above. \"Science, philosophy and religion are bound to converge as they draw nearer to the whole.\"\n\nThomas Berry, the American Passionist priest known a 'geologian' (1914-2009), has been one of the most influential figures in this developing movement, with his stress on returning to a sense of wonder and reverence for the natural world. He shared and furthered many of Teilhard de Chardin’s views, including the understanding that humanity is not at the center of the universe, but integrated into a divine whole with its own evolutionary path. This view compels a re-thinking of the earth/human relationship: \"The present urgency is to begin thinking within the context of the whole planet, the integral earth community with all its human and other-than-human components.\"\n\nMore recently, leaders in the Engaged Buddhism movement, including Thich Nhat Hanh, also identify a need to return to a sense of self which includes the Earth. Joanna Macy describes a collective shift – referred to as the \"Great Turning\" – taking us into a new consciousness in which the earth is not experienced as separate. Sufi teacher Llewellyn Vaughan-Lee similarly grounds his spiritual ecology work in the context of a collective evolutionary expansion towards oneness, bringing us all toward an experience of earth and humanity – all life – as interdependent. In the vision and experience of oneness, the term \"spiritual ecology\" becomes, itself, redundant. What is earth-sustaining is spiritual; that which is spiritual honors a sacred earth.\n\nAn important element in the work of these contemporary teachers is the call for humanity’s full acceptance of responsibility for what we have done – physically and spiritually – to the earth. Only through accepting responsibility will healing and transformation occur.\n\nIncluding the need for a spiritual response to the environmental crisis, Charles, Prince of Wales in his 2010 book \"\", writes: \"A specifically mechanistic science has only recently assumed a position of such authority in the world... (and) not only has it prevented us from considering the world philosophically any more, our predominantly mechanistic way of looking at the world has also excluded our spiritual relationship with Nature. Any such concerns get short shrift in the mainstream debate about what we do to the Earth.\" Prince Charles, who has promoted environmental awareness since the 1980s, continues: \"... by continuing to deny ourselves this profound, ancient, intimate relationship with Nature, I fear we are compounding our subconscious sense of alienation and disintegration, which is mirrored in the fragmentation and disruption of harmony we are bringing about in the world around us. At the moment we are disrupting the teeming diversity of life and the ‘ecosystems’ that sustain it—the forests and prairies, the woodland, moorland and fens, the oceans, rivers and streams. And this all adds up to the degree of ‘disease’ we are causing to the intricate balance that regulates the planet’s climate, on which we so intimately depend.\"\n\nIn May 2015 Pope Francis’s Encyclical, “Laudato Si’: On Care for our Common Home,” endorsed the need for a spiritual and moral response to our environmental crisis, and thus implicitly brings the subject of spiritual ecology to the forefront of our present ecological debate. This encyclical recognizes that “The ecological crisis is essentially a spiritual problem,” in line with the ideas of this developing field. American environmentalist, author, and journalist Bill McKibben who has written extensively on the impact of global warming, says that Pope Francis has \"brought the full weight of the spiritual order to bear on the global threat posed by climate change, and in so doing joined its power with the scientific order.\"\n\nScientist, environmentalist, and a leader in sustainable ecology David Suzuki also expresses the importance of including the sacred in addressing the ecological crisis: \"The way we see the world shapes the way we treat it. If a mountain is a deity, not a pile of ore; if a river is one of the veins of the land, not potential irrigation water; if a forest is a sacred grove, not timber; if other species are biological kin, not resources; or if the planet is our mother, not an opportunity—then we will treat each other with greater respect. Thus is the challenge, to look at the world from a different perspective.\"\n\nHistorically we see the development of the foundational ideas and perspective of spiritual ecology in mystical arms of traditional religions and spiritual arms of environmental conservation. These ideas put forth a story of an evolving universe and potential human experience of wholeness in which dualities dissipate—dualities that have marked past eras and contributed to the destruction of the earth as \"other\" than spirit.\n\nA Catholic nun interviewed by Sarah MacFarland Taylor, author of the 2009 book, “Green Sisters: Spiritual Ecology” (Harvard University Press, 2009), articulates this perspective of unity: “There is no division between planting new fields and prayer.”\n\nMany in the field of spiritual ecology agree that a distinct stream of experience threading throughout history that has at its heart a lived understanding of the principles, values and attitudes of spiritual ecology: indigenous wisdom. The term \"indigenous\" in this context refers to that which is native, original, and resident to a place, more specifically to societies who share and preserve ways of knowing the world in relationship to the land. For many Native traditions, the earth \"is\" the central spiritual context. This principle condition reflects an attitude and way of being in the world that is rooted in land and embedded in place. Spiritual ecology directs us to look to revered holders of these traditions in order to understand the source of our current ecological and spiritual crisis and find guidance to move into a state of balance.\n\nFeatures of many indigenous teachings include life as a continual act of prayer and thanksgiving, knowledge and symbiotic relationship with an animate nature, and being aware of one’s actions on future generations. Such understanding necessarily implies a mutuality and reciprocity between people, earth and the cosmos.\n\nThe above historical trajectory is located predominantly in a Judeo-Christian European context, for it is within this context that humanity experienced the loss of the sacred nature of creation, with its devastating consequences. For example, with colonization, indigenous spiritual ecology was historically replaced by an imposed Western belief that land and the environment are commodities to be used and exploited, with exploitation of natural resources in the name of socio-economic evolution. This perspective \"... tended to remove any spiritual value of the land, with regard only given for economic value, and this served to further distance communities from intimate relationships with their environments,\" often with \"devastating consequences for indigenous people and nature around the world.\" Research on early prehistoric human activity in the Quaternary extinction event, shows overhunting megafauna well before European colonization in North America, South America and Australia. While this might cast doubt upon the view of indigenous wisdom and the sacred relationship to land and environment throughout the entirety of human history, it this does not negate the more recent devastating effects as referenced.\n\nAlong with the basic principles and behaviors advocated by spiritual ecology, some indigenous traditions hold the same evolutionary view articulated by the Western spiritual teachers listed above. The understanding of humanity evolving toward a state of unity and harmony with the earth after a period of discord and suffering is described in a number of prophecies around the globe. These include the White Buffalo prophecy of the Plains Indians, the prophecy of the Eagle and Condor from the people of the Andes, and the Onondaga prophecies held and retold by Oren Lyons.\n\nSpiritual ecology is developing largely in three arenas identified above: Science and Academia, Religion and Spirituality, and Environmental Conservation.\n\nAmong scholars contributing to spiritual ecology, five stand out: Steven Clark Rockefeller, Mary Evelyn Tucker, John Grim, Bron Taylor and Roger S. Gottlieb.\n\nMary Evelyn Tucker and John Grim are the co-ordinators of Yale University’s Forum on Religion and Ecology, an international multi-religious project exploring religious world-views, texts ethics and practices in order to broaden understanding of the complex nature of current environmental concerns.\n\nSteven C. Rockefeller is an author of numerous books about religion and the environment, and is professor emeritus of religion at Middlebury College. He played a leading role in the drafting of the Earth Charter.\n\nRoger S. Gottlieb is a professor of Philosophy at Worcester Polytechnic Institute is author of over 100 articles and 16 books on environmentalism, religious life, contemporary spirituality, political philosophy, ethics, feminism, and the Holocaust.\n\nBron Taylor at the University of Florida coined the term \"Dark Green Religion\" to describe a set of beliefs and practices centered on the conviction that nature is sacred.\n\nOther leaders in the field include: Leslie E. Sponsel at the University of Hawai'i, Sarah McFarland Taylor at Northwestern University, Mitchell Thomashow at Antioch University New England and the Schumacher College Programs.\n\nWithin the field of science, spiritual ecology is emerging in arenas including Physics, Biology (see: Ursula Goodenough), Consciousness Studies (see: Brian Swimme; California Institute of Integral Studies), Systems Theory (see: David Loy; Nondual Science Institute), and Gaia Hypothesis, which was first articulated by James Lovelock and Lynn Margulis in the 1970s.\n\nAnother example is scientist and author Diana Beresford-Kroeger, world recognized expert on how trees chemically affect the environment, who brings together the fields of ethnobotany, horticulture, ecology, and spirituality in relation to the current ecological crisis and stewardship of the natural world. She says, \"... the world, the gift of this world is fantastic and phenomenal. The molecular working of the world is extraordinary, the mathematics of the world is extraordinary... sacred and science go together.\"\n\nWithin many faiths, environmentalism is becoming an area of study and advocacy. Pope Francis’s May 2015 encyclical, Laudato si', offered a strong confirmation of spiritual ecology and its principles from within the Catholic Church. Additionally, over 150 leaders from various faiths signed a letter to the UN Climate Summit in Paris 2015, “Statement of Faith and Spiritual Leaders on the upcoming United Nations Climate Change Conference, COP21 in Paris in December 2015”, recognizing the earth as “a gift” from God and calling for climate action. These contemporary events are reflections of enduring themes coming to the fore within many religions.\n\nChristian environmentalists emphasize the ecological responsibilities of all Christians as stewards of God's earth, while contemporary Muslim religious ecology is inspired by Qur'anic themes, such as mankind being \"khalifa\", or trustee of God on earth (2:30). There is also a Jewish ecological perspective based upon the Bible and Torah, for example the laws of \"bal tashchit\" (neither to destroy wantonly, nor waste resources unnecessarily). Engaged Buddhism applies Buddhist principles and teachings to social and environmental issues. A collection of Buddhist responses to global warming can be seen at Ecological Buddhism.\n\nIn addition to Pope Francis, other world traditions currently seem to include a subset of leaders committed to an ecological perspective. The \"Green Patriarch,\" Bartholomew 1, the Ecumenical Patriarch of the Eastern Orthodox Church, has worked since the late nineties to bring together scientists, environmentalists, religious leaders and policy makers to address the ecological crisis, and says protecting the planet is a \"sacred task and a common vocation… Global warming is a moral crisis and a moral challenge.” The Islamic Foundation For Ecology And Environmental Sciences (IFEES) were one of the sponsors of the International Islamic Climate Change Symposium held in Istanbul in August 2015, which resulted in \"Islamic Declaration on Global Climate Change\"—a declaration endorsed by religious leaders, noted Islamic scholars and teachers from 20 countries. In October, 2015, 425 rabbis signed \"A Rabbinic Letter on the Climate Crisis\", calling for vigorous action to prevent worsening climate disruption and to seek eco-social justice. Hindu scriptures also allude strongly and often to the connection between humans and nature, and these texts form the foundation of the Hindu Declaration on Climate Change, presented at a 2009 meeting of the Parliament of World Religions. Many world faith and religious leaders, such as the Dalai Lama, were present at the 2015 Climate Change Conference, and shared the view that: \"Saving the planet is not just a political duty, but also a moral one.\" The Karmapa, Ogyen Trinley Dorje, has also stated, \"The environmental emergency that we face is not just a scientific issue, nor is it just a political issue—it is also a moral issue.”\n\nThese religious approaches to ecology also have a growing interfaith expression, for example in The Interfaith Center for Sustainable Development (ICSD) where world religious leaders speak out on climate change and sustainability. And at their gathering in Fall 2015, the Parliament of World Religions created a declaration for Interfaith Action on Climate Change, and \"brought together more than 10,000 activists, professors, clergy, and global leaders from 73 countries and 50 faiths to confront climate change\"\n\nCare for and respect to earth as Sacred—as Mother Earth (Mother Nature)—who provides life and nourishment, is a central point to Earth-based spirituality. PaGaian Cosmology is a tradition within Earth-based spirituality that focuses particularly in Spiritual Ecology and celebrating the sacredness of life. Glenys Livingstone describes it in her book as \"an ecospirituality grounded in indigenous Western religious celebration of the Earth-Sun annual cycle. By linking to story of the unfolding universe this practice can be deepened. And a sense of the Triple Goddess—central to the cycle and known in ancient cultures—may be developed as a dynamic innate to all being. The ritual scripts and the process of ritual events presented here, may be a journey into self-knowledge through personal, communal and ecological story: the self to be known is one that is integral with place.\"\n\nWhile religiously-oriented environmentalism is grounded in scripture and theology, there is a more recent environmental movement that articulates the need for an ecological approach founded on spiritual awareness rather than religious belief. The individuals articulating this approach may have a religious background, but their ecological vision comes from their own lived spiritual experience. The difference between this spiritually-oriented ecology and a religious approach to ecology can be seen as analogous to how the Inter-spiritual Movement moves beyond interfaith and interreligious dialogue to focus on the actual experience of spiritual principles and practices. Spiritual ecology similarly explores the importance of this experiential spiritual dimension in relation to our present ecological crisis.\n\nThe Engaged Buddhist teacher Thich Nhat Hanh speaks of the importance of mindfulness in taking care of our Mother Earth, and how the highest form of prayer is real communion with the Earth. Sandra Ingerman offers shamanic healing as a way of reversing pollution in Medicine for the Earth. Franciscan monk Richard Rohr emphasizes the need to experience the whole world as a divine incarnation. Sufi mystic Llewellyn Vaughan-Lee directs our attention not just to the suffering of the physical world, but also its interior spiritual self, or anima mundi (world soul). Bill Plotkin and others are involved in the work of finding within nature the reconnection with our soul and the world soul. These are just a few of the many different ways practitioners of spiritual ecology within different spiritual traditions and disciplines bring our awareness back to the sacred nature of creation.\n\nThe environmental conservation field has been informed, shaped, and led by individuals who have had profound experiences of nature’s sacredness and have fought to protect it. Recognizing the intimacy of human soul and nature, many have pioneered a new way of thinking about and relating to the earth.\n\nToday many aspects of the environmental conservation movement are empowered by spiritual principles and interdisciplinary cooperation.\n\nRobin Wall Kimmerer, Professor of Environmental and Forest Biology at the State University of New York College of Environmental Science and Forestry, has recently founded the Center for Native Peoples and the Environment which bridges scientific based study of ecology and the environment with traditional ecological knowledge, which includes spirituality. As she writes in this piece from Oxford Journal BioScience: \"Traditional ecological knowledge is increasingly being sought by academics, agency scientists, and policymakers as a potential source of ideas for emerging models of ecosystem management, conservation biology, and ecological restoration. It has been recognized as complementary and equivalent to scientific knowledge... Traditional ecological knowledge is not unique to Native American culture but exists all over the world, independent of ethnicity. It is born of long intimacy and attentiveness to a homeland and can arise wherever people are materially and spiritually integrated with their landscape.\"\n\nIn recent years, the World Wildlife Fund (World Wide Fund for Nature) has developed Sacred Earth: Faiths for Conservation, a program to collaborate with spiritual leaders and faith communities from all different spiritual traditions around the world, to face environmental issues including deforestation, pollution, unsustainable extraction, melting glaciers and rising sea levels. The Sacred Earth program works with faith-based leaders and communities, who \"best articulate ethical and spiritual ideals around the sacred value of Earth and its diversity, and are committed to protecting it.\"\n\nOne of the conservation projects developed from the WWF Sacred Earth program is Khoryug, based in the Eastern Himalayas, which is an association of several Tibetan Buddhist monasteries that works on environmental protection of the Himalayan region through apply the values of compassion and interdependence towards the Earth and all living beings that dwell here. Organized under the auspices of His Holiness, the 17th Karmapa, Ogyen Trinley Dorje, the Khoryug project resulted in the publication of environmental guidelines for Buddhists and \"more than 55 monastery-led projects to address forest degradation, water loss, wildlife trade, waste, pollution and climate change.\"\n\nKrishna Kant Shukla, a physicist and musician, is noted for his lectures on \"Indian villages as models of sustainable development\" and his work in establishing Saha Astitva a model eco village and organic farm in tribal Maharashtra, India.\n\nOne trend to note is the recognition that women—by instinct and nature—have a unique commitment and capacity to protect the earth’s resources. We see this illustrated in the lives of Wangari Maathai, founder of Africa’s Green Belt Movement, which was initially made up of women planting trees; Jane Goodall, innovator of local sustainable programs in Africa, many of which are designed to empower girls and women; and Vandana Shiva, the Indian feminist activist working on a variety of issues including seed saving, protecting small farms in India and protesting agri-business.\n\nOther contemporary inter-disciplinary environmentalists include Wendell Berry, a farmer, poet, and academic living in Kentucky, who fights for small farms and criticizes agri-business; and Satish Kumar, a former Jain monk and founder of Schumacher College, a center for ecological studies.\n\nAlthough the May 2015 Encyclical from Pope Francis brought the importance of the subject spiritual ecology to the fore of mainstream contemporary culture, it is a point of view that is not widely accepted or included in the work of most environmentalists and ecologists. Academic research on the subject has also generated some criticism.\n\nKen Wilber has criticized spiritual ecology, suggesting that “spiritually oriented deep ecologists” fail to acknowledge the transcendent aspect of the divine, or hierarchical cosmologies, and thus exclude an important aspect of spirituality, as well as presenting what Wilber calls a one-dimensional “flat land” ontology in which the sacred in nature is wholly immanent. But Wilber's views are also criticized as not including an in-depth understanding of indigenous spirituality.\n\n\n\n"}

A similar phenomenon can often be observed in kinked helical cables such as telephone handset cords. \n\nThe phenomenon was known to Charles Darwin, who wrote in 1865,\n\nThe term \"tendril perversion\" was coined by Goriely and Tabor in 1998 based on the word \"perversion\" found in the 19th Century science literature. \"Perversion\" is a transition from one chirality to another and was known to James Clerk Maxwell, who attributed it to the topologist J. B. Listing. \n\nTendril perversion can be viewed as an example of spontaneous symmetry breaking, in which the strained structure of the tendril adopts a configuration of minimum energy while preserving zero overall twist. \n\nTendril perversion has been studied both experimentally and theoretically. Gerbode et al. have made experimental studies of the coiling of cucumber tendrils. A detailed study of a simple model of the physics of tendril perversion was made by MacMillen and Goriely in the early 2000s. Liu et al. showed in 2014 that \"the transition from a helical to a hemihelical shape, as well as the number of perversions, depends on the height to width ratio of the strip's cross-section.\"\n\nGeneralized tendril perversions were put forward by Silva et al., to include perversions that can be intrinsically produced in elastic filaments, leading to a multiplicity of geometries and dynamical properties.\n\n\n"}

It was launched in August 1962, a day after Vostok 3 with cosmonaut Pavel Popovich on board—the first time that more than one manned spacecraft were in orbit at the same time. The two Vostok capsules came within of one another and ship-to-ship radio contact was established.\n\nThe cosmonauts of Vostok 3 and 4 did not attempt rendezvous. At one point the craft came within a few kilometers of each other and Popovich later reported at a news conference that he saw the other craft from orbit. Popovich is quoted as saying, \"I saw it at once,\" referring to seeing Vostok 3 in orbit. \"It looked like a very small moon in the distance.\"\n\nThe Vostok 3 and 4 spacecraft landed about 200 km apart, south of Karaganda, Kazakhstan.\n\nThe mission went largely as planned, despite a malfunction with the Vostok's life-support systems that meant that cabin temperature dropped down to . The flight was terminated early after a misunderstanding by ground control, who believed that Popovich had given them a codeword asking to be brought back ahead of schedule.\n\nThe re-entry capsule is now on display at the NPO Zvezda Museum in Moscow, but it has been modified to represent the Voskhod 2 capsule.\n"}
