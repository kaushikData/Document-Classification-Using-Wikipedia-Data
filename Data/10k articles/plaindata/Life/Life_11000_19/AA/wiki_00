According to local police, 45 survivors were rescued. Officially, 251 people died in the accident.\n\nEarly on March 22, 2014, two boats carrying people from the Kyangwali Refugee Settlement refugee settlement left the Ugandan shore of Lake Albert en route to the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). On the way, one of the boats capsized. Its passengers had been returning home after United Nations and Congolese forces won major victories over the Allied Democratic Forces and M23 rebel groups in recent months. There was no evidence that the boat's passengers had left Uganda due to conditions at the refugee camp.\n\nReports indicated that the accident occurred due to overcrowding, a common cause of boating casualties in the region due to lax enforcement of safety rules. The boat's listed capacity was 80, but approximately 300 people were on board at the time of the accident. The lack of life vests and inability of most passengers to swim also contributed to the high death toll. Additionally, the boat was in poor condition mechanically.\n\nInitial efforts led to the rescue of 45 survivors and recovery of 19 bodies on March 22. Survivors were taken to the Bundibugyo District of Uganda, where they received care from the Ugandan government and the UN High Commissioner for Refugees. By March 24, 109 bodies were recovered. Of those, 88 were accepted for burial in DRC. The remainder were rejected due to cultural concerns over burying people more than 72 hours after death, and were buried at the Bundibugyo hospital cemetery. On March 27, the official death toll was revised to 251. Most of the dead were children. \n\nThe boat's skipper recalled counting 96 adults on board, but he did not count the children. Police said they believed nearly all passengers had been accounted for.\n\nIn a statement, the United Nations said it was \"shocked and saddened\" by the tragedy. Three days of national mourning were declared in DRC. The government also helped arrange funerals and offered support for the dead. On April 7, DRC announced plans to repatriate about 21,000 refugees living in Uganda. DRC envoy to Uganda Jean Okoto Lolakombe remarked \"It is sad that we lost our people, but we have learnt a lesson from the incident.\" There are 175,000 registered Congolese refugees living in Uganda as of March 2014.\n"}

He was born on 28 January 1794 in the parsonage house at Basildon, Berkshire, where his parents were temporarily residing. He was religiously educated, and in May 1808 entered the Royal Naval College, Portsmouth.\n\nOn 20 June 1810 he went to sea as a volunteer on board HMS \"Fortunee\". He next served on the HMS \"Phoebe\" as a midshipman during the War of 1812 until August 1814. He distinguished himself in the capture of the American frigate \"Essex\", and was sent to England as acting lieutenant of that prize. Being confirmed as lieutenant on 13 December, he served in the frigate HMS \"Ganymede\" in the Mediterranean Fleet, then in the \"Leander\", and the \"Dauntless\" in various parts of the world.\n\nHe returned invalided to Portsmouth on 31 October 1822.\n\nAs second lieutenant of the \"Jupiter\", Gardiner he was at Newfoundland in 1824, and in 1825 returned to England in charge of the \"Clinker.\" He was promoted to commander on 13 September 1826. After that, although he often applied for positions in the Royal Navy, he never succeeded in obtaining another appointment.\n\nOn 1 July 1823, Gardiner married Julia Susanna, second daughter of John Reade and his wife of Ipsden House, Ipsden, Oxfordshire. They had several children together including one son, Allen W. Gardiner. Not all his daughters survived to adulthood. Julia Gardiner died in the Isle of Wight on 23 May 1834.\n\nAbout two years later, Gardiner married secondly, 7 October 1836, Elizabeth Lydia, eldest daughter of the Rev. Edward Garrard Marsh, vicar of Aylesford, Kent.\n\nLong interested in the missionary work being done in non-Christian populations, after the death of one of his daughters, he decided to enter that field. With this view Gardiner went to Africa in 1834. Exploring the Zulu country, he started the first missionary station at Port Natal in present-day South Africa. From 1834 to 1838, he worked to plant Christian churches in Zululand, but political events and native wars combined to prevent any permanent success. \nHe founded a mission at Hambanathi on near the Tongaat river. The took the name Hambanathi, which means \"come with us\" in the Zulu language from .\n\nFrom 1838 to 1843, Gardiner laboured among the indigenous peoples of Chile, and went from island to island in the Indian Archipelago (now called Tierra del Fuego). His efforts were foiled by the opposition of the various governments.\n\nGardiner's first visit to Tierra del Fuego took place 22 March 1842, when, coming from the Falkland Islands in the schooner \"Montgomery,\" he landed in Oazy harbour. He appealed to the Church Missionary Society to send missionaries to Patagonia, but was declined for lack of funds to support such a distant endeavour. Similarly, he appealed to the Wesleyan and London Missionary societies.\n\nIn 1844 a special society was formed for South America, which took the name of the Patagonian Missionary Society. Robert Hunt, a schoolmaster, was sent out as the first missionary and accompanied by Gardiner. They were unable to establish a mission and returned to England in June 1845. Gardiner departed England again 23 September 1845, and, in company with Federico Gonzales, a Spanish Protestant, from whom he learnt Spanish, went to Bolivia. They distributed bibles to the Indian population, but were strongly opposed by the Roman Catholics, who were the predominant Christian group in the country.\n\nHe established Gonzales as a missionary at Potosi, and returned to England, landing at Southampton 8 February 1847. The next year he sailed to Tierra del Fuego, where he surveyed the islands with a view to a mission, and suffered great hardships. He tried to interest the Moravian Brethren and the Foreign Missions of the Church of Scotland in this enterprise, but neither could render any aid. He proposed that a mission should be established on a substantial ship, rather than trying to set up one on land. At last, a lady at Cheltenham having given £700, the mission was determined on.\n\nAccompanied by Richard Williams, surgeon; Joseph Erwin, ship-carpenter; John Maidment, catechist; and three Cornish fishermen, Pearce, Badcock, and Bryant, Gardiner sailed from Liverpool 7 September 1850 in the \"Ocean Queen.\" The party landed at Picton Island 5 December. He had with him two launches, each twenty-six feet long, in which had been stowed provisions to last for six months. The Yahgan people were hostile, the climate severe, and the country barren. The party were also hindered by failures such as the devastating realisation that they had left nearly all their shot on the ship, leaving them unable to hunt for fresh food. Six months elapsed without the arrival of additional supplies, which were detained at the Falkland Islands for want of a vessel. After relocating to Spaniard Harbour on the south east coast of the main island, the unfortunate men gradually died of starvation. Gardiner, the last survivor, is believed to have died 6 September 1851.\n\nOn 21 October the \"John Davison\" arrived to resupply the group, and found all the men dead. On 6 January 1852 \"\" visited the place, but all the sailors could do was to bury the bodies and bring away Gardiner's journal. Two years later in 1854, the \"Allen Gardiner\", an 88-ton schooner named for him, was sent out to Patagonia as a British missionary ship. In 1856 Allen W. Gardiner, the captain's only son, went to that country as a missionary.\n\nAn islet in the Chilean group of islands which includes Picton island remains named after Gardiner. However, the street in Durban named in his honour, was later renamed Dorothy Nyembe Street, to honor a South African activist and as part of the city's renaming process.\n\nHis works include:\n\n\n\n\n"}

Her mother was the youngest daughter of Queen Eleanor of Navarre, and Gaston IV, Count of Foix. Anne grew up at the French royal court in Blois. She was educated in Latin and the Classics. \n\nThe nephew of the French monarch, the Duke of Longueville, is reported to have been in love with her and wished to marry her, but he was prevented because a political marriage was planned for Anne. The elderly, twice-divorced and childless king Vladislaus II of Hungary of the Jagiellon dynasty had been searching a wife capable of giving him a son. His sights were set on a powerful alliance, and Anne, closely related to French royalty, was a good choice. So Anne got engaged in 1500, the marriage contract confirmed in 1501, and she wed Vladislaus by proxy at the French court in Blois in 1502. On her way to Hungary, she was much celebrated in Italy and in Venice, causing a conflict between France and Hungary over who should pay the expenses. On 29 September 1502, Anne wed Vladislaus in Székesfehérvár and she was crowned Queen of Hungary there that same day.\n\nAnne brought a French court and French advisors with her to Hungary. The relationship was happy at least from the king's view, and he is reported to have regarded her as a friend, assistant and a trusted advisor. She incurred debts in Venice and was said to favour this city all her life. In 1506, her signature was placed on a document alongside the king's regarding an alliance with the Habsburgs. On July 23, 1503 Anne gave birth to a daughter, known as Anna Jagellonica, and on July 1, 1506 to the long-awaited male heir, the future king Louis II.

The film stars Jeff Bridges, Cynthia Erivo, Dakota Johnson, Jon Hamm, Cailee Spaeny, Lewis Pullman, Nick Offerman and Chris Hemsworth. Set in 1969, the plot follows seven strangers each hiding dark secrets, who come to a head one night in a shady hotel on the California-Nevada border.\n\n\"Bad Times at the El Royale\" premiered at Fantastic Fest on September 27, 2018, and was theatrically released in the United States on October 12, 2018. The film has grossed over $31 million worldwide and received generally positive reviews from critics, with praise for its acting and Goddard's screenplay and direction, although some reviewers criticized the 141-minute runtime and pacing.\n\nIn 1969, Catholic priest Daniel Flynn, singer Darlene Sweet, salesman Laramie Seymour Sullivan, and sarcastic Emily Summerspring arrive at the El Royale, where they meet the hotel's only employee, Miles Miller.\n\nUpon checking into the honeymoon suite, Sullivan (in reality an FBI agent named Dwight Broadbeck, sent to investigate the hotel and remove evidence of their operations) discovers a passageway leading into a corridor looking onto one-way mirrors in each of the hotel's rooms, as well as a 16mm camera setup. Broadbeck witnesses an apparent kidnapping in progress in Emily's room; he is instructed to not to interfere with the kidnapping, and to sabotage the guests' vehicles to prevent any of them from escaping. Meanwhile, Flynn invites Sweet to join him for dinner. She sees him drugging her drink and knocks him unconscious with a bottle, running out of the hotel to escape. Miles finds Flynn and reveals to him the secret passageway, afterwards explaining that \"management\" has instructed him to film the guests and send the footage to them. However, he chose to hold back one particularly incriminating film reel of a recently deceased public figure.\n\nAgainst orders, Broadbeck attempts to rescue Emily's hostage, who is revealed to be her younger sister, Rose. Emily opens fire on Broadbeck, killing him and accidentally injuring Miles who was watching from behind the mirror. Sweet attempts to escape in her car after witnessing the murder, but Flynn arrives. He reveals that he is really a criminal named Donald O'Kelly, who was imprisoned after a botched robbery ten years earlier. Recently freed on parole, O'Kelly has returned to the El Royale in priest garb to retrieve the money which his brother Felix had hidden there before being killed in a double cross ten years earlier - but owing to his failing memory he can't recall which room it was in. He had attempted to drug Sweet to gain access to her room, believing the cash to be buried there. The two agree to split the cash amongst themselves.\n\nIn the lobby, Emily and Rose, having discovered the corridor, interrogate Miles about the surveillance operation. It is revealed that Emily has forcibly removed her sister from a cult led by Billy Lee, a charismatic and sadistic figure responsible for a string of murders in Malibu. However, Rose reveals that she has already called Billy about their location. As O'Kelly and Sweet attempt to leave with the money, Billy Lee and his cultists arrive and hold them hostage along with Emily and Miles.\n\nWhile interrogating and terrorizing the group, Lee learns of the money and the film, which he realizes is worth much more than the money. In a sadistic game of roulette, Lee kills Emily. Using a brief power outage to his advantage, O'Kelly attacks Lee as the hotel lounge catches fire. During the chaos, Miles reveals that he served as a sniper in Vietnam who killed 123 people. At Sweet's insistence, he picks up a gun and kills Lee and the other cultists. A distraught Rose stabs Miles, but is shot by O'Kelly afterwards. Before Miles passes, Sweet tells O'Kelly to absolve him of his guilt over his actions in Vietnam, which he does. O'Kelly and Sweet retrieve the money and Sweet tosses the film into the fire before the pair flee the hotel.\n\nNot long after, Sweet performs at a show in Reno for the crowd, as O'Kelly proudly looks on.\n\n\nOn March 8, 2017, it was announced that 20th Century Fox had bought the spec script \"Bad Times at the El Royale\", written by Drew Goddard, who would also direct and produce the film. On August 23, 2017, Chris Hemsworth and Jeff Bridges were cast in the 1960s-set film, to play two among the several characters who collide at the El Royale hotel, near California's Lake Tahoe. That same day, it was also reported that Tom Holland had passed on a role, and that Beyoncé was being courted for the role of an African-American vocalist. It was also revealed that main roles in the ensemble would include a vacuum cleaner salesman, two female criminals, a male cult leader, and a desk clerk. Later in August 2017, newcomer Cailee Spaeny was added to the cast to play an impressionable Southern girl brought to the hotel, while Cynthia Erivo was cast as the African-American singer who finds herself in the wrong place at the wrong time. In January 2018, Dakota Johnson and Russell Crowe joined the cast. In February 2018, Jon Hamm, Nick Offerman, and Mark O'Brien joined the cast, and in May 2018, Lewis Pullman was also confirmed for a role.\n\nPrincipal photography on the film began on January 29, 2018 in Vancouver, British Columbia. In February, it was being shot in Burnaby.\nThe El Royale is quite similar in appearance and characteristics to a closed former hotel-casino called the Cal Neva Lodge & Casino.\n\nThe first trailer was released on June 7, 2018. The film had its world premiere at Fantastic Fest on September 27, 2018 and also screened at the San Sebastián International Film Festival. It was theatrically released in the United States on October 12, 2018.\n\nThe film will get a digital release on December 18, 2018, followed by a 4K Ultra HD, Blu-ray, and DVD release on January 1, 2019.\n\n, \"Bad Times at the El Royale\" has grossed $17.8 million in the United States and Canada, and $13.5 million in other territories, for a total worldwide gross of $31.4 million, against a production budget of $32 million.\n\nIn the United States and Canada, \"Bad Times at the El Royale\" was released alongside \"First Man\" and \"\", and was projected to gross $8–12 million from 2,808 theaters in its opening weekend, with some predictions going as high as $17 million. The film made $2.8 million on its first day and went on to debut to $7.2 million, finishing seventh at the box office. \"Deadline Hollywood\" speculates the film was hurt by its 141-minute runtime, as well as its niche genre and lack of awards buzz. The film dropped 52% in its second weekend to $3.4 million, finishing ninth.\n\nOn review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 73% based on 207 reviews, with an average rating of 6.5/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \"Smart, stylish, and packed with solid performances, \"Bad Times at the El Royale\" delivers pure popcorn fun with the salty tang of social subtext.\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 60 out of 100, based on 43 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".

{"id": "10388309", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10388309", "title": "BamHI", "text": "BamHI\n\n\"Bam\"H I (from \"Bacillus amyloliquefaciens\") is a type II restriction endonuclease, having the capacity for recognizing short sequences (6 b.p.) of DNA and specifically cleaving them at a target site. This exhibit focuses on the structure-function relations of \"Bam\"H I as described by Newman, et al. (1995). \"Bam\"H I binds at the recognition sequence 5'-GGATCC-3', and cleaves these sequences just after the 5'-guanine on each strand. This cleavage results in sticky ends which are 4 b.p. long. In its unbound form, \"Bam\"H I displays a central b sheet, which resides in between α-helices. \"Bam\"H I is an extraordinarily unique molecule in that it undergoes a series of unconventional conformational changes upon DNA recognition. This allows the DNA to maintain its normal B-DNA conformation without distorting to facilitate enzyme binding. \"Bam\"H I is a symmetric dimer. DNA is bound in a large cleft that is formed between dimers; the enzyme binds in a \"crossover\" manner. Each \"Bam\"H I subunit makes the majority of its backbone contacts with the phosphates of a DNA half site but base pair contacts are made between each \"Bam\"H I subunit and nitrogenous bases in the major groove of the opposite DNA half site. The protein binds the bases through either direct hydrogen bonds or water-mediated H-bonds between the protein and every H-bond donor/acceptor group in the major groove. Major groove contacts are formed by atoms residing on the amino-terminus of a parallel 4 helix bundle. This bundle marks the \"Bam\"H I dimer interface, and it is thought that the dipole moments of the NH2-terminal atoms on this bundle may contribute to electrostatic stabilization.\n\nThe \"Bam\"H I enzyme is capable of making a large number of contacts with DNA. Water-mediated hydrogen bonding, as well as both main-chain and side-chain interactions aid in binding of the \"Bam\"H I recognition sequence. In the major groove, the majority of enzyme/DNA contacts take place at the amino terminus of the parallel-4-helix bundle, made up of a4 and a6 from each subunit. Although a6 from each subunit does not enter the DNA major groove, its preceding loops interact with the outer ends of the recognition site. Conversely, a4 from each subunit does enter the major groove in the center of the recognition sequence. A total of 18 bonds are formed between the enzyme and DNA across the 6 base pair recognition sequence (12 direct and 6 water mediated bonds). Arg155 and Asp154 located in a spiral ring before a6 are connected with G:C base pairs outside while the middle G:C pairs are connected with Asp154, Arg122, and Asn116 (direct binding). Hydrogen bonding between water and Asn116 results in binding at A:T base pairs inside (water-mediated binding). As discussed above, the L and R subunits bind in a cross over manner, whereby the R-subunit of \"Bam\"H I contacts the left DNA half-site of the recognition sequence. The binding of each \"Bam\"H I subunit is precisely the same as its symmetrical partner. The recognition site for \"Bam\"H I has a palindromic sequence which can be cut in half for ease in showing bonds.\n\nAs of the end of 2010, there were 5 crystal structures of \"Bam\"H I in the Protein Data Bank\n\nBamHI, type II restriction endonucleases, often requires divalent metals as cofactors to catalyze DNA cleavage. Two-metal ion mechanism is one of the possible catalytic mechanisms of BamHI since the BamHI crystal structure has the ability to bind two metal ions at the active site, which is suitable for the classical two-metal ion mechanism to proceed. Two-metal ion mechanism is the use of two metal ions to catalyze the cleavage reaction of restriction enzyme. BamHI has three critical active site residues that are important for metal catalyst. They are known as Asp94, Glu111 and Glu113. These residues are usually acidic. In the presence of a metal ion, the residues are pointed toward the metal ion. In the absence of metal ions, the residues are pointed outward. The two metal ions (A and B) are 4.1 apart from each other in the active site and are in-line with these residues. In general, when the two metal ions (A and B) are bonded to the active site, they help stabilize a cluster distribution of negative charges localized at the active site created by the leaving of an oxygen atom during the transition state. First, a water molecule will be activated by metal ion A at the active site. This water molecule will act as the attacking molecule attacking the BamHI-DNA complex and thus making the complex negative. Later, another water will bound to metal ion B and donate a proton to the leaving group of complex, stabilizing the build-up of negative charge on the leaving oxygen atom.\n\nThe function of Ca2+ in the active site of BamHI is known. It is an inhibitor of DNA cleavage, converting BamHI into the pre-reactive state. This revealed the water molecular is the attacking molecule. It donates a proton to the leaving group that is bounded to Ca2+ forming a 90o O-P-O bond angles. If Glu 113 is replaced by lysine, the cleavage is lost since Glu 113 accepts the proton from the attacking water molecule.\n\nBecause of its ability to recognize specific DNA sequence and cleave by a nuclease, \"Bam\"H I carries various importances in understanding Type II restriction endonuclease, cloning DNA, and possibly treating certain DNA mutation-derived diseases through genetic therapy. NARP and MILS syndromes, for example, are mitochondrial diseases that can be caused by mutations in the mitochondrial DNA. Mitochondria can recover its functions after the excision of the mutant sequence through restriction endonuclease.\n\n"}

Gedi was murdered in 2007, though the precise circumstances of his death remain unclear. He was one of several prominent members of the station's leadership killed, including fellow acting media directors, Muktar Mohamed Hirabe and Hassan Osman Abdi. In 2007, he was the eighth journalist killed that year in Somalia.\n\nBashir Gedi served as the acting director for Radio Shabelle, an independent Somalian radio station that reports news while routinely highlighting government and military corruption. During Gedi's tenure, the government shut down Radio Shabelle, HornAfrik and IQK Koranic., and intimidated the station with violence, shooting at the building and rounding up 18 employees for questioning.\n\nAfter one week of hiding inside the building of Radio Shabelle because of threats, Bashir Gedi ventured home on October 19, 2007. It was then that he was killed by a group of young gunmen, reported to be between the ages of 14 and 20, who were armed with pistols.\n\nJournalists in Somalia, which has been in a state of anarchy since dictator Mohamed Siad Barre was overthrown in 1991, routinely face violence, arbitrary imprisonment and harassment. The danger has intensified since the Somali government, with Ethiopian military help, expelled Islamist militants from Mogadishu in 2007. Journalists not only face attacks from the government but also the insurgent forces angry with the critical reporting by Somalia's media. According to statistics kept by the Committee to Protect Journalists, 40 journalists have been killed or murdered in Somalia since 1992 and it is considered one of the most dangerous places in the world for journalists.\n\nAlthough Bashir Gedi knew he was under constant threat of being harmed or killed by those factions angry with his Radio Shabelle's reports, he continued to lead his station in their mission to disseminate news. His and his colleagues' subsequent murders have drawn worldwide attention to the problems faced by Somalian journalists.\n\nHuman Rights Watch called the development of independent and critical radio networks like Shabelle one of the most positive developments since Somalia slipped into anarchy.\n\nAccording to the Committee to Protect Journalists, \"Shabelle, considered one of the leading stations in Somalia, has been harassed, threatened, and attacked by both government security forces and insurgents because of its critical reporting of the ongoing violence in Mogadishu.\"\n\nReporters Without Borders said, \"The security situation in Mogadishu seems to be completely out of control. Abandoned by the Somali authorities and their international partners, journalists have become key targets who are easily accessible. One after another, the country's leading media owners are being eliminated. By taking no action in this climate of total impunity, those who could be in a position to stop these murders will end up becoming accomplices.\" It criticized the state of total impunity whereby no suspects are ever brought to trial or convicted.\n\nThe Somali press freedom group, the National Union of Somali Journalists (NUSOJ), has proclaimed the murder to be politically motivated. Omar Faruk Osman, who is the secretary-general NUSOJ, said, \"It is totally intolerable and sends a clear message to each media person that his or her life is at risk because of his or her media activity.

It is often confused with congenital achromatopsia but underlying physiological deficits of the disorders are completely distinct. A similar, but distinct, deficit called color agnosia exists in which a person has intact color perception (as measured by a matching task) but has deficits in color recognition, such as knowing which color they are looking at.\n\nPatients with cerebral achromatopsia deny having any experience of color when asked and fail standard clinical assessments like the Farnsworth-Munsell 100-hue test (a test of color ordering with no naming requirements). Patients may often not notice their loss of color vision and merely describe the world they see as being \"drab\". Most describe seeing the world in \"shades of gray\". This observation notes a key difference between cerebral and congenital achromatopsia, as those born with achromatopsia have never had an experience of color or gray.\n\nCerebral achromatopsia differs from other forms of color blindness in subtle but important ways. It is a consequence of cortical damage that arises through ischemia or infarction of a specific area in the ventral occipitotemporal cortex of humans. This damage is almost always the result of injury or illness.\n\nA 2005 study examined 92 case studies since 1970 in which cerebral lesions affected color vision. The severity and size of the visual field affected in cerebral achromatopsiacs vary from patient to patient.\n\nThe majority of cases in the 2005 study were the result of bilateral lesions in the ventral occipital cortex. It is unknown whether this was the result of bilateral lesions being more likely to produce color-loss symptoms, or if it was a sampling effect of patients with more severe brain trauma more often being admitted for treatment. In many of the cases examined, patients reported only partial loss of color vision. The locations of color vision loss can be restricted to one hemisphere or one quarter of the visual field. The term \"hemiachromatopsia\" has been used to denote patients who experience loss of color in only one hemisphere of the visual field. However, as applied to achromatopia resulting from brain trauma, the term is incomplete in characterizing the often-complex nature of the vision loss.\n\nIn still rarer cases, temporary ischemia of the associated ventral occipital cortex can result in transient achromatopsia. The condition has thus far been characterized only in stroke patients and provides further support for a color processing area.\n\nIn one case, a 78-year-old stroke victim had lost the ability to identify color, but was unaware of his deficit until doctors performed color discretion tests.\nEven when presented with this information, the patient believed he had retained his ability to perceive color even though the world around him appeared grey. He attributed this achromatism to \"poor lighting\" and it took several weeks for the patient to fully appreciate the extent of his disability. In addition, the characteristic comorbidity of prosopagnosia was present. After two months and frequent sessions with doctors, tests indicated his color had fully returned. The ischemia caused by lesions on the posterior cerebral arteries had subsided and follow up MRI scans indicated that blood flow had once again returned to the VOC.\n\nThe most common disorder seen alongside cerebral achromatopsia is prosopagnosia, the inability to recognize or recall faces. In some studies, the comorbidity is seen as high as 72%. This significance has not been overlooked and is a subject of ongoing research. See below.\n\nCerebral achromatopsiacs often have poor spatial acuity.\n\nThe most common tests perform to diagnose cerebral achromatopsia are the Farnsworth-Munsell 100 hue test, the Ishihara plate test, and the color-naming test. Testing and diagnosis for cerebral achromatopsia is often incomplete and misdiagnosed in doctor’s offices.\n\nRemarkably, almost 50% of tested patients diagnosed with cerebral achromatopsia are able to perform normally on the color-naming test. However, these results are somewhat in question because of the sources from which many of these reports come. Only 29% of cerebral achromatopsia patients successfully pass the Ishihara plate test, which is a more accepted and more standardized test for color blindness.\n\nThe most apparent distinguishing characteristic between congenital achromatopsia and cerebral achromatopsia is the sudden onset of color vision loss following a severe head injury or damage to the occipital lobe following a stroke or similar ischemic event. Non-invasive imaging techniques can be the most helpful in determining whether the area of damage following a traumatic event is an correlated with color-vision processing. Simple diagnostic tools can also be used to determine whether a patient is a likely candidate for further testing, as advancing imaging procedures can often prove expensive and unnecessary.\n\nCo-morbid factors can be valuable indicators of the likelihood of cerebral achromatoptsia. One disorder often seen alongside cerebral achromatopsia is prosopagnosia, the inability to recall or recognize faces. The correlation is still the subject of ongoing research, but the most telltale clue in this association is the close proximity of brain lesions seen in prosopagnosics and cerebral achromatopsiacs without prosopagnosia. Figure 1 illustrates overlap of brain lesions compiled from numerous case reports of both disorders. A common area of damage associated with both disorders can be seen in the right occipital lobe.\n\nNo current treatment is known for the disorder.\n\nThe number of reported cases of cerebral achromatopsia are relatively few compared with other forms of color-vision loss. In addition, the severity of the color perception deficits along with other psychological effects vary between patients.\n\nBased on the knowledge gained from cerebral achromatopsia case studies, current research is focusing on learning more about the cortical area involved in color processing.\n\nA recent study provided some of the first direct evidence of color-specific processing in the ventral occipital cortex. A subject with a history of seizure activity was examined using fMRI and electrode implantation. Using the fMRI, researchers examined the areas of blood oxygenation in the occipital lobe as the subject viewed various color-specific stimuli. The result of the experiment was the identification of an area in the subject, slightly anterior to the lesioned area in cerebral achromatic patients, that responded to variance in color stimulation. The resolution of the MRI was a limiting factor in identifying areas corresponding to specific colors. The next portion of the study used an electrode implanted in the right hemisphere in the location identified by the fMRI scan as pertaining to color processing. It was found the electrical activity of the area increased when the subject was presented with blue stimuli. The next, and most significant finding of the study, was that when the electrode was used to present an electrical stimulus in the subject’s brain, the subject reported the perception of the color blue. Such a result is consistent with other reports of electrical stimulation in visual field maps eliciting perception of phosphines in subjects’ visual field.\n\nThe color stimulus presented is not the only factor in determining the involvement of the VOC in color processing. The amount of attention and the type of object also affect the activiation of the VOC. It has been noted that this area of the occipital lobe may not be a processing center but rather a pathway that is a critical intersection of several cortical areas involved in color perception.\n\nThe disorder is often presented as evidence of our incomplete knowledge of color processing. Color vision research is a well-studied field of modern neuroscience and the underlying anatomical processing in the retina have been well categorized. The presence of another factor in the perception of color by humans illustrates the need for more research.\n\nThe most famous instance of cerebral achromatopsia is that of \"Jonathan I.\" immortalized in a case study by Oliver Sacks and Robert Wasserman, and published as \"The Case of the Colorblind Painter\". The essay tracks Johnathan I.'s experience with cerebral achromatopsia from the point where an injury to his occipital lobe leaves him without the ability to perceive color, through his subsequent struggles to adapt to a black, white and gray world, and finally to his acceptance and even gratitude for his condition. Especially pertinent is the analysis of how cerebral achromatopsia affects his practice as a painter and artist. Descriptions of cerebral achromatopsia's effects on his psychological health and visual perception are especially striking. For instance, in recounting Mr. I.'s descriptions of flesh and foods, the authors write:\n\n"}

The peak of this social activism gave rise to a number of secret organisations, among them Land and Liberty, People's Revenge, and the Circle of Tchaikovsky.\n\nThe Circle was founded in St. Petersburg during student unrest in 1868-1869 as a group opposed to the reckless violence of Sergey Nechayev. It was named after Nikolai Tchaikovsky, one of its prominent members. A literary society for self-education within the Medical Surgical Academy was the heart of the organization, the initial purpose of which was to share books and knowledge that had been banned in the Russian Empire. It included students Mark Natanson, V. M. Aleksandrov, and Anatoly Serdyukov, who were joined by Nikolai Tchaikovsky and Feofan Lermontov. Besides self-education, the circle's main tasks were to unite students of Petersburg and other cities, and conduct propaganda among workers and peasants with the purpose of fomenting a social revolution. The Tchaikovsky set higher moral standards for their members in the face of Nechayev's unscrupulousness. They had a negative attitude towards struggle for political freedoms, which, in their view, were only advantageous to the arising Russian bourgeoisie. These principles were formulated in the \"Программа для кружков самообразования и практической деятельности\" (\"Program for the circles of self-education and practical activity\"), put together by the Tchaikovtsy in late 1870 – early 1871.\n\nOne of the first tasks of the Tchaikovtsy was to organize the printing, publishing, and distribution of scientific and revolutionary literature with the help of publishers Nikolai Polyakov, Kozma Soldatyonkov, and others. These literary works included the first volume of \"Das Kapital\" by Karl Marx, and books by others including Nikolai Chernyshevsky, Nikolai Dobrolyubov, Alexander Herzen, Pyotr Lavrov, Vasili Bervi, Ferdinand Lassalle, Charles Darwin, and John Stuart Mill. In the summer of 1871, the circle of Natanson merged with a female self-education circle of Alexandra Kornilova and Sophia Perovskaya. Soon, they were joined by Peter Kropotkin, Sergei Stepnyak-Kravchinsky, Dmitry Klements, Sergei Sinegub, Nikolai Charushin, Leonid Shishko, and others. The central Petersburg circle comprised around 60 people. Circles in Moscow (Nikolai Alexandrovich Morozov, Lev Tikhomirov, Mikhail Frolenko), Odessa (Felix Volkhovsky, Andrei Zhelyabov), Kiev (Yakov Stefanovich, Pavel Axelrod) and other cities sided with the Petersburg cell on a federal basis. Altogether, the Tchaikovtsy numbered around 100 participants.\n\nIn 1872, the Tchaikovtsy began organizing circles of workers with the purpose of training propagandists for work in the countryside. These activities were most successful in Petersburg and Odessa, where the circles comprised around 400 workers. Some of these workers—including Viktor Obnorsky and Feodor Kravchenko—would later become the founders of the first proletarian organizations such as the Worker's Union of Southern Russia (Южнороссийский союз рабочих) and Northern Union of the Russian Workers (Северный союз русских рабочих). The results of this propaganda work were summarized in a report by Peter Kropotkin, which would be discussed in the Petersburg circle of the Tchaikovtsy in late 1873.\n\nThe final stage of activities of the Tchaikovtsy included the Call to the People campaign, bringing revolutionary propaganda and organization directly to the peasants of Russia. In 1873/1874, most members of the circle were arrested and were later prosecuted in the trial of the 193. Tschaikovsky joined a religious-communist group and emigrated to the United States in 1874.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "49158642", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=49158642", "title": "Clinician Administered PTSD Scale", "text": "Clinician Administered PTSD Scale\n\nThe Clinically Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS) is an in-person clinical assessment for measuring posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The CAPS includes 30 items administered by a trained clinician to assess PTSD symptoms, including their frequency and severity. The CAPS distinguishes itself from other PTSD assessments in that it can also assess for current or past diagnoses of PTSD.\n\nThe CAPS was originally designed by the National Center for PTSD to assess PTSD. This measure was intended to be clinician-administered, and only administered by those clinicians with prior experience, training, and knowledge of PTSD. Previous measures of PTSD typically included introspective (subjective) self-report measures that the patient fills out without the help of a clinician. The clinically-administered PTSD scale was modeled after the Hamilton Depression Scale (HDRS), a clinician-administered scale to assess depressive features. It should be noted however that the HDRS has been subject to criticism.\n\nSome important features of the CAPS are:\n\nTable 1 – Versions of the CAPS by Diagnostic Statistical Manual version\nThe CAPS has developed over the years to keep up with changes in the widely used Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM). The DSM is currently in its fifth edition (DSM-5, May 2013) and serves as a guide to clinicians in diagnosing mental disorders. It should be noted, however, that the DSM system of psychiatric classifications is problematic in typecasting many relatively normal behavioral issues as \"abnormal\" (e.g., such as the over-classification of ADHD), promoting and entrenching archaic stereotypical psychiatric nosology, and in reifying subjective suppositions about psychopathology. Detailed critiques of the DSM system of psychiatric classifications have been published.\n\nCurrently, there are three versions of the CAPS-5 (Table 1). One version provides responses in the past month, one provides responses in the past week, and the last provides responses for the worst month (lifetime PTSD). There is also a version for children - the CAPS-CA-5 Table 1 also shows the development of the CAPS by DSM version.\n\nThe CAPS1 was intended to monitor changes over a one-month period, whereas the CAPS-2 was developed to monitor changes over a week period. The CAPS-1 and CAPS-2 were later changed to the CAPS-DX and CAPS-SX respectively to avoid confusion over future versions. The CAPS-5 has two versions – one that can assess for one-week changes and one that can assess for one-month changes. The one-week changes may be more helpful for treatment providers to see change in symptom scores over time, whereas the one-month changes may be more helpful to assess for baseline PTSD.\n\nThe CAPS has been revised to the CAPS-5 to reflect current changes in the DSM-5. The CAPS is currently the gold-standard assessment for PTSD and is used widely through the VA for compensation and pension determinations. As described in Table 1, there are three versions of the CAPS, one to monitor monthly changes (often used for diagnosis), one to monitor weekly changes (often for assessing for time changes) and worst month (to assess for lifetime PTSD).\n\nThe current CAPS-5 contains 30 questions relating to PTSD symptoms. Each question asks about both the frequency and the severity of each symptom. These questions are split into categories. Each criterion has several questions, and scores for each criterion are added up at the end. \n\nTo meet criteria for PTSD, a patient must have:\nBoth criterion F and G must be met as well for a PTSD diagnosis. To meet criteria for a symptom, a patient must meet criteria in both frequency and intensity score for each item. Frequency and intensity and then combined to form a single severity score. Severity scores range from 0-4, with 0 being absent to 4 being extreme/incapacitating.\n\nThe National Center for PTSD provides information for clinicians to learn how to administer and score the CAPS\".\" They recommend that, in addition to training, the CAPS be administered by clinicians familiar with PTSD.\n\nSample Question: \"In the past month, have you had any unwanted memories of (EVENT) while you were awake, so not counting dreams?\") \nThese frequency and intensity scores will get calculated together to create a severity score for each question. Total symptom severity is calculated by summing up all the individual item severity scores. For example, in the CAPS-IV scoring, to meet criteria for a symptom, the symptom must have an intensity score of 2 (on a scale or 0-4) or greater and a frequency score of 1 (on a scale of 0–4) or greater.\n\nTest-Retest Reliability: Although relatively high test-retest coefficients have been reported (Time 1 vs. Time 2), no information has been provided about the actual retest time interval. It is not possible to interpret test-retest reliability coefficients in the absence of knowing the retest time interval. Without provision of clear-cut information about the temporal stability of the CAPS-5 over varying intervals of time (e.g., 1 week, 2 weeks, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, 1 year, 5 years, etc.), administration of the CAPS-5 cannot be recommended for assessment of PTSD in clinical populations.\n\nValidity: The most recent version of the CAPS (CAPS-5) has demonstrated convergent validity with other measures of PTSD including the CAPS-IV and the PTSD Checklist. The CAPS-5 demonstrated discriminant validity with other measures, including measures of anxiety, substance abuse, and depression. It also has been translated into multiple languages, such as the Turkish and German that have also demonstrated validity.\n\n"}
{"id": "2907166", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2907166", "title": "Crasher (Gobots)", "text": "Crasher (Gobots)\n\nCrasher is the name of several fictional characters in the Gobots toyline, and the subsequent Challenge of the GoBots cartoon and the \"Transformers\" series. She was a regular character in the Gobots cartoon and star of the film \"Gobots: Battle of the Rock Lords\" voiced by Marilyn Lightstone. She is sometimes called \"Fracture\" for trademark purposes.\n\nThe female Crasher was one of Cy-Kill's most loyal Renegades, despite having a somewhat manic personality. One of her favoured pastimes is participating in demolition derbies. She is considered reckless. Under interrogation, she admitted to having a crush on Leader-1 before the Guardians and Renegades began their struggle. Unlike most Gobots, she rarely seems to use her hand-mounted blasters, instead using a trademark attack wherein she stamps her foot on the ground to create a powerful earthquake-style energy discharge that could track its victim in much the same manner as a heat-seeking missile. Crasher's seeming state of near-madness effectively renders her fearless, and she has an ongoing grudge with the Guardian Turbo, rarely avoiding a chance to battle him. However, she tends to take any defeat or challenge very personally.\n\nDespite her gender, unlike many 1980s female cartoon characters, Crasher is shown to be treated equally compared to her male counterparts, and is feared by most Guardians. Crasher enjoyed Gobot demolition derbies and at one time had a crush on Leader-1.\n\nAccording to Hasbro employees Crasher was the inspiration for the Decepticon Fracture.\n\nCrasher appears in almost every episode, usually as a featured character.\n\nIn the pilot Crasher and Cop-Tur aid Cy-Kill when he steals the astrobeam and escapes Gobotron to Earth.\n\nCy-Kill, Cop-Tur, Crasher, Geeper-Creeper, Pincher, and Snoop attack a lab, but it is defended by Leader-1, Baron Von Joy, Blaster, Dozer, Dumper, Road Ranger, Scooter, Scratch and Turbo. Although the Guardians were winning the battle, an accidental backfire from Baron Von Joy's weapon allows the Renegades to escape.\n\nCy-Kill, Cop-Tur, Crasher and Snoop attack Leader-1, Turbo, Scooter and Small Foot. Crasher wounds Small Foot. After attaining recordings of the Guardians the Renegades retreat. Using the recordings Cy-Kill has Herr Fiend program robot duplicates of the Guardians. When demonstrating Space Bender weapon to Unicom, Leader-1 learns that the Renegades ware attacking Washington. The Renegades ambush Leader-1 and replaced him with his duplicate. Leading the Command Center back to Gobotron and getting rid of Scooter and Small Foot the Renegades then release duplicates of Path Finder, Rest-Q, Van Guard and Turbo. Small Foot and Scooter are able to capture the Turbo duplicate and learn where their friends are being held. Cy-Kill then replaces Good Night. Using the duplicate Turbo the Guardians infiltrate the Renegade base, free the captured Guardians and escape from Spoons and Fitor. Although blocked by the Renegades, Scooter uses a hologram of Zod to make the Renegades flee. Making it back to Gobotron the Guardians are attacked by the Guardian duplicates. The real Guardians are able to defeat their duplicates with the aid of the real Zeemon, Hans-Cuff and Rest-Q. Cy-Kill then arrives in Thrustor with more duplicates, but Small Foot is able to stop with robots using the Space Bender, which fuses their robot brains.\n\nScooter and Small Foot join Nick and A.J. to watch a car stunt show which is attacked by Crasher, BuggyMan and Fly Trap. Small Foot fights Buggyman and defeats him, but the Renegades regain the upper hand until the Guardians are rescued by Leader-1 and Turbo who arrived in Power Suits. Cy-Kill vows to gain Power Suits for the Renegades. Scooter decides he needed more firepower, so he has Baron Von Joy remove his damaged holo projector in favor of a blaster unit. Screw Head, Bad Boy and Cop-Tur are sent to attack Unicom bases and distract the Guardians while Cy-Kill, Crasher and Scorp attempt to take the suits from the Guardian Command Center. Small Foot and Scooter are able to delay the Renegades until Leader-1 and Turbo return to chase away the Renegades. Realizing he is a better Guardian with his holo projector, Scooter has it reinstalled.\nCrasher was among the Renegade Gobot forces who aided the Rock Lord Magmar on the planet Cordax.\nCrasher appeared in the story \"Scooter's Mighty Magnet\" as one of Cy-Kill's minions.\n\nCrasher was featured in the 1986 children's book \"Collision Course Comet - Robo Machine Featuring The Challenge Of GoBots\". The illustrations of this book depict her in her white variant, not the black one used in the animated series.\n\nCrasher appeared in the 1984 Western Publishing Company story \"War of the GoBots\" by Robin Snyder.\n\nCrasher appeared in the 1985 Western Publishing Company story \"Race to the Stars\" by Jack Harris.\n\nCrasher was also featured in various Transformers fiction from Fun Publications, in both the \"Ask Vector Prime\" and \"Renegade Rhetoric\" Facebook series. Notably, she appeared in the \"Echoes and Fragments\" story that intermingled elements from GoBots into the plot of \"\"; in a nod to her two identities, Crasher was reformatted by Unicron into Fracture.\n\n\n\n\nThis version of Crasher is based off the \"Gobots\" character, despite being Cybertronian. She presumably has the same alternate mode.\n\nIn the second issue of \"\", Crasher is one of the background Transformers cheering Megatron's victory over Cy-Kill. However, she is drawn with a face similar to the toy, with a large red visor taking up much of her face.\n\nThough not part of the live-action \"Transformers\" film, Fracture is featured as part of the toy line and associated comics. Dedicated to Megatron and the Decepticon cause, Fracture is a dangerous enemy. She is totally fearless, and probably a little bit crazy, as she dives directly into any battle, regardless of the odds.\n\nAlthough she carries a powerful negative energy blaster, she prefers to use the seismic energy dischargers on her feet to smash the surrounding earth to pieces. Any battlefield on which she walks shudders with the force of her steps. In the IDW comics, Fracture was given a new design to fit in more with the movie's animation style, rather than one resembling her toy.\n\nHer appearance in the Titan Magazines series depicted her with her toys appearance, though with a different characterization. Notably being loyal to Stockade rather than Megatron, believing him to be the original reason the Great War began and thus Cybertron's destruction.\n\nNote: Stories from the alternate universe where Megatron won the battle for the Allspark are in \"italics\".\n\n\"Fracture appears in issue #17 of the Titan Transformers Magazine, in a story called \"Return to Cybertron: Part 1.\" She is part of the \"New Decepticons\" on Cybertron led by Stockade.\"\n\nFracture is among the Decepticons who arrive on Earth under the direction of Soundwave in \"\" #3. She arrives in Italy and assumed the form for a Formula One race car. In issue #4 Fracture is hunted down by Ironhide and human members of N.E.S.T., who chase her until Ironhide can run her off a cliff, killing her.\n\n\nA mirror-universe version of Crasher appeared in the \"Transformers: Timelines\" fiction. She is one of the heroic Decepticons. Crasher can cause quakes with her fists. She is a white racing vehicle. Her cousin is the evil Autobot Blurr.\n\nCrasher appears in the fiction \"Dungeons & Dinobots\", a text-based story from Fun Publications. She is part of the Mayhem Suppression Squad called in by Soundwave to defend the Arch-Ayr fuel dump from an Autobot attack. She later became part of the crew of the Nemesis.\n\nIn \"Do Over\" the Nemesis launches after the Ark. After a brief battle the Nemesis is shot down and crashes on Earth, with the crew escaping in stasis pods. Although not directly depicted, Crasher is a member of the crew of the Nemesis.\n\nCrasher appears in \"Eye In the Sky\" where Cliffjumper recovers her pod and reactivates her. Cliffjumper, Crasher, Frenzy, Heatwave, Ravage and Soundwave are sent on a mission to Burpleson Air Force Base to stop the Autobots from controlling the GODS defense system. Heatwave uses his powers to convince the GODS transmitter to fire the weapon on itself and stop the Autobots from taking control.\n\nThe Fracture name is used once again, this time for a male character from \"\" (the 2015 animated follow-up to the previous series \"\"). This version of Fracture is a bounty hunter who has a rivalry with the Autobot bounty hunter, Drift. He transforms into a purple motorcycle and is the only one that doesn't have an animal motif for his robot mode in the first season. He has two Mini-Con partners, Airazor and Divebomb, voiced by Roger Craig Smith and Khary Payton, respectively, who transform into missiles which launch from Fracture's shoulders. Like Drift, Fracture's Mini-Cons seemingly form part of his alternate mode as they are seen transforming with him.\n\nFracture debuted in the episode 12, entitled \"Hunting Season\". He traveled to Earth to collect the bounty the Cybertron High Council put on Bumblebee, but when Drift steps in to defend Bumblebee and his ship is hijacked by the Autobots, Fracture stayed on Earth and joined Steeljaw's gang. In his following appearances, he would join Steeljaw's pack in attempting to break out the Decepticons that the Autobots had already captured, only to fail repeatedly. In the first-season finale, Fracture attacks the Autobot base when only Fixit, Denny and Russel are there. The three prepare to fight Fracture and his Mini-Cons, only to find that a newly resurrected Optimus Prime has already defeated them. Despite not being an \"Alchemor\" prisoner, the defeated Fracture (and his Mini-Cons) was presumably placed in a stasis cell before Optimus when off to fight Megatronus.\n\nFracture appears as an unlockable character in the mobile game for \"\".\n\n\n\nAs with all \"Robots in Disguise\" figures, all Fracture toys have a scannable insignia on the right side of his front wheel. Scanning this with the \"Robots in Disguise\" mobile game temporarily unlocks Fracture as a playable character, if the player has not already permanently unlocked him.\n\n\n"}

It was designed to autonomously explore and map underwater sinkholes in northern Mexico, as well as collect water and wall core samples. The DEPTHX vehicle was the first of three vehicles to be built by Stone Aerospace which were funded by NASA with the goal of developing technology that can explore the oceans of Jupiter's moon Europa to look for extraterrestrial life.\n\nDEPTHX was a collaborative project for which Stone Aerospace was the principal investigator. Co-investigators included Carnegie Mellon University, which was responsible for the navigation and guidance software, the Southwest Research Institute, which built the vehicle's science payload, and research scientists from the University of Texas at Austin, the Colorado School of Mines, and NASA Ames Research Center.\n\nIn 1999, Bill Stone had been involved in an underwater surveying project in Wakulla Springs, Florida. For that project, Stone had devised a digital wall mapper that was propelled by a diver propulsion vehicle and steered by divers which was designed to create a 3-D map of Wakulla Springs using an array of sonars, as well as a suite of other sophisticated sensors. The success of this project, the Wakulla Springs 2 Project, attracted the interest of planetary scientist Dan Durda from the Southwest Research Institute, who wished to create a similar piece of technology to explore the oceans of Europa, but one that could drive itself autonomously. Stone accepted the challenge, and several collaborative proposals were submitted to NASA. It wasn't until 2003 that NASA would finally fund DEPTHX as a three-year, $5 million project.\n\nThe vehicle underwent several different design concepts over the next couple of years as engineers at Stone Aerospace explored various options. Initial designs focused on a less ellipsoidal design, however these designs were abandoned due to concerns that such a shape would be difficult to maneuver out of the potentially tight spots it might encounter during the exploration of unknown territory. It was also during this time that the DEPTHX team did a field campaign at Cenote Zacatón using a drop sonde to acquire some initial data for the software team, which itself contributed to the overall design changes. The final design was decided upon in 2006, at which point construction of the vehicle began.\n\nThe completed vehicle was about in diameter and weighed about . It had redundant navigation systems including 54 sonars, an inertial measurement unit, doppler velocity logger, as well as depth gauges and accelerometers. Propulsion systems were also redundant, having six thrusters and two equivalent battery stacks. It was outfitted with a variable buoyancy system, and finally with the science payload that included the ability to take in water and solid core samples for later analysis, as well as an onboard microscope to analyze water samples in real time.\n\nDuring the DEPTHX 2007 deployment, the vehicle was able to create 3-D maps of four cenotes in Sistema Zacatón in Tamaulipas, Mexico. This was the first autonomous system to explore and map a subterranean cavern. The mapping of Cenote Zacatón was particularly notable because its depth was previously unknown, as human divers had not been successful in attempts to reach the bottom. DEPTHX created the first map of the bottom of Zacatón, which has a depth of over . DEPTHX was the first robotic system of any kind to implement three-dimensional simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). It was also the first such system to make its own decisions on where and how to collect samples. From these samples, at least three new divisions of bacteria were discovered.\n\nThe success of the DEPTHX mission led to the funding of the follow-on project, ENDURANCE. The ENDURANCE vehicle reused the frame and a number of systems from the DEPTHX vehicle, but was considerably reconfigured for the needs of the Antarctic environment.\n\n\n\n"}

Parepa's aristocratic father died soon after her birth, and her mother turned to the stage to support them. Parepa made her operatic debut in 1855, at age 16, and soon earned enthusiastic reviews in the major London opera houses. In 1867, the widowed Parosa married the violinist and conductor Carl Rosa in New York and founded an opera company with Parepa as the leading lady; they toured successfully in America for several years. After their return to Britain with ambitious plans for their opera company, Parepa fell ill and died in 1874 at only 37 years of age.\n\nEuphrosyne Parepa was born in Edinburgh, Scotland, to the soprano Elisabeth Seguin (b. 1812, sister of basso Arthur Edward Seguin) and the Wallachian boyar Demetrius Parepa, Baron Georgiades de Boyescu of Bucharest. Her father died when Parepa was an infant, leaving her young mother impoverished. Parepa's mother turned to the stage to support her child and herself and trained the girl in singing.\n\nHer operatic début was in 1855 at the age of 16 in Malta as Amina in \"La Sonnambula\", followed by engagements in Italy, Spain and Portugal. She gave her first London performance at the Lyceum Theatre, in the role of Elvira in \"I Puritani\", with the Royal Italian Opera company, with whom she spent the 1857 season. The Royal Italian Opera company held their 1856–57 season at the Lyceum because the Royal Opera House was being remodeled after a fire. See Obituary: \"Madame Parepa Rosa\", \"The Times\", 23 January 1874, p. 10</ref> The critic of \"The Observer\" wrote of this introduction: \"Parepa possesses a soprano voice of excellent quality and remarkable compass. She acts and sings well. Her version of \"Son vergine vezzosa\" elicited applause terminating in a recall, and … [after the \"finale\"] she was again called for. … \"Qui la voce\" … was correctly and brilliantly executed; and the \"artiste\" was again summoned back to the stage to receive the homage of the audience.\"\n\nFrom 1859 to 1865, she appeared in opera at both Royal Opera House in Covent Garden and at Her Majesty's Theatre, becoming known for such roles as Leonora in \"Il trovatore\", Zerlina in \"Fra Diavolo\" and Elvira in \"La muette de Portici\". During this time, she participated in two operatic premieres, creating the title role in Alfred Mellon's \"Victorine\" in 1859 and the role of Mabel in George Alexander Macfarren's opera \"Helvellyn\" in 1864. She also was a successful oratorio and concert soloist, in constant demand in Britain and beyond. She sang with Charles Santley at the opening of the Oxford Music Hall in 1861, appeared before the Royal Philharmonic Society in Schumann's \"Paradise and the Peri\" and participated in the 19th-century English revival of the music of Handel, performing at the Handel festivals of 1862 and 1865, and in Germany.\n\nHer first husband, Army Captain H. de Wolfe Carvelle, died in Peru in 1865, sixteen months after their wedding. She travelled to the United States in 1865 with cornetist Levy and violinist Carl Rosa, the latter of whom she married in New York City in 1867. Together they quickly established the Parepa-Rosa English Opera Company there, featuring her as the leading soprano, which became popular, and which introduced opera to places in America that had never staged it before. They opened at the French Theatre on Fourteenth Street, New York City, in September 1869 with a performance of Balfe's opera \"The Puritan's Daughter\", with Parepa singing the title role. The subsequent tour of the eastern and midwestern states included a repertoire that ranged from \"The Bohemian Girl\" and \"Maritana\" to Weber's \"Der Freischütz\" and \"Oberon\".\n\nIn 1870, the Parepa-Rosa Opera Company returned to Britain and then appeared in Italian opera at Cairo, Egypt, followed by a return to America for another successful tour in 1871–72. In 1872, Parepa sang at the Lower Rhine Festival in Düsseldorf, and they then returned to London, where she sang Donna Anna in \"Don Giovanni\" and the title role in \"Norma\" at the Royal Opera House. In September 1873, the company changed its name to Carl Rosa's English Opera, since Parepa was pregnant.\n\nParepa died in London, after an illness, at the age of 37 while preparing to sing Elsa in an English version of Wagner's \"Lohengrin\" as part of her husband's planned season a Theatre Royal, Drury Lane; after her death, Rosa cancelled the season. She is buried at Highgate cemetery. After her death, Rosa endowed the Parepa-Rosa Scholarship at the Royal Academy of Music in her memory.\n\nWilliam Winter wrote that \"Great vocal powers have seldom found such ample or such touching expression as those of Parepa-Rosa did in the first act of \"Norma\". … [O]ne of her best successes was made as Rosina in \"The Barber of Seville\" ... to indicate the versatility of her talents and the scope and thoroughness of her culture.\" Her obituary in \"Illustrated London News\" stated: \"Her voice was a genuine soprano, of extensive compass and fine quality, while her highly-cultivated execution and her general musical knowledge gave her exceptional advantages, both mechanical and intellectual\".\n\nHer achievements were recognised by the Philharmonic Society of London (now the Royal Philharmonic Society) with the rare award of their Gold Medal in 1872.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "911396", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=911396", "title": "Force-feeding", "text": "Force-feeding\n\nForce-feeding is the practice of feeding a human or other animal against their will. The term \"gavage\" () refers to supplying a nutritional substance by means of a small plastic feeding tube passed through the nose (nasogastric) or mouth (orogastric) into the stomach. In hospitals, some psychiatric patients can be restrained so sedatives can be injected into them; this happens if patients have been non-compliant with their instructions.\n\nSoviet dissident Vladimir Bukovsky described how he was force-fed: \"The feeding pipe was thick, thicker than my nostril, and would not go in. Blood came gushing out of my nose and tears down my cheeks, but they kept pushing until the cartilages cracked. I guess I would have screamed if I could, but I could not with the pipe in my throat. I could breathe neither in nor out at first; I wheezed like a drowning man — my lungs felt ready to burst. The doctor also seemed ready to burst into tears, but she kept shoving the pipe farther and farther down. Only when it reached my stomach could I resume breathing, carefully. Then she poured some slop through a funnel into the pipe that would choke me if it came back up. They held me down for another half-hour so that the liquid was absorbed by my stomach and could not be vomited back, and then began to pull the pipe out bit by bit.\"\n\n\"The unfortunate patients had their mouth clamped shut, had a rubber tube inserted into their mouth or nostril. They keep on pressing it down until it reaches your esophagus. A china funnel is attached to the other end of the tube and a cabbage-like mixture poured down the tube and through to the stomach. This was an unhealthy practice, as the food might have gone into their lungs and caused pneumonia.\"\n\nSome countries force-feed prisoners when they go on hunger strike. It has been prohibited since 1975 by the Declaration of Tokyo of the World Medical Association, provided that the prisoner is \"capable of forming an unimpaired and rational judgment\". The violation of this prohibition may be carried out in a manner that can be categorised as torture, as it may be extremely painful and result in severe bleeding and spreading of various diseases via the exchanged blood and mucus, especially when conducted with dirty equipment on a prison population. Large feeding pipes are traditionally used on hunger striking prisoners whereas thin pipes are preferred in hospitals.\n\nSuffragettes who had been imprisoned while campaigning for votes for women went on hunger strike and were force fed. (This lasted until the Prisoners (Temporary Discharge for Ill Health) Act of 1913, better known as the Cat and Mouse Act, whereby debilitated prisoners would be released, allowed to recover, and then re-arrested.) Rubber tubes were inserted through the mouth (only occasionally through the nose) and into the stomach, and food poured down; the suffragettes were held down by force while the instruments were inserted into their bodies, an experience which has been likened to rape. In a smuggled letter, Sylvia Pankhurst described how the warders held her down and forced her mouth open with a steel gag. Her gums bled, and she vomited most of the liquid up afterwards.\n\nEmmeline Pankhurst, founder of the Women's Social and Political Union, was horrified by the screams of women being force-fed in HM Prison Holloway. She wrote: \"Holloway became a place of horror and torment. Sickening scenes of violence took place almost every hour of the day, as the doctors went from cell to cell performing their hideous office. …I shall never while I live forget the suffering I experienced during the days when those cries were ringing in my ears.\" When prison officials tried to enter her cell, Pankhurst, in order to avoid being force-fed, raised a clay jug over her head and announced: \"If any of you dares so much as to take one step inside this cell I shall defend myself.\"\n\nIn 1914, Frances Parker, another suffragette, was being force-fed by the rectum in the Perth prison: \"Thursday morning, 16th July ... the three wardresses appeared again. One of them said that if I did not resist, she would send the others away and do what she had come to do as gently and as decently as possible. I consented. This was another attempt to feed me by the rectum, and was done in a cruel way, causing me great pain. She returned some time later and said she had ‘something else’ to do. I took it to be another attempt to feed me in the same way, but it proved to be a grosser and more indecent outrage, which could have been done for no other purpose than torture. It was followed by soreness, which lasted for several days.\"\n\nDjuna Barnes, the American journalist, agreed to submit to force-feeding for a 1914 \"New York World\" magazine article. Barnes wrote, \"If I, play acting, felt my being burning with revolt at this brutal usurpation of my own functions, how they who actually suffered the ordeal in its acutest horror must have flamed at the violation of the sanctuaries of their spirits.\" She concluded, \"I had shared the greatest experience of the bravest of my sex.\" \n\nThe United Kingdom also used forcible feeding techniques against Irish Republicans during their struggle for independence. In 1917 Irish prisoner Thomas Ashe died as a result of complications from such a feeding while incarcerated at Dublin's Mountjoy Jail. The outrage of Ashe's death from the Irish public was so great that force feeding has never been used in Ireland again since.\n\n \n\nUnder United States jurisdiction, force-feeding is frequently used in the U.S. military prison in Guantanamo Bay, prompting in March 2006 an open letter by 250 doctors in \"The Lancet\", warning that, in their opinion, the participation of any doctor is contrary to the rules of the World Medical Association. Retired Major General Paul E. Vallely visited Guantanamo and reported on the process of force-feeding: \n\nIn the 2009 case \"Lantz v. Coleman\", the Connecticut Superior Court authorized the state Department of Correction to force-feed a competent prisoner who had refused to eat voluntarily. In 2009, terrorist Richard Reid, known as the \"shoe bomber,\" was force-fed while on a hunger strike at the United States Penitentiary, Florence ADX, the federal supermax prison in Colorado. Hundreds of force-feedings have been reported at ADX Florence. \nEthel Byrne was the first female political prisoner in the United States to be subjected to force feeding after she was jailed at Blackwell Island workhouse on January 22, 1917 for her activism in advocating for the legalization of birth control. She subsequently went on a hunger strike and refused to drink water for 185 hours. \n\nOn December 6, 2006, the United Nations War Crimes Tribunal at The Hague approved the use of force-feeding of Serbian politician Vojislav Šešelj. They decided it was not \"torture, inhuman or degrading treatment if there is a medical necessity to do so... and if the manner in which the detainee is force-fed is not inhuman or degrading\".\n\nIn 2015, the Knesset passed a law allowing the force-feeding of prisoners in response to a hunger strike by a Palestinian detainee who had been held for months in administrative detention. Israel doctors refused to feed Mohammad Allan against his will, and he resumed eating after the Supreme Court temporarily released him.\n\nForce-feeding of pernicious substances may be used as a form of torture and/or physical punishment. While in prison in northern Bosnia in 1996, some Serbian prisoners have described being forced to eat paper and soap.\n\nSometimes it has been alleged that prisoners are forced to eat foods forbidden by their religion. The \"Washington Post\" has reported that Muslim prisoners in Abu Ghraib prison under the U.S.-led coalition described in sworn statements having been forced to eat pork and drink alcohol, both of which are strictly forbidden in Islam (see Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse).\n\nAccording to \"Infant feeding by artificial means: a scientific and practical treatise on the dietetics of infancy\", a French system of feeding newborn or premature babies who could not suckle was known as \"gavage\". Sadler dates its origin to 1874 and quotes Étienne Stéphane Tarnier, a pioneer perinatologist, describing the procedure. \n\nForce-feeding used to be practiced in the North Africa and still is in Mauritania. Fatness was considered a marriage asset in women; culturally, voluptuous figures were perceived as indicators of wealth. In this tradition, some girls are forced by their mothers or grandmothers to overeat, often accompanied by physical punishment (e.g., pressing a finger between two pieces of wood) should the girl not eat. The intended result is a rapid onset of obesity, and the practice may start at a young age and continue for years. This is still the tradition in the rather undernourished Sahel country Mauritania (where it is called leblouh), where it induces major health risks in the female population; some younger men no longer insist on voluptuous brides, but traditional beauty norms remain part of the culture.\n\nSlaves who tried to commit suicide by starving themselves were force fed with a contraption called the \"speculum orum\". This device forced the slave's mouth open in order to be fed.\n\nForce-feeding has been used to prepare animals for slaughter. In some cases, such as is the case with geese raised for foie gras, it is still practiced today.\n\nForce-feeding is also known as gavage, from a French word meaning \"to gorge\". This term specifically refers to force-feeding of ducks or geese in order to fatten their livers in the production of foie gras.\nIn modern Egypt, the practice of fattening geese and male Muscovy ducks by force-feeding them various grains is present, mostly by individuals, unrelated to foie gras production, but for general consumption of those birds later. It is not widespread on commercial farms however. The term used for such a practice is called \"Tazgheet\" تزغيط from the verb \"Zaghghat\" زغَط.\n\nForce-feeding of birds is practiced mostly on geese or male Moulard ducks, a Muscovy/Pekin hybrid. Preparation for gavage usually begins 4–5 months before slaughter. For geese, after an initial free-range period and treatment to assist in esophagus dilation (eating grass, for example), the force-feeding commences. Gavage is performed 2–4 times a day for 2–5 weeks, depending on the size of the fowl, using a funnel attached to a slim metal or plastic feeding tube inserted into the bird's throat to deposit the food into the bird's crop (the storage area in the esophagus). A grain mash, usually maize mixed with fats and vitamin supplements, is the feed of choice. Waterfowl are suited to the tube method due to a non-existent gag reflex and an extremely flexible esophagus, unlike other fowl such as chickens. These migratory waterfowl are also said to be ideal for gavage because of their natural ability to gain large amounts of weight in short periods of time before cold seasons.\n\nShen Dzu is a similar practice of force-feeding pigs.\n\nGavage is used in some scientific studies such as those involving the rate of metabolism. It is practiced upon various laboratory animals, such as mice. Liquids such as medicines may be administered to the animals via a tube or syringe.\n\n\n\n"}

There are also several songs referencing the case.\n\nThe five boys were between 9 and 13 years old:\n\nMarch 26, 1991 was a public holiday in South Korea for the 1991 local elections. The boys decided to spend the day catching frogs in the streams of Mount Waryong (). They never returned to their homes.\n\nAfter they were reported missing, their story became a national sensation. President Roh Tae-woo sent 300,000 police and military troops to search for the missing boys, with the searches shown on live TV. Several of the boys' parents left their jobs to travel around the country, looking for their children. Mount Waryong was searched over 500 times.\n\nOn September 26, 2002, a man searching for acorns discovered their bodies in the mountain, an area that had been previously searched. He first reported the remains via an anonymous phone call. Initially, the police stated that they thought the boys had died of hypothermia. However, the parents did not accept that conclusion and demanded a full investigation. The families questioned the conclusion that the boys had simply died after getting lost due to the oddities of the boys' clothes being found tied in knots and of their bodies being found a short distance from the village in an area the boys knew very well. Forensic experts discovered that the boys had been murdered with repeated blows to the head and that one had been shot in the head with a shotgun.\n\nIn 2006, the statute of limitations expired on the case. This means authorities cannot prosecute anyone for the murders. The police said they will continue the investigation to get answers.\n\n"}

Ham's name is an acronym for the lab that prepared him for his historic mission—the Holloman Aerospace Medical Center, located at Holloman Air Force Base in New Mexico, southwest of Alamogordo. His name was also in honor of the commander of Holloman Aeromedical Laboratory, Lieutenant Colonel Hamilton \"Ham\" Blackshear.\n\nHam was born in 1957 in French Cameroons (present day Cameroon), captured by animal trappers and sent to Rare Bird Farm in Miami, Florida. He was purchased by the United States Air Force and brought to Holloman Air Force Base in 1959.\n\nThere were originally 40 chimpanzee flight candidates at Holloman. After evaluation, the number of candidates was reduced to 18, then to 6, including Ham. Officially, Ham was known as No. 65 before his flight, and only renamed \"Ham\" upon his successful return to Earth. This was reportedly because officials did not want the bad press that would come from the death of a \"named\" chimpanzee if the mission were a failure. Among his handlers, No. 65 had been known as \"Chop Chop Chang\".\n\nBeginning in July 1959, the two-year-old chimpanzee was trained under the direction of neuroscientist Joseph V. Brady at Holloman Air Force Base Aero Medical Field Laboratory to do simple, timed tasks in response to electric lights and sounds.\nDuring his pre-flight training, Ham was taught to push a lever within five seconds of seeing a flashing blue light; failure to do so resulted in an application of a mild electric shock to the soles of his feet, while a correct response earned him a banana pellet.\n\nWhat differentiates Ham's mission from all the other primate flights to this point is that he was not merely a passenger, and the results from his test flight led directly to the mission Alan Shepard made on May 5, 1961 aboard \"Freedom 7\".\n\nOn January 31, 1961, Ham was secured in a Project Mercury mission labeled MR-2 and launched from Cape Canaveral, Florida, on a suborbital flight.\nHam had his vital signs and tasks monitored using computers on Earth. The capsule suffered a partial loss of pressure during the flight, but Ham's space suit prevented him from suffering any harm. Ham's lever-pushing performance in space was only a fraction of a second slower than on Earth, demonstrating that tasks could be performed in space. Ham's capsule splashed down in the Atlantic Ocean and was recovered by a rescue ship later that day. His only physical injury was a bruised nose. His flight was 16 minutes and 39 seconds long.\n\nAfter the flight, Ham lived for 17 years in the National Zoo in Washington, D.C.,\nbefore joining a small group of captive chimps at North Carolina Zoo.\n\nAfter his death in 1983, Ham's body was turned over to the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology for necropsy. Following the necropsy, the plan was to have him stuffed and placed on display at the Smithsonian, following Soviet precedent with pioneering space dogs Belka and Strelka. However, this plan was abandoned after a negative public reaction. Ham's remains, minus the skeleton, were buried at the International Space Hall of Fame in Alamogordo, New Mexico. Colonel John Stapp gave the eulogy at the memorial service. The skeleton is held in the collection of the National Museum of Health and Medicine.\n\nHam's backup, Minnie, was the only female chimpanzee trained for the Mercury program. After her role in the Mercury program ended, Minnie became part of an Air Force chimpanzee breeding program, producing nine offspring and helping to raise the offspring of several other members of the chimpanzee colony. She was the last surviving astro-chimpanzee and died at age 41 on March 14, 1998.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Firestone\n\nHarvey Samuel Firestone (December 20, 1868 – February 7, 1938) was an American businessman, and the founder of the Firestone Tire and Rubber Company, one of the first global makers of automobile tires.\n\nFirestone was born on the Columbiana, Ohio farm built by his paternal grandfather. He was the second of Benjamin and Catherine (née Flickinger) Firestone's three sons; Benjamin had a son and a daughter by his first wife. The original farm was disassembled and moved to Greenfield Village, a historical site founded by Henry Ford, in 1983 as part of a larger outdoor museum.\n\nFirestone's paternal great-great-great-grandfather, Hans Nicholas Feuerstein, immigrated from Berg, Bas-Rhin, France, in 1753, and settled in Pennsylvania. Three of Nicholas' sons – including Harvey's great-great-grandfather, Johan Nicholas – changed their surname to \"Firestone\", the English translation of the family's German name \"Feuerstein\".\n\nOn November 20, 1895, Firestone married Idabelle Smith. They eventually had seven children. Notable great-grandchildren include: Andrew Firestone, Nick Firestone, and William Clay Ford, Jr. (the son of Henry Ford's grandson and Harvey and Idabelle's granddaughter Martha).\n\nAfter graduating from Columbiana High School, Firestone worked for the Columbus Buggy Company in Columbus, Ohio before starting his own company in 1890, making rubber tires for carriages. In 1900 he soon saw the huge potential for marketing tires for automobiles and then founded the Firestone Tire and Rubber Company, a pioneer in the mass production of tires. In 1926 he published a book, \"Men and Rubber: The Story of Business\", which was written in collaboration with Samuel Crowther.\n\nIn 1938, Firestone died of coronary thrombosis.\n\nFirestone, Henry Ford, and Thomas Edison were generally considered the three leaders in American industry at the time, and often worked and vacationed together. All three were part of a very exclusive group titled \"The Millionaires' Club.\"\n\nThe main library of Princeton University is named Firestone Library in his honor. It is among the largest university libraries in the world. On August 3, 1950, the Harvey S Firestone Memorial, a large sculpture ensemble dedicated to Firestone, created by sculptors James Earle Fraser and Donald De Lue was dedicated. It is located at Bridgestone Firestone Inc., 1200 Firestone Parkway in Akron, Ohio. In 1974, Firestone was inducted into the Automotive Hall of Fame. Firestone High School in Akron, Ohio, is named in his honor. There is a Harvey S Firestone Park in Columbiana, Ohio. The town Harbel in Liberia, home to Firestone's rubber plantation, the largest in the world, is named after Firestone and his wife Isabelle.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "41299304", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=41299304", "title": "I Am Prepared to Die", "text": "I Am Prepared to Die\n\n\"I Am Prepared to Die\" is the name given to the three-hour speech given by Nelson Mandela on 20 April 1964 from the dock of the defendant at the Rivonia Trial. The speech is so titled because it ends with the words \"it is an ideal for which I am prepared to die\". The speech is considered one of the great speeches of the 20th century, and a key moment in the history of South African democracy.\n\nIn July 1963, ten African National Congress (ANC) leaders were arrested in Rivonia, a suburb of Johannesburg. Along with Mandela, who had been arrested in August 1962 and was serving a five-year sentence, they were accused of counts of sabotage, furthering communism and aiding foreign powers. This included charges of recruiting persons to undertake guerrilla warfare against the South African state, conspiring to aid foreign military against the republic, and furthering acts of communism. The prosecutor Percy Yutar did not explicitly move for the death penalty, but it was generally believed that that was what the state wanted. All defendants pleaded not guilty to the charges.\n\nBefore the trial Mandela and the other defendants decided that instead of testifying as witnesses and submitting to cross-examination he would make a speech from the dock to put the state on trial, by pointing out the injustices of the South African society and its legal system. They also sought to show the political and moral programme of the ANC.\n\nMandela worked on the speech for weeks before the trial, receiving help in editing and polishing it from author Nadine Gordimer and journalist Anthony Sampson. In writing the speech, Mandela was inspired by Fidel Castro's famous \"History Will Absolve Me\" defence speech. He was particularly interested in making the speech appeal to an international audience, inspiring international support for the ANC cause.\n\nMandela's lawyers urged him to leave out the final statement, lest it provoke the judge into sentencing him to death, but Mandela refused. He felt that he was likely to be sentenced to death regardless of his statement, so that saying what he truly felt would be the best option. Nonetheless, he did add the qualifier \"if it needs be\".\n\nWhen the defence announced that Mandela would begin by giving a speech instead of facing a more traditional cross-examination the prosecutor Percy Yutar made a surprised objection: \"My Lord, My Lord, I think you should warn the accused that what he said from the dock has far less weight than if he submitted himself to cross-examination.\" Judge de Wet over-ruled the objection saying, \"I think Mr. Yutar, that counsel for the defence have sufficient experience to be able to advise their clients without your assistance.\" And Bram Fischer the main defence lawyer added \"Neither we, nor our clients are unaware of the provisions of the Criminal Code\", in this way subtly pointing out the fact that Mandela was himself a lawyer with experience in criminal trials. Since in South African law a defendant may not address the court from the witness stand, but only answer questions, Mandela gave the speech from the defendant's dock. He spoke for some three hours, before concluding with the often quoted passage \"I am prepared to die\".\n\nWhile delivering the last line of the speech Mandela looked the judge, Quartus de Wet directly in the eye, the last eye contact between the two during the trial.\n\nThe speech describes why the ANC had decided to go beyond its previous use of constitutional methods and Gandhian non-violent resistance, and adopt sabotage against property (designed to minimise risks of injury and death) as a part of their activism against the South African government and its Apartheid policies (while also training a military wing for possible future use).\n\nMandela began by stating that he had been among the founders of Umkhonto we Sizwe, the armed wing of the ANC, and that he did not deny his involvement in planning sabotage, saying \"I did not plan it in a spirit of recklessness, nor because I have any love for violence. I planned it as a result of a calm and sober assessment of the political situation that had arisen after many years of tyranny, exploitation, and oppression of my people by the whites.\"\n\nMandela argued that all non-violent means had been tried and that they had only resulted in mounting restrictions and reduced freedom for the African people. Referring to the Sharpeville shootings and a number of other instances of government violence against protesters, he stated that \"the government which uses force to support its rule teaches the oppressed to use force to oppose it\", and that the decision to adopt selective use of violent means was \"not because we desire such a course. Solely because the government left us no other choice.\"\n\nMandela also devoted significant effort to refuting the prosecution's charges that he and the ANC had acted under the domination of the Communist Party of South Africa and foreign interests. He likened the alliance between the communists and the ANC to the alliance of the US, Britain and the Soviet Union against Nazi Germany. He discussed in some detail the relationship between the ANC and the Communist Party, explaining that, while the two shared a commitment to action against the apartheid system, he was wedded to a model of constitutional democracy for South Africa (he singled out the British political model for particular praise), and also supported a market economy rather than a communist economic model. He noted that, while there were political differences between the Communists and the ANC, \"theoretical differences among those fighting against oppression is (sic) a luxury that we cannot afford at this stage\". He added that the communists had been the only political group in South Africa who had shown themselves willing to treat Africans as human beings.\n\nMandela's friends Anthony Sampson and Nadine Gordimer, who had both participated in reviewing the speech as written by Mandela, had contrasting reactions to its delivery. Sampson described it as the most effective speech of his career, whereas Gordimer thought the delivery to be \"hesitant, parsonical\" until \"only at the end did the man come through and when he had spoken that last sentence the strangest and most moving sound I have ever heard from human throats, came from the 'black' side of the court audience\" .\n\nAt the end of the trial Mandela was convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment. He served 27 years of the sentence before he was released and elected President of South Africa. Upon his release he quoted the last sentence of his speech to the awaiting press. Mandela believed that the reason Judge de Wet had not sentenced him to death was because, by his speech, Mandela had \"dared him to do so\".\n\n"}

A Walt Disney Pictures production, it features an ensemble cast that includes Meryl Streep, Emily Blunt, James Corden, Anna Kendrick, Chris Pine, Tracey Ullman, Christine Baranski, Lilla Crawford, Daniel Huttlestone, MacKenzie Mauzy, Billy Magnussen, and Johnny Depp. Inspired by the Grimm Brothers' fairy tales of \"Little Red Riding Hood\", \"Cinderella\", \"Jack and the Beanstalk\", and \"Rapunzel\", the film is a fantasy genre centered on a childless couple, who set out to end a curse placed on them by a vengeful witch. Ultimately, the characters are forced to rectify the consequences of their actions.\n\nAfter several unsuccessful attempts by other studios and producers to adapt the musical to film, Disney announced in 2012 that it was producing an adaptation, with Marshall directing and John DeLuca serving as producer. Principal photography commenced in September 2013, and took place entirely in the United Kingdom, including at Shepperton Studios in London.\n\n\"Into the Woods\" held its world premiere at the Ziegfeld Theatre in New York City on December 8, 2014, and was released theatrically in the United States on December 25, 2014. The film was commercially successful and received generally positive reviews, receiving praise for its acting performances, visual style, and production merits, but received criticism for its lighter tone compared to the source material and the changes made for the film translation. It grossed $213 million worldwide. \"Into the Woods\" received three Academy Award nominations at the 87th Academy Awards, including a Best Supporting Actress nomination for Streep, and three Golden Globe Award nominations at the 72nd Golden Globe Awards, including Best Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy.\n\nA baker (James Corden) and his wife (Emily Blunt) wish for a child but suffer under a curse laid upon the baker's family by a Witch (Meryl Streep) who found the baker's father robbing her garden when his mother was pregnant. Because the baker's father also stole some magic beans, the witch's own mother cursed her to be ugly. The witch is able to lift the curse and allow them to have a child, but only if the baker and his wife obtain four critical items for her to make a potion: a white cow, a red cape, a yellow strand of hair, and a golden slipper, none of which she is allowed to touch.\n\nThe witch's demands eventually bring the baker and his wife into contact with Jack (Daniel Huttlestone), who is selling his beloved cow, Milky-White, and to whom the baker offers magic beans left him by his father (which were stolen from the witch) which grow into a large beanstalk; with Red Riding Hood (Lilla Crawford), whose red cape the couple noticed when she stopped by the bakery earlier to buy bread and sweets on her way to grandmother's house; with blonde-haired Rapunzel (MacKenzie Mauzy), whose tower the baker's wife passes in the woods; and with Cinderella (Anna Kendrick), who also runs into the baker's wife while fleeing from the pursuing prince (Chris Pine) and whose ball outfit includes gold slippers.\n\nAfter a series of failed attempts and misadventures, the baker and his wife are finally able to gather the items necessary to break the spell. Meanwhile, each of the other characters receives a \"happy ending\": Cinderella marries the prince; Rapunzel is freed from her guardian, the witch, by Cinderella's prince's brother and marries him; Jack provides for his mother by stealing riches from the Giant in the sky, and kills the pursuing giant by cutting down the beanstalk; Little Red Riding Hood and her grandmother are saved from the Big Bad Wolf (Johnny Depp); and the witch regains her youth and beauty after drinking the potion.\n\nHowever, each of the characters learns that their endings don't remain happy: the baker is worried that he is a poor father to his newborn baby; the baker's wife is temporarily seduced by the prince; Cinderella is disenchanted by her cheating prince; and the witch learns that she has lost her magic powers. The growth of a second beanstalk from the last remaining magic bean allows the giant's wife to climb down and threaten the kingdom and its inhabitants if they do not deliver Jack in retribution for killing her husband. The characters attempt to find Jack, but debate the morality of handing Jack over. In the process, Red Riding Hood's mother and grandmother, Jack's mother, and the baker's wife are killed. The characters blame each other for their individual actions that led to the tragedy, ultimately blaming the witch for growing the beans in the first place. She curses them for their inability to accept responsibility for their individual actions. Casting all the remaining beans away, the witch begs her mother to punish her again, hoping to regain her powers, but instead she disappears into a large pit of boiling tar.\n\nThe remaining characters resolve to kill the threatening giant's wife though Cinderella and the baker try to explain to the distraught Red Riding Hood and Jack the complicated morality of retribution and revenge. The characters lure the giant's wife into stepping in the tar pit where she ultimately trips and falls to her death. With the giant's wife dead, the characters move forward with their ruined lives. The baker, thinking of his wife, is determined to be a good father. Cinderella decides to leave the prince and help the baker, and Jack and Red Riding Hood, now orphans, are living with the baker and Cinderella. The baker comforts his son after he begins to cry by telling the story of the film as the movie ends with the witch's moral, meaning that children can change due to the parent's actions and behaviors.\n\nWhile it was initially reported that Disney had decided to make some major plot changes for the film version in order to make it more family friendly, Stephen Sondheim revealed that this was not the case and that any changes in the film version had been approved by him and James Lapine.\n\nThus the film does slightly differ from the stage production. The songs \"I Guess This Is Goodbye\", \"Maybe They're Magic\", \"First Midnight\" and \"Second Midnight\" interludes, \"Ever After\" (Act I finale of the original play), \"So Happy\", \"Into the Woods\" Reprise, \"Agony\" Reprise and \"No More\" (performed by the baker) were cut from the film, although both \"Ever After\" and \"No More\" are used as instrumentals in the film. Meanwhile, many of the songs in the film have slightly different lyrics than their stage counterparts due to the slight tweaking of story lines.\n\nOther changes include a major reduction of the significant role of the \"mysterious man\", who manipulates much of the action in the first act and is eventually revealed to be the baker's father. Also, the character of the narrator is deleted, and the film is instead narrated by the baker. The minor role of Cinderella's father was cut, and he is instead mentioned as deceased. Due to the film's compressed story line, Rapunzel's pregnancy is eliminated, as is the subplot where the two princes have affairs with Snow White and Sleeping Beauty. In the film, the giant's wife attacks during the marriages of Cinderella and Rapunzel to their respective princes, no more than a few weeks after the events of act one; in the stage show, nearly a year passes between the first and second acts. Rapunzel's ultimate fate is also changed: rather than being killed by the giant, she refuses to cooperate with the witch and flees with her prince.\n\nSimilarly, much of the violence and sexual content is slightly toned down from the original musical. For instance, the death of Jack's mother is less violent in the film. On stage, the steward clubs her to death with his staff; in the film, he simply shoves her to the ground and she hits her head on a log. The death of the baker's wife is not explicitly shown in the film, and the cause of her death is changed from being crushed by a tree in the giant's wife's wake to accidentally backing off the edge of a cliff while fleeing from the wife of the giant.\n\nEarly attempts of adapting \"Into the Woods\" to film occurred in the early 1990s, with a script written by Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandel. A reading was held with a cast that included Robin Williams as the Baker, Goldie Hawn as the Baker's Wife, Cher as the Witch, Danny DeVito as the Giant, Steve Martin as the Wolf, and Roseanne Barr as Jack's Mother. By 1991, Columbia Pictures and Jim Henson Productions were also developing a film adaptation with Craig Zadan as producer and Rob Minkoff as director. In 1997, Columbia put the film into turnaround, with Minkoff still attached as director, and Billy Crystal, Meg Ryan, and Susan Sarandon reportedly in talks to star. After the report by \"Variety\", a film adaptation of \"Into the Woods\" remained inactive for 15 years.\n\nAfter the critical and commercial success of \"Chicago\" in 2002, director Rob Marshall approached Stephen Sondheim as he was interested in adapting one of his musicals such as \"Follies\" and \"\", although Sondheim suggested \"Into the Woods\" instead. Marshall concurred, but development of the project was then postponed while he focused on directing \"Memoirs of a Geisha\" and \"Nine\". In 2011, Marshall's interest in the project was rekindled when he heard a speech by President Barack Obama on the tenth anniversary of the September 11th attacks to the families of the 9/11 victims, which seemed to evoke the same message as the musical's most important song, \"No One Is Alone\". Marshall firmly believed that \"Into the Woods\" was “a fairy tale for the post-9/11 generation\". In January 2012, Marshall approached Walt Disney Pictures—for whom he had just directed \"\"—and pitched the idea to the studio, with Lapine writing the script and Sondheim \"expected\" to write new songs. Academy Award-winner Dion Beebe, who previously collaborated with Marshall on \"Chicago\", \"Memoirs of a Geisha\", and \"Nine\", served as cinematographer. Sondheim confirmed that a new song had been written for the film.\n\nWith Disney's backing, a three-day reading of the entire updated screenplay took place in New York in October 2012 under Marshall's direction, with Nina Arianda as the Baker's Wife, Victoria Clark as Cinderella's Mother/Granny/Giant, James Corden as the Baker, Donna Murphy as the Witch, Christine Baranski as Cinderella's Stepmother, Tammy Blanchard as Florinda, Ivan Hernandez as the Wolf, Megan Hilty as Lucinda, Cheyenne Jackson as Rapunzel's Prince, Allison Janney as Jack's Mother, Anna Kendrick as Cinderella, Michael McGrath as Steward/Mysterious Man, Laura Osnes as Rapunzel, Taylor Trensch as Jack, Casey Whyland as Little Red Riding Hood, and Patrick Wilson as Cinderella's Prince. It was this reading which ultimately convinced Walt Disney Studios president Sean Bailey to green-light the film despite ongoing concerns about the dark nature of the original musical (which Disney executives had begun to understand since Marshall's original pitch). However, Disney (which self-finances all its films) provided only a relatively small production budget of $50 million (relative to other feature-length fantasy films on its development slate), in turn forcing both cast and crew to accept pay cuts to work on the film.\n\nReports subsequently surfaced in January 2013 that Meryl Streep had been cast to play the Witch. Streep had instituted a personal \"no witch\" rule after she turned 40 and was offered three witch roles, but ultimately broke her own rule to do a Sondheim role again. (As a young Yale University student, she had participated in the original production of Sondheim's \"The Frogs\".) During the same month, it was reported that Janney had been confirmed to join the film as well. Five months later, however, Tracey Ullman was cast as Jack's Mother instead.\nIn April 2013, Johnny Depp was in final negotiations, along with Streep, to join the film. \"The Hollywood Reporter\" reported that to help make the film on such a tight budget, Depp agreed as a favor to Disney and to Marshall (whom he had just worked with in \"On Stranger Tides\") to a \"boarding\" arrangement, in which he would appear in a minor role for a fee of $1 million, instead of his typical fee of $20 million for a starring role. In May, James Corden, who took part in the reading of the screenplay, was in talks to play the role of the Baker. On May 10, 2013, Disney confirmed the casting of Streep, Depp, and Corden as the Witch, the Big Bad Wolf, and the Baker, respectively. That same month, Emily Blunt and Christine Baranski were cast, respectively, as the Baker's Wife and Cinderella's Stepmother. Marshall later confirmed that Blunt was selected for her \"warm[th]\" and likeability to ensure the emotional impact of the sudden death of the Baker's Wife: \"[T]hat's very important for that character because it's the heart of the piece and you really have to love her so when she's gone it should feel like a kick in the gut.\" After she was cast, Blunt discovered she was pregnant and her costume and choreography had to be adjusted accordingly. However, her \"overweight\" appearance during production actually fit in with the role of the Baker's Wife; as she explained, \"I feel like she would have eaten a lot of carbs working in the bakery.\"\n\nAlso in May, Jake Gyllenhaal and Chris Pine entered negotiations to play the Princes. However, Gyllenhaal dropped out of the film due to scheduling conflicts with another film, \"Nightcrawler\", and was subsequently replaced by Billy Magnussen. One month later, Anna Kendrick began talks to play Cinderella in the film. In June 2013, Walt Disney Studios publicly announced that the film had been greenlighted, and scheduled a release date for Christmas Day 2014. In July, MacKenzie Mauzy, Tammy Blanchard, Lucy Punch and Daniel Huttlestone joined the cast. In early August, Sophia Grace Brownlee's representatives announced that she had been cast as Little Red Riding Hood. The announcement of Brownlee's casting, which was widely reported but never confirmed by Disney, was criticized as \"a stunt\" and was met with concern due to her age and the sexual undertones present between Little Red and the Wolf. Mauzy later revealed that she first auditioned for Cinderella but did not get the part. However, director Marshall saw her audition tape and brought her back in for Rapunzel, after recognizing \"the 'vulnerability' and 'emotion' Mauzy could bring to Rapunzel after she read just one line\", as he recalled. The film's plot synopsis and the official casting of lead actors Meryl Streep, Johnny Depp, Anna Kendrick, Chris Pine, and Emily Blunt were revealed at the D23 Expo on August 10, 2013. On September 16, 2013, Lilla Crawford was confirmed as playing the character of Little Red Riding Hood, despite previous reports suggesting Brownlee. Crawford auditioned for Marshall via Skype, who offered her the role within two hours; she was on a flight to London the next day. Later on, Dominic Brownlee spoke about the withdrawal of his daughter Sophia Grace from the movie: \"After careful consideration, we the parents of Sophia Grace, felt that as rehearsals progressed that she was too young for this part. It was a joint decision between us and the director and producer of \"Into the Woods\" to withdraw Sophia Grace from the film.\" Apart from Crawford, the casting of Richard Glover, Frances de la Tour, Simon Russell Beale, Joanna Riding, and Annette Crosbie in other roles was also separately announced later on September 16.\n\nIn July 2013, before filming began, Marshall put the cast through six weeks of rehearsals on a soundstage and blocked their scenes. In August, the cast members visited Angel Recording Studios to separately record their respective parts in the presence of Sondheim himself. Over 90% of the vocal tracks in the final version of the film are from the recording studio sessions, while the rest were recorded on location or on the set. The advantage of blocking and rehearsing all scenes first was that the cast members could then precisely calibrate their voices in the recording studio to the planned appearance of each scene when later filmed, thereby minimizing the slightly disconcerting disconnection between vocals and choreography typical of music videos.\n\nPrincipal photography took place at London's Shepperton Studios in September 2013, with additional filming taking place at Dover Castle, Hambleden, Waverley Abbey, and Richmond Park. A forest of ancient pine trees in Windsor Great Park was used for many of the scenes in the woods. Marshall struggled with how to stage the melodramatic duet \"Agony\" in the forest until discovering online that Windsor had an artificial waterfall at Virginia Water Lake, which turned out to be the perfect location for the song. The production was shot digitally, using Arri Alexa cameras configured in a two-camera setup. Footage was edited together in Avid Media Composer. The exterior of Byfleet Manor in Surrey served as Cinderella's home.\n\nThe filmmakers spent a whole day shooting scenes which involved Rapunzel's hair being climbed upon. Mauzy claimed that the filmmakers wanted to take advantage of her blonde hair, and that the top of Rapunzel's hair appeared in the film was her own real hair; make-up artists only braided it into the extension. This hair extension was engineered by hair designer Peter King. After testing loose, flowing hair which King found \"uncontrollable\", he decided to have twenty-seven wefts of real hair woven together into a 30-foot braid, a design which took inspiration from an Arthur Rackham illustration of Rapunzel. In order to bring in enough real Russian hair strands needed for the extension, King and his team had to work with several distributors from Germany and England. The hair-braiding process required three people, each holding a separate strand and weaving in and out. King also dyed the wefts for them to match Mauzy's champagne blonde hair color, and blended together six different shades from ash and strawberry\nto create realistic gradations and highlights. Between scenes, Mauzy had to \"wrap [the hair] around her arm like huge rolls of wool\", as recalled by King. A stuntman was employed to shoot hair-climbing scenes. Thin rope and metal rings were the only additional tools concealed within the braid to hold the weight of a person climbing up.\n\nThe film's final shot, which essentially merges into and links back to its first shot, actually transitions digitally between three shots: a Technocrane on location lifting as high as possible into the sky, an aerial drone flying down a valley in Wales, and a shot of an overcast sky in Manhattan, New York City. Filming concluded on November 27, 2013.\n\nOn July 14, 2014, Steve Baldwin posted on a social networking site that reshoots were made during the whole month of July. The following month, however, Rob Marshall denied the film went through re-shoots. Instead, they spent three days shooting new material that had been cut and re-added to the script after Disney screened the movie. For his role as the Wolf, Depp worked closely with the film's costume designer Colleen Atwood to create a Tex Avery-inspired costume, complete with zoot suit and fedora.\n\nAs noted above, the majority of the songs were pre-recorded by the cast. Music producer Mike Higham, who had previously worked with Sondheim on \"Sweeney Todd\": \"The Demon Barber of Fleet Street\", recorded the film's score with the London Symphony Orchestra and London Philharmonic. Music supervisor and conductor Paul Gemignani instructed the actors on how to sing, including singing live to a camera on set, to prerecorded music in studio, and with a live studio orchestra. Jonathan Tunick orchestrated Sondheim's original music. The key to the song, \"Hello, Little Girl,\" was altered to better suit Johnny Depp's lower vocal range. In regards to the song's musical arrangement, Higham explained, \"we emphasized the woodwinds to make it feel a little lighter, especially the flutes. And we just made it a little jazzier — played more on the walking bass line. Inherently, when it has a jazz feel, it just feels lighter.\" The film's soundtrack was released by Walt Disney Records on December 15, 2014.\n\nWhile it was initially reported that the film version would feature two new songs: a duet for the Baker and his Wife, titled \"Rainbows\"—originally written for a 1992 film adaptation that was never made—and a new song for the Witch, eventually titled \"She'll Be Back\". In the end, neither song appears in the finished film: \"Rainbows\" was cut before shooting began and \"She'll Be Back\", though filmed, was cut from the film on the grounds that it slowed the story down. \"She'll Be Back\" was included as a bonus feature on the film's home media release.\n\nThe first official company presentation took place at the 2013 Disney D23 expo. The official teaser trailer debuted on July 31, 2014. A featurette was released showing behind-the-scenes clips and the vocals of Streep, Kendrick, Blunt and others. A second trailer was released on November 6, 2014.\n\nThe film held its world premiere at the Ziegfeld Theatre in New York City on December 8, 2014. It was released theatrically in the United States on December 25, 2014.\n\nWalt Disney Studios Home Entertainment released the film on Blu-ray, DVD, and digital download in North America on March 24, 2015. The film debuted in second place on the home media charts behind \"\". The home media version includes Stephen Sondheim and James Lapine's original song \"She'll Be Back\".\n\n\"Into the Woods\" grossed $128 million in North America, and $85.1 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $213.1 million, against a budget of $50 million.\n\n\"Into the Woods\" began playing across North American theaters on December 24, 2014, and earned $1.1 million from late-night Christmas Eve showings and $15.08 million on its opening day (including previews) from 2,440 theaters. Its opening day gross was the fourth-biggest Christmas Day debut and the sixth-biggest Christmas Day gross ever. The film was among one of four films put into wide release on December 25, 2014, the other three being Universal Pictures' \"Unbroken\" (3,131 theaters), Paramount Pictures' \"The Gambler\" (2,478 theaters), and TWC's \"Big Eyes\" (1,307 theaters). It earned $31.1 million in its traditional three-day opening ($46.1 million including its Christmas Day gross) debuting at #2 at the box office behind \"\", achieving the highest opening weekend for a film based on a Broadway musical (previously held by \"Mamma Mia!\"). The film's $3.5 million debut in Japan marked the largest opening for a 21st-century live-action musical film.\n\nThe review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes reports an approval rating of 71% based on 207 reviews, with an average rating of 6.6/10. The site's consensus reads: \"On the whole, this Disney adaptation of the Sondheim classic sits comfortably at the corner of Hollywood and Broadway—even if it darkens to its detriment in the final act.\" Another review aggregator, Metacritic, calculate a weighted average score of 69 out of 100, based on 41 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\". In CinemaScore polls conducted during the opening weekend, audiences gave the film an average grade of \"B\" on an A+ to F scale.\n\nStreep was immensely applauded for her performance as the Witch, with many critics and audiences believing she was the film's heart. Lou Lumenick of the New York Post called her and Blunt's portrayals as \"two of the greatest female performances of the year\". For her performance, Streep received Academy Award, Golden Globe Award, Screen Actors Guild Award, and Broadcast Film Critics Association Award nominations for Best Supporting Actress.\n\n\"The Hollywood Reporter\" wrote that the film \"benefits from respect for the source material, enticing production values and a populous gallery of sharp character portraits from a delightful cast\". Stephen Holden of \"The New York Times\" lauded the film, writing; \"\"Into the Woods\", the splendid Disney screen adaptation of the Stephen Sondheim-James Lapine musical, infuses new vitality into the tired marketing concept of entertainment for 'children of all ages'\". Leonard Maltin called the movie as \"one of the year's best films\". Similarly, Pete Hammond of Deadline praised the film as \"the most dazzling movie musical since Marshall's own Chicago.\" and praised the performance of the cast, particularly Streep. Lou Lumerick of the New York Post called the film \"this century's best musical\" and lauded the performances of Streep and Blunt as the best female performances of the year. Scott Mendelson of \"Forbes\" gave a positive review declaring the film \"Rob Marshall's best movie ever\" and praised it for its genuine entertainment and strong cast performances. Richard Corliss of \"Time\" gave a positive review, stating that the film was a \"smart, appealing, upside-down children's story for adults of all ages\". Gregory Ellwood of HitFix tipped Streep as an Academy Award contender in the Best Supporting Actress category, and also praised the performance of Chris Pine.\n\nRichard Lawson of \"Vanity Fair\", Karen D'Souza of the \"San Jose Mercury News\", and Dana Stevens of \"Slate\" all published critical reviews of the film. All three found much to like in the acting (especially Blunt and Pine's performances), but all three also concluded that after the various cuts and changes, the final version of the film had failed to adequately preserve the power of the dark existentialist message at the heart of the original musical's second act. Stevens characterized the result as a \"generic dystopian bummer,\" while Lawson criticized the film as a \"dutiful but perfunctory adaptation\" which lacked \"genuine heart\". Paul Katz of \"The Huffington Post\" felt the change in tone between the last two acts was too abrupt, and also criticized the film's faithfulness to the stage musical. Conversely, Alyssa Rosenberg of \"The Washington Post\" disliked the performances by Streep and Depp, while simultaneously calling the film's first two acts a \"surprising delight\".\n\n\n \n"}
{"id": "21501309", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21501309", "title": "James Laver", "text": "James Laver\n\nJames Laver, CBE, FRSA (14 March 1899 – 3 June 1975) was an English author, critic, art historian, and museum curator who acted as Keeper of Prints, Drawings and Paintings for the Victoria and Albert Museum between 1938 and 1959. He was also an important and pioneering fashion historian described as \"the man in England who made the study of costume respectable\".\n\nJames Laver was born in Liverpool, England, on 14 March 1899, the second child and only son of Arthur James Laver, a maritime printer and stationer, and his wife, Florence Mary (née Barker), strict Congregationalists who brought up their children in a puritanical manner. He attended the Liverpool Institute. His academic progress was put on hold by the First World War, in which he served as a second lieutenant.\n\nIn 1919 he resumed his residency at New College, Oxford, where he earned a BA degree second class in modern history 1921. The next year, he earned a B.Litt in theology for a thesis on John Wesley. His college fees and travel expenses were subsidised by a wealthy shipping magnate, Lawrence Holt. At Oxford, he contributed to the student magazine \"Isis\" and won the 1921 Newdigate Prize for his poem on \"Cervantes\".\n\nIn 1922, Laver entered the Department of Engraving, Illustration, Design and Painting at the Victoria & Albert Museum. He arrived shortly before the \"International Theatre Exhibition\" was transferred to the V&A from Amsterdam and was shown as part of his department. It showcased work by all the leading European designers of the time, and the Museum purchased several designs and models, which became the basis of the Museum's Theatre Collection. Laver was put in charge of this collection. Stage design became one of his passions, possibly in reaction against his upbringing. In 1938 he succeeded Martin Hardie as Keeper of the department, a post he held until his retirement in 1958. Despite his significant contributions to object-centred dress history, he was never Keeper of Textiles for the Museum, or part of the Textiles section.\n\nLaver is perhaps best remembered for his contributions to the field of fashion history, an interest in which emerged through a desire to date images accurately through the clothing depicted within. Laver defined the relationships between dress design and other applied arts, and discussed the influence of economic and social factors upon the development of fashionable taste. In 1962, Laver received a Neiman Marcus Fashion Award in recognition of his work in the field of fashion history. In 1937 Laver, with Pearl Binder, co-presented the first television programme to be dedicated to fashion history. \"Clothes-Line\", a six-part series, was so successful that in 1938, Laver and Binder reunited to present a revised re-tread (in three parts) of the programme, this time called \"Clothes Through The Centuries\".\n\nLaver followed the theories of Thorstein Veblen and John Flügel, using them to develop his favourite theories. These were:\n\nIn the 1980s and 1990s, feminist fashion historians such as Elizabeth Wilson and Amanda Vickery found these problematic, arguing that Laver and C. Willett Cunnington's views trivialised women's behaviour, role within the family, and their contributions to society and culture.\n\nLaver's Law was an attempt to compress the complex cycle of fashion change and the general attitude towards any certain style or period into a simple timeline. It first appeared in \"Taste and Fashion\" (1937):\n\nTo supplement his pay whilst at the Victoria & Albert Museum, Laver dedicated his free time to writing magazine articles, book reviews, play translations, dramatic criticism and light verse. One of the plays he translated was Klabund's \"The Circle of Chalk\" from the original German.\n\nHis 1927 poem, \"A Stitch in Time\", a pastiche of Alexander Pope's The Rape of the Lock set in modern times, successfully captured public attention, and led to Laver's popularity as a fashionable party guest. A sequel in 1929 followed, \"Love's Progress\", the two poems being published together as \"Ladies' Mistakes\" in 1933.\n\nIn 1932 he published a novel, \"Nymph Errant\", about a girl returning to her finishing school, who went astray along the way and ended up in a Turkish harem. It was an instant best-seller and in 1933, Charles B. Cochran turned it into a musical, \"Nymph Errant\", featuring songs by Cole Porter and Gertrude Lawrence as the leading lady. Laver felt as if he was leading a double life. He once stated:\"To my colleagues at South Kensington I had become a cigar-smoking, Savoy-supping, enviable but slightly disreputable character, hobnobbing with chorus girls and hanging round stage doors. To Gertrude Lawrence and her friends I was something 'in a museum', engaged in mysterious and apparently useless activities quite outside their comprehension; a character out of \"The Old Curiosity Shop\", hardly fit to be let out alone.\"\n\nLaver continued to write fiction and work for the theatre and film on a less ambitious scale, but did not attempt becoming a full-time writer. His work on films included acting as historical advisor for \"The Amorous Adventures of Moll Flanders\" (1965) and \"The Amateur Gentleman\" (1936), and he co-wrote the screenplay for \"Warning to Wantons\" (1948). During the Second World War, he determined to read all the books on occultism in the London Library. As a result, he became an expert in the field, writing a book on the prophet Nostradamus.\n\nBetween 1926 and 1938, James Laver was the Director of Art Classes at the Working Men's College, Camden Town. He ran a course on English literature and also re-organised the art class, introducing living models.\n\nLaver married the Irish actress Veronica Turleigh (1903–1971), a Roman Catholic in 1928. The couple had two children, a son and a daughter. They first lived in a flat in Piccadilly, London, which proved convenient for their theatrical friends, and later moved to Chelsea.\n\nLaver died on 3 June 1975 following a fire at his home in Blackheath, London.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

He was a member of the Workers Film and Photo League in the early 1930s. He travelled to the Soviet Union in 1933 to study filmmaking at State Film Institute, Moscow, with Sergei Eisenstein. He participated in the filming of Eisenstein's lost film \"Bezhin Meadow\" (1935–37). When he returned to the United States in 1936 to become an assistant film curator at the Museum of Modern Art, he brought the only complete print of Eisenstein's \"Battleship Potemkin.\" In the 1940s he translated Eisenstein's writings.\n\nHis \"The Melville Log\" (1951) was a day to day compilation of documents which he had painstakingly collected on the life of Herman Melville.\n\nLeyda’s wife, Si-lan Chen, a ballet dancer of international reputation, was the daughter of Eugene Chen, a colleague of the Chinese revolutionary Sun Yat-sen. Leyda was invited in 1959 to work at the Film Archive of China in Beijing, where he stayed until 1964. His account of Chinese film history, \"Dianying\", was the first full length treatment to appear in English. Although he could use the basic (and now outdated) Chinese scholarship only in summary translations, Leyda’s knowledge of film gave him still useful insights into individual films and techniques.\n\nHe was awarded the Eastman Kodak Gold Medal Award in 1984. He taught at Yale University (1969-1972), York University (1972-73) and New York University from 1973 until his death in New York on February 15, 1988, of heart failure. He was professor and dissertation advisor to noted film historian, Charles H. Harpole (creator of the ten volume History of American Cinema, dedicated to Leyda); leading film theorist, Tom Gunning; and scholar-practitioner Charles Musser. In 1981 he was a member of the jury at the 12th Moscow International Film Festival. He co-curated (with Charles Musser) \"Before Hollywood: Turn of the Century American Film\" (1987) for the American Federation of Arts, a six-part touring program of American films with an accompanying catalog, which the \"New York Times\" called \"A fascinating look at the cinema that flourished between 1895 and 1915 in America, before movies could be mentioned in family newspapers.\" \n\n\n\n"}

He is a past president of the Gerontological Society of America and was a founding member of the council of the National Institute on Aging (NIA). The recipient of a number of research prizes and awards, including the 1991 Sandoz Prize for Gerontological Research, he has studied the aging process for more than fifty years. He is known for discovering that normal human cells divide for a limited number of times \"in vitro\" (refuting the contention by Alexis Carrel that normal body cells are immortal). This is known as the Hayflick limit. His discoveries overturned a 60-year old dogma that all cultured cells are immortal. Hayflick demonstrated that normal cells have a memory and can remember at what doubling level they have reached. He demonstrated that his normal human cell strains were free from contaminating viruses. His cell strain WI-38 soon replaced primary monkey kidney cells and became the substrate for the production of most of the world's human virus vaccines. Hayflick discovered that the etiological agent of primary atypical pneumonia (also called \"walking pneumonia\") was not a virus as previously believed. He was the first to cultivate the causative organism called a mycoplasma, the smallest free-living organism, which Hayflick isolated on a unique culture medium that bears his name. He named the organism \"Mycoplasma pneumoniae\".\n\nIn 1959, Hayflick developed the first inverted microscope for use in cell culture research. To this day, all inverted microscopes used in cell culture laboratories worldwide are descended from this prototype. His microscope was accessioned by the Smithsonian Institution in 2009.\n\nHayflick developed the first practical method for producing powdered cell culture media in 1965. This method is now used worldwide for the production of many tons of powdered media annually for use in research laboratories and commercial production facilities. The technique is not patented and Hayflick receives no remuneration from this invention. \n\nHayflick is the author of the book, \"How and Why We Age\", published in August 1994 by Ballantine Books, NYC and available since 1996 as a paperback. This book has been translated into nine languages and is published in Brazil, the Czech Republic, Germany, Hungary, Israel, Japan, Poland, Russia, and Spain. It was a selection of the Book of the Month Club and has sold over 50,000 copies worldwide.\n\nHayflick and his associates have vehemently condemned \"anti-aging medicine\" and criticized organizations such as the American Academy of Anti-Aging Medicine. Hayflick has written numerous articles criticizing both the feasibility and desirability of human life extension, which have provoked responses critical of his views.\n\nLeonard Hayflick was born 20 May 1928 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. He received his Ph.D. at the University of Pennsylvania in 1956. After receiving a post-doctoral fellowship for study at the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston under the tutelage of the renowned cell culturist Prof. Charles M. Pomerat, he returned to Philadelphia, where he spent ten years as an Associate Member of the Wistar Institute and two years as an Assistant Professor of Research Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania.\n\nIn 1968, Hayflick was appointed Professor of Medical Microbiology at the Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, California. Hayflick resigned from Stanford in 1976 in protest to the behavior of a few of its administrators who were later shown to have wrongly accepted the beliefs of an NIH accountant who was unable to understand the unique concept of title to a self-duplicating biological system. Hayflick sued the NIH, who later agreed that the issue was in dispute. The behavior of Stanford and the NIH was later condemned by 85 prominent biologists who viewed him as having been \"exonerated\" by subsequent events. In 1982 he moved to the University of Florida, Gainesville, where he became Director of the Center for Gerontological Studies and Professor of Zoology in the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences and Professor of Microbiology and Immunology in the College of Medicine.\n\nIn 1988, Hayflick joined the faculty of the University of California, San Francisco, where he is currently Professor of Anatomy. Hayflick is a member of numerous national and international scientific and public boards of directors and committees. He is now, or has been, on the Editorial Boards of more than ten professional journals. Hayflick was Editor-in-Chief of the international journal “Experimental Gerontology” for 13 years.\n\nHe is a member of twenty scientific and professional societies in which he has held several high offices including President of the Gerontological Society of America from 1982 to 1983. He was a founding member of the Council of the National Institute on Aging, NIH and Chairman of its Executive Committee. He was a consultant to the National Cancer Institute and the World Health Organization, and is now a member of several scientific advisory boards. He was Chairman of the Scientific Review Board of the American Federation for Aging Research where he was also a vice president and a Member of the Board of Directors. He was also recruited by Michael D. West, founder of Geron () and current CEO of BioTime, to join the company's Scientific and Clinical Advisory Board, on which he served from 1991-2000. Hayflick was also a consultant at Genentech from a year after its founding and for the next 25 years. He developed their technology for growing animal cells in fermentation tanks in which most of their products were produced.\n\nHayflick is one of several prominent biologists featured in the 1995 science documentary Death by Design/The Life and Times of Life and Times.\n\nHayflick is known for his research in cell biology, virus vaccine development, and mycoplasmology. In 1962 he discovered that, contrary to the prevailing belief at the time, cultured normal human and animal cells have a limited capacity for replication. This discovery, known as the Hayflick limit, overturned a long-held belief bolstered by Alexis Carrel's work in the early 20th century that claimed that normal cells would proliferate continuously in culture. Hayflick found that only cancer cells are immortal and that normal cells have a mechanism for remembering at what replication level they are at. He interpreted his finding that normal cells are mortal to be an indication of aging at the cellular level. Hayflick demonstrated for the first time that mortal (normal) and immortal (malignant) mammalian cells existed.\n\nHayflick developed the first normal human diploid cell strains for studies on human aging and for research use throughout the world. Prior to his seminal research, all cultured cell lines were immortal and aneuploid. One of these new cell strains, developed by Hayflick and his colleague Paul Moorehead at the Wistar Institute in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, called WI-38, has become the most widely used and highly characterized normal human cell population in the world. Hayflick had found that his normal cell strain WI-38 was capable of growing all of the then known human viruses. He hypothesized that because WI-38 was free from contaminating viruses, it could replace the then widely used primary monkey kidney cells, which contained several dangerous contaminating viruses. Indeed, WI-38 became used worldwide for human virus vaccine manufacture, to the benefit of billions of people.\n\nHayflick produced the first oral polio vaccine ever made on his normal human cell strain WI-38. WI-38 is now used for the production of all of the Rubella Virus vaccine used in the Western Hemisphere. WI-38, or new diploid cell strains, are used today for the manufacture of most human virus vaccines produced throughout the world including those for poliomyelitis, rubella, rubeola, varicella, mumps, rabies, adenoviruses and hepatitis A. Over one billion vaccinees have received vaccines produced on WI-38 or foreign versions of Hayflick's original WI-38.\n\nHayflick is also known for his discovery of the cause of primary atypical pneumonia (“walking pneumonia”) in humans. The etiological agent was first thought to be a virus, but Hayflick showed that it was, in fact, a mycoplasma, a member of the smallest free-living class of microorganisms. The etiological agent was named by him as \"Mycoplasma pneumoniae\", and was first grown by Hayflick on a medium he developed and that bears his name. It is now used worldwide for mycoplasma isolation and research.\n\nHayflick is the recipient of more than twenty-five major awards including the $20,000 Brookdale Award and the Kleemeier Award from the Gerontological Society of America, the Biomedical Sciences and Aging Award from the University of Southern California, The Karl August Forster Lectureship of the Academy of Sciences and Literature and the University of Mainz, Germany, the Samuel Roberts Noble Foundation Research Recognition Award, the Lifetime Achievement Award of the Society for In Vitro Biology, the Sandoz Prize from the International Association of Gerontology, and the Presidential Award from The International Organization for Mycoplasmology. Hayflick, together with Paul Moorhead, were awarded the prestigious John Scott Award in 2014. This is the oldest scientific award in the United States, established in 1823 in honor of Benjamin Franklin.\n\nIn the mid-1990s, Hayflick was recruited by Geron founder Michael D. West to join the company's Scientific Advisory Board. In 1997, Hayflick was elected Academician and Foreign Member of the Ukrainian Academy of Medical Sciences. In 1998 he was elected corresponding member of the Société de Biologie of France. In 1999, he was presented with the van Weezel Award by the European Society for Animal Cell Technology and the Lord Cohen of Birkenhead Medal by the British Society for Research on Ageing. The American Aging Association established an Annual Hayflick Lectureship in 1997. A second Annual Hayflick Lecture was established by the University of Alabama at Birmingham in 2000. Hayflick was the recipient of the 2001, $10,000 Life Extension Prize and Laureate Diploma from the Regenerative Medicine Secretariat for his \"...discovery of the finite replicative capacity of normal human diploid cells...\" A third Annual Hayflick Lecture was established at the Friedrich Schiller University in 2013.\n\nHayflick is a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, an Honorary Member of the Tissue Culture Association and, according to the Institute of Scientific Information, is one of the most cited contemporary scientists in the world in the fields of biochemistry, biophysics, cell biology, enzymology, genetics and molecular biology. Hayflick is the author of over 275 scientific papers, book chapters and edited books of which four papers are among the 100 most cited scientific papers of the two million papers published in the basic biomedical sciences from 1961 to 1978.\n\nThe inverted microscope that Hayflick modified for use in his tissue culture and mycoplasma work and on which all other such microscopes have been modeled has been acquired by the Smithsonian National Museum of American History.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "895033", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=895033", "title": "Macular degeneration", "text": "Macular degeneration\n\nMacular degeneration, also known as age-related macular degeneration (AMD or ARMD), is a medical condition which may result in blurred or no vision in the center of the visual field. Early on there are often no symptoms. Over time, however, some people experience a gradual worsening of vision that may affect one or both eyes. While it does not result in complete blindness, loss of central vision can make it hard to recognize faces, drive, read, or perform other activities of daily life. Visual hallucinations may also occur and these do not represent a mental illness.\nMacular degeneration typically occurs in older people. Genetic factors and smoking also play a role. It is due to damage to the macula of the retina. Diagnosis is by a complete eye exam. The severity is divided into early, intermediate, and late types. The late type is additionally divided into \"dry\" and \"wet\" forms with the dry form making up 90% of cases.\nPreventive efforts include exercising, eating well, and not smoking. Antioxidant vitamins and minerals do not appear to be useful for prevention. There is no cure or treatment that returns vision already lost. In the wet form, anti-VEGF medication injected into the eye or less commonly laser coagulation or photodynamic therapy may slow worsening. Supplements in those who already have the disease may slow progression.\nIn 2015 it affected 6.2 million people globally. In 2013 it was the fourth most common cause of blindness after cataracts, preterm birth, and glaucoma. It most commonly occurs in people over the age of fifty and in the United States is the most common cause of vision loss in this age group. About 0.4% of people between 50 and 60 have the disease, while it occurs in 0.7% of people 60 to 70, 2.3% of those 70 to 80, and nearly 12% of people over 80 years old.\nSigns and symptoms of macular degeneration include:\n\nMacular degeneration by itself will not lead to total blindness. For that matter, only a small number of people with visual impairment are totally blind. In almost all cases, some vision remains, mainly peripheral. Other complicating conditions may lead to such an acute condition (severe stroke or trauma, untreated glaucoma, etc.), but few macular degeneration patients experience total visual loss.\n\nThe area of the macula comprises only about 2.1% of the retina, and the remaining 97.9% (the peripheral field) remains unaffected by the disease. Even though the macula provides such a small fraction of the visual field, almost half of the visual cortex is devoted to processing macular information.\n\nThe loss of central vision profoundly affects visual functioning. It is quite difficult, for example, to read without central vision. Pictures that attempt to depict the central visual loss of macular degeneration with a black spot do not do justice to the devastating nature of the visual loss. This can be demonstrated by printing letters six inches high on a piece of paper and attempting to identify them while looking straight ahead and holding the paper slightly to the side. Most people find this difficult to do.\n\nIn addition, people with dry macular degeneration often do not experience any symptoms but can experience gradual onset of blurry vision in one or both eyes. People with wet macular degeneration may experience acute onset of visual symptoms.\n\n\n\nRecurrence ratios for siblings of an affected individual are three- to sixfold higher than in the general population. Genetic linkage analysis has identified 5 sets of gene variants at three locations on different chromosomes (1, 6 and 10) as explaining at least 50% of the risk. These genes have roles regulating the immune response, inflammatory processes and homeostasis of the retina. Variants of these genes give rise to different kinds of dysfunction in these processes. Over time, this results in accumulation of intracellular and extracellular metabolic debris. This can cause scarring of the retina or breakdown of its vascularization.\n\nGenetic tests are available for some of these gene variations. However, pathogenesis of macular degeneration is a complex interaction between genetics, environment and lifestyle, and presence of unfavorable genetic factors doesn't necessarily predict progression to disease. The three loci where identified gene variants are found are designated:\n\n\nsuch as that in the MT-ND2 molecule, predicts wet AMD.\n\nThe pathogenesis of age-related macular degeneration is not well known, although some theories have been put forward, including oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and inflammatory processes.\n\nThe imbalance between the production of damaged cellular components and degradation leads to the accumulation of harmful products, for example, intracellular lipofuscin and extracellular drusen. Incipient atrophy is demarcated by areas of retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) thinning or depigmentation that precede geographic atrophy in the early stages of AMD. In advanced stages of AMD, atrophy of the RPE (geographic atrophy) and/or development of new blood vessels (neovascularization) result in the death of photoreceptors and central vision loss.\n\nIn the dry (nonexudative) form, cellular debris called drusen accumulates between the retina and the choroid, causing atrophy and scarring to the retina. In the wet (exudative) form, which is more severe, blood vessels grow up from the choroid (neovascularization) behind the retina which can leak exudate and fluid and also cause hemorrhaging.\n\nEarly work demonstrated a family of immune mediators was plentiful in drusen. Complement factor H (CFH) is an important inhibitor of this inflammatory cascade, and a disease-associated polymorphism in the CFH gene strongly associates with AMD. Thus an AMD pathophysiological model of chronic low grade complement activation and inflammation in the macula has been advanced. Lending credibility to this has been the discovery of disease-associated genetic polymorphisms in other elements of the complement cascade including complement component 3 (C3).\n\nA powerful predictor of AMD is found on chromosome \"10q26\" at LOC 387715. An insertion/deletion polymorphism at this site reduces expression of the \"ARMS2\" gene though destabilization of its mRNA through deletion of the polyadenylation signal. ARMS2 protein may localize to the mitochondria and participate in energy metabolism, though much remains to be discovered about its function.\n\nOther gene markers of progression risk includes tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 3 (TIMP3), suggesting a role for extracellular matrix metabolism in AMD progression. Variations in cholesterol metabolising genes such as the hepatic lipase, cholesterol ester transferase, lipoprotein lipase and the ATP-binding cassette A1 correlate with disease progression. The early stigmata of disease, drusen, are rich in cholesterol, offering face validity to the results of genome-wide association studies.\n\nIn AMD there is a progressive accumulation of characteristic yellow deposits, called drusen (buildup of extracellular proteins and lipids), in the macula (a part of the retina), between the retinal pigment epithelium and the underlying choroid which is believed to damage the retina over time. Amyloid beta, which builds up in Alzheimer's disease brains, is one of the proteins that accumulate in AMD, which is a reason why AMD is sometimes called \"Alzheimer's of the eye\" or \"Alzheimer's of the retina\".\nAMD can be divided into 3 stages: early, intermediate, and late, based partially on the extent (size and number) of drusen.\n\nAMD-like pathology begins with small yellow deposits (drusen) in the macula, between the retinal pigment epithelium and the underlying choroid. Most people with these early changes (referred to as age-related maculopathy) still have good vision. People with drusen may or may not develop AMD, in fact, the majority of people over age 60 have drusen with no adverse effects. The risk of developing symptoms is higher when the drusen are large and numerous and associated with the disturbance in the pigmented cell layer under the macula. Large and soft drusen are thought to be related to elevated cholesterol deposits.\n\nEarly AMD is diagnosed based on the presence of medium-sized drusen, about the width of an average human hair. Early AMD is usually asymptomatic.\n\nIntermediate AMD is diagnosed by large drusen and/or any retinal pigment abnormalities. Intermediate AMD may cause some vision loss, but, like early AMD, it is usually asymptomatic.\n\nIn late AMD, enough retinal damage occurs that people have symptomatic central vision loss in addition to drusen. The damage can either be the development of atrophy or the onset of neovascular disease. Late AMD is further divided into two subtypes based on the types of damage: Geographic atrophy and Wet AMD (also called Neovascular AMD).\n\nDry AMD (also called nonexudative AMD) is a broad designation, encompassing all forms of AMD that are not neovascular (wet AMD). This includes early and intermediate forms of AMD, as well as the advanced form of dry AMD known as geographic atrophy. Dry AMD patients tend to have minimal symptoms in the earlier stages; visual function loss occurs more often if the condition advances to geographic atrophy. Dry AMD accounts for 80–90% of cases and tends to progress slowly. In 10–20% of people, dry AMD progresses to the wet type.\n\nGeographic atrophy (also called atrophic AMD) is an advanced form of AMD in which progressive and irreversible loss of retinal cells leads to a loss of visual function.\n\nNeovascular or exudative AMD, the \"wet\" form of advanced AMD, causes vision loss due to abnormal blood vessel growth (choroidal neovascularization) in the choriocapillaris, through Bruch's membrane. It is usually, but not always, preceded by the dry form of AMD. The proliferation of abnormal blood vessels in the retina is stimulated by vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Unfortunately, because these blood vessels are abnormal, these new vessels are fragile, ultimately leading to blood and protein leakage below the macula. Bleeding, leaking, and scarring from these blood vessels eventually cause irreversible damage to the photoreceptors and rapid vision loss if left untreated.\n\nAge-related accumulation of low-molecular-weight, phototoxic, pro-oxidant melanin oligomers within lysosomes in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) may be partly responsible for decreasing the digestive rate of photoreceptor outer rod segments (POS) by the RPE – autophagy. A decrease in the digestive rate of POS has been shown to be associated with lipofuscin formation – a classic sign associated with AMD.\n\nThe role of retinal oxidative stress in the cause of AMD by resulting in further inflammation of the macula is suggested by the enhanced rate of disease in smokers and those exposed to UV irradiation.\n\nMitochondrial dysfunction may play a role.\n\nDiagnosis of age-related macular degeneration depends on signs in the macula, not necessarily vision. Wet AMD is typically the advanced progression of dry AMD and will require additional diagnostic tools. Additionally, early diagnosis of wet AMD can prevent further visual deterioration and potentially improve vision.\n\nDiagnosis of dry (or early stage) AMD may include the following clinical examinations as well as procedures and tests:\n\n\nDiagnosis of wet (or late stage) AMD may include the following in addition to the above tests:\n\n\n\nA 2017 Cochrane review found the use of vitamin and mineral supplements, alone or in combination, by the general population did not affect whether or not AMD started.\n\nTreatment of AMD varies depending on the category of the disease at the time of diagnosis. In general, treatment is aimed at slowing down the progression of AMD. As of 2018, there are no treatments to reverse the effects of AMD. Early-stage and intermediate-stage AMD is managed by modifying known risk factors such as smoking and atherosclerosis and making dietary modifications. For intermediate-stage AMD, management also includes antioxidant and mineral supplementation. Advanced-stage AMD is managed based on the presence of choroidal neovascularization (CNV): dry AMD (no CNV present) or wet AMD (CNV present). No effective treatments exist for dry AMD. The CNV present in wet AMD is managed with vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitors.\n\nNo medical or surgical treatment is available for this condition.\n\nRanibizumab and aflibercept are approved VEGF inhibitors for the treatment of CNV in wet AMD. Bevacizumab is another VEGF inhibitor that has been shown to have similar efficacy and safety as the previous two drugs, however, is not currently indicated for AMD. AMD can also be treated with laser coagulation therapy.\n\nA randomized control trial found that bevacizumab and ranibizumab had similar efficacy, and reported no significant increase in adverse events with bevacizumab. A 2014 Cochrane review found that the systemic safety of bevacizumab and ranibizumab are similar when used to treat neovascular AMD, except for gastrointestinal disorders. Bevacizumab however is not FDA approved for treatment of macular degeneration. A controversy in the UK involved the off-label use of cheaper bevacizumab over the approved, but expensive, ranibizumab. Ranibizumab is a smaller fragment, Fab fragment, of the parent bevacizumab molecule specifically designed for eye injections. Other approved antiangiogenic drugs for the treatment of neo-vascular AMD include pegaptanib and aflibercept.\n\nThe American Academy of Ophthalmology practice guidelines do not recommend laser coagulation therapy for macular degeneration, but state that it may be useful in people with new blood vessels in the choroid outside of the fovea who don't respond to drug treatment. There is strong evidence that laser coagulation will result in the disappearance of drusen but does not affect choroidal neovascularisation. A 2007 Cochrane review on found that laser photocoagulation of new blood vessels in the choroid outside of the fovea is effective and economical method, but that the benefits are limited for vessels next to or below the fovea.\n\nPhotodynamic therapy has also been used to treat wet AMD. The drug verteporfin is administered intravenously; light of a certain wavelength is then applied to the abnormal blood vessels. This activates the verteporfin destroying the vessels.\n\nCataract surgery could improve visual outcomes for people with AMD, though there have been concerns about surgery increasing the progression of AMD. A randomized controlled trial found that people who underwent immediate cataract surgery (within two weeks) had improved visual acuity and better quality of life outcomes than those who underwent delayed cataract surgery (6 months).\n\nBecause peripheral vision is not affected, people with macular degeneration can learn to use their remaining vision to partially compensate. Assistance and resources are available in many countries and every state in the U.S. Classes for \"independent living\" are given and some technology can be obtained from a state department of rehabilitation.\n\nAdaptive devices can help people read. These include magnifying glasses, special eyeglass lenses, computer screen readers, and TV systems that enlarge reading the material.\n\nComputer screen readers such as JAWS or Thunder work with standard Windows computers.\nAlso, Apple devices provide a wide range of features (voice-over, screen readers, Braille etc.\n\nVideo cameras can be fed into standard or special-purpose computer monitors, and the image can be zoomed in and magnified. These systems often include a movable table to move the written material.\n\nAccessible publishing provides larger fonts for printed books, patterns to make tracking easier, audiobooks and DAISY books with both text and audio.\n\nThe prevalence any age-related macular degeneration is higher in Europeans than in Asians and Africans. There is no difference in prevalence between Asians and Africans. The incidence of age-related macular degeneration and its associated features increases with age and is low in people <55 years of age. Smoking is the strongest modifiable risk factor. Age-related macular degeneration accounts for more than 54% of all vision loss in the white population in the USA. An estimated 8 million Americans are affected with early age-related macular degeneration, of whom over 1 million will develop advanced age-related macular degeneration within the next 5 years. In the UK, age-related macular degeneration is the cause of blindness in almost 42% of those who go blind aged 65–74 years, almost two-thirds of those aged 75–84 years, and almost three-quarters of those aged 85 years or older.\n\nStudies indicate drusen associated with AMD are similar in molecular composition to Beta-Amyloid (βA) plaques and deposits in other age-related diseases such as Alzheimer's disease and atherosclerosis. This suggests that similar pathways may be involved in the etiologies of AMD and other age-related diseases.\n\nA practical application of AMD-associated genetic markers is in the prediction of progression of AMD from early stages of the disease to neovascularization.\n\nCell based therapies using bone marrow stem cells as well as retinal pigment epithelial transplantation are being studied. A number of trials have occurred in humans with encouraging results.\n\nThere are a few other (rare) kinds of macular degeneration with similar symptoms but unrelated in etiology to Wet or Dry age-related macular degeneration. They are all genetic disorders that may occur in childhood or middle age.\nSimilar symptoms with a very different etiology and different treatment can be caused by epiretinal membrane or macular pucker or any other condition affecting the macula, such as central serous retinopathy.\n\n\n\n"}

The MMU allowed the astronauts to perform untethered EVA spacewalks at a distance from the shuttle. The MMU was used in practice to retrieve a pair of faulty communications satellites, Westar VI and Palapa B2. Following the third mission the unit was retired from use. A smaller successor, the Simplified Aid For EVA Rescue (SAFER), was first flown in 1994, and is intended for emergency use only.\n\nThe unit featured redundancy to protect against failure of individual systems. It was designed to fit over the life-support system backpack of the Space Shuttle Extravehicular Mobility Unit (EMU). When carried into space, the MMU was stowed in a support station attached to the wall of the payload bay near the airlock hatch. Two MMUs were carried on a mission, with the second unit mounted across from the first on the opposite payload bay wall. The MMU controller arms were folded for storage. When an astronaut backed into the unit and snapped the life-support system into place, the arms were unfolded.\n\nTo adapt to astronauts with different arm lengths, controller arms could be adjusted over a range of approximately 13 centimetres. The MMU was small enough to be maneuvered with ease around and within complex structures. With a full propellant load, its mass was 148 kilograms (326 pounds).\n\nGaseous nitrogen was used as the propellant for the MMU. Two aluminium tanks with Kevlar wrappings contained 5.9 kilograms of nitrogen each, enough propellant for a six-hour EVA depending on the amount of maneuvering done. Typical MMU velocity capability was about 80 feet per second (25 m/s).\n\nThere were 24 nozzle thrusters placed at different locations on the MMU. To operate the propulsion system, the astronaut used his fingertips to manipulate hand controllers at the ends of the MMU's two arms. The right controller produced rotational acceleration for roll, pitch, and yaw. The left controller produced translational acceleration for moving forward-back, up-down, and left-right. Coordination of the two controllers produced intricate movements in the unit. Once a desired orientation was achieved, the astronaut could engage an automatic attitude-hold function that maintained the inertial attitude of the unit in flight. This freed both hands for work.\n\nIn 1966, the US Air Force developed an Astronaut Maneuvering Unit (AMU), a self-contained rocket pack very similar to the MMU. This was planned to be tested during Project Gemini on an EVA by Eugene Cernan on Gemini 9A on June 5, 1966. However, the test had to be cancelled because Cernan, tired and overheated, sweated so profusely that his helmet visor fogged before he could get to the AMU mounted on the back of the spacecraft. Astronauts did not learn how to work during EVA without tiring until the final Gemini 12 mission, but no AMU was carried on that flight. Since there was no real need for self-contained astronaut EVA flight in the Apollo and Skylab programs, the idea had to wait for the advent of the Space Shuttle program, though several maneuvering device designs were tested inside Skylab.\n\nThe MMU was used on three Shuttle missions in 1984. It was first tested on February 7 during mission STS-41-B by astronauts Bruce McCandless II and Robert L. Stewart. Two months later during mission STS-41-C, astronauts James van Hoften and George Nelson attempted to use the MMU to capture the Solar Maximum Mission satellite and to bring it into the orbiter's payload bay for repairs and servicing. The plan was to use an astronaut-piloted MMU to grapple the SMM with the Trunion Pin Attachment Device (TPAD) mounted between the hand controllers of the MMU, null its rotation rates, and allow the Shuttle to bring it into the Shuttle's payload bay for stowage. Three attempts to grapple the satellite using the TPAD failed. The TPAD jaws could not lock onto Solar Max because of an obstructing grommet on the satellite not included in the blueprints for the satellite. This led to an improvised plan which nearly ended the satellite's mission. The improvisation had the MMU astronaut use his hands to grab hold of an SMM solar array and null the rates by a push from MMU's thrusters. Instead, this attempt induced higher rates and in multiple axes; the satellite was tumbling out of control and quickly losing battery life. SMM Operations Control Center engineers shut down all non-essential SMM subsystems and with a bit of luck were able to recover the SMM minutes before total failure. The ground support engineers then stabilized the satellite and nulled its rotation rates for capture with the orbiter's robotic arm, the Shuttle Remote Manipulator System (SRMS). This proved to be a much better plan. Their successful work increased the lifespan of the satellite.\n\nThe final MMU mission was STS-51-A, which flew in November 1984. The propulsion unit was used to retrieve two communication satellites, Westar VI and Palapa B2, that did not reach their proper orbits because of faulty propulsion modules. Astronauts Joseph P. Allen and Dale Gardner captured the two satellites and brought them into the Orbiter payload bay for stowage and return to Earth.\n\nAfter a safety review following the Space Shuttle \"Challenger\" disaster, the MMU was judged too risky for further use and it was found many activities planned for the MMU could be done effectively with manipulator arms or traditional tethered EVAs. NASA also discontinued using the Shuttle for commercial satellite contracts, and the military discontinued the use of the Shuttle, eliminating the main potential uses. Although the MMU was envisioned as a natural aid for constructing the International Space Station, with its retirement, NASA developed different tethered spacewalk approaches.\n\nThe two operational, flown flight units MMU #2 and #3 were stored by NASA in a clean room at Lockheed in Denver through 1998. NASA transferred flight article #3 to the National Air and Space Museum in 1998, which now hangs suspended in the hall above the Space Shuttle Discovery. Flight article #2 is on display at the U.S. Space & Rocket Center in Huntsville, Alabama. As of 2017, MMU #1 is on display in the Space Vehicle Mockup Facility at Johnson Space Center.\n\n\n"}

He was sent to Ljubljana for primary and secondary schooling and then studied philosophy at the lyceums of Ljubljana and Vienna for three years. In 1817, he returned from Vienna and attended a priest seminary until 1820, when he left it to become a secondary school teacher in Rijeka, Croatia. In 1822 he moved to Lvov (then also part of the Austrian Empire), when he started working as a teacher at the local lyceum, but was soon promoted to assistant professor at Lviv University.\n\nIn 1827 he returned to Ljubljana, when he was offered a job as a secondary school teacher again. In 1828, he accepted the post of librarian at the Lyceum, which he held full-time after 1831.\n\nDuring his time in Ljubljana, be became a close friend of the poet France Prešeren. He served as his tutor, providing him with information on contemporary developments in European literature.\n\nIn 1835, at age 38, Čop drowned while swimming in the Sava River. Prešeren dedicated his major poem \"The Baptism on the Savica\" to his late friend.\n\nWith his command of 19 languages (including Albanian), Čop was perhaps the most erudite Slovene of his time. Although he did not publish much original work during his lifetime, Čop had a great influence on the later development of Slovene culture. Unlike such contemporaries as the linguist Jernej Kopitar and the poet Stanko Vraz, Čop believed in the possibility of the development of a distinctive Slovenian national culture. He can thus be seen as the predecessor of the Slovenian national awakening in the second part of the 19th century. His broad cosmopolitan education enabled him to recognise the poetic talent of France Prešeren, which remained unnoticed by most of his contemporaries, and to advise him on stylistic and linguistic issues.\n\nToday, Čop is generally regarded as one of the most important Slovenian intellectuals of the 19th century. Several streets, schools and other institutions throughout Slovenia bear his name, among them the fashionable Čop Street in Ljubljana.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1417732", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1417732", "title": "Murder of Jodi Jones", "text": "Murder of Jodi Jones\n\nThe murder of Jodi Jones, a 14-year-old girl, took place in Easthouses, Scotland on 30 June 2003. Her 15-year-old boyfriend, Luke Mitchell, came under suspicion, but it was several months before he was arrested. Mitchell was tried for the murder and after Scotland's longest single-accused trial, Mitchell was convicted in January 2005. He was sentenced to detention without limit of time with a minimum of 20 years even though there was no DNA evidence.\n\nMitchell's parents separated when he was 11, and he was brought up in relatively comfortable circumstances with hobbies that included riding horses and motorbikes. Mitchell went to St. David's RC High School in Dalkeith. He was in the same year as Jones and supplied her and his circle of friends with cannabis on the school premises. Around March 2003 when both Mitchell and Jones were 14 years old, Mitchell became her first serious boyfriend, and began having sex with her. Unknown to Jones, Mitchell was also intimate with another girl at the time. Mitchell was a good pupil, but a teacher became concerned about the violence in an essay he had written. In the weeks before she was murdered, Jones's social life, which largely revolved around Mitchell, was curtailed by her mother. At about 5pm on 30 June 2003 Jones went out, saying she was going to see Mitchell. Her body was found several hours later; she had been murdered in a \"savage knife attack\".\n\nThe body was behind a high wall in a wooded area. Mitchell found it at around 10.30pm, while he was with members of Jones's family who were out searching for her. The circumstances in which Mitchell was able to find the body were later alleged by prosecutors to indicate his guilty knowledge. The Jones family made it known that Mitchell was not welcome at the funeral. School authorities cited concern about Mitchell's safety in unsuccessfully attempting to prevent his return to school; two months after the murder he was suspended after objecting to being separated from other pupils.\n\nAfter his discovery of the body, Mitchell was initially questioned as a witness; he quickly became the main focus of the investigation. There had been media speculation that he was the sole suspect, and 10 months later Mitchell was arrested and charged with the crime.\n\nAt his trial at the High Court of Justiciary in Edinburgh, Mitchell pleaded not guilty and lodged a special defence of alibi: that he was at home cooking dinner at the time of the murder. He did not testify at his trial, which was the longest and most expensive of a single accused in Scottish legal history.\n\nThe main plank of the case against him was an attribution of \"guilty knowledge\"; in finding the body, the prosecution said Mitchell had demonstrated that he already knew where it was. Prosecutors also said that a witness had seen someone resembling Mitchell at the scene, and they accused Mitchell of giving a false alibi. Mitchell's brother testified he had been viewing internet pornography in the house at the time Mitchell said he had been there; under cross examination Mitchell's brother said he would only have done this if he thought the house to be otherwise empty. Mitchell's brother said he had not seen Mitchell in the house that afternoon, thereby failing to corroborate his defence of being in the family home at the time of the murder.\n\nThe prosecution said Mitchell had taken an interest in the Black Dahlia case, a 1947 homicide of a young woman whose body was severely mutilated in a way that the Crown alleged was similar to injuries suffered by Jones. A knife pouch was also found in Mitchell's possession on which he had marked \"JJ 1989 – 2003\" and \"The finest day I ever had was when tomorrow never came\". The prosecution said it would be unlikely for anyone but the killer to remember someone killed with a knife in this way. According to the prosecution, Mitchell's clothes may have been destroyed in a garden incinerator which some neighbours thought was giving off a strange smell. No forensic evidence was recovered from the incinerator, which was an 11\" diameter log burner.\n\nIn response to the prosecution accusation that only prior knowledge could have explained the way Mitchell was able to discover the body lying behind a wall, lawyers for Mitchell said had been aided by his dog. To allow the jury to explore the plausibility of these claims, a mock-up wall was erected in the Laigh Hall, below Parliament Hall within Parliament House, across the road from the High Court of Justiciary building in Edinburgh's Old Town, where the trial was being heard. A visit by the jury to the murder scene was also arranged. Mitchell maintained his alibi, that he had been at home at the time of the murder.\n\nOn 21 January 2005, the jury found him guilty after five hours of deliberation. Mitchell, aged sixteen at the time of his conviction, was condemned as being \"truly wicked\" by Judge Lord Nimmo Smith. He was also found guilty of a separate charge of supplying cannabis.\n\nMitchell's sentencing took place on 11 February 2005. Nimmo Smith told Mitchell that he would spend a minimum of 20 years in prison before being considered for parole.\n\nIn March 2006, Mitchell was granted leave to appeal against his conviction (and his length of sentence) at the High Court of Justiciary sitting as the Court of Criminal Appeal in Edinburgh, on the grounds that the trial judge should have moved the trial outside the city. The Court of Criminal Appeal in Edinburgh heard Mitchell's appeal in February 2008, and in May 2008 his original conviction was upheld by Lord Osborne, Lord Kingarth and Lord Hamilton. They ruled that there was sufficient evidence in law that Mitchell could be convicted on and rejected his other grounds of appeal, although they stated that the way police had questioned Mitchell on 14 August 2003 had been \"outrageous\" and was \"to be deplored.\"\n\nOn 2 February 2011, Mitchell's appeal against sentence was refused by a two to one majority. Lord Justice Clerk, Lord Gill, sitting with Lord Hardie and Lady Cosgrove stated that he had the utmost sympathy for the family of the victim and that he understood entirely why this murder should have caused such public revulsion. Nevertheless, he was of the opinion that the sentencing judge should not have imposed a punishment part of such severity on such a young offender. He stated that justice would be done in this case if the punishment part of the sentence were fixed at 15 years. He did not consider that they were precluded from that disposal by anything said in the guidance given in HM Adv v Boyle and Ors (supra). He regretted, therefore, that he had to differ from his Lordship and her Ladyship.\n\nOn 15 April 2011, Mitchell's bid to challenge his conviction for murder following a human rights ruling by the Supreme Court in the Cadder case was rejected. His lawyer told the Appeal Court in Edinburgh that his trial was unfair because he had no access to a lawyer during an interview. Lord Osborne sitting with Lord Hamilton (Lord Justice General) and Lord Kingarth told Mitchell that the application for leave to lodge the additional ground was refused. The appellant's appeal against sentence was finally disposed of on 2 February 2011 and in such circumstances there did not exist a live appeal in respect of which leave could be granted under section 110(4).\n\nIn November 2011 Mitchell was refused leave to take his appeal to the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom, on the basis that his previous appeal had been dealt with before the Cadder ruling and could therefore not be re-opened.\n\nIn May 2007, a BBC Scotland \"Frontline Scotland\" documentary special on BBC One explored a theory – not followed up by police during the initial investigation – that the murder may have been committed not by Mitchell, but by a student and heavy drug user who was alleged to have handed in an essay about killing a girl in the woods a few weeks before the murder. A friend of this suspect saw him soon after the murder and claimed that he was heavily scratched about the face. The documentary also challenged the theory that Mitchell was an obsessive Marilyn Manson fan and had a keen interest in the Black Dahlia murder. The documentary stated that there is no evidence that Mitchell knew of the Dahlia case until after the murder. In the documentary Professor Anthony Busuttil, when asked about the similarities between Jones's and Short's injuries said, \"there were major dissimilarities.\" The Jones family were reported in the \"Daily Record\" to be \"outraged\" at the programme, though the newspaper stated that none of them had watched it.\n\nOn 20 July 2012, lawyers acting for Mitchell launch a fresh bid to have his conviction overturned when a 300-page dossier was hand delivered to the Scottish Criminal Cases Review Commission (SCCRC). The dossier included claims that a Mitchell lookalike may have confused eyewitnesses. The lawyers, including at least one senior legal figure, are said to be so concerned by Mitchell's conviction, which relied on an entirely circumstantial case, that they donated their services free of charge.\n\nIn July 2014, the SCCRC revealed that police officers breached Luke Mitchell's human rights when they questioned him over the murder of his teenage girlfriend Jodi Jones. However, they determined he was not the victim of a miscarriage of justice. The SCCRC report made it clear that, despite Mitchell’s claims that he was innocent, there are no grounds to challenge the guilty verdict. Chief executive Gerard Sinclair wrote: 'The Scottish Criminal Cases Review Commission has now completed its inquiries into whether or not a miscarriage of justice may have occurred in respect of Mr Luke Muir Mitchell’s conviction and sentence. The Commission has decided not to refer Mr Mitchell’s case to the High Court. Immediately following the decision by the SCCRC, it was announced that Mitchell would take his case to the European Courts although the competency of such a move is questionable since the ECHR has a strict six-month deadline for applications pursuant to the case being heard by the domestic court.\n\n"}

Close PnuC homologues are found in a wide range of Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes.\n\nPnuC of \"Salmonella typhimurium\" and \"Haemophilus influenzae\" are believed to function cooperatively with NadR homologues, multifunctional proteins that together with PnuC, participate in NR phosphorylation, transport and transcriptional regulation. NadR, a cytoplasmic protein that is partly membrane associated, contains one well conserved and one poorly conserved mononucleotide-binding consensus sequence (G-X4 GKS). It drives transport and may render transport responsive to internal pyridine nucleotide levels. While its N-terminal half functions as a repressor, its C-terminal half functions as an NR kinase in a putative group translocation process.\n\nThe \"H. influenzae\" homologue has been shown to transport NR from the periplasm into the cytoplasm. Phosphorylation of NR by NadR is required for NR uptake. The ribonucleoside kinase (RNK) domain has both Walker A and Walker B motifs, responsible for ATP binding and phosphoryl transfer. In addition, a proposed LID domain was identified in RNK. LID domains have been found in other kinases, and these domains are regions which are able to move after substrate binding. They are responsible for coordination of three distinct conformations, an open state in the absence of substrate, a partially closed state after substrate binding, and a fully closed state when both substrates are present.\n\nIn \"H. influenzae\", NR enters the NAD resynthesis pathway after phosphorylation to NMN, and subsequently, NAD is synthesized from NMN and ATP via an NMN adenylyl transferase activity. NadR represents a multifunctional regulator/enzyme complex able to integrate several functions, such as enzymatic catalysis, transport, and transcriptional regulatory activities.\n\nThe components of the \"H. influenzae\" pathway necessary for NAD, NMN, and NR uptake have been determined. Merdanovic et al. characterized two enzymes, an outer membrane nucleotide phosphatase, and an NAD nucleotidase (NadN) located in the periplasm. They showed that NAD and NMN cross the outer membrane mainly via the OmpP2 porin.\n\nOnly NR can be utilized by the PnuC transport system located in the inner membrane. The \"pnuC\" gene product is the protein that is responsible for the main flow of the NR substrate into the cytoplasm. The study of Merdanovic et al. suggests that the RNK activity of NadR determines NR transport and is negatively regulated by cytoplasmic NAD feedback inhibition. Therefore, NR uptake is under NadR feedback control.\n\nATP, not the proton motive force, appears to be required for NR uptake. Thus, the driving force for NR uptake via PnuC is NR phosphorylation by NadR. A concerted group translocation mechanism can be considered whereby NadR facilitates the dissociation of NR from PnuC by phosphorylating it to NMN, thus preventing efflux of NR.\n\nThe proposed transport reaction catalyzed by PnuC and NadR is:\n\nNR (out) + ATP (in) → NMN (in) + ADP (in).\n\nPnuC of \"Salmonella typhimurium\" and \"Haemophilus influenzae\" are integral membrane proteins, 239 and 226 amino acyl residues (aas) in length, respectively, with 7 putative transmembrane α-helical segments.\n\nThe structure of NadR has been determined. Mutations in the \"nadR\" gene which interfere with NR uptake occur in the C-terminal part of NadR. A helix-turn-helix DNA binding domain present in NadR of \"S. enterica serovar Typhimurium\" could not be found in the NadR homologue of \"H. influenzae\". Therefore, it was proposed that in \"H. influenzae\" NadR has no regulatory function at the transcriptional level. The structures of the human NR kinase 1 (2QL6_P) with nucleotide and nucleoside substrates bound have been solved. It is structurally similar to Rossmann fold metabolite kinases.\n\nPnuC has been shown to resemble SWEET porters in overall fold, supporting the conclusion that these two families are members of the TOG superfamily.\n\nNadR Protein from \"H. influenzae\" \n\nNR transporter PnuC \n"}

It is not a form of euthanasia, as the goal of palliative sedation is to control symptoms, rather than to shorten the patient's life.\n\nAccording to 2009 research, 16.5% of all deaths in the United Kingdom during 2007–2008 took place after continuous deep sedation.\n\nOn the other hand, a 2009 survey of almost 4000 U.K. patients whose care had followed the Liverpool Care Pathway for the dying patient found that while 31% had received low doses of medication to control distress from agitation or restlessness, only 4% had required higher doses.\n\nPalliative sedation is often initiated at the patient's request. It can also be initiated by the physician who would discuss the option with the patient and family. Palliative sedation can be used for short periods with the plan to awaken the patient after a given time period, making terminal sedation a less correct term. The patient is sedated while symptom control is attempted, then the patient is awakened to see if symptom control is achieved. In some cases, palliative sedation is begun with the plan to not attempt to reawaken the patient.\n\nOne such common example is a patient with an enlarging cancer in the throat that compresses the trachea in a patient who does not want intubation or a tracheostomy, so that eventually symptom control is impossible. Instead of experiencing death by suffocation, once symptoms are intolerable some patients will request palliative sedation to ease their symptoms as death approaches.\n\nA typical drug is midazolam, a short acting benzodiazepine. Opioids such as morphine are not used as the primary medicine since they are not effective sedative medications compared to benzodiazepines. However, if a patient was already on an opioid for pain relief, this is continued for pain relief while sedation is achieved. Other medications to be considered include haloperidol, chlorpromazine, pentobarbital, or propofol.\n\nWhile the intent of palliative sedation is to eliminate pain and suffering, a significant minority of patients \"continue to experience pain, dysphoria, or nausea\".\n\nAs patients undergoing terminal sedation are typically in the last hours or days of their lives, they are not usually eating or drinking significant amounts. There have not been any conclusive studies to demonstrate benefit to initiating artificial nutrition (TPN, tube feedings, etc.) or artificial hydration (subcutaneous or intravenous fluids). There is also a risk that IV fluids or feedings can worsen symptoms, especially respiratory secretions and pulmonary congestion. If the goal of palliative sedation is comfort, IV fluids and feedings are often not consistent with this goal.\n\nA specialized rectal catheter can provide an immediate way to administer small volumes of liquids for patients in the home setting when the oral route is compromised. Unlike intravenous lines, which usually need to be placed in an inpatient environment, the rectal catheter can be placed by a clinician, such as a hospice nurse or home health nurse, in the home. This is useful for patients who cannot swallow, including those near the end of life (an estimated 1.65 million people are in hospice care in the US each year).\n\nBefore initiating terminal sedation, a discussion about the risks, benefits and goals of nutrition and fluids is encouraged, and is mandatory in the United Kingdom.\n\nTitrated sedation might speed death but death is considered a side effect and sedation does not equate with euthanasia.\n\nAt the end of life sedation is only used if the patient perceives their distress to be unbearable, and there are no other means of relieving that distress. In palliative care the doses of sedatives are titrated (i.e., varied) to keep the patient comfortable without compromising respiration or hastening death. Death results from the underlying medical condition. For more information on the palliative care use of sedatives and the safe use of opioids see Opioids.\n\nPatients (or their legal representatives) only have the right to refuse treatments in living wills; they cannot demand life saving treatments, or any treatments at all. However, once unconsciousness begins, as the patient is no longer able to decide to stop the sedation or to request food or water, the clinical team can make decisions for a patient. A Living Will, made when competent, can, under UK law, give a directive that the patient refuses 'Palliative Care' or 'Terminal Sedation', or 'any drug likely to suppress my respiration'.\n\nIn 2008, the American Medical Association Council on Ethical and Judicial Affairs approved an ethical policy regarding the practice of palliative sedation.\n\nIn October 2010 Svenska Läkaresällskapets, an association of physicians in Sweden, published guidelines which allowed for palliative sedation to be administered even with the intent of the patient not to reawaken.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "126706", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=126706", "title": "Pattern recognition", "text": "Pattern recognition\n\nPattern recognition is the automated recognition of patterns and regularities in data. Pattern recognition is closely related to artificial intelligence and machine learning, together with applications such as data mining and knowledge discovery in databases (KDD), and is often used interchangeably with these terms. However, these are distinguished: machine learning is one approach to pattern recognition, while other approaches include hand-crafted (not learned) rules or heuristics; and pattern recognition is one approach to artificial intelligence, while other approaches include symbolic artificial intelligence. A modern definition of pattern recognition is:\nThis article focuses on machine learning approaches to pattern recognition. Pattern recognition systems are in many cases trained from labeled \"training\" data (supervised learning), but when no labeled data are available other algorithms can be used to discover previously unknown patterns (unsupervised learning). Machine learning is the common term for supervised learning methods and originates from artificial intelligence, whereas KDD and data mining have a larger focus on unsupervised methods and stronger connection to business use. Pattern recognition has its origins in engineering, and the term is popular in the context of computer vision: a leading computer vision conference is named Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition. In pattern recognition, there may be a higher interest to formalize, explain and visualize the pattern, while machine learning traditionally focuses on maximizing the recognition rates. Yet, all of these domains have evolved substantially from their roots in artificial intelligence, engineering and statistics, and they've become increasingly similar by integrating developments and ideas from each other.\n\nIn machine learning, pattern recognition is the assignment of a label to a given input value. In statistics, discriminant analysis was introduced for this same purpose in 1936. An example of pattern recognition is classification, which attempts to assign each input value to one of a given set of \"classes\" (for example, determine whether a given email is \"spam\" or \"non-spam\"). However, pattern recognition is a more general problem that encompasses other types of output as well. Other examples are regression, which assigns a real-valued output to each input; sequence labeling, which assigns a class to each member of a sequence of values (for example, part of speech tagging, which assigns a part of speech to each word in an input sentence); and parsing, which assigns a parse tree to an input sentence, describing the syntactic structure of the sentence.\n\nPattern recognition algorithms generally aim to provide a reasonable answer for all possible inputs and to perform \"most likely\" matching of the inputs, taking into account their statistical variation. This is opposed to \"pattern matching\" algorithms, which look for exact matches in the input with pre-existing patterns. A common example of a pattern-matching algorithm is regular expression matching, which looks for patterns of a given sort in textual data and is included in the search capabilities of many text editors and word processors. In contrast to pattern recognition, pattern matching is not generally a type of machine learning, although pattern-matching algorithms (especially with fairly general, carefully tailored patterns) can sometimes succeed in providing similar-quality output of the sort provided by pattern-recognition algorithms.\n\nPattern recognition is generally categorized according to the type of learning procedure used to generate the output value. \"Supervised learning\" assumes that a set of \"training data\" (the \"training set\") has been provided, consisting of a set of instances that have been properly labeled by hand with the correct output. Training patterns are the goals of the training process and not to be confused with the training set. A learning procedure then generates a \"model\" that attempts to meet two sometimes conflicting objectives: Perform as well as possible on the training data, and generalize as well as possible to new data (usually, this means being as simple as possible, for some technical definition of \"simple\", in accordance with Occam's Razor, discussed below). Unsupervised learning, on the other hand, assumes training data that has not been hand-labeled, and attempts to find inherent patterns in the data that can then be used to determine the correct output value for new data instances. A combination of the two that has recently been explored is semi-supervised learning, which uses a combination of labeled and unlabeled data (typically a small set of labeled data combined with a large amount of unlabeled data). Note that in cases of unsupervised learning, there may be no training data at all to speak of; in other words,and the data to be labeled \"is\" the training data.\n\nNote that sometimes different terms are used to describe the corresponding supervised and unsupervised learning procedures for the same type of output. For example, the unsupervised equivalent of classification is normally known as \"clustering\", based on the common perception of the task as involving no training data to speak of, and of grouping the input data into \"clusters\" based on some inherent similarity measure (e.g. the distance between instances, considered as vectors in a multi-dimensional vector space), rather than assigning each input instance into one of a set of pre-defined classes. Note also that in some fields, the terminology is different: For example, in community ecology, the term \"classification\" is used to refer to what is commonly known as \"clustering\".\n\nThe piece of input data for which an output value is generated is formally termed an \"instance\". The instance is formally described by a vector of \"features\", which together constitute a description of all known characteristics of the instance. (These feature vectors can be seen as defining points in an appropriate multidimensional space, and methods for manipulating vectors in vector spaces can be correspondingly applied to them, such as computing the dot product or the angle between two vectors.) Typically, features are either categorical (also known as nominal, i.e., consisting of one of a set of unordered items, such as a gender of \"male\" or \"female\", or a blood type of \"A\", \"B\", \"AB\" or \"O\"), ordinal (consisting of one of a set of ordered items, e.g., \"large\", \"medium\" or \"small\"), integer-valued (e.g., a count of the number of occurrences of a particular word in an email) or real-valued (e.g., a measurement of blood pressure). Often, categorical and ordinal data are grouped together; likewise for integer-valued and real-valued data. Furthermore, many algorithms work only in terms of categorical data and require that real-valued or integer-valued data be \"discretized\" into groups (e.g., less than 5, between 5 and 10, or greater than 10).\n\nMany common pattern recognition algorithms are \"probabilistic\" in nature, in that they use statistical inference to find the best label for a given instance. Unlike other algorithms, which simply output a \"best\" label, often probabilistic algorithms also output a probability of the instance being described by the given label. In addition, many probabilistic algorithms output a list of the \"N\"-best labels with associated probabilities, for some value of \"N\", instead of simply a single best label. When the number of possible labels is fairly small (e.g., in the case of classification), \"N\" may be set so that the probability of all possible labels is output. Probabilistic algorithms have many advantages over non-probabilistic algorithms:\n\nFeature selection algorithms attempt to directly prune out redundant or irrelevant features. A general introduction to feature selection which summarizes approaches and challenges, has been given. The complexity of feature-selection is, because of its non-monotonous character, an optimization problem where given a total of formula_1 features the powerset consisting of all formula_2 subsets of features need to be explored. The Branch-and-Bound algorithm does reduce this complexity but is intractable for medium to large values of the number of available features formula_1. For a large-scale comparison of feature-selection algorithms see \n\nTechniques to transform the raw feature vectors (feature extraction) are sometimes used prior to application of the pattern-matching algorithm. For example, feature extraction algorithms attempt to reduce a large-dimensionality feature vector into a smaller-dimensionality vector that is easier to work with and encodes less redundancy, using mathematical techniques such as principal components analysis (PCA). The distinction between feature selection and feature extraction is that the resulting features after feature extraction has taken place are of a different sort than the original features and may not easily be interpretable, while the features left after feature selection are simply a subset of the original features.\n\nFormally, the problem of supervised pattern recognition can be stated as follows: Given an unknown function formula_4 (the \"ground truth\") that maps input instances formula_5 to output labels formula_6, along with training data formula_7 assumed to represent accurate examples of the mapping, produce a function formula_8 that approximates as closely as possible the correct mapping formula_9. (For example, if the problem is filtering spam, then formula_10 is some representation of an email and formula_11 is either \"spam\" or \"non-spam\"). In order for this to be a well-defined problem, \"approximates as closely as possible\" needs to be defined rigorously. In decision theory, this is defined by specifying a loss function or cost function that assigns a specific value to \"loss\" resulting from producing an incorrect label. The goal then is to minimize the expected loss, with the expectation taken over the probability distribution of formula_12. In practice, neither the distribution of formula_12 nor the ground truth function formula_4 are known exactly, but can be computed only empirically by collecting a large number of samples of formula_12 and hand-labeling them using the correct value of formula_16 (a time-consuming process, which is typically the limiting factor in the amount of data of this sort that can be collected). The particular loss function depends on the type of label being predicted. For example, in the case of classification, the simple zero-one loss function is often sufficient. This corresponds simply to assigning a loss of 1 to any incorrect labeling and implies that the optimal classifier minimizes the error rate on independent test data (i.e. counting up the fraction of instances that the learned function formula_8 labels wrongly, which is equivalent to maximizing the number of correctly classified instances). The goal of the learning procedure is then to minimize the error rate (maximize the correctness) on a \"typical\" test set.\n\nFor a probabilistic pattern recognizer, the problem is instead to estimate the probability of each possible output label given a particular input instance, i.e., to estimate a function of the form\nwhere the feature vector input is formula_19, and the function \"f\" is typically parameterized by some parameters formula_20. In a discriminative approach to the problem, \"f\" is estimated directly. In a generative approach, however, the inverse probability formula_21 is instead estimated and combined with the prior probability formula_22 using Bayes' rule, as follows:\n\nWhen the labels are continuously distributed (e.g., in regression analysis), the denominator involves integration rather than summation:\n\nThe value of formula_25 is typically learned using maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation. This finds the best value that simultaneously meets two conflicting objects: To perform as well as possible on the training data (smallest error-rate) and to find the simplest possible model. Essentially, this combines maximum likelihood estimation with a regularization procedure that favors simpler models over more complex models. In a Bayesian context, the regularization procedure can be viewed as placing a prior probability formula_26 on different values of formula_25. Mathematically:\n\nwhere formula_29 is the value used for formula_25 in the subsequent evaluation procedure, and formula_31, the posterior probability of formula_25, is given by\n\nIn the Bayesian approach to this problem, instead of choosing a single parameter vector formula_34, the probability of a given label for a new instance formula_19 is computed by integrating over all possible values of formula_25, weighted according to the posterior probability:\n\nThe first pattern classifier – the linear discriminant presented by Fisher – was developed in the frequentist tradition. The frequentist approach entails that the model parameters are considered unknown, but objective. The parameters are then computed (estimated) from the collected data. For the linear discriminant, these parameters are precisely the mean vectors and the covariance matrix. Also the probability of each class formula_22 is estimated from the collected dataset. Note that the usage of 'Bayes rule' in a pattern classifier does not make the classification approach Bayesian.\n\nBayesian statistics has its origin in Greek philosophy where a distinction was already made between the 'a priori' and the 'a posteriori' knowledge. Later Kant defined his distinction between what is a priori known – before observation – and the empirical knowledge gained from observations. In a Bayesian pattern classifier, the class probabilities formula_22 can be chosen by the user, which are then a priori. Moreover, experience quantified as a priori parameter values can be weighted with empirical observations – using e.g., the Beta- (conjugate prior) and Dirichlet-distributions. The Bayesian approach facilitates a seamless intermixing between expert knowledge in the form of subjective probabilities, and objective observations.\n\nProbabilistic pattern classifiers can be used according to a frequentist or a Bayesian approach..\n\nWithin medical science, pattern recognition is the basis for computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems. CAD describes a procedure that supports the doctor's interpretations and findings.\nOther typical applications of pattern recognition techniques are automatic speech recognition, classification of text into several categories (e.g., spam/non-spam email messages), the automatic recognition of handwritten postal codes on postal envelopes, automatic recognition of images of human faces, or handwriting image extraction from medical forms. The last two examples form the subtopic image analysis of pattern recognition that deals with digital images as input to pattern recognition systems.\n\nOptical character recognition is a classic example of the application of a pattern classifier, see\nOCR-example.\nThe method of signing one's name was captured with stylus and overlay starting in 1990. The strokes, speed, relative min, relative max, acceleration and pressure is used to uniquely identify and confirm identity. Banks were first offered this technology, but were content to collect from the FDIC for any bank fraud and did not want to inconvenience customers..\n\nArtificial neural networks (neural net classifiers) and deep learning have many real-world applications in image processing, a few examples:\n\nFor a discussion of the aforementioned applications of neural networks in image processing, see e.g.\n\nIn psychology, pattern recognition (making sense of and identifying objects) is closely related to perception, which explains how the sensory inputs humans receive are made meaningful. Pattern recognition can be thought of in two different ways: the first being template matching and the second being feature detection. \nA template is a pattern used to produce items of the same proportions. The template-matching hypothesis suggests that incoming stimuli are compared with templates in the long term memory. If there is a match, the stimulus is identified.\nFeature detection models, such as the Pandemonium system for classifying letters (Selfridge, 1959), suggest that the stimuli are broken down into their component parts for identification. For example, a capital E has three horizontal lines and one vertical line.\n\nAlgorithms for pattern recognition depend on the type of label output, on whether learning is supervised or unsupervised, and on whether the algorithm is statistical or non-statistical in nature. Statistical algorithms can further be categorized as generative or discriminative.\n\nParametric:\nNonparametric:\n\n\n\n\nUnsupervised:\n\nSupervised (?):\n\nSupervised:\n\nUnsupervised:\n\nSupervised:\n\nUnsupervised:\n\n\n"}

Shafia sisters Zainab, 19, Sahar, 17, and Geeti, 13, along with Rona Amir Mohammed, 50, (all Afghan origin) were found dead inside a car that was discovered underwater in front of the northernmost Kingston Mills lock of the Rideau Canal on the same day. Zainab, Sahar, and Geeti were daughters of Mohammad Shafia, 58 and his wife Tooba Mohammad Yahya, 41. The couple also had a son Hamed, 20, and three other children. Rona, who was herself infertile, was the first wife of Mohammad Shafia in their polygamous household.\n\nOn July 23, 2009, Mohammad, Tooba Yahya, and Hamed were arrested on charges of four counts of first degree murder and conspiracy to commit murder under the guise of honour killing. They were found guilty of all four counts by the jury in January 2012. The trial, which took place at the Frontenac County Court House, was believed to be the first in Canada conducted in four languages – English, French, Dari and Spanish.\n\nThe trial garnered media attention in Canada for several months, and raised the debate over Canadian values, honour crimes, and violence among Muslim groups.\n\nIn 1979 or 1980, Mohammad Shafia married Rona Mohammed. The couple did not have children, and medical tests confirmed that Rona was unable to have children. In keeping with Afghan custom, and at Rona's behest, Mohammad Shafia took Tooba Yahya as his second wife. The second wedding took place in 1989, and Rona features prominently in many wedding photographs, many of which feature Shafia flanked by his two wives. The three of them lived together in one household, as is customary, and Tooba gave birth to seven children. Rona participated fully in raising and caring for the children and bonded strongly with them, as though they were her own. Her relationship with her co-wife was, however, less idyllic.\n\nThe Shafia family left Afghanistan in 1992. They moved to Australia for a brief while, and then to the United Arab Emirates, where they lived for over a decade. Mohammad Shafia made a considerable fortune in Dubai, working in the used car business and later diversifying into real estate. By 2007, he was a millionaire many times over, and decided to take advantage of an immigration programme introduced by the government of Quebec in Canada, which offered permanent residence and eventual citizenship to people who invested significant money in the province. Shafia invested $2 million in purchasing a strip-mall on the outskirts of Montreal, and a further $200,000 in building a spacious new house for his family. Shafia, his second wife Tooba and their seven children immigrated to Canada and settled in the Saint-Léonard borough of Montreal in 2007. Five months later, Shafia sponsored the immigration of Rona, telling the authorities that she was his cousin and that she would work as a cook and housekeeper.\n\nAccording to a family member's interview, Rona was trapped in an abusive, loveless marriage, trying in vain to convince her husband to grant her a divorce. Rona's siblings claimed that she feared for her life during the days leading up to her death. Tooba, the second wife, allegedly said to Rona “You are a slave, you are a servant.” Reportedly, the Shafias held all of Rona’s identity documents, including her passport, so Rona believed she could not flee to another country, where she had relatives.\nThey also stated that the family's eldest daughter Zainab's relationship with a Pakistani boy was a source of much anger for her father, and they claimed to have overheard the father's threats to kill her.\n\nWith parents Mohammad Shafia and Tooba Mohammad Yahya, and eldest son Hamed Shafia all in custody during the trial, the remaining Shafia children (two girls and a boy) were being cared for under social services.\n\nOn June 30, 2009, a black Nissan Sentra with a broken left taillight was spotted submerged at the Kingston Mills locks, with four female bodies found inside. Mohammad Shafia was at the Kingston Police station to report that four of their family – three teenage daughters and a purported aunt – were missing. Police initially believed that it was a tragic, if bizarre, accident, and first categorized it as a \"sudden death investigation\".\n\nHowever, authorities soon learned that Hamed had reported an accident with the family Lexus SUV in an empty parking lot early that same morning in Montreal. Despite their suspicions, the authorities did not have \"reasonable and probable grounds\" or sufficient evidence to ask a judge for a search warrant. Kingston Police Det. Steve Koopman, the liaison with the Shafia family, managed to gain the Shafias' consent so that they could view the Lexus. After assessing the damage on both vehicles, police theorized that the Lexus was used to ram the Nissan into the locks.\n\nIt has been reported that the Shafia family purchased the used Nissan Sentra for CAD$5,000 one day before the family left Montreal for Niagara Falls.\n\nJury selection began on October 11, and the trial officially began on October 20. The trial was presided over by Ontario Superior Court Judge Robert Maranger.\n\nOn January 29, 2012, the jury completed its deliberation after 15 hours and reached a verdict of guilty, four counts of first degree murder for each of the three defendants. First degree murder carries an automatic sentence of life in prison without a possibility of parole for 25 years.\n\nThe coverage of the Shafia murder trial was widespread, often being on the front page of newspapers and the top story in TV newscasts. Since the case involved Afghan Canadians, questions arose as to whether or not it was correct, or even appropriate, to call the murders honour killing or simply domestic violence. While the judge who deliberated on the case referred to the act simply as murder, the media chose a different course when it called the murder \"honour killing\". Across media outlets, the murder was framed as such. A publication ban placed on the case prevented the media from naming the three children that are still alive, with Hamed being the fourth.\n\nCBC News covered the trials from day 1 and went a step further by publishing its audience's comments to show how Canadians feel about the case and its details. The CBC stated that the story garnered many comments from the viewers but that they decided to publish a select few. Furthermore, the CBC did a \"summary\" of the comments and said that people generally \"agreed with the verdict, applauding the court and the jury for its decision after the three-month trial.\"\n\nCTV News published a piece saying that the trial has cast a shadow over Canada's Islamic community, further tarnishing an image that has not yet recovered from the events of 9/11. But like other media outlets, CTV has asked the Muslim community to clarify their stance on the issue of honour killing.\n“Muslims across the country, however, say the revelations in a Kingston, Ont., courtroom have shone a light on problematic aspects of their culture and illuminated new ways to tackle the issues.”\n\nCTV also published a timeline of not just the events that took place in Canada but also going back all the way to the Shafia family’s days in Afghanistan.\n\nPascale Fournier, writing for \"The Ottawa Citizen\", said that there was a greater tragedy in the failure of the state to intervene before the murders occurred, and that vulnerable groups from immigrant communities need the most protection but rarely get it.\n\nIn addition to covering every detail of the trial, \"The Globe and Mail\" published a piece with the \"ten most shocking quotes\" from the Shafia trial one of which was by Crown attorney Gerard Laarhuis after the verdicts which is as follows:\n\n“This jury found that four strong, vivacious and freedom-loving women were murdered by their own family in the most troubling of circumstances. We all think of these four, wonderful women now who died needless deaths. This verdict sends a very clear message about our Canadian values and the core principles in a free and democratic society that all Canadians enjoy and even visitors to Canada enjoy.”\n\nThis was one of the most criticized quotes by Afghan Canadians, as they asserted that intolerance towards violence against women is not just a Canadian value but a universal value and Afghans like any other peoples condemn the acts of the perpetrators.\n\nThe \"Montreal Gazette\" published a column in which it said that labelling the murders as honour killing is a mistake because domestic violence against women is ubiquitous and framing it into a particular category would mean distancing oneself from a crime that is all too common. The authors argue that premeditation is put forth as a core component to differentiate honour killings from other types of murders, such as crimes of convenience or crimes of passion. However, recent studies indicate that premeditation is as much a component in other cases of domestic violence and murder as it is in \"honour killings.\"\n\n\"Calling the murders \"honour killings\" accomplishes two goals. First, it makes it seem as if femicide is a highly unusual event. Second, it makes it seem as if femicide is confined to specific populations within Canada and specific national cultures or religions in the world at large. But Canadian statistics prove otherwise. According to StatsCan figures, from 2000 to 2009 an average of 58 women a year were killed in this country as a result of spousal violence. In that same period, 67 children and young people aged 12 to 17 were murdered by family members. In contrast, recent estimates tell us that there have been 12 or 13 so-called honour killings in Canada in the last decade. It does not take a genius to see that comparing 12 or 13 against the hundreds of women and children who were victims of familial violence serves only to frame \"honour killing\" as peculiar, when in reality it is part of a larger pattern of violence against women.\"\n\n\"Maclean's\" referred to the four murders as “honouricide”. Writer Michael Friscolanti sat throughout the three-month trial and wrote a 22-page comprehensive article detailing the girls’ lives and even wrote about how one of the girls’ tombstones has the incorrect birthdate.\n\n“In life, and in death, they had no voice. No one to save them. No one who even cares enough to fix Geeti's headstone. Nearly three years after she was buried, it is still engraved with Sahar's birth-date, not hers.\"\n\nThe widespread media coverage pressured the Muslim as well as the Afghan community in Canada to come out and speak about the murders.\n\nIt has also given rise to the debate about the relationship of honour killing and Islam. Islamic organizations based in Canada condemned the murders. The Islamic Supreme Council of Canada, along with other Canadian Muslim organizations, have publicly denounced domestic violence and honour killing as un-Islamic. Ali Falih Altaie, the family imam, said that the murders were unforgivable, and cautioned against associating honour crimes with Islam, calling the actions incompatible with any religion.\n\nIn 2012 imams from across Canada and the U.S. issued a moral ruling officially condemning honour killings, domestic violence and misogyny as un-Islamic. Thirty-four imams belonging to the Islamic Supreme Council of Canada, including a handful of American members, signed the fatwa in an effort to counter misinterpretations of the Qur'an, they said.\n\nThe Afghan Embassy in Ottawa in an interview with CTVS News condemned the murders of four members of a Montreal family originally from Afghanistan. The embassy called the deaths of the three teenaged sisters and their father's first wife a heinous crime against humanity. Moreover, they claimed that this kind of crime is not part of Afghan or Islamic culture and is not acceptable in any way.\n\n"}

Through the middle of the fourteenth century, the universities of Bologna, Montpellier, and Paris had a virtual monopoly on medical education in Western Europe. As a professor of medicine, Alderotti quickly gained a reputation as an excellent teacher and commanded large crowds of students. His courses relied on the works of Hippocrates, Galen, and Avicenna, which had been given a position of authority since Constantine the African brought these over from north Africa in the 11th century and translated them.\n\nThe students Alderotti taught during his tenure as professor would become some of the best doctors and professors of the next generation.

While consisting of two suckers, one being ventral and one being oral. They have a tegument covering which helps them with absorption and protection from the environment. \n\nThe life cycle of a typical trematode begins when the egg is immersed in water or from the adult worms in the definitive host. Some trematode eggs hatch in water, others are eaten by the first intermediate host and hatch within that host, so there are many different routes that a trematode could take to infect a host. Following this, the miracidium, which is free-swimming ciliated larva that a parasite moves from the egg to host stage, hatches which then also goes to find the mollusc host as the first intermediate host. This is where either a rediae or sporocyst will form depending on the host and if there is competition between the two. This eventually forms into a motile cercariae. The cercariae then either infects vertebrates through the skin of a host or is ingested and aims to locate the second intermediate host. When in the vertebrate host, the cercariae can then form into an adult, metacercariae or mesocercariae, depending on the life cycle, or is rejected through feces or urine. Then the metacercariae and second intermediate host has to be ingested by the definitive host for the life cycle to be completed.\n\nWhile the details vary with each species, the general life cycle stages are:\nFound in either feces, sputum or in the urine. Depending on the species it will either be unembryonated (immature) or embryonated (ready to hatch), while all are operculated besides schistosomes. Some eggs are eaten by the host (snail) or hatch in the environment first when coming into contact with water.\n\nThese hatch from the eggs and switches to locate the host. They do not have a mouth therefore cannot eat and need to find the host quickly in order to survive because they have a limited amount of energy, which will then develop into the mother sporocyst. Its main function is to infect the first intermediate host, which can differ for different trematodes.\n\nElongated sac that produces either more sporocyst or rediae. This is where larva can be to develop.\n\nAfter the sporocyst form the larva, the first development from it forms the redia. They have a mouth which allows them to have an advantage to their competitors because they can just consume them. Will either produce more rediae or start to form cercariae. The amount of rediae or daughter sporocyst varies a lot in the representatives of different deign taxa. \n\nCo-infections of different parasite species within the same post could occur and cause a competition between the rediae and sporocysts. Not all trematode species have a rediae stage, some may just have a sporocyst stage depending on the life cycle. The rediae are dominant to sporocyst because they have a \"mouth\" and are able to either eat their competitors' food or their competitor.\n\nThe larval form of the parasite, it develops within the germinal cells of the sporocyst or redia. A cercaria has a tapering head with large penetration glands. It may or may not have a long swimming \"tail\", depending on the species. The motile cercaria finds and settles in a host where it will become either an adult, or a mesocercaria, or a metacercaria, according to species.\n\n\n\n\"Cercaria\" is also used as a genus of trematodes, when adult forms are not known. The usage dates back to Müller, in 1773.\n\nThe fully developed mature stage, it is capable of sexual reproduction.\n\nNot all trematodes follow the typical sequence of eggs, miracidia, sporocysts, rediae, cercariae, and adults. In some species, the redial stage is omitted, and sporocysts produce cercariae. In some species, the cercaria develops into an adult within the same host.\n\nMany digenean trematodes require two hosts, one (typically a snail) where asexual reproduction occurs in sporocysts, the other a vertebrate (typically a fish) where the adult form engages in sexual reproduction to produce eggs. In some species (for example \"Ribeiroia\") the cercaria encysts, and waits until the host is eaten by a third host, in whose gut it emerges and develops into an adult.\n\nMost trematodes are hermaphroditic, but members of the family Schistosomatidae are dioecious. Males are shorter and stouter than the females.\n\n\n"}

He was born in the parish of St. Paul's Convent Garden, London, England, on July 17, 1792. His father, Michael Hogan, was an Irish merchant and shipowner, who sailed with his family between Britain, South Africa, India, China and Australia. Hogan's mother was Frances Richardson Hogan, the illegitimate daughter of William Richardson, a merchant who based in Bombay who Michael Hogan worked with and Anna Lacy, Richardson's housekeeper who was of at least partial native Indian descent. In 1803, Hogan senior and his family settled in New York City.\n\nHogan pursued classical studies and graduated from Columbia College in 1811. He served in the War of 1812 and fought in the Battle of Plattsburgh. He studied law, was admitted to the bar but did not engage in practice.\n\nHe served as a member of the New York State Assembly, was county judge of Franklin County, and was elected as a Jacksonian to the Twenty-second Congress (March 4, 1831 – March 3, 1833). Hogan was an unsuccessful candidate for reelection in 1832 to the Twenty-third Congress. He was appointed examiner of claims on March 30, 1855, and subsequently became a translator in the U.S. State Department, serving until October 8, 1869. He died in Washington, D.C. on November 25, 1874, with interment in Trinity Church Cemetery, New York City.\n"}

He subsequently joined the military and rose in ranks, becoming a minister in the scholar dominated government.\n\nIn August 1170 (Uijong 24th year), he joined the Goryeo warrior rebellion, which occurred in defiance against the typically scholar/minister ruled Korea. Primary leaders of this rebellion was Jeong Jung-bu and Yi Go who found that warrior-class treatment was truly unfair and planned a coup e tat to establish a warrior government.\n\nThe King of Goryeo, Uijong was soon disposed and the new warrior-class ministers set up a puppet king Myeongjong. Yi was named as one of the key figures in the new regime with the title of High Merit Minister (壁上功臣) and given special privileges along with the other ministers. When Yi Go tried to plot a coup and get hold of a dictatorship in 1171, Yi, under the orders of Chung Jung-bu purged and murdered Yi Go.\n\nWith Jeong, Yi increased the size and power of the military and attracted military-class administrators to the regime and appointed these men to national offices which were previously reserved for scholar-class ministers. In 1173, when a scholar-class minister Kim Bo-dang (김보당 金甫當) attempted to restore disposed king Uijong to the throne, Yi decisively slew the former king, preventing any further restoration attempts. With this merit, he was further promoted to Commander of Land Troops.\n\nDuring his co-governance with Jeong, Yi also faced a series of Buddhist Monk uprisings from different shrines around the nation. As Goryeo was officially a Buddhist nation since Wangkon's unification of Korea, the Buddhists had great influence upon the government and most Goryeo kings appointed official Buddhist Great Monk advisors to assist in national administration. Due to the increasing Buddhist uprisings, Yi himself commanded his forces to put down these rebellions and raid Buddhist shrines. With his powerful forces, he swept the nation and raided and pillaged these shrines. \n\nAt this time, Jo Wi-chong (조위총, 趙位寵), a general of the North-Western border attempted to start a rebellion. Yi responded by murdering favorers of this rebellion such as Yun In-mi (윤인미, 尹仁美), who was of Seogyung birth. Due to this action, Yi lost support and favors from the people, and when he attempted to put down this rebellion, he failed.\n\nYi, attempting to put down Jeong and gain more power, tried to appoint his daughter as Royal Prince consort, an action which did not fulfill objective but instead further endangered Yi's political situation. Due to this action, the 2nd Jo Invasion force, led by Jeong Jung-bu's son Jeong Gyun subsequently murdered Yi Ui-Bang and his supporters and removed his daughter from the royal family. However, soon enough, Jeong Jung-bu was also murdered and the young and righteous dictator Gyeong Dae-seung took power.\n\nGeneral Yi Ui-bang's main legacy remains in the balance that was achieved through the purging of scholars during his co-governance with Jeong. Before the arrival of Yi, the scholar class had more influence in the government to the extent that the warrior-class was greatly mistreated. With the changing of kings and shifting of power from scholar-class to warrior-class, Goryeo faced a new era. A final and very important legacy is his connection with the founder of the Joseon Dynasty, Yi Songgye. Yi Ui-Bang's younger brother Yi In was a 6th generation ancestor of Yi Songgye, thus connecting Yi Ui-Bang and Yi Songgye together.\n\n\n"}
