Along with such features as \"In Search of Noah's Ark\" (1976) and \"In Search of Historic Jesus\" (1979), the film was one of a series of releases from the company that attempted to present convincing scientific evidence for Christian theology.\n\nBased in part on a book by evangelist Ralph Wilkerson, the idea for \"Beyond and Back\" was suggested to Sunn Pictures by a freelance writer who submitted a treatment for the film after reading about the film studio in Writer's Digest. The film's screenwriter, Stephen Lord, was a respected television screenwriter, having written scripts for such notable sci-fi/horror programs as \"The Outer Limits\" and \".\" Directing chores went to James L. Conway, who had helmed Sunn's speculative fiction vehicle \"The Lincoln Conspiracy\" the previous year.

Sunn Classic Pictures mostly screened its films in smaller towns and non-urban areas. It was also popular at drive-in movie theaters. This approach \"avoided the audiences and the critical media in Los Angeles and New York... if the film failed in any single market, negative word of mouth did not spread to the next locale.\"\n\nWasser's assertion has, however, been disputed: \"Wow, I saw it when I was 6.

{"id": "45477835", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=45477835", "title": "Breastfeeding and HIV", "text": "Breastfeeding and HIV\n\nBreastfeeding by HIV-infected mothers is the practice of breastfeeding of HIV-infected mothers and include those who may want to or are currently breastfeeding . HIV can be transmitted to the infant through breastfeeding. The risk of transmission varies and depends on the viral load in the mother's milk. A infant can be infected with HIV throughout the duration of the pregnancy or during childbirth (intrapartum).\n\nBreastfeeding with HIV guidelines established by the WHO suggest that HIV-infected mothers (particularly those in resource-poor countries) practice exclusive breastfeeding only, rather than mixed breastfeeding practices that involve other dietary supplements or fluids. Many studies have revealed the high benefit of exclusive breastfeeding to both mother and child, documenting that exclusive breastfeeding for a period of 6 months significantly reduces transmission, provides the infant with a greater chance of survival in the first year of life, and helps the mother to recover from the negative health effects of birth much more quickly.\n\nDespite these positive indicators, other studies have determined that bottle-fed babies of HIV-infected mothers approximately has a 19 percent chance of becoming infected, in comparison to breastfed babies who had an approximate 49 percent chance of infection. Such a variance in findings makes it difficult to institute a proper set of guidelines for HIV-infected women in third-world or developing countries, where alternative forms of feeding are not always acceptable, feasible, affordable, sustainable, and safe (AFASS). Thus after much research, the benefits and/or consequences of breastfeeding with HIV are still currently under debate.\n\nThe practice of breastfeeding for HIV positive mothers is a highly contested and controversial global public health concern. Programs for prevention of mother to child transmission (PMTCT) and other international guidelines offer preventative interventions to address mother to child transmission(MTCT) of HIV in Third World countries. PMTCT programs provide HIV-positive women with recommendations and services including antiretroviral therapy (ART), modifications in infant feeding practices (i.e., exclusive breastfeeding or exclusive replacement feeding), and counseling.\n\nAlthough prevention of mother to child transmission (PMTCT) programs have been implemented across different regions, their success in resource-constrained settings is still widely debated upon. In 2008, the majority of sub-Saharan Africa as a whole had an estimate of 430,000 HIV infections among children under the age of 15. HIV-positive women's lack of participation and adherence to PMTCT services and infant feeding guidelines has made the success of these policies difficult, despite the knowledge and technology that has been dedicated to them. Many women fear knowing their HIV status. Generally speaking, HIV-positive mothers lack support, especially from males, thus resulting in their stigmatization and exclusion by members of the community. It is because of this that most women end up losing contact with development programs, which end soon after the mother delivers. The discontinuation of these programs makes a knowledge and understanding of different feeding options difficult for these mothers, because these programs are not there to present them with the necessary information.\n\nAccess to available resources for the prevention of MTCT of HIV varies across different cultural regions. “MTCT of HIV has been virtually eliminated in well-resourced settings such as the United States and Europe”. Available medical and therapeutic resources in developed countries can include drugs for HIV-positive mothers during pregnancy and labour, cesarean delivery to reduce the infant's exposure to infection; and modifications in infant feeding practices. In third world settings, medical resources and technology can be very hard to find and can serve as a financial burden to HIV-positive mothers. HIV-infected mothers refer to counselors for expert knowledge and recommendations on infant feeding and health. Treatment amenities in resource-constrained settings are also available to HIV-positive mothers in the form of antiretroviral therapy (ART) which is one resource that has contributed to the elimination of MTCT of HIV in first world countries. In order to have access to resources, HIV-positive mothers must be able maintain follow up appointments regularly, however, this is problematic in resource-limited settings due to weak infrastructure in health care systems in countries such as India, Tanzania and Nigeria. This can also serve as a dilemma for HIV-positive mothers because although limited resources are available to them, financial constraint can prevent women from accessing available treatments. This can influence HIV-positive mother's decision to rely solely on breastfeeding as a primary feeding option due to financial instability.\n\nAnthropological research demonstrates that in contexts where breastfeeding is essential to infant survival, such as in resource poor settings, PMTCT infant feeding guidelines challenge notions of motherhood and women's decision making power over infant care, and colour HIV positive mothers' infant feeding experiences. In eastern Africa, infant mortality is high and breastfeeding is vital for infant survival. Here, motherhood is defined as the responsibility for ensuring the child's proper growth and health. Breastfeeding is also seen as a cultural practice that helps create a social bond between mother and child. However, there is a disjuncture between PMTCT policy's infant feeding guideline and what is considered to be good mothering behaviour. The PMTCT policy promotes replacement feeding because it is believed to prevent the risk of transmission of HIV. However, adhering to such guidelines are difficult for mothers in resource-limited settings who believe that not breastfeeding one's child would be harmful to their health and survival, as well as threaten the “development of close bodily and emotional bonds between mother and child”. As such, not breastfeeding, for HIV-positive women, is perceived as failing to be a good mother. Thus, PMTCT programs impact HIV-positive women's agency and decision-making in infant care, as well as challenge their cultural conceptions of good motherhood.\n\nIn an effort to further refine the United Nations guideline for optimal infant feeding options for HIV-infected mothers, the World Health Organization (WHO) held a three-day convention in Geneva in 2006 to review new evidence that had been established since they last established a guideline in 2000. Participants included UN agencies, representative from nongovernmental organizations, researchers, infant feeding experts, and WHO headquarters departments. The convention concluded with the following recommendations: If replacement feeding is acceptable, feasible, affordable and safe, HIV-infected mothers are recommended to use replacement feeding. Otherwise, exclusive breastfeeding is recommended. At six months, if replacement feeding is still not available, HIV-infected mothers are encouraged to slowly introduce food while continuing breastfeeding. Those with HIV-infected infants are recommended to continue breastfeeding even after 6 months.\n\n\n"}

Today, he is best known for his memoir, \"Relation of My American Project\" (c. 1716), which recounts his life as the Baron of Bernburg and Landgrave of Carolina.\n\nVon Graffenried was born on 15 November 1661 to Anton von Graffenried, Lord of Worb, and his first wife, Catherine, at Worb Castle in Bern, Switzerland.\n\nVon Graffenried met Luis Michel, who claimed to know the location of silver ore in Virginia and owned land in the New World. He told von Graffenried what glorious places Carolina and Virginia were, and he advised him to move to Carolina. With the idea of paying off his debts and making money on the cheap land of Carolina, he left his debts to his father and secretly departed for London to make arrangements to move to the New World. When in London, he met with explorer John Lawson, who was publishing a book entitled \"A Voyage to Carolina\". Lawson was the Surveyor General of Carolina. Lawson promised to show von Graffenried and his settlers a perfect place to establish a community. In 1709, von Graffenried next met with the Lords Proprietors of Carolina, who granted to him ten thousand acres (40 km²) on the Neuse and Cape Fear Rivers. They also gave him the title Baron of Bernberg, after the colony he was supposed to found.\n\nVon Graffenried recruited a group of German refugees from the Palatine region, which had been ravaged by French warfare and an extremely harsh winter, and Bernese immigrants. After severe hardships in their own countries, they were willing to try starting over in Carolina. He sailed with the colonists to Carolina in 1710. On the sea, the settlers were attacked by French privateers who stripped them of everything they brought. (On a similar voyage of nearly 3000 German Palatines from London to New York, nearly one-third died during and shortly after the trip; shipboard illnesses killed many already weakened by the harsh conditions of that winter.)\nOnce in the New World, the settlers sold everything that remained, except the clothes on their backs. John Lawson took them to a site at the junction of the Trent and Neuse Rivers, which they named New Bern. The first season, the settler's crops did not do well. Von Graffenried returned to Europe to get supplies and additional settlers. He returned to the colony unscathed. In addition to a lack of food and supplies, there was great tension between the settlers and the Tuscarora Indians of the Neuse River region. They were separated by language and culture, especially related to their differing concepts of land and property rights. The Tuscarora were an Iroquoian-speaking people, distantly related to the Five Tribes of the Iroquois Confederacy based in central and western New York. The settlers had unwittingly planned their new settlement on the site of an old Tuscarora village. In 1711, von Graffenried and the settlers evicted a group of Tuscarora from nearby lands without payment, and von Graffenried assumed the title \"Landgrave of Carolina.\" Retaliatory raids by the Tuscarora, under a leader named Hancock, led to deaths and damage to the settlement.\n\nDuring the summer of 1711, von Graffenried, along with John Lawson, took a trip up the Neuse River. Von Graffenried wanted to crossbreed European grapes with wild, native grapes and start a vineyard. The Tuscarora took captive von Graffenried, John Lawson, and an enslaved African whom they had entrusted with their baggage. While in captivity, John Lawson and von Graffenried were given three separate trials, each in a different Tuscaroran village. One found the men not guilty; the other two pronounced them guilty of crimes against the Tuscarora. The Tuscarora decided to kill them but, after extended discussion over several weeks, the elders decided von Graffenried would be released. He wore such fine clothes they mistook him for the Governor of Carolina. They thought if they let the \"governor\" go, the colony would let the incident pass. They informed him they were planning an attack on all the settlements in northern Carolina (when this took place, it was known as the Tuscarora War). The next day, the natives killed Lawson after ritual torture. Von Graffenried was released on condition that no new European settlements should be made without the sanction of the native chiefs. When he finally reached New Bern, he found it abandoned and in flames.\n\nIn 1712 von Graffenried contracted French-Canadian guide and surveyor Martin Chartier to take him to Sugarloaf Mountain and then to the Shenandoah Valley, where they visited Massanutten Mountain, the supposed site of silver ore which the baron hoped to mine, however they found no evidence of any ore.\n\nHaving lost his fortune, von Graffenried returned penniless in 1714 to Worb, Switzerland. He sold his part in Carolina to Thomas Pollock for 800 pounds. Von Graffenried soon wrote a book entitled \"Relation of My American Project\". In it, he included several documents, among them a letter written to the governor of Carolina and a layout of the settlement of New Bern.\n\nOn 25 April 1684 von Graffenried married Regina Tscharner (1665–1731). Tscharner also came from an accomplished and respected family, her father, Beat Ludwig, having been a member of the Assembly and her grandfather, Samuel, having been the Governor and Mayor of Chillon. The von Graffenrieds had four sons and seven daughters. In 1702, von Graffenried acquired the office of Governor of Yverdon.\n\n\n -->\n"}

Domestic violence is an issue that affects people of any sexuality, but there are issues that affect victims of same-sex domestic violence specifically. These issues include homophobia, HIV and AIDS stigma, STD risk and other health issues, lack of legal support, and the violence they face being considered less serious than heterosexual domestic violence. Moreover, the issue of domestic violence in same-sex relationships has not been studied as comprehensively as domestic violence in heterosexual relationships. However, there are legal changes being made to help victims of domestic violence in same-sex relationships, as well as organizations that cater specifically to victims of domestic violence in same-sex relationships.\n\nThe \"Encyclopedia of Victimology and Crime Prevention\" states, \"For several methodological reasons – nonrandom sampling procedures and self-selection factors, among others – it is not possible to assess the extent of same-sex domestic violence. Studies on abuse between gay male or lesbian partners usually rely on small convenience samples such as lesbian or gay male members of an association.\"\n\nSome sources state that gay and lesbian couples experience domestic violence at the same frequency as heterosexual couples, while other sources state domestic violence among gay, lesbian, and bisexual individuals might be higher than among heterosexual individuals, that gay, lesbian, and bisexual individuals are less likely to report domestic violence that has occurred in their intimate relationships than heterosexual couples are, or that lesbian couples experience domestic violence less than heterosexual couples do. By contrast, some researchers commonly assume that lesbian couples experience domestic violence at the same rate as heterosexual couples, and have been more cautious when reporting domestic violence among gay male couples. According to a 2012 report from the National Coalition of Anti-Violence Programs (NCAVP) of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer, and HIV-Affected Intimate Partner Violence Gay men were more likely to require medical attention and suffer injuries as a result of IPV. Gay men were close to two times (1.7) more likely to require medical attention and 16 times more likely to suffer injury as compared to individuals who did not identify as gay men. A 2014 review of the literature found that rates of domestic violence among same-sex couples are similar to or greater than opposite-sexed couples. \n\nIn a 2010 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) study, reporting on domestic violence in the U.S., 26% of gay men said that they experienced physical violence, stalking, or rape by their partners. 29% of heterosexual men reported similar violence in the same study.\n\nThe CDC also stated that 40% of lesbian women reported physical violence by their partners, and 44% reported experiencing physical violence, stalking, or rape by their partners. In contrast, 35% of heterosexual women reported physical violence, stalking, or rape by their partners in the same study.\n\nLiterature on intimate partner violence (IPV) among same-gender female couples, researchers found that internalized homophobia and discrimination were correlated with IPV. In addition, research done on psychological aggression of lesbian relationships, researchers found that internalized homophobia and social constraints in talking with friends about sexual identity issues showed correlation with IPV. Literature on intimate partner violence (IPV) among same-gender male couples, SES, attachment orientation, HIV status, and public outness, and internalized homophobia showed relationship with intimate partner violence in gay men. Similarly, a study conducted on the predictors of IPA of gay men found a correlation between public outness, alcohol consumption, and internalized homophobia \n\nAlthough [[Bisexuality|bisexual]] people may be in relationships with people of any gender, they are often victims of domestic violence. The CDC reported that 61% of bisexual women said they experienced physical violence, stalking, or rape by their partners. For men in the same study, 37% reported having experienced similar violence.\n\nFor both men and women, the percentage of bisexual people who have experienced domestic violence is higher than either gay men or lesbians. The high rate of domestic violence faced by bisexual people may be in part because of the [[Biphobia|specific challenges bisexual people face]] in receiving help, as bisexuality is often misunderstood, even by those who administer domestic violence help professionally.\n\n[[Transgender]] people may be in relationships with people of any gender, but they experience high rates of domestic violence. Comparatively, little research has been conducted on domestic violence towards transgender individuals, especially within the context of romantic relationships. In a 2009 United States study, 56% to 66% of transgender individuals reported experiencing violence within their homes, though not necessarily by a romantic partner.\n\nMembers of same-sex relationships who face domestic violence often have issues accessing legal recourse, as domestic violence laws are often drafted in such a way as to only include different sex partnerships. Some are worried about being involved in the legal system because they are afraid they will be mistreated or dismissed due to their sexual orientation. Although often the abuser can still be arrested or tried for [[assault]] or similar crimes, not classifying the crime as domestic may change how it is dealt with in the court system and change how the victim is treated. Also, studies have shown that law enforcement officers do not treat domestic violence in same-sex relationships as seriously as domestic violence in heterosexual relationships.\n\nVictims of domestic violence in same sex relationships do have legal rights afforded to them in some U.S. states, whether or not they are married to their partner, although the requirements and protections vary by state. Some of these rights include having a [[Injunction|civil protection order]] or [[restraining order]] placed on the abuser to keep them from stalking or harassing the victim.\n\nSome cities and states in the U.S. are working to improve the legal situation for LGBT victims of domestic violence, through policy change and police training. In [[Washington, D.C.|Washington D.C.]] the city has created an LGBT unit of their police department to combat [[Violence against LGBT people|homophobic violence]] and to deal with [[Transphobia|violence against transgender people]] by professionals who are also members of the [[LGBT community]].\n\n[[File:Minnesota AIDS Project - HIV Stigma Stops Here - Twin Cities Pride Parade (9180874836).jpg|thumb|People carry a banner promoting the end of HIV stigma at a [[Pride parade|Pride Parade]]]]\n\n[[HIV/AIDS]] may create additional problems for those in violent relationships, financially, emotionally, and health wise, whether it is the perpetrator or the victim who is living with HIV or AIDS. This specifically affects those in same-sex relationships because [[men who have sex with men]], no matter how they identity, are significantly more likely to have HIV or AIDS than others.\n\nThose living with HIV are often financially dependent on their partners, making it more difficult to leave abusive relationships. If it is the victim who has HIV or AIDS the abuser may take control of their finances in order to have even more control over their life. This issue is compounded by the fact that those living with HIV or AIDS may often become too sick to work and support themselves, and that even when they are able to work they often face [[discrimination]] in the workplace or in the hiring process, even though this is technically illegal under the [[Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990|Americans with Disabilities Act]].\n\nAbusers may use emotional tactics to exert control over their partners, whether it is them or the victim who has HIV or AIDS. Some abusive partners may threaten to reveal their partner's positive [[Diagnosis of HIV/AIDS|HIV status]] to others as a form of control, as there is a [[Discrimination against people with HIV/AIDS|stigma surrounding HIV and AIDS]] that could affect a victim's life. If it is the abuser who has HIV or AIDS, the victim may fear that leaving someone who is sick makes them seem shallow, uncaring, or discriminatory, or the abuser may insinuate that if their partner leaves the relationship the abuser will become sicker as a result. Oppositionally, if it is the victim who has HIV or AIDS, the abuser may imply that the victim will be unable to find another partner due to their positive HIV status or that they will die alone.The abuser may also claim that it is the victim's fault that the abuser has HIV or AIDS, essentially [[Emotional blackmail|emotionally blackmailing]] them to stay in the relationship.\n\nThere are many health related ways that HIV or AIDS can affect domestic violence in same-sex relationships. Some perpetrators of domestic violence purposefully try to transmit [[Sexually transmitted infection|STDs]] to their partner or to transmit their partner's STD to themselves, as a tactic to control their partner. Additionally, many people in same-sex relationships who experienced domestic violence experienced violence specifically because they had asked their partners to use [[condom]]s or other [[prophylactics]], which are known to limit the spread of HIV. In conjunction with this, abusers may tamper with their partner's [[pre-exposure prophylaxis]] medications that prevent the spread of HIV, or may use the social [[Slut-shaming|stigma surrounding the use of pre-exposure prophylaxis]] to convince their partner not to use it. The abuser may also tamper with their partner's or their own [[Management of HIV/AIDS|HIV medication]], or keep their partner from receiving health care in other ways. Furthermore, those with HIV or AIDS may be more affected by physical violence than those who are healthy, as their [[immune system]]s are weak and physical injuries will be harder to recover from. Those living with HIV or AIDS may also be more affected by [[emotional trauma]] for the same reason.\n\nHomophobia plays a role in causing domestic violence in same-sex relationships as well as being a systemic issue as to why victims of same-sex domestic violence lack access to resources.\n\nOne way this occurs is through the fear of being \"[[Outing|outed]],\" as abusers may use this fear of being outed to control their partners or an abuser may use the fact that they are not out to limit their partner's exposure to other LGBT people who would recognize that their relationship is unhealthy.\n\nAnother way homophobia plays a role in domestic violence is that people in same-sex relationships may feel that they have a duty to represent the LGBT community in a positive manner, and that if their relationship is abusive it is proof that homosexuality is inherently wrong, immoral, or otherwise flawed. Further, the abuser may frame the abuse as justified because of the victim's [[Sexual orientation]], or imply that no one will help the victim because of their sexual orientation.\n\nOn a systematic level, many resources offered to victims of domestic violence are not offered to victims of domestic violence in same-sex relationships. This refusal to help victims of same-sex domestic violence victims occurs both by private domestic violence help centers and by law enforcement, who may not treat same-sex domestic violence as seriously as domestic violence in heterosexual relationships.\n\nHistorically, domestic violence was viewed by many [[Feminism|feminists]] as \"a manifestation of patriarchal power.\" This definition saw domestic violence as a phenomenon acted out by men onto women, therefore leaving out [[Domestic violence against men|male victims of domestic violence]] and victims of domestic violence in same-sex relationships. Some abusers even capitalize on the idea that domestic violence cannot occur in same-sex relationships to convince their partner that the abuse is normal or non-abusive.\n\nOne idea that persists and is harmful to lesbians, is that sexual assault is less serious or aggressive when perpetrated by women. However, being sexually assaulted can be traumatic to victims regardless of the gender of the perpetrator. Similarly, women stalking other women or men seem as less threatening than the same actions being perpetrated by men, so lesbian victims of stalking may be ignored by law enforcement and other individuals. Part of this problem that specifically impacts lesbians is that lesbians are assumed to have perfect relationships specifically because there is no man involved in the situation. This idea of a \"lesbian utopia\" makes it more difficult for lesbians to report domestic violence, because often people don't believe it can be true.\n\nGay men may feel that being battered is a threat to their [[masculinity]], and thus are hesitant to report domestic violence. Some abusers may frame the abuse as simply an \"expression of masculinity,\" which normalizes the physical violence.\n\nThere are several problems with data collection about domestic violence in same-sex relationships, including lack of reporting, biased sampling, and lack of interest in studying same-sex domestic violence. For example, if samples are taken at a center that caters to LGBT individuals, the results may be unregularly high, as those who use these services may also be those in need of help, or unregularly low, as abusers often limit their partner's exposure to others, especially those who may recognize their relationship as abusive.\n\nThe [[National Coalition of Anti-Violence Programs]] (AVP) is an organization which \"works to prevent, respond to, and end all forms of violence against and within LGBTQ communities.\" This organization has member organization in 26 U.S. states, Washington D.C., and [[Canada]], which help connect people to resources when they have been abused in a same-sex relationship, been sexually assaulted, or been a victim of a homophobic [[hate crime]].\n\nCUAV is an organization based in [[San Francisco]] that has a broad mission of seeking to track [[Violence against LGBT people|anti-LGBT violence]] and offer support to those affected by it. They offer [[support group]]s and counselling for those who are victims of same-sex domestic violence.\n\n\"The Network\" seeks to advocate for victims of same-sex domestic violence within the state of [[New York (state)|New York]], and hope that through supporting victims of same-sex domestic violence in the social and political realm that they will then have greater access to resources that victims of domestic violence may need.\n\nThe Montrose Center is an organization in [[Houston]], Texas that began as a counselling center for LGBT individuals. The Montrose Center offers many services to LGBT individuals, including servicing victims of domestic violence by finding them housing and providing counselling. Although there are other domestic violence shelters in the Houston area, the Montrose Center feels like they can cater better to men, transgender individuals, and lesbian victims of domestic violence.\n\n[[Category:Domestic violence]]\n[[Category:Same-sex relationship]]\n[[Category:Violence against LGBT people]]"}

Ray Lankester (Lester 1995). His father was a builder.\n\nEdwin married Phebe Pope in 1845, daughter of a former mill-owner. She was 19 at the time of marriage, became a botanist and microscopist, published books for children and wrote natural history articles. They had a total of eleven children of whom eight survived – four boys and four girls. Thomas Henry Huxley became a close friend of the family, and visited often. John Stevens Henslow, Darwin's tutor, was also a family friend. A born teacher, he introduced Edwin's son Ray to the delights of fossil collecting. Through his association with East Suffolk and his friendship with Henslow, Lankester became an early and active Honorary Member of the Ipswich Museum, of which his son Ray Lankester was afterwards President (1901–1929).\n\nE. B. Ford, the ecological geneticist, said of Edwin: \n\"Lankester was a close personal friend of Darwin's and was so deeply impressed by him that he was determined that one of his sons should become a great biologist, He named all three of his sons suitably: Forbes, Ray and Owen!\" (p. 338 in Mayr and Provine). \nBut, alas for this excellent story, Edwin had another son, his second, whom he named Rushton. Rushton emigrated to Java, married, and raised a family, the only one of Edwin's offspring to do so. The lack of productivity in this otherwise capable family was distinctly unusual at that time.\n\nApprenticed at first to a Mr. Ginney, a surgeon of Woodbridge, in 1832 he became Assistant to Thomas Spurgin of Saffron Walden. Spurgin raised £300 to enable Edwin to study medicine and science from 1834–7 at the new University College London. He attended lectures by John Lindley (botany) and Robert Edmund Grant (zoology) – to whose post Edwin's eldest son E. Ray Lankester succeeded in 1875. Grant had been one of Darwin's tutors at Edinburgh. Edwin's friends at UCL included William Jenner and William Benjamin Carpenter.\n\nEdwin could not afford a complete degree course, so qualified as MRCS and Licentiate of the Society of Apothecaries. In 1837 he moved to Doncaster to become resident medical attendant and science tutor to the Woods family of Campsall Hall, recommended by Lindley. The Woods family were \"indifferent to religion and fervent Owenites\" as he mentioned in a letter home. Robert Owen actually visited Campsall Hall, and Lankester described the event in his diary.\n\nIn 1839 Lankester left the Woods and travelled to Heidelberg to take his M.D., which he got in six months. Back in London, he befriended Edward Forbes and Arthur Henfrey, the botanist. He practised medicine and wrote articles on botany, medicine and surgery for the Penny Cyclopaedia. He contributed to the Biographical Dictionary, and wrote for other journals. As time went by, he became ever more fully absorbed in natural history.\n\nIn 1841 his study of sulphur bacteria (then the 'glairine of sulphurous waters') was noteworthy, as was his microscopic examination of drinking water. His book the \"Aquavivarium\" (1856) had a great vogue. He co-founded the important \"Quarterly Journal of Microscopical Science\" (QJMS) in 1853, and co-edited it with George Busk, and later with his son Ray. \"Half-hours with the microscope\" (1857) was a best-seller, reprinted until 1918.\n\nEdwin Lankester was President of the British Association for 25 years, and the founder of the Biological Section of the BA. He was present at the infamous Wilberforce-Huxley encounter in 1860. He was the first Secretary of the Ray Society, with his wife as Assistant Secretary. In 1845 he was President of the Royal Microscopical Society, and that same year he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society. Twenty years later he became the first President of the Quekett Microscopical Club.\n\nIn addition, Lankester also served as coroner for Central Middlesex, succeeding the first medically qualified coroner to take up the position, Dr Thomas Wakley, in 1862. Dr. Lankester, like his predecessor, contributed greatly to our knowledge on the social problem of infanticide in nineteenth century Britain by producing a series of 'statistically detailed Annual Reports' on the phenomenon.\n\nThe cause of London's cholera outbreaks had been identified by John Sutherland (1808–1891) and Dr John Snow (1813–1858; author of the famous map of water pumps near Broad Street) the matter was not decided until Lankester established a committee to look into the latest outbreak. The Committee's report (1854) had sections written by Snow and the Reverend Henry Whitehead, a local curate. They reached the conclusion that the outbreak was attributable to the use of impure water from the well in Broad Street.\n\nIn 1866, twelve years after the event, Dr. Lankester wrote \"The Board of Guardians met to consult what ought to be done. Of that meeting, the late Dr. Snow demanded an audience. He was admitted and gave it as his opinion that the pump in Broad Street, and that pump alone, was the cause of all the pestilence. He was not believed: not a member of his own profession, not an individual in the parish believed that Snow was right. But the pump was closed nevertheless and the plague was stayed.\"\n\nLankester later became the first Medical Officer of Health for the St. James's district, the area where the outbreak occurred. It still took years before the public authorities acted to ensure the purity of water supply; Snow had been dead for over 30 years when the Chief Medical Office of Health at last acknowledged that his work on the transmission of cholera was one of the most significant medical discoveries of the 19th century.\n\nLankester's interest in this (beyond simple humanity) came through his microscopical examination of water, which is even today one of the standard tests of drinking water quality.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "16748557", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16748557", "title": "European Union as an emerging superpower", "text": "European Union as an emerging superpower\n\nThe European Union (EU) has been called an emerging superpower by scholars and academics like T. R. Reid, Andrew Reding, Andrew Moravcsik, Mark Leonard, Jeremy Rifkin, John McCormick, and some politicians like Romano Prodi and Tony Blair, They believe that the EU is a superpower, or will become one, in the 21st century while noting that the concept of \"superpower\" has changed to one of soft power rather than the hard (military) superpowers of the 20th century. Others have challenged their views.\n\nMark Leonard cites several factors: the EU's large population, large economy (the EU has the largest economy in the world in terms of nominal GDP), low inflation rates, the unpopularity and perceived failure of US foreign policy in recent years. He compares this with the high quality of life (especially when measured in terms such as hours worked per week, health care, social services) of certain EU member states.\n\nJohn McCormick believes that the EU has already achieved superpower status, based on the size and global reach of its economy and on its global political influence. He argues that the nature of power has changed since the Cold War-driven definition of superpower was developed, and that military power is no longer essential to great power; he argues that control of the means of production is more important than control of the means of destruction, and contrasts the threatening hard power of the United States with the opportunities offered by the soft power wielded by the European Union.\n\nParag Khanna believes that \"Europe is overtaking its rivals to become the world's most successful empire.\" Khanna writes that South America, East Asia, and other regions prefer to emulate the \"European Dream\" rather than the American variant. This could possibly be seen in the African Union and UNASUR. Notably, the EU as a whole has some of the world's largest and most influential languages being official within its borders.\n\nAndrew Reding also takes the future EU enlargement into account. An eventual future accession of the rest of Europe, the whole of Russia, and Turkey, would not only boost the economy of the EU, but it would also increase the EU's population to about 800 million, which he considers almost equal to that of India or China. The EU is qualitatively different from India and China since it is enormously more prosperous and technologically advanced. Turkish PM Recep Tayyip Erdoğan said in 2005: \"In 10 or 15 years, the EU will be a place where civilizations meet. It will be a superpower with the inclusion of Turkey.\"\n\nRobert J. Guttman wrote in 2001 that the very definition of the term superpower has changed and in the 21st century, it does not only refer to states with military power, but also to groups such as the European Union, with strong market economics, young, highly educated workers savvy in high technology, and a global vision. Friis Arne Petersen, the Danish ambassador to the US, has expressed similar views. He conceded that the EU is a \"special kind of superpower,\" one that has yet to establish a unified military force that exerts itself even close to the same level as many of its individual members.\n\nAdditionally, it is argued by commentators that full political integration is not required for the European Union to wield international influence: that its apparent weaknesses constitute its real strengths (as of its low profile diplomacy and the emphasis on the rule of law) and that the EU represents a new and potentially more successful type of international actor than traditional ones; however, it is uncertain if the effectiveness of such an influence would be equal to that of a more politically integrated union of states such as the United States.\n\nBarry Buzan notes that the EU's potential superpower status depends on its \"stateness\". It is unclear though how much state-like quality is needed for the EU to be described as a superpower. Buzan states that the EU is unlikely to remain a potential superpower for a long time because although it has material wealth, its \"political weakness and its erratic and difficult course of internal political development, particularly as regards a common foreign and defence policy\" constrains it from being a superpower.\n\nAlexander Stubb, the Finnish Minister for Foreign Affairs, has said that he thinks the EU is both a superpower and not a superpower. While the EU is a superpower in the sense that it is the largest political union, single market and aid donor in the world, it is not a superpower in the defense or foreign policy spheres. Like Barry Buzan, Alexander Stubb thinks that the most major factor constraining the EU's rise to superpower status is its lack of statehood in the international system, other factors are its lack of internal drive to project power worldwide, and continued preference for the sovereign nation-state among some Europeans. To counterbalance these, he urged the EU leaders to approve and ratify the Lisbon Treaty (which they did in 2009), create an EU foreign ministry (EEAS, established in 2010), develop a common EU defense, hold one collective seat at the UN Security Council and G8, and address what he described as the \"sour mood\" toward the EU prevalent in some European countries today.\n\nSome do not believe that the EU will achieve superpower status. \"The EU is not and never will be a superpower\" according to the former UK Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs David Miliband. EU parliamentarian Ilka Schroeder argues that conflicts such as the Israeli–Palestinian dispute see close EU involvement largely to compensate for European inability to project military power internationally.\n\n\"The Economist\"'s Robert Lane Greene notes that the lack of a strong European military only exacerbates the lack of unified EU foreign policy and discounts any EU arguments towards superpower status, noting especially that the EU's creation of a global response force rivaling the superpower's (United States of America) is \"unthinkable.\" \"The biggest barrier to European superpowerdom is that European elites refuse to bring their postmodern fantasies about the illegitimacy of military 'hard power' into line with the way the rest of the world interprets reality\" according to Soren Kern of Strategic Studies Group.\n\nBritain's Michael Howard has warned against the \"worry\" that many Europeans are pushing for greater EU integration to counterbalance the United States, while Europe's total reliance on soft (non-military) power is in part because of its lack of a \"shared identity.\" While to some the European Union should be a \"model power\" unafraid of using military force and backing free trade, its military shortcomings argue against superpower status.\n\nGeorge Osborne, the British Chancellor of the Exchequer at the time, has also pointed to what he saw as an economic crisis of the European Union. In 2014, Osborne said: \"The biggest economic risk facing Europe doesn't come from those who want reform and re-negotiation. It comes from a failure to reform and renegotiate. It is the status quo which condemns the people of Europe to an ongoing economic crisis and continuing decline.\" Osborne also said that the EU is facing growing competition with global economic powers like China, India and the US, and the European Union should \"reform or decline.\"\n\n"}

{"id": "329116", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=329116", "title": "Freddy Krueger", "text": "Freddy Krueger\n\nFrederick Charles \"Freddy\" Krueger () is a character from the \"A Nightmare on Elm Street\" film series. He first appeared in Wes Craven's \"A Nightmare on Elm Street\" (1984) as a burnt serial killer who uses a gloved hand with razors to kill his victims in their dreams, causing their deaths in the real world as well. In the dream world, he is a powerful force and almost completely invulnerable. However, whenever Freddy is pulled into the real world, he has normal human vulnerabilities.\n\nKrueger was created by Wes Craven and had been consistently portrayed by Robert Englund since his first appearance. In the 2010 franchise reboot, he was portrayed by Jackie Earle Haley. In 2011, Freddy appeared as a playable character in the video game \"Mortal Kombat\". Over the course of the series, Freddy has battled numerous survivors including Nancy Thompson.\n\nIn the \"Nightmares on Elm Street\" comics, a popular alias is used, known as The Springwood Slasher.\n\nFreddy is a \"tantabus\" (latin: nightmare) demon who attacks his victims from within their dreams. He is commonly identified by his burned, disfigured face, red-and-green striped sweater, brown fedora, and trademark metal-clawed brown leather glove only on his right hand. This glove was the product of Krueger's own imagination, the blades having been welded by himself. Robert Englund has said many times that he feels the character represents neglect, particularly that suffered by children. The character also more broadly represents subconscious fears.\n\n\"Wizard\" magazine rated Freddy the 14th greatest villain, the British television channel Sky2 listed him 8th, and the American Film Institute ranked him 40th on its \"AFI's 100 Years...100 Heroes & Villains\" list. In 2010, Freddy won an award for Best Villain (formerly Most Vile Villain) at the Scream Awards.\n\nFreddy is introduced in \"A Nightmare on Elm Street\" as a child killer who is eventually captured, but is let off due to a technicality (the search warrant wasn't signed in the right place). He is hunted down by a mob of angry parents and cornered in a boiler room where he used to take his victims. The mob douses the building with gasoline and sets it on fire, burning Krueger alive. While his body dies, his spirit lives on in the dreams of a group of teenagers living in his old neighborhood, whom he preys on by entering their dreams and killing them. He is apparently destroyed at the end of the film by protagonist Nancy Thompson, but the last scene reveals that he has survived. He goes on to antagonize the teenage protagonists of the next five films in the series.\n\nIn \"\", more of Freddy's backstory is revealed by the mysterious nun who repeatedly appears to Dr. Gordon. Freddy's mother, Amanda Krueger, was a nurse at the asylum featured in the film. At the time she worked there, a largely abandoned, run-down wing of the asylum was used to lock up entire hordes of the most insane criminals all at once. When Amanda was young, she was accidentally locked into the room with the criminals over a holiday weekend. They managed to keep her hidden for days, raping her repeatedly. When she was finally discovered, she was barely alive and was pregnant with the future Freddy Krueger. Later, in \"\", reveals that Krueger has a daughter, Katherine, who seeks to end her father's horrific legacy once and for all.\n\nAfter a hiatus after the release of \"The Final Nightmare\", Krueger was brought back in \"Wes Craven's New Nightmare\" by Wes Craven, who had not worked on the film series since the third film, \"Dream Warriors\". Robert Englund, who portrayed Krueger throughout the film series and its television spin-off, also took the role as a fictional version of himself in \"New Nightmare\"; it is implied that Englund was stalked by his character, who is an ancient demonic entity that took on the form of Wes Craven's creation, and has come to life from the film franchise's fictitious world. Englund describes to his former co-star and friend Heather Langenkamp that this embodiment of Freddy is being darker and more evil than he portrayed in their films; he struggles to keep his sanity intact from Krueger's torments, and goes into hiding with his family. Krueger sees Langenkanp as his primary foe as the result of her character Nancy Thompson who was the first to defeat him, and his attempts to crossover to reality causes a series of earthquakes throughout Los Angeles County. After Langenkamp succeeds in defeating the entity and apparently destroys him, however it is referred by Krueger's creator that it is imprisoned to the fictitious world over again.\n\nIn 2003, Freddy battled fellow horror icon Jason Voorhees from the \"Friday the 13th\" film series in the theatrical release \"Freddy vs. Jason\", a film which officially resurrected both characters from their respective deaths and subsequently sent them to Hell. The ending of the film is left ambiguous as to whether or not Freddy is actually dead; despite being decapitated, as a head he looks back and winks at the viewers. A sequel featuring Ash Williams from \"The Evil Dead\" franchise was planned, but never materialized onscreen. It was later turned into Dynamite Entertainment's comic book series \"Freddy vs. Jason vs. Ash\".\n\nIn the 2010 remake of the original film, it is suggested that Freddy is a child molester who had sexually abused the teenage protagonists of the film when they were young children. When their parents found out, they trapped him in a building and set it on fire, killing him. As a spirit, he took his revenge on the teenagers by haunting their dreams for alerting their parents.\n\nRobert Englund continued his role as Krueger on October 9, 1988, in the television anthology series, \"Freddy's Nightmares\". The show was hosted by Freddy, who did not take direct part in most of the episodes, but he did show up occasionally to influence the plot of particular episodes. Further, a consistent theme in each episode was characters having disturbing dreams. The series ran for two seasons, 44 episodes, ending March 10, 1990. Although most of the episodes did not feature Freddy taking a major role in the plot, the pilot episode, \"No More, Mr. Nice Guy\", depicts the events of his trial, and his subsequent death at the hands of the parents of Elm Street after his acquittal. In \"No More, Mr. Nice Guy\", though Freddy's case seems open and shut, a mistrial is declared based on the arresting officer, Lt. Tim Blocker, not reading Krueger his Miranda rights, which is different from the original \"Nightmare\" that stated he was released because someone forgot to sign a search warrant in the right place. The episode also reveals that Krueger used an ice cream van to lure children close enough so that he could kidnap and kill them. After the town's parents burn Freddy to death he returns to haunt Blocker in his dreams. Freddy gets his revenge when Blocker is put to sleep at the dentist's office, and Freddy shows up and kills him. The episode \"Sister's Keeper\" was a \"sequel\" to this episode, even though it was the seventh episode of the series. The episode follows Krueger as he terrorizes the Blocker twins, the identical twin daughters of Lt. Tim Blocker, and frames one sister for the other's murder. Season two's \"It's My Party And You'll Die If I Want You To\" featured Freddy attacking a high school prom date who stood him up twenty years earlier. He got his revenge with his desire being fulfilled in the process.\n\nThe character returned to television in an episode of \"The Goldbergs\" titled \"Mister Knifey-Hands\" with Englund reprising his role in a cameo.\n\nFreddy's first video game appearance was in the Nintendo Entertainment System's 1989 game \"A Nightmare on Elm Street\". The game was published by LJN Toys and developed by Rare.\n\nA second game for the Commodore 64 and DOS-based computers was also released in 1989 released by Monarch Software and developed by Westwood Associates.\n\nFreddy Krueger appeared as a downloadable playable character for \"Mortal Kombat\" (2011), with Robert Englund reprising his role. He has become the second non-\"Mortal Kombat\" character to appear in the game with the other being Kratos from the \"God of War\" series (who was an exclusive character for the PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Vita versions, while Freddy was available across all versions of the game). The game depicts Krueger as a malevolent spirit inhibating the Dream Realm who attacks Shao Kahn for \"stealing\" the souls of his potential victims. During the fight, he is pulled into the game's fictional depiction of the real world. The injured Krueger arms himself with two razor claws to continue to battle Kahn. Upon defeating him, Krueger is sent back to the Dream Realm by Nightwolf, where he continues to haunt the dreams of his human prey. In an interview with PlayStation.Blog, \"Mortal Kombat\" co-creator Ed Boon cited the character's violent nature and iconic status as reasoning for the inclusion in the game, \"Over the years, we’ve certainly had a number of conversations about guest characters. At one point, we had a conversation about having a group — imagine Freddy, Jason, Michael Myers, Leatherface from \"Texas Chainsaw Massacre\". We never got a grip on how we would do it, whether they’d be DLC characters or what. We also wanted to introduce a character who was unexpected. This DLC thing opens the doors to realizing these ideas.\" Krueger went on to become playable in the mobile edition of the game's sequel, \"Mortal Kombat X\", alongside Jason from \"Friday the 13th\".\n\nIn October 2017, Krueger was released as a downloadable playable character in the seventh chapter of the asymmetric survival horror game \"Dead by Daylight\", alongside Quentin Smith. The events of the chapter are set immediately following Nancy Holbrook's escape from Krueger, after which he targets Quentin Smith as revenge for aiding her. Invading Smith's dreams, he forces him to go to the Badham Preschool, where the two are unwittingly taken to the universe of \"Dead by Daylight\" by an unseen force.\n\nAt Six Flags St Louis' Fright Fest event (then known as Fright Nights), Krueger was the main character for the event's first year in 1988. He reappeared in his own haunted house, Freddy's Nightmare: The Haunted House on Elm Street, for the following two years.\n\nFreddy Krueger appeared alongside Jason Voorhees and Leatherface as minor icons during Halloween Horror Nights 17 and again with Jason during Halloween Horror Nights 25 at Universal Orlando Resort and Universal Studios Hollywood. In 2016, Freddy Krueger returned to Halloween Horror Nights, along with Jason, in Hollywood.\n\nWes Craven said his inspiration for the basis of Freddy Krueger's power stemmed from several stories in the \"Los Angeles Times\" about a series of mysterious deaths: All the victims had reported recurring nightmares and died in their sleep. Additionally, Craven's original script characterized Freddy as a child molester, which Craven said was the \"worst thing\" he could think of. The decision was made to instead make him a child murderer in order to avoid being accused of exploiting the spate of highly publicized child molestation cases in California around the time \"A Nightmare on Elm Street\" went into production. Craven's inspirations for the character included a bully from his school during his youth, a disfigured homeless man who had frightened him when he was 11, and the 1970s pop song \"Dream Weaver\" by Gary Wright. In an interview, he said, \"When I looked down there was a man very much like Freddy walking along the sidewalk. He must have sensed that someone was looking at him and stopped and looked right into my face. He scared the living daylights out of me, so I jumped back into the shadows. I waited and waited to hear him walk away. Finally I thought he must have gone, so I stepped back to the window. The guy was not only still looking at me but he thrust his head forward as if to say, 'Yes, I'm still looking at you.' The man walked towards the apartment building's entrance. I ran through the apartment to our front door as he was walking into our building on the lower floor. I heard him starting up the stairs. My brother, who is ten years older than me, got a baseball bat and went out to the corridor but he was gone.\"\n\nFreddy's back story is revealed gradually throughout the series. In \"\", the protagonists learn that Freddy's mother, Amanda Krueger, was a nun who worked in Westin Hills mental hospital caring for the inmates. Freddy was conceived when she was accidentally locked inside over the Christmas holiday and gang-raped by a group of the inmates, thus making him \"the bastard son of 100 maniacs\". \"\" depicts Freddy's traumatic childhood; he displayed sociopathic behavior at a young age and was often teased by classmates. He was adopted as a child by an abusive alcoholic named Mr. Underwood, who teaches him how to torture animals and inflict pain on himself. Freddy eventually murders him, with no apparent consequences, and becomes a serial killer.\n\nIn \"Wes Craven's New Nightmare\", Freddy is characterized as a symbol of something powerful and ancient, and is given more stature and muscles. Unlike the six movies before it, \"New Nightmare\" shows Freddy as closer to what Wes Craven originally intended, toning down his comedic side while strengthening the more menacing aspects of his character.\n\nThroughout the series, Freddy's potential victims often experience dreams of young children, jumping rope and chanting a rhyme to the tune of \"One, Two, Buckle My Shoe\" with the lyrics changed to \"One, Two, Freddy's coming for you\", often as an omen to Freddy's presence or a precursor to his attacks.\n\nIn the 2010 remake of \"A Nightmare On Elm Street\", Jackie Earle Haley portrayed Freddy Krueger. In the film, Krueger is depicted as a child abuser who worked as a gardener at a local preschool. Unlike in the original version of events, where he was a known child-killer who evaded conviction on a technicality, in this version of events there was actually ambiguity about Kruger's guilt or innocence apart from the testimony of his victims, until the now-grown survivors find the room where Krueger molested them while searching for evidence.\n\nFreddy Krueger's physical appearance has remained largely consistent throughout the film series, although minor changes were made in subsequent films. He wears a striped red-and-green sweater (solid red sleeves in the original film), a dark brown fedora, his bladed glove, loose black trousers (brown in the original film), and worn work boots, in keeping with his blue collar background. His skin is scarred and burned as a result of being burned alive by the parents of Springwood, and he has no hair at all on his head as it presumably all burned off. In the original film, only Freddy's face was burned, while the scars have spread to the rest of his body from the second film onwards. His blood is occasionally a dark, oily color, or greenish in hue when he is in the Dreamworld. In the original film, Freddy remains in the shadows and under lower light much longer than he does in the later pictures. In the second film, there are some scenes where Freddy is shown without his bladed glove, and instead with the blades protruding from the tips of his fingers. As the films began to emphasize the comedic, wise-cracking aspect of the character, he began to don various costumes and take on other forms, such as dressing as a waiter or wearing a Superman inspired version of his sweater with a cape (The Dream Child), appearing as a video game sprite (Freddy's Dead), a giant snake-like creature (Dream Warriors), and a hookah smoking caterpillar (Freddy vs. Jason).\n\nIn \"New Nightmare\", Freddy's appearance is updated considerably, giving him a green fedora that matched his sweater stripes, skin-tight leather pants, knee-high black boots, a turtleneck version of his trademark sweater, a black trench coat, and a fifth claw on his glove, which also has a far more organic appearance, resembling the exposed muscle tissue of an actual hand. Freddy also has fewer burns on his face, though these are more severe, with his muscle tissue exposed in numerous places. Compared to his other incarnations, this Freddy's injuries are more like those of an actual burn victim. For the 2010 remake, Freddy is returned to his iconic attire, but the burns on his face are intensified with further bleaching of the skin and exposed facial tissue on the left cheek, more reminiscent of actual third degree burns than in the original series.\n\nWes Craven stated that part of the inspiration for Freddy's infamous bladed glove was from his cat, as he watched it claw the side of his couch one night.\n\nIn an interview he said, \"Part of it was an objective goal to make the character memorable, since it seems that every character that has been successful has had some kind of unique weapon, whether it be a chain saw or a machete, etc. I was also looking for a primal fear which is embedded in the subconscious of people of all cultures. One of those is the fear of teeth being broken, which I used in my first film. Another is the claw of an animal, like a saber-toothed tiger reaching with its tremendous hooks. I transposed this into a human hand. The original script had the blades being fishing knives.\"\n\nWhen Jim Doyle, the creator of Freddy's claw, asked Craven what he wanted, Craven responded, \"It's kind of like really long fingernails, I want the glove to look like something that someone could make who has the skills of a boilermaker.\" Doyle explained, \"Then we hunted around for knives. We picked out this bizarre-looking steak knife, we thought that this looked really cool, we thought it would look even cooler if we turned it over and used it upside down. We had to remove the back edge and put another edge on it, because we were actually using the knife upside down.\" Later Doyle had three duplicates of the glove made, two of which were used as stunt gloves in long shots.\n\nFor \"New Nightmare\", Lou Carlucci, the effects coordinator, remodeled Freddy's glove for a more \"organic look\". He says, \"I did the original glove on the first \"Nightmare\" and we deliberately made that rough and primitive looking, like something that would be constructed in somebody's home workshop. Since this is supposed to be a new look for Freddy, Craven and everybody involved decided that the glove should be different. This hand has more muscle and bone texture to it, the blades are shinier and in one case, are retractable. Everything about this glove has a much cleaner look to it, it's more a natural part of his hand than a glove.\" The new glove has five claws.\n\nIn the 2010 remake, the glove is redesigned as a metal gauntlet with four finger bars, but it is patterned after its original design.\n\nFreddy's glove appeared in the 1987 horror-comedy \"Evil Dead II\" above the door on the inside of a toolshed. This was Sam Raimi's response to Wes Craven showing footage of \"The Evil Dead\" in \"A Nightmare on Elm Street\", which in turn was a response to Sam Raimi putting a poster of Craven's 1977 film \"The Hills Have Eyes\" in \"The Evil Dead\". The glove also appears in the 1998 horror-comedy \"Bride of Chucky\" in an evidence locker room that also contains the remains of the film's villain Chucky, the chainsaw of Leatherface from \"The Texas Chainsaw Massacre\", and the masks of Michael Myers from \"Halloween\" and Jason Voorhees from \"Friday the 13th\".\n\nAt the end of the film \"\", the mask of the title character, Jason Voorhees, played by Kane Hodder, is dragged under the earth by Freddy's gloved hand, thus setting up \"Freddy vs. Jason\". Freddy's gloved hand, in the ending, was played by Hodder.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "15620079", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15620079", "title": "Gene knock-in", "text": "Gene knock-in\n\nIn molecular cloning and biology, a knock-in (or gene knock-in) refers to a genetic engineering method that involves the one-for-one substitution of DNA sequence information in a genetic locus or the insertion of sequence information not found within the locus. Typically, this is done in mice since the technology for this process is more refined and there is a high degree of shared sequence complexity between mice and humans. The difference between knock-in technology and traditional transgenic techniques is that a knock-in involves a gene inserted into a specific locus, and is thus a \"targeted\" insertion.\n\nA common use of knock-in technology is for the creation of disease models. It is a technique by which scientific investigators may study the function of the regulatory machinery (e.g. promoters) that governs the expression of the natural gene being replaced. This is accomplished by observing the new phenotype of the organism in question. The BACs and YACs are used in this case so that large fragments can be transferred.\n\nGene knock-in originated as a slight modification of the original knockout technique developed by Martin Evans, Oliver Smithies, and Mario Capecchi. Traditionally, knock-in techniques have relied on homologous recombination to drive targeted gene replacement, although other methods using a transposon-mediated system to insert the target gene have been developed. The use of \"loxP\" flanking sites that become excised upon expression of Cre recombinase with gene vectors is an example of this. Embryonic stem cells with the modification of interest are then implanted into a viable blastocyst, which will grow into a mature chimeric mouse with some cells having the original blastocyst cell genetic information and other cells having the modifications introduced to the embryonic stem cells. Subsequent offspring of the chimeric mouse will then have the gene knock-in.\n\nGene knock-in has allowed, for the first time, hypothesis-driven studies on gene modifications and resultant phenotypes. Mutations in the human p53 gene, for example, can be induced by exposure to benzo(a)pyrene and the mutated copy of the p53 gene can be inserted into mouse genomes. Lung tumors observed in the knock-in mice offer support for the hypothesis of BaP’s carcinogenicity. More recent developments in knock-in technique have allowed for pigs to have a gene for green fluorescent protein inserted with a CRISPR/Cas9 system, which allows for much more accurate and successful gene insertions. The speed of CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene knock-in also allows for biallelic modifications to some genes to be generated and the phenotype in mice observed in a single generation, an unprecedented timeframe.\n\nKnock-in technology is different from knockout technology in that knockout technology aims to either delete part of the DNA sequence or insert irrelevant DNA sequence information to disrupt the expression of a specific genetic locus. Gene knock-in technology, on the other hand, alters the genetic locus of interest via a one-for-one substitution of DNA sequence information or by the addition of sequence information that is not found on said genetic locus. A gene knock-in therefore can be seen as a gain of function mutation and a gene knockout a loss of function mutation, but a gene knock-in may also involve the substitution of a functional gene locus for a mutant phenotype that results in some loss of function.\n\nBecause of the success of gene knock-in methods thus far, many clinical applications can be envisioned. Knock-in of sections of the human immunoglobulin gene into mice has already been shown to allow them to produce humanized antibodies that are therapeutically useful. It should be possible to modify stem cells in humans to restore targeted gene function in certain tissues, for example possibly correcting the mutant gamma-chain gene of the IL-2 receptor in hematopoietic stem cells to restore lymphocyte development in people with X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency.\n\nWhile gene knock-in technology has proven to be a powerful technique for the generation of models of human disease and insight into proteins \"in vivo\", numerous limitations still exist. Many of these are shared with the limitations of knockout technology. First, combinations of knock-in genes lead to growing complexity in the interactions that inserted genes and their products have with other sections of the genome and can therefore lead to more side effects and difficult-to-explain phenotypes. Also, only a few loci, such as the ROSA26 locus have been characterized well enough where they can be used for conditional gene knock-ins, making combinations of reporter and transgenes in the same locus problematic. The biggest disadvantage of using gene knock-in for human disease model generation is that mouse physiology is not identical to that of humans and human orthologs of proteins expressed in mice will often not wholly reflect the role of a gene in human pathology. This can be seen in mice produced with the ΔF508 fibrosis mutation in the CFTR gene, which accounts for more than 70% of the mutations in this gene for the human population and leads to cystic fibrosis. While ΔF508 CF mice do exhibit the processing defects characteristic of the human mutation, they do not display the pulmonary pathophysiological changes seen in humans and carry virtually no lung phenotype. Such problems could be ameliorated by the use of a variety of animal models, and pig models (pig lungs share many biochemical and physiological similarities with human lungs) have been generated in an attempt to better explain the activity of the ΔF508 mutation.\n\n\n"}

These fossils included taxa such as \"Glyphea\" (from which the group takes its name), and \"Mecochirus\", mostly with elongated (often semichelate) chelipeds. This group of decapods is a good example of a living fossil, or a lazarus taxon, since until their discovery in the 1970s, the group was considered to have become extinct in the Eocene. The superfamily Glypheoidea comprises five families. The two extant species, \"Neoglyphea inopinata\" and \"Laurentaeglyphea neocaledonica\", are both in the Glypheidae.\n\nThe first animals attributable to the Glypheoidea appeared in the Permo-Triassic. They were abundant in the Jurassic, but declined from the Cretaceous to the Eocene.\n\nThe Glypheoidea was originally considered to be a purely fossil group. That opinion had to be altered when a single male specimen was discovered in the collections of the Smithsonian Institution in 1975. It had been caught off the Philippines in 1908 and preserved, without its full significance being realised. Over sixty years later, the specimen was rediscovered, and described by two French scientists as a new genus and species, \"Neoglyphea inopinata\" in 1975, meaning \"unexpected new \"Glyphea\"\". More individuals were caught on subsequent expeditions in 1976, 1980 and 1985, allowing for a complete description. A second species was discovered in the Coral Sea, near New Caledonia, in 2005. First described as \"Neoglyphea neocaledonica\", in 2006, it has been transferred to a new genus \"Laurentaeglyphea\", much closer to fossil forms.\n\nFive families are recognised, containing a total of 21 genera, all but two of which are extinct (extant taxa marked in boldface):\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "801766", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=801766", "title": "Hammerhead (comics)", "text": "Hammerhead (comics)\n\nHammerhead is a fictional supervillain appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. He is primarily an enemy of Spider-Man and a member of organized crime who exists in Marvel's main shared universe, known as the Marvel Universe.\n\nHe is closely associated with the \"Hammerhead Family\", a Maggia crime family. Hammerhead distinguishes himself from other villains in that he dresses up and acts somewhat like a gangster from the 1920s. Due to an injury he suffered, much of his skull was replaced with an unbendable steel alloy by Jonas Harrow, giving his head a flattened shape.\n\nHammerhead made his first appearance in \"The Amazing Spider-Man\" #113, and was created by writer Gerry Conway and artist John Romita Sr. Conway recalled that Hammerhead \"was most directly influenced by the Big Man and the Crime-Master, who were among the first villains in \"Amazing Spider-Man\". One of the more interesting things Stan [Lee], Jack Kirby, and, of course, Steve Ditko did was combining the two different kinds of milieus: superhero and \"Dick Tracy\", with the unusual criminal characters who had some kind of physical deformity. ... Plus, Hammerhead - I liked [the] name, and John Romita came up with an interesting look.\n\nHammerhead's family immigrated from the Soviet Union to Italy when he was a child. He got help from a man named The General. His father ran a garage in Toirrano, where he insisted the young man speak only in Russian, beating him severely with a mallet when he would not. Though not much is known about his life before he became an evil criminal and supervillain, he is known to have a sister.\n\nAll the while, Hammerhead dreamed of becoming a gangster. He is eventually recruited into one of the \"families\" of the criminal organization known as the Maggia when a member oversees Hammerhead murdering a childhood bully and his girlfriend in a theater showing \"The Godfather Part II\". Originally a small-time hitman, Hammerhead quickly rises through the ranks of the Maggia, while hiding the fact that he is actually Russian so he can be \"made\". In his final test, Hammerhead is brought to his father's garage (with the Maggia apparently unaware of their relationship), where he proceeds to kill his father, while telling him in Russian that he does not truly hate him, and that he made him (Hammerhead) this way.\n\nOne day, Hammerhead was found beaten, disfigured, and delirious with pain in an alley in New York City's Bowery by Jonas Harrow, a surgeon who had lost his medical license due to his illegal experiments. Seeing the opportunity both to save this man's life and to redeem his reputation, Harrow operated on the gunman for three days, replacing much of his shattered skull with a strong steel alloy. During the surgery, the unconscious thug fixated on the only memory he retained: an image of a poster for a movie called \"The Al Capone Mob\", which was hanging in the alley where he lay beaten and bloodied before Harrow found him. When he recovered, the memory of the poster and its images of 1930s-era gangsters prompted Hammerhead to start a gang of his own in the style of Capone and other mobsters of the 1920s. He even dressed as if he were living in that decade. Later on, Hammerhead's entire skull was replaced with or reinforced with some type of nearly unbreakable metal (possibly vibranium or secondary adamantium).\n\nA gang war broke out between Hammerhead's mob and Doctor Octopus's criminal organization. Hammerhead was forced to flee the country due to Spider-Man's interference. He later had a rematch with Doctor Octopus next to an atomic breeder reactor on a remote Canadian island which caused a chain reaction, blasting Hammerhead \"out of phase\" with this dimension. Some time later, he appeared as an immaterial ghost-like being to haunt Doctor Octopus. Doctor Octopus then unwittingly restored Hammerhead to his material form. Hammerhead kidnapped Spider-Man's Aunt May, who was then rescued by Spider-Man as Doctor Octopus caused Hammerhead's helicopter to plummet into the Hudson River.\n\nHammerhead then proposed that all Maggia \"families\" unite under his leadership. Wearing a strength-enhancing exoskeleton, he battled the Human Torch who then fused the exoskeleton's power pack. Hammerhead was nearly assassinated by the Kingpin's Arranger during a gang war. Hammerhead was forced out of a major role in New York City organized crime by the Kingpin.\n\nHammerhead then allied himself with the Chameleon in the latter's bid to become the new crime lord of New York City. The two served as partners in a splinter group of the Maggia. Hammerhead hired Tombstone as a bodyguard and hitman. He hired the Hobgoblin to kill Joe Robertson, who posed a threat to Tombstone; the assassination attempt failed. Hammerhead was kidnapped and beaten by Tombstone, who had gained superhuman powers and resented Hammerhead for not sending him to kill Joe Robertson.\n\nHammerhead later attended a Las Vegas crime conference to divide the resources left by the Kingpin's downfall at the time. Around this time he participates in a multi-sided gang-war focused on the Kingpin's attempt to re-take New York City for his own.\n\nHammerhead is a major player in underworld activities in the Marvel Universe and is highly sought after for elimination by the Punisher. He is currently one of several gang warlords struggling to control the criminal underworld in the major cities of the Eastern United States. During one of the first meetings of such warlords, Hammerhead was almost killed by the Strucker twins Fenris. This meeting was being manipulated by Baron Von Strucker, the head of HYDRA. When Don Fortunato made a bid for control of the New York underworld, Hammerhead opposed him and was almost killed as a result. When every other crime lord surrendered to Fortunato and his HYDRA allies, Hammerhead went rogue, launching a raid on Fortunato's home and successfully fighting off a HYDRA attack on his own headquarters. He did have assistance from Spider-Man and Morbius, the Living Vampire, however. For a time, the hero known as S.H.O.C. also assists Hammerhead. Later he was hired by Norman Osborn to be a part of the Sinister Twelve.\n\nDuring the events of the Civil War, Hammerhead used the vacuum left by the incarceration of the Kingpin to gain a greater foothold in the ranks of organized crime, attempting to organize an army of costumed villains (consisting of the Ani-Men V, Answer I, Aura, Bloodshed, Clown, Cyclone III, Discus, Electro, Great Gambonnos, Kangaroo II, Man Mountain Marko, Mauler, Mindblast, Override, Ringmaster, Stiletto, Spot, Squid, Slyde, Trapster, and Will O' The Wisp) to enforce his new criminal empire. When Slyde balked at the idea, Hammerhead had Underworld kill him to serve as a warning to anyone who did not join up with him. The Kingpin manipulated various hero factions, most notably S.H.I.E.L.D. and Iron Man into breaking up Hammerhead's first convening of his army. During the conflict, Hammerhead was shot numerous times by Underworld, who was revealed to be working for Kingpin. Underworld later confronted Hammerhead while he lay in prison. Underworld then shot Hammerhead at point-blank range with adamantium bullets.\n\nThe bullets, while not penetrating his skull, did cause severe trauma to his brain, resulting him in needing surgery, but the hospital he was brought to was unable to treat him. In mid-surgery however, men working for Mister Negative came in, killed the hospital staff, and took Hammerhead away. Mister Negative then has his surgeon Doctor Tramma revive Hammerhead and offers to transplant his brain into a new robotic adamantium skeleton, which Hammerhead agrees to.\n\nThe operation is a complete success, and Hammerhead is restored to full mobility without any ill effects. He swears loyalty to Mister Negative in exchange for his restored life, and proceeds to shape a gang of lowlife thugs into an effective army for his benefactor. He then proceeds to battle Spider-Man, besting him with no effort for the first time in years. Later, he has a rematch with Spider-Man, with Spider-Man dislocating Hammerhead's hip bone.\n\nMister Negative sends Hammerhead to help Spider-Man (who Mister Negative corrupted) take down the Hood, who launches an attack on Negative's headquarters. He blackmails H.A.M.M.E.R. director Norman Osborn into forcing the Hood to pull out of Chinatown.\n\nHammerhead later begins to doubt his loyalty to Mister Negative when Silvermane appears to return. Unknown to Hammerhead, it is actually an android controlled by Mysterio to plant seeds of rebellion. Nevertheless, he flees a shootout with the Maggia when the Silvermane robot calls him a traitor. It is shown that Mister Negative had a computer chip put in Hammerhead's head to deliver an electroshock when necessary, which he promptly uses to punish him and remind him who is in charge.\n\nDuring the \"Origin of the Species\" storyline, Hammerhead and Mister Negative are among the supervillains invited by Doctor Octopus to join his supervillain team, promising them that they will receive a reward in exchange for securing some specific items for him.\n\nAlongside his nephew and minions, Hammerhead formed an alliance with Black Cat where he sided with her gang.\n\nHammerhead has no superhuman abilities, yet his skull is now surgically reinforced with vibranium (or secondary adamantium), making his head flat on top; with this, he can charge and break through objects such as brick walls without causing any pain or damage to himself. This metal can absorb physical impacts that would otherwise fracture human bone. Hammerhead is in peak physical condition comparable to that of an Olympic-level athlete. He is a formidable hand-to-hand combatant whose most dangerous tactic is charging head first like a bull toward an opponent. Hammerhead once utilized a strength-enhancing exoskeleton designed by the Tinkerer.\n\nAfter an assassin's adamantium bullet penetrated a part of his head not protected by his adamantium skull, Hammerhead is surgically rebuilt by Mister Negative. Breakout surgeries replace the upper half of his skeleton with an adamantium endo-skeleton (the skeleton is shown to have a network of hydraulic servomechanisms). The upper portion of his body is now superhumanly strong as a result of the additional hidden cybernetic musculature, making him able to effortlessly beat a superpowered foe such as Spider-Man. Mister Negative does not use on Hammerhead the same Lord Dark Wind bonding process, used on the similarly empowered Wolverine and Lady Deathstrike for coating their bones in adamantium: instead he replaces Hammerhead's bones with replicas fashioned in the invulnerable metal. It is still unknown how his artificial skeleton can carry on biological functions.\n\nThe intervention of Mr. Negative also radically changed Hammerhead's personality. Hammerhead now recalls his life as Russian immigrant prior to the accident in which he adopted the 1920s gangster persona. Consequently, Hammerhead no longer speaks like a 1920s movie gangster, but instead behaves as a typical modern Russian mobster and hitman, as this was apparently his original personality prior to his head injury.\n\nHammerhead is highly skilled in the organization, concealment, and management of criminal enterprises. He is an effective hitman, a skilled marksman (his preferred weapon was the Thompson submachine gun), and an excellent street fighter. In his original incarnation, Hammerhead was able to hold his own against Spider-Man despite being an ordinary human by using his superhumanly durable skull as a blunt instrument. After his recent augmentation, he is now capable of grappling with and physically overpowering Spider-Man to the extent that he could eventually crush his foe.\n\nIn the \"House of M\" reality, Hammerhead is one of the gang leaders defeated by Luke Cage in his rise to power in Sapien Town.\n\nIn the \"Marvel Zombies vs. The Army of Darkness\" miniseries, Hammerhead briefly appears, along with the Owl and the Kingpin, at a meeting to discuss how to survive the zombie outbreak. This version of Hammerhead is ultimately killed by the Punisher.\n\nThe Ultimate Marvel version of Hammerhead first appears in \"Ultimate X-Men\" #13-14 as a mobster who has killed the parents of a little girl. The girl stumbles upon local street performer/magician Gambit, taking the girl in and decides to protect her from the mob. The girl is kidnapped and Gambit goes on a rampage to find her, blindly running into an ambush Hammerhead set up. Gambit gets out of the ambush and chases Hammerhead down. In the end, Gambit charges Hammerhead's inorganic skull full of bio-kinetic energy and causes his head to explode. It is also known his first name is Joseph. In \"Ultimate Spider-Man\", Hammerhead was revealed to have survived Gambit's attack, though how is not explained (\"It sucked. I came back.\"). He kills Silvermane in the beginning of the Warriors story arc and becomes the Enforcers' new leader. He burns down one of the Kingpin's warehouses. After an intense battle with Spider-Man, Black Cat, Moon Knight, Iron Fist, and Shang-Chi, he was put in a coma when Elektra brutally stabbed him in the chest with her sai and flung him out of a window.\n\nDuring the \"Age of Ultron\" storyline, a reality where Ultron nearly annihilated the human race has Hammerhead and Owl capturing Superior Spider-Man and hoped to trade him to Ultron. Hawkeye came to Superior Spider-Man's rescue as the Ultron Sentinels attack.\n\nDuring the \"Spider-Verse\" storyline, the Earth-001 version of Hammerhead appears as a member of Verna's Hounds.\n\n\n\n\n"}

It is notable for having chicks that have claws on two of their wing digits.\n\nIt is the only member of the genus Opisthocomus (Ancient Greek: \"wearing long hair behind\", referring to its large crest), which in turn is the only extant genus in the family Opisthocomidae. The taxonomic position of this family has been greatly debated, and is still far from clear.\n\nThe hoatzin is pheasant-sized, with a total length of , and a long neck and small head. It has an unfeathered blue face with maroon eyes, and its head is topped by a spiky, rufous crest. The long, sooty-brown tail is broadly tipped buff. The upperparts are dark, sooty-brown-edged buff on the wing coverts, and streaked buff on the mantle and nape. The under parts are buff, while the crissum (the undertail coverts surrounding the cloaca), primaries, underwing coverts and flanks are rich rufous-chestnut, but this is mainly visible when it opens its wings. \nThe hoatzin is an herbivore, eating leaves and fruit, and has an unusual digestive system with an enlarged crop used for fermentation of vegetable matter, in a manner broadly analogous to the digestive system of mammalian ruminants. The alternative name of \"stinkbird\" is derived from the bird's foul odour, which is caused by the fermentation of food in its digestive system.\n\nThis is a noisy species, with a variety of hoarse calls, including groans, croaks, hisses and grunts. These calls are often associated with body movements, such as wing spreading.\n\nThe hoatzin was originally described by German zoologist Statius Müller in 1776. There has been much debate about the hoatzin's relationships with other birds. Because of its distinctness it has been given its own family, the Opisthocomidae, and its own suborder, the Opisthocomi. At various times, it has been allied with such taxa as the tinamous, the Galliformes (gamebirds), the rails, the bustards, seriemas, sandgrouse, doves, turacos and other Cuculiformes, and mousebirds. A whole genome sequencing study published in 2012 places the hoatzin as the sister taxon of a clade composed of Gruiformes (cranes) and Charadriiformes (plovers).\n\nIn 2015, genetic research indicated that the hoatzin is the last surviving member of a bird line that branched off in its own direction 64 million years ago, shortly after the extinction event that killed the non-avian dinosaurs.\n\nHistorical placement as gamebirds is based mainly on phenetic considerations of external morphology, which are considered unreliable and generally dismissed today; the gamebirds together with the waterfowl are classified as Galloanserae whereas the hoatzin are not. However, cuckoos have zygodactyl feet (two toes forward, two backward) and turacos are semi-zygodactylous, whereas the hoatzin has the more typical anisodactyl foot with three toes forward, one backwards. The evolution of avian dactyly, on the other hand, is not entirely resolved to satisfaction.\n\nSibley and Ahlquist in 1990 considered it likely to be a basal cuckoo based on DNA-DNA hybridization. Avise \"et al.\" in 1994 found mtDNA cytochrome \"b\" sequence data to agree with Sibley and Ahlquist's previous treatment. Subsequently, Hughes and Baker in 1999 proclaimed to have \"resolved\" the relationships of the hoatzin to be with turacos, based on their own analysis of 6 sets of mtDNA and one of nDNA sequences.\nHowever, using mitochondrial and nuclear DNA sequences of increased length, Sorenson \"et al.\" in 2003 noted that all three previous DNA studies were apparently flawed due to errors in methodology, small sample size, and sequencing errors; their study strongly suggested \"against\" a close relationship between the hoatzin and cuckoos or turacos. It was not possible, though, to reliably determine the hoatzin's closest living relatives. Even though it tended to group with doves, this was not at all well-supported, with little more than 10% likelihood at best that such an arrangement was accurate according to Sorenson \"et al.\"s analysis.\n\nFain and Houde in 2004 proposed a dichotomy in the Neoaves (neognaths excluding fowl) based on β-fibrinogen intron 7 (FGB-int7) sequences. In their suggested phylogeny, the hoatzin was a basal member of the Metaves, a proposed clade that would include many other historically problematic bird families, such as flamingos, grebes, tropicbirds, sandgrouse and mesites. While the doves did also group with the \"Metaves\", no close relationship between these and the hoatzin within Metaves was recovered.\n\nWhile the other major neoavian lineage, Coronaves, largely agreed in its internal phylogeny with what is currently emerging as consensus, the interrelationships of the \"Metaves\" were not resolvable. Nor do supposed metavian groupings like flamingos and nightjars or tropicbirds and hummingbirds seem to have a factual basis rather than being artifactually grouped based on molecular homoplasies or lack of informative characters within the group, as Fain and Houde originally suggested; Metaves instead may be a \"wastebasket taxon\".\n\nIt seems probable that the taxa included in the Metaves by Fain and Houde contain some good clades, such as Caprimulgiformes, the Mirandornithes, or the Apodiformes. Considering that some \"odd Gruiformes\" which might be each other's closest living relatives make up most of the remaining Metaves, the doves, the hoatzin, and sandgrouse would remain as \"Metaves \"incerta sedis\"\" (Metaves with uncertain placement). This would seem to suggest that the hoatzin is at least more closely related to doves than to many of the other purported 'coronavian' families that previously have been suggested. Subsequent multigene studies of Ericson et al. 2006 and of Hackett et al. 2008 corroborated the Metaves clades, dependent on the inclusion of one and two genes respectively, but the latter did not recover the hoatzin with Metaves.\n\nMore recently, Houde embarked on sequencing the entire genome of the hoatzin. As of 2011, it was reported that more than 1.4 billion base pairs of hoatzin DNA had been sequenced, roughly equal to its entire haploid genome, but that only about 2.4% of its genome had yet been assembled. Completion of this project would be welcomed for more reasons than resolution of hoatzin relationships. Out of the diverse Class Aves, the genomes of no more than 4 species of birds including of the waterfowl/fowl and songbirds had been sequenced. Moreover, much might be learned by coordinating these efforts with that of the metagenomic analysis of the hoatzin foregut ruminant bacterial microflora.\n\nWith respect to other material evidence, an undisputed fossil record of a close hoatzin relative is specimen UCMP 42823, a single cranium backside. It is of Miocene origin and was recovered in the upper Magdalena River Valley, Colombia in the well known fauna of La Venta. This has been placed into a distinct, less derived genus, \"Hoazinoides\", but clearly would be placed into the same family as the extant species. It markedly differs insofar as that the cranium of the living hoatzin is characteristic, being much domed, rounded, and shortened, and that these autapomorphies were less pronounced in the Miocene bird. Miller discussed these findings in the light of the supposed affiliation of the hoatzins and the Galliformes, which was the favored hypothesis at that time, but had been controversial almost since its inception. He cautioned, however, \"that \"Hoazinoides\" by no means establishes a phyletic junction point with other galliforms.\" for obvious reasons, as we know today. Anything other than the primary findings of Miller are not to be expected in any case, as by the time of \"Hoazinoides\", essentially all modern bird families are either known or believed to have been present and distinct. Going further back in time, the Late Eocene or Early Oligocene (some 34 million years ago) \"Filholornis\" from France has also been considered \"proof\" of a link between the hoatzin and the gamebirds. The fragmentary fossil \"Onychopteryx\" from the Eocene of Argentina and the quite complete but no less enigmatic Early-Middle Eocene (Ypresian-Lutetian, some 48 million years ago) \"Foro panarium\" are sometimes used to argue for a hoatzin-cuculiform (including turacos) link. But as demonstrated above, this must be considered highly speculative, if not as badly off the mark as the relationship with Cracidae discussed by Miller.\n\nThe earliest record of the order Opisthocomiformes is \"Protoazin parisiensis\", from the latest Eocene (approximately 34 mya) of Romainville, France. The holotype and only known specimen is NMB PG.70, consisting of partial coracoid, partial scapula, and partial pedal phalanx. According to the phylogenetic analysis performed by the authors, \"Namibiavis\", although later, is more basal than \"Protoazin\". Opisthocomiforms seem to have been much more widespread in the past, with the present South American distribution being only a relic. By the Early to Middle Miocene, they were probably extinct in Europe already, as formations dated to this time and representing fluvial or lacustrine palaeoenvironments, in which the hoatzin thrives today, have yielded dozens of bird specimens, but no opisthocomiform. A possible explanation to account for the extinction of \"Protoazin\" between the Late Eocene and the Early Miocene in Europe, and of \"Namibiavis\" after the Middle Miocene of Sub-Saharan Africa is the arrival of arboreal carnivorans, predation by which could have had a devastating effect on the local opisthocomiforms, if they were as poor flyers and had similarly vulnerable nesting strategies as today's hoatzins. Felids and viverrids first arrived in Europe from Asia after the Turgai Sea closed, marking the boundary between the Eocene and the Oligocene. None of these predators, and for the matter, no placental predator at all was present in South America before the Great American Interchange 3 mya, which could explain the survival of the hoatzin there. In addition to being the earliest fossil record of an opisthocomiform, \"Protoazin\" was also the earliest find of one (1912), but it was forgotten for more than a century, being described only in 2014.\n\n\"Hoazinavis\" is an extinct genus of early opisthocomiform from Late Oligocene and Early Miocene (about 24–22 mya) deposits of Brazil. It was collected in 2008 from the Tremembé Formation of São Paulo, Brazil. It was first named by Gerald Mayr, Herculano Alvarenga and Cécile Mourer-Chauviré in 2011 and the type species is \"Hoazinavis lacustris\".\n\n\"Namibiavis\" is another extinct genus of early opisthocomoform from early Middle Miocene (approximately 16 mya) deposits of Namibia. It was collected from Arrisdrift, southern Namibia. It was first named by Cécile Mourer-Chauviré in 2003 and the type species is \"Namibiavis senutae\".\n\nThe hoatzin eats the leaves and to a lesser degree fruits and flowers of the plants that grow in the marshy and riverine habitats where it lives. It clambers around clumsily among the branches, and being quite tame (though they become stressed by frequent visits), often allows close approach and is reluctant to flush. The hoatzin uses a leathery bump on the bottom of its crop to help balance itself on the branches. Once it was thought that the species could eat the leaves of only arums and mangroves, but the species is now known to consume the leaves of more than fifty species. One study undertaken in Venezuela found that the hoatzins diet was 82% leaves, 10% flowers, and 8% fruit. Any feeding of insects or other animal matter is purely accidental.\n\nOne of this species' many peculiarities is that it has a digestive system unique amongst birds. Hoatzins use bacterial fermentation in the front part of the gut to break down the vegetable material they consume, much as cattle and other ruminants do. Unlike ruminants, however, which possess the rumen (a specialized stomach for bacterial fermentation), the hoatzin has an unusually large crop, folded in two chambers, and a large, multi-chambered lower esophagus. Its stomach chamber and gizzard are much smaller than in other birds. The crop of the hoatzin is so large as to displace the flight muscles and keel of the sternum, much to the detriment of their flight capacity. Because of aromatic compounds in the leaves they consume and the bacterial fermentation, the bird has a disagreeable, manure-like odor and is only hunted by humans for food in times of dire need.\n\nHoatzins are seasonal breeders, breeding during the rainy season, the exact timing of which varies across its range. Hoatzins are gregarious and nest in small colonies, laying two or three eggs in a stick nest in a tree hanging over water in seasonally flooded forests. The chicks, which are fed on regurgitated fermented food, have another odd feature; they have two claws on each wing. Immediately on hatching, they can use these claws, and their oversized feet, to scramble around the tree branches without falling into the water. When predators such as the great black hawk attack a hoatzin nesting colony, the adults fly noisily about, trying to divert the predator's attention, while the chicks move away from the nest and hide among the thickets. If discovered, however, they drop into the water and swim under the surface to escape, then later use their clawed wings to climb back to the safety of the nest. This has inevitably led to comparisons to the fossil bird \"Archaeopteryx\", but the characteristic is rather an autapomorphy, possibly caused by an atavism toward the dinosaurian finger claws, whose developmental genetics (\"blueprint\") presumably is still in the avian genome. Since \"Archaeopteryx\" had three functional claws on each wing, some earlier systematists speculated that the hoatzin was descended from it, because nestling hoatzins have two functional claws on each wing. Modern researchers believe that the young hoatzin's claws are of more recent origin, however, and may be a secondary adaptation from its frequent need to leave the nest and climb about in dense vines and trees well before it can fly.\n\nThough conspicuous—even attractive—at close range due to its bizarre shape, striking colors, unwariness, and poor flight, it is not considered endangered. In fact, its survival seems to be more assured than that of many other endemics of its range. In Brazil, indigenous peoples sometimes collect the eggs for food, and the adults are occasionally hunted, but in general this is rare, as it is reputed to have a bad taste. While its preferred habitats, mangrove and riverine forest, are disappearing quickly in some regions, it is less threatened than the Amazon rainforest, which is a primary target for deforestation. The hoatzin therefore remains fairly common in a large part of its range. The hoatzin is the national bird of Guyana.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "14579421", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14579421", "title": "Introduction to viruses", "text": "Introduction to viruses\n\nA virus is a biological agent that reproduces inside the cells of living hosts. When infected by a virus, a host cell is forced to produce thousands of identical copies of the original virus at an extraordinary rate. Unlike most living things, viruses do not have cells that divide; new viruses are assembled in the infected host cell. But unlike still simpler infectious agents, viruses contain genes, which gives them the ability to mutate and evolve. Over 5,000 species of viruses have been discovered.\n\nThe origins of viruses are unclear: some may have evolved from plasmids—pieces of DNA that can move between cells—while others may have evolved from bacteria. A virus consists of two or three parts: genes, made from either DNA or RNA, long molecules that carry genetic information; a protein coat that protects the genes; and in some viruses, an envelope of fat that surrounds the protein coat and is used, in combination with specific receptors, to enter a new host cell. Viruses vary in shape from the simple helical and icosahedral to more complex structures. Viruses range in size from 20 to 300 nanometres; it would take 33,000 to 500,000 of them, side by side, to stretch to .\n\nViruses spread in many ways. Just as many viruses are very specific as to which host species or tissue they attack, each species of virus relies on a particular method for propagation. Plant viruses are often spread from plant to plant by insects and other organisms, known as \"vectors\". Some viruses of animals, including humans, are spread by exposure to infected bodily fluids. Viruses such as influenza are spread through the air by droplets of moisture when people cough or sneeze. Viruses such as norovirus are transmitted by the faecal–oral route, which involves the contamination of hands, food and water. Rotavirus is often spread by direct contact with infected children. The human immunodeficiency virus, HIV, is transmitted by bodily fluids transferred during sex. Others, such as the Dengue virus, are spread by blood-sucking insects.\n\nViral infections can cause disease in humans, animals and even plants. However, they are usually eliminated by the immune system, conferring lifetime immunity to the host for that virus. Antibiotics have no effect on viruses, but antiviral drugs have been developed to treat life-threatening infections. Vaccines that produce lifelong immunity can prevent some viral infections.\n\nIn 1884 the French microbiologist Charles Chamberland invented a filter, known today as the Chamberland filter or Chamberland–Pasteur filter, that has pores smaller than bacteria. Thus he could pass a solution containing bacteria through the filter and completely remove them from the solution. In the early 1890s the Russian biologist Dmitri Ivanovsky used this filter to study what became known as the tobacco mosaic virus. His experiments showed that extracts from the crushed leaves of infected tobacco plants remain infectious after filtration.\n\nAt the same time several other scientists proved that, although these agents (later called \"viruses\") were different from bacteria, they could still cause disease, and they were about one hundredth the size of bacteria. In 1899 the Dutch microbiologist Martinus Beijerinck observed that the agent multiplied only in dividing cells. Having failed to demonstrate its particulate nature, he called it a \"contagium vivum fluidum\", a \"soluble living germ\". In the early 20th century the English bacteriologist Frederick Twort discovered viruses that infect bacteria, and the French-Canadian microbiologist Félix d'Herelle described viruses that, when added to bacteria growing on agar, would lead to the formation of whole areas of dead bacteria. Counting these dead areas allowed him to calculate the number of viruses in the suspension.\n\nWith the invention of the electron microscope in 1931 by the German engineers Ernst Ruska and Max Knoll came the first images of viruses. In 1935 American biochemist and virologist Wendell Meredith Stanley examined the tobacco mosaic virus and found it to be mostly made from protein. A short time later, this virus was separated into protein and RNA parts. A problem for early scientists was that they did not know how to grow viruses without using live animals. The breakthrough came in 1931, when the American pathologist Ernest William Goodpasture and Alice Miles Woodruff grew influenza and several other viruses in fertilised chickens' eggs. Some viruses could not be grown in chickens' eggs, but this problem was solved in 1949 when John Franklin Enders, Thomas Huckle Weller and Frederick Chapman Robbins grew polio virus in cultures of living animal cells. Over 5,000 species of virus have been discovered.\n\nViruses co-exist with life wherever it occurs. They have probably existed since living cells first evolved. The origin of viruses remains unclear because they do not form fossils, so molecular techniques have been the most useful means of hypothesising how they arose. However, these techniques rely on the availability of ancient viral DNA or RNA but most of the viruses that have been preserved and stored in laboratories are less than 90 years old. Molecular methods have only been successful in tracing the ancestry of viruses that evolved in the 20th century. Three main theories speculate on the origins of viruses:\n\n\n\n\nThere are problems with all of these hypotheses: the regressive hypothesis does not explain why even the smallest of cellular parasites do not resemble viruses in any way. The escape hypothesis does not explain the structures of virus particles. The coevolution, or virus-first hypothesis, contravenes the definition of viruses, in that they are dependent on host cells. But viruses are recognised as ancient and to have origins that pre-date the divergence of life into the three domains. This discovery has led modern virologists to reconsider and re-evaluate these three classical hypotheses.\n\nA virus particle, also known as a virion, consists of genes made from DNA or RNA which are surrounded by a protective coat of protein called a capsid. The capsid is made of many smaller, identical protein molecules which are called capsomers. The arrangement of the capsomers can either be icosahedral (20-sided), helical or more complex. There is an inner shell around the DNA or RNA called the nucleocapsid, which is formed by proteins. Some viruses are surrounded by a bubble of lipid (fat) called an envelope.\n\nViruses are among the smallest infectious agents, and most of them can only be seen by electron microscopy. Most viruses cannot be seen by light microscopy (in other words, they are sub-microscopic); their sizes range from 20 to 300 nm. They are so small that it would take 30,000 to 750,000 of them, side by side, to stretch to one cm. By contrast bacterial sizes are typically around 1 micrometre (1000 nm) in diameter, and the cells of higher organisms a few tens of micrometres. Some viruses such as megaviruses and pandoraviruses are relatively large. At around 1 micrometer, these viruses, which infect amoebae, were discovered in 2003 and 2013. They are around a thousand times larger than influenza viruses and the discovery of these \"giant\" viruses astonished scientists.\n\nGenes are made from DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) and, in many viruses, RNA (ribonucleic acid). The biological information contained in an organism is encoded in its DNA or RNA. Most organisms use DNA, but many viruses have RNA as their genetic material. The DNA or RNA of viruses consists of either a single strand or a double helix.\n\nViruses reproduce rapidly because they have only a few genes compared to humans who have 20,000–25,000. For example, influenza virus has only eight genes and rotavirus has eleven. These genes encode structural proteins that form the virus particle, or non-structural proteins, that are only found in cells infected by the virus.\n\nAll cells, and many viruses, produce proteins that are enzymes called DNA polymerase and RNA polymerase which make new copies of DNA and RNA. A virus's polymerase enzymes are often much more efficient at making DNA and RNA than the host cell's. However, RNA polymerase enzymes often make mistakes, and this is one of the reasons why RNA viruses often mutate to form new strains.\n\nIn some species of RNA virus, the genes are not on a continuous molecule of RNA, but are separated. The influenza virus, for example, has eight separate genes made of RNA. When two different strains of influenza virus infect the same cell, these genes can mix and produce new strains of the virus in a process called reassortment.\n\nProteins are essential to life. Cells produce new protein molecules from amino acid building blocks based on information coded in DNA. Each type of protein is a specialist that usually only performs one function, so if a cell needs to do something new, it must make a new protein. Viruses force the cell to make new proteins that the cell does not need, but are needed for the virus to reproduce. Protein synthesis consists of two major steps: transcription and translation.\n\nTranscription is the process where information in DNA, called the genetic code, is used to produce RNA copies called messenger RNA (mRNA). These migrate through the cell and carry the code to ribosomes where it is used to make proteins. This is called translation because the protein's amino acid structure is determined by the mRNA's code. Information is hence translated from the language of nucleic acids to the language of amino acids.\n\nSome nucleic acids of RNA viruses function directly as mRNA without further modification. For this reason, these viruses are called positive-sense RNA viruses. In other RNA viruses, the RNA is a complementary copy of mRNA and these viruses rely on the cell's or their own enzyme to make mRNA. These are called negative-sense RNA viruses. In viruses made from DNA, the method of mRNA production is similar to that of the cell. The species of viruses called retroviruses behave completely differently: they have RNA, but inside the host cell a DNA copy of their RNA is made with the help of the enzyme reverse transcriptase. This DNA is then incorporated into the host's own DNA, and copied into mRNA by the cell's normal pathways.\n\nWhen a virus infects a cell, the virus forces it to make thousands more viruses. It does this by making the cell copy the virus's DNA or RNA, making viral proteins, which all assemble to form new virus particles.\n\nThere are six basic, overlapping stages in the life cycle of viruses in living cells:\n\n\nThe range of structural and biochemical effects that viruses have on the host cell is extensive. These are called \"cytopathic effects\". Most virus infections eventually result in the death of the host cell. The causes of death include cell lysis (bursting), alterations to the cell's surface membrane and apoptosis (cell \"suicide\"). Often cell death is caused by cessation of its normal activity due to proteins produced by the virus, not all of which are components of the virus particle.\n\nSome viruses cause no apparent changes to the infected cell. Cells in which the virus is latent and inactive show few signs of infection and often function normally. This causes persistent infections and the virus is often dormant for many months or years. This is often the case with herpes viruses.\n\nSome viruses, such as Epstein-Barr virus, often cause cells to proliferate without causing malignancy; but some other viruses, such as papillomavirus, are an established cause of cancer.\nWhen a cell's DNA is damaged by a virus, and if the cell cannot repair itself, this often triggers apoptosis. One of the results of apoptosis is destruction of the damaged DNA by the cell itself. Some viruses have mechanisms to limit apoptosis so that the host cell does not die before progeny viruses have been produced; HIV, for example, does this.\n\nCommon human diseases caused by viruses include the common cold, the flu, chickenpox and cold sores. Serious diseases such as Ebola and AIDS are also caused by viruses. Many viruses cause little or no disease and are said to be \"benign\". The more harmful viruses are described as virulent.\nViruses cause different diseases depending on the types of cell that they infect.\nSome viruses can cause lifelong or chronic infections where the viruses continue to reproduce in the body despite the host's defence mechanisms. This is common in hepatitis B virus and hepatitis C virus infections. People chronically infected with a virus are known as carriers. They serve as important reservoirs of the virus. If there is a high proportion of carriers in a given population, a disease is said to be endemic.\n\nThere are many ways in which viruses spread from host to host but each species of virus uses only one or two. Many viruses that infect plants are carried by organisms; such organisms are called vectors. Some viruses that infect animals, including humans, are also spread by vectors, usually blood-sucking insects. However, direct transmission is more common. Some virus infections, such as norovirus and rotavirus, are spread by contaminated food and water, hands and communal objects and by intimate contact with another infected person, while others are airborne (influenza virus). Viruses such as HIV, hepatitis B and hepatitis C are often transmitted by unprotected sex or contaminated hypodermic needles. It is important to know how each different kind of virus is spread to prevent infections and epidemics.\n\nThere are many types of plant virus, but often they only cause a loss of yield, and it is not economically viable to try to control them. Plant viruses are often spread from plant to plant by organisms (vectors). These are normally insects, but some fungi, nematode worms and single-celled organisms have been shown to be vectors. When control of plant virus infections is considered economical (perennial fruits, for example) efforts are concentrated on killing the vectors and removing alternate hosts such as weeds. Plant viruses are harmless to humans and other animals because they can only reproduce in living plant cells.\n\nBacteriophages are viruses that infect bacteria and archaea. The International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses officially recognises 28 genera of bacteriophages that belong to 11 families. They are important in marine ecology: as the infected bacteria burst, carbon compounds are released back into the environment, which stimulates fresh organic growth. Bacteriophages are useful in scientific research because they are harmless to humans and can be studied easily. These viruses can be a problem in industries that produce food and drugs by fermentation and depend on healthy bacteria. Some bacterial infections are becoming difficult to control with antibiotics, so there is a growing interest in the use of bacteriophages to treat infections in humans.\n\nAnimals, including humans, have many natural defences against viruses. Some are non-specific and protect against many viruses regardless of the type. This innate immunity is not improved by repeated exposure to viruses and does not retain a \"memory\" of the infection. The skin of animals, particularly its surface, which is made from dead cells, prevents many types of viruses from infecting the host. The acidity of the contents of the stomach destroys many viruses that have been swallowed. When a virus overcomes these barriers and enters the host, other innate defences prevent the spread of infection in the body. A special hormone called interferon is produced by the body when viruses are present, and this stops the viruses from reproducing by killing the infected cell and its close neighbours. Inside cells, there are enzymes that destroy the RNA of viruses. This is called RNA interference. Some blood cells engulf and destroy other virus infected cells.\n\nSpecific immunity to viruses develops over time and white blood cells called lymphocytes play a central role. Lymphocytes retain a \"memory\" of virus infections and produce many special molecules called antibodies. These antibodies attach to viruses and stop the virus from infecting cells. Antibodies are highly selective and attack only one type of virus. The body makes many different antibodies, especially during the initial infection; however, after the infection subsides, some antibodies remain and continue to be produced, often giving the host lifelong immunity to the virus.\n\nPlants have elaborate and effective defence mechanisms against viruses. One of the most effective is the presence of so-called resistance (R) genes. Each R gene confers resistance to a particular virus by triggering localised areas of cell death around the infected cell, which can often be seen with the unaided eye as large spots. This stops the infection from spreading. RNA interference is also an effective defence in plants. When they are infected, plants often produce natural disinfectants which destroy viruses, such as salicylic acid, nitric oxide and reactive oxygen molecules.\n\nThe major way bacteria defend themselves from bacteriophages is by producing enzymes which destroy foreign DNA. These enzymes, called restriction endonucleases, cut up the viral DNA that bacteriophages inject into bacterial cells.\n\nVaccination is a way of preventing diseases caused by viruses. Vaccines simulate a natural infection and its associated immune response, but do not cause the disease. Their use has resulted in the eradication of smallpox and a dramatic decline in illness and death caused by infections such as polio, measles, mumps and rubella. Vaccines are available to prevent over fourteen viral infections of humans and more are used to prevent viral infections of animals. Vaccines may consist of either live or killed viruses. Live vaccines contain weakened forms of the virus, but these vaccines can be dangerous when given to people with weak immunity. In these people, the weakened virus can cause the original disease. Biotechnology and genetic engineering techniques are used to produce \"designer\" vaccines that only have the capsid proteins of the virus. Hepatitis B vaccine is an example of this type of vaccine. These vaccines are safer because they can never cause the disease.\n\nSince the mid 1980s, the development of antiviral drugs has increased rapidly, mainly driven by the AIDS pandemic. Antiviral drugs are often nucleoside analogues, which are molecules very similar, but not identical to DNA building blocks. When the replication of virus DNA begins, some of these fake building blocks are incorporated. As soon as that happens, replication stops prematurely—the fake building blocks lack the essential features that allow the addition of further building blocks. Thus, DNA production is halted, and the virus can no longer reproduce. Examples of nucleoside analogues are aciclovir for herpes virus infections and lamivudine for HIV and hepatitis B virus infections. Aciclovir is one of the oldest and most frequently prescribed antiviral drugs.\n\nOther antiviral drugs target different stages of the viral life cycle. HIV is dependent on an enzyme called the HIV-1 protease for the virus to become infectious. There is a class of drugs called protease inhibitors, which bind to this enzyme and stop it from functioning.\n\nHepatitis C is caused by an RNA virus. In 80% of people infected, the disease becomes chronic, and they remain infectious for the rest of their lives unless they are treated. There is an effective treatment that uses the nucleoside analogue drug ribavirin combined with interferon. Treatments for chronic carriers of the hepatitis B virus by a similar strategy using lamivudine and other anti-viral drugs have been developed. In both diseases, the drugs stop the virus from reproducing and the interferon kills any remaining infected cells.\n\nHIV infections are usually treated with a combination of antiviral drugs, each targeting a different stage in the virus's life-cycle. There are drugs that prevent the virus from attaching to cells, others that are nucleoside analogues and some poison the virus's enzymes that it needs to reproduce. The success of these drugs is proof of the importance of knowing how viruses reproduce.\n\nViruses are the most abundant biological entity in aquatic environments—there are about one million of them in a teaspoon of seawater—and they are essential to the regulation of saltwater and freshwater ecosystems. Most of these viruses are bacteriophages, which are harmless to plants and animals. They infect and destroy the bacteria in aquatic microbial communities and this is the most important mechanism of recycling carbon in the marine environment. The organic molecules released from the bacterial cells by the viruses stimulate fresh bacterial and algal growth.\n\nMicroorganisms constitute more than 90% of the biomass in the sea. It is estimated that viruses kill approximately 20% of this biomass each day and that there are fifteen times as many viruses in the oceans as there are bacteria and archaea. Viruses are mainly responsible for the rapid destruction of harmful algal blooms, which often kill other marine life.\nThe number of viruses in the oceans decreases further offshore and deeper into the water, where there are fewer host organisms.\n\nTheir effects are far-reaching; by increasing the amount of respiration in the oceans, viruses are indirectly responsible for reducing the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere by approximately 3 gigatonnes of carbon per year.\n\nMarine mammals are also susceptible to viral infections. In 1988 and 2002, thousands of harbour seals were killed in Europe by phocine distemper virus. Many other viruses, including caliciviruses, herpesviruses, adenoviruses and parvoviruses, circulate in marine mammal populations.\n\n"}

In most of these cases, their murderer or murderers have also gone undiscovered.\n\nAn adult female between the age of twenty-five and thirty-five years old was discovered wrapped in plastic and concealed in a footlocker on October 31, 1969 in St. Petersburg, Florida. The murder weapon, a tie, was visible around her neck. Examination also concluded she had suffered blunt force trauma to the head. The murder had taken place within seventy-two hours of her discovery. She was five feet nine inches tall, weighing 130 pounds, she was the mother of at least one child, and the dental care she received in her life was relatively low, despite the fact that her wisdom teeth had been removed. Her face has been reconstructed twice, including by the University of South Florida.\n\nThe body of a young woman was found in the summer of 1971 underneath a bridge. She had been killed by strangulation. Analysis of the remains traced her place of residence to a village in Greece. She had given birth to at least two children between the ages of 17 and 24 years. Evidence of various dental work and a unique ankle surgery were present on the body, which may indicate she was from a well-off background. Reconstructions were created between 1971 and 2012.\n\nThe body of a male aged eleven to fourteen was found floating in a pond on May 7, 1972 in Daytona, Volusia County, Florida. He had been stabbed to death three to four days before and was already decomposed when he was found, preventing the assessment of his eye color. The victim was white at a height of five feet two inches tall and weighed around 110 to 120 pounds. He had dark wavy hair and had no evidence of dental work, but his teeth were in very good condition. On his right leg, a benign tumor was found and the bones of his feet had fused together. Both of these traits were caused by different conditions but would not likely have symptoms. The victim also may have shaved his pubis, if he was at a reproductive stage in his life. He wore a denim jacket, a red and white striped shirt, gray pants, brown socks and one black shoe with a silver buckle. The latter articles of clothing were presumed to be dress clothes. The boy had a wallet with visible paint drops in his back pants pocket, although it is unknown if it assisted with finding clues about the victim's identity. The body was exhumed in 2013 to collect DNA.\n\nThe body of an unidentified white female was found on August 21, 1973. She was likely between the ages of 13 and 18 but may have been as old as 21. It was believed that she may have been a victim of Joseph Spaziano.\n\nShe was found within a wooded area beneath the body of Laura Harbers, whose murder Spaziano was later charged with. A witness claimed to have met a teenage girl in Daytona Beach, Florida, who was riding on a motorcycle with Spaziano. The girl asked the witness to watch over her purse until she returned. When the girl did not return, the witness looked through the purse but could only recall to authorities that the girl may have been from Ann Arbor, Michigan. Five days later, Spaziano returned and took the purse from the witness.\n\nSeminole County Jane Doe was slenderly built, being between 5 feet 1 inch and 5 feet 7 inches tall. She weighed about 110 pounds. She had light brown hair tied in a ponytail. Some of her teeth may have been found at the scene.\n\nOn September 4, 1979, a young woman's body was found lying in an apartment complex parking lot next to a dumpster in Dade, Miami-Dade County, Florida. She was believed to have died just hours before, leaving her face in a recognizable condition. She had not been murdered at that location and had likely been killed at a different area. Her eyes were described to be hazel, although the National Missing and Unidentified Persons System states that they were a grayish-green. Her hair was strawberry blond and she was at a height of five feet five to five feet eight inches tall with a weight of 120 pounds. She was between seventeen and twenty-five years old at the time of her death. On her calves, burns were found, possibly from coming in contact with tail pipes from riding on a motorcycle. The victim also had acne on her face and some fillings in her mouth. The body was found clad in a white tee shirt, a yellow scarf with flower designs and blue jeans. Recent developments in her case have turned up the possibility that she may have been an Ohio runaway named Tina with the nickname \"Sheeba.\" However, no information has been published if this lead has had results. The missing girl had left Ohio in 1977 and has never been seen or heard from since. The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children published this information on their Facebook page dedicated to unidentified children, hoping for additional tips.\n\nOn November 2, 1979, a young white man was killed by a drunk driver while walking on Interstate 95 in Fort Lauderdale, Broward County, Florida. The victim was killed alongside another individual who was later identified. He was between sixteen and twenty-five years of age at a height of and a weight of . His eyes were light in color, as they were gray. The victim's hair was brown and he also may have had facial hair, although this is unknown. He was fully clothed at the time of his death but little detail exist on the exact color or brand of his clothing. He had no evidence of seeing a dentist in his life, as he had no fillings or other sorts of work.\n\nA young woman's remains were found in Daytona Beach, Volusia County, Florida on November 5, 1980. She was murdered several weeks before and had most likely died due to stab wounds that occurred in her upper torso. The victim was a prostitute, according to convicted murderer Gerald Eugene Stano, who stated he choked the victim, instead of stabbing her, and had met her a few years before she was found dead. She was likely Hispanic, although she could have been White/Black biracial as well. She was estimated to be between fifteen and twenty five years old, to have been subjected to labor that involved using her arms, had been between five feet seven to five feet eleven inches tall and weighed between 115 and 135 pounds. Her height and weight ranges were difficult to estimate, as her skeleton was partial. She had fillings that contained a metal that had been outdated at the time. She also had some teeth that had been removed as well as some that never developed. She wore a red shirt, green shoes and a red pair of shorts. She also had a handkerchief and twenty-seven cents in her possession. Her face was digitally reconstructed by the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children in 2014.\n\nA female of African ancestry aged sixteen to twenty-six was discovered within a day of her death on February 3, 1981 in Miami-Dade County, Florida. The female had been beaten to death, as numerous injuries were noted on her body and was then left in a Japanese Garden. She was clothed, wearing a \"white/beige shirt,\" blue jeans and white undergarments, the bottoms with the words \"Rest Area Visitors Welcome.\" The young woman had a gap between her two front incisors and she had bleached her black hair blonde in some places. She was estimated to be five feet and two inches tall and to have weighed 90 pounds.\n\nA white woman's body was found floating in a canal in Moore Haven, Glades County, Florida, on March 9, 1981, approximately one day after she was killed by a blow to the side of her head. Although she had died recently, her body was already decomposing and was unrecognizable. The victim may have been seen earlier at two local restaurants before her death. She was between twenty-five and forty-five years old, wearing a pink shirt, a white bra, jeans, blue knee-high socks and brown ankle-high boots. The letter N was tattoed amateurishly on the top of her right thumb, which may have represented her or a loved one's name. The woman had painted her toenails with a copper-colored polish but not on her fingernails. This is possibly due to her being a nail-biter, as her nails were chewed short. She had hazel eyes with auburn hair and she was between five feet four to five feet six inches tall as a weight of approximately 125 pounds.\n\nOn February 3, 1984, the skeleton of a male aged seventeen to twenty-eight was found in South Bay, Palm Beach County, Florida. It is believed that he had died within a year of his body being found. The victim was approximately five feet nine inches to six feet tall with a weight at around 110 to 130 pounds. He was found clothed; he wore blue underwear underneath a pair of white swim trunks and white socks with a blue stripe. Analysis of his bones indicated he had broken some ribs weeks before his murder and he had also suffered trauma to his right hand that failed to heal properly, which may have distorted the way his thumb looked. The young man had fillings in his teeth and had one of his back teeth extracted a year or more before. The cause of death was ruled as homicide, as he had been struck with a blunt object in the back of his head. His hair was brown and was somewhat curly. One missing person, Terry Stokes, has been excluded from the case.\n\nThe body of a young, white woman, aged eighteen to thirty five, was located face-down in a canal in Davie, Broward County, Florida on February 18, 1984. The woman wore only shorts, although the possibility of her being sexually assaulted has not been confirmed. The Jane Doe stood at five feet four inches and was 120 pounds with curly blond or strawberry blond hair and hazel eyes. She had a gap between her front teeth, which may pose an important role in identifying her. She had been strangled around two days before her body was located. It is possible that she was murdered by Christopher Wilder.\n\nOn April 18, 1984, a seventeen to twenty-year-old female was found in the woods in Altoona, Lake County, Florida, several weeks after she died. Her remains were severely decomposed and had mostly been skeletonized. She was approximately 5.0' to 5.1' tall and weighed between 90 and 110 pounds. The victim had straight light brown to auburn hair and is believed to be white. She wore a black shirt reading \"here comes trouble,\" a whitish shirt with the words \"have you kissed your child tonight?\", jeans, tan shoes with blue trim, tan underwear and a gold necklace. She may have fractured two of her ribs during her life, which may assist in identifying her. It is known that her left ear was pierced but she wore no earring when found. Decomposition prevented knowing if the other ear was pierced. She had also painted her nails a coral or orange-red. After a dental exam, she was found to have been missing two teeth on the top jaw and had some that were discolored a reddish-purple color. The victim may have been new to the area, as initial reports state.\n\nA man was found on March 12, 1985 in Fort Lauderdale, Broward County, Florida, shortly after his death. He was murdered and left in a hotel room by two people, who were convicted in his murder. The man was between twenty-one and thirty-five years of age when he died and was five feet eight inches tall, weighing 181 pounds. The John Doe had brown hair, brown eyes and a mustache and was possibly of French origin, but this has not been confirmed. Although he was found naked, a blue shirt and tan pants were found in the room.\n\nOn January 5, 1988, the body of a young male was discovered inside of a hotel room in Miami, Dade County, Florida. The victim, ages sixteen to twenty-one, was five feet six inches and weighed 145 to 153 pounds. The boy had blond hair, gray or brown eyes and had scars on his wrists, hands and on his right thigh. Claiming he was a foster child native to New York selling magazines, the John Doe had given some his name, Robert Copland, with associated nicknames. However, investigators are unable to verify that it was his actual name. The boy wore a white shirt with a flag design, jeans and ankle-high socks. No dental fillings or signs of orthodontic treatment were observed, as his teeth were described to have appeared fairly healthy. He was previously believed to have been missing person Chester Wetmore, but he was ruled out after their fingerprints were compared.\n\nThe remains of a man of African descent (originally believed to be Asian) were found in Wilderness Park, Hillsborough County, Florida on March 14, 1988. He stood between five feet five and five feet six inches tall, his weight unknown due to skeletonization, his age estimated between twenty-eight and thirty-four years old. He was found wearing a tee shirt reading \"Drunken State\" and jeans, and possessed a blue wallet. A cause of death has not been determined, although he was believed to have been murdered. His face was reconstructed by artist Wesley Neville, who has created several other reconstructions of other unidentified people.\n\nThe badly decomposed remains of a transgender woman, aged between 22 and 35 were discovered at the roadside in Lake County, Florida on September 25, 1988. The victim was initially believed to be a cisgender woman until DNA testing indicated she was biologically male at birth. The body had been \"dragged\" to a concealed area and the pantyhose she wore had been partially removed. She additionally wore a bluish-green tank top and an acid-washed denim skirt. The cause of death was never determined, yet investigators suspect she was murdered due to the circumstances surrounding her discovery. She had died about eight months before her discovery.\n\nJulie Doe had breast implants, the type had been discontinued around 1983. There was also evidence she had a rhinoplasty. Her hair was long and bleached blond and had long fingernails that were manicured. Additionally, a healed fracture was visible on one of the cheekbones, toes and one of the ribs and possibly her nose. Additionally, she was taking hormone replacement drugs. She is believed to have undergone gender confirmation surgery around 1984, perhaps in Atlanta, Georgia, Miami, Florida, New Orleans, Louisiana, New York, New York or perhaps California. She was around 5'11 at a weight between 150 and 180 pounds.\n\nThe DNA Doe Project took on the case but initial attempts to extract DNA from the bones proved unsuccessful. The organization later began funding for a third attempt in November 2018.\n\nThe body of a sixteen to twenty-five-year-old female was found on February 15, 1991, one day after her death in Big Coppitt Key, Monroe County, Florida, located in the Florida Keys. She had been strangled, beaten and left in the woods in the Bahia Honda State Recreation Area. Authorities also suspect that she may have been raped. The victim wore multiple earrings in each ear, had dark eyes and brown hair as well as two tattoos, one being a heart on her left arm reading \"love\" and the other a small cross on the left hand. She likely wore a striped blue and red sweater, jeans, and moccasins decorated with turquoise beads, which were found near the body. The clothing that she wore indicated she was not from the area, as well as the fact that she didn't have any tan lines. Other distinguishing characteristics include stretch marks on her stomach and cysts present on her Fallopian tubes and ovaries. She may have also been pregnant at one time in her life. The victim was five feet four inches and weighed 145 pounds. Her face and clothing were reconstructed into a composite image in 1993 and was later reconstructed by the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. Her case was featured on \"America's Most Wanted\".\n\nIn Sorrento, Lake County, Florida, a woman's body was discovered on December 7, 1991. She had been murdered approximately twelve hours prior and had been raped and was naked below the waist. She was between five feet four to five feet five inches tall and weighed between 120 and 125 pounds. Her hair was brown with blond-dyed ends. She wore a sweatshirt, sports bra and a pink and blue top. Her teeth were healthy and her eyes hazel; she had bore at least one child and possibly another. Although she had also been tortured, the victim, aged twenty-five to thirty-five, was killed by strangulation. Her face was recognizable and she wore unique earrings with gold-colored heart and star shapes, but was never identified, her killer was arrested and charged for her murder, but did not know her name.\n\nA skeleton of a female between sixteen and twenty years old was found hidden under brush on August 28, 1993 in the Everglades, near the border between Palm Beach and Broward Counties. She was around five feet one to five feet five inches and was approximately one hundred pounds. Men's shorts and a large boot were worn by the young woman. No other clothing or the cause of her death were discovered. She had an abnormality in her spine which may have caused difficulties when walking. The female was dead for up to two years. Currently, three people have been ruled out as a possible identity of the decedent.\n\nA white male between thirty-six and forty-five years of age (some sources say as young as twenty-five) was discovered skeletonized on October 25, 1993. He was murdered by a blow to the head. Other physical descriptions include that one of his legs was not as long as the other and he had previous damage to his nose and spine. The clothing he wore read \"Road Kill Cafe, You Kill It, We Grill It.\" He also had long brown hair.\n\nThe decomposing remains of an infant were found on May 23, 1996 in Clewiston, Hendry County, Florida. The child was female, approximately one to one and a half feet tall and weighed around five pounds. Her body was concealed in a multicolored blanket that appeared to be made in a Mexican or Native American design. The baby was white with Hispanic characteristics, as she had dark hair. Also at the scene, four other blankets, a red bucket and a sweater were located. The infant was approximately three weeks to two months old when she died several days before her body was found by a man collecting cans along a road, which was near US 27. Her case is being treated as a murder, as her lower and upper jaws were fractured. Her footprints were compared to many taken at local hospitals but none matched.\n\nThe remains of a white woman, possibly native to the Czech Republic, were found on May 30, 1996 in Southport, Bay County, Florida. She was between five foot six to five foot nine inches tall, but her weight was not possible to estimate, although she was of petite build. Examination of her body indicated that she may have been in a vehicular accident when she was alive, as there were healed fractures on her nose, knee and ribs. Some of her teeth were also missing. Her hair was light brown, wavy and had blond highlights and she wore a gold bracelet, a bluish pullover and a sports bra. She was approximately twenty-one to thirty-five years old. A woman matching the victim's description was seen on April 20, 1996 with a man leaving a gentleman's club. The man, Billy Frank Hansen, was convicted of second-degree murder of the woman, who he confessed to raping and murdering after he agreed to drive her home. The victim was apparently heavily intoxicated and stated that she would have sexual intercourse with Hansen if he paid her. These events took place on April 20 of the same year.\n\nA black male, clothed only in shorts, was unearthed from a shallow grave on April 6, 1998 in Plant City, Hillsborough County, Florida. The victim had been shot with a shotgun and was then wrapped in a carpet after his murder earlier in the 1990s. Raymond Crocker went on trial for the murder after the body was found and his wife confessed to assisting him with disposing the body in 1994. She claimed that her husband murdered the man in Zephyrhills, Florida because he was in debt to the victim for cocaine.\nThe victim was between twenty-five and forty-five years old and was five feet seven to five feet nine inches tall and weighed around 180 pounds.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1432340", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1432340", "title": "Logosophy", "text": "Logosophy\n\nLogosophy is an ethical-philosophical doctrine developed by the Argentine humanist and thinker Carlos Bernardo González Pecotche, which offers teachings of conceptual order and practices that lead oneself to self-cognition and self-improvement through a process of conscious evolution.\n\nLogosophy argues that the thoughts can be autonomous and independent of one's individual will, and that they are born and fulfill their function under the influence of the moral or psychic states of their owner or someone else. Its purpose is to free the mental faculties of suggestive influences, allowing the human being to think freely and understand the true objectives of life.\n\nLogosophy presents itself as a new and conclusive science, which reveals a method and a set of disciplines of its own, with the purpose of leading man to the knowledge of his own self, of the Universe, and its eternal laws. It also presents itself as a new way of feeling and conceiving life, since it presents a new conception of humanity, human psychic and mental organization, and the human life in its broadest possibilities and proportions.\n\nIts name is the combination of the Greek word \"logos\" and \"sophia\", which the author has adopted as meaning Creative Word or Manifestation of the Supreme Knowledge, and Original Science or Wisdom, respectively, to denote \"a new line of cognitions, a doctrine, a method and a technique which are eminently its own\".\n\nLogosophy was created in 1930, with the creation of the first Logosophical Foundation in the city of Córdoba, Argentina.\n\nCarlos Bernardo González Pecotche, also known as Raumsol, was born on August 11, 1901 in Buenos Aires, Argentina. He was a son of Jorge N. González and Maria Pecotche de González. He married Paulina Eugenia Puntel on October 8, 1924 and had a son, Carlos Federico González Puntel, born on July 10, 1925. He died in Buenos Aires on April 4, 1963.\n\nThe logosophical method, as its author claims, is unique in its essence and has the quality of adapting itself to each and every mind, giving it the share of knowledge that it is capable of absorbing.\n\nThe examination of the aptitudes and the conditions of assimilation are factors to which the method gives special consideration. Its main artery, which makes the teaching live and breathe in the soul of the student, is the one which requires him, as the main function of the cognition which it bestows, to become intimately familiarized with the teaching to the point of identifying himself with it by associating it to his life.\n\nThe logosophical method intends to guide the human being to a more thorough knowledge of his mind considered in the entirety of its complex operation. Logosophy invites man to carry out a complete study of his own psychology – his character, his tendencies, his thoughts, his qualities, his deficiencies, and whatever relates directly or indirectly to the movements of his mental faculties and contemplates his spiritual state.\n\nThe main objectives of the logosophical cognitions are:\n\n\nAccording to González Pecotche, the logosophical knowledge does not have common points of reference with any of the usually studied branches of knowledge, be it Science, Philosophy, Psychology, etc.\n\nRegarding the relationship between Logosophy and Philosophy, González Pecotche stated:\n\n“In this regard, Logosophy includes two powerful forces which, when they unite and bond, lead man to accomplish the two aims of this existence: to evolve toward perfection and to constitute himself as a real contributor to humanity. One of these factors is the cognition that it offers to the human mind; the other is the affection that teaches how to fulfill human hearts.\nThe common science lacks this affection, this force; it is cold and rigid, and sometimes speculative and intemperate, as in the case of philosophy; conversely, Logosophy is conciliatory. Herein lies the great difference and which also explains why it is capable of realizing great accomplishments in the human soul and which seem inconceivable to those who remain extraneous to such possibilities.”\n\nAmongst the multiple views that González Pecotche provides of Logosophy, he also mentions that it is a new kind of Humanism. However he differentiates his original contributions from the works of other Humanists:\n\n“Differing therefore from the generalized concept of humanism, our humanism starts from one's own sensitive and thinking being who seeks to accomplish within himself the evolutionary process that all humanity must follow. One's accomplishment in this respect will inevitably constitute later a true example of what each participant within the great human family can achieve.”\n\nCurrently, there are logosophical institutions on the following countries:\n\nAccording to logosophy.info, there are also students and centers of study in formation in countries including Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, and the United Kingdom.\n\n"}

She was the younger sister of fellow actress Mary Pickford and elder sister of actor Jack Pickford.\n\nOne of her best known roles was in \"The Diamond from the Sky\" directed by William Desmond Taylor in 1915. Pickford's career is often overshadowed by that of her siblings and though she was a notable figure in the 1920s, her films and role in the Pickford acting family are now largely forgotten.\n\nShe was born to John Charles Smith and Charlotte Hennessy. Pickford was named for her mother. She was the middle child, born a year and two months after her sister Gladys Smith and three years before her brother John Charles Smith, called Jack. She quickly became her father's favorite, much to her sister's annoyance. After mistakenly believing she was a boy when first born, her father lovingly gave her the boyish nickname, 'Chuckie'.\n\nPickford's father left the family while she was young, and her sister Gladys took on responsibilities. Lottie and Jack became extremely close, banding together against Gladys, whom they saw as strict. Lottie idolized her brother Jack, and they remained close throughout their lifetimes. Despite her tense relationship with her sister, Lottie was protective of her, and once jumped on D.W. Griffith to defend her sister during a heated argument with the director.\n\nIn need of extra income, the family began to act. On January 8, 1900, Gladys and Lottie appeared in \"The Silver King\". Lottie was either offered a lesser sum than her sister or was part of a packaged deal. The family eventually moved to New York City where they all acted in various productions, sometimes together, sometimes not. At one point Lottie and Gladys had to travel on their own for one production.\n\nOf the family, Gladys was the breakout star. Her family members were usually attached to her as a contractual stipulation. After she started in films, Gladys took the name Mary Pickford. Lottie and Jack also took on the surname Pickford in their acting careers. Mary was influential in getting her siblings on the payroll after she started acting in films.\n\nIn 1907, Mary adopted the stage name 'Mary Pickford'. The rest of the family adopted the Pickford name by the time they began appearing in films. Mary signed with D.W. Griffith's Biograph Company in 1909 and also secured work for her siblings. \n\nBetween 1909 and 1910, Mary made eighty shorts, Jack made twenty-eight, and Lottie made twenty-five. Of the three Pickfords, Lottie's talents were considered the weakest. Actress Linda Arvidson said Mary had claimed her sister was not pretty enough for films, and had done her best to keep her away from Biograph. When the Biograph Company departed for California, Lottie Pickford and her mother were left behind. She would eventually join her sister in California.\n\nAway from her elder sister, Pickford's first starring role came in 1914 in \"The House of Bondage\". It was a vice film, with Pickford playing a prostitute, in stark contrast to her sister's image as \"America's Sweetheart\". The film did not receive good reviews, being considered too crude. In 1915, Pickford appeared in \"Fanchon, the Cricket\", opposite both her siblings. It is the only film in which all three Pickford siblings appear. It was thought lost until rediscovered in the 20th century at the British Film Institute.\n\nPickford starred in \"The Diamond from the Sky\" serial (1915) although, to her humiliation, she was only given the role after Mary turned it down. A \"Photoplay\" article from around the time of the release declared her \"Pickford The Second!\" and compared her to her sister, albeit as a worthy sequel. The serial was jeopardized when she became pregnant. This incident put her on the unofficial Hollywood blacklist for a short time. Pickford performed in only five roles between 1915 and 1918, when she took a break from acting.\n\nAfter divorcing her first husband, Pickford next starred in 1921's \"They Shall Pay\" which co-starred Allan Forrest, her future husband. Pickford again took several years' time off from acting before returning in a minor role in the 1924 film \"Dorothy Vernon of Haddon Hall\". Her final role was opposite her brother-in-law Douglas Fairbanks Sr. in \"Don Q Son of Zorro\" in 1925. During her career, Pickford starred in eight features, while her brother starred in over forty features.\n\nPickford was a socialite and partying was her first love. She and her brother Jack both struggled with alcoholism. Her parties were legendary and lasted until morning with plentiful drugs and alcohol and nudity. Pickford's maid recalled that when they heard Mary's car pulling in, Pickford and her friends would \"Jump into their knickers!\"\nDespite her reputation as a party girl, Pickford was considered to be down to earth, friendly, sweet, and unpretentious.\n\nOn an unknown date in 1915, before the release of \"The Diamond from the Sky\", Pickford quietly married New York broker Alfred Rupp. The couple had a daughter in 1915, Mary Pickford Rupp (1915-1984), who would be later renamed Gwynne Rupp. The couple separated in 1919 and divorced the following year. For unknown reasons, Pickford allowed her mother Charlotte to legally adopt her daughter, who was renamed Gwynne in 1920. Pickford did not comment to the press on the matter, other than to say she would never marry again. Gwynne lived with her grandmother until Charlotte, Sr.'s death in 1928. At that time, Gwynne's aunt Mary Pickford took custody of her. This arrangement lasted until Gwynne married radio announcer Hugh \"Bud\" Ernst in June 1939.\n\nLottie Pickford did marry again, to actor Allan Forrest in January 1922. She obtained a divorce from Forrest in Paris in 1927. \nOn July 22, 1929, she married Russel O. Gillard, an undertaker from Los Angeles. They divorced in February 1933 on charges of \"extreme cruelty\" by her husband. Later that year, Pickford married a Pittsburgh society man named John William Lock. They remained married until her early death in 1936.\n\nOn December 6, 1936, Pickford suffered a heart attack at the age of 43. She was said to have been in failing health for three years, related to alcohol abuse. She died at her home in Beverly Hills. Her funeral was held on December 13 at Wee Kirk o' the Heather Church in Glendale, California. She is buried in the Pickford family plot in Forest Lawn Cemetery.\n\n\n"}

The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that malnutrition accounts for 54 percent of child mortality worldwide, about 1 million children. Another estimate also by WHO states that childhood underweight is the cause for about 35% of all deaths of children under the age of five years worldwide.\n\nThe main causes are unsafe water, inadequate sanitation or insufficient hygiene, factors related to society and poverty, diseases, maternal factors, gender issues and – overall – poverty.\n\nMalnutrition in this article specifically refers to undernutrition where an individual is not getting enough calories, protein, or micronutrients. (It could also refer to a condition where too much food is consumed such that the diet causes health problems).\n\nThere are three commonly used measures for detecting malnutrition in children:\nThese measures of malnutrition are interrelated, but studies for the World Bank found that only 9 percent of children exhibit stunting, underweight, and wasting.\n\nChildren with severe acute malnutrition are very thin, but they often also have swollen hands and feet, making the internal problems more evident to health workers.\n\nChildren with severe malnutrition are very susceptible to infection.\n\nUndernutrition in children causes direct structural damage to the brain and impairs infant motor development and exploratory behavior. Children who are undernourished before age two and gain weight quickly later in childhood and in adolescence are at high risk of chronic diseases related to nutrition.\n\nStudies have found a strong association between undernutrition and child mortality. Once malnutrition is treated, adequate growth is an indication of health and recovery. Even after recovering from severe malnutrition, children often remain stunted for the rest of their lives.\n\nEven mild degrees of malnutrition double the risk of mortality for respiratory and diarrheal disease mortality and malaria. This risk is greatly increased in more severe cases of malnutrition.\n\nUndernourished girls tend to grow into short adults and are more likely to have small children.\n\nPrenatal malnutrition and early life growth patterns can alter metabolism and physiological patterns and have lifelong effects on the risk of cardiovascular disease. Children who are undernourished are more likely to be short in adulthood, have lower educational achievement and economic status, and give birth to smaller infants. Children often face malnutrition during the age of rapid development, which can have long-lasting impacts on health.\n\nInadequate food intake, infections, psychosocial deprivation, the environment (lack of sanitation and hygiene), social inequality and perhaps genetics contribute to childhood malnutrition.\n\nInadequate food intake such as a lack of proteins can lead to Kwashiorkor, Marasmus and other forms of Protein–energy malnutrition.\n\nThe World Health Organization estimated in 2008 that globally, half of all cases of undernutrition in children under five were caused by unsafe water, inadequate sanitation or insufficient hygiene. This link is often due to repeated diarrhoea and intestinal worm infections as a result of inadequate sanitation. However, the relative contribution of diarrhea to undernutrition and in turn stunting remains controversial.\n\nIn almost all countries, the poorest quintile of children has the highest rate of malnutrition. However, inequalities in malnutrition between children of poor and rich families vary from country to country, with studies finding large gaps in Peru and very small gaps in Egypt. In 2000, rates of child malnutrition were much higher in low income countries (36 percent) compared to middle income countries (12 percent) and the United States (1 percent).\n\nStudies in Bangladesh in 2009 found that the mother’s literacy, low household income, higher number of siblings, less access to mass media, less supplementation of diets, unhygienic water and sanitation are associated with chronic and severe malnutrition in children.\n\nDiarrhea and other infections can cause malnutrition through decreased nutrient absorption, decreased intake of food, increased metabolic requirements, and direct nutrient loss. Parasite infections, in particular intestinal worm infections (helminthiasis), can also lead to malnutrition. A leading cause of diarrhea and intestinal worm infections in children in developing countries is lack of sanitation and hygiene. Other diseases that cause chronic intestinal inflammation may lead to malnutrition, such as some cases of untreated celiac disease and inflammatory bowel disease.\n\nChildren with chronic diseases like HIV have a higher risk of malnutrition, since their bodies cannot absorb nutrients as well. Diseases such as measles are a major cause of malnutrition in children; thus immunizations present a way to relieve the burden.\n\nThe nutrition of children 5 years and younger depends strongly on the nutrition level of their mothers during pregnancy and breastfeeding.\n\nInfants born to young mothers who are not fully developed are found to have low birth weights. The level of maternal nutrition during pregnancy can affect newborn baby body size and composition. Iodine-deficiency in mothers usually causes brain damage in their offspring, and some cases cause extreme physical and mental retardation. This affects the children’s ability to achieve their full potential. In 2011 UNICEF reported that thirty percent of households in the developing world were not consuming iodized salt, which accounted for 41 million infants and newborns in whom iodine deficiency could still be prevented. Maternal body size is strongly associated with the size of newborn children.\n\nShort stature of the mother and poor maternal nutrition stores increase the risk of intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR). However, environmental factors can weaken the effect of IUGR on cognitive performance.\n\nA study in Bangladesh in 2008 reported that rates of malnutrition were higher in female children than male children. Other studies show that, at the national level, differences between undernutrition prevalence rates between young boys and girls are generally small. Girls often have a lower nutritional status in South and Southeastern Asia compared to boys. In other developing regions, the nutritional status of girls is slightly higher.\n\nMeasurements of a child’s growth provide the key information for the presence of malnutrition, but weight and height measurements alone can lead to failure to recognize kwashiorkor and an underestimation of the severity of malnutrition in children.\n\nMeasures have been taken to reduce child malnutrition. Studies for the World Bank found that, from 1970 to 2000, the number of malnourished children decreased by 20 percent in developing countries. Iodine supplement trials in pregnant women have been shown to reduce offspring deaths during infancy and early childhood by 29 percent. However, universal salt iodization has largely replaced this intervention.\n\nThe Progresa program in Mexico combined conditional cash transfers with nutritional education and micronutrient-fortified food supplements; this resulted in a 10 percent reduction the prevalence of stunting in children 12–36 months old. Milk fortified with zinc and iron reduced the incidence of diarrhea by 18 percent in a study in India.\nIn Nigeria, the use of imported Ready to Use Therapeutic Food (RUTF) has been used to combat malnutrition in the North, However, a research has shown that \"Soy Kunu\", a locally sourced and prepared blend consisting of peanut, millet and soya beans contains the components of the Ready to Use Therapeutic Food (RUTF) and this has been used massively to reduce malnutrition in the north.\n\nBreastfeeding can reduce rates of malnutrition and dehydration caused by diarrhea, but mothers are sometimes wrongly advised to not breastfeed their children. Breastfeeding has been shown to reduce mortality in infants and young children. Since only 38 percent of children worldwide under 6 months are exclusively breastfed, education programs could have large impacts on children malnutrition rates. However, breastfeeding cannot fully prevent PEM if not enough nutrients are consumed.\n\nTreatment with antibiotics such as amoxicillin or cefdinir improve the response and survival rate of severely malnourished children to an outpatient treatment plan which provided therapeutic food. This confirms the recommendation, \"In addition to the provision of RUTF [ready-to-use therapeutic food], children need to receive a short course of basic oral medication to treat infections.\" contained in \"Community-based management of severe acute malnutrition, A Joint Statement by the World Health Organization, the World Food Programme, the United Nations System Standing Committee on Nutrition and the United Nations Children’s Fund.\"\n\nThe World Health Organization estimates that malnutrition accounts for 54 percent of child mortality worldwide, about 1 million children. Another estimate also by WHO states that childhood underweight is the cause for about 35% of all deaths of children under the age of five years worldwide.\n\nAccording to a 2008 review an estimated 178 million children under age 5 are stunted, most of whom live in sub-Saharan Africa. A 2008 review of malnutrition found that about 55 million children are wasted, including 19 million who have severe wasting or severe acute malnutrition.\n\nAs underweight children are more vulnerable to almost all infectious diseases, the \"indirect\" disease burden of malnutrition is estimated to be an order of magnitude higher than the disease burden of the \"direct\" effects of malnutrition. The combination of direct and indirect deaths from malnutrition caused by unsafe water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) practices is estimated to lead to 860,000 deaths per year in children under five years of age.\n\n"}

He was \"consul ordinarius\" in AD 54 with Marcus Asinius Marcellus as his colleague. Aviola is also recorded as being governor of Asia in 65/66. According to Brian Jones, Aviola was also \"curator aquarum\" (or \"superintendent of the aqueducts\") from 74 to 97. He is known almost solely from surviving inscriptions.\n\nAviola has been identified as the son of Gaius Calpurnius Aviola, suffect consul of AD 24. Assuming that he became consul \"anno suo\", he would have been born around AD 22, making this relationship more likely. He is known to have lived into Domitian's reign, and that he married Aedia Servilia, the daughter of Marcus Servilius Nonianus (consul AD 35). Older authorities, such as Edmund Groag, have identified Aviola with the Avilius mentioned by Juvenal, but Gallivan has argued that Aviola is a different person. \n\nAlthough it is not known if Aviola had any children, there is a Manius Acilius Aviola, suffect consul in 82, who is sometimes identified as his son, and Manius Acilius Aviola, ordinary consul in 122, who is sometimes identified as his grandson.\n"}
{"id": "743365", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=743365", "title": "Nonresistance", "text": "Nonresistance\n\nNonresistance (or non-resistance) is \"the practice or principle of not resisting authority, even when it is unjustly exercised\". At its core is discouragement of, even opposition to, physical resistance to an enemy. It is considered as a form of principled nonviolence or pacifism which rejects all physical violence, whether exercised on individual, group, state or international levels. Practitioners of nonresistance may refuse to retaliate against an opponent or offer any form of self-defense. Nonresistance is often associated with particular religious groups.\n\nSometimes non-resistance has been seen as compatible with, even part of, movements advocating social change. An often-cited example is the movement led by Mohandas Gandhi in the struggle for Indian Independence. While it is true that in particular instances (e.g. when threatened with arrest) practitioners in such movements might follow the line of non-resistance, such movements are more accurately described as cases of nonviolent resistance or civil resistance.\n\nPerhaps the oldest recorded statement of nonresistance philosophy is that of Socrates around 399 BC. An influential ancient Greek philosopher, Socrates was sentenced to death by the Athenian democracy for teaching his students to question authority and think for themselves. Socrates accepted his fate on reasons of morality and justice, rather than accept help from his supporters to flee Athens and escape execution.\n\nThe term nonresistance was later used to refer to the Established Church during the religious troubles in England following the English Civil War and Protestant Succession. In the Anabaptist churches, the term is defined in contrast with pacifism. Advocates of non-resistance view pacifism as a more liberal theology since it advocates only physical nonviolence and allows its followers to actively oppose an enemy. In the 20th century, there have been differences of opinion between and within Amish and Mennonite churches, as they disagreed on the ethics of nonresistance and pacifism.\n\nLeo Tolstoy, Adin Ballou and Mohandas Gandhi were notable advocates of nonresistance. However, there were variations between them. Gandhi's \"Satyagraha\" movement was based on a belief in resistance that was active but at the same time nonviolent, and he did not believe in using non-resistance (or even nonviolent resistance) in circumstances where a failure to oppose an adversary effectively amounted to cowardice. 'I do believe,' he wrote, 'that where there is only a choice between cowardice and violence, I would advise violence.'\"\n\nChristian nonresistance is based on a reading of the Sermon on the Mount, in which Jesus says:\n\nMembers of the Anabaptist (Mennonite, Amish, Hutterite and Schwarzenau Brethren/German Baptist) denominations and other peace churches like the Quakers have interpreted this passage to mean that people should do nothing to physically resist an enemy. According to this belief, only God has the right to execute punishments. Nonresistant Christians note that sacrificial love of Jesus resulted in his submission to crucifixion rather than vengeance. A main application of this theology for Anabaptist groups is to teach conscientious objection of military conscription to their youth.\n\nTo illustrate how nonresistance works in practice, Alexandre Christoyannopoulos offers the following Christian anarchist response to terrorism:\n\nAuthor James R. Graham wrote, \"The Christian is not a pacifist, he is a non-participationist.\"\n\nIn addition to conscientious objection, nonresistant practices of Old Order Mennonites, Amish, and Conservative Mennonites include rejection of the following civil practices: sue at law, lobby the government, hold government office, use the force of the law to maintain their \"rights\".\n\n\n"}

He first appears in The Farm (August 2005), an episode written by Carla Robinson and directed by Rod Hardy. Like the Cavils and Number Threes, and in contrast to Leobens, Dorals, Number Sixes, and Number Eights, Simons appear to be relatively uncommon and never appear in large groups. He has a more prominent role in the movie \"\".\n\nA Number Four first appears posing as a human physician treating Kara Thrace (Starbuck) for ballistic trauma in what was supposedly a hospital on Caprica. In reality, he was also performing invasive medical tests on her reproductive organs. After Starbuck begins to suspect the doctor's true nature, she kills him, and escapes from the facility. Her fears are confirmed when a second copy of the model greets her on her way. This copy is then gunned down by resistance fighters who rescue her. At least one other copy is seen on Cylon-occupied Caprica.\n\nIt is later revealed that a Number Four was the Caprica Buccaneers' team doctor and worked against the resistance by contaminating radiation meds and giving too much morpha. This copy was eliminated after Samuel Anders saw the Four copy who cornered Starbuck outside the Cylon facility\n\nAnother Four - also named Simon - was a medic in the Colonial Fleet on Gemenon and later lived on the ship \"Cybele\" in \"Galactica\"'s refugee fleet with his human wife Giana O'Neill and stepdaughter Jemmy. This Simon was reluctant to act against humanity because he loved his wife and stepdaughter. A Brother Cavil attempted to pressure him into blowing up the \"Cybele\". Simon airlocks himself instead. Giana learned the truth about her husband after Starbuck returned to the fleet. Although she was distraught, she reasoned he must have killed himself rather than follow the Cylon plan and thus was heroic in a way. According to a Six, he killed himself out of resurrection range (the reason for being out of range at the time is unknown) and is thus truly dead.\n\nA Four is present in President Gaius Baltar's office during the Battle of New Caprica. One Four, assigned as part of one Basestar's command crew that witnesses a sister Basestar's plight, determines a decision to rescue the infected Basestar cannot be reached scientifically. A Simon captured from that same infected Basestar near the \"Lion's Head Nebula\" is interrogated on Galactica. He reveals information about the ship and the Cylons' motives for abandoning it, in exchange for a cure promised by the humans. However, there is no cure, only a treatment. It was thought this Four was killed when Karl Agathon sabotages the environmental control system, killing the Cylon prisoners to stop them from being used as biological weapons.\n\nSimon returns when a Number Three model talks to Baltar in The Passage, after consulting with Simon about the Cylons' next move towards Earth.\n\nNumber Fours are nearly always featured as a Doctor or Medic, and has a fascination with the possibility of Humanoid Cylons being able to reproduce. He also speaks calmly and clearly, and seems to use logic to solve his problems and make decisions. When Galactica attacks the Colony in the final episode, a Four shows no concern, believing the odds are in the Cylons' favor and there is no need to worry.\n\nEllen Tigh makes the veiled comment Number Four would want to study Caprica Six and Saul Tigh's baby if given the opportunity. Caprica Six takes this to be a threat against her baby. Ellen's veiled threat is proven to be valid, as this Four does get the chance to operate on Hera when she is later kidnapped by Boomer. This Four is killed by Boomer herself who snaps his neck in order to return Hera to her parents during the attack on the Colony.\n\nSeveral Number Fours are among the boarding party led by John Cavil that storms Galactica during the assault on The Colony. At least one is killed by the CIC crew. After a tenuous truce is declared, one Four oversees the transfer of resurrection data from the Final Five to the Colony Hybrids, but the truce is broken when Galen Tyrol murders Tory Foster. The Four in the CIC is shot dead by Starbuck in the ensuing fight. The remaining Fours aboard the Colony all perish when it falls into the naked singularity it was orbiting and is obliterated.\n\n"}
{"id": "55362208", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=55362208", "title": "Ovarian follicle activation", "text": "Ovarian follicle activation\n\nOvarian follicle activation can be defined as primordial follicles in the ovary moving from a quiescent (inactive) to a growing phase. The primordial follicle in the oocyte is what makes up the “pool” of follicles that will be induced to enter growth and developmental changes that change them into pre-ovulatory follicles, ready to be released during ovulation. The process of development from a primordial follicle to a pre-ovulatory follicle is called folliculogenesis.\n\nActivation of the primordial follicle involves the following: a morphological change from flattened to cuboidal granulosa cells, proliferation of granulosa cells, formation of the protective zona pellucida layer, and growth of the oocyte.\n\nIt is widely understood that androgens act primarily on preantral follicles and that this activity is important for preantral follicle growth. Additionally, it is thought that androgens are involved in primordial follicle activation. However, the influence of androgens on primordial follicle recruitment and whether this response is primary or secondary is still uncertain.\n\nPrimordial follicles are activated to grow into antral follicles. Communication between the oocytes and the surrounding somatic cells, such as the granulosa cells and the theca cells, is involved in the control of primordial follicle activation. There are various activator signalling pathways that are involved in the control of ovarian follicle activation, including: Neurotropin, nerve growth factor (NGF) and its tyrosine receptor kinase (NTRK1), neurotrophin 4 (NT4), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and their receptor NTRK2. Additional ligands have a role in facilitating primordial follicle activation such as transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-B), growth differentiation factor 9 (GDF9) and bone morphogenic protein 15 (BMP15).\n\nFollicular activation rate is increased in experiments where recombinant GDF9 is added. Additionally, in vitro addition of GDF9 to human ovarian cortical tissue causes enhanced activation and follicular survival. Removing GDF9 from mice, through knock-out experiments, halts follicle progression beyond the first stage, and prevents granulosa cell proliferation. However, these GDF9 null mice have accelerated oocyte growth, suggesting that GDF9 is partially responsible for granulosa cell recruitment, as well as inhibiting oocyte growth. GDF9 promotes follicular survival and growth as a result of dampened granulosa apoptosis and follicular atresia.\n\nAs discussed above TGF-β ligands, for example BMP4 and 7 have a role in follicular activation. SMADS are downstream molecules of the TGF-β signalling pathway, hence rely on TGF-β for activation. In the absence of SMADs, mice have decreased folliculogenesis, with decreased quantities of primordial follicles, as well as developed adult follicles at both developmental stages. BMP15 has been shown to stimulate granulosa cell growth by encouraging proliferation of undifferentiated granulosa cells. This is not dependent on FSH. It was shown that two proliferation markers, Ki-67 and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), are regulated by these factors. Additionally, PCNA has been suggested to act as a key regulator of ovarian follicle development. The temporal expression of PCNA in oocytes is coincident with the start of primordial follicle formation. PCNA promotes apoptosis of oocytes, which regulates primordial follicle assembly.\n\nAnother molecule that has been implicated in the activation of oocyte follicles is Forkhead boxL2 (Foxl2). In knock out studies, it has been shown that Foxl2 may be responsible for the cuboidal transition of the pre-granulosa cells. Hence, when Foxl2 is removed, the primordial follicles are unable to develop into secondary follicles.\n\nSpermatogenesis-and-oogenesis-specific basic helix-loop-helix containing protein 1 (Sohlh1) is expressed within germ cell clusters and in new primordial follicles. Knock out studies of this protein in mice show a reduced number of oocytes present at 7 weeks post birth and a malfunction in the transition from primordial to primary follicle.\n\nPhosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) is a tumour suppressor gene whose actions directly affect the activation of primordial follicles. It does this by negatively controlling the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway. This particular action of PTEN was initially discovered in an experiment using PTEN knockout mice. The absence of PTEN within the primordial follicles lead to an increase in AKT phosphorylation. This then creates a subsequent rise in FOXO3 export, as AKT is no longer inhibiting its production. This led to over-activation of the primordial follicles, which resulted in a premature decline of the primordial follicle pool.\n\nWhen Foxo3 is KO in mice models a huge uncontrolled activation of follicles is seen thus the mouse ovaries are deficient of the entire pool of primordial follicles because they have been prematurely activated. This action is regulated by phosphorylation, the unphosphorylated form is transcriptionally active in the nucleus. However, when phosphorylation occurs the protein is transported to the cytoplasm and loses its transcriptional activity. Pelosi et al. noted that the timing and level of the Foxo3 expression is very important to regulate ovarian follicle activation.\n\nAKt- PTEN-AKt and Foxo3 are all involved in the same pathway. PTEN is situated upstream of AKt. Therefore, if PTEN is deleted specifically from an oocyte this causes an increase in AKt activity resulting in large numbers of dormant ovarian follicles resuming their growth and differentiation. The TSC complex also plays an important role in this pathways by suppressing the activity of mTOR which has been proven to be essential for maintaining dormancy.\n\nTuberin/tuberous sclerosis complex is also thought to be important in the regulation of primordial follicle activation. TSC negatively controls the function of mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin). TSC knockout mice have a raised level of mTORC1 activity. Suppressing mTORC1 is a necessary process to prevent primordial follicles from being prematurely activated and therefore premature ovarian insufficiency.\n\nAMH (Anti-mullerian Hormone) is a member of the transforming growth factor beta (TGF-b), that has a very important role in regulating both testicular and ovarian function. In the first instance AMH inhibits the initial enrollment of the resting primordial follicles. Secondly AMH prevents the regulation of preantral/small antral follicle growth by reducing their responsiveness to FSH.\n\nP27 inhibits cell cycle progression at the G1 phase by preventing the action of cyclin E-Cdk2. Due to its’ important role in the cell cycle, it is found within the nucleus of mice oocytes in primordial and primary follicles. During puberty of p27 knock out mice, all primordial follicles are activated and leads to POF. This indicates that p27 is a vital regulator in maintaining a quiescent state in primordial follicles.\n\nPremature ovarian failure (POF), or premature ovarian insufficiency (POI), is a female reproductive disorder characterised by at least 4 months of primary or secondary amenorrhea, before the age of 40. It is caused by either a decrease in the primordial follicle pool, accelerated atresia of follicles or altered maturation or recruitment of primordial follicles and is associated with menopausal levels of follicle stimulating hormones, exceeding 40 Ul/L. Specific activator and suppressor genes are implicated in ovarian follicle activation and recent research suggests that POF may be the consequence of a genetic mutation in one or more of these genes.\n\nFOXL2 - FOXL2 knockout mouse models showed failure of granulosa cell differentiation, which led to the premature activation and depletion of primordial follicles, characteristic of POF. Two different variations of mutations in the FOXL2 gene, which cause different forms of POF, one with earlier onset and the other with later onset and incomplete penetrance, have been identified. Additionally, mutations in the FOXL2 gene have been found in approximately 5% of nonsyndromic POF patients, which suggests that FOXL2 mutations are also associated with idiopathic POF.\n\nBMP15 and GDF9 - Mutations in BMP15 and GDF9 genes can be involved in POF, but are not major causes of the disease. For example, low GDF9 mutation frequency has been found in a large cohort of Indian cases of POF.\n\nSOHLH1 - Little is known about the causative association of SOHLH1 and POF, however three novel SOHLH1 variants have been found to potentially cause the disease and when studied, they were absent in controls.\n\nAMH - A decrease in AMH expression in POF antral follicles leads to defective antral development.\n\nmTORC1 and PI3K - Deregulation of mTORC1 and PI3K signaling pathways in oocytes results in ovarian pathological conditions, including POF and subsequent infertility.\n\nPTEN - Studies of mice with a deletion in PTEN in the oocytes showed early activation of the entire pool of primordial follicles, leading to a lack of primordial follicles in adulthood, resulting in a POF phenotype.\n\nFoxo3a - Studies into mice with complete and partial Foxo3a deletions also showed premature activation of the entire primordial follicle pool, destroying the ovarian reserve and leading to oocyte death. This led to a POF phenotype, seen in studies in a range of countries.\n\nTSC - In the oocytes of Tsc2 knockout mice, elevated mTORC1 activity causes the pool of primordial follicles to become activated prematurely. This results in follicle depletion in early adulthood, causing POF.\n\nAs well as having many genetic causes, premature ovarian failure has been shown to be a side effect of many chemotherapeutic agents. The damage suffered by ovaries appears to be dose-dependent, and a class of chemotherapy drugs known as alkylating agents, seem to cause the most damage to the ovary and follicles. There are two ways in which this damage occurs:\nChemotherapeutic agents, such as Cyclophosphamide, have been shown to activate the PI3K/PTEN/Akr pathway, which is the main pathway involved in keeping the follicles dormant and permitting them to grow - activation of this pathway encourages more primordial follicles to grow and develop. These growing follicles may then be destroyed in subsequent rounds of chemotherapy, which often target growing cells, which will then cause more primordial follicles to differentiate and grow to replace the destroyed cells. This concept, known as burnout, leads to a depletion of the ovarian reserve and results in premature ovarian failure.\n\nOocyte cryopreservation is a preservative process which can be used as a way of preserving fertility in children treated for childhood or adolescent cancer, and to avoid the damage caused to the ovaries caused by cytotoxic drugs often used in chemotherapy. There are several methods of cryopreservation, each with different levels of effectiveness. After cryopreservation, the ovarian tissue must be placed back into the patient, in order to allow the ovary to function normally again and regain fertility.\n\nRestoration of the ovarian function occurs in almost all cases of cryopreservation, but it takes a while for the ovarian follicles to regain full function. In all cases of successful function restoration, it took 3.5-6.5 months after reimplantation before a rise in oestrogen, a key hormone produced by the ovary, and a decrease in follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) were detected.

Similar to phonon, phason is associated with atomic motion. However, whereas phonons are related to \"translation\" of atoms, phasons are associated with atomic \"rearrangements\". As a result of these rearrangements, waves, describing the position of atoms in crystal, change phase, thus the term \"phason\". \n\nThe hydrodynamic theory of the quasicrystals predicts that the conventional (phonon) strain relaxes rapidly. On the contrary, relaxation of the phason strain is diffusive and is much slower. Therefore, metastable quasicrystals grown by rapid quenching from the melt exhibit built-in phason strain associated with shifts and broadenings of X-ray and electron diffraction peaks.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2021871", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2021871", "title": "Planar chirality", "text": "Planar chirality\n\nPlanar chirality is the special case of chirality for two dimensions.\n\nMost fundamentally, planar chirality is a mathematical term, finding use in chemistry, physics and related physical sciences, for example, in astronomy, optics and metamaterials. Recent occurrences in latter two fields are dominated by microwave applications and micro- and nanostructured planar interfaces for visible and infrared light.\n\nThis term is used in chemistry contexts, e.g., for a chiral molecule lacking an asymmetric carbon atom, but possessing two non-coplanar rings that are each dissymmetric and which cannot easily rotate about the chemical bond connecting them: 2,2'-dimethylbiphenyl is perhaps the simplest example of this case. Planar chirality is also exhibited by molecules like (\"E\")-cyclooctene, some di- or poly-substituted metallocenes, and certain monosubstituted paracyclophanes. Nature rarely provides planar chiral molecules, cavicularin being an exception.\n\nTo assign the configuration of a planar chiral molecule, begin by selecting the pilot atom, which is the highest priority of the atoms that is not in the plane, but are directly attached to an atom in the plane. Next, assign the priority of three adjacent in-plane atoms, starting with the atom attached to the pilot atom as priority 1, and preferentially assigning in order of highest priority if there is a choice. When viewed from the side of the pilot atom, if the three atoms form a clockwise direction when followed in order of priority, the molecule is assigned as R, otherwise it is assigned as S.\n\nThe study of planar chiral metamaterials has revealed that planar chirality is associated with an optical effect: the directionally asymmetric transmission (reflection and absorption) of circularly polarized waves. Planar chiral metamaterials, which are also anisotropic and lossy exhibit different total transmission (reflection and absorption) levels for the same circularly polarized wave incident on their front and back.\nThe asymmetric transmission phenomenon arises from different, e.g. left-to-right, circular polarization conversion efficiencies for opposite propagation directions of the incident wave and therefore the effect is referred to as circular conversion dichroism.\nLike the twist of a planar chiral pattern appears reversed for opposite directions of observation, planar chiral metamaterials have interchanged properties for left-handed and right-handed circularly polarized waves that are incident on their front and back. In particular left-handed and right-handed circularly polarized waves experience opposite directional transmission (reflection and absorption) asymmetries.\n"}
{"id": "2592906", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2592906", "title": "Planetary habitability", "text": "Planetary habitability\n\nPlanetary habitability is the measure of a planet's or a natural satellite's potential to develop and maintain environments hospitable to life. Life may be generated directly on a planet or satellite endogenously or be transferred to it from another body, a hypothetical process known as panspermia. Environments do not need to contain life to be considered habitable nor are accepted habitable zones the only areas in which life might arise. \n\nAs the existence of life beyond Earth is unknown, planetary habitability is largely an extrapolation of conditions on Earth and the characteristics of the Sun and Solar System which appear favorable to life's flourishing. Of particular interest are those factors that have sustained complex, multicellular organisms on Earth and not just simpler, unicellular creatures. Research and theory in this regard is a component of a number of natural sciences, such as astronomy, planetary science and the emerging discipline of astrobiology.\n\nAn absolute requirement for life is an energy source, and the notion of planetary habitability implies that many other geophysical, geochemical, and astrophysical criteria must be met before an astronomical body can support life. In its astrobiology roadmap, NASA has defined the principal habitability criteria as \"extended regions of liquid water, conditions favorable for the assembly of complex organic molecules, and energy sources to sustain metabolism\". In August 2018, researchers reported that water worlds could support life.\n\nHabitability indicators and biosignatures must be interpreted within a planetary and environmental context. In determining the habitability potential of a body, studies focus on its bulk composition, orbital properties, atmosphere, and potential chemical interactions. Stellar characteristics of importance include mass and luminosity, stable variability, and high metallicity. Rocky, wet terrestrial-type planets and moons with the potential for Earth-like chemistry are a primary focus of astrobiological research, although more speculative habitability theories occasionally examine alternative biochemistries and other types of astronomical bodies.\n\nThe idea that planets beyond Earth might host life is an ancient one, though historically it was framed by philosophy as much as physical science. The late 20th century saw two breakthroughs in the field. The observation and robotic spacecraft exploration of other planets and moons within the Solar System has provided critical information on defining habitability criteria and allowed for substantial geophysical comparisons between the Earth and other bodies. The discovery of extrasolar planets, beginning in the early 1990s and accelerating thereafter, has provided further information for the study of possible extraterrestrial life. These findings confirm that the Sun is not unique among stars in hosting planets and expands the habitability research horizon beyond the Solar System.\n\nThe chemistry of life may have begun shortly after the Big Bang, 13.8 billion years ago, during a habitable epoch when the Universe was only 10–17 million years old. According to the panspermia hypothesis, microscopic life—distributed by meteoroids, asteroids and other small Solar System bodies—may exist throughout the Universe. Nonetheless, Earth is the only place in the Universe known to harbor life. Estimates of habitable zones around other stars, along with the discovery of hundreds of extrasolar planets and new insights into the extreme habitats here on Earth, suggest that there may be many more habitable places in the Universe than considered possible until very recently. On 4 November 2013, astronomers reported, based on \"Kepler\" space mission data, that there could be as many as 40 billion Earth-sized planets orbiting in the habitable zones of Sun-like stars and red dwarfs within the Milky Way. 11 billion of these estimated planets may be orbiting Sun-like stars. The nearest such planet may be 12 light-years away, according to the scientists.\n\nAn understanding of planetary habitability begins with the host star. The classical HZ is defined for surface conditions only; but a metabolism that does not depend on the stellar light, can still exist outside the HZ, thriving in the interior of the planet where liquid water is available.\n\nUnder the auspices of SETI's Project Phoenix, scientists Margaret Turnbull and Jill Tarter developed the \"HabCat\" (or Catalogue of Habitable Stellar Systems) in 2002. The catalogue was formed by winnowing the nearly 120,000 stars of the larger Hipparcos Catalogue into a core group of 17,000 \"HabStars\", and the selection criteria that were used provide a good starting point for understanding which astrophysical factors are necessary to habitable planets. According to research published in August 2015, very large galaxies may be more favorable to the formation and development of habitable planets than smaller galaxies, like the Milky Way galaxy.\n\nHowever, the question of what makes a planet habitable is much more complex than having a planet located at the right distance from its host star so that water can be liquid on its surface: various geophysical and geodynamical aspects, the radiation, and the host star's plasma environment can influence the evolution of planets and life, if it originated. Liquid water is a necessary but not sufficient condition for life as we know it, as habitability is a function of a multitude of environmental parameters\n\nThe spectral class of a star indicates its photospheric temperature, which (for main-sequence stars) correlates to overall mass. The appropriate spectral range for \"HabStars\" is considered to be \"late F\" or \"G\", to \"mid-K\". This corresponds to temperatures of a little more than 7,000 K down to a little less than 4,000 K (6,700 °C to 3,700 °C); the Sun, a G2 star at 5,777 K, is well within these bounds. This spectral range probably accounts for between 5% and 10% of stars in the local Milky Way galaxy. \"Middle-class\" stars of this sort have a number of characteristics considered important to planetary habitability:\n\nK-type stars may be able to support life far longer than the Sun.\nWhether fainter late K and M class red dwarf stars are also suitable hosts for habitable planets is perhaps the most important open question in the entire field of planetary habitability given their prevalence (habitability of red dwarf systems). Gliese 581 c, a \"super-Earth\", has been found orbiting in the \"habitable zone\" (HZ) of a red dwarf and may possess liquid water. However it is also possible that a greenhouse effect may render it too hot to support life, while its neighbor, Gliese 581 d, may be a more likely candidate for habitability. In September 2010, the discovery was announced of another planet, Gliese 581 g, in an orbit between these two planets. However, reviews of the discovery have placed the existence of this planet in doubt, and it is listed as \"unconfirmed\". In September 2012, the discovery of two planets orbiting Gliese 163 was announced. One of the planets, Gliese 163 c, about 6.9 times the mass of Earth and somewhat hotter, was considered to be within the habitable zone.\n\nA recent study suggests that cooler stars that emit more light in the infrared and near infrared may actually host warmer planets with less ice and incidence of snowball states. These wavelengths are absorbed by their planets' ice and greenhouse gases and remain warmer.\n\nThe habitable zone (HZ) is a shell-shaped region of space surrounding a star in which a planet could maintain liquid water on its surface. The concept was first proposed by astrophysicist Su-Shu Huang in 1959, based on climatic constraints imposed by the host star. After an energy source, liquid water is considered the most important ingredient for life, considering how integral it is to all life systems on Earth. This may reflect the known dependence of life on water; however, if life is discovered in the absence of water, the definition of an HZ may have to be greatly expanded. \n\nThe inner edge of the HZ is the distance where runaway greenhouse effect vaporize the whole water reservoir and, as a second effect, induce the photodissociation of water vapor and the loss of hydrogen to space. The outer edge of the HZ is the distance from the star where a maximum greenhouse effect fails to keep the surface of the planet above the freezing point, and by condensation.\n\nA \"stable\" HZ implies two factors. First, the range of an HZ should not vary greatly over time. All stars increase in luminosity as they age, and a given HZ thus migrates outwards, but if this happens too quickly (for example, with a super-massive star) planets may only have a brief window inside the HZ and a correspondingly smaller chance of developing life. Calculating an HZ range and its long-term movement is never straightforward, as negative feedback loops such as the CNO cycle will tend to offset the increases in luminosity. Assumptions made about atmospheric conditions and geology thus have as great an impact on a putative HZ range as does stellar evolution: the proposed parameters of the Sun's HZ, for example, have fluctuated greatly.\n\nSecond, no large-mass body such as a gas giant should be present in or relatively close to the HZ, thus disrupting the formation of Earth-size bodies. The matter in the asteroid belt, for example, appears to have been unable to accrete into a planet due to orbital resonances with Jupiter; if the giant had appeared in the region that is now between the orbits of Venus and Mars, Earth would almost certainly not have developed in its present form. However a gas giant inside the HZ might have habitable moons under the right conditions.\n\nIn the Solar System, the inner planets are terrestrial, and the outer ones are gas giants, but discoveries of extrasolar planets suggest that this arrangement may not be at all common: numerous Jupiter-sized bodies have been found in close orbit about their primary, disrupting potential HZs. However, present data for extrasolar planets is likely to be skewed towards that type (large planets in close orbits) because they are far easier to identify; thus it remains to be seen which type of planetary system is the norm, or indeed if there is one.\n\nChanges in luminosity are common to all stars, but the severity of such fluctuations covers a broad range. Most stars are relatively stable, but a significant minority of variable stars often undergo sudden and intense increases in luminosity and consequently in the amount of energy radiated toward bodies in orbit. These stars are considered poor candidates for hosting life-bearing planets, as their unpredictability and energy output changes would negatively impact organisms: living things adapted to a specific temperature range could not survive too great a temperature variation. Further, upswings in luminosity are generally accompanied by massive doses of gamma ray and X-ray radiation which might prove lethal. Atmospheres do mitigate such effects, but their atmosphere might not be retained by planets orbiting variables, because the high-frequency energy buffeting these planets would continually strip them of their protective covering.\n\nThe Sun, in this respect as in many others, is relatively benign: the variation between its maximum and minimum energy output is roughly 0.1% over its 11-year solar cycle. There is strong (though not undisputed) evidence that even minor changes in the Sun's luminosity have had significant effects on the Earth's climate well within the historical era: the Little Ice Age of the mid-second millennium, for instance, may have been caused by a relatively long-term decline in the Sun's luminosity. Thus, a star does not have to be a true variable for differences in luminosity to affect habitability. Of known solar analogs, one that closely resembles the Sun is considered to be 18 Scorpii; unfortunately for the prospects of life existing in its proximity, the only significant difference between the two bodies is the amplitude of the solar cycle, which appears to be much greater for 18 Scorpii.\n\nWhile the bulk of material in any star is hydrogen and helium, there is a significant variation in the amount of heavier elements (metals). A high proportion of metals in a star correlates to the amount of heavy material initially available in the protoplanetary disk. A smaller amount of metal makes the formation of planets much less likely, under the solar nebula theory of planetary system formation. Any planets that did form around a metal-poor star would probably be low in mass, and thus unfavorable for life. Spectroscopic studies of systems where exoplanets have been found to date confirm the relationship between high metal content and planet formation: \"Stars with planets, or at least with planets similar to the ones we are finding today, are clearly more metal rich than stars without planetary companions.\" This relationship between high metallicity and planet formation also means that habitable systems are more likely to be found around stars of younger generations, since stars that formed early in the universe's history have low metal content.\n\nHabitability indicators and biosignatures must be interpreted within a planetary and environmental context. Whether a planet will emerge as habitable depends on the sequence of events that led to its formation, which could include the production of organic molecules in molecular clouds and protoplanetary disks, delivery of materials during and after planetary accretion, and the orbital location in the planetary system. The chief assumption about habitable planets is that they are terrestrial. Such planets, roughly within one order of magnitude of Earth mass, are primarily composed of silicate rocks, and have not accreted the gaseous outer layers of hydrogen and helium found on gas giants. The possibility that life could evolve in the cloud tops of giant planets has not been decisively ruled out, though it is considered unlikely, as they have no surface and their gravity is enormous. The natural satellites of giant planets, meanwhile, remain valid candidates for hosting life.\n\nIn February 2011 the Kepler Space Observatory Mission team released a list of 1235 extrasolar planet candidates, including 54 that may be in the habitable zone. Six of the candidates in this zone are smaller than twice the size of Earth. A more recent study found that one of these candidates (KOI 326.01) is much larger and hotter than first reported. Based on the findings, the Kepler team estimated there to be \"at least 50 billion planets in the Milky Way\" of which \"at least 500 million\" are in the habitable zone.\n\nIn analyzing which environments are likely to support life, a distinction is usually made between simple, unicellular organisms such as bacteria and archaea and complex metazoans (animals). Unicellularity necessarily precedes multicellularity in any hypothetical tree of life, and where single-celled organisms do emerge there is no assurance that greater complexity will then develop. The planetary characteristics listed below are considered crucial for life generally, but in every case multicellular organisms are more picky than unicellular life.\n\nLow-mass planets are poor candidates for life for two reasons. First, their lesser gravity makes atmosphere retention difficult. Constituent molecules are more likely to reach escape velocity and be lost to space when buffeted by solar wind or stirred by collision. Planets without a thick atmosphere lack the matter necessary for primal biochemistry, have little insulation and poor heat transfer across their surfaces (for example, Mars, with its thin atmosphere, is colder than the Earth would be if it were at a similar distance from the Sun), and provide less protection against meteoroids and high-frequency radiation. Further, where an atmosphere is less dense than 0.006 Earth atmospheres, water cannot exist in liquid form as the required atmospheric pressure, 4.56 mm Hg (608 Pa) (0.18 inch Hg), does not occur. The temperature range at which water is liquid is smaller at low pressures generally.\n\nSecondly, smaller planets have smaller diameters and thus higher surface-to-volume ratios than their larger cousins. Such bodies tend to lose the energy left over from their formation quickly and end up geologically dead, lacking the volcanoes, earthquakes and tectonic activity which supply the surface with life-sustaining material and the atmosphere with temperature moderators like carbon dioxide. Plate tectonics appear particularly crucial, at least on Earth: not only does the process recycle important chemicals and minerals, it also fosters bio-diversity through continent creation and increased environmental complexity and helps create the convective cells necessary to generate Earth's magnetic field.\n\n\"Low mass\" is partly a relative label: the Earth is low mass when compared to the Solar System's gas giants, but it is the largest, by diameter and mass, and the densest of all terrestrial bodies. It is large enough to retain an atmosphere through gravity alone and large enough that its molten core remains a heat engine, driving the diverse geology of the surface (the decay of radioactive elements within a planet's core is the other significant component of planetary heating). Mars, by contrast, is nearly (or perhaps totally) geologically dead and has lost much of its atmosphere. Thus it would be fair to infer that the lower mass limit for habitability lies somewhere between that of Mars and that of Earth or Venus: 0.3 Earth masses has been offered as a rough dividing line for habitable planets. However, a 2008 study by the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics suggests that the dividing line may be higher. Earth may in fact lie on the lower boundary of habitability: if it were any smaller, plate tectonics would be impossible. Venus, which has 85% of Earth's mass, shows no signs of tectonic activity. Conversely, \"super-Earths\", terrestrial planets with higher masses than Earth, would have higher levels of plate tectonics and thus be firmly placed in the habitable range.\n\nExceptional circumstances do offer exceptional cases: Jupiter's moon Io (which is smaller than any of the terrestrial planets) is volcanically dynamic because of the gravitational stresses induced by its orbit, and its neighbor Europa may have a liquid ocean or icy slush underneath a frozen shell also due to power generated from orbiting a gas giant.\n\nSaturn's Titan, meanwhile, has an outside chance of harbouring life, as it has retained a thick atmosphere and has liquid methane seas on its surface. Organic-chemical reactions that only require minimum energy are possible in these seas, but whether any living system can be based on such minimal reactions is unclear, and would seem unlikely. These satellites are exceptions, but they prove that mass, as a criterion for habitability, cannot necessarily be considered definitive at this stage of our understanding.\n\nA larger planet is likely to have a more massive atmosphere. A combination of higher escape velocity to retain lighter atoms, and extensive outgassing from enhanced plate tectonics may greatly increase the atmospheric pressure and temperature at the surface compared to Earth. The enhanced greenhouse effect of such a heavy atmosphere would tend to suggest that the habitable zone should be further out from the central star for such massive planets.\n\nFinally, a larger planet is likely to have a large iron core. This allows for a magnetic field to protect the planet from stellar wind and cosmic radiation, which otherwise would tend to strip away planetary atmosphere and to bombard living things with ionized particles. Mass is not the only criterion for producing a magnetic field—as the planet must also rotate fast enough to produce a dynamo effect within its core—but it is a significant component of the process.\n\nAs with other criteria, stability is the critical consideration in evaluating the effect of orbital and rotational characteristics on planetary habitability. Orbital eccentricity is the difference between a planet's farthest and closest approach to its parent star divided by the sum of said distances. It is a ratio describing the shape of the elliptical orbit. The greater the eccentricity the greater the temperature fluctuation on a planet's surface. Although they are adaptive, living organisms can stand only so much variation, particularly if the fluctuations overlap both the freezing point and boiling point of the planet's main biotic solvent (e.g., water on Earth). If, for example, Earth's oceans were alternately boiling and freezing solid, it is difficult to imagine life as we know it having evolved. The more complex the organism, the greater the temperature sensitivity. The Earth's orbit is almost wholly circular, with an eccentricity of less than 0.02; other planets in the Solar System (with the exception of Mercury) have eccentricities that are similarly benign.\n\nHabitability is also influenced by the architecture of the planetary system around a star. The evolution and stability of these systems are determined by gravitational dynamics, which drive the orbital evolution of terrestrial planets. Data collected on the orbital eccentricities of extrasolar planets has surprised most researchers: 90% have an orbital eccentricity greater than that found within the Solar System, and the average is fully 0.25. This means that the vast majority of planets have highly eccentric orbits and of these, even if their average distance from their star is deemed to be within the HZ, they nonetheless would be spending only a small portion of their time within the zone.\n\nA planet's movement around its rotational axis must also meet certain criteria if life is to have the opportunity to evolve. A first assumption is that the planet should have moderate seasons. If there is little or no axial tilt (or obliquity) relative to the perpendicular of the ecliptic, seasons will not occur and a main stimulant to biospheric dynamism will disappear. The planet would also be colder than it would be with a significant tilt: when the greatest intensity of radiation is always within a few degrees of the equator, warm weather cannot move poleward and a planet's climate becomes dominated by colder polar weather systems.\n\nIf a planet is radically tilted, seasons will be extreme and make it more difficult for a biosphere to achieve homeostasis. The axial tilt of the Earth is higher now (in the Quaternary) than it has been in the past, coinciding with reduced polar ice, warmer temperatures and \"less\" seasonal variation. Scientists do not know whether this trend will continue indefinitely with further increases in axial tilt (see Snowball Earth).\n\nThe exact effects of these changes can only be computer modelled at present, and studies have shown that even extreme tilts of up to 85 degrees do not absolutely preclude life \"provided it does not occupy continental surfaces plagued seasonally by the highest temperature.\" Not only the mean axial tilt, but also its variation over time must be considered. The Earth's tilt varies between 21.5 and 24.5 degrees over 41,000 years. A more drastic variation, or a much shorter periodicity, would induce climatic effects such as variations in seasonal severity.\n\nOther orbital considerations include:\n\nThe Earth's Moon appears to play a crucial role in moderating the Earth's climate by stabilising the axial tilt. It has been suggested that a chaotic tilt may be a \"deal-breaker\" in terms of habitability—i.e. a satellite the size of the Moon is not only helpful but required to produce stability. This position remains controversial.\n\nIn the case of the Earth, the sole Moon is sufficiently massive and orbits so as to significantly contribute to ocean tides, which in turn aids the dynamic churning of Earth's large liquid water oceans. These lunar forces not only help ensure that the oceans do not stagnate, but also play a critical role in Earth's dynamic climate.\n\nIt is generally assumed that any extraterrestrial life that might exist will be based on the same fundamental biochemistry as found on Earth, as the four elements most vital for life, carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen, are also the most common chemically reactive elements in the universe. Indeed, simple biogenic compounds, such as very simple amino acids such as glycine, have been found in meteorites and in the interstellar medium. These four elements together comprise over 96% of Earth's collective biomass. Carbon has an unparalleled ability to bond with itself and to form a massive array of intricate and varied structures, making it an ideal material for the complex mechanisms that form living cells. Hydrogen and oxygen, in the form of water, compose the solvent in which biological processes take place and in which the first reactions occurred that led to life's emergence. The energy released in the formation of powerful covalent bonds between carbon and oxygen, available by oxidizing organic compounds, is the fuel of all complex life-forms. These four elements together make up amino acids, which in turn are the building blocks of proteins, the substance of living tissue. In addition, neither sulfur, required for the building of proteins, nor phosphorus, needed for the formation of DNA, RNA, and the adenosine phosphates essential to metabolism, is rare.\n\nRelative abundance in space does not always mirror differentiated abundance within planets; of the four life elements, for instance, only oxygen is present in any abundance in the Earth's crust. This can be partly explained by the fact that many of these elements, such as hydrogen and nitrogen, along with their simplest and most common compounds, such as carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, methane, ammonia, and water, are gaseous at warm temperatures. In the hot region close to the Sun, these volatile compounds could not have played a significant role in the planets' geological formation. Instead, they were trapped as gases underneath the newly formed crusts, which were largely made of rocky, involatile compounds such as silica (a compound of silicon and oxygen, accounting for oxygen's relative abundance). Outgassing of volatile compounds through the first volcanoes would have contributed to the formation of the planets' atmospheres. The Miller–Urey experiment showed that, with the application of energy, simple inorganic compounds exposed to a primordial atmosphere can react to synthesize amino acids.\n\nEven so, volcanic outgassing could not have accounted for the amount of water in Earth's oceans. The vast majority of the water —and arguably carbon— necessary for life must have come from the outer Solar System, away from the Sun's heat, where it could remain solid. Comets impacting with the Earth in the Solar System's early years would have deposited vast amounts of water, along with the other volatile compounds life requires onto the early Earth, providing a kick-start to the origin of life.\n\nThus, while there is reason to suspect that the four \"life elements\" ought to be readily available elsewhere, a habitable system probably also requires a supply of long-term orbiting bodies to seed inner planets. Without comets there is a possibility that life as we know it would not exist on Earth.\n\nOne important qualification to habitability criteria is that only a tiny portion of a planet is required to support life. Astrobiologists often concern themselves with \"micro-environments\", noting that \"we lack a fundamental understanding of how evolutionary forces, such as mutation, selection, and genetic drift, operate in micro-organisms that act on and respond to changing micro-environments.\" Extremophiles are Earth organisms that live in niche environments under severe conditions generally considered inimical to life. Usually (although not always) unicellular, extremophiles include acutely alkaliphilic and acidophilic organisms and others that can survive water temperatures above 100 °C in hydrothermal vents.\n\nThe discovery of life in extreme conditions has complicated definitions of habitability, but also generated much excitement amongst researchers in greatly broadening the known range of conditions under which life can persist. For example, a planet that might otherwise be unable to support an atmosphere given the solar conditions in its vicinity, might be able to do so within a deep shadowed rift or volcanic cave. Similarly, craterous terrain might offer a refuge for primitive life. The Lawn Hill crater has been studied as an astrobiological analog, with researchers suggesting rapid sediment infill created a protected microenvironment for microbial organisms; similar conditions may have occurred over the geological history of Mars.\n\nEarth environments that \"cannot\" support life are still instructive to astrobiologists in defining the limits of what organisms can endure. The heart of the Atacama desert, generally considered the driest place on Earth, appears unable to support life, and it has been subject to study by NASA and ESA for that reason: it provides a Mars analog and the moisture gradients along its edges are ideal for studying the boundary between sterility and habitability. The Atacama was the subject of study in 2003 that partly replicated experiments from the Viking landings on Mars in the 1970s; no DNA could be recovered from two soil samples, and incubation experiments were also negative for biosignatures.\n\nThe two current ecological approaches for predicting the potential habitability use 19 or 20 environmental factors, with emphasis on water availability, temperature, presence of nutrients, an energy source, and protection from solar ultraviolet and galactic cosmic radiation.\n\nIn determining the feasibility of extraterrestrial life, astronomers had long focused their attention on stars like the Sun. However, since planetary systems that resemble the Solar System are proving to be rare, they have begun to explore the possibility that life might form in systems very unlike our own.\n\nTypical estimates often suggest that 50% or more of all stellar systems are binary systems. This may be partly sample bias, as massive and bright stars tend to be in binaries and these are most easily observed and catalogued; a more precise analysis has suggested that the more common fainter stars are usually singular, and that up to two thirds of all stellar systems are therefore solitary.\n\nThe separation between stars in a binary may range from less than one astronomical unit (AU, the average Earth–Sun distance) to several hundred. In latter instances, the gravitational effects will be negligible on a planet orbiting an otherwise suitable star and habitability potential will not be disrupted unless the orbit is highly eccentric (see Nemesis, for example). However, where the separation is significantly less, a stable orbit may be impossible. If a planet's distance to its primary exceeds about one fifth of the closest approach of the other star, orbital stability is not guaranteed. Whether planets might form in binaries at all had long been unclear, given that gravitational forces might interfere with planet formation. Theoretical work by Alan Boss at the Carnegie Institution has shown that gas giants can form around stars in binary systems much as they do around solitary stars.\n\nOne study of Alpha Centauri, the nearest star system to the Sun, suggested that binaries need not be discounted in the search for habitable planets. Centauri A and B have an 11 AU distance at closest approach (23 AU mean), and both should have stable habitable zones. A study of long-term orbital stability for simulated planets within the system shows that planets within approximately three AU of either star may remain rather stable (i.e. the semi-major axis deviating by less than 5% during 32 000 binary periods). The HZ for Centauri A is conservatively estimated at 1.2 to 1.3 AU and Centauri B at 0.73 to 0.74—well within the stable region in both cases.\n\nDetermining the habitability of red dwarf stars could help determine how common life in the universe might be, as red dwarfs make up between 70 and 90% of all the stars in the galaxy.\n\nAstronomers for many years ruled out red dwarfs as potential abodes for life. Their small size (from 0.08 to 0.45 solar masses) means that their nuclear reactions proceed exceptionally slowly, and they emit very little light (from 3% of that produced by the Sun to as little as 0.01%). Any planet in orbit around a red dwarf would have to huddle very close to its parent star to attain Earth-like surface temperatures; from 0.3 AU (just inside the orbit of Mercury) for a star like Lacaille 8760, to as little as 0.032 AU for a star like Proxima Centauri (such a world would have a year lasting just 6.3 days). At those distances, the star's gravity would cause tidal locking. One side of the planet would eternally face the star, while the other would always face away from it. The only ways in which potential life could avoid either an inferno or a deep freeze would be if the planet had an atmosphere thick enough to transfer the star's heat from the day side to the night side, or if there was a gas giant in the habitable zone, with a habitable moon, which would be locked to the planet instead of the star, allowing a more even distribution of radiation over the planet. It was long assumed that such a thick atmosphere would prevent sunlight from reaching the surface in the first place, preventing photosynthesis.\n\nThis pessimism has been tempered by research. Studies by Robert Haberle and Manoj Joshi of NASA's Ames Research Center in California have shown that a planet's atmosphere (assuming it included greenhouse gases CO and HO) need only be 100 mbs, or 10% of Earth's atmosphere, for the star's heat to be effectively carried to the night side. This is well within the levels required for photosynthesis, though water would still remain frozen on the dark side in some of their models. Martin Heath of Greenwich Community College, has shown that seawater, too, could be effectively circulated without freezing solid if the ocean basins were deep enough to allow free flow beneath the night side's ice cap. Further research—including a consideration of the amount of photosynthetically active radiation—suggested that tidally locked planets in red dwarf systems might at least be habitable for higher plants.\n\nSize is not the only factor in making red dwarfs potentially unsuitable for life, however. On a red dwarf planet, photosynthesis on the night side would be impossible, since it would never see the sun. On the day side, because the sun does not rise or set, areas in the shadows of mountains would remain so forever. Photosynthesis as we understand it would be complicated by the fact that a red dwarf produces most of its radiation in the infrared, and on the Earth the process depends on visible light. There are potential positives to this scenario. Numerous terrestrial ecosystems rely on chemosynthesis rather than photosynthesis, for instance, which would be possible in a red dwarf system. A static primary star position removes the need for plants to steer leaves toward the sun, deal with changing shade/sun patterns, or change from photosynthesis to stored energy during night. Because of the lack of a day-night cycle, including the weak light of morning and evening, far more energy would be available at a given radiation level.\n\nRed dwarfs are far more variable and violent than their more stable, larger cousins. Often they are covered in starspots that can dim their emitted light by up to 40% for months at a time, while at other times they emit gigantic flares that can double their brightness in a matter of minutes. Such variation would be very damaging for life, as it would not only destroy any complex organic molecules that could possibly form biological precursors, but also because it would blow off sizeable portions of the planet's atmosphere.\n\nFor a planet around a red dwarf star to support life, it would require a rapidly rotating magnetic field to protect it from the flares. A tidally locked planet rotates only very slowly, and so cannot produce a geodynamo at its core. The violent flaring period of a red dwarf's life cycle is estimated to only last roughly the first 1.2 billion years of its existence. If a planet forms far away from a red dwarf so as to avoid tidal locking, and then migrates into the star's habitable zone after this turbulent initial period, it is possible that life may have a chance to develop. However, given its age, at 7–12 billion years of age, Barnard's Star is considerably older than the Sun. It was long assumed to be quiescent in terms of stellar activity. Yet, in 1998, astronomers observed an intense stellar flare, surprisingly showing that Barnard's Star is, despite its age, a flare star.\n\nThere is, however, one major advantage that red dwarfs have over other stars as abodes for life: they live a long time. It took 4.5 billion years before humanity appeared on Earth, and life as we know it will see suitable conditions for 1 to 2.3 more. Red dwarfs, by contrast, could live for trillions of years because their nuclear reactions are far slower than those of larger stars, meaning that life would have longer to evolve and survive.\n\nWhile the odds of finding a planet in the habitable zone around any specific red dwarf are slim, the total amount of habitable zone around all red dwarfs combined is equal to the total amount around Sun-like stars given their ubiquity. Furthermore, this total amount of habitable zone will last longer, because red dwarf stars live for hundreds of billions of years or even longer on the main sequence.\n\nRecent research suggests that very large stars, greater than ~100 solar masses, could have planetary systems consisting of hundreds of Mercury-sized planets within the habitable zone. Such systems could also contain brown dwarfs and low-mass stars (~0.1–0.3 solar masses). However the very short lifespans of stars of more than a few solar masses would scarcely allow time for a planet to cool, let alone the time needed for a stable biosphere to develop. Massive stars are thus eliminated as possible abodes for life.\n\nHowever, a massive-star system could be a progenitor of life in another way – the supernova explosion of the massive star in the central part of the system. This supernova will disperse heavier elements throughout its vicinity, created during the phase when the massive star has moved off of the main sequence, and the systems of the potential low-mass stars (which are still on the main sequence) within the former massive-star system may be enriched with the relatively large supply of the heavy elements so close to a supernova explosion. However, this states nothing about what types of planets would form as a result of the supernova material, or what their habitability potential would be.\n\nIn a review of the factors which are important for the evolution of habitable Earth-sized planets, Lammer et al. proposed a classification of four water-dependant habitat types:\n\nClass I habitats are planetary bodies on which stellar and geophysical conditions allow liquid water to be available at the surface, along with sunlight, so that complex multicellular organisms may originate.\n\nClass II habitats include bodies which initially enjoy Earth-like conditions, but do not keep their ability to sustain liquid water on their surface due to stellar or geophysical conditions. Mars, and possibly Venus are examples of this class where complex life forms may not develop.\n\nClass III habitats are planetary bodies where liquid water oceans exist below the surface, where they can interact directly with a silicate-rich core. \n\nClass IV habitats have liquid water layers between two ice layers, or liquids above ice. \n\nAlong with the characteristics of planets and their star systems, the wider galactic environment may also impact habitability. Scientists considered the possibility that particular areas of galaxies (galactic habitable zones) are better suited to life than others; the Solar System in which we live, in the Orion Spur, on the Milky Way galaxy's edge is considered to be in a life-favorable spot:\n\nThus, relative isolation is ultimately what a life-bearing system needs. If the Sun were crowded amongst other systems, the chance of being fatally close to dangerous radiation sources would increase significantly. Further, close neighbors might disrupt the stability of various orbiting bodies such as Oort cloud and Kuiper belt objects, which can bring catastrophe if knocked into the inner Solar System.\n\nWhile stellar crowding proves disadvantageous to habitability, so too does extreme isolation. A star as metal-rich as the Sun would probably not have formed in the very outermost regions of the Milky Way given a decline in the relative abundance of metals and a general lack of star formation. Thus, a \"suburban\" location, such as the Solar System enjoys, is preferable to a Galaxy's center or farthest reaches.\n\nWhile most investigations of extraterrestrial life start with the assumption that advanced life-forms must have similar requirements for life as on Earth, the hypothesis of other types of biochemistry suggests the possibility of lifeforms evolving around a different metabolic mechanism. In \"Evolving the Alien\", biologist Jack Cohen and mathematician Ian Stewart argue astrobiology, based on the Rare Earth hypothesis, is restrictive and unimaginative. They suggest that Earth-like planets may be very rare, but non-carbon-based complex life could possibly emerge in other environments. The most frequently mentioned alternative to carbon is silicon-based life, while ammonia and hydrocarbons are sometimes suggested as alternative solvents to water. The astrobiologist Dirk Schulze-Makuch and other scientists have proposed a Planet Habitability Index whose criteria include \"potential for holding a liquid solvent\" that is not necessarily restricted to water.\n\nMore speculative ideas have focused on bodies altogether different from Earth-like planets. Astronomer Frank Drake, a well-known proponent of the search for extraterrestrial life, imagined life on a neutron star: submicroscopic \"nuclear molecules\" combining to form creatures with a life cycle millions of times quicker than Earth life. Called \"imaginative and tongue-in-cheek\", the idea gave rise to science fiction depictions. Carl Sagan, another optimist with regards to extraterrestrial life, considered the possibility of organisms that are always airborne within the high atmosphere of Jupiter in a 1976 paper. Cohen and Stewart also envisioned life in both a solar environment and in the atmosphere of a gas giant.\n\n\"Good Jupiters\" are gas giants, like the Solar System's Jupiter, that orbit their stars in circular orbits far enough away from the habitable zone not to disturb it but close enough to \"protect\" terrestrial planets in closer orbit in two critical ways. First, they help to stabilize the orbits, and thereby the climates of the inner planets. Second, they keep the inner stellar system relatively free of comets and asteroids that could cause devastating impacts. Jupiter orbits the Sun at about five times the distance between the Earth and the Sun. This is the rough distance we should expect to find good Jupiters elsewhere. Jupiter's \"caretaker\" role was dramatically illustrated in 1994 when Comet Shoemaker–Levy 9 impacted the giant.\n\nHowever, the evidence is not quite so clear. Research has shown that Jupiter's role in determining the rate at which objects hit Earth is significantly more complicated than once thought.\n\nThe role of Jupiter in the early history of the Solar System is somewhat better established, and the source of significantly less debate. Early in the Solar System's history, Jupiter is accepted as having played an important role in the hydration of our planet: it increased the eccentricity of asteroid belt orbits and enabled many to cross Earth's orbit and supply the planet with important volatiles such as water and carbon dioxide. Before Earth reached half its present mass, icy bodies from the Jupiter–Saturn region and small bodies from the primordial asteroid belt supplied water to the Earth due to the gravitational scattering of Jupiter and, to a lesser extent, Saturn. Thus, while the gas giants are now helpful protectors, they were once suppliers of critical habitability material.\n\nIn contrast, Jupiter-sized bodies that orbit too close to the habitable zone but not in it (as in 47 Ursae Majoris), or have a highly elliptical orbit that crosses the habitable zone (like 16 Cygni B) make it very difficult for an independent Earth-like planet to exist in the system. See the discussion of a stable habitable zone above. However, during the process of migrating into a habitable zone, a Jupiter-size planet may capture a terrestrial planet as a moon. Even if such a planet is initially loosely bound and following a strongly inclined orbit, gravitational interactions with the star can stabilize the new moon into a close, circular orbit that is coplanar with the planet's orbit around the star.\n\nA supplement to the factors that support life's emergence is the notion that life itself, once formed, becomes a habitability factor in its own right. An important Earth example was the production of molecular oxygen gas () by ancient cyanobacteria, and eventually photosynthesizing plants, leading to a radical change in the composition of Earth's atmosphere. This environmental change is called the Great Oxygenation Event. This oxygen proved fundamental to the respiration of later animal species. The Gaia hypothesis, a scientific model of the geo-biosphere pioneered by James Lovelock in 1975, argues that life as a whole fosters and maintains suitable conditions for itself by helping to create a planetary environment suitable for its continuity. Similarly, David Grinspoon has suggested a \"living worlds hypothesis\" in which our understanding of what constitutes habitability cannot be separated from life already extant on a planet. Planets that are geologically and meteorologically alive are much more likely to be biologically alive as well and \"a planet and its life will co-evolve.\" This is the basis of Earth system science.\n\n\n"}

He was regarded as being on the radical wing of the party and was popular with working-class electors. Defeated by Sir John Llewelyn in 1895 he was rejected as a candidate for the constituency in 1900 due to his opposition to the South African War.\n\nBurnie was born in 1842 at Dawlish in South Devon where his father, John Dickson Burnie, was a builder and contractor. The family came originally from Dumfriesshire. As a young man, Burnie worked in the railway trade and came to Swansea in 1870 when Shacklefgord, Ford & Co., the works at Cheltenham, where he was general manager, were re-located. He became general manager of the firm in 1876.\n\nBurnie was elected to the Sweansea Town Council in 1877 and became active in the municipal life of the town, serving as Mayor and Chairman of the Harbour Trust. In 1889, however, the year Swansea became a County Borough, he chose to stand down.\n\nBy the 1890s, Burnie was building a political reputation beyond his adopted town. In 1890 he was nominated to be Liberal candidate for the vacancy in East Carmarthenshire following the death of David Pugh but he withdrew before the selection conference. He became treasurer of the Welsh Farmer's Defence Fund, which was formed in light of tithe agitation, and in early 1892 he made a tour through the counties of South Wales where protests had taken place. He came close to winning the Liberal nomination at Chelsea and also at Mid Glamorgan where he was narrowly defeated in 1890 by Samuel Thomas Evans largely. it was stated, due to Evans being a Welsh-speaking Welshman.\n\nThe death of the siting member of Swansea Town, Lewis Llewelyn Dillwyn, shortly before the 1892 General Election led to Burnie being selected as candidate.\n\nBurnie launched his campaign at a public meeting at the Albert Hall, Swansea, where Sir Hussey Vivian presided and endorsed Burnie's campaign in a speech resonating with references to his own father's time as MP for Swansea. Vivian's intervention may have been calculated to counter the impact of the Conservatives' decision to adopt Sir John Llewelyn, a very popular figure locally and nephew of the late member, Lewis Llewelyn Dillwyn.\n\nHaving been defeated in 1895, Burnie was again adopted as candidate in 1900. However, he withdrew over his opposition to the South African War.\n"}

It was registered in 1945 in India by Shri Ram Chandraji of Shahjahanpur, Uttar Pradesh, India. It has its current world headquarters at Manapakkam, Chennai, Tamil Nadu.\n\nThe stated purpose of the Shri Ram Chandra Mission is to \"awaken the divine consciousness and provide support on the path of human evolution\". According to the movement, the form of Raja Yoga practiced, starts at step number 7 of Patanjali's Raja Yoga. It is based on simple and natural means suited to current living conditions and does not involve mechanical methods involving austerity and penance. It is universal, easily practicable and one can quickly get to find oneself from the inside out. The Sahaj Marg system uses the cleansing of the past impressions (also called samskaras), meditation on the heart and the support of a living spiritual master. The role of the spiritual teacher is said to be essential as he is well aware of all issues and all matters of spirituality and has walked the path of realization or enlightenment of the soul, being a Master of the path. He knows what to do for the traveler. He is regarded by the practitioners as a living example, a teacher by his writings and by his words, deeds and being. \"It is God who is the true Guru and Master and from God alone we receive the light\", wrote Shri Ram Chandraji in his book \"Reality at Dawn\".\n\nSRCM offers its services of Sahaj Marg system of meditation to all seekers without any bias of religion, nationality, color, race, gender, caste or class. There are no fees charged by SRCM at any stage of spiritual practice.\n\nThe current president of Shri Ram Chandra Mission and spiritual Master of the Sahaj Marg system is Shri Kamlesh Patel (b. 1956). This includes SRCM USA, which was registered in California in 1997 (SRCM California-1997) and SRCM India, which was registered in Lucknow, India in the year 1945 (SRCM-Shahjahanpur-1945). SRCM was named after the Adi Guru Shri Ram Chandraji of Fatehgarh (aka ‘Lalaji’) and was founded by his successor Shri Ram Chandra of Shahjahanpur, affectionately known as Babuji (1899 - 1983). He was succeeded as president and spiritual Master of SRCM by Shri Parthasarathi Rajagopalachari, affectionately known as Chariji (1927 - 2014). Following the death of Chariji on 20 December 2014, Shri Kamlesh Patel has become the third president of SRCM and the fourth spiritual Master of the Sahaj Marg system.\n\nBabuji was taught by Shri Ram Chandra of Fatehgarh (aka ‘Lalaji’), the Adi Guru of the Sahaj Marg system. Although Babuji met Lalaji merely a few times physically, Babuji eventually became his spiritual successor. Lalalji rediscovered the ancient yogic method of spiritual training based on yogic transmission of divine energy called Pranahuti.\n\nThe Shri Ram Chandra Mission is now present in over 120 countries on all continents. Books published by SRCM have been translated to over twenty languages and read widely across the world. The Spiritual Hierarchy Publication Trust (SHPT) was registered on 8 April 2009, with its headquarters at Kolkata, India. The SHPT undertakes all publication activities under license from the Shri Ram Chandra Mission (SRCM) and the Sahaj Marg Spirituality Foundation(SMSF).\n\nThe Shri Ram Chandra Mission, registered in India in the year 1945 and having its world headquarters in Chennai, India, is an NGO recognized by the United Nations Department of Public Information (UNDPI) as a \"non-profit organization\" in Denmark, the United States and India.\n\nSRCM in collaboration with the United Nations Information Centre for India and Bhutan hosts the 'All India Essay Writing Event', an annual essay writing event for school and college students across India, where prizes are awarded for national and state level winners. In 2014, a total of 1,85,751 students from 11,857 schools and colleges across the India took part in this annual contest. \nIn 2017, the event was hosted with participants writing essays in English, Hindi, Bengali, Gujarati, Kannada, Marathi, Malayalam, Oriya, Punjabi, Tamil and Telugu.\n\nShri Ram Chandra Mission, Kanha Shantivanam, was awarded the `Haritha Mitra' (Green Friend) Award by the Telangana government in 2016, in recognition of exemplary contribution to the greening movement undertaken by the Government of Telangana by Deputy Chief Minister Mahmood Ali of Telangana State, India.\n\nIn December 2017, Ram Nath Kovind, the President of India, E.S.L. Narasimhan, Governor of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana visited SRCM's Kanha Shantivanam Ashram and planted 100,000th tree with Kamlesh Patel under the Green Kanha initiative.\n\nSRCM's Kanha Shantivanam, a sprawling 700-acre ashram, when completed in a year's time will house a world-class archive, cultural center, a library and a museum all dedicated to narrating the history and current relevance of Yoga. The meditation hall will be able to house close to 50,000 people.\nKanha Shantivanam is also an ex-situ conservation centre, where rare and threatened plant species are being collected from across India. More than 300 mature trees earmarked for felling because of different road works have been transplanted in Kanha Shantivanam.

Mills Goodloe and Salvador Paskowitz. The film stars Blake Lively in the title role, with Michiel Huisman, Kathy Baker, Amanda Crew, Harrison Ford, and Ellen Burstyn in supporting roles. Narrated by Hugh Ross, the story follows Adaline Bowman, a young woman who stops aging after an accident at the age of 29.\n\nThe film was co-produced by Sidney Kimmel Entertainment and Lakeshore Entertainment. In October 2013, Lively was cast as the title character, with Krieger attached to direct. Principal photography took place in Vancouver from March 5, 2014 to May 5.\n\n\"The Age of Adaline\" premiered in New York City on April 19, 2015 was theatrically released on April 24 in the United States by Lionsgate. The film received mixed reviews from critics, with many praising the performances of Lively and Ford respectively and was frequently cited as some of their best work in recent years. It was a modest box-office success, grossing $65.7 million worldwide on a $25 million budget. The film received two nominations at the 42nd Saturn Awards, one for Best Fantasy Film and one for Lively for Best Actress.\n\nOne afternoon in San Francisco, Adaline Bowman purchases fake IDs at an apartment before returning home to feed her dog. She then goes to work and opens a box of film reels, which highlight historical events and times. A voiceover ties together the film reels explaining the story of Adaline's life so far. She was born on New Years Day 1908, then later married and gave birth to a daughter, only to become a widow after her husband died in a tragic accident. Years later, in 1937, Adaline crashed her car when she swerved into a ravine during a snowstorm and died in the freezing lake nearby, but a lightning strike suddenly revived her. From that moment on, Adaline has stayed physically 29 years old.\n\nOne night, two suspicious FBI agents attempt to force her onto an airplane for study, but she escapes captivity and realizes that she will have to spend the rest of her life on the run. Ever since, she has changed her identification and address according to the era, while her daughter Flemming ages normally, to the point where she appears older than Adaline.\n\nOn New Year's Eve in the present year, she attends a party where she meets Ellis Jones, introducing herself as her current alias, Jennifer. He asks to see her again but she refuses, knowing she can never fall in love because she can never have a normal future with someone. The next day at work, Ellis arrives and again asks Adaline to go on a date with him. Finally she accepts.\n\nIn a flashback, Adaline is shown pulling up in a cab to a park where a man is waiting, holding an engagement ring. Scared, she asks the cab driver to keep going. Back in the present day, Adaline's dog falls ill and she begins to ignore Ellis' calls. He shows up at her apartment but she pushes him away, only to have a change of heart while looking through some old photographs and realizing she doesn't want to live the same year a hundred times without having a natural life.\n\nThey later resolve their argument and Ellis asks Adaline to attend the party at his parents' house celebrating his parents' fortieth anniversary, and she says yes. Upon their arrival, Ellis introduces her to his father, William, who recognizes her instantly and calls her Adaline. She appears to recognize him, too, but lies, telling him that Adaline was her mother, who has since died. A flashback shows how they met and came to be in love, soon revealing that he was the man with the engagement ring she stood up that afternoon. One night, Ellis tells Adaline he is falling in love with her and she is unsure of how to react.\n\nThe following day, Adaline talks with William outside and he notices a scar on her left hand, and becomes shaken. Another flashback reveals that Adaline cut her hand while they were hiking decades ago and he had stitched it up himself. He realizes that she is truly Adaline and confronts her. She becomes upset, claiming she used to be \"normal\" and doesn't know what changed her. He begs her not to run, for Ellis' sake, but she says she doesn't know how to stay. She flees and returns to the house, writing a note to Ellis while he showers, then she packs her things and leaves. Moments later, Ellis finds the letter and confronts his father, who refuses to explain.\n\nWhile driving home, Adaline thinks of all the times she has run and suddenly has a change of heart about the way she lives her life. She stops and calls her daughter to tell her she is going to stop running. As she turns the car around, a tow truck plows into her in a hit-and-run accident, leaving her to die. Freezing and helpless, Adaline dies again. An ambulance arrives and she is revived by the electricity of the defibrillator. Later in the hospital, she wakes up to Ellis, and the two profess their love for one another. Adaline then tells him of her 107 years of life.\n\nOne year later, Ellis and Adaline are going to a New Year's Eve party. As she is leaving, she notices something strange in the hallway mirror: her first grey hair, proving she has begun to age naturally again. When Ellis asks if she is okay, she responds: \"Yes... Perfect.\"\n\n\nOn May 12, 2010 it was announced that \"The Age of Adaline\" would be co-financed and co-produced by Lakeshore Entertainment and Sidney Kimmel Entertainment. Salvador Paskowitz and J. Mills Goodloe wrote the script. Sierra / Affinity has the international rights, while producers were Steve Golin, Alix Madigan, Tom Rosenberg and Gary Lucchesi. On July 20, 2010 it was reported that Andy Tennant was set to direct the film. On October 31, 2010, Summit Entertainment bought the US distribution rights to the film, which was set to begin shooting in March 2011 for an early 2012 release.\n\nOn February 22, 2011, it was reported that Gabriele Muccino was in talks to direct the film, replacing Tennant, with the film re-titled from \"The Age of Adaline\" to simply \"Adaline\". On May 14, 2012, it was announced that Spanish director Isabel Coixet would direct the film instead. On October 16, 2013, Lee Toland Krieger was reported to be the actual director of the film. Producer Dan Cohen had shown him the script at a general meeting in 2009.\n\nOn May 12, 2010, Katherine Heigl was cast as the title character. On November 12, 2010, Angela Lansbury was added to the cast of the film, set to play the daughter of the ageless Adaline. On November 15, Heigl withdrew from \"Adaline\"'s cast, and there were rumors that she had been fired by Lakeshore, which both Lakeshore and Heigl denied. She later announced that her withdrawal was a result of her recent adoption of a daughter. On August 15, 2011, TheWrap reported that Natalie Portman had been offered the lead role. On August 25, Portman told \"Entertainment Weekly\" that she had declined the offer.\n\nOn October 16, 2013, Blake Lively and Ellen Burstyn were cast in the film to play the lead roles, with Lively starring as the title character. On January 15, 2014 Harrison Ford joined the cast, and the film was set to begin shooting in March of that year. On February 11, 2014 Michiel Huisman joined the cast to star opposite Lively as Adaline's love interest.\n\nFilming began on March 10, 2014 in Vancouver and continued through May 5. On March 11, 2014 filming at the Hotel Vancouver commenced. Anamorphic lenses and minimal use of steadicams were employed to provide greater authenticity for scenes set in the 1930s, 1940s, and 1950s. The films \"Gentlemen Prefer Blondes\" and \"How to Marry a Millionaire\" served as inspiration for the period color tone and saturation.\n\nWhile Rob Simonsen scored the film, Lana Del Rey contributed a song titled \"Life Is Beautiful\". The song is featured in the film's trailer but is not included in the soundtrack.\n\nOn August 15, 2014, Lionsgate set the film for a January 23, 2015 worldwide release. Later, the date was moved to April 24, 2015. The film was released on DVD on September 8, 2015.\n\nThe promotional campaign was aimed primarily at fashion-conscious women. Danielle DePalma, executive vice-president of digital marketing at Lionsgate, said, \"We were very aware of Blake’s high-fashion profile when we crafted the campaign, and there was so much beautiful imagery from the film.\" They created vignettes for MTV and VH1 and a fashion segment for E! News showing viewers how to achieve the same looks as Lively. They created a custom \"Fashion Journey Through the Decades\" initiative, through which a fashion influencer from YouTube or Maker Studios created a unique look inspired by the film. Video ads were also released on Instagram and tutorials on Pinterest. Advance screenings for fashion and lifestyle influencers took place in partnership with Gilt City. The application Periscope was used to spread information about the film.\n\n\"The Age of Adaline\" earned $42,629,776 in North America and $23,033,500 in other countries, for a worldwide box office gross of $65.7 million.

The film premiered at the BFI London Film Festival on 11 October 2014 and was released theatrically on 24 April 2015 in the UK. \"The Falling\" earned £468,762 on a £750,000 budget.\n\nIn 1969, Lydia and Abbie are best friends at an English girls school. Lydia, the neglected daughter of an agoraphobic mother, becomes fixated on Abbie, who has begun to explore her sexuality. After having sex with Lydia's brother Kenneth in an attempt to abort her pregnancy by another boy, Abbie begins to suffer from fainting spells. She suffers an episode after a stint in detention with Lydia and dies in the process. Following Abbie's burial, Lydia begins suffering as well from fainting spells, and it soon becomes an epidemic, with numerous girls and a young teacher in the school spontaneously passing out for no more than a few seconds. Lydia becomes convinced that the administration must take action, much to the chagrin of the school principal.\n\nWhen an assembly becomes disrupted by a mass fainting episode, the school is temporarily shut down and all affected students are hospitalized and psychoanalysed. When no cause for the spells is discovered, the school is reopened and Lydia is expelled. That same night, the virginal Lydia has sex with Kenneth, with whom she has developed an incestuous relationship after Abbie's death. However their mother Eileen catches them and, armed with a pair of scissors, angrily forces Kenneth out of the house before launching into an argument with her daughter, in which she brands Lydia dangerous and that she ought to be locked up. Eileen also reveals that Lydia and Kenneth are only half-siblings; Lydia being the product of a rape. \n\nUpon learning this, Lydia runs out of the house and Eileen follows her outside, despite having never ventured outside in over 16 years. Searching for Lydia, Eileen is overcome with flashbacks of her own sexual assault, and eventually locates Lydia; who has climbed to the top of a tree in a breakdown over Abbie's death. Eileen pleads with Lydia to come down, but she laughs, challenging her mother's lack of maternal affection, before losing her footing and leaping from the tree into a lake. \n\nDistraught, Eileen ventures into the water and cradles Lydia's seemingly drowned body, realizing that her emotional frigidity had done more harm to her daughter than she knew. Lydia regains consciousness, and the film ends with the two women in a crying embrace.\n\n\nBFI funded the film £750K. Production began in October 2013.\n\nThe soundtrack is by Tracey Thorn. Morley asked Thorn to provide the music for the film after editing had begun.\n\n\"The Falling\" premiered at the BFI London Film Festival on 11 October 2014. It had a limited release in the United Kingdom, grossing £442,177 with a further £10,051 grossed in New Zealand. US DVD sales amounted to another £6,406.\n\nRotten Tomatoes, a review aggregator, reports that 78% of 22 surveyed critics gave the film a positive review; the average rating is 7/10. Mark Adams of \"Screen International\" wrote, \"It is a film that will resonate with some but leave others exasperated, but \"The Falling\" is certainly a bold film, and one to be admired and appreciated.\" Guy Lodge of \"Variety\" called it \"an imperfect but alluring study of psychological contagion that marks an auspicious advance in the field of narrative filmmaking for acclaimed documaker Carol Morley\". Leslie Felperin of \"The Hollywood Reporter\" called it \"a flawed but fascinating period study of female friendship and hysteria\". Trevor Johnston of \"Time Out London\" rated it 4/5 stars and wrote, \"Carol Morley shows startling versatility and ambition with this jawdropping mash-up of \"If\" and \"Picnic at Hanging Rock\"\". Mike McCahill of \"The Daily Telegraph\" rated it 4/5 stars and called it a continuation of the themes in Nicolas Roeg's \"Performance\" and \"Don't Look Now\".\n\nGeoffrey Macnab of \"The Independent\" rated it 4/5 stars and wrote, \"Carol Morley's \"The Falling\" is beguiling and disturbing, a beautifully made and very subtle affair that combines melodrama, rites of passage and supernatural elements in an utterly intriguing way.\" Peter Bradshaw of \"The Guardian\" rated it 5/5 stars and wrote, \"Director Carol Morley has come up with another brilliant and very distinctive feature, about an epidemic of fainting that grips a girls school in the 1960s.\" Elise Nakhnikian of \"Slant Magazine\" gave a less favourable review, writing that \"the film all leads to a melodramatic climax that wraps up the main character's explosive acting out in a too-neat package.\" David Jenkins of \"Little White Lies\" also gave an unfavourable review, writing, \"Carol Morley follows up the mesmerising Dreams of a Life with a tedious period drama set in an all-girls school.\"\n\n"}

The concern with cord prolapse is that pressure on the cord from the baby will compromising blood flow to the baby.\nThe greatest risk factor is having had more than two previous children with the current baby in an abnormally positioned within the uterus. Other risks include a premature or small baby, twin pregnancy, and too much amniotic fluid. Whether medical rupture of the amniotic sac is a risk is controversial. The diagnosis should be suspected if there is a sudden decrease in the babies heart rate during labor. Seeing or feeling the cord confirms the diagnosis.\nManagement focuses on quick delivery, usually by cesarean section. Filling the bladder or pushing up the baby by hand is recommended until this can take place. The knee-chest position, or if this is not possible Trendelenburg position may be used. With appropriate management, the majority of cases have good outcomes.\nUmbilical cord prolapse occurs in about 1 in 500 pregnancies. The risk of death of the baby is about 10%. Much of this risk is due to congenital anomalies or prematurity, however. It is considered an emergency.\n\nThe first sign of umbilical cord prolapse is usually a sudden decrease in fetal heart rate that is severe and does not immediately resolve. On a fetal heart tracing, this would usually look like moderate to severe variable decelerations. Occasionally, the cord can be seen or felt on vaginal examination, particularly with overt cord prolapse.\n\nRisk factors that are associated with umbilical cord prolapse tend to make it difficult for the fetus from appropriately engaging and filling the maternal pelvis or are related to abnormalities of the umbilical cord. The two major categories of risk factors are spontaneous and iatrogenic, or those that result from medical intervention.\n\nUmbilical cord prolapse should always be considered a possibility when there is a sudden decrease in fetal heart rate or variable decelerations, particularly after the rupture of membranes. With overt prolapses, the diagnosis can be confirmed if the cord can be palpated on vaginal examination. Without overt prolapse, the diagnosis can only be confirmed after a cesarean section, though even then it will not always be evident at time of procedure.\n\nThere are three types of umbilical prolapse that can occur:\n\nThe gold standard for treatment of umbilical cord prolapse in the setting of a viable pregnancy typically involves immediate delivery by the quickest and safest route possible. This usually requires cesarean section, especially if the woman is in early labor. Occasionally, vaginal delivery will be attempted if clinical judgment determines that is a safer or quicker method.\n\nOther interventions during management of cord prolapse are typically used to decrease the chance of complications while preparations for delivery are being made. These interventions are focused on reducing pressure on the cord to prevent fetal complications from cord compression. The following maneuvers are among those used in clinical practice:\n\nIf the mother is far from delivery, funic reduction (manually placing the cord back into the uterine cavity) has been attempted, with successful cases reported.\n\nThe primary concern with umbilical cord prolapse is inadequate blood supply, and thus oxygen, to the fetus if the cord becomes compressed. The cord can become compressed either due to mechanical pressure (usually from the presenting fetal part) or from sudden contraction of the vessels due to decreased temperatures in the vagina in comparison to the uterus. This can lead to death of the fetus or other complications.\n\nHistorically, the rate of fetal death in the setting of cord prolapse has been as high 40%. However, these estimates occurred in the context of home or births outside of the hospital. When considering cord prolapses that have occurred in inpatient labor and delivery settings, the rate drops to as low as 0-3%, though the mortality rate remains higher than for fetuses without cord prolapse. The reduction in mortality for hospital births is likely due to the ready availability of immediate cesarean section.\n\nMany other fetal outcomes have been studied, including Apgar score (a quick assessment of a newborn's health status) at 5 minutes and length of hospitalization after delivery. While both measures are worse for newborns delivered after cord prolapse, it is unclear what effect this has in the long-term. Relatively large studies that have tried to quantify long-term effects of cord prolapse on children found that less than 1% (1 in 120 studied) suffered a major neurologic handicap, and less than 1% (110 in 16,675) had diagnosed cerebral palsy.\n\nRates of umbilical cord prolapse ranges from 0.1-0.6% of all pregnancies. This rate has remained stable over time. A recent study estimates 77% of cord prolapses occur in singleton pregnancies, or those where there is only one fetus. In twin pregnancies, cord prolapses occur more frequently in the second twin to be delivered, with 9% in the first twin and 14% in the second twin.\n"}

In conflict resolution, a win–win strategy is a collaborative strategy and conflict resolution process that aims to accommodate all participants. In economics, it is a voluntary transaction where both parties gain wealth, as in the double thank-you of capitalism.\n\n\nGroup-dynamics win–win games have been increasingly popular since the end of the Vietnam war and have been successfully applied to all levels of society.\n\nGroup-dynamics win–win games emphasize the importance of cooperation, fun, sharing, caring and overall group success in contrast to domination, egoistic behavior and personal gain. All players are treated as equally important and valuable. Win–win games often also carry an ethical message of caring for the environment and a holistic approach to life and society. Win–win games are a powerful tool to give people self-confidence and a \"we\" experience, especially when they have suffered from emotional isolation.\n\nAn example would be a game where all players try to carry a huge \"earth ball\" (a ball several meters in diameter) over their heads while negotiating an obstacle course. This is a typical example of a win–win game for several reasons:\n\nThere are also mathematical win–win games, the mathematical term being non-zero-sum games. Such games are often simply represented by a matrix of payouts.\n\n"}
