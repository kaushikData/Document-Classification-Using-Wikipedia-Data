In July, 1833, he was appointed rabbi of Hohenems, Vorarlberg, where he remained for eleven years. Besides organizing various charitable societies, he greatly improved the educational facilities for the young, and introduced many reforms into the public service. In May, 1844, he accepted the rabbinate of Lemberg. Here in a comparatively short time he opened a well-equipped \"Normalschule\" of which he was the superintendent, dedicated a new reform temple, abolished many old abuses, and did not rest until the degrading tax on kosher meat and Sabbath candles, imposed upon the Jewish community by the government, was removed.\n\nIn 1902 the Lviv/Lemberg Jewish community commissioned a portrait of Abraham Kohn. The posthumous portrait was painted by a Lviv-based Jewish painter Wilhelm Wachtel (1875-1952). Presently this portrait is in the collection of the Voznytsky Lviv National Gallery in Lviv, Ukraine. \n\nWhile the less traditional element rallied about him, the traditionalists of the community bitterly protested changes to their religion. On September 6, 1848, Abraham Ber Pilpel, said to be hired by a fanatical clique, entered Kohn's kitchen and poisoned the family's dinner with arsenic. While the other members of his family recovered, Kohn and his youngest daughter (cf. \"Reformed Judaism and its Pioneers\" by E. Schreiber, where he writes that the only victim of the murder was Rabbi Kohn himself and the rest of the family recovered), died the following day. After Kohn died Pilpel stood trial for his murder and was convicted. However, on appeal this was overturned. After the verdict was overturned, it was again reviewed by the highest court and the appellate court's judgment was upheld.\n\n"}

An official at court during the late reign of the Kangxi Emperor, Alingga played a major role in the succession struggle between the sons of the emperor. Born into a prominent imperial family as the son of Ebilun, Alingga's sister was one of the Kangxi Emperor's highly ranked consorts, and his daughter married Yunli, the Prince Guo.\n\nAlingga's birthdate is unknown. He was the seventh son of Ebilun, one of the main advisors to the Kangxi Emperor in the latter's early reign, Alingga grew up in a prominent household. He initially was an imperial bodyguard, then \"niru\" (佐領). Alingga became a top officer of the emperor's personal protection unit and the Manchu head of the Bordered Yellow Banner military force. His elder sister was the Wenxi Guifei (溫僖貴妃), a highly ranked imperial consort of the Kangxi Emperor. After the \"Guifei\" died, Alingga represented his family in mourning her.\n\nAlingga did not get along with his older brother Faka (法喀) and frequently attempted to cast sorcery spells against him. Alingga had inherited the first-class duke title originally bestowed upon Faka after the death of their father. Faka complained about Alingga's behavior to the emperor. The emperor, incensed at Alingga, dismissed him from his posts but retained his noble title. He was later restored as a first-class bodyguard and a leader of the Plain Blue Banner Mongol forces. He later was named an officer of the imperial guard, and minister responsible for \"Lifan Yuan\". In 1708, the 47th year of Kangxi's reign, Alingga became one of the most vocal supporters of Yunsi for the position of crown prince, and was criticized by the emperor, as Yunsi was not in imperial favor. Alingga died in 1716, the 55th year of Kangxi's reign. His daughter became wife to Yunli, the Prince Guo. He was also father of Arsungga, a major official during the reign of the Yongzheng Emperor.\n\nThe Yongzheng Emperor reserved particular scorn for Alingga, possibly as a result of the latter's endorsement of Yunsi during the battle for succession. In 1736, the Yongzheng Emperor said to his assembled officials, \"in today's court, the most treacherous, most selfishly bent on seeking their own gain; the worst of them are Alingga and Kuiju\". The emperor accused Alingga of spreading rumors in order to support the cause of Yunsi assuming the position of crown prince. Additionally, the emperor placed on Alingga's tombstone the remarks \"he was not a good subject, not a good younger brother, violent, and mediocre.\"\n\nAlingga appeared as a character in numerous Chinese television series, including \"Yongzheng Dynasty\", \"Scarlet Heart\", and \"Palace II\". Contemporary understandings of Alingga are basically derived from two sources - the \"Draft History of Qing\", which features a short biography of him, and various edicts issued by the Yongzheng Emperor, who despised him. It is therefore difficult to ascertain what kind of life he truly led or his personal character, as the Yongzheng Emperor's opinions is likely due to Alingga's allegiance to the emperor's political rivals.\n\n"}
{"id": "7265090", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7265090", "title": "Amor fati", "text": "Amor fati\n\nAmor fati ( \"love of fate\") is a Latin phrase that may be translated as \"love of fate\" or \"love of one's fate\". It is used to describe an attitude in which one sees everything that happens in one's life, including suffering and loss, as good or, at the very least, necessary, in that they are among the facts of one's life and existence, so they are always necessarily there whether one likes them or not. Moreover, \"amor fati\" is characterized by an acceptance of the events or situations that occur in one's life.\n\nThis acceptance does not necessarily preclude an attempt at change or improvement, but rather, it can be seen to be along the lines of what Friedrich Nietzsche apparently means by the concept of \"eternal recurrence\": a sense of contentment with one's life and an acceptance of it, such that one could live exactly the same life, in all its minute details, over and over for all eternity.\n\nThe concept of \"amor fati\" has been linked to Epictetus. It has also been linked to the writings of Marcus Aurelius, who did not himself use the words (he wrote in Greek, not Latin).\n\nThe phrase is used in a few of Nietzsche's writings and is representative of the general outlook on life that he articulates in section 276 of \"The Gay Science\":\n\nI want to learn more and more to see as beautiful what is necessary in things; then I shall be one of those who makes things beautiful. \"Amor fati\": let that be my love henceforth! I do not want to wage war against what is ugly. I do not want to accuse; I do not even want to accuse those who accuse. \"Looking away\" shall be my only negation. And all in all and on the whole: some day I wish to be only a Yes-sayer.\nIt is important to note that Nietzsche in this context refers to the \"Yes-sayer\", not in a political or social sense, but as a person who is capable of uncompromising acceptance of reality \"per se\".\n\nQuotation from \"Why I Am So Clever\" in \"Ecce Homo\", section 10:\n\nMy formula for greatness in a human being is \"amor fati\": that one wants nothing to be different, not forward, not backward, not in all eternity. Not merely bear what is necessary, still less conceal it—all idealism is mendacity in the face of what is necessary—but \"love\" it.Furthermore, Nietzsche's spirit of acceptance occurs in the context of his radical embrace of suffering. For to love that which is necessary, demands not only that we love the bad along with the good, but that we view the two as inextricably linked. In section 3 of the preface of \"The Gay Science\", he writes:Only great pain is the ultimate liberator of the spirit….I doubt that such pain makes us ‘better’; but I know that it makes us more profound. \n"}
{"id": "1737", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1737", "title": "Anaxagoras", "text": "Anaxagoras\n\nAnaxagoras (; , \"Anaxagoras\", \"lord of the assembly\";  BC) was a Pre-Socratic Greek philosopher. Born in Clazomenae at a time when Asia Minor was under the control of the Persian Empire, Anaxagoras came to Athens. According to Diogenes Laertius and Plutarch, in later life he was charged with impiety and went into exile in Lampsacus; the charges may have been political, owing to his association with Pericles, if they were not fabricated by later ancient biographers.\n\nResponding to the claims of Parmenides on the impossibility of change, Anaxagoras described the world as a mixture of primary imperishable ingredients, where material variation was never caused by an absolute presence of a particular ingredient, but rather by its relative preponderance over the other ingredients; in his words, \"each one is... most manifestly those things of which there are the most in it\". He introduced the concept of \"Nous\" (Cosmic Mind) as an ordering force, which moved and separated out the original mixture, which was homogeneous, or nearly so.\n\nHe also gave a number of novel scientific accounts of natural phenomena. He produced a correct explanation for eclipses and described the sun as a fiery mass larger than the Peloponnese, as well as attempting to explain rainbows and meteors.\n\nAnaxagoras is believed to have enjoyed some wealth and political influence in his native town of Clazomenae. However, he supposedly surrendered this out of a fear that they would hinder his search for knowledge. The Roman author Valerius Maximus preserves a different tradition: Anaxagoras, coming home from a long voyage, found his property in ruin, and said: \"If this had not perished, I would have\"—a sentence described by Valerius as being \"possessed of sought-after wisdom!\"\n\nAnaxagoras was a Greek citizen of the Persian Empire and had served in the Persian army; he may have been a member of the Persian regiments that entered mainland Greece during the Greco-Persian Wars. Though this remains uncertain, \"it would certainly explain why he came to Athens in the year of Salamis, 480/79 B.C.\" Anaxagoras is said to have remained in Athens for thirty years. Pericles learned to love and admire him, and the poet Euripides derived from him an enthusiasm for science and humanity. \n\nAnaxagoras brought philosophy and the spirit of scientific inquiry from Ionia to Athens. His observations of the celestial bodies and the fall of meteorites led him to form new theories of the universal order, and to a putative prediction of the impact of a meteorite in 467. He attempted to give a scientific account of eclipses, meteors, rainbows, and the sun, which he described as a mass of blazing metal, larger than the Peloponnese. The heavenly bodies, he asserted, were masses of stone torn from the earth and ignited by rapid rotation. He was the first to give a correct explanation of eclipses, and was both famous and notorious for his scientific theories, including the claims that the sun is a mass of red-hot metal, that the moon is earthy, and that the stars are fiery stones. He thought the earth was flat and floated supported by 'strong' air under it and disturbances in this air sometimes caused earthquakes. These speculations made him vulnerable in Athens to a charge of impiety. Diogenes Laertius reports the story that he was prosecuted by Cleon for impiety, but Plutarch says that Pericles sent his former tutor, Anaxagoras, to Lampsacus for his own safety after the Athenians began to blame him for the Peloponnesian war.\n\nAccording to Laertius, Pericles spoke in defense of Anaxagoras at his trial, . Even so, Anaxagoras was forced to retire from Athens to Lampsacus in Troad (433). He died there in around the year 428. Citizens of Lampsacus erected an altar to Mind and Truth in his memory, and observed the anniversary of his death for many years.\n\nAnaxagoras wrote a book of philosophy, but only fragments of the first part of this have survived, through preservation in work of Simplicius of Cilicia in the 6th century AD.\n\nAccording to Anaxagoras all things have existed in some way from the beginning, but originally they existed in infinitesimally small fragments of themselves, endless in number and inextricably combined throughout the universe. All things existed in this mass, but in a confused and indistinguishable form. There was an infinite number of homogeneous parts () as well as heterogeneous ones.\n\nThe work of arrangement, the segregation of like from unlike and the summation of the whole into totals of the same name, was the work of Mind or Reason (). Mind is no less unlimited than the chaotic mass, but it stood pure and independent, a thing of finer texture, alike in all its manifestations and everywhere the same. This subtle agent, possessed of all knowledge and power, is especially seen ruling in all the forms of life. Its first appearance, and the only manifestation of it which Anaxagoras describes, is Motion. It gave distinctness and reality to the aggregates of like parts.\n\nDecease and growth represent a new aggregation () and disruption (). However, the original intermixture of things is never wholly overcome. Each thing contains in itself parts of other things or heterogeneous elements, and is what it is, only on account of the preponderance of certain homogeneous parts which constitute its character. Out of this process arise the things we see in this world.\n\nAnaxagoras is mentioned by Socrates during his trial in Plato's \"Apology\". In the Phaedo, Plato portrays Socrates saying of Anaxagoras that as a young man: 'I eagerly acquired his books and read them as quickly as I could' .\n\nIn a quote chosen to begin Nathanael West's first book \"The Dream Life of Balso Snell\", Marcel Proust's character Bergotte says, \"After all, my dear fellow, life, Anaxagoras has said, is a journey.\"\n\nAnaxagoras appears as a character in \"Faust, Part II\" by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe.\n\nAnaxagoras appears as a character in \"The Ionia Sanction\", by Gary Corby.\n\nAnaxagoras is referred to and admired by Cyrus Spitama, the hero and narrator of \"Creation\", by Gore Vidal. The book contains this passage, explaining how Anaxagoras became influential:\n\nWilliam H. Gass begins his novel, \"The Tunnel\" (1995), with a quote from Anaxagoras: \"The descent to hell is the same from every place.\"\n\nHe is also mentioned in Seneca's Natural Questions (Book 4B, originally Book 3: On Clouds, Hail, Snow) It reads: \"Why should I too allow myself the same liberty as Anaxagoras allowed himself?\"\n\nDante Alighieri places Anaxagoras in the First Circle of Hell (Limbo) in his \"Divine Comedy\" (\"Inferno\", Canto IV, line 118).\n\n\n\n\n"}

Since the cuticle of these animals is also the skeletal support of the body and is inelastic, it is shed during growth and a new covering of larger dimensions is formed. During this process, an arthropod becomes dormant for a period of time. Enzymes are secreted to digest the inner layers of the existing cuticle, detaching the animal from the outer cuticle. This allows the new cuticle to develop without being exposed to the environmental elements. \n\nAfter apolysis, ecdysis occurs. Ecdysis is the actual emergence of the arthropod into the environment and always occurs directly after apolysis. The newly emerged animal then hardens and continues its life.\n"}

It can be used to train Elman networks. The algorithm was independently derived by numerous researchers\n\nThe training data for a recurrent neural network is an ordered sequence of formula_1 input-output pairs, formula_2. An initial value must be specified for the hidden state formula_3. Typically, a vector of all zeros is used for this purpose.\n\nBPTT begins by unfolding a recurrent neural network in time. The unfolded network contains formula_1 inputs and outputs, but every copy of the network shares the same parameters. Then the backpropagation algorithm is used to find the gradient of the cost with respect to all the network parameters.\n\nConsider an example of a neural network that contains a recurrent layer formula_5 and a feedforward layer formula_6. There are different ways to define the training cost, but the total cost is always the average of the costs of each of the time steps. The cost of each time step can be computed separately. The figure above shows how the cost at time formula_7 can be computed, by unfolding the recurrent layer formula_5 for three time steps and adding the feedforward layer formula_6. Each instance of formula_5 in the unfolded network shares the same parameters. Thus the weight updates in each instance (formula_11) are summed together.\n\nPseudo-code for a truncated version of BPTT, where the training data contains formula_12 input-output pairs, but the network is unfolded for formula_1 time steps:\n\nBPTT tends to be significantly faster for training recurrent neural networks than general-purpose optimization techniques such as evolutionary optimization.\n\nBPTT has difficulty with local optima. With recurrent neural networks, local optima are a much more significant problem than with feed-forward neural networks. The recurrent feedback in such networks tends to create chaotic responses in the error surface which cause local optima to occur frequently, and in poor locations on the error surface.\n\n"}
{"id": "1227183", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1227183", "title": "Badge Man", "text": "Badge Man\n\nBadge Man is a name given to an unknown figure that is reputedly visible within the famous Mary Moorman photograph of the assassination of U.S. President John F. Kennedy. Some researchers have theorized that this figure is a sniper firing a weapon at the President from the grassy knoll in Dealey Plaza. Even though an alleged muzzle flash obscures much of the detail, the \"Badge Man\" has been described as a person wearing some kind of police uniform – the moniker itself derives from a bright spot on the chest, which is said to resemble a gleaming badge.\n\nSpeculation about the \"Badge Man\" figure helped create conspiracy theories regarding a plot made by members of the Dallas Police Department to kill President Kennedy. In response, abundant skeptics proposed numerous alternative interpretations of the image.\n\nDuring the Presidential motorcade through Dealey Plaza, Dallas resident Mary Moorman took a series of photographs with her Polaroid camera. Her nonprofessional photos captured images of all of the presidential limousine occupants, several other close witnesses (including Abraham Zapruder filming), two Dallas police motorcycle Presidential escorts, and much of the Plaza's grassy knoll. The \"Badge Man\" is reputedly visible in Moorman's fifth and most famous photo of the area, taken at the moment of the head shot that killed the President. This photo has been calculated to have been captured between Zapruder film frames 315 and 316, which was less than one-sixth of a second after President Kennedy was fatally shot in the head at frame 313.\n\nIn 1982, Gary Mack, the longtime curator and archivist for The Sixth Floor Museum at Dealey Plaza (the former Texas School Book Depository), was the first person to claim discovery of the \"Badge Man\" figure. In Mack's visual interpretation, a uniformed police officer can be seen standing behind the stockade fence, with his face obscured by a muzzle flash, but a small bright object is visible on his chest.\n\nThe question of the \"Badge Man\" figure's existence helped perpetuate conspiracy theories that have alleged that members of the Dallas Police Department had killed Kennedy and simultaneously framed Lee Harvey Oswald.\n\nIn his initial observations, Mack was assisted by photographer and assassination researcher Jack White, who continued his experimentation with the Moorman photograph. In the mid-1980s, White put forward a new version, enhanced in contrast and brightness, which he claimed revealed the policeman figure in higher clarity.\n\nWhite's research was shown and discussed in the 1988 documentary series \"The Men Who Killed Kennedy\". In it, a closeup of the enhanced \"Badge Man\" figure is repeated onscreen as a voice-over describes three shooters at Dealey Plaza, which is said to be in league with the Mafia. One of the three is described as standing in the \"Badge Man\"'s position, behind the stockade fence on the grassy knoll. The narration identifies this shooter as Lucien Sarti, a French national and alleged contract killer.\n\nTo the anatomical right (photo left) of the supposed \"Badge Man\" figure, some researchers claim there is a second person seen, the self-proclaimed witness Gordon Arnold, who claimed in 1978 that he was filming the motorcade while wearing his U.S. Army uniform when a shot passed close to his left ear.\n\nThe Moorman photograph was seen contemporaneously in world media through UPI, but the Warren Commission did not include it in the volumes of its 1964 report. The House Select Committee on Assassinations (1976–1978) sent a high-quality negative version of the Moorman photo to the Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT) for enlargement, enhancement, and analysis. The RIT's report states that it found no evidence of human forms anywhere in the background, and the specific area behind the stockade fence was deemed to be so underexposed that it was impossible to glean any information from it.\n\nSome researchers have claimed that the \"Badge Man\" image is sunlight reflecting off a glass bottle and not a human figure. Some photos and films taken immediately after the assassination do, in fact, show a bottle sitting on top of the retaining wall. Researcher and computer animator Dale Myers believes the measurements of the Grassy Knoll area give proof that the alleged figure would have been in an impossible position to fire a weapon at the motorcade, saying \"if [the Badge Man were] truly a human being of average height and build, [he] was located 12–18 feet (3.7–5.5 m) behind the fence line and elevated 3–4 feet (0.91–1.2 m) above the ground.\"\n\n\n"}

It impacted a few miles from the present-day town of Chicxulub in Mexico, after which the impactor and its crater are named. Because the estimated date of the object's impact and the Cretaceous–Paleogene boundary (K–Pg boundary) coincide, there is a scientific consensus that its impact was the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event which caused the death of most of the planet's non-avian dinosaurs and many other species.\n\nThe impactor's crater is over in diameter making it the second largest known impact crater on Earth.\n\nThere are several competing models for the impactor's origin and its relationship to other asteroids that still exist in the Solar System. In September 2007, William F. Bottke, David Vokrouhlický, and David Nesvorný proposed an origin for the impactor in an article published in \"Nature\". This argued that a collision in the asteroid belt 160 million years ago resulted in the Baptistina family of asteroids, the largest surviving member of which is 298 Baptistina. They proposed that the Chicxulub impactor was an asteroid member of this group, referring to the large amount of carbonaceous material present in microscopic fragments at the site, suggesting that it was a member of a rare class of asteroids called carbonaceous chondrites, like Baptistina.

{"id": "55307463", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=55307463", "title": "Child bereavement", "text": "Child bereavement\n\nChild bereavement occurs when a child loses someone of importance in their life. There is substantial research regarding grief in adults, but there is less focus in literature about grief among children. Children will experience instances in their life that could involve losing a parent, sibling, or friend through suicide, unintentional injury, homicide, or natural causes. The levels of grief and bereavement differ among children, including uncomplicated and complicated bereavement. Unlike adults, children may experience and express their grief and bereavement through behaviors, and are less likely to outwardly express their emotions. The children who experience bereavement and grief can receive treatment involving group intervention, play therapy, and cognitive behavioral therapy. Different forms of treatment for children experiencing bereavement and or grief can help to reduce symptoms of anxiety, depression, social adjustment, and posttraumatic stress. Research has shown that it is important to be aware of the difficulties in predicting how losing a closed one can impact a child’s emotionality and how their coping abilities will differ across ages and cultures.\n\nAcross cultures the loss of a parent is consistently rated as one of the most difficult experiences that a child will endure. In western countries, 5% of children will experience the loss of a parent. Across the world the loss of a parent is seen as a significant life event for a child. However, the process of grieving can look different for each child based on their age, the quality of the relationship with the deceased parent, and the characteristics of the death.\n\nAn individual’s culture is an important factor that will influence the bereavement process. What one culture believes to be maladaptive another culture may view as healthy; there is no universally accepted view of the bereavement process \n\nThere are two categories of bereavement that children experience after the loss of a parent; complex bereavement and uncomplicated bereavement. Uncomplicated bereavement is the normal process that most children will experience. Children who experience uncomplicated bereavement and receive adequate parenting following the death of a parent appear to not be at risk of developing a mental health condition in the future. Complicated bereavement occurs when an individual fails to return to their pre-bereavement emotional and behavioral functioning \nThe precise definition and duration of the bereavement process has been a source of controversy over the decades. According to the DSM-V, Persistent Complex Bereavement Disorder, requires that the child loss someone that they had a close relationship with; and during a 6 month period the child must experience on more days than not one of the following symptoms, a yearning for the deceased individual, sorrow or emotional pain for the dead, preoccupation with the death, or preoccupation surrounding the circumstances around the death. Additionally, six more symptoms must be experienced on more days than not that are related to reactive distress to death or social/identity disruption.\n\nChildren can be vulnerable to life events following loss. The vulnerability is due to developmental immaturity and the lack of developed coping abilities. It is common to assume children will grieve in a similar fashion to adults, but their symptoms and duration of grief following loss appears differently. This may include children repeatedly asking questions about death for reassurance that nothing has changed and reenacting the death or funeral activities. Additionally, children’s emotions may be expressed differently than adults; adults may express their grief through sadness, but children may misbehave or have outbursts. Research emphasizes the importance of being cognizant of and not to expect children to display their emotions outwardly like adults, but rather that their behaviors could indicate their internal distress.\n\nA large portion of children may experience loss and bereavement at some point during their childhood. After these losses occur, there are a variety of types of treatment techniques that can be implemented, including Play Therapy, Group Therapy, and Cognitive Behavioral Therapy. Play therapy for loss during childhood uses activities like drawing or games that aid in having the children talk about their feelings. Another effective form of therapy is Group Therapy tailored for loss during childhood, where a group of peers, similar in age, share and talk about their feelings and the bereavement process with a facilitator leading the group. Lastly, Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for loss during childhood includes using cognitive techniques to assist the child in changing their behavior and using more effective coping techniques.\nThe different forms of treatment aiming to assist children in coping with loss and bereavement also help to reduce their symptoms of anxiety, depression, adjustment issues, and posttraumatic stress. By using empirically driven forms of therapy for children who have experienced loss, children can reduce their symptoms and will be less likely to drop out of treatment by focusing on the feelings and reaction they have to the death or suicide of someone close.\n"}

It became a tradition to decorate coffins of deceased nobles (\"szlachta\") with such funerary art in the times of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, particularly in the 17th and 18th centuries, the time of the baroque in Poland and Sarmatism. The tradition was limited to Commonwealth countries, although the term may also describe the Ancient Egyptian mummy portraits.\n\nThey were commonly painted on sheet metal (copper, tin or lead plates) and fixed on the narrow ends of the coffins at the side where the head of the deceased lay. On the opposite of the coffin there was usually an epitaph, and the sides held a coat of arms. The shape of the upper edges of the portraits was based on the shape of the coffin, and the lower edges were often used to turn the whole into a hexagon or octagon. After the funeral, the coffin portrait would often be hung on the walls of the church that the deceased had contributed to. In time, they increased in size – from 40 x 45 cm in the 17th century, to 70 x 72 cm in the 18th century.\n\nThe portraits were highly realistic, with the intent to create an impression that the deceased is taking part in their own funeral; that impression was reinforced often by the subject of the portrait gazing directly at the viewers. Some of them were painted during the life of the deceased.\n\nHistorian Bernard O'Connor in his memoirs of 1696 wrote: \"There is so much pomp and ceremony in Polish funerals that you would sooner take them to be a triumphant event than the burial of the dead\". Indeed, for Polish nobles (szlachta), a proper funeral was extremely important. Those who could afford it spent lavishly on the funeral ceremonies, turning them into major events. But even the poor would try to have at least a basic coffin portrait, albeit those, painted by amateur painters, usually have little or no artistic merit.\n\nUntil the 20th century, the coffin portraits were ignored by scholars; those painted on silver or tin were stolen from churches and monasteries and then melted down, others were destroyed by treasure hunters and thieves, or simply fell to the ravages of time. Today the surviving coffin portraits provide a wealth of knowledge about culture (clothing, hairstyles and jewellery) of the Commonwealth nobility. Many coffin portraits are still displayed in various churches across Poland; hundreds are held in various museums.\n\nThe oldest coffin portrait in Poland is that of the king Stefan Batory from the late 16th century. The most recent one is that of priest Marcin Porczyński from 1809.\n\n\n\n\n"}

It was abolished in 2013.\n\nThe office of Coroner of The King's or Queen's Household, reporting to the Lord Steward of the Household, dates back at least to the 13th century, and possibly even earlier, although not always given this exact name. As R.F. Hunnisett put it, \"Another privileged area was peripatetic. This was the verge, which extended for twelve miles around the king's court. It had its own coroner, called the coroner of the king's household, coroner of the Marshalsea, or coroner of the verge ...\"\n\nThere was a mention of the role in Law French by Bretton in 1290, \"Et en noster hostel soit un Corouner, qi face le mester de la Coroune par mi la verge\" (In our household let there be a Coroner to execute the business of the Crown throughout the verge) and a \"William of Walden, coroner of the king's household\" mentioned in 1333. A Robert of Hamond was described in 1480 as \"coroner of the kynges houshold\", and we also have it in legal Latin in 1593 as \"Coronatore hospicij dicte domine Regine\", which Leslie Hotson translated as \"Coroner of the household of our said lady the Queen\" in his book on the death of the playwright Christopher Marlowe, inquired into by the then Coroner of the Queen's Household, William Danby.\n\nAccording to Hunnisett, \"during the thirteenth century, no other coroner was allowed to act within the verge, with the result that many felonies were not presented to the justices in eyre after the king's court had moved on...\", and Richard Clarke Sewell tells us that \"Anciently the Coroner of the Verge had power to do all things within the Verge belonging to the office of the Coroner, to the exclusion of the Coroner of the County, but this clearly caused problems, which two acts were intended to solve.\"\n\nThese two acts were, first, in 1300 (28 \"Edward I\" c.3, s.2.) the \"Articuli super cartas\" (Articles upon the charters), which said \"...it is ordained, that from henceforth in cases of the death of men, whereof the Coroner's Office is to make view and Enquest, it shall be commanded to the Coroner of the County, that he, with the Coroner of the (King's) House, shall do as belongeth to his office and inroll it.\" Second, in 1311 (5 \"Edward II\" C.27.) there were the \"New ordinances\", which said \"... We do ordain, that from henceforth in case of homicide, whereof the Coroner's office is to make view and Inquest, it shall be commanded to the Coroner of the Country or of the Franchises where the dead persons shall be found, that he, together with the Coroner of the Household do execute the office which thereunto pertaineth, and shall enter it in his Roll...\"\n\nWellington described the result of the first statute thus: \"By this statute (the whole of which is repealed by Coroner's Act, 1887), the Coroner of the county had to join with the Coroner of the Verge; but, without the assistance of the latter officer, the Coroner of the county could not act within the Verge. So neither could the Coroner of the Verge act in such cases, unless he be associated with the Coroner of the county; and this had to appear upon the inquisition, or otherwise it would be erroneous and void.\" In other words, wherever an inquest needed to be held within the verge it was to be presided over by the two coroners jointly. \n\nThere was an exception to this, however, which was when an individual occupied both roles. Referring to a case in 1589, where one Richard Vale was both Coroner of the Queen's Household and one of the coroners for Middlesex, Sir Edward Coke reported that, despite Vale having presided alone where two coroners would have been expected, \"it was resolved that the indictment was well taken, for the intent and meaning of the act was performed, and the mischief recited in the act avoided as well when one person is coroner of the houshold \"(sic)\", and of the county also, as if there should be two several persons.\"\n\nOne other Act, in 1541/2, had also sought to clarify the relationship between the coroners of the county and the royal household. This was an \"Act for Murder and Malicious Bloodshed within the Court\" (33 \"Henry VIII\" C.12.), concerning deaths within the precincts of the Court itself. This stated \"that all inquisitions upon the view of persons slain or hereafter to be slain within any of the King's said Palaces or houses or other house or houses aforesaid, shall be by authority of this Act had and taken hereafter for ever by the Coroner for the time being of the household of our Sovereign Lord the King or his heirs without any adjoining or assisting of another Coroner of any Shire within this Realm\".\n\nIn 1756, \"The Coroner's Guide\" was saying that \"if a Murder be committed within the Verge, and the King removes before an Inquisition taken by The Coroner of the King's Household, the Coroner of the County and the Coroner of the King's House shall inquire of the same.\". This seems to imply that the joint responsibility applied only when the court moved between the time of the death and the inquest. And it does appear that the shared responsibility occurred less and less over the years. In an essay written in 1812, the anonymous author even felt able to write \"The duty of the coroner of the verge is, although I believe now wholly disregarded, in deaths happening within the verge, to sit, jointly with the coroner of the county to take the inquisitions ... I should apprehend, therefore, that all inquests as they are now, I believe, taken by the coroner of the county singly, when the question should be discussed, will be held to be bad.\"\n\nThe Coroners Act 1887, section 29, therefore removed this requirement—in fact doing away with the idea of the verge altogether—and leaving only those parts of the Henry VIII legislation mentioned above. Since then, their function was to investigate the death of anyone whose body was lying \"within the limits of any of the Queen's palaces; or within the limits of any other house where Her Majesty is then residing.\"\n\nIf the Coroner empanelled a jury to investigate the death, all members of the jury had to be chosen from among the members of the Royal Household. This led to some controversy concerning the independence of the jury in the 2006 second inquest into the death of Diana, Princess of Wales. Section 46 of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 abolished the office, effective 25 July 2013.\n\n\n\n"}

This occurred after ten months of negotiations in the context of preparations for the International Year for the Culture of Peace.\n\nUN resolution A/53/243.. called for the programme of action to include eight action areas:\n\nAs explained by UNESCO, \"each of these areas of action have been priorities of the United Nations since its foundation; what is new is their linkage through the culture of peace and non-violence into a single coherent concept. Linkages have often been made (for example, democracy, development and peace; equality between women and men with development and peace, and so forth). This is the first time, however, that all these areas are interlinked so that the sum of their complementarities and synergies can be developed.\"\n\nUnited Nations consideration of the culture of peace began in 1992 with the adoption by UNESCO of a Culture of Peace Programme. As the programme developed during the following decade, the United Nations General Assembly began requesting information from UNESCO about its progress. The General Assembly then declared the Year 2000 as the International Year for the Culture of Peace and requested UNESCO to submit a draft Declaration and Programme of Action on a Culture of Peace, which the General Assembly adopted on September 13, 1999. The General Assembly also declared the Decade 2001-2010 as the International Decade for a Culture of Peace and Non-Violence for the Children of the World.\n\nSince his retirement from UNESCO where he had promoted the culture of peace in his capacity as Director-General, Federico Mayor has coordinated the Fundacion Cultura de Paz. Since his retirement from UNESCO where he chaired the task force for the International Year for the Culture of Peace, David Adams has coordinated the Culture of Peace News Network which was established for the International Year for the Culture of Peace.\n\nAfter stating that \"the creation of the United Nations system itself, based upon universally shared values and goals, has been a major act towards transformation from a culture of war and violence to a culture of peace and non-violence\", the UN General Assembly, in its resolution 52/13 of 20 November 1997, requested UNESCO to submit to its next session a draft declaration and programme of action on a culture of peace. UNESCO supplied the requested document which was then taken under consideration by the General Assembly, beginning in December 1998. The document encountered resistance and the situation at first was not encouraging. One reason was the fact that the draft declaration referred to a \"human right to peace,\" a concept vigorously opposed by the Great Powers. \n\nThe programme of action also calls for a global movement for a culture of peace and the sharing of information among \"actors on their initiatives in this regard\".\n\nAddressing the General Assembly, Ambassador Anwarul Karim Chowdhury of Bangladesh, who had chaired the informal consultation process, called it a unique and universal document: \n\nI believe that this document is unique in more than one way. It is a universal document in the real sense, transcending boundaries, cultures, societies and nations. Unlike many other General Assembly documents, this document is action-oriented and encourages actions at all levels, be they at the level of the individual, the community, the nation or the region, or at the global and international levels.\n\nThe Manifesto was drafted for the International Year for the Culture of Peace by a group of Nobel Peace Prize winners in order to translate the resolutions of the United Nations into everyday language addressed to all people.\n\nThe Manifesto asked individuals to pledge \"in my daily life, in my family, my work, my community, my country and my region, to\":\n\n\nThe Manifesto was translated into more than 50 languages and personally signed by many\nHeads of State and Government. It was diffused throughout the world and individuals were invited to sign and commit themselves to practise its principles in everyday life. As a result, by the end of the International Year, it had been signed by over 74 million individuals, including by more than 1 million each from Brazil, Colombia, India, Japan, Kenya, Nepal and Republic of Korea.\n\nDetailed data entries for the 20 countries with more than 100,000 signatures are shown on the UNESCO website for the Year\n\nThe culture of peace resolution and the Manifesto 2000 campaign were the culmination of a decade-long Culture of Peace Programme at UNESCO. The Programme was adopted by the UNESCO Executive Board in the fall of 1992, in order to ″heal the social wounds of war by local activities of reconciliation and co-operation in countries where Security Council peace-keeping operations are already being implemented or may be anticipated because of developing violence.″\n\nThe first major test of the Culture of Peace Programme was in El Salvador using the methodology of \"cross-conflict participation\" by which the reconciliation of those who had been fighting against each other in the past was promoted by their joint participation in the planning and implementation of projects designed to benefit all concerned in fields such as education, culture, communication and science\n\nThe national culture of peace programmes did not receive the needed political and financial support from the UNESCO Member States, and were all discontinued.\n\nIn 1997, the most important year in the development of UNESCO/UN culture of peace initiative, three separate initiatives converged: the proclamation of the International Year for the Culture of Peace (2000); the proposal for the UN Declaration and Programme of Action on a Culture of Peace (see above); and the initiative of the Nobel Peace Laureates \"Campaign for the Children of the World\" that would eventually become the International Decade for a Culture of Peace and Non-Violence for the Children of the World (2001-2010).\n\nIn recent years UNESCO has continued to actively promote the culture of peace in Africa with programs co-ordinated by its field office in Gabon and in cooperation with governments and foundations in Angola and Côte d'Ivoire.\n\nBeginning in 2012 the President of the United Nations General Assembly has convened in September a High-Level Forum on the Culture of Peace. The themes of the 2012 Forum were education, youth outreach, and women’s empowerment. UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon opened the Forum, saying “When we look at the suffering in our world, we know how urgently we need a culture of peace.”\n\nSince 2012, similar High-Level Forums have been held at United Nations Headquarters each September.\n\nOn his retirement as Director-General of UNESCO, Federico Mayor established the Fundación Cultura de Paz to continue the work he had supervised while at UNESCO. The Fundación has sponsored many events and projects over the years, including the midterm and final reports for the International Decade for a Culture of Peace and Non-Violence for the Children of the World. Mayor is frequently invited to address audiences around the world on the subject of the culture of peace \n\nThe Fundación maintains an updated History of the Culture of Peace which contains references to hundreds of documents and events that have followed up the recommendations of the Declaration and Programme of Action on a Culture of Peace\n\nThe Culture of Peace News Network, begun at UNESCO as part of the International Year for the Culture of Peace, has been continued as a source of news of events that promote the culture of peace. It is updated more or less daily with articles from around the world promoting at least one of the eight program areas of the culture of peace, and a review of the news is sent out as a bulletin each month.\n\n"}

According to eyewitnesses the death occurred after an altercation in Goumas' store, when the three men demanded that Goumas not speak to them in Greek in his own store, which Goumas refused. The suspects reportedly drove over the victim at least twice to make sure he was dead.\n\nThe death sent shockwaves through the ethnic Greek community of Albania, and demonstrators blocked the main highway from Vlorë to Sarandë, which passes through the region. The event was reported by all major news outlets in both countries, and was strongly condemned by both the Greek and Albanian governments. Three suspects have been charged with murder and are awaiting trial.\n\nOn the morning of Thursday, August 12, 2010, three Albanian men from the town of Vlorë accosted Goumas in his store in the predominantly ethnic Greek town of Himarë, and demanded that he not speak to them in Greek according to eyewitnesses. According to eyewitness reports, Goumas refused, resulting in an altercation. The three men then assaulted Goumas. Several hours later, as Goumas was leaving his store, patrons at the store saw the three men leave in a hurry. Suspecting something to be amiss, friends of the 37-year-old followed them and found Goumas a short distance outside the town lying bleeding on the pavement, his motorcycle bearing marks of a hit and run. According to police reports, the suspects had rammed Goumas' motorcycle with their Audi, injuring him fatally. The suspects reportedly drove over the victim twice, so as to make sure he was dead, then fled the scene.\n\nThe death and lack of immediate police response sparked outrage throughout the predominantly ethnic Greek region of Himarë.\nDemonstrators blocked the main highway between the towns of Vlorë and Sarandë using rocks, while municipal workers in the town of Himarë held a work stoppage. According to the Himariote Union, the death of Goumas was the culmination of a series of recent provocations in the town of Himarë by Albanian nationalists. Local Greeks further called for the replacement of certain individuals in the Himarë police force, stating that attacks against ethnic Greeks have occurred frequently in the past and been duly reported, without the local police authorities showing the slightest interest.\n\nInitial reports in the Albania news media characterized the incident as a traffic accident resulting from road rage. However, Albanian Prime Minister Sali Berisha issued an unusually strong condemnation of the incident, calling the incident an \"act of extreme and blind fanaticism\" and demanding that police authorities make every effort to find the perpetrators and bring them to justice. The death of Goumas was also condemned by the main opposition Albanian Socialist Party and the Socialist Movement for Integration party.\n\nThe ethnic Greek mayor of Himarë, Vasil Bollano, spoke of a \"premeditated crime\" as the suspects had been \"provoking the victim for days\".\n\nVangjel Dule, leader of the Unity for Human Rights Party, which champions the rights Greek minority in Albania, called for restructuring of the police force in Himarë, and for greater recruitment of local Himariotes to the local force.\n\nThe death was reported by all major news outlets in Greece, and was strongly condemned by the Greek government. George Papandreou, the Prime Minister of Greece, strongly condemned the incident, adding that \"the rise of nationalism among extremist groups targeting the Greek minority in Albania is a very serious matter\". Greek Foreign Ministry spokesman Dimitris Delavekouras said that the perpetrators acted out of ethnic prejudice and that such incidents were designed to stir ethnic tensions and undermine Greek-Albanian relations. He called for \"swift and proper\" justice and further underlined that respect for minorities is one of the conditions for EU membership. The main opposition New Democracy (ND) party and the Communist Party of Greece (KKE) also sharply condemned the incident and called on the Greek government to take all necessary measures to ensure that a full investigation and judicial actions are taken. The issue was brought to the European Parliament by three Parliamentary Questions.\n\nThe Albanian police were slothish at first, having ignored the victim's many pleas to them in the days beforehand. Only after the outcry following the murder did they being to treat the incident as a homicide and launch a manhunt in the region; they arrested seven individuals aged 19 to 22, while the main suspect remained at large. The main suspect, Ilir Mukaj from Vlorë, surrendered to police late on Sunday, August 15. Seven people were eventually charged in all: Three for the murder of Goumas, and the other four for hiding the murder suspects.\n\nSeveral days after the incident, two cars driving on the road from Vlorë to Sarandë stopped in front of the Goumas family residence and fired bullets into the air. The Goumas family, which was in the house at the time, notified the police, who took eyewitness statements and collected bullet casings. According to diplomatic sources, there has recently been an upsurge in nationalist activity among Albanians, especially following the ruling of the International Court of Justice in favour of Kosovo's independence.\n\n"}

The youngest child of Francesco I d'Este, Duke of Modena and his third wife Lucrezia Barberini, Rinaldo had been created a cardinal in 1685, but he left the church in 1694 to succeed his nephew Francesco II as Duke of Modena. Rinaldo wanted to encourage relations between Modena and Brunswick, whose ruling house was the House of Hanover. The marriage was celebrated splendidly despite financial problems in Modena; the artist Marcantonio Franceschini was commissioned to paint a room, the \"Salone d'onore\" at the ducal palace in honour of the marriage.\n\nCharlotte fled Modena for Bologna in 1702 along with the rest of the Modenese royal family in order to avoid French troops in Italy due to the War of the Spanish Succession. \n\nHer husband was sixteen years older than Charlotte, but the two had seven children.

Other English-language terms commonly used in connection with hooligan firms include \"army\", \"boys\", \"casuals\", and \"crew\". Certain clubs have long-standing rivalries with other clubs and hooliganism associated with matches between them (sometimes called local derbies) is likely to be more severe.\n\nConflict may take place before, during or after matches. Participants often select locations away from stadiums to avoid arrest by the police, but conflict can also erupt spontaneously inside the stadium or in the surrounding streets. In extreme cases, hooligans, police, and bystanders have been killed, and body-armoured riot police have intervened with tear gas, police dogs, armoured vehicles and water cannons. Hooligan-led violence has been called \"aggro\" (short for \"aggravation\") and \"bovver\" (the Cockney pronunciation of \"bother\", i.e. trouble).\n\nHooligans who have the time and money, may follow national teams to away matches and engage in hooligan behaviour against the hooligans of the home team. They may also become involved in disorder involving the general public. While national-level firms do not exist in the form of club-level firms, hooligans supporting the national team may use a collective name indicating their allegiance.\n\nFootball hooliganism involves a wide range of behaviour, including:\n\nThe first instance of football violence is unknown, but the phenomenon can be traced back to 14th-century England. In 1314, Edward II banned football (at that time, a violent, unruly activity involving rival villages kicking a pig's bladder across the local heath) because he believed the disorder surrounding matches might lead to social unrest, or even treason. According to a University of Liverpool academic paper, conflict at an 1846 match in Derby, England, required a reading of the \"riot act\" and two groups of dragoons to effectively respond to the disorderly crowd. This same paper also identified \"pitch invasions\" as a common occurrence during the 1880s in English football.\n\nThe first recorded instances of football hooliganism in the modern game allegedly occurred during the 1880s in England, a period when gangs of supporters would intimidate neighbourhoods, in addition to attacking referees, opposing supporters and players. In 1885, after Preston North End beat Aston Villa 5–0 in a friendly match, both teams were pelted with stones, attacked with sticks, punched, kicked and spat at. One Preston player was beaten so severely that he lost consciousness and press reports at the time described the fans as \"howling roughs\". The following year, Preston fans fought Queen's Park fans in a railway station—the first alleged instance of football hooliganism outside of a match. In 1905, a number of Preston fans were tried for hooliganism, including a \"drunk and disorderly\" 70-year-old woman, following their match against Blackburn Rovers.\n\nAlthough instances of football crowd violence and disorder have been a feature of association football throughout its history (e.g. Millwall's ground was reportedly closed in 1920, 1934 and 1950 after crowd disturbances), the phenomenon only started to gain the media's attention in the late 1950s due to the re-emergence of violence in Latin American football. In the 1955–56 English football season, Liverpool and Everton fans were involved in a number of incidents and, by the 1960s, an average of 25 hooligan incidents were being reported each year in England. The label \"football hooliganism\" first began to appear in the English media in the mid-1960s, leading to increased media interest in, and reporting of, acts of disorder. It has been argued that this in turn created a 'moral panic' out of proportion with the scale of the actual problem.\n\nFootball hooliganism has factors in common with juvenile delinquency and what has been called \"ritualized male violence\". Sports Studies scholars Paul Gow and Joel Rookwood at Liverpool Hope University found in a 2008 study that \"Involvement in football violence can be explained in relation to a number of factors, relating to interaction, identity, legitimacy and power. Football violence is also thought to reflect expressions of strong emotional ties to a football team, which may help to reinforce a supporter’s sense of identity.\" In relation to the Heysel Stadium disaster one study from 1986 claimed that alcohol, irregular tickets sales, the disinterest of the organisers and the \"'cowardly ineptitude'\" of the police had led to the tragedy. Gow and Rookwood's 2008 study, which used interviews with British football hooligans found that while some identified structural social and physiological causes (e.g. aggression produces violent reactions) most interviewees claimed that media reports (especially in newspapers) and the police's handling of hooligan related events were the main causes of hooliganism. Political reasons may also play in part in hooliganism, especially if there is a political undertone to such a match (e.g. unfriendly nations facing each other).\n\nAs an attempt to explain the hooliganism phenomena in Brazil, Nepomuceno and other scholars at Federal University of Pernambuco has accessed 1363 hooligan incidents before and after an alcohol sanction enforced during 8 years. While alcohol presented low evidence to contribute for the incidents of violence, the knockout phases, finals, competitiveness (derby matches), small score boundaries and the pride levels were some of the potentials for the violence among sports spectators. Months after the work being conducted, the State Legislature of Pernambuco decided to abolish the sanction to allow alcohol intake in stadiums. Writing for the BBC in 2013, David Bond stated that in the UK, \n\nFootball hooligans often appear to be less interested in the football match than in the associated violence. They often engage in behaviour that risks their being arrested before the match, denied admittance to the stadium, ejected from the stadium during the match or banned from attending future matches. Hooligan groups often associate themselves with, and congregate in, a specific section (called an \"end\" in England) of their team's stadium, and sometimes they include the section's name in the name of their group. In the United Kingdom, 1960s and early 1970s football hooliganism was associated with the skinhead subculture. Later, the casual subculture transformed the British football hooligan scene. Instead of wearing working class skinhead-style clothes, which readily identified hooligans to the police, hooligans began wearing designer clothes and expensive \"offhand\" sportswear (clothing worn without careful attention to practical considerations), particularly Stone Island, Prada, Burberry, CP Company, Sergio Tacchini and Adidas.\n\nPolice and civil authorities in various countries with hooligan problems have taken a number of measures, including:\n\nFootball hooliganism in Bosnia and Herzegovina is particularly associated with the supporters of clubs such as FK Sarajevo (Horde Zla), FK Željezničar Sarajevo (The Maniacs), FK Velež Mostar (Red Army), HŠK Zrinjski Mostar (Ultrasi) and FK Borac Banja Luka (Lešinari). Other clubs with hooligans as supporters include FK Sloboda Tuzla (Fukare), NK Čelik Zenica (Robijaši) and NK Široki Brijeg (Škripari).\n\nHooliganism reflects local ethnic divisions and tensions. Bosniak oriented groups are fans of FK Sarajevo, FK Željezničar and FK Velež Mostar. Serb oriented groups are fans of FK Borac Banja Luka, FK Slavija, and FK Drina Zvornik (Vukovi). Croat oriented groups are fans of NK Široki Brijeg (Škripari) and HŠK Zrinjski Mostar.\n\nMany fans are associated with fascist ideologies, supporting and glorifying extremist movements such as the Ustaše, Chetniks and Nazis.\n\nIn 2009 riots between supports of Bosnian Premier League club sides NK Široki Brijeg and FK Sarajevo left Horde Zla supporter Vedran Puljić (from Sarajevo) dead from a gunshot wound.\n\nHooliganism has also been present in lower leagues. Riots have been common in Jablanica because fans of different clubs tend to meet and clash there.\n\nFootball hooliganism in Croatia has seen riots over inter-ethnic resentments and the politics that were reignited by the breakup of the Yugoslav federation in the 1990s. Two of the best known hooligan firms are Torcida (Hajduk Split) and Bad Blue Boys (Dinamo Zagreb). However, the groups are not just hooligan firms; they are more like the South American Torcida supporters groups and Ultras groups, with organised Tifos and so on.\n\nOn 13 May 1990 (before the breakup of Yugoslavia) Serbian club Red Star Belgrade was in Zagreb to play Dinamo Zagreb at the Maksimir Stadium. Red Star was accompanied by 3000 Delije, the organized supporters of the club. Before the match a number of small fights broke out. Police reinforcements soon arrived with armoured vehicles and water cannons, focusing to separate the fans. Dinamo's player Zvonimir Boban kicked one policeman, defending a Dinamo's fan beaten by the police. The fighting lasted for over an hour and hundreds of people were injured. Football hooliganism in Croatia is sometimes connected with racism and nationalism, although the racist remarks, if any appear, are pointed solely to opposing club's players, never to own squad.\n\nEthnic tension between Croats and Serbs has also led to fighting at a football match in Australia. On 13 March 2005, Sydney United (who have a large Croatian following, and were established by Croatian immigrants) and Bonnyrigg White Eagles (who have a large Serbian following and were established by Serbian immigrants) met in Sydney in the New South Wales Premier League. About 50 fans clashed, resulting in two police officers getting injured and five fans being arrested. Football NSW held an inquiry into the events. Both clubs denied that the fight was racially motivated or that there was any ethnic rivalry.\nP\nCroatian hooligans are also notorious for staging large illegal pyroshows at stadiums, where signal flares and smoke bombs are hurled onto the pitch causing postponement or cancellation of the match. A large incident occurred in 2003 in Rome during the Hajduk-Roma match when 900 Torcida fans threw signal flares at Roma fans resulting in various injuries and clashes with the police.\n\nAnother incident occurred in Genoa in 2007 when masked Torcida fans attacked the police with bricks, bottles and stones. Rioting continued in the stadium when Torcida fans threw chairs into the pitch and made nazi salutes. A riot occurred in 2006 in Osijek during the Osijek-Dinamo match. Several clashes between the Bad Blue Boys and Kohorta occurred before the match in which one Osijek fan received several stab wounds after which Osijek fans attacked the police and Dinamo fans with signal flares and stones.\n\nA large riot occurred in 2008 in Prague prior to the Sparta Prague-Dinamo match. Riots were ignited with the support of Sparta's ultrafans to Radovan Karadžić and Ratko Mladić. Approximately 500 Bad Blue Boys rioted in the city centre breaking shops and attacking police with chairs, signal flares and stones. Approximately 300 Bad Blue Boys were detained and 8 police officer were injured. Prior to the riots some Bad Blue Boys provoked local Romani people by giving nazi salutes.\n\nA large riot occurred in 2010 on 1.May at the Maksimir stadium when the Bad Blue Boys clashed with the police resulting in many arrests and one critically injured police officer. After the match violent clashes continued in which one Dinamo fan was shot by police officers. A large incident occurred in 2009 prior to the FC Timişoara-Dinamo match. 400 Bad Blue Boys rioted in the city centre and attacked local people. After the incident Romanian police detained a large number of Dinamo fans but the situation escalated again at the FC Timişoara stadium when 200 Bad Blue Boys tore down the pitch fence and attacked the police with chairs and bats resulting in several injured police officers. During the clash Dinamo fans fired signal missiles at FC Timişoara fans resulting in severe injuries.\nMany Croatian hooligan groups have also displayed nazi flags at matches and have neo-nazi skinheads in their ranks. Several incidents occurred when Bad Blue Boys and Torcida made racist chants towards opposing club's football players of African descent and hurled bananas in the pitch. In 2010, a Cameroon player was attacked in Koprivnica resulting in severe injuries.\n\nIn December 2010. 10–15 Tornado (Zadar) hooligans attacked a Partizan traveling coach with stones and bricks resulting in one injured person. In December 2010 30–40 Bad Blue Boys attacked a PAOK traveling coach with stones, bricks and flares setting the traveling coach on fire and inflicting injuries on several passengers.\n\nIn November 2014, during a Euro 2016 qualifying game in Milan, Italy hooligans from Croatia threw flares and fireworks onto the field and the game had to be briefly suspended.\n\nFootball hooliganism in Cyprus has been an issue for the past few decades and incidents are generally associated with the 5 major Cypriot clubs.\n\nAnorthosis Famagusta FC fans have been in involved in many incidents on most occasions involving their ultras group \"Mahites\". The two clubs in Limassol, AEL Limassol and Apollon Limassol have also been involved in numerous incidents, especially in recent years.\n\nSupporters of APOEL FC and AC Omonia Nicosia, the two most successful and most popular clubs in the country are notorious for hooliganism. The most violent cases of hooliganism in Cyprus usually involve the two teams. In May 2009 APOEL fans entered the Omonia stand and engaged in fistfights with Omonia fans eventually throwing one down the stand stairs. 6 months later in November fans of the two teams clashed close to the GSP Stadium when APOEL fans tried to hijack a futsal tournament organized by Omonia. Many were injured including an APOEL fan who was almost beaten to death.\n\nThe rivalry between Omonia and APOEL has its roots in politics. APOEL fans are in their majority right wing whereas Omonia fans are left wing. Communist symbols in the Omonia stand and right wing or even fascist symbols in the APOEL stand are not uncommon. The Limassol rivalry between Apollon and AEL Limassol is more a matter of what team dominates over the city. Hooliganism in the case of Anorthosis is also politically linked, especially when the club plays a left wing team such as Omonia. Other incidents between clubs of different cities that are of the same political orientation are associated with intercity rivalries, particularly when a club from Limassol faces a club from Nicosia.\n\nFootball hooliganism in France is often rooted in social conflict, including racial tension. In the 1990s, fans of Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) fought with supporters from Belgium, England, Germany, Italy and Scotland. There is a long-standing north/south rivalry between PSG (representing Paris and by extension northern France) and Olympique de Marseille (representing the South of France) which has encouraged authorities to be extremely mobilised during games between the two teams. Violent fights and post-game riots including car burning, and shop windows smashing have been a regular fixture of PSG-OM games. In 2000, the bitter rivalry turned particularly violent.\n\nOn 24 May 2001, fifty people were injured when fighting broke out at a match between PSG and Turkish club Galatasaray at the Parc des Princes stadium. PSG were initially given a record $571,000 fine, but it was reduced on appeal to $114,000. Galatasaray was initially fined $114,000 by UEFA, but it too was eventually reduced to $28,500. In May 2001, six PSG fans from the Supporters Club, were arrested and charged with assault, carrying weapons, throwing items on the pitch and racism. The six were alleged to have deliberately entered a part of the Parc des Princes stadium where French fans of Turkish origin were standing, in order to attack them. The six were banned from all football stadiums for the duration of their trial.\n\nOn 24 November 2006 a PSG fan was shot and killed by police and another seriously injured during fighting between PSG fans and the police. The violence occurred after PSG lost 4–2 to Israeli club Hapoel Tel Aviv at the Parc des Prince in a UEFA Cup match. PSG fans chased a fan of Hapoel Tel Aviv, shouting racist and anti-semitic slogans. A plainclothes police officer who tried to protect the Hapoel fan was attacked, and in the chaos, one fan was shot dead and another seriously injured. In response, the French Interior Minister, Nicolas Sarkozy held a meeting with the president of the French Football League, Frederic Thiriez to discuss racism and violence in football. The director-general of the French police, Michel Gaudin, insisted that measures against football hooliganism had reduced racist incidents to six that season from nineteen in the previous season. Gaudin also stated that 300 known hooligans could be banned from matches. The fan who was shot, was linked with the \"Boulogne Boys\", a group of fans who modelled themselves on British hooligans in the 1980s. The group's name comes from the Kop of Boulogne (KOB), one of the two main home fan stand at the Parc des Princes.\n\nThe KOB themselves held a silent memorial march attended by 300 and accused the police office of murdering the fan. They cited bias in the French press who had only given a \"one-sided\" account of the incident. French President Jacques Chirac condemned violence that led up to the shooting, stating that he was horrified by the reports of racism and anti-Semitism. French Prime Minister, Dominique de Villepin called for new, tougher measures to deal with football hooligans. Prosecutors opened an inquiry into the incident, to determine whether the officer involved should face criminal charges. Before a home match against Sochaux on 4 January 2006, two Arab youths were punched and kicked by white fans outside the entrance to the KOB. During the match racist insults were aimed at black players and a PSG player of Indian origin, Vikash Dhorasoo was told to \"go sell peanuts in the metro\". In the recent years, following UK's example, France's legislation has changed, including more and more banning of violent fans from stadiums. The threat of dissolution of fan groups has also tempered the outward rivalry and violence of a number of fans. Known violent fans under ban sentences are to report to the nearest Police station on nights of game, to prove they are not anywhere in proximity to the stadium.\n\nOn 11 June 2016, during a Euro 2016 match in Marseille between Russia and England, violent conflict broke out between the fans and left 35 injured. Both threw numerous items at each other and engaged in physical combat. Even a person who is recording the incident can be seen stomping another person's head. Because of this, both countries were given a disqualification warning soon later. The match ended with 1-1.\n\nOn 16 April 2017, during a match between Olympique Lyonnais and SC Bastia, supporters of SC Bastia invaded the pitch in an attempt to fight Lyonnais players. The match was then postponed.\n\nSome football hooliganism in Germany has been linked to neo-Nazism and far right groups. In June 1998, after a FIFA World Cup match in France between Germany and Yugoslavia a French policeman was beaten to the point of brain damage by German fans. Following the incident, German police contacted many of the known 2,000+ German hooligans to warn them they would be arrested if they travelled to upcoming matches in France. A German fan was arrested in 1998 and charged with attempted murder and in 1999, four more Germans were convicted in the attack In 2001, Markus Warnecke, the German fan who was accused of leading the attack, was found guilty and jailed for five years and banned from France for ten years, and from all sports facilities for five years.\nIn March 2005, German football fans fought with police and rival fans at a friendly match between Germany and Slovenia in Celje, Slovenia, damaging cars and shops, and shouting racist slogans. The German Football Association (DFB) apologised for the behaviour. As a result, 52 people were arrested; 40 Germans and 12 Slovenians. Following a 2–0 defeat to Slovakia in Bratislava, Slovakia, German hooligans fought with the local police, and six people were injured and two were taken into custody. The DFB again apologised for fans who chanted racist slogans.\n\nIn June 2006, Germany beat Poland in a World Cup Finals match in Dortmund, which led to violent clashes. The police detained over 300 people in Dortmund and German fans threw chairs, bottles and fireworks at the police. Of the 300 arrested, 120 were known hooligans. In October 2006, a task force was established to deal with violence and racism in German football stadiums. The worst incident took place at a Third division (North) match between the Hertha BSC Berlin B-team and Dynamo Dresden, in which 23 policemen were injured. In February 2007 in Saxony, all German lower league matches, from the fifth division downward were cancelled after about 800 fans attacked 300 police officers (injuring 39 of them) after a match between Lokomotive Leipzig and Erzgebirge Aue II.\nThere were minor disturbances after the Germany and England match during the 2010 FIFA World Cup. An English flag was burned down amongst a mob of German supporters in Duisburg-Hamborn in Germany.\n\nThe first incidents between Football fans in Greece were recorded in June 1930, after the match between Aris Thessaloniki and Panathinaikos F.C. at Thessaloniki. While Panathinaikos fans where arriving at the port of Piraeus from Thessaloniki, Olympiakos fans, who had not forgotten the big loss of their team (8–2) by Panathinaikos F.C. rioted with the green fans. \nThe word \"hooliganism\" was recorded at the early '60s where Greek students in the UK who had experienced the phenomenon of hooliganism there first taught the term to the journalists who were unable to explain why the fans were fighting each other and gave this situation a name.\nIn 1962, after Panathinaikos F.C. and P.A.O.K. F.C. match incidents, newspapers wrote for the first time that hooligans (Χούλιγκανς) vandalized Apostolos Nikolaidis Stadium.\nIt was on 19 November 1966 that a big flag, at the 13th gate of Apostolos Nikolaidis Stadium announced the arrival of a new group on the scene. Gate 13 would be the first organized group that over the years became a part of the club by affecting club decisions and by following the club on all possible occasions.\nP.A.O.K. F.C. fans made Gate 4 in 1978 and Olympiacos fans create the Gate 7 in 1981.\nIn 1982, between Aris FC – Paok FC match incidents, Aris Dimitriadis was stabbed and later died in Thessaloniki's hospital. On 26 October 1986, at the Alkazar stadium of Larissa Charalambos Blionas was killed by a flare pistol thrown by the Paok fans. One month later anastasios Zontos was stabbed to death in Omonoia square in the center of Athens before the match AEK Athens F.C. & P.A.O.K. F.C.. In January 1991, before the derby of Aek F.C. and Olympiakos F.C., George Panagiotou died in the incidents between hooligans outside Nea Filadelfia's stadium hit by flare pistol.\nOn 15 May 2005, in Thessaloniki derby Iraklis-Aris F.C., Aris' hooligans called \"Ierolohites\" invaded the pitch when the score was 2–1 for Iraklis. A football player Tasos Katsambis was injured during the clashes. The match was halted and Aris was punished with a 4-point deduction which led to their relegation to the Second Division.\nIn April 2007, all sports stadiums were closed down in Greece for two weeks following the death of a fan in a pre-arranged fight between hooligans in Athens on 29 March. The fight involved 500 fans of rival Super League Greece clubs Panathinaikos, which is based in Athens, and Olympiacos, which is based in nearby Piraeus. The Greek government immediately suspended all team sports in Greece and severed the ties between teams and their supporters' organizations. A Third Division match between Panetolikos and Ilioupoli was stopped for thirty minutes when players and fans clashed following a Panetolikos disallowed goal. Two players and a coach were sent to the hospital.\n\nOn 18 April, rival fans clashed with each other and riot police in Ioannina during and after a Greek Cup semi-final match between local rivals PAS Giannena and Larissa. There was trouble during the game in which Larissa won 2–0. Fans set fire to rubbish bins and smashed shop windows, while police tried to disperse them by firing tear gas.\n\nOn 10 October 2009, a group of about 30 hooligans disrupted an \"Under 17\" match between local rivals PAOK and Aris Thessaloniki. Among the injured were a group of Aris Thessaloniki players and their coach, a veteran PAOK player and another official. On 7 October 2011, a group of Greek supporters firebombed the away section of a Euro 2012 qualifying match against Croatia in Athens.\nOn 18 March 2012, during the match for the Super League Greek Championship in Athens Olympic Stadium between Panathinaikos and Olympiakos, home team Panathinaikos's fans who were inside the stadium attacked police forces with Molotov bombs, causing extended damages to the stadium, while police forces were unable to keep peace.\n\nOn 5 January 2014, in Aigaleo, a suburb in Athens, the local team Aigaleo FC was hosting AEK Athens, a Third Division match. Before the match clashes broke up between AEK and Aigaleo fans. Indeed, the clashes resulted in the arrest of a security guard of the stadium who was accused of participating in the clashes among Aigaleo hooligans and also accused of committing attempted murder against an AEK fan.\n\nOn 15 September 2014, in Nea Alikarnassos, the team Herodotus was hosting Ethnikos Piraeus , a Third Division match. On 75' minute of the game, a clash between the supporters of the two clubs forced the referee to stop the match. During the clash, a 45-year-old supporter of Ethnikos Piraeus suffered a severe head injury and died two weeks later.\n\nLocal derbies between Budapest teams Ferencvárosi Torna Club (based in Ferencváros) and Újpest FC (based in Újpest) are frequently occasions for violence between supporters. Other clubs whose supporters are reportedly involved in hooliganism include Debreceni VSC (Debrecen), Diósgyőri VTK (Miskolc), Nyíregyháza Spartacus FC (Nyíregyháza), Zalaegerszegi TE (Zalaegerszeg), Haladás VSE (Szombathely) and Videoton FC (Székesfehérvár)\n\nThe term \"ultrà\" or \"ultras\" is used to describe hooligans in Italy.\n\nIn February 2001, A.S. Roma fans fought with police and Liverpool F.C. fans, and five English supporters were stabbed.\n\nAfter a weekend of violence in January 2007, the president of the Italian Football Federation (FIGC) threatened to halt all league football. An official of amateur club Sammartinese died when he was caught up in a fight between players and fans in Luzzi, among numerous incidents of disorder in Florence, Bergamo and elsewhere. In February 2007 the Italian Football Federation (FIGC) suspended all football matches after Police Officer Filippo Raciti was killed at the match between Catania and Palermo when he was struck on his liver by a piece of \nlavatory of the stadium.\n\nIn a Euro 2016 qualifying match in Podgorica on 27 March 2015, a few seconds in, a hooligan threw a flare at Russia goalkeeper Igor Akinfeev injuring him. The match was then temporarily suspended. Later fighting between the teams and more hooliganism rendered the game abandoned.\n\nThe earliest recorded case of hooliganism in the Netherlands occurred when Rotterdam club Feyenoord and English club Tottenham Hotspur met at the 1974 UEFA Cup Final, where Tottenham hooligans destroyed portions of the Feyenoord stadium tribunes. It was the first time the Netherlands encountered such destructive hooliganism. Other Dutch clubs associated with hooliganism include PSV Eindhoven, Ajax, FC Utrecht, FC Groningen, Twente Enschede and ADO Den Haag.\n\nThe most violent rivalry is between Ajax and Feyenoord. A particularly serious incident was the so-called \"Battle of Beverwijk\" on 23 March 1997, in which several people were seriously injured and one killed. The 2002–03 season was marked by similar incidents, and also by fighting between fans of Ajax and FC Utrecht.\nOther serious incidents include:\n\nOne of the biggest riots occurred at a World Cup qualifying match between Poland and England on 29 May 1993 in Chorzów.\n\nArranged football hooligan fights in Poland are known as \"ustawki\"; they became common in Poland since the late 90s. On 30 March 2003, Polish police arrested 120 people after rival football supporters fought during a match between Śląsk Wrocław and Arka Gdynia. During the riot, hooligans pelted police officers with stones and fought a running battle with knives and axes. One victim was seriously injured and later died in hospital.\n\nDuring the 1998–99 UEFA Cup, a knife was thrown at Italian footballer Dino Baggio, from Parma F.C. by Polish supporters (allegedly Wisła Kraków fans), injuring his head. Supporters of Legia Warszawa also attracted negative attention after in Lithuania during the match against Vetra Vilnius on 10 July 2007.\n\nThe most notable hooligan incidents happened in Kraków where supporters of the Wisła Kraków and KS Cracovia teams have a rivalry that reportedly extended to killings of opposing fans.\n\nCountry-wide riots involving football fans were seen in 1998 in Słupsk and 2015 in Knurów, both incidents sparked by a killing of a fan by the police.\n\nFootball Hooliganism was never an issue in Ireland up until the early 2000s and involved many pre match fights began to spawn in areas such as County Louth, Dublin and Derry. The behaviour of fans in these areas involved fights, racist chants and banners and many different pyrotechnic tools such as flares, smoke bombs and strobes. Often enough the away team and League of Ireland matches would be ganged up on by the home teams and attacked.\nFootball hooliganism has become prevalent in Russia since the beginning of the 2000s, Hooligans are associated with teams such as FC Spartak Moscow (Gladiators, Shkola, Union), FC Lokomotiv Moscow (Red-Green's, Vikings, BHZ, Trains Team), PFC CSKA Moscow (RBW, Gallant Steeds, Yaroslavka, Einfach Jugend), FC Dynamo Moscow (Capitals, 9-ka), FC Torpedo Moscow (Tubes, TroubleMakers) – all from Moscow – and FC Zenit Saint Petersburg (Music Hall, Coalition, Snakes Firm) from Saint Petersburg. Russian hooligans often show an underlying resentment towards Russia's perceived political rivals. At the UEFA Euro 2016 tournament, 50 Russian fans were deported and the international team fined €150,000 following co-ordinated violent attacks. \nThe most prominent groups of hooligans are associated with Belgrade and Serbia's two main clubs, Red Star Belgrade and Partizan Belgrade. They are known as the \"Delije\" (\"Heroes\") and \"Grobari\" (\"Gravediggers\"), respectively. FK Rad is a less-successful Belgrade club, whose associated hooligans, known locally as \"United Force\", have notoriously been involved in many violent incidents. On 2 December 2007, a plainclothes police officer was seriously injured when he was attacked during a Serbian Superliga match between Red Star Belgrade and Hajduk Kula. On 14 April 2008 a football fan was killed near Novi Sad after clashes between FK Partizan's Grobari and fans of FK Vojvodina. That same week, after a Red Star Belgrade-Partizan cup match, three people were injured and a bus destroyed by hooligans.\n\nOn 19 September 2008 a Serbian football hooligan was sentenced to ten years in jail for an attack against a police officer at a Red Star Belgrade–Hajduk Kula game. On 12 October 2010 Serbia's Euro 2012 Qualifying clash with Italy was abandoned after only 6 minutes after several Serbian fans threw flares and fireworks onto the pitch and caused severe trouble in and out of the ground. Partizan Belgrade were disqualified from the UEFA Cup, after crowd trouble in Mostar, Bosnia & Herzegovina. Partizan fans threw flares and stones and fought with supporters of Zrinjski Mostar and police. Fourteen Partizan fans were convicted for the murder of Toulouse FC fan Brice Taton in Belgrade. They attacked him and other fans with baseball bats and flares while wearing surgical masks. The hooligans received up to 35 years in prison.\n\nFootball hooliganism in Spain arises from three main sources. The first is racism, as some black players have been victims of ethnic slurs. Samuel Eto'o, a former FC Barcelona player from Cameroon, has denounced the problem.\n\nThe second source is the strong rivalry between Real Madrid and Barcelona. After transferring from Barcelona to Real Madrid, Luís Figo's appearance in Barcelona's Nou Camp Stadium triggered a strong reaction. The crowd threw bottles, mobile phones and other things (including a pig's head). Although nobody was injured the match was followed by a large discussion on fan violence in the Spanish Primera División.\n\nHooliganism is also rooted in deep political divisions arising from the General Franco fascist regime days (some Real Madrid, Atlético Madrid, Espanyol, Real Betis Balompie or Valencia CF ultras are linked to franquista groups), the communist ones, (such as Deportivo La Coruña, Athletic Club Bilbao, Sevilla FC, Celta de Vigo, Rayo Vallecano) and the independentist movements in Catalonia (like FC Barcelona), Galicia and the Basque region. In Spain, organized hooligan groups are popularly called \"grupos ultra\". Three notorious ones are the Boixos Nois, the Frente Atlético and the Ultras Sur, supporter groups of FC Barcelona, Atlético Madrid and Real Madrid respectively.\n\nIn 1991, Frederiq Roiquier, a French supporter of Espanyol de Barcelona was killed by FC Barcelona hooligans which mistook him for an Espanyol hooligan. In 1992 a 13-year-old child died in Espanyol stadium before a flare impact in his thorax. In 1998, Aitor Zabaleta, a supporter of Real Sociedad was killed by an Atlético Madrid hooligan who was linked to a neo-Nazi group (Bastión), just before a match between these two teams. In 2003, a supporter of Deportivo La Coruña was killed in riots by Deportivo hooligans, when he tried to protect a supporter of the opposing team, SD Compostela. Since then, authorities have made attempts to bring hooliganism more under control. In 2007, there were acts of hooliganism before a match between Atlético Madrid and Real Madrid, with several cars being destroyed and policemen injured by flares and bottles which were thrown at them.\n\nMany black foreign players have been racially abused, such as at a 2004 friendly match between Spain and England, in which black England players such as Shaun Wright-Phillips and Ashley Cole endured monkey chants from Spain supporters. There also have been local disputes between rival teams, for example between Cádiz Club de Fútbol and Xerez CD, Real Betis Balompie and Sevilla FC or Deportivo de La Coruña and Celta de Vigo.\n\nHooligan violence in Spain decreased since the late '90s due to an alcohol ban in sporting events as well as hooligan laws which attempt fines up to 600,000 euros and bans of two years without access to stadiums.\n\nSince 2003 FC Barcelona hooligans, the Boixos Nois are not allowed to enter in Camp Nou. The hardcore of Barcelona hooligans subgroups were involved in police operations against organized crime. In 2008, after a hooligan incident versus Espanyol, FC Barcelona very publicly took a stand on violence, saying it hoped to stamp out violence for good. In 2007 Atlético Madrid hooligans clashed with Aberdeen FC hooligans prior to a UEFA Cup match.In 2009 and 2010 Atlético Madrid hooligans also clashed with FC Porto and Sporting Clube de Portugal in Portugal during UEFA Cup games.\nIn 2012 a Rayo Vallecano Hooligan was arrested during riots in 14-November general strike and accused of terrorism.\n\nIn 2014, debate about eradicating Spanish hooligans arose after Frente Atlético members murdered a Riazor Blues member, Deportivo La Coruña radicals; and after members of the Boixos Nois stabbed two PSG supporters in Barcelona.\n\nIn 2016, Football-related violence came once again to the public debate after a Fight between Sevilla FC and Juventus FC Supporters that occurred the day before their UEFA Champions League group stage match. 2 Juventus supporters were stabbed (one of them was seriously injured but survived after being hospitalized) and a Sevilla supporter was hospitalized with head wounds caused by a glass bottle.\n\nHooliganism began in Sweden at the turn of the 20th century as fans of AIK, Hammarby and Djurgården have been reported fighting after derbies in Stockholm. Modern hooliganism began in 1970 when fans of IFK Göteborg invaded the pitch, destroyed the goalposts and fought the police at the end of a match that relegated Göteborg from the Allsvenskan, although Hooliganism in Sweden became a growing problem in the 1980s, but pitch invasions and violence at football grounds decreased in the late 1990s; when hooligan firms started pre-arranging their fights away from the grounds and the regular supporters. Seven clubs that have large organised hooligans firms are AIK (Firman Boys), IFK Göteborg (Wisemen) Djurgårdens IF (DFG) Hammarby IF (KGB) Malmö FF (True Rockers) GAIS (Gärningsmännen) and Helsingborgs IF (Frontline). But several other football, bandy and ice hockey clubs have active hooligan followings. In November 2002, 12 members of the Wisemen stood trial for inflicting life-threatening injuries on a Hammarby fan in 2001.\n\nIn August 2002, Tony Deogan, a member of the Wisemen, was killed after a pre-arranged fight against Firman Boys. A second fatality occurred in March 2014, when a 43-year-old Djurgården supporter was killed in Helsingborg in an assault on his way to Djurgården's opening match in the 2014 Allsvenskan against Helsingborg. After the man's death became known, Djurgården supporters invaded the pitch after 42 minutes of play, prompting officials to abandon the match.\n\nIn Switzerland, hooligan incidents are rare due to the fact that the stadiums are small and teams are little.\n\nOne incident, dubbed the 2006 Basel Hooligan Incident, 13 May 2006, occurred on the last day of the 2005–06 season, when FC Zürich defeated FC Basel at St. Jakob Park to win the Swiss championship with a last-minute goal. After the final whistle, angry Basel hooligans stormed the field and attacked Zürich players. The Zürich team were forced to celebrate in the upper deck of the stands while the fighting continued. There was similar fighting in the streets that night.\n\nAccording to the \"Turkish Daily News\", hooligan groups are well organised, have their own \"leaders\", and often consist of organised street fighters. These groups have a \"racon\" (code of conduct), which states that the intention must be to injure rather than kill and that a stab must be made below the waist. Other hooligans have fired firearms into the air to celebrate their team's victory, which has been known to accidentally kill innocent people watching the celebrations on their balconies.\n\nTrouble has arisen during matches between Istanbul rivals Galatasaray and Fenerbahçe. However, the Turkish Football Federation has tightened security to try and contain the hooliganism. During the 2005 Turkish cup final between Galatasaray and Fenerbahçe, 8,000 police, stewards and officials were employed to prevent violence. In 2006, the Turkish Football Federation introduced new measures to combat the threat of hooliganism and have made new regulations that allow the Professional Football Disciplinary Board to fine clubs up to YTL 250,000 for their fans behavior. Repeat offenders could be fined up to YTL 500,000. Despite reports from the Turkish Football Federation, the Turkish police believe that football hooliganism is not a major threat and are \"isolated incidents\".\n\nBefore Galatasaray's semi-final UEFA Cup match with Leeds United in 2000, two Leeds fans, Christopher Loftus and Kevin Speight, were stabbed to death in Istanbul following street fights between Turkish and British hooligans. UEFA allowed the game to proceed and Galatasaray won 2–0. Leeds complained because home fans jeered while a message of condolence was read for the victims. Galatasaray's players refused to wear black arm bands. The Leeds chairman at the time, Peter Ridsdale, accused Galatasaray of \"showing a lack of respect\". He also revealed that his teams' players had received death threats before the match.\n\nAli Ümit Demir was arrested and sentenced to 15 years imprisonment for the stabbing, but the sentence was reduced to 5 years on the basis of heavy provocation, while five others were given lesser sentences of under four months. The families of those accused of attacking with knives are reported to have defended their actions and approved of their children punishing the \"rude British people\". Galatasaray fans were banned from traveling to the return match to try and avoid further clashes between fans, although there were reports of attacks by Leeds fans on Turkish television crews and the police. However the Assistant Chief Constable in charge of policing the game believed that the number of arrests was \"no worse than a normal high category game\". Hakan Şükür was hit with projectiles from Leeds United supporters and the Galatasaray team bus was stoned after driving through an underpass. The game saw Emre Belözoğlu and Harry Kewell sent off and Galatasaray sealed their way to the final with a 2–2 score.\n\nViolence also occurred between Arsenal fans (mainly from The Herd) and Galatasaray fans before the 2000 UEFA Cup final in Copenhagen in which a Galatasaray fan, an Arsenal fan and a Dane were said to have been stabbed. Galatasaray later won the match after a penalty shoot-out.\n\nOn 24 May 2001, 50 people were injured when fighting broke out at a match between French club PSG and Galatasaray at the Parc des Princes stadium.[16][17]PSG were initially given a record $571,000 fine, but it was reduced on appeal to $114,000. Galatasaray was initially fined $114,000 by UEFA, but it too was eventually reduced to $28,500.[18] In May 2001, six PSG fans from the Supporters Club, were arrested and charged with assault, carrying weapons, throwing items on the pitch and racism. The six were alleged to have deliberately entered a part of the Parc des Princes stadium where French fans of Turkish origin were standing, in order to attack them. The six were banned from all football stadiums for the duration of their trial.\n\nOn 3 June 2011, after the Belgium vs. Turkey match, several riots occurred in the city center of Ghent after a 1–1 draw. 30 people were injured. Hooliganism in Turkey is also a problem in Ankara, İzmir, Eskişehir, Bursa, Samsun and Adana . During the 2003–2004 season, a Second League Category A, match between Karşıyaka and Göztepe on 8 February 2004, involved rival Karşıyaka and Göztepe supporters clashing and the match was subsequently stopped for 33 minutes. This was due to Karşıyaka leading 5–2 after coming back from a 2–0 deficit. After the match, Göztepe fans clashed with the police, seven police officers were wounded and fifteen Göztepe fans were arrested.\n\nBursaspor fans clashed with policemen at a match against Samsunspor match in the Süper Lig in Adapazarı at the end of the 2003–04 season. The match was played in Adapazarı due to events at a previous match between Bursaspor and Çaykur Rizespor. Bursaspor were playing to avoid relegation. Bursaspor won 1–0 the but were relegated to Category A after rivals won. After the match, Bursaspor fans ripped out and threw seats at the Sakarya Atatürk Stadium They also fought with craftsmen of Gölcük during their journey to Adapazarı. The Bursaspor-Diyarbakırspor game in March 2010 was suspended in the 17th minute after Diyarbakırspor supporters threw objects on the field. One object struck and knocked down an assistant referee.\n\nOn 7 May 2011, Bursaspor supporters clashed with the police ahead of the team's match with rival Beşiktaş. 25 police officers and 9 fans were injured in the violence. A Trabzonspor fan pointed a gun to the bus which carried the players of Fenerbahçe. During the Fenerbahçe-Galatasaray game at the end of 2011–2012 season Fenerbahçe fans clashed with the police the damage costed about 2 million dollars. Buses were stoned, Police cars set on fire and trees were set on fire by Fenerbahçe fans.This was described as a \"warzone\".\n\nThe 1967 Kayseri Atatürk Stadium Disaster was the worst hooliganism event that has ever happened in Turkey. It resulted in 40 deaths and some 600 were injured. The violence started following provocation of the Kayserispor fans in the half time, whose team went to leading by a goal scored in the first half.Supporters of the two teams threw rocks to each other.Some of the hooligans were also armed with bats and knives.The fleeing crowd caused a stampede in front of the stand exits.The events in the stadium were followed by vandalism in Kayseri and many-days lasting riots in Sivas. Hooliganism is also an issue in other sports like Basketball and Volleyball in Turkey.\n\nOn 13 May 2013, a Fenerbahce fan was stabbed to death after the Istanbul derby. The Fenerbahce fan was on his way back home after the match between Fenerbahçe and Galatasaray, when he was attacked by a group of Galatasaray fans at a bus stop, and died in hospital later.\n\nIn 2015, confectioners Ülker–previously \"one of Turkish football's biggest sponsors\"–ceased their support, reportedly due to \"low crowds, violence and poor atmosphere at matches\".\n\nThere are records of football hooliganism in the UK from the 1880s, and from no later than the 1960s the UK had a worldwide reputation for it – the phenomenon was often dubbed the \"English Disease\".\n\nFrom the 1970s, many organised hooligan firms sprang up, with most Football League clubs having at least one known organised hooligan element. Hooliganism was often as its worst when local rivals played each other. Supporters of teams including Arsenal, Chelsea, Leeds United, Millwall, Tottenham Hotspur, Portsmouth, West Ham United, Leicester City and \nBristol City were among those most frequently linked to hooliganism.\n\nRacism became a major factor in hooliganism around the same time, as black players became a regular feature in English league teams from the 1970s. Black players were frequently targeted with monkey chants, and had bananas thrown at them. Members of far-right groups including the National Front also sprayed racist slogans and distributed racist literature at matches.\n\nSectarian violence has long been a regular factor of crowd violence, as well as offensive chanting, at matches in Scotland between Celtic and Rangers.\n\nAs a result of the Heysel Stadium disaster at Brussels, Belgium, in 1985, where Liverpool FC fans rioting led to the death of 39 Juventus fans, English clubs were banned from all European competitions until 1990, with Liverpool (the English team present) banned for an additional year. According to Manchester United hooligan Colin Blaney in his autobiography 'The Undesirables', many of the football hooligan gangs in the UK used hooliganism as a cover for acquisitive forms of crime, specifically theft and burglary. This has also been confirmed in numerous other articles on the subject. In the 1980s and well into the 1990s the UK government led a major crackdown on football-related violence. While football hooliganism has been a growing concern in some other European countries in recent years, British football fans now tend to have a better reputation abroad. Although reports of British football hooliganism still surface, the instances now tend to occur at pre-arranged locations including pubs rather than at the matches themselves.\n\nEnglish clubs who have made the headlines for the worst and most frequent cases of hooliganism include Birmingham City (whose multi racial hooligan element gained the nickname \"Zulus\" from fans of rival teams in the 1970s when football hooligans were almost always white British), Chelsea (whose then chairman Ken Bates installed an electric fence at the club's stadium in the mid 1980s to combat hooligans, but was refused permission to switch it on during matches), Leeds United (who were banned from European competitions following a riot after the 1975 European Cup final against Bayern München), Liverpool (14 of whose fans were convicted after a riot at the 1985 European Cup final resulted in the deaths of 39 spectators at Heysel Stadium in Belgium when a stadium wall collapsed, leading to English clubs being banned from European competitions for 5 years), Manchester United (who were booted out of the European Cup Winner's Cup in 1977 after their fans rioted at a game in France, although they were reinstated to the competition on appeal), Millwall (whose most notorious hooliganism incident was in 1985 when their fans rioted in an FA Cup tie at Luton), Tottenham Hotspur who gained notoriety for the 1974 UEFA Cup Final disturbances and again in Rotterdam in 1983 (who had a section of fans banned from all football grounds in England in 2008 for their racial and homophobic abuse of former player Sol Campbell) and Wolves (who had dozens of fans convicted of incidents in the late 1980s involving the Subway Army hooligan firm at matches against teams including Cardiff City and Scarborough when they were in the Fourth Division).\n\nFootball hooliganism movement in Ukraine started in the 1980s. The first big fight (more than 800 people) involving football hooligans was registered in September 1987 between Dynamo Kyiv and Spartak Moscow fans in the center of Kiev. The 1990s passed in relative silence, as there were no big fights between hooligans. The origin of the football hooligan movement in Ukraine started in the mid-90s. On September 5, 1998 an important game between Ukraine and Russia's national football teams was played. Ukrainian hooligans began to unite in \"National crews\" to resist Russian fans. However, the mass union did not take place due to police intervention and were mainly composed of Ukrainian fans from Kiev and Dnipropetrovsk. In March 2001, several crews united and attacked 80 Belarusian fans after match between Ukraine and Belarus national football teams. At that exact time hooligans and ultras were separated, due to changes of views on supporting movement. One part decided to dedicate all time at the tribune to create a choreo in Italian style, and the others decided to remain faithful to English style with fighting and the same wear style. 15 April 2002 about 50 right Dynamo fans attacked Jewish quarter in Kiev. First, they stoned small shop and after that throw stoned in synagogue and beat up the head of synagogue and other believers.\n\nSince 2005 clashes between hooligans occurred mostly outside the city because of the excessive attention of police. During the Euro 2012 several leaders of football hooligans came under government pressure. During the Ukrainian revolution 2014 was announced about unification of all fans and imposed a ban on any provocation as burning attributes, fighting, offensive songs. During the war in eastern Ukraine many hooligans and ultras went to the defense of the state.\n\nBecause of the ban internal conflicts and successes in the international stage Ukrainian hooligans pay attention to foreign fans. After the match between FC Dnipro and Saint Etienne in Kiev several French fans were hospitalized with the stabbing. August 20, 2015 there was a big fight in Hydropark between Legia and Dynamo&Zorya hools. The biggest clash since unification occurred in Kiev, 6 December 2016 between Dynamo and Besiktas hooligans. For Turks it was very important match, because win of Turkey team mean's qualification to the European top stage. Few days before to Kiev came about 7,000 fans from Istanbul. Two days before match on the streets in different parts of Ukrainian capital witnessed the outbreak of numerous conflicts.\n\nTypically the biggest confrontation involving Ukrainian hooligans occurring in domestic competitions. The most famous confrontation: Klasychne derby, South derby and South-West derby between FC Karpaty Lviv and Shakhtar Donetsk. There are local derbys as: Donetsk derby or Kyiv derby.\n\nThe first murder related with Argentine football occurred on 21 September 1922 in Rosario, during the second half of a match between Tiro Federal Argentino (in its stadium) and Newell's Old Boys for the Copa Estímulo of the local first division, in a discussion between two fans. Enrique Battcock, a railroad worker and supporter of the home club (also former footballer and former member of the club's directing) was interpellated for Francisco Campá (Newell's Old Boys' supporter and member of the club's directing) for his behaviour, which carried a discussion that ended when Battcock hit in the face to Cambá, who retired from the stadium, returned after a little while, extracted a gun and shot him, causing Battcock's death.\n\nOn 2 November 1924 in Montevideo (Uruguay), occurred another murder where an Argentina fan was involved. After the final match of the South American Championship of this year between Uruguay and Argentina (that Uruguay won), in the Colón Hotel (where the Argentine national football team was staying) broke out a fight among Uruguay supporters and Argentine fans and footballers, where José Lázaro Rodríguez (a recognized Argentine supporter of Boca Juniors and the national team) shot to Pedro Demby, an Uruguayan fan that died consequently.\n\nOn 14 May 1939 at the stadium of Lanús (in the city of Lanús, in the Greater Buenos Aires), in a match of the minor divisions of the local team and Boca Juniors (previous to the match of the main teams of both clubs), after a foul committed by a player of Lanús, both teams began to fight. Seeing this, Boca Juniors fans wanted to tear down the fence and invade the pitch, prompting the police to fire shots to disperse them. But a police officer named Luis Estrella shot into the stands, killing two spectators: Luis López and Oscar Munitoli (a 9-year old).\n\nBut this violence was not only among fans, footballers or the police, but also against the referees. On 27 October 1946, during a match between Newell's Old Boys and San Lorenzo de Almagro at Newell's Old Boys stadium (in the city of Rosario), local fans tried to strangle the referee Osvaldo Cossio. The match was tied on two goals when Cossio annulled a goal of the premises, and the third goal of San Lorenzo de Almagro in the next play worsened the situation. 89 minutes into the game, several Newell's Old Boys fans entered the pitch, hit the umpire and tried to hang him with his own belt.\n\nAlthough in Argentine football violence was already present from the beginning (late 19th century), the organized groups (barras bravas) appeared in the 1950s (barras bravas of Independiente, San Lorenzo de Almagro, Lanús, Rosario Central, Vélez Sarsfield, Racing, etc.) and 1960s (barras bravas of Belgrano, Boca Juniors, River Plate, etc.), and continued to grow in the coming decades. With the time, every big and small football club in Argentina started to have its own corresponding barra brava, and all are violent or prepared for violence. In Argentina there are the most dangerous organized supporter groups in the world, and the most powerful of them are the barras bravas of Independiente (La Barra Del Rojo), Boca Juniors and Newell's Old Boys.\n\nBut this phenomenon suffered a major transformation in the late 1950s. The journalist Amílcar Romero sets 1958 as the beginning of the current barras bravas (although some had already existed since some years), with the random murder by the police of Mario Alberto Linker (a Boca Juniors supporter -not identified as such- that circumstantially was watching a match between Vélez Sársfield and River Plate at the José Amalfitani stadium), that was located in the grandstand of River Plate fans when some of them started a fight and the police burst throwing tear gas grenades, one of which hit to Linker in the chest, causing his death. Because of this murder in October 1958, the society notes the existence of this organized groups (the barras bravas). The so-called \"industrialization of football\" was the kickoff for this organization, because needed to control all aspects involved in the game. Before the emergence of these groups, when a team played as a visitor, was pressured by rival fans. This prompted the organization of the barras bravas in response to that pressure:\n\nIn this way, each club began having his barra brava, which was funded by the leaders of the institution. These groups were given their tickets and paid trips to the stadium, adding later other forms of financing. But the access to these \"benefits\" by the barra brava depended of the hierarchy inside her. For the barra brava to be prestigious, it had to be violent, so they began to increase the number of dead.\n\nAfter the death of Linker, in Argentine football began a phase marked by \"habituation\" to the violence of the barras bravas, and an increase in the number of deaths. According to Amílcar Romero, between 1958 and 1985, 103 deaths related to football violence took place in Argentina, that is, an average of one every three months. However, it also clarifies that the origin of such deaths is not always confrontation in the stadium, and range from the premeditated clash between barras bravas outside the sporting venues, police repression against disorder, infighting in a barra brava or \"accidents\", its analysis tends to show some kind of negligence or violation of safety standards.\n\nIn 1964 more than 300 football fans died and another 500 were injured in Lima (Peru) in a riot during an Olympic qualifying match between Argentina and Perú on 24 May. On 11 April 1967 in Argentina, before a match between Huracán and Racing de Avellaneda, a Racing fan of 15 years died murdered by the Huracán barra brava at the Tomás Adolfo Ducó stadium. Over 70 Boca Juniors fans died in 1968 when crowds attending a Superclásico in Buenos Aires stampeded after youths threw burning paper onto the terraces and the exit (Puerta 12) was locked.\n\nFrom the 1980s and onwards, the nuclei of the biggest barras bravas began to attend the matches of the Argentina national football team in the FIFA World Cups. That caused fights against supporters of other countries (sometimes were hooligans or ultras) and between the Argentine barras bravas themselves. Also, in the 1980s and the 1990s were recorded the highest levels of violence in the history of the Argentine football, and there was a new phenomenon: the internal fragmentation of the barras bravas. It was produced by the emergence of sub-groups with their own names inside the barras bravas. Sometimes these sub-groups fought among themselves to have the power within the barra brava to which they belonged.\n\nAn example of the violence of this years was the Roberto Basile's death. Before the start of a match between Boca Juniors and Racing in 1983 in the \"Bombonera\" stadium, this Racing supporter died after being pierced in the neck by a flare thrown from the Boca Juniors stand.\n\nIn 1997 a member of La Guardia Imperial (barra brava of Racing de Avellaneda) was murdered by an Independiente supporter.\n\nIn 2001, other supporter of Racing was killed, and the barra brava of Independiente was the main suspect. Independiente and Racing (both from the city of Avellaneda, in the Greater Buenos Aires) have a huge rivalry (they form the Avellaneda Derby), the second most important in Argentina but maybe the fiercest (noteworthy that their stadiums are apart only for about 300 meters).\n\nThe next year, one fan was killed and 12 people injured, including six police officers when fans of Racing Club de Avellaneda and Club Atlético Independiente clashed in February 2002.\n\nAn Independiente fan was shot dead, and another fan was shot in the back and hospitalized when about 400 rival fans fought outside Racing Clubs Estadio Juan Domingo Perón in Avellaneda before the match. Between 70 and 80 people were arrested as a result. The match started late when Independiente fans threw a smoke bomb at Racing Club goalkeeper, Gustavo Campagnuolo. That same weekend, 30 people were arrested and 10 police officers injured when fighting broke out at a match between Estudiantes de La Plata and Club de Gimnasia y Esgrima La Plata in La Plata.\n\nA 2002 investigation into football hooliganism in Argentina stated that football violence had become a national crisis, with about 40 people murdered at football matches in the preceding ten years. In the 2002 season, there had been five deaths and dozens of knife and shotgun casualties. At one point the season was suspended and there was widespread social disorder in the country. The first death in 2002 was at a match between fierce rivals Boca Juniors and River Plate. The match was abandoned and one Boca Juniors fan was shot dead. Boca Juniors, one of the largest clubs in Argentina, may have the largest barra brava element in the country (it is similar to the barras bravas of Independiente and River Plate), with their self-styled leader, Rafael Di Zeo, claiming in 2002 that they had over 2000 members (however there are doubts about the reliability of this information).\nIn 2004, while driving up to Rosario to watch their side play Rosario Central, Los Borrachos del Tablón (River's Barra Bravas) confronted a bus of Newell's firm (one of the big rival firms) on Highway 9, in a battle that killed two Newell's fans. Up to this day, some members of Los Borrachos still face charges because of the deaths.\n\nIn 2005 a footballer, Carlos Azcurra, was shot and seriously wounded by a police officer, when rival fans rioted during a Primera B Nacional match between local Mendoza rivals (but not a derby) San Martín de Mendoza and Godoy Cruz Antonio Tomba.\n\nDuring the 2006 FIFA World Cup in Germany, there was a confrontation between 6 members of the barra brava of Independiente and 16 members of the barras bravas of Boca Juniors and Defensa y Justicia (both were together) in the Czech Republic (the country where the three barras bravas were housed). As a result of the fight, a supporter of Boca Juniors had to be hospitalized.\n\nIn 2007, during the match of the promotion/relegation playoff of the 2006–2007 season between Nueva Chicago and Tigre (in the Nueva Chicago's stadium), broke out a fight between the barras bravas of both teams because, when a penalty was sanctionaty for Tigre (who was winning the match 2–1, a result that relegated to Nueva Chicago to the Second division) in the 92nd minute, the barra brava of Nueva Chicago invaded the pitch and ran on direction to the stand occupied by the supporters of Tigre to attack them. After this, were serious riots near the stadium (not only caused by the barras bravas, but also by ordinary people), and as a result of it, a fan of Tigre died.\n\nOn 19 March 2010 in a bar of Rosario, the ex leader of the Newell's Old Boys barra brava (Roberto \"Pimpi\" Camino) was shot and later died in a hospital of that city. Camino and his sub-group led the barra brava from 2002 to 2009, when they were expelled from it due to their defeat at the hands of another sub-group, which currently dominates La Hinchada Más Popular (name of the Newell's Old Boys barra brava). Some members of the now main sub-group are the suspects of the murder, and the bar's owners are suspected of helping them.\n\nIn the early morning of 4 July 2010 (the next day of the match between Argentina and Germany for quarter-finals of the 2010 FIFA World Cup) in Cape Town, South Africa, there was a fight between some integrants of the barras bravas of Independiente and Boca Juniors. During the brawl, one member of the Boca Juniors barra brava lost consciousness after being brutally beating by the Independiente fanatics. He was admitted to a hospital in the city and died there on 5 July.\n\nFrom 1924 to 2010 there were 245 deaths (250 with the Argentine recently died in South Africa) related to Argentine football (if the 300 dead in Perú in 1964 aren't counted).\n\nOn 14 May 2015, in a game between River Plate and Boca Juniors at La Bombonera, hooligans sprayed a substance which irritated River Plate players' eyes, and the game was suspended.\n\nFans in Brazil join in organized groups known as torcidas organizadas (\"organized supporters\") often considered criminal organizations that differ in many aspects from European hooligans. They act as the main supporters of each club and often sell products and even tickets. They have up to 60,000 members and are often involved in criminal activities other than fights such as drug dealing and threats to players. These fans establish alliances with other \"torcidas organizadas\" as they are called such as the alliance between Torcida Mancha Azul (Avaí Futebol Clube), Força Jovem Vasco (CR Vasco da Gama), Galoucura (Atlético Mineiro) and Mancha Verde (SE Palmeiras), the alliance between Torcida Independente (São Paulo F.C.), Torcida Jovem (CR Flamengo), Máfia Azul (Cruzeiro Esporte Clube) and Leões da TUF (Fortaleza Esporte Clube) and some other alliances. The \"torcidas organizadas\" are usually bigger and more committed to the spectacle in the stadiums than the English hooligan fans but they often schedule fights against rival groups where many are injured and killed. Fans of local rivals TJP – Torcida Jovem Ponte Preta (Associação Atlética Ponte Preta) and TFI -Torcida Fúria Independente (Guarani Futebol Clube) clashed and rioted at a match in Campinas in 2002. Violence had been expected, and just before kick-off, fans started fighting. Police tried to intervene but were pelted by stones. As the fighting continued inside the stadium, a railing collapsed and numerous fans fell over 13 ft (four metres) into a pit between the stands and the pitch. Over 30 people were injured. In Porto Alegre on South Brazil, Grêmio and Internacional fans, have a different way to support their teams with too much beer, no samba, no T-shirt identification, these 2 firms in this big city results in a long history of tension and conflict.\nRio de Janeiro State Police has a special battalion to deal with torcidas called GEPE (Grupamento Especial de Policiamento em Estádios, Portuguese for Stadium Police Special Unit).\n\nFollowing a 5-0 victory against arch-rivals Nacional in April 2014, Peñarol have undertaken an increasingly violent and unhinged attitude in the Uruguayan Clasico. While losing a championship play-off match against Nacional in June 2015, Peñarol's fans started a riot that delayed the game by 15 minutes before it was called off. In March 2016, Pablo Montiel - a supporter of Nacional - was shot to death by Peñarol fans after walking in the same neighborhood as Peñarol's new stadium named \"Campeon del Siglo\" (named after an IFFHS award not recognized by FIFA, intended as a petty insult towards Nacional). Ignacio Ruglio, a board member of Peñarol who have openly spread lies about Nacional, was interrogated by police following the murder of Montiel. In November 2016, the Uruguayan Clasico was cancelled before kick-off after Peñarol's supporters started a riot at the Estadio Centenario - one supporter was arrested holding a pistol, intended to shoot down Nacional players from the Amsterdam tribune. After winning a Clasico for Peñarol in September 2017, team captain Cristian Rodriguez openly called for murdering Nacional fans while celebrating the victory.\n\nThe \"Football War\" (Spanish: \"La guerra del fútbol\"), also known as the \"Soccer War\" or \"100 Hour War\", was a brief war fought by El Salvador and Honduras in 1969. It was caused by political conflicts between Hondurans and Salvadorans, namely issues concerning immigration from El Salvador to Honduras. These existing tensions between the two countries coincided with the inflamed rioting during the second North American qualifying round of the 1970 FIFA World Cup. Honduras and El Salvador met in the second North American qualifying round for the 1970 FIFA World Cup. There was fighting between fans at the first game in the Honduran capital of Tegucigalpa on 8 June 1969, which Honduras won 1–0. The second game, on 15 June 1969 in the Salvadoran capital of San Salvador, which was won 3–0 by El Salvador, was followed by even greater violence. A play-off match took place in Mexico City on 26 June 1969. El Salvador won 3–2 after extra time.\n\nThe war began on 14 July 1969, when the El Salvadoran military launched an attack against Honduras. The Organization of American States negotiated a cease-fire on the night of 18 July (hence \"100 Hour War\"), which took full effect on 20 July. El Salvadoran troops were withdrawn in early August. El Salvador dissolved all ties with Honduras, stating that \"the government of Honduras has not taken any effective measures to punish these crimes which constitute genocide, nor has it given assurances of indemnification or reparations for the damages caused to Salvadorans\". This led to border clashes between the two nations.\n\nFootball hooliganism in Mexico appears to be low key, but there have been some incidents, such as small-scale fighting between fans of Monterrey and Morelia at a Primera División match in Monterrey in 2003. In June 1998, one man died and several people were injured when Mexico football fans rioted after Mexico lost to Germany in the World Cup. After the match, hundreds of riot police were brought in to restore order because fans were looting and rioting. Fans then clashed with the police, and many fans were injured or arrested. In March 2014 dozens of Chivas supporters clashed with police during their derby with Atlas. Several police were hospitalized. As a result, Chivas banned all of their supporters for the Clasico against Club America.\n\nAt the 2015 Gold Cup, Mexican hooligans threw trash and drinks in separate games against Trinidad & Tobago and Panama.\n\nWhile soccer is traditionally viewed in the United States as a family-friendly event, played by children and supported by parents, some violence does still occur. For junior league soccer, parents can be overzealous and be begrudged over unrelated matters and fights between parents have been documented and reported with police being called and intervening. For major league soccer, on 20 July 2008, in a friendly match between Major League Soccer side Columbus Crew and English Premier League club West Ham United, in Columbus, Ohio, a fight broke out between rival fans. Police estimated more than 100 people were involved. An unruly encounter occurred between Toronto FC fans in 2009, upset from a loss in the Trillium Cup, and Columbus Crew fans. One Toronto fan was tasered by Columbus police.\n\nThat same weekend, a riot was narrowly avoided at a packed Giants Stadium as members of the New York Red Bulls supporters club, Empire Supporters Club (ESC), and members of the New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority security force clashed over what the ESC claimed was unfair and repeated mistreatment. Clashes also took place in the parking area around the stadium after the game, involving already ejected-for-life North Jersey Firm (NJF) members, and the New Jersey State Police were called to quell the situation. There were several arrests, mostly of known NJF hooligans. A rare moment of violence broke out in Seattle in March 2010 after a pre-season Portland Timbers win in Seattle, when three Sounders fans attacked a Timbers fan, choking and dragging him with his team scarf. On 21 April 2013 in Portland, a Portland Timbers supporter was assaulted by a group of San Jose Earthquakes supporters. While he was sitting in his car, he had taunted his scarf at a group of San Jose Supporters, one of which ran toward him and attacked him through his car window, breaking his car windshield and assaulting him. San Jose's 1906 Ultras were subsequently banned by the club from traveling to away matches. After much debate, the ban was lifted. On 10 August 2015, fans of New York Red Bulls and New York City FC clashed in a brawl outside a pub throwing trash and exchanging blows. On 23 May 2016, fans of both NYC FC and New York Red Bulls rioted outside Yankee Stadium in response to NYC FC's 7-0 defeat to the New York Red Bulls.\n\nFootball hooliganism in Bangladesh does not appear to be a major problem. However, in August 2001, 100 people were injured when thousands of football fans rampaged at a B-League match between Mohammedan Sporting Club and Rahmatganj Sporting Club in the Bangabandhu National Stadium, Dhaka. When the referee disallowed a penalty, Mohammedan fans invaded the pitch, throwing stones at the police, who had to fire tear gas at the fans to try and restore order. Outside the stadium dozens of cars and buses were damaged and set on fire.\n\nFootball hooliganism in China is often linked to accusations of corrupt refereeing, with Chinese football being plagued by allegations of match fixing in the early 2000s. After a match in 2000 between Shaanxi Guoli and Chengdu Wuniu in Xi'an, football fans clashed with police who used tear gas and water cannons to disperse the crowd. Eight people were arrested but later released. In March 2002 hundreds of football fans rioted at a match in Xi'an between Shaanxi Guoli and Qingdao Yizhong, as a result of fans' suspicions of match-fixing.\n\nTwo years earlier, following crowd trouble at a match also in Xi'an, the government demanded more action to stamp out football hooliganism.\n\nIn June 2002, riots in Fuzhou, Fujian had to be put down by heavily armed paramilitary police. The disorder started when fans were unable to watch the World Cup match between China and Brazil at an outside broadcast. On 4 July 2004 fans rioted in Beijing when China lost the final of the AFC Asian Cup to Japan, 3–1. Japanese flags were burned and a Japanese Embassy official's car vandalised. Japanese fans had to be protected by the police, and bussed to safety. The rioting was attributed to ill-feeling toward Japan for atrocities committed before and during the Second World War.\n\nBetween 1995 and 2018 there has been recorded 70 deaths in Indonesian soccer by the NGO Save Our Soccer (SOS). According to SOS data, 21 deaths of the 70, have occurred at the hands of a mob.\n\nIn India, most of the documented football riots have primarily taken place in Kolkata. Everytime the Calcutta derby takes place between Mohun Bagan A.C. and East Bengal F.C., tensions arise. However, it has taken the form of escalating violence twice- notably, at Eden Gardens on 16 August 1980. 16 people lost their lives that day due to a stampede. Another incident took place on 9 December 2012 at the Salt Lake Stadium. Though nobody was killed, Syed Nabi, a Mohun Bagan A.C. footballer, was injured by a brick thrown, according to the player, by Mohun Bagan A.C. supporters.\n\nIn the 2000s, tensions surrounding the Arab–Israeli conflict spilled over into sporadic riots between Jewish and Arab Israeli football fans. In December 2000 it was reported that every club in Israel was on a final warning following escalating violence and intimidation at matches.\n\nA number of incidents have involved Beitar Jerusalem, including racist abuse against overseas players, anti-Arab chants, use of smoke bombs and fireworks, and rioting. Beitar has a hooligan firm, La Familia, whose members consider Israeli Arabs to be their enemy. In November 2007 the Israel Football Association (IFA) ordered Beitar to play their game against the Arab club, Bnei Sakhnin behind closed doors after Beitar fans, led by La Familia, broke a minute's silence for former Prime Minister of Israel, Yitzhak Rabin and sang chants in praise of his assassin, Yigal Amir. After a pitch invasion led by La Familia on 13 April 2008, when Beitar were leading Maccabi Herzliya, 1–0, and about to win the Israeli Premier League, the match was abandoned and the points to their opponents. Beitar was docked two points and had to play its remaining home games behind closed doors.\n\nFootball riots in Jordan are generally regarded as an expression of tension between the country's Palestinian ethnic group and those who regard themselves as ethnically Jordanian, the two groups being of roughly equal size.\n\nIn December 2010, rioting broke out following a game between rival Amman clubs Al-Wehdat and Al-Faisaly clubs. Some Al-Faisali fans threw bottles at Al-Wehdat players and their fans. About 250 people were injured, 243 of them Al-Wehdat fans, according to senior officials from the hospitals. According to Al Jazeera, supporters of Al-Wehdat are generally of Palestinian origin, while Faisaly fans are of Jordanian origin. A similar riot occurred in 2009.\n\nFootball hooliganism in Malaysia frequently happen be it on league or international matches since 1980, and frequently associated with the hooligan supporters from clubs such as Kedah FA, Kelantan FA, Johor Darul Takzim F.C. Pahang FA, Sarawak FA, Selangor FA and Terengganu FA. During the 2014 AFF Championship, after Malaysia lost 1–2 to Vietnam, some Malaysian hooligan fans rushed to Vietnamese supporters area and began attacking Vietnamese fans resulting in injuries. After a series of investigation, a number of the hooligan supporters were found to be from the \"Inter Johor Firm\", one of the Johor Darul Takzim F.C. supporters and have since been banned from attending any matches. In early 17 May 2015, during the final FA Cup, Singapore LionsXII players and their fans were stranded at the Sultan Mizan Zainal Abidin Stadium for about five hours, after Terengganu fans turned violent over their team's failure to qualify to the Malaysian FA Cup final. Also in the same year on 8 September 2015, the FIFA World Cup qualification match between Malaysia and Saudi Arabia was abandoned after Malaysian hooligan supporters disrupt the match and attacking Saudis supporters. The scoreline before the match was abandoned was 1–2 in favour to Saudi Arabia. Another incident during the 2017 Southeast Asian Games that were hosted by Malaysia occurred on 21 August when two Myanmar football supporters was assaulted by a group of unidentified assailants after the end of the men's football group match between Malaysia and Myanmar. On 24 November 2018,It is being reported that around 20 Myanmar fans, including women, who were waiting for bus in Kuala Lumpur were attacked by around 30 Malaysians who physically and verbally assaulted the supporters after the end of 2018 AFF Championship.According to the Myanmar fans, the attackers shouted “babi” (pigs) at them as some of them ran off from the scene. But a few others were injured in the attack and had to be taken to the nearby hospital with the help of a local charity organisation.According to reports, the girls among the Myanmar fans were kicked at with three fans suffering serious injuries. The mobile phones of the Myanmar supporters were also grabbed by the attackers.\n\nHooliganism at Myanmar's football matches is common. On 1 October 2011, FIFA announced that Myanmar will be banned from the 2018 World Cup qualifiers after a home tie against Oman had to be stopped when the crowd pelted the opposition with bottles and rocks. \nThe ban however lifted on 7 November 2011 after FIFA reconsider the appeal made by the Myanmar Football Federation (MFF). During the 2013 Southeast Asian Games which Myanmar become the host, the sudden defeat of Myanmar football team to Indonesia in the group match that causing them failed to qualify the semi-finals led the Myanmar hooligan supporters to tore up seats, hurled stones at officers as well burning Southeast Asian Games memorabilia and other billboards.\n\nSupporters at home stadium Dasarath Stadium tend to act violently in regards to International Match. Cell phones and other objects were thrown during a match versus Bangladesh. Coins were hurled at players at a match against Palestine.\n\nThere was brief unrest from North Korean fans at an international match vs Iran in North Korea in 2005. It appears that a North Korean player got into an argument with the Syrian referee, and then things got out of hand.\n\nOn 12 March 2004 a fight between Arab and Kurdish supporters of rival Syrian football clubs at a match in Qamishli, north east of Damascus, escalated into full-scale riots that left 25 people dead and hundreds injured.\n\nHooliganism has begun to cast a dark spell on Thai football especially in the 2010s, with several club or international matches were marred with violences. During the 2014 Thai Premier League, following the 3–1 victory of Muangthong United F.C. against Singhtarua F.C., it sparked violence between the two clubs supporters. Another incident involving Thai supporters following Thai's victory against Vietnam in the 2015 AFF U-19 Youth Championship hosted by Laos began when they lighting and waving signal flares which responded by a team of Lao police who went into the stands to make sure that nobody got hurt but were met with a violent backlash from the hooligan supporters causing the police to fired a warning shot. Also after their victory in the 2016 AFF Championship, the Football Association of Thailand (FAT) was fined with U$30,000 for failing to prevent the hooligan supporters in their own stadium to set flares. Despite its co-operation with police in finding and arresting the hooligans, Thailand has been warned that severe punishment will be given if it happens again at any future FIFA or AFC matches.\n\nShortly after the end of the second leg 2016 AFF Championship semi-finals match in Hanoi between Indonesia and Vietnam, the Indonesian team while on their way back to their hostel was suddenly attacked by angry Vietnamese supporters who riding motorcycles with two large rocks being thrown into their bus following the failure of the Vietnamese national team to qualify for the finals, resulting in a slight injury of an Indonesian goalkeeping coach and their team doctor. One of the Indonesian player, Evan Dimas describe the attacks as “could ending someone career” as he witnessed “the two big rocks almost hit someone in the face while strucking the bus window” which led their bus driver to make a U-turn back to Mỹ Đình National Stadium for protection from the Vietnamese authorities especially when the large angry crowd of motorcyclists began to numbering and tried to surrounding their bus. A replacement bus was eventually dispatched with a heavy security from the Vietnamese authorities following the attacks with the Vietnam Football Federation (VFF) and other Vietnamese fans issuing an apology over the incident.\n\nFour died when troops opened fire at a derby match between AS Vita Club and DC Motema Pembe at the Stade des Martyrs in Kinshasa in November 1998. In April 2001, 14 people died following a stampede at a derby match between TP Mazembe and FC Saint Eloi Lupopo. When fans invaded the pitch after Mazembe had equalised, and rival fans started throwing missiles at each other, the police fired tear gas, and fans rushed to escape the effects of the tear gas. In the resulting stampede, 14 people died. Fans of the two clubs are alleged to have a history of hatred and violence towards each other.\n\nIn January 2006 riot police attacked Libyan fans in the Cairo International Stadium after they threw missiles at the Egyptian fans in the tier above them during a match between the Egypt national football team and the Morocco national team. The Libyan fans had stayed on to watch the match after they had seen Libya lose 2–1 to Côte d'Ivoire and had started taunting the home supporters. The Egyptian fans responded by asking them to leave the stadium and verbally attacking them at half time, and when, despite a plea to stop, it continued into the second half, the riot police were called in. The Libyan Football Association were fined $7,000 by the Confederation of African Football disciplinary Commission.\n\nA melee broke out on 1 February 2012, after fans of Al-Masry, the home team in Port Said, stormed the field after a rare 3–1 win against Al-Ahly, Egypt's top team. Al-Masry supporters attacked the Al-Ahly players and their fans, who tried to escape, with knives, swords, clubs, stones, bottles, and fireworks. At least 79 people were killed and over 1,000 were injured from both sides in the Mediterranean port city. On 26 January 2013 rioting broke out in Port Said in response to the announcement of death sentences for 21 individuals involved in the February 2012 disturbance. A mob of al-Masry supporters attempted to storm the prison where the sentenced were held; in the subsequent rioting 30 people were killed, including two police officers, and some 300 injured .\n\nAt the 2015 Africa Cup of Nations, at the semi-finals between the host country Equatorial Guinea and Ghana, hooligans invaded the pitch and threw bottles and missiles at the Ghana players. The Ghana FA compared it to a war zone in a tweet.\n\nMassive riots occurred during and after a Cup of African Nations qualifying game between rival neighbours Senegal and Gambia at the Leopold Sedar Senghor Stadium in Dakar, Senegal in June 2003. Gambian supporters hurled missiles towards Senegalese fans and were subsequently charged by soldiers. After the game, violent clashes were reported in both Gambia and Senegal. In Gambia several severe beatings of Senegalese citizens occurred, which led to over 200 Senegalese seeking shelter at their embassy. Also, there were rumours of a fatal beating of a Senegalese citizen. In Senegal a Gambian BBC reporter was attacked and robbed by a group of youths. The riots eventually led to the closing of the border between Gambia and Senegal until order was restored.\n\nUp to 125 people died and hundreds were injured when football fans stampeded at a match in Accra in 2001. Accra Hearts were leading 2–1 against Asante Kotoko – with five minutes left in the match – when some fans began throwing bottles and chairs onto the pitch. Police then fired tear gas into the crowd, creating panic. Fans rushed to escape the gas, and in the ensuing crush, up to 125 people were killed.\n\nGhana giant Asante Kotoko face ban after Fans assault referee in CAF confederations cup game with Etoile du Sahel of Tunisia.\n\nFighting among fans at a match led to one death on 6 May 2001 and injured 39 people.\n\nIn Kenya, the most hotly contested rivalry is the Nairobi derby between A.F.C. Leopards and Gor Mahia, both of whose fans are regularly associated with hooliganism. On 18 March 2012, a derby match was held up for over 26 minutes when a riot broke out leading to destruction of property and several people injured, after Gor Mahia midfielder Ali Abondo was shown a red card for a dangerous tackle on Leopards defender Amon Muchiri. Gor Mahia were banned by the Sports Stadia Management Board from playing in their facilities for the rest of the 2012 season, meaning that the club will not be able to play in neither the Nyayo National Stadium nor the Moi International Sports Centre. The KPL Board has yet to announce further disciplinary measures on the club. There is also a 2014 case where Gor Mahia fans are alleged to have injured Machakos residents and also vandalized property.\n\nEight fans died and 39 were injured as troops opened fire to stop both pro- and anti-Muammar al-Gaddafi sentiments being expressed in a Tripoli stadium during a match between Al Ahli and Al Ittihad in December 1996.\n\nAfter a World Cup qualifying match between Mali and Togo on 27 March 2005, which Togo won 2–1, Mali fans rioted and went on a spree of destruction and violence. The trouble started when Togo scored the winning goal. Police fired tear gas at Mali fans who had invaded the pitch. The match was abandoned and the result awarded to Togo. The result set off a wave of violence in the capital of Mali, Bamako. Thousands of Mali fans in Bamako began chanting threats toward the Mali players, cars were set on fire, stores looted, property and monuments destroyed and a building housing the local Olympics committee burnt down.\n\nIn May 1999, seven people died when rioting football fans threw petrol bombs into a casino, following a match in Port Louis between the Mauritian League champions, Scouts Club, and Fire Brigade SC. After the match which Fire Brigade SC won, hundreds of Scouts fans went on a rampage, attacking police vehicles and torching sugar cane fields.\n\nThe government of Mozambique had to apologise for the violent behaviour of Mozambique fans, before, during and after a match between Mozambique team, Clube Ferroviário de Maputo and Zimbabwe team, Dynamos on 10 May 1998. Ferroviário fans attacked the Dynamo players and the referee, stoned vehicles and fought running battles with riot police outside the stadium. Fifteen people, including four Red Cross workers, needed hospital treatment.\n\nIn Johannesburg, South Africa, on 14 January 1991, forty people died when fans surged toward a jammed exit to escape rival brawling fans at a match southwest of Johannesburg.\nSundowns had just scored their sixth goal in the 82nd minute at Loftus Stadium on Saturday afternoon when irate Buccaneers supporters invaded the pitch and clashed with Sundowns fans, resulting in several injuries.\n\nPlay was stopped for close to an hour before the last eight minutes were played, and 6-0 it ended.\n\nIn July 2000 twelve people died following a stampede, when they were crushed, at a World Cup qualifying match between Zimbabwe and South Africa in Harare. Police fired tear gas when the crowd started throwing missiles onto the pitch, after South Africa had taken a two-goal lead. After Delron Buckley scored South Africa's second goal bottles began to fly onto the pitch. The police then fired tear gas into the 60,000 crowd, who began running to the exits to escape the effects of the tear gas. The match had to be abandoned as players from both sides felt the effects of the tear gas and had to receive medical treatment. The police were condemned for firing tear gas, calling it a total over-reaction. In July 2002, two fans were shot when police opened fire on rioting fans at a match in Bulawayo. Seven police officers were injured and five vehicles badly damaged.\n\nSince the formation of the A-League in 2004, and the fall of the National Soccer League, football hooliganism has died off in competitions and incidents have become a one-off event during seasons.\n\nThe incident with most notoriety in Australia is the Pratten Park riot in 1985 where hundreds of fans stormed the pitch midway through a Sydney Olympic v Sydney City match. In a match between Melbourne Heart and Melbourne Victory in February 2013, 17 plastic seats were destroyed and flares were firing off. In a match between Sydney FC and Melbourne Victory in November 2013, one travelling Melbourne Victory fan was hospitalised with a stab wound by a sixteen-year-old civilian. In December 2013, a riot between Melbourne Victory and Western Sydney Wanderers broke out at a pub before the match later that day. \nAt an international football friendly between Australia and Serbia in Melbourne in June 2011, fans lit flares both inside and outside the stadium, and in city streets. Banners supporting Ratko Mladić, the Serbian military leader charged with war crimes by the International Court of Justice, were displayed. A laser pointer was seen in use. A seat inside the stadium was deemed damaged. In February 2011, Victoria Police said they were reluctant to cover Melbourne Victory games because of unacceptable behaviour by fans. Problems included violence, anti-social behaviour and the lighting of flares. Although the A-League is relatively young, being only 12 years old, there are hooligan and casual groups within club's active supporter bases. Although it is nothing like football hooliganism in Europe (or what it used to be), anti-social events occur somewhat rarely. A primary example would be the Bourke Street Brawl between Melbourne Victory and Western Sydney Wanderers fans, who gathered in numbers before a match in late 2013 and had a brawl in Melbourne, concerning many who are involved with football in Australia and authorities. There are small hooligan/casual groups in Australia, the most prominent being from the League's biggest fanbases, Melbourne Victory, Sydney FC and Western Sydney Wanderers though others exist within other supporter groups.\n\nFootball hooliganism has been depicted in films such as \"ID\", \"The Firm\", \"Cass\", \"The Football Factory\", \"Green Street\", \"Rise of the Footsoldier\", \"Awaydays\", \"The Brothers Grimsby\" and \"Eurotrip\". There are also many books about hooliganism, such as \"The Football Factory\" and \"Among the Thugs\". Some critics argue that these media representations glamorise violence and the hooligan lifestyle.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "17104172", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17104172", "title": "Friedrich Nietzsche and free will", "text": "Friedrich Nietzsche and free will\n\nThe 19th-century philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche is known as a critic of Judeo-Christian morality and religions in general. One of the arguments he raised against the truthfulness of these doctrines is that they are based upon the concept of free will, which, in his opinion, does not exist.\n\nIn \"The Gay Science\", Nietzsche praises Arthur Schopenhauer's \"immortal doctrines of the intellectuality of intuition, the apriority of the law of causality, (...) and the non-freedom of the will,\" which have not been assimilated enough by the disciples. Following is, then, the short description of those views of the latter philosopher.\n\nIn \"Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason\" Schopenhauer claimed to prove – in accordance with Kant and against Hume – that causality is present in the perceivable reality as its principle, i.e. it precedes and enables human perception (so called apriority of the principle of causality), and thus it is not just an observation of something likely, statistically frequent, which however does not happen \"on principle\" (empiricism of the principle of causality). More on this dispute in philosophy can be found in the article on free will.\n\nIn his treatise \"On the Freedom of the Will\", Schopenhauer calls the fact that we can do whatever we will a physical freedom, i.e. lack of physically present obstacles, which is not identical with moral freedom. Physically \"free\" means: one acting according only to one's will; if attempts are made to use this term to the will itself, the question arises: \"is will itself willed?,\" \"do you will the will to become so-and-so?\". It is therefore a specific aspect of the claim of freedom, in which it is stressed whether the course of consciousness follows indeed in a willed way. The problem of willing the will appears in \"Thus spake Zarathustra\", for instance in the chapter \"Backworldsmen.\"\n\nIn \"On the Freedom of the Will\", Schopenhauer demonstrates the (well known in philosophy) distinction between necessity and contingency. He calls \"necessary\" what follows from a given sufficient basis (i.e. that what is already certain – if one knows that the sufficient cause is present). On the other hand, one calls \"contingent\" or \"incidental\" (with regard to a sufficient basis) that what does not follow from the latter (so e.g. two unconnected events can be contingent to each other: like when a black cat crosses the street and one's job is lost on the same day). As \"moral\" freedom means lack of necessity, it would mean a lack of \"any\" basis: it \"would have to be defined as \"absolutely contingent\"\", i.e. an absolute fortuity, or chance.\n\nThe question about the freedom of will is thus the question whether something depends on another thing (a state, an event), i.e. is in some way determined by it, or does not depend on anything (then we call it a chance). Or, in other words, whether something can be predicted: whether it is certain (given the presence or absence of the sufficient cause) or not. Cf. Luther's argument: for him everything is a necessity because the Creator knows it already.\n\nIn \"Beyond Good and Evil\" Nietzsche criticizes the concept of free will both negatively and positively. He calls it a folly resulting from extravagant pride of man; and calls the idea a \"crass stupidity\". The latter probably relates to ordinary-man's visions about a god who (after the ellapse of eternal waiting) creates the world and then waits and observes (being, however, still \"beyond time\"): and then he is surprised and subdued by what one does. (This vision is brought up by Nietzsche in \"The Antichrist\".)\n\nNext, he argues that free will generally represents an error of \"causa sui\":\n\nFinally, he suggests that the only \"real\" thing about will is whether it is strong (i.e. hard to break) or weak:\n\nNothing is (or can be) fully resistant to stimula, for that would mean it is immutable: whereas nothing in this world is or can be immutable. He therefore continues here the Schopenhauer's issue of physical freedom: \"whether you will, what you willed to will\".\n\nWill is generally considered a mental power. \"Freedom\" of will could then be interpreted as: power of will (cf. the appropriate passus from \"The Antichrist\", where Nietzsche generally opposes will-based psychology). Will has power over actions, over many things; therefore, things are \"determined\" by will. But is this power unlimited? Does will rule without itself being ruled? (And further: does a Christian want to sin?) – Nietzsche disagrees. A godless man becomes pious out of \"grace\", he did not want it; and likewise a pious man becomes godless with no merit or guilt. Nietzsche suggests in many places that if a pious man loses faith, it is because of the power of his \"values\" over him, of the will for truthfulness...\n\nWill is something that determines human acts, thoughts etc. It is will what makes man reluctant to toss a coin for something (cf. \"The Antichrist\" about Christians: \"in point of fact, they simply do what they cannot help doing\"). The problem is, whether it is itself ruled? And here two terms which complicate the picture appear: the term \"me\" and \"chance\" (i.e. something independent from anything, beyond control).\n\nThe term \"me\" (as in the statements \"it's up to me\", \"it is \"you\" who willed that\") had already been recognized as empty in the preface of \"Beyond Good and Evil\" (or as connected with the \"superstition about the soul\"). Later Nietzsche stated more clearly that it was a tautology (\"what will I do? what will my decision be?\" – \"it's up to \"you\"\" – that actually means: your decision depends on your decision, something happens in your mind and not somewhere else...). See e.g. \"On the Genealogy of Morals\":\n\nThe same however can be applied to the \"moral\" weakness of a Christian (his lack of resistance), who would certainly prefer not to sin and would construct himself otherwise if he could. \"And many a one can command himself, but still sorely lacketh self-obedience!\" – Nietzsche criticizes the idea of \"free choice\", and even of \"choice\" in general (cf. the end of above quotation): man does not want to \"choose\", man wants to affirm himself (\"will to power\").\n\nAnother problem is the role of chance. Unless the change brought to man is too big, a chance is generally responded by will, \"wherever there is will\". He calls it \"the redemption (of chance)\". This topic dawns as early as in \"Human, All Too Human\", and it returns in many places of \"Zarathustra\". For instance in part 3 it is discussed as follows:\n\nEarlier in this part:\n\nTo cut it short, if it was always that \"\"we\" choose a chance\", then there would be determinism (for \"we\", \"we ourselves\" means: our will and its filtering and determining capabilities). And since it happens otherwise (\"a chance chooses us\"), then there is indeterminism. But the latter case means we have no will in a topic, i.e. it is at that time morally indifferent to us, \"adiaphora\", not opposed to anything (and therefore even more there is no guilt).\n\nSince free will is discussed, it must obviously be some restricted reality (if \"freedom\" meant \"everything,\" there would be no need for a separate word). What follows? That there must be events \"external\" to one's freedom: therefore, besides \"free will\" there should also consequently be \"unfree will.\" Although Nietzsche considers both terms entirely fictional, he gives some clues about the \"psychological\" reality behind them:\n\nIn short, an unexpected change. Now, going back to the mentioned definition, chance means: that what cannot be predicted. If randomness affects a man (unsubjugated, reaching even the surface of his consciousness), then \"unfree will\" occurs. Thus, whenever we call something free, we \"feel\" something free, in short: wherever we feel our power, it is deterministic, it is a necessity. And indeed Nietzsche says it with the mouth of Zarathustra:\n\nThe same in \"Beyond Good and Evil\":\n\nYet in another part of \"Zarathustra\" Nietzsche claims that when we look long-term enough and from the bird's-eye perspective of supreme powers big enough, a chance is unimportant, because it is subject to and step-by-step softened and arranged by natural laws and necessities which constitute the order of the world and evolution:\n\nTo Nietzsche everything in this world is an expression of will to power. To exist is to represent will to power, to \"cause influence\" (compare similar views of Protagoras' disciples in Plato's \"Theaetetus\"). One can cause influence only on something that exists. Therefore, (through induction) an act changes everything from that moment onwards. If one thing was otherwise, everything would have to be otherwise (and generally also backwards). Contrary to Chesterton's views, this general rule is not precluded even by absolute chances: they of course change the course of the world too, but still: if one thing was set otherwise, everything would have to be otherwise.\n\nSeveral scholars have argued that Nietzsche was not a determinist in his views of the universe. In \"Zarathustra\", absolute randomness (maybe not as the essence of reality, but as a part thereof) can be thought of, yes, perhaps it even exists:\n\nBecause \"causa sui\" is according to Nietzsche a nonsense, even to a chance could get a basis attributed (only \"the whole\" has no basis), and it would be \"divine dice\" (or \"Divine Plan\"):\n\nTo Nietzsche no one is responsible either for the necessities (laws and powers) he represents, or for chances he encounters (which conquer him unwillingly – and which, as things totally independent from anything, only the \"supreme being\" could change); after all, no one is absolutely and completely resistant, there can always happen something which changes one deeply enough.\n\nFrom \"The Dawn of Day\":\n\nIn \"Twilight of the Idols\" Nietzsche discusses fatalism and responsibility in these words:\n\nNietzsche's critique of free will has essentially two aspects: one is philosophical (fatalistic), and the other is psychological. Fatalism lets Nietzsche theoretically prove the error of moral doctrines, which – most generally speaking – would require that a sinner changed his destiny (for instance by changing the laws of nature, influencing chances which lie completely beyond the extent of his influence), which is by definition impossible. But such theory would not be convincing enough if at the same time the impression of control was not removed, as well as the ever renewed attempts at associating it with the \"freedom of will\" and building a philosophy out of that. Thus a psychological critique is needed.\n\nIf one agrees that the \"freedom of will\" denotes the power of will which rules but is not itself ruled, then it would at bottom be enough to prove that it is not will what governs human behaviour in order to abolish the very term, to prove that \"it is not there\". And Nietzsche went on to this. For Nietzsche the term \"will\" is psychologically strictly connected with the term \"aim\" (he often combines the two), maybe even they are identical to him. Aim could then be interpreted, according to a common definition, as planning and intellectual foreseeing (of especially effects); according to Nietzsche first and foremost the anticipation of acts which in fact do not need to follow by its virtue from aiming (which is here foreseeing).\n\nIn \"Twilight of the Idols\" Nietzsche demonstrates the \"error of false causality\" just before the \"error of free will\":\n\nand then, in the section directly regarding free will, he observes:\n\nSimilarly in \"The Antichrist\": \"the will no longer «acts,» or «moves»...\", \"the term no longer denotes any power\". This non-deriving of acts straight way out of aims, which are just foreseeing (the accompanying self-consciousness of that what is to come), but searching for their sources elsewhere (for example in reflexes, habits, urges) is to Nietzsche even one of major differences between medieval (Thomist) and modern psychology.\n\nNietzsche's words turned out to be prophetic, for modern neuroscience, especially the famous Libet's (or Kornhuber's) experiment and other of this type, has not once confirmed that the decision for an act is made beyond the (self)consciousness (in popular words, the will), which comes up to even half a second later.\n\nIn \"The Antichrist\" Nietzsche argues that man should be considered no otherwise than as a machine. Even if some generic chaos (randomness) is added to the picture, it does not affect this. A chance is innocent.\n\nNietzsche points out the weakness of human as well as of God. Man wills the good, \"God\" wills the good, and yet evil happens. So where is this \"freedom\" (i.e. power) of will? And where is this good God?\n\nThese two human valuations refer to things essentially mixed with each other and interdependent. Good causes the evil, and evil causes the good. The dichotomy between a good God and an evil satan is a \"dualistic fiction.\"\n\nIn \"Twilight of the Idols\" (see the quote above) and later in \"The Antichrist\" all concepts which explain life as a test or raise an (externally reasonable) moral \"task,\" \"purpose\" or the \"will of God\" are considered false. They are a part of the \"error of free will\" consisting in incomprehension of fatalism of life, i.e. the fact that it is shaped by higher forces.\n\nReligion is a form of controlling people: one man-machine wants to achieve power over another. Even the term \"freedom,\" very often used by theologians, in its positive sense actually means \"power.\" Religion is by no means more \"fulfilling the will of God\" than anything else. As God is primary and almighty, his will is by definition always fulfilled (it is impossible that he wills something and it is not fulfilled).\n\nA priest, a moralist does in fact nothing for man's \"salvation,\" but just rules, and even when doing so he acts in a way that would (apart from that) be considered immoral.\n\nNietzsche goes on to analysing the Bible philologically and to guesses about the person of Jesus. He claims that it was not the aim of the latter to have anybody serve him, for God rules everything anyway; to the contrary, in Nietzsche's opinion Jesus fought with churchedness and the notion of sin rooted in the Old Testament. And thus in \"The Antichrist\" Christianity was portrayed as the corruption of the original doctrine taught by Jesus about equal rights of all to be children of God, the doctrine of no guilt and of no gulf between God and man.\n\nThe very \"freedom of will\" was invented by the priests in order to master the process of human thinking – and nothing more. And in order to master it, they had first to denaturize it.\n\nThe downfall of Christian values is not an effect – as it has been presented hitherto – of human free will. The supreme values (especially formerly common in European culture) overthrow each other themselves due to inner contradictions and non-matching the nature.\n\n\n"}

She was also the first sworn female officer of the Metropolitan Police Department of the District of Columbia (MPDC) to have been killed in the line of duty.\nCobb was born in Washington, D.C., on August 17, 1950, the second of five children, and grew up at a row house near the intersection of 14th and D Streets in Northeast, Washington, D.C. Cobb's family moved to Washington, D.C., in the 1930s. Her father was Clinton Cobb, a correctional officer for the District of Columbia who tried to apply to the MPDC in 1953, but was rejected due to being shorter than five feet and eight inches tall. Cobb's mother was Gloria Cobb, a crossing guard at Kingsman Elementary School, who met Cobb's father at Cardoza High School. Cobb's sister, Denise, ultimately went on to become a schoolteacher.\n\nAs a child, Cobb attended Catholic schools and was described as an average, but creative and energetic student. She attended Elliot Jr. High School, Eastern High School, and the now-defunct St. Cecilia's Academy. Upon graduating St. Cecila's Academy in 1969, Cobb wanted to become a successful fashion designer. However, she had little means and knowledge on how to go about doing so and ended up becoming a long-distance operator at the Chesapeake and Potomac Telephone Company. \n\nCobb, a single mother, gave birth to a son, Damon Demetrius Cobb, on February 26, 1970. Her son's father, whom Cobb had met in high school, took no responsibility for his son, and Cobb ended up trying to raise him on her own. Cobb's son is currently serving a life sentence in prison at the Western Correctional Institution in Cumberland, Maryland, after being found guilty of first-degree murder in a 1992 killing. Cobb's parents stated in 1996 that they believed that her untimely murder influenced her son's current legal predicament at the time.\n\nIn October 1973, Cobb applied to become an officer with the MPDC, much to the surprise of her family and friends, after the Washington, D.C., government lowered the height requirements for police recruits to five feet. Cobb herself was five feet tall, and graduated from her 34-member police academy class in April 1974, of which 13 members were female. She was well-liked by her trainers, who noted that she was hard-working. She spent most of her patrol work on foot and signed up for training to get a scooter license and was taking a night class to learn sign language.\n\nLate in the morning of Friday, September 20, 1974, around 10:30 am, two men, John Curtis Dortch, a 29-year-old Howard University graduate and former U.S. Army soldier from Silver Spring, Maryland, and John William Bryant, a 24-year-old man from Washington, D.C., began making their way to the Eastern Liberty Federal Savings and Loan bank at 21st and L Streets NW, disguised as construction workers, and each carrying a loaded sawed-off shotgun and handgun. They intended to rob the bank.\n\nTwo plainclothes police officers were alerted of the robbery in advance, and saw the two men on the street. The officers stopped them and asked them for identification, before the would-be robbers could even get inside the bank. The two men ran off in separate directions. Cobb was still on probationary duty six months out of the academy and was assigned to foot patrol duty downtown, a block away from the bank. Cobb, who was writing a traffic ticket at the time, was told by a citizen that they saw an armed man run into a garage. Cobb followed the suspect and confronted him inside the garage as he was in the process of changing out of his disguise. Cobb ordered the man to place his hands on the wall. As she called for assistance over her radio, the suspect spun around and fired a single gunshot at Cobb at close range. The bullet went through Cobb's wrist, shattering a wristwatch that was given to her by her mother as a birthday present, then through her police radio, where it then penetrated her heart. Cobb died at the scene at 20th Street and L Street, NW, and responding officers arrested the suspect at the scene.\n\nCobb had served with the MPDC for one year and was the first female MPDC officer to be killed in the line of duty, as well as the first African American female law enforcement officer to be killed in the line of duty in the United States. She is survived by her son, Damon Demetrius Cobb, and is buried at Lincoln Memorial Cemetery in Suitland, Maryland, near the border between Washington, D.C., and Prince George's County, Maryland.\n\nCobb's funeral was ornate and large, even by Washington, D.C.'s standards. The streets leading to Holy Comforter Catholic Church in Southeast, Washington, D.C., were lined with hundreds of police officers, some coming all the way from Hawaii, all standing at attention. A police honor guard made several passes along East Capitol Street before entering the church.\n\nDelegations of uniformed officers filed past Cobb's open casket. Cobb was not buried in uniform; instead, she was wearing a green suit. Her best friend had styled her hair, applied her favorite makeup, and finished with gold hoop earrings that would have been strictly forbidden by uniform regulations for a police officer on duty.\n\nThe Mayor of the District of Columbia, Walter Washington, and FBI Director Clarence Kelley were among the many U.S. government officials who attended the crowded service on Tuesday, September 24, 1974. At the hour of the funeral, U.S. President Gerald R. Ford called for a moment of silence as he addressed an International Association of Police Chiefs conference being held across town.\n\nSeveral weeks after Cobb's funeral, her parents purchased a glass curio cabinet in which to house memorabilia regarding their daughter. They displayed a photograph of Cobb in her MPDC uniform, her police badge, along with a 45 rpm copy of her favorite song, \"Tell Her Love Has Felt the Need\", by Eddie Kendricks and the Young Senators, which had been sung at her funeral, along with proclamations and letters from government officials, and the uniform boots that Cobb had been wearing when she died. Given an entire section all to its own was a letter from U.S. President Gerald R. \nFord, saying that Cobb \"has our lasting admiration for the cause of law enforcement and the well-being of our society, a cause for which she made the highest sacrifice.\"\n\nIn 1975, John William Bryant was sentenced to 15 years to life imprisonment after being found guilty by a jury of second-degree murder. He was released on parole in 1992. The following year, in November 1993, he was arrested in Washington, D.C., for possessing crack cocaine and three bags of marijuana. However, a court ruled the cocaine and marijuana impermissible in court as the arresting officers did not have probable cause to believe that Bryant was committing a crime when they discovered them. In July 1997, the D.C. Parole Board revoked Bryant's parole for his possessing marijuana and cocaine, as well as testing positive for marijuana use. Bryant denied ever using marijuana. The D.C. Parole Board decided not to send Bryant back to prison, but rather to send him to an inpatient program for alcoholism treatment, much to the dismay of Cobb's relatives.\n\nIn 1996, John Curtis Dortch (born July 19, 1945), who was one of the key architects of the robbery that left Cobb dead, attempted to become a lawyer in West Virginia and Washington, D.C., after finishing a 15-year prison term for his being convicted of second-degree murder on July 30, 1975. After being released from prison on parole in 1989 for \"good behavior\", Dortch became active in church, helped out an AIDS patient, began tutoring and mentoring children, and started attending law school. Dortch, a graduate of Howard University and a former U.S. Army officer who served in the Vietnam War, was not the triggerman who shot Cobb, however, he attempted to appeal to the courts to allow him to become a lawyer, much to the dismay of Cobb's family and friends. In 1997, the West Virginia Supreme Court denied Dortch permission to practice law in the state in a unanimous 4-0 decision, to the praise of Cobb's surviving family members and friends. Dortch has since written an autobiography of his life, \"Memoirs of the Prodigal Son: the Road to Redemption, Fifteen Years in Prison and Beyond\", released in September 2008.\n\n\n"}

Use of AI techniques in management information systems has a long history – indeed terms such as \"Knowledge-based systems\" (KBS) and \"intelligent systems\" have been used since the early 1980s to describe components of management systems, but the term \"Intelligent decision support system\" is thought to originate with Clyde Holsapple and Andrew Whinston in the late 1970s. Examples of specialized intelligent decision support systems include Flexible manufacturing systems (FMS), intelligent marketing decision support systems and medical diagnosis systems.\n\nIdeally, an intelligent decision support system should behave like a human consultant: supporting decision makers by gathering and analysing evidence, identifying and diagnosing problems, proposing possible courses of action and evaluating such proposed actions. The aim of the AI techniques embedded in an intelligent decision support system is to enable these tasks to be performed by a computer, while emulating human capabilities as closely as possible.\n\nMany IDSS implementations are based on expert systems, a well established type of KBS that encode knowledge and emulate the cognitive behaviours of human experts using predicate logic rules, and have been shown to perform better than the original human experts in some circumstances. Expert systems emerged as practical applications in the 1980s based on research in artificial intelligence performed during the late 1960s and early 1970s. They typically combine knowledge of a particular application domain with an inference capability to enable the system to propose decisions or diagnoses. Accuracy and consistency can be comparable to (or even exceed) that of human experts when the decision parameters are well known (e.g. if a common disease is being diagnosed), but performance can be poor when novel or uncertain circumstances arise.\n\nResearch in AI focused on enabling systems to respond to novelty and uncertainty in more flexible ways is starting to be used in IDSS. For example, intelligent agents that perform complex cognitive tasks without any need for human intervention have been used in a range of decision support applications. Capabilities of these intelligent agents include knowledge sharing, machine learning, data mining, and automated inference. A range of AI techniques such as case based reasoning, rough sets and fuzzy logic have also been used to enable decision support systems to perform better in uncertain conditions.\n\n\n"}

He was electrocuted on January 10, 1986, nearly a year to the day following the electrocution of his accomplice, Joseph Carl Shaw on January 11, 1985, at the Central Correctional Institution in Columbia. He was executed at the age of 25 for a crime committed when he was 17 years old.\n\nHe was convicted of the rape and murder of a fourteen-year-old girl and the murder of her seventeen-year-old boyfriend. Evidence presented at the trial showed that Roach was mentally handicapped, with an I.Q. between 75 and 80 and that he was probably suffering from Huntington's Chorea.

Susanna's father, Sam Kittridge, another professor at Jameson's college, becomes suspicious of Jameson because he does not appear to have aged in the twelve years they have known each other and seems to have unrealistically detailed knowledge of some pieces of history that do not appear in texts. Jameson at one point reads from an original Civil War diary in his possession. Later, Kittridge recognizes Jameson in a Mathew Brady Civil War photograph. After he presents these pieces of evidence, Jameson ultimately reveals his real life history. Agelessness (but no kind of immunity to injury) was imparted to him by an alchemist more than 2,000 years ago. Jameson does not know what was done to him, only that the alchemist was gone when he recovered, and he then stopped aging. Soon, he had to become a constant refugee. He tells Kittridge that he learned a terrible lesson from living for so long and longs for death. He keeps a revolver in his desk drawer, but does not have the courage to use it.\n\nRealizing that if Jameson marries his daughter, she will grow old, and Jameson will eventually abandon her in order to keep his secret, Kittridge refuses permission for Jameson to marry his daughter.

Shortly after Bowen leaves, Kittridge enters Jameson's study and finds him bleeding, but seemingly at peace. Jameson rapidly ages and collapses on the floor. Susanna enters the house. Kittridge tries to stop her from seeing the aged Jameson, saying only that he is gone. He is unable to keep her out of the room, but inside she discovers only an empty suit of clothes with a white substance near the collar and sleeves. When Susanna asks what is on the floor, the professor replies, \"Dust, only dust.\"\n\nThe scenes of Walter Jameson's aging was performed by using an old movie-making trick. Age lines were drawn on actor Kevin McCarthy's face in red make-up. During the beginning of the scene, red lighting was used, bathing the scene in red and hiding the age lines.

{"id": "14335296", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14335296", "title": "Necrophilia", "text": "Necrophilia\n\nNecrophilia, also known as necrophilism, necrolagnia, necrocoitus, necrochlesis, and thanatophilia, is a sexual attraction or sexual act involving corpses. It is classified as a paraphilia by ICD10 published by WHO and the \"Diagnostic and Statistical Manual\" (DSM) of the American Psychiatric Association.\n\nRosman and Resnick (1989) reviewed information from 34 cases of necrophilia describing the individuals' motivations for their behaviors: these individuals reported the desire to possess a non-resisting and non-rejecting partner (68%), reunions with a romantic partner (21%), sexual attraction to corpses (15%), comfort or overcoming feelings of isolation (15%), or seeking self-esteem by expressing power over a homicide victim (12%).\n\nThe term 'necrophilia' is thought to have been coined by Belgian physician Joseph Guislain in his \"Leçons Orales sur les Phrénopathies\", in a lecture given around 1850, in reference to contemporary necrophile François Bertrand: \n\nThe term was popularized about a decade later by psychiatrist Bénédict Morel, who also discussed Bertrand.\n\nIn the ancient world, sailors returning corpses to their home country were often accused of necrophilia. Singular accounts of necrophilia in history are sporadic, though written records suggest the practice was present within Ancient Egypt. Herodotus writes in \"The Histories\" that, to discourage intercourse with a corpse, ancient Egyptians left deceased beautiful women to decay for \"three or four days\" before giving them to the embalmers. Herodotus also alluded to suggestions that Greek tyrant Periander had defiled the corpse of his wife, employing a metaphor: \"Periander baked his bread in a cold oven.\" Acts of necrophilia are depicted on ceramics from the Moche culture, which reigned in northern Peru from the first to eighth century CE. A common theme in these artifacts is the masturbation of a male skeleton by a living woman. Hittite law from the 16th century BC through to the 13th century BC explicitly permitted sex with the dead. In what is now Northeast China, the ethnic Xianbei emperor Murong Xi (385–407) of the Later Yan state had intercourse with the corpse of his beloved empress Fu Xunying, after the latter was already cold and put into the coffin.\n\nIn Renaissance Italy, following the reputed moral collapse brought about by the Black Death and before the Roman Inquisition of the Counter-Reformation, the literature was replete with sexual references; these include necrophilia, in the case of the epic poem \"Orlando Innamorato\" by Matteo Maria Boiardo, first published in 1483. In a notorious modern example, American serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer was a necrophiliac. Dahmer wanted to create a sex slave that would mindlessly consent to whatever he wanted. When his attempts failed, and his male victim died, he would keep the corpse until it decomposed beyond recognition, continuously masturbating and performing sexual intercourse on the body. In order to be aroused, he had to murder his male victims before performing sexual intercourse with them.\nDahmer stated that he only killed his victims because they wanted to leave after having sex, and would be angry with him for drugging them. British serial killer Dennis Nilsen is also considered to have been a necrophiliac.\n\nIn the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fifth edition (DSM-5), recurrent, intense sexual interest in corpses can be diagnosed under Other Specified Paraphilic Disorder (necrophilia) when it causes marked distress or impairment in important areas of functioning. A ten-tier classification of necrophilia exists:\nAdditionally, criminologist Lee Mellor's typology of homicidal necrophiles consists of eight categories (A–H), and is based on the combination of two behavioral axes: destructive (offender mutilates the corpse for sexual reasons) – preservative (offender does not), and cold (offender used the corpse sexually two hours after death) – warm (offender used the corpse sexually earlier than two hours after death). This renders four categories (A-D) to which Mellor adds an additional four (E-H):\nDabblers have transitory opportunistic sexual relations with corpses, but this is not their preference. Category F homicidal necrophiles commit postmortem sex acts only while in a catathymic state. Exclusive mutilophiles derive pleasure purely from mutilating the corpse, while sexual cannibals and vampires are sexually aroused by eating human body parts. Category A, C, and F offenders may also cannibalize or drink the blood of their victims.\n\nNecrophilia is often assumed to be rare, but no data for its prevalence in the general population exists. Some necrophiles only fantasize about the act, without carrying it out. In 1958, Klaf and Brown commented that, although rarely described, necrophiliac fantasies may occur more often than is generally supposed.\n\nRosman and Resnick (1989) reviewed 122 cases of necrophilia. The sample was divided into genuine necrophiles, who had a persistent attraction to corpses, and pseudo-necrophiles, who acted out of opportunity, sadism, or transient interest. Of the total, 92% were male and 8% were female. 57% of the genuine necrophiles had occupational access to corpses, with morgue attendant, hospital orderly, and cemetery employee being the most common jobs. The researchers theorized that either of the following situations could be antecedents to necrophilia:\n\nThe authors reported that, of their sample of genuine necrophiles:\n\nIQ data was limited, but not abnormally low. About half of the sample had a personality disorder, and 11% of true necrophiles were psychotic. Rosman and Resnick concluded that their data challenged the conventional view of necrophiles as generally psychotic, mentally deficient, or unable to obtain a consenting partner.\n\nNecrophilia has been observed in mammals, birds, reptiles and frogs. In 1960, Robert Dickerman described necrophilia in ground squirrels, which he termed \"Davian behavior\" in reference to a limerick about a necrophiliac miner named Dave. The label is still used for necrophilia in animals. Certain species of arachnids and insects practice sexual cannibalism, in which the female cannibalizes her male mate prior to, during, or after copulation.\n\nKees Moeliker made one observation while he was sitting in his office at the Natural History Museum Rotterdam, when he heard the distinctive thud of a bird hitting the glass facade of the building. Upon inspection, he discovered a drake (male) mallard lying dead outside the building. Next to the downed bird there was a second drake mallard standing close by. As Moeliker observed the couple, the living drake pecked at the corpse of the dead one for a few minutes then mounted the corpse and began copulating with it. The act of necrophilia lasted for about 75 minutes, in which time, according to Moeliker, the living drake took two short breaks before resuming with copulating behavior. Moeliker surmised that at the time of the collision with the window the two mallards were engaged in a common pattern in duck behavior called \"attempted rape flight\". \"When one died the other one just went for it and didn't get any negative feedback — well, didn't get any feedback,\" according to Moeliker. Necrophilia had previously only been reported in heterosexual mallard pairs.\n\nIn a short paper known as \"Sexual Habits of the Adélie Penguin\", deemed too shocking for contemporary publication, George Murray Levick described \"little hooligan bands\" of penguins mating with dead females in the Cape Adare rookery, the largest group of Adélie penguins, in 1911 and 1912. This is nowadays ascribed to lack of experience of young penguins; a dead female, with eyes half-closed, closely resembles a compliant female. A gentoo penguin was observed attempting to have intercourse with a dead penguin in 1921.\n\nA male New Zealand sea lion was once observed attempting to copulate with a dead female New Zealand fur seal in the wild. The sea lion nudged the seal repeatedly, then mounted her and made several pelvic thrusts. Approximately ten minutes later, the sea lion became disturbed by the researcher's presence, dragged the corpse of the seal into the water and swam away while holding it. A male sea otter was observed holding a female sea otter underwater until she drowned, and then repeatedly copulating with her carcass. Several months later, the same sea otter was again observed copulating with the carcass of a different female. Copulation with a dead female pilot whale by a captive male pilot whale has been observed, and possible sexual behavior between two male humpback whales, one dead, has also been reported.\n\nIn 1983, a male rock dove was observed copulating with the corpse of a dove that had shortly before had its head crushed by a car. In 2001, a researcher laid out sand martin corpses to attract flocks of other sand martins. In each of six trials, 1-5 individuals from flocks of 50-500 were observed attempting to copulate with the dead sand martins. This occurred one to two months after the breeding season; since copulation outside the breeding season is uncommon among birds, the researcher speculated that the lack of resistance by the corpses stimulated the behavior. Charles Brown observed at least ten cliff swallows attempt to copulate with a road-killed cliff swallow in the space of 15 minutes. He commented, \"This isn't the first time I've seen cliff swallows do this; the bright orange rump sticking up seems to be all the stimulus these birds need.\" Necrophilia has also been reported in the European swallow, grey-backed sparrow-lark, Stark's lark, and the snow goose. A Norwegian television report showed a male hybrid between a black grouse and western capercaillie kill a male black grouse before attempting to copulate with it. In 2015, due to work done by the University of Washington, it was found that crows would commit necrophilia on dead crow corpses in about 4% of encounters with corpses.\n\nNecrophilia has been documented in various lizard species, including the giant ameiva, the leopard lizard, and \"Holbrookia maculata\". There are two reports of necrophilic behavior in the sleepy lizard (\"Tiliqua rugosa\"). In one, the partner of a male lizard got caught in fencing wire and died. The male continued to display courtship behavior towards his partner two days after her death. This lizard's necrophilia was believed to stem from its strong monogamous bond. In one study of black and white tegu lizards, two different males were observed attempting to court and copulate with a single female corpse on two consecutive days. On the first day, the corpse was freshly dead, but by the second day it was bloating and emitting a strong putrefying odor. The researcher attributed the behavior to sex pheromones still acting on the carcass.\n\nMale garter snakes often copulate with dead females. One case has been reported in the \"Bothrops jararaca\" snake with a dead South American rattlesnake. The prairie rattlesnake (\"Crotalus viridis\") and \"Helicops carinicaudus\" snake have both been seen attempting to mate with decapitated females, presumably attracted by still-active sex pheromones. Male crayfish sometimes copulate with dead crayfish of either sex, and in one observation even with a dead crayfish of a different species.\n\nIn frogs, it has been observed in the foothill yellow-legged frog, the yellow fire-bellied toad, the common frog, the Oregon spotted frog, \"Dendropsophus columbianus\", and \"Rhinella jimi\". The film \"\" shows a male toad copulating with a female toad that had been run over by a car. It goes on to do this for eight hours. Necrophilic amplexus in frogs may occur because males will mount any pliable object the size of an adult female. If the mounted object is a live frog not appropriate for mating, it will vibrate its body or vocalize a call to be released. Dead frogs cannot do this, so they may be held for hours. The Amazonian frog \"Rhinella proboscidea\" sometimes practices what has been termed \"functional necrophilia\": a male grasps the corpse of a dead female and squeezes it until oocytes are ejected, and then fertilizes them.\n\nAustralia\n\nNecrophilia is not explicitly mentioned in Australian law, however, under the Crimes Act 1900 - Sect 81C it states misconduct with regard to corpses is any person who:\n\n(a) indecently interferes with any dead human body, or\n\n(b) improperly interferes with, or offers any indignity to, any dead human body or human remains (whether buried or not),\n\nshall be liable to imprisonment for two years.\n\nArticle 212 of the Brazilian Penal Code (federal Decree-Law No 2.848) states as follows:\nArt. 212 - To abuse a cadaver or its ashes:<br>Penalty: detention, from 1 to 3 years, plus fine.\nAlthough sex with a corpse is not explicitly mentioned, a person who has sex with a corpse may be convicted of a crime under the above Article. The legal asset protected by such Article is not the corpse's objective honor, but the feeling of good memories, respect and veneration that living people keep about the deceased person: these persons are considered passive subjects of the corpse's violation.\n\nSection 297 of the Indian Penal Code entitled \"Trespassing on burial places, etc.\", states as follows:\n\nWhoever, with the intention of wounding the feelings of any person, or of insulting the religion of any person, or with the knowledge that the feelings of any person are likely to be wounded, or that the religion of any person is likely to be insulted thereby,\ncommits any trespass in any place of worship or on any place of sculpture, or any place set apart from the performance of funeral rites or as a depository for the remains of the dead, or offers any indignity to any human corpse, or causes disturbance to any persons assembled for the performance of funeral ceremonies, shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to one year, or with fine, or with both.\n\nAlthough sex with a corpse is not explicitly mentioned, a person who has sex with a corpse may be convicted under the above section. Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code could also be invoked.\n\nUnder Section 150 of the New Zealand Crimes Act 1961, it is an offence for there to be \"misconduct in respect to human remains\". Subsection (b) elaborates that this applies if someone \"improperly or indecently interferes with or offers indignity to any dead human body or human remains, whether buried or not\". This statute is therefore applicable to sex with corpses and carries a potential two-year prison sentence, although there is no case law as yet that would apply the aforementioned statute.\n\nSection 14 of the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences and Related Matters) Amendment Act, 2007 prohibits the commission of a sexual act with a corpse. Until codified by the act it was a common law offence.\n\nSection 16, § 10 of the Swedish Penal Code criminalizes necrophilia, but it is not explicitly mentioned. Necrophilia falls under the regulations against abusing a corpse or grave (\"brott mot griftefrid\"), which carries a maximum sentence of two years in prison. One person has been convicted of necrophilia. He was sentenced to psychiatric care for that and other crimes, including arson.\n\nSexual penetration of a corpse was made illegal under the Sexual Offences Act 2003, carrying a maximum sentence of two years' imprisonment. Prior to 2003, necrophilia was not illegal; however, exposing a naked corpse in public was classed as a public nuisance (\"R v. Clark [1883] 15 Cox 171\").\n\nThere is no federal legislation specifically barring sex with a corpse. Multiple states have their own laws:\n\n\n\n"}

He was owned by Adam Telfer, and was used as a working dog to herd sheep. His style was different from that commonly seen during his era, as he worked far more quietly than the other sheepdogs of the time. This style was adopted and used by other breeders and trainers and became the most common style among Border Collies within a few generations, with his descendants becoming successful international sheepdog champions.\n\nIn September 1893, Old Hemp was born to Adam Telfer's two dogs in West Woodburn, Northumberland. Hemp's mother, Meg, was a reticent and very strong-eyed black sheepdog; while Hemp's father, Roy, was a loose-eyed black, white, and tan sheepdog with a good natured temperament. Unlike many modern border collies, Hemp was a tri-colored dog with only a small amount of white fur on his trim.\n\nFirst following sheep at the age of six weeks, Hemp grew to have a great ability to herd. He moved sheep quietly unlike the louder sheepdogs of the era and was far more mild-mannered, although sometimes worked so intensely that he physically trembled; within a few generations his style had been adopted by almost all Border Collies, and became known as the Border Collie style.\n\nHemp never ceased to impress his owner Adam Telfer. Telfer once said, while talking about Hemp, \"he flashed like a meteor across the sheepdog horizon. There never was such an outstanding personality.\" With that, Telfer continued Hemp's legacy within his own breeding stock. Author and commentator Eric Halsall was also impressed by his skill. Halsall once said about Hemp, \"none who saw him ever forgot him...Almost faultless in work...he was born with such knowledge of his craft that he never required training and went to his work naturally.\"\n\nHemp is considered the foundation sire or \"father\" of the Border Collie breed. The International Sheepdog society began its stud book in 1915, with Old Hemp being the ninth entry, out of around 300,000. Old Hemp's ability to herd sheep was what attracted many dog handlers. Estimates place his offspring at more than 200, due to his stud services being widely sought after. His medium-sized stature and rough coat are commonly seen in the breed today as many of his offspring continued to keep many of his original traits.\n\nWhile it is not known if Hemp participated in any sheepdog trials, a dog from Telfer's own breeding stock, Sweep (a grandson of Hemp), won the International Sheep Dog Society's championship twice. Adam Telfer later bred and owned another dog named Hemp, a descendant of Old Hemp. The younger Hemp won the 1924 International Farmers Championship for sheepdogs. This was not the only victory in that competition by Old Hemp's descendants. Each of the twenty nine collies that won the championship between 1906 and 1951 were descendants from Old Hemp.\n\nA Facebook campaign was started in 2012 to install a memorial to Telfer and Old Hemp, in Old Hemp's birthplace of West Woodburn, Northumberland, and permission has been granted by the relevant authorities. The unveiling of which took place on September 8th 2015 and was attended by a large assembly of Border Collies and their respective owners.\n"}

Born in Vancouver, British Columbia, she grew up in the neighboring city of North Vancouver.\n\nWhen she was ten years old, her first published poem appeared in \"The Vancouver Sun\".\n\nIt wasn't until 1968 that she published her first collection, \"This Difficult Flowering\", with Very Stone House, a small Canadian poetry press. In 1972, \"The Age of the Bird\", a long poem inspired by revolutionary politics in South America, was published as a broadside by Blackfish Press. Its companion poem, \"Regard to Neruda\", was written for Pablo Neruda, one of Lowther's political and literary inspirations.\n\nShe was co-chair of the League of Canadian Poets, and the BC Arts Council. She taught at the University of British Columbia.\n\n\"Milk Stone\", published in 1974 by Borealis Press, became Lowther's breakthrough into Canadian mainstream literature. \"A Stone Diary\" was submitted to Oxford University Press in 1975.\n\nIn September 1975, Lowther was reported missing after failing to arrive for a scheduled poetry reading at Vancouver's Ironworkers Hall. Three weeks later, her body was found in a creek near Squamish, British Columbia. Her second husband Roy Lowther, whom she had married in 1963, was convicted of the murder in June 1977. He died in Matsqui prison in Abbotsford, British Columbia, on July 14, 1985.\n\nHer daughters are the poet Christine Lowther, Beth Lowther, and Kathy Lyons (d. 2015). Her son is Alan Domphousse.\n\nTwo years after the poet's murder, Oxford published \"A Stone Diary\". In 1980, a collection of Lowther's early and unpublished poems, \"Final Instructions\", was also published. Also that year, the League of Canadian Poets established the Pat Lowther Award, a prize awarded annually to a book of poetry by a Canadian woman.\n\nA manuscript was discovered in 1996 and published under the title \"Time Capsule\".\n\nLowther's life and death have served to inspire a number of works, including her daughter Christine Lowther's first poetry collection, \"New Power\" (1999), and the novels \"\" (1987) by Carol Shields and \"Furry Creek\" by Keith Harrison (1999).\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "554599", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=554599", "title": "Remedial action", "text": "Remedial action\n\nA remedial action is a change made to a nonconforming product or service to address the deficiency. This also can refer to restoration of a landscape from industrial activity\n\nRework and repair are generally the remedial actions taken on products, while services usually require additional services to be performed to ensure satisfaction.\n\nIn some settings, corrective action is used as an encompassing term that includes remedial actions, corrective actions and preventive actions.\n\n‘Remedial Action’ is a term referring to actions taken by businesses to counteract deficiencies or undesirable characteristics in their products. In this way it is distinct from ‘Corrective Action’, which aims to change the processes that led to these deficiencies, and ‘Preventive Action’, which aims to strengthen weak management systems not yet responsible for any deficiency \n\nRemedial Action is often enacted through ‘Remedial Action Plans’ (RAPs) of three or more stages. For example, one North American river protection scheme drew up a plan that identified environmental problems and sources of pollution, evaluated and carried out actions to restore the area, and confirmed that these actions had been effective \n\nThese actions normally have negative effects on a company’s image and profits. A fine balance is often struck between denying the existence of problems or wrongdoing and choosing to publicise this existence before being exposed removes the company’s ability to control the way any scandal is seen.\n\nEnvironmental - If the environment a business works in becomes polluted as the result of the activities of that business, or sometimes other events, this pollution must be cleaned for reasons of safety and welfare. This will normally involve the business either financing the remedial action or applying for the finances to do so. If the business is not at fault, the government may finance the remediation.\n\nRepair/Replacement - When a product is deemed ineffective, either by the company or by public exposure, a recall plan can be put into action, sometimes also involving compensation for consumers.\n\nPolicy - When company policy is considered to be in violation of the law, such as keeping inaccurate financial records, remedial action can be taken to change those policies. (HR.BLR.com, 2012). When done after an internal investigation, this can avoid repercussions such as negative publicity or even fines, and the UK Serious Fraud Office states that if a company self-reports corruption it will impact on whether or not prosecution occurs.\n\nBrodex Water - Environmental remedial action is often undertaken by water specialists in the case of infected supply. Some, such as UK Company Brodex Water Treatment Specialists, advertise what services the company provides in the event of Legionella disease being discovered in a local supply, such as tank chlorination and equipment replacement. This proactive strategy improves the company’s public image.\n\nThe Great Lakes - Since the mid-1980s, several ‘Remediative Action Plans’ have been drawn up to manage the impact of various stakeholders, including local businesses, on the environmental health of the American-Canadian Great Lakes region.\n\nVolkswagen - The most recent example, VW has recently been forced to recall millions of cars to adjust deficiencies in their pollution controls, after a company policy of only activating them during emissions tests was exposed.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "22286415", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=22286415", "title": "Resilience (organizational)", "text": "Resilience (organizational)\n\nOrganizational resilience is defined as \"the ability of a system to withstand changes in its environment and still function\". It is a capability that involves organizations either being able to endure the environmental changes without having to permanently adapt, or the organization is forced to adapt a new way of working that better suits the new environmental conditions.\n\nIn recent years, a new consensus of the concept of resilience emerged as a practical response to the decreasing lifespan of organisations and from the key stakeholders, including boards, governments, regulators, shareholders, staff, suppliers and customers to effectively address the issues of security, preparedness, risk, and survivability.\n\nAn organization that realizes the benefits of the above definitions of resilience will have a high likelihood of maintaining a successful and thriving enterprise.\n\nPreviously, it was considered that 'organisational resilience' could only be generated from processes and functions such as Risk Management, Business Continuity, IT Disaster Recovery, Crisis Management, Information Security, Operational continuity, Physical Security and so on. These are recognised as key contributors to operational resilience, and “the positive ability of a system or company to adapt itself to the consequences of a catastrophic failure caused by power outage, a fire, a bomb or similar” event or as \"the ability of a [system] to cope with change\". However, research from many academics including as Hamel & Valikangas in the Harvard Business Review, Boin, Comfort & Demchak and research facility ResOrgs has influenced understanding and lead to new viewpoints on resilience, including that from the BSI Group, being developed by ISO, the Australian government, ResOrgs, ICSA, and professional services firms such as PwC, all of which recognises that processes and functions are but one element of an organisation's resilience web.\n\nGlobal turbulence is expected. Competition, instability and uncertainty are constants in a changing world. Organizations face an unprecedented and growing number of potential disruptions to the status quo and the best laid strategic plans. As history repeats itself, prominent organizations will fail unless modern risk management and governance models incorporate scalable resilience metrics.\n\nTo survive and prosper in this new environment of heightened uncertainty and change, organizations must move past traditional risk and governance models and focus instead on resilience. Resilience applies at all levels: national, regional, organizational and corporate. At the national level, major infrastructure concerns and societal institutions must be robust enough, and unencumbered by legal and regulatory constraints, to serve the national good in normal operations, in crisis, and in recovery. At the regional levels, specific infrastructure assets come together in highly interdependent ways to serve local constituents and be a part of a national infrastructure. At the organizational and corporate level (which owns or operates the vast majority of our critical infrastructure assets), individual companies and operating units must ensure their business operations and service delivery capacities remain able to perform their primary business functions.\n\nYossi Sheffi extended the resilience concept to business continuity initiatives in his 2005 book \"The Resilient Enterprise\". Sheffi analyzed how disruptions can adversely affect the operations of corporations and how investments in resilience can give a business a competitive advantage over entities not prepared for various contingencies. Business organizations such as the Council on Competitiveness have embraced resilience and have tied economic competitiveness to security. The Reform Institute has highlighted the need to enhance the resilience of the supply chain and electrical grid against disruptions that could cripple the U.S. economy. Many corporations are adopting resilience and business continuity initiatives and sharing best practices.\n\nMany experts and leaders see resilience as a vital component to a homeland security strategy. Hurricane Katrina demonstrated that not all catastrophic events can be prevented and a focus on response and recovery is needed.\n\nProminent members in the United States Congress are embracing resilience. The Chairman of the Homeland Security Committee of the U.S. House of Representatives, Bennie Thompson (D-MS) declared May 2008 “Resilience Month” as the committee and its subcommittees held a series of hearings to examine the issue. President Obama and the Department of Homeland Security have also made resilience an integral component of homeland security policy.\n\nThe Quadrennial Homeland Security Review, released by the Department of Homeland Security in February 2010, made resilience a prominent theme and one of the core missions of the U.S. homeland security enterprise.\n\nBusiness and government enterprises that are able to quickly adapt to or seize competitive advantage from sudden and/or significant changes in their environments, with minimal interruption to their enterprise missions and manageable impact to their market value, as well as adapt to change in an apparently slower, more evolutionary manner - sometimes over many years or decades - can be described as being more resilient. Leading management consultancies and national governments including the Australia, U.S. Department of Homeland Security and the UK Cabinet Office believe that an organization’s resilience, properly understood, has critical implications for its competitive posture, profitability and shareholder value.\n\nOver the past years, business, academic and government leaders have become aware that certain organizations respond better to disruptions than other, often similarly situated, organizations. For example, a September 2003 Harvard Business Review article stated that “momentum is not the force it once was” in ensuring an organization’s success. They noted the emergence of several disruptive trends — including technological discontinuities, regulatory upheavals, geopolitical shocks, industry deverticalization and disintermediation, abrupt shifts in consumer tastes, and hordes of nontraditional competitors — that require companies to become resilient to remain successful. The authors concluded that “strategic resilience is not about responding to a one-time crisis. It’s not about rebounding from a setback. It’s about continuously anticipating and adjusting to deep, secular trends that can permanently impair the earning power of a core business. It’s about having the capacity to change before the case for change becomes desperately obvious.”\n\nResilience also has important implications for governance processes and systems. In a 2004 white paper the authors wrote that “enterprise resilience marries risk assessment, information reporting, and governance processes with strategic and business planning to create an enterprise-wide early warning capability that is embedded in the business of the company.” They explained that “Enterprise Resilience is predicated on an expanded view of risk—one that focuses on value, and therefore encompasses not only traditional risks (e.g., financial, natural hazards, physical security, legal, compliance) but also risks relating to earnings drivers (e.g., innovation, channel relationships, intellectual property) and company culture.”\n\nOver the past decade, governments worldwide have also become increasingly focused on protecting their facilities, technologies, networks, personnel and other mission-critical assets from attack or misappropriation. The risk of cyber-terrorism and other threats to critical infrastructure are of particular concern. On March 31, 2011, the President issued Presidential Policy Directive Eight (PPD-8) that directed the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security to develop a national preparedness system with the objective of strengthening the security and resilience of the United States through systematic preparation for the threats that pose the greatest risk to the security of the Nation, including acts of terrorism, cyber attacks, pandemics, and catastrophic natural disasters. The directive defined resilience as “the ability to adapt to changing conditions and withstand and rapidly recover from disruption due to emergencies.”\n\nSecurity, whether applied to physical, financial, personnel, cyber information or any other asset, entails the measures to protect against danger or loss with emphasis on being protected from dangers that originate from outside. A significant breach in security could certainly impair an organizations ability to exist, and thus is a critical concept underlying the organization’s capacity to be resilient. Resilience is proactive in positioning the company to survive and thrive given known and unknown challenges. Security, as generally practiced, provides specific protection against identified or projected circumstances.\n\nProtection is often associated with the set of actions to harden assets to withstand identified contingencies, mitigate the damage, or make them an unattractive target. The focus is to maintain the assets’ core function and ward off harm. Typically, protection performance objectives are stated as an absolute capability against varying levels of threat (category II or greater hurricane, defined types of breaches, specific acts). Organizations plan for protection against specific threats or categories of threats. Resilience approaches the issue from a standpoint of taking reasonable protective actions, but having alternative capabilities as needed or the ability to withstand the disruption.\n\nCrisis management generally refers to the set of actions and capabilities in place to effectively respond to and contain a situation. The situation can vary from natural, man-made, or environmental challenges, whether internally or externally generated. Most consider crisis management to largely consist of actions that go into play when the crisis occurs and subside after it is considered “over”. There are plans and preparations, but the actions are not often dealt with as part of normal operations. Resilience depends on effective crisis management, but would encourage more prominent treatment of crisis management capabilities throughout the company’s operation than is often the case.\n\nPreparedness consists of the plans of actions for when the disaster or crisis strikes. Preparedness efforts are very specific sets of tactical actions (evacuation plans, sheltering plans, rehearsals, stockpiles, etc.) that the company and individuals will take to mitigate the effects of predicted disasters/crises. Resilience requires prudent and serious attention to preparations for known likely disasters, particularly those that are highly likely (e.g., hurricanes in Florida). Resiliency would address preparedness as a specific emergency management business function; but more importantly, as being impacted by numerous functions across the organization. These may include human resources, strategic planning, financial management, information technology, and risk management.\n\nRisk management consists of formal processes to identify threats and vulnerabilities to the company, and the mitigation approaches it will employ. Risk management is highly sophisticated and the results have application in managing the business, insurance coverage, and in attracting investors. The risk management profession is moving toward a more proactive and return on investment focus, but the traditional focus has been defensive in nature. Identifying and managing risks, particularly operational risks, is arguably the most important factor in achieving resilience; however, it is one of many factors. Resiliency has a healthy consideration of posturing for future opportunities. That is not a traditional consideration in risk management.\n\nSome scholars have identified the four facets of resilience as preparedness, protection, response and recovery. Other countries, such as the United Kingdom and Australia, are adopting the resilience concept.\nIn the United Kingdom, resilience is implemented locally by the Local Resilience Forum.\n\nAs part of the Canterbury University Resilient Organisations programme, ResOrgs have developed a tool for benchmarking the Resilience of Organisations.\n\nThe Resilience Diagnostic is an assessment made up of 11 categories, each evaluated by a set of 5 to 7 questions. These categories are defined as either asset or liability. A person’s resilience is determined by the sum of all asset scores divided by the sum of all liability scores, producing a Resilience Ratio. The Resilience Ratio can be reflected both on an organizational and individual level and the assessment provides self-coaching options for participants. Developed in 2011 by The Resilience Institute, the Resilience Diagnostic has been used by corporations worldwide, with key insights reflected in the Global Resilience Report 2016. \n\nIn Organizational Studies, resilience is often referred to as the maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging conditions. Here, resilience emerges as the response to specific interruptions of the normal. Sutcliffe and Vogus argue that resilience should rather be viewed from a developmental perspective, as an ability that develops over time from continually handling risks. Resilience, then, is \"the continuing ability to use internal and external resources successfully to resolve new issues\". Thus, \"resilience is the capacity to rebound from adversity strengthened and more resourceful\".\n\nASIS International have developed and published the definitive Organizational Resilience Management Standard SPC.1-2009. Approved by ANSI and adopted by the Department of Homeland Security under the PS-Prep program, this American Standard provides a practical basis for implementation of preparedness objectives supported by ASIS ORMS (Organizational Resilience Management System) software.\n\n\n\n"}

Lewis (30 January 1826 – 23 February 1881) was an officer in the United States Navy. He participated in the Paraguay Expedition, fought in the Mexican War and American Civil War, and served briefly as commander of the Asiatic Squadron.\n\nLewis was born on 30 January 1826 in Washington, D.C.. He was appointed as a midshipman in October 1841 and immediately was attached to the sloop-of-war , which was fitting out at Norfolk Navy Yard in Portsmouth, Virginia, at the time. Before \"Warren\" could put to sea, however, Lewis was transferred to the receiving ship at the navy yard, remaining aboard her for a few months. In 1842, he was attached to the sloop-of-war , and served aboard her until 1845 off the coast of Africa and in the West Indies Squadron.\n\nLewis next reported to the sloop-of-war at Norfolk, Virginia, and served aboard her in the Pacific Squadron from 1845 to 1848. Aboard \"Cyane\", he took part in the Mexican War, seeing action in the capture of San Diego, California – then a part of Mexico – the destruction of a Mexican artillery battery at San Blas, the seizure of La Paz in Baja California, and the bombardment of Guaymas in Sonora, where \"Cyane\" cut out the Mexican brig \"Condor\" while under fire from Mexican troops and artillery ashore and burned the small Mexican fleet there. \"Cyane\" went on to clear the Gulf of California of Mexican ships over the course of the next month and participated in the capture of Mazatlán before relieving the siege by Mexican troops and Yaqui Indians of San José del Cabo. Upon \"Cyane\"s return to the United States at the conclusion of the war in 1848, United States Secretary of the Navy John Y. Mason congratulated her crew for their significant contribution to the American victory.\n\nAfter returning to the United States, Lewis reported to the United States Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland, in 1848 and passed his examination. Sources differ on the date of his promotion to passed midshipman, stating both that it came on 10 August 1847 while he was aboard \"Cyane\" and that it was in 1849 after he passed his examination at the Naval Academy.\n\nIn 1849, Lewis went aboard the steamer , aboard which he cruised in the West Indies and along the Spanish Main. In 1850, he transferred to the United States Naval Observatory in Washington, D.C., for a few months, then in 1851 detached to serve aboard commercial steamers of the Collins Line on two or three transatlantic voyages between New York City and Liverpool, England. In 1852 he began an 18-month tour aboard the sloop-of-war , in service at the time as a training ship at the Naval Academy, then reported to the brig , which was fitting out at the Norfolk Navy Yard at the time. Before \"Dolphin\" sailed, he transferred in 1853 to the stores ship , which was fitting out at the New York Navy Yard in Brooklyn, New York. During his two years aboard \"Supply\", he was promoted to master on 14 September 1855 and to lieutenant the following day, but he detached from \"Supply\" in 1855 before she embarked on the first of her two voyages to the Mediterranean to bring camels from the Ottoman Empire home to the United States for experimental use by the United States Armys Camel Corps.\n\nAfter a short leave period, Lewis was assigned to the receiving ship at Baltimore, Maryland, in 1856. He transferred to the new sailing frigate in 1858 and served aboard her during a three-year cruise, during which she took part in the Paraguay Expedition and operated in the West Indies.\n\nLewis was aboard \"Sabine\" when the American Civil War broke out in April 1861. He spent his last few months aboard \"Sabine\" on duty in the Union blockade of the Confederate States of America, serving in the blockade of Pensacola, Florida. He commanded a group of boats which carried reinforcements to Fort Pickens under threat from Confederate Fort McRae and was made executive officer of \"Sabine\". After \"Sabine\" was decommissioned at the Portsmouth Navy Yard in Kittery, Maine, later in 1861, Lewis took a leave of absence from the Navy, but returned to service later in the year as executive officer of the steamer in the West Gulf Blockading Squadron. He was promoted to lieutenant commander on 16 July 1862.\n\nIn 1862, Lewis became commanding officer of the gunboat on the Mississippi River, leading her in action at Man Shack Bend. \"Itasca\" later was reassigned to the blockade of Texas, where Lewis led her in an engagement with a Confederate artillery battery at Velasco, in the capture of two blockade runners, and in running aground and destroying two or three other blockade runners. After \"Itasca\" was ordered north to undergo repairs in 1863, Lewis was detached from her and took a short leave of absence.\n\nUpon returning to service, Lewis spent three months at Baltimore, Maryland, to oversee the repair and fitting out of ships there, then was sent to the South Atlantic Blockading Squadron in 1864, where he commanded successively the bark , the gunboat , the sidewheel steamer , and the monitor in the blockade of Charleston, South Carolina, and on the St. Johns River. He was in command of \"Nantucket\" when she closed to destroy a stranded blockade runner with gunfire off Charleston and engaged the Confederate artillery batteries on Sullivan's Island, as well as during later duty at Port Royal, South Carolina, when \"Nantucket\" guarded the receiving ship in case \"New Hampshire\" was targeted by the Confederate States Navy ironclad CSS \"Stonewall\". After the Civil War ended in April 1865, Lewis brought \"Nantucket\" to Philadelphia, where she was laid up.\n\nIn 1865, Lewis joined the staff of the Naval Academy, first as senior instructor in seamanship and later as superintendent of grounds and buildings, and was promoted to commander on 29 January 1867. From 1869 to 1871 he commanded the steamer in the Pacific Squadron, then was on the Board of Inspectors from 1871 to 1874. He served in the Asiatic Squadron from 1874 to 1875, first in command of the gunboat and then in command of the sloop-of-war , and he temporarily served as commander of the entire squadron from 24 June to 16 August 1875. Detaching from \"Kearsarge\" in November 1875, he returned to the United States and spent four months awaiting orders before reporting for duty as Inspector of Ordnance at the Norfolk Navy Yard. He was promoted to captain on 26 February 1878.\n\nOn 6 September 1879, Lewis took command of the screw sloop-of-war two days before she recommissioned for service in the South Atlantic Squadron as the flagship of Rear Admiral Andrew Bryson.\n\nLewis was married to Henrietta A. Lewis (31 March 1830 – 12 August 1915). They had five living children at the time of his death.\n\nLewis contracted an illness while aboard \"Shenandoah\" and became sick enough to be ordered to return to the United States for treatment. During the voyage home, he died at sea off Martinique on 23 February 1881. He is buried with his wife at the United States Naval Academy Cemetery in Annapolis, Maryland.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "313339", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=313339", "title": "Roy Halladay", "text": "Roy Halladay\n\nHarry Leroy Halladay III (May 14, 1977 – November 7, 2017), known commonly as Roy Halladay and often nicknamed \"Doc\", was an American professional baseball player who pitched in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Toronto Blue Jays and Philadelphia Phillies between 1998 and 2013. His nickname, coined by Toronto Blue Jays announcer Tom Cheek, was a reference to Wild West gunslinger Doc Holliday.\n\nHalladay was the Blue Jays' first draft selection in the 1995 MLB draft, the 17th pick overall, and played for the team from 1998 through 2009, after which he was traded to Philadelphia. Halladay was known for his ability to pitch deep into games effectively and, at the time of his retirement, was the active major league leader in complete games with 67, including 20 shutouts.\n\nOn May 29, 2010, Halladay pitched the 20th perfect game in MLB history, beating the Florida Marlins by a score of 1–0. On October 6, 2010, in his first postseason start, Halladay threw the second no-hitter in MLB postseason history (Don Larsen's perfect game in the 1956 World Series being the first) against the Cincinnati Reds in Game 1 of the 2010 NLDS.\n\nIt was his second no-hitter of the year (following the May 29 perfect game), making Halladay the fifth pitcher in major league history (and the first since Nolan Ryan in 1973) to throw multiple no-hitters in the same season. During the 2012 season, he became the 67th pitcher to record 2,000 strikeouts. Halladay was also one of six pitchers in MLB history to win the Cy Young Award in both the American and National Leagues.\n\nOn November 7, 2017, Halladay died when his ICON A5 amphibious plane crashed into the Gulf of Mexico off the coast of Florida. The Blue Jays organization posthumously retired his number 32 on March 29, 2018.\n\nBorn in Denver, Colorado, Halladay grew up in the suburb of Arvada; his father, Roy II, was a pilot for a food-processing company, while his mother, Linda, was a homemaker. From an early age, Halladay loved baseball, trying every position on the field until, by age 14, his success on the pitcher's mound attracted the attention of major league scouts. By the age of 13, he had begun training with Colorado baseball guru Bus Campbell, who had helped almost every promising pitcher from the Denver area, including Goose Gossage and Brad Lidge.\n\nIn 1995, after graduating from Arvada West High School, he was selected by the Toronto Blue Jays in the amateur draft, in the first round, as the 17th overall pick. Halladay decided to forego his college baseball commitment to Arizona and sign with Toronto. He was promoted to the major-league club as a September call-up in 1998.\n\nIn his second career start, against the Detroit Tigers on September 27, 1998, Halladay had what would have been the third no-hitter ever pitched on the final day of a regular season broken up with two outs in the ninth. The feat would have joined the combined no-hitter by four Oakland Athletics pitchers (Vida Blue, Glenn Abbott, Paul Lindblad, and Rollie Fingers) in 1975 and Mike Witt's perfect game in 1984. The bid was broken up by pinch hitter Bobby Higginson's solo home run, the only hit allowed in a Toronto victory, as he recorded his first major Prior to the home run, the sole base runner had reached on an infield error in the fifth inning, as Halladay struck out eight and \n\nDuring the 2000 season, Halladay sported a 10.64 earned run average (ERA) in 19 games, 13 of which he started, making his 2000 season the worst in history for any pitcher with at least fifty innings pitched. At the beginning of the 2001 season, Halladay was optioned to Class A Dunedin to rebuild his delivery.\n\nHalladay's fastball was clocked up to , but it had little movement, and his pitches were up in the strike zone, which was ultimately the reason why his 2000 season was so unsuccessful. He worked with former Blue Jays pitching coach Mel Queen. The problem, Queen realized, was Halladay's total reliance on his strength—his attempt to overpower batters with straight-ahead pitches. Within two weeks, Halladay had altered his arm angle for a more deceptive delivery, and added pitches that sank and careened. Instead of throwing over the top, he chose to use a three-quarters delivery (the middle point between throwing overhand and sidearm). Originally a fastball pitcher, he became reliant on keeping his pitches low across the plate, regardless of the type of pitch thrown. The adjustments proved successful. After a month and a half, he was promoted to Double-A Tennessee, and a month later, to Triple-A Syracuse. By mid-season, he was back in the Blue Jays' rotation. He posted a 5–3 win–loss record with a 3.19 ERA for the Blue Jays in 16 starts in 2001.\n\nIn 2001, after being demoted to the minor leagues, Halladay immersed himself in the works of sports psychologist Harvey Dorfman. This exposure was at least partly responsible for resurrecting his career. In 2002, Halladay had a breakout season, finishing with a 19–7 record, while posting a 2.93 ERA with 168 strikeouts in 239.1 innings. Halladay was named to the American League All-Star team.\n\nHalladay continued his success in the 2003 season, posting a 22–7 record with a 3.25 ERA in 266 innings. He also recorded 204 strikeouts and only 32 walks, good for a 6.38 strikeout-to-walk ratio. Halladay pitched the first extra-inning shutout in the major leagues since Jack Morris in Game 7 of the 1991 World Series, leading the Blue Jays to victory over the Tigers on September 6. He pitched 10 innings and had not allowed a hit until Kevin Witt doubled with two outs in the top of the eighth. Halladay won the American League Cy Young Award, while being once again named an All-Star and leading the Blue Jays to a surprising 86 victories. He was named by his peers as the \"Players Choice Awards\" AL Outstanding Pitcher. He was also named the \"Sporting News\" AL Pitcher of the Year and the \"Baseball Prospectus\" Internet Baseball Awards AL Cy Young Award winner.\n\nIn 2004, Halladay was placed on the disabled list twice due to right shoulder problems. In just 133.0 innings, he went 8–8 with a 4.20 ERA. He walked 39 batters, seven more than he had walked in 2003 when he had pitched twice as many innings. He later revealed that he had been injured throughout the entire season with a \"tired throwing arm\", which he believed was from intense workouts in preseason.\n\nThe 2005 season began successfully for Halladay, as he posted a 12–4 record with a 2.41 ERA in 19 starts. He was selected to his third All-Star team and was slated to be the starting pitcher for the American League at the All-Star Game in Detroit. However, on July 8, Halladay's leg was broken by a line drive off the bat of Texas Rangers left fielder Kevin Mench. As a result, he was replaced in the All-Star Game by Matt Clement of the Boston Red Sox, while Mark Buehrle of the Chicago White Sox was named the starting pitcher for the American League. Despite rehabilitation of his leg, Halladay would sit out the remainder of the season.\n\nOn March 16, 2006, Halladay signed a $40 million three-year contract extension through 2010. During that year, Halladay finished near the top of the MLB in wins with 16. He was named to the American League All-Star Team as a reserve on July 3, along with four of his Blue Jays teammates. It marked the second-most appearances in club history, and Halladay's fourth as an All-Star. Although Halladay's strikeout total was lower in 2006 than in previous seasons, his ground ball/fly ball ratio, complete games, and innings pitched were all among the American League leaders.\n\nHalladay was the American League pitcher of the month in April 2007, going 4–0, highlighted by a 10-inning complete game win over the Detroit Tigers. However, he pitched poorly in his two starts in May, and on May 11 was placed on the disabled list and underwent an appendectomy. He returned to the rotation in his usual form on May 31 against the Chicago White Sox. Halladay went 7 innings, giving up just six hits and allowing no runs on his way to his 100th career win. 2007 also saw Halladay hit his first career RBI. Against the Los Angeles Dodgers on June 10, his ground ball single to center field allowed John McDonald to score. He shut out the Seattle Mariners on July 22, allowing only three hits.\n\nIn 2008, for the sixth consecutive year, Halladay was Toronto's opening-day starter, improving his own club record. He lost 3–2 in a pitcher's duel with New York's Chien-Ming Wang. His first win of the season came in his next start against Boston, when he outpitched Josh Beckett in his season debut.\n\nIn his third start, Halladay pitched a complete game against the Texas Rangers, in a 4–1 win. Three of his nine complete game efforts resulted in losses due to Toronto's underachieving offense early in the season. In fact, those three complete game losses came in three consecutive starts. On June 20 against the Pittsburgh Pirates, he was struck in the temple by a line-drive off the bat of Nyjer Morgan. The ball caromed off Halladay's head and was caught by third baseman Scott Rolen, ending the inning. Halladay was able to walk back to the dugout, but was taken out of the game for safety concerns. Although he was given a clean bill of health for his next start, it was later suggested by television commentators that Halladay may have in fact suffered a temporary lapse in recognition of what happened on the play. Halladay pitched his 10th career shutout against the Seattle Mariners on June 30. He limited them to four hits in his sixth complete game of the season. The shutout tied him with the Cardinals' Mark Mulder for 10th among active pitchers. On July 11, 2008, Halladay pitched his 7th complete game and second shutout of the season against the New York Yankees, allowing 0 runs on 2 hits for his 38th career complete game. Halladay was named to the American League All-Star Team as a reserve. He pitched in the fourth inning, yielding only one hit and striking out Lance Berkman. In his last start of the season, he fittingly pitched a complete game against the Yankees to win his 20th game of the year. In so doing, he became the first pitcher to win five games against the Yankees in a single season since Luis Tiant in 1974. In addition, he led the AL with a 1.05 WHIP. Halladay finished second in the American League Cy Young Award voting, behind Cliff Lee of Cleveland. He also led the AL with 9 complete games, and struck out a career-high 206 batters (two more than his 2003 season) as well as posting a 2.78 ERA (the second-best of his career) that was second only to Cliff Lee's 2.54 ERA. Halladay also became just the fourth pitcher in major league history to post two seasons of 200 strikeouts and fewer than 40 walks. He was presented the George Gross/Toronto Sun Sportsperson of the Year award.\n\nOn April 6, 2009, Halladay made his team-record seventh straight Opening Day start for Toronto, defeating the Detroit Tigers. Halladay then also won his next two starts, on the road against Cleveland and Minnesota. Halladay lost his next game to Texas, giving up 5 earned runs over 8 innings only to go on and win his next 6 games to bring his record up to 8–1 with a 2.75 ERA. With season-ending injuries to planned 2009 Jays' starters Dustin McGowan and Shawn Marcum, and with #2 starter Jesse Litsch on the disabled list early in the season, Halladay led a staff of young, mostly inexperienced starters. Halladay was named the AL Player of the Week for the period ending May 17. Doc was 2–0 with a 1.13 ERA over 16.0 innings in his two starts the week prior. In a game against the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim on June 2, Halladay struck out 14 batters and threw 133 pitches, both career highs. On June 12, he left the game early because of a strained hip adductor muscle, commonly referred to as a \"pulled groin\", and was placed on the 15-day disabled list on June 17. On July 5, he was selected to represent Toronto at the All-Star Game. On July 14, he started the All-Star Game for the American League, pitching 2 innings and giving up 3 runs, of which 1 was unearned. That year, he was named #7 on the \"Sporting News\"'s list of the 50 greatest current players in baseball. A panel of 100 baseball people, many of them members of the Baseball Hall of Fame and winners of major baseball awards, was polled to arrive at the list.\n\nAs of the conclusion of his start on September 20, 2009, Halladay was tied for the second-longest streak in the American League that season with a 24-inning scoreless streak. Halladay finished the season with a 17–10 record, giving him a career win percentage of .660, good enough for 18th all-time. In December, \"Sports Illustrated\" named Halladay as one of the five pitchers in the starting rotation of its MLB All-Decade Team.\n\nOn December 15, 2009, the Blue Jays traded Halladay to the Philadelphia Phillies for minor league prospects Travis d'Arnaud, Kyle Drabek, and Michael Taylor. He agreed to a contract extension worth US$60 million that included a US$20 million vesting option for a fourth season. Phillies general manager Ruben Amaro, Jr. had unsuccessfully attempted to get Halladay at the non-waiver trade deadline in July 2009, then traded for Cliff Lee instead. Three hours before Halladay signed the contract extension, Amaro traded away Lee, to the surprise of Halladay who thought that Lee would be his teammate.\n\nOn Opening Day, Halladay pitched seven innings while giving up a run against the Washington Nationals in his first game with the Phillies. He had nine strikeouts and allowed six hits. He also drove in his second career RBI and earned his first win of the season. He followed this start with a complete game on April 11 against the Houston Astros, giving up one unearned run while striking out eight and not giving up any walks in the Phillies' 2–1 victory.\n\nHalladay pitched his first shutout in the National League, against the Atlanta Braves on April 21, becoming the first pitcher to reach four wins in the 2010 season. On May 1, Halladay pitched his second shutout of the season, limiting the New York Mets to three hits and striking out six.\n\nOn September 21, Halladay became the first Phillies pitcher to win 20 games in a season since Steve Carlton accomplished it in 1982. He was the first right-handed Phillies pitcher to accomplish the feat since Robin Roberts in 1955. One week later, on September 27, he completed his 21st victory, helping the Phillies clinch their fourth consecutive National League East title, and the Phillies finished with the best regular season record in MLB.\n\nHalladay made his first postseason start in Game One of the National League Division Series, as the Phillies squared off against the Cincinnati Reds. Halladay threw a no-hitter, giving up only one walk (to Jay Bruce in the fifth inning) in a 4–0 victory where he threw 104 pitches. Halladay's was only the second postseason no-hitter in Major League Baseball history, and the first since Don Larsen's perfect game in the 1956 World Series. Halladay become the first pitcher in Major League history to throw a perfect game and another no-hitter in the same season. \n\nThe Phillies swept the Reds in three games to advance to their third consecutive National League Championship Series, where they faced the San Francisco Giants. Halladay started Games One and Five, which were one of the most touted postseason pitching matchups in recent history as he faced another former Cy Young winner in both games, Tim Lincecum. Halladay lost Game One 4–3 and won Game Five 4–2, as the Phillies were eliminated in six games by the Giants, who went on to win the World Series.\n\nHalladay was named by his peers as the \"Players Choice Awards\" NL Outstanding Pitcher. He was also unanimously chosen as the recipient of the 2010 National League Cy Young Award, becoming the first Phillie to win the award since Steve Bedrosian in 1987 and only the fifth pitcher in MLB history to win the award in both leagues, joining Gaylord Perry, Pedro Martínez, Randy Johnson and Roger Clemens. He was likewise selected as the \"Sporting News\" NL Pitcher of the Year, the \"USA Today\" NL Cy Young, the \"Baseball Prospectus\" Internet Baseball Awards NL Cy Young, and the winner of the NLBM Wilbur \"Bullet\" Rogan Legacy Award (NL Pitcher of the Year). He also was named the MLB \"This Year in Baseball Awards\" Starting Pitcher of the Year. \"Baseball Digest\" named him its Pitcher of the Year (including both leagues). \"Baseball America\" named him its Major League Player of the Year (including all positions in both leagues). MLB named him its \"MLB Clutch Performer of the Year\". He was given the Heart & Hustle Award by the Major League Baseball Players Alumni Association. He was also named Pro Athlete of the Year by both the \"Sporting News\" and the Philadelphia Sports Writers Association and Sportsperson of the Year by the \"Philadelphia Daily News\". The Philadelphia chapter of the Baseball Writers' Association of America presented him the \"Steve Carlton Most Valuable Pitcher\" and \"Dallas Green Special Achievement\" awards.\n\nIn innings pitched, Halladay finished the 2010 regular season with a 21–10 record and a 2.44 ERA, setting a career high with 219 strikeouts while issuing just 30 walks. He led the National league in wins, innings pitched, and complete games (9), including 4 shutouts. He became just the seventh pitcher in the history of Major League baseball to pitch 250 or more innings with 30 or fewer walks, the first pitcher to do so since Grover Cleveland Alexander in 1923 with the Chicago Cubs.\n\nOn May 29, 2010, Halladay pitched the 20th perfect game in MLB history, against the Florida Marlins in Miami, retiring all 27 batters and striking out 11, allowing no hits, runs, walks, or errors. This was the first time in the modern era that two pitchers (Dallas Braden of the Oakland A's and Halladay) had thrown perfect games in the same month and that multiple perfect games had been achieved in the same season. When Halladay's former manager, Cito Gaston, called to congratulate him, Halladay was unable to take the call because he was busy with the post-game media frenzy.\n\nOn August 24, 2010, to commemorate his perfect game, Halladay presented around 60 Swiss-made Baume and Mercier watches he had purchased to everyone in the clubhouse. The watches were presented in brown boxes that bore the inscription: \"We did it together. Thanks, Roy Halladay.\" Additionally, the back of each watch was engraved with the date of the game, the line score, and the individual recipient's name.\n\nOn October 6, 2010, in his first postseason appearance, Halladay pitched a no-hitter (his second of the season), against the Cincinnati Reds in the first game of the National League Division Series (NLDS).\n\nHe became the second player ever to pitch a no-hitter in the postseason, joining Don Larsen of the 1956 New York Yankees, who pitched a perfect game in the World Series. He also became the first pitcher since Nolan Ryan in 1973 to throw two no-hitters in a season, as well as the seventh pitcher to hurl both a perfect game and a regular no-hitter in his career, joining Cy Young, Addie Joss, Jim Bunning, Sandy Koufax, Randy Johnson, and Mark Buehrle. Halladay allowed just one walk to right fielder Jay Bruce with two outs in the fifth inning, and faced just one batter above the minimum 27.\n\nThis also marked the first time in Major League history that a pitcher threw a perfect game and another no-hitter in the same season. The fans voted his no-hitter as the \"This Year in Baseball Awards\" Postseason Moment of the Year.\n\nFor the 2011 season, Halladay was joined by Cliff Lee, who before the 2010 season had been traded away from the Phillies shortly before Halladay joined. The resulting starting pitching lineup of Halladay, Lee, Cole Hamels, Roy Oswalt and Joe Blanton had commentators dub it one of the best rotations ever assembled. Halladay, Oswalt, Lee, and Hamels were dubbed the <nowiki>'</nowiki>\"Phantastic Phour\"<nowiki>'</nowiki> by fans and the media.\n\nOn April 24, 2011, Halladay struck out 14 and allowed just 5 hits in the game as his team swept the San Diego Padres in all four games. Halladay took a two-hitter into the ninth before allowing three straight singles. He allowed just one run and won, 3–1.\n\nIn May, Halladay was named the 2011 winner of the John Wanamaker Athletic Award, by the Philadelphia Sports Congress, based on his 2010 season. In June, Halladay was presented the Best Major League Baseball Player ESPY Award, for his performance since June 2010.\n\nOn July 12, Halladay was the NL starting pitcher in the All-Star Game. Halladay went 19–6 in 2011, with a 2.35 ERA, and pitched 8 complete games, second most in the Majors. The Phillies won their fifth consecutive National League East championship, and also finished with the best record in baseball for the second straight year.\n\nHalladay was named the starter for Games One and Five during the National League Division Series against the St. Louis Cardinals. He won Game One 11–6, but lost the Game Five 1–0, which was a duel with former Blue Jays teammate Chris Carpenter. This loss eliminated the Phillies from the playoffs, a disappointment as they were touted as heavy favorites for the World Series, and it would turn out to be Halladay's final postseason appearance. Reflecting on that series at his retirement, Halladay said \"I think the one thing I took away from that is you can have the best team on paper, you can have the guys who want it the most. But when the squirrel runs across home plate while your team is trying to pitch, there is nothing you can do about that.\"\n\nHalladay finished second in the NL Cy Young voting to Clayton Kershaw of the Los Angeles Dodgers. He was selected as one of the three starting pitchers on the \"MLB Insiders Club Magazine\" All-Postseason Team.\n\nIn December, Halladay was named the Sportsperson of the Year by the \"Philadelphia Daily News\" for the second consecutive year.\n\nOn April 5, 2012, Halladay threw 8 innings of shutout ball against the Pittsburgh Pirates on Opening Day, giving up 2 hits while striking out 5.\n\nOn May 29, Halladay was placed on the 15-day disabled list with a shoulder strain. It was his first DL stint since 2009. In a press conference on June 6, Halladay stated, \"Ultimately, my goal is to finish my career with the Phillies and win a World Series here. Some of those things are not fully in my control, but my intent is to play here and finish my career here and be here as long as I can.\" Halladay stated this during his press conference about his shoulder injury, and he revealed that he would sit out three more weeks, and then re-evaluate his condition. The injury would eventually be diagnosed as a strained latissimus dorsi and Halladay was hopeful he would be able to return shortly after the All-Star break in July.\n\nOn July 17, Halladay came off the DL and was the starting pitcher against the Los Angeles Dodgers. He pitched 5 innings, giving up 5 hits and 2 earned runs while fanning 6 in a no-decision which the Phillies would go on to win, 3–2.\n\nIn a loss against the Atlanta Braves on July 29, Halladay recorded his 2,000th strikeout to become the 67th pitcher in MLB history to reach the milestone.\n\nAlthough Halladay was on the DL and had the worst ERA since first starting off his career, he still remained above .500 going 11–8.\n\nAfter struggling in spring training, Halladay gave up five runs in his first start in the Phillies second game on April 3, 2013, striking out nine in 3 innings pitched. After struggling in his prior starts, Halladay pitched eight innings allowing just one run on April 14, 2013, against the Miami Marlins whom the Phillies defeated 2–1. Halladay recorded his 200th career win in the game.\n\nOn May 5, Halladay gave up nine earned runs in just 2 innings. The next day, Halladay was placed on the disabled list with a right shoulder injury. On May 8, it was announced that he would have surgery on his shoulder to have a bone spur removed. The surgery was also to address fraying of his labrum, and rotator cuff. Though he was initially supposed to be making a rehab start in Double-A for the Reading Fightin' Phils that day, an 18-inning game the previous night caused the Phillies to have a shortage of pitchers and as such, Halladay returned to the major leagues on August 25 for a start against the Arizona Diamondbacks in which he threw six innings, allowing two runs on four hits with two walks and two strikeouts.\n\nOn December 9, 2013, Halladay signed a ceremonial one-day contract with the Blue Jays and announced his retirement from baseball due to injury. At his press conference, Halladay listed a persistent back injury, as well as wanting to be more involved with his family, as his reasons for retiring. Although retired as a player, Halladay continued to be a part of the game as a guest instructor for the Philadelphia Phillies and Toronto Blue Jays. The Phillies hired Halladay as a \"mental skills coach\" in March 2017. Halladay also volunteered as a baseball coach at Calvary Christian High School in Clearwater, Florida where his oldest son played baseball.\nHalladay is eligible for election to the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum in 2019.\n\nHalladay's distinctiveness was characterized by his ability to throw a hard two-seam sinking fastball ranging in the low 90s with pinpoint control. In addition, he threw a four-seam fastball in the low 90s, a curveball in the high 70s, and cut fastball from 90–92 mph for which he had modified his grip in 2007 at the suggestion of former catcher Sal Fasano. Halladay threw the hardest cutter among MLB starters in the 2011 season, at an average of 91.4 mph. The changeup was one pitch that Halladay had problems commanding for many years, and which he used very rarely. However, after joining the Phillies in 2010, Halladay started throwing a change-up pitch that was really a version of the split-finger fastball (called a \"split-change\") that he used as a strikeout pitch. The pitch was introduced to Halladay by pitching coach Rich Dubee.\n\nDespite his reputation as a ground ball pitcher who worked at an efficient pace, Halladay's strikeout totals increased steadily in the few final years of his career. Halladay's efficiency and durability were reflected in his total innings pitched every year, also due to his ability to strike out hitters and induce ground ball outs to escape jams. He often led the league in innings pitched and complete games, while ranking among the leaders in WHIP and ERA.\n\nPrior to and during each start, Halladay had a distinct trademark in which he went into a complete \"isolation mode,\" immersing himself in complete concentration in order to plan every pitch he would pitch while on the mound. During this time, he would not talk to anyone except the manager or the pitching coach. He would not even reply to a \"hello\" or wave from a teammate or spectator, nor talk to the media until he had been relieved or had completed the game.\nHalladay had two children, Braden and Ryan, with his wife, Brandy (née Gates). During the offseason, Halladay lived with his family in Tarpon Springs, Florida. Halladay's oldest son, Braden, committed to play baseball at Penn State shortly after Halladay's death. Braden, who was born in Toronto, was invited to Baseball Canada's U18 spring training camp on March 6, 2018, and pitched a scoreless inning in the Canadian Junior team's exhibition game against the Blue Jays on March 17.\n\nWhile he was a member of the Toronto Blue Jays, Halladay and his wife invited children and their families from the Hospital for Sick Children into \"Doc's Box\" at Rogers Centre during Blue Jays games. The remodeling of the suite to be more kid-friendly was documented in an episode of \"Divine Design\". As part of Halladay's contract with the Blue Jays, he also donated $100,000 each year to the Jays Care Foundation.\n\nHalladay was the Blue Jays' nominee numerous times for the Roberto Clemente Award for his work with underprivileged children. For the same reason, he was also the Blue Jays' nominee in 2008 for the \"Players Choice Awards\" Marvin Miller Man of the Year Award.\n\nHalladay was the cover athlete for \"Major League Baseball 2K11\".\n\nOn November 7, 2017, Halladay died when the ICON A5 Founders Edition amphibious aircraft, which he was piloting, crashed into the Gulf of Mexico. The Pasco Sheriff's Office confirmed that Halladay was the only occupant of the aircraft at the time of the crash and that air traffic controllers had not received any mayday distress signals from the plane before the crash. The crash was reported to have happened about off the coast of New Port Richey, Florida in water deep.\n\nThe Pasco County, Florida Sheriff's Office Marine Unit responded to the accident after a call at noon, reporting a sport plane having crashed upside-down into shallow water. The plane was reported to be Halladay's, and he had tweeted four weeks earlier about his excitement about acquiring the plane, which was reportedly registered in the name of Halladay's father, a retired commercial pilot.\n\nIn late 2017, the Phillies announced that use of uniform number 34 would be suspended for the 2018 season to honor Halladay. On February 12, 2018 the Toronto Blue Jays announced they would retire Halladay's number 32 on Opening Day of the 2018 season.\n\nOn January 19, 2018, an autopsy revealed that Halladay had a significant amount of morphine and minor traces of alcohol, amphetamine, and Ambien in his body at the time of his death.\n\n\n, or Retrosheet, or Pelota Binaria (Venezuelan Winter League)\n"}

Salting, either with dry salt or brine, was a common method of preserving meat until the middle of the 20th century, becoming less popular after the advent of refrigeration. It was frequently called \"junk\" or \"salt horse\".\n\nSalt inhibits the growth of microorganisms by drawing water out of microbial cells through osmosis. Concentrations of salt up to 20% are required to kill most species of unwanted bacteria. Smoking, often used in the process of curing meat, adds chemicals to the surface of meat that reduce the concentration of salt required.\n\nSalted meat and fish are a staple of the diet in North Africa, Southern China, Scandinavia, coastal Russia, and in the Arctic. Salted meat was a staple of the mariner's diet in the Age of Sail. It was stored in barrels, and often had to last for months spent out of sight of land. The basic Royal Navy diet consisted of salted beef, salted pork, ship's biscuit, and oatmeal, supplemented with smaller quantities of peas, cheese and butter. Even in 1938, Eric Newby found the diet on the tall ship \"Moshulu\" to consist almost entirely of salted meat. \"Moshulu's\" lack of refrigeration left little choice as the ship made voyages which could exceed 100 days passage between ports.\n\n"}
{"id": "9986646", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9986646", "title": "Soliton model in neuroscience", "text": "Soliton model in neuroscience\n\nThe soliton hypothesis in neuroscience is a model that claims to explain how action potentials are initiated and conducted along axons based on a thermodynamic theory of nerve pulse propagation. It proposes that the signals travel along the cell's membrane in the form of certain kinds of solitary sound (or density) pulses that can be modeled as solitons. The model is proposed as an alternative to the Hodgkin–Huxley model in which action potentials: voltage-gated ion channels in the membrane open and allow sodium ions to enter the cell (inward current). The resulting decrease in membrane potential opens nearby voltage-gated sodium channels, thus propagating the action potential. The transmembrane potential is restored by delayed opening of potassium channels. Soliton hypothesis proponents assert that energy is mainly conserved during propagation except dissipation losses; however, measured temperature changes are also consistent with the Hodgkin-Huxley model.\n\nThe soliton model ( and sound waves in general) depends on adiabatic propagation in which the energy provided at the source of excitation is carried adiabatically through the medium, i.e. plasma membrane. The measurement of a temperature pulse and the claimed absence of heat release during an action potential were the basis of the proposal that nerve impulses are an adiabatic phenomenon much like sound waves. Synaptically evoked action potentials in the electric organ of the electric eel are associated with substantial positive (only) heat production. In the garfish olfactory nerve, the action potential is associated with a biphasic temperature change; however, there is a net production of heat. These published results are consistent with the Hodgkin-Huxley Model and the authors interpret their work in terms of that model: The initial sodium current releases heat as the membrane capacitance is discharged; heat is absorbed during recharge of the membrane capacitance as potassium ions move with their concentration gradient but against the membrane potential. This mechanism is called the \"Condenser Theory\". Additional heat may be generated by membrane configuration changes driven by the changes in membrane potential. An increase in entropy during depolarization would release heat; entropy increase during repolarization would absorb heat.\n\nIchiji Tasaki pioneered a thermodynamic approach to the phenomenon of nerve pulse propagation which identified several phenomena that were not included in the Hodgkin–Huxley model. Along with measuring various non electrical components of a nerve impulse, Tasaki investigated the physical chemistry of phase transitions in nerve fibers and its importance for nerve pulse propagation. Based on Tasaki's work, Konrad Kaufman proposed sound waves as a physical basis for nerve pulse propagation in an unpublished manuscript. The basic idea at the core of the soliton model is the balancing of intrinsic dispersion of the two dimensional sound waves in the membrane by nonlinear elastic properties near a phase transition. The initial impulse can acquire a stable shape under such circumstances, in general known as a solitary wave. Solitons are the simplest solution of the set of nonlinear wave equations governing such phenomenon and were applied to model nerve impulse in 2005 by Thomas Heimburg and Andrew D. Jackson, both at the Niels Bohr Institute of the University of Copenhagen. Heimburg heads the institute's Membrane Biophysics Group. The biological physics group of Matthias Schneider has studied propagation of two-dimensional sound waves in lipid interfaces and their possible role in biological signalling \n\nThe model starts with the observation that cell membranes always have a freezing point (the temperature below which the consistency changes from fluid to gel-like) only slightly below the organism's body temperature, and this allows for the propagation of solitons. An action potential traveling along a mixed nerve results in a slight increase in temperature followed by a decrease in temperature. Soliton model proponents claim that no net heat is released during the overall pulse and that the observed temperature changes are inconsistent with the Hodgkin-Huxley model. However, this is untrue: the Hodgkin Huxley model predicts a biphasic release and absorption of heat. In addition, the AP causes a slight local thickening of the membrane and a force acting outwards; this effect is not predicted by the Hodgkin–Huxley model but does not contradict it, either.\n\nThe soliton model attempts to explain the electrical currents associated with the action potential as follows: the traveling soliton locally changes density and thickness of the membrane, and since the membrane contains many charged and polar substances, this will result in an electrical effect, akin to piezoelectricity. Indeed, such nonlinear sound waves have now been shown to exist at lipid interfaces that show superficial similarity to action potentials (electro-opto-mechanical coupling, velocities, biphasic pulse shape, threshold for excitation etc.). Furthermore, the waves remain localized in the membrane and do not spread out in the surrounding due to an impedance mismatch. However these mechanical waves differ in fundamental ways from the properties described by the Hodgkin-Huxley Model in that they do not exhibit the very specific ionic selectivity, voltage sensitivity, time-course, or sensitivity to toxins that are integral to the Hodgkin-Huxley model.\n\nThe soliton representing the action potential of nerves is the solution of the partial differential equation\n\nwhere is time and is the position along the nerve axon. is the change in membrane density under the influence of the action potential, is the sound velocity of the nerve membrane, and describe the nature of the phase transition and thereby the nonlinearity of the elastic constants of the nerve membrane. The parameters , and are dictated by the thermodynamic properties of the nerve membrane and cannot be adjusted freely. They have to be determined experimentally. The parameter describes the frequency dependence of the sound velocity of the membrane (dispersion relation). The above equation does not contain any fit parameters. It is formally related to the Boussinesq approximation for solitons in water canals. The solutions of the above equation possess a limiting maximum amplitude and a minimum propagation velocity that is similar to the pulse velocity in myelinated nerves. Under restrictive assumptions, there exist periodic solutions that display hyperpolarization and refractory periods.\n\nAdvocates of the soliton model claim that it explains several aspects of the action potential, which are not explained by the Hodgkin–Huxley model. Since it is of thermodynamic nature it does not address the properties of single macromolecules like ion channel proteins on a molecular scale. It is rather assumed that their properties are implicitly contained in the macroscopic thermodynamic properties of the nerve membranes. The soliton model predicts membrane current fluctuations during the action potential. These currents are of similar appearance as those reported for ion channel proteins. They are thought to be caused by lipid membrane pores spontaneously generated by the thermal fluctuations. Such thermal fluctuations cannot explain the specific ionic selectivity or the specific time-course of the response to voltage changes.\n\nThe authors claim that their model explains the previously obscure mode of action of numerous anesthetics. The Meyer–Overton observation holds that the strength of a wide variety of chemically diverse anesthetics is proportional to their lipid solubility, suggesting that they do not act by binding to specific proteins such as ion channels but instead by dissolving in and changing the properties of the lipid membrane. Dissolving substances in the membrane lowers the membrane's freezing point, and the resulting larger difference between body temperature and freezing point inhibits the propagation of solitons. By increasing pressure, lowering pH or lowering temperature, this difference can be restored back to normal, which should cancel the action of anesthetics: this is indeed observed. The amount of pressure needed to cancel the action of an anesthetic of a given lipid solubility can be computed from the soliton model and agrees reasonably well with experimental observations.\n\nThe following is a list of some of the disagreements between experimental observations and the \"Soliton model\":\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA recent theoretical model, proposed by Ahmed El Hady and Benjamin Machta, proposes that there is a mechanical surface wave which co-propagates with the electrical action potential. These surface waves are called \"action waves\". In the El Hady–Machta's model, these co-propagating waves are driven by voltage changes across the membrane caused by the action potential.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "226748", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=226748", "title": "Stillbirth", "text": "Stillbirth\n\nStillbirth is typically defined as fetal death at or after 20 to 28 weeks of pregnancy (depending on the source). It results in a baby born without signs of life. A stillbirth can result in the feeling of guilt in the mother. The term is in contrast to miscarriage which is an early pregnancy loss and live birth where the baby is born alive, even if it dies shortly after.\nOften the cause is unknown. Causes may include pregnancy complications such as pre-eclampsia and birth complications, problems with the placenta or umbilical cord, birth defects, infections such as malaria and syphilis, and poor health in the mother. Risk factors include a mother's age over 35, smoking, drug use, use of assisted reproductive technology, and first pregnancy. Stillbirth may be suspected when no fetal movement is felt. Confirmation is by ultrasound.\nWorldwide prevention of most stillbirths is possible with improved health systems. About half of stillbirths occur during childbirth, with this being more common in the developing than developed world. Otherwise depending on how far along the pregnancy is, medications may be used to start labor or a type of surgery known as dilation and evacuation may be carried out. Following a stillbirth, women are at higher risk of another one; however, most subsequent pregnancies do not have similar problems. Depression, financial loss, and family breakdown are known complications.\nWorldwide in 2015 there were about 2.6 million stillbirths that occurred after 28 weeks of pregnancy (about 1 for every 45 births). They occur most commonly in the developing world, particularly South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa. In the United States for every 167 births there is one stillbirth.\nThere is, as of 2016, no international classification system for stillbirth causes. The causes of a large percentage of stillbirths is unknown, even in cases where extensive testing and autopsy have been performed. A rarely used term to describe these is \"sudden antenatal death syndrome\" or SADS, a phrase coined in 2000. Many stillbirths occur at full term to apparently healthy mothers, and a postmortem evaluation reveals a cause of death in about 40% of autopsied cases.\n\nAbout 10% of cases are believed to be due to obesity, high blood pressure, or diabetes.\n\nOther risk factors include:\n\n\nA mother sleeping on her back after 28 weeks of pregnancy may be a risk factor for stillbirth.\n\nAfter a stillbirth there is a 2.5% risk of another stillbirth in the next pregnancy (an increase from 0.4%).\n\nIt is unknown how much time is needed for a fetus to die. Fetal behavior is consistent and a change in the fetus' movements or sleep-wake cycles can indicate fetal distress. A decrease or cessation in sensations of fetal activity may be an indication of fetal distress or death, though it is not entirely uncommon for a healthy fetus to exhibit such changes, particularly near the end of a pregnancy when there is considerably less space in the uterus than earlier in pregnancy for the fetus to move about. Still, medical examination, including a nonstress test, is recommended in the event of any type of any change in the strength or frequency of fetal movement, especially a complete cease; most midwives and obstetricians recommend the use of a kick chart to assist in detecting any changes. Fetal distress or death can be confirmed or ruled out via fetoscopy/doptone, ultrasound, and/or electronic fetal monitoring. If the fetus is alive but inactive, extra attention will be given to the placenta and umbilical cord during ultrasound examination to ensure that there is no compromise of oxygen and nutrient delivery.\n\nSome researchers have tried to develop models to identify early on pregnant women who may be at high risk of having a stillbirth.\nThere are a number of definitions for stillbirth. To allow comparison, the World Health Organization recommends that any baby born without signs of life at greater than or equal to 28 completed weeks' gestation be classified as a stillbirth. Others use greater than any combination of 16, 20, 22, 24, or 28 weeks gestational age or 350 g, 400 g, 500 g, or 1000 g birth weight may be considered stillborn.\n\nThe term is often used in distinction to live birth (the baby was born alive, even if it died shortly thereafter) or miscarriage (early pregnancy loss). The word miscarriage is often used incorrectly to describe stillbirths. The term is mostly used in a human context, however the same phenomenon can occur in all species of placental mammals.\n\nWhen the umbilical cord is constricted (q.v. \"accidents\" above), the fetus experiences periods of hypoxia, and may respond by unusually high periods of kicking or struggling, to free the umbilical cord. These are sporadic if constriction is due to a change in the fetus' or mother's position, and may become worse or more frequent as the fetus grows. Extra attention should be given if mothers experience large increases in kicking from previous childbirths, especially when increases correspond to position changes.\n\nRegulating high blood pressure, diabetes and drug use may reduce the risk of a stillbirth. Umbilical cord constriction may be identified and observed by ultrasound, if requested.\n\nSome maternal factors are associated with stillbirth, including being age 35 or older, having diabetes, having a history of addiction to illegal drugs, being overweight or obese, and smoking cigarettes in the three months before getting pregnant.\n\nFetal death \"in utero\" does not present an immediate health risk to the woman, and labour will usually begin spontaneously after two weeks, so the woman may choose to wait and bear the fetal remains vaginally. After two weeks, the woman is at risk of developing blood clotting problems, and labor induction is recommended at this point. In many cases, the woman will find the idea of carrying the dead fetus traumatizing and will elect to have labor induced. Caesarean birth is not recommended unless complications develop during vaginal birth. How the diagnosis of stillbirth is communicated by healthcare workers may have a long-lasting and deep impact on parents. Women need to heal physically after a stillbirth just as they do emotionally. They will go through the healing process afterwards just as they would after a normal healthy birth.\n\nThe average stillbirth rate in the United States is approximately 1 in 160 births, which is roughly 26,000 stillbirths each year. In Australia, England, Wales, and Northern Ireland, the rate is approximately 1 in every 200 births; in Scotland, 1 in 167. Rates of stillbirth in the United States have decreased by about 2/3 since the 1950s.\n\nThe vast majority of stillbirths worldwide (98%) happen in low and middle-income countries, where medical care can be of low quality or unavailable. Reliable estimates calculate that yearly about 2.6 million stillbirths occur worldwide during the third trimester. Stillbirths were previously not included in the Global Burden of Disease Study that records worldwide deaths from various causes until 2015.\n\nThe way people view stillbirths has changed dramatically over time, however its economic and psychosocial impact is often underestimated. In the early 20th century, when a stillbirth occurred, the baby was taken and discarded and the parents were expected to immediately let go of the attachment and try for another baby. In many countries parents are expected by friends and family members to recover from the loss of an unborn baby very soon after it happens. Societally-mediated complications such as financial hardship and depression are among the more common results. A stillbirth can have significant psychological effects on the parents, notably causing feelings of guilt in the mother.\n\nIn Australia any stillborn weighing more than 400 grams, or more than 20 weeks in gestation, must have its birth registered.\n\nIn Austria a stillbirth is defined as birth of a child of at least 500 g weight without vital signs, e.g. blood circulation, breath or muscle movements.\n\nBeginning in 1959, \"the definition of a stillbirth was revised to conform, in substance, to the definition of fetal death recommended by the World Health Organization.\" The definition of \"fetal death\" promulgated by the World Health Organization in 1950 is as follows:\n\nIn Germany a stillbirth is defined as birth of a child of at least 500 g weight without blood circulation or breath. Details for burial vary amongst the federal states.\n\nSince 1 Jan 1995 stillbirths occurring in the Republic of Ireland must be registered; stillbirths which occurred before that date can also be registered but evidence is required. For the purposes of civil registration, s.1 of the Stillbirths Registration Act 1994 refers to :-\n\n\"...a child weighing at least 500 grammes, or having reached a gestational age of at least 24 weeks who shows no signs of life.\"\n\nIn the Netherlands, stillbirth is defined differently by the central bureau of statistics (CBS) and the Dutch perinatal registry (Stichting PRN). The birth and mortality numbers from the CBS include all liveborn children, regardless of gestational duration and all stillbirths from 24 weeks of gestation and onwards. In the Perinatal Registry, gestational duration of both liveborn and stillborn children is available. They register all liveborn and stillborn children from 22, 24 or 28 weeks of gestation and onwards (dependent on the report: fetal, neonatal or perinatal mortality). Therefore, data from these institutions on (still)births can not simply be compared one-on-one.\n\nThe registration of still-births has been required in England and Wales from 1927, in Scotland from 1939 but is not required in Northern Ireland. Sometimes a pregnancy is terminated deliberately during a late phase, for example for congenital anomaly. UK law requires these procedures to be registered as \"stillbirths\".\n\nFor the purposes of the Births and Deaths Registration Act 1926 (as amended), section 12 contains the definition that :-\n\n\"\"still-born\" and \"still-birth\" shall apply to any child which has issued forth from its mother after the twenty fourth week of pregnancy and which did not at any time after being completely expelled from its mother, breathe or show any other signs of life.\"\n\nA similar definition is applied within the Births and Deaths Registration Act 1953 (as amended), contained in s.41.\n\nThe above definitions apply within those Acts thus other legislation will not necessarily be in identical terms.\n\ns.2 of the 1953 Act requires that registration of a birth takes place within 42 days of the birth except where an inquest takes place or the child has been \"found exposed\" in which latter case the time limit runs from the time of finding.\n\nExtracts from the register of still-births are restricted to those who have obtained consent from the Registrar General for England and Wales.\n\nSection 56(1) of the Registration of Births, Deaths and Marriages (Scotland) Act 1965 (as amended) contains the definition that :-\n\n\"\"still-born child\" means a child which has issued forth from its mother after the twenty-fourth week of pregnancy and which did not at any time after being completely expelled from its mother breathe or show any other signs of life, and the expression \"still-birth\" shall be construed accordingly\"\n\ns.21(1) of the same Act requires that :-\n\n\"Except so far as otherwise provided by this section or as may be prescribed, the provisions of this Part of this Act shall, so far as applicable, apply to still-births in like manner as they apply to births of children born alive.\"\n\nIn the general case, s.14 of the Act requires that a birth has to be registered within 21 days of the birth or of the child being found.\n\nUnlike the registers for births, marriages, civil partnerships and deaths, the register of still-births is not open to public access and issue of extracts requires the permission of the Registrar General for Scotland.\n\nIn Northern Ireland the Births and Deaths Registration (Northern Ireland) Order 1976, as amended contains the definition :-\n\n\" \"still-birth\" means the complete expulsion or extraction from its mother after the twenty-fourth week of pregnancy of a child which did not at any time after being completely expelled or extracted breathe or show any other evidence of life.\"\n\nRegistration of still-births can be made by a relative or certain other persons involved with the still-birth but it is not compulsory to do so. Registration takes place with the District Registrar for the Registration District where the still-birth occurred or for the District in which the mother is resident. A still-birth certificate will be issued to the registrant with further copies only available to those obtaining official consent for their issue. Registration may be made within three months of the still-birth\n\nIn the United States, there is no standard definition of the term 'stillbirth'.\n\nIn the U.S., the Born-Alive Infants Protection Act of 2002 specifies that any breathing, heartbeat, pulsating umbilical cord, or confirmed voluntary muscle movement indicate live birth rather than stillbirth.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention collects statistical information on \"live births, fetal deaths, and induced termination of pregnancy\" from 57 reporting areas in the United States. Each reporting area has different guidelines and definitions for what is being reported; many do not use the term \"stillbirth\" at all. The federal guidelines suggest (at page 1) that fetal death and stillbirth can be interchangeable terms. The CDC definition of \"fetal death\" is based on the definition promulgated by the World Health Organization in 1950 (see section above on Canada). Researchers are learning more about the long term psychiatric sequelae of traumatic birth and believe the effects may be intergenerational\n\nThe federal guidelines recommend reporting those fetal deaths whose birth weight is over 12.5 oz (350 g), or those more than 20 weeks gestation. Forty-one areas use a definition very similar to the federal definition, thirteen areas use a shortened definition of fetal death, and three areas have no formal definition of fetal death. Only 11 areas specifically use the term 'stillbirth', often synonymously with late fetal death, however they are split between whether stillbirths are \"irrespective of the duration of pregnancy\", or whether some age or weight constraint is applied. A movement in the U.S. has changed the way that stillbirths are documented through vital records. Previously, only the deaths were reported. However 27 states have enacted legislation that offers some variation of a birth certificate as an option for parents who choose to pay for one. Parents may not claim a tax exemption for stillborn infants, even if a birth certificate is offered. To claim an exemption, the birth must be certified as live, even if the infant only lives for a very brief period.\n\n\n"}

The film is based on the 2005 novel of the same name by Markus Zusak and adapted by Michael Petroni. The film is about a young girl living with her adoptive German family during the Nazi era. Taught to read by her kind-hearted foster father, the girl begins \"borrowing\" books and sharing them with the Jewish refugee being sheltered by her foster parents in their home. The film features a musical score by Oscar-winning composer John Williams.\n\n\"The Book Thief\" premiered at the Mill Valley Film Festival on October 3, 2013, and was released for general distribution in the United States on November 8, 2013. The film received mixed reviews upon its theatrical release with some reviewers praising its \"fresher perspective on the war\" and its focus on the \"consistent thread of humanity\" in the story, with other critics faulting the film's \"wishful narrative\". With a budget of $19 million, the film was successful at the box office, earning over $76 million.\n\n\"The Book Thief\" received Academy Award, Golden Globe and BAFTA nominations for its score.

The film was released on Blu-ray and DVD on March 11, 2014.\n\nIn February 1938, a voice representing Death tells about how the young Liesel Meminger has piqued his interest. In one of the opening scenes, Liesel is traveling with her mother and younger brother on a train. On the way, her brother dies and is buried next to the tracks. Liesel steals her first book, titled \"The Grave Digger's Handbook\", when it falls out of the gravedigger's pocket. Liesel is then brought to her new home in Munich, where she meets her new foster parents Rosa Hubermann and Hans Hubermann. Rudy Steiner, a boy who lives next door, accompanies her on her first day of school. When the teacher asks Liesel to write her name on the chalkboard, she is only able to write three Xs, revealing to her classmates that she is unable to write. She is taunted by her schoolmates who chant \"dummkopf\" (\"dunce\") at her. One of the boys, Franz Deutscher, challenges her to read just one word to which Liesel responds by beating him up. She impresses Rudy, and they become fast friends. When Hans, her foster father, realizes that Liesel cannot read, he begins to teach her, using the book that she took from the graveside, and a giant chalkboard. Liesel becomes captivated with reading anything she can.\n\nLiesel and Rudy become members of the Hitler Youth movement. While at a Nazi book burning ceremony, Liesel and Rudy are harassed into throwing books onto the bonfire by Franz, but Liesel is upset to see the books being burned. When the bonfire ends and everyone leaves, Liesel is still there and she grabs a book that has been only singed. She is seen by Ilsa Hermann, wife of the burgermeister (mayor). When Rosa asks Liesel to take the laundry to the mayor's spacious, gated house, she realizes that the woman who saw her taking the book is the mayor's wife. Instead, Ilsa takes her into their library and tells Liesel she can come by anytime and read as much as she'd like. One day Liesel is found reading by the mayor who not only puts a stop to her visits but dismisses Rosa as their laundress.\n\nDuring Kristallnacht, Max Vandenburg and his mother, who are Jewish, are told by a friend that only one of them can escape, and Max's mother forces him to go. Max's father had saved Hans' life in World War I, and hence he goes to the Hubermanns' house where Rosa and Hans give him shelter. Max initially stays in Liesel's room while recovering from his trip, and they begin to become friends over their mutual hatred of Hitler. World War II begins, initially making most of the children in Liesel's neighborhood very happy. Max is moved to the basement so that he can move around more, but it is cold and Max becomes dangerously ill. Liesel helps Max recover by reading to him books \"borrowed\" from the mayor's library with every spare moment.\n\nOne day while \"borrowing\" a book from the mayor's home, Liesel is followed by Rudy. He discovers the secret of Max, whose name he reads on a journal Max gave to Liesel for Christmas. Rudy guesses that her family is hiding someone, and he swears to never tell anyone. Franz overhears Rudy's last words of keeping it a secret and violently pushes Rudy to reveal the secret. Rudy throws the journal into the river to keep it away from Franz. After Franz leaves, Rudy plunges into the icy river to rescue the journal, and Liesel realizes that she can truly trust him. Soon, a local party member comes by to check the Hubermanns' basement, and they have to hide Max.\n\nWhile working, Hans sees a neighbor and friend named Lehman being taken away by the police because he is a Jew. Hans tries to intervene, telling the officer that Lehman is a good man, but Hans's name is taken by the soldiers and he is thrown to the ground. Hans realizes what a mistake he has made, since this has made his family visible. He tells the family, and Max realises he must leave in order to protect them. Hans then receives a telegram that he has been conscripted into the army and must leave immediately.\n\nOn the way home from school, Liesel believes she has seen Max in a line of Jews being forcibly marched through town, and she begins screaming his name, running through the line. She is thrown to the sidewalk twice by German soldiers and finally gives up when Rosa picks her up and takes her home.\n\nHans returns home after being injured, and the family is reunited only for a short time. One night the city is bombed by accident, and the air raid sirens fail to go off. Hans, Rosa, and Rudy's family are killed in the blast. Liesel was spared from the bombing because she fell asleep in the basement while writing in the journal given to her by Max. She sees her foster family on the ground, dead, she cries and hugs them. Neighbors bring Rudy out of his house, barely alive. He begins to tell Liesel that he loves her, but he dies before he can finish the sentence. During this scene, Death is heard speaking again about how he received the souls of the dead. Liesel passes out, and one of the soldiers carries her to a stretcher. When she wakes up, she sees a book among the rubble and picks it up. She then sees the mayor and Ilsa drive up. With Ilsa being the only friend she has left, Liesel runs up to her and hugs her.\n\nTwo years later, after Germany has fallen to the Allies, Liesel is working in the tailor shop owned by Rudy's father. Max enters. Overjoyed by his survival and return, she runs to hug him. The final scene is Death speaking again about Liesel's life and her death at the age of 90, mentioning her husband, children, and grandchildren, as we look over her modern day Manhattan Upper East Side apartment with pictures of her past and a portrait of her, upon which the camera lingers. The narrator does not state whom she married but implies that she became a writer.\n\n\n\nA search for an actress to play the eponymous book thief, Liesel Meminger, occurred across the world. On February 4, 2013, it was announced that Canadian actress Sophie Nélisse was cast in the role and that Australian actor Geoffrey Rush and English actress Emily Watson would be playing Meminger's foster parents.\n\nPrincipal photography began in early March 2013 at Babelsberg Studio in Potsdam-Babelsberg, Germany. The first trailer was released on August 21, with the Bastille song \"Haunt\" as the music.\n\nMarkus Zusak, Australian author of the best-selling, award-winning book on which the film is based, confirmed on his blog that the film would be narrated by the character of \"Death\", as was the novel. After some speculation that Death might be voiced by the anonymous American actor who was used in the official trailer, it was announced that English actor Roger Allam of \"Game of Thrones\" would portray Death in the film.\n\nThe music for the film was composed by John Williams, and the soundtrack album containing the score was released by Sony Classical. The album was released in the United States on November 19, 2013. It was nominated for an Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe for Best Original Score. It won Best Instrumental Album at the 57th Grammy Awards.\n\n\"The Book Thief\" marked the first time since 2005 that Williams had scored a film not directed by Steven Spielberg.\n\nOriginally scheduled for January 17, 2014, \"The Book Thief\"s limited theatrical release was moved forward to November 8, 2013, due to the fact that it was finished ahead of schedule and in order to compete in the 2013–14 award season. It premiered at the Mill Valley Film Festival on October 3, 2013, and was screened at the Savannah Film Festival on October 29, 2013. It expanded to a wide release on November 27, 2013.\n\n\"The Book Thief\" received mixed reviews from critics. Review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a score of 46%, based on 134 reviews, with an average score of 5.6/10. The site's consensus states, \"A bit too safe in its handling of its Nazi Germany setting, \"The Book Thief\" counters its constraints with a respectful tone and strong performances.\" On Metacritic, the film has a score of 53 out of 100, based on 31 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".\n\nIn her review for the \"New Empress Magazine\", Mairéad Roche praised the film for providing a \"fresher perspective on the war\" through the experiences of ordinary Germans who lived through the Nazi era. In addition to the \"Oscar-baiting beautiful\" cinematography and John Williams's film score that contribute to the film's emotional appeal, Roche singled out the performance of young Sophie Nélisse as Liesel that \"matches the well-measured and seemingly effortless efforts of both Rush and Watson\". Roche concluded,\nIn his review following the Mill Valley Film Festival, Dennis Harvey at \"Variety\" magazine wrote, \"Rush generously provides the movie's primary warmth and humor; Watson is pitch-perfect as a seemingly humorless scold with a well-buried soft side.\" Harvey also praised the film's cinematography and film score, noting that \"impeccable design contributions are highlighted by Florian Ballhaus'[s] somber but handsome widescreen lensing and an excellent score by John Williams that reps his first feature work for a director other than Steven Spielberg in years.\"\n\nIn her review for \"MSN UK\", Emma Roberts gave the film 5 out of 5 stars, stating,\nStephanie Merry of \"The Washington Post\" was less impressed with the film, giving it two and half out of four stars. Merry felt that the film \"has its moments of brilliance, thanks in large part to an adept cast\" but that the film ultimately shows the difficulties of bringing a successful novel to the screen. In his review for the \"Los Angeles Times\", Robert Abele was also unimpressed, describing the film as \"just another tasteful, staid Hollywoodization of terribleness, in which a catastrophic time acts as a convenient backdrop for a wishful narrative rather than the springboard for an honest one\".\n\n\"The Book Thief\" was released on Blu-ray and DVD on March 11, 2014.\n\n"}

The significance of this lion pair was their unusual behavior of killing men and the manner of their attacks.\n\nAs part of the construction of a railway linking Uganda with the Indian Ocean at Kilindini Harbour, in March 1898 the British started building a railway bridge over the Tsavo River in Kenya. The project was led by Lieutenant-Colonel John Henry Patterson. During the next nine months of construction, two maneless male Tsavo lions stalked the campsite, dragging Indian workers from their tents at night and devouring them. Crews tried to scare off the lions and built campfires and \"bomas\", or thorn fences made of whistling thorn trees around their camp for protection to keep the man-eaters out, all to no avail; the lions leaped over or crawled through the thorn fences. After repeated attacks, hundreds of workers fled from Tsavo, halting construction on the bridge. Patterson set traps and tried several times to ambush the lions at night from a tree. After repeated unsuccessful attempts, he shot the first lion on 9 December 1898. Twenty days later, the second lion was found and killed. The first lion killed measured from nose to tip of tail. It took eight men to carry the carcass back to camp. \n\nPatterson wrote in his account that he wounded the first lion with one bullet from a high-calibre rifle. This shot struck the lion in its back leg, but it escaped. Later, it returned at night and began stalking Patterson as he tried to hunt it. He shot it through the shoulder, penetrating its heart with a more powerful rifle and found it lying dead the next morning not far from his platform. \n\nThe second lion was shot up to nine times, five with the same rifle, three with a second, and once with a third rifle. The first shot was fired from atop a scaffolding that Patterson had built near a goat killed by the lion. Two shots from a second rifle hit the lion 11 days later as it was stalking Patterson and trying to flee. When they found the lion the next day, Patterson shot it three more times with the same rifle, severely crippling it, and he shot it three times with a third rifle, twice in the chest, and once in the head, which killed it. He claimed it died gnawing on a fallen tree branch, still trying to reach him.\n\nThe construction crew returned and finished the bridge in February 1899. The exact number of people killed by the lions is unclear. Patterson gave several figures, overall claiming that there were 135 victims.\n\nAfter 25 years as Patterson's floor rugs, the lions' skins were sold to the Chicago Field Museum in 1924 for a sum of $5,000. The skins arrived at the museum in very poor condition. The lions were reconstructed and are now on permanent display along with their skulls.\n\nIn 2001, a review about causes for man-eating behaviour among lions revealed that the proposed human toll of 100 or more was most likely an exaggeration and that the more likely total was 28–31 victims. This reduced total was based on their review of Colonel Patterson's original journal, courtesy of Alan Patterson.\n\nThe two lion specimens in Chicago's Field Museum are known as FMNH 23970, the 'crouching' mount, killed on 9 December 1898, and FMNH 23969, the 'standing' mount, killed on 29 December 1898. Recent studies on the isotopic signature analysis of Δ13C and Nitrogen-15 in their bone collagen and hair keratin were published in 2009. Using realistic assumptions on the consumable tissue per victim, lion energetic needs, and their assimilation efficiencies, researchers compared the man-eaters' Δ13C signatures to various reference standards: Tsavo lions with normal (wildlife) diets, grazers and browsers from Tsavo East and Tsavo West, and the skeletal remains of Taita people from the early 20th century. Interpolation of their estimates across the 9 months of recorded man-eating behavior suggested that FMNH 23969 ate the equivalent of 10.5 humans and that FMNH 23970 ate 24.2 humans.\n\nThe scientific analysis does not differentiate between entire human corpses consumed, compared to parts of individual prey, since the attacks often raised alarm forcing the lions to slink back into the surrounding area. Many workers over the long construction period went missing, died in accidents, or simply left out of fear; so it is likely almost all of the builders, who stayed on, knew someone missing or supposedly eaten. It appears that Colonel Patterson may have exaggerated his claims as have subsequent investigators (e.g. \"135 armed men\", Neiburger and Patterson, 2000) though none of these modern studies have taken into account the people who were killed but not eaten by the animals. The diet of the victims would also affect their isotopic signature. A low meat diet would produce a signature more typical of herbivores in the victims, affecting the outcome of the test. That fact is important to note since many of the workers at Tsavo were Hindus and may have had a vegetarian diet. This research also excludes, but does not disprove, the claims that the lions were not eating the victims they killed but merely killing just to kill. Similar claims have been made of other wildlife predators.\n\nTheories for the man-eating behaviour of lions have been reviewed by Peterhans and Gnoske, as well as Bruce D. Patterson (2004). Their discussions include the following: \n\nAn alternative argument indicates that the first lion had a severely damaged tooth that would have compromised its ability to kill natural prey. This theory has been generally disregarded by the general public and Colonel Patterson, who killed the lions, personally disclaimed it, saying that he damaged that tooth with his rifle while the lion charged him one night, prompting it to flee.\n\nStudies indicate the lions ate humans as a supplement to other food, not as a last resort. Eating humans was probably an alternative to hunting or scavenging caused by dental disease and/or a limited number of prey.\n\nIn a 2017 study carried out by the team of Dr. Bruce Patterson it has been found that one of the lions had an infection at the root of his canine tooth, which made it hard for the lion to hunt. Lions normally use their jaws to grab prey like zebras and wildebeests and suffocate them.\n\nPatterson's book was the basis for several movies: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

World Cancer Day was founded by the Union for International Cancer Control (UICC) to support the goals of the World Cancer Declaration, written in 2008. The primary goal of World Cancer Day is to significantly reduce illness and death caused by cancer and is an opportunity to rally the international community to end the injustice of preventable suffering from cancer.\n\nWorld Cancer Day targets misinformation, raises awareness, and reduces stigma. Multiple initiatives run on World Cancer Day to show support for those affected by cancer. One of these movements is #NoHairSelfie, a global movement to have \"hairticipants\" shave their heads either physically or virtually to show a symbol of courage for those undergoing cancer treatment. Images of participants are then shared over social media. Hundred of events around the world also take place.\n\nIn 2016, World Cancer Day started a three-year campaign under the tagline of 'We can. I can.', which explored the power of collective and individual actions to reduce the impact of cancer. Prior to 2016, the campaign themes included \"Not Beyond Us\" (2015) and \"Debunk the Myths\" (2014). \n\n2019 will be the start of a new campaign theme. \n\n\n"}
