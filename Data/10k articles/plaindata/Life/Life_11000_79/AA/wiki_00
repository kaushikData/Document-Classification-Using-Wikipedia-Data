He has released four studio albums: \"What You See Is What You Get\" (2008); \"Falling & Flying\" (2011), which peaked at No. 4 on the ARIA Albums Chart and was certified platinum; \"Utopia\" (2014), and \"Vintage modern\" (2017). 360's second album provided four charting singles, including \"Boys like You\", which peaked at No. 3 on the ARIA Singles Chart and was certified 4× platinum. At the ARIA Music Awards of 2012, he received six nominations and won the 'Breakthrough Artist – Release' award for \"Falling & Flying\", while Styalz Fuego won the ARIA 'Producer of the Year' Artisan award for the same album.\n\n360 was born on 12 July 1986. He attended Luther College in Melbourne's eastern suburbs and graduated from Box Hill Senior Secondary College.\n\n360 made his first official appearance in 2003 on fellow Australian rapper Infallible's EP \"A Burning Ambition\", on the track \"Situation Critical\" along with MCs Hunter and Versa. The following year, he released his debut solo EP, titled \"Rarities\", in which three of its four tracks featured his rap partner and best friend Pez.\n\nIn 2005, Pez and 360 released a song called \"Nutcase\", which 360 described as a \"fuck around track [that was] written and recorded in one day. Trying to make you laugh, or cringe\". 360 was featured on Sydney producers Weapon X and Ken Hell's 2006 mixtape \"Scar-Non III: Kick To The Head\" with the song \"In Da Chub\", a remix of 50 Cent's 2003 hit \"In Da Club\".\n\nIn February 2007, he signed to Soulmate Records. He released his debut album, \"What You See Is What You Get\", on 22 March 2008. An \"InTheMix\" reviewer found 360 \"not only showcases his hilariously funny comedic side but demonstrates his ability to approach more serious and personal issues, producing a well rounded album\".\n\nIn a video interview for \"Peak Street Magazine\", 360 described his musical style as a combination of \"some pop influences, electro, dubstep, and unintelligent rhymes\". On 14 January 2008, 360 released a music video of \"Mamma Mia\", which depicts his desire for Bec Hewitt and mocked her husband, Lleyton Hewitt, which was the Video of the Week on MySpace.com's Australian hip hop page. 360 described it as a comedic effort, \"I wanted to take the piss out of them ... It's not meant to be taken too seriously she's not really my type\". Management for the couple dismissed the rapper's effort as \"a publicity stunt\".\n\nBy March 2010, he remained signed with Soulmate Records, which had signed a distribution deal with EMI Records. In December that year, his single, \"Just Got Started\" (featuring Pez), was released. By March the following year, it peaked at No. 59 on the ARIA Singles Chart, and at No. 21 on the ARIA Urban Singles Chart.\n\n360's second album, \"Falling & Flying\", was released on 30 September 2011 which reached No. 4 on the ARIA Albums Chart, and remained in the number-one position of the Australian iTunes charts for three weeks. By October 2012, \"Falling & Flying\" was certified platinum by ARIA for shipments of 70,000 units, and was certified double platinum by July 2014.\n\nIn November 2011, the fourth single from the album, \"Boys like You\" (featuring Gossling), was released, which peaked at No. 3 on the Australian singles chart in February 2012. The track also reached the top 40 of the New Zealand Singles Chart. The single was certified 4× platinum by ARIA for shipments of 280,000 units. His following singles, \"Child\" (April 2012) and \"Run Alone\" (August), both reached the ARIA 'Singles Top 30' chart. \"Child\" was certified platinum and \"Run Alone\" received a gold certification.\n\nThe national Australian \"Flying Tour\" occurred in support of the album, and 360 was supported by new Melbourne artist Bam Bam.\n\nIn June 2012, 360 revealed to national youth broadcaster Triple J that he was already working on his third album, describing the upcoming release as \"quite a dark album\". He described it further, \"No one sees behind the scenes and there's been a lot of bad (expletive) going on in my family life and personal life\". 360 hinted at a diverse production line-up for the album, saying he has \"been getting a gang of beats from all different people\".\n\nA video, published on 21 November 2013, served as the official press release for the launch of Forthwrite Records, a music label created by 360 and Pez. 360 then confirmed the announcement on his Facebook page the following day, stating that the label will release \"Don't Look Down\", by Pez, \"Utopia\", by 360, and the debut, yet untitled Forthwrite album.\n\nDuring his performance at the 2013 Sprung Hip Hop Festival, held in Brisbane, Australia, 360 garnered media attention for the manner in which he introduced a new song titled \"On A Planet No One Knows\". According to 360, the song, which also features a vocal sample from Joss Whedon regarding gender equality, is \"about racism in Australia.\" 360 exclaimed:\nThere's a lot of racist cunts in this country [Australia]. I don't know if people are proud to admit it, or what—but there is. No matter what colour or background we are, there are fuckheads in every single race. Generalising everyone is fucking ignorant and uneducated and stupid. If you're offended by this then you're probably fuckin' racist and you should fuck off.\n\nIn February 2014, 360 supported the Australian tour of American rapper Eminem, alongside Kendrick Lamar. 360 described the tour as a career highlight and explained to the media in January 2014 that it would be his first tour sober—he had previously struggled with drug addiction.\n\nPrior to the release of the artist's third album, \"Utopia\", on 13 June 2014, three singles were released: \"Impossible\", \"On A Planet No One Knows\" and \"Sixavelli\". \"Impossible\" is a collaboration with Daniel Johns, of Australian band Silverchair, and Johns also appears in the music video, in which he is a passenger in a car driven by 360. A music video was also released for the second single and was published on the artist's YouTube channel during the week before Australia Day. The music video for \"Sixavelli\" was directed by Claudia Sangiorgi Dalimore and was published in March 2014.\n\nAlongside fellow Australian hip hop act Hilltop Hoods, 360 performed at the 2014 Splendour In The Grass festival, held in Byron Bay, Australia. The Australian \"Utopia Tour\" occurred during September 2014 and 360 was supported by US rapper Hopsin, UK artist Lunar C, Pez and Miracle.\n\nDuring the early years of his music career, 360 collaborated with Pez as part of a duo called \"Forthwrite\", including a track called \"The Club Song\" on the 2010 album \"Good Gracious\", by producer M-Phazes. 360 also featured on Pez's 2008 single, \"The Festival Song\", which peaked at No. 14 on the ARIA Australian Singles Chart.\n\nIn 2010, 360 started an online musical project in the Australian hip hop scene, called \"Rapper Tag\", on YouTube. Rapper Tag involves one person recording a portion of rap over a looped beat, and then nominating (\"tagging\") another person to add further rapping over the same loop. The process continued in accordance with the nomination of the next rapper.\n\nAustralian hip hop duo Diafrix collaborated with 360 for the song \"I'm A Dreamer\", which appears on the 2012 album \"Pocket Full Of Dreams\". 360 appeared on the self-titled debut album by Canberra producer, Ghosts in the Room, released on 14 September 2012 through Mudd Music. The album also features rappers Iron Solomon, Okwerdz and Kool G Rap.\n\n360 was a panel member for the 20 October 2014 edition of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) program \"Q&A\". He appeared alongside Brian Cox, a particle physicist, Richard Gill, renowned conductor, and Nalini Joshi, a notable Australian mathematician, to discuss the topic of \"passion\". 360 garnered media attention for his comments on the television program regarding racism in relation to Australia, Australian hip hop and the Australian flag. When questioned by the presenter, 360 replied:\nOn Australia Day, you see dudes walking around with their tops off, and they're getting on the drink and all that. And they've got an Australian flag wrapped around their neck. I've seen it so many times; like, I've been in a taxi where we've pulled up because these dickheads have been walking across the road—they just start yelling at the taxi driver, like: \"Get out of the country! This is not your country!\" ... And they're wearing Australian flags. I've seen it so much, like, growing up ... still today, you know what I mean?\n\nThis response caused controversy, including the transference of the media spotlight onto Pez, who made comments on social media following 360's appearance. In addition to a message of support for his friend and musical collaborator, Pez also wrote that he also \"got a bit offended\"; however, he subsequently removed the sentence \"To be honest, even I got a bit offended.\" from his original Facebook post. As of 24 October 2014, 360 had not retracted his \"Q&A\" comments and explained after the airing of the episode: \"If you are not racist then you have nothing to be offended about.\"\n\nAt the age of 18 years, 360 contracted a disease of his right eye, a cornea transplant, which \"left him with fuzzy vision\" in that eye. A July 2014 feature article in \"Rolling Stone Australia\" stated that he is \"legally blind in his right eye\", while his left eye is \"slowly deteriorating due to the degenerative eye disease Keratoconus\".\n\nOn 18 July 2010, 360 was involved in a go-karting accident while celebrating his birthday with Sydney-based hip hop artists Bliss n Eso. He suffered a torn artery, lacerated pancreas and a damaged scrotum. According to the rapper, \"It [scrotum] wasn't ruptured, but it was ripped open ... The first thing I checked once I woke up was I didn't need to use a colostomy bag. My sex life is intact. There's no sex appeal if you use a colostomy bag\".\n\nOn 13 February 2012, 360 and Crystal Bale became engaged; the pair then separated on 24 December 2012.\n\nAs of October 2014, 360 is listed as a supporter of the 'Oscar's Law' campaign, which seeks to raise public awareness about the detrimental effects of factory farming of companion animals. He also appeared in PETA's 'Ink not Mink' anti-fur campaign.\n\n360 and Bale promoted awareness of suicide and depression issues. In mid-February 2012, he posted a video clip with the following statement: \"I don't usually drop serious videos, but this is something I'm passionate about spreading awareness about. Even if you hate me, this has nothing to do with music—please share this around so as many people as possible can see it\". In September 2012, Bale posted her video, 'A Message from Crystal', which Beats Factorys Robyn Morrison described as footage of Bale \"talking about how she has been affected by suicide—multiple times ... [it] is sometimes hard to watch, but essential viewing\".\n\nOn 8 January 2016, 360 posted a song named \"I'm Sorry\" onto his Facebook page. It talked about his codeine addiction. His addiction resulted in him cancelling tours without notice. In the song 360 mentions how he didn't tell anyone because he felt like a burden. Because he was addicted to Nurofen Plus, the pills could be bought without a prescription.\n\nIn September 2016, 360 announced that he was diagnosed with unipolar depression.\n\n\"Boys like You\" was voted into the No. 8 position in the Triple J Hottest 100 countdown of 2011. Also that year, 360 was awarded the Channel [V] 'Oz Artist of the Year', ahead of Guy Sebastian and Short Stack, and received the 'Jägermeister Most Hunted Award' at the Jägermeister Independent Music Awards (Australian Independent Record (AIR) Awards), which is voted by fans.\n\nAt the 2012 AIR Awards, 360 won the 'Best Independent Hip Hop Album' award for \"Falling & Flying\".\n\nAt the ARIA Music Awards of 2012, 360 was nominated in six categories and won the 'ARIA Award for Breakthrough Artist - Release' for \"Falling & Flying\", while Feugo won the 'Producer of the Year' in the Artisan section.\n\n"}
{"id": "32121481", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=32121481", "title": "A Short Vision", "text": "A Short Vision\n\nA Short Vision is a British animated film by Joan and Peter Foldes released in 1956. The film, inspired by one of Peter's poems, depicts the destruction of mankind. The film's music was composed by Matyas Seiber, who composed music for \"Animal Farm\" two years earlier.\n\n\"A Short Vision\" gained notoriety when it was shown on \"The Ed Sullivan Show\" on 25 May 1956. This, however, made it controversial. Due to popular demand, it was shown again on 10 June.\n\n\"A Short Vision\" was inspired by a poem composed by Peter Foldes while on a boat from Australia in October 1954. Peter was creative artist for the film, while his wife Joan was responsible for the animation stand, the lighting and some of the animation. The film was produced in the Foldes' kitchen. and was funded by the British Film Institute's Experimental Film Fund. The scheme also funded an earlier Foldes' animation entitled \"Animated Genesis\" about a society which is under threat from a tyrant.\n\nThe film opens with a shot from a bedroom window. It pans to the sky as the narrator (James McKechnie) recalls the time he looked out his window. He saw an object flying through the sky. Throughout the film the object is only referred to as \"It\". Although \"It\" was very far away and seemed to move slowly, it came swiftly and was unnoticed. When \"It\" flew over the mountain, the leopard and the deer looked up. When they saw \"It,\" the deer ran free from the leopard's claws and they both hide in fear. When \"It\" flew over the fields, the owl and the rat looked up, and the rat ran free of the owl's claws and they both hide in fear.\n\nWhen \"It\" flew over the city, everyone was asleep except for their leaders and their wise men, who all looked up at \"It,\" but it was too late. \"It\" produces a mushroom cloud engulfing the city, killing and destroying the wise men, the leaders, the owl, the leopard, the rat and the deer. \"It\" also destroys the sleeping people. \"It\" then engulfs the mountain and the fields; destroying them. When it was all over, there was nothing left except a tiny flame. Then the narrator sees \"It\" flying around the flame like a moth, and then \"It\" too is destroyed. And then, the flame died.\n\nEd Sullivan was originally in England when he saw \"A Short Vision\" and promised an American showing. Sullivan said his motive was a \"plea for peace\". However, he may have shown it because of his relationship with George K. Arthur, the person who sold \"A Short Vision\" for the television and as well as cinemas. 10 days after he saw it on 27 May 1956, Ed Sullivan showed \"A Short Vision\" on his popular Sunday night show \"The Ed Sullivan Show.\" In the first screening Sullivan told the audience to tell their children in the room to not be alarmed, because of its animated nature. Nevertheless, the film was controversial; hence, its popularity. Due to its popularity the film was shown again on 10 June. However, before showing it, Sullivan told parents to take children out of the room.\n\nSullivan was incorrect when he first said \"A Short Vision\" depicted the effects of a H-Bomb on an \"animal population\". The film actually depicts the effects of a H-Bomb on humans and animals; not just animals. This leads some to believe that he did not watch the entirety of \"A Short Vision\" before airing it on his show.\n"}
{"id": "24207129", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24207129", "title": "A Single Man", "text": "A Single Man\n\nA Single Man is a 2009 American drama film based on the novel of the same name by Christopher Isherwood. It is directed by Tom Ford in his directorial debut and stars Colin Firth, who was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actor for his portrayal of George Falconer, a depressed gay British university professor living in Southern California in 1962.\n\nThe film premiered on September 11, 2009 at the 66th Venice International Film Festival, and went on the film festival circuit. After it screened at the 34th Toronto International Film Festival, The Weinstein Company picked it up for distribution in the United States and Germany. An initial limited run in the United States commenced on December 11, 2009, to qualify it for the 82nd Academy Awards with a wider release in early 2010.\n\nOn November 30, 1962, a month after the Cuban missile crisis, George Falconer is a middle-aged English college professor living in Los Angeles. George dreams that he encounters the body of his longtime partner, Jim, at the scene of the car accident that took Jim's life eight months earlier. He bends down to kiss his dead lover. After awakening, George delivers a voiceover discussing the pain and depression he has endured since Jim's death and his intention to commit suicide that evening.\n\nGeorge receives a phone call from his dearest friend, Charley, who projects lightheartedness despite her also being miserable. George goes about his day putting his affairs in order and focusing on the beauty of isolated events, believing he is seeing things for the last time. At times, he recalls his sixteen-year-long relationship with Jim.\n\nDuring the school day George comes into contact with a student, Kenny Potter, who shows interest in George and disregards conventional boundaries of student-professor discussion. George also forms an unexpected connection with a Spanish male prostitute, Carlos. That evening George meets Charley for dinner. Though they initially reminisce and amuse themselves by dancing, Charley's desire for a deeper relationship with George and her failure to understand his relationship with Jim angers George.\n\nGeorge goes to a bar and discovers that Kenny has followed him. They get a round of drinks, go skinny dipping, and then return to George's house and continue drinking. George passes out and wakes up in bed with Kenny asleep in another room. While watching Kenny, George discovers that he had fallen asleep holding George's gun, to keep George from committing suicide. George locks the gun away, burns his suicide notes and in a voiceover explains that he has rediscovered the ability \"to feel, rather than think\". As he makes peace with his grief, George suffers a heart attack and dies, while envisioning Jim appearing and kissing him.\n\nJon Hamm has an uncredited voice cameo as Harold Ackerly. He is Jim's cousin, who calls George to tell him of Jim's death.\n\nFashion designer Tom Ford, as a first-time director, financed the film himself. The film places emphasis on the culture of the 1960s; the production design is by the same team that designed AMC television's \"Mad Men\", which is set in the same era. \"Mad Men\" star Jon Hamm has an uncredited voice cameo as the cousin of George's partner, Jim. The actual house where the character George lives in the film was designed in 1948 by John Lautner, his first house after leaving Frank Lloyd Wright.\n\nThe film was shot in 21 days, according to \"The Making of \"A Single Man\"\" on the DVD.\n\nAn early theatrical poster for \"A Single Man\" featured a close-up shot of Colin Firth and Julianne Moore lying side by side, their arms and shoulders touching. This led to speculation that the work's gay content and themes were being deleted or diminished in its marketing materials to improve its chances of success with a wider audience. A new poster with Moore relocated to the background was issued. The film's original trailer placed more emphasis on the relationship between George and Jim but a re-cut trailer omitted a shot of George and Jim kissing while retaining a kiss between George and Charley. Also deleted were a shot of George staring into a male student's eyes, while keeping a shot of George staring into the eyes of a female student, shots of George meeting hustler Carlos outside a liquor store, and shots of George and Kenny running nude into the ocean.\n\nSpeaking of the controversy, Moore said that director Tom Ford expressed concern that the original poster made the film appear to be a romantic comedy and that he ordered that the poster be changed. However Ford, noting he does not see the film in terms of gay or straight, said, \"I don't think the movie's been de-gayed. I have to say that we live in a society that's pretty weird. For example, you can have full-frontal male nudity on HBO, yet in cinema, you can't have naked male buttocks. You can't have men kissing each other without it being considered adult content. So, in order to cut a trailer that can go into broad distribution in theaters, certain things had to be edited out. But it wasn't an intentional attempt to remove the gayness of the movie.\" Conversely, Colin Firth said, \"[The marketing] is deceptive. I don't think they should do that because there's nothing to sanitize. It's a beautiful story of love between two men and I see no point in hiding that. People should see it for what it is.\" Harvey Weinstein would only say, when asked about marketing a gay romance, \"\"Brokeback Mountain\" did pretty well. \"Midnight Cowboy\" did pretty well. If you know how to market, you can market. There's an audience for it.\" When pressed about the poster, Weinstein cut off the interview, saying, \"I'm good. You got enough. Thank you.\" Peter Knegt of \"Indiewire\" suggested that The Weinstein Company \"de-gayed\" the trailer to better the film's chances of receiving Academy Award nominations.\n\nThe film has received an overall positive reception from critics, with most reviews singling out Colin Firth's performance. It currently holds an 85% \"Fresh\" rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 175 reviews, with the site's consensus being that \"Though the costumes are beautiful and the art direction impeccable, what stands out most from this debut by fashion designer Tom Ford is the leading performance by Colin Firth.\" Metacritic has compiled an average score of 77 (generally favorable reviews) from 35 critic reviews.\n\nMichael Phillips of the \"Chicago Tribune\" wrote \"Some films aren’t revelations, exactly, but they burrow so deeply into old truths about love and loss and the mess and thrill of life, they seem new anyway\" Bob Mondello of NPR commented “An exquisite, almost sensual grief suffuses every frame of A Single Man.” Marc Savlov of \"The Austin Chronicle\" wrote “Everything fits perfectly, from titles to fin, but most of all Colin Firth, who dons the role of George like a fine bespoke suit.”\n\nCritics who liked the film include \"The A.V. Club\" film critic Nathan Rabin, who gave the film an A- score, arguing that \"\"A Single Man\" is a film of tremendous style wedded to real substance, and rooted in \"Firth's affecting lead performance as a man trying to keep it together for one last day after his world has fallen apart.\" Critic Roger Ebert of the \"Chicago Sun-Times\" also praised Firth, saying that he \"plays George superbly, as a man who prepares a face to meet the faces that he meets. He betrays very little emotion, and certainly his thoughts cannot be read in his eyes.\"\n\n\"The Times\" newspaper of London called the film \"a thing of heart-stopping beauty . . . There will be critics who will be unable to get past the director's background, but rest assured: Tom Ford is the real deal.\" \"Variety\"'s verdict: \"Luminous and treasurable, despite its imperfections. An impressive helming debut for fashion designer Tom Ford.\"\n\nThe film was nominated for the Golden Lion at the 66th Venice International Film Festival and won the festival's third annual Queer Lion. Colin Firth was awarded the Volpi Cup for Best Actor at the film festival for his performance in the film. He received a BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role. Firth also received Golden Globe, Screen Actors Guild and Academy Award nominations for Best Actor. For her performance, Julianne Moore was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress in Motion Picture. Abel Korzeniowski was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Original Score. The film received the Grand Prix from the Belgian Syndicate of Cinema Critics.\n\nOn January 14, 2010, the film was nominated for, and later won, Outstanding Film – Wide Release at the 21st GLAAD Media Awards along with AFI's Film of the Year.\n\n"}

Spurred by critics who decried his lack of military victories, he led an expedition north to Pamplona, where a Frankish or Aquitanian party had taken over after the Battle of Poitiers. Despite his failure to capture the Basque fortress, he left troops to invest it, and decided to continue his way north across the Pyrenees, where he engaged the Basques in skirmishes and was eventually overcome, but managed to escape back to Al-Andalus.\n\nAfter being deposed and incarcerated by his successor Uqba ibn al-Hajjaj or possibly the governor of Ifriqiya (\"was bound in chains\"), he made his way back to prominence in 740, when he was appointed wali (governor) of Al-Andalus again after the former´s natural death. This time he had to deal with serious Berber rebellion in North Africa, expanded now to Iberia too. The governor saw no option but to take the Syrian troops commanded by his adversary Balj ibn Bishr al-Qushayri as ally to quash the rebellion, so putting down the uprisings. \n\nHowever, ultimately Balj ibn Bishr had him arrested in Cordova for former grievances, put him to a horrible death in 742, and had him crucified on the outskirts of the city flanked by a similarly killed pig and dog on either side.\n"}

He succeeded his father Adolf I under the regency of his mother, Hildewa.\n\nAfter the death of the Emperor Lothair II (1137), the new king, Conrad III, granted the Duchy of Saxony to Albert the Bear. Adolf was consequently deprived of Holstein because he was a Welf supporter and refused to recognise Albert as duke. He only received it back in 1142 when Conrad and Henry the Lion were reconciled.\n\nIn 1143, Henry and Adolf divided the rule of the conquered Slavic lands to their east. Adolf received Wagria with its chief city, the castle of Sigberg, built by Lothair, and Henry received Polabia with Ratzeburg as its capital. Sigberg became Adolf's chief fortress and most regular seat. Adolf promoted Christianity in his new lands, especially through the missionary work of Vicelinus. Adolf, encouraged by Lothair, promoted German colonisation of his Slavic territories, especially with colonists from not only his own lands but also from Westphalia, Flanders, Holland, Utrecht, and Frisia.\n\nIn 1143 or 1144, Adolf built Lübeck, the first German port on the Baltic Sea. Adolf also built the first castle (1143) in Lübeck: a wood and earth construction. In 1157, Lübeck was burned and rebuilt by Henry the Lion, to whom Adolf transferred it in 1159.\n\nAdolf supported Sweyn III of Denmark against the claimant Canute V in a dispute over the Danish throne.

Having immigrated to Egypt at the age of three years old, her family knew the composer Dawood Hosni, and she sang the compositions of Mohamed El Qasabgi and Zakariyya Ahmad. She also sang the compositions of Mohammed Abdel Wahab and her brother Farid al-Atrash, a then rising star musician in his own right. Her voice was one of the few female voices in Arab music world to pose serious competition to that of Umm Kulthum, who is considered to be one of the Arab world's most distinguished singers of the 20th century. Her mysterious death in an automobile accident shocked the public. Journalists spread gossip about her turbulent personal life and an alleged espionage role in World War II.\n\nAsmahan was born to Fahd al-Atrash, a Syrian Druze from Suwayda, and 'Alia al-Mundhir, a Lebanese Druze from Hasbaya. Her father came from the Druze al-Atrash clan, well known in Syria for its role in fighting against the French occupation.\n\nAsmahan's father supposedly served as governor of the district of Demirci in Turkey, during the last days of the Ottoman Empire. Asmahan's father, fled the country with his children and pregnant wife. On 25 November 1912, they embarked on a ship from İzmir to Beirut, and Asmahan was born on board. She was named \"Amal\", meaning \"hopes\". She was also called \"Emily\", but always preferred the name \"Amal\". After the French came into power, the family returned to Jabal al-druze.\n\nFollowing the Adham Khanjar incident in 1922, the al-Atrash home in al-Qrayya (a town in Jabal al-Druze) was bombed by French forces. 'Alia fled with her children to Damascus and, despite orders from Fahd, refused to return. Asmahan later recalled her childhood years in Jabal al-Druze as \"untouched by anything truly bad\". 'Alia and the three children travelled to Beirut, but, after discovering that the French were searching for them there, they stopped in Haifa in Palestine, and travelled from there to Egypt, where she sought Political Asylum for her and her three children; they were later granted the right of Political Asylum in 1926 by the Egyptian Government, thus naturalized as Egyptian citizens.\n\n'Alia chose to immigrate to Cairo, because 'Alia knew that Egypt's then nationalist prime minister Saad Zaghloul and her husband's relative, Sultan al-Atrash were on corresponding terms. According to family accounts, 'Alia was permitted to enter Egypt under the sponsorship of Saad Zaghloul. Many other Syrians and Lebanese were present in Egypt in this period.\n\nAsmahan and her family first lived in an apartment in a humble section of Cairo. Her mother did laundry and sewing to support the family. She had an excellent voice, could play the `ud, sang at parties and made some recordings. Asmahan and her brothers attended a French Catholic school. In order to receive waivers for the high cost of tuition, 'Alia registered them under the alias \"Kusah\" (meaning \"courgette\") rather than trying to convince school officials that members of the wealthy al-Atrash family were destitute. 'Alia received a monthly stipend from a secret benefactor rumored to be \"Baron\" Crane (of the King–Crane Commission) according to one Egyptian journalist. This allowed her to cover the costs of her children's school's tuition, and a nicer apartment on Habib Shalabi Street.\n\nAmal's vocal talent was discovered at an early age. Once, when her brother Farid received one of Egypt's most famous composers, Dawood Hosni, in their home, the latter overheard her singing in her room, and insisted on seeing her immediately. He then asked her to sing again. He was much impressed by the performance, and suggested the stage name of Asmahan to her. Amal began using that name.\n\nAsmahan rose to fame quickly: she was not even fourteen (or seventeen, since her birth date is disputed) years old when she was introduced to the public at a concert at the prestigious Cairo Opera House. She sang and recorded songs composed by Farid Ghosn, Dawood Hosni, Mohamed El Qasabgi, and Zakariyya Ahmad. At sixteen, Asmahan was invited by an Egyptian record company to make her first album, featuring her first song \"Ya Nar Fouadi\" by Farid Ghosn.\n\nA variety of teachers advanced her vocal and musical studies. Hosni volunteered to instruct Asmahan on how to play the oud; Qasabgi comments however on the mature level of her sight reading and musicality by the time she performed his work, some years later. However, her brothers wanted her to marry and return to Syria. Her cousin, Hassan al-Atrash travelled to Egypt, intending to propose to a different relative, however, once he saw Asmahan, he pursued her and she returned to Syria for at least five and half years, interrupting her musical career.\n\nSince Asmahan sang in Egypt, the lyrics of her songs were written in classical Arabic and in a more colloquial Arabic, but she also sang in the Eastern dialect of Arabic. Asmahan was particularly fond of performing songs by Umm Kulthoum and Mohamed Abdel Wahab. When asked to sing about cultural patriotism and love, she sang of Egypt.\" Since singers and studios depended on the elites, Asmahan had to sing songs on uplifting nationalist themes or in praise of the Egyptian royal family. At the beginning of her career she sang in the nightclub owned by Mary Mansour.\n\nAsmahan's older brother, Fuad, and other Druze relatives considered a career in entertainment for a girl to be disgraceful. For them, culturally, \"Egypt was a planetary distance from the small villages of the Druze.\" and it was difficult for her relatives to accept Asmahan's integration into the heterogeneous Egyptian social scene. The clearly defined divisions, along religious lines, of the Syrian countryside did not operate in Egypt. During the period when she was married to her cousin, Hassan, and then later in 1941, when she remarried him and returned to Egypt her musical career came to a standstill. When the marriage first broke up, she left for Egypt immediately, even before she had obtained the bill of divorce. With her return to Egypt and a singing career, she finally repudiated \"respectability\", leaving both her relatives and Syrian Druze society furious. When her first film, \"Intisar al-Shabab\", was released in Syria, one young Druze shot at the screen when the character played by Asmahan appeared. Asmahan, bi-national or, in contemporary parlance, trans-national by then, had become \"a sophisticated \"foreigner\" to the young men in the Jabal Druze.\"\n\nIn 1933 Asmahan's cousin, Hassan al-Atrash, came to Cairo and proposed marriage, requesting that Asmahan abandon her musical career. She agreed on three conditions: that they live in Damascus rather than Jabal al-Druze, winter in Cairo, and that she would never be required to wear the traditional hijab. They married and moved first to 'Ara where the al-Atrash retain a large home, and then built their own home in Suwayda. Asmahan gave birth to her daughter, Kamellia. Eventually, Asmahan missed her career and her life in Cairo; and in 1939, she and Hassan were divorced. In her final confrontation with her cousin at Mena House Hotel in Giza, she told him, \"I stood with you for independence and liberation, I did. But, I was created for another purpose. I prefer the work of Farid, and the work of Umm Kulthum, and of art.\" She returned to Cairo and resumed her singing career, entering a short marriage to Egyptian director Ahmed Badrkhan.\n\nIn 1941 she returned to Syria in a dramatic and secret journey under the auspices of the British. Hassan agreed to meet with her, and used the occasion to successfully entreat her to remarry him. During the time they were married, she twice attempted suicide. Tabloid newspapers suggested that this was so that she could obtain a second divorce from Hassan; however it seemed he actually agreed due to her visits to Jerusalem where wild rumours attached to her behaviour and overspending. Her third and final marriage was to the Egyptian director Ahmed Salem, supposedly to facilitate her return to Egypt over impositions by government authorities. It is unclear how that would occur, however, and she had an ongoing studio contract in Egypt. Asmahan was close friends with the al Othman family and met with them when she travelled to Haifa, Palestine, when they helped her.\nAlso in 1941, Asmahan met Mohammed Abdel Wahab, Egypt's most distinguished singer and composer, and starred with him in his operetta \"Magnun Layla\" (\"Besotted with Layla\"). Abdel Wahab introduced her to the journalist, Mohamed al-Taba'i, who suggests that she was in love with him, but the tone of his writing indicates that he was in love with her, but did not respect her. He suggests she had affairs or at least an ongoing relationship with the royal chamberlain Ahmed Pasha Hassanein but this might be exaggerated. Her brothers, Fuad and Farid, were no longer able to monitor her movements. Her brother was a noted gambler; she and her friends also partied, smoked, drank and gambled. She became very ill for a period, but recordings show that her voice did not suffer.\n\nAsmahan was proud of her family background, and always mentioned her father and his cousin, Sultan al-Atrash, to clarify her ancestry — once saying to al-Taba'i, after he had just insulted her, \"Don't you know who I am? Why I am the daughter of Fahd al-Atrash and cousin to the Amir al-Atrash and the Druze revolutionary hero Sultan al-Atrash. Asmahan was not a first cousin of Hassan's, but referred to him as \"ibn 'ammi\" to the Egyptians, in fact, she was his second cousin, twice removed (by generation).\n\nAsmahan's noted wide vocal range included contralto and dramatic mezzo-soprano (as one can hear in her rendition of \"Ya Tuyur\" where she reaches a high A with ease and brio). Asmahan's voice has been compared to Fairuz and Sabah. However, as she began her career more than two decades earlier, she had not in fact, adopted the Italian singing technique known as bel canto, but rather learned singing from many admirable models of her own period and in Egypt where a much more diverse group of singers performed, and at a time when Arabic singing utilized both nasal and chest resonance.\n\nAsmahan's voice was powerful, but also agile. She generally sang in her chest register but could use her head register and sing in a very controlled tone. It is not incorrect to say that she was the first or one of the first Arabic singers to use the classical western technique, also very few performers are able to alternate two different styles of interpretation and technique in one song (western and arab).\n\nIn 1941, during World War II, Asmahan returned to the French Mandate of Syria (Syria, then under the rule of Vichy France) at the request of the British and the Free French. She was on a secret mission to notify her people in Jabal al-Druze that the British and Free French forces would be invading Syria through their territory, and to convince them they should not fight. The British and Free French had promised the independence of Syria and Lebanon to all inhabitants on the date of the invasion. The Druze agreed, even though some groups did not receive word in time and fought the invading forces. After the Allies secured Syria during the Syria-Lebanon Campaign, General Charles de Gaulle visited Syria. When the Allies failed to carry out their promise for Syrian independence, Asmahan tried to contact the Nazis in Turkey, but was stopped at the border and sent to Lebanon. It was also possible that Asmahan needed money because her husband had cut off her expenses, so she may have tried to reach the Germans simply to obtain funds.\n\nAsmahan told Mohamed al-Taba'i that she was to receive the sum of £40,000 from the British for her services to the allies. General Charles de Gaulle's representative in Cairo was General Georges Catroux. Catroux's délégué in Damascus, Colonel Collet, stated that the British gave money to Asmahan (and to other Druze men, in his presence) and sent her to the Jabal to secure the support of the Druze before the Allies' invasion. The same information is stated by Edward Spears in his memoirs.\n\nOn 14 July 1944, a car carrying Asmahan and a female friend crashed and went into a canal at the side of the road, after the driver lost control near the city of Mansoura, Egypt. The car was a two-door model and the women were sitting in the backseat. They were presumed to be rendered unconscious and subsequently drowned. The driver, however, managed to escape.\n\nThese circumstances gave rise to many suspicions, rumours and conspiracy theories. British intelligence, for example, after many reports circulated claiming she had been working for them, was accused of having got rid of her after she had attempted to meet with German agents. The German Gestapo was also accused of murdering her for the help she had given the British. Her husband at the time had fought violently with her, and her family's honour had been besmirched by the many rumours.\n\nAsmahan was buried in Egypt in accordance with her wishes as, years later, were her two brothers, Fouad and Farid al-Atrash, in the Fustat plain in Cairo, which she and brother Farid, along with Egyptian crooner Abdel Halim Hafez, had restored to some of its former glory.\n\nThe Egyptian Media Production City and a private investor jointly produced a television series depicting the life (and death) of Asmahan. The Arabic series debuted during the month of Ramadan in 2008. Asmahan was played by Syrian actress Sulaf Fawakherji. On 25 November 2015, Google celebrated Asmahan's 103rd birthday using a Google doodle.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "5713956", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5713956", "title": "Capital punishment in the Philippines", "text": "Capital punishment in the Philippines\n\nCapital punishment in the Philippines has a varied history and is currently suspended as of 2006. Capital punishment was legal after independence and increased in use under the Ferdinand Marcos regime. After the fall of Marcos, there was a moratorium on capital punishment from 1987 to 1999, followed by a resumption in executions from 1999 to 2006, and followed - in turn - by a law ending the practice. \n\nFilipinos have mixed opinions about the death penalty, with many opposing it on religious and humanitarian grounds, while advocates see it as a way of deterring crimes.\n\nDuring Spanish colonial rule, the most common methods of execution were death by firing squad (especially for treason/military crimes, usually reserved for independence fighters) and garrotte (a notable case would be the Gomburza). Death by hanging was another popular method.\n\nA prominent example is the national hero, José Rizal, who was executed by firing squad on the morning of December 30, 1896, in the park that now bears his name.\n\nIn 1926, the electric chair (Spanish: \"silla eléctrica\"; Filipino: \"silya eléktrika\") was introduced by the United States' colonial Insular Government, making the Philippines the only other country to employ this method. The last colonial-era execution took place under Governor-General Theodore Roosevelt, Jr. in February 1932. There were no executions under Manuel L. Quezon, the first President of the Commonwealth.\n\nThe capital crimes after regaining full sovereignty in July 1946 were murder, rape and treason. However, no executions took place until April 1950, when Julio Gullien was executed for attempting to assassinate President Manuel Roxas. Other notable cases includes Marciál \"Baby\" Ama, electrocuted at the age of 16 on October 4, 1961, for murders committed while in prison for lesser charges. Ama notably became the subject of the popular 1976 film, \"Bitayin si... Baby Ama!\" (Execute Baby Ama!).\n\nA former powerful Governor of Negros Occidental Rafael Lacson and 22 of his allies, condemned to die in August 1954 for the murder of a political opponent. Ultimately, Lacson was never executed. \nIn total, 51 people were electrocuted up to 1961. Execution numbers climbed under President Ferdinand Marcos, who was himself sentenced to death in 1939 for the murder of Julio Nalundasan—the political rival of his father, Mariano; the young Ferdinand was acquitted on appeal. A notorious triple execution took place in May 1972, when Jaime José, Basilio Pineda and Edgardo Aquino were electrocuted for the 1967 abduction and gang-rape of young actress Maggie dela Riva. The state ordered that the executions be broadcast on national television.\n\nUnder the Marcos regime, drug trafficking also became punishable by death by firing squad, such as the case with Lim Seng, whose execution in January 15, 1973, was also ordered broadcast on national television. Future President and then Chief of the Philippine Constabulary Gen. Fidel V. Ramos was present at the execution.\n\nThe electric chair was used until 1976, when execution by firing squad eventually replaced it as the sole method of execution. Under Marcos' 20-year authoritarian rule, however, countless more people were summarily executed, tortured or simply disappeared for opposition to his rule. l\n\nAfter Marcos was deposed in 1986, the newly drafted 1987 Constitution prohibited the death penalty but allowed the Congress to reinstate it \"hereafter\" for \"heinous crimes\"; making the Philippines the first Asian country to abolish capital punishment.\n\nPresident Fidel V. Ramos promised during his campaign that he would support the re-introduction of the death penalty in response to increasing crime rates. The new law, drafted by Ramos, restored capital punishment. This law provided the use of the electric chair until the gas chamber (chosen by the government to replace electrocution) could be used.\n\nExecutions resumed in 1999, starting with Leo Echegaray, who was put to death by lethal injection under Ramos' successor, Joseph Estrada, marking the first execution after the reinstatement of the death penalty. The next execution saw an embarrassing mishap when President Estrada decided to grant a last-minute reprieve, but failed to get through to the prison authorities in time to stop the execution. Following on a personal appeal by his spiritual advisor, Bishop Teodoro Bacani, Estrada called a moratorium in 2000 to honor the bimillenial anniversary of Christ's birth. Executions were resumed a year later.\n\nEstrada's successor, Gloria Macapagal Arroyo, was a vocal opponent of the death penalty and also approved a moratorium, but later permitted executions and denied pardons.\n\nWhen the Philippines had the death penalty, male inmates condemned to death were held at New Bilibid Prison and female inmates condemned to death were held at Correctional Institution for Women (Mandaluyong). The death chamber for inmates to be electrocuted was in Building 14, within the Maximum Security Compound of New Bilibid. The Bureau of Corrections (BuCor) Museum previously served as the lethal injection chamber.\n\nOn 15 April 2006, the sentences of 1,230 death row inmates were commuted to life imprisonment, in what Amnesty International believes to be the \"largest ever commutation of death sentences\".\n\nCapital punishment was again suspended via Republic Act No. 9346, which was signed by President Arroyo on 24 June 2006. The bill followed a vote held in Congress earlier that month which overwhelmingly supported the abolition of the practice. The penalties of life imprisonment and \"reclusion perpetua\" (detention of indefinite length, usually for at least 30 years) replaced the death penalty. Critics of Arroyo's initiative called it a political move meant to placate the Roman Catholic Church, some sectors of which were increasingly vocal in their opposition to her rule.\n\nThe Philippines subsequently signed the Second Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. The Optional Protocol commits its members to the abolition of the death penalty within their borders.\n\nIt was signed on 20 Sep 2006 and ratified on 20 Nov 2007.\n\nOn December 6, 2016, after the justice committee of the Philippine House of Representatives approved a draft measure on the reimposition of the death sentence, Zeid Ra’ad Al Hussein, the UN Commissioner for Human Rights released an open letter addressed to the Philippine Speaker of the House and the President of the Senate saying, \"International law does not permit a State that has ratified or acceded to the Second Optional Protocol to denounce it or withdraw from it”. Zaid asserted that because there is no “denunciation clause” in the protocol “thereby guaranteeing the permanent non-reintroduction of the death penalty by States that ratified the Protocol.”.\n\nPresident Arroyo controversially pardoned many prisoners during her presidency, including a 2009 pardon for all remaining felons convicted for the 1983 assassination of former Senator and opposition leader Benigno Aquino, Jr.\n\nDuring the 2016 election, presidential candidate and frontrunner, Davao City mayor Rodrigo Duterte, campaigned to restore the death penalty in the Philippines. During the \"Yes or No\" segment of the second presidential debate on March 20, 2016, Duterte and Senator Grace Poe were the only candidates who said \"Yes\" when asked about the restoration of the death penalty in the country, favoring the decision. Duterte, who won the election in May 2016, supports restoration of the death penalty by hanging. It has been reported that he wants capital punishment for criminals involved in illegal drugs, gun-for-hire syndicates and those who commit \"heinous crimes\" such as rape, robbery or car theft where the victim is murdered, while Poe has stated that the capital punishment should apply to criminals convicted of \"drugs and multiple crimes where involved people can no longer be rehabilitated.\" Duterte has theatrically vowed \"to litter Manila Bay with the bodies of criminals.\" In December 2016, the bill to resume capital punishment for certain \"heinous offenses\" swiftly passed out of Committee in the House of Representatives; it passed the full House of Representatives in February 2017. However, the law reinstating the death penalty stalled in the Senate in April 2017, where it did not appear to have enough votes to pass.\n\nIn a 2017 poll, 67% of Filipinos supported the death penalty.\n\nThe Philippines was the only country aside from the United States that used the electric chair, due to its being introduced during the US colonial period. Until its first abolition in 1987, the country reverted to using death by firing squad.\n\nAfter re-introduction of the death penalty in 1993, the country switched to lethal injection as its sole method of execution.\n\n"}

{"id": "2182156", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2182156", "title": "Chef (South Park)", "text": "Chef (South Park)\n\nJerome \"Chef\" McElroy is a cartoon character on the Comedy Central series \"South Park\" who was voiced by Isaac Hayes. A cafeteria worker at the local elementary school in the town of South Park, Colorado, Chef is generally portrayed as more level-headed than the other adult residents of the town, and sympathetic to the children. His guidance is often sought by the show's core group of child protagonists — Eric Cartman, Stan Marsh, Kyle Broflovski, and Kenny McCormick — as he is usually the only adult whom they consistently trusted. To an inadvertent fault, he frequently gives inappropriate advice, usually in the non sequitur form of a lascivious soul song.\n\nChef was inspired by Hayes and other popular soul singers of the 1970s, as well as an actual dining hall worker encountered by series co-creator Trey Parker while he attended the University of Colorado. Chef played a less prominent role as the series progressed beyond its earlier seasons, and the character was retired at the beginning of the tenth season in \"The Return of Chef\" following the controversial departure of Hayes.\n\nIn tradition with the show's animation style, Chef is composed of simple geometrical shapes, and is animated with use of a computer, though he is given the impression of being a construction paper cutout composition animated through the use of stop motion, which was the technique used to animate the \"Spirit of Christmas\" shorts and the show's first episode. Chef is an overweight African American with a beard who usually wore blue pants and a red shirt. He frequently dons a traditional chef's hat and white apron on which the word \"CHEF\" is printed in black, even when he is not at work.\n\nUntil Token Black and his family were given a more notable role starting in the show's fourth season, Chef was portrayed as the only black resident in all of South Park. Parker and co-creator Matt Stone initially planned to have one of themselves voice the character, fearing that their ideal candidates of Hayes, Lou Rawls, and Barry White would never agree to voice the character because the duo had admittedly and purposefully created him as a \"stereotype\" to reflect what they felt was the perception most inhabitants of less-diverse mountainous Colorado towns had of black people. However, Hayes agreed to voice the character due in part to the audacity of some of the show's early scripts. Chef (usually kindheartedly, though not always) referred to most people in town with the pejorative \"crackers\", including the children.\n\nChef, after abandoning his musical aspirations, moved to South Park with plans to open his own restaurant. Before this, he had befriended several famous recording artists in the music industry, including Elton John and Meat Loaf, helping them to launch their successful careers. Despite failing at yet another dream, Chef made his way onto the South Park City Council, representing Public Safety. In addition to dispensing advice to the children and a few of the adult townsfolk, Chef speaks out against what he feels are outrageous ideas. For example, he opposes the rampant prescription of Ritalin in the episode \"Timmy 2000\", and he objects to the town's acceptance of Mr. Garrison committing purposefully flamboyant sadomasochistic acts in front of schoolchildren in \"The Death Camp of Tolerance\". In \"Chef Goes Nanners\", he briefly converts to Islam and adopted the name \"Abdul Mohammed Jabar Rauf Kareem Ali\" when he demanded that South Park change its official flag because it depicted the town's racist past. On several other occasions, Chef helped save South Park (and in a few other instances, the entire world) from potential disasters.\n\nChef is also known for frequently engaging in casual sex, a habit he often expresses through song. He drives a 1980s woodie station wagon with a vanity plate that reads \"LUV CHEF\". He is often seen accompanied by numerous young women when at home or on vacation, and is even revealed to have had a one-night stand with Kathie Lee Gifford. He once resorted to male prostitution in an effort to raise money to pay legal fees, and had sex with nearly every woman in South Park before having to stop due to exhaustion. In \"The Succubus\", Chef briefly becomes an office worker and took up monogamy after meeting a woman named Veronica. The two were engaged to be married until it was revealed that Veronica was actually a succubus. In the \"South Park\" video game, the children can seek Chef's advice at one of the many buildings labelled \"Chef's Shack O' Love\", which is implied to be a brothel, complete with a naked woman in Chef's bed.\n\nChef's parents, Nellie and Thomas McElroy, live in Scotland. The couple have made two major appearances in the episodes \"The Succubus\" and \"The Biggest Douche in the Universe\", and made a brief cameo in a town Christmas celebration in \"Red Sleigh Down\". They were not seen at Chef's funeral in \"The Return of Chef\".\n\nChef is known to have run a quiz show called \"Chef's Luv Shack\", as is apparent in the video game of the same name.\n\nChef endearingly calls the boys \"the children\" or just \"children\" (even when addressing one individually), and, unless he is preoccupied with a female companion, is usually willing to assist them with whatever help they need. He is consistently the only adult in town who the boys held in high regard, and they view him as their friend. They are also visibly saddened his presence in their lives is threatened. In addition to being fans of his food (especially his trademark Salisbury steak), the boys often heartily anticipate encountering Chef when waiting in the school lunch line, so that they can explain whatever dilemma is affecting them, usually after their traditional greeting:\nChef: Hello there, children!<br>\nThe boys [in unison]: Hey Chef!<br>\nChef: How's it goin'?<br>\nThe boys [one or in unison]: Bad.<br>\nChef: Why \"bad\"?<br>\nThe boys sometimes take it upon themselves to travel to Chef's house individually to seek his advice on all manners of their problems, specifically relationships. He usually gives advice in the form of a soul song, which usually winds up being about sex, whether or not sex was relevant to the topic at hand. Hearing the songs would often leave the boys even more confused and with no further understanding of what they initially inquire about. In earlier seasons, Chef is often approached by the children when they are unfamiliar with a term that pertains to adult matters, such as \"lesbian\" or \"prostitute\". This happens so often that it eventually aggravates Chef, who pleads with them to stop asking questions he feels are not appropriate for him to answer. Despite this, the children continue asking these questions, much to his chagrin. An absent-minded Chef sometimes answers anyway, not realizing his lapse until the damage had been done. Chef acknowledges that doing this had repeatedly gotten him in trouble with his boss, Principal Victoria.\n\nIn addition to singing in an effort to explain something to the children, Chef also sings about things relevant to what has transpired in the plot. These songs were original compositions written by Parker, and performed by Hayes in the same sexually suggestive R&B style he had utilized during his own music career. Within the show, Chef is the original composer of these songs, including \"Stinky Britches\", which was depicted as having been covered by Alanis Morissette without proper credit to Chef. When Chef is left with legal debt after losing a court case to have himself credited as the song's original writer, several bands and artists (guest starring as themselves) hold a concert dubbed \"Chef Aid\", a parody of Live Aid, to raise the funds. The episode inspired a real-life album, \"\", released in 1998, which featured guest stars from the episode such as Elton John and Ozzy Osbourne. The album includes many of the full-length versions of the songs Chef had performed in the show's first two seasons; \"Chocolate Salty Balls\" was released as a single, and reached #1 in both the record charts of Ireland and the United Kingdom. As the series progressed and Chef's role became more intermittent, his spontaneous outbursts into song became less of a show standard.\n\nParker and Stone originally planned to have Chef sing a song in every single episode but abandoned the idea after finding it too challenging and fearing writing too many songs would make them less funny, similar to their rationale for dispensing with Kenny's episodic deaths.\n\nOn January 4, 2006, Hayes defended \"South Park's\" style of controversial humor to \"The A.V. Club\" and XM's \"Opie and Anthony\" show, going so far as to note that although he was not pleased with the show's depiction of the Church of Scientology, of which he was a member, he \"understood what Matt and Trey are doing.\" However, on March 13, 2006, nearly two months after suffering a stroke, Hayes was reported to have quit \"South Park\" over objections to the show's attitudes toward and depiction of various religions, claiming that the show had crossed the line from satire into intolerance.\n\nDespite the content of the official press release, there remains considerable speculation about the motivations behind his departure. Parker and Stone assert that he quit due to the controversial episode \"Trapped in the Closet\", and its treatment of Scientology. Stone commented in a manner that suggested that Hayes practiced a double standard regarding the treatment of religion on \"South Park\": \"[We] never heard a peep out of Isaac in any way until we [lampooned] Scientology. He wants a different standard for religions other than his own, and to me, that is where intolerance and bigotry begin.\" Fox News reporter Roger Friedman suggested that, because he was still suffering from the effects of his stroke, Hayes was hospitalized and not in a position to make a rational decision to leave the show. Friedman also reported that Hayes left the show because of the external pressure forced by his fellow Scientologists, the decision was not voluntary, and the original press release announcing his departure was put out by someone who was not authorized to represent him. In a 2016 oral history of \"South Park\" in \"The Hollywood Reporter\", Isaac Hayes III confirmed that the decision to leave the show was made by Hayes' entourage while Hayes was unable to make such decisions on his own.\n\nNine days after Hayes's departure from production, the controversy was satirized in the show's Season 10 premiere \"The Return of Chef\". For the episode, voice clips of Chef were taken from previous episodes and linked together to form new dialogue to support the plot, which involves Chef's leaving South Park to join the \"Super Adventure Club\", which eventually brainwashes Chef until he had the mindset of a child molester. The organization combines outdoor activities with child molestation, an act they perceive as justified because of their beliefs.\n\nAfter the boys are unable to convince Chef to come back to South Park, a rope bridge Chef is walking across is struck by lightning. He falls to a violent death, culminating with his mutilation at the hands of a grizzly bear and a mountain lion and finally discharged fecal matter (a reference to the episode \"Something Wall-Mart This Way Comes\", in which Cartman claims that the relaxation of the bowel muscles confirms that a person is really dead).\n\nSouth Park holds a memorial service for him (Canadian comedians Terrance and Phillip even attend, despite having never met the man themselves), in which Kyle gives a eulogy stating, \"We shouldn't be mad at Chef for leaving us, we should be mad at that fruity little club for scrambling his brains\", a deliberate parallel with Hayes' departure from the show in favor of Scientology.\n\nMimicking a scene from the finale of \"\", Chef's body is secretly collected by the Super Adventure Club, who managed to revive him as a cyborg — identified on the show's official website as \"Darth Chef\" (a parody of\" Star Wars' \"Darth Vader). He is fitted with a suit and mask like those of Vader, except with the helmet taking on the appearance of Chef's trademark hat, and wields a red, glowing spatula, parodying Vader's red lightsaber. Darth Chef's voice was provided by British comedian and filmmaker Peter Serafinowicz, who voiced Darth Maul in \"\". Darth Chef has not made an appearance in subsequent episodes, but has appeared with other characters in the background of the \"South Park\" opening sequence, and is mentioned in the episode \"Stunning and Brave\", when PC Principal says the kids drove him to kill himself, which is not true.\n\nChef is alluded to after his death in the season 10 episode \"Hell on Earth 2006\" where, during Satan's party, there are multiple scenes in which a Caucasian male dressed as Chef can be seen in the background. He is also referenced in the season 14 episode \"Crème Fraiche\" when Randy becomes the new chef at school and greets the kids with Chef's trademark lines. Isaac Hayes himself died on August 10, 2008, two years after his departure from \"South Park\".\n\nChef makes an appearance in the 2014 video game \"\" as the reanimated Nazi Zombie penultimate boss later in the game. Once again, voice clips of Isaac Hayes as Chef are recycled from past episodes with the exception of recorded speech clips from Adolf Hitler. During his battle with the player and the other boys, Chef will express remorse by saying things like \"I'm sorry, boys\" and \"what have I done?\" While there were vague references to the Super Adventure Club and his death, there were no references to the Darth Chef suit.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "575113", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=575113", "title": "Dorothy Kilgallen", "text": "Dorothy Kilgallen\n\nDorothy Mae Kilgallen (July 3, 1913 – November 8, 1965) was an American journalist and television game show panelist. After spending two semesters at the College of New Rochelle, she started her career shortly before her 18th birthday as a reporter for the Hearst Corporation's \"New York Evening Journal\". In 1938, she began her newspaper column \"The Voice of Broadway\", which eventually was syndicated to more than 140 papers. In 1950, she became a regular panelist on the television game show \"What's My Line?\", continuing in the role until her death.\n\nKilgallen's columns featured mostly show business news and gossip, but ventured into other topics, such as politics and organized crime. She wrote front-page articles on the Sam Sheppard trial and later the John F. Kennedy assassination.\n\nKilgallen was born in Chicago, the daughter of newspaper reporter James Lawrence Kilgallen (1888–1982) and his wife, Mae Ahern (1888–1985). She was Roman Catholic. Dorothy had a sister, Eleanor (1919–2014), who was six years her junior. The family moved to various regions of the United States until 1920, when the International News Service hired James Kilgallen as a roving correspondent based in New York City. The family settled in Brooklyn, New York. Kilgallen was a student at Erasmus Hall High School. After completing two semesters at The College of New Rochelle, Kilgallen dropped out to take a job as a reporter for the \"New York Evening Journal\". The newspaper was owned and operated by the Hearst Corporation, which also owned International News Service, her father's employer.\n\nIn 1936 Kilgallen competed with two other New York newspaper reporters in a race around the world using only means of transportation available to the general public. She was the only woman to compete in the contest and came in second. She described the event in her book \"Girl Around The World\", which is credited as the story idea for the 1937 movie \"Fly-Away Baby\" starring Glenda Farrell as a character partly inspired by Kilgallen.\n\nIn November 1938, Kilgallen began writing a daily column, the \"Voice of Broadway,\" for Hearst's \"New York Journal-American\", which the corporation created by merging the \"Evening Journal\" with the \"American\". The column, which she wrote until her death in 1965, featured mostly New York show business news and gossip, but also ventured into other topics such as politics and organized crime. The column eventually was syndicated to 146 newspapers via King Features Syndicate. Its success motivated Kilgallen to move her parents and Eleanor from Brooklyn to Manhattan, where she continued to live with them until she got married.\n\nOn April 6, 1940, Kilgallen married Richard Kollmar, a musical comedy actor and singer who had starred in the Broadway show \"Knickerbocker Holiday\" and was performing, at the time of their wedding, in the Broadway cast of \"Too Many Girls\". They had three children, Jill (born 1941), Richard \"Dickie\" (b. 1943), and Kerry Kollmar (b. 1954), and remained married until Kilgallen's death.\n\nEarly in their marriage, both Kilgallen and Kollmar launched careers in network radio, Kilgallen with her radio program \"Voice of Broadway\", which was broadcast on CBS during World War II, and Kollmar with a long stint in the nationally syndicated crime drama in which he played Boston Blackie.\n\nBeginning in April 1945, Kilgallen and Kollmar co-hosted a WOR-AM radio talk show, \"Breakfast With Dorothy and Dick\", from their 16-room apartment at 640 Park Avenue. The show followed them when they bought a neo-Georgian brownstone at 45 East 68th Street in 1952. The radio program, like Kilgallen's newspaper column, mixed entertainment with serious issues. Kilgallen and Kollmar continued doing the show from their home until 1963, long after the terminations of other radio shows on which each had worked without the other.\n\nKilgallen was among the notables on the guest list of those who attended the coronation of Elizabeth II in 1953.\n\nKilgallen became a panelist on the American television game show \"What's My Line?\" in 1950 (its first broadcast), which was telecast from New York City on the CBS television network until 1967. She remained on the show for 15 years (until her death).\n\nThough Kilgallen and Frank Sinatra were fairly good friends for several years and were photographed rehearsing in a radio studio for a 1948 broadcast, they had a falling out after she wrote a multipart 1956 front-page feature story titled \"The Frank Sinatra Story.\" In addition to the \"New York Journal-American,\" Hearst-owned newspapers across the United States ran the story. Thereafter Sinatra made derogatory comments about Kilgallen's physical appearance to his audiences at nightclubs in New York and Las Vegas, though he stopped short of mentioning her name on television or during interviews for magazines and newspapers.\n\nKilgallen covered the 1954 murder trial of Sam Sheppard, a doctor (whose specialty was osteopathic neurosurgery) who was convicted of bludgeoning his wife to death at their home in the Cleveland suburb of Bay Village.\n\nThe \"New York Journal-American\" carried the banner front-page headline that she was \"astounded\" by the guilty verdict because of what she argued were serious flaws in the prosecution's case. At the time of the Cleveland jury's guilty verdict in December 1954, Kilgallen's sharp criticism of it was controversial and a Cleveland newspaper dropped her column in response. Her articles and columns in 1954 did not reveal all she had witnessed in the Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas. Nine years after the verdict and sentence, and after the judge had died, she claimed at an event held at the Overseas Press Club in New York, that the judge had told her before the start of jury selection that Sheppard was \"guilty as hell.\" \nAttorney F. Lee Bailey, who was working on a habeas corpus petition for his client Sheppard, attended the Overseas Press Club event, heard what Kilgallen told the crowd, and then asked her privately if she would help him. \"Some days later,\" as Bailey wrote in his memoir \"The Defense Never Rests\", \"we obtained a deposition from Dorothy that was inserted into the petition submitted to\" Carl Andrew Weinman, judge for the United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio. Bailey also included in the habeas corpus petition a statement from Edward Murray, who had worked in 1954 as a court clerk at the Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas. Similar to Kilgallen's statement, Murray's statement indicated that Edward J. Blythin, the original Sheppard judge, had declared Sheppard guilty even before the grand jury indicted him on August 17, 1954.\n\nIn July 1964, four months after the Overseas Press Club event where Kilgallen broke her silence about the deceased Judge Blythin, Judge Weinman of the federal court granted Bailey's \"habeas corpus\" petition, Sam Sheppard was released from prison amid much newspaper publicity, and Sheppard met Kilgallen at a \"late-night champagne party\" (as described by Bailey in \"The Defense Never Rests\") in Cleveland. After Kilgallen's death, Sheppard was retried and acquitted.\n\nIn 1964, Kilgallen was one of four witnesses who testified for the defense of comedian Lenny Bruce, during his trial on obscenity charges in New York City.\n\nKilgallen was publicly skeptical of the conclusions of the Warren Commission's report into the assassination of President Kennedy and wrote several newspaper articles on the subject. She obtained a copy of Jack Ruby's testimony to the Warren Commission, which she published in August 1964 on the front pages of the \"Journal American\", the \"Philadelphia Inquirer\", the \"Seattle Post-Intelligencer\", and other newspapers. Most of that testimony did not become officially available to the public until the commission released its 26 volumes of hearings and exhibits in November 1964, around the time of the first anniversary of the assassination.\n\nOn November 8, 1965, Kilgallen was found dead on the third floor of her five-story Manhattan townhouse. Her death was determined to have been caused by a fatal combination of alcohol and barbiturates. The autopsy ruled out a heart attack, which was a possibility that her father James Kilgallen—who was still working as a newspaper reporter at age 77—had raised when other reporters had interviewed him immediately after the discovery of her body.\n\nOn November 11, Kilgallen's parents, husband, and children were among nearly 2,600 people in attendance at her funeral Mass, held at St. Vincent Ferrer, her church. Among those attending were John Daly, Arlene Francis, Bennett Cerf, Steve Allen, Ed Sullivan, film producer Joseph E. Levine, Bob Considine, and Joan Crawford. Kilgallen was interred at Gate of Heaven Cemetery in New York.\nOn the following Sunday night telecast of \"What's My Line?\", seen live on November 14, \"To Tell the Truth\" regular panelist Kitty Carlisle, who had been a guest panelist on three previous episodes of \"What's My Line?\", temporarily filled in for Kilgallen. She said on-camera that although she was occupying Kilgallen's seat, \"no one could ever possibly take her place.\"\n\nKilgallen has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame on Hollywood Boulevard. The archives of the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce list her as one of the 500 people who were chosen to receive the first stars on the walk of fame. The stars were installed on sidewalks in 1960 and 1961, several years before she died. Ceremonies were not held for those who received stars prior to December 1968. During that month, Richard Zanuck became the first to be honored with a ceremony.\n\nKilgallen was friendly with Theo Wilson, an acclaimed newspaper reporter of murder trials. In Wilson's 1996 memoir, she wrote that Kilgallen's career was often overlooked during her lifetime and was forgotten after her death.\nPart of being a good reporter is to be anonymous, to stay out of the story so that you can better watch and study and listen to the principals. She couldn't do that, mostly because people wouldn't let her. She'd walk into a trial and the prosecutor would ask for her autograph for his wife or the judge would send out greetings.\n\n"}

He was the father of French writer Miguel Zamacoïs, and brother of the writer Niceto de Zamacois, the singer Elisa Zamacois and the actor Ricardo Zamacois, and also uncle of the writer Eduardo Zamacois.\n\nEduardo María Zamacois y Zabala was born in Bilbao, Spain. Son of Miguel Antonio de Zamacois y Berreteaga, and his second wife, Ruperta María del Pilar de Zabala y Arauco. His father was the founder and director of the Santiago de Vizcaya School of Humanities. His relatives included numerous artists: writers, actors and musicians. Of family of Basque ancestry, their surname originated in Hasparren, France, where their surname was spelled \"Samacoys\" at 18th century.\nHe received a thorough education, which included drawing classes with a local artist named Joaquín Balaca (c.1820-?). Later, when his father's school closed, the family moved to Madrid and, in 1856, he was enrolled at the Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando, where he studied with Federico de Madrazo.\n\nIn 1860, on Madrazo's recommendation, he went to Paris and attended the classes of Charles Gleyre in preparation for applying to the Ècole des Beaux-Arts. His application there was denied, so he turned to the workshops of Ernest Meissonier, where he found a position.\n\nA skillful business negotiator, he strove to gain access to as many European exhibitions as possible. Success came quickly. In 1861, he was commissioned to create decorative paintings in the quarters of the future king, Alfonso XII at the Palacio Real de Madrid. This work won him a grant from the , which enabled him to continue his studies. In 1862 and 1864, he was awarded medals at the National Exhibition of Fine Arts.\n\nHe was married in Paris in 1865, to Louise Marie Héloise Perrin, whom he had met at the home of his friend, Jehan Georges Vibert. They had two children: Miguel Louis Pascual, who became a well-known journalist and playwright, and a posthumous daughter, Marie Hélène, (who married the painter, Jean Alfred Marioton). \n\nIn 1866, he became good friends with the painter, Marià Fortuny, who did a portrait etching of him. During a trip to Rome, Zamacois also posed as a toreador for Fortuny's painting, \"The Spanish Wedding\". Later, he contacted his friend, , and put him in touch with Fortuny, which resulted in an exclusive contract with Goupil & Cie; a turning point in Fortuny's career.\n\nIn 1870, he was awarded the Gold Medal at the Salon for his painting, \"The Education of a Prince\". After a showing in London, one of his paintings was purchased by Charles Dickens.\n\nThe Franco-Prussian War created difficulties that eventually forced him to return to Madrid. His arrival there coincided with the official coronation of King Amadeus I, and he attended the ceremonies. It was an unusually cold winter and he became ill the following day. He died there suddenly, aged 29, of what was described as \"gangrenous angina\" (possibly Diphtheria).\n\nIn 1878, he was awarded a posthumous diploma by the Ècole des Beaux-Arts and a major retrospective at the Exposition Universelle. Goupil & Cie also published a large volume of photographs of his major works.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "9251", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9251", "title": "Engineering", "text": "Engineering\n\nEngineering is the creative application of science, mathematical methods, and empirical evidence to the innovation, design, construction, operation and maintenance of structures, machines, materials, devices, systems, processes, and organizations for the benefit of humankind. The discipline of engineering encompasses a broad range of more specialized fields of engineering, each with a more specific emphasis on particular areas of applied mathematics, applied science, and types of application. See glossary of engineering.\n\nThe term \"engineering\" is derived from the Latin \"ingenium\", meaning \"cleverness\" and \"ingeniare\", meaning \"to contrive, devise\".\n\nThe American Engineers' Council for Professional Development (ECPD, the predecessor of ABET) has defined \"engineering\" as:\nThe creative application of scientific principles to design or develop structures, machines, apparatus, or manufacturing processes, or works utilizing them singly or in combination; or to construct or operate the same with full cognizance of their design; or to forecast their behavior under specific operating conditions; all as respects an intended function, economics of operation and safety to life and property.\n\nEngineering has existed since ancient times, when humans devised inventions such as the wedge, lever, wheel and pulley.\n\nThe term \"engineering\" is derived from the word \"engineer\", which itself dates back to 1390 when an \"engine'er\" (literally, one who operates an \"engine\") referred to \"a constructor of military engines.\" In this context, now obsolete, an \"engine\" referred to a military machine, \"i.e.\", a mechanical contraption used in war (for example, a catapult). Notable examples of the obsolete usage which have survived to the present day are military engineering corps, \"e.g.\", the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.\n\nThe word \"engine\" itself is of even older origin, ultimately deriving from the Latin \"ingenium\" (c. 1250), meaning \"innate quality, especially mental power, hence a clever invention.\"\n\nLater, as the design of civilian structures, such as bridges and buildings, matured as a technical discipline, the term civil engineering entered the lexicon as a way to distinguish between those specializing in the construction of such non-military projects and those involved in the discipline of military engineering.\n\nThe pyramids in Egypt, the Acropolis and the Parthenon in Greece, the Roman aqueducts, Via Appia and the Colosseum, Teotihuacán, the Great Wall of China, the Brihadeeswarar Temple of Thanjavur, among many others, stand as a testament to the ingenuity and skill of ancient civil and military engineers. Other monuments, no longer standing, such as the Hanging Gardens of Babylon, and the Pharos of Alexandria were important engineering achievements of their time and were considered among the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World.\n\nThe earliest civil engineer known by name is Imhotep. As one of the officials of the Pharaoh, Djosèr, he probably designed and supervised the construction of the Pyramid of Djoser (the Step Pyramid) at Saqqara in Egypt around 2630–2611 BC.\nAncient Greece developed machines in both civilian and military domains. The Antikythera mechanism, the first known mechanical computer, and the mechanical inventions of Archimedes are examples of early mechanical engineering. Some of Archimedes' inventions as well as the Antikythera mechanism required sophisticated knowledge of differential gearing or epicyclic gearing, two key principles in machine theory that helped design the gear trains of the Industrial Revolution, and are still widely used today in diverse fields such as robotics and automotive engineering.\n\nAncient Chinese, Greek, Roman and Hungarian armies employed military machines and inventions such as artillery which was developed by the Greeks around the 4th century BC, the trireme, the ballista and the catapult. In the Middle Ages, the trebuchet was developed.\n\nBefore the development of modern engineering, mathematics was used by artisans and craftsmen, such as millwrights, clock makers, instrument makers and surveyors. Aside from these professions, universities were not believed to have had much practical significance to technology.\n\nA standard reference for the state of mechanical arts during the Renaissance is given in the mining engineering treatise \"De re metallica\" (1556), which also contains sections on geology, mining and chemistry. \"De re metallica\" was the standard chemistry reference for the next 180 years.\n\nThe science of classical mechanics, sometimes called Newtonian mechanics, formed the scientific basis of much of modern engineering. With the rise of engineering as a profession in the 18th century, the term became more narrowly applied to fields in which mathematics and science were applied to these ends. Similarly, in addition to military and civil engineering, the fields then known as the mechanic arts became incorporated into engineering.\n\nCanal building was an important engineering work during the early phases of the Industrial Revolution.\n\nJohn Smeaton was the first self-proclaimed civil engineer and is often regarded as the \"father\" of civil engineering. He was an English civil engineer responsible for the design of bridges, canals, harbours, and lighthouses. He was also a capable mechanical engineer and an eminent physicist. Using a model water wheel, Smeaton conducted experiments for seven years, determining ways to increase efficiency. Smeaton introduced iron axles and gears to water wheels. Smeaton also made mechanical improvements to the Newcomn steam engine. Smeaton designed the third Eddystone Lighthouse (1755–59) where he pioneered the use of 'hydraulic lime' (a form of mortar which will set under water) and developed a technique involving dovetailed blocks of granite in the building of the lighthouse. He is important in the history, rediscovery of, and development of modern cement, because he identified the compositional requirements needed to obtain \"hydraulicity\" in lime; work which led ultimately to the invention of Portland cement.\n\nApplied science lead to the development of the steam engine. The sequence of events began with the invention the barometer and the measurement of atmospheric pressure by Evangelista Torricelli in 1643, demonstration of the force of atmospheric pressure by Otto von Guericke using the Magdeburg hemispheres in 1656, laboratory experiments by Denis Papin, who built experimental model steam engines and demonstrated the use of a piston, which he published in 1707. Edward Somerset, 2nd Marquess of Worcester published a book of 100 inventions containing a method for raising waters similar to a coffee percolator. Samuel Morland, a mathematician and inventor who worked on pumps, left notes at the Vauxhall Ordinance Office on a steam pump design that Thomas Savery read. In 1698 Savery built a steam pump called “The Miner’s Friend.” It employed both vacuum and pressure. Iron merchant Thomas Newcomen, who built the first commercial piston steam engine in 1712, was not known to have any scientific training.\n\nThe application of steam powered cast iron blowing cylinders for providing pressurized air for blast furnaces lead to a large increase in iron production in the late 18th century. The higher furnace temperatures made possible with steam powered blast allowed for the use of more lime in blast furnaces, which enabled the transition from charcoal to coke. These innovations lowered the cost of iron, making horse railways and iron bridges practical. The puddling process, patented by Henry Cort in 1784 produced large scale quantities of wrought iron. Hot blast, patented by James Beaumont Neilson in 1828, greatly lowered the amount of fuel needed to smelt iron. With the development of the high pressure steam engine, the power to weight ratio of steam engines made practical steamboats and locomotives possible. New steel making processes, such as the Bessemer process and the open hearth furnace, ushered in an area of heavy engineering in the late 19th century.\n\nOne of the most famous engineers of the mid 19th century was Isambard Kingdom Brunel, who built railroads, dockyards and steamships.\n\nThe Industrial Revolution created a demand for machinery with metal parts, which led to the development of several machine tools. Boring cast iron cylinders with precision was not possible until John Wilkinson invented his boring machine, which is considered the first machine tool. Other machine tools included the screw cutting lathe, milling machine, turret lathe and the metal planer. Precision machining techniques were developed in the first half of the 19th century. These included the use of gigs to guide the machining tool over the work and fixtures to hold the work in the proper position. Machine tools and machining techniques capable of producing interchangeable parts lead to large scale factory production by the late 19th century.\n\nThe United States census of 1850 listed the occupation of \"engineer\" for the first time with a count of 2,000. There were fewer than 50 engineering graduates in the U.S. before 1865. In 1870 there were a dozen U.S. mechanical engineering graduates, with that number increasing to 43 per year in 1875. In 1890, there were 6,000 engineers in civil, mining, mechanical and electrical.\n\nThere was no chair of applied mechanism and applied mechanics at Cambridge until 1875, and no chair of engineering at Oxford until 1907. Germany established technical universities earlier.\n\nThe foundations of electrical engineering in the 1800s included the experiments of Alessandro Volta, Michael Faraday, Georg Ohm and others and the invention of the electric telegraph in 1816 and the electric motor in 1872. The theoretical work of James Maxwell (see: Maxwell's equations) and Heinrich Hertz in the late 19th century gave rise to the field of electronics. The later inventions of the vacuum tube and the transistor further accelerated the development of electronics to such an extent that electrical and electronics engineers currently outnumber their colleagues of any other engineering specialty.\nChemical engineering developed in the late nineteenth century. Industrial scale manufacturing demanded new materials and new processes and by 1880 the need for large scale production of chemicals was such that a new industry was created, dedicated to the development and large scale manufacturing of chemicals in new industrial plants. The role of the chemical engineer was the design of these chemical plants and processes.\n\nAeronautical engineering deals with aircraft design process design while aerospace engineering is a more modern term that expands the reach of the discipline by including spacecraft design. Its origins can be traced back to the aviation pioneers around the start of the 20th century although the work of Sir George Cayley has recently been dated as being from the last decade of the 18th century. Early knowledge of aeronautical engineering was largely empirical with some concepts and skills imported from other branches of engineering.\n\nThe first PhD in engineering (technically, \"applied science and engineering\") awarded in the United States went to Josiah Willard Gibbs at Yale University in 1863; it was also the second PhD awarded in science in the U.S.\n\nOnly a decade after the successful flights by the Wright brothers, there was extensive development of aeronautical engineering through development of military aircraft that were used in World War I. Meanwhile, research to provide fundamental background science continued by combining theoretical physics with experiments.\n\nEngineering is a broad discipline which is often broken down into several sub-disciplines. Although an engineer will usually be trained in a specific discipline, he or she may become multi-disciplined through experience. Engineering is often characterized as having four main branches: chemical engineering, civil engineering, electrical engineering, and mechanical engineering.\n\nChemical engineering is the application of physics, chemistry, biology, and engineering principles in order to carry out chemical processes on a commercial scale, such as the manufacture of commodity chemicals, specialty chemicals, petroleum refining, microfabrication, fermentation, and biomolecule production.\n\nCivil engineering is the design and construction of public and private works, such as infrastructure (airports, roads, railways, water supply, and treatment etc.), bridges, tunnels, dams, and buildings. Civil engineering is traditionally broken into a number of sub-disciplines, including structural engineering, environmental engineering, and surveying. It is traditionally considered to be separate from military engineering.\n\nElectrical engineering is the design, study, and manufacture of various electrical and electronic systems, such as Broadcast engineering, electrical circuits, generators, motors, electromagnetic/electromechanical devices, electronic devices, electronic circuits, optical fibers, optoelectronic devices, computer systems, telecommunications, instrumentation, controls, and electronics.\n\nMechanical engineering is the design and manufacture of physical or mechanical systems, such as power and energy systems, aerospace/aircraft products, weapon systems, transportation products, engines, compressors, powertrains, kinematic chains, vacuum technology, vibration isolation equipment, manufacturing, and mechatronics.\n\nBeyond these \"Big 4\", a number of other branches are recognized, though many can be thought of as sub-disciplines of the four major branches, or as cross-curricular disciplines among multiple. Historically, naval engineering and mining engineering were major branches. Other engineering fields are manufacturing engineering, acoustical engineering, corrosion engineering, instrumentation and control, aerospace, automotive, computer, electronic, information engineering, petroleum, environmental, systems, audio, software, architectural, agricultural, biosystems, biomedical, geological, textile, industrial, materials, and nuclear engineering. These and other branches of engineering are represented in the 36 licensed member institutions of the UK Engineering Council.\n\nNew specialties sometimes combine with the traditional fields and form new branches – for example, Earth systems engineering and management involves a wide range of subject areas including engineering studies, environmental science, engineering ethics and philosophy of engineering.\n\nOne who practices engineering is called an engineer, and those licensed to do so may have more formal designations such as Professional Engineer, Chartered Engineer, Incorporated Engineer, Ingenieur, European Engineer, or Designated Engineering Representative.\n\nIn the engineering design process, engineers apply mathematics and sciences such as physics to find novel solutions to problems or to improve existing solutions. More than ever, engineers are now required to have a proficient knowledge of relevant sciences for their design projects. As a result, many engineers continue to learn new material throughout their career.\n\nIf multiple solutions exist, engineers weigh each design choice based on their merit and choose the solution that best matches the requirements. The crucial and unique task of the engineer is to identify, understand, and interpret the constraints on a design in order to yield a successful result. It is generally insufficient to build a technically successful product, rather, it must also meet further requirements.\n\nConstraints may include available resources, physical, imaginative or technical limitations, flexibility for future modifications and additions, and other factors, such as requirements for cost, safety, marketability, productivity, and serviceability. By understanding the constraints, engineers derive specifications for the limits within which a viable object or system may be produced and operated.\n\nA general methodology and epistemology of engineering can be inferred from the historical case studies and comments provided by Walter Vincenti. Though Vincenti's case studies are from the domain of aeronautical engineering, his conclusions can be transferred into many other branches of engineering, too.\n\nAccording to Billy Vaughn Koen, the \"\"engineering method\" is the use of heuristics to cause the best change in a poorly understood situation within the available resources.\" Koen argues that the definition of what makes one an engineer should not be based on what she produces, but rather how she goes about it.\n\nEngineers use their knowledge of science, mathematics, logic, economics, and appropriate experience or tacit knowledge to find suitable solutions to a problem. Creating an appropriate mathematical model of a problem often allows them to analyze it (sometimes definitively), and to test potential solutions.\n\nUsually, multiple reasonable solutions exist, so engineers must evaluate the different design choices on their merits and choose the solution that best meets their requirements. Genrich Altshuller, after gathering statistics on a large number of patents, suggested that compromises are at the heart of \"low-level\" engineering designs, while at a higher level the best design is one which eliminates the core contradiction causing the problem.\n\nEngineers typically attempt to predict how well their designs will perform to their specifications prior to full-scale production. They use, among other things: prototypes, scale models, simulations, destructive tests, nondestructive tests, and stress tests. Testing ensures that products will perform as expected.\n\nEngineers take on the responsibility of producing designs that will perform as well as expected and will not cause unintended harm to the public at large. Engineers typically include a factor of safety in their designs to reduce the risk of unexpected failure. However, the greater the safety factor, the less efficient the design may be.\n\nThe study of failed products is known as forensic engineering and can help the product designer in evaluating his or her design in the light of real conditions. The discipline is of greatest value after disasters, such as bridge collapses, when careful analysis is needed to establish the cause or causes of the failure.\n\nAs with all modern scientific and technological endeavors, computers and software play an increasingly important role. As well as the typical business application software there are a number of computer aided applications (computer-aided technologies) specifically for engineering. Computers can be used to generate models of fundamental physical processes, which can be solved using numerical methods.\n\nOne of the most widely used design tools in the profession is computer-aided design (CAD) software like CATIA, Autodesk Inventor, DSS SolidWorks or Pro Engineer which enables engineers to create 3D models, 2D drawings, and schematics of their designs. CAD together with digital mockup (DMU) and CAE software such as finite element method analysis or analytic element method allows engineers to create models of designs that can be analyzed without having to make expensive and time-consuming physical prototypes.\n\nThese allow products and components to be checked for flaws; assess fit and assembly; study ergonomics; and to analyze static and dynamic characteristics of systems such as stresses, temperatures, electromagnetic emissions, electrical currents and voltages, digital logic levels, fluid flows, and kinematics. Access and distribution of all this information is generally organized with the use of product data management software.\n\nThere are also many tools to support specific engineering tasks such as computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) software to generate CNC machining instructions; manufacturing process management software for production engineering; EDA for printed circuit board (PCB) and circuit schematics for electronic engineers; MRO applications for maintenance management; and Architecture, engineering and construction (AEC) software for civil engineering.\n\nIn recent years the use of computer software to aid the development of goods has collectively come to be known as product lifecycle management (PLM).\n\nThe engineering profession engages in a wide range of activities, from large collaboration at the societal level, and also smaller individual projects. Almost all engineering projects are obligated to some sort of financing agency: a company, a set of investors, or a government. The few types of engineering that are minimally constrained by such issues are \"pro bono\" engineering and open-design engineering.\n\nBy its very nature engineering has interconnections with society, culture and human behavior. Every product or construction used by modern society is influenced by engineering. The results of engineering activity influence changes to the environment, society and economies, and its application brings with it a responsibility and public safety.\n\nEngineering projects can be subject to controversy. Examples from different engineering disciplines include the development of nuclear weapons, the Three Gorges Dam, the design and use of sport utility vehicles and the extraction of oil. In response, some western engineering companies have enacted serious corporate and social responsibility policies.\n\nEngineering is a key driver of innovation and human development. Sub-Saharan Africa, in particular, has a very small engineering capacity which results in many African nations being unable to develop crucial infrastructure without outside aid. The attainment of many of the Millennium Development Goals requires the achievement of sufficient engineering capacity to develop infrastructure and sustainable technological development.\n\nAll overseas development and relief NGOs make considerable use of engineers to apply solutions in disaster and development scenarios. A number of charitable organizations aim to use engineering directly for the good of mankind:\n\nEngineering companies in many established economies are facing significant challenges with regard to the number of professional engineers being trained, compared with the number retiring. This problem is very prominent in the UK where engineering has a poor image and low status. There are many negative economic and political issues that this can cause, as well as ethical issues. It is widely agreed that the engineering profession faces an \"image crisis\", rather than it being fundamentally an unattractive career. Much work is needed to avoid huge problems in the UK and other western economies.\n\nMany engineering societies have established codes of practice and codes of ethics to guide members and inform the public at large. The National Society of Professional Engineers code of ethics states:\nIn Canada, many engineers wear the Iron Ring as a symbol and reminder of the obligations and ethics associated with their profession.\n\nThere exists an overlap between the sciences and engineering practice; in engineering, one applies science. Both areas of endeavor rely on accurate observation of materials and phenomena. Both use mathematics and classification criteria to analyze and communicate observations.\n\nScientists may also have to complete engineering tasks, such as designing experimental apparatus or building prototypes. Conversely, in the process of developing technology engineers sometimes find themselves exploring new phenomena, thus becoming, for the moment, scientists or more precisely \"engineering scientists\".\n\nIn the book \"What Engineers Know and How They Know It\", Walter Vincenti asserts that engineering research has a character different from that of scientific research. First, it often deals with areas in which the basic physics or chemistry are well understood, but the problems themselves are too complex to solve in an exact manner.\n\nThere is a \"real and important\" difference between engineering and physics as similar to any science field has to do with technology. Physics is an exploratory science that seeks knowledge of principles while engineering uses knowledge for practical applications of principles. The former equates an understanding into a mathematical principle while the latter measures variables involved and creates technology. For technology, physics is an auxiliary and in a way technology is considered as applied physics. Though physics and engineering are interrelated, it does not mean that a physicist is trained to do an engineer's job. A physicist would typically require additional and relevant training. Physicists and engineers engage in different lines of work. But PhD physicists who specialize in sectors of technology and applied science are titled as Technology officer, R&D Engineers and System Engineers.\n\nAn example of this is the use of numerical approximations to the Navier–Stokes equations to describe aerodynamic flow over an aircraft, or the use of Miner's rule to calculate fatigue damage. Second, engineering research employs many semi-empirical methods that are foreign to pure scientific research, one example being the method of parameter variation.\n\nAs stated by Fung \"et al.\" in the revision to the classic engineering text \"Foundations of Solid Mechanics\":\n\nEngineering is quite different from science. Scientists try to understand nature. Engineers try to make things that do not exist in nature. Engineers stress innovation and invention. To embody an invention the engineer must put his idea in concrete terms, and design something that people can use. That something can be a complex system, device, a gadget, a material, a method, a computing program, an innovative experiment, a new solution to a problem, or an improvement on what already exists. Since a design has to be realistic and functional, it must have its geometry, dimensions, and characteristics data defined. In the past engineers working on new designs found that they did not have all the required information to make design decisions. Most often, they were limited by insufficient scientific knowledge. Thus they studied mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology and mechanics. Often they had to add to the sciences relevant to their profession. Thus engineering sciences were born.\n\nAlthough engineering solutions make use of scientific principles, engineers must also take into account safety, efficiency, economy, reliability, and constructability or ease of fabrication as well as the environment, ethical and legal considerations such as patent infringement or liability in the case of failure of the solution.\n\nThe study of the human body, albeit from different directions and for different purposes, is an important common link between medicine and some engineering disciplines. Medicine aims to sustain, repair, enhance and even replace functions of the human body, if necessary, through the use of technology.\nModern medicine can replace several of the body's functions through the use of artificial organs and can significantly alter the function of the human body through artificial devices such as, for example, brain implants and pacemakers. The fields of bionics and medical bionics are dedicated to the study of synthetic implants pertaining to natural systems.\n\nConversely, some engineering disciplines view the human body as a biological machine worth studying and are dedicated to emulating many of its functions by replacing biology with technology. This has led to fields such as artificial intelligence, neural networks, fuzzy logic, and robotics. There are also substantial interdisciplinary interactions between engineering and medicine.\n\nBoth fields provide solutions to real world problems. This often requires moving forward before phenomena are completely understood in a more rigorous scientific sense and therefore experimentation and empirical knowledge is an integral part of both.\n\nMedicine, in part, studies the function of the human body. The human body, as a biological machine, has many functions that can be modeled using engineering methods.\n\nThe heart for example functions much like a pump, the skeleton is like a linked structure with levers, the brain produces electrical signals etc. These similarities as well as the increasing importance and application of engineering principles in medicine, led to the development of the field of biomedical engineering that uses concepts developed in both disciplines.\n\nNewly emerging branches of science, such as systems biology, are adapting analytical tools traditionally used for engineering, such as systems modeling and computational analysis, to the description of biological systems.\n\nThere are connections between engineering and art, for example, architecture, landscape architecture and industrial design (even to the extent that these disciplines may sometimes be included in a university's Faculty of Engineering).\n\nThe Art Institute of Chicago, for instance, held an exhibition about the art of NASA's aerospace design. Robert Maillart's bridge design is perceived by some to have been deliberately artistic. At the University of South Florida, an engineering professor, through a grant with the National Science Foundation, has developed a course that connects art and engineering.\n\nAmong famous historical figures, Leonardo da Vinci is a well-known Renaissance artist and engineer, and a prime example of the nexus between art and engineering.\n\nBusiness Engineering deals with the relationship between professional engineering, IT systems, business administration and change management. Engineering management or \"Management engineering\" is a specialized field of management concerned with engineering practice or the engineering industry sector. The demand for management-focused engineers (or from the opposite perspective, managers with an understanding of engineering), has resulted in the development of specialized engineering management degrees that develop the knowledge and skills needed for these roles. During an engineering management course, students will develop industrial engineering skills, knowledge, and expertise, alongside knowledge of business administration, management techniques, and strategic thinking. Engineers specializing in change management must have in-depth knowledge of the application of industrial and organizational psychology principles and methods. Professional engineers often train as certified management consultants in the very specialized field of management consulting applied to engineering practice or the engineering sector. This work often deals with large scale complex business transformation or Business process management initiatives in aerospace and defence, automotive, oil and gas, machinery, pharmaceutical, food and beverage, electrical & electronics, power distribution & generation, utilities and transportation systems. This combination of technical engineering practice, management consulting practice, industry sector knowledge, and change management expertise enables professional engineers who are also qualified as management consultants to lead major business transformation initiatives. These initiatives are typically sponsored by C-level executives.\n\nIn political science, the term \"engineering\" has been borrowed for the study of the subjects of social engineering and political engineering, which deal with forming political and social structures using engineering methodology coupled with political science principles. Financial engineering has similarly borrowed the term.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "436824", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=436824", "title": "Gerontology", "text": "Gerontology\n\nGerontology is the study of the social, cultural, psychological, cognitive, and biological aspects of ageing. The word was coined by Ilya Ilyich Mechnikov in 1903, from the Greek γέρων, \"geron\", \"old man\" and -λογία, \"-logia\", \"study of\". The field is distinguished from geriatrics, which is the branch of medicine that specializes in the treatment of existing disease in older adults. Gerontologists include researchers and practitioners in the fields of biology, nursing, medicine, criminology, dentistry, social work, physical and occupational therapy, psychology, psychiatry, sociology, economics, political science, architecture, geography, pharmacy, public health, housing, and anthropology.\n\nThe multidisciplinary nature of gerontology means that there are a number of sub-fields which overlap with gerontology. There are policy issues, for example, involved in government planning and the operation of nursing homes, investigating the effects of an ageing population on society, and the design of residential spaces for older people that facilitate the development of a sense of place or home. Dr. Lawton, a behavioral psychologist at the Philadelphia Geriatric Center, was among the first to recognize the need for living spaces designed to accommodate the elderly, especially those with Alzheimer's disease. As an academic discipline the field is relatively new. The USC Leonard Davis School created the first PhD, master's and bachelor's degree programs in gerontology in 1975.\n\nIn the medieval Islamic world, several physicians wrote on issues related to Gerontology. Avicenna's \"The Canon of Medicine\" (1025) offered instruction for the care of the aged, including diet and remedies for problems including constipation. Arabic physician Ibn Al-Jazzar Al-Qayrawani (Algizar, c. 898–980) wrote on the aches and conditions of the elderly (Ammar 1998, p. 4). His scholarly work covers sleep disorders, forgetfulness, how to strengthen memory, and causes of mortality Ishaq ibn Hunayn (died 910) also wrote works on the treatments for forgetfulness (U.S. National Library of Medicine, 1994).\n\nWhile the number of aged humans, and the life expectancy, tended to increase in every century since the 14th, society tended to consider caring for an elderly relative as a family issue. It was not until the coming of the Industrial Revolution that ideas shifted in favor of a societal care-system. Some early pioneers, such as Michel Eugène Chevreul, who himself lived to be 102, believed that aging itself should be a science to be studied. Élie Metchnikoff coined the term \"gerontology\" 1903.\n\nModern pioneers like James Birren began organizing gerontology as its own field in the 1940s, later being involved in starting a US government agency on aging – the National Institute on Aging – programs in gerontology at the University of Southern California and University of California, Los Angeles, and as past president of the Gerontological Society of America (founded in 1945).\n\nWith the population of people over 60 years old expected to be some 22% of the world's population by 2050, assessment and treatment methods for age-related disease burden – the term \"geroscience\" emerged in the early 21st century.\n\nThe world is forecast to undergo rapid population aging in the next several decades. In 1900, there were 3.1 million people aged 65 years and older living in the United States. However, this population continued to grow throughout the 20th century and reached 31.2, 35, and 40.3 million people in 1990, 2000, and 2010, respectively. Notably, in the United States and across the world, the \"baby boomer\" generation began to turn 65 in 2011. Recently, the population aged 65 years and older has grown at a faster rate than the total population in the United States. The total population increased by 9.7%, from 281.4 million to 308.7 million, between 2000 and 2010. However, the population aged 65 years and older increased by 15.1% during the same period. It has been estimated that 25% of the population in the United States and Canada will be aged 65 years and older by 2025. Moreover, by 2050, it is predicted that, for the first time in United States history, the number of individuals aged 60 years and older will be greater than the number of children aged 0 to 14 years. Those aged 85 years and older (oldest-old) are projected to increase from 5.3 million to 21 million by 2050. Adults aged 85–89 years constituted the greatest segment of the oldest-old in 1990, 2000, and 2010. However, the largest percentage point increase among the oldest-old occurred in the 90- to 94-year-old age group, which increased from 25.0% in 1990 to 26.4% in 2010.\n\nWith the rapid growth of the aging population, social work education and training specialized in older adults and practitioners interested in working with older adults are increasingly in demand.\n\nThere has been a considerable disparity between the number of men and women in the older population in the United States. In both 2000 and 2010, women outnumbered men in the older population at every single year of age (e.g., 65 to 100 years and over). The sex ratio, which is a measure used to indicate the balance of males to females in a population, is calculated by taking the number of males divided by the number of females, and multiplying by 100. Therefore, the sex ratio is the number of males per 100 females. In 2010, there were 90.5 males per 100 females in the 65-year-old population. However, this represented an increase from 1990 when there were 82.7 males per 100 females, and from 2000 when the sex ratio was 88.1. Although the gender gap between men and women has narrowed, women continue to have a greater life expectancy and lower mortality rates at older ages relative to men. For example, the Census 2010 reported that there were approximately twice as many women as men living in the United States at 89 years of age (361,309 versus 176,689, respectively).\n\nThe number and percentage of older adults living in the United States vary across the four different regions (Northeast, Midwest, West, and South) defined by the United States census. In 2010, the South contained the greatest number of people aged 65 years and older and 85 years and older. However, proportionately, the Northeast contains the largest percentage of adults aged 65 years and older (14.1%), followed by the Midwest (13.5%), the South (13.0%), and the West (11.9%). Relative to the Census 2000, all geographic regions demonstrated positive growth in the population of adults aged 65 years and older and 85 years and older. The most rapid growth in the population of adults aged 65 years and older was evident in the West (23.5%), which showed an increase from 6.9 million in 2000 to 8.5 million in 2010. Likewise, in the population aged 85 years and older, the West (42.8%) also showed the fastest growth and increased from 806,000 in 2000 to 1.2 million in 2010. It is worth highlighting that Rhode Island was the only state that experienced a reduction in the number of people aged 65 years and older, and declined from 152,402 in 2000 to 151,881 in 2010. Conversely, all states exhibited an increase in the population of adults aged 85 years and older from 2000 to 2010.\n\nBiogerontology is the sub-field of gerontology concerned with the biological aging process, its evolutionary origins, and potential means to intervene in the process. It involves interdisciplinary research on biological aging's causes, effects, and mechanisms. Conservative biogerontologists such as Leonard Hayflick have predicted that the human life expectancy will peak at about 92 years old, while others such as James Vaupel have predicted that in industrialized countries, life expectancies will reach 100 for children born after the year 2000. and some surveyed biogerontologists have predicted life expectancies of two or more centuries. with Aubrey de Grey offering the \"tentative timeframe\" that with adequate funding of research to develop interventions in aging such as Strategies for Engineered Negligible Senescence, \"we have a 50/50 chance of developing technology within about 25 to 30 years from now that will, under reasonable assumptions about the rate of subsequent improvements in that technology, allow us to stop people from dying of aging at any age\", leading to life expectancies of 1,000 years.\n\nBiomedical gerontology, also known as experimental gerontology and life extension, is a sub-discipline of biogerontology that endeavors to slow, prevent, and even reverse aging in both humans and animals. Most \"life extensionists\" believe the human life span can be increased within the next century, if not sooner. Biogerontologists vary in the degree to which they focus on the study of the aging process as a means of mitigating the diseases of aging or extending lifespan, although most agree that extension of lifespan will necessarily flow from reductions in age-related disease and frailty, although some argue that maximum life span cannot be altered or that it is undesirable to try. Geroscience is a recently formulated interdisciplinary field that embraces biomedical gerontology as the center of preventing diseases of aging through science.\n\nIn contrast with biogerontology, which aims to prevent age-related disease by intervening in aging processes, geriatrics is a field of medicine that studies the treatment of existing disease in aging people.\n\nThere are numerous theories of aging, and no one theory has been accepted. There is a wide spectrum of the types of theories for the causes of aging with programmed theories on one extreme and error theories on the other. Regardless of the theory, a commonality is that as humans age, functions of the body decline.\n\nStochastic theories of aging is the suggestion that aging is caused by small changes in the body over time and the body's failure to restore the system and mend the damages to the body. The cells and tissues are eventually injured due to the damage gathered over time. This causes the diminishes in an organ's function related to age. The notion of accumulated damage was first introduced by Weisman as the \"wear and tear\" theory.\n\nWear and tear theories of aging suggest that as an individual ages, body parts such as cells and organs wear out from continued use. Wearing of the body can be attributable to internal or external causes that eventually lead to an accumulation of insults which surpasses the capacity for repair. Due to these internal and external insults, cells lose their ability to regenerate, which ultimately leads to mechanical and chemical exhaustion. Some insults include chemicals in the air, food, or smoke. Other insults may be things such as viruses, trauma, free radicals, cross-linking, and high body temperature.\n\nAccumulation theories of aging suggest that aging is bodily decline that results from an accumulation of elements, whether introduced to the body from the environment or resulting from cell metabolism. An example of an accumulation theory is the Free Radical Theory of Aging.\n\nFree radicals are reactive molecules produced by cellular and environmental processes, and can damage the elements of the cell such as the cell membrane and DNA and cause irreversible damage. The free-radical theory of aging proposes that this damage cumulatively degrades the biological function of cells and impacts the process of aging. The idea that free radicals are toxic agents was first proposed by Rebeca Gerschman and colleagues in 1945, but came to prominence in 1956, when Denham Harman proposed the free-radical theory of aging and even demonstrated that free radical reactions contribute to the degradation of biological systems. Oxidative damage of many types accumulate with age, such as oxidative stress that oxygen-free radicals, because the free radical theory of aging argues that aging results from the damage generated by reactive oxygen species (ROS). ROS are small, highly reactive, oxygen-containing molecules that can damage a complex of cellular components such as fat, proteins, or from DNA, they are naturally generated in small amounts during the body's metabolic reactions. These conditions become more common as humans grow older and include diseases related to aging, such as dementia, cancer and heart disease.\n\nDNA damage has been one of the many causes in diseases related to aging. The stability of the genome is defined by the cells machinery of repair, damage tolerance, and checkpoint pathways that counteracts DNA damage. One hypothesis proposed by Gioacchino Failla in 1958 is that damage accumulation to the DNA causes aging. The hypothesis was developed soon by physicist Leó Szilárd. This theory has changed over the years as new research has discovered new types of DNA damage and mutations, and several theories of aging argue that DNA damage with or without mutations causes aging.\n\nThe cross-linking theory proposes that advanced glycation end-products (stable bonds formed by the binding of glucose to proteins) and other aberrant cross-links accumulating in aging tissues is the cause of aging. The crosslinking of proteins disables their biological functions. The hardening of the connective tissue, kidney diseases, and enlargement of the heart are connected to the cross-linking of proteins. Crosslinking of DNA can induce replication errors, and this leads to deformed cells and increases the risk of cancer.\n\nGenetic theories of aging propose that aging is programmed within each individual's genes. According to this theory, genes dictate cellular longevity. Programmed cell death, or apoptosis, is determined by a \"biological clock\" via genetic information in the nucleus of the cell. Genes responsible for apoptosis provide an explanation for cell death, but are less applicable to death of an entire organism. An increase in cellular apoptosis may correlate to aging, but is not a 'cause of death'. Environmental factors and genetic mutations can influence gene expression and accelerate aging. More recently epigenetics have been explored as a contributing factor. The epigenetic clock, which objectively measures the biological age of cells and tissues, may become useful for testing different biological aging theories.\n\nGeneral imbalance theories of aging suggest that body systems, such as the endocrine, nervous, and immune systems, gradually decline and ultimately fail to function. The rate of failure varies system by system.\n\nThe immunological theory of aging suggests that the immune system weakens as an organism ages. This makes the organism unable to fight infections and less able to destroy old and neoplastic cells. This leads to aging and will eventually lead to death. This theory of aging was developed by Ray Walford, an American gerontologist. According to Walford, incorrect immunological procedures are the cause of the process of aging.\n\nSocial gerontology is a multi-disciplinary sub-field that specializes in studying or working with older adults. Social gerontologists may have degrees or training in social work, nursing, psychology, sociology, demography, public health, or other social science disciplines. Social gerontologists are responsible for educating, researching, and advancing the broader causes of older people.\n\nBecause issues of life span and life extension need numbers to quantify them, there is an overlap with demography. Those who study the demography of the human life span differ from those who study the social demographics of aging.\n\nSeveral theories of aging are developed to observe the aging process of older adults in society as well as how these processes are interpreted by men and women as they age.\n\nActivity theory was developed and elaborated by Cavan, Havighurst, and Albrecht. According to this theory, older adults' self-concept depends on social interactions. In order for older adults to maintain morale in old age, substitutions must be made for lost roles. Examples of lost roles include retirement from a job or loss of a spouse.\n\nActivity is preferable to inactivity because it facilitates well-being on multiple levels. Because of improved general health and prosperity in the older population, remaining active is more feasible now than when this theory was first proposed by Havighurst nearly six decades ago. The activity theory is applicable for a stable, post-industrial society, which offers its older members many opportunities for meaningful participation.Weakness: Some aging persons cannot maintain a middle-aged lifestyle, due to functional limitations, lack of income, or lack of a desire to do so. Many older adults lack the resources to maintain active roles in society. On the flip side, some elders may insist on continuing activities in late life that pose a danger to themselves and others, such as driving at night with low visual acuity or doing maintenance work to the house while climbing with severely arthritic knees. In doing so, they are denying their limitations and engaging in unsafe behaviors.\n\nDisengagement theory was developed by Cumming and Henry. According to this theory, older adults and society engage in a mutual separation from each other. An example of mutual separation is retirement from the workforce. A key assumption of this theory is that older adults lose \"ego-energy\" and become increasingly self-absorbed. Additionally, disengagement leads to higher morale maintenance than if older adults try to maintain social involvement. This theory is heavily criticized for having an escape clause - namely, that older adults who remain engaged in society are unsuccessful adjusters to old age.\n\nGradual withdrawal from society and relationships preserves social equilibrium and promotes self-reflection for elders who are freed from societal roles. It furnishes an orderly means for the transfer of knowledge, capital, and power from the older generation to the young. It makes it possible for society to continue functioning after valuable older members die.\n\nContinuity theory is an elusive concept. On one hand,\nto exhibit continuity can mean to remain the same, to\nbe uniform, homogeneous, unchanging, even humdrum.\nThis static view of continuity is not very applicable\nto human aging. On the other hand, a dynamic\nview of continuity starts with the idea of a basic\nstructure which persists over time, but it allows for a\nvariety of changes to occur within the context provided\nby the basic structure. The basic structure is\ncoherent: It has an orderly or logical relation of parts\nthat is recognizably unique and that allows us to\ndifferentiate that structure from others. With the\nintroduction of the concept of time, ideas such as\ndirection, sequence, character development, and\nstory line enter into the concept of continuity as it is\napplied to the evolution of a human being. In this\ntheory, a dynamic concept of continuity is developed\nand applied to the issue of adaptation to normal\naging.\n\nA central premise of continuity theory is that, in\nmaking adaptive choices, middle-aged and older\nadults attempt to preserve and maintain existing internal\nand external structures and that they prefer to\naccomplish this objective by using continuity (i.e.,\napplying familiar strategies in familiar arenas of life).\nIn middle and later life, adults are drawn by the\nweight of past experience to use continuity as a\nprimary adaptive strategy for dealing with changes\nassociated with normal aging. To the extent that\nchange builds upon, and has links to, the person's\npast, change is a part of continuity. As a result of both\ntheir own perceptions and pressures from the social\nenvironment, individuals who are adapting to normal\naging are both predisposed and motivated\ntoward inner psychological continuity as well as outward\ncontinuity of social behavior and circumstances.\n\nContinuity theory views both internal and\nexternal continuity as robust adaptive strategies that\nare supported by both individual preference and\nsocial sanctions. Continuity theory consists of general\nadaptive principles that people who are normally \naging could be expected to follow, explanations of\nhow these principles work, and a specification of\ngeneral areas of life in which these principles could\nbe expected to apply. Accordingly, continuity theory\nhas enormous potential as a general theory of\nadaptation to individual aging.\n\nAccording to this theory, older adults born during different time periods form cohorts that define \"age strata\". There are two differences among strata: chronological age and historical experience. This theory makes two arguments. 1. Age is a mechanism for regulating behavior and as a result determines access to positions of power. 2. Birth cohorts play an influential role in the process of social change.\n\nAccording to this theory, which stems from the Life Course Perspective (Bengston and Allen, 1993), aging occurs from birth to death. Aging involves social, psychological, and biological processes. Additionally, aging experiences are shaped by cohort and period effects.\n\nAlso reflecting the life course focus,\nconsider the implications for how societies might function when age-based\nnorms vanish—a consequence of the deinstitutionalization of the life course—\nand suggest that these implications pose new challenges for theorizing aging\nand the life course in postindustrial societies. Dramatic reductions in mortality,\nmorbidity, and fertility over the past several decades have so shaken up the\norganization of the life course and the nature of educational, work, family, and\nleisure experiences that it is now possible for individuals to become old in new\nways. The configurations and content of other life stages are being altered as\nwell, especially for women. In consequence, theories of age and aging will need\nto be reconceptualized.\n\nAccording to this theory, which was developed beginning in the 1960s by Derek Price and Robert Merton and elaborated on by several researchers such as Dale Dannefer, inequalities have a tendency to become more pronounced throughout the aging process. A paradigm of this theory can be expressed in the adage \"the rich get richer and the poor get poorer\". Advantages and disadvantages in early life stages have a profound effect throughout the life span. However, advantages and disadvantages in middle adulthood have a direct influence on economic and health status in later life.\n\nEnvironmental gerontology is a specialization within gerontology that seeks an understanding and interventions to optimize the relationship between aging persons and their physical and social environments.\n\nThe field emerged in the 1930s during the first studies on behavioral and social gerontology. In the 1970s and 1980s, research confirmed the importance of the physical and social environment in understanding the aging population and improved the quality of life in old age. Studies of environmental gerontology indicate that older people prefer to age in their immediate environment, whereas spatial experience and place attachment are important for understanding the process.\n\nSome research indicates that the physical-social environment is related to the longevity and quality of life of the elderly. Precisely, the natural environment (such as natural therapeutic landscapes, therapeutic garden) contributes to active and healthy aging in the place.\n\nJurisprudential gerontology (sometimes referred to as \"geriatric jurisprudence\") is a specialization within gerontology that looks into the ways laws and legal structures interact with the aging experience. The field started from legal scholars in the field of elder law, which found that looking into legal issues of older persons without a broader inter-disciplinary perspective does not provide the ideal legal outcome. Using theories such as therapeutic jurisprudence, jurisprudential scholars critically examined existing legal institutions (e.g. adult guardianship, end of life care, or nursing homes regulations) and showed how law should look more closely to the social and psychological aspects of its real-life operation. Other streams within jurisprudential gerontology also encouraged physicians and lawyers to try to improve their cooperation and better understand how laws and regulatory institutions affect health and well being of older persons.\n"}

The name \"giant panda\" is sometimes used to distinguish it from the unrelated red panda. Though it belongs to the order Carnivora, the giant panda's diet is over 99% bamboo. Giant pandas in the wild will occasionally eat other grasses, wild tubers, or even meat in the form of birds, rodents, or carrion. In captivity, they may receive honey, eggs, fish, yams, shrub leaves, oranges, or bananas along with specially prepared food.\n\nThe giant panda lives in a few mountain ranges in central China, mainly in Sichuan, but also in neighbouring Shaanxi and Gansu. As a result of farming, deforestation, and other development, the giant panda has been driven out of the lowland areas where it once lived.\n\nThe giant panda is a conservation reliant vulnerable species. A 2007 report showed 239 pandas living in captivity inside China and another 27 outside the country. As of December 2014, 49 giant pandas lived in captivity outside China, living in 18 zoos in 13 different countries. Wild population estimates vary; one estimate shows that there are about 1,590 individuals living in the wild, while a 2006 study via DNA analysis estimated that this figure could be as high as 2,000 to 3,000. Some reports also show that the number of giant pandas in the wild is on the rise. In March 2015, Mongabay stated that the wild giant panda population had increased by 268, or 16.8%, to 1,864. In 2016, the IUCN reclassified the species from \"endangered\" to \"vulnerable\".\n\nWhile the dragon has often served as China's national symbol, internationally the giant panda appears at least as commonly. As such, it is becoming widely used within China in international contexts, for example since 1982 issuing gold panda bullion coins or as one of the five Fuwa mascots of the Beijing Olympics.\n\nFor many decades, the precise taxonomic classification of the giant panda was under debate because it shares characteristics with both bears and raccoons. However, molecular studies indicate the giant panda is a true bear, part of the family Ursidae. These studies show it differentiated early (about 19 million years ago) from the main ursine stock; since it is the most basal member of the group, it is equidistant from all other extant ursids. The giant panda has been referred to as a living fossil.\n\nDespite the shared name, habitat type, and diet, as well as a unique enlarged bone called the \"pseudo thumb\" (which helps them grip the bamboo shoots they eat) the giant panda and red panda are only distantly related.\n\nThe word \"panda\" was borrowed into English from French, but no conclusive explanation of the origin of the French word \"panda\" has been found. The closest candidate is the Nepali word \"ponya,\" possibly referring to the adapted wrist bone of the red panda, which is native to Nepal. The Western world originally applied this name to the red panda. Until 1901, when it was erroneously stated to be related to the red panda, the giant panda was known as \"black and white cat-footed animal\" (\"Ailuropus melanoleucus\").\n\nIn many older encyclopedic sources, the name \"panda\" or \"common panda\" originally referred to the lesser-known red panda, thus necessitating the inclusion of \"giant\" and \"lesser/red\" prefixes in front of the names. Even in 2013, the \"Encyclopædia Britannica\" still used \"giant panda\" or \"panda bear\" for the bear, and simply \"panda\" for the Ailuridae, despite the popular usage of the word \"panda\".\n\nSince the earliest collection of Chinese writings, the Chinese language has given the bear 20 different names, such as \"huāxióng\" ( \"spotted bear\") and \"zhúxióng\" ( \"bamboo bear\"). The most popular names in China today is \"dàxióngmāo\" ( literally \"giant bear cat\"), or simply \"xióngmāo\" ( \"bear cat\"). The name \"xióngmāo\" ( \"bear cat\") was originally used to describe the red panda (\"Ailurus fulgens\"), but since giant panda was thought to be closely related to red panda, \"dàxióngmāo\" () was named relatively.\n\nIn Taiwan, another popular name for panda is the inverted \"dàmāoxióng\" ( \"giant cat bear\"), though many encyclopediae and dictionaries in Taiwan still use the \"bear cat\" form as the correct name. Some linguists argue, in this construction, \"bear\" instead of \"cat\" is the base noun, making this name more grammatically and logically correct, which may have led to the popular choice despite official writings. This name did not gain its popularity until 1988, when a private zoo in Tainan painted a sun bear black and white and created the Tainan fake panda incident.\n\nTwo subspecies of giant panda have been recognized on the basis of distinct cranial measurements, color patterns, and population genetics.\n\nA detailed study of the giant panda's genetic history from 2012 confirms that the separation of the Qinlin population occurred about 300,000 years ago, and reveals that the non-Qinlin population further diverged into two groups, named the Minshan and the Qionglai-Daxiangling-Xiaoxiangling-Liangshan group respectively, about 2,800 years ago.\n\nThe giant panda has luxuriant black-and-white fur. Adults measure around long, including a tail of about , and tall at the shoulder. Males can weigh up to . Females (generally 10–20% smaller than males) can weigh as little as , but can also weigh up to . Average adult weight is .\n\nThe giant panda has a body shape typical of bears. It has black fur on its ears, eye patches, muzzle, legs, arms and shoulders. The rest of the animal's coat is white. Although scientists do not know why these unusual bears are black and white, speculation suggests that the bold coloring provides effective camouflage in their shade-dappled snowy and rocky habitat. The giant panda's thick, wooly coat keeps it warm in the cool forests of its habitat. The panda's skull shape is typical of durophagous carnivorans. It has evolved from previous ancestors to exhibit larger molars with increased complexity and expanded temporal fossa. A 110.45 kg (243.5 lb) giant panda has a 3D canine teeth bite force of 2603.47 newtons and bite force quotient of 292. Another study had a 117.5 kg (259 lb) giant panda bite of 1298.9 newtons (BFQ 151.4) at canine teeth and 1815.9 newtons (BFQ 141.8) at carnassial teeth.\nThe giant panda's paw has a \"thumb\" and five fingers; the \"thumb\" – actually a modified sesamoid bone – helps it to hold bamboo while eating. Stephen Jay Gould discusses this feature in his book of essays on evolution and biology, \"The Panda's Thumb\".\n\nThe giant panda's tail, measuring , is the second-longest in the bear family. (The longest belongs to the sloth bear.)\n\nThe giant panda typically lives around 20 years in the wild and up to 30 years in captivity. A female named Jia Jia was the oldest giant panda ever in captivity, born in 1978 and died at an age of 38 on 16 October 2016.\n\nA seven-year-old female named Jin Yi died in 2014 in a zoo in Zhengzhou, China, after showing symptoms of gastroenteritis and respiratory disease. It was found that the cause of death was toxoplasmosis, a disease caused by \"Toxoplasma gondii\" and infecting most warm-blooded animals, including humans.\n\nThe giant panda genome was sequenced in 2009 using Illumina dye sequencing. Its genome contains 20 pairs of autosomes and one pair of sex chromosomes.\n\nDespite its taxonomic classification as a carnivoran, the giant panda's diet is primarily herbivorous, consisting almost exclusively of bamboo. However, the giant panda still has the digestive system of a carnivore, as well as carnivore-specific genes, and thus derives little energy and little protein from consumption of bamboo. Its ability to digest cellulose is ascribed to the microbes in its gut. Pandas are born with sterile intestines and require bacteria obtained from their mother's feces to digest vegetation. The giant panda is a \"highly specialized\" animal with \"unique adaptations\", and has lived in bamboo forests for millions of years. The average giant panda eats as much as 9 to 14 kg (20 to 30 lb) of bamboo shoots a day to compensate for the limited energy content of its diet. Ingestion of such a large quantity of material is possible because of the rapid passage of large amounts of indigestible plant material through the short, straight digestive tract. It is also noted, however, that such rapid passage of digesta limits the potential of microbial digestion in the gastrointestinal tract, limiting alternative forms of digestion. Given this voluminous diet, the giant panda defecates up to 40 times a day. The limited energy input imposed on it by its diet has affected the panda's behavior. The giant panda tends to limit its social interactions and avoids steeply sloping terrain to limit its energy expenditures.\n\nTwo of the panda's most distinctive features, its large size and round face, are adaptations to its bamboo diet. Anthropologist Russell Ciochon observed: \"[much] like the vegetarian gorilla, the low body surface area to body volume [of the giant panda] is indicative of a lower metabolic rate. This lower metabolic rate and a more sedentary lifestyle allows the giant panda to subsist on nutrient poor resources such as bamboo.\" Similarly, the giant panda's round face is the result of powerful jaw muscles, which attach from the top of the head to the jaw. Large molars crush and grind fibrous plant material.\n\nThe morphological characteristics of extinct relatives of the giant panda suggest that while the ancient giant panda was omnivorous 7 million years ago (mya), it only became herbivorous some 2-2.4 mya with the emergence of \"A. microta\". Genome sequencing of the giant panda suggests that the dietary switch could have initiated from the loss of the sole T1R1/T1R3 umami taste receptor, resulting from two frameshift mutations within the T1R1 exons. Umami taste corresponds to high levels of glutamate as found in meat and may have thus altered the food choice of the giant panda. Although the pseudogenization of the umami taste receptor in \"Ailuropoda\" coincides with the dietary switch to herbivory, it is likely a result of, and not the reason for, the dietary change. The mutation time for the T1R1 gene in the giant panda is estimated to 4.2 mya while fossil evidence indicates bamboo consumption in the giant panda species at least 7 mya, signifying that although complete herbivory occurred around 2 mya, the dietary switch was initiated prior to T1R1 loss-of-function.\n\nPandas eat any of 25 bamboo species in the wild, such as \"Fargesia dracocephala\" and \"Fargesia rufa\". Only a few bamboo species are widespread at the high altitudes pandas now inhabit. Bamboo leaves contain the highest protein levels; stems have less.\n\nBecause of the synchronous flowering, death, and regeneration of all bamboo within a species, the giant panda must have at least two different species available in its range to avoid starvation. While primarily herbivorous, the giant panda still retains decidedly ursine teeth, and will eat meat, fish, and eggs when available. In captivity, zoos typically maintain the giant panda's bamboo diet, though some will provide specially formulated biscuits or other dietary supplements.\n\nPandas will travel between different habitats if they need to, so they can get the nutrients that they need and to balance their diet for reproduction. For six years, scientists studied six pandas tagged with GPS collars at the Foping Reserve in the Qinling Mountains. They took note of their foraging and mating habits, and analysed samples of their food and feces. The pandas would move from the valleys into the Qinling Mountains and would only return to the valleys in autumn. During the summer months bamboo shoots rich in protein are only available at higher altitudes which causes low calcium rates in the pandas and during breeding season the pandas would trek back down to eat bamboo leaves rich in calcium.\n\nAlthough adult giant pandas have few natural predators other than humans, young cubs are vulnerable to attacks by snow leopards, yellow-throated martens, eagles, feral dogs, and the Asian black bear. Sub-adults weighing up to may be vulnerable to predation by leopards.\n\nThe giant panda is a terrestrial animal and primarily spends its life roaming and feeding in the bamboo forests of the Qinling Mountains and in the hilly province of Sichuan. Giant pandas are generally solitary. Each adult has a defined territory and a female is not tolerant of other females in her range. Social encounters occur primarily during the brief breeding season in which pandas in proximity to one another will gather. After mating, the male leaves the female alone to raise the cub.\n\nPandas were thought to fall into the crepuscular category, those who are active twice a day, at dawn and dusk; however, Jindong Zhang found that pandas may belong to a category all of their own, with activity peaks in the morning, afternoon and midnight. Due to their sheer size, pandas do not need to fear predators like other herbivores. They can therefore be active at any time of the day.\n\nPandas communicate through vocalization and scent marking such as clawing trees or spraying urine. They are able to climb and take shelter in hollow trees or rock crevices, but do not establish permanent dens. For this reason, pandas do not hibernate, which is similar to other subtropical mammals, and will instead move to elevations with warmer temperatures. Pandas rely primarily on spatial memory rather than visual memory.\n\nThough the panda is often assumed to be docile, it has been known to attack humans, presumably out of irritation rather than aggression.\n\nInitially, the primary method of breeding giant pandas in captivity was by artificial insemination, as they seemed to lose their interest in mating once they were captured. This led some scientists to try extreme methods, such as showing them videos of giant pandas mating and giving the males sildenafil (commonly known by name Viagra). Only recently have researchers started having success with captive breeding programs, and they have now determined giant pandas have comparable breeding to some populations of the American black bear, a thriving bear species. The normal reproductive rate is considered to be one young every two years.\n\nGiant pandas reach sexual maturity between the ages of four and eight, and may be reproductive until age 20. The mating season is between March and May, when a female goes into estrus, which lasts for two or three days and only occurs once a year. When mating, the female is in a crouching, head-down position as the male mounts her from behind. Copulation time is short, ranging from 30 seconds to five minutes, but the male may mount her repeatedly to ensure successful fertilization. The gestation period ranges from 95 to 160 days.\n\nGiant pandas give birth to twins in about half of pregnancies. If twins are born, usually only one survives in the wild. The mother will select the stronger of the cubs, and the weaker will die. The mother is thought to be unable to produce enough milk for two cubs, since she does not store fat. The father has no part in helping raise the cub.\n\nWhen the cub is first born, it is pink, blind, and toothless, weighing only 90 to 130 grams (3.2 to 4.6 ounces), or about th of the mother's weight, proportionally the smallest baby of any placental mammal. It nurses from its mother's breast six to 14 times a day for up to 30 minutes at a time. For three to four hours, the mother may leave the den to feed, which leaves the cub defenseless. One to two weeks after birth, the cub's skin turns gray where its hair will eventually become black. A slight pink color may appear on cub's fur, as a result of a chemical reaction between the fur and its mother's saliva. A month after birth, the color pattern of the cub's fur is fully developed. Its fur is very soft and coarsens with age. The cub begins to crawl at 75 to 80 days; mothers play with their cubs by rolling and wrestling with them. The cubs can eat small quantities of bamboo after six months, though mother's milk remains the primary food source for most of the first year. Giant panda cubs weigh 45 kg (100 pounds) at one year, and live with their mothers until they are 18 months to two years old. The interval between births in the wild is generally two years.\n\nIn July 2009, Chinese scientists confirmed the birth of the first cub to be successfully conceived through artificial insemination using frozen sperm. The cub was born at 07:41 on 23 July that year in Sichuan as the third cub of You You, an 11-year-old. The technique for freezing the sperm in liquid nitrogen was first developed in 1980 and the first birth was hailed as a solution to the problem of lessening giant panda semen availability, which had led to inbreeding. Panda semen, which can be frozen for decades, could be shared between different zoos to save the species. It is expected that zoos in destinations such as San Diego in the United States and Mexico City will now be able to provide their own semen to inseminate more giant pandas. In August 2014, a rare birth of panda triplets was announced in China; it was the fourth of such births ever reported.\n\nAttempts have also been made to reproduce giant pandas by interspecific pregnancy by implanting cloned panda embryos into the uterus of an animal of another species. This has resulted in panda fetuses, but no live births.\n\nIn the past, pandas were thought to be rare and noble creatures – the Empress Dowager Bo was buried with a panda skull in her vault. The grandson of Emperor Taizong of Tang is said to have given Japan two pandas and a sheet of panda skin as a sign of goodwill. Unlike many other animals in Ancient China, pandas were rarely thought to have medical uses. The few known uses include the Sichuan tribal peoples' use of panda urine to melt accidentally swallowed needles, and the use of panda pelts to control menses as described in the Qin Dynasty encyclopedia \"Erya\".\n\nThe creature named \"mo\" (貘) mentioned in some ancient books has been interpreted as giant panda. The dictionary \"Shuowen Jiezi\" (Eastern Han Dynasty) says that the \"mo\", from Shu (Sichuan), is bear-like, but yellow-and-black, although the older \"Erya\" describes \"mo\" simply as a \"white leopard\". The interpretation of the legendary fierce creature \"pixiu\" (貔貅) as referring to the giant panda is also common.\n\nDuring the reign of the Yongle Emperor (early 15th century), his relative from Kaifeng sent him a captured \"zouyu\" (), and another \"zouyu\" was sighted in Shandong. \"Zouyu\" is a legendary \"righteous\" animal, which, similarly to a \"qilin\", only appears during the rule of a benevolent and sincere monarch. It is said to be fierce as a tiger, but gentle and strictly vegetarian, and described in some books as a white tiger with black spots. Puzzled about the real zoological identity of the creature captured during the Yongle era, J.J.L. Duyvendak exclaims, \"Can it possibly have been a Pandah?\"\n\nThe comparative obscurity of the giant panda throughout most of China's history is illustrated by the fact that, despite there being a number of depictions of bears in Chinese art starting from its most ancient times, and the bamboo being one of the favorite subjects for Chinese painters, there are no known pre-20th-century artistic representations of giant pandas.\n\nThe West first learned of the giant panda on 11 March 1869, when the French missionary Armand David received a skin from a hunter. The first Westerner known to have seen a living giant panda is the German zoologist Hugo Weigold, who purchased a cub in 1916. Kermit and Theodore Roosevelt, Jr., became the first Westerners to shoot a panda, on an expedition funded by the Field Museum of Natural History in the 1920s. In 1936, Ruth Harkness became the first Westerner to bring back a live giant panda, a cub named Su Lin which went to live at the Brookfield Zoo in Chicago. In 1938, five giant pandas were sent to London.\n\nGifts of giant pandas to American and Japanese zoos formed an important part of the diplomacy of the People's Republic of China (PRC) in the 1970s, as it marked some of the first cultural exchanges between the PRC and the West. This practice has been termed \"panda diplomacy\".\n\nBy 1984, however, pandas were no longer given as gifts. Instead, the PRC began to offer pandas to other nations only on 10-year loans, under terms including a fee of up to US$1,000,000 per year and a provision that any cubs born during the loan are the property of the PRC. Since 1998, because of a WWF lawsuit, the United States Fish and Wildlife Service only allows a US zoo to import a panda if the zoo can ensure the PRC will channel more than half of its loan fee into conservation efforts for the giant panda and its habitat.\n\nIn May 2005, the PRC offered a breeding pair to Taiwan. The issue became embroiled in cross-Strait relations – both over the underlying symbolism, and over technical issues such as whether the transfer would be considered \"domestic\" or \"international\", or whether any true conservation purpose would be served by the exchange. A contest in 2006 to name the pandas was held in the mainland, resulting in the politically charged names Tuan Tuan and Yuan Yuan (from \"tuanyuan\", meaning \"reunion\", i.e. \"reunification\"). PRC's offer was initially rejected by Chen Shui-bian, then President of Taiwan. However, when Ma Ying-jeou assumed the presidency in 2008, the offer was accepted, and the pandas arrived in December of that year.\n\nMicrobes in panda waste are being investigated for their use in creating biofuels from bamboo and other plant materials.\n\nThe giant panda is a vulnerable species, threatened by continued habitat loss and habitat fragmentation, and by a very low birthrate, both in the wild and in captivity. Its range is currently confined to a small portion on the western edge of its historical range, which stretched through southern and eastern China, northern Myanmar, and northern Vietnam.\n\nThe giant panda has been a target of poaching by locals since ancient times and by foreigners since it was introduced to the West. Starting in the 1930s, foreigners were unable to poach giant pandas in China because of the Second Sino-Japanese War and the Chinese Civil War, but pandas remained a source of soft furs for the locals. The population boom in China after 1949 created stress on the pandas' habitat, and the subsequent famines led to the increased hunting of wildlife, including pandas. During the Cultural Revolution, all studies and conservation activities on the pandas were stopped. After the Chinese economic reform, demand for panda skins from Hong Kong and Japan led to illegal poaching for the black market, acts generally ignored by the local officials at the time.\n\nThough the Wolong National Nature Reserve was set up by the PRC government in 1958 to save the declining panda population, few advances in the conservation of pandas were made, owing to inexperience and insufficient knowledge of ecology. Many believed the best way to save the pandas was to cage them. As a result, pandas were caged at any sign of decline, and suffered from terrible conditions. Because of pollution and destruction of their natural habitat, along with segregation caused by caging, reproduction of wild pandas was severely limited. In the 1990s, however, several laws (including gun control and the removal of resident humans from the reserves) helped their chances of survival. With these renewed efforts and improved conservation methods, wild pandas have started to increase in numbers in some areas, though they still are classified as a rare species.\n\nIn 2006, scientists reported that the number of pandas living in the wild may have been underestimated at about 1,000. Previous population surveys had used conventional methods to estimate the size of the wild panda population, but using a new method that analyzes DNA from panda droppings, scientists believe the wild population may be as large as 3,000. In 2006, there were 40 panda reserves in China, compared to just 13 reserves in 1998. As the species has been reclassified to \"vulnerable\" since 2016, the conservation efforts are thought to be working. Furthermore, in response to this reclassification, the State Forestry Administration of China announced that they would not accordingly lower the conservation level for panda, and would instead reinforce the conservation efforts.\n\nThe giant panda is among the world's most adored and protected rare animals, and is one of the few in the world whose natural inhabitant status was able to gain a UNESCO World Heritage Site designation. The Sichuan Giant Panda Sanctuaries, located in the southwest province of Sichuan and covering seven natural reserves, were inscribed onto the World Heritage List in 2006.\n\nNot all conservationists agree that the money spent on conserving pandas is well spent. Chris Packham has argued that the breeding of pandas in captivity is \"pointless\" because \"there is not enough habitat left to sustain them\". Packham argues that the money spent on pandas would be better spent elsewhere, and has said he would \"eat the last panda if I could have all the money we have spent on panda conservation put back on the table for me to do more sensible things with\", though he has apologized for upsetting people who like pandas. He points out, \"The panda is possibly one of the grossest wastes of conservation money in the last half century.\" However, a 2015 paper found that the giant panda can serve as an umbrella species as the preservation of their habitat also helps other endemic species in China, including 70% of the country's forest birds, 70% of mammals and 31% of amphibians.\n\nIn 2012, Earthwatch Institute, a global nonprofit that teams volunteers with scientists to conduct important environmental research, launched a program called \"On the Trail of Giant Panda\". This program, based in the Wolong National Nature Reserve, allows volunteers to work up close with pandas cared for in captivity, and help them adapt to life in the wild, so that they may breed, and live longer and healthier lives.\n\nPandas have been kept in zoos as early as the Western Han Dynasty in China, where the writer Sima Xiangru noted that the panda was the most treasured animal in the emperor's garden of exotic animals in the capital Chang'an (present Xi'an). Not until the 1950s were pandas again recorded to have been exhibited in China's zoos.\n\nChi Chi at the London Zoo became very popular. This influenced the World Wildlife Fund to use a panda as its symbol.\n\nA 2006 \"New York Times\" article outlined the economics of keeping pandas, which costs five times more than that of the next most expensive animal, an elephant. American zoos generally pay the Chinese government $1 million a year in fees, as part of a typical ten-year contract. San Diego's contract with China was to expire in 2008, but got a five-year extension at about half of the previous yearly cost. The last contract, with the Memphis Zoo in Memphis, Tennessee, ended in 2013.\n\nThe Face of the Giant Panda Sign is an MRI sign in patients with Wilson's disease, named for the midbrain's resemblance to a giant panda's face.\n\nCryptozoologists use Giant Pandas as an example of an animal recently discovered by science. For example, Guy Edwards writes, \"The Giant Panda was once as mythical and elusive as Bigfoot.\" He adds that there are \"many animals that symbolize the search for Bigfoot is not over.\"\n\nSkeptical cryptozoologist Joe Nickell, notes that since Giant Pandas were known to local people, they qualify as cryptids. However, unlike Bigfoot, pandas specimens were quickly obtained after Armand David learned of them. Also, fossil evidence shows that pandas were once widespread, including the two million year old skull of \"Ailuropoda microta\".\n\n\n"}

In this sense, the feeling of guilt experienced by consumers is fostered by their knowledge of the potential consequences of their choices. The tension between consumers' values and the awareness that their actions may run counter to those same values, manifests itself as a potent, nagging guilt.\n\nConsumers are therefore induced to prefer those companies which are able to offer sustainable practices and products in order to minimize their sense of guiltiness.\n\nGFC is concerned with three main dimensions in which the sense of guilt arises: \nHowever, there is a fourth dimension that mainly affect newly minted urban consumers: the so-called \"cultural-guilt\"; the feeling of culpability caused by the split between global and traditional consumption, e.g. people worrying about the abandoning of their identity in favor of globalization (globalized culture of consumerism).\n\nA totally guilt free consumption is almost impossible to achieve, since products or servicing reducing guilt on one dimension, might foster the same negative feeling on an other; as a consequence GFC aims at the minimization of guilt rather than striving for a complete deletion.\n\nGuilt arises when individuals fail in meeting their own personal self-standards or when a conflict among what the theory of discrepancy calls \"selves\", emerges.\n\nAccording to the self-discrepancy theory there are a number of \"selves\" guiding and shaping one's behavior:\nGuilt can be associated with failure to meet social expectations, thus self-standards can be heavily influenced by social norms which lead to the juxtaposition between one's own judgement of one's behavior and others' judgements of one's behavior. However, individuals are eventually motivated to meet self-standards regardless to others's judgement since social norms become easily internalized through socialization.\n\nThe level of private self characterizing guilt leads to the definition of it as the negative emotional state associated with possible objection to one's actions, inaction, circumstances or intentions.\n\nConsumers are therefore torn between the awareness of their potentially negative impact, and their willingness to enjoying the whole process of consumption. GFC can be understood as a minimization of the feeling of guilt without necessarily aiming at zero impact condition.\n\nThis unachievable freedom from negative emotional states, can be seen in the light of the psychological nature of human beings as characterized by a very heterogeneous mix of status, among which the genuine pleasure derived from consumption. The fact that consumers feel the need to satisfy this sort of hedonism, makes it impossible for them to completely stop their damaging consumption patterns; as a consequences companies want to actively reduce the dichotomy by acting as mediator between the various selves.\n\nGFC can be seen as a way to prevent buyer's remorse, although the latter is a post-purchase dissonance mainly associated with monetary concerns.\n\nThe distinction between the two phenomena comes from the fact that buyer's remorse involves the negative feelings emerging after an excessively expensive product or service, while GFC embraces three different areas of concern. Moreover, buyer's remorse arises after the purchase is accomplished and companies can actively try to alleviate it through money back guarantees, while the sense of guiltiness involving GFC is minimized at the root when firms engage themselves in more responsible production and distribution processes.\n\nGFC has been influencing luxury market since even wealthiest consumers are becoming suspicious with regard to brands promoting fancy lifestyle.\n\nWealthy consumers indeed seem more and more influenced by the so-called \"existential guilt\", a particular sense of guilt individuals may even experience if they feel they benefit from unjustified privileges relative to others or if they accept some responsibility for social ills.\n\nAs a consequence, affluent consumers are putting global and social considerations as their first priority, strengthening the shift from conspicuous consumption to more conscientious buying habits.\n\nOne popular way in which luxury brands are approaching and exploiting guilt-free consumption, is the attenuation of consumers' sense of guilt, hopefully followed by some sort of \"license to indulge\" in the desired product or service, through the promotion of charity organizations partnerships.\n\nGFC's trend affected the way in which companies engage themselves in the creation of value through products, services, production processes and social initiatives. This tendency, aimed at supporting a more conscious and guiltless pattern of consumption, begun even before GFC's full development.\n\nThe Body Shop anticipated the trend by joining environmental and human rights campaigns, for example inviting people to wash up empty bottles of products and having them refilled at the shop. Other examples of the British firm's involvement in social causes are its minimal packaging policy and the project aimed at helping disadvantages communities through Community Trade program.\n\nIn more recent times, there has been fuller engagement of firms in helping consumers minimizing their sense of guilt. In some cases companies focused on absolving one of the three areas of concern related to guilt-free consumption, but it is not always clear to which areas a particular strategy can be linked to since the three dimensions are often overlapping.\nThe strategy implemented by McDonald's and Burger King can be understood in the light of the first class of GFC areas of concern: the personal self. In 2013 Burger King launched Satisfires, a line of fries with 40% of fat and 30% of calories less than McDonald's equivalent. Meanwhile, McDonald's announced a global partnership with the Alliance for a Healthier Generation in order to provide consumers with healthier meals: side-salad, fruit or vegetables as substitute for fried.

Unlike his predecessors, General Gyeong was determined to fix the Goryeo's problems and help the people prosper. His popularity with the people aroused the jealousy of King Myeongjong of Goryeo. His military dictatorship over Goryeo signified a brief period of peace within the war-ravaged kingdom.\n\nGeneral Gyeong Dae-seung was born to Gyeong Jin into the Cheongju Gyeong clan in the year 1154. At the time of his birth, the warrior-class of the nation was highly undermined and deprived of the luxuries that its civilian and scholar counterparts were able to see excessively. The young Gyeong began his military training at the age of 15, and served under the regimes of both Yi Ui-bang and Jeong Jung-bu. When his father died, he took charge of his household and began helping the poor, and made the decision of using the private army that his father had built.\n\nIn 1179, the young General Gyeong led a revolt against the current-reigning dictator Jeong Jung-bu, killing his son and son-in-law in the process of overthrowing any trace of the regime. At the age of 26, Gyeong had overthrown the powerful Jeong military regime and had become the undisputed military dictator of Goryeo. The greatest help to Gyeong was his lifelong friend General Kim Ja-Gyuk, who wanted to put Gyeong on the Imperial throne. Gyeong did not allow such things to overcome his original purpose for taking power. Gyeong Dae-seung became very popular among the people and received the name, \"Righteous, young general.\" Emperor Myeongjong became jealous of Gyeong's popularity and power, and rejected the young general as merely another bloodthirsty barbaric warrior who was greedy for power. Despite efforts to restore peace, Gyeong was faced with assassination attempts, the most notable being an attempt by his friend Kim Ja-Gyuk to poison him. This attempt failed and Gyeong was military dictator over Goryeo for five years until he became ill (possibly tuberculosis) that eventually killed him.\n\nGyeong Dae-seung died in August 1183. With the death of Gyeong, Yi Ui-bang's former lieutenant Yi Ui-min returned to Kaesong and took power over Goryeo, undoing Gyeong's legacy.\n\n"}

She made two voyages transporting convicts from England and Ireland to Australia. She plied between England, India and Sierra Leone before being lost with all hands in 1823.\n\n\"Hadlow\" was built for W. Parker & Co.; she was a two-deck full-rigged ship with a coppered hull, she was assessed at around 374 tons (bm). Her port of registry was London.\n\nFew details of her first years of service are known. Having left London under the command of one Captain Davison on 27 May 1815, \"Hadlow\" sailed from Cromarty, Scotland, to the Hudson Bay in June with 34 colonists from Stromness and possibly Loch Eriboll. She arrived in York Factory on 26 August 1815 and left again on 7 September to winter at Strutton Sound. \"Hadlow\" arrived back in London on 4 November the following year.\n\nDescribed as \"new built\", \"Hadlow\" sailed from London for Bengal, India via Madeira, Portugal in February 1817 under the command of Captain Edward Lamb. During the return voyage from Calcutta, Captain Lamb died on 31 December 1817. Command of the ship was taken by Captain Anderson. \"Hadlow\" collided with the transport ship \"Wyton\" in the English Channel in April 1818.\n\n\"Hadlow\" appears in \"Lloyd's Register\" for 1818 with master Lamb, changing to J. Craigie, and trade London—India, changing to London—Botany Bay.\n\nIn July 1818, \"Hadlow\" was fitted for the transportation of convicts at Deptford Dockyard, Kent. Her guard of a lieutenant and 32 troops of the 48th Regiment of Foot embarked on 17 July, along with six women and four children. She sailed to Woolwich, Kent on 30 July and took 50 male convicts from the prison hulk \"Justitia\" on 1 August. The next day, she sailed for Sheerness, Kent where she took 97 convicts from the prison hulks and \"Retribution\".\n\n\"Hadlow\" departed from Sheerness for New South Wales on 22 August under the command of Captain John Craigie. Having called in at the Cape of Good Hope \"en route\", she arrived at Port Jackson on 23 December, and her cargo of 149 male convicts were turned over to the authorities there, one having died \"en route\". A woman who had been taken on board at the Cape of Good Hope gave birth to a stillborn child shortly after arrival at Port Jackson and subsequently died. The convicts were disembarked on 4 January 1819 for inspection by Governor Macquarie.\n\n\"Hadlow\" departed from Sydney, New South Wales for Calcutta, India on or about 20 January 1819. She departed from Calcutta in late May 1819 for London, where she arrived in early December.\n\n\"Hadlow\" departed from Deptford on 20 February 1820 for Gravesend, where, on 23 February, she embarked a captain, sergeant and 32 privates of the 48th Regiment. She then sailed to Cobh, County Cork, to collect 150 male convicts, who were embarked on 23 March. \"Hadlow\" sailed on 2 April and arrived at Port Jackson on 5 August 1820. Two of her 150 convicts died \"en route\". The convicts were disembarked on 15 August. \"Hadlow\" departed from Sydney on 15 September for Batavia, Netherlands East Indies. She returned from Batavia in October 1820 in company with \"Earl St. Vincent\", \"Mangles\" and \"Neptune\"; between them the four ships had brought 603 convicts to Port Jackson.\n\n\"Hadlow\" sailed from London for Bombay, India on or about 10 October 1821.

After ten years of operation and building a demonstration plant in New Mexico, the company shut down in August 2017. The company shut down after management was unable to raise money, which the CEO attributed to Hillary Clinton losing the 2016 Presidential election. \n\nThe company claimed it would be able to produce more than 20,000 gallons of fuel per acre per year (19,000 m/km·a).\n\nHelioculture uses photosynthetic organisms, but is otherwise distinct from the process that makes fuel from algae. Oils made from algae usually have to be refined into fuel following a batch process, but helioculture produces fuel directly - either ethanol or hydrocarbons - that do not need refining. The Helioculture process also does not produce biomass. This process is enabled by the discovery of unique genes coding for enzymatic mechanisms that enable the direct synthesis of both alkane, olefin, ethanol, and other key molecules. Helioculture allows for brackish water or graywater, nonindustrial waste water from sources such as baths and washing machines, to be used, while traditional biofuels such as cellulosic ethanol require fresh water.\n\nJoule Unlimited claimed that its product would have been cost competitive with crude oil at $50 a barrel ($310/m). The company also stated that its product could supply all of the transportation fuel for the United States from an area the size of the Texas panhandle.\n\nJoule Unlimited did not reveal the name of the organism that it used, although it acknowledged that the company had modified the organism.

They are found mostly in northern India, particularly among the Jat people of Western Uttar Pradesh and Haryana, although historically the term has also been used among other communities. A Khap Panchayat is an assembly of Khap elders, and a Sarv Khap is an assembly of many Khap Panchayats like Dahiya Khap. \n\nKhaps are not affiliated with the formally elected government bodies and is instead concerned with the affairs of the Khap it represents. It is not affiliated with the democratically elected local assemblies that are also termed Panchayat. A Khap Panchayat has no official government recognition or authority, but can exert significant social influence within the community it represents. The Baliyan Khap as led by Mahendra Singh Tikait until 2011 is one that has gained particular media attention.\n\nThe Khaps evolved as tribal and village administrations. One of the terms used to denote the republic was the \"Khap\". Others were Pal, Janapada, and Ganasangha. The Khap consisted a unit of 84 villages. The individual villages were governed by an elected council, known as the \"Panchayat\". A unit of seven villages was called a \"Thamba\" and 12 Thambas formed the Khap unit of 84 villages, though Khaps of 12 and 24 villages existed. Their elected leaders would determine which units would be represented at the Khap level. The \"Sarv Khap\" (or \"All Khap\") Panchayat (Council) represented all the Khaps. The individual Khaps would elect leaders who would send delegates to represent their Khaps at the Sarv Khap. It was a political organisation, composed of all the clans, communities, and castes in the region.\n\nThese Khaps are found from Northwest India down to Maharastra, Chennai, Madhya Pradesh, Malwa, Rajasthan, Sindh, Multan, Punjab, Haryana, and Uttar Pradesh.\n\nThe Khap Panchayats frequently make pronouncements on social issues, such as abortion, alcohol abuse, dowry, and to promote education, specially among girls. In October 2012, one Khap Panchayat leader in Haryana blamed the eating of chow mein, a non-traditional food, for the rise in rape in India, while another suggested that the age of marriage should be dropped from 18 to 16 because being married would make young women less susceptible to rape.\n\nThe largest Khap in Haryana is the Satrol Khap, which allowed inter-caste marriage in 2014, providing the marriage is not within the same gotra, village, or neighbouring villages.\n\nA 2015 Sarv Khap meeting launched a \"Save daughters, educate daughter\" movement.\n\nThe decisions of the patriarchal Khap Panchayats have often been associated with the practice of honour killing.\n\nIn recent times, the Khap system has attracted criticism from groups, citing the stark prejudice that such groups allegedly hold against others. The All India Democratic Women's Association has reported cases where the Khaps are alleged to have initiated threats of murder and violence to couples who marry outside of the circle.\n\nThe Supreme Court of India has declared Khap Panchayats to be illegal because they often decree or encourage honour killings or other institutionalised atrocities against boys and girls of different castes and religions who wish to get married or have married.\n\nIn a 2012 report to the Supreme Court, Raju Ramachandaran, a Senior Advocate appointed by the Court to assist it in public interest litigation actions against Khap Panchayats, called for the arrest of \"self styled\" decision makers and for proactive action by the police to protect the fundamental rights of the people. He also asked for the recommendations to be converted into directions applicable to all states and union territories of India until a law is enacted by the national parliament.\n\nThere are sources that describe the Khap as unofficial caste system where the panchayat dominates all other members of the group. Like the function of traditional caste and family systems, this Indian traditional institution engages in dispute resolution and the regulation of members' behavior. The group uses violence to maintain a rigid structure that controls members particularly, women, Dalits, Muslims, and youths. The panchayats aggressively push tradition and outlook in which caste divisions are desirable while violence towards lower castes is normal and acceptable. An important Khap ethos involves the commitment - for the good of the community - to work with one's body, heart and soul under the leadership of its leaders, who are believed to have high moral superiority. For this reason, these leaders are afforded the right to demand a member's life.\n\nDespite the criticisms against this institution, it remains popular in some parts of India because, in its benign form, it resolves disputes and achieves social order with less time and resources. Sometimes, the Indian government avoids a direct confrontation with the panchayat especially in rural areas.\n\n"}

It is an oath of revenge for vendetta, meaning that the person must take revenge on whomever killed his relative by killing the murderer or one of the murderer's close relatives.\n\nThe practice started in the Balkans in the 15th century, under Turkish rule and the law decreased in the 19th century, when the Balkan countries slowly got their independence from the Ottoman Empire. In pre-Ottoman Serbian principalities, blood money (\"Vražda\") was paid, one half went to the Serbian Orthodox Church, while the other to the victim's family. Stefan Uroš (1240–1272) talks about the Vražda in his works. After Ottoman conquest of Serbia, self-governing clans often feuded with each other. Families in Serbia abandoned the tradition as the bigger threats to family integrity was ethnic Albanians and Turks rather than of their own ethnic group.\n\nWhen a family member has been killed, the perpetrator's family has a \"Blood debt\" (\"krvni dug\") which can only be removed when the victim's family (an appointed member, \"osvetnik\") has had their revenge by killing the aggressor or any member of the murderer's family (Often a close male kinsman, preferably the brother, killing of children was not encouraged). Only then has the family of the victim received peace (However, the blood feud continues if a relative decides to revenge, disregardless of who started). However, killing in your own house is the worst action, representing unmorality, which is a great shame in Montenegrin and Albanian cultures. If a criminal was murdered, it often did not result in a feud as criminality was negative in the eyes of society, but in some cases the criminal's family went on to kill serdars and other high ranked people.\n\n\nThe Osveta is not limited to males, females that have their husbands or relatives killed could take on the \"blood debt\", an instance is recorded from the Bjelopavlići clan, where a widow took out revenge for the murder of her husband.\n\nIf a bratstva finds and captures a thief or murderer (in connection to the bratstva) they could go to the person's house or relatives and tell them that their relative is a murderer or thief and end with something like \"If we kill him, we are not to be held for\" If the relatives answers \"Do what you like with him\" -the bratstva, if they kill the captive, they don't have a blood debt to his relatives because they settled his fate.\n\nThe blood feuds resulted in major instability in Montenegro, Kosovo and diaspora of Montenegrins in later centuries. In Kosovo, most cases of blood feuds were reconciled in the early 1990s in the course of a large-scale reconciliation movement to end blood feuds led by Anton Çetta. The largest reconciliation gathering took place at Verrat e Llukës on 1 May 1990, which had between 100,000 and 500,000 participants. By 1992 the reconciliation campaign ended at least 1,200 deadly blood feuds, and in 1993 not a single homicide occurred in Kosovo.\n\n"}

Most religions have organized behaviours, including clerical hierarchies, a definition of what constitutes adherence or membership, congregations of laity, regular meetings or services for the purposes of veneration of a deity or for prayer, holy places (either natural or architectural) or religious texts. Certain religions also have a sacred language often used in liturgical services. The practice of a religion may also include sermons, commemoration of the activities of a god or gods, sacrifices, festivals, feasts, trance, rituals, rites, ceremonies, worship, initiations, funerals, marriages, meditation, invocation, mediumship, music, art, dance, public service or other aspects of human culture. Religious beliefs have also been used to explain parapsychological phenomena such as out-of-body experiences, near-death experiences and reincarnation, along with many other paranormal and supernatural experiences.\n\nSome academics studying the subject have divided religions into three broad categories: world religions, a term which refers to transcultural, international faiths; indigenous religions, which refers to smaller, culture-specific or nation-specific religious groups; and new religious movements, which refers to recently developed faiths. One modern academic theory of religion, social constructionism, says that religion is a modern concept that suggests all spiritual practice and worship follows a model similar to the Abrahamic religions as an orientation system that helps to interpret reality and define human beings, and thus religion, as a concept, has been applied inappropriately to non-Western cultures that are not based upon such systems, or in which these systems are a substantially simpler construct.\n\nReligions that originated in East Asia; namely Taoism, Confucianism and Shintoism, and religions and traditions related to, and descended from them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReligions that originated in the Indian subcontinent; namely Hinduism, Jainism, Buddhism and Sikhism, and religions and traditions related to, and descended from them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReligions that originated in the Middle East; namely Zoroastrianism, Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, and religions and traditions related to, and descended from them.\n\n\n\n\n\nCertain Christian groups are difficult to classify as \"Eastern\" or \"Western.\" Many Gnostic groups were closely related to early Christianity, for example, Valentinism.

{"id": "20062", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20062", "title": "Meditation", "text": "Meditation\n\nMeditation is a practice where an individual uses a technique - such as mindfulness, or focusing their mind on a particular object, thought or activity - to train attention and awareness, and achieve a mentally clear and emotionally calm state.\n\nMeditation has been practiced since antiquity in numerous religious traditions and beliefs. Since the 19th century, it has spread from its origins to other cultures where it is commonly practiced in private and business life.\n\nMeditation may be used with the aim of reducing stress, anxiety, depression, and pain, and increasing peace, perception, self-concept, and well-being. Meditation is under research to define its possible health (psychological, neurological, and cardiovascular) and other effects.\n\nThe English \"meditation\" is derived from the Latin \"meditatio\", from a verb \"meditari\", meaning \"to think, contemplate, devise, ponder\".\n\nIn the Old Testament, \"hāgâ\" (Hebrew: \"הגה\") means to sigh or murmur, and also, to meditate. When the Hebrew Bible was translated into Greek, \"hāgâ\" became the Greek \"melete\". The Latin Bible then translated \"hāgâ\"/\"melete\" into \"meditatio\".\nThe use of the term \"meditatio\" as part of a formal, stepwise process of meditation goes back to the 12th-century monk Guigo II.\n\nIn addition within specific contexts more precise meanings are not uncommonly given the word \"meditation\". For example, \"meditation\" is sometimes the translation of \"meditatio\" in Latin. \"Meditatio\" is the second of four steps of \"Lectio Divina\", an ancient form of Christian prayer. \"Meditation\" also refers to the seventh of the eight limbs of Yoga in Patanjali's \"Yoga Sutras\", a step called \"dhyāna\" in Sanskrit. Meditation refers to a mental or spiritual \"state\" that may be attained by such practices, and also refers to the \"practice\" of that state.\n\nApart from its historical usage, the term \"meditation\" was introduced as a translation for Eastern spiritual practices, referred to as \"dhyāna\" in Hinduism and Buddhism and which comes from the Sanskrit root \"dhyai\", meaning to contemplate or meditate. The term \"meditation\" in English may also refer to practices from Islamic Sufism, or other traditions such as Jewish Kabbalah and Christian Hesychasm. An edited book about \"meditation\" published in 2003, for example, included chapter contributions by authors describing Hindu, Buddhist, Taoist, Jewish, Christian, and Islamic traditions. Scholars have noted that \"the term 'meditation' as it has entered contemporary usage\" is parallel to the term \"contemplation\" in Christianity, but in many cases, practices similar to modern forms of meditation were simply called \"prayer\". Christian, Judaic, and Islamic forms of meditation are typically devotional, scriptural or thematic, while Asian forms of meditation are often more purely technical.\n\nIn popular usage, the word \"meditation\" and the phrase \"meditative practice\" are often used imprecisely to designate broadly similar practices, or sets of practices, that are found across many cultures and traditions. Definitions in the Oxford and Cambridge living dictionaries and Merriam-Webster include both the original Latin meaning of \"think[ing] deeply about (something),\" as the popular usage of \"to focus one's mind for a period of time,\" \"the act of giving your attention to only one thing,\" and \"to engage in mental exercise (such as concentration on one's breathing or repetition of a mantra) for the purpose of reaching a heightened level of spiritual awareness.\" What is considered meditation can include almost any practice that trains the attention or teaches calm or compassion.\n\nBond et al. (2009), based on views common to seven experts trained in diverse but empirically highly studied (clinical or Eastern-derived,) forms of meditation, identified \nThe table shows several other definitions of meditation that have been used by influential modern reviews of research on meditation across multiple traditions.\n\nIn modern psychological research, meditation has been defined and characterized in a variety of ways; many of these emphasize the role of attention. Scientific reviews have proposed that researchers attempt to more clearly define the type of meditation being practiced in order that the results of their studies be made clearer. One review of the field provides a detailed set of questions as a starting point in reaching this goal.\n\nThe practitioner of meditation attempts to get beyond the reflexive, \"thinking\" mind (sometimes called \"discursive thinking\" or \"logic\") This may be to achieve a deeper, more devout, or more relaxed state. In this article the terms \"meditative practice\" and \"meditation\" are mostly used in this broad sense. However, in some contexts more specialized meanings of \"meditation\" may be intended.\n\nSome of the difficulty in precisely defining meditation has been the difficulty in recognizing the particularities of the many various traditions. There may be differences between the theories of one tradition of meditation as to what it means to practice meditation. The differences between the various traditions themselves, which have grown up a great distance apart from each other, may be even starker. Taylor noted that to refer only to meditation from a particular faith (e.g., \"Hindu\" or \"Buddhist\")\n\nOrnstein noted that \"Most techniques of meditation do not exist as solitary practices but are only artificially separable from an entire system of practice and belief.\" This means that, for instance, while monks engage in meditation as a part of their everyday lives, they also engage the codified rules and live together in monasteries in specific cultural settings that go along with their meditative practices. These meditative practices sometimes have similarities (often noticed by Westerners), for instance concentration on the breath is practiced in Zen, Tibetan and Theravadan contexts, and these similarities or \"typologies\" are noted here.\n\nIn the West, meditation techniques have sometimes been thought of in two broad categories: focused (or concentrative) meditation and open monitoring (or mindfulness) meditation. \n\n\"One style, Focused Attention (FA) meditation, entails the voluntary focusing of attention on a chosen object, breathing, image, or words. The other style, Open Monitoring (OM) meditation, involves non-reactive monitoring of the content of experience from moment to moment.\"\n\"Direction of mental attention... A practitioner can focus intensively on one particular object (so-called \"concentrative meditation\"), on all mental events that enter the field of awareness (so-called \"mindfulness meditation\"), or both specific focal points and the field of awareness.\"\nThese include paying attention to the breath, to an idea or feeling (such as mettā (loving-kindness)), or to a mantra (such as in transcendental meditation), and single point meditation.\n\nThese include mindfulness, shikantaza and other awareness states.\n\nSome practices use both techniques, including vipassana (which uses anapanasati as a preparation), samatha/calm-abiding, and Headspace.\n\nIn these methods, \"\"the practitioner is fully alert, aware, and in control of their faculties but does not experience any unwanted thought activity.\" This is in contrast to the common meditative approaches of being detached from, and non-judgmental of, thoughts, but not of aiming for thoughts to cease. In the meditation practice of the Sahaja yoga spiritual movement, the focus is on thoughts ceasing. Clear light yoga also aims at a state of no mental content, as does the no thought (wu nian) state taught by Huineng, and the teaching of Yaoshan Weiyan.\n\nOne proposal is that transcendental meditation and possibly other techniques be grouped as an 'automatic self-transcending' set of techniques.\n\nOther typologies include dividing meditation into concentrative, generative, receptive and reflective practices.\n\nThe transcendental meditation technique recommends practice of 20 minutes twice per day. Some techniques suggest less time, especially when starting meditation, and Richie Davidson has quoted research saying benefits can be achieved with a practice of only 8 minutes per day. Some meditators practice for much longer, particularly when on a course or retreat. Some meditators find practice best in the hours before dawn.\n\nWhilst positions such as the full-lotus, half-lotus, Burmese, Seiza, and kneeling positions are popular in Buddhism, Jainism and Hinduism, other postures such as sitting, supine (lying), and standing are also used. Meditation is also sometimes done while walking, known as kinhin, or while doing a simple task mindfully, known as samu.\n\nSome ancient religions of the world have a tradition of using prayer beads as tools in devotional meditation. Most prayer beads and Christian rosaries consist of pearls or beads linked together by a thread. The Roman Catholic rosary is a string of beads containing five sets with ten small beads. The Hindu japa mala has 108 beads (the figure 108 in itself having spiritual significance, as well as those used in Jainism and Buddhist prayer beads. Each bead is counted once as a person recites a mantra until the person has gone all the way around the mala. The Muslim misbaha has 99 beads.\n\nRichie Davidson has expressed the view that having a narrative can help maintenance of daily practice. For instance he himself prostrates to the teachings, and meditates \"not primarily for my benefit, but for the benefit of others.\"\n\nIn Jainism, meditation has been a core spiritual practice, one that Jains believe people have undertaken since the teaching of the Tirthankara, Rishabha. All the twenty-four Tirthankaras practiced deep meditation and attained enlightenment. They are all shown in meditative postures in the images or idols. Mahavira practiced deep meditation for twelve years and attained enlightenment. The Acaranga Sutra dating to 500 BCE, addresses the meditation system of Jainism in detail. Acharya Bhadrabahu of the 4th century BCE practiced deep \"Mahaprana\" meditation for twelve years. Kundakunda of 1st century BCE, opened new dimensions of meditation in Jain tradition through his books \"Samayasāra\", \"Pravachansar\" and others. The 8th century Jain philosopher Haribhadra also contributed to the development of Jain yoga through his Yogadṛṣṭisamuccaya, which compares and analyzes various systems of yoga, including Hindu, Buddhist and Jain systems.\n\nJain meditation and spiritual practices system were referred to as salvation-path. It has three important parts called the \"Ratnatraya\" \"Three Jewels\": right perception and faith, right knowledge and right conduct. Meditation in Jainism aims at realizing the self, attaining salvation, take the soul to complete freedom. It aims to reach and to remain in the pure state of soul which is believed to be pure consciousness, beyond any attachment or aversion. The practitioner strives to be just a knower-seer (Gyata-Drashta). Jain meditation can be broadly categorized to \"Dharmya Dhyana\" and \"Shukla Dhyana\".\n\nThere exists a number of meditation techniques such as \"pindāstha-dhyāna, padāstha-dhyāna, rūpāstha-dhyāna, rūpātita-dhyāna, savīrya-dhyāna\", etc. In \"padāstha dhyāna\" one focuses on Mantra. A Mantra could be either a combination of core letters or words on deity or themes. There is a rich tradition of Mantra in Jainism. All Jain followers irrespective of their sect, whether Digambara or Svetambara, practice mantra. Mantra chanting is an important part of daily lives of Jain monks and followers. Mantra chanting can be done either loudly or silently in mind. Yogasana and \"Pranayama\" has been an important practice undertaken since ages. Pranayama – breathing exercises – are performed to strengthen the five \"Pranas\" or vital energy. Yogasana and \"Pranayama\" balances the functioning of neuro-endocrine system of body and helps in achieving good physical, mental and emotional health.\n\nContemplation is a very old and important meditation technique. The practitioner meditates deeply on subtle facts. In \"agnya vichāya\", one contemplates on seven facts – life and non-life, the inflow, bondage, stoppage and removal of \"karmas\", and the final accomplishment of liberation. In \"apaya vichāya\", one contemplates on the incorrect insights one indulges, which eventually develops right insight. In \"vipaka vichāya\", one reflects on the eight causes or basic types of \"karma\". In \"sansathan vichāya\", one thinks about the vastness of the universe and the loneliness of the soul.\n\nAcharya Mahapragya formulated Preksha meditation in the 1970s and presented a well-organised system of meditation. Asana and \"Pranayama\", meditation, contemplation, mantra and therapy are its integral parts. Numerous Preksha meditation centers came into existence around the world and numerous meditations camps are being organized to impart training in it.\n\nBuddhist meditation refers to the meditative practices associated with the religion and philosophy of Buddhism. Core meditation techniques have been preserved in ancient Buddhist texts and have proliferated and diversified through teacher-student transmissions. Buddhists pursue meditation as part of the path toward awakening and nirvana. The closest words for meditation in the classical languages of Buddhism are \"bhāvanā\", \"jhāna\"/\"dhyāna\", and \"vipassana\".\n\nBuddhist meditation techniques have become increasingly popular in the wider world, with many non-Buddhists taking them up for a variety of reasons. There is considerable homogeneity across meditative practices – such as breath meditation and various recollections (\"anussati\") – that are used across Buddhist schools, as well as significant diversity. In the Theravāda tradition alone, there are over fifty methods for developing mindfulness and forty for developing concentration, while in the Tibetan tradition there are thousands of visualization meditations. Most classical and contemporary Buddhist meditation guides are school-specific.\n\nAccording to the Theravada and Sarvastivada commentatorial tradition, and also the Tibetan tradition, the Buddha is said to have identified two paramount mental qualities that arise from wholesome meditative practice:\n\nThrough the meditative development of serenity, one is able to weaken the obscuring hindrances and bring the mind to a collected, pliant and still state (samadhi). This quality of mind then supports the development of insight and wisdom (Prajñā) which is the quality of mind that can \"clearly see\" (\"vi-passana\") the nature of phenomena. What exactly is to be seen various withing the Buddhist traditions. In Theravada, all phenomena are to be seen as impermanent, suffering, not-self and empty. When this happens, one develops dispassion (\"viraga\") for all phenomena, including all negative qualities and hindrances and lets them go. It is through the release of the hindrances and ending of craving through the meditative development of insight that one gains liberation.\n\nIn the modern era, Buddhist meditation saw increasing popularity due to the influence of Buddhist modernism on Asian Buddhism, and western lay interest in Zen and the Vipassana movement. The spread of Buddhist meditation to the Western world paralleled the spread of Buddhism in the West. Buddhist meditation has also influenced Western Psychology, especially through the work of Jon Kabat-Zinn who founded the Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) in 1979. The modernized concept of mindfulness (based on the Buddhist term \"sati\") and related meditative practices has in turn led to several mindfulness based therapies.\n\nThere are many schools and styles of meditation within Hinduism.\n\nIn pre-modern and traditional Hindu religions, \"Yoga\" and \"Dhyana\" are done to realize union of one's eternal self or soul, one's ātman. In some Hindu traditions, such as Advaita Vedanta this is equated with the omnipresent and non-dual Brahman. In others, such as the dualistic the Yoga school and Samkhya, the Self is referred to as Purusha, a pure consciousness which is separate from matter. Depending on the tradition, this liberative event is referred to as moksha, vimukti or kaivalya.\n\nThe earliest clear references to meditation in Hindu literature are in the middle Upanishads and the Mahabharata, the latter of which includes the Bhagavad Gita. According to Gavin Flood, the earlier Brihadaranyaka Upanishad refers to meditation when it states that \"having become calm and concentrated, one perceives the self (\"ātman\") within oneself\".\n\nOne of the most influential texts of classical Hindu Yoga is Patañjali's Yoga sutras (c. 400 CE), a text associated with Yoga and Samkhya, which outlines eight limbs leading to kaivalya (\"aloneness\"). These are ethical discipline (yamas), rules (niyamas), physical postures (āsanas), breath control (prāṇāyama), withdrawal from the senses (pratyāhāra), one-pointedness of mind (dhāraṇā), meditation (dhyāna), and finally samādhi.\n\nLater developments in Hind meditation include the compilation of Hatha Yoga (forceful yoga) compendiums like the Hatha Yoga Pradipika, the development of Bhakti yoga as a major form of meditation and Tantra. Another important Hindu yoga text is the Yoga Yajnavalkya, which makes use of Hatha Yoga and Vedanta Philosophy.\n\nIn the sixth chapter of Bhāvārthadipikā commentary on the Bhagavad-Gita by Sri Jñāneśvar (Dnyaneshwar) meditation in yoga is described as a state caused by the spontaneous awakening of the sacred energy Kundalini (not Prana or Chi), which creates a connection of the individual soul Ātman with universal Spirit - Paramātman.\n\nMeditation is used in modern Hindu religious movements.\n\nIn Sikhism, simran (meditation) and good deeds are both necessary to achieve the devotee's Spiritual goals; without good deeds meditation is futile. When Sikhs meditate, they aim to feel God's presence and immerge in the divine light. It is only God's divine will or order that allows a devotee to desire to begin to meditate. Guru Nanak in the Japji Sahib daily Sikh scripture explains:Visits to temples, penance, compassion and charity gain you but a sesame seed of credit. It is hearkening to His Name, accepting and adoring Him that obtains emancipation by bathing in the shrine of soul. All virtues are Yours, O Lord! I have none; Without good deeds one can't even meditate.Nām Japnā involves focusing one's attention on the names or great attributes of God.\n\nTaoist or Daoist meditation has a long history, and has developed various techniques including concentration, visualization, \"qi\" cultivation, contemplation, and mindfulness meditations. Traditional Daoist meditative practices were influenced by Chinese Buddhism beginning around the 5th century, and later had influence upon Traditional Chinese medicine and the Chinese martial arts.\n\nLivia Kohn distinguishes three basic types of Daoist meditation: \"concentrative\", \"insight\", and \"visualization\". \"Ding\" 定 (literally means \"decide; settle; stabilize\") refers to \"deep concentration\", \"intent contemplation\", or \"perfect absorption\". \"Guan\" 觀 (lit. \"watch; observe; view\") meditation seeks to merge and attain unity with the Dao. It was developed by Tang Dynasty (618–907) Daoist masters based upon the \"Tiantai\" Buddhist practice of \"Vipassanā\" \"insight\" or \"wisdom\" meditation. \"Cun\" 存 (lit. \"exist; be present; survive\") has a sense of \"to cause to exist; to make present\" in the meditation techniques popularized by the Daoist Shangqing and Lingbao Schools. A meditator visualizes or actualizes solar and lunar essences, lights, and deities within his/her body, which supposedly results in health and longevity, even \"xian\" 仙/仚/僊, \"immortality\".\n\nThe (late 4th century BCE) \"Guanzi\" essay \"Neiye\" \"Inward training\" is the oldest received writing on the subject of \"qi\" cultivation and breath-control meditation techniques. For instance, \"When you enlarge your mind and let go of it, when you relax your vital breath and expand it, when your body is calm and unmoving: And you can maintain the One and discard the myriad disturbances. ... This is called \"revolving the vital breath\": Your thoughts and deeds seem heavenly.\"\n\nThe (c. 3rd century BCE) Daoist \"Zhuangzi\" records \"zuowang\" or \"sitting forgetting\" meditation. Confucius asked his disciple Yan Hui to explain what \"sit and forget\" means: \"I slough off my limbs and trunk, dim my intelligence, depart from my form, leave knowledge behind, and become identical with the Transformational Thoroughfare.\"\n\nDaoist meditation practices are central to Chinese martial arts (and some Japanese martial arts), especially the \"qi\"-related \"neijia\" \"internal martial arts\". Some well-known examples are \"daoyin\" \"guiding and pulling\", \"qigong\" \"life-energy exercises\", \"neigong\" \"internal exercises\", \"neidan\" \"internal alchemy\", and \"taijiquan\" \"great ultimate boxing\", which is thought of as moving meditation. One common explanation contrasts \"movement in stillness\" referring to energetic visualization of \"qi\" circulation in \"qigong\" and \"zuochan\" \"seated meditation\", versus \"stillness in movement\" referring to a state of meditative calm in \"taijiquan\" forms.\n\nIn the teachings of the Bahá'í Faith, meditation along with prayer are both primary tools for spiritual development and mainly refer to one's reflection on the words of God. While prayer and meditation are linked, where meditation happens generally in a prayerful attitude, prayer is seen specifically as turning toward God, and meditation is seen as a communion with one's self where one focuses on the divine.\n\nThe Bahá'í teachings note that the purpose of meditation is to strengthen one's understanding of the words of God, and to make one's soul more susceptible to their potentially transformative power, more receptive to the need for both prayer and meditation to bring about and maintain a spiritual communion with God.\n\nBahá'u'lláh, the founder of the religion, never specified any particular form of meditation, and thus each person is free to choose their own form. However, he specifically did state that Bahá'ís should read a passage of the Bahá'í writings twice a day, once in the morning, and once in the evening, and meditate on it. He also encouraged people to reflect on one's actions and worth at the end of each day. During the Nineteen Day Fast, a period of the year during which Bahá'ís adhere to a sunrise-to-sunset fast, they meditate and pray to reinvigorate their spiritual forces.\n\nThere is evidence that Judaism has had meditative practices that go back thousands of years. For instance, in the Torah, the patriarch Isaac is described as going \"לשוח\" (\"lasuach\") in the field—a term understood by all commentators as some type of meditative practice (Genesis 24:63).\n\nSimilarly, there are indications throughout the Tanakh (the Hebrew Bible) that meditation was used by the prophets. In the Old Testament, there are two Hebrew words for meditation: \"hāgâ\" (), which means \"to sigh\" or \"murmur\", but also \"to meditate\", and \"sîḥâ\" (), which means \"to muse\", or \"rehearse in one's mind\".\n\nSome meditative traditions have been encouraged in the school of Judaism known as Kabbalah, and some Jews have described Kabbalah as an inherently meditative field of study. Aryeh Kaplan has argued that, for the Kabbalist, the ultimate purpose of meditative practice is to understand and cleave to the Divine. Classic methods include the mental visualisation of the supernal realms the soul navigates through to achieve certain ends. One of the best known types of meditation in early Jewish mysticism was the work of the Merkabah, from the root /R-K-B/ meaning \"chariot\" (of God).\n\nMeditation has been of interest to a wide variety of modern Jews. In modern Jewish practice, one of the best known meditative practices is called \"hitbodedut\" (\"התבודדות\", alternatively transliterated as \"hisbodedus\"), and is explained in Kabbalistic, Hasidic, and Mussar writings, especially the Hasidic method of Rabbi Nachman of Breslav. The word derives from the Hebrew word \"boded\" (בודד), meaning the state of being alone. Another Hasidic system is the Habad method of \"hisbonenus\", related to the Sephirah of \"Binah\", Hebrew for understanding. This practice is the analytical reflective process of making oneself understand a mystical concept well, that follows and internalises its study in Hasidic writings.\n\nThe Musar Movement, founded by Rabbi Israel Salanter in the middle of the nineteenth-century, emphasized meditative practices of introspection and visualization that could help to improve moral character.\n\nJewish Buddhists have adopted Buddhist styles of meditation.\n\nChristian meditation is a term for a form of prayer in which a structured attempt is made to get in touch with and deliberately reflect upon the revelations of God. The word meditation comes from the Latin word \"meditari\", which means to concentrate. Christian meditation is the process of deliberately focusing on specific thoughts (e.g. a biblical scene involving Jesus and the Virgin Mary) and reflecting on their meaning in the context of the love of God.\n\nThe Rosary is a devotion for the meditation of the mysteries of Jesus and Mary.“The gentle repetition of its prayers makes it an excellent means to moving into deeper meditation. It gives us an opportunity to open ourselves to God’s word, to refine our interior gaze by turning our minds to the life of Christ. The first principle is that meditation is learned through practice. Many people who practice rosary meditation begin very simply and gradually develop a more sophisticated meditation. The meditator learns to hear an interior voice, the voice of God”.\n\nChristian meditation contrasts with Eastern forms of meditation as radically as the portrayal of God the Father in the Bible contrasts with depictions of Krishna or Brahman in Indian teachings. Unlike Eastern meditations, most styles of Christian meditations do not rely on the repeated use of mantras, and yet are also intended to stimulate thought and deepen meaning. Christian meditation aims to heighten the personal relationship based on the love of God that marks Christian communion.\n\nIn \"Aspects of Christian meditation\", the Catholic Church warned of potential incompatibilities in mixing Christian and Eastern styles of meditation. In 2003, in \"A Christian reflection on the New Age\" the Vatican announced that the \"Church avoids any concept that is close to those of the New Age\".\n\nChristian meditation is sometimes taken to mean the middle level in a broad three stage characterization of prayer: it then involves more reflection than first level vocal prayer, but is more structured than the multiple layers of contemplation in Christianity.\n\nIn Frankfurt, Germany in 2007 the Centre for Christian Meditation and Spirituality in the Holy Cross Church, Frankfurt-Bornheim was founded by the Roman Catholic Diocese of Limburg. In and by the centre different kinds of church services are offered like for example with elements such as expressionist dance, moreover days of exercises of Christian mysticism, contemplative prayer, meditative singing, meditation courses, Zen-meditation courses, days of reflection, spiritual exercises and retreats\n\nEarly studies on states of consciousness conducted by Roland Fischer found evidence of mystical experience description in the writings of Saint Teresa of Avila. In her autobiography she describes that, at the peak of a praying experience \"... the soul neither hears nor sees nor feels. While it lasts, none of the senses perceives or knows what is taking place\". This corresponds to the fourth stage described by Saint Teresa, \"Devotion of Ecstasy\", where the consciousness of being in the body disappears, as an effect of deep transcendent meditation in prayer.\n\nSalah is a mandatory act of devotion performed by Muslims five times per day. The body goes through sets of different postures, as the mind attains a level of concentration called \"khushu\"'.\n\nA second optional type of meditation, called dhikr, meaning remembering and mentioning God, is interpreted in different meditative techniques in Sufism or Islamic mysticism. This became one of the essential elements of Sufism as it was systematized traditionally. It is juxtaposed with \"fikr\" (thinking) which leads to knowledge. By the 12th century, the practice of Sufism included specific meditative techniques, and its followers practiced breathing controls and the repetition of holy words.\n\nNumerous Sufi traditions place emphasis upon a meditative procedure which comes from the cognitive aspect to one of the two principal approaches to be found in the Buddhist traditions: that of the concentration technique, involving high-intensity and sharply focused introspection. In the Oveyssi-Shahmaghsoudi Sufi order, for example, this is particularly evident, where muraqaba takes the form of tamarkoz, the latter being a Persian term that means \"concentration\".\n\n\"Tafakkur\" or \"tadabbur\" in Sufism literally means \"reflection upon the universe\": this is considered to permit access to a form of cognitive and emotional development that can emanate only from the higher level, i.e. from God. The sensation of receiving divine inspiration awakens and liberates both heart and intellect, permitting such inner growth that the apparently mundane actually takes on the quality of the infinite. Muslim teachings embrace life as a test of one's submission to God.\n\nReligions and religious movements which use magic, such as Wicca, Thelema, Neopaganism, occultism etc., often require their adherents to meditate as a preliminary to the magical work. This is because magic is often thought to require a particular state of mind in order to make contact with spirits, or because one has to visualize one's goal or otherwise keep intent focused for a long period during the ritual in order to see the desired outcome. Meditation practice in these religions usually revolves around visualization, absorbing energy from the universe or higher self, directing one's internal energy, and inducing various trance states. Meditation and magic practice often overlap in these religions as meditation is often seen as merely a stepping stone to supernatural power, and the meditation sessions may be peppered with various chants and spells.\n\nMantra meditation, with the use of a japa mala and especially with focus on the Hare Krishna maha-mantra, is a central practice of the Gaudiya Vaishnava faith tradition and the International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON), also known as the Hare Krishna movement. Other popular New Religious Movements include the Ramakrishna Mission, Vedanta Society, Divine Light Mission, Chinmaya Mission, Osho, Sahaja Yoga, Transcendental Meditation, Oneness University, Brahma Kumaris and Vihangam Yoga.\n\nNew Age meditations are often influenced by Eastern philosophy, mysticism, yoga, Hinduism and Buddhism, yet may contain some degree of Western influence. In the West, meditation found its mainstream roots through the social revolution of the 1960s and 1970s, when many of the youth of the day rebelled against traditional religion as a reaction against what some perceived as the failure of Christianity to provide spiritual and ethical guidance.\nNew Age meditation as practised by the early hippies is regarded for its techniques of blanking out the mind and releasing oneself from conscious thinking. This is often aided by repetitive chanting of a mantra, or focusing on an object. New Age meditation evolved into a range of purposes and practices, from serenity and balance to access to other realms of consciousness to the concentration of energy in group meditation to the supreme goal of samadhi, as in the ancient yogic practice of meditation.\n\nOver the past 20 years, mindfulness and mindfulness-based programs have been used to assist people, whether they be clinically sick or healthy. Jon Kabat-Zinn, who founded the Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction program in 1979, has defined mindfulness as 'moment to moment non-judgmental awareness.' Several methods are used during time set aside specifically for mindfulness meditation, such as body scan techniques or letting thought arise and pass, and also during our daily lives, such as being aware of the taste and texture of the food that we eat. Some studies offer evidence that mindfulness practices are beneficial for the brain's self-regulation by increasing activity in the anterior cingulate cortex. A shift from using the right prefrontal cortex is claimed to be associated with a trend away from depression and anxiety, and towards happiness, relaxation, and emotional balance.\n\nAs stated by the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine, a US government entity within the National Institutes of Health that advocates various forms of Alternative Medicine, \"Meditation may be practiced for many reasons, such as to increase calmness and physical relaxation, to improve psychological balance, to cope with illness, or to enhance overall health and well-being.\"\n\nMeditation techniques have also been used by Western theories of counseling and psychotherapy. Relaxation training works toward achieving mental and muscle relaxation to reduce daily stresses. \nSahaja (mental silence) meditators scored above control group for emotional well-being and mental health measures on SF-36 ratings.\n\nJacobson's Progressive Muscle Relaxation was developed by American physician Edmund Jacobson in the early 1920s. In this practice one tenses and then relaxes muscle groups in a sequential pattern whilst concentrating on how they feel. The method has been seen to help people with many conditions, especially extreme anxiety.\nJacobson is credited with developing the initial progressive relaxation procedure. These techniques are used in conjunction with other behavioral techniques. Originally used with systematic desensitization, relaxation techniques are now used with other clinical problems. Meditation, hypnosis and biofeedback-induced relaxation are a few of the techniques used with relaxation training.\n\nOne of the eight essential phases of EMDR (developed by Francine Shapiro), bringing adequate closure to the end of each session, also entails the use of relaxation techniques, including meditation. Multimodal therapy, a technically eclectic approach to behavioral therapy, also employs the use of meditation as a technique used in individual therapy.\nFrom the point of view of psychology and physiology, meditation can induce an altered state of consciousness. Such altered states of consciousness may correspond to altered neuro-physiologic states.\n\nToday, there are many different types of meditation practiced in western culture. Mindful breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, and loving kindness meditations for instance have been found to provide cognitive benefits such as relaxation and decentering. With training in meditation, depressive rumination can be decreased and overall peace of mind can flourish. Different techniques have shown to work better for different people.\n\nHerbert Benson of Harvard Medical School conducted a series of clinical tests on meditators from various disciplines, including the Transcendental Meditation technique and Tibetan Buddhism. In 1975, Benson published a book titled \"The Relaxation Response\" where he outlined his own version of meditation for relaxation. Also in the 1970s, the American psychologist Patricia Carrington developed a similar technique called Clinically Standardized Meditation (CSM). In Norway, another sound-based method called Acem Meditation developed a psychology of meditation and has been the subject of several scientific studies.\n\nBiofeedback has been used by many researchers since the 1950s in an effort to enter deeper states of mind.\n\nThe history of meditation is intimately bound up with the religious context within which it was practiced. Some authors have even suggested the hypothesis that the emergence of the capacity for focused attention, an element of many methods of meditation, may have contributed to the latest phases of human biological evolution. Some of the earliest references to meditation are found in the Hindu Vedas of India. Wilson translates the most famous Vedic mantra \"Gayatri\" as: \"We meditate on that desirable light of the divine Savitri, who influences our pious rites\" (Rigveda : Mandala-3, Sukta-62, Rcha-10). Around the 6th to 5th centuries BCE, other forms of meditation developed via Confucianism and Taoism in China as well as Hinduism, Jainism, and early Buddhism in Nepal and India.\n\nIn the Roman Empire, by 20 BCE Philo of Alexandria had written on some form of \"spiritual exercises\" involving attention (prosoche) and concentration and by the 3rd century Plotinus had developed meditative techniques.\n\nThe Pāli Canon, which dates to 1st century BCE considers Buddhist meditation as a step towards liberation. By the time Buddhism was spreading in China, the \"Vimalakirti Sutra\" which dates to 100 CE included a number of passages on meditation, clearly pointing to Zen (known as Chan in China, Thiền in Vietnam, and Seon in Korea). The Silk Road transmission of Buddhism introduced meditation to other Asian countries, and in 653 the first meditation hall was opened in Singapore. Returning from China around 1227, Dōgen wrote the instructions for zazen.\n\nThe Islamic practice of Dhikr had involved the repetition of the 99 Names of God since the 8th or 9th century. By the 12th century, the practice of Sufism included specific meditative techniques, and its followers practiced breathing controls and the repetition of holy words. Interactions with Indians, Nepalese or the Sufis may have influenced the Eastern Christian meditation approach to hesychasm, but this can not be proved. Between the 10th and 14th centuries, hesychasm was developed, particularly on Mount Athos in Greece, and involves the repetition of the Jesus prayer.\n\nWestern Christian meditation contrasts with most other approaches in that it does not involve the repetition of any phrase or action and requires no specific posture. Western Christian meditation progressed from the 6th century practice of Bible reading among Benedictine monks called Lectio Divina, i.e. divine reading. Its four formal steps as a \"ladder\" were defined by the monk Guigo II in the 12th century with the Latin terms \"lectio\", \"meditatio\", \"oratio\", and \"contemplatio\" (i.e. read, ponder, pray, contemplate). Western Christian meditation was further developed by saints such as Ignatius of Loyola and Teresa of Avila in the 16th century.\nSecular forms of meditation were introduced in India in the 1950s as a modern form of Hindu meditative techniques and arrived in Australia in the late 1950s and, the United States and Europe in the 1960s. Rather than focusing on spiritual growth, secular meditation emphasizes stress reduction, relaxation and self-improvement. Both spiritual and secular forms of meditation have been subjects of scientific analyses. Research on meditation began in 1931, with scientific research increasing dramatically during the 1970s and 1980s. Since the beginning of the '70s more than a thousand studies of meditation in English have been reported. However, after 60 years of scientific study, the exact mechanism at work in meditation remains unclear.\n\nMethods of meditation have been cross-culturally disseminated at various times throughout history, such as Buddhism going to East Asia, and Sufi practices going to many Islamic societies. Of special relevance to the modern world is the dissemination of meditative practices since the late 19th century, accompanying increased travel and communication among cultures worldwide. Most prominent has been the transmission of numerous Asian-derived practices to the West. In addition, interest in some Western-based meditative practices has also been revived, and these have been disseminated to a limited extent to Asian countries. Also evident is some extent of influence over Enlightenment thinking through Denis Diderot's \"Encyclopédie\", although he states, \"I find that a meditation practitioner is often quite useless and that a contemplation practitioner is always insane\".\n\nIdeas about Eastern meditation had begun \"seeping into American popular culture even before the American Revolution through the various sects of European occult Christianity\", and such ideas \"came pouring in [to America] during the era of the transcendentalists, especially between the 1840s and the 1880s.\" The following decades saw further spread of these ideas to America:\n\nThe World Parliament of Religions, held in Chicago in 1893, was the landmark event that increased Western awareness of meditation. This was the first time that Western audiences on American soil received Asian spiritual teachings from Asians themselves. Thereafter, Swami Vivekananda... [founded] various Vedanta ashrams... Anagarika Dharmapala lectured at Harvard on Theravada Buddhist meditation in 1904; Abdul Baha ... [toured] the US teaching the principles of Bahai, and Soyen Shaku toured in 1907 teaching Zen...\n\nMore recently, in the 1960s, another surge in Western interest in meditative practices began. Observers have suggested many types of explanations for this interest in Eastern meditation and revived Western contemplation. Thomas Keating, a founder of Contemplative Outreach, wrote that \"the rush to the East is a symptom of what is lacking in the West. There is a deep spiritual hunger that is not being satisfied in the West.\" Daniel Goleman, a scholar of meditation, suggested that the shift in interest from \"established religions\" to meditative practices \"is caused by the scarcity of the personal experience of these [meditation-derived] transcendental states – the living spirit at the common core of all religions.\"\n\nAnother suggested contributing factor is the rise of communist political power in Asia, which \"set the stage for an influx of Asian spiritual teachers to the West\", oftentimes as refugees.\n\nA 2010 review of the literature on spirituality and performance in organizations found an increase in corporate meditation programs.\n\nAs of 2016 around a quarter of U.S. employers were using stress reduction initiatives. The goal was to help reduce stress and improve reactions to stress. Aetna now offers its program to its customers. Google also implements mindfulness, offering more than a dozen meditation courses, with the most prominent one, \"Search Inside Yourself\", having been implemented since 2007. General Mills offers the Mindful Leadership Program Series, a course which uses a combination of mindfulness meditation, yoga and dialog with the intention of developing the mind's capacity to pay attention.\n\nResearch on the processes and effects of meditation is a subfield of neurological research. Modern scientific techniques, such as fMRI and EEG, were used to observe neurological responses during meditation. Since the 1950s, hundreds of studies on meditation have been conducted, though the overall methological quality of meditation research is poor, yielding unreliable results.\n\nSince the 1970s, clinical psychology and psychiatry have developed meditation techniques for numerous psychological conditions. Mindfulness practice is employed in psychology to alleviate mental and physical conditions, such as reducing depression, stress, and anxiety. Mindfulness is also used in the treatment of drug addiction. Studies demonstrate that meditation has a moderate effect to reduce pain. There is insufficient evidence for any effect of meditation on positive mood, attention, eating habits, sleep, or body weight.\n\nA 2017 systematic review and meta-analysis of the effects of meditation on empathy, compassion, and prosocial behaviors found that meditation practices had small to medium effects on self-reported and observable outcomes, concluding that such practices can \"improve positive prosocial emotions and behaviors\".\n\nPreliminary studies showed a potential relationship between meditation and job performance, resulting from cognitive and social effects.\n\nConcerns have been raised on the quality of much meditation research, including the particular characteristics of individuals who tend to participate.\n\nEvidence from neuroimaging studies suggests that the categories of meditation, as defined by how they direct attention, appear to generate different brainwave patterns. Evidence also suggests that using different focus objects during meditation may generate different brainwave patterns.\n\nThe 2012 US National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) (n = 34,525), found 8.0% of US adults used meditation, with lifetime and 12-month prevalence of meditation use of 5.2% and 4.1% respectively. In the 2017 survey meditation use among workers was 9.9% (up from 8.0% in 2002).\n\nMany major traditions in which meditation is practiced, such as Buddhism and Hinduism, advise members not to consume intoxicants, while others, such as the Rastafarian movements and Native American Church, view drugs as integral to their religious lifestyle.\n\nThe fifth of the five precepts of the Pancasila, the ethical code in the Theravada and Mahayana Buddhist traditions, states that adherents must: \"abstain from fermented and distilled beverages that cause heedlessness.\"\n\nOn the other hand, the ingestion of psychoactives has been a central feature in the rituals of many religions, in order to produce altered states of consciousness. In several traditional shamanistic ceremonies, drugs are used as agents of ritual. In the Rastafari movement, cannabis is believed to be a gift from Jah and a sacred herb to be used regularly, while alcohol is considered to debase man. Native Americans use peyote, as part of religious ceremony, continuing today. In India, the soma drink has a long history of use alongside prayer and sacrifice, and is mentioned in the Vedas.\n\nDuring the 1960s and 70s, both eastern meditation traditions and psychedelics, such as LSD, became popular in America, and it was suggested that LSD use and meditation were both means to the same spiritual/existential end. Many practitioners of eastern traditions rejected this idea, including many who had tried LSD themselves. In \"The Master Game\", Robert S de Ropp writes that the \"door to full consciousness\" can be glimpsed with the aid of substances, but to \"pass beyond the door\" requires yoga and meditation. Other authors, such as Rick Strassman, believe that the relationship between religious experiences reached by way of meditation and through the use of psychedelic drugs deserves further exploration.\n\nMindfulness meditation, in its modern form, is regarded by psychologist Thomas Joiner to have been \"corrupted\" for commercial gain by self-help celebrities, and he suggests that it encourages narcissistic and self-obsessed mindsets which can be unhealthy.\n\nThere has been some reporting of cases where meditating correlated with negative experiences for the meditator.\n\n\n"}

Foster was murdered by an Indian immigrant named Maninder Pal Singh Kohli. Her body was found in nearby West End, two days after she disappeared in Southampton.\n\nHannah Foster was a promising A-Level student from Southampton, who had been preparing to study medicine at university. On 14 March 2003, she went out in Southampton with a friend for a few drinks. Her friend got the bus home, while Hannah decided to walk the half-mile to her home. Indian native, sandwich delivery man Maninder Pal Singh Kohli, was cruising the area in his white van. He snatched Hannah as she walked. From his van, Foster secretly made a call to emergency services in the hope they would realise she was in trouble. On the 999 tape, Foster can be heard speaking to a man with an Asian accent. The tape was played during the later trial at Winchester Crown Court on Wednesday 15 October 2008. Foster's body was found in bushes in a country lane just outside Southampton two days later. A post-mortem examination revealed she had been raped and strangled.\n\nKohli fled to India shortly after Foster's body was found. He was soon identified by investigators as a prime suspect in the case. After Indian police failed to apprehend Kohli, Foster's parents went to India themselves and made a public appeal for information of his whereabouts. During their 10-day visit, Foster's parents held a series of press conferences as well as opening a telephone \"hotline\". Their visit soon became a subject of high interest in the Indian press, and Kohli was arrested five days after their arrival. Hampshire police announced a reward of INR 5,000,000 to anyone whose clues led to the arrest of Kohli. Kohli's wife in England, and his brother, a policeman in India, denied his involvement in the murder.\n\nThe key to the arrest of Kohli was information from taxi driver Jason Lepcha, hired by Kohli partly because of his understanding of English. Lepcha received a reward of INR 367,000. He used all this money to establish a school in Hannah's name. When visiting Darjeeling in 2006, Hannah's parents unwittingly hired Lepcha as their driver, and heard his story. On their return to England, they worked with others to set up a registered charity in memory of Hannah which supports Lepcha's school.\n\nKohli was arrested on 15 July 2004 in West Bengal's Darjeeling district while trying to flee to Nepal. While in police custody, Kohli stated he was \"tired of running\". On 28 July 2004, Kohli admitted to raping and murdering Foster in an interview with a private television channel. Confessing to his crime, Kohli said that he was forced to kill Foster after raping her because she refused to cover up his crime. In August 2004, he retracted his confessional statement saying it was \"not by my own will\".\n\nKohli was held in judicial custody in India pending extradition to the United Kingdom; a final decision to extradite him to the UK was handed down on 8 June 2007. On 28 July 2007 Kohli arrived in the UK after being extradited. Kohli was charged with the murder, kidnap, and rape of Hannah Foster after landing at Heathrow, following his extradition from India. He was also charged with manslaughter, false imprisonment, and perverting the course of justice. On 10 December 2007, Kohli entered a plea of not guilty to the charges of kidnapping, rape and murder at Winchester Crown Court.\n\nOn 25 November 2008, Kohli, then aged 41, was found guilty of all charges at Winchester Crown Court and sentenced to life imprisonment, with a recommended minimum term of 24 years, less two years for time already served in the UK on remand. Hannah's family expressed their disappointment in the sentence, hoping that the killer would spend the rest of his life in prison.\n\nUnder the trial judge's recommendation, Kohli is expected to remain in prison until at least 2030 and the age of 63.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "648470", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=648470", "title": "Oppression", "text": "Oppression\n\nOppression can refer to an authoritarian regime controlling its citizens via state control of politics, the monetary system, media, and the military; denying people any meaningful human or civil rights; and terrorizing the populace through harsh, unjust punishment, and a hidden network of obsequious informants reporting to a vicious secret police force. \n\nOppression also refers to a less overtly malicious pattern of subjugation, although in many ways this social oppression represents a particularly insidious and ruthlessly effective form of manipulation and control. In this instance, the subordination and injustices do not afflict everyone—instead it targets specific groups of people for restrictions, ridicule, and marginalization. No universally accepted term has yet emerged to describe this variety of oppression, although some scholars will parse the multiplicity of factors into a handful of categories, e.g., social (or sociocultural) oppression; institutional (or legal) oppression; and economic oppression.\n\nThe word \"oppress \"comes from the Latin \"oppressus\", past participle of \"opprimere\", (\"to press against\", \"to squeeze\", \"to suffocate\"). Thus, when authoritarian governments use oppression to subjugate the people, they want their citizenry to feel that \"pressing down\", and to live in fear that if they displease the authorities they will, in a metaphorical sense, be \"squeezed\" and \"suffocated\", e.g., thrown in a dank, dark, state prison or summarily executed. Such governments oppress the people using restriction, control, terror, hopelessness, and despair. The tyrant's tools of oppression include, for example, extremely harsh punishments for \"unpatriotic\" statements; developing a loyal, guileful secret police force; prohibiting freedom of assembly, freedom of speech, and freedom of the press; controlling the monetary system and economy; and imprisoning or killing activists or other leaders who might pose a threat to their power.\n\nOppression also refers to a more insidious type of manipulation and control, in this instance involving the subjugation and marginalization of specific groups of people within a country or society, such as: girls and women, boys and men, people of color, religious communities, citizens in poverty, LGBT people, youth and children, and many more. This socioeconomic, cultural, political, legal, and institutional oppression (hereinafter, \"social oppression\") probably occurs in every country, culture, and society, including the most advanced democracies, such as the United States, Japan, Costa Rica, Sweden, and Canada.\n\nA single, widely accepted definition of social oppression does not yet exist, although there are commonalities. Taylor (2016) defined (social) oppression in this way:\n\nOppression is a form of injustice that occurs when one social group is subordinated while another is privileged, and oppression is maintained by a variety of different mechanisms including social norms, stereotypes and institutional rules. A key feature of oppression is that it is perpetrated by and affects social groups. ... [Oppression] occurs when a particular social group is unjustly subordinated, and where that subordination is not necessarily deliberate but instead results from a complex network of social restrictions, ranging from laws and institutions to implicit biases and stereotypes. In such cases, there may be no deliberate attempt to subordinate the relevant group, but the group is nonetheless unjustly subordinated by this network of social constraints. \n\nHarvey (1999) suggested the term \"civilized oppression\", which he introduced as follows:\n\nIt is harder still to become aware of what I call 'civilized Oppression,' that involves neither physical violence nor the use of law. Yet these subtle forms are by far the most prevalent in Western industrialized societies. This work will focus on issues that are common to such subtle oppression in several different contexts (such as racism, classism, and sexism) ... Analyzing what is involved in civilized oppression includes analyzing the kinds of mechanisms used, the power relations at work, the systems controlling perceptions and information, the kinds of harms inflicted on the victims, and the reasons why this oppression is so hard to see even by contributing agents.\n\nResearch and theory development on social oppression has advanced apace since the 1980s with the publication of seminal books and articles, and the cross-pollination of ideas and discussion among diverse disciplines, such as: feminism, sociology, psychology, philosophy, and political science. Nonetheless, more fully understanding the problem remains an extremely complicated challenge for scholars. Improved understanding will likely involve, for example, comprehending more completely the historical antecedents of current social oppression; the commonalities (and lack thereof) among the various social groups damaged by social oppression (and the individual human beings who make up those groups); and the complex interplay between and amongst sociocultural, political, economic, psychological, and legal forces that cause and support oppression.\n\nSocial oppression is when a single group in society takes advantage of, and exercises power over, another group using dominance and subordination. This results in the socially supported mistreatment and exploitation of a group of individuals by those with relative power. In a social group setting, oppression may be based on many ideas, such as poverty, gender, class, race, or other categories. Oppression by institution, or systematic oppression, is when the laws of a place create unequal treatment of a specific social identity group or groups. Another example of social oppression is when a specific social group is denied access to education that may hinder their lives in later life. Economic oppression is the divide between two classes of society. These were once determined by factors such slavery, property rights, disenfranchisement, and forced displacement of livelihood. Each divide yielded various treatments and attitudes towards each group.\n\nSocial oppression derives from power dynamics and imbalances related to the social location of a group or individual. Social location, as defined by Lynn Weber, is \"an individual's or a group's social 'place' in the race, class, gender and sexuality hierarchies, as well as in other critical social hierarchies such as age, ethnicity, and nation\". An individual's social location often determines how they will be perceived and treated by others in society. Three elements shape whether a group or individual can exercise power: the power to design or manipulate the rules and regulations, the capacity to win competitions through the exercise of political or economic force, and the ability to write and document social and political history.. There are four predominant social hierarchies, race, class, gender and sexuality, that contribute to social oppression.\n\nWeber, among some other political theorists, argues that oppression persists because most individuals fail to recognize it; that is, discrimination is often not visible to those who are not in the midst of it. Privilege refers to a sociopolitical immunity one group has over others derived from particular societal benefits. Many of the groups who have privilege over gender, race, or sexuality, for example, can be unaware of the power their privilege holds. These inequalities further perpetuate themselves because those who are oppressed rarely have access to resources that would allow them to escape their maltreatment. This can lead to internalized oppression, where subordinate groups essentially give up the fight to get access to equality, and accept their fate as a non-dominant group.\n\nThe first social hierarchy is race or racial oppression, which is defined as: \" ... burdening a specific race with unjust or cruel restraints or impositions. Racial oppression may be social, systematic, institutionalized, or internalized. Social forms of racial oppression include exploitation and mistreatment that is socially supported.\" United States history consists of five primary forms of racial oppression including genocide and geographical displacement, slavery, second-class citizenship, non-citizen labor, and diffuse racial discrimination. \n\nThe first, primary form of racial oppression—genocide and geographical displacement—in the US context refers to Western Europe and settlers taking over an Indigenous population's land. Many Indigenous people, commonly known today as Native Americans, were relocated to Indian Reservations or killed during wars fought over the land. The second form of racial oppression, slavery, refers to Africans being taken from their homeland and sold as property to white Americans. Racial oppression, particularly in the Southern United States, was a significant part of daily life and routine in which African-Americans worked on plantations and did other labor without pay and the freedom to leave their workplace. The third form of racial oppression, second-class citizenship, refers to some categories of citizens having fewer rights than others. Second-class citizenship became a pivotal form of racial oppression in the United States following the Civil War, as African-Americans who were formerly enslaved continued to be considered unequal to white citizens, and had no voting rights. Moreover, immigrants and foreign workers in the US are also treated like second-class citizens, with fewer rights than people born in the US. The fourth form of racial oppression in American history, non-citizen labor, refers to the linkage of race and legal citizenship status. During the middle of the 19th century, some categories of immigrants, such as Mexicans and Chinese, were sought as physical laborers, but were nonetheless denied legal access to citizenship status. The last form of racial oppression in American history is diffuse discrimination. This form of racial oppression refers to discriminatory actions that are not directly backed by the legal powers of the state, but take place in widespread everyday social interactions. This can include employers not hiring or promoting someone on the basis of race, landlords only renting to people of certain racial groups, salespeople treating customers differently based on race, and racialized groups having access only to impoverished schools. Even after the civil rights legislation abolishing segregation, racial oppression is still a reality in the United States. According to Robert Blauner, author of \"Racial Oppression in America\", \"racial groups and racial oppression are central features of the American social dynamic\".\nThe second social hierarchy, class oppression, sometimes referred to as classism, can be defined as prejudice and discrimination based on social class. Class is an unspoken social ranking based on income, wealth, education, status, and power. A class is a large group of people who share similar economic or social positions based on their income, wealth, property ownership, job status, education, skills, and power in the economic and political sphere. The most commonly used class categories include: upper class, middle class, working class, and poor class. A majority of people in the United States self-identify in surveys as middle class, despite vast differences in income and status. Class is also experienced differently depending on race, gender, ethnicity, global location, disability, and more. Class oppression of the poor and working class can lead to deprivation of basic needs and a feeling of inferiority to higher-class people, as well as shame towards one's traditional class, race, gender, or ethnic heritage. In the United States, class has become racialized leaving the greater percentage of people of color living in poverty. Since class oppression is universal among the majority class in American society, at times it can seem invisible, however, it is a relevant issue that causes suffering for many.\n\nThe third social hierarchy is gender oppression, which is instituted through gender norms society has adopted. In some cultures today, gender norms suggest that masculinity and femininity are opposite genders, however it is an unequal binary pair, with masculinity being dominant and femininity being subordinate. Gender as such is not natural but socially constructed, and gendered power differences provide social mechanisms that benefit masculinity. \"Many have argued that cultural practices concerning gender norms of child care, housework, appearance, and career impose an unfair burden on women and as such are oppressive.\" According to feminist Barbara Cattunar, women have always been \"subjected to many forms of oppression, backed up by religious texts which insist upon women's inferiority and subjugation\". Femininity has always been looked down upon, perpetuated by socially constructed stereotypes, which has affected women's societal status and opportunity. In current society, sources like the media further impose gendered oppression as they shape societal views. Females in pop-culture are objectified and sexualized, which can be understood as degrading to women by depicting them as sex objects with little regard for their character, political views, cultural contributions, creativity or intellect. Feminism, or struggles for women's cultural, political and economic equality, has challenged gender oppression. Gender oppression also takes place against trans, gender-non-conforming, gender queer, or non-binary individuals who do not identify with binary categories of masculine/feminine or male/female.\n\nYoung people are a commonly, yet rarely acknowledged, oppressed demographic. Minors are denied many democratic and human rights, including the rights to vote, marry, and give sexual consent. Society as a whole also tends to discriminate against young people and view them as inferior.\n\nThe fourth social hierarchy is sexuality oppression or heterosexism. Dominant societal views with respect to sexuality, and sex partner selection, have formed a sexuality hierarchy oppressing people who do not conform to heteronormativity. Heteronormativity is an underlying assumption that everyone in society is heterosexual, and those who are not are treated as different or even abnormal by society, excluded, oppressed, and sometimes subject to violence. Heterosexism also derives from societal views of the nuclear family which is presumed to be heterosexual, and dominated or controlled by the male partner. Social actions by oppressed groups such as LGBTQI movements have organized to create social change.\n\nReligious persecution is the systematic mistreatment of an individual because of their religious beliefs. According to Iris Young oppression can be divided into different categories such as powerlessness, exploitation, and violence. The first category of powerlessness in regards to religious persecution is when a group of people that follow one religion have less power than the dominant religious followers. An example of powerlessness would be during the 17th century when the pilgrims, wanting to escape the Church of England came to what is now called the United States. The pilgrims created their own religion of Protestantism, and after doing so they eventually passed laws to keep other religions from prospering. The Protestants used their power of legislature to oppress the other religions in the United States. The second category of oppression: exploitation, has been seen in many different forms around the world when it comes to religion. The definition of exploitation is the action or fact of treating someone unfairly in order to benefit from their work. For example during the American Civil War, white Americans used Chinese immigrants in order to build the transcontinental railroads. During this time it was common for the Chinese immigrants to follow the religions of Buddhism, Taoism, and Confucianism, because of this the Chinese were looked at as different and not equal to the white Americans. Due to this view it led them to unequal pay, and many hardships during their time working on the railroad. The third category that can be seen in religious persecution is violence. According to the Merriam Webster dictionary violence is \"the use of physical force so as to injure, abuse, damage, or destroy\". An example of violence in regards to religious persecution is hate crimes that occur in the United States against Muslims. Sense September 11th, 2001 hate crimes against people of the Muslim faith have greatly increased. One incident occurred on August 5th, 2017 when three men bombed a Mosque because they felt that Muslims \"'push their beliefs on everyone else'\". This violence happens to not only muslims but other religions as well.\n\nAddressing social oppression on both a macro and micro level, feminist Patricia Hill Collins discusses her \"matrix of domination\". The matrix of domination discusses the interrelated nature of four domains of power, including the structural, disciplinary, hegemonic, and interpersonal domains. Each of these spheres works to sustain current inequalities that are faced by marginalized, excluded or oppressed groups. The structural, disciplinary and hegemonic domains all operate on a macro level, creating social oppression through macro structures such as education, or the criminal justice system, which play out in the interpersonal sphere of everyday life through micro-oppressions.\n\nStandpoint theory can help us to understand the interpersonal domain. Standpoint theory deals with an individual's social location in that each person will have a very different perspective based on where they are positioned in society. For instance, a white male living in America will have a very different take on an issue such as abortion than a black female living in Africa. Each will have different knowledge claims and experiences that will have shaped how they perceive abortion. Standpoint theory is often used to expose the powerful social locations of those speaking, to justify claims of knowledge through closer experience of an issue, and to deconstruct the construction of knowledge of oppression by oppressors.\n\n\"Institutional Oppression occurs when established laws, customs, and practices systemically reflect and produce inequities based on one's membership in targeted social identity groups. If oppressive consequences accrue to institutional laws, customs, or practices, the institution is oppressive whether or not the individuals maintaining those practices have oppressive intentions.\"\nInstitutionalized oppression allows for government organizations and their employees to systematically favor specific groups of people based upon group identity. Dating back to colonization, the United States implemented the institution of slavery where Africans were brought to the United States to be a source of free labor to expand the cotton and tobacco industry. Implementing these systems by the United States government was justified through religious grounding where \"servants [were] bought and established as inheritable property\".\n\nAlthough the thirteenth, fourteenth, and fifteenth amendments freed African Americans, gave them citizenship, and provided them the right to vote, institutions such as some police departments continue to use oppressive systems against minorities. They train their officers to profile individuals based upon their racial heritage, and to exert excessive force to restrain them. Racial profiling and police brutality are \"employed to control a population thought to be undesirable, undeserving, and under punished by established law\". In both situations, police officers \"rely on legal authority to exonerate their extralegal use of force; both respond to perceived threats and fears aroused by out-groups, especially— but not exclusively— racial minorities\". For example, \"blacks are: approximately four times more likely to be targeted for police use of force than their white counterparts; arrested and convicted for drug-related criminal activities at higher rates than their overall representation in the U.S. population; and are more likely to fear unlawful and harsh treatment by law enforcement officials\". The International Association of Chiefs of Police collected data from police departments between the years 1995 and 2000 and found that 83% of incidents involving use-of-force against subjects of different races than the officer executing it involved a white officer and a black subject.\n\nInstitutionalized oppression is not only experienced by people of racial minorities, but can also affect those in the LGBT community. Oppression of the LGBT community in the United States dates back to President Eisenhower's presidency where he passed Executive Order 10450 in April 1953 which permitted non-binary sexual behaviors to be investigated by federal agencies. As a result of this order, \"More than 800 federal employees resigned or were terminated in the two years following because their files linked them in some way with homosexuality.\"\n\nOppression of the LGBT community continues today through some religious systems and their believers' justifications of discrimination based upon their own freedom of religious belief. States such as Arizona and Kansas passed laws in 2014 giving religious-based businesses \"the right to refuse service to LGBT customers\". The proposal of the Employment Non-Discrimination Act (EDNA) offers full protection of LGBT workers from job discrimination; however, the act does not offer protection against religious-based corporations and businesses, ultimately allowing the LGBT community to be discriminated against in environments such as churches and religious-based hospitals. The LGBT community is further oppressed by the United States government with the passage of the First Amendment Defense Act which states, \"Protecting religious freedom from Government intrusion is a Government interest of the highest order.\" This act essentially allows for institutions of any kind—schools, businesses, hospitals—to deny service to people based upon their sexuality because it goes against a religious belief.\n\nThe term economic oppression changes in meaning and significance over time, depending on its contextual application. In today's context, economic oppression may take several forms, including, but not limited to: the practice of bonded labour in some parts of India, serfdom, forced labour, low wages, denial of equal opportunity, and practicing employment discrimination, and economic discrimination based on sex, nationality, race, and religion.\n\nAnn Cudd describes the main forces of economic oppression as oppressive economic systems and direct and indirect forces. Even though capitalism and socialism are not inherently oppressive, they \"lend themselves to oppression in characteristic ways\". She defines direct forces of economic oppression as \"restrictions on opportunities that are applied from the outside on the oppressed, including enslavement, segregation, employment discrimination, group-based harassment, opportunity inequality, neocolonialism, and governmental corruption\". This allows for a dominant social group to maintain and maximize its wealth through the intentional exploitation of economically inferior subordinates. With indirect forces (also known as oppression by choice), \"the oppressed are co-opted into making individual choices that add to their own oppression\". The oppressed are faced with having to decide to go against their social good, and even against their own good. If they choose otherwise, they have to choose against their interests, which may lead to resentment by their group.\n\nAn example of direct forces of economic oppression is employment discrimination in the form of the gender pay gap. Restrictions on women's access to and participation in the workforce like the wage gap is an \"inequality most identified with industrialized nations with nominal equal opportunity laws; legal and cultural restrictions on access to education and jobs, inequities most identified with developing nations; and unequal access to capital, variable but identified as a difficulty in both industrialized and developing nations\". In the United States, the median weekly earnings for women were 82 percent of the median weekly earnings for men in 2016. Some argue women are prevented from achieving complete gender equality in the workplace because of the \"ideal-worker norm,\" which \"defines the committed worker as someone who works full-time and full force for forty years straight,\" a situation designed for the male sex. \n\nWomen, in contrast, are still expected to fulfill the caretaker role and take time off for domestic needs such as pregnancy and ill family members, preventing them from conforming to the \"ideal-worker norm\". With the current norm in place, women are forced to juggle full-time jobs and family care at home. Others believe that this difference in wage earnings is likely due to the supply and demand for women in the market because of family obligations. Eber and Weichselbaumer argue that \"over time, raw wage differentials worldwide have fallen substantially. Most of this decrease is due to better labor market endowments of females\".\n\nIndirect economic oppression is exemplified when individuals work abroad to support their families. Outsourced employees, working abroad generally little to no bargaining power not only with their employers, but with immigration authorities as well. They could be forced to accept low wages and work in poor living conditions. And by working abroad, an outsourced employee contributes to the economy of a foreign country instead of their own. Veltman and Piper describe the effects of outsourcing on female laborers abroad:\nHer work may be oppressive first in respects of being heteronomous: she may enter work under conditions of constraint; her work may bear no part of reflectively held life goals; and she may not even have the: freedom of bodily movement at work. Her work may also fail to permit a meaningful measure of economic independence or to help her support herself or her family, which she identifies as the very purpose of her working.\n\nBy deciding to work abroad, laborers are \"reinforcing the forces of economic oppression that presented them with such poor options\".\n\nAlthough a relatively modern form of resistance, feminism's origins can be traced back to the events leading up to the introduction of the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA) in 1923. While the ERA was created to address the need for equal protection under the law between men and women in the workplace, it spurred increased feminism that has come to represent the search for equal opportunity and respect for women in patriarchal societies, across all social, cultural, and political spheres. Demonstrations and marches have been a popular medium of support, with the January 21, 2017, Women's March's replication in major cities across the world drawing tens of thousands of supporters. Feminists' main talking points consist of women's reproductive rights, the closing of the pay gap between men and women, the glass ceiling and workplace discrimination, and the intersectionality of feminism with other major issues such as African-American rights, immigration freedoms, and gun violence.\n\nResistance to oppression has been linked to a moral obligation, an act deemed necessary for the preservation of self and society. Still, resistance to oppression has been largely overlooked in terms of the amount of research and number of studies completed on the topic, and therefore, is often largely misinterpreted as \"lawlessness, belligerence, envy, or laziness\". Over the last two centuries, resistance movements have risen that specifically aim to oppose, analyze, and counter various types of oppression, as well as to increase public awareness and support of groups marginalized and disadvantaged by systematic oppression. Late 20th century resistance movements such as liberation theology and anarchism set the stage for mass critiques of, and resistance to, forms of social and institutionalized oppression that have been subtly enforced and reinforced over time. Resistance movements of the 21st century have furthered the missions of activists across the world, and movements such as liberalism, Black Lives Matter (related: Blue Lives Matter, All Lives Matter) and feminism (related: Meninism) are some of the most prominent examples of resistance to oppression today.\n\nCudd, Ann E.

Each of the 17 items describe PTSD symptoms which respondents rate in terms of their frequency or severity using a Likert-type scale ranging from 0 (not at all or only one time) to 3 (almost always or five or more times per week). Ratings on items are summed to create three subscales, including re-experiencing, avoidance, and arousal, as well as a total score (that ranges from 0 to 51). All items of the PSS-SR should be answered and assessment is done by total score. The total score higher than 13 indicates on likelihood of PTSD.\n\n"}
{"id": "18012669", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18012669", "title": "Probate court", "text": "Probate court\n\nA probate court (sometimes called a surrogate court) is a court that has competence in a jurisdiction to deal with matters of probate and the administration of estates. In some jurisdictions, such courts may be referred to as Orphans' Courts, or courts of ordinary. In some jurisdictions probate court functions are performed by a chancery court or another court of equity, or as a part or division of another court. \n\nProbate courts administer proper distribution of the assets of a decedent (one who has died), adjudicates the validity of wills, enforces the provisions of a valid will (by issuing the grant of probate), prevents malfeasance by executors and administrators of estates, and provides for the equitable distribution of the assets of persons who die intestate (without a valid will), such as by granting a grant of administration giving judicial approval to the personal representative to administer matters of the estate. \n\nIn contested matters, the probate court examines the authenticity of a will and decides who is to receive the deceased person's property. In a case of an intestacy, the court determines who is to receive the deceased's property under the law of its jurisdiction. The probate court will then oversee the process of distributing the deceased's assets to the proper beneficiaries. A probate court can be petitioned by interested parties in an estate, such as when a beneficiary feels that an estate is being mishandled. The court has the authority to compel an executor to give an account of their actions.\n\nIn some jurisdictions (e.g. Texas) probate courts also handle other matters, such as guardianships, trusts, and mental health issues (including the authority to order involuntary commitment to psychiatric facilities).\n\nAn Orphans' Court was an organization established in the Chesapeake Bay American colonies during colonization. The major goal of the organization was to protect orphaned children and their right to their deceased family member's estate from claims and against abuses by stepparents and others.\n\nToday, at least in Maryland and Pennsylvania, probate courts are still called Orphans' Courts, for historical reasons, hearing matters involving wills of deceased estates which are contested and supervising estates which are probated judicially.\n\nThe following is a partial list of probate courts:\n\n\n\n"}

Prisoners would have their \"alarm excited\", and in some instances have \"flesh ... torn from the arms and legs\".\n\nDuring the Dutch Revolt, Diederik Sonoy, an ally of William the Silent, is documented to have used a method where a pottery bowl filled with rats was placed open side down on the naked body of a prisoner. When hot charcoal was piled on the bowl, the rats would \"gnaw into the very bowels of the victim\" in an attempt to escape the heat.\n\nRat torture appears in the famous case study of a patient of Sigmund Freud. The Rat Man obsessed that his father and lady friend would be subjected to this torture.\n\nRat torture was allegedly used in Brazil during the military regime of 1964-1985, in Chile during the regime of Augusto Pinochet (1973–1990) and in Argentina during the period of the National Reorganization Process (1976–1983). The report of CONADEP in Argentina detailed the use of a torture method known as \"the recto-scope\" (reserved primarily for Jewish prisoners) which consisted of inserting living rats into a victim's rectum or vagina through a tube. Amnesty International documented the case of a woman tortured by the Chilean CNI (National Intelligence Agency) in 1981, who described being kept in a room full of live rats during interrogation.\n\nOn October 16, 2010, in Lakewood Township, New Jersey, David Wax was alleged to have threatened kidnap victim Yisrael Bryskman with rat torture unless he agreed to give his wife a get. He was sentenced to 7 years imprisonment for assisting in a kidnapping.\n\nRats are featured in the Edgar Allan Poe story \"The Pit and the Pendulum\". The narrator lies on the rack, and can only watch as a scythe swings back and forth, approaching closer each time, as rats swarm over his body. The narrator later manages to make the rats eat through the straps.\n\nAn account similar to the Sonoy torture appears in the 1899 Octave Mirbeau novel \"The Torture Garden\", and psychologist Leonard Shengold has identified this as the possible source of the story that the Rat Man told Freud. Part of the book, an imaginary dialog between a torturer and a beautiful woman who is sexually excited by the accounts, is set in China.\n\nThe threat of rat torture occurs in \"Nineteen Eighty-Four\". The central character, Winston Smith, is arrested by the Ministry of Love, and undergoes a process of mental reprogramming. The ministry imprisons him in Room 101. Here Winston must face his greatest fear: rats. A cage filled with hungry rats is placed over his head, their only source of food or escape being by eating their way through Winston's face. At this point Winston breaks and begs that the method actually be used on his lover Julia, a sign that he has finally been broken.\n\n\n"}

Puno\n\nEnrico de Jesus Puno (February 13, 1953 – October 30, 2018), better known as Rico J. Puno, was a Filipino singer, composer, comedian, actor and television host who was credited as a pioneer-promoter of original Filipino music. He started the trend of incorporating Tagalog lyrics in his rendition of the American song \"The Way We Were\" and other foreign songs. Puno became known as a singer who regularly infused his on-stage performance with tongue-in-cheek comedy and adult humor. He hosted the noontime variety show \"Pilipinas Win na Win\" alongside Rey Valera, Marco Sison and Nonoy Zuñiga for two months in 2010 replacing Kris Aquino. He also hosted on \"Happy Yipee Yehey!\" together with John Estrada, Randy Santiago, Mariel Rodriguez, Pokwang and Toni Gonzaga as one of the main host replacing \"Pilipinas Win na Win\".\n\nPuno was also active in politics. In 1998, he was elected as the City Councilor of Makati City from its 1st district until his third and last term ended in 2007. He ran for a comeback in 2010 as the vice mayoralty candidate of Makati City, but was unsuccessful. In 2016, Puno was elected as a councilor in Makati, under the United Nationalist Alliance (UNA) until his death.\n\nPuno was born in Manila to parents, Felipe Puno Sr. and Corazon J. Puno. Although he earned a Bachelor of Arts degree from the Philippine School of Business Administration, Puno dreamed of becoming a singer.\n\nPuno introduced himself and his talent to the entertainment business by performing at folk houses and small clubs in Metro Manila. In 1975, while singing at the \"Palazzi\", Puno met and performed with the American Motown group, \"The Temptations\". Puno's talent was later noticed by the executive producers from Vicor Records (now Vicor Music). His first record was \"Love Won't Let Me Wait\", while his first big hit was the Tagalog-infused \"The Way We Were\".\n\nIn 1976, Puno won the Aliw Award for \"Most Promising Entertainer\". Two years later, he became Aliw's \"Entertainer of the Year\". His \"Rico in Concert\" show at the Cultural Center of the Philippines launched him as one of the foremost Philippine pop stars.\n\nIn 1977, Puno covered the Carpenters song \"Merry Christmas Darling\" from his first Christmas album, \"The Spirit of Christmas\" which was originally sung by Karen Carpenter.\n\nIn 1978, Puno's popularity and his regular concerts at the Araneta Coliseum (now SMART Araneta Coliseum) in Quezon City and his performance tours in the United States broke records in terms of audience attendance. His fame also made him into a sought-after product endorser including advertisements for San Miguel Beer in the 1970s.\n\nIn 1979, Puno represented the Philippines at the Tokyo Music Festival, with \"Lupa\" (Ground), a song that imparted messages on how an individual could strive to change for the better, on how to gain humility and other human values, on how not to judge others, and on how to struggle against one's own weaknesses.\nFrom 2001, the \"Greatest Hits\" series in Manila, produced by Viva Concerts helped maintain Puno's popularity. These \"Greatest Hits\" concerts brought him together with other \"Greatest Hitmakers\" in the Philippine music scene during the 1980s, namely Philippine pop icons: [[Hajji Alejandro]], [[Rey Valera]], [[Nonoy Zuñiga]] and [[Marco Sison]].\n\nHe also covered the song \"Ang Huling El-Bimbo\" in 2005 and originally composed by Ely Buendia, who was originally from the [[Eraserheads]].\n\nHe also covered the song \"Mabuti Pa Sila\" in 2010 and originally composed and recorded by Gary Granada.\n\nDuring Puno's recent performances, he is often joined on stage by his oldest daughter, Tosca Camille. Rico's son, Rox is also a singer and a band member.\n\nRico was honored and awarded recently in \"ASAP Pinoy\" on ASAP show on ABS-CBN contributing his best in singing performing as a total entertainer who celebrating his 40th anniversary in music and entertainment movie and TV career in 2017.\n\nPuno's hit songs included \"Kapalaran\" (Fate), \"Buhat\" (Ever Since), \"Macho Gwapito\" (Gorgeous Young Man), \"Lupa\" (Soil or Ground), \"Damdamin\" (Feelings), \"May Bukas Pa\" (There's Still Tomorrow), \"Ang Tao'y Marupok\" (People Are Weak), \"Magkasuyo Buong Gabi\" (Together Through the Night) - a duet with Elsa Chan - and his Filipino rendition of \"You Don't Have To Be A Star (To Be In My Show)\".\n\nOne of Puno's recent albums, is \"Aliw\" by [[Sony BMG]] Records. His carrier single was \"Kay Hirap Mong Limutin\" (It Is Hard To Forget You) by [[Lito Camo]].\n\nThe duration of Puno's career spanned more than four decades. He was a favorite of the [[PAGCOR|Philippine Amusement and Games Corporation]] (PAGCOR) and other casinos around Metro Manila and the provinces. His performances included tours in the United States, [[Canada]], [[Dubai]], [[Hong Kong]], [[Japan]], [[Australia]] and [[Europe]]an countries.\n\nOwing to his rising popularity, various TV networks and movie producers soon came knocking on his door for more acting/hosting opportunities. [[GMA Network]] hired Puno to host a noontime variety show, \"[[Lunch Date]]\" which first aired on March 1986 and served as a replacement for \"[[Student Canteen]]\". However, in 1987 he left the show after it reformatted. In 1994-1995 he headlined another noontime show, \"Chibugan Na\" (It's Eating Time), aired on weekdays at 12 noon on [[Radio Philippines Network|RPN 9]], with Hajji Alejandro.\n\nPuno returned as TV host for \"Macho Guwapito\" on the now-defunct Makisig Network. He was one of the judges in the inaugural week of the reality talent show [[Showtime (Philippines)|Showtime]] on [[ABS-CBN]]. In 2010, he also hosted \"[[Pilipinas Win na Win]]\" and \"[[Happy Yipee Yehey]]!\" in 2011-2012.\n\nPuno is also the owner of the [[karaoke]] bar, \"Coriks\", at Vito Cruz Extension, Manila. He also manages a trucking business.\n\nHe won a seat in the [[Makati City]] Council from the first district in 1998. Among Puno's notable ordinances filed during his first term was the installation of a surveillance camera in every convenience store in Makati that operates 24 hours a day, as protection against robbers who prey on convenience stores. He left the city council after his third and final consecutive term ended in 2007. His seat in the city council was kept by his eldest daughter, Tosca Camille. Three years later, he teamed up with [[Jejomar Binay, Jr.|Jun-Jun Binay]] to run for city vice mayor in [[Makati City]].

He appeared in more than 50 films, including \"The Time Machine\" (1960), \"The Birds\" (1963), and \"One Hundred and One Dalmatians\" (1961).\n\nTaylor was born on 11 January 1930 in Lidcombe, a suburb of Sydney, the only child of William Sturt Taylor, a steel construction contractor and commercial artist, and Mona Taylor (née Thompson), a writer of more than a hundred short stories and children's books. His middle name comes from his great-great grand uncle, Captain Charles Sturt, a British explorer of the Australian Outback in the 19th century.\n\nTaylor attended Parramatta High School and later studied at the East Sydney Technical and Fine Arts College. For a time he worked as a commercial artist, but decided to become an actor after seeing Laurence Olivier in an Old Vic touring production of \"Richard III\".\n\nTaylor acquired extensive radio and stage experience in Australia, where his radio work included a period on \"Blue Hills\" and a role as Tarzan. Earlier in his career he had to support himself by working at Sydney's Mark Foy's department store, designing and painting window and other displays during the day. In 1951, he took part in a re-enactment of Charles Sturt's voyage down the Murrumbidgee and Murray Rivers, playing Sturt's offsider, George Macleay. A short documentary, \"Inland with Sturt\" (1951), was based on it. Taylor also appeared in a number of theatre productions for Australia's Mercury Theatre.\n\nTaylor made his feature film debut in the Australian Lee Robinson film \"King of the Coral Sea\" (1954), playing an American. He later played Israel Hands in a Hollywood-financed film shot in Sydney, \"Long John Silver\" (1954), an unofficial sequel to \"Treasure Island\". Following these two films, Taylor was awarded the 1954 Rola Show Australian Radio Actor of the Year Award, which included a ticket to London via Los Angeles, but Taylor did not continue on to London.\n\nTaylor soon landed roles in television shows such as \"Studio 57\" and the films \"Hell on Frisco Bay\" (1955) and \"Giant\" (1956). In 1955, he guest-starred in the third episode (\"The Argonauts\") of the first hour-long Western television series, \"Cheyenne\", an ABC program starring Clint Walker. Taylor and Edward Andrews played gold seekers Clancy and Duncan, respectively, who are best friends until they strike it rich, only to see Native Americans release their gold dust to the wind. The episode was a remake of the film \"The Treasure of the Sierra Madre\" (1948). Taylor was considered for one of the leads in Warner Bros. Television's \"Maverick\".\n\nToward the end of 1955, Taylor unsuccessfully screen tested to play boxer Rocky Graziano in Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer's \"Somebody Up There Likes Me\" after James Dean's death, but his use of a Brooklyn accent and physical prowess in the test impressed the studio enough to gain him a long-term contract. At MGM, he played a series of support roles in \"The Catered Affair\" (1956), \"Raintree County\" (1957), and \"Ask Any Girl\" (1959). He had a significant role in \"Separate Tables\" (1958), which won Oscars for two of its stars, David Niven and Wendy Hiller. He also made a strong impression guest-starring in an episode of \"The Twilight Zone\" titled \"And When the Sky Was Opened\" (1959).\n\nTaylor's first leading role in a feature film was in \"The Time Machine\" (1960), George Pal's adaptation of the science-fiction classic by H. G. Wells, with Taylor as the time traveler who, thousands of years in the future, falls for a woman played by Yvette Mimieux. Taylor played a character not unlike that of his \"Twilight Zone\" episode of a year earlier and the film \"World Without End\" in 1956.\n\nIn or around 1960, he was approached regarding the role of James Bond in the first feature-length Bond film. Taylor reportedly declined to become involved because he considered the character of Bond \"beneath him\". Taylor later commented: \"Every time a new Bond picture became a smash hit ... I tore out my hair.\" \n\nIn the 1960–1961 television season, Taylor starred as foreign correspondent Glenn Evans in the ABC dramatic series \"Hong Kong\". His principal co-star was Lloyd Bochner; Jack Kruschen played the bartender, Tully. The program faced stiff competition on Wednesday evenings from NBC's \"Wagon Train\", hence lasted for only one season. He voiced Pongo (a Dalmatian dog) in Disney's animated feature \"One Hundred and One Dalmatians\" (1961) and also guest-starred on Marilyn Maxwell's short-lived ABC series \"Bus Stop\" around the same time. In 1962, he starred in an episode of NBC's \"The DuPont Show of the Week\" (\"The Ordeal of Dr. Shannon\"), an adaptation of A. J. Cronin's novel \"Shannon's Way\".\n\nTaylor starred in Alfred Hitchcock's horror/thriller \"The Birds\" (1963), along with Tippi Hedren, Suzanne Pleshette, Veronica Cartwright, and Jessica Tandy, playing a man whose town and home come under attack by menacing birds. Taylor then starred with Jane Fonda in the romantic comedy \"Sunday in New York\" (also 1963).\n\nDuring the mid-1960s, Taylor worked mostly for MGM. His credits including \"The V.I.P.s\" (1963), his first feature film role as an Australian, with Richard Burton, Elizabeth Taylor, and Maggie Smith; \"Fate Is the Hunter\" (for 20th Century Fox, 1964) with Glenn Ford and Suzanne Pleshette; \"36 Hours\" (1964) with James Garner; \"Young Cassidy\" (1965) with Julie Christie and Maggie Smith; \"The Liquidator\" (1965) with Jill St. John; \"Do Not Disturb\" (1965); and \"The Glass Bottom Boat\" (1966), both co-starring Doris Day.\n\nHe began to change his image toward the end of the decade to more tough-guy roles, such as \"Chuka\" (1967), which he also produced, and he starred in \"Dark of the Sun\" (or \"The Mercenaries\", 1968), again with Yvette Mimieux; \"Nobody Runs Forever\" (1968) where he played New South Wales Police Sergeant Scobie Malone, this being Taylor's first starring feature film role as an Australian; and \"Darker than Amber\" (1970) as Travis McGee.\n\nHe was also reportedly up for the role of martial artist Roper in the Bruce Lee vehicle \"Enter the Dragon\" (1973). The film was directed by Robert Clouse, who had also directed Taylor in the film \"Darker than Amber\" (1970). Taylor was supposedly deemed too tall for the part, and the role instead went to John Saxon.\n\nIn 1973, Taylor was cast in \"The Train Robbers\" with John Wayne and Ann-Margret. The film was a box office success. Taylor also had some television roles: he starred in \"Bearcats!\" (1971) on CBS and in \"The Oregon Trail\" (1976) on NBC. He had a regular role in the short-lived spy drama series \"Masquerade\" (1983) and played one of the leads in the equally short-lived series, \"Outlaws\" (1986). From 1988 to 1990, Taylor appeared in the CBS drama series \"Falcon Crest\" as Frank Agretti, playing opposite Jane Wyman. In the mid 1990s, he appeared in several episodes of \"Murder, She Wrote\" and \"Walker, Texas Ranger\".\n\nIn 1993, he hosted the documentary \"\". The special ended with a mini-sequel written by David Duncan, the screenwriter of the George Pal film. Taylor recreated his role as George, reuniting him with Filby (Alan Young).\n\nTaylor returned to Australia several times over the years to make films, playing a 1920s traveling showman in \"The Picture Show Man\" (1977) and a paid killer in \"On the Run\" (1983). In the black comedy \"Welcome to Woop Woop\" (1997), he played the foul-mouthed redneck Daddy-O.\n\nBy the late 1990s, Taylor had moved into semi-retirement. In 2007, he appeared in the horror telemovie \"Kaw\", which revisits the idea of marauding birds turning on their human tormentors. In this film, however, the cause of the disturbance was discovered by Taylor who plays the town doctor. He appeared in Quentin Tarantino's \"Inglourious Basterds\" in 2009, portraying Winston Churchill in a cameo. In 2017, a documentary on Taylor's life, \"Pulling No Punches\", was released and entered into the Beverly Hills Film Festival.\n\nTaylor married his third wife, Carol Kikumura, on 15 October 1980. He is the father of now retired CNN financial reporter Felicia Taylor (born 1964) from his second marriage to model Mary Hilem (1 June 1963 – 18 September 1969). His first wife was model Peggy Williams (1951–1954).\n\nTaylor suffered a fatal heart attack on January 7, 2015, in Beverly Hills, California, at the age of 84, four days short of his 85th birthday.\n\n\nTaylor had several lead roles in television, from the early 1960s to the early first decade of the 21st century.

Based on ideas pioneered by Isambard Kingdom Brunel's SS \"Great Britain\" of 1845, \"City of Glasgow\" established that Atlantic steamships could be operated profitably without government subsidy. After a refit in 1852, she was also the first Atlantic steamship to carry steerage passengers, representing a significant improvement in the conditions experienced by immigrants. In March 1854 \"City of Glasgow\" vanished at sea with no known survivors.\n\nBuilt by Tod & Macgregor of Partick, Glasgow and launched on 28 February 1850, \"City of Glasgow\" initially carried 44 first class and 85 second class passengers along with 1,200 tons of cargo. Her iron hull considerably reduced repair costs incurred by the wooden-hulled steamships of the day, and the use of a propeller instead of paddle wheels allowed more space for passengers and cargo. \"City of Glasgow\" was especially economical because she was not built for speed; her best time across the Atlantic was 14 days, 4 hours, almost 4 days longer than Cunard Line's \"Asia\", the record holder in 1850. While the \"City of Glasgow's\" two lever-beam engines of 350 horsepower produced a moderate 9.5 knots, her coal consumption was only 20 tons per day, compared with 76 tons for \"Asia\".\n\nShe made five voyages on the Glasgow – New York City service on Tod & Macgregor's own account and sailed on her maiden voyage on 15 April 1850. \"City of Glasgow\" was the first steamship to travel from Glasgow to New York. William Inman, a business partner of the line of sailing packets, persuaded his other partners to expand their line by buying the advanced new steamship. On 5 October 1850, she was purchased by the newly formed Liverpool and Philadelphia Steam Ship Company (also known as the Inman Line) and moved to the Liverpool – Philadelphia route from 17 December 1850. In 1852, the company entered the immigrant trade and \"City of Glasgow\" was refitted to accommodate an additional 400 third class passengers in her holds.\n\nCabins were available in state rooms from fifteen to twenty one guineas for each berth. Steerage passengers were charged eight guineas. Dogs were £3. \n\n\"City of Glasgow\" left Liverpool on the 1 March 1854, with 480 people on board. There were 111 cabin and saloon passengers and 293 in steerage. Her crew was 76; 5 Captain and officers, 1 surgeon, 1 purser, 4 engineers, 6 firemen, 5 coal trimmers, 19 stewards and waiters, 1 stewardess, 1 quartermaster and 30 able seamen. She sailed under Captain K. Morrison. This was his first voyage in command, but he had served as her chief officer for many months before. He was reported to have considerable experience in navigating the Atlantic. The ship was due to return from Philadelphia on the 25th March 1854.\n\nNo word was received from the ship after she left Liverpool. Her sister ship the \"City of Manchester\" met many icebergs and large fields of ice on her journey from Philadelphia on the 8 March. Other ships reported that the ice was greater than had been witnessed for many years. Large icebergs and fields of ice were in the course that the steamers usually used. When news of her delay reached the ship's owners, they issued a report stating that they felt the ship had been detained in the ice. She was well supplied with water, coal and provisions. However, by the end of May 1854 she was accepted as lost. The ship and her cargo was insured for £50,000. \n\nHer fate remains a mystery. Newspapers of the day reported various sightings of the ship, but these were often contradictory. For example, the Captain of the \"Baldaur\" spotted a large steamer with a list to port on the 21 April, however he asserted was \"unlike that ill-fated vessel\". The \"Mary Morris\" came upon the hull of large iron vessel that was apparently Clyde built and thought to be of the \"City of Glasgow\". However the owners of the \"City of Glasgow\" ascertained that this was in fact the \"Shannon\" from Glasgow to Montreal. \n\nIt was reported that a portion of the bow of a ship, bearing the name \"City of Glasgow\" in gilded letters, washed ashore at Ballochgair near Campbeltown on 25 October 1854. However another ship called \"City of Glasgow\" at 416 tons had sailed from the Clyde under Muir towards Calcutta at the end of October. She may have been caught in late gales in the area but continued on her way. Lloyd's List reported a head-board been found with \"City of Glasgow\" on it in Kilbrannan Sound around the same time. This may be related to the Campbeltown find. \n\n\n"}

Once the \"ghost video\" was uploaded onto YouTube it quickly attracted widespread attention and many improbable suggestions as to its origin. Benjamin Radford, a managing editor of \"Skeptical Inquirer\" investigated the sighting and concluded that the origin of the ghost was nothing more than a bug crawling across the camera lens.\n\nOn Friday, June 15, 2007, a bright, round object was recorded by a surveillance camera moving around in the image of the rear entrance of the First Judicial District courthouse, Catron Street, Santa Fe. The recording, starting at 7:27:11 a.m., shows a bright spot of light that comes into view at the top right hand corner of the image before moving downwards and out of the cameras field of view in the bottom left hand side of the image at 7:27:23 a.m. After Jason Auslander of \"The Santa Fe New Mexican\" reported on the event and uploaded the footage to Youtube it was picked up by various news outlets such as \"ABC News\", \"CBS News\", \"Fox News\", \"The Boston Globe\" and \"The San Francisco Chronicle\" and promptly became a topic of discussion all over the country. \n\nSoon after the footage was released to the public, a large number of people contacted the \"Santa Fe New Mexican\" and Auslander proposing various theories on what the object was. Some thought the object might be ball lightning, others were convinced they could see a face in the image. One woman who claimed to be a spiritual reader said she saw five separate spirits in the video and another person advised the journalist to consult a \"reputable channeler\". \"The New Mexican\" website logged thousands of hits for the video. The video was later uploaded to YouTube and was viewed more than 50,000 times within a couple of days, reaching the top 15 videos on the site at that time. This drew hundreds of additional e-mails from people to the news outlet.\n\nMany predictions were made about the real identity of the mysterious object within the staff of the courthouse as well. Some people supposed that it was the ghost of convicted murderer Andy Lopez, who was shot and killed at the courthouse after taking nine people hostage in February 1985. Other pseudo-scientific predictions included a spirit of a little girl who was lost and a different ghost who had been disturbed by the construction of a convention centre across the street. However, some more realistic hypotheses from the courthouse staff were that it might be a cottonwood seed, someone walking with a light on their head, an insect or spider walking on the camera lens or a reflection, perhaps from a passing car. Vanessa Pacheco, who was the supervisor of the court security for the Santa Fe County Sheriff’s Office, said people’s opinions on the video depended on whether they believe in ghosts.\n\nBenjamin Radford, the deputy editor of \"Skeptical Inquirer\" science magazine, a \"LiveScience\" columnist and author of hundreds of articles and several books on science, skepticism, and the paranormal, was invited at the request of \"The New Mexican\" to do research on the phenomenon. After the first day of his investigation he had ruled out a number of potential causes including camera artefacts, reflections and hoaxes. Of the chances of the image being a hoax he said \"It was almost certainly not a hoax, because it’s unlikely anyone would think to make a blurry, indistinguishable blob on a courthouse surveillance video\". Having investigated many similar ghost videos of this type, he said that \"the quality of the image is often inversely proportional to the belief that the object is a ghost; the fuzzier and more ambiguous the form, the more likely a ghost will be offered as an explanation\". \n\nHe believed the undetermined object was most likely a fluffy cottonwood seed or a spider or insect crawling across the camera lens. To find out what lay behind the mystery, he conducted two sets of experiments, one by scattering cotton from the adjacent cottonwood tree and one by using insects. The first experiment involved collecting cottonwood fluff from a nearby tree and blowing it into the air in front of the camera using a blow tube. This proved to be inconclusive since the image cotton didn’t represent a glowing fluffy ball the same as the one in the original recording. \n\nThe second experiment using bugs, in the end, was more successful. Radford originally tried to coax a small moth to fly in front of the camera lens but was unsuccessful. He then purchased 1,750 ladybugs from a local supplier and came back to next day at 7:00am hoping to get a result using the same lighting conditions as when the event was originally recorded. After placing the bugs on the camera he waited a while to let them crawl all over it before going inside to review the recording. Initially the bugs didn't appear to create the same glowing image as was first recorded but at 7:26am they finally had success. The sun hit one of the bugs crawling across the lens and the effect recreated an accurate \"ghost\" down to its color, size, shape and movement. The courthouse staff watching the recording agreed that the mystery had been solved thoroughly and the origin of the ghost was nothing more than a bug. A detailed report on Radford’s experiments was published in \"Skeptical Inquirer\" magazine's September/October issue that year, and in 2014 in Radford's book Mysterious New Mexico.\n\n\n"}

He was purchased for $80.00 on his way to a slaughterhouse and became a champion in show jumping in the United States during the 1950s. During his career he was known as \"The Cinderella Horse\" due to his \"rags to riches\" story.\n\nSnowman was originally used for farm work and in 1956 was headed for the slaughterhouse at eight years of age. On that day, Harry de Leyer, a Long Island, New York, riding instructor, attended the horse auction in New Holland, Pennsylvania, looking for school horses. He arrived late, and the only remaining horses were those waiting to be loaded into trucks bound for slaughter plants. De Leyer made eye contact with a large gray horse that he purchased for $80. He first used Snowman as a lesson horse for children. De Leyer recognized talent in the horse after he sold him to a neighbor and the horse jumped high fences to return home. De Leyer then began training Snowman as a show jumper.\n\nThe horse began winning prestigious classes only two years after he was bought off the slaughter truck, and his career lasted five years. He was photographed performing unusual feats such as jumping over other horses, and his calm disposition made him a favorite. He once won a leadline class and an open jumper championship on the same day.\n\nSnowman also appeared on television shows (Johnny Carson's for one, where Carson climbed on his back). He was the subject of two books, had his own fan club, and was flown abroad for \"guest appearances\".\n\nDe Leyer kept Snowman through his retirement until the animal was euthanized in the fall of 1974 due to complications from kidney failure at the age of twenty-six.\n\nSnowman was inducted into the United States Show Jumping Hall of Fame in 1992. In 2005, Snowman was made into a Breyer horse model on the Gem Twist mold, which is no longer manufactured. In 2013, Snowman was again introduced in the Breyer line on the Idocus mold.

Leadbeater, a Theosophist, also taught that those who were good in their previous earthly incarnation went to a place called Summerland between incarnations.\n\nIn Theosophy, the term \"Summerland\" is used without the definite article \"the\". Summerland, also called the Astral plane Heaven, is depicted as where souls who have been good in their previous lives go between incarnations. \n\nTheosophists believe the Summerlands are maintained by hosts of planetary angels serving Sanat Kumara, the Nordic alien from Venus who Theosophists believe is the governing deity of Earth and leader of the Spiritual Hierarchy of Earth.

{"id": "47387", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=47387", "title": "William III of England", "text": "William III of England\n\nWilliam III (; 4 November 1650 – 8 March 1702), also widely known as William of Orange, was sovereign Prince of Orange from birth, Stadtholder of Holland, Zeeland, Utrecht, Gelderland and Overijssel in the Dutch Republic from 1672 and King of England, Ireland and Scotland from 1689 until his death in 1702. As King of Scotland, he is known as William II. He is sometimes informally known in Northern Ireland and Scotland as \"King Billy\".\n\nWilliam inherited the principality of Orange from his father, William II, who died a week before William's birth. His mother, Mary, was the daughter of King Charles I of England. In 1677, he married his fifteen-year-old first cousin, Mary, the daughter of his maternal uncle James, Duke of York.\n\nA Protestant, William participated in several wars against the powerful Catholic King of France, Louis XIV, in coalition with Protestant and Catholic powers in Europe. Many Protestants heralded him as a champion of their faith. In 1685, William's Catholic uncle and father-in-law, James, became king of England, Scotland and Ireland. James's reign was unpopular with the Protestant majority in Britain. William, supported by a group of influential British political and religious leaders, invaded England in what became known as the \"Glorious Revolution\". On 5 November 1688, he landed at the southern English port of Brixham. James was deposed and William and Mary became joint sovereigns in his place. William and Mary reigned together until Mary's death on 28 December 1694, after which William ruled as sole monarch.\n\nWilliam's reputation as a staunch Protestant enabled him to take power in Britain when many were fearful of a revival of Catholicism under James. William's victory at the Battle of the Boyne in 1690 is still commemorated by loyalists in Northern Ireland and Scotland. His reign in Britain marked the beginning of the transition from the personal rule of the Stuarts to the more Parliament-centred rule of the House of Hanover.\n\nWilliam III was born in The Hague in the Dutch Republic on 4 November 1650. Baptised William Henry (), he was the only child of stadtholder William II, Prince of Orange, and Mary, Princess Royal. Mary was the eldest daughter of King Charles I of England, Scotland and Ireland and sister of King Charles II and King James II and VII.\n\nEight days before William was born, his father died of smallpox; thus William was the Sovereign Prince of Orange from the moment of his birth. Immediately, a conflict ensued between his mother the Princess Royal and William II's mother, Amalia of Solms-Braunfels, over the name to be given to the infant. Mary wanted to name him Charles after her brother, but her mother-in-law insisted on giving him the name William or \"Willem\" to bolster his prospects of becoming stadtholder. William II had appointed his wife as his son's guardian in his will; however, the document remained unsigned at William II's death and was void. On 13 August 1651, the \"Hoge Raad van Holland en Zeeland\" (Supreme Court) ruled that guardianship would be shared between his mother, his paternal grandmother and Frederick William, Elector of Brandenburg, whose wife, Louise Henriette, was William II's eldest sister.\n\nWilliam's mother showed little personal interest in her son, sometimes being absent for years, and had always deliberately kept herself apart from Dutch society. William's education was first laid in the hands of several Dutch governesses, some of English descent, including Walburg Howard and the Scottish noblewoman, Lady Anna Mackenzie. From April 1656, the prince received daily instruction in the Reformed religion from the Calvinist preacher Cornelis Trigland, a follower of the Contra-Remonstrant theologian Gisbertus Voetius. The ideal education for William was described in \"Discours sur la nourriture de S. H. Monseigneur le Prince d'Orange\", a short treatise, perhaps by one of William's tutors, Constantijn Huygens. In these lessons, the prince was taught that he was predestined to become an instrument of Divine Providence, fulfilling the historical destiny of the House of Orange-Nassau.\n\nFrom early 1659, William spent seven years at the University of Leiden for a formal education, under the guidance of ethics professor Hendrik Bornius (though never officially enrolling as a student). While residing in the \"Prinsenhof\" at Delft, William had a small personal retinue including Hans Willem Bentinck, and a new governor, Frederick Nassau de Zuylenstein, who (as an illegitimate son of stadtholder Frederick Henry of Orange) was his paternal uncle.\n\nGrand Pensionary Johan de Witt and his uncle Cornelis de Graeff pushed the States of Holland to take charge of William's education and ensure that he would acquire the skills to serve in a future—though undetermined—state function; the States acted on 25 September 1660. This first involvement of the authorities did not last long. On 23 December 1660, when William was ten years old, his mother died of smallpox at Whitehall Palace, London, while visiting her brother, the recently restored King Charles II. In her will, Mary requested that Charles look after William's interests, and Charles now demanded that the States of Holland end their interference. To appease Charles, they complied on 30 September 1661. That year, Zuylenstein began to work for Charles and induced William to write letters to his uncle asking him to help William become stadtholder someday. After his mother's death, William's education and guardianship became a point of contention between his dynasty's supporters and the advocates of a more republican Netherlands.\n\nThe Dutch authorities did their best at first to ignore these intrigues, but in the Second Anglo-Dutch War one of Charles's peace conditions was the improvement of the position of his nephew. As a countermeasure in 1666, when William was sixteen, the States officially made him a ward of the government, or a \"Child of State\". All pro-English courtiers, including Zuylenstein, were removed from William's company. William begged De Witt to allow Zuylenstein to stay, but he refused. De Witt, the leading politician of the Republic, took William's education into his own hands, instructing him weekly in state matters and joining him for regular games of real tennis.\n\nAfter the death of William's father, most provinces had left the office of stadtholder vacant. At the demand of Oliver Cromwell, the Treaty of Westminster, which ended the First Anglo-Dutch War, had a secret annexe that required the Act of Seclusion, which forbade the province of Holland from appointing a member of the House of Orange as stadtholder. After the English Restoration, the Act of Seclusion, which had not remained a secret for very long, was declared void as the English Commonwealth (with which the treaty had been concluded) no longer existed. In 1660, Mary and Amalia tried to persuade several provincial States to designate William as their future stadtholder, but they all initially refused.\n\nIn 1667, as William III approached the age of 18, the Orangist party again attempted to bring him to power by securing for him the offices of stadtholder and Captain-General. To prevent the restoration of the influence of the House of Orange, De Witt, the leader of the States Party, allowed the pensionary of Haarlem, Gaspar Fagel, to induce the States of Holland to issue the Perpetual Edict. The Edict declared that the Captain-General or Admiral-General of the Netherlands could not serve as stadtholder in any province. Even so, William's supporters sought ways to enhance his prestige and, on 19 September 1668, the States of Zeeland appointed him as \"First Noble\". To receive this honour, William had to escape the attention of his state tutors and travel secretly to Middelburg. A month later, Amalia allowed William to manage his own household and declared him to be of majority age.\n\nThe province of Holland, the centre of anti-Orangism, abolished the office of stadtholder and four other provinces followed suit in March 1670, establishing the so-called \"Harmony\". De Witt demanded an oath from each Holland regent (city council member) to uphold the Edict; all but one complied. William saw all this as a defeat, but the arrangement was a compromise: De Witt would have preferred to ignore the prince completely, but now his eventual rise to the office of supreme army commander was implicit. De Witt further conceded that William would be admitted as a member of the \"Raad van State\", the Council of State, then the generality organ administering the defence budget. William was introduced to the council on 31 May 1670 with full voting rights, despite De Witt's attempts to limit his role to that of an advisor.\n\nIn November 1670, William obtained permission to travel to England to urge Charles to pay back at least a part of the 2,797,859 guilder debt the House of Stuart owed the House of Orange. Charles was unable to pay, but William agreed to reduce the amount owed to 1,800,000 guilders. Charles found his nephew to be a dedicated Calvinist and patriotic Dutchman, and reconsidered his desire to show him the Secret Treaty of Dover with France, directed at destroying the Dutch Republic and installing William as \"sovereign\" of a Dutch rump state. In addition to differing political outlooks, William found that his lifestyle differed from his uncles, Charles and James, who were more concerned with drinking, gambling, and cavorting with mistresses.\n\nThe following year, the Republic's security deteriorated quickly as an Anglo-French attack became imminent. In view of the threat, the States of Gelderland wanted William to be appointed Captain-General of the Dutch States Army as soon as possible, despite his youth and inexperience. On 15 December 1671, the States of Utrecht made this their official policy. On 19 January 1672, the States of Holland made a counterproposal: to appoint William for just a single campaign. The prince refused this and on 25 February a compromise was reached: an appointment by the States General for one summer, followed by a permanent appointment on his 22nd birthday.\n\nMeanwhile, William had written a secret letter to Charles in January 1672 asking his uncle to exploit the situation by exerting pressure on the States to appoint William stadtholder. In return, William would ally the Republic with England and serve Charles's interests as much as his \"honour and the loyalty due to this state\" allowed. Charles took no action on the proposal, and continued his war plans with his French ally.\n\nFor the Dutch Republic, 1672 proved calamitous. It became known as the \"Rampjaar\" (\"disaster year\"), because in the Franco-Dutch War and the Third Anglo-Dutch War the Netherlands was invaded by France and its allies: England, Münster, and Cologne. Although the Anglo-French fleet was disabled by the Battle of Solebay, in June the French army quickly overran the provinces of Gelderland and Utrecht. On 14 June, William withdrew with the remnants of his field army into Holland, where the States had ordered the flooding of the Dutch Water Line on 8 June. Louis XIV of France, believing the war was over, began negotiations to extract as large a sum of money from the Dutch as possible. The presence of a large French army in the heart of the Republic caused a general panic, and the people turned against De Witt and his allies.\n\nOn 4 July, the States of Holland appointed William stadtholder, and he took the oath five days later. The next day, a special envoy from Charles II, Lord Arlington, met with William in Nieuwerbrug and presented a proposal from Charles. In return for William's capitulation to England and France, Charles would make William Sovereign Prince of Holland, instead of stadtholder (a mere civil servant). When William refused, Arlington threatened that William would witness the end of the Republic's existence. William answered famously: \"There is one way to avoid this: to die defending it in the last ditch.\" On 7 July, the inundations were complete and the further advance of the French army was effectively blocked. On 16 July, Zeeland offered the stadtholderate to William.\n\nJohan de Witt had been unable to function as Grand Pensionary after being wounded by an attempt on his life on 21 June. On 15 August, William published a letter from Charles, in which the English king stated that he had made war because of the aggression of the De Witt faction. The people thus incited, De Witt and his brother, Cornelis, were brutally murdered by an Orangist civil militia in The Hague on 20 August. Subsequently, William replaced many of the Dutch regents with his followers.\n\nThough William's complicity in the lynching has never been proved (and some 19th-century Dutch historians have made an effort to disprove that he was an accessory) he thwarted attempts to prosecute the ringleaders, and even rewarded some, like Hendrik Verhoeff, with money, and others, like Johan van Banchem and Johan Kievit, with high offices. This damaged his reputation in the same fashion as his later actions at Glencoe.\n\nWilliam continued to fight against the invaders from England and France, allying himself with Spain and Brandenburg. In November 1672, he took his army to Maastricht to threaten the French supply lines. By 1673, the Dutch situation further improved. Although Louis took Maastricht and William's attack against Charleroi failed, Lieutenant-Admiral Michiel de Ruyter defeated the Anglo-French fleet three times, forcing Charles to end England's involvement by the Treaty of Westminster; after 1673, France slowly withdrew from Dutch territory (with the exception of Maastricht), while making gains elsewhere.\n\nFagel now proposed to treat the liberated provinces of Utrecht, Gelderland and Overijssel as conquered territory (Generality Lands), as punishment for their quick surrender to the enemy. William refused but obtained a special mandate from the States General to appoint all delegates in the States of these provinces anew. William's followers in the States of Utrecht on 26 April 1674 appointed him hereditary stadtholder. On 30 January 1675, the States of Gelderland offered him the titles of Duke of Guelders and Count of Zutphen. The negative reactions to this from Zeeland and the city of Amsterdam made William ultimately decide to decline these honours; he was instead appointed stadtholder of Gelderland and Overijssel.\n\nDuring the war with France, William tried to improve his position by marrying, in 1677, his first cousin Mary, elder surviving daughter of the Duke of York, later King James II of England (James VII of Scotland). Mary was eleven years his junior and he anticipated resistance to a Stuart match from the Amsterdam merchants who had disliked his mother (another Mary Stuart), but William believed that marrying Mary would increase his chances of succeeding to Charles's kingdoms, and would draw England's monarch away from his pro-French policies. James was not inclined to consent, but Charles II pressured his brother to agree. Charles wanted to use the possibility of marriage to gain leverage in negotiations relating to the war, but William insisted that the two issues be decided separately. Charles relented, and Bishop Henry Compton married the couple on 4 November 1677. Mary became pregnant soon after the marriage, but miscarried. After a further illness later in 1678, she never conceived again.\n\nThroughout William and Mary's marriage, William had only one reputed mistress, Elizabeth Villiers, in contrast to the many mistresses his uncles openly kept.\n\nBy 1678, Louis sought peace with the Dutch Republic. Even so, tensions remained: William remained very suspicious of Louis, thinking that the French king desired \"Universal Kingship\" over Europe; Louis described William as \"my mortal enemy\" and saw him as an obnoxious warmonger. France's annexations in the Southern Netherlands and Germany (the \"Réunion\" policy) and the revocation of the Edict of Nantes in 1685, caused a surge of Huguenot refugees to the Republic. This led William III to join various anti-French alliances, such as the Association League, and ultimately the League of Augsburg (an anti-French coalition that also included the Holy Roman Empire, Sweden, Spain and several German states) in 1686.\n\nAfter his marriage in November 1677, William became a strong candidate for the English throne should his father-in-law (and uncle) James be excluded because of his Catholicism. During the crisis concerning the Exclusion Bill in 1680, Charles at first invited William to come to England to bolster the king's position against the exclusionists, then withdrew his invitation—after which Lord Sunderland also tried unsuccessfully to bring William over, but now to put pressure on Charles. Nevertheless, William secretly induced the States General to send Charles the \"Insinuation\", a plea beseeching the king to prevent any Catholics from succeeding him, without explicitly naming James. After receiving indignant reactions from Charles and James, William denied any involvement.\n\nIn 1685, when James II succeeded Charles, William at first attempted a conciliatory approach, at the same time trying not to offend the Protestants in England. William, ever looking for ways to diminish the power of France, hoped that James would join the League of Augsburg, but by 1687 it became clear that James would not join the anti-French alliance. Relations worsened between William and James thereafter. In November, James's second wife, Mary of Modena, was announced to be pregnant. That month, to gain the favour of English Protestants, William wrote an open letter to the English people in which he disapproved of James's pro-Roman Catholic policy of religious toleration. Seeing him as a friend, and often having maintained secret contacts with him for years, many English politicians began to urge an armed invasion of England.\n\nWilliam at first opposed the prospect of invasion, but most historians now agree that he began to assemble an expeditionary force in April 1688, as it became increasingly clear that France would remain occupied by campaigns in Germany and Italy, and thus unable to mount an attack while William's troops would be occupied in Britain. Believing that the English people would not react well to a foreign invader, he demanded in a letter to Rear-Admiral Arthur Herbert that the most eminent English Protestants first invite him to invade. In June, Mary of Modena, after a string of miscarriages, bore a son, James Francis Edward Stuart, who displaced William's Protestant wife to become first in the line of succession and raised the prospect of an ongoing Catholic monarchy. Public anger also increased because of the trial of seven bishops who had publicly opposed James's Declaration of Indulgence granting religious liberty to his subjects, a policy which appeared to threaten the establishment of the Anglican Church.\n\nOn 30 June 1688—the same day the bishops were acquitted—a group of political figures, known afterward as the \"Immortal Seven\", sent William a formal invitation. William's intentions to invade were public knowledge by September 1688. With a Dutch army, William landed at Brixham in southwest England on 5 November 1688. He came ashore from the ship \"Brill\", proclaiming \"the liberties of England and the Protestant religion I will maintain\". William's fleet was vastly larger than the Spanish Armada 100 years earlier: approximately 250 carrier ships and 60 fishing boats carried 35,000 men, including 11,000-foot and 4,000 horse soldiers. James's support began to dissolve almost immediately upon William's arrival; Protestant officers defected from the English army (the most notable of whom was Lord Churchill of Eyemouth, James's most able commander), and influential noblemen across the country declared their support for the invader.\n\nJames at first attempted to resist William, but saw that his efforts would prove futile. He sent representatives to negotiate with William, but secretly attempted to flee on 11/21 December, throwing the Great Seal into the Thames on his way. He was discovered and brought back to London by a group of fishermen. He was allowed to escape to France in a second attempt on 23 December. William permitted James to leave the country, not wanting to make him a martyr for the Roman Catholic cause; it was in his interests for James to be perceived as having left the country of his own accord, rather than having been forced or frightened into fleeing. William is the last person to successfully invade England by force of arms.\n\nWilliam summoned a Convention Parliament in England, which met on 22 January 1689, to discuss the appropriate course of action following James's flight. William felt insecure about his position; though his wife preceded him in the line of succession to the throne, he wished to reign as king in his own right, rather than as a mere consort. The only precedent for a joint monarchy in England dated from the 16th century, when Queen Mary I married Philip of Spain. Philip remained king only during his wife's lifetime, and restrictions were placed on his power. William, on the other hand, demanded that he remain as king even after his wife's death. When the majority of Tory Lords proposed to acclaim her as sole ruler, William threatened to leave the country immediately. Furthermore, Mary, remaining loyal to her husband, refused.\n\nThe House of Commons, with a Whig majority, quickly resolved that the throne was vacant, and that it was safer if the ruler were Protestant. There were more Tories in the House of Lords, which would not initially agree, but after William refused to be a regent or to agree to remain king only in his wife's lifetime, there were negotiations between the two houses and the Lords agreed by a narrow majority that the throne was vacant. The Commons made William accept a Bill of Rights, and, on 13 February 1689, Parliament passed the Declaration of Right, in which it deemed that James, by attempting to flee, had abdicated the government of the realm, thereby leaving the throne vacant.\n\nThe Crown was not offered to James's infant son, who would have been the heir apparent under normal circumstances, but to William and Mary as joint sovereigns. It was, however, provided that \"the sole and full exercise of the regal power be only in and executed by the said Prince of Orange in the names of the said Prince and Princess during their joint lives\".\n\nWilliam and Mary were crowned together at Westminster Abbey on 11 April 1689 by the Bishop of London, Henry Compton. Normally, the coronation is performed by the Archbishop of Canterbury, but the Archbishop at the time, William Sancroft, refused to recognise James's removal.\n\nWilliam also summoned a Convention of the Estates of Scotland, which met on 14 March 1689 and sent a conciliatory letter, while James sent haughty uncompromising orders, swaying a majority in favour of William. On 11 April, the day of the English coronation, the Convention finally declared that James was no longer King of Scotland. William and Mary were offered the Scottish Crown; they accepted on 11 May.\n\nWilliam encouraged the passage of the Toleration Act 1689, which guaranteed religious toleration to Protestant nonconformists. It did not, however, extend toleration as far as he wished, still restricting the religious liberty of Roman Catholics, non-trinitarians, and those of non-Christian faiths. In December 1689, one of the most important constitutional documents in English history, the Bill of Rights, was passed. The Act, which restated and confirmed many provisions of the earlier Declaration of Right, established restrictions on the royal prerogative. It provided, amongst other things, that the Sovereign could not suspend laws passed by Parliament, levy taxes without parliamentary consent, infringe the right to petition, raise a standing army during peacetime without parliamentary consent, deny the right to bear arms to Protestant subjects, unduly interfere with parliamentary elections, punish members of either House of Parliament for anything said during debates, require excessive bail or inflict cruel and unusual punishments. William was opposed to the imposition of such constraints, but he chose not to engage in a conflict with Parliament and agreed to abide by the statute.\n\nThe Bill of Rights also settled the question of succession to the Crown. After the death of either William or Mary, the other would continue to reign. Next in the line of succession was Mary II's sister, Anne, and her issue, followed by any children William might have had by a subsequent marriage. Roman Catholics, as well as those who married Catholics, were excluded.\n\nAlthough most in Britain accepted William and Mary as sovereigns, a significant minority refused to acknowledge their claim to the throne, instead believing in the divine right of kings, which held that the monarch's authority derived directly from God rather than being delegated to the monarch by Parliament. Over the next 57 years Jacobites pressed for restoration of James and his heirs. Nonjurors in England and Scotland, including over 400 clergy and several bishops of the Church of England and Scottish Episcopal Church as well as numerous laymen, refused to take oaths of allegiance to William.\n\nIreland was controlled by Roman Catholics loyal to James, and Franco-Irish Jacobites arrived from France with French forces in March 1689 to join the war in Ireland and contest Protestant resistance at the Siege of Derry. William sent his navy to the city in July, and his army landed in August. After progress stalled, William personally intervened to lead his armies to victory over James at the Battle of the Boyne on 1 July 1690, after which James fled back to France.\n\nUpon William's return to England, his close friend Dutch General Godert de Ginkell, who had accompanied William to Ireland and had commanded a body of Dutch cavalry at the Battle of the Boyne, was named Commander in Chief of William's forces in Ireland and entrusted with further conduct of the war there. Ginkell took command in Ireland in the spring of 1691, and following several ensuing battles, succeeded in capturing both Galway and Limerick, thereby effectively suppressing the Jacobite forces in Ireland within a few more months. After difficult negotiations a capitulation was signed on 3 October 1691—the Treaty of Limerick. Thus concluded the Williamite pacification of Ireland, and for his services the Dutch general received the formal thanks of the House of Commons, and was awarded the title of Earl of Athlone by the king.\n\nA series of Jacobite risings also took place in Scotland, where Viscount Dundee raised Highland forces and won a victory on 27 July 1689 at the Battle of Killiecrankie, but he died in the fight and a month later Scottish Cameronian forces subdued the rising at the Battle of Dunkeld. William offered Scottish clans that had taken part in the rising a pardon provided that they signed allegiance by a deadline, and his government in Scotland punished a delay with the Massacre of Glencoe of 1692, which became infamous in Jacobite propaganda as William had countersigned the orders. Bowing to public opinion, William dismissed those responsible for the massacre, though they still remained in his favour; in the words of the historian John Dalberg-Acton, \"one became a colonel, another a knight, a third a peer, and a fourth an earl.\"\n\nWilliam's reputation in Scotland suffered further damage when he refused English assistance to the Darien scheme, a Scottish colony (1698–1700) that failed disastrously.\n\nAlthough the Whigs were William's strongest supporters, he initially favoured a policy of balance between the Whigs and Tories. The Marquess of Halifax, a man known for his ability to chart a moderate political course, gained William's confidence early in his reign. The Whigs, a majority in Parliament, had expected to dominate the government, and were disappointed that William denied them this chance. This \"balanced\" approach to governance did not last beyond 1690, as the conflicting factions made it impossible for the government to pursue effective policy, and William called for new elections early that year.\n\nAfter the Parliamentary elections of 1690, William began to favour the Tories, led by Danby and Nottingham. While the Tories favoured preserving the king's prerogatives, William found them unaccommodating when he asked Parliament to support his continuing war with France. As a result, William began to prefer the Whig faction known as the Junto. The Whig government was responsible for the creation of the Bank of England following the example of the Bank of Amsterdam. William's decision to grant the Royal Charter in 1694 to the Bank of England, a private institution owned by bankers, is his most relevant economic legacy. It laid the financial foundation of the English take-over of the central role of the Dutch Republic and Bank of Amsterdam in global commerce in the 18th century.\n\nWilliam dissolved Parliament in 1695, and the new Parliament that assembled that year was led by the Whigs. There was a considerable surge in support for William following the exposure of a Jacobite plan to assassinate him in 1696. Parliament passed a bill of attainder against the ringleader, John Fenwick, and he was beheaded in 1697.\n\nWilliam continued to absent himself from Britain for extended periods during his Nine Years' War (1688–1697) against France, leaving each spring and returning to England each autumn. England joined the League of Augsburg, which then became known as the Grand Alliance. Whilst William was away fighting, his wife, Mary II, governed the realm, but acted on his advice. Each time he returned to England, Mary gave up her power to him without reservation, an arrangement that lasted for the rest of Mary's life.\n\nAfter the Anglo-Dutch fleet defeated a French fleet at La Hogue in 1692, the allies for a short period controlled the seas, and the Treaty of Limerick (1691) pacified Ireland. At the same time, the Grand Alliance fared poorly in Europe, as William lost Namur in the Spanish Netherlands in 1692, and the French under the command of the Duke of Luxembourg beat him badly at the Battle of Landen in 1693.\n\nMary II died of smallpox on 28 December 1694, leaving William III to rule alone. William deeply mourned his wife's death. Despite his conversion to Anglicanism, William's popularity plummeted during his reign as a sole monarch.\n\nDuring the 1690s, rumours grew of William's alleged homosexual inclinations and led to the publication of many satirical pamphlets by his Jacobite detractors. He did have several close male associates, including two Dutch courtiers to whom he granted English titles: Hans Willem Bentinck became Earl of Portland, and Arnold Joost van Keppel was created Earl of Albemarle. These relationships with male friends, and his apparent lack of mistresses, led William's enemies to suggest that he might prefer homosexual relationships. William's modern biographers disagree on the veracity of these allegations. Some believe there may have been truth to the rumours, while others affirm that they were no more than figments of his enemies' imaginations, and that there was nothing unusual in someone childless like William adopting or evincing paternal affections for a younger man.\n\nWhatever the case, Bentinck's closeness to William did arouse jealousies in the Royal Court. William's young protegé, Keppel, aroused more gossip and suspicion, being 20 years William's junior, strikingly handsome, and having risen from being a royal page to an earldom with some ease. Portland wrote to William in 1697 that \"the kindness which your Majesty has for a young man, and the way in which you seem to authorise his liberties ... make the world say things I am ashamed to hear.\" This, he said, was \"tarnishing a reputation which has never before been subject to such accusations\". William tersely dismissed these suggestions, however, saying, \"It seems to me very extraordinary that it should be impossible to have esteem and regard for a young man without it being criminal.\"\n\nIn 1696, the Dutch territory of Drenthe made William its Stadtholder. In the same year, Jacobites plotted to assassinate William III in an attempt to restore James to the English throne, but failed. In accordance with the Treaty of Rijswijk (20 September 1697), which ended the Nine Years' War, Louis recognised William III as King of England, and undertook to give no further assistance to James II. Thus deprived of French dynastic backing after 1697, Jacobites posed no further serious threats during William's reign.\n\nAs his life drew towards its conclusion, William, like many other European rulers, felt concern over the question of succession to the throne of Spain, which brought with it vast territories in Italy, the Low Countries and the New World. The King of Spain, Charles II, was an invalid with no prospect of having children; amongst his closest relatives were Louis XIV (the King of France) and Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor. William sought to prevent the Spanish inheritance from going to either monarch, for he feared that such a calamity would upset the balance of power. William and Louis XIV agreed to the First Partition Treaty, which provided for the division of the Spanish Empire: Joseph Ferdinand, Electoral Prince of Bavaria, would obtain Spain, while France and the Holy Roman Emperor would divide the remaining territories between them. Charles II accepted the nomination of Joseph Ferdinand as his heir, and war appeared to be averted.\n\nWhen, however, Joseph Ferdinand died of smallpox, the issue re-opened. In 1700, the two rulers agreed to the Second Partition Treaty (also called the Treaty of London), under which the territories in Italy would pass to a son of the King of France, and the other Spanish territories would be inherited by a son of the Holy Roman Emperor. This arrangement infuriated both the Spanish, who still sought to prevent the dissolution of their empire, and the Holy Roman Emperor, to whom the Italian territories were much more useful than the other lands. Unexpectedly, the invalid King of Spain, Charles II, interfered as he lay dying in late 1700. Unilaterally, he willed all Spanish territories to Philip, a grandson of Louis XIV. The French conveniently ignored the Second Partition Treaty and claimed the entire Spanish inheritance. Furthermore, Louis XIV alienated William III by recognising James Francis Edward Stuart, the son of the former King James II who had died in 1701, as \"de jure\" King of England. The subsequent conflict, known as the War of the Spanish Succession, continued until 1713.\n\nThe Spanish inheritance was not the only one that concerned William. His marriage with Mary had not yielded any children, and he did not seem likely to remarry. Mary's sister, Anne, had borne numerous children, all of whom died during childhood. The death of her last surviving child, Prince William, Duke of Gloucester, in 1700 left her as the only individual in the line of succession established by the Bill of Rights. As the complete exhaustion of the line of succession would have encouraged a restoration of James II's line, Parliament passed the Act of Settlement 1701, which provided that if Anne died without surviving issue and William failed to have surviving issue by any subsequent marriage, the Crown would be inherited by a distant relative, Sophia, Electress of Hanover, a granddaughter of James I, and her Protestant heirs. The Act debarred Roman Catholics from the throne, thereby excluding the candidacy of several dozen people more closely related to Mary and Anne than Sophia. The Act extended to England and Ireland, but not to Scotland, whose Estates had not been consulted before the selection of Sophia.\n\nIn 1702, William died of pneumonia, a complication from a broken collarbone following a fall from his horse, Sorrel. The horse had been confiscated from Sir John Fenwick, one of the Jacobites who had conspired against William. Because his horse had stumbled into a mole's burrow, many Jacobites toasted \"the little gentleman in the black velvet waistcoat\". Years later, Winston Churchill, in his \"A History of the English-Speaking Peoples\", stated that the fall \"opened the door to a troop of lurking foes\". William was buried in Westminster Abbey alongside his wife. His sister-in-law, Anne, became queen regnant of England, Scotland and Ireland.\n\nWilliam's death brought an end to the Dutch House of Orange, members of which had served as stadtholder of Holland and the majority of the other provinces of the Dutch Republic since the time of William the Silent (William I). The five provinces of which William III was stadtholder—Holland, Zeeland, Utrecht, Gelderland, and Overijssel—all suspended the office after his death. Thus, he was the last patrilineal descendant of William I to be named stadtholder for the majority of the provinces. Under William III's will, John William Friso stood to inherit the Principality of Orange as well as several lordships in the Netherlands. He was William's closest agnatic relative, as well as son of William's aunt Albertine Agnes. However, King Frederick I of Prussia also claimed the Principality as the senior cognatic heir, his mother Louise Henriette being Albertine Agnes's older sister. Under the Treaty of Utrecht (1713), Frederick I's successor, Frederick William I of Prussia, ceded his territorial claim to King Louis XIV of France, keeping only a claim to the title. Friso's posthumous son, William IV, succeeded to the title at his birth in 1711; in the Treaty of Partition (1732) he agreed to share the title \"Prince of Orange\" with Frederick William.\n\nWilliam's primary achievement was to contain France when it was in a position to impose its will across much of Europe. His life's aim was largely to oppose Louis XIV of France. This effort continued after his death during the War of the Spanish Succession. Another important consequence of William's reign in England involved the ending of a bitter conflict between Crown and Parliament that had lasted since the accession of the first English monarch of the House of Stuart, James I, in 1603. The conflict over royal and parliamentary power had led to the English Civil War during the 1640s and the Glorious Revolution of 1688. During William's reign, however, the conflict was settled in Parliament's favour by the Bill of Rights 1689, the Triennial Act 1694 and the Act of Settlement 1701.\n\nWilliam endowed the College of William and Mary (in present-day Williamsburg, Virginia) in 1693. Nassau, the capital of The Bahamas, is named after Fort Nassau, which was renamed in 1695 in his honour. Similarly Nassau County, New York, a county on Long Island, is a namesake. Long Island itself was also known as Nassau during early Dutch rule. Though many alumni of Princeton University think that the town of Princeton, New Jersey (and hence the university) were named in his honour, this is probably untrue. Nassau Hall, at the university campus, is so named, however.\n\nNew York City was briefly renamed New Orange for him in 1673 after the Dutch recaptured the city, which had been renamed New York by the British in 1665. His name was applied to the fort and administrative centre for the city on two separate occasions reflecting his different sovereign status—first as Fort Willem Hendrick in 1673, and then as Fort William in 1691 when the English evicted Colonists who had seized the fort and city.\n\nThe modern day Orange Order is named after William III, and makes a point of celebrating his victory at the Battle of the Boyne with annual parades in Northern Ireland, Liverpool and parts of Scotland and Canada on 12 July.\n\n\nBy 1674, William was fully styled as \"Willem III, by God's grace Prince of Orange, Count of Nassau etc., Stadtholder of Holland, Zeeland, Utrecht etc., Captain- and Admiral-General of the United Netherlands\". After their accession in Great Britain in 1689, William and Mary used the titles \"King and Queen of England, Scotland, France and Ireland, Defenders of the Faith, etc.\"\n\nAs Prince of Orange, William's coat of arms was: Quarterly, I Azure billetty a lion rampant Or (for Nassau); II Or a lion rampant guardant Gules crowned Azure (Katzenelnbogen); III Gules a fess Argent (Vianden), IV Gules two lions passant guardant Or, armed and langued azure (Dietz); between the I and II quarters an inescutcheon, Or a fess Sable (Moers); at the fess point an inescutcheon, quarterly I and IV Gules, a bend Or (Châlons); II and III Or a bugle horn Azure, stringed Gules (Orange) with an inescutcheon, Nine pieces Or and Azure (Geneva); between the III and IV quarters, an inescutcheon, Gules a fess counter embattled Argent (Buren).\n\nThe coat of arms used by the king and queen was: Quarterly, I and IV Grand quarterly, Azure three fleurs-de-lis Or (for France) and Gules three lions passant guardant in pale Or (for England); II Or a lion rampant within a double tressure flory-counter-flory Gules (for Scotland); III Azure a harp Or stringed Argent (for Ireland); overall an escutcheon Azure billetty a lion rampant Or. In his later coat of arms, William used the motto: \"Je Maintiendrai\" (medieval French for \"I will maintain\"). The motto represents the House of Orange-Nassau, since it came into the family with the Principality of Orange.\n\n\n"}

In order to provide for his rations and transportation, he was eventually enlisted officially as a soldier with the rank of private, and was subsequently promoted to corporal.\n\nHe accompanied the bulk of the Polish Second Corps to Italy, serving with the 22nd Artillery Supply Company. During the Battle of Monte Cassino, in Italy in 1944, Wojtek helped move crates of ammunition and became a celebrity with visiting Allied generals and statesmen.\n\nAfter the war, mustered out of the Polish Army, he was billeted and lived out the rest of his life at the Edinburgh Zoo in Scotland.\n\nIn the spring of 1942 the newly formed Anders Army left the Soviet Union for Iran, accompanied by thousands of Polish civilians who had been deported to the gulags following the Soviet invasion of Poland in 1939. During a rest stop near the town of Hamadan while en route to Tehran on 8 April 1942, a group of Polish soldiers encountered a young Kurdish boy who had found a bear cub after its mother had been shot by hunters. One of the civilian refugees in their midst, eighteen-year-old Irena Bokiewicz, was very taken with the cub, which prompted Lieutenant Anatol Tarnowiecki to buy the young bear, who spent the next three months in the Polish refugee camp that was established near Tehran, principally under the care of Irena. In August the bear was donated to the 2nd Transport Company, which later became the 22nd Artillery Supply Company, and he was given the name Wojtek by the soldiers.\n\nWojtek initially had problems swallowing and was fed condensed milk from an old vodka bottle. He was subsequently given fruit, marmalade, honey and syrup, and was often rewarded with beer, which became his favourite drink. He later also enjoyed smoking (or eating) cigarettes. He loved wrestling with the soldiers and was taught to salute when greeted. Wojtek became quite an attraction for soldiers and civilians alike, and soon became an unofficial mascot of all units stationed nearby. With the 22nd Company he moved to Iraq and then through Syria, Palestine and Egypt.\n\nThe name \"Wojtek\" is the nickname, diminutive form, or hypocorism of \"Wojciech\" (Happy Warrior), an old Slavic name that is still common in Poland.\n\nTo get him onto a British transport ship when the unit sailed with the rest of the Polish II Corps from Egypt to fight alongside the British 8th Army in the Italian campaign, because regulations forbade mascot and pet animals, Wojtek was officially drafted into the Polish Army as a private and was listed among the soldiers of the 22nd Artillery Supply Company. Henryk Zacharewicz and Dymitr Szawlugo were assigned as his caretakers.\n\nAs an enlisted soldier of the company, with his own paybook, rank and serial number, he lived with the other men in tents or in a special wooden crate, which was transported by truck. According to numerous accounts, during the Battle of Monte Cassino Wojtek helped by carrying 100-pound crates of 25-pound artillery shells, all without dropping a single one. In recognition of the bear's popularity, the HQ approved a depiction of a bear carrying an artillery shell as the official emblem of the 22nd Company.\n\nAfter World War II, in 1945, Wojtek was transported to Berwickshire, Scotland, with the rest of the 22nd Company. They were stationed at Winfield Airfield on Sunwick Farm, near the village of Hutton, Scottish Borders. Wojtek soon became popular among local civilians and the press, and the Polish-Scottish Association made him an honorary member.\n\nFollowing demobilisation on 15 November 1947, Wojtek was given to the Edinburgh Zoo, where he spent the rest of his life, often visited by journalists and former Polish soldiers, some of whom would toss him cigarettes, which he proceeded to eat because there was no one there to light them for him.\n\nMedia attention contributed to Wojtek's popularity. He was a frequent guest on BBC television's \"Blue Peter\" programme for children.\n\nWojtek died in December 1963, at the age of 21. At the time of his death he weighed nearly , or 490 pounds, and was over 1.8 metres (6 feet) tall.\n\nThe many memorials to the soldier-bear include a plaque in the Imperial War Museum, in London; a sculpture by David Harding in the Sikorski Museum, in London; and a wooden sculpture in Weelsby Woods, Grimsby.\n\nOn 25 April 2013, the Kraków city council decided to erect a statue of Wojtek in the city's Jordan Park. It was unveiled on 18 May 2014, the 70th anniversary of the Battle of Monte Cassino.\nOn 16 September 2013, the City of Edinburgh Council approved the erection of a bronze statue of Wojtek, by Alan Beattie Herriot, to stand in the city's West Princes Street Gardens. Unveiled on 7 November 2015, it presents Wojtek and a fellow Polish Army soldier walking together. A 4-metre (five-foot-long) relief documents Wojtek's journey from Egypt to Scotland with the Polish Army.\n\nOn 30 December 2011, a film, \"Wojtek: The Bear That Went to War\", was broadcast on BBC Two Scotland, narrated by Brian Blessed.\n\nBritish songwriter Katy Carr released a music video called 'Wojtek,' on 17 September 2014 – the 75th anniversary of the Soviet invasion of Poland.\n\nHe is referenced in \"Hearts of Iron IV\", as an Easter egg achievement, 'Bearer of Artillery'.\n\nIn the Scythe board game, a fictionalized Poland known as \"Polania Republic\" is represented with the characters \"Anna & Wojtek\", where Wojtek is Anna's bear companion.\n\nIn the anime series \"Girls und Panzer\", the emblem of the Poland-inspired school, Bonple, features a bear carrying an artillery shell, as a reference to the emblem of the 22nd Artillery Supply Company and Wojtek. In the 2015 feature film to the series, the name \"Wojtek\" is also used for a teddy-shaped amusement park vehicle and later museum exhibit for the in-series \"Boko\" franchise.\n\nIn the online digital collectible card game \"\", Wojtek is named in an audible voice line in reference to a bear summoned by a unit card of the Skellige starter deck.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "779111", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=779111", "title": "Xenotransplantation", "text": "Xenotransplantation\n\nXenotransplantation (\"xenos-\" from the Greek meaning \"foreign\" or strange), or heterologous transplant is the transplantation of living cells, tissues or organs from one species to another. Such cells, tissues or organs are called xenografts or xenotransplants. It is contrasted with allotransplantation (from other individual of same species), syngeneic transplantation or isotransplantation (grafts transplanted between two genetically identical individuals of the same species) and autotransplantation (from one part of the body to another in the same person).\n\nXenotransplantation of human tumor cells into immunocompromised mice is a research technique frequently used in pre-clinical oncology research.\n\nHuman xenotransplantation offers a potential treatment for end-stage organ failure, a significant health problem in parts of the industrialized world. It also raises many novel medical, legal and ethical issues. A continuing concern is that many animals, such as pigs, have a shorter lifespan than humans, meaning that their tissues age at a quicker rate. Disease transmission (xenozoonosis) and permanent alteration to the genetic code of animals are also causes for concern. Similarly to objections to animal testing, animal rights activists have also objected to xenotransplantation on ethical grounds. A few temporarily successful cases of xenotransplantation are published.\n\nIt is common for patients and physicians to use the term \"allograft\" imprecisely to refer to either allograft (human-to-human) or xenograft (animal-to-human), but it is helpful scientifically (for those searching or reading the scientific literature) to maintain the more precise distinction in usage.\n\nThe first serious attempts at xenotransplantation (then called heterotransplantation) appeared in the scientific literature in 1905, when slices of rabbit kidney were transplanted into a child with renal insufficiency. In the first two decades of the 20th century, several subsequent efforts attempts to use organs from lambs, pigs and primates were published.\n\nScientific interest in xenotransplantation declined when the immunological basis of the organ rejection process was described. The next waves of studies on the topic came with the discovery of immunosuppressive drugs. Even more studies followed Dr. Joseph Murray's first successful renal transplantation in 1954 and scientists, facing the ethical questions of organ donation for the first time, accelerated their effort in looking for alternatives to human organs.\n\nIn 1963, doctors at Tulane University attempted chimpanzee-to-human renal transplantations in six people who were near death; after this and several subsequent unsuccessful attempts to use primates as organ donors and the development of a working cadaver organ procuring program, interest in xenotransplantation for kidney failure dissipated.\n\nAn American infant girl known as \"Baby Fae\" with hypoplastic left heart syndrome was the first infant recipient of a xenotransplantation, when she received a baboon heart in 1983. The procedure was performed by Leonard L. Bailey at Loma Linda University Medical Center in Loma Linda, California. Fae died 21 days later due to a humoral-based graft rejection thought to be caused mainly by an ABO blood type mismatch, considered unavoidable due to the rarity of type O baboons. The graft was meant to be temporary, but unfortunately a suitable allograft replacement could not be found in time. While the procedure itself did not advance the progress on xenotransplantation, it did shed a light on the insufficient amount of organs for infants. The story grew so big that it made such an impact that the crisis of infant organ shortage improved for that time. \n\nXenotransplantation of human tumor cells into immunocompromised mice is a research technique frequently used in oncology research. It is used to predict the sensitivity of the transplanted tumor to various cancer treatments; several companies offer this service, including the Jackson Laboratory.\n\nHuman organs have been transplanted into animals as a powerful research technique for studying human biology without harming human patients. This technique has also been proposed as an alternative source of human organs for future transplantation into human patients. For example, researchers from the Ganogen Research Institute transplanted human fetal kidneys into rats which demonstrated life supporting function and growth.\n\nA worldwide shortage of organs for clinical implantation causes about 20–35% of patients who need replacement organs to die on the waiting list. Certain procedures, some of which are being investigated in early clinical trials, aim to use cells or tissues from other species to treat life-threatening and debilitating illnesses such as cancer, diabetes, liver failure and Parkinson's disease. If vitrification can be perfected, it could allow for long-term storage of xenogenic cells, tissues and organs so that they would be more readily available for transplant.\n\nXenotransplants could save thousands of patients waiting for donated organs. The animal organ, probably from a pig or baboon could be genetically altered with human genes to trick a patient’s immune system into accepting it as a part of its own body. They have re-emerged because of the lack of organs available and the constant battle to keep immune systems from rejecting allotransplants. Xenotransplants are thus potentially a more effective alternative.\n\nXenotransplantation also is and has been a valuable tool used in research laboratories to study developmental biology.\n\nPatient derived tumor xenografts in animals can be used to test treatments.\n\nSince they are the closest relatives to humans, non-human primates were first considered as a potential organ source for xenotransplantation to humans. Chimpanzees were originally considered the best option since their organs are of similar size, and they have good blood type compatibility with humans, which makes them potential candidates for xenotransfusions. However, since chimpanzees are listed as an endangered species, other potential donors were sought. Baboons are more readily available, but impractical as potential donors. Problems include their smaller body size, the infrequency of blood group O (the universal donor), their long gestation period, and their typically small number of offspring. In addition, a major problem with the use of nonhuman primates is the increased risk of disease transmission, since they are so closely related to humans.\n\nPigs (\"Sus scrofa domesticus\") are currently thought to be the best candidates for organ donation. The risk of cross-species disease transmission is decreased because of their increased phylogenetic distance from humans. They are readily available, their organs are anatomically comparable in size, and new infectious agents are less likely since they have been in close contact with humans through domestication for many generations. Current experiments in xenotransplantation most often use pigs as the donor, and baboons as human models.\n\nIn the field of regenerative medicine, pancreatogenesis- or nephrogenesis-disabled pig embryos, unable to form a specific organ, allow experimentation toward the \"in vivo\" generation of functional organs from xenogenic pluripotent stem cells in large animals via compensation for an empty developmental niche (blastocyst complementation). Such experiments provide the basis for potential future application of blastocyst complementation to generate transplantable human organs from the patient's own cells, using livestock animals, to increase quality of life for those with end-stage organ failure.\n\nTo date no xenotransplantation trials have been entirely successful due to the many obstacles arising from the response of the recipient’s immune system. \"Xenozoonoses\" are one of the biggest threats to rejections, as they are xenogenetic infections. The introduction of these microorganisms are a big issue that lead ti the fatal infections and then rejection of the organs. This response, which is generally more extreme than in allotransplantations, ultimately results in rejection of the xenograft, and can in some cases result in the immediate death of the recipient. There are several types of rejection organ xenografts are faced with, these include: \n\nA rapid, violent, and hyperacute response comes as a result of antibodies present in the host organism. These antibodies are known as xenoreactive natural antibodies (XNAs).\n\nThis rapid and violent type of rejection occurs within minutes to hours from the time of the transplant. It is mediated by the binding of XNAs (xenoreactive natural antibodies) to the donor endothelium, causing activation of the human complement system, which results in endothelial damage, inflammation, thrombosis and necrosis of the transplant. XNAs are first produced and begin circulating in the blood in neonates, after colonization of the bowel by bacteria with galactose moieties on their cell walls. Most of these antibodies are the IgM class, but also include IgG, and IgA.\n\nThe epitope XNAs target is an α-linked galactose moiety, Gal-α-1,3Gal (also called the α-Gal epitope), produced by the enzyme α-galactosyl transferase. Most non-primates contain this enzyme thus, this epitope is present on the organ epithelium and is perceived as a foreign antigen by primates, which lack the galactosyl transferase enzyme. In pig to primate xenotransplantation, XNAs recognize porcine glycoproteins of the integrin family.\n\nThe binding of XNAs initiate complement activation through the classical complement pathway. Complement activation causes a cascade of events leading to: destruction of endothelial cells, platelet degranulation, inflammation, coagulation, fibrin deposition, and hemorrhage. The end result is thrombosis and necrosis of the xenograft.\n\nSince hyperacute rejection presents such a barrier to the success of xenografts, several strategies to overcome it are under investigation:\n\n\"Interruption of the complement cascade\" \n\n\"Transgenic organs (Genetically engineered pigs)\" \n\nAlso known as delayed xenoactive rejection, this type of rejection occurs in discordant xenografts within 2 to 3 days, if hyperacute rejection is prevented. The process is much more complex than hyperacute rejection and is currently not completely understood. Acute vascular rejection requires de novo protein synthesis and is driven by interactions between the graft endothelial cells and host antibodies, macrophages, and platelets. The response is characterized by an inflammatory infiltrate of mostly macrophages and natural killer cells (with small numbers of T cells), intravascular thrombosis, and fibrinoid necrosis of vessel walls.\n\nBinding of the previously mentioned XNAs to the donor endothelium leads to the activation of host macrophages as well as the endothelium itself. The endothelium activation is considered type II since gene induction and protein synthesis are involved. The binding of XNAs ultimately leads to the development of a procoagulant state, the secretion of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, as well as expression of leukocyte adhesion molecules such as E-selectin, intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1).\n\nThis response is further perpetuated as normally binding between regulatory proteins and their ligands aid in the control of coagulation and inflammatory responses. However, due to molecular incompatibilities between the molecules of the donor species and recipient (such as porcine major histocompatibility complex molecules and human natural killer cells), this may not occur.\n\nDue to its complexity, the use of immunosuppressive drugs along with a wide array of approaches are necessary to prevent acute vascular rejection, and include: \n\nIf hyperacute and acute vascular rejection are avoided accommodation is possible, which is the survival of the xenograft despite the presence of circulating XNAs. The graft is given a break from humoral rejection when the complement cascade is interrupted, circulating antibodies are removed, or their function is changed, or there is a change in the expression of surface antigens on the graft. This allows the xenograft to up-regulate and express protective genes, which aid in resistance to injury, such as heme oxygenase-1 (an enzyme that catalyzes the degradation of heme).\n\nRejection of the xenograft in hyperactute and acute vascular rejection is due to the response of the humoral immune system, since the response is elicited by the XNAs. Cellular rejection is based on cellular immunity, and is mediated by: \n\nIn direct xenorecognition, antigen presenting cells from the xenograft present peptides to recipient CD4 T cells via xenogeneic MHC class II molecules, resulting in the production of interleukin 2 (IL-2). Indirect xenorecognition involves the presentation of antigens from the xenograft by recipient antigen presenting cells to CD4 T cells. Antigens of phagocytosed graft cells can also be presented by the host’s class I MHC molecules to CD8 T cells.\n\nThe strength of cellular rejection in xenografts remains uncertain, however it is expected to be stronger than in allografts due to differences in peptides among different animals. This leads to more antigens potentially recognized as foreign, thus eliciting a greater indirect xenogenic response.\n\nA proposed strategy to avoid cellular rejection is to induce donor non-responsiveness using hematopoietic chimerism. Donor stem cells are introduced into the bone marrow of the recipient, where they coexist with the recipient’s stem cells. The bone marrow stem cells give rise to cells of all hematopoietic lineages, through the process of hematopoiesis. Lymphoid progenitor cells are created by this process and move to the thymus where negative selection eliminates T cells found to be reactive to self. The existence of donor stem cells in the recipient’s bone marrow causes donor reactive T cells to be considered self and undergo apoptosis.\n\nChronic rejection is slow and progressive, and usually occurs in transplants that survive the initial rejection phases. Scientists are still unclear how chronic rejection exactly works, research in this area is difficult since xenografts rarely survive past the initial acute rejection phases. Nonetheless, it is known that XNAs and the complement system are not primarily involved. Fibrosis in the xenograft occurs as a result of immune reactions, cytokines (which stimulate fibroblasts), or healing (following cellular necrosis in acute rejection). Perhaps the major cause of chronic rejection is arteriosclerosis. Lymphocytes, which were previously activated by antigens in the vessel wall of the graft, activate macrophages to secrete smooth muscle growth factors. This results in a build up of smooth muscle cells on the vessel walls, causing the hardening and narrowing of vessels within the graft. Chronic rejection leads to pathologic changes of the organ, and is why transplants must be replaced after so many years. It is also anticipated that chronic rejection will be more aggressive in xenotransplants as opposed to allotransplants.\n\nSuccessful efforts have been made to create knockout mice without α1,3GT; the resulting reduction in the highly immunogenic αGal epitope has resulted in the reduction of the occurrence of hyperacute rejection, but has not eliminated other barriers to xenotransplantation such as dysregulated coagulation, also known as coagulopathy.\n\nDifferent organ xenotransplants result in different responses in clotting. For example, kidney transplants result in a higher degree of coagulopathy, or impaired clotting, than cardiac transplants, whereas liver xenografts result in severe thrombocytopenia, causing recipient death within a few days due to bleeding. An alternate clotting disorder, thrombosis, may be initiated by preexisting antibodies that affect the protein C anticoagulant system. Due to this effect, porcine donors must be extensively screened before transplantation. Studies have also shown that some porcine transplant cells are able to induce human tissue factor expression, thus stimulating platelet and monocyte aggregation around the xenotransplanted organ, causing severe clotting. Additionally, spontaneous platelet accumulation may be caused by contact with pig von Willebrand factor.\n\nJust as the α1,3G epitope is a major problem in xenotransplantation, so too is dysregulated coagulation a cause of concern. Transgenic pigs that can control for variable coagulant activity based on the specific organ transplanted would make xenotransplantation a more readily available solution for the 70,000 patients per year who do not receive a human donation of the organ or tissue they need.\n\nExtensive research is required to determine whether animal organs can replace the physiological functions of human organs. Many issues include:\n\n\nXenozoonosis, also known as zoonosis or xenosis, is the transmission of infectious agents between species via xenograft. Animal to human infection is normally rare, but has occurred in the past. An example of such is the avian influenza, when an influenza A virus was passed from birds to humans. Xenotransplantation may increase the chance of disease transmission for 3 reasons:\n\nExamples of viruses carried by pigs include porcine herpesvirus, rotavirus, parvovirus, and circovirus. Porcine herpesviruses and rotaviruses can be eliminated from the donor pool by screening, however others (such as parvovirus and circovirus) may contaminate food and footwear then re-infect the herd. Thus, pigs to be used as organ donors must be housed under strict regulations and screened regularly for microbes and pathogens. Unknown viruses, as well as those not harmful in the animal, may also pose risks. Of particular concern are PERVS (porcine endogenous retroviruses), vertically transmitted microbes that embed in swine genomes. The risks with xenosis are twofold, as not only could the individual become infected, but a novel infection could initiate an epidemic in the human population. Because of this risk, the FDA has suggested any recipients of xenotransplants shall be closely monitored for the remainder of their life, and quarantined if they show signs of xenosis.\n\nBaboons and pigs carry myriad transmittable agents that are harmless in their natural host, but extremely toxic and deadly in humans. HIV is an example of a disease believed to have jumped from monkeys to humans. Researchers also do not know if an outbreak of infectious diseases could occur and if they could contain the outbreak even though they have measures for control. Another obstacle facing xenotransplants is that of the body’s rejection of foreign objects by its immune system. These antigens (foreign objects) are often treated with powerful immunosuppressive drugs that could, in turn, make the patient vulnerable to other infections and actually aid the disease. This is the reason the organs would have to be altered to fit the patients' DNA (histocompatibility).\n\nIn 2005, the Australian National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) declared an eighteen-year moratorium on all animal-to-human transplantation, concluding that the risks of transmission of animal viruses to patients and the wider community had not been resolved.\nThis was repealed in 2009 after an NHMRC review stated \"... the risks, if appropriately regulated, are minimal and acceptable given the potential benefits.\", citing international developments on the management and regulation of xenotransplantation by the World Health Organisation and the European Medicines Agency.\n\nEndogenous retroviruses are remnants of ancient viral infections, found in the genomes of most, if not all, mammalian species. Integrated into the chromosomal DNA, they are vertically transferred through inheritance. Due to the many deletions and mutations they accumulate over time, they usually are not infectious in the host species, however the virus may become infectious in another species. PERVS were originally discovered as retrovirus particles released from cultured porcine kidney cells. Most breeds of swine harbor approximately 50 PERV genomes in their DNA. Although it is likely that most of these are defective, some may be able to produce infectious viruses so every proviral genome must be sequenced to identify which ones pose a threat. In addition, through complementation and genetic recombination, two defective PERV genomes could give rise to an infectious virus. There are three subgroups of infectious PERVs (PERV-A, PERV-B, and PERV-C). Experiments have shown that PERV-A and PERV-B can infect human cells in culture. To date no experimental xenotransplantations have demonstrated PERV transmission, yet this does not mean PERV infections in humans are impossible. Pig cells have been engineered to inactivate all 62 PERVs in the genome using CRISPR Cas9 genome editing technology, and eliminated infection from the pig to human cells in culture.\n\nXenografts have been a controversial procedure since they were first attempted. Many, including animal rights groups, strongly oppose killing animals to harvest their organs for human use. None of the major religions object to the use of genetically modified pig organs for life-saving transplantation. In general, the use of pig and cow tissue in humans has been met with little resistance, save some religious beliefs and a few philosophical objections. Experimentation without consent doctrines are now followed, which was not the case in the past, which may lead to new religious guidelines to further medical research on pronounced ecumenical guidelines. The \"Common Rule\" is the United States bio-ethics mandate .\n\nAutonomy and informed consent are important when considering the future uses of xenotransplantation. A patient undergoing xenotransplantation should be fully aware of the procedure and should have no outside force influencing their choice. The patient should understand the risks and benefits of such a transplantation. However, it has been suggested that friends and family members should also give consent, because the repercussions of transplantation are high, with the potential of diseases and viruses crossing over to humans from the transplantation. Close contacts are at risk for such infections. Monitoring of close relations may also be required to ensure that xenozoonosis is not occurring. The question then becomes: does the autonomy of the patient become limited based on the willingness or unwillingness of friends and family to give consent, and are the principles of confidentiality broken?\n\nThe safety of public health is a factor to be considered. If there is any risk to the public at all for an outbreak from transplantation there must be procedures in place to protect the public. Not only does the recipient of the transplantation have to understand the risks and benefits, but society must also understand and consent to such an agreement.\n\nThe Ethics Committee of the International Xenotransplantation Association points out one major ethical issue is the societal response to such a procedure. The assumption is that the recipient of the transplantation will be asked to undergo lifelong monitoring, which would deny the recipient the ability to terminate the monitoring at any time, which is in direct opposition of the Declaration of Helsinki and the US Code of Federal Regulations.\nIn 2007, xenotransplantation was banned under ethical grounds in all countries but Argentina, Russia and New Zealand. Since then, the practice has only been carried out to treatment for diabetes type 1 to serve as a substitute for penicillin injections. \n\nThe Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has also stated that if a transplantation takes place the recipient must undergo monitoring for the rest of that recipient's lifetime and waive their right to withdraw. The reason for requiring lifelong monitoring is due to the risk of acute infections that may occur. The FDA suggests that a passive screening program should be implemented and should extend for the life of the recipient.\n\n\n"}
