He is known for having collected money with promise of overseas jobs from thousands of people and disappearing after having caused over (estimated) 10 million of EEK of damages in 1993.\n\nNeuvonen published in newspapers (mostly Russian) large and eye-catching ads on behalf of Inter Work Corporation, supposedly established in 1930s headquartered in Jerusalem and Bangkok, offering jobs in hotels, pubs and factories in South America, Arabia and Europe. Job-seekers were charged 2335 EEK in advance; the fee was supposed to cover costs of \"foreign passport\" (note that this Soviet-era relic had long before disappeared from Estonian jurisprudence), visa, airline tickets and Estonian income tax. At that time, the average salary in Estonia was about 1070 EEK, and due to the aftermath of the crash of the GOSPLAN-governed Soviet economy, joblessness was around 17%. (Due to GOSPLAN's main interest being in the military-industrial plants in Northern Estonia, which had been manned primarily by Russophone migrants from Soviet Union transferred to Estonia specifically to work there, the high joblessness affected particularly Russophone people.)\n\nNeuvonen also spread rumours that the first batch of jobs, supposedly scheduled to start working in Germany, at industrial plants of Kodak, had already been fulfilled — thus implying that the number of jobs was limited, and enticing victims to bribe Neuvonen with US$100 (about 1200 EEK at the then-current rates) fee for their positions in the queue to be lifted higher.\n\nAfter enjoying long queues of jobseekers wanting to pay the fee, Neuvonen announced that the visas, air tickets and job permits would be handed over to everybody on 23 March 1993 in the banquette hall of the Viru hotel. However, Neuvonen's office, opened on 10 January 1993, was closed already on 9 February 1993, and documents presented by the jobseekers were found in a garbage bin next to the office's door.\n\nIn the investigation, it was discovered that on one of the company's supposed offices addresses was wasteland, and the other only held an electricity transmission substation — both places unsuitable for offices. Furthermore, three of the people supposedly investing in the company through its incorporation agreement did not exist.\n\nPolice estimated that at least 3000 people paid Neuvonen the 2335 EEK of advance fee; some analysts have speculated there were up to 5000 victims. After closure of the office, only 32 000 EEK were recovered from one of the company's banking accounts.\n\nIn 1993, Neuvonen, then using the alias of Daniil Rosenberg was reported to be advertising little-used American and Japanese cars for 1000 USD on Ukrainian TV, defrauding hundreds of people out of an estimated million USD.\n\nIn 1994, Neuvonen, then presenting himself as a citizen of Norway, was reported to be offering jobs in Europe to poor people in Bulgaria, defrauding about 400 people out of an estimated million USD.\n\nNeuvonen was never caught, and has been declared dead due to disappearance by an Estonian court at request of his wife of hurried marriage, whom he had fraudulently sold an apartment on Lasnamäe.\n\n\n"}

His death went unpunished.\n\nOn April 19, 1920, the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) and the Metal Mine Workers Industrial Union called for a strike in the mines around Butte. They hoped the strike would help secure higher wages, an eight-hour day, and end the use of the rustling card, a system that allowed employers to blacklist employees involved in union organizing, among other goals. The strike came at a weak point for the union movement in Butte. World War I had undermined the power of the Butte Miners Union and the mines around the town were open shops. Only six years earlier, in 1914, the Butte Miners Union Hall had been destroyed. Rising copper prices, fatal mining accidents, and recruitment by the IWW had further exacerbated tensions in the town. Three years before the strike, an IWW organizer named Frank Little was beaten and hanged from a railroad trestle by unknown assailants. Thus, the strike began in an atmosphere of tension.\n\nThe day the strike was called, picketers began blocking roads to mines in the area, including the Anaconda Road. These picketers turned non-striking miners away from the mines. By the second day of the strike, the picketers had succeeded in shutting down nearly all mining in Butte. The same day, a local newspaper called the Butte Daily Bulletin reported that the head of the Anaconda Copper Mining Company had suggested killings and hangings to help end the strike. On the 21st, the local sheriff deputized the Anaconda mine guards in an attempt to contain the strike.\n\nThat afternoon, a few hundred picketers gathered outside the Anaconda company's Neversweat Mine. The sheriff arrived and apparently attempted to mediate the dispute. However, the Anaconda mine guards opened fire on the picketers, although the reason why the shooting began is unclear. Sixteen miners were hit, and one, Tom Manning, was killed. All were shot in the back as they tried to flee.\n\nFederal troops arrived on the 22nd, ostensibly to prevent further violence. A labor newspaper that wrote about the strike was suppressed. Three weeks later, the strike collapsed completely and the miners returned to work. No one was found guilty as a result of the massacre, despite an inquest into the death of Tom Manning. During the inquest, Anaconda employees testified that a shot had been fired at them from a boarding house across the street, something which residents of the boarding house disputed. Cross-examination of witnesses by union attorneys suggested that the Anaconda employees had received coaching to make their stories align. Anaconda attorneys attempted to undermine their accusers by pointing out that some of the miners had recently immigrated to the United States. In the end, the jury declared that Manning had been killed by a bullet but that the bullet had been fired by unknown persons, and his death is still officially unsolved.\n\nThe strike and massacre were the last major labor conflict in the area until the 1934 passage of the National Recovery Act allowed outside support to help rebuild the weakened Butte Miners Union.\n\nDashiell Hammett, once a Pinkerton agent stationed in Butte, Montana—where he (allegedly) turned down an offer to assassinate Little—used some historical background on union troubles and corporate corruption in his novel \"Red Harvest\". The Op summarizes the local history as, \"The strike lasted eight months. Both sides bled plenty. The wobblies [ Industrial Workers of the World ] had to do their own bleeding. Old Elihu hired gunmen, strike-breakers, national guardsmen and even parts of the regular army, to do his. When the last skull had been cracked, the last rib kicked in, organized labor in Personville was a used firecracker.\" His client justifies the violence with, \"Son, if I hadn't been a pirate I'd still be working for the Anaconda for wages, and there'd be no Personville Mining Corporation.\"\n\n"}

According to Du Cange, he succeeded a certain Hugues as Master of the Temple, although this Hugues is otherwise unknown. He was elected Grand Master in June 1151, after the abdication of Everard des Barres, who had returned to France following the Second Crusade. King Baldwin III of Jerusalem granted him the ruined city of Gaza, which Bernard rebuilt for the Templars.\n\nIn 1153 the Templars participated in the Battle of Ascalon, a fortress at that time controlled by Egypt. The Templars constructed a siege tower, which was burned down by the Egyptian soldiers inside Ascalon. The wind caught the flames and part of the walls of Ascalon burned down as well.\n\nAccording to William of Tyre, knights of the Order rushed through the breach without Baldwin's knowledge while Bernard prevented other crusaders from following, as he did not want to share the spoils of the city with the king. Bernard and about forty of his Templars were killed by the larger Egyptian garrison. Their bodies were displayed on the ramparts and their heads were sent to the sultan. Other more modern accounts say that William of Tyre's version may have been distorted, since it may have been based on the defensive accounts given by the army's commanders as to why they did not follow the Templars into the breach.\n\nIn yet another differing account by a Damascene chronicler in the city, the breach of the wall is mentioned as a precursor to the fall of the city; he makes no mention of the incident with the Templars.\n\nRegardless of which account is believed, Bernard was killed and beheaded during the fighting.\n\nA few days later, Baldwin captured the fortress; shortly thereafter, the Templars elected André de Montbard as their Grand Master.\n\n"}

Throughout the decade before his death, Savoy was governed through a joint regency resembling that devised for his grandfather Tomasso I in 1189, in which authority was shared between his mother, Cécile of Baux, and one of his uncles, Thomas II of Piedmont. Boniface's other uncles, Peter II and Philip I disputed this, seeking to divide the County's many properties, but Thomas took it to arbitration per the family treaty of 1234 which had been negotiated by his brother William and won out. The uncles were, however granted compensation in return, receiving more properties within the County. When Thomas died in 1259, Cecile continued as regent in Savoy. Under her regency, Philip and Peter continued their previous work of expanding the control and influence of the County of Savoy.\n\nBoniface's campaigns in Flanders and Piedmont were not successful. In September 1262, Rudolf of Geneva offered homage to cousin Boniface after yet another round of the war between Peter and their kin in Geneva. In 1263, Boniface was mortally wounded in battle and died, to be succeeded by his uncle Peter.\n\n"}

He does this in the dialogue through the character of Socrates, who uses it in a discussion of the merit of Love as \"divine madness\".\n\nPlato paints the picture of a Charioteer () driving a chariot pulled by two winged horses:\n\n\"First the charioteer of the human soul drives a pair, and secondly one of the horses is noble and of noble breed, but the other quite the opposite in breed and character. Therefore in our case the driving is necessarily difficult and troublesome.\"\n\nThe Charioteer represents intellect, reason, or the part of the soul that must guide the soul to truth; one horse represents rational or moral impulse or the positive part of passionate nature (e.g., righteous indignation); while the other represents the soul's irrational passions, appetites, or concupiscent nature. The Charioteer directs the entire chariot/soul, trying to stop the horses from going different ways, and to proceed towards enlightenment.\n\nPlato describes a \"great circuit\" which souls make as they follow the gods in the path of enlightenment. Those few souls which are fully enlightened are able to see the world of the forms in all its glory. Some souls have difficulty controlling the black horse, even with the help of the white horse. They may bob up into the world of the forms, but at other times enlightenment is hidden from them. If overcome by the black horse or forgetfulness, the soul loses its wings and is pulled down to earth.\n\nShould that happen, the soul is incarnated into one of nine kinds of person, according to how much truth it beheld. In order of decreasing levels of truth seen, the categories are: (1) philosophers, lovers of beauty, men of culture, or those dedicated to love; (2) law-abiding kings or civic leaders; (3) politicians, estate-managers or businessmen; (4) ones who specialize in bodily health; (5) prophets or mystery cult participants; (6) poets or imitative artists; (7) craftsmen or farmers; (8) sophists or demagogues; and (9) tyrants.\n\nOne need not suppose, of course, that Plato intended this as a literal discussion of metempsychosis or reincarnation: perhaps he meant it figuratively.\n\nPlato does not see the human soul as a sort of patchwork of emotions and concepts; this differs from the views of many philosophers of his time. Instead he views the soul as a sort of composite, in which many different elements blend together and affect each other. He uses the allegory of the charioteer to explain that love is a reflection of love of the forms, and is thus a \"divine madness,\" a \"theia mania\".\n\n\n"}

He was arrested in 1989 for four murders committed in his neighborhood: a woman and her two daughters that year, and the murder of another woman two years earlier. He had an existing criminal record for petty theft.\n\nPrice calmly confessed to his crimes after he was discovered. He was arrested a month before his 16th birthday and was tried and convicted as a minor. By law, this meant that he would be released and his criminal records sealed as soon as he turned 21, and Price bragged that he would \"make history\" when he was released. The case led to changes in state law to allow juveniles to be tried as adults for serious crimes, but these could not be applied retroactively to Price. Rhode Island residents formed the group Citizens Opposed to the Release of Craig Price to lobby for his continued imprisonment, due to the brutality of his crimes and the opinion of state psychologists that he was a poor candidate for rehabilitation. \n\nDuring his incarceration, Price has been charged with a number of additional crimes, including criminal contempt for refusing a psychological evaluation, extortion for threatening a corrections officer, assault, and violation of probation for fights while in prison. He was sentenced to an additional 10–25 years, depending on his cooperation with treatment.\n\nPrice committed his first murder at the age of 13 in Warwick, Rhode Island on the night of July 27, 1987. Price broke into a home that was only two houses away from his own whereupon he took a knife from the kitchen and stabbed 27 year old Rebecca Spencer 58 times, killing her.\n\nA little over two years later Price was a 15 year old freshman in high school when he murdered three other neighbors on September 1, 1989. Price, high on marijuana and LSD, stabbed 39 year old Joan Heaton 57 times, stabbed her 10 year old daughter Jennifer 62 times, and crushed the skull of Heaton's 8 year old daughter Melissa (as well as inflicting 30 stab wounds). The stabbings were so brutal that the handles broke off the knives he used, the blades staying inside the bodies of the victims. At the time, the brutality of the murders was mostly unknown due to Price's sealed records. According to law-enforcement officials, Price had no remorse when confessing to the crimes.\nAs to the motive, Price himself believes exposure to racism by whites as a young child was a factor in the murders.\n\nOn July 29, 2009, Craig was involved in a prison fight with another inmate. While trying to break up the fight, one of the correctional officers was stabbed in the finger by a handmade shank in Price's possession. In the wake of the prison fight, Price has been transferred to another facility. An officer from the Rhode Island Department of Corrections said Price has been booked twice for fighting since leaving the Adult Correctional Institutions in Cranston. Price was denied parole in March 2009 and his current release date is in May 2020.\n\nOn April 4, 2017 Price was accused of stabbing fellow inmate Joshua Davis, at the Suwannee Correctional Institution in Live Oak, Florida, with a 5\" homemade knife. His current Trial Date is set for September 24th, 2018. \n\n"}

As the Crimson Commando, he was one of a trio of World War II veteran super-heroes recruited to be a member of Freedom Force, the original government-sponsored mutant team. Earlier, along with his partners, Stonewall and Super Sabre, Bohannan had become a vigilante who captured criminals, released them and hunted them in Adirondack State Park in upstate New York. The trio killed the criminals, both to reduce the criminal element in society and for the enjoyment of hunting them.\n\nThe trio captured Pamela Morrison, a drug dealer, and mistaking Storm (the leader of the X-Men) for a criminal, the trio hunted and captured her as well. The women were set out for the vigilantes to hunt both to their deaths. The Crimson Commando killed Morrison, but Wolverine arrived to help Storm. When Storm and Wolverine eventually defeated the trio, Stonewall and Crimson Commando agreed to turn themselves in to law enforcement authorities and confess their vigilantism. Stonewall, Crimson Commando, and Super Sabre (who had been presumed dead) agreed to join Freedom Force, a U.S. government sponsored team of superhumans, in exchange for a commutation of their sentences.\n\nOn his first mission with Freedom Force, he fought the X-Men in Dallas, and battled cavemen transported to Dallas by time-waves created by the Adversary. He watched a telecast of the X-Men's deaths in order to defeat the Adversary, and then witnessed the return of Forge to Dallas without the X-Men. While still in Dallas, Freedom Force also contended against the New Mutants.\n\nCrimson Commando was also a part of the Freedom Force mission to attempt capture Cyclops and Marvel Girl, who defeated Freedom Force. He also assisted the team's attempt to capture Rusty Collins, which was thwarted by the New Mutants. He again fights Rusty Collins and his girlfriend Skids, alongside Freedom Force; this time, they captured Rusty and Skids. With Freedom Force, he also pursued Cable, who had escaped federal custody.\n\nCrimson Commando would be gravely wounded during a bungled mission in the Middle East. Freedom Force was sent to Kuwait City to rescue or kill physicist Reinhold Kurtzmann, but they encountered the Arabic super-team called Desert Sword. Teammate Super Sabre was killed, while the Crimson Commando's right hand was severed by the \"cutting wind\" of Aminedi. Bohannan was seriously wounded, and Avalanche was forced to abandon Blob and Pyro in the desert to save his life. Bohannan was evacuated from Kuwait for hospitalization.\n\nThe Crimson Commando next appeared having been turned into a cyborg going by the name of Cyborg X. He had been rebuilt by CARE LABS but a testing accident had caused him to malfunction bringing him into a confrontation with Spider-Man and Ghost Rider. Cyborg X would later assist Spider-Man in battling the Sinister Six but was believed to have been killed in an explosion at CARE LABS.\n\nNow going by only the name Commando, Bohannan next appeared on a mission for Project Wideawake. He was teamed-up with his former Freedom Force teammate Avalanche to infiltrate the reclusive Empyrean's headquarters and put his operation out of commission. They were also ordered by a rogue government official to assassinate Polaris of X-Factor.\n\nCommando appears in the reality-altered House of M storyline serving as one of Magneto's royal guards. After this and M-Day he lost his mutant powers.\n\nWithout his powers, Commando begins to die. He kidnaps Hope Summers in an attempt to have her save him. Wolverine rescues her and decapitates Crimson Commando.\n\nA young, female, African-American version of Crimson Commando appeared very briefly as a member of Mystique's new Brotherhood of Mutants. Her name was never stated and her powers never exhibited, but Chris Claremont previously stated there would be a new Super Sabre, Mastermind and Crimson Commando.\n\nA Human/Cyborg version of Crimson Commando is a member of the Freedom Force. His power armor is equipped with two automatic machine guns as hands, and a machine/rail gun mounted on left shoulder.\n\nFrank Bohannan is a mutant who has the ability to achieve the peak of human physical perfection, although just right beneath superhuman levels (similar to the physical enhancements granted by Captain America's super-soldier treatments). More specifically, his mutation has kept his body at the very peak of physical perfection a baseline human can achieve without becoming a superhuman, and thus apparently ages at a much slower rate than normal human beings. This also seems to include enhanced resistance to injury, managing to survive having his right hand severed and bleeding continuously for an hour, before being maimed by a land mine. Although he was on the brink of death, He managed to hang on long enough to receive medical attention and survive.\n\nFrank can carry out actions while submerging his conscious thought processes so deeply within his mind that his mind is shielded from telepathic detection. He also exhibited some degree of super-vision, able to see his super-fast teammate Super Sabre when the speedster was moving at superhuman velocities.\n\nBohannan wore a computer and modem device on his wrist, and carried knives, daggers, and conventional handguns as weapons. He is an extraordinary hand-to-hand combatant and commando fighter, and is also a highly skilled hunter and tracker.\n\nSince becoming a cyborg, the extent of his abilities is largely unknown. One arm was replaced by a large gun, his legs are now metal and he can walk up the side of buildings, and at least one eye was replaced with an optical sensor able to see beyond the range of normal human vision.\n\nA similarly named character called the Commander Crimson appears in the Ultimate Marvel continuity. Sayuri Kyota was an ex-agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. who joined Hydra, providing the latter with the former's weapons and secrets. When the Ultimates attack her Hydra cell, she has confrontations with Nick Fury and against Iron Patriot before disintegrating from using an Infinity Stone.\n\n\n"}

It is considered the most recent ancestor of all fungus-farming ants and a living fossil.\n\n\"Cyatta\" is a neologism constructed in part from the Brazilian Tupi language word \"Cy\", meaning \"sister,\" referring to its status, along with the genus \"Kalathomyrmex\", as the sister clade to the remaining genera of the informal clade Neoattini, to which the genus \"Atta\", the most conspicuous member of the Neoattini, belongs. The specific name \"abscondita\" refers to the exceedingly secretive nature of this species, which, after being recognized from a few rare specimens, proved frustratingly elusive during multiple attempts to locate it in the field.\n\nIn 2003, a single stray worker of \"C. abscondita\" was taken in a pitfall trap as part of an ant survey conducted at the Reserva Particular do Patrimônio Natural Serra das Almas, Crateús, Ceará, Brazil, a relatively undisturbed area of Caatinga, a biome characterized by deciduous thorny woodland vegetation. The specimen was deposited in the Museum of Zoology of the University of São Paulo (MZUSP) ant collection, where it was at first associated with the \"Mycetophylax\" species group, but subsequently recognized as a new neoattine genus. This isolated specimen inspired the first attempt to locate \"C. abscondita\" in the field in Serra das Almas in 2009. Unfortunately, it was the end of the rainy season and the soil was covered by a dense layer of grass, impairing observations of all small and inconspicuous ants. Visual searching and leaf-litter extraction failed to locate additional specimens, as did subsequent surveys at the same locality.\n\nIn 2008, two workers were taken in pitfall traps in the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE) Cerrado preserve, near Fazenda Água Limpa (FAL) in Brasília, Federal District, Brazil. These specimens, deposited in the MZUSP, inspired attempts to locate the species at this locality beginning in 2009. The first such attempt yielded only the collection of a series of stray workers and an unsuccessful nest excavation; however, subsequent visits resulted in the excavations of multiple nests and collections of gynes, larvae, and cultivated fungi.\n\nThe only known male of the species was collected in 2011 from two nests of \"C. abscondita\" while excavating a nest of \"Mycocepurus goeldii\" in the Broa Preserve, Itirapina, São Paulo, Brazil.\n\nThe earliest known collection of \"C. abscondita\" was that of a stray worker taken in a leaf-litter sample in Paineiras, Minas Gerais, in 1999, only recently discovered in the entomological collection at MZUSP and recognized as belonging to this species. Most recently, in 2011, two workers of \"C. abscondita\" were recovered from pitfall traps in fragments of semideciduous forests in the Sales and Pindorama municipalities in northwestern São Paulo state. This history of discovery indicates that \"C. abscondita\" is rarely collected by traditional methods. The cryptic nature of foragers and of nest entrances makes it almost invisible to traditional hand collecting. The rarity of individuals in pitfall and leaf-litter samples remains puzzling, since the concentrations of nests encountered at FAL and Broa Preserve suggest that it is locally abundant.\n\nResults of molecular phylogenetic analyses incorporating four nuclear gene sequences from \"Cyatta abscondita\" confirm the previous finding that the tribe Attini is divided by an ancient divergence into two major clades, the Paleoattini and the Neoattini. \"Cyatta abscondita\" occupies a relatively isolated position in the latter clade, distantly related to the monotypic genus \"Kalathomyrmex\", the result of an early divergence in the Neoattini. Its phylogenetic position, nested well within the paraphyletic group of \"lower attine ants,\" strongly supports the hypothesis that \"C. abscondita\" practices \"lower attine agriculture\".\n\n"}

Richard Fitzgerald died in an insane asylum in 1862 from syphilis-induced dementia, and his widow took her four children (Eddie was second oldest) to Chicago, where she reportedly at one time tended the mentally ill widow of Abraham Lincoln.\n\nSix-year-old Eddie began performing in the streets and local saloons to support his family. At 15 he changed his name to Foy, and with a partner began dancing in bars, traveling throughout the western United States. He worked for a time as a supernumerary in theatrical productions, sharing a stage at times with such leading men of the time as Edwin Booth and Joseph Jefferson. With another partner, Jim Thompson, Foy went west again and gained his first professional recognition in mining camps and cow towns. In one such town, Dodge City, Kansas, Foy and his partner lingered for some time and Foy became acquainted with notable citizens Wyatt Earp, Bat Masterson, and Doc Holliday. In later years, Foy told of an altercation over a girl with fellow actor Charles Chaplin (not the later film star), who was drunkenly taking pot-shots at Foy. The gunfire awakened Wyatt Earp, who disarmed the actor and sent both the players home to sleep it off. Foy is also rumored to have been in Tombstone, Arizona, in October 1881, appearing at the Birdcage Theater when the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral occurred on the 26th of that month.\n\nIn 1879, Foy married Rose Howland, one of the singing Howland Sisters, who were traveling the same circuit. Three years later, Foy and troupe relocated to Philadelphia and joined the Carncross Minstrels. That same year, however, Rose died in childbirth, as did the child she was delivering. Foy lingered with the troupe for two seasons and then returned to the road. He joined David Henderson's troupe and traveled all around the U.S., dancing, doing comedy, and acting in farces. In San Francisco, still in 1882, he met Lola Sefton and was romantically involved with her for ten years until her death in 1894; the two never married, but had a daughter named Catherine who was raised by Foy's sister, Mary.\n\nFoy returned to Chicago in 1888 as the star comedian in variety shows and revues, initially for his own company. He played the variety circuits for years in a series of song and dance acts, eventually rising to musical comedy stardom in such Broadway hits as \"The Strollers\" (1901) and \"Mr. Bluebeard\" (1903). Foy specialized in eccentric routines and costumes, often appearing in drag to hilarious effect.\n\nIn 1896, Foy married his third wife, Madeline Morando, a dancer with his company. She gave him eleven children, of whom seven survived childhood: Bryan (1896–1977); Charley (1898–1984); Mary (1901–1987); Madeline (1903–1988); Eddie Jr. (1905–1983); Richard (1905–1947); and Irving (1908–2003). Eddie Jr.'s son, Eddie III, was a casting director with Columbia Pictures for over 40 years.\n\nBetween 1901 and 1912, Foy played the leading comic roles in a series of musical comedies in New York City and on tour, including \"The Strollers\" (1901), \"The Wild Rose\" (1902), \"Mr. Bluebeard\" (1903), \"Piff! Paff! Pouf!\" (1904), \"The Earl and the Girl\" (1905), \"The Orchid\" (1907), \"Mr Hamlet of Broadway\" (1908/9), \"Up and Down Broadway\" (1910), and \"Over the River\" (1912). It was while on tour with \"Mr. Bluebeard\" that he became a hero of Chicago’s infamous Iroquois Theatre Fire, December 30, 1903. A malfunctioning spotlight set fire to the scenery backstage, and Foy stayed onstage until the last minute, trying to keep the audience from panicking. Survivors later praised Foy for his bravery in trying to keep the crowd calm, even as burning debris fell onto the stage all around him. The theater’s safety features were inadequate, the theater personnel untrained, and some of the exits locked from the outside, and at least 600 people died. Foy escaped by crawling through a sewer.\n\nBetween 1910 and 1913, he formed a family vaudeville act, \"Eddie Foy and The Seven Little Foys\", which quickly became a national sensation. While Foy was a stern disciplinarian backstage, he portrayed an indulgent father onstage, and the Foys toured successfully for over a decade, appearing in one motion picture. His wife Madeline died in 1918. The children began to go their separate ways after Foy married Marie Reilly Coombs in 1923, but four of the younger children (Charley, Mary, Madeline and Irving) performed together until the mid 1930s. Foy continued to appear in vaudeville and starred in the hit Broadway comedy \"The Fallen Star\" in 1927. He died of a heart attack while headlining on the Orpheum circuit in Kansas City, Missouri, at age 71.\n\nThe seven children reunited for a 1928 Vitaphone short #2580, \"Chips of (sic) the Old Block\". Six of the seven appeared onscreen, doing a portion of their song-and-dance act, and Bryan directed. The film opens with the girls singing and dancing to \"I'll Just Roll Along (Havin' My Ups and Downs)\" while Bryan plays ukulele. Charley, Eddie Jr., and Irving then perform a comedy routine. Next, Eddie Jr. does an eccentric dance routine, there's a short song interlude, and the film ends with soft shoe routine in which each has a solo bit.\nAfter the \"Seven Little Foys\" stopped performing together, they pursued separate careers. Eddie Foy Jr. had a successful acting career on stage and screen. Bryan composed show music, wrote for Buster Keaton, and directed and produced films in Hollywood. Richard continued to operate a theater chain business in Dallas that he had started with Foy. Irving wrote and managed cinemas in Dallas and Albuquerque. Charley and Mary operated the Charley Foy Supper Club in Sherman Oaks, California, where comedians such as Jackie Gleason, Dan Rowan, Dick Martin, and Phil Silvers appeared early in their careers.\n\nThe family’s story was filmed in 1955 as \"The Seven Little Foys\" with Bob Hope as Foy and James Cagney as George M. Cohan; Charley Foy narrated. Eddie Foy Jr. appeared as his father in four films – \"Frontier Marshal\" (1939), \"Lillian Russell\" (1940), \"Yankee Doodle Dandy\" (1942), and \"Wilson\" (1944) – as well as in a television version of \"The Seven Little Foys\" with Mickey Rooney as George M. Cohan (1964). The first stage musical version of \"The Seven Little Foys,\" written by Chip Deffaa, premiered at the Seven Angels Theater in Waterbury, Connecticut, in 2007. In 2008, it was revived in New York at the New York International Fringe Festival; the cast included Ryan Foy, Foy's great grandson and grandson of Irving Foy.\n\nIn 1928, Foy died at the age of 71 of a Myocardial infarction. His wife died the same year. All of Foy's children except Bryan are buried with their father at Holy Sepulchre Cemetery in New Rochelle, New York.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "290921", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=290921", "title": "Epiphanius of Salamis", "text": "Epiphanius of Salamis\n\nEpiphanius of Salamis (; c. 310–320 – 403) was bishop of Salamis, Cyprus, at the end of the 4th century. He is considered a saint and a Church Father by both the Orthodox and Roman Catholic Churches. He gained a reputation as a strong defender of orthodoxy. He is best known for composing the \"Panarion\", a very large compendium of the heresies up to his own time, full of quotations that are often the only surviving fragments of suppressed texts. According to Ernst Kitzinger, he \"seems to have been the first cleric to have taken up the matter of Christian religious images as a major issue\", and there has been much controversy over how many of the quotations attributed to him by the Byzantine Iconoclasts were actually by him. Regardless of this he was clearly strongly against some contemporary uses of images in the church.\n\nEpiphanius was born into a Christian Greek family in the small settlement of Besanduk, near Eleutheropolis (modern-day Beit Guvrin, Israel), and lived as a monk in Egypt, where he was educated and came into contact with Valentinian groups. He returned to Palestine around 333, when he was still a young man, and he founded a monastery at Ad nearby, which is often mentioned in the polemics of Jerome with Rufinus and John, Bishop of Jerusalem. He was ordained a priest, and lived and studied as superior of the monastery in Ad that he founded for thirty years and gained much skill and knowledge in that position. In that position he gained the ability to speak in several tongues, including Hebrew, Syriac, Egyptian, Greek, and Latin, and was called by Jerome on that account \"Pentaglossis\" (\"Five tongued\").\n\nHis reputation for learning prompted his nomination and consecration as Bishop of Salamis, Cyprus, in 365 or 367, a post which he held until his death. He was also the Metropolitan of the Church of Cyprus. He served as bishop for nearly forty years, as well as travelled widely to combat unorthodox beliefs. He was present at a synod in Antioch (376) where the Trinitarian questions were debated against the heresy of Apollinarianism. He upheld the position of Bishop Paulinus, who had the support of Rome, over that of Meletius of Antioch, who was supported by the Eastern Churches. In 382 he was present at the Council of Rome, again upholding the cause of Paulinus.\n\nDuring a visit to Palestine in 394 or 395, while preaching in Jerusalem, he attacked Origen's followers and urged the Bishop of Jerusalem, John II, to condemn his writings. He urged John to be careful of the \"offence\" of images in the churches. He noted that when travelling in Palestine he went into a church to pray and saw a curtain with an image of Christ or a saint which he tore down. He told Bishop John that such images were \"opposed . . . to our religion\" (see below). This event sowed the seeds of conflict which erupted in the dispute between Rufinus and John against Jerome and Epiphanius. Epiphanius fuelled this conflict by ordaining a priest for Jerome's monastery at Bethlehem, thus trespassing on John's jurisdiction. This dispute continued during the 390s, in particular in the literary works by Rufinus and Jerome attacking one another.\n\nIn 399, the dispute took on another dimension, when the Bishop of Alexandria, Theophilus, who had initially supported John, changed his views and started persecuting Origenist monks in Egypt. As a result of this persecution, four of these monks, the so-called Tall Brothers, fled to Palestine, and then travelled to Constantinople, seeking support and spreading the controversy. John Chrysostom, Bishop of Constantinople, gave the monks shelter. Bishop Theophilus of Alexandria saw his chance to use this event to bring down his enemy Chrysostom: in 402 he summoned a council in Constantinople, and invited those supportive of his anti-Origenist views. Epiphanius, by this time nearly 80, was one of those summoned, and began the journey to Constantinople. However, when he realised he was being used as a tool by Theophilus against Chrysostom, who had given refuge to the monks persecuted by Theophilus and who were appealing to the emperor, Epiphanius started back to Salamis, only to die on the way home in 403.\n\nLetter LI in Jerome's letters gives Jerome's Latin translation, made at Epiphanius' request, of his letter, originally in Greek from c. 394, \"From Epiphanius, Bishop of Salamis, in Cyprus, to John, Bishop of Jerusalem\" (see previous section for wider context). The final section covers the often quoted incident of the curtain, which unlike other passages attributed to Epiphanius and quoted by the Iconoclasts, is accepted as authentic by modern scholars:\n\n9. Moreover, I have heard that certain persons have this grievance against me: When I accompanied you to the holy place called Bethel, there to join you in celebrating the Collect, after the use of the Church, I came to a villa called Anablatha and, as I was passing, saw a lamp burning there. Asking what place it was, and learning it to be a church, I went in to pray, and found there a curtain hanging on the doors of the said church, dyed and embroidered. It bore an image either of Christ or of one of the saints; I do not rightly remember whose the image was. Seeing this, and being loth that an image of a man should be hung up in Christ’s church contrary to the teaching of the Scriptures, I tore it asunder and advised the custodians of the place to use it as a winding sheet for some poor person. They, however, murmured, and said that if I made up my mind to tear it, it was only fair that I should give them another curtain in its place. As soon as I heard this, I promised that I would give one, and said that I would send it at once. Since then there has been some little delay, due to the fact that I have been seeking a curtain of the best quality to give to them instead of the former one, and thought it right to send to Cyprus for one. I have now sent the best that I could find, and I beg that you will order the presbyter of the place to take the curtain which I have sent from the hands of the Reader, and that you will afterwards give directions that curtains of the other sort—opposed as they are to our religion—shall not be hung up in any church of Christ. A man of your uprightness should be careful to remove an occasion of offence unworthy alike of the Church of Christ and of those Christians who are committed to your charge. Beware of Palladius of Galatia—a man once dear to me, but who now sorely needs God’s pity—for he preaches and teaches the heresy of Origen; and see to it that he does not seduce any of those who are intrusted to your keeping into the perverse ways of his erroneous doctrine. I pray that you may fare well in the Lord.\n\nHis best-known book is the \"Panarion\" which means \"medicine-chest\" (also known as \"Adversus Haereses\", \"Against Heresies\"), presented as a book of antidotes for those bitten by the serpent of heresy. Written between 374 and 377, it forms a handbook for dealing with the arguments of heretics.\n\nIt lists, and refutes, 80 heresies, some of which are not described in any other surviving documents from the time. Epiphanius begins with the 'four mothers' of pre-Christian heresy – 'barbarism', 'Scythism', 'Hellenism' and 'Judaism' – and then addresses the sixteen pre-Christian heresies that have flowed from them: four philosophical schools (Stoics, Platonists, Pythagoreans and Epicureans), and twelve Jewish sects. There then follows an interlude, telling of the Incarnation of the Word. After this, Epiphanius embarks on his account of the sixty Christian heresies, from assorted gnostics to the various trinitarian heresies of the fourth century, closing with the Collyridians and Messalians.\n\nWhile Epiphanius often let his zeal come before facts – he admits on one occasion that he writes against the Origenists-based only on hearsay (\"Panarion\", Epiphanius 71) – the \"Panarion\" is a valuable source of information on the Christian Church of the fourth century. It is also an important source regarding the early Jewish gospels such as the Gospel according to the Hebrews circulating among the Ebionites and the Nazarenes, as well as the followers of Cerinthus and Merinthus.\n\nOne unique feature of the \"Panarion\" is in the way that Epiphanius compares the various heretics to different poisonous beasts, going so far as to describe in detail the animal's characteristics, how it produces its poison, and how to protect oneself from the animal's bite or poison. For example, he describes his enemy Origen as \"a toad noisy from too much moisture which keeps croaking louder and louder.\" He compares the Gnostics to a particularly dreaded snake \"with no pangs.\" The Ebionites, a Christian sect that followed Jewish law, were described by Epiphanius as \"a monstrosity with many shapes, who practically formed the snake-like shape of the mythical many-headed Hydra in himself.\" In all, Epiphanius describes fifty animals, usually one per sect.\n\nAnother feature of the \"Panarion\" is the access its earlier sections provide to lost works, notably Justin Martyr's work on heresies, the Greek of Irenaeus' \"Against Heresies\", and Hippolytus' \"Syntagma\". The \"Panarion\" was first translated into English in 1987 and 1990.\n\nHis earliest known work is the \"Ancoratus\" (the well anchored man), which includes arguments against Arianism and the teachings of Origen. Aside from the polemics by which he is known, Epiphanius wrote a work of biblical antiquarianism, called, for one of its sections, \"On Weights and Measures\" (περὶ μέτρων καὶ στάθμων). It was composed in Constantinople for a Persian priest, in 392, and survives in Syriac, Armenian, and Georgian translations (this last is found in \"Shatberd ms 1141\" along with \"Physiologus\" and \"De Gemmis\"). The first section discusses the canon of the Old Testament and its versions, the second of measures and weights, and the third, the geography of Palestine. The texts appear not to have been given a polish but consist of rough notes and sketches, as Allen A. Shaw, a modern commentator, concluded; nevertheless Epiphanius' work on metrology was important in the history of measurement.\n\nAnother work, \"On the Twelve Gems\" (\"De Gemmis\"), survives in a number of fragments, the most complete of which is the Georgian. The letter written by Epiphanius to John, Bishop of Jerusalem, in 394 and preserved in Jerome's translation, is discussed above. The collection of homilies traditionally ascribed to a \"Saint Epiphanius, bishop\" are dated in the late fifth or sixth century and are not connected with Epiphanius of Salamis by modern scholars.\n\nSuch was Epiphanius's reputation for learning that the \"Physiologus\", the principal source of medieval bestiaries, came to be widely falsely attributed to him.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "6040376", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6040376", "title": "Gameplay of Pokémon", "text": "Gameplay of Pokémon\n\nThe gameplay of the \"Pokémon\" video game series involves the catching and training of a variety of fictional creatures called \"Pokémon\" and using them to battle other Trainers. Each successive generation of games builds upon this concept by introducing new Pokémon, items, and gameplay concepts. Some of the general concepts were featured elsewhere in the franchise before being introduced to the games; double battles appeared in the anime long before appearing in the games, and Pokémon Abilities are similar to the Pokémon Powers introduced in the \"Pokémon Trading Card Game\", which also introduced Shiny Pokémon, different colors of that type of the original Pokémon.\n\nEach of the games in the handheld \"Pokémon\" RPG series, from \nthe first games in 1996 to the latest ones in 2017, takes place in a particular fictional region of the Pokémon world, and begins with the player receiving a Starter Pokémon from that region's Pokémon Professor. By traveling around the world, catching and evolving Pokémon, and defeating other Trainers in battle, the player increases the size and strength of his or her Pokémon collection. A major subplot of each game is to defeat a criminal organization trying to take over the world through the misuse of Pokémon. These organizations include Team Rocket, Team Magma and Team Aqua, Team Galactic, Team Plasma, Team Flare, and Team Skull/Aether Foundation.\n\nVarious facilities can be found throughout the Pokémon world such as Pokémon Centers, Poké Marts, and Gyms. At a Pokémon Center, the player can have their Pokémon healed for free and access the PC, where players can organize their collection of Pokémon, store and withdraw items, and have their Pokédex rated. Prior to \"X\" and \"Y\", this is also where players can link up with other game cartridges or cards to battle or trade with other players. Poké Marts are shops where players can buy items with the money they win during battles; certain cities may have specialized shops, like a pharmacy or a department store. Periodically, a town will contain a Pokémon Gym, which houses a powerful Trainer known as a Gym Leader. Victory against him/her grants the player a Gym Badge and typically advances the plot. After collecting eight Gym Badges, the player may challenge the region's Elite Four and Champion; defeating the Champion finishes the main story. Gyms are absent in \"Sun\" and \"Moon\", being replaced by trials which serve a similar purpose. As the name implies, instead of a straightforward battle, the player undergoes a trial. Upon completion the player receives a Z-crystal, a crystal which grants a Pokémon access to an extremely powerful move.\n\nCompleting the main storyline opens up other features in the games; this is primarily done by allowing passage into otherwise inaccessible places. Afterward, the game remains virtually open-ended, with the ultimate goal of the player being to obtain at least one member of each of the different species of Pokémon, thus completing the Pokédex. With the exception of the first generation and second generation, once all species of regional Pokémon are caught, the player may then update his Pokédex to the National Pokédex, with the new mission of catching all Pokémon from the previous series (aside from several event-exclusive Pokémon such as Jirachi and Volcanion). The number of Pokémon increases with each game generation, starting from 151 in the first generation to 807 as of \"Ultra Sun\" and \"Ultra Moon\".\n\nOne of the reoccurring aspects of the \"Pokémon\" series of role-playing games is the choice of one of three different Pokémon at the start of the player's adventures. These trios are often labeled \"starter Pokémon\". The starter Pokémon, in chronological order of first appearance, are Bulbasaur, Charmander, Squirtle, Chikorita, Cyndaquil, Totodile, Treecko, Torchic, Mudkip, Turtwig, Chimchar, Piplup, Snivy, Tepig, Oshawott, Chespin, Fennekin, Froakie, Rowlet, Litten and Popplio. Players have the option to choose one of three different types of Pokémon: a Grass type, a Fire type, and a Water type, though many starter Pokémon have an additional type or gain one by evolution. These Pokémon are supposedly indigenous to their regions, yet otherwise unattainable except through trading with another game, leading to their rarity. Many games include a rival character, who receives the Pokémon whose type is advantageous against the player's starter Pokémon.\n\nThe exception to this concept is \"Pokémon Yellow\", in which players are given a Pikachu, the Electric-type Mouse Pokémon famously serving as the mascot of the Pokémon media franchise, who walks along behind them. The rival Trainer receives an Eevee, a Normal-type Pokémon. The Eevee will evolve into one of its three different evolved states depending on how well the player fares in battles with the rival in the beginning of the game.\n\n are buildings situated throughout the Pokémon world, where Pokémon Trainers can train or compete to qualify for Pokémon League competitions. Although the internal organizations of Pokémon Gyms may vary, all specialize in one certain type of Pokémon, and all are manned by a , a formidable Trainer that acts as a boss. Pokémon Gyms can be found in most towns and cities in the Pokémon world.\n\nWhen an official Gym Leader is defeated, the challenger wins a , which serves as proof of a Trainer's skill and is a key part of advancing the plot. Victory also earns the challenger a Technical Machine, which allows the player to teach his or her Pokémon a certain move. It also usually enables the player to utilize the overworld effects of one of the various Hidden Machines, such as the ability to cross bodies of water with the move Surf or the ability to remove some trees from paths with the move Cut. As the player collects Gym Badges, the maximum level at which traded Pokémon obey their commands increases.\n\nAfter a player defeats the eight Gym Leaders, he or she can travel through Victory Road, which is often the final route, and then proceed to the Pokémon League and challenge the and the region's Pokémon League . Defeating the Champion is considered to be the goal of the game.\n\nIn \"Sun\", \"Moon\", \"Ultra Sun\", and \"Ultra Moon\", there are no Gyms or Gym Leaders. The player is instead given various \"trials\" by characters known as Trial Captains. Though a similar concept, a trial is not necessarily a battle. A trial usually presents the player with a task that must complete to summon a Totem Pokémon, a more powerful version of a certain species of Pokémon. Once the player has summoned and defeated the Totem Pokémon, they receive a Z-Crystal, an item that allows Pokémon to use extremely powerful moves. Completing all of the trials on an island allows the player to challenge the island's \"kahuna\" in a standard Pokémon battle. The player can challenge the recently built Pokémon League after they have completed all four Grand Trials. After defeating the Elite Four, the player must then defend their title as Alola's First Champion by defeating a challenger.\n\nBattles between Pokémon are the central game mechanic of the \"Pokémon\" games. They are used to train Pokémon to become stronger, as competitions, and to reach certain objectives within the game. Battling can also be done between players by connecting two games.\n\n\"Pokémon\" uses a turn-based system. When the player challenges a Trainer or encounters a wild Pokémon, the screen changes to a battle scene with the player's Pokémon, the opposing Pokémon, their respective HP bars, and an option menu. At any time, the player may carry up to six Pokémon in his or her active party; the first Pokémon in the lineup is automatically sent into battle. At the start of each turn, both sides can choose to attack, use an item, switch the Pokémon for another in their party, or attempt to flee from battle (against a wild Pokémon). If both sides attack, the one who goes first is determined by Speed, although some moves, items, and effects can override this. If either side chooses any other option, that action is performed before the attacks.\n\nEach Pokémon uses moves to reduce their opponent's HP to zero, at which point the Pokémon and is unable to battle. (In the Pokémon world, Pokémon never die as a result of battling.) If the player's Pokémon wins, it receives experience points; when enough have accumulated, the Pokémon's level increases. If the player's Pokémon faints, he/she may use another Pokémon; in battles against wild Pokémon, the player may attempt to flee instead. If all of a player's Pokémon have fainted, the player loses the battle. This causes the player to lose some money and return to the last Pokémon Center he or she visited.\n\n\"Pokémon Ruby\" and \"Sapphire\" introduced , in which the opposing teams battle with two Pokémon at a time. Though the basic mechanics remain the same, moves may have multiple targets, and some affect the ally as well as the opponents. Additionally, some Abilities work only in Double Battles. were also introduced, with four Trainers in teams of two. The third-generation games only included Double Battles against other Trainers, but \"Diamond\" and \"Pearl\" introduced Double Battles with wild Pokémon under certain circumstances.\n\n\"Black\" and \"White\" also introduced Triple Battles and Rotation Battles. In , both teams send out three Pokémon at once, with all three battling simultaneously. In , both sides send out three Pokémon at once, but only use one at a time. The Pokémon which is battling can be switched out with the other two without using up a turn.\n\n\"Pokémon X\" and \"Y\" introduced three new battling mechanics. are performed against hard-to-find Sky Trainers and can only be performed with Flying-type Pokémon or those with the Levitate Ability. These are also stated to be particularly difficult. are battles where five wild Pokémon attack at once, encouraging the use of moves that hit multiple targets to make things easier. are like normal battles, but the entire type chart is inverted. This means that an attack which would normally deal double damage instead deals half damage, and vice versa.\n\n\"Pokémon Sun\" and \"Moon\" also introduce a new battle type, the SOS Battle. In these battles, the opposing Pokémon may call for an allies to assist them, making the battle two-on-one against the player.\n\nIn Pokémon Let’s Go Pikachu and Pokémon Let’s Go Eevee, it appears that if you have two joy cons, a friend can join in and fight with you against trainers. This makes it a Two on One battle against the CPU.\n\nA Pokémon's is an elemental attribute determining the strengths and weaknesses of each Pokémon and its moves. Pokémon take double damage from attacking moves of types they are weak to and half damage from moves they resist. These type matchups offset one another in rock–paper–scissors-style relationships. The game's primary example of this elemental relationship is that between the Grass, Fire, and Water types: a Grass-type Pokémon is weak to Fire but resists Water, Fire is weak to Water but resists Grass, and Water is weak to Grass but resists Fire. Some Pokémon types grant full immunity to certain attack types; for instance, Ghost types take no damage from Normal- or Fighting-type moves. These weaknesses, resistances, and immunities can be combined if a Pokémon has two types. For example, a Ground/Flying-type Pokémon would be immune to Electric moves, as its weakness as a Flying Type is negated by its Ground Type; however, such a Pokémon takes quadruple damage from Ice moves, as both Ground and Flying are weak to Ice. Some Pokémon Abilities can change these interactions, such as Levitate making Pokémon immune to Ground-type moves.\n\nIn the original \"Red\", \"Green\", \"Blue\", and \"Yellow\" games, there are a total of 15 Pokémon types, including all those listed above as examples, as well as Poison, Psychic, Bug, Rock, and Dragon. The Dark and Steel types were added in \"Gold\" and \"Silver\". \"X\" and \"Y\" introduced the Fairy type, bringing the total to 18. Some types have special properties unrelated to the damage chart; for example, Grass-type Pokémon are unaffected by spore- and powder-based status moves, and Electric types are immune to being paralyzed.\n\nThe console RPGs \"Colosseum\" and \"XD\" featured a unique move type known as Shadow, but it does not appear outside these games. Shadow Pokémon can be considered to be of this type, but they still retain their regular typing as well. In \"Pokémon XD\", Shadow moves are super effective against non-Shadow Pokémon and not very effective against Shadow Pokémon.\n\nLike the characters in many role-playing video games, Pokémon are able to learn a wide variety of . These moves may inflict damage, induce status problems, restore health, or perform actions that in some way affect the battle. The general strength of and resistance to these moves are determined by the various statistics a particular Pokémon has. All moves have a type, , accuracy, and number of Power Points (PP). The moves that one Pokémon may learn are different from another depending on the species of Pokémon; even those that evolve from others do not necessarily learn all the same moves that their predecessors learn. Each Pokémon may only know a total of four moves at any one time. Moves may be learned through leveling up, using TMs and HMs, breeding, and move tutors (NPCs that teach moves).\n\nEach move is classified as one of the 18 Pokémon types. The effectiveness of a move is dependent on how susceptible the target Pokémon's type is to the move's type. Phrases associated with this aspect are \"It's super effective!\" (damage is at least doubled), \"It's not very effective…\" (damage is at least halved), and \"It doesn't affect [defending Pokémon]...\" (damage and all effects are negated). A Pokémon with the same type as the move it uses will receive a 50% bonus to its damage, referred to as a \"Same-Type Attack Bonus\" (STAB) in game jargon. Moves are further defined as \"physical\" or \"special\"; physical moves are generally those that would make physical contact, such as punches or bites, while special moves generally involve elemental control, such as breathing fire or manipulating the wind. Prior to the \"Diamond\" and \"Pearl\" games, moves' status of being either physical or special depended on the type, rather than on the individual move. There are also \"status\" moves, which deal no direct damage and often inflict status changes on the defending or attacking Pokémon. Damage-inflicting moves remove a certain number of Health Points from the target Pokémon based on the types of the move and its target, and on the statistics of the two Pokémon. The damage can also be affected by items held by either Pokémon or by their Abilities.\n\nEach move has a specific , which determines the chance of hitting the target Pokémon assuming no changes to user's accuracy or the target's evasiveness. Very powerful moves often have below-average accuracy. Moves with standard 100% accuracy ratings are susceptible to changes in accuracy and evasiveness, but specific never-miss moves such as Aerial Ace bypass both and always land.\n\nThe PP (Power Points) of a move indicate how many times a Pokémon may use that move. As with accuracy, a powerful move is often offset by having a low number of PP. Once a Pokémon uses up all the PP for a certain move, it can no longer use that move. If a Pokémon expends all the PP for all of its moves, it then resorts to a move called Struggle, which damages the user as well as the target. Depleted PP can be restored by using certain items or by visiting a Pokémon Center.\n\nMany moves have effects beyond inflicting damage. A common secondary effects is a chance to induce a certain on the target: , , , , or ; each negatively affects how the afflicted Pokémon performs in battle. For example, many Electric-type moves have small chances of Paralyzing the target. Some moves have negative side-effects for the user, such as forcing the player to wait a turn before or after use, or causing recoil damage. A few moves, such as Splash, deal no damage and have no effect whatsoever except when used as a Z-Move.\n\nOnce per battle, if a Pokémon holds a Z-Crystal, it can use an upgraded version of one of its moves. This upgraded move is called a Z-Move. Z-Moves based on attacking moves tend to have much higher power than normal; those based on status moves usually incur a benefit on the user before executing the move. The player cannot execute more than one Z-Move per battle.\n\nCertain moves can also be used in the overworld in order to bypass obstacles (e.g. small trees), quickly travel between previously-visited locations, escape dungeons, or heal Pokémon. Usually, Pokémon will learn these moves with the use of the HM items and will be able to use them in the aforementioned ways after certain Badges are obtained.\n\nPokémon are special attributes which were introduced in \"Pokémon Ruby\" and \"Sapphire\". Specific species of Pokémon have one to three possible Abilities, with individual Pokémon exhibiting one Ability each. Unlike the moves a Pokémon knows, its Ability cannot normally change (except sometimes during evolution, and by using the rare item Ability Capsule, which was introduced in \"Pokémon X\" and \"Y\").\n\nMost Pokémon use their Abilities in battle. Abilities can strengthen a Pokémon's own statistics or weaken a foe, inflict status effects such as paralysis or poisoning, or perform other effects. For instance, a Bulbasaur uses its Overgrow Ability to power up its Grass-Type attacks when it has low HP, and when Arbok is sent into battle, it will use its Intimidate Ability to lower the opposing Pokémon's Attack statistic. Some Abilities also grant immunities or resistances, such as Lapras's Water Absorb restoring its own HP when hit by Water-type attacks. Not all Abilities are helpful and may be implemented to hinder a Pokémon. For example, Slaking, which would otherwise be extraordinarily powerful, has the Truant Ability, which only allows it to attack every other turn.\n\nSome Abilities have effects outside of Pokémon battles. For example, Pokémon with the Pickup Ability, like Meowth, will sometimes retrieve items off the ground. A Pokémon with the Ability Intimidate, mentioned above, will cause the player to encounter lower-level wild Pokémon less often.\n\n\"Pokémon Black\" and \"White\" introduced Hidden Abilities, which initially could only be found on Pokémon primarily acquired from the Internet-based Pokémon Global Link, either through the Pokémon Dream World feature or through promotional releases. There are also rare instances of Pokémon with their Hidden Abilities available in the main game, either as a special encounter or as an in-game Trade with an NPC. \"Black 2\" and \"White 2\" introduced the game mechanic of , areas where the player has a chance to find a Pokémon that has its Hidden Ability. Subsequent games introduced more means of obtaining Pokémon with Hidden Abilities; for instance, Pokémon encountered in Horde Battles have a small chance of having their Hidden Ability.\n\nAll Pokémon have six (colloquially called \"stats\") which affect their performance in battle. These are HP, Attack, Defense, Special Attack, Special Defense, and Speed. These statistics can be temporarily modified during battle by Abilities, items, and moves.\n\nThere are also two other statistics, and , which are not affected when Pokémon level up. No Pokémon has innately higher Accuracy or Evasiveness than any other, but they can be modified during battle like other statistics. Increasing Accuracy makes a move more likely to hit, while increasing Evasiveness makes the opponent's move more likely to miss. A Pokémon's Accuracy, the opponent's Evasiveness, and the accuracy value of a given move affect the probability that the move will hit. Evasiveness was called \"Evade\" in the first generation and \"Evasion\" in the second.\n\nIn \"Pokémon Red\", \"Blue\", and \"Yellow\", the Special Attack and the Special Defense stat were a single stat, named the \"Special\" stat, which determined both power with and resistance against special attacks.\n\nWhen Pokémon level up, their statistics increase, as determined by the Pokémon's base stat values, effort values, Pokémon Nature, and individual values. These variables working in tandem provide each individual Pokémon with its own unique stats.\n\n, known officially as species strengths, determine the natural statistical strengths of the various Pokémon species. Every species is assigned a number in each stat; the higher the number, the higher the stat can potentially be. While these values may greatly vary between species, they are the same for each member of that species. It is the difference among species which explains why all Aerodactyl will have a higher Speed than any Snorlax of the same level; however, it is the combination of other factors that causes some Snorlax to be faster than others. Adding up all the base stat values for a certain species generates the base stat total, which players use to determine approximately how strong that species is.\n\n are hidden values that affect the strengths of a Pokémon in particular statistical areas. Differing effort value levels between two Pokémon can create a significant difference in the two Pokémon's statistical strengths. When a Pokémon battles and defeats an opponent, they gain experience points, also known as EXP, and also receive a number and type of EVs according to the defeated Pokémon's species. Every defeated Pokémon gives at least one EV to each of the Pokémon that fought it. Certain factors, like holding the Macho Brace item, can increase the rate at which EVs are gained in battle. In \"Pokémon Gold\" and \"Silver\", a condition known as was introduced that has a small chance of appearing on a player's Pokémon after a battle with a wild Pokémon. Pokérus doubles the rate at which EVs are obtained permanently, and will be contagious for a certain number of days, allowing it to spread to the player's other Pokémon. In addition, consuming certain items can increase a Pokémon's EVs, and certain Berries decrease EVs while increasing a Pokémon's friendship value. There is a limit on the number of EVs Pokémon can have, both for each individual stats and combined across all stats, which prevents stats from increasing indefinitely. The total limit allows for maximum Effort Values in two stats simultaneously.\n\nIn the first- and second-generation games, a similar system usually referred to Stat Experience or Stat Exp. was used. As with Effort Values, there is a limit to how much Stat Exp. a Pokémon can have in each stat; however, unlike Effort Values, there is no limit to the total Stat Exp. a Pokémon can have across all stats, meaning that a Pokémon can have maximum Stat Exp. in every stat. Also of note is that, in order for Pokémon from the first generation (where there was only one Special stat) and the second generation (where there are both Special Attack and Special Defense stats) to be forward and backward compatible for trading, Stat Exp. was not tracked separately for Special Attack and Special Defense in the second generation games. Instead, the Special Stat Exp. value was used to calculate both Special Attack and Special Defense.\n\nIn \"Pokémon X\" and \"Y\", a minigame known as is introduced that allows players to more accurately manage the effort values. The player can do this by playing a soccer-like minigame, which also rewards the player with training bags to continue the training passively. The Pokémon's effort values can also be viewed in the Super Training interface, which includes an \"Effort-o-Meter\" to allow the player to see the maximum capability of increasing the Pokémon's effort values.\n\nIn \"Pokémon Sun\" and \"Moon\", a graph of a Pokémon's EVs along with its base stats can be seen by pressing the Y button while viewing the summary of a Pokémon. A sparkling stat shows that the Pokémon had obtained the maximum number of EVs for the stat. Pokémon can gain EVs passively through a feature called \"Poké Pelago\".\n\nPokémon were first introduced in \"Pokémon Ruby\" and \"Sapphire\". Each Pokémon has a Nature, randomly assigned when it is generated, which cannot be changed. A Pokémon's Nature affects the rate at which some of its stats increase: out of the twenty-five possible Natures, twenty will increase one stat's growth rate but decrease another's. The other five modify the same stat in both increases and decreases, and thus the Pokémon's overall growth is unaffected. Natures also determine which flavor of Pokéblocks or Poffins that Pokémon likes and dislikes.\n\n or IVs are a hidden value for each statistic which determine a Pokémon's maximum potential. These values are randomly generated along with each Pokémon when it is encountered or bred, and set in stone for the rest of the game. These hidden values are why even Pokémon that seem identical and have been raised the same way may have different stats. IVs range from 0 to 31, and their Generations I and II predecessors, \"determinant values\", ranged from 0 to 15.\n\nItems can be found in the world, given to the player by NPCs, or bought at shops for in-game currency.\n\nMany items received in the game are used to heal Pokémon during and outside of battles, much like a Pokémon Center does. Potions and drinks restore HP. A range of items cure various status conditions, such as Antidotes for poisoning and Awakenings for sleep. Revives restore a Pokémon back to health after it has lost all of its HP. Ethers and Elixirs restore the PP of a Pokémon's moves to varying degrees.\n\n and , commonly abbreviated as TMs and HMs, can be used to teach moves to Pokémon, including some moves that they would otherwise not learn by increasing in level. TMs are commonly found in the field, in shops, and as rewards for defeating a Gym Leader. Up until the fifth generation, a TM could only be used once. HMs are more rare, but can be used as many times as desired. HMs are often vital to game progression as they have important effects outside of battle, allowing the player to traverse certain obstacles. For example, Pokémon who learn the HM move Surf can transport the protagonist over water, which is necessary to reach island locations. These effects are usually accessible only after defeating a particular Gym Leader. When a Pokémon learns an HM move, the move cannot be deleted or replaced unless the player uses the services of an NPC known as the Move Deleter. Some Pokémon can learn TMs or HMS that their pre-evolutions or evolutions can't. Two prime examples are Kirlia, who can learn Dazzling Gleam and Swords Dance, with both of its evolutions learning one but not the other; and Gyarados, who can learn Surf when its pre-evolution can't.\n\nKey items are rarer than regular items and are usually given to the player rather than found. These include fishing rods which are used to find water-dwelling Pokémon, a bicycle which allows the protagonist to move around faster, a dowsing machine, and keys which open locked doors leading to important areas. These items cannot be thrown away, sold, or given to a Pokémon.\n\nStarting with \"Pokémon Gold\" and \"Silver\", each Pokémon is able to hold a single item. Items carried by Pokémon can have a range of effects. Some, like Berries, are consumed after one use and boost HP or stats. Others persistently boost move power, defense, Speed, and more. Just like moves, some items hinder the user to compensate their power; for instance, the Life Orb boosts the damage of all of the holder's attacks, but hurts it after each successful attack. Others items solely harm the user except in rare situations, such as the Toxic Orb which badly poisons it. Pokémon \"X\" and \"Y\" introduced Mega Stones used to Mega Evolve members of the stone's species, and \"Sun\" and \"Moon\" introduced Z-Crystals, which give the holder access to an especially powerful once-per-battle Z-Move depending on the crystal's relevant base move. Items like the Razor Claw and Razor Fang evolve a Pokémon when held while a condition is met. Most items, including Poké Balls and Potions, can be \"held\" but have no effect on their own when held. Items can be moved between, removed from, and neutralized on Pokemon through moves like Trick, Knock Off, and Embargo respectively, or consumed to damage the opponent through the attacks Fling and Natural Gift. Some items, such as Hidden Machines and Key Items, cannot be held.\n\nBecause each player begins the game with only one starter Pokémon, catching is one of the most fundamental aspects of Pokémon, and the primary method of recruiting new Pokémon to the player's party.\n\nIn a battle against a wild Pokémon, the player may, instead of defeating it, attempt to catch it by using one of many different types of Poké Balls. The odds of success vary, but are increased if the target Pokémon's HP is low, if the target is affected by a status-altering effect like sleep or paralysis, and if a stronger or specially-suited Poké Ball is used.\n\nIf the catch is successful, the caught Pokémon's data is added to the Pokédex, the player may give the Pokémon a nickname, and the Pokémon is added to the player's party. However, if the player's party is filled to its maximum of six Pokémon, the caught Pokémon is instead sent to a storage box accessible at Pokémon Centers. In the first- and second-generation games, if the current PC box is full, the player will be unable to catch any new Pokémon until he or she accesses a PC and switches to a different box. In more recent games, new Pokémon are automatically transferred to the next available box.\n\nThe is a spherical device used by Pokémon Trainers to catch wild Pokémon and store them in the player's inventory when not active. Upon contact, the balls draw a Pokémon inside and then close automatically. Wild Pokémon are able to resist and break free; however, weakened Pokémon and those with status conditions are less able to struggle and therefore more easily caught. Legendary Pokémon are much more capable of resisting being caught, and will often require many Poké Balls or more powerful Poké Balls in order to catch them. If the player attempts to catch a non-player character's Pokémon, the opponent will block the Ball to prevent its theft.\n\nAs depicted in the anime and manga series, the Poké Ball, when not in use, is the size of a golf ball and, with a press of the central button, enlarges to the size of a baseball. The Pokémon is released for battle by throwing the ball; when retrieving a Pokémon, a beam of red light converts the Pokémon into energy to reclaim it. Poké Balls are explained as being incredibly comfortable for Pokémon, so much that they would willingly enter one without any sort of encouragement. The Pokémon Voltorb, Electrode, Foongus, and Amoonguss are often mistaken for Poké Balls, due to their shape and color schemes which highly resemble Poké Balls.\n\nVarious types of Poké Balls exist. Introduced in \"Pokémon Red\" and \"Blue\", are, in order of progressing strength, the Poké Ball, , , and the . The Master Ball always succeeds against any Pokémon that can be caught, and of which typically only one is available in the game. In \"Pokémon Gold\", \"Silver\", \"Crystal\", \"HeartGold\" and \"SoulSilver\", there are fruits called Apricorns, which, when given to Kurt in Azalea Town, make one of seven special types of Poké Balls, depending on the Apricorn's color. The seven kinds of Poké Balls Kurt can make (and the seven color Apricorns they are made out of) are Level (Red), Moon (Yellow), Lure (Blue), Friend (Green), Love (Pink), Fast (White), and Heavy (Black). Beginning in \"Pokémon Ruby\", \"Sapphire\", and \"Emerald\", other specialized balls appear, including the Timer Ball, which becomes more effective as the number of turns in the current battle rises, and the Net Ball, which has a better chance of catching Water and Bug-type Pokémon, among others. In addition, in several games there exists an area called the Safari Zone in which only Safari Balls can be used; these cannot be obtained or used elsewhere in the game. \"Pokémon Sun and Moon\" introduced the Beast Ball, which is designed for capturing Ultra Beasts and is much more effective at capturing them than standard Poké Balls. There is also a special kind of Poké Ball known as the Cherish Ball; Pokémon in Cherish Balls can only be obtained through special distribution events.\n\nIn the Nintendo GameCube RPGs, \"Pokémon Colosseum\" and \"\", the player is able to catch non-player characters' Pokémon through the use of the Snag Machine, which turns Poké Balls into Snag Balls. Snag Balls are capable of catching any Pokémon (with the same strength limitations as the standard Poké, Great, Ultra, and Master Balls), and they are developed by the antagonists to steal Pokémon where they are not common in the wild. Snag Balls can also be used by the player to catch the specific Shadow Pokémon who have been tainted by the antagonist group and that the player is required to purify for game completion.\n\nPoké Balls have appeared in every installment of the \"Super Smash Bros.\" series, releasing a Pokémon to assist the player who grabbed it. \"Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U\" also introduces the Master Ball, which almost always releases a legendary Pokémon, with a small chance of releasing Goldeen instead.\n\nUGO.com listed the Poké Ball eighteenth on their list of \"Our 50 Favorite Video Game Power-ups\" citing how everybody runs to get it in the Super Smash Bros. series.\n\nThe is an electronic device designed to catalog and provide information regarding the various species of Pokémon. The name \"Pokédex\" is a portmanteau of \"Pokémon \" and \"index\". In the video games, whenever a Pokémon is first caught, its height, weight, species type, and a short description will be added to a player's Pokédex. Each region has its own Pokédex, which differ in appearance, species of Pokémon catalogued, and functions such as the ability to sort the list of Pokémon based on alphabetical order or display the Pokémon's size compared to the player character. The \"National Pokédex\" allows Pokémon from all regions to be catalogued. The Nintendo 3DS application \"Pokédex 3D Pro\" features all of the Pokémon with all of its forms and each one has its own animation.\n\n is a sudden change in form of a Pokémon, more akin to a metamorphosis than actual evolution, and is usually accompanied by an increase in stat values. There are several different conditions which can trigger evolution in different species; the most common is gaining enough battle experience. There are many other factors that can determine if, when, and into what, different Pokémon will evolve. The original alternate methods were the use of items called evolutionary stones or by trading the Pokémon to another player. Later additions to the pool of conditions for evolution include dependence on the Pokémon's friendship, the time of day in the game, carrying a unique item while being traded, the gender, the area in the game where the Pokémon levels up, having a separate specific Pokémon in the player's party, trading for a specific Pokémon, knowing a certain move, or holding the game console upside down.\n\nThe player can choose to halt evolution at any time before the animation is finished by simply by pressing the B button, unless the evolution was intentionally initiated by using an evolutionary stone on the Pokémon. Pokémon whose evolutions are canceled will attempt to evolve again after the condition for evolution is met again. Preventing evolution for a time can be useful, as many Pokémon learn moves sooner in their unevolved form than in their evolved form.\n\nThe \"Pokémon Trading Card Game\" introduced the idea of numerical stages for referring to different points in a Pokémon's evolution. This has translated into colloquial usage among fans of the games. All Pokémon can be placed at one of four evolutionary stages (though no existing Pokémon line includes more than three out of the four stages): Basic Pokémon, Stage 1 Pokémon which evolve from Basic Pokémon, Stage 2 Pokémon which evolve from Stage 1 Pokémon, and Baby Pokémon which are acquired by breeding certain Basic or Stage 1 Pokémon and hatching their Eggs. A Pokémon higher up on this evolutionary scale is sometimes called an evolved form of the previous stages; likewise, a Pokémon lower down on the scale is said to be a pre-evolved form of later Pokémon in the chain.\n\nThis is the most common method of evolution across all Pokémon generations, and involves Pokémon acquiring experience points through battling other Pokémon. For example, Caterpie evolves into Metapod when it reaches any level at or above 7, and Metapod evolves into Butterfree at or above level 10.\n\nEvolutionary stones are items which can be found throughout the games. Some Pokémon can have particular evolutionary stones used on them, and doing so will cause the Pokémon to evolve. Initially five evolutionary stones were introduced into the game, the Water, Thunder, Leaf, Moon and Fire stones. Later generations introduced more kinds, bringing the total to ten in Generation VII.\n\nSome Pokémon, like Machoke and Kadabra, evolve when traded between players. Additional evolutionary requirements can also exist; for instance, Seadra evolves into Kingdra only if it holds a Dragon Scale when traded, and Shelmet and Karrablast only evolve when traded for each other.\n\nA Pokémon's is an attribute that can rise or fall based upon several conditions and events. This aspect, introduced in \"Pokémon Yellow\", was what determined Pikachu's stat growth and affected the outcome of certain NPC events (such as receiving Bulbasaur in Cerulean City). In \"Pokémon Gold\" and \"Silver\" it is a means to evolve several Pokémon. When Pokémon like Chansey or Golbat level up and have very high Friendship, they will evolve.\n\nIn addition to its use in certain evolutions, there are two moves base their power on the Pokémon's friendship value—Return and Frustration.\n\nIn \"Pokémon X\" and \"Y\", a feature known as was introduced; in \"Sun\", \"Moon\", \"Ultra Sun\", and \"Ultra Moon\", the feature is known as Pokémon Refresh. It allows players to more directly interact with and care for Pokémon in a manner similar to some digital pet games. This minigame utilizes the touchscreen to allow players to pet their Pokémon and feed them sweets to raise their affection value. In battle, Pokémon with high Affection may turn to their Trainer to await orders and express emotions. Additionally, they can receive certain benefits such as an increased chance to land critical hits if their affection has reached a high enough value. Eevee must have high affection and must know a Fairy-type move to evolve into Sylveon.\n\n is a mechanic introduced in \"Pokémon X\" and \"Y\", which further increases the abilities of specific Pokémon. If the player character possesses an item called the , and a Pokémon is holding a that corresponds to its species with the exception of Rayquaza, which only needs the move Dragon Ascent and must not be holding a Z-Crystal, that Pokémon will be able to Mega Evolve during battle. The player cannot perform more than one Mega Evolution per battle. Only some Pokémon species have corresponding Mega Stones, so only those Pokémon are capable of Mega Evolution. Unlike normal evolution, this transformation is temporary, and the Pokémon will revert to its normal form after the battle. Mega Evolved Pokémon have higher stats than their normal forms, and may also have a different type or Ability. Mewtwo was the first known example of a Pokémon capable of Mega Evolution, with Mega Mewtwo Y appearing in a special episode of the television series and the film \"\". Two Pokémon, Charizard and Mewtwo, have multiple Mega Evolved forms, and the one they can Mega Evolve into is dependent on which Mega Stone they hold; for instance, if Mewtwo holds a Mewtwonite Y, it will Mega Evolve into Mega Mewtwo Y.\n\n is a mechanic introduced in \"Pokémon Omega Ruby\" and \"Alpha Sapphire\". Only two Pokémon, Groudon and Kyogre, are capable of Primal Reversion. These Pokémon will undergo Primal Reversion automatically if they hold the Red Orb or Blue Orb (respectively) when sent into battle. Like Mega Evolution, Primal Reversion increases the Pokémon's stats and changes their Abilities; however, Primal Reversion has been called the reverse of Mega Evolution, since the Pokémon reverts to its older, primal form, rather than a more advanced form. Unlike Mega Evolution, Primal Reversion can be performed more than once per battle.\n\nBond Phenomenon (キズナ現象 \"Bond Phenomenon\") is a mechanic that debuted in the anime's \"XY series\" and was introduced into the core series games in \"Pokémon Sun and Moon\". The only Pokémon capable of this transformation is Greninja with the Battle Bond Ability. Greninja will undergo a transformation into Ash-Greninja if it knocks out a Pokémon during battle, giving it an appearance similar to Ash Ketchum, increased stats, and a stronger Water Shuriken. Unlike Mega Evolution, Primal Reversion, and Ultra Burst, Bond Phenomenon does not require a corresponding item.\n\nUltra Burst (ウルトラバースト \"Ultra Burst\") is a mechanic introduced in \"Pokémon Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon\". Only Necrozma in either its Dusk Mane or Dawn Wings form is capable of Ultra Burst. Necrozma may undergo Ultra Burst when it is holding the Ultranecrozium Z Z-Crystal, which will allow it to transform into Ultra Necrozma. Then, if it knows Photon Geyser, will be able to use the Z-Move Light that Burns the Sky on the next turn. Like Mega Evolution, Bond Phenomenon, and Primal Reversion, Ultra Burst increases Necrozma's stats and is a temporary transformation.\n\n is a term of art. A Legendary Pokémon is not simply an individual Pokémon about which legends are written; rather, a species is considered Legendary if it has been designated as such by The Pokémon Company. Since the \"Gold\" and \"Silver\" versions of the games (with the exception of \"FireRed\" and \"LeafGreen\"), the main series' game package features one Legendary Pokémon, usually the Pokémon most involved in the main storyline of that game. In most cases, Legendary Pokémon are exceptionally powerful, difficult to catch, and unable to evolve (with the exception of the and Cosmog evolutionary lines), and no known Legendary Pokémon is capable of breeding. Certain Legendary Pokémon colloquially termed \"runners\" or \"roaming Pokémon\" randomly move around the world map and flee from battle, making them even harder to obtain.\n\n is a separate group of Pokémon. The term is commonly associated with Pokémon that cannot be obtained through standard gameplay, requiring an external mechanic to obtain them; however, some Mythical Pokémon have been made obtainable in later releases. These Pokémon are usually placed at the end of their respective games' Pokédex and can only be obtained through distribution events set up by Nintendo. The first of these Mythical Pokémon was Mew, who was programmed into the \"Red\" and \"Green\" games as a secret character by Shigeki Morimoto without any knowledge of the other members of the development team, and was not announced until several months after the games' release in a special promotion. Since then, the games have continued to feature Pokémon that cannot be obtained through standard gameplay, but the programming that allow the player to catch them within the games can be activated by special items (or other Pokémon) distributed by Nintendo. The first of these such items was the GS Ball in \"Crystal\", which was distributed to players in Japan through the mobile phone connector, allowing them to encounter Celebi. Like Legendary Pokémon, Mythical Pokémon are generally extremely powerful and difficult to catch, are usually not part of an evolutionary line (with the exception of Meltan and Melmetal), and cannot breed (with the exception of Manaphy).\n\nShiny Pokémon were first introduced in \"Gold\" and \"Silver\" as a way to demonstrate the new color-capabilities of the Game Boy Color system. These are Pokémon which have a different coloration than normal; in earlier games, this was done by means of a palette swap. Encountering a Shiny Pokémon is extremely rare; the probability under normal conditions is 1 in 8,192 (1 in 4,096 from the sixth generation onwards). There are some major exceptions to this rule, such as the red Gyarados present in \"Pokémon Gold\", \"Silver\", \"Crystal\", \"HeartGold\", and \"SoulSilver\", and the black Haxorus, the blue/yellow Gible, and the pink Dratini present in \"Pokémon Black 2\" and \"White 2\". \n\nThere are various ways of increasing the chance of getting a Shiny Pokémon. In second-generation games, breeding a Shiny Pokémon with a regular Pokémon has a higher chance (1 in 64) of producing a Shiny Pokémon. In \"Diamond\", \"Pearl\", \"Platinum\", \"X\", and \"Y\", the Poké Radar can be used to \"chain\" Pokémon of the same species, improving the odds of a Shiny Pokémon with each link (up to 40 links, when the odds are 1 in 200). Since Generation IV, breeding Pokémon that originated in games of two different languages results in Eggs with a 1 in 1,638 (Generation IV games) or 1 in 1365 (Black and White onwards) chance to contain a Shiny Pokémon; this method of increasing odds has been dubbed the \"Masuda method\" after developer Junichi Masuda. Additionally, an item introduced in \"Black 2\" and \"White 2\" called the Shiny Charm increases the probability of finding Shiny Pokémon. However, this item is only accessible long after completing the game, as the player must have completed the National Pokédex (excluding Mythical Pokémon). Beginning in \"Black\" and \"White\", certain Pokémon in each game are 'Shiny-locked', meaning the player cannot obtain a Shiny variant of these Pokémon in normal gameplay.\n\nPokémon \"Sun\" and \"Moon\"'s SOS Battle mechanic created a new way to \"hunt\" for Shiny Pokemon. If a wild Pokemon calls allies to help (requiring the Adrenaline Orb in the games' sequels) and the ally is continually of the same species in a \"chain\", the chance that it calls a Shiny Pokemon rises up to a base of 13 in 4096 after the 30th is called, as do the chances of Hidden Ability and perfect IVs, though they are capped at four perfect IVs maximum. In their sequels' Ultra Warp Ride minigame, by successfully traveling more light-years through the wormhole on Lunala (Ultra Sun) or Solgaleo (Ultra Moon) and entering wormholes with more rings, the player can increase the chance of finding Shiny Pokemon in the Ultra Space Wilds. Generation 7 also introduced an upgrade to the \"Masuda method\" referred to as \"Swap Breeding\"; the game is continually saved and soft-reset until a fast-hatching, dummy Pokemon (such as Magikarp) is hatched shiny within the first thirty attempts, and shininess (among other values) is transplanted to the new Pokemon hatched in the same position as the dummy was.\n\nIn \"Gold\", \"Silver\", and \"Crystal\", they have slightly above-average stats, but this is because Pokémon's Shininess is determined by their determinant values in those games. In the third generation and onward, however, Shininess is determined by another value, and Shiny Pokémon are not stronger than any other Pokémon in battle. Most fans consider Shiny Pokémon to be collectors' items because of their rarity.\n\nThe term \"Shiny\" was initially a term invented by the \"Pokémon\" fan community due to the flash of stars that appear when such a Pokémon enters a battle, implying a sheen or crystalline property to the colors of the Pokémon. The term \"Shiny Pokémon\" was later officially acknowledged in \"Pokémon Black\" and \"White\", but it has been used in the anime and in a few strategy guides before this. The term was also a widely used slang term in Japan; Ken Sugimori uses \"hikaru\" in the title of a piece of artwork featuring a Shiny Charizard. The alternate term appears among the options the player can choose when filling out forms in the third generation of games.\n\nShiny Pokémon have appeared in the anime, including the aforementioned red Gyarados and a Noctowl that protagonist Ash Ketchum catches and is then featured throughout several seasons. A pink Butterfree was also featured in an episode of the first season of the anime, but this alternate coloration is not what appears in the subsequent video games where the Shiny feature has been implemented.\n\nPlayers have the ability to trade their Pokémon with one another by connecting two compatible games. Trading is an important aspect to the \"Pokémon\" games, being the crux upon which much of the franchise is based. This is because the slogan, and consequently the goal, \"Gotta catch 'em All,\" is logistically impossible without trading. Each game released in a generation has certain Pokémon that are exclusive to that version. For example, in \"Pokémon Red\" players can catch the Pokémon Ekans and its evolved form, Arbok, while both are absent in the wild in both \"Pokémon Blue\" and \"Pokémon Yellow\". Other Pokémon are only available when offered up as a choice. The most obvious example is the choice between three starter Pokémon at the beginning of the game; the only way to get the other two is by trading. Some NPCs offer to trade Pokémon with the player, allowing them to acquire Pokémon otherwise unavailable without connecting to another game. For example, the only way to get a Jynx in \"Pokémon Red\" and \"Blue\" (other than trading with another game cartridge) is through an in-game trade. The other way that trading is made instrumental in gameplay is that some Pokémon, like Haunter and Machoke, only evolve into their final forms when traded.\n\nTrading between games on the Game Boy and related systems is accomplished through a Game Link cable that attaches to ports found on all Game Boy incarnations. The size of the ports varies between consoles, so several hybrid cables have been created that allow, for example, linking between the original Game Boy and the Game Boy Color. \"Pokémon FireRed\" and \"LeafGreen\" include a special wireless dongle which plugs into the game link port for local wireless communication. On the Nintendo DS, DS Wireless Communications is used instead. \"Diamond\" and \"Pearl\" also introduced the Global Trade Station/System (or GTS), a place where people all around the world may trade Pokémon using the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection. In the GTS hall, the player can input their own location and pinpoint the locations of other players they have interacted with. The Nintendo WFC records this data when they trade successfully with someone over the GTS or in their Pal Pad. For the Nintendo 3DS line, two successors to the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection were implemented in each generation. In the Player Search System in \"Pokémon X & Y\" and \"Pokémon Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire\", the function is simply called Trade, while in \"Sun\", \"Moon\", \"Ultra Sun\", and \"Ultra Moon\" in the Festival Plaza, the function is called Link Trade. The second successor is called Wonder Trade; players choose a Pokémon to trade and are randomly paired with another player around the world.\n\nMystery Gift, a means by which players can receive items from other people, was introduced in \"Pokémon Gold\" and \"Silver\" and has appeared in every handheld \"Pokémon\" game since. To use Mystery Gift, the feature must first be activated in a specific way.\n\nIn \"Gold\", \"Silver\", and \"Crystal\", if two players line up the infrared ports on their Game Boy Color units and activate Mystery Gift from the intro menu, each will receive an item. This process also sends a record of each player's party Pokémon to the other player's game for a daily event in Viridian City in which they can battle the other player's Pokémon (controlled by the computer). Players can use Mystery Gift an unlimited number of times, but only once per day for each person. In addition, a player of \"Pokémon Stadium 2\" with a \"Gold\", \"Silver\", or \"Crystal\" cartridge plugged into the Transfer Pak can use Mystery Gift with a girl in White City. A Mystery Gift can also be received by connecting with a Pocket Pikachu 2 GS.\n\nIn \"Ruby\" and \"Sapphire\", Mystery Gift is replaced with Mystery Event. This feature utilizes the now defunct e-Reader accessory. Using special e-cards, the player could obtain special items such as rare Berries or the Eon Ticket. In \"FireRed\", \"LeafGreen\", and \"Emerald\", Mystery Gift is a means to obtain special items at Nintendo's promotional events through the use of the Wireless Adapter, which allow the player to catch otherwise unobtainable Pokémon, such as Mew and Deoxys.\n\n\"Pokémon Diamond\" and \"Pearl\" expanded Mystery Gift to include a variety of transferring options. After enabling Mystery Gift, players may obtain items via wireless or Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection, and may also transfer them to friends. Wireless connection also allows the player to transfer items from \"Pokémon Battle Revolution\". Currently, Mystery Gift via Nintendo WFC has only been implemented in \"Pokémon Platinum\" and \"Pokémon HeartGold\" and \"SoulSilver\". However, this was changed when the shiny Pichu was distributed to all version games via WFC. Also, with the creation of the Pokéwalker, in \"Pokémon HeartGold\" and \"SoulSilver\", came another way to Mystery Gift. By pressing the connect button on two Pokéwalkers and pointing them at each other, both Pokéwalkers will receive an item, which the player will receive upon connecting with his or her game. Beginning with \"Pokémon X and Y\", an option to receive Mystery Gifts by single-use serial code or password over Nintendo Network was added. Single-use codes are given out in participating retailers and via the Pokémon Global Link and are usually region locked. Wireless and infrared events are no longer region locked, allowing any region console to receive events distributed by those methods.\n\n is an application which allows players to store up to 3,000 Pokémon in an online cloud storage service. Players can deposit and withdraw Pokémon from both physical and downloaded versions of compatible games, allowing players to exchange Pokémon between the two versions without the need for a second system. Additionally, an application called allows players to upload Pokémon from \"Pokémon Black\", \"White\", \"Black 2\", and \"White 2\" to the Pokémon Bank, after which they can be imported into newer games. The service requires an annual fee, and there are plans to continue to utilize it for future Pokémon titles.\n\nIntended for release on December 27, 2013, Pokémon Bank was postponed due to unforeseen traffic levels on the Nintendo Network service. Pokémon Bank was fully released on the Nintendo eShop on January 22, 2014 in Japan, February 4, 2014 in Europe, and February 5, 2014 in North America.\n\nAs of an update released on January 24, 2016, \"Pokémon Sun\" and \"Moon\" have also gained compatibility with Pokémon Bank. The update allows players to send their Pokémon from their core sixth generation games to \"Sun\" and \"Moon\", though when transferred, they cannot return to the older games. Additionally, the Poké Transporter was also updated to allow players to transfer Pokémon caught in the Virtual Console editions of \"Pokémon Red\", \"Blue\", and \"Yellow\" to \"Pokémon Sun\" and \"Moon\". The update also added a new in-app National Pokédex, presumably to make up for the lack of one in Sun and Moon.\n\nOn November 17, 2017, coinciding with the release of \"Ultra Sun\" and \"Ultra Moon\", it was announced that the games would support \"Pokémon Bank\" later the same month. The update, which came three days later, also added compatibility with the Virtual Console versions of \"Pokémon Gold and Silver\" as well as \"Crystal\" (which was not re-released until January 26, 2018) to the Poké Transporter.\n\nPokémon breeding was introduced in \"Pokémon Gold\" and \"Silver\". Pokémon can be bred in-game at a . These are businesses generally run by an elderly person or couple, which raise Trainers' Pokémon for a fee. If two compatible Pokémon are left there, they will eventually produce a Pokémon , which the Trainer can pick up for free. After being carried by the Trainer for some distance, the Egg will hatch into a young Pokémon, usually of the lowest stage in its mother's evolutionary line.\n\nSome Pokémon have pre-evolutions that are usually only obtainable by hatching them from Eggs. Known as \"baby Pokémon\", these Pokémon are unable to breed but have evolutions that can breed baby Pokémon. For most baby Pokémon introduced after \"Gold\" and \"Silver\", the parent can only produce these Pokémon when holding a certain item.\n\nCompatibility is usually restricted to one male and one female. In addition, Pokémon species are assigned to , which determines their breeding compatibility with other species. Pokémon may belong to up to two Egg Groups; in order to breed, they must share at least one Egg Group. Nearly all Pokémon species, even those that are all-male or genderless, are able to breed with the shape-shifting Pokémon Ditto. The Egg produced will yield a hatchling from the non-Ditto Pokémon's evolutionary line. Two Ditto cannot breed to produce another Ditto.\n\nA select group of species cannot breed at all, which includes all Legendary Pokémon, all Ultra Beasts, most Mythical Pokémon, Nidorina and Nidoqueen (but not Nidoran♀), Unown, and all \"baby\" Pokémon. This is called the \"Undiscovered\" Egg Group. Although some Legendary Pokémon (such as Heatran and Cresselia) have genders, they still cannot breed. An unusual circumstance involves the relation of the Mythical Pokémon Manaphy and Phione; both can breed with Ditto to create an Egg which hatches into Phione, yet Phione does not evolve into Manaphy. Manaphy itself is obtained from an Egg from \"Pokémon Ranger\" games, but it will never breed to produce another Manaphy Egg.\n\nPokémon hatched from Eggs can stats from their parents. Three of the Pokémon's individual values are inherited from one or the other of its parents, and the other three IVs are generated randomly.\n\nMoves can also be inherited through breeding. Moves that a newly hatched Pokémon begins with are divided into three categories: learned moves, inherited moves, and hereditary moves or \"Egg Moves\". Learned moves are moves that the Pokémon would have naturally at its starting level; inherited moves are those that the Pokémon would be able to learn at later levels or through TMs; and , inherited from the father (or either parent beginning in \"Pokémon X\" and \"Y\"), are those that the Pokémon would not be able to learn normally. The Pokémon can learn the move on this occasion as it receives the move from a parent of a different species. Upon birth, the young Pokémon's move slots are filled with learned moves. However, if there are any inherited moves or Egg Moves available for the Pokémon to learn, they replace the learned moves.\n\nIn addition to the Pokémon Gyms and other battles to advance the plot, side games and post-game areas have been introduced in subsequent editions of the \"Pokémon\" games that extend the gameplay.\n\nFirst introduced in \"Pokémon Crystal\", the is a game feature accessible outside of the main storyline where the player faces several Trainers in succession with a limited set of their Pokémon and receive prizes in the form of otherwise rare items. The Japanese version of \"Crystal\" which had a mobile phone adapter allowed for players to challenge other players to Battle Tower fights. The next Battle Towers appear in \"Ruby\" and \"Sapphire\", which is similar to the \"Crystal\" Battle Tower, and in \"Diamond\" and \"Pearl\", which has a boss character and a point system similar to the Battle Frontiers.\n\nThe was introduced in \"Pokémon Emerald\", replacing the Battle Tower as found in the \"Ruby\" and \"Sapphire\" games. In addition to having its own Battle Tower with the same rules as the previous ones, the Battle Frontier adds several other game mechanics that make battles unique in the end game. Examples include the Battle Palace's prohibition on choosing what moves the Pokémon uses and the Battle Factory's random rental Pokémon. Instead of prizes, the player is awarded Battle Points (BP) which can be traded for rare items or TMs. The \"Diamond\" and \"Pearl\" Battle Tower uses this same system, and it is replaced by a Battle Frontier in \"Pokémon Platinum\". The \"HeartGold\" and \"SoulSilver\" games also have a Battle Frontier, identical to that of the \"Platinum\" version, where the Battle Tower was found in \"Crystal\". After a series of battles in each venue, players encounter who are challenged in the same fashion as all other battles, and the player will either earn a or a for winning. The Frontier Brains can be challenged a second time to more advanced versions of the Symbols or Prints (advancing from Silver to Gold). The Frontier Brains have very powerful Pokémon, often including Legendary Pokémon, making a victory even more difficult than in the main storyline.\n\n\"Emerald\" also features , which allow the player to encounter some of the unique battle mechanics of three of the Battle Frontier venues. Rather than Battle Points, the player is awarded with an item that is rare or expensive.\n\nThe is unique to the \"Black\" and \"White\" games and serves as the games' Battle Tower, taking on the form of a subway to match the games' New York City-styled setting. In the same vein as the Battle Tower in \"Diamond\" and \"Pearl\" and the various Battle Frontiers, players earn BP and after a certain number of battles they challenge one or both of the two Subway Bosses ( in Japan), depending on what type of battles (Single, Double, or Multi) the player was competing in.\n\nThe Battle Subway returns in \"Black 2\" and \"White 2\", but it is joined by two new sets of areas. The first one introduced in the games is the , wherein the player participates in a tournament-style setting with various NPC Trainers, set to a particular theme of a level limit, using randomly assigned teams, or using teams downloaded from the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection, to earn BP. The more advanced side of the Pokémon World Tournament is a tournament-style setting in battling the Gym Leaders and Pokémon League Champions from all over the Pokémon World, enabling players to challenge characters such as Brock and Misty from \"Red\" and \"Blue\", Volkner from \"Diamond\" and \"Pearl\", Lance from \"Gold\" and \"Silver\", or Steven from \"Ruby\" and \"Sapphire\". Also introduced in the games are the in \"Black 2\"s Black City and the in \"White 2\"s White Forest. In these facilities, the player must battle a series of Trainers without using items, and only relying on Doctor or Nurse Trainers to restore their team's health. At the end, the player challenges the leader and later is awarded a rare Pokémon for succeeding.\n\nThe is introduced in \"X\" and \"Y\", and can only be accessed after the player completes the main story. Similar to the Battle Frontier and the Battle Subway, there are different types of battling methods to choose from: single, double, triple, rotation, and multi battles. Then the player is drawn to a tournament where he/she is challenged to numerous battles with random Trainers. After winning a battle the player receives one BP (battle point) which can later be used to by items, vitamins, and TMs. After winning 21 battles the player must battle the strongest Trainer or referred to as the Battle Chatelaine. It depends on what battle style you choose. If the player beats 50 Trainers, they have the chance to battle one of the Battle Chatelaines again. Only this time do they use legendary Pokémon (e.g. Zapdos, Moltres, Articuno). Another similar feature is the , where the player advances through a ranking system based on the French nobility system after battling increasingly difficult Trainers, including being able to battle the Gym Leaders, Elite Four members, and Champion in the same system.\n\nIn \"Pokémon Omega Ruby\" and \"Alpha Sapphire\", the Battle Maison returns, but the Battle Frontier, which was featured in the original \"Pokémon Ruby\" and \"Sapphire\" games, is hinted to be in production. The Battle Maison is very similar to the one in \"Pokémon X\" and \"Y\", but TMs (Technical Machines) cannot be bought; they are replaced by other items.\n\nThe is introduced in \"Pokémon Sun\" and \"Moon\", which involves four Trainers all battling each other at the same time. After becoming Champion, the player is given access to the on Poni Island. The Battle Tree is similar to the Battle Maison, Battle Subway, and Battle Towers from the previous generations. On the 20th battle of normal challenges and 50th battle of Super challenges, a powerful Trainer known as a Battle Legend will be challenged.\n\nIn addition to battling, several Pokémon competitions have been introduced throughout the series to provide an alternate set of mini-games.\n\n are competitions of skill among Pokémon Trainers and their Pokémon partners. Pokémon Contests are different from Pokémon battles, testing talent rather than power. They were introduced in \"Pokémon Ruby\" and \"Sapphire\" and later appeared in \"Emerald\", \"Diamond\", \"Pearl\", \"Platinum\", \"Omega Ruby\", and \"Alpha Sapphire\".\n\nThere are five categories that a Pokémon can be entered into: Beauty, Cute, Cool, Tough, and Smart. In addition, there are four ranks of contests: Normal, Super, Hyper, and Master Rank. To enter, a Trainer must go to the contest hall that holds contests of the appropriate rank, and in ranks higher than Normal, the participating Pokémon must have won the contest of the selected category in the previous rank. In \"Diamond\" and \"Pearl\", Contests are renamed Super Contests, and the four ranks are named Normal, Great, Ultra, and Master.\n\nIn the first round (called \"Visual Competition\" in \"Diamond\" and \"Pearl\") the Pokémon is shown to the audience, who then vote on their favorite. Pokémon will gain more points here if they have good condition in the selected category, which can be increased by using Pokéblocks. In \"Diamond\" and \"Pearl\", Pokéblocks are replaced by Poffins, and the player can also use the stylus to dress up their Pokémon in certain to fit the theme of the contest.\n\nThe second round, called \"Dance Competition\", was introduced in \"Diamond\" and \"Pearl\". The participating Pokémon join in a dance routine. The leading Pokémon gets rated based on following the rhythm, and the rest of the Pokémon have to mimic the leader's steps. All four participants take turns to be the leader.\n\nThe final round (\"Acting Competition\") comprises a few rounds, and the Pokémon are ordered in sequence based on their performance in the previous round. Each round, the player chooses one Pokémon move to perform before the judge, and in \"Diamond\" and \"Pearl\" players also choose which of three judges to appeal to. Each move has a category, appeal value, and effect. Using a good combination will gain the Pokémon more appeal points, but using the same move twice consecutively will be less effective. Moves can have many effects, such as \"jamming\" previous Pokémon to reduce their appeal, or randomizing the order of appeals in the next round. After appeals are concluded, the results are shown, and the Pokémon with the most total points wins a ribbon.\n\nPokéblocks (), introduced in \"Ruby\" and \"Sapphire\", are candy-like treats used to increase the contest condition and Loyalty of Pokémon. Pokéblocks are created from Berries in the \"Berry Blender\" minigame, which can be played by two to four human or computer-controlled players. The types of berries blended by all participants affect the category and effectiveness of the resulting Pokéblock. Pokéblocks are also used in the games' Safari Zone to attract wild Pokémon.\n\n, a type of baked goods, were introduced in \"Pokémon Diamond\" and \"Pearl\" as replacements for Pokéblocks. Poffins are made by adding a Berry to some batter in a pot, and stirring it with a stylus using the Nintendo DS's touch screen. Poffins can be mixed only with human partners and can be done solo or with two to four players wirelessly.\n\nIn \"Pokémon HeartGold\" and \"SoulSilver\", the contest minigame is replaced with an athletic competition called the . The competitions range from track and field events such as hurdling or a relay race to a snowball fight and a game resembling pachinko.\n\nA Pokémon's stats may be increased by consuming made from fruits known as Apricorns that the player can find throughout the world. By putting a number of Apricorns in a blender and making the player character run a certain number of steps, the Apricorns are mixed into a milkshake-like blend. The process can be repeated multiple times, each time adding more Apricorns to the mixture and running to blend them. The number of times this is done, along with the variety of Apricorns used, affects the type and effectiveness of the resulting Aprijuice. Aprijuice will increase one of five additional statistics that only exist for the Pokéathlon which consist of Speed (unique from the standard Speed statistic), Power, Skill, Jump, and Stamina.\n\nIn \"Pokémon Black\" and \"White\", the contest minigame is replaced by the . Rather than grooming Pokémon with Pokéblocks, Poffins, or Aprijuice, the player's Pokémon is only dressed in Accessories which can be waved around on stage when the Pokémon dances to various pieces of music; the player does not control the Pokémon during this time, other than Appealing with special props. If the audience likes the performance, they give more props to the player in person post-performance. The player can, in fact, control the camera angle during the performance.\n\nAnother minigame is added in \"Black 2\" and \"White 2\" called . The player joins the cast of a movie and participates in a mock battle with a chroma key opponent, all while picking line options that match the script of the film and completing an objective within a particular set of turns. Depending on how well the player performs according to the script (or if the player introduced a twist to the intended ending), he or she receives items from the film premiere's audience and unlocks more movies to participate in.\n\n"}
{"id": "1123846", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1123846", "title": "Ghost story", "text": "Ghost story\n\nA ghost story may be any piece of fiction, or drama, that includes a ghost, or simply takes as a premise the possibility of ghosts or characters' belief in them. The \"ghost\" may appear of its own accord or be summoned by magic. Linked to the ghost is the idea of \"hauntings\", where a supernatural entity is tied to a place, object or person. Ghost stories are commonly examples of ghostlore.\n\nColloquially, the term \"ghost story\" can refer to any kind of scary story. In a narrower sense, the ghost story has been developed as a short story format, within genre fiction. It is a form of supernatural fiction and specifically of weird fiction, and is often a horror story.\n\nWhile ghost stories are often explicitly meant to be scary, they have been written to serve all sorts of purposes, from comedy to morality tales. Ghosts often appear in the narrative as sentinels or prophets of things to come. Belief in ghosts is found in all cultures around the world, and thus ghost stories may be passed down orally or in written form.\n\nA widespread belief concerning ghosts is that they are composed of a misty, airy, or subtle material. Anthropologists link this idea to early beliefs that ghosts were the person within the person (the person's spirit), most noticeable in ancient cultures as a person's breath, which upon exhaling in colder climates appears visibly as a white mist. Belief in ghosts is found in all cultures around the world, and thus ghost stories may be passed down orally or in written form.\n\nThe campfire story, a form of oral storytelling, often involves recounting ghost stories, or other scary stories. Some of the stories are decades old, with varying versions across multiple cultures. Many schools and educational institutions encourage ghost storytelling as part of literature.\n\nIn 1929, five key features of the English ghost story were identified in \"Some Remarks on Ghost Stories\" by M. R. James. As summarized by Frank Coffman for a course in popular imaginative literature, they were:\n\nThe introduction of pulp magazines in the early 1900s created new avenues for ghost stories to be published, and they also began to appear in publications such as \"Good Housekeeping\" and \"The New Yorker\".\n\nGhosts in the classical world often appeared in the form of vapor or smoke, but at other times they were described as being substantial, appearing as they had been at the time of death, complete with the wounds that killed them. Spirits of the dead appear in literature as early as Homer's \"Odyssey\", which features a journey to the underworld and the hero encountering the ghosts of the dead, as well as the Old Testament in which the Witch of Endor calls the spirit of the prophet Samuel.\n\nThe play \"Mostellaria\", by the Roman playwright Plautus, is the earliest known work to feature a haunted dwelling, and is sometimes translated as \"The Haunted House\". Another early account of a haunted place comes from an account by Pliny the Younger (c. 50 AD). Pliny describes the haunting of a house in Athens by a ghost bound in chains, an archetype that would become familiar in later literature.\n\nGhosts often appeared in the tragedies of the Roman writer Seneca, who would later influence the revival of tragedy on the Renaissance stage, particularly Thomas Kyd and Shakespeare.\n\nThe \"One Thousand and One Nights\", sometimes known as \"Arabian Nights\", contains a number of ghost stories, often involving jinn (also spelled as djinn), ghouls and corpses. In particular, the tale of \"Ali the Cairene and the Haunted House in Baghdad\" revolves around a house haunted by jinns. Other medieval Arabic literature, such as the \"Encyclopedia of the Brethren of Purity\", also contain ghost stories.\n\nThe 11th century Japanese work \"The Tale of Genji\" contains ghost stories, and includes characters being possessed by spirits.\n\nIn the mid-16th century, the works of Seneca were rediscovered by Italian humanists, and they became the models for the revival of tragedy. Seneca's influence is particularly evident in Thomas Kyd's \"The Spanish Tragedy\" and Shakespeare's \"Hamlet\", both of which share a revenge theme, a corpse-strewn climax, and ghosts among the cast. The ghosts in \"Richard III\" also resemble the Senecan model, while the ghost in \"Hamlet\" plays a more complex role. The shade of Hamlet's murdered father in \"Hamlet\" has become one of the more recognizable ghosts in English literature. In another of Shakespeare’s works, \"Macbeth\", the murdered Banquo returns as a ghost to the dismay of the title character.\n\nIn English Renaissance theatre, ghosts were often depicted in the garb of the living and even in armour. Armour, being out-of-date by the time of the Renaissance, gave the stage ghost a sense of antiquity. The sheeted ghost began to gain ground on stage in the 1800s because an armoured ghost had to be moved about by complicated pulley systems or lifts, and eventually became clichéd stage elements and objects of ridicule. Ann Jones and Peter Stallybrass, in \"Renaissance Clothing and the Materials of Memory\", point out, \"In fact, it is as laughter increasingly threatens the Ghost that he starts to be staged not in armor but in some form of 'spirit drapery'.\" An interesting observation by Jones and Stallybrass is that \"at the historical point at which ghosts themselves become increasingly implausible, at least to an educated elite, to believe in them at all it seems to be necessary to assert their immateriality, their invisibility. [...] The drapery of ghosts must now, indeed, be as spiritual as the ghosts themselves. This is a striking departure both from the ghosts of the Renaissance stage and from the Greek and Roman theatrical ghosts upon which that stage drew. The most prominent feature of Renaissance ghosts is precisely their gross materiality. They appear to us conspicuously clothed.\" \n\nGhosts figured prominently in traditional British ballads of the 16th and 17th centuries, particularly the “Border Ballads” of the turbulent border country between England and Scotland. Ballads of this type include \"The Unquiet Grave\", \"The Wife of Usher's Well\", and \"Sweet William's Ghost\", which feature the recurring theme of returning dead lovers or children. In the ballad \"King Henry\", a particularly ravenous ghost devours the king’s horse and hounds before forcing the king into bed. The king then awakens to find the ghost transformed into a beautiful woman.\n\nOne of the key early appearances by ghosts was \"The Castle of Otranto\" by Horace Walpole in 1764, considered to be the first gothic novel.\nHowever, although the ghost story shares the use of the supernatural with the Gothic novel, the two forms differ. Ghost stories, unlike Gothic fiction, usually take place in a time and location near to the audience of the story.\n\nThe modern short story emerged in Germany in the early decades of the 19th century. Kleist's \"The Beggar Woman of Locarno\", published in 1810, and several other works from the period lay claim to being the first ghost short stories of a modern type. E. T. A. Hoffmann's ghost stories include \"The Elementary Spirit\" and \"The Mines of Falun\".\n\nThe Russian equivalent of the ghost story is the \"\". Notables examples of the genre from the 1830s include Gogol's \"Viy\" and Pushkin's \"The Queen of Spades\", although there were scores of other stories from lesser known writers, produced primarily as Christmas fiction. The Vosges mountain range is the setting for most ghost stories by the French writing team of Erckmann-Chatrian.\n\nOne of the earliest writers of ghost stories in English was Sir Walter Scott. His ghost stories, \"Wandering Willie's Tale\" (1824, first published as part of \"Redgauntlet\") and \"The Tapestried Chamber\" (1828) eschewed the \"Gothic\" style of writing and helped set an example for later writers in the genre.\n\nHistorian of the ghost story Jack Sullivan has noted that many literary critics argue a \"Golden Age of the Ghost Story\" existed between the decline of the Gothic novel in the 1830s and the start of the First World War. Sullivan argues that the work of Edgar Allan Poe and Sheridan Le Fanu inaugurated this \"Golden Age\".\n\nIrish author Sheridan Le Fanu was one of the most influential writers of ghost stories.. Le Fanu's collections, such as \"In a Glass Darkly\" (1872) and \"The Purcell Papers\" (1880), helped popularise the short story as a medium for ghost fiction. Charlotte Riddell, who wrote fiction as Mrs. J. H. Riddell, created ghost stories which were noted for adept use of the haunted house theme.\nThe \"classic\" ghost story arose during the Victorian period, and included authors such as M. R. James, Sheridan Le Fanu, Violet Hunt, and Henry James. Classic ghost stories were influenced by the gothic fiction tradition, and contain elements of folklore and psychology. M. R. James summed up the essential elements of a ghost story as, “Malevolence and terror, the glare of evil faces, ‘the stony grin of unearthly malice', pursuing forms in darkness, and 'long-drawn, distant screams', are all in place, and so is a modicum of blood, shed with deliberation and carefully husbanded...”.\n\nFamous literary apparitions from the Victorian period are the ghosts of \"A Christmas Carol\", in which Ebenezer Scrooge is helped to see the error of his ways by the ghost of his former colleague Jacob Marley, and the ghosts of Christmas Past, Christmas Present and Christmas Yet to Come. In a precursor to \"A Christmas Carol\" Dickens published \"The Story of the Goblins Who Stole a Sexton\". Dickens also wrote \"The Signal-Man\", another work featuring a ghost.\n\nDavid Langford has described British author M. R. James as writing \"the 20th century's most influential canon of ghost stories\". James perfected a method of story-telling which has since become known as Jamesian, which involved abandoning many of the traditional Gothic elements of his predecessors. The classic Jamesian tale usually includes the following elements:\n\nAccording to James, the story must \"put the reader into the position of saying to himself, 'If I'm not very careful, something of this kind may happen to me!'\" He also perfected the technique of narrating supernatural events through implication and suggestion, letting his reader fill in the blanks, and focusing on the mundane details of his settings and characters in order to throw the horrific and bizarre elements into greater relief. He summed up his approach in his foreword to the anthology \"Ghosts and Marvels\" (Oxford, 1924): \"Two ingredients most valuable in the concocting of a ghost story are, to me, the atmosphere and the nicely managed crescendo. ... Let us, then, be introduced to the actors in a placid way; let us see them going about their ordinary business, undisturbed by forebodings, pleased with their surroundings; and into this calm environment let the ominous thing put out its head, unobtrusively at first, and then more insistently, until it holds the stage.\"\n\nHe also noted: \"Another requisite, in my opinion, is that the ghost should be malevolent or odious: amiable and helpful apparitions are all very well in fairy tales or in local legends, but I have no use for them in a fictitious ghost story.\"\n\nDespite his suggestion (in the essay \"Stories I Have Tried to Write\") that writers employ reticence in their work, many of James's tales depict scenes and images of savage and often disturbing violence.\n\nInfluenced by British and German examples, American writers began to produce their own ghost stories. Washington Irving's short story \"The Legend of Sleepy Hollow\" (1820), based on an earlier German folktale, features a Headless Horseman. It has been adapted for film and television many times, such as \"Sleepy Hollow\", a successful 1999 feature film. Irving also wrote \"The Adventure of the German Student\" and Edgar Allan Poe wrote some stories which contain ghosts, such as \"The Masque of the Red Death\" and \"Morella\".\n\nIn the later 19th century, mainstream American writers such as Edith Wharton, Mary E. Wilkins Freeman and F. Marion Crawford all wrote ghost fiction. Henry James also wrote ghost stories, including the famous \"The Turn of the Screw\". \"The Turn of the Screw\" has also appeared in a number of adaptations, notably the film \"The Innocents\" and Benjamin Britten's opera \"The Turn of the Screw\".\n\nThe introduction of pulp magazines in the early 1900s created new avenues for ghost stories to be published, and they also began to appear in publications such as \"Good Housekeeping\" and \"The New Yorker\".\n\nOscar Telgmann's opera \"Leo, the Royal Cadet\" (1885) includes \"Judge's Song\" about a ghost at the Royal Military College of Canada in Kingston, Ontario.\n\nOscar Wilde's comic short story \"The Canterville Ghost\" (1887) has been adapted for film and television on several occasions.\n\nIn the United States, prior to and during the First World War, folklorists Olive Dame Campbell and Cecil Sharp collected ballads from the people of the Appalachian Mountains, which included ghostly themes such as \"The Cruel Ship's Carpenter\", \"The Suffolk Miracle\", \"The Unquiet Grave\" and \"The Wife of Usher's Well\". The theme of these ballads was often the return of a dead lover. These songs were variants of traditional British ballads handed down by generations of mountaineers descended from the people of the Anglo-Scottish border region.\n\nIn the Edwardian era, Algernon Blackwood (who combined the ghost story with nature mysticism), Oliver Onions (whose ghost stories drew on psychological horror), and William Hope Hodgson (whose ghost tales also contained elements of the sea story and science fiction) helped move the ghost story in new directions.\n\nKaidan (怪談), which literally means “supernatural tale” or \"weird tale\", is a form of Japanese ghost story. Kaidan entered the vernacular when a game called Hyakumonogatari Kaidankai became popular in the Edo period. The popularity of the game, as well as the acquisition of a printing press, led to the creation of a literary genre called \"Kaidanshu.\" Kaidan are not always horror stories, they can \"be funny, or strange, or just telling about an odd thing that happened one time\".\n\nLafcadio Hearn published \"\" in 1904 as a collection of Japanese ghost stories collected by Lafcadio Hearn, and later made into a film. The book \"is seen as the first introduction of Japanese superstition to European and American audiences.\"\n\n\"Ghost Stories\" magazine, which contained almost nothing but ghost stories, was published from 1926 to 1932.\n\nBeginning in the 1940s, Fritz Leiber wrote ghost tales set in modern industrial settings, such as \"Smoke Ghost\" (1941) and \"A Bit of the Dark World\" (1962). Shirley Jackson made an important contribution to ghost fiction with her novel \"The Haunting of Hill House\" (1959).\n\nA noted modern British writer of ghost fiction is Ramsey Campbell. Susan Hill also produced \"The Woman in Black\" (1983), a ghost novel that has been adapted for stage, television and film.\n\nNoël Coward's play \"Blithe Spirit\", later made into a 1945 film, places a more humorous slant on the phenomenon of haunting of individuals and specific locations.\n\nDuring the late 1890s the depiction of ghost and supernatural events appear in films. With the advent of motion pictures and television, screen depictions of ghosts became common, and spanned a variety of genres. The works of Shakespeare, Dickens and Wilde have all been made into cinematic versions, as well as adaptations of other playwrights and novelists. One of the well known short films was \"Haunted Castle\" directed by Georges Méliès in 1896. It is also considered as the first silent short film depicting ghost and supernatural events.\n\nAfter the second World War, sentimental depictions of ghosts were more popular in cinema than horror, and include the 1947 film \"The Ghost and Mrs. Muir\", which was later adapted to television with a successful 1968–70 TV series. Genuine psychological horror films from this period include 1944's \"The Uninvited\", and 1945's \"Dead of Night\". The film \"Blithe Spirit\", based on a play by Noël Coward, was also produced in this period. 1963 saw one of the first major adaptations of a ghost novel, \"The Haunting\", based on the well known novel \"The Haunting of Hill House\".\n\nThe 1970s saw screen depictions of ghosts diverge into distinct genres of the romantic and horror. A common theme in the romantic genre from this period is the ghost as a benign guide or messenger, often with unfinished business, such as 1989's \"Field of Dreams\", the 1990 film \"Ghost\", and the 1993 comedy \"Heart and Souls\". In the horror genre, 1980's \"The Fog\", and the \"A Nightmare on Elm Street\" series of films from the 1980s and 1990s are notable examples of the trend for the merging of ghost stories with scenes of physical violence. The 1990s saw a return to classic \"gothic\" ghosts, whose dangers were more psychological than physical. Examples of films from this period include 1999's \"The Sixth Sense\" and \"The Others\". The 1990s also saw a lighthearted adaptation of the children's character \"Casper the Friendly Ghost\", originally popular in cartoon form in the 1950s and early 1960s, in the feature film \"Casper\".\n\nAsian cinema has also produced horror films about ghosts, such as the 1998 Japanese film \"Ringu\" (remade in the US as \"The Ring\" in 2002), and the Pang brothers' 2002 film \"The Eye\". Indian ghost movies are popular not just in India, but in the Middle East, Africa, South East Asia and other parts of the world. Some Indian ghost movies such as the comedy / horror film \"Chandramukhi\" have been commercial successes, dubbed into several languages. Generally the films are based on the experiences of modern people who are unexpectedly exposed to ghosts, and usually draw on traditional Indian literature or folklore. In some cases the Indian films are remakes of western films, such as \"Anjaane\", based on Alejandro Amenábar's ghost story \"The Others\".\n\nIn fictional television programming, ghosts have been explored in series such as \"Ghost Whisperer\", \"Medium\", \"Supernatural\", the television series adaptation of \"The Ghost and Mrs. Muir\" and \"Randall and Hopkirk (Deceased)\". In animated fictional television programming, ghosts have served as the central element in series such as \"Casper the Friendly Ghost\", \"Danny Phantom\", and \"Scooby-Doo\", as well as minor roles in various other television shows.\n\nPopularized in part by the 1984 comedy franchise \"Ghostbusters\", ghost hunting has been popularized as a hobby wherein reportedly haunted places are explored. The ghost hunting theme has been featured in paranormal reality television series, such as \"A Haunting\", \"Ghost Adventures\", \"Ghost Hunters\", \"Ghost Hunters International\", \"Ghost Lab\", and \"Most Haunted\". It is also represented in children's television by such programs as \"The Ghost Hunter\" based on the book series of the same name and \"Ghost Trackers\".\n\nThe Indian television series, \"Aahat\", featured ghost and supernatural stories written by B. P. Singh. It was first aired on 5 October 1995 and ran for more than a decade, ending on 25 November 2010 with more than 450 episodes.\n\n\n\n"}

However, the following year, he was recruited by Kyoto Imperial University, which had just established a Department of Economics, and was sent to Europe for six years to study public finance in Germany and Austria. On his return, he worked at Kyoto Imperial University as a professor of economics, specializing on the economic effects of war. In 1917, he was awarded a doctorate in law.\n\nOgawa then entered politics, winning a seat in the House of Representatives of Japan in the 1917 general election, and was subsequently re-elected to the same seat in the Okayama constituency a total of eight times. Initially with the \"Shinseikai,\" he later assisted in the formation of the \"Seiyu Hontō\" political party, subsequently serving as president of its policy research committee, and joined the \"Rikken Minseitō\" when the \"Seiyu Hontō\" merged with the \"Kenseikai\".\n\nOgawa left Kyoto Imperial University in 1924 to accept the post of dean of Takushoku University. In 1929, he served as parliamentary under-secretary for Finance under the Hamaguchi administration.\n\nIn 1936, Prime Minister Kōki Hirota asked that Ogawa accept the post of Minister of Commerce and Industry. In this position, he opposed many of the ministry bureaucrats who were pushing towards increased state control over the economy, and forced a number, including Nobusuke Kishi, to resign.\n\nIn 1940 he served in the second Konoe administration as Railway Minister. After the start of World War II, in 1943, he took charge of the committee of internal affairs of the \"Taisei Yokusankai.\" However, later in 1943, he was invited to the nominally independent State of Burma by President Ba Maw as a special advisor on economics and finance. He spent the remainder of the war years in Burma, attempting to set the country on a secure footing through financial consolidation.\n\nOn April 1, 1945, while attempting to return to Japan, Ogawa was killed as a passenger on the \"Awa Maru\", which was sunk by the US submarine in the East China Sea despite its status as a hospital ship under Red Cross protection.

The intelligible method is thought thinking itself, or the human mind reflecting on itself. Plato referred to the intelligible realm of mathematics, forms, first principles, logical deduction, and the dialectical method. The intelligible realm of thought thinking about thought does not necessarily require any visual images, sensual impressions, and material causes for the contents of mind. Descartes referred to this method of thought thinking about itself, without the possible illusions of the senses. Kant made similar claims about a priori knowledge. A priori knowledge is claimed to be independent of the content of experience.\n\nThe objects or concepts that have intelligibility may be called intelligible. Some possible examples are numbers and the logical law of non-contradiction.\n\nThere may be a distinction between everything that is intelligible and everything that is visible, called the \"intelligible world\" and the \"visible world\" in e.g. the analogy of the divided line as written by Plato.\n\nThe Absolute is generally regarded as being only partially intelligible. The Absolute is the idea of an unconditional reality which transcends limited, conditional, everyday existence. It is sometimes used as a term for God or the Divine.

From a working-class family in Lancashire, he worked at a number of jobs before becoming well known in the years before the First World War as a boxing promoter. From that, he moved into property and other transactions, making large sums of money in major deals. He became a racehorse owner and theatre proprietor.\n\nWhite finally overreached himself financially, and being unable to meet his huge liabilities, committed suicide at the age of 50.\n\nWhite was born in Rochdale, Lancashire, the son of Thomas White, a bricklayer, and his wife, Catherine, \"née\" Mullroy. He was educated at St John's Roman Catholic School, Rochdale. Little is known of his early career; it is on record that he worked in a cotton mill, and White said in 1925 that when he was 19, he and three others bought a circus in Rochdale, and that he later leased a theatre in Matlock in the adjoining county of Derbyshire.\n\nIn 1899, when he was 21, White married Annie Fetton, a worker in the wool industry. In 1900 he went to South Africa to work as a labourer on the railways, returning less than a year later. He became a builder and later bought and sold property and arranged finance for purchasers. In 1908 he suffered a financial failure and was declared bankrupt, although he ultimately paid all his debts in full. The \"Oxford Dictionary of National Biography\" records that Annie White died at an unknown date and White married a second time, having a son and three daughters with his second wife, Doris. In fact his first wife divorced him in 1921, a Chancery Court case later establishing that White settled £60,000 to fund an annuity for her. \n\nWhite moved to London and turned his hand to promoting boxing matches. In 1911 he attracted public notice when a much-publicised match under his management was banned because one of the boxers was black. White threatened to stage the match in Paris to escape the ban. The enormous public interest in the controversy propelled White to the attention of businessmen, politicians and press barons; his influence as a broker of deals grew steadily. In the words of the ODNB, \"White possessed the kind of charisma that disarmed critics. With deep-blue eyes, an engaging smile, and a Lancastrian breeziness, he impressed those willing to fall under his spell.\" The conductor Sir Thomas Beecham, whose financial fortunes became entangled with those of White, described him as \"one of that group of financial wizards who appeared and vanished like comets in the sky of the business world during the period 1910–1930\".\n\nBeecham's dealings with White came about through Beecham's father, Sir Joseph. In 1914 White persuaded Beecham senior to underwrite the purchase of the Covent Garden estate and market in London. The transaction was incomplete when the First World War broke out in 1914 and public share issues for non-essential purposes were prohibited. Two years later, with the deal still in limbo, White was on the verge of resolving all outstanding funding problems when Sir Joseph died suddenly, leaving a financial tangle that had to be settled by the courts.\n\nIn 1913, White was appointed financial adviser to Dunlop Rubber and persuaded the company to set up an American subsidiary, which failed. He also speculated in the Lancashire cotton industry during a brief trade boom, to the detriment of the industry. After the war he returned to property dealing, and was at first highly successful, buying and profitably reselling large holdings in central London and elsewhere. He also bought a controlling interest in Daly's Theatre, where, he said, \"he had used every resource to keep up the standard laid down by the late Mr. George Edwardes\".\n\nWhite was a lifelong gambler, and spend a large fortune on racehorses, owing stables and entering runners, with some success, for major races. His best horse was probably Irish Elegance, winner of the Royal Hunt Cup and the Portland Handicap in 1919. During the First World War, he organised entertainments for the American servicemen passing through London, and at troop camps throughout the UK. Together with other donors, he ensured that boxing rings and supplies of boxing gloves were available to almost all Allied soldiers on active service.\n\nIn 1927, White overstretched himself financially, and found himself hundreds of thousands of pounds short of the money he needed to meet two concurrent contractual commitments. He committed suicide by poisoning himself at his house near Swindon. He left a note for the coroner, \"Go easy with me, old man. I am dead from prussic acid. No need to cut any deeper. – Jimmy.\" The coroner's inquest found that White was insane at the time of his suicide. Such was White's popularity that more than 5,000 spectators and mourners attended his funeral. However, the financial magazine \"The Economist\" commented that by trusting White, \"many people in many countries have lost far more than they can afford.\" Among the biggest losers were White's wife and children, who were left penniless.\n"}

He was a founding member of Argent, which was led by his cousin Rod Argent, and performed with them from their formation in 1969 until they disbanded in 1976. He was the bass guitarist for The Kinks from 1978 until they disbanded in 1996. In 2004, he joined the reunited Zombies, whom he had been closely associated with since the early 1960s, and remained a member until his death in 2018. He was also a member of The Swinging Blue Jeans and The Kast Off Kinks.\n\nRodford was born on 7 July 1941, in St Albans, Hertfordshire, England. In the late 1950s and early 1960s he was a member of the Bluetones, the biggest band in St Albans at the time. Although he did not become a band member at this stage, Rodford was instrumental in helping his younger cousin Rod Argent form the Zombies in 1964. Rodford later joined the Mike Cotton Sound as a bass guitarist.\n\nAlong with Rod Argent, Rodford was one of the founding members of Argent. When Rod Argent quit the band, the remaining three members (Rodford, Bob Henrit, and John Verity) formed the short-lived band Phoenix. Eventually, Rodford joined the Kinks as a bass guitarist in 1978 and played with them until their final disintegration in 1996.\n\nFrom 1999–2001 Rodford appeared in a band that ex-Animals guitarist Hilton Valentine formed, The Animals II, which also featured former Animals drummer John Steel, and keyboardist Dave Rowberry. Rodford continued with this band (which changed its working name to \"The Animals and Friends\" after Valentine left) until joining Argent and Colin Blunstone in the revival of the Zombies.\n\nRodford never played with the Zombies in the 1960s, despite having been closely involved with them. However, he began to play the bass guitar with the band's reincarnation in the early years of the 21st century, with his son Steve on drums.\n\nIn 2008, Rodford joined the Kast Off Kinks, on the retirement of John Dalton, whom he had followed into the Kinks after Andy Pyle.

{"id": "507834", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=507834", "title": "Kim Jong-nam", "text": "Kim Jong-nam\n\nKim Jong-nam (, ; 10 May 1971 – 13 February 2017) was the eldest son of North Korean leader Kim Jong-il. From roughly 1994 to 2001, he was considered the heir apparent to his father. He was thought to have fallen out of favour after embarrassing the regime in 2001 with a failed attempt to visit Tokyo Disneyland with a false passport, although Kim said his loss of favour was due to advocating reform.\n\nKim was exiled from North Korea 2003, becoming an occasional critic of his family's regime. His younger paternal half-brother, Kim Jong-un, was named heir apparent in September 2010. Kim died on 13 February 2017 in Malaysia as the result of what the US Department of State eventually determined was an assassination conducted by North Korea using VX nerve agent.\n\nKim Jong-nam was born 10 May 1971 in Pyongyang, North Korea, to Song Hye-rim, one of three women known to have had children with Kim Jong-il. Because Kim Jong-il aimed to keep his affair with Song a secret due to the disapproval of his father Kim Il-sung, he initially kept Jong-nam out of school, instead sending him to live with Song's older sister Song Hye-rang, who tutored him at home. North Korea Leadership Watch says he left North Korea to visit his grandmother in Moscow, Soviet Union, and spent his childhood at international schools in both Russia and Switzerland until returning to his home country in 1988.\n\nKim was reported to have had a personality similar to that of his father, and was described by his aunt as being \"hot-tempered, sensitive, and gifted in the arts\". His aunt also said in 2000 that he \"[did] not wish to succeed his father\". Like Kim Jong-il, he was interested in film: he wrote scripts and short films from a young age. His father also created a small movie set for him to use.\n\nKim made several clandestine visits to Japan, starting as early as 1995.\n\nIn 1998, Kim was appointed to a senior position in the Ministry of Public Security of North Korea, as a future leader. He was also reported to have been appointed head of the North Korean Computer Committee, in charge of developing an information technology (IT) industry. In January 2001, he accompanied his father to Shanghai, where he had talks with Chinese officials on the IT industry.\n\nIn May 2001, Kim was arrested in Japan on arrival at Narita International Airport, accompanied by two women and a four-year-old boy identified as his son. He was travelling on a forged Dominican Republic passport using a Chinese alias, Pang Xiong. After being detained he was deported to China, where he said he was travelling to Japan to visit Tokyo Disneyland. The incident caused his father to cancel a planned visit to China due to the embarrassment it caused him.\n\nUntil the Tokyo incident, Kim was expected to become leader of the country after his father. In February 2003, the Korean People's Army began a propaganda campaign under the slogan \"The Respected Mother is the Most Faithful and Loyal Subject to the Dear Leader Comrade Supreme Commander.\" This was interpreted as praise of Ko Young-hee, such that the campaign was designed to promote Kim Jong-chul or Kim Jong-un, her sons.\n\nSince the loyalty of the army is the real foundation of the Kim family's continuing hold on power in North Korea, this was a serious development for Kim Jong-nam's prospects. In late 2003, it was reported that Kim Jong-nam was living in Macau, lending strength to this belief.\n\nKim Jong-un was left in charge while his father was on a state visit to China. Outsider observers also believed North Korea's sinking of a South Korean ship in March 2010 was part of Kim Jong-il's attempt to secure succession for the youngest Kim.\n\nKim's loss of favour was thought to have been caused by the Tokyo incident. Kim, however, said he fell out of favour because he had become an advocate for reform. In an email to the editor of the \"Tokyo Shimbun\", Kim wrote that after being educated in Switzerland, he \"insisted on reform and market-opening\", leading his father to decide that he had turned \"into a capitalist\". Kim at this time has also been described as \"the closest [North Korea] ever had to an international playboy\", and gained a reputation for \"gambling and drinking and arranging the occasional business deal\". He was the only member of the Kim family to ever speak directly to media outside of North Korea.\n\nIt was believed that Kim Jong-nam had friendly ties to China. Outside analysts considered him as a possible candidate to replace Kim Jong-un if the North Korean leadership imploded and China, traditionally an ally, sought a replacement in its client state.\n\nThe \"Asahi Shimbun\" reported that Kim Jong-nam, while travelling to see his brother Kim Jong-chul in Munich, survived an assassination attempt at the Budapest Ferihegy International Airport in July 2006. According to South Korean reports, the Hungarian government protested against the incident to the North Korean embassy in Vienna, requesting there be no recurrence. It was reported in the \"South China Morning Post\" on 1 February 2007, that Kim Jong-nam had been living incognito with his family in Macau, for some three years, and that this was a cause of some embarrassment to both the Macanese and Chinese governments.\n\nSouth Korean television and the \"South China Morning Post\" reported in 2007 that Kim Jong-nam had a Portuguese passport. However, Portuguese authorities and the Portuguese consul in Macau, Pedro Moitinho de Almeida, stated that if Kim had such a document it would be a forgery.\n\nIn January 2009, Kim Jong-nam said he had \"no interest\" in taking power in North Korea after his father, stating that it is only for his father to decide.\n\nIn June 2010, Kim Jong-nam gave a brief interview to the Associated Press in Macau while waiting for a hotel elevator. He said that he had \"no plans\" to defect to Europe, as the press had recently rumoured. Kim Jong-nam lived in an apartment on the southern tip of Macau's Coloane Island until 2007. An anonymous South Korean official reported in October 2010 that Kim Jong-nam had not lived in Macau for \"months\", and shuttled between China and \"another country\".\n\nIn late September 2010, his younger half-brother Kim Jong-un was made heir-apparent. Kim Jong-un was declared Supreme Leader of North Korea on 24 December 2011 after the death of Kim Jong-il. The two half-brothers had never met, because of the ancient practice of raising potential successors separately.\n\nOn 1 January 2012, it was reported that Kim Jong-nam secretly flew to Pyongyang from Macau on 17 December 2011, after learning about his father's death that day and was presumed to have accompanied Kim Jong-un when paying his last respects to their father. He left after a few days to return to Macau and was not in attendance at the funeral to avoid speculation about the succession.\n\nOn 14 January 2012, Kim Jong-nam was seen in Beijing waiting for an Air China flight to Macau. Kim confirmed his identity to a group of South Koreans which included a professor at Incheon University, and told them he usually travels alone.\n\nIn a book released in 2012 titled \"My Father, Kim Jong Il, and Me\" by Japanese journalist Yōji Gomi who had interviewed Kim Jong-nam on numerous occasions, Kim Jong-nam said he expected the leadership of Kim Jong-un to fail, citing that he was too inexperienced and young. He also stated, \"Without reforms, North Korea will collapse, and when such changes take place, the regime will collapse\".\n\nAccording to South Korean intelligence sources, Kim Jong-un had issued a standing order to have his half-brother killed. In 2012, there was another assassination attempt on Kim Jong-nam, who later that year sent a letter to his half-brother begging for his life. In late 2012, he appeared in Singapore one year after leaving Macau. He left Macau on suspicions that he was being targeted for assassination by Kim Jong-un; South Korean authorities had formerly indicted a North Korean agent, Kim Yong-su, who confessed to planning an attack on Kim Jong-nam in July 2010.\n\nIt has been reported that Kim had two wives, at least one mistress, and had at least six children. His first wife, Shin Jong-hui (born ), lives at a home called Dragon Villa on the northern outskirts of Beijing. His second wife, Lee Hye-kyong (born ), their son Han-sol (born 1995) and their daughter Sol-hui (born ) lived in a modest 12-story apartment building in Macau; Jong-nam's mistress, former Air Koryo flight attendant So Yong-la (born ), also lives in Macau. He had several tattoos, including two of dragons.\n\nOn 13 February 2017, Kim died after being attacked by two women with VX nerve agent at Kuala Lumpur International Airport in Malaysia while traveling from Macau under a pseudonym. His death is under investigation, but it is speculated that it was carried out at the command of the North Korean government.\n\n\n"}

It is considered to be one of the aging or \"wear-and-tear\" pigments, found in the liver, kidney, heart muscle, retina, adrenals, nerve cells, and ganglion cells. It is specifically arranged around the nucleus, and is a type of lipochrome.\n\nIt appears to be the product of the oxidation of unsaturated fatty acids and may be symptomatic of membrane damage, or damage to mitochondria and lysosomes. Aside from a large lipid content, lipofuscin is known to contain sugars and metals, including mercury, aluminum, iron, copper and zinc. Lipofuscin is also accepted as consisting of oxidized proteins (30–70%) as well as lipids (20–50%). \n\nThe accumulation of lipofuscin-like material may be the result of an imbalance between formation and disposal mechanisms: Such accumulation can be induced in rats by administering a protease inhibitor (leupeptin); after a period of three months, the levels of the lipofuscin-like material return to normal, indicating the action of a significant disposal mechanism. However, this result is controversial, as it is questionable if the leupeptin-induced material is true lipofuscin. There exists evidence that \"true lipofuscin\" is not degradable \"in vitro\"; whether this holds \"in vivo\" over longer time periods is not clear.\n\nThe \"ABCR -/-\" knockout mouse has delayed dark adaptation but normal final rod threshold relative to controls. Bleaching the retina with strong light leads to formation of toxic cationic \"bis\"-pyridinium salt, N\"-retinylidene-\"N\"-retinyl-ethanolamine (A2E\"), which causes dry and wet age-related macular degeneration. From this experiment, it was concluded that ABCR has a significant role in preventing formation of A2E in extracellular photoreceptor surfaces during bleach recovery.\n\nLipofuscin accumulation is a major risk factor implicated in macular degeneration, a degenerative disease of the eye, as well as Stargardt disease, an inherited juvenile form of macular degeneration.\n\nAbnormal accumulation of lipofuscin known as \"lipofuscinosis\" is associated with a family of neurodegenerative disorders – neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses, the most common of these is Batten disease.\n\nPathological accumulation of lipofuscin is implicated in Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, certain lysosomal diseases, acromegaly, denervation atrophy, lipid myopathy, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and centronuclear myopathy. Accumulation of lipofuscin in the colon is the cause of the condition melanosis coli.\n\nCalorie restriction, vitamin E, and increased glutathione appear to reduce or halt the production of lipofuscin.\n\nThe nootropic drug piracetam appears to significantly reduce accumulation of lipofuscin in the brain tissue of rats.\n\nOther possible treatments:\n\nWet macular degeneration can be treated using selective photothermolysis where a pulsed unfocused laser predominantly heats and kills lipofuscin-rich cells, leaving untouched healthy cells to multiply and fill in the gaps. The technique is also used as a skin treatment to remove tattoos, liverspots, and in general make skin appear younger. This ability to selectively target lipofuscin has opened up research opportunities in the field of anti-aging medicine.\n\nA tetrahydropyridoether can remove lipofuscin from retinal pigment epithelial cells. This opens up a new therapy option for the treatment of dry age-related macular degeneration and Stargardt disease, for which there is currently no treatment. The drug has now been granted orphan drug designation for the treatment of Stargardt disease by the European Medicines Agency.\n\nLipofuscin quantification is used for age determination in various crustaceans such as lobsters and spiny lobsters. Since these animals lack bony parts, they cannot be aged in the same way as bony fish, in which annual increments in the ear-bones or otoliths are commonly used. Age determination of fish and shellfish is a fundamental step in generating basic biological data such as growth curves, and is needed for many stock assessment methods. Several studies have indicated that quantifying the amount of lipofuscin present in the eye-stalks of various crustaceans can give an index of their age. This method has not yet been widely applied in fisheries management mainly due to problems in relating lipofuscin levels in wild-caught animals with accumulation curves derived from aquarium-reared animals.\n\n\n20.

{"id": "106121", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=106121", "title": "Modesty", "text": "Modesty\n\nModesty, sometimes known as demureness, is a mode of dress and deportment which intends to avoid the encouraging of sexual attraction in others. The word \"modesty\" comes from the Latin word \"modestus\" which means \"keeping within measure\". Standards of modesty are culturally and context dependent and vary widely. In this use, it may be considered inappropriate or immodest to reveal certain parts of the body. In some societies, modesty may involve women covering their bodies completely and not talking to men who are not immediate family members; in others, a fairly revealing but one-piece bathing costume is considered modest when other women wear bikinis. In some countries, exposure of the body in breach of community standards of modesty is also considered to be public indecency, and public nudity is generally illegal in most of the world and regarded as indecent exposure. For example, Stephen Gough a lone man attempting to walk naked from south to north Britain was repeatedly imprisoned. However, nudity is at times tolerated in some societies; for example, during a World Naked Bike Ride.\n\nIn semi-public contexts standards of modesty vary. Nudity may be acceptable in public single-sex changing rooms at swimming baths, for example, or for mass medical examination of men for military service. In private, standards again depend upon the circumstances. A person who would never disrobe in the presence of a physician of the opposite sex in a social context might unquestioningly do so for a medical examination; others might allow examination, but only by a person of the same sex.\n\nStandards of modesty discourage or forbid exposure of parts of the body, varying between societies, which may include areas of skin, the hair, undergarments, and intimate parts. The standards may also require obscuring the shape of the body or parts of it by wearing non-form-fitting clothing. There are also customs regarding the changing of clothes (such as on a beach with no enclosed facilities), and the closing or locking of the door when changing or taking a shower.\n\nStandards of modesty vary by culture or generation and vary depending on who is exposed, which parts of the body are exposed, the duration of the exposure, the context, and other variables. The categories of persons who could see another's body could include:\n\nThe context would include matters such as whether it is in one's own home, at another family member's home, at a friend's home, at a semi-public place, at a beach, swimming pool (including whether such venues are considered clothes-optional), changing rooms or other public places. For instance, wearing a bathing suit at the beach would not be considered immodest, while it likely would be in a street or an office.\n\nExcessive modesty is called prudishness. As a medical condition, it is also called gymnophobia. Excessive \"immodesty\" is called exhibitionism.\n\nAt times of public or private emergency, expectations of modest dress may be suspended if necessary. For example, during suspected anthrax attacks in 1998 and 2001 in the United States, groups of people had to strip to their underwear in tents set up in parking lots and other public places for hosing down by fire departments. On the other hand, even in an emergency situation, some people are unable to abandon their need to hide their bodies, even at the risk of their life. This may apply to decontamination after a chemical or biological attack, where removal of contaminated clothing is important, or escaping from a night-time fire without time to dress.\n\nMost discussion of modesty involves clothing. The criteria for acceptable modesty and decency have relaxed continuously in much of the world since the nineteenth century, with shorter, form-fitting, and more revealing clothing and swimsuits, more for women than men. Most people wear clothes that they consider not to be unacceptably immodest for their religion, culture, generation, occasion, and the people present. Some wear clothes which they consider immodest, due to exhibitionism, the desire to create an erotic impact, or for publicity.\n\nAppropriate modesty depends on context and place. For example, in single-sex public changing rooms, nudity is often acceptable.\nIn Western and some other societies, there are differences of opinion as to how much body exposure is acceptable in public. In contemporary Western society, the extent to which a woman may expose cleavage depends on social, cultural and regional context. Women's swimsuits and bikinis commonly may reveal the tops and sides of the breasts, or they may be topless as is common on the beaches of French Riviera. Displaying cleavage is considered permissible in many settings, and is even a sign of elegance and sophistication on many formal social occasions, but it may be considered inappropriate in settings such as workplaces, churches and schools. Showing the nipples or areolae is almost always considered toplessness or partial nudity. However, in some circumstances partial breast exposure may be officially sanctioned in church as in 2014, newly elected Pope Francis drew world-wide commentary when he encouraged mothers to breastfeed in church if their babies were hungry.\n\nIn private homes, the standards of modesty apply selectively. For instance, nudity among close family members in the home can take place, especially in the bedroom and bathroom, and wearing of undergarments only in the home is common.\n\nIn many cultures it is not acceptable to bare the buttocks in public; deliberately doing so is sometimes intended as an insult. In public, Western standards of decency expect people to cover their genitalia, and women to cover their breasts. In the early twenty-first century, public breastfeeding has become increasingly acceptable, sometimes protected by law. President Barack Obama's health care bill from 2010 provides additional support to nursing mothers, requiring employers to provide a private and shielded space for employees to use in order to nurse.\n\nSince the 1980s it has become more common for young and/or fashionable women in Western societies to wear clothing that bared the midriff, \"short shorts,\" backless tops, sheer and other styles considered to be immodest.\n\nMen and women are subject to different standards of modesty in dress. While both men and women, in Western culture, are generally expected to keep their genitals covered at all times, women are also expected to keep their breasts covered. Some body parts are normally more covered by men than women—e.g., the midriff and the upper part of the back. Organizations such as the Topfree Equal Rights Association advocate for gender equality regarding display of the body. In 1992 New York State's highest court accepted 14th Amendment arguments and struck down the provision in New York's \"Exposure of the Person\" statute that made it illegal for women to bare their chests where men were permitted to do so.\n\nTraditional indigenous cultures, such as some African and traditional Australian aboriginal cultures, are more relaxed on issues of clothing, though how much clothing is expected varies greatly, from nothing for some women, to everything except the glans penis for men of some tribes. In some African cultures, body painting is considered to be body coverage, and is considered by many an attire.\n\nModesty doesn't have to be related to having more clothes especially in the case of natives tribes. Some feel exposed when seen in certain clothes even though normal attire is much more revealing. Having ear or lip stoppers is seen as modest with the opposite being true as well.\n\nMost world religions have sought to address the moral issues that arise from people's sexuality in society and in human interactions. Each major religion has developed moral codes covering issues of sexuality, morality, ethics etc. Besides other aspects of sexuality, these moral codes seek to regulate the situations which can give rise to sexual interest and to influence people's behaviour and practices which could arouse such interest, or which overstate a person's sexuality. These religious codes have always had a strong influence on peoples' attitudes to issues of modesty in dress, behavior, speech etc.\n\nModesty in dress is important in Buddhism. The Sekhiya rules of Buddhist Monastic code, for example, provide guidelines on proper clothing as well as recommended ways of dressing for monks.\n\nThe 'robes hitched up' phrase above refers to lifting one's 1 or 2 piece cloth robe, thereby exposing either side or both sides of one's body to other human beings in an inhabited area. Such exhibitionism is not recommended to monks. Beyond monks, the Buddhist belief is that modesty has a purifying quality to everyone.\n\nAccording to the New Testament, () Whose adorning let it not be that outward adorning of plaiting the hair, and of wearing of gold, or of putting on of apparel; But let it be the hidden man of the heart, in that which is not corruptible, even the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit, which is in the sight of God of great price.\n\n() In like manner also, that women adorn themselves in modest apparel, with shamefacedness and sobriety; not with broided hair, or gold, or pearls, or costly array.\n\nMany Trinitarian Christians consider modesty extremely important, though considerable differences of opinion exist about its requirements and purposes.\n\nHistorically, communicants of traditional Christian denominations (including Anglican, Baptist, Eastern Orthodox, Lutheran, Methodist, Oriental Orthodox, Reformed, and Roman Catholic women) wore a Christian headcovering while worshipping, or, all the time, in keeping with their interpretation of ; although this practice has waned in some parts of the world, such as in North America, it is commonplace in other regions, such as Eastern Europe and South Asia.\n\nMany Anabaptist Christians, such as Amish groups and some Mennonite groups like Conservative Mennonites, are known for their adherence to plain dress, a modest fashion style. The Hutterites and the Bruderhof, both Christian intentional communities of the Anabaptist tradition, wear modest clothing (often plain dress), and the women wear Christian headcoverings.\n\nCatholics are expected to dress modestly; it is recognised that the forms taken by modesty vary from one culture to another. The wearing of a Christian headcovering at Mass was for the first time mandated as a universal rule for the Latin Rite by the Code of Canon Law of 1917, abrogated by the 1983 Code of Canon Law. Apart from that, there have never been any \"official\" guidelines issued by the Catholic Church. But from time to time the Church hierarchy, and some popes, have given opinions on various matters; although these guidelines are not binding, they are often followed. Pope Pius XII stated that women should cover their upper arms and shoulders, that their skirts should cover at least as far as the knee, and the neckline should not reveal anything. Giuseppe Cardinal Siri of Genoa stated that trousers were unacceptable dress for women. Many traditional Catholics have attempted to further expand on this latter standard.\n\nSome Catholics have attempted to form cohesive theories of modesty. Sometimes this is from a sociological perspective, while at other times it takes a more systematic, Thomistic approach, combined with the writings of the Church Fathers. Approaches arguing primarily from traditional practices and traditional authorities, such as the Saints, can also be found.\n\nAround 1913, it became fashionable for dresses to be worn with a modest round or V-shaped neckline. In the German Empire, for example, all Roman Catholic bishops joined in issuing a pastoral letter attacking the new fashions.\n\nThe Catholic Legion of Decency has been active from 1933 in monitoring morally objectionable content in films. It has condemned a number of films including several on account of the clothing worn. For example, the Legion has condemned the display of cleavage in \"The Outlaw\" (1941) and in \"The French Line\" (1954).\n\nMethodists belonging to the conservative holiness movement, such as the Allegheny Wesleyan Methodist Connection and Evangelical Wesleyan Church, have guidelines on modest apparel, in accordance with the Wesleyan-Arminian doctrine of outward holiness. The 2015 \"Discipline of the Evangelical Wesleyan Church\", for example, states:\nConservative Friends and Holiness-Orthodox Friends, two associations of Quaker Christians, wear plain dress as part of their testimony of simplicity. \n\nThe Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) has issued official statements on modest dress for its members. Clothing such as \"short shorts and short skirts, shirts that do not cover the stomach, and clothing that does not cover the shoulders or is low-cut in the front or the back\" are discouraged. Men and women are also encouraged to avoid extremes in clothing or hairstyles. Rules on modesty also include women being asked to wear no more than one pair of earrings. Women are generally expected to wear skirts or dresses for church services. Most LDS members do not wear sleeveless shirts or shorts that do not reach the knee.\n\nThe church-funded university, Brigham Young University (BYU), requires students and tenants of BYU housing to sign an agreement to live according to these standards of modesty.\n\nThe premise and concepts of modesty have evolved under Hinduism. During Vedic times, both women and men wore at least two pieces of draped dress that was largely undifferentiated, voluntary and flexible. Stitched clothes such as skirts and bodices were also common in the Vedic period. However, modesty was not determined by the precepts of religion, but by local traditions, social codes, profession, circumstances and occasion. The multiple pieces of draped dress for women evolved into a single length of draped cloth among Indian Hindus, now called sari; but remained two or more pieces in Southeast Asian Hindus. For men, the draped dress reduced to one piece now called by various names such as dhoti, \"lungi\", \"pancha\", \"laacha\" and other names among Indian Hindus, and \"kamben\" among Balinese Hindu.\n\nThe Hindu belief, suggests Christopher Bayly, is that modesty through appropriate dress has the energy to transmit spirit and substance in a social discourse, the dress serves as a means of expression or celebration, with some dressing elements such as saffron threads or white dress worn by men as moral, transformative and a means to identify and communicate one’s social role in a gathering, or one's state of life such as mourning in days or weeks after the passing away of a loved one.\n\nThe canons of modesty for Hindus in South Asia underwent significant changes with the arrival of Islam in the 12th century. The Islamic rulers imposed a dress code in public places for Hindu dhimmis, per their Islamic mores of modesty. The \"sari\" worn by Hindu women extended to provide a veil, as well as a complete cover of her navel and legs. In the early 18th century, Tryambakayajvan—a court official in south central India—issued an edict called \"Stridharmapaddhati\". The ruling outlined required dress code for orthodox Hindus in that region. \"Stridharmapaddhati\" laced social trends with Hindu religion to place new rules on modesty for women, but gave much freedom to men.\n\nThe concept of modesty evolved again during colonial times when the British administration required Indians to wear dresses to help identify and segregate the local native populations. Bernard Cohn, and others remark that dress during colonial era became part of a wider issue in India about respect, honor and modesty, with the dress code intentionally aimed by the administration to reflect the nature of relationship between the British ruler and the Indian ruled. The British colonial empire, encouraged and sometimes required Indians to dress in an 'oriental manner', to help define and enforce a sense of modesty, identify roles and a person's relative social status. Among Indonesian Hindus, the accepted practice of toplessness among teenage Hindu girls changed during the Dutch colonial rule, with women now wearing a blouse or colorful cloth.\n\nInside most Hindu temples, there is an expectation of modesty rather than sexual allurement. Men and women typically wear traditional dress during religious ceremonies and rituals in a temple, with women wearing \"sari\" or regional Indian dress. In Indonesia and Cambodia, Hindu temple visitors are often requested to wrap their waist with traditional single piece cloth called \"kamben\", \"wastra\" or \"sarung\", with or without \"saput\".\n\nHindus have diverse views on modesty, with significant regional and local variations. Among orthodox Hindu populations, sexually revealing dress or any sexual behavior in public or before strangers is considered immodest, particularly in rural areas. In contrast, the dress of deities and other symbolism in Hindu temples, the discussion of dress and eroticism in ancient Hindu literature, and art works of Hinduism can be explicit, celebrating eroticism and human sexuality.\n\nIn general, a disregard of modesty can be confusing or distressing, in particular to traditional Hindu women. Even in health care context, some Hindu women may express reluctance to undress for examination. If undressing is necessary, the patient may prefer to be treated by a doctor or nurse of the same sex.\n\nIslam has strongly emphasized the concept of decency and modesty. In many authentic hadiths, it has been quoted that \"modesty is a part of faith\". Modesty is verily required in the interaction between members of the opposite sex and in some case between the members of same sex also. Dress code is part of that overall teaching.\n\n\"And tell the believing women to cast down their glances and guard their private parts and not expose their adornment except that which [necessarily] appears thereof and to wrap [a portion of] their headcovers over their chests and not expose their adornment except to their husbands, their fathers, their husbands' fathers, their sons, their husbands' sons, their brothers, their brothers' sons, their sisters' sons, their women, that which their right hands possess, or those male attendants having no physical desire, or children who are not yet aware of the private aspects of women.\" -Quran 24:31.\n\n“O Prophet! Say to your wives, your daughters, and the women of the believers that: they should let down upon themselves their jalabib.” -Quran 33:59. Jalabib is an Arabic word meaning \"loose outer garment\".\n\nIn some Muslim societies, women wear the niqab, a veil that covers the whole face except the eyes, or the full burqa, a full-body covering garment that occasionally does cover the eyes. Wearing these garments is common in some, but not all, countries with a predominantly Muslim population.\nThough by some scholars these expressions of modesty are interpreted as mandatory, most countries do not enforce modesty by law. However, a few countries, such as Saudi Arabia, Afghanistan and Iran, enforce specified standards of dress for women.\n\n\"Tell the believing men to cast down their glances and guard their private parts. That is purer for them. Indeed, Allah is [well] acquainted with what they do.\" -Quran 24:30\n\nMost scholars agree that men are required to cover everything from the navel to the knees; some men choose also to wear the traditional Islamic cap (taqiyah), similar to but larger than the Jewish yarmulke or kippah. The taqiyah may vary in shape, size and color, with differences according to tradition, region, and personal taste.\n\nModesty in Judaism, called Tzniut (), is important beyond aspects of clothing. It extends to behaviour in public and in private, and depends on the context.\n\nOrthodox and ultra-Orthodox Jewish women usually wear skirts to their knees, with blouses covering the collarbone and sleeves coming to or covering elbows. See-through materials may not be used and clothes are expected not to be tight-fitting, provocative, loud in color, or display texts. These rules are relaxed to allow for color and text in less strict communities. Some modern Orthodox communities allow the collarbone to be shown (so long as cleavage is amply covered), and sleeves not to reach the elbow. There are many different opinions on these issues. Some communities apply these standards to girls as young as three. Less strict Conservative Judaism recommends modest dress, but this is not broadly observed. Less restrictive branches of Judaism tend to adopt the fashions of the society in which they live.\n\nIt is the custom for an observant married Orthodox Jewish woman to cover her hair in public, and sometimes at home. The hair covering may be a scarf, hat, snood called a Tichel, or a wig called a Sheitel.\n\nWomen who do not follow all the regulations in everyday life, often do so during religious observances in a synagogue or elsewhere.\n\nStandards of modesty also apply to men. While some men will wear shorts and short-sleeve shirts, however strictly orthodox men will not. More modern Orthodox Jewish Men will be more lax in their dress when surrounded by other men (if it is not in a religious environment). Modesty for men most often translates to covering the torso and legs with loose clothing. Different groups of Orthodox Jews have different dress norms. But most have men dress in black suits, white dress shirts, and a Black hat (along with religious clothing).\n\nSome individuals adopt modesty standards of other groups or standards of previous generations. An example includes the Noahides who follow Jewish laws but are not themselves Jewish.\n\nStandards of modesty in art have varied at different times and in different places. Nudity and various types of behavior were sometimes depicted, sometime not. In many cases where society did not allow nudity or immodest dress, nudity was accepted in art. Where nudity in art was not acceptable, full nudity was not displayed; otherwise nude subjects had their intimate parts hidden by apparently accidental draped fabric, flowers, other people, a fig leaf, etc. In films, very brief nudity was accepted. Some nude artworks had fig leaves added when standards became less permissive.\n\nIn a given society, the criteria varied according to the circumstances; for example artworks on public display were more restrained than those for private display to adults.\n\nNudity in art was sometimes suggested without actual depiction by:\n\nIn cartoons, even in cases where the genital area is not covered with clothing, genitals are often simply not drawn, as is the case in Family Guy and other animated sitcoms. In the film \"Barnyard\", showing anthropomorphized cattle of both sexes walking on two legs, instead of either showing genitals of male cattle or not showing them, the concept of a \"male cow\" was used, with an udder. In \"Underdog\" a partly animated anthropomorphized dog is shown with penis when a real dog is filmed, and without penis in the animated parts.\n\nPaintings are sometimes changed because of changed modesty standards, and later sometimes changed back. During the Counter-Reformation there was a \"fig-leaf campaign\" aiming to cover all representations of human genitals in paintings and sculptures that started with Michelangelo's works. Works covered in this way include the marble statue of \"Cristo della Minerva\" (church of Santa Maria sopra Minerva, Rome) which was covered by added drapery, as it remains today, and the statue of the naked child Jesus in \"Madonna of Bruges\" (The Church of Our Lady in Bruges, Belgium) remained covered for several decades. Also, the plaster copy of the David in the Cast Courts (Victoria and Albert Museum) in London, has a fig leaf in a box at the back of the statue. It was there to be placed over the statue's genitals so that they would not upset visiting female royalty. The statue of Achilles at Hyde Park Corner now has an incongruous figleaf permanently attached, after it was stolen several times. \nMany fairytales and other related media feature women from or ethnic origin from Western Europe and Northern Europe to be demure due to their typically soft features. Famous examples include Snow White, Cinderella, Sleeping Beauty, Beauty and the Beast, Little Red Riding Hood, Wendy Darling from Peter Pan, Maid Marian from Robin Hood, Christine Daaé from The Phantom of the Opera, Ophelia from Hamlet, and Dorothy Gale from The Wonderful Wizard of Oz.\n\n"}
{"id": "6982681", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6982681", "title": "Mor-Taxan", "text": "Mor-Taxan\n\nMor-Taxans are the extraterrestrial inhabitants of the fictional planet Mor-Tax, in the first season of the \"War of the Worlds\" television series. They are loosely based on the Martians from the 1953 film version of \"The War of the Worlds\".\n\nMor-Taxan society is divided into three functional castes: ruling class, military, and scientists.\nThe ruling class is represented on Earth by a triad called the Advocacy who oversee the invasion while their leaders known as the Council (never seen on screen) remain on Mor-Tax to supervise evacuation from their dying planet. The lower class belong mainly to so-called 'field units' who are undercover in human society while most of the scientists stay in Advocacy headquarters at Nevada desert to provide medical and engineering service.\n\nA quote from the show which illustrates this class system is: \"There are thousands of us...but we are ruled by the three.\" (Quinn to Blackwood)\n\nApparently, Mor-Taxans love art, as evidence by renegade Quinn, whose works are very valuable among humans.\n\nThe Mor-Taxans possess some advanced technology; including old remains from previous invasions, and some devices which they created from parts found on Earth. Examples include:\n\nThe Mor-Taxans employ two known means of communication. One is verbal or phonetic, and is mainly a spoken language, though occasionally they emit more bestial and guttural sounds. The nature of their language is distinctly alien, but at times the observant listener can hear pieces of a human language. For example, in one episode, as the aliens are talking about our sun (via subtitles), the word \"sol\" or \"solar\" can be heard in correspondence. In other, \"craft\" is audible when discussing a ship. While this fictional language sounds inspired in part of African origin, what real human languages were amalgamated in it are unknown. It is of note, that when the aliens talk in human host bodies, there seems to be little distinction between their voices, both among each other and from those in their natural state. However, whereas their voices are mostly heard in more a high pitch, there are times when an aliens' voice is lower. The reasons for this, either within the show or behind-the-scenes, are unknown.\n\nAnother method often used is the use of radio transmissions. To the human ear, they are heard simply as a pulsating noise. An explained aspect to this is that this is the same sounds heard when they are seen standing back-to-back in threes in what seems to be a trance. The show never explains what exactly they are doing, but the novelization refers to it as a \"communion of consciousness.\" Though it's unclear if the book is canon, the show itself reflects little to refute this. The reference of their collective nature and mindset, and even their crude telepathic abilities support this theory. However, the strongest case is in their means of operating their ships. Dr. Clayton Forrester speculated that they use brainwave impulses and in one scene we see three aliens operating a ship, without apparent physical guidance, sitting in their common triangle formation, emitting the same pulsating sounds. To further the possible organic nature, there is evidence the aliens can understand the broadcasts as if they were a simple language. To this extent, in one episode, they are used in some way for the benefit of their unhatched young. Norton Drake, the member of the Blackwood Project who receives and studies the signals, even goes as far as to refer to them as \"baby talk.\"\n\n\nThe melting into humans seems to be reversible. The Advocacy is seen in human bodies, then after discovery of environmental suits they somehow returned to their original form and in the episodes \"To Heal the Leper\" and \"The Angel of Death\" they melted into humans twice. This ability is somehow connected with immunology or alien genetics. Quinn, who is immune to Earth bacteria, is also imprisoned in a human body.\n\n"}

He lives in the Evergreen Forest in harmony among the animals and plants.\n\nThe Moss Man figure was first released in 1985, as part of the line's fourth wave of figures. \n\nThe figure is a green repaint of the Beast Man action figure, covered with fuzzy \"moss\" flocking, with the fangs painted over, and a pine scent added to the body. He has a brown mace that is a recast of a weapon from the original Castle Grayskull playset. With his added scent, he can in some ways be considered a Heroic counterpart to the Evil Warrior Stinkor, released in the same wave, who also had an added scent. \n\nExamples of the Moss Man figure can be found both with hollow, 'squeezable' heads, as was common for earlier figures in the line, as well as more solid rubber heads, which became more common in the later days of the line.\n\nGiven that the accompanying cartoon series was drawing to a close at the time his toy was released, Moss Man's role in the cartoon is minimal and he appears in only two episodes: \"Here, There, Skeletors Everywhere\" and \"The Ancient Mirror of Avathar\". The former portrays him as a spy who can secretly observe danger by turning into a plant. The latter shows him using his abilities to rescue others by turning his arms into vines, as well as communicating with plants. He also has a non-speaking cameo appearance with a number of other lesser-seen characters in \"\", where he appears in the background at Prince Adam and Princess Adora's birthday party.\n\nMoss Man features in the 2002 relaunch of Masters of the Universe as part of the cartoon series. He was not part of the new toy line, because it was cancelled before his figure could be released, although a limited edition figure was given away as a Mattel exclusive. As with the original figure, this was a repaint of the line's Beast Man figure, this time replacing the mace with a club that came with the line's Mekaneck figure. \n\nThe cartoon series depicts him as one of the most powerful beings on Eternia, possibly even more powerful than He-Man himself. He is introduced in the episode \"Orko's Garden\", in which he is an urban legend; an Eternian equivalent of the Green Man. He seems to be a kind of spirit who farmed and looked after the Eternian forestry and kept it in harmony. His rival in this episode is Evilseed, an evil counterpart who wants the plant world to overcome the human world. Moss Man's incredible powers help He-Man save the day, his power over all forms of vegetation able to overcome just about any obstacle. In a subsequent episode, \"The Last Stand\", he uses his abilities to save all the Masters from Skeletor's strongest trap yet. Given that he is so powerful, his appearances are sparse; only coming to the Masters' aid in times of desperation. \n\nMoss Man was released on March 15 as the March 2010 Figure of the Month for the Masters of the Universe Classics line of action figures. The figure includes two distinct head sculpts, one looking more like his 200x counterpart and the other like his 1980's Beast Man head (painted green & flocked). Originally, Mattel had reported that they had problems with the flocking - with the line's increased articulation, the flocking had caused some of the joins to cease. However, the final production figure was released with most of the body covered in \"moss\" flocking. \n\nA variant of the figure with flocked ears was also released in small, limited quantities.\n\nComic Book Resources listed the character as part of He-Man: 15 Most Powerful Masters of the Universe. CBR voted Moss-Man 7th worst He-Man toy.\n\nCracked thought poorly of Moss man.\n"}

His father, Pat Harrington Sr., was also an actor.\n\nHarrington was born in the New York City borough of Manhattan on August 13, 1929.\n\nHis father was a song and dance man who worked in vaudeville and performed on the Broadway stage. Harrington attended a Catholic military school, La Salle Military Academy in Oakdale, New York. then graduated from Fordham University in 1950 with a Bachelor of Arts and subsequently received a master's degree in political philosophy, also from Fordham. During the Korean War, Harrington served as an intelligence officer with the United States Air Force, where he achieved the rank of first lieutenant.\n\nFollowing in his father's footsteps, he pursued a career in entertainment after graduating from college and completing military service. He took a job at NBC in New York City. He then began acting on stage and toured North America with a number of plays, eventually performing on Broadway.\n\nHarrington became famous in the 1950s as a member of Steve Allen's television comedy troupe, the \"Men on the Street\" (which also included Don Knotts, Tom Poston and Louis Nye). He made many appearances as the comedic Italian immigrant \"Guido Panzini\" on \"The Jack Paar Show\" in the mid-1950s.

{"id": "24302", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24302", "title": "Pope Urban VI", "text": "Pope Urban VI\n\nPope Urban VI (; c. 1318 – 15 October 1389), born Bartolomeo Prignano (), was Pope from 8 April 1378 to his death in 1389. He is so far the last pope to be elected from outside the College of Cardinals. His reign, which began shortly after the end of the Avignon Papacy, was marked by immense conflict between rival factions as part of the Western Schism.\n\nBorn in Itri, Prignano was a devout monk and learned casuist, trained at Avignon. On 21 March 1364 he was consecrated Archbishop of Acerenza in the Kingdom of Naples. He became Archbishop of Bari in 1377.\n\nPrignano had developed a reputation for simplicity and frugality and a head for business when acting Vice-Chancellor. He also demonstrated a penchant for learning, and, according to Cristoforo di Piacenza, he was without \"famiglia\" in an age of nepotism, although once in the papal chair he elevated four cardinal-nephews and sought to place one of them in control of Naples. His great faults undid his virtues: Ludwig von Pastor summed up his character: \"He lacked Christian gentleness and charity. He was naturally arbitrary and extremely violent and imprudent, and when he came to deal with the burning ecclesiastical question of the day, that of reform, the consequences were disastrous.\"\n\nOn the death of Pope Gregory XI (27 March 1378), a Roman mob surrounded the papal conclave to demand a Roman pope. The cardinals being under some haste and great pressure to avoid the return of the Papal seat to Avignon, Prignano was unanimously chosen Pope on 8 April 1378 as acceptable to the disunited majority of French cardinals, taking the name Urban VI. Not being a Cardinal, he was not well known. Immediately following the conclave, most of the cardinals fled Rome before the mob could learn that not a Roman (though not a Frenchman either), but a subject of Queen Joan I of Naples, had been chosen.\n\nThough the coronation was carried out in scrupulous detail, leaving no doubt as to the legitimacy of the new pontiff, the French were not particularly happy with this move and began immediately to conspire against this Pope. Urban VI did himself no favors; whereas the cardinals had expected him pliant, he was considered arrogant and angry by many of his contemporaries. Dietrich of Nieheim reported the opinion of the cardinals that his elevation had turned his head, and Froissart, Leonardo Aretino, Tommaso de Acerno and St. Antoninus of Florence recorded similar conclusions.\n\nImmediately following his election, Urban began preaching intemperately to the cardinals (some of whom thought the delirium of power had made Urban mad and unfit for rule), insisting that the business of the Curia should be carried on without gratuities and gifts, forbidding the cardinals to accept annuities from rulers and other lay persons, condemning the luxury of their lives and retinues, and the multiplication of benefices and bishoprics in their hands. Nor would he remove again to Avignon, thus alienating King Charles V of France.\n\nThe cardinals were mortally offended. Five months after his election, the French cardinals met at Anagni, inviting Urban, who realized he would be seized, and perhaps slain. In his absence, they issued a manifesto of grievances on 9 August which declared his election invalid since they had been cowed by the mob into electing an Italian. Letters to the missing Italian cardinals followed on 20 August declaring the papal throne vacant (\"sede vacante\"). Then at Fondi, secretly supported by the king of France, the French cardinals proceeded to elect Robert of Geneva as Pope on 20 September. Robert, a militant cleric who had succeeded Albornoz as commander of the papal troops, took the name Clement VII, beginning the Western Schism, which divided Catholic Christendom until 1417.\n\nUrban was declared excommunicated by the French antipope and was called \"the Antichrist\", while Catherine of Siena, defending Pope Urban, called the cardinals \"devils in human form.\" Coluccio Salutati identified the political nature of the withdrawal: \"Who does not see,\" the Chancellor openly addressed the French cardinals, \"that you seek not the true pope, but opt solely for a Gallic pontiff.\" Opening rounds of argument were embodied in John of Legnano's defense of the election, \"De fletu ecclesiæ,\" written and incrementally revised between 1378 and 1380, which Urban caused to be distributed in multiple copies, and in the numerous rebuttals that soon appeared. Events overtook the rhetoric, however; 26 new cardinals were created in a single day, and by an arbitrary alienation of the estates and property of the church, funds were raised for open war. At the end of May 1379 Clement went to Avignon, where he was more than ever at the mercy of the king of France. Louis I, Duke of Anjou, was granted a phantom kingdom of Adria to be carved out of papal Emilia and Romagna, if he could unseat the pope at Rome.\n\nMeanwhile, the War of the Eight Saints, carried on with spates of unprecedented cruelty to civilians, was draining the resources of Florence, though the city ignored the interdict placed upon it by Gregory, declared its churches open, and sold ecclesiastical property for 100,000 florins to finance the war. Bologna had submitted to the Church in August 1377, and Florence signed a treaty at Tivoli on 28 July 1378 at a cost of 200,000 florins indemnity extorted by Urban for the restitution of church properties, receiving in return the papal favor and the lifting of the disregarded interdict.\n\nUrban's erstwhile patroness, Queen Joan I of Naples, deserted him in the late summer of 1378, in part because her former archbishop had become her feudal suzerain. Urban now lost sight of the larger issues and began to commit a series of errors. He turned upon his powerful neighbor Joan, excommunicated her as an obstinate partisan of Clement, and permitted a crusade to be preached against her. Soon her enemy and cousin, the \"crafty and ambitious\" Charles of Durazzo, representing the Sicilian Angevin line, was made sovereign over the Kingdom of Naples on 1 June 1381, and was crowned by Urban. Joan's authority was declared forfeit, and Charles murdered her in 1382. \"In return for these favours, Charles had to promise to hand over Capua, Caserta, Aversa, Nocera, and Amalfi to the pope's nephew, a thoroughly worthless and immoral man.\"\nOnce ensconced at Naples, Charles found his new kingdom invaded by Louis of Anjou and Amadeus VI of Savoy; hard-pressed, he reneged on his promises. In Rome, the Castel Sant'Angelo was besieged and taken, and Urban was forced to flee. In the fall of 1383 he was determined to go to Naples and press Charles in person. There he found himself virtually a prisoner. After a first reconciliation, with the death of Louis (20 September 1384), Charles found himself freer to resist Urban's feudal pretensions, and relations took a turn for the worse. Urban was shut up in Nocera, from the walls of which he daily fulminated his anathemas against his besiegers, with bell, book and candle; a price was set on his head.\n\nRescued by two Neapolitan barons who had sided for Louis, Raimondello Orsini and Tommaso di Sanseverino, after six months of siege he succeeded in making his escape to Genoa with six galleys sent him by doge Antoniotto Adorno. Several among his cardinals who had been shut up in Nocera with him were determined to make a stand, proposing that the Pope, due to incapacity and obstinacy, be put in the charge of one of the cardinals. Urban had them seized, tortured and put to death, \"a crime unheard of through the centuries\" the chronicler Egidio da Viterbo remarked.\n\nUrban's support had dwindled to the northern Italian states, Portugal, England, and Holy Roman Emperor Charles IV, who brought with him the support of most of the princes and abbots of Germany.\n\nOn the death of Charles of Naples on 24 February 1386, Urban moved to Lucca in December of the same year. The Kingdom of Naples was contended between a party favouring his son Ladislaus and Louis II of Anjou. Urban contrived to take advantage of the anarchy which had ensued (as well as of the presence of the feeble Maria as Queen of Sicily) to seize Naples for his nephew Francesco Moricotti Prignani. In the meantime he was able to have Viterbo and Perugia return to the Papal control.\n\nIn August 1388 Urban moved from Perugia with thousands of troops. To raise funds he had proclaimed a Jubilee to be held in 1390. At the time of the proclamation, only 38 years had elapsed since the previous Jubilee, which was celebrated under Clement VI. During the march, Urban fell from his mule at Narni and had to recover in early October in Rome, where he was able to oust the communal rule of the \"banderesi\" and restore the Papal authority. He died soon afterwards, likely of injuries caused by the fall, but not without rumors of poisoning. It is noteworthy that during the reconstruction of Saint Peter's Basilica, Urban's remains were almost dumped out to be destroyed so his sarcophagus could be used to water horses. The sarcophagus was saved only when church historian Giacomo Grimaldi arrived and, realizing its importance, ordered it preserved.\n\nPope Urban VI's successor was Pope Boniface IX.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "827792", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=827792", "title": "Rare Earth hypothesis", "text": "Rare Earth hypothesis\n\nIn planetary astronomy and astrobiology, the Rare Earth hypothesis argues that the origin of life and the evolution of biological complexity such as sexually reproducing, multicellular organisms on Earth (and, subsequently, human intelligence) required an improbable combination of astrophysical and geological events and circumstances.\n\nAccording to the hypothesis, complex extraterrestrial life is an improbable phenomenon and likely to be rare. The term \"Rare Earth\" originates from \"Rare Earth: Why Complex Life Is Uncommon in the Universe\" (2000), a book by Peter Ward, a geologist and paleontologist, and Donald E. Brownlee, an astronomer and astrobiologist, both faculty members at the University of Washington.\n\nA contrary view was argued in the 1970s and 1980s by Carl Sagan and Frank Drake, among others. It holds that Earth is a typical rocky planet in a typical planetary system, located in a non-exceptional region of a common barred-spiral galaxy. Given the principle of mediocrity (in the same vein as the Copernican principle), it is probable that we are typical, and the universe teems with complex life. However, Ward and Brownlee argue that planets, planetary systems, and galactic regions that are as friendly to complex life as the Earth, the Solar System, and our galactic region are rare.\n\nThe Rare Earth hypothesis argues that the evolution of biological complexity requires a host of fortuitous circumstances, such as a galactic habitable zone, a central star and planetary system having the requisite character, the circumstellar habitable zone, a right-sized terrestrial planet, the advantage of a gas giant guardian like Jupiter and a large natural satellite, conditions needed to ensure the planet has a magnetosphere and plate tectonics, the chemistry of the lithosphere, atmosphere, and oceans, the role of \"evolutionary pumps\" such as massive glaciation and rare bolide impacts, and whatever led to the appearance of the eukaryote cell, sexual reproduction and the Cambrian explosion of animal, plant, and fungi phyla. The evolution of human intelligence may have required yet further events, which are extremely unlikely to have happened were it not for the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event 66 million years ago removing dinosaurs as the dominant terrestrial vertebrates.\n\nIn order for a small rocky planet to support complex life, Ward and Brownlee argue, the values of several variables must fall within narrow ranges. The universe is so vast that it could contain many Earth-like planets. But if such planets exist, they are likely to be separated from each other by many thousands of light years. Such distances may preclude communication among any intelligent species evolving on such planets, which would solve the Fermi paradox: \"If extraterrestrial aliens are common, why aren't they obvious?\"\n\n\"Rare Earth\" suggests that much of the known universe, including large parts of our galaxy, are \"dead zones\" unable to support complex life. Those parts of a galaxy where complex life is possible make up the galactic habitable zone, primarily characterized by distance from the Galactic Center. As that distance increases:\nItem #1 rules out the outer reaches of a galaxy; #2 and #3 rule out galactic inner regions. Hence a galaxy's habitable zone may be a ring sandwiched between its uninhabitable center and outer reaches.\n\nAlso, a habitable planetary system must maintain its favorable location long enough for complex life to evolve. A star with an eccentric (elliptic or hyperbolic) galactic orbit will pass through some spiral arms, unfavorable regions of high star density; thus a life-bearing star must have a galactic orbit that is nearly circular, with a close synchronization between the orbital velocity of the star and of the spiral arms. This further restricts the galactic habitable zone within a fairly narrow range of distances from the Galactic Center. Lineweaver et al. calculate this zone to be a ring 7 to 9 kiloparsecs in radius, including no more than 10% of the stars in the Milky Way, about 20 to 40 billion stars. Gonzalez, et al. would halve these numbers; they estimate that at most 5% of stars in the Milky Way fall in the galactic habitable zone.\n\nApproximately 77% of observed galaxies are spiral, two-thirds of all spiral galaxies are barred, and more than half, like the Milky Way, exhibit multiple arms. According to Rare Earth, our own galaxy is unusually quiet and dim (see below), representing just 7% of its kind. Even so, this would still represent more than 200 billion galaxies in the known universe.\n\nOur galaxy also appears unusually favorable in suffering fewer collisions with other galaxies over the last 10 billion years, which can cause more supernovae and other disturbances. Also, the Milky Way's central black hole seems to have neither too much nor too little activity.\n\nThe orbit of the Sun around the center of the Milky Way is indeed almost perfectly circular, with a period of 226 Ma (million years), closely matching the rotational period of the galaxy. However, the majority of stars in barred spiral galaxies populate the spiral arms rather than the halo and tend to move in gravitationally aligned orbits, so there is little that is unusual about the Sun's orbit. While the Rare Earth hypothesis predicts that the Sun should rarely, if ever, have passed through a spiral arm since its formation, astronomer Karen Masters has calculated that the orbit of the Sun takes it through a major spiral arm approximately every 100 million years. Some researchers have suggested that several mass extinctions do correspond with previous crossings of the spiral arms.\n\nThe terrestrial example suggests that complex life requires liquid water, requiring an orbital distance neither too close nor too far from the central star, another scale of habitable zone or Goldilocks Principle: \nThe habitable zone varies with the star's type and age.\n\nFor advanced life, the star must also be highly stable, which is typical of middle star life, about 4.6 billion years old. Proper metallicity and size are also important to stability. The Sun has a low 0.1% luminosity variation. To date no solar twin star twin, with an exact match of the sun's luminosity variation, has been found, though some come close. The star must have no stellar companions, as in binary systems, which would disrupt the orbits of planets. Estimates suggest 50% or more of all star systems are binary. The habitable zone for a main sequence star very gradually moves out over its lifespan until it becomes a white dwarf and the habitable zone vanishes.\n\nThe liquid water and other gases available in the habitable zone bring the benefit of greenhouse warming. Even though the Earth's atmosphere contains a water vapor concentration from 0% (in arid regions) to 4% (in rain forest and ocean regions) and – as of February 2018 – only 408.05 parts per million of , these small amounts suffice to raise the average surface temperature by about 40 °C, with the dominant contribution being due to water vapor, which together with clouds makes up between 66% and 85% of Earth's greenhouse effect, with contributing between 9% and 26% of the effect.\n\nRocky planets must orbit within the habitable zone for life to form. Although the habitable zone of such hot stars as Sirius or Vega is wide, hot stars also emit much more ultraviolet radiation that ionizes any planetary atmosphere. They may become red giants before advanced life evolves on their planets.\nThese considerations rule out the massive and powerful stars of type F6 to O (see stellar classification) as homes to evolved metazoan life.\n\nSmall red dwarf stars conversely have small habitable zones wherein planets are in tidal lock, with one very hot side always facing the star and another very cold side; and they are also at increased risk of solar flares (see Aurelia). Life therefore cannot arise in such systems. Rare Earth proponents claim that only stars from F7 to K1 types are hospitable. Such stars are rare: G type stars such as the Sun (between the hotter F and cooler K) comprise only 9% of the hydrogen-burning stars in the Milky Way.\n\nSuch aged stars as red giants and white dwarfs are also unlikely to support life. Red giants are common in globular clusters and elliptical galaxies. White dwarfs are mostly dying stars that have already completed their red giant phase. Stars that become red giants expand into or overheat the habitable zones of their youth and middle age (though theoretically planets at a much greater distance may become habitable).\n\nAn energy output that varies with the lifetime of the star will likely prevent life (e.g., as Cepheid variables). A sudden decrease, even if brief, may freeze the water of orbiting planets, and a significant increase may evaporate it and cause a greenhouse effect that prevents the oceans from reforming.\n\nAll known life requires the complex chemistry of metallic elements. The absorption spectrum of a star reveals the presence of metals within, and studies of stellar spectra reveal that many, perhaps most, stars are poor in metals. Because heavy metals originate in supernova explosions, metallicity increases in the universe over time. Low metallicity characterizes the early universe: globular clusters and other stars that formed when the universe was young, stars in most galaxies other than large spirals, and stars in the outer regions of all galaxies. Metal-rich central stars capable of supporting complex life are therefore believed to be most common in the quiet suburbs of the larger spiral galaxies—where radiation also happens to be weak.\n\nRare Earth proponents argue that a planetary system capable of sustaining complex life must be structured more or less like the Solar System, with small and rocky inner planets and outer gas giants. Without the protection of 'celestial vacuum cleaner' planets with strong gravitational pull, a planet would be subject to more catastrophic asteroid collisions.\n\nObservations of exo-planets have shown that arrangements of planets similar to our Solar System are rare. Most planetary systems have super Earths, several times larger than Earth, close to their star, whereas our Solar System's inner region has only a few small rocky planets and none inside Mercury's orbit. Only 10% of stars have giant planets similar to Jupiter and Saturn, and those few rarely have stable nearly circular orbits distant from their star. Konstantin Batygin and colleagues argue that these features can be explained if, early in the history of the Solar System, Jupiter and Saturn drifted towards the Sun, sending showers of planetesimals towards the super-Earths which sent them spiralling into the Sun, and ferrying icy building blocks into the terrestrial region of the Solar System which provided the building blocks for the rocky planets. The two giant planets then drifted out again to their present position. However, in the view of Batygin and his colleagues: \"The concatenation of chance events required for this delicate choreography suggest that small, Earth-like rocky planets – and perhaps life itself – could be rare throughout the cosmos.\"\n\nRare Earth argues that a gas giant must not be too close to a body where life is developing. Close placement of gas giant(s) could disrupt the orbit of a potential life-bearing planet, either directly or by drifting into the habitable zone.\n\nNewtonian dynamics can produce chaotic planetary orbits, especially in a system having large planets at high orbital eccentricity.\n\nThe need for stable orbits rules out stars with systems of planets that contain large planets with orbits close to the host star (called \"hot Jupiters\"). It is believed that hot Jupiters have migrated inwards to their current orbits. In the process, they would have catastrophically disrupted the orbits of any planets in the habitable zone. To exacerbate matters, hot Jupiters are much more common orbiting F and G class stars.\n\nIt is argued that life requires terrestrial planets like Earth and as gas giants lack such a surface, that complex life cannot arise there.\n\nA planet that is too small cannot hold much atmosphere, making surface temperature low and variable and oceans impossible. A small planet will also tend to have a rough surface, with large mountains and deep canyons. The core will cool faster, and plate tectonics may be brief or entirely absent. A planet that is too large will retain too dense an atmosphere like Venus. Although Venus is similar in size and mass to Earth, its surface atmospheric pressure is 92 times that of Earth, and surface temperature of 735 K (462 °C; 863 °F). Earth had a similar early atmosphere to Venus, but may have lost it in the giant impact event.\n\nRare Earth proponents argue that plate tectonics and a strong magnetic field are essential for biodiversity, global temperature regulation, and the carbon cycle.\nThe lack of mountain chains elsewhere in the Solar System is direct evidence that Earth is the only body with plate tectonics, and thus the only nearby body capable of supporting life.\n\nPlate tectonics depend on the right chemical composition and a long-lasting source of heat from radioactive decay. Continents must be made of less dense felsic rocks that \"float\" on underlying denser mafic rock. Taylor emphasizes that tectonic subduction zones require the lubrication of oceans of water. Plate tectonics also provides a means of biochemical cycling.\n\nPlate tectonics and as a result continental drift and the creation of separate land masses would create diversified ecosystems and biodiversity, one of the strongest defences against extinction. An example of species diversification and later competition on Earth's continents is the Great American Interchange. North and Middle America drifted into South America at around 3.5 to 3 Ma. The fauna of South America evolved separately for about 30 million years, since Antarctica separated. Many species were subsequently wiped out in mainly South America by competing Northern American animals.\n\nThe Moon is unusual because the other rocky planets in the Solar System either have no satellites (Mercury and Venus), or only tiny satellites which are probably captured asteroids (Mars).\n\nThe Giant-impact theory hypothesizes that the Moon resulted from the impact of a Mars-sized body, dubbed Theia, with the young Earth. This giant impact also gave the Earth its axial tilt (inclination) and velocity of rotation. Rapid rotation reduces the daily variation in temperature and makes photosynthesis viable. The \"Rare Earth\" hypothesis further argues that the axial tilt cannot be too large or too small (relative to the orbital plane). A planet with a large tilt will experience extreme seasonal variations in climate. A planet with little or no tilt will lack the stimulus to evolution that climate variation provides. In this view, the Earth's tilt is \"just right\". The gravity of a large satellite also stabilizes the planet's tilt; without this effect the variation in tilt would be chaotic, probably making complex life forms on land impossible.\n\nIf the Earth had no Moon, the ocean tides resulting solely from the Sun's gravity would be only half that of the lunar tides. A large satellite gives rise to tidal pools, which may be essential for the formation of complex life, though this is far from certain.\n\nA large satellite also increases the likelihood of plate tectonics through the effect of tidal forces on the planet's crust. The impact that formed the Moon may also have initiated plate tectonics, without which the continental crust would cover the entire planet, leaving no room for oceanic crust. It is possible that the large scale mantle convection needed to drive plate tectonics could not have emerged in the absence of crustal inhomogeneity. A further theory indicates that such a large moon may also contribute to maintaining a planet's magnetic shield by continually acting upon a metallic planetary core as dynamo, thus protecting the surface of the planet from charged particles and cosmic rays, and helping to ensure the atmosphere is not stripped over time by solar winds.\n\nA terrestrial planet of the right size is needed to retain an atmosphere, like Earth and Venus. On Earth, once the giant impact of Theia thinned Earth's atmosphere, other events were needed to make the atmosphere capable of sustaining life. The Late Heavy Bombardment reseeded Earth with water lost after the impact of Theia. The development of an ozone layer formed protection from ultraviolet (UV) sunlight. Nitrogen and carbon dioxide are needed in a correct ratio for life to form. Lightning is needed for nitrogen fixation. The carbon dioxide gas needed for life comes from sources such as volcanoes and geysers. Carbon dioxide is only needed at low levels (currently at 400 ppm); at high levels it is poisonous. Precipitation is needed to have a stable water cycle. A proper atmosphere must reduce diurnal temperature variation.\n\nRegardless of whether planets with similar physical attributes to the Earth are rare or not, some argue that life usually remains simple bacteria. Biochemist Nick Lane argues that simple cells (prokaryotes) emerged soon after Earth's formation, but since almost half the planet's life had passed before they evolved into complex ones (eukaryotes) all of whom share a common ancestor, this event can only have happened once. In some views, prokaryotes lack the cellular architecture to evolve into eukaryotes because a bacterium expanded up to eukaryotic proportions would have tens of thousands of times less energy available; two billion years ago, one simple cell incorporated itself into another, multiplied, and evolved into mitochondria that supplied the vast increase in available energy that enabled the evolution of complex life. If this incorporation occurred only once in four billion years or is otherwise unlikely, then life on most planets remains simple. An alternative view is that mitochondria evolution was environmentally triggered, and that mitochondria-containing organisms appeared soon after the first traces of atmospheric oxygen.\n\nThe evolution and persistence of sexual reproduction is another mystery in biology. The purpose of sexual reproduction is unclear, as in many organisms it has a 50% cost (fitness disadvantage) in relation to asexual reproduction. Mating types (types of gametes, according to their compatibility) may have arisen as a result of anisogamy (gamete dimorphism), or the male and female genders may have evolved before anisogamy. It is also unknown why most sexual organisms use a binary mating system, and why some organisms have gamete dimorphism. Charles Darwin was the first to suggest that sexual selection drives speciation; without it, complex life would probably not have evolved.\n\nWhile life on Earth is regarded to have spawned relatively early in the planet's history, the evolution from multicellular to intelligent organisms took around 800 million years. Civilizations on Earth have existed for about 12,000 years and radio communication reaching space has existed for less than 100 years. Relative to the age of the Solar System (~4.57 Ga) this is a short time, in which extreme climatic variations, super volcanoes, and large meteorite impacts were absent. These events would severely harm intelligent life, as well as life in general. For example, the Permian-Triassic mass extinction, caused by widespread and continuous volcanic eruptions in an area the size of Western Europe, led to the extinction of 95% of known species around 251.2 Ma ago. About 65 million years ago, the Chicxulub impact at the Cretaceous–Paleogene boundary (~65.5 Ma) on the Yucatán peninsula in Mexico led to a mass extinction of the most advanced species at that time.\n\nIf there were intelligent extraterrestrial civilizations able to make contact with distant Earth, they would have to live in the same 12Ka period of the 800Ma evolution of life.\n\nThe following discussion is adapted from Cramer. The Rare Earth equation is Ward and Brownlee's riposte to the Drake equation. It calculates formula_1, the number of Earth-like planets in the Milky Way having complex life forms, as:\n\nwhere:\nWe assume formula_5. The Rare Earth hypothesis can then be viewed as asserting that the product of the other nine Rare Earth equation factors listed below, which are all fractions, is no greater than 10 and could plausibly be as small as 10. In the latter case, formula_1 could be as small as 0 or 1. Ward and Brownlee do not actually calculate the value of formula_1, because the numerical values of quite a few of the factors below can only be conjectured. They cannot be estimated simply because we have but one data point: the Earth, a rocky planet orbiting a G2 star in a quiet suburb of a large barred spiral galaxy, and the home of the only intelligent species we know, namely ourselves.\n\nThe Rare Earth equation, unlike the Drake equation, does not factor the probability that complex life evolves into intelligent life that discovers technology (Ward and Brownlee are not evolutionary biologists). Barrow and Tipler review the consensus among such biologists that the evolutionary path from primitive Cambrian chordates, e.g., \"Pikaia\" to \"Homo sapiens\", was a highly improbable event. For example, the large brains of humans have marked adaptive disadvantages, requiring as they do an expensive metabolism, a long gestation period, and a childhood lasting more than 25% of the average total life span. Other improbable features of humans include:\n\nWriters who support the Rare Earth hypothesis:\n\nCases against the Rare Earth Hypothesis take various forms.\n\nThe hypothesis concludes, more or less, that complex life is rare because it can evolve only on the surface of an Earth-like planet or on a suitable satellite of a planet. Some biologists, such as Jack Cohen, believe this assumption too restrictive and unimaginative; they see it as a form of circular reasoning.\n\nAccording to David Darling, the Rare Earth hypothesis is neither hypothesis nor prediction, but merely a description of how life arose on Earth. In his view Ward and Brownlee have done nothing more than select the factors that best suit their case.\n\nWhat matters is not whether there's anything unusual about the Earth; there's going to be something idiosyncratic about every planet in space. What matters is whether any of Earth's circumstances are not only unusual but also essential for complex life. So far we've seen nothing to suggest there is.\n\nCritics also argue that there is a link between the Rare Earth Hypothesis and the creationist ideas of intelligent design.\n\nAn increasing number of extrasolar planet discoveries are being made with planets in planetary systems known as of . Rare Earth proponents argue life cannot arise outside Sun-like systems. However, some exobiologists have suggested that stars outside this range may give rise to life under the right circumstances; this possibility is a central point of contention to the theory because these late-K and M category stars make up about 82% of all hydrogen-burning stars.\n\nCurrent technology limits the testing of important Rare Earth criteria: surface water, tectonic plates, a large moon and biosignatures are currently undetectable. Though planets the size of Earth are difficult to detect and classify, scientists now think that rocky planets are common around Sun-like stars. The Earth Similarity Index (ESI) of mass, radius and temperature provides a means of measurement, but falls short of the full Rare Earth criteria.\n\nSome argue that Rare Earth's estimates of rocky planets in habitable zones (formula_3 in the Rare Earth equation) are too restrictive. James Kasting cites the Titius-Bode law to contend that it is a misnomer to describe habitable zones as narrow when there is a 50% chance of at least one planet orbiting within one. In 2013 a study that was published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences calculated that about \"one in five\" of all sun-like stars are expected to have earthlike planets \"within the habitable zones of their stars\"; 8.8 billion of them therefore exist in the Milky Way galaxy alone. On 4 November 2013, astronomers reported, based on \"Kepler\" space mission data, that there could be as many as 40 billion Earth-sized planets orbiting in the habitable zones of sun-like stars and red dwarf stars within the Milky Way Galaxy. 11 billion of these estimated planets may be orbiting sun-like stars.\n\nThe requirement for a system to have a Jovian planet as protector (Rare Earth equation factor formula_15) has been challenged, affecting the number of proposed extinction events (Rare Earth equation factor formula_16). Kasting's 2001 review of Rare Earth questions whether a Jupiter protector has any bearing on the incidence of complex life. Computer modelling including the 2005 Nice model and 2007 Nice 2 model yield inconclusive results in relation to Jupiter's gravitational influence and impacts on the inner planets. A study by Horner and Jones (2008) using computer simulation found that while the total effect on all orbital bodies within the Solar System is unclear, Jupiter has caused more impacts on Earth than it has prevented. Lexell's Comet, a 1770 near miss that passed closer to Earth than any other comet in recorded history, was known to be caused by the gravitational influence of Jupiter. Grazier (2017) claims that the idea of Jupiter as a shield is a misinterpretation of a 1996 study by George Wetherill, and using computer models Grazier was able to demonstrate that Saturn protects Earth from more asteroids and comets than does Jupiter.\n\nWard and Brownlee argue that for complex life to evolve (Rare Earth equation factor formula_12), tectonics must be present to generate biogeochemical cycles, and predicted that such geological features would not be found outside of Earth, pointing to a lack of observable mountain ranges and subduction. There is, however, no scientific consensus on the evolution of plate tectonics on Earth. Though it is believed that tectonic motion first began around three billion years ago, by this time photosynthesis and oxygenation had already begun. Furthermore, recent studies point to plate tectonics as an episodic planetary phenomenon, and that life may evolve during periods of \"stagnant-lid\" rather than plate tectonic states.\n\nRecent evidence also points to similar activity either having occurred or continuing to occur elsewhere. The geology of Pluto, for example, described by Ward and Brownlee as \"without mountains or volcanoes ... devoid of volcanic activity\", has since been found to be quite the contrary, with a geologically active surface possessing organic molecules and mountain ranges like Tenzing Montes and Hillary Montes comparable in relative size to those of Earth, and observations suggest the involvement of endogenic processes. Plate tectonics has been suggested as a hypothesis for the Martian dichotomy, and in 2012 geologist An Yin put forward evidence for active plate tectonics on Mars. Europa has long been suspected to have plate tectonics and in 2014 NASA announced evidence of active subduction. In 2017, scientists studying the geology of Charon confirmed that icy plate tectonics also operated on Pluto's largest moon.\n\nKasting suggests that there is nothing unusual about the occurrence of plate tectonics in large rocky planets and liquid water on the surface as most should generate internal heat even without the assistance of radioactive elements. Studies by Valencia and Cowan suggest that plate tectonics may be inevitable for terrestrial planets Earth sized or larger, that is, Super-Earths, which are now known to be more common in planetary systems.\n\nThe hypothesis that molecular oxygen, necessary for animal life, is rare and that a Great Oxygenation Event (Rare Earth equation factor formula_12) could only have been triggered and sustained by tectonics, appears to have been invalidated by more recent discoveries.\n\nWard and Brownlee ask \"whether oxygenation, and hence the rise of animals, would ever have occurred on a world where there were no continents to erode\". Extraterrestrial free oxygen has recently been detected around other solid objects, including Mercury, Venus, Mars Jupiter's four Galilean moons, Saturn's moons Enceladus, Dione and Rhea and even the atmosphere of a comet. This has led scientists to speculate whether processes other than photosynthesis could be capable of generating an environment rich in free oxygen. Wordsworth (2014) concludes that oxygen generated other than through photodissociation may be likely on Earth-like exoplanets, and could actually lead to false positive detections of life. Narita (2015) suggests photocatalysis by titanium dioxide as a geochemical mechanism for producing oxygen atmospheres.\n\nSince Ward & Brownlee's assertion that \"there is irrefutable evidence that oxygen is a necessary ingredient for animal life\", anaerobic metazoa have been found that indeed do metabolise without oxygen. Spinoloricus nov. sp., for example, a species discovered in the hypersaline anoxic L'Atalante basin at the bottom of the Mediterranean Sea in 2010, appears to metabolise with hydrogen, lacking mitochondria and instead using hydrogenosomes. Stevenson (2015) has proposed other membrane alternatives for complex life in worlds without oxygen. In 2017, scientists from the NASA Astrobiology Institute discovered the necessary chemical preconditions for the formation of azotosomes on Saturn's moon Titan, a world that lacks atmospheric oxygen. Independent studies by Schirrmeister and by Mills concluded that Earth's multicellular life existed prior to the Great Oxygenation Event, not as a consequence of it.\n\nNASA scientists Hartman and McKay argue that plate tectonics may in fact slow the rise of oxygenation (and thus stymie complex life rather than promote it). Computer modelling by Tilman Spohn in 2014 found that plate tectonics on Earth may have arisen from the effects of complex life's emergence, rather than the other way around as the Rare Earth might suggest. The action of lichens on rock may have contributed to the formation of subduction zones in the presence of water. Kasting argues that if oxygenation caused the Cambrian explosion then any planet with oxygen producing photosynthesis should have complex life.\n\nThe importance of Earth's magnetic field to the development of complex life has been disputed. Kasting argues that the atmosphere provides sufficient protection against cosmic rays even during times of magnetic pole reversal and atmosphere loss by sputtering. Kasting also dismisses the role of the magnetic field in the evolution of eukaryotes, citing the age of the oldest known magnetofossils.\n\nThe requirement of a large moon (Rare Earth equation factor formula_14) has also been challenged. Even if it were required, such an occurrence may not be as unique as predicted by the Rare Earth Hypothesis. Recent work by Edward Belbruno and J. Richard Gott of Princeton University suggests that giant impactors such as those that may have formed the Moon can indeed form in planetary trojan points ( or Lagrangian point) which means that similar circumstances may occur in other planetary systems.\n\nRare Earth's assertion that the Moon's stabilization of Earth's obliquity and spin is a requirement for complex life has been questioned. Kasting argues that a moonless Earth would still possess habitats with climates suitable for complex life and questions whether the spin rate of a moonless Earth can be predicted. Although the giant impact theory posits that the impact forming the Moon increased Earth's rotational speed to make a day about 5 hours long, the Moon has slowly \"stolen\" much of this speed to reduce Earth's solar day since then to about 24 hours and continues to do so: in 100 million years Earth's solar day will be roughly 24 hours 38 minutes (the same as Mars's solar day); in 1 billion years, 30 hours 23 minutes. Larger secondary bodies would exert proportionally larger tidal forces that would in turn decelerate their primaries faster and potentially increase the solar day of a planet in all other respects like Earth to over 120 hours within a few billion years. This long solar day would make effective heat dissipation for organisms in the tropics and subtropics extremely difficult in a similar manner to tidal locking to a red dwarf star. Short days (high rotation speed) causes high wind speeds at ground level. Long days (slow rotation speed) cause the day and night temperatures to be too extreme.\n\nMany Rare Earth proponents argue that the Earth's plate tectonics would probably not exist if not for the tidal forces of the Moon. The hypothesis that the Moon's tidal influence initiated or sustained Earth's plate tectonics remains unproven, though at least one study implies a temporal correlation to the formation of the Moon. Evidence for the past existence of plate tectonics on planets like Mars which may never have had a large moon would counter this argument. Kasting argues that a large moon is not required to initiate plate tectonics.\n\nRare Earth proponents argue that simple life may be common, though complex life requires specific environmental conditions to arise. Critics consider life could arise on a moon of a gas giant, though this is less likely if life requires volcanicity. The moon must have stresses to induce tidal heating, but not so dramatic as seen on Jupiter's Io. However, the moon is within the gas giant's intense radiation belts, sterilizing any biodiversity before it can get established. Dirk Schulze-Makuch disputes this, hypothesizing alternative biochemistries for alien life. While Rare Earth proponents argue that only microbial extremophiles could exist in subsurface habitats beyond Earth, some argue that complex life can also arise in these environments. Examples of extremophile animals such as the \"Hesiocaeca methanicola\", an animal that inhabits ocean floor methane clathrates substances more commonly found in the outer Solar System, the tardigrades which can survive in the vacuum of space or \"Halicephalobus mephisto\" which exists in crushing pressure, scorching temperatures and extremely low oxygen levels 3.6 kilometres deep in the Earth's crust, are sometimes cited by critics as complex life capable of thriving in \"alien\" environments. Jill Tarter counters the classic counterargument that these species adapted to these environments rather than arose in them, by suggesting that we cannot assume conditions for life to emerge which are not actually known. There are suggestions that complex life could arise in sub-surface conditions which may be similar to those where life may have arisen on Earth, such as the tidally heated subsurfaces of Europa or Enceladus. Ancient circumvental ecosystems such as these support complex life on Earth such as Riftia pachyptila that exist completely independent of the surface biosphere.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "838443", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=838443", "title": "Reavers (comics)", "text": "Reavers (comics)\n\nThe Reavers are a fictional team of criminal cyborgs appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The most significant team of Reavers were dedicated to the destruction of the mutant X-Men, and a number of them especially wanted to take revenge on one particular X-Man, Wolverine. The name was originally used by a gang of Australian cyborgs. The name later referred to a group under the leadership of Donald Pierce, consisting of the three survivors from the original Reavers along with other cyborgs.\n\nThese Reavers should not be confused with the Reavers of the planet Arcturus IV, who exist in the future of the alternate reality Earth-691 and are involved in the histories of the Guardians of the Galaxy members Starhawk and Aleta.\n\nThe Reavers first appeared in \"Uncanny X-Men\" #229 and was created by Chris Claremont and Marc Silvestri.\n\nThe first group of cyborgs calling themselves the Reavers operated out of an underground complex beneath the ghost town of Cooterman's Creek in North Central Australia. The Reavers acted as a commando-style team of thieves, with apparently dozens of members. Their base was inexplicably equipped with advanced computers and a sub-basement and tunnel system. The Reavers coerced the mutant teleporter Gateway to teleport them from Australia to locations around the world to conduct their robberies. Informed of the Reavers' existence by Roma, the X-Men defeat the Reavers in battle and expel them from their base, which they then co-opt for their own use. The X-Men destroy some of the Reavers and force most of the rest to enter the mystical Siege Perilous to meet unrevealed fates. Only Pretty Boy, Skullbuster, and Bonebreaker escape.\n\nThe Reavers are reassembled under the leadership of Donald Pierce, who reorganizes the team as an assassination squadron to undertake para-military style commando operations, dedicated to taking vengeance on the X-Men in particular and eliminating mutants in general. Pierce combines the three survivors of the original Reavers with Lady Deathstrike and the three former Hellfire Club mercenaries Cole, Macon, and Reese. No explanation is given for why Pretty Boy, Skullbuster, and Bonebreaker came to be involved with the group, aside from Pierce claiming to have created the original Reavers. Lady Deathstrike's reasons for joining the Reavers are even more unclear, as she professes a lack of interest in their goal of eliminating mutants.\n\nWhile the X-Men are away from their Australian base, the Reavers retake the ghost town and wait for the team to come back. However, on their return the X-Men escape the Reavers through the Siege Perilous. Only Wolverine, who is on a leave of absence in Madripoor, remains. Once he returns, they capture him, and proceed to torture and crucify him. Wolverine escapes the Reavers with the aid of Jubilee. The Reavers then attack the Muir Island Mutant Research Center, theorizing that it is Wolverine's most likely destination. They fight Freedom Force and Moira MacTaggart's alternate X-Men team, and kill Stonewall and Sunder. During the assault on Muir Island, Skullbuster is rendered inoperative by sniper fire from Forge. Donald Pierce rescues a gravely wounded pilot named Cylla Markham, who agrees to be converted into a cyborg.\n\nAround this time, Bonebreaker, Reese, and Pretty Boy are dispatched to a New York warehouse after Microchip, an associate of the Punisher, in a self-confessed mistake, infiltrates their computer system. The temporary absence of Gateway gives Punisher and Microchip enough time to evacuate and set up resistance. The warehouse is destroyed, but the two escape through the sewer. The Reavers face off against the Punisher again. In the firefight, the Reavers kill Microchip's cousin. The Punisher sets off auto-destruct charges which cause heavy damage to the three Reavers, particularly Bonebreaker, whose cybernetic lower body is demolished. The Reavers retreat.\n\nThe Reavers then successfully attack the White Queen's company, Frost Technotics. They capture Rogue, who has returned from inside the Siege Perilous, although Rogue is then rescued by a recreation of Ms. Marvel. Donald Pierce transforms Cylla Markham into the new Skullbuster (although she usually goes by the name Cylla). Lady Deathstrike later seeks Wolverine in Madripoor and Vancouver. Pierce creates an android named Elsie-Dee and a Wolverine android double named \"Albert\" to kill Wolverine. The attempt fails, however, when Elsie-Dee rebels against her programming.\n\nAs part of the Upstarts' game, Trevor Fitzroy dispatches his own Sentinels to the Reavers' Australian hideout to kill Pierce and anyone else they find there. In the ensuing battle, only Pierce, Lady Deathstrike and Cylla escape the massacre, Pierce seemingly only making it as far as the Hellfire Club before he is \"killed\". Cylla later resurfaces, allying herself with Bloodscream in an attempt to murder Wolverine. However, Bloodscream betrays her and sucks the life from her, killing her.\n\nHowever, most Reavers somehow survive their supposed deaths. They later return to battle the X-Treme X-Men on behalf of the Shadow King.\n\nDonald Pierce puts together a new group of Reavers, composed of young anti-mutant humans (with the exception of Elixir, who at the time was unaware that he was a mutant). They are defeated by Karma, Elixir, and a handful of young mutants. The group later breaks Pierce out of prison, but with Elixir as bait, they are lured into an ambush and captured by the same five mutants who stopped Pierce when he first betrayed the Hellfire Club's Inner Circle.\n\nThe Reavers return to play a role in the event, under the leadership of Lady Deathstrike. Judging from the design of their costumes, as well as their rhetoric in battle, these newest Reavers are simply existing members of the Purifiers upgraded with cybernetics rather than classic members of the team. Deployed as an elite commando unit designed to eliminate organized mutant resistance, the Reavers manage to track down and confront Cable in Alberta, Canada before being attacked by the new X-Force.\n\nIn the ensuing battle, Deathstrike and the Reavers are all terminated by Wolverine's strike team, but not before killing the mutant Caliban and injuring Cable. To this date only Deathstrike's fate was revealed and it remains to be seen whether the Purifiers will be able to upgrade more of their fighters with Reaver technology to replace the ones lost in Canada.\n\nThe Reavers play a small role in \"Cable and X-Force\" - Volume 4. Pretty Boy, Bonebreaker, Skullbuster (female), and Skullbuster (male) are quickly dispatched by Hope Summers and Cable before being able to deploy an ICBM.\n\nDonald Pierce later leads a new group of Reavers, composed of Star and Shine whom together go by the Starshine moniker, Pretty Boy, Skullbuster (Cylla Markham) and Bonebreaker. They were able to find the place where the X-Men had hidden Wolverine's metal-encased body until they were found by an X-Men. During the battle, Wolverine's adamantium shell was broken and to the Reavers surprise it was empty. The X-Men eventually defeated the Reavers and delivered them to Alpha Flight. Only Starshine was able to evade capture and contacted Lady Deathstrike about their findings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the Age of Apocalypse, Reavers were a band of human traitors serving Apocalypse. They have been enhanced with Apocalypse's techno-organic virus which allows them to merge with both organic and mechanical materials.\n\nRather than being a specific team of supervillains, the Ultimate version of the Reavers are human gladiators who have undergone surgery to become cyborgs for the specific purpose of hunting down mutants on live television. They are led by the deranged Mutant-hunter Sgt. Wade \"Wadey\" Wilson aka Deadpool. Some do retain the names of the Earth-616 Reavers, such as 'Bonebreaker'. Another known one is named 'Cruise'.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "24676419", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24676419", "title": "Reportedly haunted locations in the District of Columbia", "text": "Reportedly haunted locations in the District of Columbia\n\nThere are a number of reportedly haunted locations in Washington, D.C. The city is the capital of the United States, and was founded (pursuant to an Act of Congress) on July 16, 1790. The City of Washington was originally a separate municipality within the Territory of Columbia until an act of Congress in 1871 effectively merged George Town, the City of Washington, and the Territory of Columbia into a single entity called the District of Columbia. Washington, D.C., has been the site of military battles, deadly duels, assassinations, untimely deaths, and associated tragedies.\n\nWashington's haunted history is so well known that some of its haunted locations were featured in a 2006 documentary, \"America's Haunted Houses,\" on the A&E cable network. Novelist Dan Brown mentioned them prominently in his 2009 novel, \"The Lost Symbol\". Notable purportedly haunted locations include the United States Capitol, Capitol Hill, the White House, Lafayette Square and nearby buildings, Independence Avenue SW, The Octagon House, Chinatown, the National Theatre, Hay–Adams Hotel, Woodrow Wilson House, Omni Shoreham Hotel, and many others.\n\nThe United States Capitol is reputedly haunted by many past representatives of the United States House of Representatives and government officials, officers who served during the American Revolutionary War, workers who died during its construction and a \"demon black cat\" that is said to make appearances just before national tragedies or changes in Presidential administration. A very high number of apparitions of deceased American presidents have been reported in the White House, the most famous of which is Abraham Lincoln, reported even by later presidents such as Harry S. Truman, and apparitions of presidents Thomas Jefferson, Andrew Jackson, and John Tyler have all been witnessed, as have the spirits of many First Ladies.\n\nThe President's Park, Lafayette Park, and nearby buildings are reported to be home to ghosts such as Philip Barton Key II and Stephen Decatur who died there following pistol duels. The Octagon is supposedly one of the most haunted buildings in D.C., with sightings of its past occupants and African American slaves who once worked there. The National Theatre is said to be haunted by the ghost of actor John McCullough, who was murdered in the 1880s by a fellow thespian. Hay–Adams Hotel is claimed to be host to the ghost of Marian \"Clover\" Hooper Adams, the wife of Henry Brooks Adams, the celebrated 19th-century American journalist, historian and novelist, who was the grandson of John Quincy Adams, and the Woodrow Wilson House is allegedly haunted by former president Woodrow Wilson himself who spent his final years in illness there before dying in his bedroom in 1924. Houses in the Georgetown area of the city are reported to be haunted by figures from colonial times, including slaves, merchants and children. Staff and guests of the Omni Shoreham Hotel have told of stories of faint voices, cold breezes, and doors slamming shut and opening and televisions and lights turning on and off of their own accord.\n\nThe United States Capitol is considered one of the most haunted buildings in Washington. The first apparition to be seen there was in the 1860s as the Capitol was being completed. Several spirits are said to haunt the Capitol due to tragedies associated with its construction. One such ghost is said to be that of a worker who died after a fall during the construction of the rotunda, and who now is occasionally seen floating beneath the dome carrying a tray of woodworking tools. Another spirit is allegedly a stonemason who died (crushed to death beneath a wall which collapsed, or murdered by a co-worker) and is seen in the Old Senate chambers or passing through a wall in the basement beneath the Senate.\nMany politicians with strong personalities and a powerful attachment to the institution of Congress are reputed still to roam the halls of Congress long after their deaths. The shades of Representative Joseph Cannon (R-Ill. and Speaker from 1903 to 1911) and Rep. Champ Clark (D-Mo. and Speaker from 1911 to 1919) are claimed to occasionally return to the dark chamber of the House of Representatives after midnight and, after a loud rap from a gavel, resume the strong, angry debates they once had in life. Members of the United States Capitol Police have claimed to have seen Senator (and from 1852 to 1854, Representative) Thomas Hart Benton sitting at a desk in National Statuary Hall, although it has not been used as a legislative chamber since 1857. Steve Livengood, chief tour guide for the United States Capitol Historical Society, says he has seen the ghost of former Representative Wilbur Mills (D-Ark.) near Mills' former office late at night. Pierre Charles L'Enfant, although not a politician, was a brevet Major during the American Revolutionary War who served with George Washington at Valley Forge. In 1791, L'Enfant was appointed architect and planner of the new city of Washington in the District of Columbia. Although L'Enfant submitted grandiose plans for the new capital city, his plans were never fully adopted and President Washington dismissed him. L'Enfant spent much of the rest of his life attempting to wrest a monetary payment from Congress, and he died in poverty in 1825. Eyewitnesses, however, claim to have seen his spirit walking through the Capitol, head down, murmuring to himself, with the plans for the capital city tucked under his arm.\n\nThe Capitol has also been witness to murder and death. Rep. William P. Taulbee had been a congressman from Kentucky from 1884 to 1888. Charles E. Kincaid, a journalist for \"The Louisville Times\", had accused Taulbee of adultery and involvement in a Patent Office scandal, which had ruined Taulbee's political career. On February 28, 1890, the ex-congressman and the reporter ran into one another in the Capitol, and Taulbee assaulted and embarrassed Kincaid by tweaking the much smaller man's nose. Kincaid ran home, grabbed a pistol, and, when he encountered Taulbee on a marble staircase leading from the House chamber down to the dining room, shot him in the face just below Taulbee's left eye. Taulbee died two weeks later, and Kincaid was acquitted after claiming self-defense. Journalists and others claim that whenever a reporter slips on these steps, Taulbee's ghost briefly appears. Former President and then-Rep. John Quincy Adams suffered a stroke at his desk in the House chamber on February 21, 1848, and was taken into the Speaker's Room. His physical condition was too precarious to permit him to be moved, and he died at the Capitol two days later. Many people claim to have heard Adams' ghost denouncing slavery late at night in National Statuary Hall, and one Congressional staff member claims that by standing in the spot where Adams' desk once stood a person can still hear the former president's ghostly whisper. James A. Garfield was a member of the House from 1863 to 1881 before assuming the Presidency in March 1881. Garfield was shot by Charles J. Guiteau, a disgruntled office seeker, on July 2, 1881, at 9:30 a.m. as he walked through the Sixth Street Station of the Baltimore and Potomac Railroad in Washington, D.C. Garfield died of heart failure brought about by blood poisoning (itself caused by poor medical care) on September 19, 1881, while recuperating at a beach house near Long Branch, New Jersey. Witnesses have seen Garfield's specter walking solemnly through the halls of Congress.\n\nNot all Capitol hauntings are related to people who worked there. The \"Demon Cat\" is alleged to prowl the halls of Congress, and make appearances just before a national tragedy or change in Presidential administration. It was first seen in the early part of the 19th century, and a night watchman shot at it in 1862. It has also been seen by other night watchmen and members of the Capitol Police. It appeared before the assassination of President Abraham Lincoln, the October 1929 stock market crash, and the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. The cat has not only been seen in the halls, but has repeatedly appeared in Washington's Tomb. The Tomb (two levels below the crypt beneath the Capitol Rotunda) was an original feature of the Capitol, planned as a resting place for George Washington and members of his family. The Washington family politely declined the offer. The Tomb stands empty, although from 1865 to 2009 (when it was moved to the United States Capitol Visitor Center) the Lincoln catafalque was stored there. The specters of at least two soldiers are also said to haunt the Capitol. A few eyewitnesses have claimed that whenever an individual lies in state in the Capitol Rotunda, a World War I doughboy momentarily appears, salutes, then disappears. A second apparition, which eyewitnesses say is the ghost of an American Revolutionary War soldier, has also appeared at the Washington Tomb. According to several stories, the soldier appears, moves around the Lincoln catafalque, and then passes out the door into the hallway before disappearing.\n\nCapitol Hill is one of the largest and most densely populated neighborhoods in Washington, D.C. It is bounded by F Street NE on the north and Southeast/Southwest Freeway on the south. The U.S. Capitol marks its western boundary, while the Anacostia River is its eastern limit. Although Capitol Hill has been home to many of the city's powerful, its hauntings appear to be few. One ghost, however, is said to haunt First Street NE. Joseph Holt was Judge Advocate General of the United States Army from 1862 to 1875. He presided over the trials of the Lincoln assassination conspirators. During the trials, accused conspirators Dr. Samuel Mudd (who treated John Wilkes Booth's broken leg) and Mary Surratt (at whose downtown boarding house the conspirators met) were held at the Old Capitol Prison opposite the U.S. Capitol (the modern day United States Supreme Court Building stands on the site today). After Holt retired, he allegedly became a recluse in his Capitol Hill home. Although the Holt house no longer exists, local residents have told stories of Holt's ghost walking down First Street NE in a blue suit and cape, pondering the guilt of Mudd and Surrat as he heads for the site of the Old Capitol Prison.\n\nCapitol Hill's other hauntings are associated with the two military installations in that part of the city. At the official residence of the Commandant of the Marine Corps Barracks and Parade Ground on 8th Street SE, there are stories which talk about rustling papers, the sound of a man pacing, and the appearance of the ghostly image of Samuel Nicholas, the first Commandant of the Marine Corps. At the nearby Washington Navy Yard at 8th Street SE and M Street SE, the ghost of Commodore Thomas Tingey is said to stare out of the upper windows of the Tingey House (the traditional residence of the Commander of the Navy Yard). Local residents and press reports also tell stories about \"Old Howard,\" a cantankerous former U.S. Marine who lived in the 1860s in a two-story house between G and I Streets SE who now haunts it, harassing the occupants and acting much like a poltergeist.\n\nThe White House is the oldest building on President's Park. An integral part of the planned city that is Washington, D.C., a design was chosen and construction begun in 1792, and the building (although unfinished) was opened for occupancy on November 1, 1800. The first people to occupy the building were President John Adams and his wife, Abigail. Parts of the mansion were unfinished, including the cavernous East Room. With no running water (it was not installed until 1834), water had to be brought into the house by jug and heated for bathing or laundry to be done. Abigail Adams often hung the family's laundry up to dry in the drafty East Room. The ghost of Abigail Adams has been seen since shortly after her death in 1818, arms extended as if she were still carrying laundry into the East Room, accompanied by the smell of soap or damp clothing. Household staff in the Taft administration even observed her walking through walls.\n\nThe White House's most famous alleged apparition is that of Abraham Lincoln. Eleanor Roosevelt never admitted to having seen Lincoln's ghost, but did say that she felt his presence repeatedly throughout the White House. Mrs. Roosevelt also said that the family dog, Fala, would sometimes bark for no reason at what she felt was Lincoln's ghost. President Dwight Eisenhower's press secretary, James Hagerty, and Liz Carpenter, press secretary to First Lady Lady Bird Johnson, both said they felt Lincoln's presence many times. The former president's footsteps are also said to be heard in the hall outside the Lincoln Bedroom. As reputable an eyewitness as Lillian Rogers Parks admitted in her autobiography \"My Thirty Years Backstairs at the White House\" that she had heard them. Margaret Truman, daughter of President Harry S. Truman, said she heard a specter rapping at the door of the Lincoln Bedroom when she stayed there, and believed it was Lincoln. President Truman himself was once wakened by raps at the door while spending a night in the Lincoln Bedroom. Others have actually seen an apparition of the former president. The first person reported to have actually seen Lincoln's spirit was First Lady Grace Coolidge, who said she saw the ghost of Lincoln standing at a window in the Yellow Oval Room staring out at the Potomac. Winston Churchill, Theodore Roosevelt, and Maureen Reagan and her husband have all claimed to have seen a spectral Lincoln in the White House. A number of staff members of the Franklin D. Roosevelt administration claimed to have seen Lincoln's spirit, and on one occasion Roosevelt's personal valet ran screaming from the White House claiming he had seen Lincoln's ghost. Perhaps the most famous incident was in 1942 when Queen Wilhelmina of The Netherlands heard footsteps outside her White House bedroom and answered a knock on the door, only to see Lincoln in frock coat and top hat standing in front of her (she promptly fainted). Several unnamed eyewitnesses have claimed to have seen the shade of Abraham Lincoln actually lying down on the bed in the Lincoln Bedroom (which was used as a meeting room at the time of his administration), and others have seen Lincoln sit on the edge of the bed and put his boots on. The most famous eyewitness to the latter was Mary Eben, Eleanor Roosevelt's secretary, who saw Lincoln pulling on his boots (after which she ran screaming from the room).\n\nThe last sighting of Lincoln's ghost was in the early 1980s, when Tony Savoy, White House operations foreman, came into the White House and saw Lincoln sitting in a chair at the top of some stairs.\nAbraham Lincoln is not the only Lincoln ghost witnesses claim to have seen in the White House. Willie Lincoln, Abraham Lincoln's 11-year-old son, died in the White House of typhoid on February 20, 1862. Willie Lincoln's ghost was first seen in the White House by staff members of the Grant administration in the 1870s, but has appeared as recently as the 1960s (President Lyndon B. Johnson's college-age daughter, Lynda Bird Johnson Robb, saw the ghost and claims to have talked to him).\n\nOther presidents, as well as First Ladies, are also said to haunt the White House. Witnesses in the past two centuries have reported that Thomas Jefferson can be heard playing his violin in the Yellow Oval Room. President Andrew Jackson is said to be seen lying on what is thought to be his old bed in the Queens' Bedroom (also known as the Rose Room), and his guttural laugh has been heard in the White House since the beginning of the 1860s. First Lady press secretary Liz Carpenter heard the laugh and swore it was Jackson's, and Mary Todd Lincoln claimed to have heard the stomping and swearing of an invisible presence which she claimed was the uncouth Jackson. White House seamstress Lillian Rogers Parks said she was sewing in the Queen's Bedroom and felt a presence, cold air, and then a hand on the back of her chair. She quickly left the room, and for the rest of her time in the White House she refused to enter the room again without at least one other person accompanying her. The spirit of William Henry Harrison, it is claimed, haunts the attic, and President John Tyler allegedly haunts the Blue Room. First Lady Frances Folsom Cleveland, who was married to President Grover Cleveland in the White House's Blue Room in 1886, is widely claimed to haunt the room where she was married and was seen there after her death in 1947.\n\nThe White House is also said to be visited by three specters who did not live there. The first is that of David Burns, who owned the ground on which the White House stands before selling it to the federal government in May 1791, and whose spirit has been seen in Oval Office. A reporter told a security guard during the Truman administration that, while standing in the Yellow Oval Room, he heard a faint ghostly voice which said, \"I'm Mr. Burns.\" The second spirit is allegedly that of a British soldier dressed in a uniform from the War of 1812 and carrying a torch. In August 1814, a combined British land and naval force captured Washington, D.C., and set fire to the White House, Treasury Building, Capitol, and other buildings in retaliation for the American looting of York, Upper Canada (now the city of Toronto) and the burning of the Parliament Buildings of Upper Canada after the Battle of York in 1813. The fires were put out only when a hurricane and tornado passed through Washington the following day, extinguishing the blazes. The soldier is claimed to be one of those who burned the White House, or who lost his life the following day in the storm. Another shade alleged to visit the White House is the ghost of Anna Surratt, daughter of convicted Lincoln assassination co-conspirator Mary Surratt, who forced her way into the White House the night before her mother's execution and unsuccessfully begged for her mother's life. It is claimed by some White House staff that Anna's ghost returns to the White House every July 6, silently banging on the front door to seek entrance and continue her futile pleas for her mother's life.\n\nPresident's Park, better known as Lafayette Square, may have its own spectral resident. Philip Barton Key II was the son of Francis Scott Key and the nephew of Chief Justice Roger B. Taney. In the spring of 1858, Key began having an affair with Teresa Bagioli Sickles, the wife of his friend Daniel Sickles. On February 26, 1859, Sickles learned of the affair. The following day, he saw Key in Lafayette Square signalling to his wife. Sickles rushed out into the park, drew a pistol, and shot the unarmed Key three times while the other man pleaded for his life. Key was taken into the nearby Benjamin Ogle Tayloe House and died moments later. Key's spirit, eyewitnesses and authors claim, now haunts Lafayette Square and can be seen on dark nights near the spot where he was shot.\n\nDecatur House (748 Jackson Place NW) is allegedly haunted by the ghost of Stephen Decatur. In 1820, Commodore James Barron challenged Commodore Decatur to a duel over comments Decatur had made regarding Barron's conduct in the \"Chesapeake-Leopard\" Affair of 1807. The two men duelled on March 20, and Decatur was mortally wounded in the stomach. Decatur was rushed back to his home, and died there on March 22. A year after Decatur's death, his ghost reportedly began appearing at the house—standing in a second floor window looking out at H Street NW or leaving the back door of the house with a box of dueling pistols. So many witnesses saw the specter of Decatur that the window was walled up. Some people have also claimed that they can hear his widow, who became hysterical at his death, weeping in the house.\nSt. John's Episcopal Church (1525 H Street NW), built in 1816, is the second-oldest structure on the President's Park. The church has a tradition of a \"President's pew,\" which is reserved for the use of the President of the United States. The church's bell was purchased from the Revere Company of Boston (founded by Joseph Warren Revere, son of Paul Revere) and installed on November 30, 1822 (where it remains ). According to at least two accounts, whenever the bell tolls because of the death of a notable person, six ghostly men in white robes appear in the President's pew at midnight and then vanish.\nThe Cutts-Madison House (721 Madison Place NW), also known as the Dolley Madison House, was constructed in 1822 by Richard Cutts, brother-in-law of First Lady Dolley Madison. After ex-President James Madison died in 1836, Dolley Madison took up residency in the house and lived there until her death in 1849. Rear Admiral Charles Wilkes purchased the home in 1851. Wilkes moved the entrance from Madison Place NW to H Street NW, and turned the porch on the west side of the house (facing Madison Place NW) into a window. Witnesses from the mid-19th century onward have claimed to have seen the ghost of Dolley Madison rocking in a chair in the space where the porch used to be, smiling at passersby.\n\nThe Octagon House (1799 New York Avenue NW) is reported to be the most haunted home in D.C. It was built in 1801 by Colonel John Tayloe III. The Tayloes were a greatly distinguished Virginia family: His grandfather, Colonel John Tayloe (d. 1747), was a member of the King's Council in Virginia and owner of more than of land (a huge estate at the time), and his father, Colonel John Tayloe II, built the historic Mount Airy manor house in 1758 and was also a member of the King's Council. John Tayloe III was a close friend of George Washington's, and Washington convinced Tayloe to build a winter home in the new city of Washington. There is some evidence that the walled back yard of The Octagon itself may have served as a slave market, and it is well-established that the rear of the building housed the Tayloe family's slaves. The Tayloe family was exceptionally well-connected, and their home was an important one in the city. After the burning of the White House in the War of 1812, President James and Dolley Madison lived there from September 1814 to October 1815, and Madison signed the Treaty of Ghent (which ended the war) there in February 1815. Apparitions and the presence of otherworldly forces have been seen and felt in many places at The Octagon, including on the spiral staircase, the second floor landing, the third floor landing, the third floor bedroom, and the garden area in the rear. Among the eyewitnesses have been members of the public, and curators and other employees hired by the museum which owns the house. Two of Colonel Tayloe's daughters are said to haunt The Octagon. The first allegedly died before the War of 1812. Colonel Tayloe and his daughter quarreled on the second floor landing over the girl's relationship with a British officer stationed in the city. When the daughter turned in anger to go down the stairs, she fell down the stairs (or over the railing; stories differ) and died. Her specter is allegedly seen crumpled at the bottom of the steps or on the stairs near the second floor landing, and sometimes exhibits itself as the light of a candle moving up the staircase. The other death, stories claim, occurred in 1817 or shortly thereafter. Another of Colonel Tayloe's daughters eloped with a young man, incurring her father's wrath. When she returned home to reconcile with her father, they argued on the third-floor landing. This daughter, too, fell to her death down the stairs (or over the railing), and her shade is alleged to haunt the third floor landing and stairs between the second and third floors.\n\nThe Octagon is also believed by some to be haunted by the spirits of African American slaves who once lived there. When the house held bells to summon servants, the spirits of the dead slaves would announce their presence by ringing these bells loudly. The ghostly bell ringing first occurred in the 1870s. General George D. Ramsay, Chief of Ordnance for the United States Army and commander of the Washington Arsenal in Washington, D.C., was attending a dinner at The Octagon when all the bells in the house began ringing. As Marian Gouverneur, wife of Samuel Laurence Gouverneur, Jr. (the first American consul in Foo Chow, China), related the story, General Ramsay seized the bell ropes to stop the bells from sounding, but to everyone's shock they did not stop ringing. Although Gouverneur's report was not made until 1911, the mysterious ringing of the bells had been reported in 1874 and again in 1889, each time attributed to the spirits of dead slaves.\n\nOther spirits are also said to remain at The Octagon as well. Dolley Madison's spirit has been seen near the fireplace in the main ballroom as well as heading through a closed door to the garden, and her ghost's presence is accompanied by the smell of lilacs, her favorite flower. A slave girl in the house was allegedly thrown from the third floor landing to the first floor below and killed by a British soldier during the War of 1812, and eyewitnesses have reported hearing her scream. The specter of a British soldier in War of 1812 dress was seen by caretaker James Cypress in the 1950s, and museum superintendent Alric H. Clay claimed that in the 1960s spirits would often turn on the lights and open The Octagon's doors late at night. A gambler shot to death in the house's third-floor bedroom in the late 19th century has sometimes been seen still in the bed he died in, and ghostly footmen have been seen at the front door waiting to receive guests. He was said to have rung a bell shortly before his death and that the ring of the bell often heard in the house is from him. Various witnesses have also reported hearing assorted moans, screams, and footsteps.\n\nThe spirits of slaves are also said to haunt a portion of Independence Avenue SW, the site of two of the city's largest and most notorious slave markets. The Yellow House or Williams Slave Pen (at about 800 Independence Avenue SW, now the site of the headquarters of the Federal Aviation Administration)<ref name = \"FAA/Kraus\"></ref> was the most notorious slave pen in the capital: A modest, well-maintained, two-story yellow house concealed a very large basement in which slaves were chained to walls in windowless rooms, while a yard surrounded by a high brick wall provided space for the training and selling of slaves. Another large slave market, the Robey Slave Pen, was just a block away at the corner of 7th Street SW and Independence Avenue SW. On dark nights, witnesses say they have heard the clinking of chains and screams on Independence Avenue where these slave pens used to operate.\n\nThe intersection of 7th Street NW and H Street NW is the heart of D.C.'s Chinatown neighborhood today, but prior to the 1930s it was populated primarily by German immigrants. Before the American Civil War, 7th Street NW was the city's primary commercial district, the street lined with three-story Federal-style townhouses with shops on the ground floor and residences above. Lincoln conspirator Mary Surratt's boarding house (604 H Street NW) has been substantially renovated through the years (and currently houses a Chinese restaurant), but it may also house Mary Surratt's ghost. From the 1870s onward, occupants of the building have claimed that Surratt's spirit is responsible for the incomprehensible mumbling and whispers, footsteps, muffled sobs, and creaking floorboards which have unnerved them.\n\nAt least three other sites in downtown D.C. are also reputed to be haunted. The National Theatre (1321 Pennsylvania Avenue NW) opened at its current location on December 7, 1835, although the old building was torn down and replaced with the current structure in 1923. Nonetheless, some claim the theater is haunted by the ghost of actor John McCullough, who was murdered in the 1880s by a fellow thespian where the modern stage is located today. The spook was first sighted by Frederic Bond, a comic actor and friend of McCullough's, in September 1896. Bond was on the stage late at night reviewing preparations for the next day's performance when he felt a spectral presence that terrified him. He then saw a ghostly figure dressed in the traditional garb of the Shakespearean character Hamlet. Recognizing the spirit, he shouted McCullough's name and the ghost vanished. The National Building Museum (401 F Street NW), too, is allegedly haunted. Built in 1887 in order to process pensions for Civil War veterans, widows, and orphans (such pensions consumed a quarter of the federal budget at the time), the \"Pension Building\" (as it was originally known) contains 15 Corinthian columns made of brick and plaster and painted to imitate black onyx. Security guards and other witnesses have claimed that the swirling colors of the columns can change to form the outlines of people who have recently died, or who had ties to the building. When in use as the headquarters of the Superior Court of the District of Columbia in the 1940s, night watchmen reported seeing a man on horseback on the upper floors, where horses used to be quartered during the Civil War. They also reported seeing the ghost of James Tanner, a stenographer who took down the testimony of eyewitnesses after the assassination of President Lincoln at Ford's Theater (ironically, Robert Todd Lincoln approved the plans for the Pension Building). These stories gained such prominence that mystery writer Margaret Truman mentioned them in one of her novels.\n\nThe Hay–Adams Hotel may also be host to the ghost of Marian \"Clover\" Hooper Adams. She was the wife of Henry Brooks Adams, the celebrated 19th-century American journalist, historian, academic and novelist who was the grandson of John Quincy Adams. She married Henry Adams on June 27, 1872, and in 1877 the couple moved to Washington, D.C., and rented the Slidell House at 1607 H Street NW. Their home became a salon for the capital's literati and politically powerful. In 1881, the Adamses purchased a lot on the northwest corner of 16th Street NW and H Street NW on Lafayette Square, and with their friend John Hay began building the famous Hay-Adams Houses—two of the most architecturally important private residences ever built in the city. Marian Adams' beloved father, to whom she was exceptionally close, died on April 13, 1885, and she sank into a deep depression. Just months before she was to occupy her spacious and luxurious new home, Adams committed suicide on December 6, 1885, by swallowing potassium cyanide. To mark her grave in Rock Creek Cemetery, Henry Adams commissioned sculptor Augustus Saint-Gaudens and architect Stanford White to create the haunting Adams Memorial with its hooded, robed, androgynous figure formally titled \"Mystery of the Hereafter and The Peace of God that Passeth Understanding\" (but which is commonly called \"Grief\"). The Hay-Adams Houses were razed in 1927 by real estate developer Harry Wardman, and the Hay-Adams Hotel built on the site. Although Marian Adams never lived in the house where the Hay-Adams Hotel is today, some hotel staff say her specter haunts the site. Housekeepers and other staff have reported being hugged by an invisible presence as well as hearing a woman sobbing. Other mysterious occurrences attributed to the Adams specter include locked doors opening and closing, clock radios turning on and off, and a woman's voice whispering, \"What do you want?\" A few witnesses say the ghost is accompanied by the scent of mimosa, Adams' favorite scent. The incidents are located primarily on the hotel's fourth floor, and occur usually during the first two weeks of December (near the anniversary of Marian Adams' death).\n\nOne of the most important buildings in the Dupont Circle neighborhood is the Walsh Mansion (now the Embassy of Indonesia) located at 2020 Massachusetts Avenue NW. Thomas J. Walsh had emigrated penniless from Ireland to the United States in 1869, then over the next quarter century built up a small fortune as a carpenter, miner, and hotel manager. His first daughter (born in 1880) died in infancy, but his daughter, Evalyn (born in 1886), and son, Vinson (born in 1888), both survived. He lost nearly all his life's savings in the Panic of 1893. The family moved to Ouray, Colorado, in 1896, where Walsh bought the Camp Bird Mine (which was thought to have been worked out) and struck a massive vein of gold and silver. Now a multi-millionaire, Thomas Walsh moved his family to Washington, D.C., in 1898. After spending 1899–1900 in Paris, France, the Walshes returned to Washington where Thomas Walsh commenced the construction of a mansion on Massachusetts Avenue NW. The Walsh Mansion, completed in 1903, cost $835,000 (the most expensive residence in the city at the time) and had 60 rooms, a theater, a ballroom, a French salon, a grand staircase, and $2 million in furnishings which took several years to purchase and install. Evalyn Walsh married Edward Beale \"Ned\" McLean (the publishing heir whose family owned \"The Washington Post\") in 1908, and after her father's death in April 1910 lived in the Walsh Mansion. In 1910, Ned McLean bought the allegedly cursed Hope Diamond for his wife for $180,000 (although the purchase was not formalized until February 1911, and not completed until after a lawsuit settled out of court in 1912). Evalyn Walsh died on April 26, 1947. To cover Evalyn's significant debts, the Walsh Mansion was sold in 1952 to the Government of Indonesia for use as an embassy. But according to embassy staff, Evalyn Walsh McLean never vacated the home. Rather, her spirit has been seen several times gliding down the mansion's grand central staircase. A naked lady's spectral form has also been seen from time to time in the mansion, but no one knows who she is.\n\nA second noted house in the Dupont Circle neighborhood which is claimed to be haunted is the Woodrow Wilson House (2340 S Street NW). Woodrow Wilson was elected President of the United States in 1912, was re-elected in 1916 promising to keep the nation out of war, led the nation through World War I, and left office in 1921. At 2 AM on September 26, 1919, while traveling to Wichita, Kansas, on a nationwide speaking tour to win public support to pressure the Senate into ratifying the Treaty of Versailles, Wilson collapsed and, after cancelling the rest of his speaking tour, was rushed back to the capital by train. His condition worsened on the journey, and upon arriving at the White House on October 2 the President suffered a life-threatening stroke that left him permanently paralyzed on his left side and blind in the left eye. Although the President lived, he was confined to bed for two months, seen only by his wife, a few close associates, and his physicians. From December 1919 to April 1920 Wilson required a wheelchair. Wilson attended his first Cabinet meeting in April 1920, but for the rest of the year his mind continued to wander, his memory was marred, and he tired easily. By March 1921 (when he left office) Wilson was able to walk short distances with the use of a cane (and with a valet close at hand). The extent of Wilson's disability was kept from the public until after his death on February 3, 1924. President and Mrs. Wilson purchased a large home at 2340 S Street NW, to which a number of modifications were made (including the addition of an elevator). Woodrow Wilson received few guests in his last years, and died in his third floor bedroom on February 3, 1924. His wife, Edith Bolling Galt Wilson, lived in the home until her death on December 28, 1961, and willed the home to the National Trust for Historic Preservation to be made into a museum honoring her husband. In the decades since her death, staff and visitors at the Woodrow Wilson House claim to have seen the President's ghost sitting in his rocking chair, heard the shuffle of a man walking with a cane, and heard a man sob.\n\nGeneral Edward Braddock left Observatory Hill in Georgetown in 1755 on an expedition to capture the French Fort Duquesne during the French and Indian War. Braddock's expedition was surprised on July 9 in the vicinity of present-day Braddock, Pennsylvania, in what is now known as the Battle of the Monongahela. Nearly 900 of Braddock's 1,300 men were killed or wounded, and Braddock himself killed. Since before the American Civil War, witnesses say that on the anniversary of Braddock's departure they can hear shouted military orders, horses' hooves on cobblestones, the sound of men marching, and the sound of metal clanking against metal. The sounds can be heard near the old Long Bridge or near the Georgetown bluffs overlooking the Potomac River.\nHalcyon House (3400 Prospect Street NW) is a mansion originally built in 1787 by Benjamin Stoddert, the first Secretary of the Navy. Halcyon House was owned by several individuals in the 19th century, and is alleged to have served as part of the Underground Railroad. The home was sold in 1900 to Albert Clemens, a nephew of Mark Twain. The original structure was heavily altered over the next 38 years. Clemens believed that perpetually rebuilding the house would extend his life. The coach house was joined to the building, apartments added to the north face and rear, rooms built within rooms, hallways added and then walled off, and even a small crypt added in one room. Clemens died in 1938. Halcyon House is allegedly haunted by the spirits of numerous runaway slaves who died there during their escape to freedom, and whose moans and cries can be heard in the basement. Others claim that the ghost of Benjamin Stoddert has been seen, heard walking through the house, sitting in a chair, or whispering unintelligibly. The spirit of a woman has also been spotted in an upstairs window. A six-year-old visitor claimed that the woman frequently woke him at night by rearranging his covers. Two residents say they have experienced levitation during the night, with their bodies being reversed so that their feet were on the pillow. Unnamed residents have told about lights mysteriously going out and sounds in the attic.\nThe Old Stone House (3051 M Street NW) was built in 1765 by Christopher and Rachel Layman. The house was sold in 1767 to a wealthy widow, Cassandra Chew, who constructed a kitchen in the rear in 1767, and a second floor between 1767 and 1775, and a third floor in the 1790s. It remained in private hands for almost two centuries, used as a home and place of business, until the federal government purchased it in 1953 . An exceptionally large number of spirits, residents and visitors claim, inhabit the small house. These include: A woman in a brown dress standing near the fireplace, a heavy-set woman standing on the staircase and also in the kitchen, a man with long blond hair and wearing a blue jacket, a man wearing short pants and long stockings, a woman in a rocking chair on the third floor, a small boy who runs down the third floor hallway, a man dressed in Colonial-era clothing standing in the master bedroom, a man dressed in Colonial-era clothing seen on the second floor, a young girl with curly hair running up and down the staircase, an African American boy, and a German-looking craftsman. The laughter of invisible children and the translucent images of women cooking in the kitchen have also been observed. The Old Stone House may also contain one of Washington's only malevolent spirits, nicknamed \"George,\" who has choked and pushed visitors and whose presence (often indicated by an extremely cold spot) leaves witnesses with an intense feeling of dread. The hauntings at the Old Stone House are so well known that they were mentioned in Sandi Wilson's short crime story, \"The Blonde in Black.\"\nBridges in Georgetown may also be the sites of ghostly activity. Two specters are said to haunt the site of the M Street Bridge. M Street NW was known on the Georgetown side as \"Bridge Street\" before the street renaming of 1895. In 1788, a wooden drawbridge was built over Rock Creek to connect Bridge Street with M Street NW in Washington. But the bridge collapsed during a rain storm shortly after it was built, taking a stagecoach full of passengers with it. Federal Bridge, a sturdier structure, was built over Rock Creek in 1802. However, from the early 19th century to the early 20th century, Georgetown residents claimed to see a silent stagecoach race down Bridge Street on starless nights, and then disappear in the center of the new span. Another apparition said to haunt the bridge was that of a drummer boy who allegedly had been knocked off the bridge (during the American Revolutionary War or in the early 19th century after the bridge had been rebuilt) by a gust of wind and drowned in Rock Creek. On quiet nights, witnesses claimed to hear soft drumming which got louder near the center of the span but disappeared once the spot where the boy drowned was reached. The image of a headless man (whose origins are shrouded in mystery) is said to sometimes haunt the Georgetown side of the K Street NW bridge over Rock Creek as well.\n\nAnother spirit reportedly haunts the Omni Shoreham Hotel (2500 Calvert Street NW), built in 1930 by local construction company owner Harry Bralove and designed by Waddy Butler Wood. The hotel's owners accepted Henry L. Doherty as a minority financial partner. Doherty and his family moved into an apartment (now Suite 870) in the hotel, along with their maid, Juliette Brown. A few months after the Dohertys moved into the apartment, their maid died in the night. A short time later, the Doherty's daughter, Helen, also died in the suite. The Dohertys moved out, and the apartment remained unoccupied for almost 50 years. The apartment was renovated into a hotel suite. But guests and hotel staff began to tell stories of faint voices, cold breezes, doors slamming shut and opening of their own accord, and televisions and lights turning on and off on their own. Guests in adjoining suites would complain of noises coming from the closed and empty Suite 870. Other occupants say furniture would be found out of place, and hotel staff said their housekeeping carts would move on their own. The Omni Shoreham Hotel has named the room the \"Ghost Suite.\" Todd Scartozzi, an Omni Hotels manager, stayed in the Ghost Suite with his family and observed a walk-in closet light turning on and off of its own accord.\n"}

She was originally named \"Mona's Isle\" - the second ship in the Company's history to be so named. She served for 23 years under that name before being rebuilt, re-engined and renamed in 1883. As \"Ellan Vannin\" she served for a further 26 years before being lost in a storm on 3 December 1909 in Liverpool Bay.\n\n\"Mona's Isle\" was built by Tod and McGregor Ltd, Glasgow, at a cost of £10,673. She entered service with the Steam Packet Fleet in June 1860.\n\n\"Mona's Isle\" is important in the history of the line, as she was the first vessel to be fitted with oscillating engines, which were also manufactured by Tod and McGregor Ltd. Until 1860 the Company had always used the side-lever engine so favoured by Robert Napier and Sons. The oscillating engines possessed a number of advantages over the side-lever, as it occupied less space and had fewer working parts. A further enhancement was the addition of improved feathering floats which were fitted to the paddle wheels.\n\nThere was no requirement for a connecting rod, and the upper end of the piston rod was fitted with a bearing which worked directly on to the crankpin. The cylinder was placed vertically under the crankshaft and could pivot through a small arc, permitting the rod to follow the movement of the crank. The plant produced which gave her a speed of approximately 12 knots.\n\nWhen launched, \"Mona's Isle\" measured 339 gross register tons (grt). .\n\nAfter 23 years service, \"Mona's Isle\" was laid up at Ramsey and subsequently was taken under tow to Barrow by the \"Fenella\" in order to undergo her rebuild, on Friday 19 January 1883.\n\nRebuilt in 1883, her size was increased to 375 gross register tons and her speed to . She was renamed (the Manx translation for \"Mona's Isle\") on 16 November 1883, following her conversion to a propeller-driven ship. \"Ellan Vannin\" was a twin-screw vessel driven by a two-cylinder compound steam engine made by Westray, Copeland and Co. at Barrow. Her boiler pressure was raised to .\n\nShe was capable of carrying 300 passengers and normally had a crew of 14. \"Ellan Vannin\" primarily operated out of Ramsey to Whitehaven, Liverpool and Scotland. She gave 26 years more service, and became the main mail carrier out of Ramsey.\nIn December 1891, she completed a special overhaul at the Naval Construction Works at Barrow, costing £2,913.\n\nBy 1909 she was the smallest and oldest ship in the Steam Packet Fleet. \"Ellan Vannin\" was considered an exceptionally fine vessel in bad weather, carrying out the daily mail contract when other vessels were safe in harbour.\n\nIndeed, stormy weather appeared to be no deterrent to her, and it is reported that when up to 12 ocean liners had been taking shelter in Ramsey Bay, \"Ellan Vannin\" steamed through them as she made passage to Whitehaven and returned in the evening, the completion of her voyage being heralded by the ships sheltering in the bay sounding their whistles.\n\n\"Ellan Vannin\" became looked upon as a \"mascot\" of the Steam Packet fleet, and known by Manx sailors as the \"Li'l Daisy.\"\n\nOn 3 December 1909, \"Ellan Vannin\" left her home port of Ramsey at 01:13hrs, under the command of her Master, 37 year old Captain James Teare, who had some 18 years of experience working his way through the company to the position of Master. During the summer of 1909 Teare was in command of the \"King Orry\" and had only joined the \"Ellan Vannin\" the day before her ill-fated voyage. Captain Teare was married with four children.\n\n\"Ellan Vannin\" was carrying 15 passengers and 21 crew as well as mail and 60 tonnes of cargo which included approximately 60 sheep.\n\nThe weather on departure was moderate and although the barometric pressure was falling the captain did not expect a significant deterioration in the weather. The wind direction on departure was from the northwest meaning the \"Ellan Vannin\" would have a following sea during her passage – something which would have caused her master no particular concern. However, the weather rapidly worsened and by 06:35hrs, when the ship arrived at the Mersey Bar lightship, the wind had risen to a Hurricane Force 12, and waves were reported to be exceeding in height.\n\nA strong consensus at the time was that with a following sea the \"Ellan Vannin\" had made good time to the Bar Lightship. Upon reaching the Bar her course would have been changed from approximately 130 degrees to 080 degrees as she entered the approach channel to the river. This would have caused her to take the sea on her port beam with the result that she got sufficiently off her course to strike a sandbank thereby causing her to founder between the Bar lightship and the Q1 buoy, sinking in the Mersey approach channel (at ). It is believed she was broached by a large wave, which overwhelmed the ship. She was swept by heavy seas and filled, sinking by the stern with the loss of all passengers and crew.\n\nNews of the disaster reached Douglas on the Friday evening, and the directors sat in almost continuous session until Monday. Communication was by telegram and information was difficult to ascertain. At approximately 19:00hrs a telegram was received which reported that the crew of the Formby Lightship had seen lifebuoys, bags of turnips, several dead sheep and a piano floating near the lightship. It was also reported that the crew of the lightship had picked up a mail bag which was destined for the Birkenhead Post Office and which was found to contain letters despatched from Ramsey.\nThe following morning the company offices in Douglas received a telegram from Liverpool stating that one of the \"Ellan Vannin's\" lifeboats had been washed ashore at New Brighton with its cover on and its working gear inside. Also washed ashore were parts of the ship's bridge.\n\nOn Saturday morning \"Tynwald\" departed Douglas in order to replace the \"Fenella\" on the Douglas – Liverpool service, with the \"Fenella\" in turn taking the sailing to Ramsey which should have been undertaken by the \"Ellan Vannin\".\n\nIt was five days after the ship went down that the first bodies were recovered. In January 1910, Teare's body was found washed ashore on Ainsdale beach in Southport. It was subsequently returned to the Isle of Man for burial.\nThe Board of Trade inquiry found that the captain was not to blame for the disaster and the cause was extreme weather. The official inquiry referred to waves high and declared the ship to have been in good condition and fully seaworthy. After the foundering, her masts broke the surface. Divers inspecting the ship found damage to the bows and that the lifeboat davits had been swung out ready for lowering. Soon after the disaster the Mersey Docks and Harbour Board destroyed the wreck using explosives, as it was causing a hazard to shipping in the channel.\n\nA disaster fund was established for those who were dependants of the deceased, the Steam Packet contributed £1,000 to this fund. It was set up by \"The Daily Telegraph\" at writer Hall Caine’s instigation. Caine headed the list of contributors and wrote a poem \"The Loss of the Ellan Vannin\". The crew of 21 included one woman, a Mrs. Collister, of Crosby, Isle of Man, who left one child. The 20 men were survived by 18 widows and 70 children. All but two of the crew lived on the Isle of Man. Five of the passengers came from off Island, the rest from the north of the Island.\nThe last beneficiary of the fund was a Miss Benson of Ramsey, the daughter of one of the crew. She was 20 at the time of the disaster and was in very poor health. It was most unlikely that she would be the last to benefit from the fund, but she was, dying in 1974 at the age of 85.\n\nAlthough the Isle of Man Steam Packet Company has a tradition of reusing ship names, they have never reused the name .\n\nA song written by Hughie Jones of The Spinners commemorates the disaster.\n\nSecond in command to Capt. Teare was 45 year old First Officer John Craine of Leigh Terrace, Douglas, who like Capt. Teare had worked his way up through the company. During the previous summer Craine had served on the \"Mona\". Second Officer was John Kinley of Surby, Port Erin, who had previously served on the \"Fenella\". William Kelly, of Mill St, Castletown, although sailing as deck crew was a Licensed mariner who had served as Second Officer on the \"Tynwald\" during the summer. Kelly's brother was also in the employ of the Isle of Man Steam Packet Company and was also serving on the \"Ellan Vannin\" leaving the ship only a day or so before the sailing.\nOf the passengers on board, two were leaving the Isle of Man for business overseas. Mark Joughin of Ballawhannell, Bride, Isle of Man, was on his way to America to make enquiries into an estate which had been left to him. Another passenger was Edgar Blevin of the accountancy firm Kerruish, Son & Blevin of Douglas and Liverpool, whilst Christopher Heaton-Johnson of Beaconsfield Towers, Ramsey, Isle of Man, was en route to India. Thomas Quayle of Andreas, Isle of Man was a former steward for the Archdeacon of Sodor and Man, he was on his way to Liverpool in order to undergo an operation. He left a widow and three children.\nTwo of the passengers, Daniel Newell of Croydon, Surrey, and Walter Williams of Earl's Court, London, were engaged in carrying out stone work on the Catholic church, Ramsey, Isle of Man.\n\nNotes\n\nBibliography\n\n"}

He served in the Soviet Army, and according to neighbours he claimed to be a veteran of the Soviet Invasion of Afghanistan. Tkach worked as a police criminal investigator in Kemerovo Oblast, where he was recommended for admission to a Ministry of Internal Affairs school until he was caught falsifying evidence and forced to resign. Afterwards Tkach worked numerous different jobs before moving to the Ukraine SSR in 1982, where he began working again as a police criminal investigator in the Dnipropetrovsk region.\n\nIn 1984, young women and girls began to noticeably disappear across Kharkiv Oblast, Zaporizhia Oblast, Dnipropetrovsk and Crimea in eastern Ukraine, near where Tkach lived and worked. He targeted female victims, aged between 8 and 18, who would be raped, suffocated, and after they were dead performed necrophilic acts on their bodies. Tkach used his police knowledge to mislead others investigating his killings, such as choosing victims near railway lines recently treated with tar to throw police dogs off his scent.\n\nIn August 2005, Tkach attended the funeral of one of his victims, where children who were also attending claimed to have seen him with the victim shortly before her death. Tkach was arrested at his home in Polohy and admitted to his crimes, claiming to have killed over 100 people until his arrest, and demanded the death penalty. After a one-year trial, in 2008 a tribunal in Dnipropetrovsk sentenced him to life imprisonment for the murder of 37 women and girls over more than two decades. Over the years 15 men were wrongly jailed for some of the murders of which Tkach was found guilty, one of whom committed suicide, and another was not released until March 2012.\n\nA 2018 Netflix documentary titled 'Inside the World's Toughest Prisons' revealed that Tkach has fathered a child while in prison with a woman in her twenties who became infatuated with him after reading an interview in the media. She went on to marry Tkach who is allowed conjugal visits according to human rights provisions.\n\nSerhiy Tkach died in the Prison No. 8 of Zhytomyr, where he served his sentence, on November 4, 2018, at 7 p.m. local time. The cause of death was heart failure. Tkach was buried on November 7 by the prison staff as none of his relatives had claimed the body.\n"}

In the absence of weight, the collection and retention of liquid and solid waste is directed by use of air flow. Since the air used to direct the waste is returned to the cabin, it is filtered beforehand to control odor and cleanse bacteria. In older systems, waste water is vented into space, and any solids are compressed and stored for removal upon landing. More modern systems expose solid waste to vacuum pressures to kill bacteria, which prevents odor problems and kills pathogens.\n\nWhen humans travel into space, the absence of gravity causes fluids to distribute uniformly around their bodies. Their kidneys detect the fluid movement and a physiological reaction causes the humans to need to relieve themselves within two hours of departure from Earth. As a result, the space toilet has been the first device activated on shuttle flights, after astronauts unbuckle themselves.\n\nThere are four basic parts in a space toilet: the liquid waste vacuum tube, the vacuum chamber, the waste storage drawers, and the solid waste collection bags. The liquid waste vacuum tube is a 2 to long rubber or plastic hose that is attached to the vacuum chamber and connected to a fan that provides suction. At the end of the tube there is a detachable urine receptacle, which come in different versions for male and female astronauts. The male urine receptacle is a plastic funnel two to three inches in width and about four inches deep. A male astronaut urinates directly into the funnel from a distance of two or three inches away. The female funnel is oval and is two inches by four inches wide at the rim. Near the funnel's rim are small holes or slits that allow air movement to prevent excessive suction. The vacuum chamber is a cylinder about deep and six inches wide with clips on the rim where waste collection bags may be attached and a fan that provides suction. Urine is pumped into and stored in waste storage drawers. Solid waste is stored in a detachable bag made of a special fabric that lets gas (but not liquid or solid) escape, a feature that allows the fan at the back of the vacuum chamber to pull the waste into the bag. When the astronaut is finished, he or she then twists the bag and places it in a waste storage drawer. Samples of urine and solid waste are frozen and taken to Earth for testing.\n\nThe toilet used on the Space Shuttle is called the Waste Collection System (WCS). In addition to air flow, it also uses rotating fans to distribute solid waste for in-flight storage. Solid waste is distributed in a cylindrical container which is then exposed to vacuum to dry the waste. Liquid waste is vented to space. During STS-46, one of the fans malfunctioned, and crew member Claude Nicollier was required to perform in-flight maintenance (IFM). An earlier, complete failure, on the eight-day STS-3 test flight, forced its two-man crew (Jack Lousma and Gordon Fullerton) to use a fecal containment device (FCD) for waste elimination and disposal.\n\nThere are two toilets on the International Space Station, located in the Zvezda and \"Tranquility\" modules. They use a fan-driven suction system similar to the Space Shuttle WCS. Liquid waste is collected in containers. Solid waste is collected in individual micro-perforated bags which are stored in an aluminum container. Full containers are transferred to Progress for disposal. An additional Waste and Hygiene Compartment is part of the Tranquility module launched in 2010. In 2007, NASA purchased a Russian-made toilet similar to the one already aboard ISS rather than develop one internally.\n\nOn May 21, 2008, the gas liquid separator pump failed on the 7-year-old toilet in Zvezda, although the solid waste portion was still functioning. The crew attempted to replace various parts, but was unable to repair the malfunctioning part. In the interim, they used a manual mode for urine collection. The crew had other options: to use the toilet on the Soyuz transport module (which only has capacity for a few days of use) or to use urine-collection bags as needed. A replacement pump was sent from Russia in a diplomatic pouch so that Space Shuttle Discovery could take it to the station as part of mission STS-124 on June 2.\n\nThe Soviet/Russian Space Station Mir's toilet also used a system similar to the WCS.\n\nWhile the Soyuz spacecraft had an onboard toilet facility since its introduction in 1967 (due to the additional space in the Orbital Module), all Gemini and Apollo spacecraft required astronauts to urinate in a so-called \"relief tube\" in which the contents were dumped into space (an example would be the urine dump scene in the movie \"Apollo 13\"), while fecal matter was collected in specially-designed bags. The facilities were so uncomfortable that, to avoid using them, astronauts ate less than half the available food on their flights. The Skylab space station, used by NASA between May 1973 and March 1974, had an onboard WCS facility which served as a prototype for the Shuttle's WCS, but also featured an onboard shower facility. The Skylab toilet, which was designed and built by the Fairchild Republic Corp. on Long Island, was primarily a medical system to collect and return to Earth samples of urine, feces and vomit so that calcium balance in astronauts could be studied.\n\nEven with the facilities, astronauts and cosmonauts for both launch systems employ pre-launch bowel clearing and low-residue diets to minimize the need for defecation. The Soyuz toilet has been used on a return mission from Mir.\n\nNPP Zvezda is a Russian developer of space equipment, which includes zero-gravity toilets.\n\nA next-generation space toilet called the Universal Waste Management System (UWMS) is being developed by NASA for Orion and other long duration missions. It is planned to be quieter, lighter, more reliable, more hygienic and more compact than previous systems. A flight test article of the UWMS is planned to be delivered and tested on the ISS in 2018.\n\n"}

Ancient Greeks knew water nymphs in several types such as naiads (or \"nyads\"), which were divine entities that tended to be fixed in one place and so differed from gods or physical creatures.

It originally aired on February 23, 1962 on CBS.\n\nIn the mid-1920s in a small rural town in the \"southernmost section of the Midwest,\" a man, Jeff Myrtlebank, returns to life at his own funeral, causing the grievers to flee the church. The townspeople believe that the man must be possessed by a haint (a wandering demon), even though the town doctor declares it was more than likely a medical condition that imitated death; his heart stopped days prior after fighting influenza. Jeff seems normal enough, yet he has changed: he has suddenly become a hard worker with exceptional strength, yet consistently eats less since his return.\n\nDiscussing the puzzle, his mother says she is real concerned at how he's behaving: \"He's different. Not like he was at all... And the way he goes at that hard work. Why, he was never that friendly with work before.\" His father agrees with her. \"I recollect worrying many times that he leaned just a shade tow'rd this side of shiftlessness.\" \"Not lazy, exactly, but...\" his mother says, and his father completes her sentence with, \"No, no, just uninterested.\" The townsfolk and doctor discuss it further, where the doctor reveals that not only did Jeff's heart completely stop, but that he did not respond in any way to a sharp pin prick. Everyone seems as interested in what transpired during the days Jeff was dead as in how he came back to life.\n\nWhen he goes to visit his girlfriend Comfort, he takes a bouquet of roses, but the roses are all dead. Afraid, Comfort will not let him touch her after she sees them. As he leaves, her older brother confronts him and tells him to never come back, and they fight. Myrtlebank defeats him readily, punching him in his jaw. This is the first time that Myrtlebank has ever done so, after losing many past fights, and that gains Comfort's sympathy. \"Poor Jeff,\" she says. \"He hasn't got anybody.\"\n\nAfter the fight, the townsfolk gather and start saying they need to take care of this evil amongst them. Comfort races off to warn Myrtlebank and to avow her love for him. He proposes to her, but before she can respond to his proposal, angry townspeople arrive to confront the demon they believe is possessing Jeff. They demand that he leave. He insists that Comfort answer his proposal first, and she tells him yes, and that she is willing to go anywhere to be with him. Myrtlebank then makes an inspired speech in which he tells them that they are wrong and have nothing to fear from him. He also slyly threatens that if they are right, it might be in their best interests to be nice to him. They nervously accept the wisdom of this, and promise to attend Jeff and Comfort's wedding.\n\nAfter they leave, Comfort asks him, \"You couldn't really do all that, could you?\" He says he hated lying to them, but when something comes up, \"You gotta cope with it.\" As he speaks, he pulls out a pipe and a match, which lights by itself. When Comfort asks how he lit the match, he laughs and says, \"Comfort, honey, first thing you got to learn is not to imagine things.\" He puts his arm around her shoulders to take her inside. As they walk toward the house, the fence gate closes behind them on its own.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2905982", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2905982", "title": "Transdisciplinarity", "text": "Transdisciplinarity\n\nTransdisciplinarity connotes a research strategy that crosses many disciplinary boundaries to create a holistic approach. It applies to research efforts focused on problems that cross the boundaries of two or more disciplines, such as research on effective information systems for biomedical research (see bioinformatics), and can refer to concepts or methods that were originally developed by one discipline, but are now used by several others, such as ethnography, a field research method originally developed in anthropology but now widely used by other disciplines.\nThe Belmont Forum elaborated that a transdisciplinary approach is enabling inputs and scoping across scientific and non-scientific stakeholder communities and facilitating a systemic way of addressing a challenge. This includes initiatives that support the capacity building required for the successful transdisciplinary formulation and implementation of research actions.\n\nTransdisciplinarity has two common meanings:\n\nIn German-speaking countries, \"Transdisziplinarität\" refers to the integration of diverse forms of research, and includes specific methods for relating knowledge in problem-solving. A 2003 conference held at the University of Göttingen showcased the diverse meanings of multi-, inter- and transdisciplinarity and made suggestions for converging them without eliminating present usages.\n\nWhen the very nature of a problem is under dispute, transdisciplinarity can help determine the most relevant problems and research questions involved. A first type of question concerns the cause of the present problems and their future development (system knowledge). Another concerns which values and norms can be used to form goals of the problem-solving process (target knowledge). A third relates to how a problematic situation can be transformed and improved (transformation knowledge). Transdisciplinarity requires adequate addressing of the complexity of problems and the diversity of perceptions of them, that abstract and case-specific knowledge are linked, and that practices promote the common good.\n\nTransdisciplinarity arises when participating experts interact in an open discussion and dialogue, giving equal weight to each perspective and relating them to each other. This is difficult because of the overwhelming amount of information involved, and because of incommensurability of specialized languages in each field of expertise. To excel under these conditions, researchers need not only in-depth knowledge and know-how of the disciplines involved, but skills in moderation, mediation, association and transfer.\n\nTransdisciplinarity is also used to signify a unity of knowledge beyond disciplines.\n\nJean Piaget introduced this usage of the term in 1970, and in 1987, the International Center for Transdisciplinary Research (CIRET) adopted the Charter of Transdisciplinarity at the 1st World Congress of Transdisciplinarity, Convento da Arrabida, Portugal, November 1994.\n\nIn the CIRET approach, transdisciplinarity is radically distinct from interdisciplinarity. Interdisciplinarity, like pluridisciplinarity, concerns the transfer of methods from one discipline to another, allowing research to spill over disciplinary boundaries, but staying within the framework of disciplinary research.\n\nAs the prefix \"trans\" indicates, transdisciplinarity concerns that which is at once between the disciplines, across the different disciplines, and beyond each individual discipline. Its goal is the understanding of the present world, of which one of the imperatives is the overarching unity of knowledge.\n\nAnother critical defining characteristic of transdisciplinary research is the inclusion of stakeholders in defining research objectives and strategies in order to better incorporate the diffusion of learning produced by the research. Collaboration between stakeholders is deemed essential – not merely at an academic or disciplinary collaboration level, but through active collaboration with people affected by the research and community-based stakeholders. In such a way, transdisciplinary collaboration becomes uniquely capable of engaging with different ways of knowing the world, generating new knowledge, and helping stakeholders understand and incorporate the results or lessons learned by the research.\n\nTransdisciplinarity is defined by Basarab Nicolescu through three methodological postulates: the existence of levels of Reality, the logic of the included middle, and complexity. In the presence of several levels of Reality the space between disciplines and beyond disciplines is full of information. Disciplinary research concerns, at most, one and the same level of Reality ; moreover, in most cases, it only concerns fragments of one level of Reality. On the contrary, transdisciplinarity concerns the dynamics engendered by the action of several levels of Reality at once. The discovery of these dynamics necessarily passes through disciplinary knowledge. While not a new discipline or a new superdiscipline, transdisciplinarity is nourished by disciplinary research; in turn, disciplinary research is clarified by transdisciplinary knowledge in a new, fertile way. In this sense, disciplinary and transdisciplinary research are not antagonistic but complementary. As in the case of disciplinarity, transdisciplinary research is not antagonistic but complementary to multidisciplinarity and interdisciplinarity research.\n\nAccording to Nicolescu, transdisciplinarity is nevertheless radically distinct from multidisciplinarity and interdisciplinarity because of its goal, the understanding of the present world, which cannot be accomplished in the framework of disciplinary research. The goal of multidisciplinarity and interdisciplinarity always remains within the framework of disciplinary research. If transdisciplinarity is often confused with interdisciplinarity or multidisciplinarity (and by the same token, we note that interdisciplinarity is often confused with multidisciplinarity) this is explained in large part by the fact that all three overflow disciplinary boundaries. Advocates maintain this confusion hides the huge potential of transdisciplinarity.\n\nCurrently, transdisciplinarity is a consolidated academic field that is giving rise to new applied researches, especially in Latin America and the Caribbean. In this sense, the transdisciplinary and biomimetics research of Javier Collado on Big History represents an ecology of knowledge between scientific knowledge and the ancestral wisdom of native peoples, such as Indigenous peoples in Ecuador. According to Collado, the transdisciplinary methodology applied in the field of Big History seeks to understand the interconnections of the human race with the different levels of reality that co-exist in nature and in the cosmos, and this includes mystical and spiritual experiences, very present in the rituals of shamanism with ayahuasca and other sacred plants. In abstract, the teaching of Big History in universities of Brazil, Ecuador, Colombia, and Argentina implies a transdisciplinary vision that integrates and unifies diverse epistemes that are in, between, and beyond the scientific disciplines, that is, including ancestral wisdom, spirituality, art, emotions, mystical experiences and other dimensions forgotten in the history of science, specially by the positivist approach.\n\nTransdisciplinarity can be found in the arts and humanities. For example, the Planetary Collegium seeks \"the development of transdisciplinary discourse in the convergence of art, science, technology and consciousness research.\" The Plasticities Sciences Arts (PSA) research group also develops transdisiciplinary approaches regarding humanities and fundamental sciences relationships as well as the Art & Science field.\n\nTransdisciplinarity can be also found in Global Education. For example, Global Education Magazine, an international journal supported by UNESCO and UNHCR:\n\"transdisciplinarity represents the capable germ to promote an endogenous development of the evolutionary spirit of internal critical consciousness, where religion and science are complementary. Respect, solidarity and cooperation should be global standards for the entire human development with no boundaries. This requires a radical change in the ontological models of sustainable development, global education and world-society. We must rely on the recognition of a plurality of models, cultures and socio-economical diversification. As well as biodiversity is the way for the emergence of new species, cultural diversity represents the creative potential of world-society.\" \n\nThe range of transdisciplinarity becomes clear when the four central questions of biological research ((1) \"causation\", (2) \"ontogeny,\" (3) adaptation, (4) phylogeny [after Niko Tinbergen 1963, see also Tinbergen's four questions, cf. Aristotle: Causality / Four Major Causes]) are graphed against distinct levels of analysis (e.g. cell, organ, \"individual, group\"; [cf. \"Laws about the Levels of Complexity\" of Nicolai Hartmann 1940/1964, see also Rupert Riedl 1984]):\n\nIn this \"scheme of transdisciplinarity\", all anthropological disciplines (paragraph C in the table of the pdf-file below), their questions (paragraph A: see pdf-file) and results (paragraph B: see pdf-file) can be intertwined and allocated with each other for examples how these aspects go into those little boxes in the matrix, see e.g. the table This chart includes all realms of anthropological research (no one is excluded). It is the starting point for a systematical order for all human sciences, and also a source for a consistent networking and structuring of their results. This \"bio-psycho-social\" orientation framework is the basis for the development of the \"Fundamental Theory of Human Sciences\" and for a transdisciplinary consensus. (In this tabulated orientation matrix the questions and reference levels in \"italics\" are also the subject of the humanities.). Niko Tinbergen was familiar with both conceptual categories (i.e. the four central questions of biological research and the levels of analysis), the tabulation was made by Gerhard Medicus. Certainly, a humanist perspective always involves a transdisciplinary focus. A good and classic example of mixing very different sciences was the work developed by Leibniz in seventeenth-eighteenth centuries in order to create a universal system of justice.\n\n\n\n"}

Though often mistaken for a Tennessee Walking Horse, his sire was a Thoroughbred and his dam a grade (unregistered) mare who, like Trigger, was a palomino. Movie director William Witney, who directed Roy and Trigger in many of their movies, claimed a slightly different lineage, that his sire was a \"registered\" Palomino stallion, though no known Palomino registry existed at the time of Trigger's birth, and his dam was by a Thoroughbred and out of a \"cold-blood\" mare. Horses other than Golden Cloud also portrayed \"Trigger\" over the years, none of which was related to Golden Cloud, the two most prominent of which were palominos known as \"Little Trigger\" and \"Trigger Jr.\" (who was a Tennessee Walking Horse listed as \"Allen's Gold Zephyr\" in the Tennessee Walking Horse registry). Though Trigger remained a stallion his entire life, he was never bred and has no descendants. On the other hand, Roy Rogers used \"Trigger Jr.\"/\"Allen's Golden Zephyr\" at stud for many years, and the horse named \"Triggerson\" that actor Val Kilmer led on stage as a tribute to Rogers and his cowboy peers during the Academy Awards show in March 1999 was reportedly a grandson of \"Trigger Jr.\"\n\nGolden Cloud made an early appearance as the mount of Maid Marian, played by Olivia de Havilland in \"The Adventures of Robin Hood\" (1938). A short while later, when Roy Rogers was preparing to make his first movie in a starring role, he was offered a choice of five rented \"movie\" horses to ride and chose Golden Cloud. Rogers bought him eventually in 1943 and renamed him Trigger for his quickness of both foot and mind. Trigger learned 150 trick cues and could walk 50 feet (15 meters) on his hind legs (according to sources close to Roy Rogers). They were said to have run out of places to cue Trigger. Trigger became such a ham that as soon as he heard applause he would start bowing and ruin that trick. He could sit in a chair, sign his name \"X\" with a pencil, lie down for a nap and cover himself with a blanket. Roger's most carefully guarded trade secret was to get Trigger housebroken. \"Spending as much time as he does in hotels, theaters, and hospitals, this ability comes in might handy and it's conceded by most trainers to be Trigger's greatest accomplishment.\" —Glenn Randall, wrangler with Hudkins Stables.\n\nHis horse was so important to Rogers that when he purchased a \"Best Wishes for the New Year\" advertisement in \"Variety\", he signed it \"Roy Rogers and Trigger\". Trigger was ridden by Rogers in many of his motion pictures, becoming much loved by the youthful audience that saw him on film and in Rogers' 1950s television series with his wife Dale Evans, who rode her trusty buckskin Quarter Horse Buttermilk.\nTrigger became the most famous horse in film entertainment, even having his own Dell comic book recounting his exploits.\n\nRoy Rogers made many personal appearances with Trigger in tow. More than once Rogers escorted Trigger up 3-4 flights of stairs at hospitals to visit with sick children, according to his autobiography \"Happy Trails.\"\n\nAfter the original Trigger (Golden Cloud) died in 1965 at Rogers' new ranch in Apple Valley, California, Rogers arranged for Everett Wilkensen of Bischoff's Taxidermy in Los Angeles (now Bischoff's Taxidermy and Animal FX in Burbank, California) to preserve/mount the horse. The hide was professionally stretched over a foam likeness of Trigger, and the resulting mount was put on display in the Roy Rogers and Dale Evans Museum when it opened in Apple Valley, California in 1967. The mount was later moved with the museum to first Victorville, California in 1976, and then to Branson, Missouri in 2003.\n\nAt some point, a 24-foot (7 meters) replica of a rearing Trigger was produced to sit atop the Roy Rogers Museum in Victorville. The 1,300-pound (600 kg) replica could be seen from the freeway and served as a landmark until the museum closed and moved to Branson. When the fiberglass replica of Trigger was being made, Rogers was approached by the owners of the Denver Broncos. Rogers allowed another statue to be made and then broke the mold. \"Bucky the Bronco\", Trigger's twin, stands above the south scoreboard of the Denver Broncos stadium.\n\nAfter the closing of the Victorville museum in 2009, its contents were placed at public auction on July 14–15, 2010, at Christie's auction house in New York City. Trigger's preserved taxidermy remains sold for $266,500 to television channel RFD-TV, which plans to start a Western museum. Bob Tinsley, a Victorville developer who had built Roy Rogers' home in nearby Apple Valley, bought the fiberglass replica in April 2010. Tinsley's plan is to make the statue a part of historic Apple Valley Village. He explained, \"I just couldn't see letting him go anywhere else.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

It is available to anyone with a child whose husband, wife or civil partner has died. The claimant must get Child Benefit for at least one child and the late husband, wife or civil partner was their parent.\n\nIt is not available if the partners were divorced at the time of death, if the claimant is in prison, if they remarry or are cohabitating with another person by means of living together as a married couple.\n\nIn 2013 the maximum payment is £108.30 a week. It is taxable, but it is not affected by the receipt of other income. It is counted in full for all means-tested benefits. The amount payable is dependent on the National Insurance contributions paid by the deceased. It could be affected by the benefit cap. It continues while Child Benefit continues.\n\nIn July 2013 it was reported that the government was planning changes in the Pensions Bill 2012 going through parliament, which would limit this benefit to a maximum of £400 a month paid out for just 12 months, with a lump sum of £5,000 following bereavement. The 43,500 families already in receipt of the allowance would be unaffected by the reforms. The Department of Work and Pensions estimated that in 2016 the government expects to pay £590m a year to bereaved couples and families. With the changes, payments would drop to £530m by 2020.\n\nWidowed Parent's Allowance\n"}
