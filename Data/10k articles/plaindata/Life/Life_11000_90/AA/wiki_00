Over 30 publications exist describing its use first for nucleosome positioning from Valouev et al., transcriptional profiling or strand sensitive RNA-Seq with Cloonan et al., single cell transcriptional profiling with Tang et al. and ultimately human resequencing with McKernan et al.\n\nThe method used by this machine (sequencing-by-ligation) has been reported to have some issue sequencing palindromic sequences.\n\nA library of DNA fragments is prepared from the sample to be sequenced, and is used to prepare clonal bead populations. That is, only one species of fragment will be present on the surface of each magnetic bead. The fragments attached to the magnetic beads will have a universal P1 adapter sequence attached so that the starting sequence of every fragment is both known and identical. Emulsion PCR takes place in microreactors containing all the necessary reagents for PCR. The resulting PCR products attached to the beads are then covalently bound to a glass slide.\n\nPrimers hybridize to the P1 adapter sequence within the library template. A set of four fluorescently labelled di-base probes compete for ligation to the sequencing primer. Specificity of the di-base probe is achieved by interrogating every 1st and 2nd base in each ligation reaction. Multiple cycles of ligation, detection and cleavage are performed with the number of cycles determining the eventual read length. Following a series of ligation cycles, the extension product is removed and the template is reset with a primer complementary to the n-1 position for a second round of ligation cycles.\n\nFive rounds of primer reset are completed for each sequence tag. Through the primer reset process, each base is interrogated in two independent ligation reactions by two different primers. For example, the base at read position 5 is assayed by primer number 2 in ligation cycle 2 and by primer number 3 in ligation cycle 1.\n\nAccording to ABI, the SOLiD 3plus platform yields 60 gigabases of usable DNA data per run. Due to the two base encoding system, an inherent accuracy check is built into the technology and offers 99.94% accuracy. The chemistry of the systems also means that it is not hindered by homopolymers unlike the Roche 454 FLX system and so large and difficult homopolymer repeat regions are no longer a problem to sequence.\n\nNaturally the technology will be used to sequence DNA, but because of the high parallel nature of all next generation technologies they also have applications in transcriptomics and epigenomics.\n\nMicroarrays was once the mainstay of the transcriptomics the last ten years and array based technology has subsequently branched out to other areas. However, they are limited in that only information can be obtained for probes that are on the chip. Only information for organisms for which chips are available can obtained, and they come with all the problems of hybridizing large numbers of molecules (differing hybridizing temperatures). RNA-Seq transcriptomics by next gen sequencing will mean these barriers no longer hold true. Any organism's entire transcriptome could be potentially sequenced in one run (for very small bacterial genomes) and not only would the identification of each transcript be available but expression profiling is possible as quantitative reads can also be achieved.\n\nChromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) is a method for determining transcription factor binding sites and DNA-protein interactions. It has in the past been combined with array technology (ChIP-chip) with some success. Next gen sequencing can also be applied in this area. Methylation immunoprecipitation (MeDIP) can also be performed and also on arrays.\n\nThe ability to learn more about methylation and TF binding sites on a genome wide scale is a valuable resource and could teach us much about disease and molecular biology in general.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "307157", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=307157", "title": "Andean condor", "text": "Andean condor\n\nThe Andean condor (\"Vultur gryphus\") is a South American bird in the New World vulture family Cathartidae and is the only member of the genus Vultur. Found in the Andes mountains and adjacent Pacific coasts of western South America, the Andean condor is the largest flying bird in the world by combined measurement of weight and wingspan. It has a maximum wingspan of exceeded only by the wingspans of four seabirds and water birds—the roughly maximum of the wandering albatross, southern royal albatross, great white pelican and Dalmatian pelican.\n\nIt is a large black vulture with a ruff of white feathers surrounding the base of the neck and, especially in the male, large white patches on the wings. The head and neck are nearly featherless, and are a dull red color, which may flush and therefore change color in response to the bird's emotional state. In the male, there is a wattle on the neck and a large, dark red comb or caruncle on the crown of the head. Unlike most birds of prey, the male is larger than the female.\n\nThe condor is primarily a scavenger, feeding on carrion. It prefers large carcasses, such as those of deer or cattle. It reaches sexual maturity at five or six years of age and nests at elevations of up to , generally on inaccessible rock ledges. One or two eggs are usually laid. It is one of the world's longest-living birds, with a lifespan of over 70 years in some cases.\n\nThe Andean condor is a national symbol of Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru and plays an important role in the folklore and mythology of the Andean regions. The Andean condor is considered near threatened by the IUCN. It is threatened by habitat loss and by secondary poisoning from carcasses killed by hunters. Captive breeding programs have been instituted in several countries.\n\nThe Andean condor was described by Swedish scientist Carl Linnaeus in 1758 in the tenth edition of his \"Systema Naturae\" and retains its original binomial name of \"Vultur gryphus\". The Andean condor is sometimes called the Argentinean condor, Bolivian condor, Chilean condor, Colombian condor, Ecuadorian condor, or Peruvian condor after one of the nations to which it is native. The generic term \"Vultur\" is directly taken from the Latin \"vultur\" or \"voltur\", which means \"vulture\". Its specific epithet is derived from a variant of the Greek word γρυπός (\"grupós\", \"hook-nosed\"). The word condor itself is derived from the Quechua \"kuntur\".\n\nThe exact taxonomic placement of the Andean condor and the remaining six species of New World vultures remains unclear. Although both are similar in appearance and have similar ecological roles, the New World and Old World vultures evolved from different ancestors in different parts of the world and are not closely related. Just how different the two families are is currently under debate, with some earlier authorities suggesting that the New World vultures are more closely related to storks. More recent authorities maintain their overall position in the order Falconiformes along with the Old World vultures or place them in their own order, Cathartiformes. The South American Classification Committee has removed the New World vultures from Ciconiiformes and instead described them as \"incertae sedis\", but notes that a move to Falconiformes or Cathartiformes is possible.\n\nThe Andean condor is the only accepted living species of its genus, \"Vultur\". Unlike the California condor (\"Gymnogyps californianus\"), which is known from extensive fossil remains and some additional ones of congeners, the fossil record of the Andean condor recovered to date is scant. Presumed Plio-Pleistocene species of South American condors were later recognized to be not different from the present species, although one known only from a few rather small bones found in a Pliocene deposit of Tarija Department, Bolivia, may have been a smaller palaeosubspecies, \"V. gryphus patruus\".\n\nAlthough it is on average about seven to eight cm shorter from beak to tail than the California condor, the Andean condor is larger in wingspan, which ranges from . It is also typically heavier, reaching a weight of for males and for females. Overall length can range from . Among standard measurements, the wing chord is , the tail is and the tarsus is . Measurements are usually taken from specimens reared in captivity. The mean weight is , with the males averaging about a kilogram more at , the females a kilogram less at . According to a recently published manual of avian body masses, the species possesses the heaviest average weight for any living flying bird or animal, ahead of competitors such as trumpeter swans (\"Cygnus buccinator\") and Dalmatian pelicans (\"Pelecanus crispus\"). However, another resources claims a mean species body mass of for the Andean condor. The Andean condor is the largest living land bird capable of flight if measured in terms of average weight and wingspan, although male bustards of the largest species (far more sexually dimorphic in size) can weigh more at maximum. The mean wingspan is around and the wings have the largest surface area (measured in square centimeters) of any extant bird. Among living bird species, only the great albatrosses and the two largest species of pelican exceed the Andean condor in average and maximal wingspan.\n\nThe adult plumage is a uniform black, with the exception of a frill of white feathers nearly surrounding the base of the neck and, especially in the male, large patches or bands of white on the wings which do not appear until the completion of the bird's first moulting. The head and neck are red to blackish-red and have few feathers. The head and neck are meticulously kept clean by the bird, and their baldness is an adaptation for hygiene, allowing the skin to be exposed to the sterilizing effects of dehydration and ultraviolet light at high altitudes. The crown of the head is flattened. In the male, the head is crowned with a dark red caruncle or comb, while the skin of his neck lies in folds, forming a wattle. The skin of the head and neck is capable of flushing noticeably in response to emotional state, which serves to communicate between individuals. Juveniles have a grayish-brown general coloration, blackish head and neck skin, and a brown ruff.\nThe middle toe is greatly elongated, and the hind one is only slightly developed, while the talons of all the toes are comparatively straight and blunt. The feet are thus more adapted to walking, and are of little use as weapons or organs of prehension as in birds of prey and Old World vultures. The beak is hooked, and adapted to tear rotting meat. The irises of the male are brown, while those of the female are deep red. The eyelids lack eyelashes. Contrary to the usual rule for sexual dimorphism among birds of prey, the female is smaller than the male.\n\nThe Andean condor is found in South America in the Andes, including the Santa Marta Mountains. In the north, its range begins in Venezuela and Colombia, where it is extremely rare, then continues south along the Andes in Ecuador, Peru, and Chile, through Bolivia and western Argentina to the Tierra del Fuego. In the early 19th century, the Andean condor bred from western Venezuela to Tierra del Fuego, along the entire chain of the Andes, but its range has been greatly reduced due to human activity. Its habitat is mainly composed of open grasslands and alpine areas up to in elevation. It prefers relatively open, non-forested areas which allow it to spot carrion from the air, such as the páramo or rocky, mountainous areas in general. It occasionally ranges to lowlands in eastern Bolivia and southwestern Brazil, descends to lowland desert areas in Chile and Peru, and is found over southern-beech forests in Patagonia.\n\nThe condor soars with its wings held horizontally and its primary feathers bent upwards at the tips. The lack of a large sternum to anchor its correspondingly large flight muscles physiologically identifies it as primarily being a soarer. It flaps its wings on rising from the ground, but after attaining a moderate elevation it flaps its wings very rarely, relying on thermals to stay aloft. Charles Darwin commented on having watched them for half an hour without once observing a flap of their wings. It prefers to roost on high places from which it can launch without major wing-flapping effort. Andean condors are often seen soaring near rock cliffs, using the heat thermals to aid them in rising in the air.\n\nLike other New World vultures, the Andean condor has the unusual habit of urohidrosis: it often empties its cloaca onto its legs and feet. A cooling effect through evaporation has been proposed as a reason for this behavior, but it does not make any sense in the cold Andean habitat of the bird. Because of this habit, their legs are often streaked with a white buildup of uric acid.\n\nThere is a well-developed social structure within large groups of condors, with competition to determine a 'pecking order' by body language, competitive play behavior, and vocalizations. Generally, mature males tend to be at the top of the pecking order, with post-dispersal immature males tending to be near the bottom.\n\nSexual maturity and breeding behavior do not appear in the Andean condor until the bird is five or six years of age. It may live to 50 years or more, and it mates for life. During courtship displays, the skin of the male's neck flushes, changing from dull red to bright yellow, and inflates. He approaches the female with neck outstretched, revealing the inflated neck and the chest patch, while hissing, then extends his wings and stands erect while clicking his tongue. Other courtship rituals include hissing and clucking while hopping with wings partially spread, and dancing. The Andean condor prefers to roost and breed at elevations of . Its nest, which consists of a few sticks placed around the eggs, is created on inaccessible ledges of rock. However, in coastal areas of Peru, where there are few cliffs, some nests are simply partially shaded crannies scraped out against boulders on slopes. It deposits one or two bluish-white eggs, weighing about and ranging from in length, during the months of February and March every second year. The egg hatches after 54 to 58 days of incubation by both parents. If the chick or egg is lost or removed, another egg is laid to take its place. Researchers and breeders take advantage of this behavior to double the reproductive rate by taking the first egg away for hand-rearing, causing the parents to lay a second egg, which they are generally allowed to raise.\n\nThe young are covered with a grayish down until they are almost as large as their parents. They are able to fly after six months, but continue to roost and hunt with their parents until age two, when they are displaced by a new clutch. Healthy adults have no natural predators, but large birds of prey and mammalian predators, like foxes, may take eggs or hatchlings. Predation is relatively uncommon, since the vigilant parents often aggressively displace birds of prey who come near and the rocky, precipitous location of most nests are difficult for mammals to access.\n\nThe Andean condor is a scavenger, feeding mainly on carrion. Wild condors inhabit large territories, often traveling more than a day in search of carrion. In inland areas, they prefer large carcasses. Naturally, they feed on the largest carcasses available, which can include llamas (\"Lama glama\"), alpacas (\"Vicugna pacos\"), rheas (\"Rhea ssp.\"), guanacos (\"Lama guanicoe\"), deer and armadillos. Wild individuals could acquire extra carotenoids from vegetal matter contained in carcass viscera and fresh vegetation. However, most inland condors now live largely off of domestic animals, which are now more widespread in South America, such as cattle (\"Bos primigenius taurus\"), horses (\"Equus ferus caballus\"), donkeys (\"Equus africanus a sinus\"), mules, sheep (\"Ovis aries\"), pigs (\"Sus scrofa domesticus\"), goats (\"Capra aegagrus hircus\") and dogs (\"Canis lupus familiaris\"). They also feed on the carcasses of introduced game species such as wild boars (\"Sus scrofa\"), rabbits (\"Oryctolagus cuniculus\"), foxes (\"Vulpes vulpes\") and red deer (\"Cervus elaphus\"). For condors who live around the coast, the diet consists mainly of beached carcasses of marine mammals, largely cetaceans. They will also raid the nests of smaller birds to feed on the eggs. Andean condors have been observed to do some hunting of small, live animals, such as rodents, birds and rabbits, which (given their lack of powerful, grasping feet or developed hunting technique) they usually kill by jabbing repeatedly with their bill.\n\nCoastal areas provide a constant food supply, and in particularly plentiful areas, some Andean condors limit their foraging area to several kilometers of beach-front land. They locate carrion by spotting it or by following other scavengers, such as corvids or other vultures. It may follow New World vultures of the genus \"Cathartes\"—the turkey vulture (\"C. aura\"), the lesser yellow-headed vulture (\"C. burrovianus\"), and the greater yellow-headed vulture (\"C. melambrotus\")—to carcasses. The \"Cathartes\" vultures forage by smell, detecting the scent of ethyl mercaptan, a gas produced by the beginnings of decay in dead animals. These smaller vultures cannot rip through the tougher hides of these larger animals with the efficiency of the larger condor, and their interactions are often an example of mutual dependence between species. Black vultures (\"Coragyps atratus\"), king vultures (\"Sarcoramphus papa\") and even mammalian scavengers may sometimes track \"Cathartes\" vultures for carcasses but the condor is invariably dominant among the scavengers in its range. Andean condors are intermittent eaters in the wild, often going for a few days without eating, then gorging themselves on several pounds at once, sometimes to the point of being unable to lift off the ground. Because its feet and talons are not adapted to grasping, it must feed while on the ground. Like other carrion-feeders, it plays an important role in its ecosystem by disposing of carrion which would otherwise be a breeding ground for disease.\n\nBeing a slowly-maturing bird with no known natural predators in adulthood, an Andean condor is a long-lived bird. Longevity and mortality rates are not known to have been extensively studied in the wild. Some estimations of lifespans of wild birds has exceeded 50 years. In 1983, the Guinness Book of World Records considered the longest-lived bird of any species with a confirmed lifespan was an Andean condor that died after surviving 72 years in captivity, having been captured from the wild as a juvenile of undetermined age. Several species of parrot have been reported to live for perhaps over 100 years, but these (at least in 1983) were not considered authenticated. Another early captive-held specimen of condor reportedly lived for 71 years. However, these lifespans have been exceeded by a male, nicknamed \"Thaao\", that was kept Beardsley Zoo in Connecticut. Thaao was born in captivity in 1930 and died on January 26, 2010, making him 79 years of age. This would be the greatest verified age ever known for a bird.\n\nThe Andean condor is considered near threatened by the IUCN. It was first placed on the United States Endangered Species list in 1970, a status which is assigned to an animal that is in danger of extinction throughout all or a significant portion of its range. Threats to its population include loss of habitat needed for foraging, secondary poisoning from animals killed by hunters and persecution. It is threatened mainly in the northern area of its range, and is extremely rare in Venezuela and Colombia, where it has undergone considerable declines in recent years. Because it is adapted to very low mortality and has correspondingly low reproductive rates, it is extremely vulnerable to human persecution, most of which stems from the fact that it is perceived as a threat by farmers due to alleged attacks on livestock. Education programs have been implemented by conservationists to dispel this misconception. Reintroduction programs using captive-bred Andean condors, which release birds hatched in North American zoos into the wild to bolster populations, have been introduced in Argentina, Venezuela, and Colombia. The first captive-bred Andean condors were released into the wild in 1989. When raising condors, human contact is minimal; chicks are fed with glove puppets which resemble adult Andean condors in order to prevent the chicks from imprinting on humans, which would endanger them upon release as they would not be wary of humans. The condors are kept in aviaries for three months prior to release, where they acclimatize to an environment similar to that which they will be released in. Released condors are tracked by satellite in order to observe their movements and to monitor whether they are still alive.\n\nIn response to the capture of all the wild individuals of the California condor, in 1988 the US Fish and Wildlife Service began a reintroduction experiment involving the release of captive Andean condors into the wild in California. Only females were released to prevent it becoming an invasive species. The experiment was a success, and all the Andean condors were recaptured and re-released in South America before the reintroduction of the California condors took place.\n\nIn June 2014, local authorities of the Ancasmarca region rescued two Andean condors that were caged and displayed in a local market as an attraction for tourists.\n\nThe Andean condor is a national symbol of Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and Venezuelan Andes states. It is the national bird of Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, and Ecuador. It plays an important role in the folklore and mythology of the South American Andean regions, and has been represented in Andean art from c. 2500 BCE onward, and they are a part of indigenous Andean religions. In Andean mythology, the Andean condor was associated with the sun deity, and was believed to be the ruler of the upper world. The Andean condor is considered a symbol of power and health by many Andean cultures, and it was believed that the bones and organs of the Andean condor possessed medicinal powers, sometimes leading to the hunting and killing of condors to obtain its bones and organs. In some versions of Peruvian bullfighting, a condor is tied to the back of a bull, where it pecks at the animal as bullfighters fight it. The condor generally survives and is set free.\n\nIn Peru, they are occasionally shot, but more often revered and used for ceremonial purposes. The Yawar Fiesta is a celebration, the pinnacle of which is the tying of an Andean condor to the back of a bull, allowing the condor to kill the bull with its talons before being released. This ceremony is a symbolic representation of the power of the Andean peoples (the condor) over the Spanish (the bull). There is also a ceremony known as the \"arranque del condor\" in which a live Andean condor is suspended from a frame and is punched to death by horsemen as they ride by.\n\nCondorito is a Chilean comic book and comic strip that features an anthropomorphic condor living in a fictitious town named Pelotillehue, a typical small Chilean provincial town. He is meant to be a representation of the Chilean people.\n\nThe Andean condor is a popular figure on stamps in many countries, appearing on one for Ecuador in 1958, Argentina in 1960, Peru in 1973, Bolivia in 1985, Colombia in 1992, Chile in 2001, and Venezuela in 2004. It has also appeared on the coins and banknotes of Colombia and Chile. The condor is featured in several coats of arms of Andean countries as a symbol of Andes mountains.\n\nThe Andean condor is depicted on the logo of Avianca and Aerolineas Argentinas, which are two of the largest airlines in South America. \n\n"}

He played college football for the University of Colorado, earning consensus All-American recognition. The Dallas Cowboys selected him in the second round of the 2002 NFL Draft. He is a five-time Pro Bowl selection, and has also played for the Baltimore Ravens, Chicago Bears, and Oakland Raiders.\n\nGurode was born in Houston, Texas. He played high school football at North Shore High School in Houston. As a senior, \"USA Today\", PrepStar and SuperPrep selected him as an honorable mention high school All-America. He was also named to the \" Houston Chronicle\" Top 100 List and made the Austin American-Statesman \"Fab 55\" team. He earned All-Area honors as a senior (second team honors as a junior), and was All-District and All-Greater Houston as a junior and senior (when he also was his team's most outstanding offensive lineman).\n\nGurode lettered three times in basketball and four times in track with personal bests of 186' 0\" in the discus and 54' 1\" in the shot put.\n\nGurode attended the University of Colorado, where he played for the Colorado Buffaloes football team from 1998 to 2001. He was a four-year starter for the Buffaloes, playing both center and guard on the offensive line. He started his first two and a half seasons at center, before moving to guard in the middle of his junior year. As a junior in 2000, he started the first six games of the year at center and the final five games at guard. He received the John Mack Award, as selected by the coaches for being Colorado's most outstanding offensive player and was also selected honorable mention All-Big 12 Conference honors while helping the Buffaloes to a 7–5 record and a win over the Boston College Eagles in the Insight.com Bowl. As a senior, he started every game at right guard.\n\nGurode was a first-team All-Big 12 selection in 2000 and 2001, and was recognized as a consensus first-team All-American as a senior in 2001. During his career he allowed just 7.5 sacks in 2,653 plays as a starter for the Buffaloes.\n\nHe earned a degree in ethnic studies from the University of Colorado, where he was a member of the school's \"Academic Starters\" team.\n\nGurode initially projected as a guard and was ranked the best available in the 2002 NFL Draft, along with Kendall Simmons. He was regarded as an early second round pick, and was eventually selected 37th overall by the Dallas Cowboys.\n\nGurode was drafted by the Dallas Cowboys in the second round of the 2002 NFL Draft as a center. He started fast by becoming the first rookie in club history to start at center on opening day.\n\nIt is believed 2002 was the first time a NFL franchise had five African-American starters on their offensive line, when the Cowboys lined up Gurode at center, tackles Flozell Adams and Solomon Page, guards Larry Allen and Kelvin Garmon. Gurode also became part of history as the starting center on the Cowboys offensive line that helped Emmitt Smith eclipse Walter Payton as the NFL's all-time leading rusher, playing against the Seattle Seahawks on October 27. While he started the first six games of the 2002 season at center, Gurode was moved to help compensate for the number of injuries along the offensive line, compiling another eight starts at right guard.\n\nIn 2003, Bill Parcells was hired as the Cowboys head coach and decided that Gurode's best position was at guard, starting 15 games at that position in 2003 and 13 games in 2004 with mixed results, before getting benched for the final two games.\n\nAt the start of the 2005 season, Parcells accepted he made a misjudgment by moving Gurode to guard and switched him back to center, with the Cowboys also signing Marco Rivera to take his place at guard. That season, he was a versatile backup, playing behind Al Johnson at center and Rivera at right guard.\n\nIn 2006, he rededicated himself to football and won the starting center job again, over Al Johnson. On October 1, 2006, in the third quarter of a game against the Tennessee Titans, Titans defensive tackle Albert Haynesworth stomped on Gurode's head. Haynesworth's cleats caused a laceration requiring thirty stitches. Haynesworth was ejected, and subsequently suspended by the NFL for five games without pay.\n\nFollowing the 2006 season, Gurode was named to his first Pro Bowl as an injury replacement. On February 20, 2007, the Cowboys re-signed Gurode to a six-year contract worth US$30 million including a $10 million signing bonus.\n\nGurode developed into one of the league's most respected centers since returning to being a full-time starter in 2006, and has been selected to the All-Pro Team (2007, 2009), as well as to five straight Pro Bowls (2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010)\n\nHe had offseason left knee surgery and missed the 2011 season training camp and three out of four preseason games. With the emergence of second-year player Phil Costa, he was released after the preseason following failed negotiations regarding a restructured contract.\n\nGurode reportedly visited the Detroit Lions and New England Patriots before signing a 1-year, $3 million contract with the Baltimore Ravens on September 4, 2011.\n\nOn November 27, 2012, the Chicago Bears signed Gurode after losing guards Lance Louis and Chris Spencer to injuries sustained in a game against the Minnesota Vikings on November 25.

She first appeared in \"Flash: Iron Heights\" (2001).\n\nFor 15 years, Amunet Black has been running and operating the Network an underground black market in Central and Keystone City, the twin cities, for supervillains to buy, sell, or move contraband. During that time, she had a brief marriage to Goldface. When they divorced, she stole the elixir that gave him his powers and changed it to gain the ability to merge metal with flesh and shape it to her will. She was able to keep the Network hidden from the authorities and if any villain reformed or quit crime, she made sure the memories of the Network were erased from their minds. When her ex-husband and criminal profiler Hunter Zolomon (the future Zoom) were about to find out about the Network, she sent the Trickster II to stop them. Soon, with a vision of power, Blacksmith planned out her takeover of the twin cities, with her as the leader.\n\nFirst, she organized a new group of rogues, which consisted of the Weather Wizard, Mirror Master II, Magenta, Murmur, Girder, Plunder, and Trickster II. She made sure that her rogues were strong and had better control of their powers. She had Magenta use her powers to keep Girder from rusting and taught the Weather Wizard better control with his wand.\n\nSecond, she and her rogues had Flash's allies removed or incapacitated. Mirror Master framed Piper for the murder of his parents. Plunder took out Chunk, shot his mirror image, Detective Jared Morillo, and assumed his identity. Then, Mirror Master kidnapped Cyborg and police officer Fred Chyre, trapping them in a mirror universe along with all the other cops of Keystone City. The Rogues then removed the speedsters by giving Jesse Quick's company financial trouble and then sent Jay Garrick to a hospital in Denver when his wife got sick.\n\nFinally, Murmur and Mirror Master attacked radio stations and reprogrammed their antennas to broadcast a mirror shield around the twin cities to prevent anyone from coming in or getting out.\n\nAfter everything had been put into place, Blacksmith and her rogues launched their takeover and began by attacking the Flash. They attacked hard and fast, which left Flash tired and badly injured, but just as they were about to finish him off, they were stopped by the Thinker, who wanted to use the Flash's brain to upload information. After the Thinker was defeated, Blacksmith and the rogues resumed their plan and attacked Flash and Goldface. They successfully trounced Flash while Goldface escaped. During the fight, Blacksmith used her power to transform her body into ebony metal, while villains in the Network began to loot and pillage the two cities. Luckily, Goldface lead the people of the twin cities against the Network and Flash managed to defeat the Weather Wizard, Mirror Master, and Trickster II, before they escaped when Captain Cold froze the ground and Mirror Master used it to retreat. With her rogues defeated, she tried a desperate attack by collapsing the bridge that connects Keystone City and Central City. The Flash quickly managed to rebuild the bridge and finally defeat Blacksmith by stranding her on a barge in the middle of the river (she could not enter the water for fear of rusting her metal skin). With her Network discontinued, she was sent to Iron Heights, where she was severely wounded by the escaping Gorilla Grodd. Although she survived her injuries, Blacksmith has not been seen since that incident, although she did show up for \"Digger\" Harkness' funeral.\n\nBlacksmith's body has been mutated to be the perfect fusion between organic and inorganic. This has given her the ability to fuse organic and inorganic matter. Blacksmith has used the ability to fuse an inorganic object into an opponent causing serious damage. Blacksmith has also used the ability to cause serious damage to inorganic structures.\n\nKatee Sackhoff portrays Amunet Black aka Blacksmith in season four of \"The Flash\".\n\n"}

Trout began her aviation career at the age of 16; however, her first solo flight and solo certificate was only given on April 30, 1928. In the spring of 1928, Trout’s mother bought her an International K-6 biplane. Trout received her pilot's identification card from the United States Department of Commerce on September 1, 1928. She was the second woman to break the non-refueling endurance record for women when she flew 12 hours straight from California in 1929. The record was previously held by Viola Gentry and was the first record where Fédération Aéronautique Internationale (FAI) rules of the endurance record were revised stating that endurance records had to be broken by a full hour. Trout also participated in the Women's Air Derby of 1929, which was dubbed the Powder Puff Derby. In 2001, she was recognized as the only living participant in the first Women's Air Derby of 1929. Evelyn got her nickname “Bobbi” when she copied the hairstyle of 1928 actress Irene Castle which was a short “Bob” haircut.\n\nBobbi Trout was born on January 7, 1906 to Lola Trout and George Trout in Greenup, Illinois. One afternoon in 1918, Trout heard an aeroplane fly overhead. This incident started her interest in the field of aviation. Trout moved from Illinois to California with her family in 1920, when they purchased a service station. One day while tending the family business, Trout told her dreams to one of their patrons, W.E. Thomas, who coincidentally owned a Curtiss JN-4. Thomas asked Trout if she wanted a ride on the aircraft, which she did on December 27, 1922, taking off from Rogers Airport located in west Los Angeles. Trout saved approximately $2,500 which she used to enter Burdett Fuller’s flying school (the Burdett Airlines, Inc., School of Aviation) on January 1, 1928. In one of her flight lessons, she was instructed by a young pilot to three-quarter turn at a low elevation, which resulted in the biplane spinning out of control. The resulting crash wrecked the plane completely. This accident did not deter Trout from flying, and she completed her first solo flight on April 30, 1928 and received her solo certificate.\n\nAfter getting her license, Trout flew a Golden Eagle at the Metropolitan Airport in Los Angeles as an official dedication on December 14, 1928. Trout followed this up on January 2, 1929, flying from the same airport for 12 hours and 11 minutes, shattering the previous record, held by Viola Gentry, by more than 4 hours. This record was short lived, as aviator Elinor Smith broke the record once again on January 30, 1929. Smith flew 13 and a half hours straight from Mitchel Field using an open cockpit, Bruner Winkle biplane. Determined to take back the record, Trout flew from Mines Field on February 10, 1929, returning this time after more than 17 hours. This flight also broke the record for the first all-night flight by a woman as well as the new women's solo endurance record. In the same year on June 16, Trout flew a 90 horse power Golden Eagle Chief to an altitude of 15,200 feet breaking the light class aircraft altitude record. Modifying the same aircraft to use a 100 horse power engine, Trout flew from Clover Field in Santa Monica, California to the first Women's Transcontinental Air Derby together with other women aviators including Amelia Earhart. During the 8 day course, they experienced difficulties navigating through the road maps, Trout, Earhart, Gentry and the other ladies managed to communicate under such circumstances this led to the development of the Ninety-Nines: International Organization of Women Pilots.\n\nIn order to get more sponsorship, Trout asked starlet Edna Mae Cooper if she wanted to go with her to attempt another endurance run. They first attempted the flight on January 1, 1931 but due to technical problems they had to abort the flight. At their next attempt, they were successful in flying straight for 122 hours and 50 minutes, only to end the run on January 9, 1931 due to the spitting off fuel. This was another record broken by Trout, and was later recognized by King Carol II of Romania, who representative gave her the Royal Decree and the aviation cross for pilots who made record flights, a distinction only given to two other pilots - Amelia Earhart and Charles Lindbergh.\n\nTrout celebrated her 80th birthday while being interviewed inside a helicopter over the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco, California on January 7, 1986. On May of that same year she was honored during the Gathering of Eagles Program at Maxwell Air Force Base in Montgomery, Alabama. In 1999, she was also recognized as the only living participant from the first Women's Air Derby of 1929. Trout retired to San Diego, California and suffered a fatal heart attack on January 24, 2003. She never married and is survived by her sister-in-law Hazel Trout and her nephew Brook Trout.\n"}

It can be used for tasks like on-line handwriting recognition or recognizing phonemes in speech audio. CTC refers to the outputs and scoring, and is independent of the underlying neural network structure. It was introduced in 2006.\n\nThe input is a sequence of observations, and the outputs are a sequence of labels, which can include blank outputs. The difficulty of training comes from there being many more observations than there are labels. For example in speech audio there can be multiple time slices which correspond to a single phoneme. Since we don't know the alignment of the observed sequence with the target labels we predict a probability distribution at each time step. A CTC network has a continuous output (e.g. softmax), which is fitted through training to model the probability of a label. CTC does not attempt to learn boundaries and timings: Label sequences are considered equivalent if they differ only in alignment, ignoring blanks. Equivalent label sequences can occur in many ways – which makes scoring a non-trivial task, but there is an efficient forward–backward algorithm for that.\n\nCTC scores can then be used with the back-propagation algorithm to update the neural network weights.\n\nAlternative approaches to a CTC-fitted neural network include a hidden Markov model (HMM).\n"}
{"id": "26499237", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26499237", "title": "Cuckoo search", "text": "Cuckoo search\n\nIn operations research, cuckoo search is an optimization algorithm developed by Xin-she Yang and Suash Deb\nin 2009. It was inspired by the obligate brood parasitism of some cuckoo species by laying their eggs in the nests of other host birds (of other species). Some host birds can engage direct conflict with the intruding cuckoos. For example, if a host bird discovers the eggs are not their own, it will either throw these alien eggs away or simply abandon its nest and build a new nest elsewhere. Some cuckoo species such as the New World brood-parasitic Tapera have evolved in such a way that female parasitic cuckoos are often very specialized in the mimicry in colors and pattern of the eggs of a few chosen host species Cuckoo search idealized such breeding behavior, and thus can be applied for various optimization problems.\n\nCuckoo search (CS) uses the following representations:\n\nEach egg in a nest represents a solution, and a cuckoo egg represents a new solution. The aim is to use the new and potentially better solutions (cuckoos) to replace a not-so-good solution in the nests. In the simplest form, each nest has one egg. The algorithm can be extended to more complicated cases in which each nest has multiple eggs representing a set of solutions.\n\nCS is based on three idealized rules: \nIn addition, Yang and Deb discovered that the random-walk style search is better performed by Lévy flights rather than simple random walk.\n\nThe pseudo-code can be summarized as:\n\nAn important advantage of this algorithm is its simplicity. In fact, comparing with other population- or agent-based metaheuristic algorithms such as particle swarm optimization and harmony search, there is essentially only a single parameter formula_7 in CS (apart from the population size formula_9). Therefore, it is very easy to implement.\n\nAn important issue is the applications of Lévy flights and random walks in the generic equation for generating new solutions\n\nwhere formula_11 is drawn from a standard normal distribution with zero mean and unity standard deviation for random walks, or drawn from Lévy distribution for Lévy flights. Obviously, the random walks can also be linked with the similarity between a cuckoo's egg and the host's egg which can be tricky in implementation. Here the step size formula_12 determines how far a random walker can go for a fixed number of iterations. The generation of Lévy step size is often tricky, and a comparison of three algorithms (including Mantegna's) was performed by Leccardi who found an implementation of Chambers et al.'s approach to be the most computationally efficient due to the low number of random numbers required.\n\nIf s is too large, then the new solution generated will be too far away from the old solution (or even jump outside of the bounds). Then, such a move is unlikely to be accepted. If s is too small, the change is too small to be significant, and consequently such search is not efficient. So a proper step size is important to maintain the search as efficient as possible.\n\nAs an example, for simple isotropic random walks, we know that the average distance formula_13 traveled in the d-dimension space is\nwhere formula_15 is the effective diffusion coefficient. Here formula_16 is the step size or distance traveled at each jump, and formula_17 is the time taken for each jump. The above equation implies that\nFor a typical length scale L of a dimension of interest, the local search is typically limited in a region of formula_19. For formula_20 and t=100 to 1000, we have formula_21 for d=1, and formula_22 for d=10. Therefore, we can use s/L=0.001 to 0.01 for most problems. Though the exact derivation may require detailed analysis of the behaviour of Lévy flights.\n\nAlgorithm and convergence analysis will be fruitful, because there are many open problems related to metaheuristics\n\nConvergence of Cuckoo Search algorithm can be substantially improved by generically replacing abandoned nests (instead of using the random replacements from the original method).\n"}

It has a variety of enzymes of phases I (modification enzymes acting to introduce reactive and polar groups into their substrates) and II (conjugation enzymes) of the xenobiotic metabolism, as do mammals. \nCytochrome P450 monooxygenase, aryl sulfotransferase, glutathione S-transferase, UDP-glucuronosyltransferase, UDP-glucosyltransferase activities have been detected in cytosolic or microsomal fractions.\n\nCytochrome P-450 and cytochrome P-450 reductase in \"C. elegans\" are part of the phase I enzymes. They are induced by the corticosteroid cortexolone and by phenanthrene. \"C. elegans\" also possesses a lanosterol 14-alpha demethylase, another enzyme in the cytochrome P450 family.\n\n\"C. elegans\" also possesses a glutathione S-transferase.\n\n\"Cunninghamella elegans\" is a microbial model of mammalian drug metabolism. The use of this fungus could reduce the over-all need for laboratory animals.\n\n\"C. elegans\" is able to transform the tricyclic antidepressants amitriptyline and doxepin, the tetracyclic antidepressant mirtazapine, the muscle relaxant cyclobenzaprine, the typical antipsychotic chlorpromazine as well as the antihistamine and anticholinergic methdilazine and azatadine. It is also able to transform the antihistamines brompheniramine, chlorpheniramine and pheniramine.\n\nIt forms a glucoside with the diuretic furosemide.\n\nThe transformation of oral contraceptive mestranol by \"C. elegans\" yields two hydroxylated metabolites, 6beta-hydroxymestranol and 6beta,12beta-dihydroxymestranol.\n\nThe phase I cytochrome P450 enzyme systems of \"C. elegans\" has been implicated in the neutralization of numerous polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH).\n\nIt can degrade molecules such as anthracene, 7-methylbenz[a]anthracene and 7-hydroxymethylbenz[a]anthracene, phenanthrene, acenaphthene, 1- and 2-methylnaphthalene, naphthalene, fluorene or benzo(a)pyrene.\n\nIn the case of phenanthrene, \"C. elegans\" produces a glucoside conjugate of 1-hydroxyphenanthrene (phenanthrene 1-O-beta-glucose).\n\n\"C. elegans\" is also able to degrade the herbicides alachlor, metolachlor and isoproturon as well as the fungicide mepanipyrim.\n\n\"Cunninghamella elegans\" can be used to study the metabolism of phenols. This type of molecules already have reactive and polar groups comprised within their structure therefore phases I enzymes are less active than phase II (conjugation) enzymes.\n\nIn flavonols, an hydroxyl group is available in the 3- position allowing the glycosylation at that position. The biotransformation of quercetin yields three metabolites, including quercetin 3-O-β-D-glucopyranoside, kaempferol 3-O-β-D-glucopyranoside and isorhamnetin 3-O-β-D-glucopyranoside. Glucosylation and O-methylation are involved in the process. \nIn flavones, there is no hydroxyl group available at the 3- position. Conjugation, in the form of sulfation occurs at the 7- or 4'- positions. Apigenin and chrysin are also transformed by \"C. elegans\" and produce apigenin 7-sulfate, apigenin 7,4′-disulfate, chrysin 7-sulfate. \n<br>Sulfation also occurs on naringenin and produces naringenin-7-sulfate.\n\nGlucosylation may nevertheless occur but in 3'- position, as happens during the microbial transformation of psiadiarabin and its 6-desmethoxy analogue, 5,3′ dihydroxy-7,2′,4′,5′-tetramethoxyflavone, by \"Cunninghamella elegans\" NRRL 1392 that gives the 3′-glucoside conjugates of the two flavones.\n\nAs in flavones, there is no hydroxyl groups available at the 3- position for glycosylation in flavanones. Therefore, sulfation occurs at the 7- position. In compounds like 7-methoxylated flavanones like 7-O-methylnaringenin (sakuranetin), demethylation followed by sulfation occur.\n\nIt is also able to degrade synthetic phenolic compounds like bisphenol A.\n\n\"C. elegans\" can transform the nitrogen containing compound phthalazine It is also able to oxidize the organosulfur compound dibenzothiophene.\n\nMethods for efficient \"C. elegans\" genomic DNA isolation and transformation have been developed.\n\nThe cytochrome P450 of \"C. elegans\" has been cloned in \"Escherichia coli\" as well as an enolase.\n\n\"Cunninghamella elegans\" can be grown in stirred tank batch bioreactor. Protoplasts cultures have been used.\n\n\"C. elegans\" can be used for phenanthrene bioconversion or for steroid transformation.

Many chemotherapy drugs for cancer lack tumour specificity and the doses required to reach therapeutic levels in the tumour are often toxic to other tissues. DEPT strategies are an experimental method of reducing the systemic toxicity of a drug, by achieving high levels of the active drug only at the desired site. This article describes the variations of DEPT technology.\n\nADEPT is a strategy to overcome the problems of lack of tumor selectivity. An antibody designed/developed against a tumor antigen is linked to an enzyme and injected to the blood, resulting in selective binding of the enzyme in the tumor. When the discrimination between tumor and normal tissue enzyme levels is sufficient, a prodrug is administrated into the blood circulation, which is converted to an active cytotoxic drug by the enzyme, only within the tumor. Selectivity is achieved by the tumor specificity of the antibody and by delaying prodrug administration until there is a large differential between tumor and normal tissue enzyme levels.\n\nADEPT has shown antitumor activity in animal tumor models of human choriocarcinoma and colonic and breast carcinoma.\n\nThe first pilot-scale clinical trial of ADEPT was carried out at Charing Cross Hospital, London, using an anti-CEA F(ab′)2 antibody conjugated to the bacterial enzyme carboxypeptidase G2 (CPG2).\n\nThe antibody used in the first ADEPT clinical trial was of murine origin and the enzyme was bacterial. Host antibodies to both components of the AEC were present in the blood of all non-immunosuppressed patients by day 10 after AEC infusion. Several patients received ciclosporin since it had been shown in rabbits that this could delay the appearance of host antibodies to soluble proteins.\n\nA subsequent, small-scale trial at the Royal Free Hospital, London, used the same agents as in the Charing Cross Hospital trial but the protocol was modified to provide additional pharmacokinetic data and most patients received only a single course of treatment.\n\nGDEPT is a suicide gene therapy in which the enzyme required for prodrug conversion is produced within the target cell, using a gene delivered to it by gene therapy. When an adequate differential exists between the targeted cell and endogenous tissue, non-toxic prodrug is administered and is subsequently converted into its toxic form within the target cell. Systems that use viral vectors to deliver the gene are known as VDEPT.\n\nVDEPT is the term given to the use of a virus to deliver the gene for GDEPT. VDEPT can potentially be used to enhance the therapeutic potential of oncolytic viruses.\n\nLEAPT is a variant of DEPT in which the manipulation of carbohydrates on the surface of the enzyme is used to target the enzyme activity to the cell in question. This allows exploitation of the sometimes highly specific sugar-lectin interactions found in organisms, including humans. Proof-of-principle examples have shown delivery to target organs of enzymes that specifically release cytotoxics to treat tumours.\n\nPDEPT uses polymer-drug conjugates, drugs contained within a polymer 'shell' such as pHPMA and designed to be released only by a specific enzyme.\n\nCDEPT is the use of Clostridia to convert prodrugs into active drug agents. CDEPT exploits the hypoxic environment of solid tumors to target drugs to tumors using anaerobic bacteria resident in the tumour to convert the pro-drug to the active form. Intravenously injected clostridial spores exhibit a specificity for tumours, colonising the hypoxic areas of the tumours.\n\nPerhaps the most challenging issue in cancer treatment is how to reduce the side effects of the injected anti-cancer agents, which are of a high cytotoxicity potential. A widely used solution is to use enzymes which are able to convert a relatively non-toxic prodrug precursor into the active drug form(s). Clostridial-directed enzyme prodrug therapy (CDEPT) is one of the possible approaches.\n\nSolid tumors, in contrast to normal tissues, grow rapidly. As a result, the cancerous tissues may suffer from inadequate blood and oxygen supply. Therefore, clostridia can grow in tumor and destroy it specifically. (Originally, Parker and co-workers showed that the injection of \"Clostridium histolyticum\" spores to the transplanted sarcomas of mice results in significant tumour lysis. Soon after, it was shown that a direct injection is not necessary, and that tumour colonization was readily obtained after intravenous administration of spores).\n\nIn CDEPT, a prodrug-converting enzyme expressed by a clostridial expression plasmid converts a prodrug into an active drug form within the tumor. While the prodrug is the inactive form and can be administrated to the blood, the products of the prodrug cleavage are highly cytotoxic and show their effect only in the vicinity of tumor cells.\n\nDifficulties in the engineering of clostridial strains have restricted the application of other enzyme prodrug systems. So far, two enzymes have been applied in CDEPT: cytosine deaminase and nitroreductase. It has been recently suggested that β-lactamases, which are naturally found in Clostridia, can facilitate the application of the method significantly.\n"}

It was written by Eric Heisserer and stars Nicholas D'Agosto, Emma Bell, Miles Fisher, Arlen Escarpeta, David Koechner and Tony Todd.\n\nDespite the previous film being originally announced as the final of the franchise, due to its financial success, development of \"Final Destination 5\" began in 2010. Filming took place in Vancouver, as with the first three installments. It was theatrically released in August 12, 2011, and on DVD on December 27, 2011, which includes deleted scenes, documentaries and a parody music video by the cast.\n\nThe film received mostly positive reviews; the first film in the franchise to do so. Critics praised the plot, CGI, death scenes and tone, especially in comparison to the previous installment. The film was a financial success and is the second-highest-grossing film in the franchise.\n\nIn April 2000, Sam Lawton is on his way to a company retreat with his colleagues. While their bus crosses the North Bay Bridge, Sam has a premonition that the bridge will collapse, killing everyone except his ex-girlfriend Molly Harper, whom he manages to get across the bridge safely. In a panic, he persuades several people to leave the bridge before it collapses, including Molly, his friends Nathan Sears and Peter Friedkin, Peter's girlfriend Candice Hooper, his boss Dennis Lapman, and his co-workers Olivia Castle and Isaac Palmer. FBI agent Jim Block doesn't believe that Sam is responsible for the bridge collapse, but promises to keep an eye on him. At the memorial service, coroner William Bludworth mysteriously tells the survivors that \"Death doesn't like to be cheated\" and warns them to be careful. However, they ignore his warning and leave, believing this to be nonsense.\n\nLater, Candice goes to the gym to practice with Peter, but a chain reaction causes her to fly off the uneven bars, and she snaps her spine, leaving Peter devastated. The next day, Isaac is killed at a Chinese spa when his head is crushed by a falling Buddha statue during an acupuncture session. Bludworth, who has been present for both deaths, tells the remaining survivors that if they wish to cheat Death, they must kill someone who was never meant to die on the bridge and thereby claim their remaining lifespan. On the same day, Olivia goes to an eye surgery clinic to treat her myopic vision. While the doctor is away looking for files, the laser malfunctions, searing her eye and hand. She manages to free herself just as Sam and Molly arrive to save her, but trips and falls out of the window onto a car below. Later, Sam learns that the survivors are dying in the order they were meant to die on the bridge, and realize that Nathan is next.\n\nMeanwhile, Nathan, who has returned to the factory, accidentally kills his co-worker, Roy Carson, during an argument by pushing him in front of a lifting hook, which impales him through the chin. As Nathan informs the remaining survivors about this, they realize he claimed Roy's remaining lifespan by killing him, and therefore must be safe. When Dennis arrives to question Nathan about the incident, a wrench launched by a belt sander hits him in the face, killing him.\n\nThat evening, after working at a restaurant, Sam asks his supervisor to reserve the restaurant for a date with Molly. Peter, who has become unstable after Candice's death, interrupts the date and tells them that he will kill Molly to take her lifespan. After Peter draws a gun, Sam and Molly both escape to the kitchen. Agent Block overhears the gunshots from outside. When he enters the restaurant, he is shot dead by Peter. Believing that he is safe from Death, Peter decides to kill both Molly and Sam to remove any witnesses. The two men fight and Peter knocks Sam unconscious. Just as Peter is about to stab Molly with a kitchen knife, Sam awakens and stabs him in the back with a large skewer, leading Sam to believe he has claimed Block's life.\n\nTwo weeks later, Sam and Molly board a plane to Paris. As they take their seats, a fight breaks out between two passengers, Alex Browning and Carter Horton, revealing the plane he and Molly are on is Flight 180. Upon take-off, Sam overhears that Alex had a vision of the plane's destruction, but it's too late, and both he and Molly are killed when the plane explodes. At Roy's memorial, Nathan learns that Roy had a brain aneurysm that would have burst \"any day now\". As Nathan realizes he may still be in danger, the landing gear from Flight 180 breaks through the roof and crushes him.\n\nAlan Horn, the head of Warner Bros., confirmed at ShoWest in March 2010 that \"Final Destination 5\" was in works at ShoWest. Producer Craig Perry later added that the film would be shot in 3D. Eric Heisserer was announced as screenwriter in April 2010. The studio initially picked August 26, 2011, as the release date but later changed it to August 12, 2011. In June 2010, New Line Cinema announced that Steven Quale would direct.\n\nAccording to Heisserer, \"Final Destination 5\" was always meant to be a prequel, set before the first film; the idea having come from franchise producer Craig Perry. Heisserer said that one major problem he encountered while writing the film was coming up with good death sequences, believing that managing to do so in the world of \"Final Destination\" is \"ridiculously hard\". The inspiration for Olivia's death sequence involving LASIK eye surgery after his wife underwent the same type of surgery.\n\nIn August 2010, actor and musician Miles Fisher was the first to be cast in the film as Peter Friedkin. Fisher had appeared in numerous short films and in a small role in the comedy film \"Superhero Movie\" (2008). Fisher said during an interview that \"I've done a little bit of television and a little bit of film, but 3-D is almost an entirely different sport.\" Three days after Fisher's casting, Arlen Escarpeta was cast in the film as Nathan. Escarpeta explained that \"I think what they're going to do really, really well this time around, they're going to go back—the story, the plot, a lot of stuff is really going to matter, I think the last movie it was just death. It was death, death, death, which is fine because that's what people want to see. But this time we're going to give them a little bit of everything – good story, great director—it's going to be good.\" He appeared in the films \"American Gun\" (2005) and \"Friday the 13th\" (2009). In late August 2010 Nicholas D'Agosto and Ellen Wroe were cast. One day later, Tony Todd, who portrayed William Bludworth from the first two installments joined the film.\n\nOn August 30, 2010, David Koechner and P. J. Byrne were announced to have joined the cast. On September 2, Emma Bell was cast as the female lead; Molly. In mid-September both Jacqueline MacInnes Wood and Courtney B. Vance joined the main cast.\n\nLocation filming returned to Vancouver, where parts of the first three films were shot. Principal photography took place between September 13 and December 14, 2010. Producers stated that this installment would be darker and more suspenseful in the style of the original film. \"Final Destination 3\" star Chelan Simmons revealed that the opening scene would be filmed on the Lions Gate Bridge in Vancouver.\n\nThe soundtrack to \"Final Destination 5\" was released physically on August 16, 2011, four days after the release of the film. The soundtrack contains 19 tracks composed by Brian Tyler, music composer of \"The Final Destination\". It is also the second \"Final Destination\" soundtrack album to be released. Miles Fisher also released a tie-in video for his single \"New Romance\" which features the key actors in the film in a \"Saved by the Bell\" parody in which most are killed in freak accidents, in keeping with the series.\n\nCommercial songs from the film, but not on the soundtrack\n\nThe album contains 19 cues composed by Brian Tyler, omitting commercially released songs that were featured in the film.\n\n\nThe Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) in the UK ruled that the original theatrical poster, which had been used on buses and trains during the summer, \"was likely to cause fear and undue distress to children\". It ruled that the advert must not appear in the original form again.\n\nWarner Bros. countered by stating that the poster \"accurately reflected the content of the film in an appropriate manner without causing excessive fear or distress\". They also added that the poster's dark grey and black colors were \"unlikely to engage the attention of young children\", and that the \"surreal\" image did not feature people, blood or display any real-life violence.\n\nThe ASA, which had received 13 complaints, with three stating that their children (aged between 1 and 3) had been upset, ruled \"We considered the image was likely to catch the attention of children, especially because it was shown on a poster on the Underground, where it was an untargeted medium. Because very young children might view this ad depicting violence, it was likely to cause fear and undue distress to children.\"\n\n\"Final Destination 5\" ranked #3 at the weekend box office with $18.4 million behind \"Rise of the Planet of the Apes\" ($27.5 million), which held the top spot for two weeks, and \"The Help\" ($25.5 million). It was also the third biggest \"Final Destination\" opening to date behind 2009's \"The Final Destination\" ($27.4 million) and 2006's \"Final Destination 3\" ($19.1 million). \"Final Destination 5\" grossed $42,587,643 domestically, and $115,300,000 internationally, for a worldwide total of $157,887,643, becoming the second-highest-grossing film in the franchise.\n\n\"Final Destination 5\" was released on DVD and Blu-ray Disc on December 27, 2011. The Blu-ray Disc comes in two forms: the movie-only edition and the Blu-ray Disc/DVD/UltraViolet edition. A Blu-ray 3D edition was released exclusively through Best Buy. The film was released in the UK on December 26, 2011; however, only the special-edition Blu-ray Disc contained the 3D cut of the film. An UltraViolet copy was available in all formats.\n\nBefore the film appeared in theaters, Fisher released a music video. Starring the main cast of \"Final Destination 5\" and featuring Fisher's original song \"New Romance\", the video parodied the 1990s sitcom \"Saved by the Bell\" and included a clue to the plot of the film. Fisher, a fan of the show, and video director Dave Green watched every episode, and contemporary shows like \"Boy Meets World\" and \"Clarissa Explains It All\". \"We thought, 'Gosh wouldn't it be fun and subversive to have Final Destination-type deaths in this safe, [sitcom] world?'\" Fisher, who plays a Zack Morris-like character, said. He joked, \"I basically have always been looking for a way to dance with Kelly Kapowski my whole life\".\n\nOn review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 62% based on 132 reviews, with an average rating of 5.8/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \"It's still only for the gore-thirsty faithful, but \"Final Destination 5\" represents a surprising return to form for the franchise.\" On Metacritic, which assigns a weighted score, gives the film a score of 50 out of 100, based on 24 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\". It is the highest-rated film of the franchise on both sites. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"B+\" on an A+ to F scale.\n\nRichard Roeper stated in his review \"From the opening credits to the final kill this film displays a great use of 3-D.\" Todd Gilchrist of Boxoffice Magazine has declared the film in his review for being \"the best 3D horror movie ever made.\" He described \"Final Destination 5\" as \"a clean, glossy thriller shot in native 3D (not post-conversion) that maximizes the technology without straining the audience's credulity or their constitutions.\" He also stated \"Calling anything the 'best 3D horror film' has the ring of crowning the world's tallest midget, but Quale uses 3D almost shockingly well.\" In a review for Toronto.com, Linda Barnard has stated \"this could be a case where the 3-D-shot movie is worth the extra few bucks to see\".\n\nThe visual effects were praised for improving on the weak CGI from the previous installment. Betty Jo Tucker of ReelTalk Movie Reviews said in her review \"The film boasts some of the best visual effects ever, especially the bridge-crumbling sequence at the beginning of the film.\" In his review of \"Final Destination 5\", Roger Ebert said \"... the special effects do an excellent job of beheading, incinerating, vivisecting, squishing and so on.\" \"\"Final Destination 5\" contain some of the most fun effects ever seen that purely enhance the thrills and bloody spills, rather than detract from them,\" stated Lisa Giles-Keddie from uk.real.com.\n\nThe death scenes in the film have been praised as being suspenseful, creative, and shocking. Boxoffice Magazine said in praise, \"viewers connect to both the relatable pain of everyday injury and the gory gratification of a well-constructed, larger-than-life set piece.\" NJ.com opined, \"Admitted, there is a certain inventiveness to the way director Steven Quale stages the violence.\" \"San Francisco Chronicle\" said that the characters are \"killed in gruesome and spectacular ways\". The gymnastic set piece has been praised as \"anxiety-filled\", \"a beautiful example of successful comic suspense\", \"Hitchcockian edge-of-your-seat suspense\", and \"inventively grotesque\". Film.com stated in their review \"The subsequent deaths are hit-or-miss, but they all show some creative spark. Quale sets them up like a cross between a joke and a magic trick, carefully establishing crucial details.\"\n\nThe opening bridge collapse has garnered considerable critical acclaim, with many stating it as being on par with the pile-up sequence from \"Final Destination 2\". It has been said to be \"one of the single best sequences of any film all year\" by Boxoffice Magazine. Uk.real.com stated that the opening bridge collapse sequence is \"beautifully directed and choreographed\". Eric D. Snider has stated in his review for Film.com that \"The opening premonition is nerve-janglingly effective.\" \"New York Post\" called the bridge collapse sequence \"spectacular\", and \"Daily News\" deemed it \"terrifying\". \"USA Today\" commented on the sequence, saying \"The effect is terrific and reminiscent of the bridge destruction from \"\".\" Betsy Sharkey, a \"Los Angeles Times\" film critic stated in her negative review \"I will say, the bus, and the bridge it must cross, does make for a pretty incredible wham-bam opening sequence,\" and further added \"The big crumble is a stunner of an opener.\" In a review for MSN.com, Kat Murphy said \"the fifth chapter starts out with a slambang catastrophe\", then stated that the bridge collapse is \"skillfully orchestrated\", and \"this sequence is actually enhanced by 3-D: Holes in the disintegrating bridge seem to pull the gaze down—dizzyingly—to the river below, and jagged camera angles on hanging railings and sliding debris muddle our sense of what's up, what's down.\" Kirk Honeycutt of \"The Hollywood Reporter\" praised \"This film's opening sequence is undeniably spectacular.\" Aaron Hillis from \"The Village Voice\" called the bridge collapse \"breathtakingly staged\". \"The Advocate\" stated that \"Director Steve Quale and writer Heisserer stage the bridge's collapse in swift but exacting detail.\" \"The Austin Chronicle\" said the bridge collapse sequence is \"spectacularly gruesome\".\n\n"}
{"id": "3052344", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3052344", "title": "Futures techniques", "text": "Futures techniques\n\nFutures techniques used in the multi-disciplinary field of futures studies by futurists in Americas and Australasia, and futurology by futurologists in EU, include a diverse range of forecasting methods, including anticipatory thinking, backcasting, simulation, and visioning. Some of the anticipatory methods include, the delphi method, causal layered analysis, environmental scanning, morphological analysis, and scenario planning.\n\nThe Delphi method is a very popular technique used in Futures Studies. It was developed by Gordon and Helmer in 1953 at RAND. It can be defined as a method for structuring a group communication process, so that the process is effective in allowing a group of individuals, as a whole, to deal with a complex problem.\n\nIt uses the iterative, independent questioning of a panel of experts to assess the timing, probability, significance and implications of factors, trends and events in the relation to the problem being considered. Panelists are not brought together but individually questioned in rounds. After the initial round, the panelists are given lists of anonymous answers from other panelists which they can use to refine their own views.\n\nStudies employing Delphi method tend to be difficult to perform. The application of the Delphi method requires a great deal of attention to the selection of participating experts and the questionnaires have to be scrupulously prepared and tested in advance. The initial preparation and follow-up rounds of questioning of the panelists tends to be time consuming.\n\nDelphi's primary strength is its ability to explore, tranquilly and objectively, issues that require judgement. Unlike panel sessions, the iterative Delphi method allows the forecasting and assessment to be done without the effect of strong personalities or reputations influencing other panelists and also overcomes the difficulty of getting all experts together in a single time and place.\n\nThis method, developed by Sohail Inayatullah, is one of the newest developments in Futures Studies. Causal layered analysis focuses on \"opening up\" the present and past to create alternative futures rather than on developing a picture of a particular future.\n\nIt is concerned with the vertical dimension of futures studies, with the layers of analysis. CLA is based on the assumption that the way in which a problem is formulated changes the policy solutions and the actors in charge of initiating transformations.\n\nThe key principle of the method is using and integrating different ways of knowing.\n\nThere are a number of benefits arising from the application of this method. Causal layered analysis increases the range and richness of scenarios; leads to inclusion of different ways of knowing among participants in workshops; appeals to wider range of individuals through incorporation of non-textual and artistic elements; extends the discussion beyond the obvious to the deeper and marginal; and leads to the policy actions that can be educated by alternative layers of analysis.\n\nEnvironmental scanning is usually used at the start of a futures project. It aims at broad exploration of all major trends, issues, advancements, events and ideas across a wide range of activities. Information is collected from many different sources, such as newspapers, magazines, Internet, television, conferences, reports, and also science-fiction books. Various tools and methodologies are used by large corporations to systematically scope their external environment. An example is the widely used FUTURE structure developed by Futurist Patrick Dixon described in his book \"Futurewise\" - F ast, U rban, T ribal, U niversal, R adical, E thical. Attention needs to be given to potential Wild Cards - low probability (or uncertain probability) but potentially high impact events.\n\nScanning is used to build up a comprehensive picture of factors that could impact strategy.\n\nFour types of indicators can be examined in the process of environmental scanning:\n\n\nMorphological analysis is a technique developed by Fritz Zwicky (1966, 1969) for exploring all the possible solutions to a multi-dimensional, non-quantified problem complex.\n\nAs a problem structuring and problem solving technique, morphological analysis was designed for multi-dimensional, non-quantifiable problems where causal modeling and simulation do not function well or at all. Zwicky developed this approach to address seemingly non-reducible complexity. Using the technique of cross consistency assessment (CCA), the system however does allow for reduction, not by reducing the number of variables involved, but by reducing the number of possible solutions through the elimination of the illogical solution combinations in a grid box.\n\nMA has also been employed for the identification of new product opportunities. The technique involves mapping options in order to attain an overall perspective of possible solutions. It comprises the two main activities: a systematic analysis of a current and future structure of the area including the gaps in that structure, stimulation for creation of new alternative, which could fill the gaps and meet any needs.\n\nScenarios are one of the most popular and persuasive methods used in the Futures Studies. Government planners, corporate strategists and military analysts use them in order to aid decision-making. The term scenario was introduced into planning and decision-making by Herman Kahn in connection with military and strategic studies done by RAND in the 1950s.\n\nIt can be defined as a rich and detailed portrait of a plausible future world, one sufficiently vivid that a planner can clearly see and comprehend the problems, challenges and opportunities that such an environment would present.\n\nA scenario is not a specific forecast of the future, but a plausible description of what might happen. Scenarios are like stories built around carefully constructed plots based on trends and events. They assist in selection of strategies, identification of possible futures, making people aware of uncertainties and opening up their imagination and initiating learning processes.\n\nOne of the key strengths of the scenario process is its influence on the way of thinking of its participants. A mindset, in which the focus is placed on one possible future, is altered towards the balanced thinking about a number of possible alternative futures.\n\nA future history is a postulated history of the future. Some authors for example science fiction writers construct as a common background for fiction. The author may include a timeline of events for this history. A related field is alternate history, which assumes that the event or events at a point in past history turned out differently (POD=point of departure) and then draws a fictional future timeline from that event.\n\nIt is a process that aims at evaluation of events, as they occur or just after. It involves activities like scanning, detecting, projecting, assessing, responding and tracking. Monitoring is one of the fundamental activities performed by Futures Studies.\n\nThis technique is used for the systematic and objective study of the particular aspects of various ‘messages’. Such ‘messages’ can be found in books, journals, newspapers, private letters, publications of political parties, reports, surveys, interviews, television, Internet and so on. This method, in order to be reliable and valid, needs to be performed with high competency.\n\nIt is a technique that often is pointed out as an opposite to forecasting. It involves identification of a particular scenario and tracing its origins and lines of development back to the present.\n\nIt builds upon the assumption that any future oriented group process has to manage peoples’ difficulties in thinking into the future. These difficulties can arise from the fears as well as from the lack of experience in futures thinking.\n\nBack-view mirror analysis allows dealing with the fears related to the future by creating a new perspective that looks to the past instead of starting the process in the present. The method is used to perform qualitative analysis of the past using both quantitative and qualitative data.\n\nThe method was developed by Theodore Gordon and Olaf Helmer in 1966 in an attempt to answer a question whether perceptions of how future events may interact with each other can be used in forecasting.\n\nAs it is well known, most events and trends are interdependent in some ways. Cross-impact analysis provides an analytical approach to the probabilities of an element in a forecast set, and it helps to assess probabilities in view of judgements about potential interactions between those elements.\n\nThe technique can be used by individuals and groups at an elementary qualitative level as well as it can be employed to perform more complicated and intensive quantitative analysis. One of its strengths is that it forces the attention towards \"chains of causality: x affects y; y affects z\". On the other side it can be very fatiguing and monotonous.\n\nFuture workshops were developed by Robert Jungk in order to allow anybody to become involved in creating their preferred future rather than being subjected to decisions made by experts. Future workshops are very strongly action oriented. They aim, first to imagine the desired future, and then to plan it and implement it.\n\nFuture workshops have four distinctive phases:\n\n\nA similar method is found in Future Search.\n\nFailure mode and effects analysis (FMEA) is a safety analysis method first developed for systems engineering which examines potential failures in products or processes. It may be used to evaluate risk management priorities for mitigating known threat-vulnerabilities.\n\nFMEA helps select remedial actions that reduce cumulative impacts of life cycle consequences (risks) from a systems failure (fault).\n\nMeasured Action is an action that improves Production Capability by a measured amount, (e.g. if X hours of overtime then Y additional files transmitted). Measured actions enhance FMEA by perfectly matching calculated risks with calculated contingencies to ensure a specific outcome.\n\nThis method, also called futures imagining, aims to create individual imaginaries, to gather peoples’ views on the future and to examine them in the study of collective future. Peoples’ expectations and opinions are considered as an important indication of possible goals and to possible directions that can influence peoples’ actions and in result steer the future.\n\nThe method is a form of structured brainstorming that aims at identifying and packaging secondary and tertiary consequences of trends and events. A trend or event is placed in the middle of a piece of paper and then small spokes are drawn wheel-like from the centre. Primary impacts and consequences are written in circles of the first ring.\n\nThen secondary consequences of each primary impact are derived forming the second ring. This ripple effect continues until there is a clear picture of implications that the event or trend can have. Futures wheel is a very simple but powerful technique for drawing out people's opinions and ideas. However, it is sensitive to underlying assumptions.\n\nIt is an analytical technique that subdivides a large subject into increasingly smaller subtopics. The relevance tree has a form of a hierarchical structure that begins with a high level of abstraction and moves down with greater degree of detail in the following levels of the tree. It is a powerful technique that helps to ensure that a given problem or issue is broken into comprehensive detail and that important connections among the elements considered are presented in both current and potential situations.\n\nSimulation and modelling are computer-based tools developed to represent reality. They are widely used to analyse behaviours and to understand processes. Models allow demonstration of past changes as well as the examination of various transformations and their impact on each other and other considered factors.\n\nThey can help to understand the connections between factors and events and to examine their dynamics. Simulation is a process that represents a structure and change of a system. In simulation some aspects of reality are duplicated or reproduced, usually within the model. \nThe main purpose of simulation is to discern what would really happen in the real world if certain conditions, imitated by the model, developed.\n\nAlthough modelling and simulation became even more popular with the development of computing technology, application of these techniques have certain limits. Models represent a simplification of a system that is being examined; therefore the results need to be carefully considered.\n\nAs the complexity of real systems increases models need to be more and more complex to represent the reality most accurately. In result, they may become increasingly difficult to understand and to be operated. Their complex nature can cause problems with using and managing results.\n\nAs models constitute a simpler version of reality, certain factors can be omitted, and in consequence can lead to mistakes. Such mistakes are not easy to be found and corrected.\n\nSocial network analysis (also sometimes called \"network theory\") has emerged as a key technique in modern sociology, anthropology, Social Psychology and organizational studies, as well as a popular topic of speculation and study.\n\nResearch in a number of academic fields have demonstrated that social networks operate on many levels, from families up to the level of nations, and play a critical role in determining the way problems are solved, organizations are run, and the degree to which individuals succeed in achieving their goals.\n\nAn interdisciplinary approach to engineering systems that is inherently complex, since the behavior of and interaction among system components is not always well defined.\n\nDefining and characterizing such systems and subsystems, and the interactions among them, is the primary aim of systems engineering. On \"very\" large programs, a systems architect may be designated to serve as an interface between the user/sponsor and systems engineer.\n\nRADM Grace Hopper, USNR was quoted as saying \"Life was simple before World War II. After that, we had systems.\"\n\nVisioning is a popular method in the studies of desirable futures and the one that gives emphasis to values. It is extensively used in urban planning. The visioning process is based on the assumption that images of the future lead peoples’ present behaviours, guide choices and influence decisions. Images of the future can be positive or negative and cause different responses according to the perceptions.\n\nVision is usually seen as a positive, desirable image of the future and can be defined as a compelling, inspiring statement of the preferred future that the authors and those who subscribe to the vision want to create.\n\nThere are a number of issues that need to be addressed while using the visioning method. Vision comprises peoples’ values, wishes, fears and desires. In order to make the visioning process work it is necessary to ensure that it is not making an idealistic wish-list; that vision is an image of the future shared by a whole community; and that the vision is translatable into reality.\n\nTrend analysis is one of the most often used methods in forecasting. It aims to observe and register the past performance of a certain factor and project it into the future. It involves analysis of two groups of trends: quantitative, mainly based on statistical data, and qualitative, these are at large concerned with social, institutional, organisational and political patterns.\n\nIn the quantitative trend analysis data is plotted along a time axis, so that a simple curve can be established. Short term forecasting seems quite simple; it becomes more complex when the trend is extrapolated further into the future, as the number of dynamic forces that can change direction of the trend increases. This form of simple trend extrapolation helps to direct attention towards the forces, which can change the projected pattern.\n\nA more elaborated curve that uses times series analysis can often reveal surprising historical and current data patterns. The qualitative trend analysis is one of the most demanding and creative methods in Futures Studies.\n\nAs trends never speak for themselves, the identification and description of patterns is partly empirical and partly creative activity. The most challenging part of qualitative trends analysis is identification of a tendency early, as recognition of a mature trend is \"relatively useless\" in influencing anyone's behaviour.\n\nAlthough similar to decision theory, game theory studies decisions that are made in an environment where various players interact. In other words, game theory studies choice of optimal behavior when costs and benefits of each option are not fixed, but depend upon the choices of other individuals.\n\nALL-WinWin collaborative efforts require group decision support systems (GDSS) that enable the knowledge management community of practice to assure sustainable mutually-beneficial results.\n"}
{"id": "7841783", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7841783", "title": "Galla (wife of Theodosius I)", "text": "Galla (wife of Theodosius I)\n\nFlavia Galla (died 394) was an empress of the Roman Empire and a princess of the Western Roman Empire. She was the second empress consort of Theodosius I. She was the daughter of Valentinian I and his second wife Justina.\n\nLittle is known of Galla, including her full name. \"Galla\" is the female cognomen for \"Gallus\" and, in Latin, \"gallus\" could mean both an inhabitant of Gaul and a rooster.\n\nGalla is listed as one of four children of the marriage by Jordanes. Her paternal uncle Valens was Emperor of the Eastern Roman Byzantine Empire from 364 to his death in the Battle of Adrianople (9 August 378). Her father was emperor of the Western Roman Empire from 364 to his death on 17 November 375 and was previously married to Marina Severa. The only known child of that marriage was Gratian, Western Roman Emperor from 375 to his assassination on 25 August 383. Her mother was previously married to Magnentius, a Roman usurper from 350 to 353. However both Zosimus and the fragmentary chronicle of John of Antioch report that Justina was too young at the time of her first marriage to have children. Galla thus had no known maternal half-siblings.\n\nGalla had three full-siblings. Her only brother was Valentinian II, first co-emperor with Gratian from 375 and then the only legitimate Western Roman Emperor from 383 to his death by hanging on 15 May 392. His death was officially reported as a suicide but Arbogast, his \"magister militum\", was suspected to have had a hand in it, an accusation found in the writings of Socrates of Constantinople, Orosius, and Zosimus. Sozomen was less certain and mentioned both versions of how Valentinian II died.\n\nHer two sisters were Grata and Justa. According to Socrates, both remained unmarried. They were probably still alive in 392 but not mentioned afterwards.\n\nGalla was cast into a role of significance because of conflict between three Roman emperors in the 380s. In 383, Gratian died while facing a major revolt under Magnus Maximus. Maximus proceeded to establish his control of a portion of the Roman Empire including Britain, Gaul, Hispania, and the Diocese of Africa. Ruling from his capital at Augusta Treverorum (Treves, Trier), he was able to negotiate his recognition by Valentinian II and Theodosius I starting in 384. Valentinian II's territory was effectively limited to Italia, ruling from Mediolanum (modern Milan).\n\nIn 387, the truce between Valentinian II and Maximus ended. Maximus crossed the Alps into the Po Valley and threatened \"Mediolanum\". Valentinian and Justina fled their capital for Thessaloniki, capital of the Praetorian prefecture of Illyricum and at the time the chosen residence of Theodosius. Galla accompanied them. Theodosius was then a widower, his first wife Aelia Flaccilla having died in 385 or 386.\n\nTheodosius granted refuge to the fugitives. According to Zosimus's account, Justina arranged for Galla to appear weeping before Theodosius and to appeal for his compassion. Galla was reportedly a beautiful woman and Theodosius was soon smitten and requested to marry her. Justina used this to her advantage, setting a condition for the marriage agreement under which Theodosius would have to attack Maximus and restore Valentinian II to his throne. Theodosius consented to Justina’s condition, the marriage probably taking place in late 387.\n\nThe account was questioned by Tillemont as inconsistent with the piety of Theodosius. He suggested that the marriage took place in 386, prior to the beginning of hostilities. However, Gibbon's \"The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire\" considered Zosimus' account more likely, and later works, including the \"Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology\", followed Gibbons' interpretation.\n\nWhen Galla married Theodosius, she became both a Roman empress and a stepmother to Theodosius’ two sons from his first marriage, Arcadius and Honorius. Arcadius was the eldest and had been declared an Augustus in January 383. He served as a nominal co-ruler to his father but was still approximately ten years old at the time of Galla's marriage.\n\nIn July and August of 388, the combined troops of Theodosius I and Valentinian II invaded the territory of Maximus under the leadership of Richomeres, Arbogast, Promotus, and Timasius. Maximus suffered a series of losses and surrendered in Aquileia. He was executed on 28 August 388 along with his son and nominal co-ruler Flavius Victor. Elen, his wife, and his two daughters were spared. Justina's condition for the marriage had been met, however she died the same year, unable to witness the result of her efforts.\n\nTheodosius installed Valentinian and his court at Vienne in Gaul, away from Milan and the influence of Ambrose. Theodosius appointed Arbogast as \"magister militum\" for the Western provinces. Acting in the name of Valentinian, Arbogast was actually subordinate only to Theodosius.\n\nTheodosius spent the years 388–391 in Italia, while Galla and her stepsons remained in the Great Palace of Constantinople. According to Marcellinus Comes, in 390 Arcadius expelled her from the palace. However, since Arcadius was only thirteen, that decision could as well have belonged to those who governed in his name.\n\nZosimus reports her mourning over the death of her brother in 392. On August 22 of the same year, Arbogast declared Eugenius as an emperor without the approval of Theodosius. Negotiations with Theodosius to achieve recognition were unsuccessful and, on 23 January 393, Theodosius declared his second son Honorius, an Augustus, the implication being that Theodosius alone was legitimate emperor. Conflict between the two emperors began the following year, resulting in the Battle of the Frigidus, on 5–6 September 394. Theodosius was victorious and gained control of the entire Roman Empire while Arbogast committed suicide and Eugenius was executed.\n\nWhether Galla lived to see the victory is uncertain. According to Zosimus, she died in childbirth within the same year, the exact date unknown.\n\nTillemont interpreted a passage of Philostorgius to identify Galla as an adherent of Arianism, however the passage actually seems to mean that her mother was Arian. Galla herself is identified as an Arian in the \"Chronicon Paschale\".\n\nGalla had three children with Theodosius who were:\n\n"}

GoPets was launched on August 4, 2005 and closed on November 8, 2009.\n\nGoPets resided not only on their owners' computers, but also visited GoPets members around the world when sent, invited or when pets decide to travel on their own.\n\nTo provide a means of communication among users who speak different languages, GoPets had a universal iconic language called \"IKU.\" The GoPets service also contained chat services and a forum.\n\nPlayers on GoPets had the ability to create a pet. After selecting which animal they desire, they had the opportunity to customize their new GoPet by selecting from a list of pre-set colors and patterns. Once the initial creation process was complete, the GoPet was brought into existence to reside on the player's desktop.\n\nIf players desired further customization, they could dress their pet up with unique clothing items, and equip different transportation vehicles such as cars or planes. Many equipable items hold trainable animations that GoPets could be taught to use when their stats were at a certain level.\n\nGoPets were social, and enjoyed interacting with other GoPets. These interactions included conversations, games, and professions of love and friendship which may result in a communal dance. GoPets loved to travel around desktops of players all around the world in search of other places where there were treated politely and affectionately.\n\nGoPets never died or became sick, despite the lack of care or how low their status might have become. However, GoPets would respond negatively to ill care and leave their owners' desktop frequently. For example, when very tired, GoPets would fall asleep often.\n\nGoLand was a GoPets term referring to a players desktop. New users were taken to a community desktop where books, food and clothing are able to be purchased. A user could purchase their own piece of GoLand by using the GoLand Map and searching for either a camping site or a tier 1 land. Camping sites were shown by a green paw, and only cost 1000 green shells; while the tier 1 lands were shown by an orange paw and cost 75 gold shells. Camping sites only allowed 75 items to be placed onto the desktop, while a tier 1 land allowed 250 items for non-subscribers, and 400 items for premium subscribers.\n\nPlayers could decorate their desktop with countless objects and toys for GoPets to play and interact with. GoPets could use many of the items by themselves. One popular item was a bathtub, which GoPets would utilize when their cleanliness status is low. In addition to toys and food, GoPets owners could place decorative items on the desktop, such as trees, shrubs or ponds. They could also mark items for sale, allowing visitors to their desktop to purchase these items at will.\n\nThe GoPets currency was known as the shell (they are simply colored seashells); green shells were the lowest denomination, pink shells were second, and gold shells were considered the most valuable. Gold Shells could be purchased for real money through Gopets, for $0.10 USD per shell. At the trading forum, some players traded shells for another, but the exchange rate could be rather outrageous ((100 gold shell: 500 pink shells: 20000 green shells)). All types of shells, as well as numerous items, could be found in fortune cookies; Green Tea Fortune Cookies were given Daily to un-subscribed users, while special Premium Fortune Cookies were given to the Subscribers.\n\nThe player's currency of Gold Shells to Pink Shells to Green Shells changed after GoPets discovered a flaw in their fortune cookie system which gave a higher payout of gold shells than a person who would buy the prepaid cards. Due to this, GoPets changed and revised the fortune cookie system making a daily maximum payout of 10 Gold Shells from pink fortune cookies.\n\nPink shells could only be used by Subscribers.\n\nUsers could interact with the GoPets on their desktop, by feeding them, petting them, playing with them, sending them to other players. GoPets could own micropets, little pets for your pets. Micropets included the Spring Butterfly, Baby Chick, Owl, Parrot, Penguin, and many others. Occasionally, micropets would make noise, and pets equipped with a micropet had their stats decreased at a faster pace.\n\nGoPets provided a Child Safety Mode which, once activated, allows the guardian to establish a Protector ID that limited the functions available for underage users. Only the specified Protector ID was able to send gifts to that account. The child's information was not viewable to the public.\n\nOne of the GoPets stores is devoted completely to mini games. These small games can be purchased just like any other GoPets item and played on the owner's desktop. When a GoPets user purchases a mini game, it will appear in their Inventory. To play it, double-click on its Inventory icon. However, the most recently released games are downloaded and played independently of the GoPets' client.\n\nPreviously, there were three other mini games available: Freethrow Shootout, BullsEye, and SkeeBall. However, these games were retired. All games released after the retiring of these games had different rules, a different prize point payout, and were downloaded separately rather than within the Gopets client.\n\nThere were seven Mini Games available .\"\n, they are: Poker, Diner Dash 2, Eets, CandyShot, Sudoku, Shangai, and Magic Ball.\n\nGoDance, a rhythm game, was released for free to GoPets users. There was a forum dedicated to GoDance which includes the latest link to download the updated GoDance game as well as talk to other GoDancers.\n\nThe GoPets service contained limited email and chat services, including a message board. Users could block other users, or add them as friends. They could also send Private Messages to them, and leave 'Testimonials' on their profile for all to see.\n\nThere was also a program called 'GoChat'. Though only Premium users could make private 'chat rooms', un-subscribed users could make public rooms. It featured font customization, with a number of fonts to choose from.\n\nGoPets users had the ability to give back to the community as well by buying certain items. A portion of the shells used to purchase the items were donated to certain charities. In addition to purchasing items, users could donate shells directly to the charities of their choice by visiting the Giving through GoPets page.\n\nFrom summer 2007 to July 2009, GoPets was available on Windows Live Messenger via partnership with Microsoft. Players could access GoPets from MSN Messenger, playing the game and gaining access to a unique panda pet. Press coverage of the partnership referred to GoPets as \"a global dog park for the 21st century\" for how players could meet through their pets across global distances. The GoPet ambassador to MSN Messenger was called Lily Panda.\n\nIn the Spring of 2007, Konami Digital Entertainment (Konami Corporation) released GoPets Vacation Island for the Nintendo DS. Developed by 1st Playable Productions, the game would allow the player to make and visit friends, as well as play minigames, design foods and items and dress their pets up in clothing. The DS game, like the web version, had IKU chat and minigames.\n\nIn early 2007, One Nine Studios developed a mobile game called GoPets: Matchu Petchu, where players could play minigames on mobile phones and unlock a special monkey pet.\n\nA premium account gave users extra benefits, but it was not required for the website. Users with premium accounts received discounts when buying gold shells. Instead of receiving \"green tea fortune cookies\" on a daily basis, premium account users received \"premium fortune cookies\", which gave out at least 1 gold shell and up to 2112. Premium users received a special item each month, for the extent of their subscription. Premium users gained access to certain shops where they could purchase items such as the \"Custom Creation Tool\". This was used to create items of clothing and furniture with custom textures uploaded onto the client that could then be used on the user's pets or land.\n\nThere were 2 different types of premium memberships available. The first was the monthly GoPremium, which gives the premium user the premium item of the month. The second was the yearly Premium Plus 12, which includes the premium item of the month for an entire year as well as an exclusive playset. This system was time based meaning you can have at least 1 month of premium account. After the time limit has passed, the user's account reverts to the normal account but the user's items are still theirs to keep.\n\nOn August 28, 2006 GoPets, Ltd. was selected as a Red Herring 100 Asia Winner for 2006.\n\nIn early November 2009 GoPets announced it had been sold to Zynga. Zynga immediately closed GoPets down, around the time that Zynga launched their Pet Society clone, PetVille.\n\n"}

Unless made of a highly durable material (e.g. china), they would often be enclosed in a glass container (known as globes) to protect them from the weather. In some cases, they were embedded into the grave itself (e.g. on the concrete over the grave) while others were merely placed on or by the grave.\nIn \"Life on the Mississippi\", Mark Twain comments on burial practices in New Orleans: \"They bury their dead in vaults, above the ground. ... Fresh flowers, in vases of water, are to be seen at the portals of many of the vaults: placed there by the pious hands of bereaved parents and children, husbands and wives, and renewed daily. A milder form of sorrow finds its inexpensive and lasting remembrancer in the coarse and ugly but indestructible 'immortelle'—which is a wreath or cross or some such emblem, made of rosettes of black linen, with sometimes a yellow rosette at the conjunction of the cross's bars—kind of sorrowful breast-pin, so to say. The immortelle requires no attention: you just hang it up, and there you are; just leave it alone, it will take care of your grief for you, and keep it in mind better than you can; stands weather first-rate, and lasts like boiler-iron.\"\nImmortelles were popular in Australia in the early 20th century. Being more expensive than fresh flowers, immortelles were normally left on graves by close family. They were purchased from undertakers.\n\nIn recent times, plastic flowers have replaced immortelles as a long-lasting flower arrangement for use with graves. Therefore, immortelles will mostly only be seen on older graves.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "13458909", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13458909", "title": "IvanAnywhere", "text": "IvanAnywhere\n\nIvanAnywhere is a simple, remote-controlled telepresence robot created by Sybase iAnywhere programmers to enable their co-worker, Ivan Bowman, to telecommute to work more efficiently. The robot enables Bowman to be virtually present at conferences and presentations, and to discuss product development with other developers face-to-face. IvanAnywhere is powered by SAP's mobile database product, SQL Anywhere.\n\nIvan Bowman has been a software developer at Sybase/iAnywhere/SAP since 1993, and now is an Engineering Director at SAP Canada. In 2002 his wife received a job in Halifax approximately from his place of work in Waterloo, Ontario, Canada, North America. His employers allowed him to telecommunicate initially via email, instant messenger, and phone.\n\nUsing speakerphone during meetings was less than ideal because Ivan could not see his co-workers' visual communication clues, or what they wrote on the white board. The first solution was a stationary webcam with a speaker, which was kept in the corner of the office. The problem with this method was that the webcam was just that – stationary. Ivan could not see people if they were not standing near the webcam. More frustrating, perhaps, was that Ivan could hear distant conversations through the webcam's microphone, but was unable to contribute to the conversation if the impromptu meeting did not take place in his visual range.\n\nIn November 2005, iAnywhere programmer Ian McHardy and Director of Engineering Glenn Paulley (Ivan’s immediate manager) conceived the idea of IvanAnywhere after Glenn saw a television commercial for a remote controlled toy blimp. In January 2007, after considering different possible designs and getting through a number of deadlines related to iAnywhere releases, Ian started working on a proof-of-concept: a tablet computer and webcam mounted on a radio-controlled toy truck.\n\nIn February 2007, even though the truck was challenging to drive and the webcam was only a few inches above the floor, Ivan was able to successfully drive the proof-of-concept from Halifax.\n\nIn May 2007, Ivan started using Ian's full version daily. The full version of IvanAnywhere consists of a wheeled base with 24-volt SuperDroid Robots motors. The motor and wheel assemblies support \"tank drive\" so that Ivan can negotiate through doorways and meeting rooms more easily. Above the motors sits a box filled with wires, various electronics, and batteries which power the robot for a full work day. The entire robot weighs approximately 40 kg.\n\nA 1.5 meter (5 foot) aluminum bar supports a webcam with a gray foam ball mounted above it. The robot is equipped with a webcam, speakers, microphone, and a tablet computer with a live feed from Bowman's webcam to help coworkers to communicate with him more naturally. Infrared proximity sensors keep the robot from bumping into walls and cubicles.\n\nThe tablet PC mounted on IvanAnywhere runs a SQL Anywhere database server. One of the tasks of the SQL Anywhere database is to retain monitoring statistics on a wide variety of controls and sensors on the robot. This is so that Ian can monitor how far the robot travels in any particular period, how many times the proximity sensors have halted the robot's motion, the robot's network connectivity uptime, and other related statistics.\n\nIvan \"drives\" the robot from his home office in Halifax using a two-joystick PC gaming console. One joystick controls the webcam, the other the robot's drive system.\n\nIn October 2007, a digital camera was mounted on the bar so that Ivan could take high-resolution pictures of whiteboards, presentation slides, and overheads, or just look out the window.\n\nThe robot needs to be recharged at the end of every work day. Until recently, this required a Waterloo co-worker to plug it in before leaving for the night. In May 2008, Ian constructed a charging bay out of lumber that Ivan \"drives\" into - copper bars attached to the robot connect to copper springs on the charging unit which are directly connected to the battery charger and enabled through a relay circuit so that the charging bars are not live unless the robot is in the bay. The charging bay permits Ivan to recharge the robot at his convenience, and without assistance.\n\nIvanAnywhere is very popular with other people in the building and the SAP Engineering floor has become a regular stop on visitor tours of the SAP building.\n\nAlthough most of Bowman's colleagues treat IvanAnywhere as one of their own, people who aren't used to the robot are sometimes uncomfortable talking to it instead of a human being.\n\n\n\n"}

The first human starship to land on Altair IV, the \"Bellerophon\", was destroyed, with the only survivors being Dr. Edward Morbius along with his wife (who later died of natural causes) and daughter. In his isolation, Morbius became the lone researcher to ever study the extinct Krell.\n\nThe Krell had reached an incredibly advanced stage of technological and scientific development, able to — among other things — reproduce down to the molecular level any matter for which they had a pre-existing sample to serve as a template. Another Krell device that played a prominent role in the film was their \"plastic educator,\" a device able to create a three-dimensional visualization of the operator's thoughts while acting directly on the brain to measure intelligence and impart knowledge. Although previously demonstrated to be fatal to humans, its use by Dr. Morbius had boosted his IQ such that he could understand some of the basic science of the Krell (allowing him, for instance, to \"tinker together\" the amazing Robby the Robot.) Morbious remarks that while his IQ has been boosted to over twice the human average, he would be a mentally handicapped \"moron\" compared to the Krell themselves. Morbius also believed that the Krell, after millions of years of social advancement, were not only technologically but morally superior to humanity — a benevolent and noble race of scholars and pacifists, who had evolved beyond war and violence. \n\nMorbius, however, discovered that in a single day and night, 2,000 centuries past, the entire Krell race disappeared. In the time since, all above-ground evidence of their civilization had vanished. He didn't know exactly what happened to them in this shockingly rapid cataclysmic event. For that matter, Morbius did not know what the Krell looked like: no record of their physical nature survived, except perhaps in the form of their characteristic arch which served as the doorway between rooms. This doorway, coming to a triangular point at the top and much wider at the middle than at the top and bottom, suggests a being of enormous girth.\n\nDuring the events of the film, the starship C-57D arrives on Altair IV, 20 years after Morbius was trapped there. After meeting them, Morbius gives the command crew a tour of the Krell's crowning achievement: a vast underground machine of virtually unlimited power, so advanced that it could give physical form to any matter they could conceive of, by remotely scanning their brain synapses — creation at mere thought, moving beyond the need for a pre-existing physical template, but based on limitless imagination. \n\nThe C-57D's Lt. \"Doc\" Ostrow later uses the plastic educator, causing fatal injury to his brain, but briefly allowing him to infer the cause of the Krell downfall: \"Monsters from the Id\". Commander Adams confronts Morbius with this and is able to piece together what happened: the Id is an (\"obsolete\" and outdated) term for the base subconscious mind, composed of raw, animalistic emotions like hate, lust, and jealousy. The Krell machine was so advanced that it didn't just give physical form and life to their conscious thoughts, but their \"subconscious\" thoughts as well. Even for the advanced Krell this Freudian personality characteristic, although long forgotten, had not been eliminated. When combined with the power of their machine, the unbridled emotions of their Ids were all at once willed into physical reality and let loose to eradicate the entire Krell race. Upon this realization, Morbius laments that the \"poor Krell\", benevolent pacifists who had eradicated violent thoughts from their conscious minds for over a million years, had no way of even understanding what was slaughtering them.\n\n\n\nReference: 1979 \"Cinefantastique\" Magazine Double-Issue (Volume 8 – Number 2 & Volume 8 – Number 3)\nMAKING FORBIDDEN PLANET – By Frederick S. Clarke and Steve Rubin\n\nThe steps leading up to the Krell door ... were designed to be separated by a smooth ramp in the middle.\n\nIn the article the cinematographer of the \"Forbidden Planet\" film, George Folsey states:\n\nThe Krell were originally frog-like in nature with two long legs and a big tail. They were never shown, but it was indicated in the original screenplay that the ramps between the steps were designed to accommodate their dragging tail.\n"}

The attacker was later identified as José Rodríguez, a 59-year-old man who had a grievance with the pair over either land or as a result of their media work, such as a report from a week earlier about polluted lands.\n\nThe murder of journalists in the Dominican Republic is rare. Since 1997, only four journalists have been killed. In Medina's case, there was no immediate motive, although Medina had criticized a political movement in San Pedro de Macorís Province.\n\nJournalists killed on air or in front of a camera have become more common since 2015. In the United States, journalist Alison Parker and camera operator Adam Ward were killed on air on August 26, 2015. The Committee to Protect Journalists has highlighted the danger to journalists.\n\n"}
{"id": "67970", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=67970", "title": "Lycopodiophyta", "text": "Lycopodiophyta\n\nThe Division Lycopodiophyta (sometimes called lycophyta or lycopods) is a tracheophyte subgroup of the Kingdom Plantae. It is one of the oldest lineages of extant (living) vascular plants and contains extinct plants like \"Baragwanathia\" that have been dated from the Silurian (ca. 425 million years ago). These species reproduce by shedding spores and have macroscopic alternation of generations, although some are homosporous while others are heterosporous. Most members of Lycopodiophyta bear a protostele, and the sporophyte generation is dominant. They differ from all other vascular plants in having microphylls, leaves that have only a single vascular trace (vein) rather than the much more complex megaphylls found in ferns and seed plants.\n\nThere are around 1,290 (Christenhusz & Byng 2016) living (extant) species of Lycopodiophyta which are generally divided into three extant orders (Lycopodiales, Isoetales, and Selaginellales), in addition to extinct groups. There is some variation in how the extant orders are grouped into classes: they may be put into a single class; they may be put into two classes, with the Isoetales and Selaginellales combined into one class; or they may be put into three classes, one order in each. The system which uses two classes for extant species is:\n\n\nThe extant orders each have a single family with a total of 12 genera and 1290 known species (Christenhusz & Byng 2016).\n\nThe following phylogram shows a likely relationship between Lycopodiophyta orders.\n\nThe following is another phylogram showing the evolution of Lycopodiophytes. Note the \"Cooksonia\"-like plants and zosterophylls are a paraphyletic grade of stem group Lycopodiophytes.\n\nNotes:\n\nThe members of this division have a long evolutionary history, and fossils are abundant worldwide, especially in coal deposits. In fact, most known genera are extinct. The Silurian species \"Baragwanathia longifolia\" represents the earliest identifiable Lycopodiophyta, while some \"Cooksonia\" seem to be related. \"Lycopodolica\" is another Silurian genus which appears to be an early member of this group.\n\nFossils ascribed to the Lycopodiophyta first appear in the Silurian period, along with a number of other vascular plants. Phylogenetic analysis places them at the base of the vascular plants; they are distinguished by their microphylls and by transverse dehiscence of their sporangia (as contrasted with longitudinal in other vascular plants). Sporangia of living species are borne on the upper surfaces of microphylls (called sporophylls). In some groups, these sporophylls are clustered into strobili.\n\nDevonian fossil trees from Svalbard, growing in equatorial regions, raise the possibility that they drew down enough carbon dioxide significantly to change the earth's climate.\n\nDuring the Carboniferous Period, tree-like Lycopodiophyta (such as \"Lepidodendron\") formed huge forests that dominated the landscape. The complex ecology of these tropical rainforests collapsed during the mid Pennsylvanian due to a change in climate.\n\nUnlike modern trees, leaves grew out of the entire surface of the trunk and branches, but would fall off as the plant grew, leaving only a small cluster of leaves at the top. Their remains formed many fossil coal deposits. In Fossil Park, Glasgow, Scotland, fossilized Lycopodiophyta trees can be found in sandstone. The trees are marked with diamond-shaped scars where they once had leaves.\n\nThe group also evolved roots independently from the rest of the vascular plants.\n\nThe Lycopodiophyta had their maximum diversity in the Upper Carboniferous, particularly tree-like \"Lepidodendron\" and \"Sigillaria\", that dominated tropical wetlands. In Euramerica these became apparently extinct in the Late Pennsylvanian, as a result of a transition to a much drier climate, to give way to conifers, ferns and horsetails. In Cathaysia (now South China) tree-like Lycopodiophytes survived into the Permian. Nevertheless, lycopsids are rare in the Lopingian (latest Permian), but regained dominance in the Induan (earliest Triassic), particularly \"Pleuromeia\". After the worldwide Permian–Triassic extinction event Lycopodiophyta pioneered the repopulation of habitats as opportunistic plants. The heterogeneity of the terrestrial plant communities increased markedly during the Middle Triassic when plant groups like sphenopsids, ferns, pteridosperms, cycadophytes, ginkgophytes and conifers resurfaced and diversified quickly.\n\nClub-mosses are \"homosporous\", but the genera \"Selaginella\" and \"Isoetes\" are \"heterosporous\", with female spores larger than the male, and gametophytes forming entirely within the spore walls. A few species of \"Selaginella\" such as \"S. apoda\" and \"S. rupestris\" are also viviparous; the gametophyte develops on the mother plant, and only when the sporophyte's primary shoot and root is developed enough for independence is the new plant dropped to the ground.\nThe spores of Lycopodiophyta are highly flammable and so have been used in fireworks. Huperzine A, a chemical isolated from the Chinese firmoss \"Huperzia serrata\", is under investigation as a possible treatment for Alzheimer's disease.\n\n"}
{"id": "47792", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=47792", "title": "Martian", "text": "Martian\n\nA Martian is a native inhabitant of the planet Mars. Although the search for evidence of life on Mars continues, many science fiction writers have imagined what extraterrestrial life on Mars might be like. Some writers also use the word \"Martian\" to describe a human colonist on Mars.\n\nThe earliest known instances of the word \"Martian\", used as a noun instead of an adjective, were printed in late 1877. They appeared nearly simultaneously in England and the United States, in magazine articles detailing Asaph Hall's discovery of the moons of Mars in August of that year.\n\nThe next event to inspire the use of the noun \"Martian\" in print was the International Exposition of Electricity, which was hosted in Paris in the year 1881. During the four months of the exhibition, many people visited to witness such technological marvels as the incandescent light bulb and the telephone. One visitor came away wondering what kind of world such innovations might engender in the next 200 years. Writing anonymously, s/he assembled some speculations in an essay titled \"The Year of Grace 2081\", which enjoyed wide circulation. The Martians enter the story late in the narrative. During a rest from international conflict on Earth, humans begin telecommunicating with Martians. \"After a brief period passed in the exchange of polite messages\", says the essayist, humans will decide to war with the Martians on some pretence of honor. The war that results is cataclysmic:\n\nW. S. Lach-Szyrma's novel \"Aleriel, or A Voyage to Other Worlds\" (1883) was previously reputed to be the first published work to apply the word \"Martian\" as a noun. The usage is incidental; it occurs when Aleriel, the novel's protagonist, lands on Mars in a spacecraft called an \"ether-car\" (an allusion to aether, which was once postulated as a gaseous medium in outer space). Aleriel buries the car in snow \"so that it might not be disturbed by any Martian who might come across it.\"\nFifteen years after Aleriel, H. G. Wells' landmark novel \"The War of the Worlds\" (1898) was published by William Heinemann, Ltd., then a relatively new publishing house. The novel was revised numerous times, and has since been translated into many languages. In the story, the Martians are a technologically advanced race of octopus-like extraterrestrials who invade Earth because Mars is becoming too cold to sustain them. The Martians' undoing is a fatal vulnerability to Earth bacteria.\n\nIn his book \"Mars and Its Canals\" (1906), astronomer and businessman Percival Lowell conjectured that an extinct Martian race had once constructed a vast network of aqueducts to channel water to their settlements from Mars' polar ice caps, Planum Australe and Planum Boreum. Lowell did not invent this Martian canal hypothesis, but he supported it. The belief that Mars had canals was based on observations Giovanni Schiaparelli made through his reflecting telescope. Although the telescope's image was fuzzy, Schiaparelli thought he saw long, straight lines on the Martian surface; some astronomers came to believe that these lines were structures built by Martians. This idea inspired Lowell, who returned to the subject in \"Mars As the Abode of Life\" (1910), in which he wrote a fanciful description of what this Martian society may have been like. Although his description was based on almost no evidence, Lowell's words evoked vivid pictures in his readers' imaginations.\n\nOne of the people Lowell inspired was Edgar Rice Burroughs, who began writing his own story about Mars in the summer of 1911. The story is a planetary romance in which an American Civil War veteran named John Carter is transported to Mars when he walks inside a cave on Earth. He finds that Mars is populated by two species of warring humanoids, and he becomes embroiled in their conflict. In February 1912, an American pulp magazine called \"The All-Story\" published Burroughs' story as the first installment of a serial novel, which the editor titled \"Under the Moons of Mars\" (retitled \"A Princess of Mars\" in subsequent editions). The book was the first in Burroughs' Barsoom series.\n\nAlthough the noun \"Martian\" can describe any organism from Mars, these and later works typically imagine Martians as a humanoid monoculture. \"Martian\", in this sense, is more like the word \"human\" than the word \"Earthling\". (Few writers describe a biodiverse Mars.) In science fiction, Martians are stereotypically imagined in one or more of the following ways: as alien invaders; as humanoids with a civilization that resembles one on Earth; as anthropomorphic animals; as beings with superhuman abilities; as humanoids with a lower intelligence than humans; as human colonists who adopt a Martian identity; and/or as an extinct race who possessed high intelligence.\n\nH. G. Wells' novel \"The War of the Worlds\" (1898) and its various adaptations have been an extraordinary influence on science fiction writers for more than 100 years. Wells' Martians are a technologically advanced species with an ancient civilization. They somewhat resemble cephalopods, with large, bulky brown bodies and sixteen snake-like tentacles, in two groups of eight, around a quivering V-shaped mouth; they move around in 100 feet tall tripod fighting-machines they assemble upon landing, killing everything in their path. They invade Earth because Mars is dying, and they need a warmer planet to live. They attack cities in southern England, including London, with a deadly heat-ray they fire from a camera-like device on an articulated arm attached to their tripods; they also employ chemical warfare, using a poisonous \"black smoke\" launched from gun-like tubes. Mankind is saved by Earth bacteria, which kill the Martians within three weeks of their landing on Earth.\n\nIn \"Last and First Men\" (1930) Olaf Stapledon revisited Wells' theme of Martian invasion. \"Last and First Men\" summarizes tens of thousands of years of invasions and war between Martians and humans. Eventually, humans destroy the Martians' empire.\n\nWilliam Cameron Menzies' film \"Invaders from Mars\" (1953) fuses the tentacles of Wells' Martians with the idea of little green men to conceive a Martian Mastermind who enslaves tall, green, humanoid mutants. Tobe Hooper's remake of the film was released in 1986,\n\nIn his 1955 comic novel \"Martians, Go Home\", Fredric Brown spoofs the Wellsian invasion, and reinterprets the Martian invader as a rude house guest with ulterior motives. Brown, too, employs the \"little green men\" trope to describe his annoying Martians.\n\nLittle green men recur in the 2009 video game \"Stalin vs. Martians\", a spoof of earlier strategy video games. As the president of the Soviet Union, the player defends Earth from Martian invasion. This time the caricature of the Martians appears to be influenced by H. R. Giger.\n\nIn \"Spaced Invaders\" (1990), a group of Martians invade a town in the Midwestern United States during a re-broadcast of the Orson Wells' 1938 radio dramatization of \"The War of the Worlds\".\n\nIn 1948, Warner Bros. introduced a new villain to their animated films: Marvin the Martian, a short, slender figure with comically oversized eyes, hands, and feet, but with no visible mouth. His big, spherical head is either completely black or overshadowed by his crested helmet. His clothing is patterned on that of Mars, the god of war in Roman mythology. In Marvin's film debut, \"Haredevil Hare\" (1948), he attempts to blow up Earth because it \"obscures [his] view of Venus\", but is thwarted by Bugs Bunny.\n\nAnother film that imagines Martians as ineffectual invaders is \"Mars Attacks!\" (1996), a black comedy based on a Topps trading card series. Here, the Martian invaders are loud, irritating, and dim-witted, despite having oversized heads with extremely large, protruding brains. The film was written by Jonathan Gems, and directed by Tim Burton.\n\nIn the \"Superman\" story \"Black Magic on Mars\" (1950), the conception of Martians is more grave: The Martian invaders Superman faces are led by a dictator called Martler, who is an admirer of Adolf Hitler.\n\nIn \"Will the Real Martian Please Stand Up?\", a 1961 episode of \"The Twilight Zone\", Martians attempt to colonize Earth, but are thwarted by Venusians. Here, the Martians are disguised as humans, but towards the end of the episode we see that they have three eyes.\n\nIn \"Mars Needs Moms\" (2007), a picture book by Berkeley Breathed, Martians are squat, humanoid beings with antennae and skin color that varies by individual. When they travel to Earth, they wear transparent helmets and a bulbous, ribbed outer garment. In the story, a five-year-old boy learns to appreciate his mother after three Martians kidnap her while he sleeps. Writer-director Simon Wells and his wife Wendy adapted the picture book into the film \"Mars Needs Moms\" (2011).\n\nIn April 1911, about a year before \"The All-Story\" published the first installment of Burroughs' \"Under the Moons of Mars\", \"Modern Electrics\" began publishing Hugo Gernsback's own romance, \"Ralph 124C 41+\", which takes place on Earth. Gernsback's Martians live among the humans on Earth; they are taller and physically stronger than humans, with green skin and large eyes. The serial wasn't republished as a book until 1925.\n1923 saw the publication of \"Aelita, or The Decline of Mars\", a novel that is equally science fiction and political fiction. Its author, Soviet Russian writer Aleksey Nikolayevich Tolstoy, tells a story of a Soviet engineer who builds a rocket and invites an acquaintance to accompany him in it to Mars. There they find a humanoid race of Martians who are the offspring of both an elder Martian species and of humans from Atlantis. The Martians live in a class society; the workers rise up against the ruling class, but the revolution fails. All the while, Mars is entering a phase of climate change that threatens disaster for the population.\n\n\"Red Planet\" (1932), a play cowritten by John L. Balderston and John Hoare, also deals with radical environmental change on Mars, except in this case it occurs through terraforming. Balderston was one of the few playwrights of the 20th century to adopt Mars or Martians as a subject for the stage. He was, however, also a screenwriter who specialized in fantasy film and horror film. Many years later, United Artists bought a screen adaptation that Balderston and fellow screenwriter Anthony Veiller wrote. Harry Horner directed the film, called \"Red Planet Mars\", and it was released to cinemas in 1952. In the film, a scientist communicates with Martians by radio, and they tell him that Mars is a utopia. When the news circulates, it causes widespread unrest among the people of Western nations. The US government tries to silence further messages, then later announces that the Martians have informed them that they must all worship God in order to save themselves. After millions of people revolt against their governments, it seems the Martian communiques may have been a hoax.\n\nRay Bradbury's novel \"The Martian Chronicles\" (1950) depicts Martians as a refined and artistic race of golden-skinned beings who closely resemble humans. The Martians are almost completely wiped out by the diseases brought to Mars by human invaders. At the end of the book, the human inhabitants of Mars realize that they are the new Martians. The novel's themes and its portrayal of Martians resemble Bradbury's 1949 short story \"Dark They Were, and Golden-Eyed\".\n\nBrothers Jim Thomas and John Thomas teamed with Graham Yost to write \"Mission to Mars\" (2000), a film that depicts Martians as tall, feminine, peaceful humanoids who left Mars to escape the havoc caused by a massive meteorite impact.\n\nEdmond Hamilton's \"A Conquest of Two Worlds\" describes Martians as humanoid creatures with stilt-like limbs and large, bulging chests and heads. They live in tribal groups centered on oases and occasionally fight among themselves. After an accidental confrontation sparks war, they are all killed or enslaved by the invading human population.\n\nC. S. Lewis wrote, in \"Out of the Silent Planet\" (1938), about three humans who visit Mars and meet three different kinds of intelligent native creatures: The hrossa (bipedal \"otter\" men), the sorns/séroni (lean white giants), and the pfifltriggi (dwarves). They are dying out, but are resigned to their fate. The books also describe a prey animal called hnakra, which is hunted. The planet is ruled by the Oyarsa, an \"eldil\" (supernatural beings/spirits) whose job is to be the guardian of the planet and ruler of its peoples.\n\nIn four stories by Eric Frank Russell published between the early 1940s and mid-1950s—and collected in\"Men, Martians and Machines\" (1955)—a crew of humans and octopoid Martians are shipmates and compatriots on an interstellar voyage. During their travels, they encounter hostile aliens. Russell's Martians can survive in Earth-normal air pressures, but are more comfortable wearing low-pressure helmets and tease their shipmates about the soupy conditions on board.\n\nAs a writer for \"Doctor Who\", Brian Hayles created a Martian species of reptilian humanoids called the Ice Warriors, who move stiffly and speak in a husky whisper. Most of the Ice Warriors that the Doctor encounters are brutish and belligerent. As Mars' climate becomes less favorable to sustaining them, the Ice Warriors seek a new planet. These reptilians debuted in \"The Ice Warriors\" (1967), a \"Doctor Who\" television serial about an impending ice age in Earth's future. As British scientists try to slow or avert a glacier encroaching on Great Britain, they find an Ice Warrior near their base, frozen in the glacier, and apparently in suspended animation. No one knows the being's identity, but they understand that it is probably from another planet. When the Ice Warrior revives, he attacks Jamie McCrimmon and kidnaps Victoria Waterfield. Other stories set in the future show the Martians eventually become more peaceful and are members of the Galactic Federation, though some want to return to their warlike ways.\n\nMany of Robert A. Heinlein's Martian characters are humans born and raised on Mars. In \"Red Planet\" (1949), boys attend a boarding school in a human colony on Mars. A population of native Martians tolerates them until the colony administrator threatens a Martian child. The Martians demand that the humans leave Mars, but a human doctor convinces them to reconsider.\n\nIn Heinlein's 1956 novel \"Double Star\", humans have colonized the solar system, and a politician on Mars faces the civil rights issue of granting a native Martian species (who are second-class citizens) the right to vote.\n\nIn Philip K. Dick's novel \"Martian Time-Slip\" (1964), a human colony on Mars is trying to cope with arduous environmental conditions. They treat an aboriginal race, whom they call \"Bleekmen\", with casual racism. In \"The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch\" (1965), Mars has no indigenous life. To cope with the sterile habitat, the human colonists abuse drugs such as \"Can-D\" and \"Chew-Z\".\n\nDick previously published a shorter version of the story in 1963, called \"All We Marsmen\". Like Heinlein's \"Double Star\", \"All We Marsmen\" was conceived at a time in US history when many marginalized people were fighting especially vehemently for more civil rights. US President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Civil Rights Act of 1964 into law on 2 July 1964.\n\n\"Total Recall\" (1990) is a science fiction action film about an apparently unsophisticated construction worker who turns out to be a freedom fighter from Mars who has been relocated to Earth. He later learns of an alien artifact that proves Mars harbored life before the human colonization.\n\nThe character designers for \"Futurama\", a comical American animated series, imagine Mars after human colonization as being like the American frontier; native Martians inhabit zones analogous to Indian reservations. One of the series principal characters, Amy Wong, is a scientist of Chinese descent who was born on Mars. Her parents have amassed an enormous fortune and enterprise there.\n\nRebecca Bloomer's novel \"Unearthed\" (2011), the first in a series, describes a futuristic human colony on Mars amidst the populations of native Martians.\n\nFor his Known Space series of novels, Larry Niven conceived humanoid Martians with a primitive material culture who inhabit an environment of red dust and nitric acid, and for whom water is lethal. In the 1973 novel \"Protector\", a man named Jack Brennan allies himself with a ruthless, xenophobic humanoid species called the Pak. To preclude the possibility future competition for Pak offspring, Brennan engineers a Martian genocide by sending an ice-covered asteroid to collide with Mars.\n\nIn Dennis Feltham Jones' 1977 novel \"Colossus and the Crab\", Martian life predated life on Earth, but faced a process of devolution as conditions on the planet worsened.\n\n\"Quatermass and the Pit\" (1958–59) is a British television serial in which a crashed spacecraft is discovered in London. The wreck evidences that the human population of Earth resulted from the experiments of a Martian civilisation, now long dead. A film remake was released in 1967.\n\n\"Ghosts of Mars\" (2001) human invaders war with Martians in an attempt to conquer Mars.\n\nIn the \"Invader Zim\" episode \"Battle of the Planets\" (2001), Zim discovers that a Martian race died off after converting Mars into a giant spacecraft.\n\nIn \"Doom 3\" (2004), the entire Martian race sacrificed itself many millennia ago in order to prevent a demonic invasion of our universe. By the year 2145, humanity has colonized Mars and begun excavating the ruins of their civilization, recovering several important artifacts. One of these artifacts—known as the Soul Cube—is the player's most valuable tool in combating a second demonic invasion, as it is the only weapon capable of killing the Cyberdemon.\n\nIsaac Asimov's \"David Starr, Space Ranger\", the first novel in the Lucky Starr series, features a race of Martians who have retreated into vast artificial underground caverns half a million years ago. These Martians are incorporeal, telepathic beings, peaceful yet curious about humanity. They have access to advanced technologies completely incomprehensible to human beings, like personal energy shield generators the size of a fabric mask.\n\nIn Robert Heinlein's \"Stranger in a Strange Land\" (1961), a man raised by native Martians emigrates to Earth, where he must reacclimate. In the novel he functions as a Christ figure. Soon he demonstrates psychic powers, superhuman intelligence, and an ability to manipulate higher dimensions. He founds a church on Earth based on Martian philosophy, and starts a cultural shift. At the novel's climax, he is murdered by a mob from a rival religious group.\n\nIn 1963, American television network CBS premiered a sitcom called \"My Favorite Martian\". The series proved popular in the US, especially during the first season, and CBS broadcast more than one hundred episodes before canceling it when the third season ended in 1966. In this comedy, a Martian anthropologist (who passes for human in most respects) crashes on Earth, where he is harbored by an American man who keeps the Martian's identity secret. Also secret are the Martian's extraordinary abilities, not the least of which are invisibility and telepathy. CBS's rival networks, NBC and ABC, did not fail to notice the success of \"My Favorite Martian\", or the comic potential of a character with secret powers. In 1964, ABC introduced \"Bewitched\" (a sitcom about a married, suburban witch), and NBC countered the following year with \"I Dream of Jeannie\", a sitcom about an astronaut who discovers and marries a genie.\n\nIn \"Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons\" (1967–68), the Mysterons are a race of invisible superbeings from Mars who are at war with humans from Earth. The conflict begins when Captain Black, a human officer investigating radio signals from Mars, mistakes a surveillance camera for a weapon. In violation of his orders, he attacks, but the Mysterons immediately repair the damage he caused. The conflict escalates, and the Mysterons attempt to assassinate the president of Earth.\n\nDC Comics introduced the first Martian superhero to the DC Universe in 1955. Martian Manhunter (J'onn J'onzz), a green humanoid who is believed to be the last of the peaceful Green Martians, joins the Justice League. Meanwhile, the warlike, shapeshifting White Martians regard the Green Martians as enemies. The White Martians adopt a humanoid form which, they say, expresses their distinctive philosophy. DC introduced a White Martian superhero, Miss Martian, in 2006. A third race, the Yellow Martians, may or may not have survived as long as the Green and White Martians.\n\n"}

{"id": "5148171", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5148171", "title": "Post-stroke depression", "text": "Post-stroke depression\n\nPost-stroke depression (PSD) is considered the most frequent and important neuropsychiatric consequence of stroke. Approximately one-third of stroke survivors experience major depression. Moreover, this condition can have an adverse effect on cognitive function, functional recovery and survival.\n\nThe Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) IV categorizes post-stroke depression as “mood disorder due to a general medical condition” (i.e. stroke) with the specifiers of depressive features, major depressive-like episodes, manic features, or mixed features. Utilizing patient data from acute hospital admission, community surveys, or out patient clinics previous studies have identified two types of depressive disorders associated with cerebral ischemia: major depression, which occurs in up to 25% of patients; and minor depression, which has been defined for research purposes by DSM-IV criteria as a depressed mood or loss of interest and at least two but fewer than four symptoms of major depression. Minor depression occurs in up to 30% of patients following stroke.\n\nPrevalence clearly varies over time with an apparent peak 3–6 months after stroke and subsequent decline in prevalence at one-year reaches about to 50% of initial rates. Robinson and colleagues characterized the natural course of major depression after stroke with spontaneous remission typically 1 to 2 years after stroke However, it was also noted that in few cases depression becomes chronic and may persist more than 3 years following stroke . On the other hand, minor depression appeared to be more variable, with both short term and long term depression occurring in these patients .\n\nPost-stroke depression is highly prevalent among both men and women post-stroke, however, it appears that post-stoke depression is more common in women when prevalence is compared between the sexes.\n\nWomen were twice as likely to experience post-stroke depression than men. It is hypothesized, based on CT scanning, that of the two sexes experiencing post-stroke depression, women who had post-stroke depression had a higher rate of left hemisphere lesions than men. However, risk of post-stroke depression can not be determined effectively based on the location of the lesion in the brain and more research in this area is needed.\n\nIt has also been postulated that the risk of developing post-stroke depression in male patients is partly linked to having a high level of limitations and disability in functioning, especially in performing activities of daily living (ADL's), as a result of their stroke; the greater the limitation, the greater the severity. Risk of developing depression post-stroke in women is partly linked to a history of psychological disorders as well as limitations involving cognition as a result of their stroke.\n\nThe scientific community is divided into two “camps” supporting opposing views: some propose a primary biological mechanism with stroke affecting neural circuits involved in mood regulation which in turn causes post-stroke depression, while other researchers claim that post stroke depression is caused by social and psychological stressors that emerge as a result of stroke.\n\nWhile an integrated bio-psycho-social model including both biological and psychosocial aspects of post stroke depression seems warranted, a number of studies clearly suggest that biological mechanisms play a major role in the development of post stroke depression.\n\n\nDespite this evidence, the association of post-stroke depression to specific brain lesions is still vague and needs replication from various independent groups. Furthermore, the cause of post stroke depression at a functional level is not clear.\n\nThe only biological model was proposed by Robinson and co-workers: They hypothesized that the depletion of monoaminergic amines occurring after stroke play a role in post stroke-depression. They point out that norepinephrinergic and serotonergic nuclei send projections to the frontal cortex and arc posteriorly, running through the deep layers of the cortex, where they arborize and send terminal projections into the superficial cortical layers. These norepinephrinergic and serotoninergic pathways are disrupted in basal ganglia and frontal lobe lesions – sites that are shown to be associated with post stroke depression.\n\nHowever, this model is far from being universally accepted and there are serious objections both to their model and findings showing the association between post-stroke depression and lesion sites.\n\nDepression-like behaviors are demonstrated in a mouse model of cortical intracerebral hemorrhage.\n\n"}

There has been significant debate over the ethicality and legality of the procedure, and on the legal rights of the child and surviving parent if the gametes are used for impregnation.\n\nCases of post-mortem conception have occurred ever since human artificial insemination techniques were first developed, with sperm donated to a sperm bank being used following the death of the donor. While religious arguments have been brought against the process even under these circumstances, far more censure has arisen from a number of quarters with regards to invasive retrieval from fresh cadavers or patients either on life support or in a persistent vegetative state, particularly when the procedure is carried out without explicit consent from the donor.\n\nThe first successful retrieval of sperm from a cadaver was reported in 1980, in a case involving a 30-year-old man who became brain dead following a motor vehicle accident and whose family requested sperm preservation. The first successful conception using sperm retrieved post-mortem was reported in 1998, leading to a successful birth the following year. Since 1980, a number of requests for the procedure have been made, with around one third approved and performed. Gametes have been extracted through a variety of means, including removal of the epididymis, irrigation or aspiration of the vas deferens, and rectal probe electroejaculation. Since the procedure is rarely performed, studies on the efficacy of the various methods have been fairly limited in scope. \n\nWhile medical literature recommends that extraction take place no later than 24 hours after death, motile sperm has been successfully obtained as late as 36 hours after death, generally regardless of the cause of death or method of extraction. Up to this limit, the procedure has a high success rate, with sperm retrieved in nearly 100% of cases, and motile sperm in 80–90%. There is currently little precedent for successful insemination using sperm harvested after 36 hours. New technologies are being researched that could make this a routine reality, in turn creating new ethical dilemmas.\n\nIf the sperm is viable, fertilisation is generally achieved through intracytoplasmic sperm injection, a form of \"in vitro\" fertilisation. The success rate of \"in vitro\" fertilisation remains unchanged regardless of whether the sperm was retrieved from a living or dead donor.\n\nThe legality of posthumous sperm extraction varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Generally, legislation falls into one of three camps: a full ban, a requirement of written consent from the donor, or implied consent obtained from the family.\n\nFollowing the 1984 Parpalaix case in France, in which the widow of deceased cancer patient Alain Parpalaix obtained permission from the courts to be inseminated with her husband's spermatozoa after his death, the Centre d’Etude et de Conservation du Sperme Humain (Center for the Study and Preservation of Human Sperm) petitioned the courts successfully for a full ban on posthumous insemination, in line with the country's ban on \"in vitro\" fertilisation for post-menopausal women.\n\nSimilar legislation exists in Germany, Sweden, Canada and the Australian states of Victoria, Western Australia and Taiwan.\n\nGuidelines outlining the legal use of posthumously extracted gametes in the United Kingdom were laid out in the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990. The Act dictates that explicit written consent by the donor must be provided to the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority in order for extraction and fertilisation to take place. Following the 1997 case of \"Regina v. Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority\", the terms of the Act were extended to comatose patients, and so theoretically assault charges could be (but in this case were not) brought against doctors for overseeing or performing the procedure.\n\nThere are few other jurisdictions that fall into this category. New York senator Roy M. Goodman proposed a bill in 1997 requiring written consent by the donor in 1998, but it was never passed into law.\n\nIn 2003, Israeli Attorney General Elyakim Rubinstein published several guidelines outlining the legal situation of posthumous sperm retrieval for the purpose of later insemination by a surviving female partner. The guidelines specified firstly that only requests by a partner (married or otherwise) of the deceased would be honoured – requests by other members of the donor's family would be flatly denied. While extraction of the sperm was guaranteed following a request by the partner, permission to use the sperm was to be determined case by case, a court of law deciding on the basis of the effect on the presumed wishes of the donor, and the effect of the procedure on the donor's dignity. If it could be demonstrated that the deceased took definite steps towards parenthood (implied consent), use of extracted sperm by the female partner would generally be permitted.\n\nMany other countries, including Belgium and the United States, have no specific legislation regarding the rights of men on gamete donation following their death, leaving the decision in the hands of individual clinics and hospitals. As such, many medical institutions in such countries institute in-house policies regarding circumstances in which the procedure would be performed.\n\nThere are several ethical issues surrounding the extraction and use of gametes from cadavers or patients in a persistent vegetative state. The most debated are those concerning religion, consent, and the rights of the surviving partner and child if the procedure results in a birth.\n\nA number of major religions view posthumous sperm retrieval in a negative light, including Roman Catholicism and Judaism. Roman Catholicism proscribes the procedure on much the same grounds as \"in vitro\" fertilisation, namely the rights of the unborn. Judaic strictures are based on the halakhic prohibition on deriving personal benefit from a corpse, and in the case of those in a persistent vegetative state, their categorisation as \"gosses\" (dying person) prohibits anyone from touching or moving them for anything that does not relate to their immediate care.\n\nConsent of the donor is a further ethical barrier. Even in jurisdictions where implicit consent is not required, there are occasions in which clinicians have refused to perform the procedure on these grounds. If no proof of consent by the donor can be produced, implied consent, often in the form of prior actions, must be evident for clinicians to proceed with the extraction. Sperm retrieval is rarely carried out if there is evidence that the deceased clearly objected to the procedure prior to his death.\n\nFinally, if the procedure is performed and results in a birth, there are several issues involving the legal rights of the child and its mother. Because posthumous insemination can take place months or even years after the father's death, it can in some cases be difficult to prove the paternity of the child. As such, inheritance and even the legal rights of the child to marry (due to the possibility of consanguinity between partners) can be affected. For this reason, several countries, including Israel and the United Kingdom, impose a maximum term for the use of extracted sperm, after which the father will not be legally recognised on the child's birth certificate.\n\n"}

{"id": "42018105", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=42018105", "title": "Rerikhism", "text": "Rerikhism\n\nRerikhism or Roerichism (Russian: Рерихи́зм, Рерихиа́нство, Ре́риховское движе́ние) is a spiritual and cultural movement centered on the teachings transmitted by Helena and Nicholas Roerich. It draws ideas from Theosophy, Eastern and Western religions, and Vedic and Buddhist traditions, molding them into the Russian culture and Russian cosmism.\n\nHelena Roerich (1879–1955) was a Russian theosophist, writer, and public figure. In the 20th century, she created, in cooperation with the Teachers of the East (Masters of the Ancient Wisdom), a philosophic teaching of \"Living Ethics\" (Agni Yoga).\n\nHelena was born in the family of , a well-known Saint-Petersburg architect. Helena's mother, belonged to an ancient family, which originated from Novgorod at the end of the 13th century. Significant members of this family included knyaz Mikhail Kutuzov, field marshal of the Russian Empire; Arseny Golenishchev-Kutuzov, poet of the end of 19th century; Ilya Golenishchev-Kutuzov, philologist, poet; and Modest Mussorgsky, well-known composer. It was a nobiliary family distinguished not only for its nobility but for its cultural traditions too. Helena was in frequent communication with the artists and scientists of the era, such as Vladimir Bekhterev, Alexander Blok, Sergei Diaghilev, Arkhip Kuindzhi, Vladimir Solovyov, Vladimir Stasov, Igor Stravinsky, and Mikhail Vrubel.\n\nIn 1901 Helena married Nicholas Roerich. Since that time they were inseparable on life and spiritual-creative paths. She became his companion-in-arms in all his public and cultural undertakings. The Agni Yoga Society was founded by Nicholas and Helena in 1920 in the United States. It is a non-profit educational institution incorporated under the laws of the State of New York. Together with her husband she participated in the heroical transhimalayan expedition (1924–1928). After the Roerich family settled in Kullu Valley in Himalayas there was established the Himalayan Institute of the Scientific Studies and its honorary president — the foundress was Helena Roerich. \nThe years of life in India were the time of the most intensive work of Helena. Here she completed a major part of books of Agni Yoga series. There were published 14 volumes of that series. On title pages of the volumes there is no name of the author since Helena Roerich considered that the sacred wisdom stated there can not be the author's property. She considered herself an author of three books only. They were published under different pen-names: \"The Foundations of Buddhism\" (1927), \"The Cryptograms of the East\" (1929), \"The Banner of the Reverent Sergius\" (1934). Besides, she maintained very active correspondence with many people from Europe, Asia and America. Two volumes of her letters (\"Letters of Helena Roerich\") were published in Riga in 1940. Helena also did the translations. She translated into Russian the extracts from the book \"The Mahatma Letters to A.P. Sinnett\" (\"The Chalice of the East\") and also two volumes of \"The Secret Doctrine\" by Helena Blavatsky.\n\nNicholas Roerich (1874–1947) was a Russian painter, writer, archaeologist, theosophist, philosopher, public figure. He is perceived by some people as a spiritual teacher and guru.\n\nHe studied at the Karl May School, at the Imperial Academy of Arts, and at St. Petersburg University from 1893–1898, simultaneously at the Law University as well. He wrote,\"From 1890s, I saw accurate symbolisms of their people's morals shown in the main directions of philosophy, cultural memorials, monuments, literature and religions from ancient India, China, Tibet and Mongolian culture.\" For 42 years Roerich lived in Russia, in India for 20 years, US for 3 years, Finland for 2 years, France for 1 year, England for 1 year, China for 2 years, Tibet for half a year and Mongolia for 7–8 months. Roerich twice toured through Central and Eastern Asia, in 1924 and 1934, and following his travels in Mongolia's Gobi and Altai Mountains and the Himalayan Mountains, wrote the books \"Heart of Asia\" and \"Altai-Himalaya\". An important roles for humankind to coexist peacefully, together with well-known international figures (Einstein, Tagore), initiated the Roerich Pact during World War II for the purpose of protecting world cultural values. Roerich's paintings, so attractive with their combinations of colours, amazing symbols, and secrets, depict hidden ideas and deep meanings. Roerich, knowing the Buddha legend, well toured through the Indian and Tibetan mountains looking for legendary Shambhala. The Roerichs are also famous for introducing Shambhala in Buddhist teachings in western countries.\n\nJawaharlal Nehru's tribute to Roerich,\n\nNicholas and Helena had two children. In August 1902 their eldest son, George, was born in Okulovka, Novgorod Oblast. After finishing his studies at Karl May School, he entered the Indian and Iranian department of Oriental Languages at London University in 1918. Under Indologist Professor Edward Denison Ross he studied Sanskrit and Pali. Later he became a world-renowned scientist, orientalist, and guru. George is known for his contributions to Tibetan dialectology, his monumental translation of the \"Blue Annals\", and his 11-volume Tibetan-Russian-English dictionary with Sanskrit parallels. After spending almost 30 years in India George returned in 1957 to Russia. His return and acquisition of Soviet citizenship was courageous as the USSR's opinion of his family was rather distorted. Because of his effort, bans were lifted on everything associated with the Rerikhism and the legacy of research left by the family was preserved. The first of Nicholas Roerich's exhibitions was organized in Moscow in 1958, then spread to Leningrad, Riga, Kiev, Tbilisi, and other cities. He was able to dispel myths about the family's philosophy of Agni Yoga and start a cultural movement using this philosophy to spread Living Ethics in the USSR. George died on 21 May 1960, and his ashes were placed in Moscow, at the Novodevichy Cemetery. Svetoslav Roerich is the author of the memorial to this outstanding Russian scientist.\n\nTheir younger son, Svetoslav, was born on 23 October 1904, in St.Petersburg. In 1914-1916 he studied at the Karl May School. Since 1920 he lived in the United States. Svetoslav entered the Columbia University, the department of architecture which he graduated with a bachelor's degree. Since 1923 he was a director of the International Centre of Art \"Corona Mundi\" in New York which was founded by Nicholas Roerich. In 1928 Svetoslav moved from USA to India (Darjiling) to his family. Studying the culture, art and philosophy of India he created many wonderful paintings. Together with landscapes he painted many portraits. The portraits of Nicholas Roerich, Jawaharlal Nehru and Devika Rani - Svetoslav's wife, must be specially marked. One of the most beautiful ones is a portrait of his mother Helena Roerich, the woman of exceptional spiritual and physical beauty. Svetoslav headed the department of folk art and pharmacopoeia at the Institute of Himalayan Studies \"Urusvati\". In 1989 up to the initiative of Svetoslav in the USSR was established the Soviet Foundation of the Roerichs at the base of which there were studies and spreading of the ideas of Agni Yoga. In 1991 he granted the Foundation with the archives of his parents and his eldest brother which were kept in India before. On 30 January 1993, Svetoslav passed away in Bangalore.\n\nAgni Yoga is a religious doctrine transmitted by the Helena and Nicholas Roerichs from 1920. The followers of Agni Yoga believe that the teaching was given to the Roerich family and their associates by Master Morya, the guru of Helena Roerich and Helena Blavatsky, a founder of the Theosophical Society. In the sixteen volumes of the Teaching of Living Ethics that have been translated into English from the original Russian, as well as in the letters of Helena Roerich, the Agni Yoga teaching is also referred to as the Teaching of Living Ethics, the Teaching of Life, the Teaching of Light, or simply as the Teaching.\n\nBeing based on the ancient knowledge of the East and the achievements of modern science in the West, Agni Yoga concerns peculiarities of cosmic evolution of humanity and creates a new system of its perception. The Teaching pays particular attention to the Cosmic Laws that determine the motion of planets and growth of natural structures, birth of stars, and also human behavior and the development of Universe. The authors of the Teaching state that these Laws influence the historic and social processes in human life and unless the humanity realizes this the life can't be improved. According to Agni Yoga, Universe is the immense spiritual-energy system in which a man plays the most important role. The moral perfection, strict observance of ethical laws and comprehension of key factor of Culture in the development of human society are basic principles of spiritual and historical development of humanity. It's impossible to build the better future without respecting knowledge and Culture.\n\nA man, according to the Teaching, influences the Cosmic processes greatly. Particular attention is paid to the consciousness of a man and the culture of thinking, as thought is energy, capable of filling space and effecting its surroundings. A man is directly responsible for the quality of his thoughts, words, and deeds, because not only his spiritual and physical health depend on them, but also the condition of the entire planet. Calling people to live in accordance with Cosmic Laws, the Agni Yoga opens unlimited possibilities for the spiritual transformation of life, the expansion of consciousness, and the acquirement of high moral standards.\n\nThe Agni Yoga Society was founded in 1920 by Helena and Nicholas Roerich. It is a non-profit educational institution incorporated in 1946 under the laws of the State of New York, and is supported entirely by voluntary contributions and membership dues. The aims of the Society are embodied in the philosophy that gives it its name—Agni Yoga—as contained in the books of the Agni Yoga Series published by the Society. In them is found a synthesis of ancient Eastern beliefs and modern Western thought and a bridge between the spiritual and the scientific. Unlike previous yogas, Agni Yoga is a path not of physical disciplines, meditation, or asceticism—but of practice in daily life. It is the yoga of fiery energy, of consciousness, of responsible, directed thought. It teaches that the evolution of the planetary consciousness is a pressing necessity and that, through individual striving, it is an attainable aspiration for mankind. It affirms the existence of the Hierarchy of Light and the center of the Heart as the link with the Hierarchy and with the far-off worlds. Though not systematized in an ordinary sense, Agni Yoga is a Teaching that helps the discerning student to discover moral and spiritual guide-posts by which to learn to govern his or her life and thus contribute to the common good. For this reason Agni Yoga has been called a \"living ethic.\" Speaking about the individual's role in human spiritual evolution, Helena Roerich wrote, \"The greatest benefit that we can contribute consists in the broadening of consciousness, and the improvement and enrichment of our thinking, which, together with the purification of the heart, strengthens our emanations. And thus, raising our vibrations, we restore the health of all that surrounds us.\"\n\nThe Master Institute of United Arts came into being in 1920 as the Master School of United Arts. It struggled to survive until, in 1922, Louis Horch financed its transfer from a single-room, all-in-one studio at 314 West 54th Street to a mansion he bought on the site where the Master Building would later be constructed. Originally built to house a museum for Nicholas Roerich, a school, an auditorium and a restaurant in a residential hotel, the building was designed by Helmle, Corbett & Harrison and Sugarman & Berger. They were attracted to the spiritual quest in which the Roeriches were engaged and participated in sessions during which Helena Roerich would receive instructions from Mahātmā Morya and Nicholas Roerich would record them on scrolls of paper that were later transcribed into a series of texts, the \"Leaves of Morya's Garden\", which follows, appears to encourage the construction of a building, such as the Master Building, as an educational center for spiritual enlightenment. The Master Institute aimed to give students a well-rounded education in the arts and also to \"open the gates to spiritual enlightenment\" through culture.\n\nThe mansion where it was located also housed the Nicholas Roerich Museum, containing many of the thousands of paintings Roerich had created, and Corona Mundi, which arranged for exhibitions of paintings by Roerich and international artists. The Nicholas Roerich Museum in New York City is dedicated to the works of Nicholas Roerich, whose work focused on nature scenes from the Himalayas. The museum is located in a brownstone at 319 West 107th Street on Manhattan's Upper West Side. The museum was originally located in the Master Apartments at 103rd Street and Riverside Drive, which were built especially for Roerich in 1929. Currently, the museum includes between 100 and 200 of Roerich's works as well as a collection of archival materials. The Nicholas Roerich Museum in New York is the largest center of Roerich-related activity outside of Russia.\n\nThe Roerich Pact and Banner of Peace movement grew rapidly during the early nineteen-thirties, with centers in a number of countries. There were three international conferences, in Bruges, Belgium, in Montevideo, Uruguay, and in Washington, D.C. The Pact itself declared the necessity for protection of the cultural product and activity of the world—both during war and peace—and prescribed the method by which all sites of cultural value would be declared neutral and protected, just as the Red Cross does with hospitals. Indeed, the Roerich Pact was often called The Red Cross of Culture:\n\nIdeas of Roerich Pact still are not implemented in the international law, especially its principle of the almost unlimited preference of the preservation of cultural values to the military necessity.\n\nThe American Russian Cultural Association (Russian: \"Америка́но–ру́сская культу́рная ассоциа́ция\") was organized in the USA in 1942 to encourage cultural ties between the Soviet Union and the United States, with Nicholas Roerich as honorary president. The group's first annual report was issued the following year. The group does not appear to have lasted much past Nicholas Roerich's death in 1947.\n\nInternational Center of the Roerichs (Russian: \"Междунаро́дный це́нтр Ре́рихов\") is a non-governmental public association of citizens and public associations incorporated on the basis of their common interests in the cause of study, preservation, and popularization of the Roerich family heritage. The Center is an associated member of the Non-Governmental Organizations Association under the United Nations Department of Public Information.\n\nMuseum named after Nicholas Roerich (Russian: \"Музе́й и́мени Н. К. Ре́риха Междунаро́дного це́нтра Ре́рихов\") contents comprises the Roerichs' cultural heritage passed on to the Soviet Roerichs' Foundation (now International Center of the Roerichs) by Svetoslav Roerich in 1990. It carries in itself a new cosmic world view for which new interest grows more each year. The core of the Rerikhism is the philosophy of cosmic reality – the Agni Yoga, which develops the idea of a close relationship between man and Cosmos, contains knowledge which assists in understanding the specific features peculiar to the new evolutionary stage of mankind's development.\n\nThe Teaching of Life, which contains a new, cosmic worldview, has played and continues to play an enormous role in\npaving the way for the spiritual evolution. The Roerich movement, like any social movement in the process of formation, has its difficulties and problems. Some international and regional organizations, whose activity is based on the ideas of Rerikhism, arose many years later after the death of all members of the Roerich family.\n\nThis organization was founded in the year 1994. Victor Skumin was elected to the post of the President-founder of the World Organisation of Culture of Health — International social movement \"To Health via Culture\" (Russian: Междунаро́дное обще́ственное Движе́ние «К Здоро́вью че́рез Культу́ру»). The organization operates in accordance with the registered in Ministry of Justice of the Russian Federation Charter. Key element of a \"Culture of Health\" is implement innovative health programs that support a holistic approach to physical, mental and spiritual well-being both inside and outside the workplace.\nIn the Russian Orthodox Church the social activities of this international organization qualifies as an ideology of the Agni Yoga and New Age (NA),\n\nThe relationship between the Skumin's doctrine of culture of health and Rerikhism is also confirmed by some scientists, such as Goraschuk V. P., Professor of H.S. Skovoroda Kharkiv National Pedagogical University. In 2004, he wrote in his thesis for a Doctor's degree on speciality \"general pedagogics and history of pedagogics\",\n\nThe anthem of WOCH (\"To Health via Culture\") consists of four stanzas. The capital letters each of the four stanzas form the word Agni. ().\nAnother hymn by Skumin is termed \"Urusvati\". Helena Roerich, known as the \"Tara Urusvati\" in Agni Yoga and Rerikhism. The hymn begins with the phrase, \"The fire of the heart ignites Urusvati, she teaches the spirit take-off on the wings of the grace\".\n\nSkumin elaborated on the conceptions of spiritual evolution and proposed (1990) a classification of Homo spiritalis (Latin: \"spiritual man\"), the sixth root race, consisting of eight sub-races (subspecies) – HS0 Anabiosis spiritalis, HS1 Scientella spiritalis, HS2 Aurora spiritalis, HS3 Ascensus spiritalis, HS4 Vocatus spiritalis, HS5 Illuminatio spiritalis, НS6 Creatio spiritalis, and HS7 Servitus spiritalis.\n\nThe \"Journal of the World Organisation of Culture of Health (″World Health Culture Organization″)\" is based in Novocheboksarsk. In 1995, Victor Skumin became the first editor-in-chief of the journal \"To Health via Culture\". The journal received an International Standard Serial Number (ISSN) 0204-3440. The main topics of the magazine are the dissemination of ideas of culture of health, holistic medicine, Rerikhism, and Agni Yoga.\n\nThe Organization also has its own publishing house (\"To Health via Culture\"), who has the right to publish the books with the International Standard Book Number (ISBN).\n\n\n\n"}

She studied at Renuka Swaroop Memorial high school in Pune.\n\nHer first tryst with the camera was in the early 1970s as a television newsreader on the newly transmitting Mumbai Doordarshan, the Indian government run broadcaster.\n\nSmita Patil belongs to a generation of actresses, including Shabana Azmi and, like her, who are strongly associated with the radically political cinema of the 1970s. Her work includes films with parallel cinema directors like Shyam Benegal, Govind Nihalani, Satyajit Ray (\"Sadgati\", 1981), G. Aravindan (\"Chidambaram\", 1985) and Mrinal Sen as well as forays into the more commercial Hindi film industry cinema of Mumbai. Patil was working as a TV news reader and was also an accomplished photographer when Shyam Benegal discovered her.\n\nShe was an alumna of the Film and Television Institute of India, Pune. In 1977, she won the National Film Award for Best Actress for her performance in the Hindi film \"Bhumika\". In her films, Patil's character often represents an intelligent femininity that stands in relief against the conventional background of male-dominated cinema (films like \"Bhumika\", \"Umbartha\" and \"Bazaar\"). Smita Patil was a women's rights activist and became famous for her roles in films that portrayed women as capable and empowered.\n\nIn time she was accepted by commercial filmmakers and from Raj Khosla and Ramesh Sippy to B.R. Chopra, they all agreed that she was \"excellent.\" Her fans, too, grew with her new-found stardom. Patil's glamorous roles in her more commercial films — such as \"Shakti\" and \"Namak Halaal\" — revealed the permeable boundaries between \"serious\" cinema and \"Hindi cinema\" masala in the Hindi film industry. In 1984, she served as a jury member of the Montreal World Film Festival.\n\nDirector C. V. Sridhar was the first one to pair her opposite Rajesh Khanna in \"Dil-E-Nadan\" in 1982. After success of this film, Smita and Khanna were paired in successful films like \"Aakhir Kyon?\", \"Anokha Rishta\", \"Angaarey\", \"Nazrana\", \"Amrit\". The songs \"Dushman Na Kare Dost Ne Woh\" and \"Ek Andhera Lakh Sitare\" from the J.P. Omprakash directorial venture \"Aakhir Kyun\" became popular. With the release of \"Aakhir Kyon?\" her popularity and her pairing with Khanna were at its peak. The film \"Nazrana\", also co-starring Sridevi released posthumously after her death and became box office success with the film being among the top 10 highest-grossing films of the year 1987. Each of her films with Khanna were different and spoke about various social issues. In the film \"Awam\", Smita was paired opposite Raj Babbar in supporting role whereas Khanna was in the lead role. In the year 1987, \"Amrit\" directed by Mohan Kumar became fifth highest-grossing film of the year. Her performance along-with that of Khanna were critically acclaimed in case of the films \"Anokha Rishta\", \"Amrit\", \"Aakhir Kyon?\".\n\nHer association with artistic cinema remained strong, however. Her arguably greatest (and unfortunately final) role came when Smita re-teamed with Ketan Mehta to play the feisty and fiery Sonbai in \"Mirch Masala\" (1987). Smita won raves for playing a spirited spice-factory worker who stands up against a lecherous petty official.\nOn the centenary of Indian cinema in April 2013, \"Forbes\" included her performance in the film on its list, \"25 Greatest Acting Performances of Indian Cinema\".\n\nDuring the making of \"Chakra\", Smita Patil used to visit the slums in Bombay. It culminated in another National Award.\n\nWhen she became romantically involved with actor Raj Babbar, Patil drew severe criticism from her fans and the media, clouding her personal life and throwing her into the eye of a media storm. Raj Babbar left his wife Nadira Babbar to marry Patil.\n\nSmita died from childbirth complications on 13 December 1986, age 31, barely two weeks after having given birth to her son, Prateik Babbar.\n\nNearly two decades later, one of India's greatest film directors, Mrinal Sen alleged that Smita Patil had died due to gross medical negligence.\n\nIn 2011, Rediff.com listed her as the second-greatest actress of all time, behind Nargis. According to Suresh Kohli from \"Deccan Herald\", \"Smita Patil was, perhaps, the most accomplished actress of Hindi cinema. Her oeuvre is outstanding, investing almost every portrayal with a powerhouse realistic performance.\"\nIn 2012, the Smita Patil Documentary and Short Film Festival was initiated in her honor.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "49233423", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=49233423", "title": "Ulysses syndrome", "text": "Ulysses syndrome\n\nUlysses syndrome (Immigrant Syndrome of Chronic and Multiple Stress) is an atypical set of depressive, anxious, dissociative, and somatoform symptoms that results from being exposed to extreme levels of stress unique to the process of modern migration. Rather than a mental disorder, this syndrome is a natural reaction to toxic levels of stress seen in migrants who are otherwise in normal mental health.\n\nThe syndrome is named after the ancient Greek hero, Odysseus (Ulysses in Latin), who suffered involuntary migration and travelled for 10 years through the Mediterranean to come back home from the decade-long Trojan War. The hardships of his journey are compared to the ones of contemporary migrants, who must struggle with intensely stressful, novel situations in isolation and with little help. Scarcity of their resources makes it impossible to cope with and successfully adapt to the unfamiliar environment of the receiving country, which in turn leads to experiencing a range of detrimental symptoms.\n\nDr. Joseba Achotegui coined the term \"Ulysses Syndrome\" in 2002.\n\nSymptoms of Ulysses syndrome include migraines, insomnia, recurrent worrying, tension, nervousness, irritability, disorientation, fear, fatigue, sadness, gastric pain, bone pain, low self-esteem, increased tobacco and alcohol consumption, and decreased productivity. A lack of social support or access to appropriate medical care may aggravate these symptoms. In some occasions, patients with Ulysses syndrome are mistakenly diagnosed with another medical condition which can further impede recovery.\n\nMigration in the 21st century has occurred in the context of unprecedented volatility, conflict, and suffering. There are currently more forcibly displaced individuals in the world than at any other time in history, including 22.5 million refugees, 40.3 million internally displaced peoples, and 2.8 million asylum-seekers in 2016. Forced migration has profound impacts on individuals and families as their lives change suddenly and dramatically. Experiences of modern migrants include the separation of families, dissolution of communities by conflict and disaster, exposure to exploitation, and violence. Migrants remain in prolonged periods of displacement with a median time of 4 years in exile.\n\nMigrants often face multiple forms of uniquely intense stressors, such as the death of loved ones, lack of jobs and social support, difficulties in the migratory process, and loss of status and identity. Because many migrants lack access to healthcare in the receiving country, they are often unable to receive appropriate care and continually re-experience the mental trauma of these losses. The cumulative effect may create stress levels so intense that they exceed individuals' adaptive capacities and lead to a failure of the acculturation process. This aggravates other symptoms, including depression, anxiety, headaches, and pain.\n\nExtreme stressors that put individuals at risk for Ulysses syndrome, called \"Ulysses stressors\", can broadly be characterized into four categories:\nMiddle-aged and elderly adults are typically more strongly affected than younger people are because they experience a larger loss of status and social mobility, have fewer encounters with people outside of the community through school or work, and are less likely to be exposed to the receiving country's mainstream culture. Moreover, older immigrants typically have greater difficulty learning the receiving country's language, which may substantially impair their ability to understand and interact with the new culture.\n\nUlysses syndrome is not a mental disorder, but rather a normal stress response by a healthy individual to an extreme situation that overwhelms the normal psychological mechanisms for coping. By definition, this syndrome cannot be diagnosed if another mental disorder is present. There is currently no DSM-5 criteria for this syndrome.\n\nAlthough often falsely recognized as acute stress disorder, depression, adjustment disorder, or other mental disorders, Ulysses syndrome differs from these pathologies in important ways:\nAlthough clinically distinct from mental health disorders, Ulysses syndrome exists on a spectrum between normal and disease. It can be understood as the extreme limit of normal mental functioning that can still be considered non-pathological. However, an individual with Ulysses syndrome is at greater risk of disease and indeed, at a certain point the stressors may become too intense such that a true clinical mental disorder such as depression or PTSD can develop.\n\nBecause Ulysses syndrome is a stress response rather than a mental disorder, the natural response for an individual is to return to his or her normal state of health once the stressors are eliminated. Dr. Achotegui, who first described Ulysses Syndrome, makes the analogy to a stalk of bamboo that bends in the wind. Just like bamboo will bend but not break, those who are exposed to Ulysses stressors are brought to the brink of mental instability and are made more vulnerable to mental disorders, but do not have a disorder yet. When the wind subsides, the bamboo will spring back to its normal state, just as those who face these stressors will return to their normal selves if and when the stressors resolve.\n\nPreventive measures that may help reduce Ulysses syndrome generally revolve around building mental resilience, such as finding closure after losing loved ones, embracing changes in identity as an opportunity for growth, talking with others who have undergone similar experiences, re-evaluating expectations to be more realistic, and learning to live in the present rather than dwell too deeply in nostalgia.\n\nOne proposed therapy leverages the ability of community health workers CHWs) to connect with hard to reach populations such as displaced migrants. CHWs better understand the local culture and traditions and may, with the appropriate training, be able to engage affected individuals more effectively. For instance, CHWs can often better advocate for migrant rights and connect migrant populations to the resources necessary to facilitate integration and build community, all of which helps reduce the extreme stressors that lead to Ulysses syndrome.\n\nThe term \"Ulysses Syndrome\" has alternatively been used to refer to the psychological and physical sequelae of misdiagnosis due to a false positive result. For instance, a patient who complains of low risk chest pain may be referred for further cardiac work-up by an overcautious physician. These tests in turn may give a positive result due to high sensitivity, which subjects the patient to further testing that ultimately proves to be unnecessary. Victims of this condition experience the stress of being diagnosed with a condition they do not have as well as the physical trauma of invasive testing.\n\nThere is currently no consensus on the definitive use of the term “Ulysses syndrome”. Nevertheless, Ulysses syndrome as it is used to describe the effects of chronic extreme stress in migrant populations is more in line with the definition of a syndrome as used in the medical field, i.e. a set of signs and symptoms that constitute a disease. Moreover, because migrants who experience chronic stress and fear are frequently incorrectly diagnosed with depression or anxiety, it encapsulates the alternative definition of this condition.\n\n"}

Bibb County, Alabama, and Bibb County, Georgia, are named for him.\n\nHe was a member of the Democratic-Republican political party. Bibb served as governor of the Alabama Territory from August 1817 to December 1819, and as the first elected governor of the state of Alabama from December 1819 to his death on July 10, 1820.\n\nWilliam Wyatt Bibb was born on October 2, 1781, in Amelia County, Virginia to Captain William Bibb, an officer in the Continental Army during the American Revolutionary War (1775-1783) and a member of the state legislature, the General Assembly of the newly independent Commonwealth of Virginia, and his wife Sally Wyatt Bibb. Around 1784, Bibb senior moved with his family south to Georgia with a large number of Virginians who accompanied General George Mathews, hero of the Battle of Brandywine in Pennsylvania. Most of the general's followers were veterans like himself, who with their families took advantage of the new nation's offer of land bounties for former soldiers. They established tobacco farms on the rich lands around the confluence of the Broad and Savannah Rivers in newly developing northeastern Georgia. The Bibbs are recorded as one of the earliest pioneer families in Elbert County. After having attended the College of William and Mary in Williamsburg, Virginia and the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine in Philadelphia, he was awarded an Doctor of Medicine (M.D.) degree in 1801. He returned to Georgia and began practicing medicine in Petersburg there. In 1803, he married Mary Freeman.\n\nBibb's first office was as a member of the Georgia House of Representatives. Elected in 1802, at the age of 21, he took office in 1803 and served one term until 1805. He was elected as a Democratic-Republican to the Ninth United States Congress to fill a vacancy caused by the resignation of Thomas Spalding, and was reelected four times, serving until November 6, 1813. He was then elected by the state legislature, to the United States Senate to fill a vacancy created by the resignation of the nationally known and presidential candidate William H. Crawford and served until November 9, 1816.\n\nFifth President James Monroe, (1758–1831, served 1817–1825), appointed Bibb as the first governor of the newly formed Alabama Territory (out of the larger previous Mississippi Territory in 1817. Alabama became the 22nd state on December 14, 1819. Bibb was elected governor, defeating Marmaduke Williams. Bibb received 8,342 votes, while Williams received 7,140 votes.\n\nBibb's primary duties were establishing the state government. Huntsville was designated to be the site of the constitutional convention. The capital was chosen to be the newly created town of Cahawba in 1820 on the Alabama frontier, it then moved to Tuscaloosa in 1826, and finally to the central city of Montgomery in 1846, where a State Capitol building was later begun (later the site of the historic inauguration in 1861 of Jefferson Davis of Mississippi as the first provisional and only President of the Confederate States of America after the first seven of thirteen southern states seceded, with Montgomery as the temporary Southern National Capital. Later several famous Civil Rights Movement marches and protests were held here in the 1950s and 60's).\n\nDuring Bibb's tenure, the Alabama state militia, (now Georgia National Guard) and the beginnings of the state judicial system with the organization and appointments to the Supreme Court of Alabama were accomplished.\n\nHenry Hitchcock was elected the first Attorney General of Alabama and initially held the position of Secretary of State of Alabama as well. However, shortly afterward Thomas A. Rodgers was elected as the second Secretary of State of Alabama. The first session of the state legislature was held from October 25, 1819, to December 17, 1819. William R. King and John W. Walker were chosen as the first U.S. Senators.\n\nBibb remains one of only two individuals who served as governor of a state and a U.S. senator from a different state. The other is Sam Houston, who (among his other political offices) served as the sixth governor of Tennessee and a U.S. senator from Texas. Mitt Romney, who served as the seventieth governor of Massachusetts won the November, 2018 election to serve as U.S. senator from Utah and will become the third such individual if, as scheduled, he takes office in January 2019.\n\nIn 1820, Bibb was thrown from his horse during a violent thunderstorm. He died from internal injuries on July 10, 1820 at the age of 38. His brother, Thomas Bibb, was president of the state senate at the time and completed the rest of his term. Bibb is buried in Coosada, Alabama. As first governor his likeness appears on the Alabama centennial half dollar, which was minted in 1921.\n\n\n\n"}

Periodically described as an Appalachian folk tale, other times as a moral figure, and sometimes a voodoo spirit of malevolence, the Woman in Black was reported in different cities and regions throughout the south and west. At the same time, one appearance was reported by reputable people in Alma, Nebraska.\n\nThere is an account of a Woman in Black that was seen in Kingsport, Tennessee in November 1927. She appeared to Lena Mitchell, an African-American woman, was visited several times by this mysterious woman, who left her hypnotized or \"in fits\" afterwards. \"Her woman in black was also African-American, and only appeared to torment her.\" Earlier visits had happened, and voodoo objects had been found under Lena Mitchells' bed, and when removed, the mysterious figure departed. \"Relatives noted that, when it happened before, they found a strange hoodoo object beneath Mitchell’s bed. Once they got rid of it, her symptoms subsided and she returned to normal.\"\nAlthough the police searched the town, no one matching the description was ever found, and the Woman in Black remains a mystery.\n\nA woman in black was encountered by several people in Roanoke, Virginia in 1902. \"She was beautiful, stately and terrifying.\" Here the woman in black would appear suddenly and unexpectedly to men who had stayed to long at the club and insist they go home as quickly as possible. Sometimes the woman in black would knock the man down to the ground or \"slap him to the earth with a swish of her phantom garments\".\nThe woman was always described as beautiful, about 5'10\" in height, with large eyes and heavy lashes. She wore a black dress that almost touched the ground, and a raglan coat that covered a slender frame. On her head she wore a turban, but worn so it would obscure the lower part of her face. Although unknown to them, she would appear next to married men and address them by name. \nSome other towns in the region were also visited by the woman in black, including Bristol, Virginia, Tazewell, Virginia, Lynchburg, Virginia and Richmond, Virginia. One account claims she appeared suddenly to four men of the Disciples of Christ church in Tazewell, Virginia, and scared them so badly they all ran home. \"They took to the middle of the street and burnt the wind\" trying to get away. The moral upshot of her appearance in Roanoke in 1902 had the salutary effect of keeping married men home with their wives and families rather than going out each night.\n\nThree men in Alma, Nebraska claimed to have been spooked by the lady in black on March 16, 1902.
