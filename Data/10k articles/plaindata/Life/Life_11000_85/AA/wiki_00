He was originally a slave of Maslama ibn Mukhallad, a member of the Ansar, who gave him his freedom. Maslama, one of Muhammad's companions, was appointed by the first Umayyad caliph Muawiyah I to the position of governor of Egypt and Ifriqiya. The inclusion of Ifriqiya was nominal, as until then the Arabs had made only temporary raids in that direction without attempting permanent control. \n\nIn 675, Maslama appointed Abu al-Muhajir to the position of amir or general of the Umayyad forces in Ifriqiya. This position was already occupied by Uqba ibn Nafi, a member of the Banu Quraish. Maslama advised Abu al-Muhajir to relieve Uqba of his position with due deference, but it seems that this did not happen. Uqba was shackled and thrown into prison, from which he was only released when the Caliph requested to see him. As Uqba left Ifriqiya for Damascus, he vowed to treat Abu al-Muhajir as he had been treated.\n\nUqba had established a camp at Qayrawan. It is said that Abu al-Muhajir abandoned this (in some accounts, destroyed it) and built another settlement two miles away. According to histories written many centuries later this city was called Tākarwān (). Until then it had been the custom for the amirs of Ifriqiya to return to Egypt between raids, and Abu al-Muhajir is said to be the first amir to stay in Ifriqiya permanently.\n\nWhat Abu al-Muhajir accomplished in the nine or so years of his command are not agreed by the two different versions of the histories. Histories written in the 9th century credit him with advancing no further west than Mila, Algeria, while those written from the eleventh century on have him capturing Tlemcen.\n\nMuawiyah's successor as Caliph, Yazid I, was responsible for restoring Uqba to his previous position. Uqba arrived in Ifriqiya in 682, and immediately fulfilled his vow. Abu al-Muhajir was shackled and forced to accompany Uqba whenever he went on expeditions.\n\nIn 683, Uqba's forces were ambushed by the Berber chief Kusaila near Tehouda - the ancient Roman fort of \"Thabudeos\" - in Algeria. Uqba is said to have offered to unchain Abu al-Muhajir so that he might have a better chance to fight, but Abu al-Muhajir said that he would rather die fighting wearing his chains. Both men were killed in this battle with 300 members of Okba's cavalry . \n\nHe is buried in Sidi Okba in Algeria in the al-Shurafa cemetery with 300 dead of the Battle of Vescera in front of the mosque of Sidi Okba or what is the tomb Uqba ibn Nafi General\n\n\n"}
{"id": "580471", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=580471", "title": "Alexander Belyaev", "text": "Alexander Belyaev\n\nAlexander Romanovich Belyaev (, ; 16 March 1884 – 6 January 1942) was a Soviet Russian writer of science fiction. His works from the 1920s and 1930s made him a highly regarded figure in Russian science fiction, often referred to as \"Russia's Jules Verne\". Belyaev's best known books include \"Professor Dowell's Head\", \"Amphibian Man\", \"Ariel\", and \"The Air Seller\".\n\nAlexander Belyaev was born in Smolensk in the family of an Orthodox priest. His father, after losing two other children (Alexander's sister Nina died at childhood from sarcoma and his brother Vasiliy, a veterinary student, drowned during a boat trip), wanted him to continue the family tradition and enrolled Alexander into Smolensk seminary. Belyaev, on the other hand, didn't feel particularly religious and even became an atheist in seminary. After graduating he didn't take his vows and enrolled into a law school. While he studied law his father died and he had to support his mother and other family by giving lessons and writing for theater.\n\nAfter graduating from the school in 1906 Belyaev became a practicing lawyer and made himself a good reputation. In that period his finances markedly improved, and he traveled around the world extensively as a vacation after each successful case. During that time he continued to write, albeit on small scale. Literature, however, proved increasingly appealing to him, and in 1914 he left law to concentrate on his literary pursuits. However, at the same time, at the age of 30, Alexander became ill with tuberculosis.\n\nTreatment was unsuccessful; the infection spread to his spine and resulted in paralysis of the legs. Belyaev suffered constant pain and was paralysed for six years. His wife left him, not wanting to care for the paralyzed. In search for the right treatment he moved to Yalta together with his mother and old nanny. During his convalescence, he read the work of Jules Verne, H. G. Wells, and Konstantin Tsiolkovsky, and began to write poetry in his hospital bed.\n\nBy 1922 he had overcome the disease and tried to find occupation in Yalta. He served a brief stint as a police inspector, tried other odd jobs such as a librarian, but life remained difficult, and in 1923 he moved to Moscow where he started to practice law again, as a consultant for various Soviet organizations. At the same time Belyaev began his serious literary activity as writer of science fiction novels. In 1925 his first novel, \"Professor Dowell's Head\" (Голова Профессора Доуэля) was published. From 1931 he lived in Leningrad with his wife and oldest daughter; his youngest daughter died of meningitis in 1930, aged six. In Leningrad he met H. G. Wells, who visited the USSR in 1934.\n\nIn the last years of his life Belyaev lived in the Leningrad suburb of Pushkin (formerly Tsarskoye Selo). At the beginning of the German invasion of the Soviet Union during the Second World War he refused to evacuate because he was recovering after an operation that he had undergone a few months earlier.\n\nBelyaev died of starvation in the Soviet town of Pushkin in 1942 while it was occupied by the Nazis. The exact location of his grave is unknown. A memorial stone at the Kazanskoe cemetery in the town of Pushkin is placed on the mass grave where his body is assumed to be buried.\n\nHis wife and daughter managed to survive and got registered as Volksdeutsche (Belyaev's wife's mother was of Swedish descent). Near the end of the war they were taken away to Poland by the Nazis. Due to this, after the war, Soviets treated them as collaborators: they were exiled to Barnaul (Western Siberia) and lived there for 11 years.\n\nAccording to the Soviet copyright law in effect until 1964, Belyaev's works entered the public domain 15 years after his death. In the post-Soviet era, Russia's 1993 copyright law granted copyright protection for 50 years after the author's death. With the adoption of Part IV of the Civil Code of Russia in 2004, copyright protection was extended to 70 years after the author's death, and by an additional 4 years for authors who worked or fought during the Great Patriotic War. And a 2006 law stated that the Civil Code's copyright protections described under articles 1281, 1318, 1327, and 1331 do not apply to works whose 50 year \"p.m.a.\" copyright term expired before the 1993 law came into force. All of this contributed to confusion about whether or not Belyaev's works are protected by copyright, and for how long.\n\nIn 2008, Terra publishing company acquired exclusive rights to print Belyaev's works from his heirs, and proceeded to sue Astrel and AST-Moskva publishing companies (both part of AST) for violating those exclusive rights. The Moscow arbitration court found in favor of Terra, awarding 7.5 billion rubles in damages and barring Astrel from distributing the \"illegally published\" works. An appellate court found that the awarded damages were calculated unjustifiably and dismissed them. On further appeal, a federal arbitration court found that Belyaev's works entered the public domain on 1 January 1993, and could not enjoy copyright protection at all. In 2010, a Krasnodar cassation panel agreed that Belyaev's works are in the public domain. Finally, in 2011 the Supreme Court of Arbitration of Russia found that Belyaev's works are protected by copyright until 1 January 2017 due to his activity during the Great Patriotic War, and remanded the case to lower courts for retrial.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "15247542", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15247542", "title": "Atheism", "text": "Atheism\n\nAtheism is, in the broadest sense, the absence of belief in the existence of deities. Less broadly, atheism is the rejection of belief that any deities exist. In an even narrower sense, atheism is specifically the position that there are no deities. Atheism is contrasted with theism, which, in its most general form, is the belief that at least one deity exists.\n\nThe etymological root for the word \"atheism\" originated before the 5th century BCE from the ancient Greek (\"atheos\"), meaning \"without god(s)\". In antiquity it had multiple uses as a pejorative term applied to those thought to reject the gods worshiped by the larger society, those who were forsaken by the gods or those who had no commitment to belief in the gods. The term denoted a social category created by orthodox religionists into which those who did not share their religious beliefs were placed. The actual term \"atheism\" emerged first in the 16th century. With the spread of freethought, skeptical inquiry, and subsequent increase in criticism of religion, application of the term narrowed in scope. The first individuals to identify themselves using the word \"atheist\" lived in the 18th century during the Age of Enlightenment. The French Revolution, noted for its \"unprecedented atheism,\" witnessed the first major political movement in history to advocate for the supremacy of human reason. The French Revolution can be described as the first period where atheism became implemented politically.\n\nArguments for atheism range from the philosophical to social and historical approaches. Rationales for not believing in deities include arguments that there is a lack of empirical evidence, the problem of evil, the argument from inconsistent revelations, the rejection of concepts that cannot be falsified, and the argument from nonbelief. Nonbelievers contend that atheism is a more parsimonious position than theism and that everyone is born without beliefs in deities; therefore, they argue that the burden of proof lies not on the atheist to disprove the existence of gods but on the theist to provide a rationale for theism. Although some atheists have adopted secular philosophies (e.g. secular humanism), there is no one ideology or set of behaviors to which all atheists adhere.\n\nSince conceptions of atheism vary, accurate estimations of current numbers of atheists are difficult. According to global Win-Gallup International studies, 13% of respondents were \"convinced atheists\" in 2012,<ref name=\"WIN/GIA\"></ref> 11% were \"convinced atheists\" in 2015, and in 2017, 9% were \"convinced atheists\". However, other researchers have advised caution with WIN/Gallup figures since other surveys which have used the same wording for decades and have a bigger sample size have consistently reached lower figures. An older survey by the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) in 2004 recorded atheists as comprising 8% of the world's population. Other older estimates have indicated that atheists comprise 2% of the world's population, while the irreligious add a further 12%. According to these polls, Europe and East Asia are the regions with the highest rates of atheism. In 2015, 61% of people in China reported that they were atheists. The figures for a 2010 Eurobarometer survey in the European Union (EU) reported that 20% of the EU population claimed not to believe in \"any sort of spirit, God or life force\".\n\nWriters disagree on how best to define and classify \"atheism\", contesting what supernatural entities are considered gods, whether it is a philosophic position in its own right or merely the absence of one, and whether it requires a conscious, explicit rejection. Atheism has been regarded as compatible with agnosticism, and has also been contrasted with it. A variety of categories have been used to distinguish the different forms of atheism.\n\nSome of the ambiguity and controversy involved in defining \"atheism\" arises from difficulty in reaching a consensus for the definitions of words like \"deity\" and \"god\". The plurality of wildly different conceptions of God and deities leads to differing ideas regarding atheism's applicability. The ancient Romans accused Christians of being atheists for not worshiping the pagan deities. Gradually, this view fell into disfavor as \"theism\" came to be understood as encompassing belief in any divinity.\n\nWith respect to the range of phenomena being rejected, atheism may counter anything from the existence of a deity, to the existence of any spiritual, supernatural, or transcendental concepts, such as those of Buddhism, Hinduism, Jainism, and Taoism.\n\nDefinitions of atheism also vary in the degree of consideration a person must put to the idea of gods to be considered an atheist. Atheism has sometimes been defined to include the simple absence of belief that any deities exist. This broad definition would include newborns and other people who have not been exposed to theistic ideas. As far back as 1772, Baron d'Holbach said that \"All children are born Atheists; they have no idea of God.\"\nSimilarly, George H. Smith (1979) suggested that: \"The man who is unacquainted with theism is an atheist because he does not believe in a god. This category would also include the child with the conceptual capacity to grasp the issues involved, but who is still unaware of those issues. The fact that this child does not believe in god qualifies him as an atheist.\" \"Implicit atheism\" is \"the absence of theistic belief without a conscious rejection of it\" and \"explicit atheism\" is the conscious rejection of belief.\nFor the purposes of his paper on \"philosophical atheism\", Ernest Nagel contested including mere absence of theistic belief as a type of atheism. Graham Oppy classifies as \"innocents\" those who never considered the question because they lack any understanding of what a god is. According to Oppy, these could be one-month-old babies, humans with severe traumatic brain injuries, or patients with advanced dementia.\n\nPhilosophers such as Antony Flew\nand Michael Martin have contrasted positive (strong/hard) atheism with negative (weak/soft) atheism. Positive atheism is the explicit affirmation that gods do not exist. Negative atheism includes all other forms of non-theism. According to this categorization, anyone who is not a theist is either a negative or a positive atheist.\nThe terms \"weak\" and \"strong\" are relatively recent, while the terms \"negative\" and \"positive\" atheism are of older origin, having been used (in slightly different ways) in the philosophical literature and in Catholic apologetics.\nUnder this demarcation of atheism, most agnostics qualify as negative atheists.\n\nWhile Martin, for example, asserts that agnosticism entails negative atheism, many agnostics see their view as distinct from atheism,\nwhich they may consider no more justified than theism or requiring an equal conviction.\nThe assertion of unattainability of knowledge for or against the existence of gods is sometimes seen as an indication that atheism requires a leap of faith.\nCommon atheist responses to this argument include that unproven \"religious\" propositions deserve as much disbelief as all \"other\" unproven propositions,\nand that the unprovability of a god's existence does not imply equal probability of either possibility.\nAustralian philosopher J. J. C. Smart even argues that \"sometimes a person who is really an atheist may describe herself, even passionately, as an agnostic because of unreasonable generalized philosophical skepticism which would preclude us from saying that we know anything whatever, except perhaps the truths of mathematics and formal logic.\"\nConsequently, some atheist authors such as Richard Dawkins prefer distinguishing theist, agnostic and atheist positions along a spectrum of theistic probability—the likelihood that each assigns to the statement \"God exists\".\n\nBefore the 18th century, the existence of God was so accepted in the western world that even the possibility of true atheism was questioned. This is called \"theistic innatism\"—the notion that all people believe in God from birth; within this view was the connotation that atheists are simply in denial.\n\nThere is also a position claiming that atheists are quick to believe in God in times of crisis, that atheists make deathbed conversions, or that \"there are no atheists in foxholes\".\nThere have however been examples to the contrary, among them examples of literal \"atheists in foxholes\".\n\nSome atheists have doubted the very need for the term \"atheism\". In his book \"Letter to a Christian Nation\", Sam Harris wrote:\nIn fact, \"atheism\" is a term that should not even exist. No one ever needs to identify himself as a \"non-astrologer\" or a \"non-alchemist\". We do not have words for people who doubt that Elvis is still alive or that aliens have traversed the galaxy only to molest ranchers and their cattle. Atheism is nothing more than the noises reasonable people make in the presence of unjustified religious beliefs.\n\nPragmatic atheism is the view one should reject a belief in a god or gods because it is unnecessary for a pragmatic life. This view is related to apatheism and practical atheism.\n\nAtheists have also argued that people cannot know a God or prove the existence of a God. The latter is called agnosticism, which takes a variety of forms. In the philosophy of immanence, divinity is inseparable from the world itself, including a person's mind, and each person's consciousness is locked in the subject. According to this form of agnosticism, this limitation in perspective prevents any objective inference from belief in a god to assertions of its existence. The rationalistic agnosticism of Kant and the Enlightenment only accepts knowledge deduced with human rationality; this form of atheism holds that gods are not discernible as a matter of principle, and therefore cannot be known to exist. Skepticism, based on the ideas of Hume, asserts that certainty about anything is impossible, so one can never know for sure whether or not a god exists. Hume, however, held that such unobservable metaphysical concepts should be rejected as \"sophistry and illusion\". The allocation of agnosticism to atheism is disputed; it can also be regarded as an independent, basic worldview.\n\nOther arguments for atheism that can be classified as epistemological or ontological, including ignosticism, assert the meaninglessness or unintelligibility of basic terms such as \"God\" and statements such as \"God is all-powerful.\" Theological noncognitivism holds that the statement \"God exists\" does not express a proposition, but is nonsensical or cognitively meaningless. It has been argued both ways as to whether such individuals can be classified into some form of atheism or agnosticism. Philosophers A. J. Ayer and Theodore M. Drange reject both categories, stating that both camps accept \"God exists\" as a proposition; they instead place noncognitivism in its own category.\n\nPhilosopher, Zofia Zdybicka writes:\n\nSome atheists hold the view that the various conceptions of gods, such as the personal god of Christianity, are ascribed logically inconsistent qualities. Such atheists present deductive arguments against the existence of God, which assert the incompatibility between certain traits, such as perfection, creator-status, immutability, omniscience, omnipresence, omnipotence, omnibenevolence, transcendence, personhood (a personal being), nonphysicality, justice, and mercy.\n\nTheodicean atheists believe that the world as they experience it cannot be reconciled with the qualities commonly ascribed to God and gods by theologians. They argue that an omniscient, omnipotent, and omnibenevolent God is not compatible with a world where there is evil and suffering, and where divine love is hidden from many people.\nA similar argument is attributed to Siddhartha Gautama, the founder of Buddhism.\n\nPhilosopher Ludwig Feuerbach\nand psychoanalyst Sigmund Freud have argued that God and other religious beliefs are human inventions, created to fulfill various psychological and emotional wants or needs. This is also a view of many Buddhists.\nKarl Marx and Friedrich Engels, influenced by the work of Feuerbach, argued that belief in God and religion are social functions, used by those in power to oppress the working class. According to Mikhail Bakunin, \"the idea of God implies the abdication of human reason and justice; it is the most decisive negation of human liberty, and necessarily ends in the enslavement of mankind, in theory and practice.\" He reversed Voltaire's famous aphorism that if God did not exist, it would be necessary to invent him, writing instead that \"if God really existed, it would be necessary to abolish him.\"\n\nAtheism is not mutually exclusive with respect to some religious and spiritual belief systems, including Hinduism, Jainism, Buddhism, Syntheism, Raëlism, and Neopagan movements\nsuch as Wicca.\nĀstika schools in Hinduism hold atheism to be a valid path to moksha, but extremely difficult, for the atheist can not expect any help from the divine on their journey.\nJainism believes the universe is eternal and has no need for a creator deity, however Tirthankaras are revered that can transcend space and time\n\nand have more power than the god Indra.\nSecular Buddhism does not advocate belief in gods. Early Buddhism was atheistic as Gautama Buddha's path involved no mention of gods. Later conceptions of Buddhism consider Buddha himself a god, suggest adherents can attain godhood, and revere Bodhisattvas\nand Eternal Buddha.\n\nApophatic theology is often assessed as being a version of atheism or agnosticism, since it cannot say truly that God exists. \"The comparison is crude, however, for conventional atheism treats the existence of God as a predicate that can be denied (“God is nonexistent”), whereas negative theology denies that God has predicates\". \"God or the Divine is\" without being able to attribute qualities about \"what He is\" would be the prerequisite of positive theology in negative theology that distinguishes theism from atheism. \"Negative theology is a complement to, not the enemy of, positive theology\".\n\nAxiological, or constructive, atheism rejects the existence of gods in favor of a \"higher absolute\", such as humanity. This form of atheism favors humanity as the absolute source of ethics and values, and permits individuals to resolve moral problems without resorting to God. Marx and Freud used this argument to convey messages of liberation, full-development, and unfettered happiness. One of the most common criticisms of atheism has been to the contrary: that denying the existence of a god either leads to moral relativism and leaves one with no moral or ethical foundation, or renders life meaningless and miserable. Blaise Pascal argued this view in his \"Pensées\".\n\nFrench philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre identified himself as a representative of an \"atheist existentialism\"\nconcerned less with denying the existence of God than with establishing that \"man needs ... to find himself again and to understand that nothing can save him from himself, not even a valid proof of the existence of God.\"\nSartre said a corollary of his atheism was that \"if God does not exist, there is at least one being in whom existence precedes essence, a being who exists before he can be defined by any concept, and ... this being is man.\"\nThe practical consequence of this atheism was described by Sartre as meaning that there are no \"a priori rules\" or absolute values that can be invoked to govern human conduct, and that humans are \"condemned\" to invent these for themselves, making \"man\" absolutely \"responsible for everything he does\".\n\nSociologist Phil Zuckerman analyzed previous social science research on secularity and non-belief, and concluded that societal well-being is positively correlated with irreligion. He found that there are much lower concentrations of atheism and secularity in poorer, less developed nations (particularly in Africa and South America) than in the richer industrialized democracies.\nHis findings relating specifically to atheism in the US were that compared to religious people in the US, \"atheists and secular people\" are less nationalistic, prejudiced, antisemitic, racist, dogmatic, ethnocentric, closed-minded, and authoritarian, and in US states with the highest percentages of atheists, the murder rate is lower than average. In the most religious states, the murder rate is higher than average.\n\nPeople who self-identify as atheists are often assumed to be irreligious, but some sects within major religions reject the existence of a personal, creator deity.\nIn recent years, certain religious denominations have accumulated a number of openly atheistic followers, such as atheistic or humanistic Judaism\nand Christian atheists.\n\nThe strictest sense of positive atheism does not entail any specific beliefs outside of disbelief in any deity; as such, atheists can hold any number of spiritual beliefs. For the same reason, atheists can hold a wide variety of ethical beliefs, ranging from the moral universalism of humanism, which holds that a moral code should be applied consistently to all humans, to moral nihilism, which holds that morality is meaningless. Atheism is accepted as a valid philosophical position within some varieties of Hinduism, Jainism, and Buddhism.\n\nPhilosophers such as Slavoj Žižek, Alain de Botton, and Alexander Bard and Jan Söderqvist, have all argued that atheists should reclaim religion as an act of defiance against theism, precisely not to leave religion as an unwarranted monopoly to theists.\n\nAccording to Plato's Euthyphro dilemma, the role of the gods in determining right from wrong is either unnecessary or arbitrary. The argument that morality must be derived from God, and cannot exist without a wise creator, has been a persistent feature of political if not so much philosophical debate.\nMoral precepts such as \"murder is wrong\" are seen as divine laws, requiring a divine lawmaker and judge. However, many atheists argue that treating morality legalistically involves a false analogy, and that morality does not depend on a lawmaker in the same way that laws do.\nFriedrich Nietzsche believed in a morality independent of theistic belief, and stated that morality based upon God \"has truth only if God is truth—it stands or falls with faith in God.\"\n\nThere exist normative ethical systems that do not require principles and rules to be given by a deity. Some include virtue ethics, social contract, Kantian ethics, utilitarianism, and Objectivism. Sam Harris has proposed that moral prescription (ethical rule making) is not just an issue to be explored by philosophy, but that we can meaningfully practice a science of morality. Any such scientific system must, nevertheless, respond to the criticism embodied in the naturalistic fallacy.\n\nPhilosophers Susan Neiman\nand Julian Baggini\n(among others) assert that behaving ethically only because of divine mandate is not true ethical behavior but merely blind obedience. Baggini argues that atheism is a superior basis for ethics, claiming that a moral basis external to religious imperatives is necessary to evaluate the morality of the imperatives themselves—to be able to discern, for example, that \"thou shalt steal\" is immoral even if one's religion instructs it—and that atheists, therefore, have the advantage of being more inclined to make such evaluations.\nThe contemporary British political philosopher Martin Cohen has offered the more historically telling example of Biblical injunctions in favor of torture and slavery as evidence of how religious injunctions follow political and social customs, rather than vice versa, but also noted that the same tendency seems to be true of supposedly dispassionate and objective philosophers. Cohen extends this argument in more detail in \"Political Philosophy from Plato to Mao\", where he argues that the Qur'an played a role in perpetuating social codes from the early 7th century despite changes in secular society.\n\nSome prominent atheists—most recently Christopher Hitchens, Daniel Dennett, Sam Harris, and Richard Dawkins, and following such thinkers as Bertrand Russell, Robert G. Ingersoll, Voltaire, and novelist José Saramago—have criticized religions, citing harmful aspects of religious practices and doctrines.\n\nThe 19th-century German political theorist and sociologist Karl Marx called religion \"the sigh of the oppressed creature, the heart of a heartless world, and the soul of soulless conditions. It is the opium of the people\". He goes on to say, \"The abolition of religion as the illusory happiness of the people is the demand for their real happiness. To call on them to give up their illusions about their condition is to call on them to give up a condition that requires illusions. The criticism of religion is, therefore, in embryo, the criticism of that vale of tears of which religion is the halo.\" Lenin said that \"every religious idea and every idea of God is unutterable vileness ... of the most dangerous kind, 'contagion' of the most abominable kind. Millions of sins, filthy deeds, acts of violence and physical contagions ... are far less dangerous than the subtle, spiritual idea of God decked out in the smartest ideological constumes ...\"\n\nSam Harris criticizes Western religion's reliance on divine authority as lending itself to authoritarianism and dogmatism.\nThere is a correlation between religious fundamentalism and extrinsic religion (when religion is held because it serves ulterior interests) and authoritarianism, dogmatism, and prejudice.\nThese arguments—combined with historical events that are argued to demonstrate the dangers of religion, such as the Crusades, inquisitions, witch trials, and terrorist attacks—have been used in response to claims of beneficial effects of belief in religion.\nBelievers counter-argue that some regimes that espouse atheism, such as the Soviet Union, have also been guilty of mass murder. In response to those claims, atheists such as Sam Harris and Richard Dawkins have stated that Stalin's atrocities were influenced not by atheism but by dogmatic Marxism, and that while Stalin and Mao happened to be atheists, they did not do their deeds in the name of atheism.\n\nIn early ancient Greek, the adjective ' (, from the privative ἀ- + \"god\") meant \"godless\". It was first used as a term of censure roughly meaning \"ungodly\" or \"impious\". In the 5th century BCE, the word began to indicate more deliberate and active godlessness in the sense of \"severing relations with the gods\" or \"denying the gods\". The term ἀσεβής (') then came to be applied against those who impiously denied or disrespected the local gods, even if they believed in other gods. Modern translations of classical texts sometimes render ' as \"atheistic\". As an abstract noun, there was also ('), \"atheism\". Cicero transliterated the Greek word into the Latin \"\". The term found frequent use in the debate between early Christians and Hellenists, with each side attributing it, in the pejorative sense, to the other.\n\nThe term \"atheist\" (from Fr. \"\"), in the sense of \"one who ... denies the existence of God or gods\",\npredates \"atheism\" in English, being first found as early as 1566,\nand again in 1571.\n\"Atheist\" as a label of practical godlessness was used at least as early as 1577.\nThe term \"atheism\" was derived from the French \"\", and appears in English about 1587.\nAn earlier work, from about 1534, used the term \"atheonism\".\nRelated words emerged later: \"deist\" in 1621,\n\"theist\" in 1662,\n\"deism\" in 1675,\nand \"theism\" in 1678.\nAt that time \"deist\" and \"deism\" already carried their modern meaning. The term \"theism\" came to be contrasted with deism.\n\nKaren Armstrong writes that \"During the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, the word 'atheist' was still reserved exclusively for polemic ... The term 'atheist' was an insult. Nobody would have dreamed of calling \"himself\" an atheist.\"\n\n\"Atheism\" was first used to describe a self-avowed belief in late 18th-century Europe, specifically denoting disbelief in the monotheistic Abrahamic god.\nIn the 20th century, globalization contributed to the expansion of the term to refer to disbelief in all deities, though it remains common in Western society to describe atheism as simply \"disbelief in God\".\n\nWhile the earliest-found usage of the term \"atheism\" is in 16th-century France, ideas that would be recognized today as atheistic are documented from the Vedic period and the classical antiquity.\n\nAtheistic schools are found in early Indian thought and have existed from the times of the historical Vedic religion.\nAmong the six orthodox schools of Hindu philosophy, Samkhya, the oldest philosophical school of thought, does not accept God, and the early Mimamsa also rejected the notion of God.\nThe thoroughly materialistic and anti-theistic philosophical Cārvāka (or \"Lokāyata\") school that originated in India around the 6th century BCE is probably the most explicitly atheistic school of philosophy in India, similar to the Greek Cyrenaic school. This branch of Indian philosophy is classified as heterodox due to its rejection of the authority of Vedas and hence is not considered part of the six orthodox schools of Hinduism, but it is noteworthy as evidence of a materialistic movement within Hinduism.\nChatterjee and Datta explain that our understanding of Cārvāka philosophy is fragmentary, based largely on criticism of the ideas by other schools, and that it is not a living tradition:\n\nOther Indian philosophies generally regarded as atheistic include Classical Samkhya and Purva Mimamsa. The rejection of a personal creator God is also seen in Jainism and Buddhism in India.\n\nWestern atheism has its roots in pre-Socratic Greek philosophy, but atheism in the modern sense was nonexistent or extremely rare in ancient Greece. Pre-Socratic Atomists such as Democritus attempted to explain the world in a purely materialistic way and interpreted religion as a human reaction to natural phenomena, but did not explicitly deny the gods' existence. In the late fifth century BCE, the Greek lyric poet Diagoras of Melos was sentenced to death in Athens under the charge of being a \"godless person\" (ἄθεος) after he made fun of the Eleusinian Mysteries, but he fled the city to escape punishment. Later writers have cited Diagoras as the \"first atheist\", but he was probably not an atheist in the modern sense of the word.\n\nA fragment from the lost satyr play \"Sisyphus\", which has been attributed to both Critias and Euripides, claims that a clever man invented \"the fear of the gods\" in order to frighten people into behaving morally. This statement, however, originally did not mean that the gods themselves were nonexistent, but rather that their powers were a hoax. Atheistic statements have also been attributed to the philosopher Prodicus. Philodemus reports that Prodicus believed that \"the gods of popular belief do not exist nor do they know, but primitive man, [out of admiration, deified] the fruits of the earth and virtually everything that contributed to his existence\". Protagoras has sometimes been taken to be an atheist, but rather espoused agnostic views, commenting that \"Concerning the gods I am unable to discover whether they exist or not, or what they are like in form; for there are many hindrances to knowledge, the obscurity of the subject and the brevity of human life.\"\n\nThe Athenian public associated Socrates (c. 470–399 BCE) with the trends in pre-Socratic philosophy towards naturalistic inquiry and the rejection of divine explanations for phenomena. Aristophanes' comic play \"The Clouds\" (performed 423 BCE) portrays Socrates as teaching his students that the traditional Greek deities do not exist. Socrates was later tried and executed under the charge of not believing in the gods of the state and instead worshipping foreign gods. Socrates himself vehemently denied the charges of atheism at his trial and all the surviving sources about him indicate that he was a very devout man, who prayed to the rising sun and believed that the oracle at Delphi spoke the word of Apollo. Euhemerus ( 300 BCE) published his view that the gods were only the deified rulers, conquerors and founders of the past, and that their cults and religions were in essence the continuation of vanished kingdoms and earlier political structures. Although not strictly an atheist, Euhemerus was later criticized for having \"spread atheism over the whole inhabited earth by obliterating the gods\".\n\nThe most important Greek thinker in the development of atheism was Epicurus ( 300 BCE). Drawing on the ideas of Democritus and the Atomists, he espoused a materialistic philosophy according to which the universe was governed by the laws of chance without the need for divine intervention (see scientific determinism). Although Epicurus still maintained that the gods existed, he believed that they were uninterested in human affairs. The aim of the Epicureans was to attain \"ataraxia\" (\"peace of mind\") and one important way of doing this was by exposing fear of divine wrath as irrational. The Epicureans also denied the existence of an afterlife and the need to fear divine punishment after death. In the 3rd-century BCE, the Greek philosophers Theodorus Cyrenaicus and Strato of Lampsacus did not believe in the existence of gods. The Roman philosopher Sextus Empiricus held that one should suspend judgment about virtually all beliefs—a form of skepticism known as Pyrrhonism—that nothing was inherently evil, and that ataraxia is attainable by withholding one's judgment. His relatively large volume of surviving works had a lasting influence on later philosophers.\n\nThe meaning of \"atheist\" changed over the course of classical antiquity. Early Christians were widely reviled as \"atheists\" because they did not believe in the existence of the Graeco-Roman deities. During the Roman Empire, Christians were executed for their rejection of the Roman gods in general and Emperor-worship in particular. When Christianity became the state religion of Rome under Theodosius I in 381, heresy became a punishable offense.\nDuring the Early Middle Ages, the Islamic world experienced a Golden Age. Along with advances in science and philosophy, Arab and Persian lands produced outspoken rationalists and atheists, including Muhammad al Warraq (fl. 9th century), Ibn al-Rawandi (827–911), Al-Razi (854–925), and Al-Maʿarri (973–1058). Al-Ma'arri wrote and taught that religion itself was a \"fable invented by the ancients\" and that humans were \"of two sorts: those with brains, but no religion, and those with religion, but no brains.\" Despite their being relatively prolific writers, little of their work survives, mainly being preserved through quotations and excerpts in later works by Muslim apologists attempting to refute them. Other prominent Golden Age scholars have been associated with rationalist thought and atheism as well, although the current intellectual atmosphere in the Islamic world, and the scant evidence that survives from the era, make this point a contentious one today.\n\nIn Europe, the espousal of atheistic views was rare during the Early Middle Ages and Middle Ages (see Medieval Inquisition); metaphysics and theology were the dominant interests pertaining to religion. There were, however, movements within this period that furthered heterodox conceptions of the Christian god, including differing views of the nature, transcendence, and knowability of God. Individuals and groups such as Johannes Scotus Eriugena, David of Dinant, Amalric of Bena, and the Brethren of the Free Spirit maintained Christian viewpoints with pantheistic tendencies. Nicholas of Cusa held to a form of fideism he called \"docta ignorantia\" (\"learned ignorance\"), asserting that God is beyond human categorization, and thus our knowledge of him is limited to conjecture. William of Ockham inspired anti-metaphysical tendencies with his nominalistic limitation of human knowledge to singular objects, and asserted that the divine essence could not be intuitively or rationally apprehended by human intellect. Followers of Ockham, such as John of Mirecourt and Nicholas of Autrecourt furthered this view. The resulting division between faith and reason influenced later radical and reformist theologians such as John Wycliffe, Jan Hus, and Martin Luther.\n\nThe Renaissance did much to expand the scope of free thought and skeptical inquiry. Individuals such as Leonardo da Vinci sought experimentation as a means of explanation, and opposed arguments from religious authority. Other critics of religion and the Church during this time included Niccolò Machiavelli, Bonaventure des Périers, Michel de Montaigne, and François Rabelais.\n\nHistorian Geoffrey Blainey wrote that the Reformation had paved the way for atheists by attacking the authority of the Catholic Church, which in turn \"quietly inspired other thinkers to attack the authority of the new Protestant churches\". Deism gained influence in France, Prussia, and England. The philosopher Baruch Spinoza was \"probably the first well known 'semi-atheist' to announce himself in a Christian land in the modern era\", according to Blainey. Spinoza believed that natural laws explained the workings of the universe. In 1661 he published his \"Short Treatise on God\".\n\nCriticism of Christianity became increasingly frequent in the 17th and 18th centuries, especially in France and England, where there appears to have been a religious malaise, according to contemporary sources. Some Protestant thinkers, such as Thomas Hobbes, espoused a materialist philosophy and skepticism toward supernatural occurrences, while Spinoza rejected divine providence in favor of a panentheistic naturalism. By the late 17th century, deism came to be openly espoused by intellectuals such as John Toland who coined the term \"pantheist\".\n\nThe first known explicit atheist was the German critic of religion Matthias Knutzen in his three writings of 1674. He was followed by two other explicit atheist writers, the Polish ex-Jesuit philosopher Kazimierz Łyszczyński and in the 1720s by the French priest Jean Meslier. In the course of the 18th century, other openly atheistic thinkers followed, such as Baron d'Holbach, Jacques-André Naigeon, and other French materialists. John Locke in contrast, though an advocate of tolerance, urged authorities not to tolerate atheism, believing that the denial of God's existence would undermine the social order and lead to chaos.\n\nThe philosopher David Hume developed a skeptical epistemology grounded in empiricism, and Immanuel Kant's philosophy has strongly questioned the very possibility of a metaphysical knowledge. Both philosophers undermined the metaphysical basis of natural theology and criticized classical arguments for the existence of God.\nBlainey notes that, although Voltaire is widely considered to have strongly contributed to atheistic thinking during the Revolution, he also considered fear of God to have discouraged further disorder, having said \"If God did not exist, it would be necessary to invent him.\" In \"Reflections on the Revolution in France\" (1790), the philosopher Edmund Burke denounced atheism, writing of a \"literary cabal\" who had \"some years ago formed something like a regular plan for the destruction of the Christian religion. This object they pursued with a degree of zeal which hitherto had been discovered only in the propagators of some system of piety ... These atheistical fathers have a bigotry of their own ...\". But, Burke asserted, \"man is by his constitution a religious animal\" and \"atheism is against, not only our reason, but our instincts; and ... it cannot prevail long\".\n\nBaron d'Holbach was a prominent figure in the French Enlightenment who is best known for his atheism and for his voluminous writings against religion, the most famous of them being \"The System of Nature\" (1770) but also \"Christianity Unveiled\". One goal of the French Revolution was a restructuring and subordination of the clergy with respect to the state through the Civil Constitution of the Clergy. Attempts to enforce it led to anti-clerical violence and the expulsion of many clergy from France, lasting until the Thermidorian Reaction. The radical Jacobins seized power in 1793, ushering in the Reign of Terror. The Jacobins were deists and introduced the Cult of the Supreme Being as a new French state religion. Some atheists surrounding Jacques Hébert instead sought to establish a Cult of Reason, a form of atheistic pseudo-religion with a goddess personifying reason. The Napoleonic era further institutionalized the secularization of French society.\n\nIn the latter half of the 19th century, atheism rose to prominence under the influence of rationalistic and freethinking philosophers. Many prominent German philosophers of this era denied the existence of deities and were critical of religion, including Ludwig Feuerbach, Arthur Schopenhauer, Max Stirner, Karl Marx, and Friedrich Nietzsche.\n\nGeorge Holyoake was the last person (1842) imprisoned in Great Britain due to atheist beliefs. Law notes that he may have also been the first imprisoned on such a charge. Stephen Law states that Holyoake \"first coined the term 'secularism'\".\n\nAtheism, particularly in the form of practical atheism, advanced in many societies in the 20th century. Atheistic thought found recognition in a wide variety of other, broader philosophies, such as existentialism, objectivism, secular humanism, nihilism, anarchism, logical positivism, Marxism, feminism, and the general scientific and rationalist movement.\nIn addition, state atheism emerged in Eastern Europe and Asia during that period, particularly in the Soviet Union under Vladimir Lenin and Joseph Stalin, and in Communist China under Mao Zedong. Atheist and anti-religious policies in the Soviet Union included numerous legislative acts, the outlawing of religious instruction in the schools, and the emergence of the League of Militant Atheists. After Mao, the Chinese Communist Party remains an atheist organization, and regulates, but does not forbid, the practice of religion in mainland China.\n\nWhile Geoffrey Blainey has written that \"the most ruthless leaders in the Second World War were atheists and secularists who were intensely hostile to both Judaism and Christianity\", Richard Madsen has pointed out that Hitler and Stalin each opened and closed churches as a matter of political expedience, and Stalin softened his opposition to Christianity in order to improve public acceptance of his regime during the war. Blackford and Schüklenk have written that \"the Soviet Union was undeniably an atheist state, and the same applies to Maoist China and Pol Pot's fanatical Khmer Rouge regime in Cambodia in the 1970s. That does not, however, show that the atrocities committed by these totalitarian dictatorships were the result of atheist beliefs, carried out in the name of atheism, or caused primarily by the atheistic aspects of the relevant forms of communism.\"\nLogical positivism and scientism paved the way for neopositivism, analytical philosophy, structuralism, and naturalism. Neopositivism and analytical philosophy discarded classical rationalism and metaphysics in favor of strict empiricism and epistemological nominalism. Proponents such as Bertrand Russell emphatically rejected belief in God. In his early work, Ludwig Wittgenstein attempted to separate metaphysical and supernatural language from rational discourse. A. J. Ayer asserted the unverifiability and meaninglessness of religious statements, citing his adherence to the empirical sciences. Relatedly the applied structuralism of Lévi-Strauss sourced religious language to the human subconscious in denying its transcendental meaning. J. N. Findlay and J. J. C. Smart argued that the existence of God is not logically necessary. Naturalists and materialistic monists such as John Dewey considered the natural world to be the basis of everything, denying the existence of God or immortality.\n\nOther leaders like Periyar E. V. Ramasamy, a prominent atheist leader of India, fought against Hinduism and Brahmins for discriminating and dividing people in the name of caste and religion.\nThis was highlighted in 1956 when he arranged for the erection of a statue depicting a Hindu god in a humble representation and made antitheistic statements.\n\nAtheist Vashti McCollum was the plaintiff in a landmark 1948 Supreme Court case that struck down religious education in US public schools. Madalyn Murray O'Hair was perhaps one of the most influential American atheists; she brought forth the 1963 Supreme Court case \"Murray v. Curlett\" which banned compulsory prayer in public schools. In 1966, \"\"Time\"\" magazine asked \"Is God Dead?\"\nin response to the Death of God theological movement, citing the estimation that nearly half of all people in the world lived under an anti-religious power, and millions more in Africa, Asia, and South America seemed to lack knowledge of the Christian view of theology. The Freedom From Religion Foundation was co-founded by Anne Nicol Gaylor and her daughter, Annie Laurie Gaylor, in 1976 in the United States, and incorporated nationally in 1978. It promotes the separation of church and state.\n\nSince the fall of the Berlin Wall, the number of actively anti-religious regimes has reduced considerably. In 2006, Timothy Shah of the Pew Forum noted \"a worldwide trend across all major religious groups, in which God-based and faith-based movements in general are experiencing increasing confidence and influence vis-à-vis secular movements and ideologies.\"\nHowever, Gregory S. Paul and Phil Zuckerman consider this a myth and suggest that the actual situation is much more complex and nuanced.\n\nA 2010 survey found that those identifying themselves as atheists or agnostics are on average more knowledgeable about religion than followers of major faiths. Nonbelievers scored better on questions about tenets central to Protestant and Catholic faiths. Only Mormon and Jewish faithful scored as well as atheists and agnostics.\n\nIn 2012, the first \"Women in Secularism\" conference was held in Arlington, Virginia. Secular Woman was organized in 2012 as a national organization focused on nonreligious women. The atheist feminist movement has also become increasingly focused on fighting sexism and sexual harassment within the atheist movement itself.\nIn August 2012, Jennifer McCreight (the organizer of Boobquake) founded a movement within atheism known as Atheism Plus, or A+, that \"applies skepticism to everything, including social issues like sexism, racism, politics, poverty, and crime\".\n\nIn 2013 the first atheist monument on American government property was unveiled at the Bradford County Courthouse in Florida: a 1,500-pound granite bench and plinth inscribed with quotes by Thomas Jefferson, Benjamin Franklin, and Madalyn Murray O'Hair.\n\n\"New Atheism\" is the name that has been given to a movement among some early-21st-century atheist writers who have advocated the view that \"religion should not simply be tolerated but should be countered, criticized, and exposed by rational argument wherever its influence arises.\"\nThe movement is commonly associated with Sam Harris, Daniel C. Dennett, Richard Dawkins, Victor J. Stenger, Christopher Hitchens, and to some extent Ayaan Hirsi Ali. Several best-selling books by these authors, published between 2004 and 2007, form the basis for much of the discussion of \"New\" Atheism.\n\nIn best selling books, the religiously motivated terrorist events of 9/11 and the partially successful attempts of the Discovery Institute to change the American science curriculum to include creationist ideas, together with support for those ideas from George W. Bush in 2005, have been cited by authors such as Harris, Dennett, Dawkins, Stenger, and Hitchens as evidence of a need to move toward a more secular society.\n\nIt is difficult to quantify the number of atheists in the world. Respondents to religious-belief polls may define \"atheism\" differently or draw different distinctions between \"atheism\", non-religious beliefs, and non-theistic religious and spiritual beliefs. A Hindu atheist would declare oneself as a Hindu, although also being an atheist at the same time. A 2010 survey published in \"Encyclopædia Britannica\" found that the non-religious made up about 9.6% of the world's population, and atheists about 2.0%, with a very large majority based in Asia. This figure did not include those who follow atheistic religions, such as some Buddhists. The average annual change for atheism from 2000 to 2010 was −0.17%. Broad estimates of those who have an absence of belief in a god range from 500 million to 1.1 billion people worldwide.\n\nAccording to global Win-Gallup International studies, 13% of respondents were \"convinced atheists\" in 2012, 11% were \"convinced atheists\" in 2015, and in 2017, 9% were \"convinced atheists\". , the top 10 surveyed countries with people who viewed themselves as \"convinced atheists\" were China (47%), Japan (31%), the Czech Republic (30%), France (29%), South Korea (15%), Germany (15%), Netherlands (14%), Austria (10%), Iceland (10%), Australia (10%), and the Republic of Ireland (10%).\n\nAccording to the 2010 Eurobarometer Poll, the percentage of those polled who agreed with the statement \"you don't believe there is any sort of spirit, God or life force\" varied from a high percentage in France (40%), Czech Republic (37%), Sweden (34%), Netherlands (30%), and Estonia (29%); medium-high percentage in Germany (27%), Belgium (27%), UK (25%); to very low in Poland (5%), Greece (4%), Cyprus (3%), Malta (2%), and Romania (1%), with the European Union as a whole at 20%. In a 2012 Eurobarometer poll on discrimination in the European Union, 16% of those polled considered themselves non believers/agnostics and 7% considered themselves atheists.\n\nAccording to a Pew Research Center survey in 2012 religiously unaffiliated (including agnostics and atheists) make up about 18% of Europeans. According to the same survey, the religiously unaffiliated are the majority of the population only in two European countries: Czech Republic (75%) and Estonia (60%).\n\nThere are another four countries where the unaffiliated make up a majority of the population: North Korea (71%), Japan (57%), Hong Kong (56%), and China (52%).\n\nAccording to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, 30% of Australians have \"no religion\", a category that includes atheists.\n\nIn a 2013 census, 41.9% of New Zealanders reported having no religion, up from 29.6% in 1991. Men were more likely than women to report no religion.\n\nAccording to the World Values Survey, 4.4% of Americans self-identified as atheists in 2014. However, the same survey showed that 11.1% of all respondents stated \"no\" when asked if they believed in God. In 1984, these same figures were 1.1% and 2.2%, respectively. According to a 2014 report by the Pew Research Center, 3.1% of the US adult population identify as atheist, up from 1.6% in 2007; and within the religiously unaffiliated (or \"no religion\") demographic, atheists made up 13.6%. According to the 2015 General Sociological Survey the number of atheists and agnostics in the US has remained relatively flat in the past 23 years since in 1991 only 2% identified as atheist and 4% identified as agnostic and in 2014 only 3% identified as atheists and 5% identified as agnostics.\n\nAccording to the American Family Survey, 34% was found to be religiously unaffiliated in 2017 (23% 'nothing in particular', 6% agnostic, 5% atheist). According to the Pew Research Center, in 2014, 22.8% of the American population does not identify with a religion, including atheists (3.1%) and agnostics (4%). According to a PRRI survey, 24% of the population is unaffiliated. Atheists and agnostics combined make up about a quarter of this unaffiliated demographic.\n\nIn recent years, the profile of atheism has risen substantially in the Arab world. In major cities across the region, such as Cairo, atheists have been organizing in cafés and social media, despite regular crackdowns from authoritarian governments. A 2012 poll by Gallup International revealed that 5% of Saudis considered themselves to be \"convinced atheists.\" However, very few young people in the Arab world have atheists in their circle of friends or acquaintances. According to one study, less than 1% did in Morocco, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, or Jordan; only 3% to 7% in the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Kuwait, and Palestine. When asked whether they have \"seen or heard traces of atheism in [their] locality, community, and society\" only about 3% to 8% responded yes in all the countries surveyed. The only exception was the UAE, with a percentage of 51%.\n\nA study noted positive correlations between levels of education and secularism, including atheism, in America. According to evolutionary psychologist Nigel Barber, atheism blossoms in places where most people feel economically secure, particularly in the social democracies of Europe, as there is less uncertainty about the future with extensive social safety nets and better health care resulting in a greater quality of life and higher life expectancy. By contrast, in underdeveloped countries, there are virtually no atheists.\n\nIn a 2008 study, researchers found intelligence to be negatively related to religious belief in Europe and the United States. In a sample of 137 countries, the correlation between national IQ and disbelief in God was found to be 0.60. Evolutionary psychologist Nigel Barber states that the reason atheists are more intelligent than religious people is better explained by social, environmental, and wealth factors which happen to correlate with loss of religious belief as well. He doubts that religion causes stupidity, noting that some highly intelligent people have also been religious, but he says it is plausible that higher intelligence correlates to rejection of improbable religious beliefs and that the situation between intelligence and rejection of religious beliefs is quite complex.\n\nIn a 2017 study, it was shown that compared to religious individuals, atheists have higher reasoning capacities and this difference seemed to be unrelated to sociodemographic factors such as age, education and country of origin.\n\nStatistically, atheists are held in poor regard across the globe. Non-atheists, and possibly even fellow atheists, seem to implicitly view atheists as prone to exhibit immoral behaviors ranging from mass murder to not paying at a restaurant. In addition, according to a 2016 Pew Research Center publication, 15% of French people, 45% of Americans, and 99% of Indonesians explicitly believe that a person must believe in God to be moral. Pew furthermore noted that, in a U.S. poll, atheists and Muslims tied for the lowest rating among the major religious demographics on a \"feeling thermometer\".\n\n\n"}
{"id": "28843311", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=28843311", "title": "BIA Separations", "text": "BIA Separations\n\nBIA Separations is a biotechnology company focused on the production of methacrylate monolithic HPLC columns and developing industrial purification processes and analytical methods.\n\nBIA Separations was formed in 1998 by a group of scientists in Ljubljana, Slovenia to commercialize a new chromatographic resin based on monolith technology. Monolithic resin was developed independently by three different laboratories in late 1980s led by Hjertén, Švec and Tennikova. The company was one of the few Slovenian companies to receive venture capital funding at that time-Horizonte Venture Management realizing the potential of monoliths made the initial investment in the company. During that year, BIA Separations released its first commercial product marketed under the trade name of CIM (Convective Interaction Media). The new technique was named HPMC (High Performance Monolith Chromatography). During the 1999 and 2000s, the company promoted this new platform technology to the scientific and business community and registered several patents. In 2007 the company headquarters moved to Villach, Austria. In 2011 BIA Separations entered a strategic partnership with Japan Synthetic Rubber Corporation, a Japanese company producing synthetic materials. A strategic partnership agreement with Showa Denko K.K. (SDK) was signed in 2012.\n\nCIM monoliths are made of porous methacrylate polymers composed of interconnected channels that range in size from 1-6 μm. It is these channels that account for the media separation power and flow characteristics and ability to purify large biomolecules, such as large proteins, immunoglobulins, plasmid DNA and viruses with their activity intact. Components to be separated are conveyed to the active groups located on the surface of the channels by bulk flow of the mobile phase. Since the channels are interconnected, there is no diffusion, no dead end pores, no void volume and no stagnant zones to slow down the transport between the stationary and mobile phase. Consequently, monolithic columns have flow independent resolution and binding capacity. They exhibit low back pressure, even at very high flow rates. In this way, the purification time can be significantly decreased, resulting in a pronounced reduction of the purification process costs.\n\nDepending on the column size, CIM monolithic columns are primarily used for the purification or analysis of large biomolecules which are being used for cancer gene therapy, treatment of viral infectious diseases and treatment of genetic diseases. Some types of molecules that can be successfully purified using CIM columns are pDNA, \nIgM,\ninter-alpha inhibitors,\nvirus like particles, and diverse viruses; adenoviruses,\nbacteriophages, \nfeline calicivirus,\nhepatitis A, \nlentivirus,\ninfluenza A and B,\nrabies virus,\nrotavirus,\ntomato and pepino mosaic virus.\n\nSince 2004, BIA Separations has organized and hosted the Monolith Summer School and Symposium (MSS) which takes place every 2 years. MSS was established as there were no dedicated conferences to this technology and to bring together the top international scientists and researchers in the area of monolith chromatography to share their experiences and innovative applications.\n\n"}

This activity is a Grand Challenge focused on revolutionizing our understanding of the human brain, and was developed by the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) as part of a broader White House Neuroscience Initiative. Inspired by the Human Genome Project, BRAIN aims to help researchers uncover the mysteries of brain disorders, such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, depression, and traumatic brain injury (TBI).\n\nThe BRAIN Initiative reflects a number of influences, stemming back over a decade. Some of these include: planning meetings at the National Institutes of Health that led to the NIH's Blueprint for Neuroscience Research; workshops at the National Science Foundation (NSF) on cognition, neuroscience, and convergent science, including a 2006 report on \"Grand Challenges of Mind and Brain\"; reports from the National Research Council and the Institute of Medicine's Forum on Neuroscience and Nervous System Disorders, including \"From Molecules to Mind: Challenges for the 21st Century,\" a report of a June 25, 2008 Workshop on Grand Challenges in Neuroscience.; years of research and reports from scientists and professional societies; and congressional interest. One important activity was the Brain Activity Map Project. In September 2011, molecular biologist Miyoung Chun of The Kavli Foundation organized a conference in London, at which scientists first put forth the idea of such a project. At subsequent meetings, scientists from US government laboratories, including members of the Office of Science and Technology Policy, and from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute and the Allen Institute for Brain Science, along with representatives from Google, Microsoft, and Qualcomm, discussed possibilities for a future government-led project. Other influences included the interdisciplinary \"Decade of the Mind\" project led by James L. Olds, who is currently the Assistant Director for Biological Sciences at NSF, and the \"Revolutionizing Prosthetics\" project at DARPA, led by Dr. Geoffrey Ling and shown on 60 Minutes in April 2009.\n\nDevelopment of the plan for the BRAIN Initiative within the Executive Office of the President (EOP) was led by OSTP and included the following EOP staff: Philip Rubin, then Principal Assistant Director for Science and leader of the White House Neuroscience Initiative; Thomas Kalil, Deputy Director for Technology and Innovation; Cristin Dorgelo, then Assistant Director for Grand Challenges, and currently Chief of Staff at OSTP; and Carlos Peña, Assistant Director for Emerging Technologies and currently the Division Director for the Division of Neurological and Physical Medicine Devices, in the Office of Device Evaluation, Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH), at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).\n\nOn April 2, 2013, at a White House event, President Barack Obama announced The BRAIN Initiative, with proposed initial expenditures for fiscal year 2014 of approximately $110 million from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), the National Institutes of Health (NIH), and the National Science Foundation (NSF). The President also directed the Presidential Commission for the Study of Bioethical Issues to explore the ethical, legal, and societal implications raised by the initiative and by neuroscience in general. Additional commitments were also made by the Allen Institute for Brain Science, the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, and The Kavli Foundation. The NIH also announced the creation of a working group of the Advisory Committee to the Director, led by neuroscientists Cornelia Bargmann and William Newsome and with \"ex officio\" participation from DARPA and NSF, to help shape NIH's role in the BRAIN Initiative. NSF planned to receive advice from its directorate advisory committees, from the National Science Board, and from a series of meetings bringing together scientists in neuroscience and related areas.\n\nNews reports said the research would map the dynamics of neuron activity in mice and other animals and eventually the tens of billions of neurons in the human brain.\n\nIn a 2012 scientific commentary outlining experimental plans for a more limited project, Alivisatos \"et al.\" outlined a variety of specific experimental techniques that might be used to achieve what they termed a \"functional connectome\", as well as new technologies that will have to be developed in the course of the project. They indicated that initial studies might be done in \"Caenorhabditis elegans\", followed by \"Drosophila\", because of their comparatively simple neural circuits. Mid-term studies could be done in zebrafish, mice, and the Etruscan shrew, with studies ultimately to be done in primates and humans. They proposed the development of nanoparticles that could be used as voltage sensors that would detect individual action potentials, as well as nanoprobes that could serve as electrophysiological multielectrode arrays. In particular, they called for the use of wireless, noninvasive methods of neuronal activity detection, either utilizing microelectronic very-large-scale integration, or based on synthetic biology rather than microelectronics. In one such proposed method, enzymatically produced DNA would serve as a \"ticker tape record\" of neuronal activity, based on calcium ion-induced errors in coding by DNA polymerase. Data would be analyzed and modeled by large scale computation. A related technique proposed the use of high-throughput DNA sequencing for rapidly mapping neural connectivity.\n\nThe timeline proposed by the Working Group in 2014 is:\n\nThe advisory committee is:\n\n\nScientists offered differing views of the plan. Neuroscientist John Donoghue said that the project would fill a gap in neuroscience research between, on the one hand, activity measurements at the level of brain regions using methods such as fMRI, and, on the other hand, measurements at the level of single cells. Psychologist Ed Vul expressed concern, however, that the initiative would divert funding from individual investigator studies. Neuroscientist Donald Stein expressed concern that it would be a mistake to begin by spending money on technological methods, before knowing exactly what would be measured. Physicist Michael Roukes argued instead that methods in nanotechnology are becoming sufficiently mature to make the time right for a brain activity map.\n\nThe projects face great logistical challenges. Neuroscientists estimated that the project would generate 300 exabytes of data every year, presenting a significant technical barrier. Most of the available high-resolution brain activity monitors are of limited use, as they must be invasively implanted surgically by opening the skull. Parallels have been drawn to past large-scale government-led research efforts including the map of the human genome, the voyage to the moon, and the development of the atomic bomb.\n\n\n"}

Roberts as he proposed one of the first aid in dying laws in the nation. When Coombs Lee read in her church bulletin that congregants wanted to draft a Death with Dignity bill and place it before Oregon voters, she volunteered to help. She joined the Oregon Right to Die Political Action Committee that had already been working on draft bills, and was later selected, together with Elven Sinnard and Dr. Peter Goodwin, to be a chief petitioner who filed the Oregon Death with Dignity Act as a citizens' initiative in 1994. Coombs Lee served as spokesperson for the group through two statewide campaigns and 10 years defending against attacks on the nation's first Death with Dignity law in both the judicial and legislative arenas. Senator Roberts' wife, Oregon Governor Barbara Roberts, became a good friend and a tireless and outspoken advocate for Death with Dignity.\n\nUnder Coombs Lee's leadership, since 1996 as president of Compassion in Dying (which became Compassion & Choices in 2005), the end-of-life choice movement has achieved many milestones. In 2008, Coombs Lee was a senior advisor for the Washington State Death with Dignity ballot initiative that voters approved by an 18-point margin, becoming the second state to legalize aid in dying. In 2009, the Montana Supreme Court ruled in the landmark case brought by Compassion & Choices (\"Baxter v. Montana\") that it is not against the state's public policy for a physician to provide aid in dying to a mentally competent, terminally ill adult.\n\nCoombs Lee has been interviewed by many of the nation's leading media outlets, including Bloomberg News, \"The New York Times, USA Today, The Washington Post, The Chicago Tribune\", All Things Considered, The Diane Rehm Show, NBC News, Crossfire, 60 Minutes, The MacNeil/Lehrer NewsHour, The Today Show, On Our Own Terms: Moyers on Dying, and The Dr. Oz Show.\n\nCoombs Lee has presented at TEDx Talks, Stanford MedicineX, CUSP Conference, Plato Society, American Bar Association, Older Women's League, American Pain Society, Oregon State Bar, Cleveland City Club, Americans for Better Care of the Dying, American Association for the Advancement of Science and the American Pain Society, and the World Federation Right to Die. Her audiences include the Oregon Gerontological Association and the California Nurse Assembly & Education Conference. Her 1999 debate Doctor Assisted Suicide: Compassionate Alternative or Murder with James Bopp, Jr., was produced the Annenberg Public Policy Center for Public Radio.\n\nCoombs Lee studied literature and nursing at Vassar College, Cornell University, and the New York Hospital School of Nursing, and earned advanced degrees in medicine and law from the School of Public Health Medex Program and Lewis & Clark Law School.

In Sweden she was often called Queen Bengta.\n\nOur knowledge of Benedicta comes from a genealogy of the Hvide family compiled in the Sorø Abbey in the 14th century. From the terse data of this source, the following life-story has been deduced. Benedicta was born in Knadrup in Northern Zealand in Denmark between 1165 and 1170 as the child of the noble Ebbe Sunesson Hvide. The Swedish infant prince Sverker Karlsson was brought to Denmark in 1167 after the killing of his father, and was apparently raised by his powerful maternal relatives. Most probably he met his future bride, a kinswoman of his mother, there, and married her when reaching manly years. This may have happened in the mid-1180s.\n\nIn 1195 or 1196, her spouse became king of Sweden, and she became queen consort. The same year, her relative, the priest Andreas Sunesson, returned to Denmark from France and became the leading clerical politician in the archbishopric under Absalon, also a relative of Benedicta. It is probable that Queen Benedicta shared the strongly pro-clerical position of her husband, and supported the power aspirations of the Church and the archbishop Olov Lambatunga in Uppsala.\n\nSince Sverker's next queen Ingegerd gave birth to a son in 1201, it is assumed that Queen Benedicta died no later than in 1199 or 1200. The cause of her death is unknown, but is sometimes guessed that she succumbed in childbirth. However, a grave inscription from the so-called Sverker Chapel in Alvastra has been associated with her. It mentions \"the servant of Our Lord Jesus Christ, Benedicta\", with an expression of hope that \"she may find rest from the horrible disease which struck her\".\n\nThe extreme curtness of the sources on Sverker II's wives has given rise to an alternative chronology of the marriages. It has been suggested that Ingegerd was in fact his first consort, which tied him to the powerful House of Bjälbo in Östergötland. Ingegerd's father, Jarl Birger Brosa, was presumably instrumental in arranging the peaceful succession in 1195/96, when Sverker was enthroned after the death of his father's murderer Canute I. On the other hand, Sverker was able to gather strong support from his Danish in-laws when he tried to take back his kingdom from Canute I's son Eric in 1208. This support would have come more naturally if Sverker was married to Benedicta at this time.\n\n\n"}

He played for the NBA's Orlando Magic, Denver Nuggets, Los Angeles Clippers, Chicago Bulls and Detroit Pistons. Dele won a championship with the Bulls in 1997. He is believed to have been murdered at sea by his older brother in 2002.\n\nWilliams was born in Fresno, California, the second son of Patricia Phillips and of singer Eugene \"Geno\" Williams Jr. of the musical group The Platters, who later divorced. Patricia Phillips remarried and raised her two sons in Fresno until that marriage ended when Brian was in junior high. He attended Saint Monica Catholic High School in Santa Monica, California, where his jersey is retired. He was a track and field runner, until a high school growth spurt pushed him towards basketball. His collegiate basketball career began at the University of Maryland, where he played for one year before sitting out the next season while transferring to the University of Arizona.\n\nAfter playing for two seasons at Arizona, he was drafted in the first round of the 1991 NBA Draft by the Orlando Magic. He saw limited action during two seasons in Orlando.\n\nAfter playing for Orlando, Williams joined the Denver Nuggets, for whom he played for two seasons. In 1993–94, he played a career-high 80 games and averaged 8.0 points per game. He subsequently played one year for the Los Angeles Clippers, earning increased playing time and averaging 15.8 points per game. Due to a contract dispute and reports that Williams' asking price was too high, he could not find a team at the beginning of the 1996–97 season, sitting out most of the season. He was then signed by the Chicago Bulls nine games before the end of the season and became an important backup player in the Bulls' run to their fifth championship. He finished his career playing two seasons with the Detroit Pistons, where he set career highs of 16.2 points and 8.9 rebounds per game in 1997–98.\n\nIn 1998, he changed his name to Bison Dele to honor his Native American (Cherokee) and African ancestry, and played his final season under that name.\n\nDele, who was known for his eccentric behavior, suddenly retired from the NBA in an equally perplexing fashion. He retired before the start of the 1999–2000 season at age 30, when he was still in the prime of his career. He had been the Pistons' highest-paid player, but had strained relationships with the organization and decided to walk away from the remaining five years and US$36.45 million on his contract rather than be traded. It has also been theorized he had never been especially passionate about playing basketball and felt he had earned enough money to allow him to walk away from the pro game and lifestyle.\n\nDele reportedly dated Madonna at one point in his career. He played the saxophone, violin and trumpet, enjoyed adventure travel, and earned a pilot's licence. After his retirement he spent long periods traveling to Lebanon, the Mediterranean, and in Australia's Outback before learning to sail and purchasing a catamaran to sail the seven seas.\n\nOn July 6, 2002 Dele and his girlfriend, Serena Karlan, along with skipper Bertrand Saldo, sailed from Tahiti on Dele's catamaran, the \"Hukuna Matata\". Dele's brother, Miles Dabord (born Kevin Williams), was the only person involved in the voyage who was seen or heard from after July 8, 2002, when the last of three satellite phone calls from the voyage was made. Dele and Karlan had previously kept regular contact with their banks and family members. On July 20, Dabord brought the boat into Tahiti; he was alone aboard the vessel.\n\nOn September 5, 2002, police used a sting operation organized by Dele's family and friends to detain Dabord in Phoenix, Arizona. Dabord had forged Dele's signature in order to buy US$152,000 worth of gold under his brother's name, using Dele's passport as identification. Mexican police later found that Dabord had been staying at a hotel in Tijuana, Mexico. Two days before, the \"Hukuna Matata\", which had been registered in Tahiti under another name, was found off the coast of Tahiti with its name plate removed and some possible bullet holes patched. About the same time, Dabord phoned his mother, Patricia Phillips, telling her that he would never hurt Dele and that he could not survive in prison.\n\nThe FBI and French authorities became involved in the investigation, and concluded that Dele, Karlan and Saldo were probably murdered and then thrown overboard, or forced to walk off the boat into the ocean, by Dabord. Given that the bodies were likely dumped in the middle of the Pacific Ocean, it would be highly unlikely that the three would ever be found.\n\nDabord, the only first-person source of information regarding the case, intentionally overdosed on insulin and slipped into a coma. On September 27, 2002, Dabord died in a California hospital. In his account of events, Dabord said he and his brother had fought, and that Karlan had been accidentally hit and died when her head struck part of the boat. When Saldo wanted to report her death, a panicked Dele killed him; Dabord then shot his brother in self-defense, threw the bodies overboard and subsequently fled back to the U.S. After Dabord's suicide, officials did not expect to find much more regarding the case. A memorial service was then held for both Dabord and Dele.\n\nThe brothers were frequently at odds with each other. After Dabord's death, his lawyer and lifelong best friend, Paul White, was questioned regarding his client but gave little information about what happened. Dabord had said that he knew for sure that Dele and Karlan were in French Polynesia, but not much more other than that he was trying to help Dele.\n\n\n"}

It leads to the more efficient use of chemicals, and to the improved health and safety, environmental, and economic benefits. Find the definition and the examples on www.chemicalleasing.org \n\nThe term Chemical Leasing is the name of a business model and is NOT the same thing as leasing of chemicals, although it may include leasing operations.\n\nThe producer mainly sells the functions performed by the chemical and the functional units, such as the number of pieces painted, are the main basis for payment. It is a business model in which a customer engages with a service provider in a strategic, long-term contract to supply and manage the customer’s chemical and related services. \n\nChemical Leasing applied in many companies, but sometimes under different names. Similar concepts: eco-efficient services, product-service systems, pay-per-use, circular-economy, performance-based, functional-based, service-oriented, chemicals-as-a-service, etc. In case of the doubt, it is better to check the official UNIDO definition of Chemical Leasing :\n\n\nChemical leasing promotes the sustainable management of chemicals. By shifting the focus from increasing the sales volume of chemicals towards a more value-added approach, it is an illustration of extended producer responsibility. The chemical company supplies chemicals for a specific service, such as coatings, adhesives, washing agents, solvents, and also advises the user on its best use..\n\nBuilt on strong cooperation between partners and based on mutual trust, it increases the efficient use of chemicals, reduces the risks to human health brought about by their use, improves the economic and environmental performance of participating companies and ultimately enhances business performance.\n\nAt the Earth Summit 2002 on sustainable development, the international community agreed on the goal of ensuring that, by the year 2020, chemicals will be produced and used in ways that minimize significant adverse impacts on human health and the environment. As a consequence the United Nations Environmental Programme (UNEP) decided to develop of the Strategic Approach to International Chemicals Management (SAICM) in 2003. In 2006 at the International Conference on Chemicals Management (ICCM) in Dubai, the signing countries committed themselves to promote the sound management of chemicals and hazardous wastes at all levels.\n\nThe Austrian government has played an important role in promoting chemicals management based on resource efficiency and precaution. When Austria held the Presidency of the European Union during the first half of 2006, chemicals policy was on top of the environmental agenda. Austria continues to promote chemical leasing.\n\nThe Federal Environment Agency (UBA) of Germany proposed to promote chemical leasing in its \"Sustainable Chemicals\" paper. \n\nIn 2004, the United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO) and the Austrian Ministry of Environment decided to jointly support chemical leasing through a number of global projects. In partnership with National Cleaner Production Centers, UNIDO has implemented chemical leasing projects in Austria, Egypt, Mexico, and Russia. Since then, pilot projects have been conducted in Latin and South America, Africa, Europe and Asia. Nowadays, more than 100 companies worldwide have included Chemical Leasing in their business strategies. \n\nChemical Leasing can be applied in many industries and processes, ranging from car manufacturing to cleaning operations, wastewater treatment, textiles, beverage and food production. Some examples of the successful Chemical Leasing collaboration between the chemical user and the chemical supplier can be found here: http://chemicalleasing-toolkit.org/node/8 \n\nA Joint Declaration of Intent on Chemical Leasing was signed between UNIDO, Austria, Germany and Switzerland in November 2016.\n\nPERO Innovative Services GmbH together with SAFECHEM Europe GmbH, a subsidiary of The Dow Chemical Company, have supported Automobiltechnik Blau in metal cleaning to use cost-efficient machines, lower the energy consumption and chemical usage.\n\nAkzo Nobel Powder Coatings S.A.E has supported the chemical leasing of powder coating in Egypt to ABB ARAB. Environmental benefits are said to include recycling of powder waste, compliance with environmental regulations, and enhancement of supply chain management. \n\nFind more successful Chemical Leasing examples here: http://chemicalleasing-toolkit.org/node/8\n\nThe reversal of the burden of proof is a key component of the Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH) system leading to a \"no data – no market\" concept, obliging producers or importers of substances to deliver documentation regarding properties of chemicals and possible risks during their application as a pre-condition for market access. The OECD Conference in Vienna in 2003 Nov. reiterated that, \"... The new EU chemicals policy (REACH) will require a new relationship between provider and user ...\" According to Thomas Jakl, Chairman of the European Chemical Agency (ECHA), chemical leasing paves the way to comply with REACH obligations.\n\nChemical leasing and REACH share the same philosophy of ensuring compliance with a duty of care (REACH recital 16), as a tool to demonstrate adequate control (REACH para 60). They are mutually supportive in developing rules for sharing costs, and ensuring that chemicals are handled properly. Both are involve several different stages of the supply chain. There is a strong effort by the Austrian and German Governments to bring chemical leasing within the purview of EU Chemicals policy and regulations.\nChemical leasing projects are divided into planning, implementation, evaluation and dissemination stages, based on a Deming Cycle. The planning stage consists of a preparatory phase, a process optimisation phase and a design phase. In this stage, discussions around the leasing model, its cost implications versus quality and environmental benefits, commercial terms, and conditions begin. A baseline audit is performed, and a report presented to the factory management. This audit outlines the potential for improvements and forms the basis of defining the key performance indicators (KPIs). The resources needed to fulfil improvements are also defined.\n\nThe implementation stage starts with the signing of a chemical leasing agreement that defines the scope and conditions, unit of payment, KPIs, roles, and responsibilities. The chemical company supervises the chemical process, transporting and managing the inventory, laboratory management, improving process controls, record keeping, and training workers. Periodic checks and inspections are carried out independently to verify that the implementation is proceeding on expected lines. At the end of the implementation phase, progress is evaluated, often by an external party to secure objectivity. Finally, any project benefits are quantified and learning is documented, to provide input for future projects.\n\n16 January 2018 - The United Nations Industrial Development Organization announced the fourth Global Chemical Leasing Award. The award ceremony will take place on 6 November 2018 in Vienna, Austria. It will be part of the Green Chemistry Conference 2018 within the Trio Presidency of the Council of the European Union (EU) programme, “Smart and Sustainable Europe”, held during Austria’s EU Presidency.\n\nCompanies and individuals are invited to submit applications for the award in three categories: case studies (for companies), research, and special innovation. The call for applications is open until 15 August 2018. More information can be found at www.chemicalleasing.org\n\nThe Global Chemical Leasing Award has been launched in 2010. The Award intends to further enhance the global visibility of Chemical Leasing, acknowledge best practices and inspire companies and individuals around the globe to apply the Chemical Leasing business concept by reducing the inefficient use and over-consumption of chemicals and developing strong business partnerships and innovation along the entire supply chain.</ref> The awards took place in 2010 (Prague), in 2012 (Frankfurt-am-Main), and in 2014 (Vienna). \n\n\n"}

Cognitive models can be developed within or without a cognitive architecture, though the two are not always easily distinguishable.\n\nIn contrast to cognitive architectures, cognitive models tend to be focused on a single cognitive phenomenon or process (e.g. list learning), how two or more processes interact (e.g. visual search and decision making), or to make behavioral predictions for a specific task or tool (e.g. how instituting a new software package will affect productivity). Cognitive architectures tend to be focused on the structural properties of the modeled system, and help constrain the development of cognitive models within the architecture. Likewise, model development helps to inform limitations and shortcomings of the architecture. Some of the most popular architectures for cognitive modeling include ACT-R, Clarion, and Soar.\n\nCognitive modeling historically developed within cognitive psychology/cognitive science (including human factors), and has received contributions from the fields of machine learning and artificial intelligence to name a few. There are many types of cognitive models, and they can range from box-and-arrow diagrams to a set of equations to software programs that interact with the same tools that humans use to complete tasks (e.g., computer mouse and keyboard).\n\nA number of key terms are used to describe the processes involved in the perception, storage, and production of speech. Typically, they are used by speech pathologists while treating a child patient. The input signal is the speech signal heard by the child, usually assumed to come from an adult speaker. The output signal is the utterance produced by the child. The unseen psychological events that occur between the arrival of an input signal and the production of speech are the focus of psycholinguistic models. Events that process the input signal are referred to as input processes, whereas events that process the production of speech are referred to as output processes. Some aspects of speech processing are thought to happen online—that is, they occur during the actual perception\nor production of speech and thus require a share of the attentional resources dedicated to the speech task. Other processes, thought to happen offline, take place as part of the child's background mental processing rather than during the time dedicated to the speech task.\nIn this sense, online processing is sometimes defined as occurring in real-time, whereas offline processing is said to be time-free (Hewlett, 1990). In box-and-arrow psycholinguistic models, each hypothesized level of representation or processing can be represented in a diagram by a “box,” and the relationships between them by “arrows,” hence the name. Sometimes (as in the models of Smith, 1973, and Menn, 1978, described later in this paper) the arrows represent processes additional to those shown in boxes. Such models make explicit the hypothesized information-\nprocessing activities carried out in a particular cognitive function (such as language), in a manner analogous to computer flowcharts that depict the processes and decisions carried out by a computer program. Box-and-arrow models differ widely in the number of unseen psychological processes they describe and thus in the number of boxes they contain. Some have only one or two boxes between the input and output signals (e.g., Menn, 1978; Smith, 1973), whereas others have multiple boxes representing complex relationships between a number of different information-processing events (e.g., Hewlett, 1990; Hewlett, Gibbon, & Cohen- McKenzie,1998; Stackhouse & Wells, 1997). The most important box, however, and the source of much ongoing debate, is that representing the underlying representation (or UR). In essence, an underlying representation captures information stored in a child's mind about a word he or she knows and uses. As the following description of several models will illustrate, the nature of this information and thus the type(s) of representation present in the child's knowledge base have captured the attention of researchers for some time. (Elise Baker et al. Psycholinguistic Models of Speech Development and Their Application to Clinical Practice. Journal of Speech, Language, and Hearing Research. June 2001. 44. p 685–702.)\n\nA computational model is a mathematical model in computational science that requires extensive computational resources to study the behavior of a complex system by computer simulation. The system under study is often a complex nonlinear system for which simple, intuitive analytical solutions are not readily available. Rather than deriving a mathematical analytical solution to the problem, experimentation with the model is done by changing the parameters of the system in the computer, and studying the differences in the outcome of the experiments. Theories of operation of the model can be derived/deduced from these computational experiments.\nExamples of common computational models are weather forecasting models, earth simulator models, flight simulator models, molecular protein folding models, and neural network models.\n. expressed in characters, usually nonnumeric, that require translation before they can be used\n\"subsymbolic\" if it is made by constituent entities that are not representations in their turn, e.g., pixels, sound images as perceived by the ear, signal samples; subsymbolic units in neural networks can be considered particular cases of this category\nHybrid computers are computers that exhibit features of analog computers and digital computers. The digital component normally serves as the controller and provides logical operations, while the analog component normally serves as a solver of differential equations. See more details at hybrid intelligent system.\nIn the traditional computational approach, representations are viewed as static structures of discrete symbols. Cognition takes place by transforming static symbol structures in discrete, sequential steps. Sensory information is transformed into symbolic inputs, which produce symbolic outputs that get transformed into motor outputs. The entire system operates in an ongoing cycle.\n\nWhat is missing from this traditional view is that human cognition happens continuously and in real time. Breaking down the processes into discrete time steps may not fully capture this behavior. An alternative approach is to define a system with (1) a state of the system at any given time, (2) a behavior, defined as the change over time in overall state, and (3) a state set or state space, representing the totality of overall states the system could be in. The system is distinguished by the fact that all of these states belong together. A change in any aspect of the system depends on other aspects of the system.\n\nA typical dynamical model is formalized by several differential equations that describe how the system's state changes over time. By doing so, the form of the space of possible trajectories and the internal and external forces that shape a specific trajectory that unfold over time, instead of the physical nature of the underlying mechanisms that manifest this dynamics, carry explanatory force. On this dynamical view, parametric inputs alter the system's intrinsic dynamics, rather than specifying an internal state that describes some external state of affairs.\n\nEarly work in the application of dynamical systems to cognition can be found in the model of Hopfield networks. These networks were proposed as a model for associative memory. They represent the neural level of memory, modeling systems of around 30 neurons which can be in either an on or off state. By letting the network learn on its own, structure and computational properties naturally arise. Unlike previous models, “memories” can be formed and recalled by inputting a small portion of the entire memory. Time ordering of memories can also be encoded. The behavior of the system is modeled with vectors which can change values, representing different states of the system. This early model was a major step toward a dynamical systems view of human cognition, though many details had yet to be added and more phenomena accounted for.\n\nBy taking into account the evolutionary development of the human nervous system and the similarity of the brain to other organs, Elman proposed that language and cognition should be treated as a dynamical system rather than a digital symbol processor. Neural networks of the type Elman implemented have come to be known as Elman networks. Instead of treating language as a collection of static lexical items and grammar rules that are learned and then used according to fixed rules, the dynamical systems view defines the lexicon as regions of state space within a dynamical system. Grammar is made up of attractors and repellers that constrain movement in the state space. This means that representations are sensitive to context, with mental representations viewed as trajectories through mental space instead of objects that are constructed and remain static. Elman networks were trained with simple sentences to represent grammar as a dynamical system. Once a basic grammar had been learned, the networks could then parse complex sentences by predicting which words would appear next according to the dynamical model.\n\nA classic developmental error has been investigated in the context of dynamical systems: The A-not-B error is proposed to be not a distinct error occurring at a specific age (8 to 10 months), but a feature of a dynamic learning process that is also present in older children. Children 2 years old were found to make an error similar to the A-not-B error when searching for toys hidden in a sandbox. After observing the toy being hidden in location A and repeatedly searching for it there, the 2-year-olds were shown a toy hidden in a new location B. When they looked for the toy, they searched in locations that were biased toward location A. This suggests that there is an ongoing representation of the toy's location that changes over time. The child's past behavior influences its model of locations of the sandbox, and so an account of behavior and learning must take into account how the system of the sandbox and the child's past actions is changing over time.\n\nOne proposed mechanism of a dynamical system comes from analysis of continuous-time recurrent neural networks (CTRNNs). By focusing on the output of the neural networks rather than their states and examining fully interconnected networks, three-neuron central pattern generator (CPG) can be used to represent systems such as leg movements during walking. This CPG contains three motor neurons to control the foot, backward swing, and forward swing effectors of the leg. Outputs of the network represent whether the foot is up or down and how much force is being applied to generate torque in the leg joint. One feature of this pattern is that neuron outputs are either off or on most of the time. Another feature is that the states are quasi-stable, meaning that they will eventually transition to other states. A simple pattern generator circuit like this is proposed to be a building block for a dynamical system. Sets of neurons that simultaneously transition from one quasi-stable state to another are defined as a dynamic module. These modules can in theory be combined to create larger circuits that comprise a complete dynamical system. However, the details of how this combination could occur are not fully worked out.\n\nModern formalizations of dynamical systems applied to the study of cognition vary. One such formalization, referred to as “behavioral dynamics”, treats the agent and the environment as a pair of coupled dynamical systems based on classical dynamical systems theory. In this formalization, the information from the environment informs the agent's behavior and the agent's actions modify the environment. In the specific case of perception-action cycles, the coupling of the environment and the agent is formalized by two functions. The first transforms the representation of the agents action into specific patterns of muscle activation that in turn produce forces in the environment. The second function transforms the information from the environment (i.e., patterns of stimulation at the agent's receptors that reflect the environment's current state) into a representation that is useful for controlling the agents actions. Other similar dynamical systems have been proposed (although not developed into a formal framework) in which the agent's nervous systems, the agent's body, and the environment are coupled together\n\nBehavioral dynamics have been applied to locomotive behavior. Modeling locomotion with behavioral dynamics demonstrates that adaptive behaviors could arise from the interactions of an agent and the environment. According to this framework, adaptive behaviors can be captured by two levels of analysis. At the first level of perception and action, an agent and an environment can be conceptualized as a pair of dynamical systems coupled together by the forces the agent applies to the environment and by the structured information provided by the environment. Thus, behavioral dynamics emerge from the agent-environment interaction. At the second level of time evolution, behavior can be expressed as a dynamical system represented as a vector field. In this vector field, attractors reflect stable behavioral solutions, where as bifurcations reflect changes in behavior. In contrast to previous work on central pattern generators, this framework suggests that stable behavioral patterns are an emergent, self-organizing property of the agent-environment system rather than determined by the structure of either the agent or the environment.\n\nIn an extension of classical dynamical systems theory, rather than coupling the environment's and the agent's dynamical systems to each other, an “open dynamical system” defines a “total system”, an “agent system”, and a mechanism to relate these two systems. The total system is a dynamical system that models an agent in an environment, whereas the agent system is a dynamical system that models an agent's intrinsic dynamics (i.e., the agent's dynamics in the absence of an environment). Importantly, the relation mechanism does not couple the two systems together, but rather continuously modifies the total system into the decoupled agent's total system. By distinguishing between total and agent systems, it is possible to investigate an agent's behavior when it is isolated from the environment and when it is embedded within an environment. This formalization can be seen as a generalization from the classical formalization, whereby the agent system can be viewed as the agent system in an open dynamical system, and the agent coupled to the environment and the environment can be viewed as the total system in an open dynamical system.\n\nIn the context of dynamical systems and embodied cognition, representations can be conceptualized as indicators or mediators. In the indicator view, internal states carry information about the existence of an object in the environment, where the state of a system during exposure to an object is the representation of that object. In the mediator view, internal states carry information about the environment which is used by the system in obtaining its goals. In this more complex account, the states of the system carries information that mediates between the information the agent takes in from the environment, and the force exerted on the environment by the agents behavior. The application of open dynamical systems have been discussed for four types of classical embodied cognition examples: \nThe interpretations of these examples rely on the following logic: (1) the total system captures embodiment; (2) one or more agent systems capture the intrinsic dynamics of individual agents; (3) the complete behavior of an agent can be understood as a change to the agent's intrinsic dynamics in relation to its situation in the environment; and (4) the paths of an open dynamical system can be interpreted as representational processes. These embodied cognition examples show the importance of studying the emergent dynamics of an agent-environment systems, as well as the intrinsic dynamics of agent systems. Rather than being at odds with traditional cognitive science approaches, dynamical systems are a natural extension of these methods and should be studied in parallel rather than in competition.\n\n\n"}

In 1995, he received a Ph.D. in Molecular Genetics from the same school, focusing on gene regulation in yeast. In 1993 he met Leonard P. Guarente, an Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor who studied genes involved in the regulation of aging, when Guarente was on a lecture tour in Australia, and the meeting spurred Sinclair to apply for a post-doc position in Guarente's lab. Earlier that year Cynthia Kenyon's lab at UCSF had discovered that a single-gene mutation in (Daf-2) could double the lifespan of \"C. elegans\".\n\nIn 1999 Sinclair was hired at Harvard Medical School. In 2003 his lab was small and struggling for funding. In 2004 Sinclair met with the philanthropist Paul F. Glenn who donated $5 million to Harvard to establish the Paul F. Glenn Laboratories for the Biological Mechanisms of Aging at Harvard, of which Sinclair became the founding Director. He currently serves as the co-Director with Bruce Yankner.\n\nIn 2004 Sinclair, along with serial entrepreneur Andrew Perlman, Christoph Westphal, Richard Aldrich, Richard Pops, and Paul Schimmel, founded Sirtris Pharmaceuticals. Sirtris was focused on developing Sinclair's research into activators of sirtuins, work that began in the Guarente lab. The company was specifically focused on resveratrol formulations and derivatives as activators of the SIRT1 enzyme; Sinclair became known for making statements about resveratrol like: “(It's) as close to a miraculous molecule as you can find... One hundred years from now, people will maybe be taking these molecules on a daily basis to prevent heart disease, stroke, and cancer.” Most of the anti-aging field was more cautious, especially with regard to what else resveratrol might do in the body and its lack of bioavailability. The company's initial product was called SRT501, and was a formulation of resveratrol.; Sirtris went public in 2007 and was subsequently purchased and made a subsidiary of GlaxoSmithKline in 2008 for $720 million.\n\nIn 2006 Genocea Biosciences was founded based on work of Harvard scientist Darren E. Higgins around antigens that stimulate T cells and the use of these antigens to create vaccines; Sinclair was a co-founder.\n\nIn 2008, Sinclair was promoted to tenured professor at Harvard Medical School. He also became a professor at the University of New South Wales. \n\nIn 2008 Sinclair joined the scientific advisory board of Shaklee and helped them devise and introduce a product containing resveratrol called \"Vivix\"; after the \"Wall Street Journal\" requested an interview about his work with the company and its marketing, he disputed the use of his name and words to promote the supplement, and resigned.\n\nIn 2011, Sinclair was a co-founder of OvaScience with Michelle Dipp (who had been involved with Sirtris), Aldrich, Westphal, and Jonathan Tilly, based on scientific work done by Tilly concerning mammalian oogonial stem cells and work on mitochondria by Sinclair. Tilly's work was controversial, with some groups unable to replicate it.\n\nIn 2011 Sinclair was also a co-founder of CohBar, along with Nir Barzilai and other colleagues; CoBar aimed to discover and develop novel peptides derived from mitochondria. \n\nIn 2015 Sinclair described to \"The Scientist\" his efforts to get funding for his lab, how his lab grew to around 20 people, shrunk back down to about 5, and then grew again as he brought in funding from philanthropic organizations and companies, including companies that he helped to start. As of 2015 his lab had 22 people and was supported by one R01 grant and was 75% funded by non-federal funds. \n\nIn 2018 Sinclair was made an Officer of the Order of Australia (AO) for \"distinguished service to medical research into the biology of ageing and lifespan extension, as a geneticist and academic, to biosecurity initiatives, and as an advocate for the study of science\".\n\nWhile Sinclair was in Guarente's lab, he discovered that Sirtuin 1 (called \"sir2\" in yeast) slows aging in yeast by reducing the accumulation of extrachromosomal rDNA circles. Others working in the lab at the time identified NAD as an essential cofactor for sirtuin function. In 2002 after he had left for Harvard, he clashed with Guarente at a scientific meeting at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, challenging Guarante's description of how \"sir2\" might be involved in aging; this set off a scientific rivalry.\n\nIn 2003, when his lab was still small, Sinclair learned that scientists at a Pennsylvania biotech company called Biomol Research Laboratories discovered that polyphenols including resveratrol could activate \"sir2\", and he collaborated with them to confirm this. This led to publications authored in part by Sinclair in both \"Nature\" and \"Science\" in 2003. Sinclair's outspoken advocacy for resveratrol as an anti-aging compound started a scientific controversy over whether this was true, and whether resveratrol even activated sirtuins. Work in another lab, done partially funding from Sirtris, found increases in the number of mitochondria in the cells of mice given high doses of resveratrol. Sinclair's lab continued to work on reservatrol and analogs of it, as well as on mitochondria and NAD, all directed to understanding aging and how to prevent it.\n"}
{"id": "3157035", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3157035", "title": "Death drive", "text": "Death drive\n\nIn classical Freudian psychoanalytic theory, the death drive () is the drive toward death and self-destruction. It was originally proposed by Sabina Spielrein in her paper \"Destruction as the Cause of Coming Into Being\" (\"Die Destruktion als Ursache des Werdens\") in 1912, which was then taken up by Sigmund Freud in 1920 in \"Beyond the Pleasure Principle.\" This concept has been translated as \"opposition between the ego or death instincts and the sexual or life instincts\". In \"Pleasure Principle\", Freud used the plural \"death drives\" (\"Todestriebe\") much more frequently than in the singular.\n\nThe death drive opposes Eros, the tendency toward survival, propagation, sex, and other creative, life-producing drives. The death drive is sometimes referred to as \"Thanatos\" in post-Freudian thought, complementing \"Eros\", although this term was not used in Freud's own work, being rather introduced by Wilhelm Stekel in 1909 and then by Paul Federn in the present context.\n\nThe Standard Edition of Freud's works in English confuses two terms that are different in German, \"Instinkt\" (\"instinct\") and \"Trieb\" (\"drive\"), often translating both as \"instinct\"; for example, \"the hypothesis of a \"death instinct\", the task of which is to lead organic life back into the inanimate state\". \"This equating of \"instinkt\" and \"Trieb\" has created serious misunderstandings\". Freud actually refers to the term \"instinkt\" in explicit use elsewhere, and so while the concept of \"instinct\" can loosely be referred to as a \"drive,\" any essentialist or naturalist connotations of the term should be put in abeyance. In a sense, the death drive is a force that is not essential to the life of an organism (unlike an \"instinct\") and tends to denature it or make it behave in ways that are sometimes counter-intuitive. In other words, the term death \"drive\" is simply a false representation of death instinct. The term is almost universally known in scholarly literature on Freud as the \"death drive\", and Lacanian psychoanalysts often shorten it to simply \"drive\" (although Freud posited the existence of other drives as well, and Lacan explicitly states in Seminar XI that all drives are partial to the death drive). The contemporary Penguin translations of Freud translate \"Trieb\" and \"Instinkt\" as \"drive\" and \"instinct\" respectively.\n\nIt was a basic premise of Freud's that \"the course taken by mental events is automatically regulated by the pleasure principle...[associated] with an avoidance of unpleasure or a production of pleasure\". Three main types of conflictual evidence, difficult to explain satisfactorily in such terms, led Freud late in his career to look for another principle in mental life \"beyond\" the pleasure principle—a search that would ultimately lead him to the concept of the death drive.\n\nThe first problem Freud encountered was the phenomenon of repetition in (war) trauma. When Freud worked with people with trauma (particularly the trauma experienced by soldiers returning from World War I), he observed that subjects often tended to repeat or re-enact these traumatic experiences: \"dreams occurring in traumatic have the characteristic of repeatedly bringing the patient back into the situation of his accident\", contrary to the expectations of the pleasure principle.\n\nA second problematic area was found by Freud in children's play (such as the \"Fort/Da\" [Forth/here] game played by Freud's grandson, who would stage and re-stage the disappearance of his mother and even himself). \"How then does his repetition of this distressing experience as a game fit in with the pleasure principle?\"\n\nThe third problem came from clinical practice. Freud found his patients, dealing with painful experiences that had been repressed, regularly \"obliged to \"repeat\" the repressed material as a contemporary experience instead of [...] \"remembering\" it as something belonging to the past\". Combined with what he called \"the compulsion of destiny [...] come across [in] people all of whose human relationships have the same outcome\", such evidence led Freud \"to justify the hypothesis of a compulsion to repeat—something that would seem more primitive, more elementary, more instinctual than the pleasure principle which it over-rides\".\n\nHe then set out to find an explanation of such a compulsion; in Freud's own words, \"What follows is speculation, often far-fetched speculation, which the reader will consider or dismiss according to his individual predilection\". Seeking a new instinctual paradigm for such problematic repetition, he found it ultimately in \"an urge in organic life to restore an earlier state of things\"—the inorganic state from which life originally emerged. From the conservative, restorative character of instinctual life, Freud derived his death drive, with its \"pressure towards death\", and the resulting \"separation of the death instincts from the life instincts\" seen in Eros. The death drive then manifested itself in the individual creature as a force \"whose function is to assure that the organism shall follow its own path to death\".\n\nSeeking further potential clinical support for the existence of such a self-destructive force, Freud found it through a reconsideration of his views of masochism—previously \"regarded as sadism that has been turned round upon the subject's own ego\"—so as to allow that \"there \"might\" be such a thing as primary masochism—a possibility which I had contested\" before. Even with such support, however, he remained very tentative to the book's close about the provisional nature of his theoretical construct: what he called \"the whole of our artificial structure of hypotheses\".\n\nAlthough Spielrein's paper was published in 1912, Freud initially resisted the concept as he considered it to be too Jungian. Nevertheless, Freud eventually adopted the concept, and in later years would build extensively upon the tentative foundations he had set out in \"Beyond the Pleasure Principle\". In \"The Ego and the Id\" (1923) he would develop his argument to state that \"the death instinct would thus seem to express itself—though probably only in part—as an \"instinct of destruction\" directed against the external world\". The following year he would spell out more clearly that the \"libido has the task of making the destroying instinct innocuous, and it fulfils the task by diverting that instinct to a great extent outwards [...]. The instinct is then called the destructive instinct, the instinct for mastery, or the will to power\", a perhaps much more recognisable set of manifestations.\n\nAt the close of the decade, in \"Civilization and Its Discontents\" (1930), Freud acknowledged that \"To begin with it was only tentatively that I put forward the views I have developed here, but in the course of time they have gained such a hold upon me that I can no longer think in any other way\".\n\nFrom a philosophical perspective, the death drive may be viewed in relation to the work of the German philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer. His philosophy, expounded in \"The World as Will and Representation\" (1818) postulates that all exists by a metaphysical \"will\" (more clearly, a will to live), and that pleasure affirms this will. Schopenhauer's pessimism led him to believe that the affirmation of the \"will\" was a negative and immoral thing, due to his belief of life producing more suffering than happiness. The death drive would seem to manifest as a natural and psychological negation of the \"will\".\n\nFreud was well aware of such possible linkages. In a letter of 1919, he wrote that regarding \"the theme of death, [that I] have stumbled onto an odd idea via the drives and must now read all sorts of things that belong to it, for instance Schopenhauer\". Indeed, Ernest Jones (who like many analysts was not convinced of the need for the death drive, over and above an instinct of aggression) considered that \"Freud seemed to have landed in the position of Schopenhauer, who taught that 'death is the goal of life'\".\n\nHowever, as Freud put it to the imagined auditors of his \"New Introductory Lectures\" (1932), \"You may perhaps shrug your shoulders and say: \"That isn't natural science, it's Schopenhauer's philosophy!\" But, ladies and gentlemen, why should not a bold thinker have guessed something that is afterwards confirmed by sober and painstaking detailed research?\" He then went on to add that \"what we are saying is not even genuine Schopenhauer...we are not overlooking the fact that there is life as well as death. We recognise two basic instincts and give each of them its own aim\".\n\nFreud applied his new theoretical construct in \"Civilization and Its Discontents\" (1930) to the difficulties inherent in Western civilization—indeed, in civilization and in social life as a whole. In particular, given that \"a portion of the [death] instinct is diverted towards the external world and comes to light as an instinct of aggressiveness', he saw 'the inclination to aggression [...] [as] the greatest impediment to civilization\". The need to overcome such aggression entailed the formation of the [cultural] superego: \"We have even been guilty of the heresy of attributing the origin of conscience to this diversion inwards of aggressiveness\". The presence thereafter in the individual of the superego and a related sense of guilt—\"Civilization, therefore, obtains mastery over the individual's dangerous desire for aggression by [...] setting up an agency within him to watch over it\"—leaves an abiding sense of uneasiness inherent in civilized life, thereby providing a structural explanation for 'the suffering of civilized man'.\n\nFreud made a further connection between group life and innate aggression, where the former comes together more closely by directing aggression to other groups, an idea later picked up by group analysts like Wilfred Bion.\n\nIn the closing decade of Freud's life, it has been suggested, his view of the death drive changed somewhat, with \"the stress much more upon the death instinct's manifestations \"outwards\"\". Given \"the ubiquity of non-erotic aggressivity and destructiveness\", he wrote in 1930, \"I adopt the standpoint, therefore, that the inclination to aggression is an original, self-subsisting instinctual disposition in man\".\n\nIn 1933 he conceded of his original formulation of the death drive 'the improbability of our speculations. A queer instinct, indeed, directed to the destruction of its own organic home!'. He wrote moreover that \"Our hypothesis is that there are two essentially different classes of instincts: the sexual instincts, understood in the widest sense—Eros, if you prefer that name—and the aggressive instincts, whose aim is destruction\". In 1937, he went so far as to suggest privately that 'We should have a neat schematic picture if we supposed that originally, at the beginning of life, all libido was directed to the inside and all aggressiveness to the outside'. In his last writings, it was the contrast of \"two basic instincts, \"Eros\" and \"the destructive instinct\" [...] our two primal instincts, \"Eros\" and \"destructiveness\", on which he laid stress. Nevertheless, his belief in \"the death instinct [...] [as] a return to an earlier state [...] into an inorganic state\" continued to the end.\n\nAs Freud wryly commented in 1930, \"The assumption of the existence of an instinct of death or destruction has met with resistance even in analytic circles\". Indeed, Ernest Jones would comment of \"Beyond the Pleasure Principle\" that the book not only \"displayed a boldness of speculation that was unique in all his writings\" but was \"further noteworthy in being the only one of Freud's which has received little acceptance on the part of his followers\".\n\nOtto Fenichel in his compendious survey of the first Freudian half-century concluded that \"the facts on which Freud based his concept of a death instinct in no way necessitate the assumption [...] of a genuine self-destructive instinct\". Heinz Hartmann set the tone for ego psychology when he \"chose to [...] do without 'Freud's other, mainly biologically oriented set of hypotheses of the \"life\" and \"death instincts\"'\". In the object relations theory, among the independent group 'the most common repudiation was the loathsome notion of the death instinct'. Indeed, \"for most analysts Freud's idea of a primitive urge towards death, of a primary masochism, was [...] bedevilled by problems\".\n\nNevertheless, the concept has been defended, extended, and carried forward by some analysts, generally those tangential to the psychoanalytic mainstream; while among the more orthodox, arguably of \"those who, in contrast to most other analysts, take Freud's doctrine of the death drive seriously, K. R. Eissler has been the most persuasive—or least unpersuasive\".\n\nMelanie Klein and her immediate followers considered that \"the infant is exposed from birth to the anxiety stirred up by the inborn polarity of instincts—the immediate conflict between the life instinct and the death instinct\"; and Kleinians indeed built much of their theory of early childhood around the outward deflection of the latter. \"This deflection of the death instinct, described by Freud, in Melanie Klein's view consists partly of a projection, partly of the conversion of the death instinct into aggression\".\n\nFrench psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan, for his part, castigated the \"refusal to accept this culminating point of Freud's doctrine [...] by those who conduct their analysis on the basis of a conception of the \"ego\" [...] that death instinct whose enigma Freud propounded for us at the height of his experience\". Characteristically, he stressed the linguistic aspects of the death drive: \"the symbol is substituted for death in order to take possession of the first swelling of life [...]. There is therefore no further need to have recourse to the outworn notion of primordial masochism in order to understand the reason for the repetitive games in [...] his \"Fort!\" and in his \"Da!\".\"\n\nEric Berne too would proudly proclaim that he, \"besides having repeated and confirmed the conventional observations of Freud, also believes right down the line with him concerning the death instinct, and the pervasiveness of the repetition compulsion\".\n\nFor the twenty-first century, \"the death drive today [...] remains a highly controversial theory for many psychoanalysts [...] [almost] as many opinions as there are psychoanalysts\".\n\nFreud's conceptual opposition of death and eros drives in the human psyche was applied by Walter A. Davis in \"Deracination: Historicity, Hiroshima, and the Tragic Imperative\" and \"Death's Dream Kingdom: The American Psyche since 9/11.\" Davis described social reactions to both Hiroshima and 9/11 from the Freudian viewpoint of the death force. Unless they consciously take responsibility for the damage of those reactions, Davis claims that Americans will repeat them.\n\n\n"}

The 13-year-old schoolboy left his home in Ballyroan to return to school, but has not been seen since. A large-scale investigation was carried out but no trace of the boy has ever been found. His disappearance is now treated as a high-profile child murder case, the only similar incident in Ireland being the murder of Robert Holohan in January 2005. It is one of the most high-profile disappearances in recent Irish history.\n\nPhilip's family have issued numerous appeals for information. A reconstruction took place in 2007 and was later televised on RTÉ One, while a reward of €10,000 has also been offered. The book, \"When Heaven Waits\", published in 2007, featured an interview with Philip's mother. Nobody has ever been arrested. The case remains open.\n\nPhilip Cairns disappeared while returning to school in Rathfarnham. He had departed Coláiste Éanna secondary school at 12:45 to go home for lunch. He left his home at 13:30 to return to Coláiste Éanna. There have been no confirmed sightings of the boy since. His family believe he was abducted by someone who knew him personally.\n\nSpeculation at his school the day after his disappearance had Philip being kidnapped by a \"bad man\" who had offered him sweets then lured him into a van.\n\nSeveral hundred Garda Síochána officers and divers took part in a large-scale search of forests, lakes, mountains and rivers. Psychics and clairvoyants were called in to assist. Posters were distributed by milk companies. Cairns' classmates were interviewed by Gardaí at the school during their mid-term holiday break the following week.\n\nSix days after his disappearance, Philip's school bag was located by two girls in an alley close to his house. The lane had already been searched, and the bag was not there at that time. The school bag was thought to hold vital clues, but nothing is known of how it came to be in the lane. It is thought the bag had been left there a short time previously. It was examined forensically but no clues were located. Philip's implements, including pens, pencils, copybook, maths textbook, school journal and his pencil case were within. Some of Philip's books were missing, including a geography book and two religion books. A forensic examination produced no clues as to Philip's whereabouts. Gardaí have sealed the bag and it is now locked in a safe.\n\nOver 400 sightings were reported in the aftermath of the boy's disappearance. In one, Philip was reportedly seen in Manchester in the United Kingdom after his disappearance. Each sighting was seriously investigated, but none led to Philip.\n\nPhilip's parents appeared regularly on the news and clutched what has now become a well-recognised picture of a smiling Philip in his Confirmation clothes of a blue jacket and a red rosette. This photo has been deemed a precursor to that of British infant Madeleine McCann, who disappeared in Portugal 21 years later. However, the family, unlike the McCanns, have been relatively private about their loss, speaking to the media on only a few occasions in the past 25 years. It has been reported that this is due to several inaccurate reports of the incident of which they have disapproved. Gardaí have, however, praised the media as a proven method for encouraging people to come forward with further information on the case each time an appeal is broadcast. Residents' organisation ACRA also launched an intense campaign to attempt to find Philip.\n\nSeveral theories have been reported by the media, most of which have been discounted by investigators. These have ranged from death by accident to Philip having been taken by extremists such as paedophiles and Satanists. One theory had a woman tell gardaí that her partner, an alleged paedophile, had killed Philip after abducting him. This was later declared a false allegation.\nDetectives based at Rathfarnham Garda Station have been reinvestigating the disappearance of Philip Cairns for several years. Several searches of land have been carried out in the years since the disappearance, often without the media being informed.\n\nIn October 2006, the Cairns family issued an appeal for information on the twentieth anniversary of the disappearance. They said they had not given up all hope of finding him alive. A special Mass was also held to mark the occasion. A further appeal for information was launched following the twenty-first anniversary of Philip's disappearance in 2007, when it emerged that over 50 people had approached investigators individually and had provided new lines of inquiry. That month saw a reconstruction of Philip's typical school route being broadcast on RTÉ One's \"Crimecall\" television series and the Irish Crimestoppers Trust offering a €10,000 reward for information. Within one day, over 80 people had been in contact with Gardaí or Crimestoppers in what was described as a \"tremendous response\".\n\nIn May 2009, a stretch of private, wooded south Dublin land near a golf club on the M50 motorway was searched by investigators. On 6 May, the area was sealed off and vegetation was cleared. Specialist equipment and finger tip examination techniques were used in an attempt to detect evidence of soil movement. A second search was carried out around 50 metres away later that month. An elderly woman from Dublin told Gardaí that Cairns was murdered and later buried at both sites. She said that a man she was in a relationship with some time before had confessed to killing Philip. Despite the involvement of geophysicists, the searches both proved to be a failure. The man is now a pensioner who lives in Rathfarnham but cannot be charged due to lack of evidence.\n\nIn May 2016 a woman contacted Gardaí to tell them that she suspected former DJ and convicted paedophile Eamonn Cooke of having killed Philip Cairns. Gardaí questioned Cooke and he was reported to have confirmed some details, but not to have revealed the location of Philip's body. He died in June 2016.\n\nIn August 2016 it was announced that DNA samples taken from Philips' schoolbag did not match Cooke, but he had not been ruled out as a suspect. Gardaí also sought to identify two people who may have left Philips' schoolbag in the laneway.\n\nPhilip's mother is Alice Cairns and his father was Philip Cairns, Snr. Alice is a grandmother now and lights a candle each evening in memory of her missing son. Philip has four sisters, Mary, Sandra, Helen and Suzanne. Sandra and Suzanne are active in organisations promoting missing children. He has one younger brother, Eoin, who was 11 years of age when Philip disappeared. Eoin has spoken of his memories of Philip which include childhood games of soccer, fishing and hurling.\n\nHis father, Phil, died on 6 July 2014 at Tallaght Hospital.\n\nThe disappearance of Philip Cairns affected the entire country. The case was particularly unusual because it happened in the early afternoon and prompted parents to fear for the safety of their children, even in broad daylight.\n\n"}

His hereditary patrimony was the rich Northern town Galich-Mersky. Shemyaka (1445, 1446–1447) was twice Grand Prince of Moscow.\n\nThe causes of the Muscovite Civil War waged in the second quarter of the 15th century are still disputed. No small part, however, was played by Dmitri Donskoi's will, which ran contrary to Rurikid dynastic custom whereby the throne would pass from an elder brother to a younger one (agnatic seniority), rather than from father to son (primogeniture). The testament provided for the accession of his son, Vasily I, which was still in keeping with the tradition of lateral succession since Vasily was the eldest of his generation.\n\nIn the event of Vasily having no surviving son at his death, his brother, Dmitry's second son, Yury of Zvenigorod, was to succeed as grand prince in Moscow. Upon Vasily I's death, however, Yury refused to come to Moscow and swear allegiance to his nephew, Vasily II, and claimed the throne himself in accordance with his right under the long-held custom of lateral inheritance. (He further claimed it was provided for in Dmitry's testament – but this ignored the provision that voided Yury's succession in the event of Vasily I producing a son). Yury's son, Dmitry Shemyaka, actively participated in all of his father's incursions against Moscow, culminating in Yury's capture of Moscow and accession as grand prince in 1433. Yury of Zvenigorod died in Moscow in 1434.\n\nAfter Yury's death, Shemyaka continued to press his branch's claim to the grand princely throne, and was seldom at peace with Vasily II. Initially, Dmitry and his younger brother Dmitry Krasnyi concluded an alliance with Vasily against their elder brother Vasily Kosoy, who had proclaimed himself grand prince. They succeeded in driving Kosoy from Moscow and were rewarded with the towns of Uglich and Rzhev. The following year Shemyaka came to Moscow in order to invite Vasily II to his impending wedding with a princess of Yaroslavl, but was accused of siding with Kosoy and taken prisoner. Released several months later, he was sent by Vasily II to defend Belyov against a small army of the Kazan Khan Olug Moxammat but was defeated. Thereupon he refused to support Vasily in his hostilities against the khan, and only the mediation of a Trinity hegumen could forestall a new civil war between the cousins.\n\nThe two men maintained an uneasy peace for much of the next decade until 1445, when Vasily II was taken prisoner by Olug Moxammat after the Muscovite forces were surprised by the Tatar prince outside Suzdal, Shemyaka seized Moscow, had the recently released Vasily blinded and proclaimed himself the Grand Prince of Vladimir. He could claim this by right of lateral inheritance since his father had sat on the throne. (A prince was excluded from the succession (izgoi) if his father had not sat on the throne before him.) Shemyaka's lack of support among the Muscovite boyars forced him, however, to leave the city for Lake Chukhloma, but he continued to press his claim to the grand princely throne.\n\nDespite several peace treaties, Shemyaka continued to plot against his cousin. He suffered a series of defeats in 1450 and 1452 which forced him to seek refuge in Novgorod. There, on July 17, 1453, he was poisoned while eating a dinner of chicken in the Gorodishche, the princely compound south of the Market side of the city, his cook having been bribed by Muscovite agents. Delighted at the news, Vasily II ennobled a herald who had first brought him the message of Shemyaka's death. Nikolai Karamzin famously wrote in his history that the grand prince showed \"indecent joy\" at the news of his rival's untimely demise.\n\nAccording to chronicle sources, Shemyaka was buried in the Church of St. George in the Yuriev Monastery south of Novgorod,\n\nIn the aftermath of Shemyaka's murder, his wife and son fled Novgorod to the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, where they were given Rylsk and Novgorod-Seversky in appanage.\n\nShemyaka's male line died out by 1561, but there are many living descendants from his daughter's marriage to Prince Alexander Chertoryzhsky.\n\nShemyaka's name survives in the Russian expression \"Shemyakin sud\" (\"Shemyaka's Justice\", \"Shemyaka's Judgement\"), which means hasty and unfair judgement. It comes from the 17th century literary work \"The Tale of Shemyaka's Judgement\" (see its translation here). However modern researchers question the identification of Dmitry Shemyaka with Judge Shemyaka in the tale. \n"}

Under these conditions a group of heterotrophic bacteria, called polyphosphate-accumulating organisms (PAO) are selectively enriched in the bacterial community within the activated sludge. These bacteria accumulate large quantities of polyphosphate within their cells and the removal of phosphorus is said to be \"enhanced\".\n\nGenerally speaking, all bacteria contain a fraction (1-2%) of phosphorus in their biomass due to its presence in cellular components, such as membrane phospholipids and DNA. Therefore, as bacteria in a wastewater treatment plant consume nutrients in the wastewater, they grow and phosphorus is incorporated into the bacterial biomass. When PAOs grow they not only consume phosphorus for cellular components but also accumulate large quantities of polyphosphate within their cells. Thus, the phosphorus fraction of phosphorus accumulating biomass is 5-7%. This biomass is then separated from the treated water at end of the process and the phosphorus is thus removed. Thus if PAOs are selectively enriched by the EBPR configuration, considerably more phosphorus is removed, compared to the relatively poor phosphorus removal in conventional activated sludge systems.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1969440", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1969440", "title": "Fluctuating asymmetry", "text": "Fluctuating asymmetry\n\nAs a form of biological asymmetry, fluctuating asymmetry (FA), along with anti-symmetry and direction asymmetry, refers to small, random deviations away from perfect bilateral symmetry. This deviation from perfection is thought to reflect the genetic and environmental pressures experienced throughout development, with greater pressures resulting in higher levels of asymmetry. Examples of FA in the human body include unequal sizes (asymmetry) of bilateral features in the face and body, such as left and right eyes, ears, wrists, breasts, testicles, and thighs.\n\nResearch has exposed multiple factors that are associated with FA. As measuring FA can indicate developmental stability, it can also suggest the genetic fitness of an individual. This can further have an effect on mate attraction and sexual selection, as less asymmetry reflects greater developmental stability and subsequent fitness. Human physical health is also associated with FA. For example, young men with greater FA report more medical conditions than those with lower levels of FA. Multiple other factors can be linked to FA, such as intelligence and personality traits.\n\nFluctuating asymmetry (FA) can be measured by the equation: Mean FA = mean absolute value of left sides - mean absolute value of right sides.\n\nThe closer the mean value is to zero, the lower the levels of FA, indicating more symmetrical features. By taking many measurements of multiple traits per individual, this increases the accuracy in determining that individual's developmental stability. However, these traits must be chosen carefully, as different traits are affected by different selection pressures.\n\nThis equation can further be used to study the distribution of asymmetries at population levels, to distinguish between traits that show FA, directional asymmetry, and anti-symmetry. The distribution of FA around a mean point of zero suggests that FA is not an adaptive trait, where symmetry is ideal. Directional asymmetry of traits can be distinguished by showing significantly biased measurements towards traits being larger on either the left or right sides, for example, human testicles (where the right is more commonly larger), or handedness (85% are right handed, 15% are left handed). Anti-symmetry can be distinguished by the bimodal distributions, due to some adaptive functions.\n\nFluctuating asymmetry (FA) is often considered to be the product of developmental stress and instability, caused by both genetic and environmental stressors. The notion that FA is a result of genetic and environmental factors is supported by Waddington's notion of canalisation, which implies that FA is a measure of the genome's ability to successfully buffer development to achieve a normal phenotype under imperfect environmental conditions. Various factors causing developmental instability and FA include infections, mutations, and toxins.\n\nResearch on twins suggests that there are genetic influences on FA, and increased levels of mutations and perturbations is also linked to greater asymmetry.\n\nFA may also result from a lack of genetic immunity to diseases, as those with higher FA show less effective immune responses. This is further supported by evidence showing an association between FA and the number of respiratory infections experienced by an individual, such that those with higher levels of FA experience more infections. Increased prevalence of parasites and diseases in an organism is also seen more in individuals with greater levels of FA. However, the research in this field is predominantly correlational, so caution must be taken when inferring causation. For example, rather than a lack of immunity causing FA, FA may weaken the immune responses of an organism, or there may be another factor involved.\n\nThere is some speculation that inbreeding contributes towards FA. One study on young Turkish males demonstrated that, although inbred individuals show more asymmetry in observed bilateral traits, the differences were not significant. Furthermore, ant colonies created by an inbreeding queen do not show significantly higher FA than those produced by a non-inbreeding queen.\n\nMultiple sources provide information on environmental factors that are correlated with FA. A meta-analysis of related studies suggests that FA is an appropriate marker of environmental stress during development.\n\nSome evidence suggests that poverty and lack of food during development may contribute to greater levels of FA. Infectious diseases can also lead to FA, as studies have repeatedly shown that those with higher FA report more infections. Alternatively, this association between levels of FA and infections may be due to a lack of immunity to diseases, as mentioned earlier (see 'Genetic factors'). Fluctuating asymmetry in human males is also seen to positively correlate with levels of oxidative stress. This process occurs when an organism creates excess reactive oxygen species (ROS) compared to ROS-neutralising antioxidants. Oxidative stress may mediate the association seen between high FA and infection amounts during development.\n\nToxins and poisons are considered to increase FA. Pregnancy sickness is argued to be an adaptation for avoiding toxins during foetal development. Research has reported that when a mother has no sickness or a sickness that extends beyond week 12 of gestation, the offspring shows higher FA (as demonstrated by measuring thigh circumferences). This suggests that when a mother fails to expel environmental toxins, this creates stress and developmental instability for the foetus, later leading to increased asymmetry in that individual. Greater exposure to pollution may also be a fundamental cause of FA. Research on skull characteristics of Baltic grey seals (\"Halichoerus grypus\") demonstrated that those born after 1960 (marking an increase in environmental pollution) had increased levels of asymmetry. Also, shrews (\"Crocidura russula)\" from more polluted areas show higher levels of asymmetry. Radioactive contamination may also increase FA levels, as mice (\"Apodemus flavicollis\") living closer to the failed Chernobyl reactor show greater asymmetry.\n\nDevelopmental stability is achieved when an organism is able to withstand genetic and environmental stress, to display the bilaterally symmetrical traits determined by its developmentally programmed phenotype. To measure an individual's developmental stability, the FA measurements of 10 traits are added together, including ear width, elbows, ankles, wrists, feet, length of ears and fingers. This is achieved by: (L - R)trait 1 + (L - R)trait 2 + ...(L - R)trait 10. This provides a good overall measure of body FA, as every individual has some features that are not perfectly symmetrical.\n\nCommon environmental pressures leading to lower developmental stability include exposure to toxins, poison and infectious diseases, low food quality and malnutrition. Genetic pressures include spontaneous new mutations, and \"bad genes\" (genes that once had adaptive functions, but are being removed through evolutionary selection). A large fluctuating asymmetry (FA) and a low developmental stability suggests that an organism is unable to develop according to the ideal state of bilateral symmetry. The energy required for bilateral symmetry development is extremely high, making perfect bilateral symmetry rare. Energy is invested into survival in spite of the genetic and environmental pressures, before making bilaterally symmetrical traits. Research has also revealed links between FA and depression, genetic or environmental stress and measures of mate quality for sexual selection.\n\nResearch has linked higher levels of fluctuating asymmetry (FA) to poorer outcomes in some domains of physical health in humans. For example, one study found that individuals with higher levels of FA report a higher number of medical conditions than those with lower levels of FA. However, they did not experience worse outcomes in areas such as systolic blood pressure or cholesterol levels. Higher levels of FA have also been linked to higher body mass index (BMI) in women, and lower BMI in men. Research has shown that both men and women with higher levels of FA, both facial and bodily, report a higher number of respiratory infections and a higher number of days ill, compared to men and women with lower levels of FA. In men, higher levels of FA have been linked to lower levels of physical attractiveness and higher levels of oxidative stress, regardless of smoking or levels of toxin exposure. There is no gender difference in the susceptibility of diseases depending on body FA.\n\nA large-scale review of the human and non-human literature by Møller found that higher levels of fluctuating asymmetry were linked to increased vulnerability to parasites, and also to lower levels of immunity to disease. A large-scale longitudinal study in Britain found that facial FA was not associated with poorer health over the course of childhood, which was interpreted as suggesting smaller effects of FA in Western societies with generally low levels of FA A review of the relationship between various attractiveness features and health in Western societies produced similar results, finding that symmetry was not related to health in either sex, but was related to attractiveness in males.\n\nIt has been suggested that individuals with lower levels of FA may engage in more biologically costly behaviours such as recreational drug use and risky body modifications such as piercings and tattoos. These ideas have been proposed in the context of Zahavi's handicap principle, which argues that highly costly behaviours or traits serve as signals of an organism's genetic quality. The relationship between FA and behaviours with high health risks has received mixed support. Individuals with body piercings and tattoos (which increase risk of blood-borne infections) have been shown to have lower levels of FA, but individuals with lower FA do not engage in any more recreational drug use than those with higher FA levels.\n\nHigher levels of FA have been linked to higher levels of some mental health difficulties. For instance, it has been shown that, among university students, higher FA is associated with higher levels of schizotypy. Depression scores have been found to be higher in men, but not women, with higher levels of FA. One study by Shackelford and Larsen found that men and women with higher facial asymmetry reported more physiological complaints than those with lower facial asymmetry, and that both men and women with higher asymmetry experienced higher levels of psychological distress overall. For example, men with higher facial asymmetry experienced higher levels of depression compared to men with lower facial asymmetry. Fluctuating asymmetry has also been studied in relation to psychopathy. One study looking at offenders and non-offenders found that, although offenders had higher levels of FA overall, psychopathic offenders had lower levels of FA compared to offenders who did not meet the criteria for psychopathy. Additionally, offenders with the highest levels of psychopathy were found to have similar levels of FA to non-offenders.\n\nResearch has also linked FA to conditions such as lower back pain, although the evidence is mixed. While one study found no notable link between pelvic asymmetry and lower back pain, other studies have found pelvic asymmetry (as well as FA in other traits not directly related to pelvic function) to be higher in patients experiencing lower back pain, and higher levels of FA have also been linked to congenital spinal problems. Studies have also shown increased levels of FA of ear length in individuals with cleft lip and/or non-syndromic cleft palate syndrome.<ref name=\"FA and CL/CP\"></ref>\n\nIn addition to general health and susceptibility to disease, research has also studied the link between FA and physical fitness. Research has found that lower levels of lower-body FA is associated with faster running speeds in Jamaican sprinters, and individuals with greater body asymmetry have been shown to move more asymmetrically while running, although do not experience higher metabolic costs than more symmetrical individuals. It has also been shown that children with lower levels of lower-body FA have faster sprinting speeds and are more willing to sprint when followed up in adulthood.\n\nThe relationship between FA, health and susceptibility to disease has also been studied in non-human animals. For example, studies have found that higher levels of facial asymmetry are associated with poorer overall health in female rhesus macaques (\"Macaca mulatta\"), and that higher FA is also linked to more health issues in chimpanzees (\"Pan troglodytes\").\n\nThe link between FA and health has also been investigated in non-primates. In three gazelle species (\"Gazella cuvieri; Gazella dama; Gazella dorcas\"), for instance, FA has been linked to a range of blood parameters associated with health in mammals, although the specific relevance of these blood parameters for these gazelle species was not examined. It has also been found that, among Iberian red deer (\"Cervus elaphus hispanicus\"), higher FA was slightly negatively related to both antler size and overall body mass (traits thought to indicate overall condition). Antlers more involved in fighting were found to be more symmetrical than those not involved, and antler asymmetry at reproductive age was lower than in development or at post-reproductive age.<ref name=\"FA and antler size/body mass\"></ref>\n\nFA and health outcomes have been examined within insect populations. For instance, it has been found that Mediterranean field crickets (\"Gryllus bimaculatus\") with higher levels of FA in three hind-limb traits have lower encapsulation rates, but do not differ from low-FA crickets in lytic activity (both are measures of immunocompetence). While research on the relationship between FA and longevity is sparse in humans, some studies using non-human populations have suggested an association between the symmetry of an organism and its lifespan. For instance, it has been found that flies whose wing veins showed more bilateral symmetry live longer than less symmetrical flies. This difference was greatest for male flies.\n\nSymmetry has been shown to affect physical attractiveness. Those with lower levels of fluctuating asymmetry (FA) are often rated as more attractive. Various studies have supported this. The relationship between FA and mate attraction has been studied in both males and females. As FA reflects developmental stability and quality, it has been suggested that we prefer those as more attractive/with low FA because it signals traits such as health and intelligence.\n\nResearch has shown that the female partners of men with lower levels of FA experience a higher number of copulatory orgasms, compared to the female partners of males with higher levels of FA. Other studies have also found that the voices of men and women with low fluctuating asymmetry are rated as more attractive, suggesting that voice may be indicative of developmental stability. Research has shown attractiveness ratings of men's scent are negatively correlated with FA, but FA is unrelated to attractiveness ratings for women's scent, and women's preferences for the scent of more symmetric men appears limited to the most fertile phases of the menstrual cycle. However, other research has failed to find changes in women's preferences for low FA across the menstrual cycle. Facial symmetry has been positively correlated with higher occurrences of mating. Also, one study used 3-D scans of male and female bodies, and showed videos of these scans to a group of individuals who rated the bodies on attractiveness. It was found that, for both males and females, lower levels of FA were associated with higher attractiveness ratings. It was also found that sex-typical joint configurations were rated as more attractive and linked to lower FA in men, but not women. Men with higher FA have been shown to have higher levels of oxidative stress and lower levels of attractiveness. Research has also provided evidence that FA is linked to extra-pair copulation, as women have been shown to prefer men with lower levels of FA as extra-pair partners. However, the literature is mixed regarding the relationship between attractiveness and FA. For example, in one study, altering images of faces to in a way that reduced asymmetry led to observers rating such faces as less, rather than more, attractive. Research by Van Dongen also found FA to be unrelated to attractiveness, physical strength and level of masculinity in both men and women.\nMany non-human animals have been shown to be able to distinguish between potential partners, based upon levels of FA. As with humans, lower levels of FA are seen in the most reproductively successful members of species. For instance, FA of male forewing length seem to have an important role in successful mating for many insect species, such as dark-wing damselflies and Japanese scorpionflies. In the dark-winged damselfly (\"Calopteryx maculate\"), successfully mating male flies showed significantly lower levels of FA in their forewings than unsuccessful males, while for Japanese scorpionflies, FA levels are a good predictor for the outcome of fights between males in that more symmetrical males won significantly more fights. Other animals also show similar patterns, for example, many species of butterfly, males with lower levels of FA tended to live longer and flew more actively, allowing them to have more reproductive success. Also, female swallows have been shown to prefer longer, and more symmetrical tails as a cue for mate choice. Therefore, the males with longer and more symmetrical tails show higher levels of reproductive success with more attractive females. In red deer, sexual selection has effected antler development, in that larger and more symmetrical antlers are favoured in males at prime mating age.\n\nHowever, some evidence for the effects of sexual selection of FA levels have been inconsistent, suggesting that the relationship between FA and sexual selection may be more complex than originally thought. For instance, in the lekking black grouse and red junglefowl, no correlations were found between FA and mating success. Furthermore, when manipulating paradise whydahs' tails to be more and less symmetrical, females showed no preferences for more symmetrical tails (but they did show preferences for longer tails).\n\nThrough research, fluctuating asymmetry (FA) has been found to have a negative correlation to measurements of human traits such as working memory and intelligence, such that individuals showing greater asymmetry have lower IQ scores. As FA links with both intelligence and facial attractiveness, it is possible that our perceptions of attractiveness have evolved based upon developmental quality, which includes traits such as intelligence and health. However, some literature shows no such correlations between FA and intelligence. A meta-analysis of the research covering this topic demonstrated that whilst published studies largely report negative correlations, unpublished studies often find no association between FA and intelligence.\n\nResearch into FA suggests that there may be some correlation to specific personality factors, in particular, the Big Five personality traits. From a general view, one would expect someone who is more symmetrical (usually meaning greater attractiveness), to be high on agreeableness, conscientiousness, extraversion and openness, and low on neuroticism. One of the most consistent findings reported is that low FA is positively associated with measures of extraversion, suggesting that more symmetrical people tend to be more extraverted than less symmetrical individuals, particularly when specifying to symmetry within the face. A correlation has also been reported between FA and human social dominance. However, research is proving less consistent with other personality factors, with some finding some weak correlations between low FA and conscientiousness and openness to experience, and others finding no significant differences between those with high or low FA.\n\nSome studies suggest a link between FA and aggression, but the evidence is mixed. In humans, criminal offenders show greater FA than nonoffenders. However, other studies report that human males with higher FA show less physical aggression and less anger. Females show no association between FA and physical aggression, but some research has suggested that older female adolescents with higher facial FA are less hostile. The type of aggression being studied may account for the mixed evidence that is seen here. For example, one study found that females with higher FA demonstrated higher levels of reactive aggression in response to high levels of provocation, whereas high FA males showed more reactive aggression under low levels of provocation.\n\nResearch is also mixed in other animals. In Japanese scorpionflies (\"Panorpa nipponensis\" and \"Panorpa ochraceopennis\"), FA differences between members of the same sex competing for food determines the outcome of interspecific contests and aggression better than body size or ownership of food. Furthermore, cannibalistic laying hens (\"Gallus gallus domesticus\") demonstrate more asymmetry than normal hens. However, this link between FA and aggression in hens is questionable, as victimised hens also showed greater asymmetry. Furthermore, when prenatally injecting hen eggs with excess serotonin (5-HT), the hens later exhibited more FA at 18 weeks of age, but displayed less aggressive behaviours. It is suggested that the stress introduced during early embryonic stages via certain factors (such as excess serotonin) may create developmental instability, causing phenotypic and behavioural variations (such as increased or decreased aggression).\n\nIn old age, facial symmetry has been associated with better cognitive aging, as lower levels of FA have been associated with higher intelligence and more efficient information processing in older men. Although, it has been found that risk of mortality cannot be predicted accurately from levels of FA in photographs of older adults.\n\nAdditionally, FA has been shown to predict atypical asymmetry of the brain. Research has also shown that growth rates after birth positively correlate with FA. For example, increased FA has been found in people who were currently obese.\n\n"}

{"id": "2692820", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2692820", "title": "Humanist Movement", "text": "Humanist Movement\n\nThe Humanist Movement is an international volunteer organisation that promotes nonviolence and non-discrimination. It is not an institution. It takes its inspiration from the current of thought referred to as New or Universal Humanism that has been developed since 1969 by its founder Mario Rodríguez Cobos, pen name: Silo.\n\nNew Humanism focuses on the overcoming of pain and suffering at a personal, interpersonal and social level. It defines violence as anything that causes pain and suffering to human beings. In this way violence is seen to have many different aspects, not just the well-known physical form but also; economic, religious, psychological, sexual, ethnic, etc.\n\nThe Humanist Movement's conception is based on the Siloist thought, the major points of which are the following:\nPrior to thinking about his origin or destiny, the human being finds himself in a determined vital situation, one not of his own choosing. Thus, he is born submerged in a natural and also a social world plagued by physical and mental aggression that he experiences as pain and suffering. Consequently, he mobilizes himself trying to overcome pain and suffering. \nIn his acting against these painful factors, he produces objects and signs which are incorporated into society and are transmitted historically. And all that is produced is loaded with meaning, with an intention and this intention is ultimately to surpass pain and suffering.\n\nThe history of mankind, then – of its economy, of its politics, of its science, of its art – is the history of the struggle against pain and suffering. And this struggle is the motor of the progress. This struggle is not between mechanical forces. It is not a natural reflection. It is a struggle between human intentions. And, precisely this is what enables one to speak of oppressors and oppressed, of just and unjust ones, of heroes and cowards. This is the only thing that enables one to rescue the personal subjectivity and is the only thing that enables one to practice with meaning the social solidarity and the commitment with the liberation of those discriminated against, be these majorities or minorities.\nAt this point, a definition of \"human being\" is a must. It will not suffice to say \"man is the social animal\" or \"man is the manufacturer of objects\" or \"man is the possessor of language\", etc. In the Siloist doctrine \"Man is the historical being whose mode of social action transforms his own nature.\"\n\nIn short, New Humanism is based on two basic points:\n\n\nThe project of the Humanist Movement is nothing less than to eradicate war, hunger, poverty and economic exploitation across the planet and develop a new system based on the value of human life as the central value, higher than money, power, prestige, etc. Siloists call this vision of the future the Universal Human Nation. The methodology used is to work in groups and undertake personal development activities as well as social projects. Once sufficiently experienced, new groups develop according to their interests.\n\nNew Humanists share the following humanist attitudes:\n\n\nNear the end of the 1960s, Silo organized a group to study the personal and social crisis occurring in the world. The group intends to give a global intellectual response to a world in crises which takes place in the social and personal fields. The personal and social crisis of the '60s demands responses that are not in sight and that requires previous pausing anew (reformulations) in which the intelectual prejudice must be eliminated. Three sectors of research are organised. \n1) that of daily and personal existence\n2) that of the social activity\n3) that of the methodology of the research\nthe group makes its own Kant's declaration: \"criticism, to which everything should be submitted, is characteristic of our ephoch: in vain try to escape from it religion for being saint and legislation for being majestic, since they would then arise founded suspicions upson trying to impede their thorough examination, rationally carried out.\n\nThis group, and others like it, organized around his writings, grew and developed into what started life as The School and after many iterations later became known as the Humanist Movement.\n\nThe Humanist Movement is often said to have been started May 4, 1969, with the talk \"The Healing of Suffering\" by Silo at Punta de Vacas, Argentina. Because of the military dictatorship in place at that time, this talk was permitted on the condition that it would be held high in the Andes Mountains, far from the nearest town.\n\nThese initial groups faced repression and disinformation campaigns as they grew and spread throughout Latin America. This growth was reinforced when some of the members, freely or as political exiles, took up residence in various countries in Europe, Asia and the Americas.\n\nIn 1975 one hundred members from different countries met in Corfu, Greece, to agree on proposals, objectives and a rudimentary organisation that would be tested over the next four years.\n\nBy 1980 the Movement was functioning in forty two countries. In 1981 The Community for Human Development organised a lecture tour around Europe and Asia. The Look Within, The Internal Landscape, and the Book of the Community were published and translated into many languages.\n\nIn 1983 the Movement was articulated into Councils (see Organisation) and a way of working was defined in a material called the Norms. In 1984 the Humanist Party was founded, followed by The Greens.\n\nAfter the launch of the Humanist International in 1989, the strategy turned once more to the development of the Humanist Movement in a more general form and its organisation structure. A stage of putting down roots in communities, with the opening of Centres of Communication and the publication of hundreds of neighbourhood newspapers around the world was started.\n\nIn 1993 the Document of the Humanist Movement was published. The first Humanist Forum was held in Moscow, Russia, and The World Center of Humanist Studies was founded.\n\nBy 1995 the direction of the Humanist Movement went towards a phase of massive growth with the opening up of 10s of new countries across Africa, Asia and the Caribbean. This mostly was made possible through the launching of the Centre of Cultures. In addition, from Spain the action front called World without Wars was legalised that later went on to become an official organisation of the Humanist Movement.\n\nBy 2006, the first Parks of Study and Reflection was launched around the world.\n\nIn 2009, the organisational structure articulated in 1983 was dissolved by Silo leaving behind 5 official organisations to represent the Humanist Movement's interests in various fields of human endeavour.\n\nOn 2 October 2009, until 2 January 2010, the World March for Peace and Nonviolence went around the world from New Zealand to Argentina calling for the eradication of Nuclear Weapons, the withdrawal of invading troops from foreign territories, the signing of peace treaties between countries in dispute, progressive and proportional conventional weapons disarmament and the implementation of articles in national constitutions to renounce the use of war as a means to resolve conflicts, such as Article 9 of the Japanese constitution. The World March was the initiative of the Humanist organisation, World without Wars and without Violence and was promoted around the world by Humanist and other organisations.\n\nThe Humanist Movement- defined as \"the organization that interprets the needs of the Human being and produces the means for advancing from the ground of determination to the ground of freedom\" should be framed as a broad and developing movement which generates specific base teams with a human base aiming at the same objective.\n\nThe organizational form of the Humanist Movement is constantly changing. Currently the movement is in a process of transformation of its organizational form and the form that was applied until now, is no longer valid. At the moment the Humanist Movement consists simply of all those who adhere to the Document of the Humanist Movement (1993) and there are no formal positions in the organization - rather all participants are simply colleagues.\n\nThe Humanist Movement has launched official organisations, internally referred to as organisms, in political, social and cultural fields, according to the legal requirements in the country where the Humanist Movement is being developed. The strategy of the Humanist Movement is to launch the following five organisms in every country in the world where it is possible to do so.\n\nThe Community for Human Development, launched in 1981, is a social and cultural organisation that works for \"nonviolence\" through simultaneous social and personal transformation i.e. through the transformation of the structures of society and the way that individuals act in the world.\n\nThe Community has the following objectives:\n\nThe Community works in society in the areas of education, health, culture, and quality of life. In each of these areas it denounces all that which hinders the development of the human being and develops actions that favour it.\n\nThe key characteristics of the work of The Community are:\n\nThe official documents of the Community can be found in the Book of the Community.\n\nThe idea of the Humanist Party as a political party was launched on March 8, 1984, as a recommendation from the Department of Social Affairs of The Community for Human Development. Around the world many Humanist Parties started to emerge and on January 4, 1989, in Florence, Italy, the first congress of the Humanist International was held.\n\nIn this event, the foundational documents were adopted, including the Declaration of Principles, The Thesis, Foundations for political action and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.\n\nIn December 1990, in Chile, Laura Rodríguez became the first elected representative of any Humanist Party in the world after winning a seat as part of the \"Concertación\" coalition, after Augusto Pinochet handed over power.\n\nIn October 1993, the second congress of the Humanist International was held in Moscow, Russia, whereupon the Document of the Humanist Movement was also incorporated as a foundational document. This document had previously been circulating as chapter six of the Book Letters to my friends.\n\nIn 1999, regional coordination bodies of Humanist Parties were formed in South America and Europe. The regional bodies of Africa and Asia are expected to be formed in 2006.\n\nIn addition to the Humanist Party, the Community for Human Development later recommended also the formation of a party based on a New Humanist approach to Ecology. The subsequent formation of a party called The Greens, caused much confusion in Europe where both The Greens and Green Party were sometimes fighting elections against one another. This led to a great deal of bad feeling from the Green Party (see the section below on conflict with other organisations). Eventually, the Environmental policies of the Greens were incorporated within the Humanist Party which resulted in their merger.\n\nThe official documents of the Humanist Party can be found in the Book of the Humanist International.\n\nIn 2009, the word \"International\" was appended to the beginning of the Party's name.\n\nThe Centre of Cultures was started in 1995 from Milan, Barcelona and Marseille as a response to the increasingly difficult situation faced by newly arrived immigrants to Europe.\n\nThe objectives of the Centre of Cultures are:\n\nBy the year 2000 this organisation was recognised as the third official organism of the Humanist Movement and had opened new centres in New York City, Madrid, Bombay, Zurich, Paris, Brussels, Berlin, São Paulo, Buenos Aires and Santiago de Chile.\n\nThe work of the Centre of Cultures brought the Humanist Movement into contact with people from countries in Africa and Asia where it had previously had little presence and this led to a massive explosion in its membership in those areas starting in the late 90s.\n\nIn 2009 the organisation underwent a rebranding exercise and changed its name to Convergence of Cultures.\n\nIndividual Humanist Movement groups carry out missionary work, as they call it, in various locations around the world.\n\nAction fronts of many themes are developed by humanists around the world. They do not necessarily fall under the umbrella of any of the specific organisms. For more information consult the list of websites referred to at the bottom of this page.\n\nA three-part work comprising The inner look, The internal landscape and The external landscape. Each part deals with a different aspect of human existence.\n\nThe first part details the authors search and subsequent discovery of meaning in life. It describes meditation exercises called the experience of peace and the experience of force and describes a strategy in life for avoiding pain and suffering called the Principles of Valid Action.\n\nThe second part deals more with psychological issues and the interpersonal issues that an individual faces during their life. Themes such as; faith, provisional meanings, giving and receiving, contradiction and unity are dealt with. In addition the theme of the Internal Guide, an inspirational image that an individual can configure and use, is introduced.\n\nThe final part deals more with the external conditions in society, covering such aspects as; law, the state, religion, education etc.\n\nSelf-liberation is a book that can best be categorised as \"Personal development\". It contains a number of different techniques that can be done in groups and in pairs. The different sections deal with; Relaxation and working with mental images, the scheme of the different centres of response (the intellectual, emotional, motor, vegetative and sexual centres) and exercises for the first three centres called \"psycho-physical gymnastics\" and two further sections called \"Catharsis\" and \"Transference\" which are together known as \"operative\".\n\nThe work of Catharsis and Transference takes the participants deep into an area of what can be referred to as Siloist Psychology and a concept known as the \"Space of Representation\", what has been referred to by others as the \"mind's eye\", or what one is able to intentionally imagine when one closes one's eyes, when one daydreams or when one dreams during sleep.\n\nThe exercises are designed to help the participants: reconcile with their past experiences, find strength in their current situation and develop a positive and joyful image of the future. According to the explanations one carries one's bad experiences around in the consciousness and from there they act in the present and affect the future. By seeking out the bad experiences and painful memories and working on them using the techniques of catharsis and transference, mental energy can be released and one can live one's life more intentionally and less restricted by one's past experiences. The whole body of the work is meant to be done in such a way that there are no roles of \"therapist\" or \"patient\", all parties take all the roles to establish an equitable relationship that can engender trust and a deep entering into the themes.\n\nLetters to my Friends: On Social and Personal Crisis in Today's World is a book that outlines the scope of the crisis in which societies and individuals are immersed according to the point of view of the author. It is put together as a series of ten letters that were written between 1990 and 1994. The sixth letter, which is better known as either the Statement or Document of the Humanist Movement and has been taken as one of the Foundational documents of the Humanist International, contains a general point of view about; Global Capital, real vs formal Democracy, the emergence of a Humanist sensibility in the world, anti-humanist characteristics and Humanist Action Fronts.\n\nSome of the other chapters deal with such themes as; personal coherence and solidarity; the nature of human beings; social revolution; the armed forces and Human Rights.\n\nSilo Speaks is an anthology of opinions, commentaries and speeches given by Silo between 1969 and 1995.\n\nThe book starts with the first public explanation of New Humanism in a speech called The Healing of Suffering. It continues with a section that contains many explanations about themes such as: meaning in life, perception, voluntarism, the nature of human existence and religiosity.\n\nThe second part is a series of book presentations given during the publication of some of his previous works.\n\nThe third part is a series of talks given on such themes as: Humanism and the New World, Humanism and the Crisis of Civilization, What do we understand by Universal Humanism and the Theme of God.\n\n\nMario Rodríguez Cobos, also known as Silo, was born in 1938 and lived in Mendoza, Argentina. As the author of many books, he received an honorary doctorate from the National Academy of Sciences of Russia in October 1993.\n\nIn 2001, in the Annual Ordinary Meeting of the Assembly of General Coordinators, the highest level of interchange for those involved in the organisational structure, in Madrid, Spain, Silo announced his retirement from the affairs of the Humanist Movement, leaving all further development in the hands of this collegiate body that he himself had created.\n\nSince that time, Silo has started a new project, known as Silo's Message. This project is a spiritual development based on some of the earliest forms of meditation exercises developed by Silo in the 1960s called the work with the force.\n\nThe history of the Humanist Movement has not been without its conflict with other organisations and individuals.\n\nDuring the 1960s in Argentina, as the initial groups were forming with the name \"Young Power\", there was conflict with the Catholic Church. Humanist organisations, clearly opposed to the military regime in Argentina, came under attack from the government. People were arrested and jailed, two were killed and an attempt was made to shoot Silo.\n\nA research by Professor Barr-Melej from Ohio University contains some information about the early conflicts.\n\nLater on, with the advent of the Humanist variant of the Green party, humanists were exposed to a lot of opposition in Italy, Spain, the USA, the UK and Germany. Some people in the Green movement interpreted the Humanist Movement as being opposed to environmentalism, considering that humanity, not nature, should be the focus of attention. The response from the Humanist Movement was that environmental exploitation happens because society is following values (such as money, economic growth, etc.) that are contrary to the human being. The argument continued by pointing out that if we were to truly act on human values, there would be no need for a conflict with any living things.\n\nThe Humanist Movement is totally distinct from the International Humanist and Ethical Union, the worldwide federation of organisations promoting secular humanism that is recognised at the United Nations and includes organisations such as Humanists UK and the American Humanist Association.\n\nSome disaffected former members have also complained that the Humanist Movement is a cult, though some ex-members object to this label, considering this merely an attempt to discredit the organization.\n\n\n"}

He is also known for leaving his library to his birthplace of Besançon and for his correspondence with Madeleine de Scudéry.\n\nJean-Baptiste Boisot is the third son of Claude Boisot, governor of the imperial city of Besançon from 1652 to 1658 and merchant-banker, father of twelve children. Very quickly, at the end of the century, the family was Boisot Anomie, then protected by the minister of Louis XIV of France, François-Michel le Tellier, Marquis de Louvois. The Boisot family became very present in the body of the senior church dignitaries.\n\nLittle is known about the youth of Jean-Baptiste Boisot, except that he was an excellent student, curious, interested, and that he got excellent results in his studies.\n\nVery early, Jean Baptiste Boisot was interested in philosophy, as well the Latin, which he completed with success in his hometown at the age of thirteen years. He continued his studies at the University of Dole in the civil law and the canon law and received his law degree at the age of sixteen. His father then decides to send him to University of Paris, where he spent two years at the university. This was an opportunity for him to improve his knowledge of the Latin and Greek languages, with the goal of reading to the Fathers of the Church. He also wanted to see the manuscripts translated directly from the original source and make available this work.\n\nIn his first years at the Sorbonne, Jean Baptiste Boisot binds a lasting friendship with many emblematic figures of the time. For example Paul Pellisson historiographer of Louis XIV and State counselor, as well as Madeleine de Scudery, who was part of a movement in the late Renaissance in England and France where women used classical rhetorical theory for their own.\n\nAmong other figures were Jacob Spon, founder of the archeology, Andre of Saint Nicolas, philosopher, and theologian and Claude Nicaise. It is also in Paris that he perfected his handling of the French language and developed qualities of which Madeleine de Scudery and Bosquillon will pay tribute. Some of these qualities include politeness, taste, and modesty.\n\nSome of these letters were recovered thanks to the Journal des Savants. Having completed his studies in 1660, Jean Baptiste came back in Besançon ready to spend the next ten years of his life traveling for pleasure as well as for business.\n\nBoisot begins his travels by staying three consecutive years in Italy, where he buys books, medals, and busts, which become part of his future library.\n\nWith this deputation of the Pope, he bought the library of Cardinal Nicolas Perrenot de Granvelle, who was in the hands of the Count of Saint-Amour. Throughout his life, he enriches the library, which was the foundation of the Public Library of Besançon. It is now known as the Bibliothèque municipale de Besançon.\n\nThroughout this journey, he learned Italian, he \"heard\" as Hebrew, knew Greek, Latin, Spanish. We know he went to Rome and visited the library Vaticaneet where he met various booksellers. He also obtained the protection of Italian Cardinal Decio Azzolino, which represented the Queen Christina of Sweden.\n\nBoisot was offered the post of Secretary, but refused, being an enemy of tumult and subjugation courses. Nevertheless, it is through these relationships that he obtained from the Pope several priories located in Franche-Comté.\n\nBoisot was then sent on a mission to Milan, to the Marquis of Mortar, governor of Milan, to negotiate with him sending reinforcements. Meanwhile the peace of Aix-la-Chapelle is signed, and the king restores the Franche-Comté hoping resume, what happens four years later. It is for this reason that Boisot decided to exile himself and leave Savoy in 1673 and Italy in 1674. Until 1678, he remains in Spain, a country he does not crosses much, preferring to stay in Madrid.\n\nThis was opportunity for Boisot to improve his knowledge of the Spanish language, which will be useful in the classification and decryption papers Granvelle. This is also an opportunity for him to visit the library of the Escurial, where he stayed two months and meets Hernan Nunez, Ambassador of the King of Spain, seeking his presence at the Embassy. However, Jean Baptiste Boisot, having already refused such favors according to his principles, was obliged to refuse.\n\nPeace of Nijmegen being established in 1678, Jean Baptiste Boisot is finally released from its obligations to Spain and can return to his home province. The results of ten years of travel is positive by learning two new languages, the acquisition of books and works of art that will be linked to its library and living in the capitals of Rome and Madrid.\n\nLouis XIV entrusted him on his return the Benedictine Abbey of Saint-Vincent Besançon. which is the time the third benefit of the province. However, he meets some difficulties because the pope agrees after many negotiations as Jean-Baptiste Boisot does not belong to the order of St. Benedict, which put the abbey in order. During his appointment as abbot of Saint-Vincent, it's not a trip to Paris to meet with the king presented to him by Pellisson.\n\nThe life of Father Boisot is exemplary as it is linked to the piety and generosity. In times of plague, he will give up all his property and rescues the poor. Boisot filled his letters epistles, of odes, compliments and translations he sends his friend Pellisson example for his Treatise on the Eucharist, among other passages containing books Saint Jerome, of Lactantius and of Tertullian Corona. Sometimes he joined the Spanish and Italian letters are in the collection of Granvelle.\n\nThroughout his life, Jean-Baptiste Boisot has applied to put his knowledge to help others, his many notes and papers rank of Cardinal Granvelle make him a historian applied. The work on the papers of Cardinal Granvelle represents nearly 80 folio volumes that can currently still find library Besançon. He even had the idea of writing the life of Cardinal, as reported in a letter to his friend Pellisson:\n\nJean Mabillon admired in addition to the library, antique cabinet and tables of Boisot. All these elements can be concluded that Jean-Baptiste Boisot was an important figure in the community Bisontine, figure sponsorship and provincial scholarship of the seventeenth century, his name is known beyond the French borders.\n\nHe died 4 December 1694, at the age of fifty-six, in his abbey and bequeath to his hometown of Besançon its most valuable asset: its library. The magistrates of Besançon made him magnificent funeral orations, which they attended en masse. On 9 December, the city of Besançon decided to celebrate an office for the repose of his soul to the Cordeliers. Several exchanges are then carried out between the mayor and the Benedictines to establish an inventory of his collection, he begins a few days after his death, 5 January 1695.\n\nExtract the solemn testament made by Reverend Lord Sir Jean-Baptiste Boisot, Kirton, Abbot of Saint-Vincent de Besançon, Prior of Grandecour and Loye, passed by notary Jean Colin, royal notary audit Besançon 27 November 1694, published in Parliament Ladit city and to Sir Charles Bouvot, advisor to Commissioner MP 7 December of that year, in which he will set for his heir, Sir Claude Boisot, his brother, said Parliament Speaker.\n\nSo after this act was born the municipal library of Besançon, under the control of the Benedictines of St. Vincent. The question of the influence that the Mazarine library had in the legacy of Jean Baptiste Boisot is legitimate, since it has visited.\n\nJean Baptiste Boisot is a passionate knowledge of the study, a bibliophile, as evidenced by his correspondence miss Scuderi and Paul Pellisson.Il would be possible to have more information about the legacy of Father Boisot, however the letters that could provide more information are those sent to the abbot of St. Vincent which remain lost.\n\nThree letters to Paul Pellison learn about his legacy, like that of 17 December 1690 where he states:\n\nLetter of 12 January Pellison shows the evolution of his thinking:\n\nThe turning point comes with the transfer of the University of Dole to Besançon, and in the opinion of the Abbe de Saint-Vincent, who suggested he leave his library. As a letter from Paul Pelisson which dated 16 June 1691 in response to a letter from the Abbe Boisot, now lost watch:\n\nThe first inventory of the library of the Abbot Boisot was established in 1607. It contains, in addition to books Granvelle, some of those who belonged to his father, the Chancellor of Nicolas Perrenot, and the Earl of Cantecroix. It consists of nearly 1,500 volumes in nearly 1500 volumes. This library is considered one of the largest library of the sixteenth century.\n\nMaurice Piquard wrote an article \"The library of a statesman in the sixteenth century\", which encountered some difficulty with the poverty of the inventory of 1607 contained no dates or place of printing or author's name. It is for these reasons that the uncertainty still hangs on certain subjects. Maurice Piquard has several Greek works including 9 works of Plutarch, 6 Aristotle, Homer 5, 4 Polybius, Herodotus, Dion Cassius, 3 Thucydides, Xenophon, one of Aeschylus, Aristophanes. Absent the works of Sophocles and Euripides.\n\nWith regard to Latin literature, the collection includes nine books Cicero, Virgil, Livy, Terence, 'of Ovid, and Lucretius, Plautus, Pliny the Elder, Caesar, Seneca, Horace, and Tacitus. Piquard also highlights the presence of many of the Italian renaissance writers such as Dante, Petrarch, Boccaccio in rare and copies of authors Vitruvius . Machiavelli and Baldassare Castiglione are widely represented, with 5 copies of the Prince and 5 of the Courtier. Educated man, he has sixty law books, 172 history, 70 of Medicine (Ambroise Pare, Vesalius ...) as well as works of astrology, astronomy and many aspects of science and issues of the time, such as \" De revolutionibus orbium Celestium \"of Nicolas Copernicus, however it also lacks the works of Ptolemy, reputedly at the time.\n\nThe absence of some authors of the church such as St. Augustine and St. Thomas Aquinas and some novels such as Romance of the Rose is not trivial so we will not pay attention, and lack certain works of piety of the time is strange for a clergyman. The assumption of theft or loss is however not excluded.\n\nIts library includes manuscripts and enriched quality as the Chronicles of Froissart, from the collection of Granvelle and many bindings from quality relationships that the cardinal had linked with printers from all over Europe.\n\nThe inventory that was used was that of 1607, a more comprehensive was made until 1695 under the auspices of witnesses advisors Tinseau, Monnier, Noironte Lord and Pierre-Ignace Gillebert to attend the notary Jean Colin; It lasted nearly ten months (5 January 1695 - October 1695). The inventory \"dénombrera\" 1847 numbers for books, equivalent to 2,247 volumes and 239 manuscripts. They will later be joined to form 80 large folio of State Cardinal Granvelle papers. It is then in 1732 the first catalog will be established by subject matter, so sometimes messy and imprecise.\n"}

Candy rose to fame as a member of the Toronto branch of the Second City and its related \"Second City Television\" series, and through his appearances in such comedy films as \"Stripes\", \"Splash\", \"Cool Runnings\", \"Summer Rental\", \"Home Alone\", \"The Great Outdoors\", \"Spaceballs\", and \"Uncle Buck\", as well as more dramatic roles in \"Only the Lonely\" and \"JFK\". One of his most renowned onscreen performances was as Del Griffith, the loquacious shower-curtain ring salesman in the John Hughes comedy \"Planes, Trains and Automobiles\".\n\nWhile filming the Western parody \"Wagons East!\", Candy died of a heart attack in Durango, Mexico, on March 4, 1994, aged 43. His final two films, \"Wagons East!\" and \"Canadian Bacon\", are dedicated to his memory.\n\nCandy was born in 1950 in Newmarket, Ontario. The son of Sidney James Candy and Evangeline (née Aker) Candy, he was brought up in a working-class Roman Catholic family. Candy's father was of English and Scottish descent, while his mother was of Polish and Ukrainian descent.\n\nCandy studied at Neil McNeil Catholic High School, later enrolled in the Centennial Community College to study journalism, and went to McMaster University for higher education. His first film role was a small, uncredited appearance in the 1973 film \"Class of '44\". He appeared in several other low-budget films during the 1970s, including the bank-robbery thriller \"The Silent Partner\" with Christopher Plummer and Elliott Gould. In 1975, he played Richie, an accused killer, in episode \"Web of Guilt\", on the Canadian TV show \"Police Surgeon\". In 1976, Candy played a supporting role (with Rick Moranis) on Peter Gzowski's short-lived, late-night television talk show, \"90 Minutes Live\". That same year, as a member of Toronto's branch of the Second City, he gained wide North American popularity, which grew when he became a cast member on the influential Toronto-based comedy-variety show \"Second City Television\" (\"SCTV\"). NBC picked the show up in 1981 and it quickly became a fan favourite. It had won Emmy Awards for the show's writing in 1981 and 1982.\n\nAmong Candy's \"SCTV\" characters were unscrupulous street-beat TV personality Johnny LaRue, 3-D horror auteur Doctor Tongue, sycophantic and easily amused talk-show sidekick William B. Williams, and Melonville's corrupt Mayor Tommy Shanks. Other characters included the cheerful Leutonian clarinetist Yosh Shmenge, who was half of the Happy Wanderers and the subject of the mockumentary \"The Last Polka\", folksy fishin' musician Gil Fisher, handsome if accent-challenged TV actor Steve Roman, Pippy Long Socks, hapless children's entertainer Mr. Messenger, corrupt soap-opera doctor William Wainwright, smut merchant Harry, \"the Guy With the Snake on His Face\", and Giorgy, \"everyone's favourite Cossack\".\n\nMimicry was one of Candy's talents, which he used often at \"SCTV\". Celebrities impersonated by Candy include Jerry Mathers, Divine, Orson Welles, Julia Child, Richard Burton, Silvio Gigante, Luciano Pavarotti, Jimmy the Greek, Andrew Sarris, Tip O'Neill, Don Rickles, Curly Howard, Merlin Olsen, Jackie Gleason, Tom Selleck, Gordon Pinsent, Darryl Sittler, Ed Asner, Gertrude Stein, Morgy Kneele, Doug McGrath, and Hervé Villechaize.\n\nIn 1979, Candy took a short hiatus from \"SCTV\" and began a more active film career, appearing in a minor role as a US Army soldier in Steven Spielberg's big-budget comedy \"1941\" and had a supporting role as parole officer Burton Mercer in \"The Blues Brothers\". A year later, Candy played the lovable, mild-mannered Army recruit Dewey Oxberger in 1981's \"Stripes\", one of the most successful films of the year. In 1983, Candy had a cameo appearance in Harold Ramis's \"National Lampoon's Vacation\" and appeared on \"Saturday Night Live\" twice (hosting in 1983) while still appearing on \"SCTV\". According to writer-comedian Bob Odenkirk, Candy was reputedly the \"most-burned potential host\" of \"SNL\", in that he was asked to host many times, only for plans to be changed by the \"SNL\" staff at the last minute.\n\nIn 1983, Candy headlined in the film \"Going Berserk\", and was also approached to play the character of accountant Louis Tully in \"Ghostbusters\" (completed and released in 1984), but ultimately did not get the role because of his conflicting ideas of how to play the character; the part went instead to Rick Moranis. Candy was one of the many celebrities who appeared chanting \"Ghostbusters\" in Ray Parker, Jr.'s hit \"single\" for the movie. In 1984, Candy played Tom Hanks's womanizing brother in the hit romantic comedy \" Splash\", generally considered his break-out role.\n\nThroughout the latter half of the 1980s, Candy often took roles in substandard films (performing the voice of a talking horse in the Bobcat Goldthwait comedy \"Hot to Trot\"). While continuing to play supporting roles in films such as \"Spaceballs\", Candy headlined or co-starred in such comedy movies as \"Volunteers\", \"Planes, Trains and Automobiles\", \"Brewster's Millions\", \"The Great Outdoors\", \"Armed and Dangerous\", \"Who's Harry Crumb?\", \"Summer Rental\", and \"Uncle Buck\".\nHe also continued to play bit parts, including a disc jockey in the comic musical film \"Little Shop of Horrors\" and a policeman in the \"Sesame Street\" film \"Follow That Bird\".\n\nCandy also produced and starred in a Saturday-morning animated series on NBC titled \"Camp Candy\" in 1989. The show was set in a fictional summer camp run by Candy, featured his two children in supporting roles, and also spawned a brief comic book series published by Marvel Comics' Star Comics imprint.\n\nIn the early 1990s, Candy's career went into a slight decline after he appeared in a string of critical and commercial failures, including \"Nothing but Trouble\" (for which he was nominated for a Razzie as \"worst supporting actress\", playing a woman), \"Delirious\", and \"Once Upon a Crime\", although he did appear in major successes such as \"Rookie of the Year\" (uncredited), \"The Rescuers Down Under\", \"Home Alone\", and \"Cool Runnings\". Candy attempted to reinvigorate his acting career by broadening his range and playing more dramatic roles. In 1991, Candy appeared in a light romantic drama, \"Only the Lonely\", which had him as a Chicago cop torn between his overbearing mother (Maureen O'Hara) and his new girlfriend (Ally Sheedy). The same year and in rare form, Candy played a dramatic role as Dean Andrews Jr., a shady Southern lawyer in Oliver Stone's \"JFK\". He made his directorial debut in the 1994 comedy \"Hostage for a Day\", in which he also made a cameo appearance.\n\nIn 1991, Bruce McNall, Wayne Gretzky, and Candy became owners of the Canadian Football League's Toronto Argonauts. The celebrity ownership group attracted attention in Canada and the team spent a significant amount of money, even signing some highly touted National Football League prospects such as wide receiver Raghib Ismail. The Argonauts took home the 1991 Grey Cup, beating Calgary, 36–21, in the final.\n\nIn 1994, while on vacation from film production (\"Wagons East!\") in Durango City, Mexico, Candy called his friends, including Canadian Football League commissioner Larry Smith, and told them that he had just let go of his team and was putting it up for sale. He then called his assistant, who invited Candy to play golf with him in the spring when he returned to Toronto. After cooking a late lasagna dinner for his assistants, Candy called his co-stars from his hotel, then went to sleep. Some time after midnight, on March 4, 1994, Candy was found dead from a presumed myocardial infarction even though this was unproven, as no autopsy was performed. He was 43 years old. The heavyset Candy had struggled for some years with weight-related health issues.\n\nCandy and his wife, Rosemary Hobor, had two children, Christopher Michael and Jennifer Anne.\n\nCandy was in talks to portray Ignatius J. Reilly in a now-shelved film adaptation of John Kennedy Toole's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel \"A Confederacy of Dunces\". He had also expressed interest in portraying Atuk in a film adaptation of Mordecai Richler's \"The Incomparable Atuk\" and Roscoe \"Fatty\" Arbuckle in a biopic based on the silent film comedian's life. These three shelved projects have been referred to as \"cursed\" because Candy, John Belushi, Sam Kinison and Chris Farley were each attached to all three roles, and they all died before they could make any of these films.\n\nCandy was originally considered to play Alec Guinness's role in the remake of the 1950 film, \"Last Holiday\", with Carl Reiner directing. Eventually the role was played by Queen Latifah in a loose remake released in 2006.\n\nCandy had the comic relief role of the turkey Red Feather in the animated Disney film \"Pocahontas\" written for him. The role was subsequently cut from the film after his death.\n\nCandy's funeral was held at St. Martin of Tours Catholic Church in Los Angeles. Candy was entombed in the mausoleum at Holy Cross Cemetery in Culver City, California. His crypt lies just above fellow actor Fred MacMurray. On March 18, 1994, a special memorial service for Candy, produced by his former improvization troupe, the Second City, was broadcast across Canada.\n\n\"Wagons East!\" was completed using a stunt double and special effects and released five months after Candy's death. His final completed film was \"Canadian Bacon\", a satirical comedy by Michael Moore that was released a year after Candy's death. Candy played American sheriff Bud Boomer, who led an \"invasion\" of Canada. Candy recorded a voice for the TV film \"The Magic 7\" in the early 1990s. The film remained in production for years due to animation difficulties and production delays, and it was shelved. Candy was inducted into Canada's Walk of Fame. In May 2006, Candy became one of the first four entertainers ever honoured by Canada Post by being featured on a postage stamp. \"Blues Brothers 2000\" is dedicated to three people, including Candy, who played a supporting role in the original \"Blues Brothers\". A tribute to Candy was hosted by Dan Aykroyd at the 2007 Grey Cup festivities in Toronto in November 2007.\n\nWeen's \"Chocolate and Cheese\" album, released in 1994, is \"dedicated in loving memory to John Candy (1950–1994)\". At the time Gene Ween remarked, \"there was so much going on about Kurt Cobain, and nobody mentioned John Candy at all. I have a special little spot in my heart for him.\"\n\nThe John Candy Visual Arts Studio at Neil McNeil Catholic High School, in Toronto, was dedicated in his honour after his death. Candy, one of the school's most famous alumni, said during one of his annual visits to the school, \"My success is simply rooted in the values and discipline and respect for others that I was taught at Neil McNeil.\" Candy's daughter, Jennifer Candy, is an actress and television producer, having production credits for the television series \"Prom Queen\" and \"Sam Has 7 Friends\".\n\nSupport has been growing for giving the Canadian Screen Awards the official nickname \"The Candys,\" both in honour of the actor and because the name suggests Canada.\n\n"}

{"id": "27619960", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27619960", "title": "Lapot", "text": "Lapot\n\nLapot is the mythical practice of senicide in Serbia: killing one's parents, or other elderly family members, once they become a financial burden on the family. According to T. R. Georgevitch (Đorđević), writing in 1918 about the eastern highlands of Serbia, in the region of Zaječar, the killing was carried out with an axe or stick, and the entire village was invited to attend. In some places corn mush was put on the head of the victim to make it seem as if the corn, not the family, was the killer.\n\nGeorgevitch suggests that this legend may have originated in tales surrounding the Roman occupation of local forts.\nThe Romans ... were very bellicose people. Their leader ordered all the holders of the fort up to forty years of age to be active fighters, from forty to fifty to be guards of the fort, and after fifty to be killed, because they have no military value. Since that period the old men were killed.\nAnthropologist Senka Kovač, in a study on aging, mentions that the name \"lapot\" is given to this custom of killing the elderly in eastern Serbia.\n\nIn a study published in 1999, Bojan Jovanović argues that earlier anthropologists such as Trojanović, Georgevitch, and Čajkanović had confused myth with reality and that the well-known story of a grandson who had hidden his grandfather to protect him from lapot after a bad harvest, bringing him back to the village when the old man's wisdom had shown a way to survive, was the basis for establishing that the old should be respected for their knowledge and wise counsel.\n\nThe tradition was the topic of the 1972 TV docudrama \"Legenda o Lapotu\" (\"The Legend of Lapot\") by Goran Paskaljevic, in which after a bad harvest, an elderly man who can no longer work is ritually slain. The 1992 novel \"Lapot\" by Živojin Pavlović received the NIN Prize. In 2004, Italian news agency ANSA reported from Belgrade that an attempt by the Serbian government to introduce a law restricting free dispensing of life saving medicines to the over 60s had been described by the Serb media as a case of \"lapot\".\n\n\n"}
{"id": "18669", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18669", "title": "Life expectancy", "text": "Life expectancy\n\nLife expectancy is a statistical measure of the average time an organism is expected to live, based on the year of its birth, its current age and other demographic factors including gender. The most commonly used measure of life expectancy is at birth (LEB), which can be defined in two ways. \"Cohort\" LEB is the mean length of life of an actual birth cohort (all individuals born a given year) and can be computed only for cohorts born many decades ago, so that all their members have died. \"Period\" LEB is the mean length of life of a hypothetical cohort assumed to be exposed, from birth through death, to the mortality rates observed at a given year.\n\nNational LEB figures reported by statistical national agencies and international organizations are indeed estimates of \"period\" LEB. In the Bronze Age and the Iron Age, LEB was 26 years; the 2010 world LEB was 67.2 years. For recent years, in Swaziland LEB is about 49, and in Japan, it is about 83. The combination of high infant mortality and deaths in young adulthood from accidents, epidemics, plagues, wars, and childbirth, particularly before modern medicine was widely available, significantly lowers LEB. But for those who survive early hazards, a life expectancy of 70 would not be uncommon. For example, a society with a LEB of 40 may have few people dying at precisely 40: most will die before 30 or after 55. In populations with high infant mortality rates, LEB is highly sensitive to the rate of death in the first few years of life. Because of this sensitivity to infant mortality, LEB can be subjected to gross misinterpretation, leading one to believe that a population with a low LEB will necessarily have a small proportion of older people. For example, in a hypothetical stationary population in which half the population dies before the age of five but everybody else dies at exactly 70 years old, LEB will be about 36, but about 25% of the population will be between the ages of 50 and 70. Another measure, such as life expectancy at age 5 (e), can be used to exclude the effect of infant mortality to provide a simple measure of overall mortality rates other than in early childhood; in the hypothetical population above, life expectancy at 5 would be another 65. Aggregate population measures, such as the proportion of the population in various age groups, should also be used along individual-based measures like formal life expectancy when analyzing population structure and dynamics.\n\nMathematically, life expectancy is the mean number of years of life remaining at a given age, assuming age-specific mortality rates remain at their most recently measured levels. It is denoted by formula_1, which means the mean number of subsequent years of life for someone now aged formula_2, according to a particular mortality experience. Longevity, maximum lifespan, and life expectancy are not synonyms. Life expectancy is defined statistically as the mean number of years remaining for an individual or a group of people at a given age. Longevity refers to the characteristics of the relatively long life span of some members of a population. Maximum lifespan is the age at death for the longest-lived individual of a species. Moreover, because life expectancy is an average, a particular person may die many years before or many years after the \"expected\" survival. The term \"maximum life span\" has a quite different meaning and is more related to longevity.\n\nLife expectancy is also used in plant or animal ecology; life tables (also known as actuarial tables). The term life expectancy may also be used in the context of manufactured objects, but the related term shelf life is used for consumer products, and the terms \"mean time to breakdown\" (MTTB) and \"mean time between failures\" (MTBF) are used in engineering.\n\nHuman beings are expected to live on average 30–40 years in Swaziland and 82.6 years in Japan, but the latter's recorded life expectancy may have been very slightly increased by counting many infant deaths as stillborn. An analysis published in 2011 in \"The Lancet\" attributes Japanese life expectancy to equal opportunities and public health as well as diet.\n\nThe oldest confirmed recorded age for any human is 122 years, reached by Jeanne Calment who lived between 1875–1997. This is referred to as the \"maximum life span\", which is the upper boundary of life, the maximum number of years any human is known to have lived. Theoretical study shows that the maximum life expectancy at birth is limited by the human life characteristic value δ, which is around 104 years. According to a study by biologists Bryan G. Hughes and Siegfried Hekimi, there is no evidence for limit on human lifespan.\n\nThe following information is derived from the 1961 \"Encyclopædia Britannica\" and other sources, some with questionable accuracy. Unless otherwise stated, it represents estimates of the life expectancies of the world population as a whole. In many instances, life expectancy varied considerably according to class and gender.\n\nLife expectancy at birth takes account of infant mortality but not prenatal mortality.\n\nLife expectancy increases with age as the individual survives the higher mortality rates associated with childhood. For instance, the table above listed the life expectancy at birth among 13th-century English nobles at 30. Having survived until the age of 21, a male member of the English aristocracy in this period could expect to live:\n\nIn a similar way, the life expectancy of scholars in the Medieval Islamic world was 59–84.3 years.\n\n17th-century English life expectancy was only about 35 years, largely because infant and child mortality remained high. Life expectancy was under 25 years in the early Colony of Virginia, and in seventeenth-century New England, about 40 per cent died before reaching adulthood. During the Industrial Revolution, the life expectancy of children increased dramatically. The under-5 mortality rate in London decreased from 745 in 1730–1749 to 318 in 1810–1829.\n\nPublic health measures are credited with much of the recent increase in life expectancy. During the 20th century, despite a brief drop due to the 1918 flu pandemic starting around that time the average lifespan in the United States increased by more than 30 years, of which 25 years can be attributed to advances in public health.\n\nThere are great variations in life expectancy between different parts of the world, mostly caused by differences in public health, medical care, and diet. The impact of AIDS on life expectancy is particularly notable in many African countries. According to projections made by the United Nations (UN) in 2002, the life expectancy at birth for 2010–2015 (if HIV/AIDS did not exist) would have been:\n\nActual life expectancy in Botswana declined from 65 in 1990 to 49 in 2000 before increasing to 66 in 2011. In South Africa, life expectancy was 63 in 1990, 57 in 2000, and 58 in 2011. And in Zimbabwe, life expectancy was 60 in 1990, 43 in 2000, and 54 in 2011.\n\nDuring the last 200 years, African countries have generally not had the same improvements in mortality rates that have been enjoyed by countries in Asia, Latin America, and Europe.\n\nIn the United States, African-American people have shorter life expectancies than their European-American counterparts. For example, white Americans born in 2010 are expected to live until age 78.9, but black Americans only until age 75.1. This 3.8-year gap, however, is the lowest it has been since 1975 at the latest. The greatest difference was 7.1 years in 1993. In contrast, Asian-American women live the longest of all ethnic groups in the United States, with a life expectancy of 85.8 years. The life expectancy of Hispanic Americans is 81.2 years. According to the new government reports in the USA, life expectancy in the country dropped again because of the rise in suicide and drug overdose rates. The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) found nearly 70,000 more Americans died in 2017 than 2016, with rising rates of death among 25- to 44-year-olds.\n\nCities also experience a wide range of life expectancy based on neighborhood breakdowns. This is largely due to economic clustering and poverty conditions that tend to associate based on geographic location. Multi-generational poverty found in struggling neighborhoods also contributes. In United States cities such as Cincinnati, the life expectancy gap between low income and high income neighborhoods touches 20 years.\n\nEconomic circumstances also affect life expectancy. For example, in the United Kingdom, life expectancy in the wealthiest and richest areas is several years higher than in the poorest areas. This may reflect factors such as diet and lifestyle, as well as access to medical care. It may also reflect a selective effect: people with chronic life-threatening illnesses are less likely to become wealthy or to reside in affluent areas. In Glasgow, the disparity is amongst the highest in the world: life expectancy for males in the heavily deprived Calton area stands at 54, which is 28 years less than in the affluent area of Lenzie, which is only 8 km away.\n\nA 2013 study found a pronounced relationship between economic inequality and life expectancy. However, a study by José A. Tapia Granados and Ana Diez Roux at the University of Michigan found that life expectancy actually increased during the Great Depression, and during recessions and depressions in general. The authors suggest that when people are working extra hard during good economic times, they undergo more stress, exposure to pollution, and likelihood of injury among other longevity-limiting factors.\n\nLife expectancy is also likely to be affected by exposure to high levels of highway air pollution or industrial air pollution. This is one way that occupation can have a major effect on life expectancy. Coal miners (and in prior generations, asbestos cutters) often have lower life expediencies than average life expediencies. Other factors affecting an individual's life expectancy are genetic disorders, drug use, tobacco smoking, excessive alcohol consumption, obesity, access to health care, diet and exercise.\n\nIn the uterus, male fetuses have a higher mortality rate (babies are conceived in a ratio estimated to be from 107 to 170 males to 100 females, but the ratio at birth in the United States is only 105 males to 100 females). Among the smallest premature babies (those under 2 pounds or 900 g), females again have a higher survival rate. At the other extreme, about 90% of individuals aged 110 are female. The difference in life expectancy between men and women in the United States dropped from 7.8 years in 1979 to 5.3 years in 2005, with women expected to live to age 80.1 in 2005. Also, data from the UK shows the gap in life expectancy between men and women decreasing in later life. This may be attributable to the effects of infant mortality and young adult death rates.\n\nIn the past, mortality rates for females in child-bearing age groups were higher than for males at the same age. This is no longer the case, and female human life expectancy is considerably higher than that of males. The reasons for this are not entirely certain. Traditional arguments tend to favor sociology-environmental factors: historically, men have generally consumed more tobacco, alcohol and drugs than women in most societies, and are more likely to die from many associated diseases such as lung cancer, tuberculosis and cirrhosis of the liver. Men are also more likely to die from injuries, whether unintentional (such as occupational, war or car accidents) or intentional (suicide). Men are also more likely to die from most of the leading causes of death (some already stated above) than women. Some of these in the United States include: cancer of the respiratory system, motor vehicle accidents, suicide, cirrhosis of the liver, emphysema, prostate cancer, and coronary heart disease. These far outweigh the female mortality rate from breast cancer and cervical cancer.\n\nSome argue that shorter male life expectancy is merely another manifestation of the general rule, seen in all mammal species, that larger (size) individuals (within a species) tend, on average, to have shorter lives. This biological difference occurs because women have more resistance to infections and degenerative diseases.\n\nIn her extensive review of the existing literature, Kalben concluded that the fact that women live longer than men was observed at least as far back as 1750 and that, with relatively equal treatment, today males in all parts of the world experience greater mortality than females. Kalben's study, however, was restricted to data in Western Europe alone, where demographic transition occurred relatively early. In countries such as Hungary, Bulgaria, India and China, males continued to outlive females into the twentieth century. Of 72 selected causes of death, only 6 yielded greater female than male age-adjusted death rates in 1998 in the United States. With the exception of birds, for almost all of the animal species studied, males have higher mortality than females. Evidence suggests that the sex mortality differential in people is due to both biological/genetic and environmental/behavioral risk and protective factors.\n\nThere is a recent suggestion that mitochondrial mutations that shorten lifespan continue to be expressed in males (but less so in females) because mitochondria are inherited only through the mother. By contrast, natural selection weeds out mitochondria that reduce female survival; therefore such mitochondria are less likely to be passed on to the next generation. This thus suggests that females tend to live longer than males. The authors claim that this is a partial explanation.\n\nIn developed countries, starting around 1880, death rates decreased faster among women, leading to differences in mortality rates between males and females. Before 1880 death rates were the same. In people born after 1900, the death rate of 50- to 70-year-old men was double that of women of the same age. Cardiovascular disease was the main cause of the higher death rates among men. Men may be more vulnerable to cardiovascular disease than women, but this susceptibility was evident only after deaths from other causes, such as infections, started to decline.\n\nIn developed countries, the number of centenarians is increasing at approximately 5.5% per year, which means doubling the centenarian population every 13 years, pushing it from some 455,000 in 2009 to 4.1 million in 2050. Japan is the country with the highest ratio of centenarians (347 for every 1 million inhabitants in September 2010). Shimane prefecture had an estimated 743 centenarians per million inhabitants.\n\nIn the United States, the number of centenarians grew from 32,194 in 1980 to 71,944 in November 2010 (232 centenarians per million inhabitants).\n\nMental illness is reported to occur in approximately 18% of the average American population.\n\nThe seriously mentally ill have a 10- to 25-year reduction in life expectancy.\nThe reduction of lifespan has been studied and documented.\n\nThe greater mortality of people with mental disorders may be due to death from injury, from co-morbid conditions, or from medication side effects.\nPsychiatric medicines can increase the chance of developing diabetes. Psychiatric medicine can also cause agranulocytosis. Psychiatric medicines also affect the stomach, where the mentally ill have a four times risk of gastrointestinal disease.\n\nThe life expectancy of people with diabetes, which is 9.3% of the U.S. population, is reduced by roughly ten to twenty years. Other demographics that tend to have a lower life expectancy than average include transplant recipients, and the obese.\n\nVarious species of plants and animals, including humans, have different lifespans. Evolutionary theory states that organisms that, by virtue of their defenses or lifestyle, live for long periods and avoid accidents, disease, predation, etc. are likely to have genes that code for slow aging, which often translates to good cellular repair. One theory is that if predation or accidental deaths prevent most individuals from living to an old age, there will be less natural selection to increase the intrinsic life span. That finding was supported in a classic study of opossums by Austad; however, the opposite relationship was found in an equally prominent study of guppies by Reznick.\n\nOne prominent and very popular theory states that lifespan can be lengthened by a tight budget for food energy called caloric restriction. Caloric restriction observed in many animals (most notably mice and rats) shows a near doubling of life span from a very limited calorific intake. Support for the theory has been bolstered by several new studies linking lower basal metabolic rate to increased life expectancy. That is the key to why animals like giant tortoises can live so long. Studies of humans with life spans of at least 100 have shown a link to decreased thyroid activity, resulting in their lowered metabolic rate.\n\nIn a broad survey of zoo animals, no relationship was found between the fertility of the animal and its life span.\n\nThe starting point for calculating life expectancy is the age-specific death rates of the population members. If a large number of data is available, a statistical population can be created that allow the age-specific death rates to be simply taken as the mortality rates actually experienced at each age (the number of deaths divided by the number of years \"exposed to risk\" in each data cell). However, it is customary to apply smoothing to iron out, as much as possible, the random statistical fluctuations from one year of age to the next. In the past, a very simple model used for this purpose was the Gompertz function, but more sophisticated methods are now used.\n\nThese are the most common methods now used for that purpose:\n\nWhile the data required are easily identified in the case of humans, the computation of life expectancy of industrial products and wild animals involves more indirect techniques. The life expectancy and demography of wild animals are often estimated by capturing, marking, and recapturing them. The life of a product, more often termed shelf life, is also computed using similar methods. In the case of long-lived components, such as those used in critical applications: in aircraft, methods like accelerated aging are used to model the life expectancy of a component.\n\nThe age-specific death rates are calculated separately for separate groups of data that are believed to have different mortality rates (such as males and females, and perhaps smokers and non-smokers if data are available separately for those groups) and are then used to calculate a life table from which one can calculate the probability of surviving to each age. In actuarial notation, the probability of surviving from age formula_2 to age formula_4 is denoted formula_5 and the probability of dying during age formula_2 (between ages formula_2 and formula_8) is denoted formula_9. For example, if 10% of a group of people alive at their 90th birthday die before their 91st birthday, the age-specific death probability at 90 would be 10%. That is a probability, not a mortality rate.\n\nThe expected future lifetime of a life age formula_2 in whole years (the \"curtate expected lifetime\" of \"(x)\") is denoted by the symbol formula_11. It is the conditional expected future lifetime (in whole years), assuming survival to age formula_2. If formula_13 denotes the curtate future lifetime at formula_2,\nSubstituting formula_16 in the sum and simplifying gives the equivalent formula:formula_17 If the assumption is made that on average, people live a half year in the year of death, the complete expectation of future lifetime at age formula_2 is formula_19.\n\nLife expectancy is by definition an arithmetic mean. It can also be calculated by integrating the survival curve from 0 to positive infinity (or equivalently to the maximum lifespan, sometimes called 'omega'). For an extinct or completed cohort (all people born in year 1850, for example), it can of course simply be calculated by averaging the ages at death. For cohorts with some survivors, it is estimated by using mortality experience in recent years. The estimates are called period cohort life expectancies.\n\nIt is important to note that the statistic is usually based on past mortality experience and assumes that the same age-specific mortality rates will continue into the future. Thus, such life expectancy figures need to be adjusted for temporal trends before calculating how long a currently living individual of a particular age is expected to live. Period life expectancy remains a commonly used statistic to summarize the current health status of a population.\n\nHowever, for some purposes, such as pensions calculations, it is usual to adjust the life table used by assuming that age-specific death rates will continue to decrease over the years, as they have usually done in the past. That is often done by simply extrapolating past trends; but some models exist to account for the evolution of mortality like the Lee–Carter model.\n\nAs discussed above, on an individual basis, a number of factors correlate with a longer life. Factors that are associated with variations in life expectancy include family history, marital status, economic status, physique, exercise, diet, drug use including smoking and alcohol consumption, disposition, education, environment, sleep, climate, and health care.\n\nIn order to assess the quality of these additional years of life, 'healthy life expectancy' has been calculated for the last 30 years. Since 2001, the World Health Organization has published statistics called Healthy life expectancy (HALE), defined as the average number of years that a person can expect to live in \"full health\" excluding the years lived in less than full health due to disease and/or injury. Since 2004, Eurostat publishes annual statistics called Healthy Life Years (HLY) based on reported activity limitations. The United States uses similar indicators in the framework of the national health promotion and disease prevention plan \"Healthy People 2010\". More and more countries are using health expectancy indicators to monitor the health of their population.\n\nForecasting life expectancy and mortality forms an important subdivision of demography. Future trends in life expectancy have huge implications for old-age support programs like U.S. Social Security and pension since the cash flow in these systems depends on the number of recipients who are still living (along with the rate of return on the investments or the tax rate in pay-as-you-go systems). With longer life expectancies, the systems see increased cash outflow; if the systems underestimate increases in life-expectancies, they will be unprepared for the large payments that will occur, as humans live longer and longer.\n\nLife expectancy forecasting is usually based on two different approaches:\n\nLife expectancy is one of the factors in measuring the Human Development Index (HDI) of each nation along with adult literacy, education, and standard of living.\n\nLife expectancy is also used in describing the physical quality of life of an area or, for an individual when the value of a life settlement is determined a life insurance policy sold for a cash asset.\n\nDisparities in life expectancy are often cited as demonstrating the need for better medical care or increased social support. A strongly associated indirect measure is income inequality. For the top 21 industrialized countries, if each person is counted equally, life expectancy is lower in more unequal countries (r = −0.907). There is a similar relationship among states in the US (r = −0.620).\n\nLife expectancy differs from maximum life span. Life expectancy is an average for all people in the population — including those who die shortly after birth, those who die in early adulthood (e.g. childbirth, war), and those who live unimpeded until old age. Lifespan is an individual-specific concept — maximum lifespan is therefore an upper bound rather than an average.\n\nHowever, these two terms are often confused with each other to the point that when people hear \"life expectancy was 35 years\" they often interpret this as meaning that people of that time or place had short maximum life spans. One such example can be seen in the \"In Search of...\" episode \"The Man Who Would Not Die\" (About Count of St. Germain) where it is stated \"Evidence recently discovered in the British Museum indicates that St. Germain may have well been the long lost third son of Rákóczi born in Transylvania in 1694. If he died in Germany in 1784, he lived 90 years. The average life expectancy in the 18th century was 35 years. Fifty was a ripe old age. \"Ninety\"... was forever.\"\n\nIn reality, there are other examples of people living significantly longer than the life expectancy of their time period, such as Socrates, Saint Anthony, Michelangelo, and Benjamin Franklin.\n\nIt can be argued that it is better to compare life expectancy of the period after childhood to get a better handle on life span. Life expectancy can change dramatically after childhood, even in preindustrial times as is demonstrated by the Roman Life Expectancy table, which estimates life expectancy to be 25 years \"at birth\", but 53 years upon reaching age 25. Studies like Plymouth Plantation; \"Dead at Forty\" and Life Expectancy by Age, 1850–2004 similarly show a dramatic increase in life expectancy once adulthood was reached.\n\na. In standard actuarial notation, \"e\" refers to the expected future lifetime of \"(x)\" in whole years, while \"e\" with a circle above the \"e\" denotes the complete expected future lifetime of \"(x)\", including the fraction.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "172211", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=172211", "title": "Magnetoencephalography", "text": "Magnetoencephalography\n\nMagnetoencephalography (MEG) is a functional neuroimaging technique for mapping brain activity by recording magnetic fields produced by electrical currents occurring naturally in the brain, using very sensitive magnetometers. Arrays of SQUIDs (superconducting quantum interference devices) are currently the most common magnetometer, while the SERF (spin exchange relaxation-free) magnetometer is being investigated for future machines. Applications of MEG include basic research into perceptual and cognitive brain processes, localizing regions affected by pathology before surgical removal, determining the function of various parts of the brain, and neurofeedback. This can be applied in a clinical setting to find locations of abnormalities as well as in an experimental setting to simply measure brain activity.\n\nMEG signals were first measured by University of Illinois physicist David Cohen in 1968, before the availability of the SQUID, using a copper induction coil as the detector. To reduce the magnetic background noise, the measurements were made in a magnetically shielded room. The coil detector was barely sensitive enough, resulting in poor, noisy MEG measurements that were difficult to use. Later, Cohen built a much better shielded room at MIT, and used one of the first SQUID detectors, just developed by James E. Zimmerman, a researcher at Ford Motor Company, to again measure MEG signals. This time the signals were almost as clear as those of EEG. This stimulated the interest of physicists who had been looking for uses of SQUIDs. Subsequent to this, various types of spontaneous and evoked MEGs began to be measured.\nAt first, a single SQUID detector was used to successively measure the magnetic field at a number of points around the subject's head. This was cumbersome, and, in the 1980s, MEG manufacturers began to arrange multiple sensors into arrays to cover a larger area of the head. Present-day MEG arrays are set in a helmet-shaped vacuum flask that typically contain 300 sensors, covering most of the head. In this way, MEGs of a subject or patient can now be accumulated rapidly and efficiently.\n\nRecent developments attempt to increase portability of MEG scanners by using spin exchange relaxation-free (SERF) magnetometers. SERF magnetometers are relatively small, as they do not require bulky cooling systems to operate. At the same time, they feature sensitivity equivalent to that of SQUIDs. In 2012, it was demonstrated that MEG could work with a chip-scale atomic magnetometer (CSAM, type of SERF). More recently, in 2017, researchers built a working prototype that uses SERF magnetometers installed into portable individually 3D-printed helmets .\n\nSynchronized neuronal currents induce weak magnetic fields. The brain's magnetic field, measuring at 10 femtotesla (fT) for cortical activity and 10 fT for the human alpha rhythm, is considerably smaller than the ambient magnetic noise in an urban environment, which is on the order of 10 fT or 0.1 µT. The essential problem of biomagnetism is, thus, the weakness of the signal relative to the sensitivity of the detectors, and to the competing environmental noise.\n\nThe MEG (and EEG) signals derive from the net effect of ionic currents flowing in the dendrites of neurons during synaptic transmission. In accordance with Maxwell's equations, any electrical current will produce a magnetic field, and it is this field that is measured. The net currents can be thought of as current dipoles, i.e. currents with a position, orientation, and magnitude, but no spatial extent. According to the right-hand rule, a current dipole gives rise to a magnetic field that points around the axis of its vector component.\n\nTo generate a signal that is detectable, approximately 50,000 active neurons are needed. Since current dipoles must have similar orientations to generate magnetic fields that reinforce each other, it is often the layer of pyramidal cells, which are situated perpendicular to the cortical surface, that gives rise to measurable magnetic fields. Bundles of these neurons that are orientated tangentially to the scalp surface project measurable portions of their magnetic fields outside of the head, and these bundles are typically located in the sulci. Researchers are experimenting with various signal processing methods in the search for methods that detect deep brain (i.e., non-cortical) signal, but no clinically useful method is currently available.\n\nIt is worth noting that action potentials do not usually produce an observable field, mainly because the currents associated with action potentials flow in opposite directions and the magnetic fields cancel out. However, action fields have been measured from peripheral nerves.\n\nSince the magnetic signals emitted by the brain are on the order of a few femtoteslas, shielding from external magnetic signals, including the Earth's magnetic field, is necessary. Appropriate magnetic shielding can be obtained by constructing rooms made of aluminium and mu-metal for reducing high-frequency and low-frequency noise, respectively.\nA magnetically shielded room (MSR) model consists of three nested main layers. Each of these layers is made of a pure aluminium layer plus a high-permeability ferromagnetic layer, similar in composition to molybdenum permalloy. The ferromagnetic layer is supplied as 1 mm sheets, while the innermost layer is composed of four sheets in close contact, and the outer two layers are composed of three sheets each. Magnetic continuity is maintained by overlay strips. Insulating washers are used in the screw assemblies to ensure that each main layer is electrically isolated. This helps eliminate radio frequency radiation, which would degrade SQUID performance. Electrical continuity of the aluminium is also maintained by aluminium overlay strips to ensure AC eddy current shielding, which is important at frequencies greater than 1 Hz. The junctions of the inner layer are often electroplated with silver or gold to improve conductivity of the aluminium layers.\n\nActive systems are designed for three-dimensional noise cancellation. To implement an active system, low-noise fluxgate magnetometers are mounted at the center of each surface and oriented orthogonally to it. This negatively feeds a DC amplifier through a low-pass network with a slow falloff to minimize positive feedback and oscillation. Built into the system are shaking and degaussing wires. Shaking wires increase the magnetic permeability, while the permanent degaussing wires are applied to all surfaces of the inner main layer to degauss the surfaces. Moreover, noise cancellation algorithms can reduce both low-frequency and high-frequency noise. Modern systems have a noise floor of around 2–3 fT/Hz above 1 Hz.\n\nThe challenge posed by MEG is to determine the location of electric activity within the brain from the induced magnetic fields outside the head. Problems such as this, where model parameters (the location of the activity) have to be estimated from measured data (the SQUID signals) are referred to as \"inverse problems\" (in contrast to \"forward problems\" where the model parameters (e.g. source location) are known and the data (e.g. the field at a given distance) is to be estimated.) The primary difficulty is that the inverse problem does not have a unique solution (i.e., there are infinite possible \"correct\" answers), and the problem of defining the \"best\" solution is itself the subject of intensive research. Possible solutions can be derived using models involving prior knowledge of brain activity.\n\nThe source models can be either over-determined or under-determined. An over-determined model may consist of a few point-like sources (\"equivalent dipoles\"), whose locations are then estimated from the data. Under-determined models may be used in cases where many different distributed areas are activated (\"distributed source solutions\"): there are infinitely many possible current distributions explaining the measurement results, but the most likely is selected. Localization algorithms make use of given source and head models to find a likely location for an underlying focal field generator.\n\nOne type of localization algorithm for overdetermined models operates by expectation-maximization: the system is initialized with a first guess. A loop is started, in which a forward model is used to simulate the magnetic field that would result from the current guess. The guess is adjusted to reduce the discrepancy between the simulated field and the measured field. This process is iterated until convergence.\n\nAnother common technique is beamforming, wherein a theoretical model of the magnetic field produced by a given current dipole is used as a prior, along with second-order statistics of the data in the form of a covariance matrix, to calculate a linear weighting of the sensor array (the beamformer) via the Backus-Gilbert inverse. This is also known as a linearly constrained minimum variance (LCMV) beamformer. When the beamformer is applied to the data, it produces an estimate of the power in a \"virtual channel\" at the source location.\n\nThe extent to which the constraint-free MEG inverse problem is ill-posed cannot be overemphasized. If one's goal is to estimate the current density within the human brain with say a 5mm resolution then it is well established that the vast majority of the information needed to perform a unique inversion must come not from the magnetic field measurement but rather from the constraints applied to the problem. Furthermore, even when a unique inversion is possible in the presence of such constraints said inversion can be unstable. These conclusions are easily deduced from published works.\n\nThe source locations can be combined with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) images to create magnetic source images (MSI). The two sets of data are combined by measuring the location of a common set of fiducial points marked during MRI with lipid markers and marked during MEG with electrified coils of wire that give off magnetic fields. The locations of the fiducial points in each data set are then used to define a common coordinate system so that superimposing the functional MEG data onto the structural MRI data (\"coregistration\") is possible.\n\nA criticism of the use of this technique in clinical practice is that it produces colored areas with definite boundaries superimposed upon an MRI scan: the untrained viewer may not realize that the colors do not represent a physiological certainty, because of the relatively low spatial resolution of MEG, but rather a probability cloud derived from statistical processes. However, when the magnetic source image corroborates other data, it can be of clinical utility.\n\nA widely accepted source-modeling technique for MEG involves calculating a set of equivalent current dipoles (ECDs), which assumes the underlying neuronal sources to be focal. This dipole fitting procedure is non-linear and over-determined, since the number of unknown dipole parameters is smaller than the number of MEG measurements. Automated multiple dipole model algorithms such as multiple signal classification (MUSIC) and MSST (MultiStart Spatial and Temporal) modeling are applied to the analysis of MEG responses. The limitations of dipole models for characterizing neuronal responses are (1) difficulties in localizing extended sources with ECDs, (2) problems with accurately estimating the total number of dipoles in advance, and (3) dependency on dipole location, especially depth in the brain.\n\nUnlike multiple-dipole modeling, distributed source models divide the source space into a grid containing a large number of dipoles. The inverse problem is to obtain the dipole moments for the grid nodes. As the number of unknown dipole moments is much greater than the number of MEG sensors, the inverse solution is highly underdetermined, so additional constraints are needed to reduce ambiguity of the solution. The primary advantage of this approach is that no prior specification of the source model is necessary. However, the resulting distributions may be difficult to interpret, because they only reflect a \"blurred\" (or even distorted) image of the true neuronal source distribution. The matter is complicated by the fact that spatial resolution depends strongly on several parameters such as brain area, depth, orientation, number of sensors etc.\n\nIndependent component analysis (ICA) is another signal processing solution that separates different signals that are statistically independent in time. It is primarily used to remove artifacts such as blinking, eye muscle movement, facial muscle artifacts, cardiac artifacts, etc. from MEG and EEG signals that may be contaminated with outside noise. However, ICA has poor resolution of highly correlated brain sources.\n\nIn research, MEG's primary use is the measurement of time courses of activity. MEG can resolve events with a precision of 10 milliseconds or faster, while functional MRI (fMRI), which depends on changes in blood flow, can at best resolve events with a precision of several hundred milliseconds. MEG also accurately pinpoints sources in primary auditory, somatosensory, and motor areas. For creating functional maps of human cortex during more complex cognitive tasks, MEG is most often combined with fMRI, as the methods complement each other. Neuronal (MEG) and hemodynamic (fMRI) data do not necessarily agree, in spite of the tight relationship between local field potentials (LFP) and blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signals. MEG and BOLD signals may originate from the same source (though the BOLD signals are filtered through the hemodynamic response).\n\nMEG is also being used to better localize responses in the brain. The openness of the MEG setup allows external auditory and visual stimuli to be easily introduced. Some movement by the subject is also possible as long as it does not jar the subject's head. The responses in the brain before, during, and after the introduction of such stimuli/movement can then be mapped with greater spatial resolution than was previously possible with EEG. Psychologists are also taking advantage of MEG neuroimaging to better understand relationships between brain function and behavior. For example, a number of studies have been done comparing the MEG responses of patients with psychological troubles to control patients. There has been great success isolating unique responses in patients with schizophrenia, such as auditory gating deficits to human voices. MEG is also being used to correlate standard psychological responses, such as the emotional dependence of language comprehension.\n\nRecent studies have reported successful classification of patients with multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia, Sjögren's syndrome, chronic alcoholism, and facial pain. MEG can be used to distinguish these patients from healthy control subjects, suggesting a future role of MEG in diagnostics.\n\nThe clinical uses of MEG are in detecting and localizing pathological activity in patients with epilepsy, and in localizing eloquent cortex for surgical planning in patients with brain tumors or intractable epilepsy. The goal of epilepsy surgery is to remove the epileptogenic tissue while sparing healthy brain areas. Knowing the exact position of essential brain regions (such as the primary motor cortex and primary sensory cortex, visual cortex, and areas involved in speech production and comprehension) helps to avoid surgically induced neurological deficits. Direct cortical stimulation and somatosensory evoked potentials recorded on ECoG are considered the gold standard for localizing essential brain regions. These procedures can be performed either intraoperatively or from chronically indwelling subdural grid electrodes. Both are invasive.\n\nNoninvasive MEG localizations of the central sulcus obtained from somatosensory evoked magnetic fields show strong agreement with these invasive recordings. MEG studies assist in clarification of the functional organization of primary somatosensory cortex and to delineate the spatial extent of hand somatosensory cortex by stimulation of the individual digits. This agreement between invasive localization of cortical tissue and MEG recordings shows the effectiveness of MEG analysis and indicates that MEG may substitute invasive procedures in the future.\n\nMEG has been used to study cognitive processes such as vision, audition, and language processing in fetuses and newborns.\n\nMEG has been in development since the 1960s but has been greatly aided by recent advances in computing algorithms and hardware, and promises improved spatial resolution coupled with extremely high temporal resolution (better than 1 ms). Since the MEG signal is a direct measure of neuronal activity, its temporal resolution is comparable with that of intracranial electrodes.\n\nMEG complements other brain activity measurement techniques such as electroencephalography (EEG), positron emission tomography (PET), and fMRI. Its strengths consist in independence of head geometry compared to EEG (unless ferromagnetic implants are present), non-invasiveness, use of no ionizing radiation, as opposed to PET and high temporal resolution as opposed to fMRI.\n\nAlthough EEG and MEG signals originate from the same neurophysiological processes, there are important differences. Magnetic fields are less distorted than electric fields by the skull and scalp, which results in a better spatial resolution of the MEG. Whereas scalp EEG is sensitive to both tangential and radial components of a current source in a spherical volume conductor, MEG detects only its tangential components. Scalp EEG can, therefore, detect activity both in the sulci and at the top of the cortical gyri, whereas MEG is most sensitive to activity originating in sulci. EEG is, therefore, sensitive to activity in more brain areas, but activity that is visible in MEG can also be localized with more accuracy.\n\nScalp EEG is sensitive to extracellular volume currents produced by postsynaptic potentials. MEG detects intracellular currents associated primarily with these synaptic potentials because the field components generated by volume currents tend to cancel out in a spherical volume conductor The decay of magnetic fields as a function of distance is more pronounced than for electric fields. Therefore, MEG is more sensitive to superficial cortical activity, which makes it useful for the study of neocortical epilepsy. Finally, MEG is reference-free, while scalp EEG relies on a reference that, when active, makes interpretation of the data difficult.\n\n"}

She lived in New France, and was sentenced to death by a British court martial for the murder of her second husband, was hanged for it and her body hanged in chains. Her story has become a legend in Quebec, and she is the subject of many books and plays.\n\nLa Corriveau was born in 1733, most probably in January or February, and baptised on May 14, 1733, in the rural parish of Saint-Vallier in New France as \"Marie-Josephte Corriveau\". She was the only surviving offspring of Joseph Corriveau, a farmer, and Françoise Bolduc. Her ten brothers and sisters all died in childhood.\n\nCorriveau married at the age of 16, on November 17, 1749, to Charles Bouchard, aged 23, also a farmer. Three children were born in this marriage: two daughters, Marie-Françoise (1752) and Marie-Angélique (1754), followed by a son, Charles (1757). Rumors (that only started after the death of her second husband) say that she murdered him, as there is no concrete record of his death. Charles Bouchard was buried on April 27, 1760, and she remarried fifteen months later, on July 20, 1761, to another farmer from Saint-Vallier, Louis Étienne Dodier. On the morning of January 27, 1763, he was found dead in his barn, with multiple head wounds. Despite an official recording of the cause of death being from kicks of horses' hooves, and a speedy burial, rumours and gossip of murder spread rapidly through the neighbourhood. Dodier was on bad terms with his father-in-law and with his wife.\n\nAt the time, New France had been conquered by the British in 1760 as part of the Seven Years' War and was under the administration of the British Army. On hearing the rumours, the local British military authorities (charged with keeping order) set up an inquiry into Dodier's death. The inquiry opened in Quebec City on March 29, 1763, at the Ursulines of Quebec, charging Joseph Corriveau and his daughter Marie-Josephte, before a military tribunal made up of 12 English officers and presided over by Lieutenant Colonel Roger Morris. The case ended, on 9 April, with Joseph Corriveau being sentenced to death, for culpable homicide of his son-in-law. Marie-Josephte was found to be an accomplice to murder, and sentenced to sixty lashes and branded with the letter M on her hand. One of Joseph Corriveau's nieces, Isabelle Sylvain (who he employed as a servant), had testified but changed her story several times during the hearing; she was found guilty of perjury and given thirty lashes and branded with the letter P.\n\nCondemned to hang, Joseph Corriveau then told his confessor, that he was no more than an accomplice to his daughter, after she had killed Dodier. At a second trial, on 15 April, Marie-Josephte testified to having killed her husband with two blows of a hatchet during his sleep, because of his ill-treatment of her. The tribunal found her guilty and sentenced her to hang, her body after to be \"hanged in chains\" (that is, put up for public display on a gibbet).\n\nThe place of execution was Quebec, on the Buttes-à-Nepveu, near the Plains of Abraham, probably on 18 April. Her body was then taken, as directed by the sentence, to be put in chains at Pointe-Lévy, at the crossroads of Lauzon and Bienville (today the Rue St-Joseph and the Boulevard de l'Entente). The body, in its iron gibbet, was exposed to the public view until May 25 at the earliest. Following the requests of those living nearby, an order from the military commander of the district of Quebec, James Murray, addressed to the captain of the militia of Pointe-Lévy, permitted its being taken down and buried.\n\nIn 1849, the \"cage\" was dug up from the cemetery of the church of St-Joseph-de-la-Pointe-Lévy when a pit was dug. Soon after, the cage was stolen from the church cellar, and acquired by the American impresario P. T. Barnum and put on display as a \"macabre object\". After that, it was put on display at The Boston Museum. The museum slip indicated its provenance with two words: \"From Quebec\".\n\nThrough the efforts of the La Société d'histoire de Lévis, the cage was acquired from the Boston Museum and is now, part of a permanent display at Musée de la civilisation, 85 Dalhousie Street Québec, G1K 8R2.\n\nThe post-mortem exhibition of Corriveau's remains at a busy crossroads (a practice also in use under the French regime, and reserved in England for those found guilty of the most serious crimes); the repercussions in the trial; the rumour that her father would be convicted of murdering Dodier at his daughter's instigation; and the gossip which grew up around the circumstances of the death of her first husband all stirred up the popular imagination and became legends still told today in the oral tradition — increasing the number of murdered husbands to as many as seven and likening la Corriveau to a witch.\n\nThe 1849 discovery of the iron cage buried in the cemetery of St-Joseph parish (now the Lauzon district) served to reawaken the legends and the fantastic stories, which were amplified and used by 19th-century writers. The first, in 1863, Philippe Aubert de Gaspé in \"Les Anciens Canadiens\", has a supernatural Corriveau hanging in the Pointe-Levy cage, terrorising one night a passer-by conducting a witches' Sabbath and Will-o'-the-wisp at the Île d'Orléans. James MacPherson Le Moine (\"Maple Leaves\", 1863) and William Kirby, following in his footsteps (\"The Golden Dog\", 1877), made her a professional poisoner, a direct descendant of La Voisin, famous for her purported role in The Affair of the Poisons. Writers and historians such as Louis Fréchette and Pierre-Georges Roy have tried to give Corriveau's history, but without completely separating the facts from the anachronistic fantasies added in legend and novels.\n\nThe figure of Corriveau still inspires novels, songs and plays and is the subject of argument (was she guilty or not?). Oral tradition also perpetuated and has not stopped, and remains alive, as is evidenced by the numerous stories collected in the lands of many regions of Quebec.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "19378", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19378", "title": "Mind", "text": "Mind\n\nThe mind is a set of cognitive faculties including consciousness, perception, thinking, judgement, language and memory. It is usually defined as the faculty of an entity's thoughts and consciousness. It holds the power of imagination, recognition, and appreciation, and is responsible for processing feelings and emotions, resulting in attitudes and actions.\n\nThere is a lengthy tradition in philosophy, religion, psychology, and cognitive science about what constitutes a mind and what are its distinguishing properties.\n\nOne open question regarding the nature of the mind is the mind–body problem, which investigates the relation of the mind to the physical brain and nervous system. Older viewpoints included dualism and idealism, which considered the mind somehow non-physical. Modern views often center around physicalism and functionalism, which hold that the mind is roughly identical with the brain or reducible to physical phenomena such as neuronal activity, though dualism and idealism continue to have many supporters. Another question concerns which types of beings are capable of having minds (New Scientist 8 September 2018 p10). For example, whether mind is exclusive to humans, possessed also by some or all animals, by all living things, whether it is a strictly definable characteristic at all, or whether mind can also be a property of some types of human-made machines.\n\nWhatever its nature, it is generally agreed that mind is that which enables a being to have subjective awareness and intentionality towards their environment, to perceive and respond to stimuli with some kind of agency, and to have consciousness, including thinking and feeling.\n\nThe concept of mind is understood in many different ways by many different cultural and religious traditions. Some see mind as a property exclusive to humans whereas others ascribe properties of mind to non-living entities (e.g. panpsychism and animism), to animals and to deities. Some of the earliest recorded speculations linked mind (sometimes described as identical with soul or spirit) to theories concerning both life after death, and cosmological and natural order, for example in the doctrines of Zoroaster, the Buddha, Plato, Aristotle, and other ancient Greek, Indian and, later, Islamic and medieval European philosophers.\n\nImportant philosophers of mind include Plato, Patanjali, Descartes, Leibniz, Locke, Berkeley, Hume, Kant, Hegel, Schopenhauer, Searle, Dennett, Fodor, Nagel, and Chalmers. Psychologists such as Freud and James, and computer scientists such as Turing and Putnam developed influential theories about the nature of the mind. The possibility of nonbiological minds is explored in the field of artificial intelligence, which works closely in relation with cybernetics and information theory to understand the ways in which information processing by nonbiological machines is comparable or different to mental phenomena in the human mind.\n\nThe mind is also portrayed as the stream of consciousness where sense impressions and mental phenomena are constantly changing\n\nThe original meaning of Old English \"gemynd\" was the faculty of memory, not of thought in general. Hence \"call to mind\", \"come to mind\", \"keep in mind\", \"to have mind of\", etc. The word retains this sense in Scotland. Old English had other words to express \"mind\", such as \"hyge\" \"mind, spirit\".\n\nThe meaning of \"memory\" is shared with Old Norse, which has \"munr\". The word is originally from a PIE verbal root \"\", meaning \"to think, remember\", whence also Latin\" mens\" \"mind\", Sanskrit \"\" \"mind\" and Greek μένος \"mind, courage, anger\".\n\nThe generalization of \"mind\" to include all mental faculties, thought, volition, feeling and memory, gradually develops over the 14th and 15th centuries.\n\nThe attributes that make up the mind are debated. Some psychologists argue that only the \"higher\" intellectual functions constitute mind, particularly reason and memory. In this view the emotions — love, hate, fear, and joy — are more \"primitive \"or subjective in nature and should be seen as different from the mind as such. Others argue that various rational and emotional states cannot be so separated, that they are of the same nature and origin, and should therefore be considered all part of it as mind.\n\nIn popular usage, \"mind \"is frequently synonymous with \"thought\": the private conversation with ourselves that we carry on \"inside our heads.\" Thus we \"make up our minds,\" \"change our minds\" or are \"of two minds\" about something. One of the key attributes of the mind in this sense is that it is a private sphere to which no one but the owner has access. No one else can \"know our mind.\" They can only interpret what we consciously or unconsciously communicate.\n\nBroadly speaking, mental faculties are the various functions of the mind, or things the mind can \"do\".\n\nThought is a mental act that allows humans to make sense of things in the world, and to represent and interpret them in ways that are significant, or which accord with their needs, attachments, goals, commitments, plans, ends, desires, etc. Thinking involves the symbolic or semiotic mediation of ideas or data, as when we form concepts, engage in problem solving, reasoning, and making decisions. Words that refer to similar concepts and processes include deliberation, cognition, ideation, discourse and imagination.\n\nThinking is sometimes described as a \"higher\" cognitive function and the analysis of thinking processes is a part of cognitive psychology. It is also deeply connected with our capacity to make and use tools; to understand cause and effect; to recognize patterns of significance; to comprehend and disclose unique contexts of experience or activity; and to respond to the world in a meaningful way.\n\nMemory is the ability to preserve, retain, and subsequently recall, knowledge, information or experience. Although memory has traditionally been a persistent theme in philosophy, the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries also saw the study of memory emerge as a subject of inquiry within the paradigms of cognitive psychology. In recent decades, it has become one of the pillars of a new branch of science called cognitive neuroscience, a marriage between cognitive psychology and neuroscience.\n\nImagination is the activity of generating or evoking novel situations, images, ideas or other qualia in the mind. It is a characteristically subjective \"activity\", rather than a direct or passive experience. The term is technically used in psychology for the process of reviving in the mind percepts of objects formerly given in sense perception. Since this use of the term conflicts with that of ordinary language, some psychologists have preferred to describe this process as \"imaging\" or \"imagery\" or to speak of it as \"reproductive\" as opposed to \"productive\" or \"constructive\" imagination. Things imagined are said to be seen in the \"mind's eye\". Among the many practical functions of imagination are the ability to project possible futures (or histories), to \"see\" things from another's perspective, and to change the way something is perceived, including to make decisions to respond to, or enact, what is imagined.\n\nConsciousness in mammals (this includes humans) is an aspect of the mind generally thought to comprise qualities such as subjectivity, sentience, and the ability to perceive the relationship between oneself and one's environment. It is a subject of much research in philosophy of mind, psychology, neuroscience, and cognitive science. Some philosophers divide consciousness into phenomenal consciousness, which is subjective experience itself, and access consciousness, which refers to the global availability of information to processing systems in the brain. Phenomenal consciousness has many different experienced qualities, often referred to as qualia. Phenomenal consciousness is usually consciousness \"of\" something or \"about\" something, a property known as intentionality in philosophy of mind.\n\nMental contents are those items that are thought of as being \"in\" the mind, and capable of being formed and manipulated by mental processes and faculties. Examples include thoughts, concepts, memories, emotions, percepts and intentions. Philosophical theories of mental content include internalism, externalism, representationalism and intentionality.\n\nMemetics is a theory of mental content based on an analogy with Darwinian evolution, which was originated by Richard Dawkins and Douglas Hofstadter in the 1980s. It is an evolutionary model of cultural information transfer. A meme, analogous to a gene, is an idea, belief, pattern of behaviour (etc.) \"hosted\" in one or more individual minds, and can reproduce itself from mind to mind. Thus what would otherwise be regarded as one individual influencing another to adopt a belief, is seen memetically as a meme reproducing itself.\n\nIn animals, the brain, or \"encephalon\" (Greek for \"in the head\"), is the control center of the central nervous system, responsible for thought. In most animals, the brain is located in the head, protected by the skull and close to the primary sensory apparatus of vision, hearing, equilibrioception, taste and olfaction. While all vertebrates have a brain, most invertebrates have either a centralized brain or collections of individual ganglia. Primitive animals such as sponges do not have a brain at all. Brains can be extremely complex. For example, the human brain contains around 86 billion neurons, each linked to as many as 10,000 others.\n\nUnderstanding the relationship between the brain and the mind – mind–body problem is one of the central issues in the history of philosophy – is a challenging problem both philosophically and scientifically. There are three major philosophical schools of thought concerning the answer: dualism, materialism, and idealism. Dualism holds that the mind exists independently of the brain; materialism holds that mental phenomena are identical to neuronal phenomena; and idealism holds that only mental phenomena exist.\n\nThrough most of history many philosophers found it inconceivable that cognition could be implemented by a physical substance such as brain tissue (that is neurons and synapses). Descartes, who thought extensively about mind-brain relationships, found it possible to explain reflexes and other simple behaviors in mechanistic terms, although he did not believe that complex thought, and language in particular, could be explained by reference to the physical brain alone.\n\nThe most straightforward scientific evidence of a strong relationship between the physical brain matter and the mind is the impact physical alterations to the brain have on the mind, such as with traumatic brain injury and psychoactive drug use. Philosopher Patricia Churchland notes that this drug-mind interaction indicates an intimate connection between the brain and the mind.\n\nIn addition to the philosophical questions, the relationship between mind and brain involves a number of scientific questions, including understanding the relationship between mental activity and brain activity, the exact mechanisms by which drugs influence cognition, and the neural correlates of consciousness.\n\nTheoretical approaches to explain how mind emerges from the brain include connectionism, computationalism and Bayesian brain.\n\nThe evolution of human intelligence refers to several theories that aim to describe how human intelligence has evolved in relation to the evolution of the human brain and the origin of language.\n\nThe timeline of human evolution spans some 7 million years, from the separation of the genus \"Pan\" until the emergence of behavioral modernity by 50,000 years ago. Of this timeline, the first 3 million years concern \"Sahelanthropus\", the following 2 million concern \"Australopithecus\", while the final 2 million span the history of actual \"Homo\" species (the Paleolithic).\n\nMany traits of human intelligence, such as empathy, theory of mind, mourning, ritual, and the use of symbols and tools, are already apparent in great apes although in lesser sophistication than in humans.\n\nThere is a debate between supporters of the idea of a sudden emergence of intelligence, or \"Great leap forward\" and those of a gradual or continuum hypothesis.\n\nTheories of the evolution of intelligence include:\n\nPhilosophy of mind is the branch of philosophy that studies the nature of the mind, mental events, mental functions, mental properties, consciousness and their relationship to the physical body. The \"mind–body problem\", i.e. the relationship of the mind to the body, is commonly seen as the central issue in philosophy of mind, although there are other issues concerning the nature of the mind that do not involve its relation to the physical body. José Manuel Rodriguez Delgado writes, \"In present popular usage, soul and mind are not clearly differentiated and some people, more or less consciously, still feel that the soul, and perhaps the mind, may enter or leave the body as independent entities.\"\n\n\"Dualism\" and \"monism\" are the two major schools of thought that attempt to resolve the mind–body problem. Dualism is the position that mind and body are in some way separate from each other. It can be traced back to Plato, Aristotle and the Nyaya, Samkhya and Yoga schools of Hindu philosophy, but it was most precisely formulated by René Descartes in the 17th century. \"Substance dualists\" argue that the mind is an independently existing substance, whereas \"Property dualists\" maintain that the mind is a group of independent properties that emerge from and cannot be reduced to the brain, but that it is not a distinct substance.\n\nThe 20th century philosopher Martin Heidegger suggested that subjective experience and activity (i.e. the \"mind\") cannot be made sense of in terms of Cartesian \"substances\" that bear \"properties\" at all (whether the mind itself is thought of as a distinct, separate kind of substance or not). This is because the nature of subjective, \"qualitative\" experience is incoherent in terms of – or semantically incommensurable with the concept of – substances that bear properties. This is a fundamentally ontological argument.\n\nThe philosopher of cognitive science Daniel Dennett, for example, argues there is no such thing as a narrative center called the \"mind\", but that instead there is simply a collection of sensory inputs and outputs: different kinds of \"software\" running in parallel. Psychologist B.F. Skinner argued that the mind is an explanatory fiction that diverts attention from environmental causes of behavior; he considered the mind a \"black box\" and thought that mental processes may be better conceived of as forms of covert verbal behavior.\n\nPhilosopher David Chalmers has argued that the third person approach to uncovering mind and consciousness is not effective, such as looking into other's brains or observing human conduct, but that a first person approach is necessary. Such a first person perspective indicates that the mind must be conceptualized as something distinct from the brain.\n\nThe mind has also been described as manifesting from moment to moment, one thought moment at a time as a fast flowing stream, where sense impressions and mental phenomena are constantly changing.\n\n\"Monism\" is the position that mind and body are not physiologically and ontologically distinct kinds of entities. This view was first advocated in Western Philosophy by Parmenides in the 5th Century BC and was later espoused by the 17th Century rationalist Baruch Spinoza. According to Spinoza's dual-aspect theory, mind and body are two aspects of an underlying reality which he variously described as \"Nature\" or \"God\".\n\nThe most common monisms in the 20th and 21st centuries have all been variations of physicalism; these positions include behaviorism, the type identity theory, anomalous monism and functionalism.\n\nMany modern philosophers of mind adopt either a \"reductive\" or \"non-reductive physicalist\" position, maintaining in their different ways that the mind is not something separate from the body. These approaches have been particularly influential in the sciences, e.g. in the fields of sociobiology, computer science, evolutionary psychology and the various neurosciences. Other philosophers, however, adopt a non-physicalist position which challenges the notion that the mind is a purely physical construct.\n\nContinued progress in neuroscience has helped to clarify many of these issues, and its findings have been taken by many to support physicalists' assertions. Nevertheless, our knowledge is incomplete, and modern philosophers of mind continue to discuss how subjective qualia and the intentional mental states can be naturally explained. Then, of course, there is the problem of Quantum Mechanics, which is best understood as a form of perspectivism.\n\nNeuroscience studies the nervous system, the physical basis of the mind. At the systems level, neuroscientists investigate how biological neural networks form and physiologically interact to produce mental functions and content such as reflexes, multisensory integration, motor coordination, circadian rhythms, emotional responses, learning, and memory. At a larger scale, efforts in computational neuroscience have developed large-scale models that simulate simple, functioning brains. As of 2012, such models include the thalamus, basal ganglia, prefrontal cortex, motor cortex, and occipital cortex, and consequentially simulated brains can learn, respond to visual stimuli, coordinate motor responses, form short-term memories, and learn to respond to patterns. Currently, researchers aim to program the hippocampus and limbic system, hypothetically imbuing the simulated mind with long-term memory and crude emotions.\n\nBy contrast, affective neuroscience studies the neural mechanisms of personality, emotion, and mood primarily through experimental tasks.\n\nCognitive science examines the mental functions that give rise to information processing, termed cognition. These include perception, attention, working memory, long-term memory, producing and understanding language, learning, reasoning, problem solving, and decision making. Cognitive science seeks to understand thinking \"in terms of representational structures in the mind and computational procedures that operate on those structures\".\n\nPsychology is the scientific study of human behavior, mental functioning, and experience. As both an academic and applied discipline, Psychology involves the scientific study of mental processes such as perception, cognition, emotion, personality, as well as environmental influences, such as social and cultural influences, and interpersonal relationships, in order to devise theories of human behavior. Psychological patterns can be understood as low cost ways of information processing. Psychology also refers to the application of such knowledge to various spheres of human activity, including problems of individuals' daily lives and the treatment of mental health problems.\n\nPsychology differs from the other social sciences (e.g. anthropology, economics, political science, and sociology) due to its focus on experimentation at the scale of the individual, or individuals in small groups as opposed to large groups, institutions or societies. Historically, psychology differed from biology and neuroscience in that it was primarily concerned with mind rather than brain. Modern psychological science incorporates physiological and neurological processes into its conceptions of perception, cognition, behaviour, and mental disorders.\n\nBy analogy with the health of the body, one can speak metaphorically of a state of health of the mind, or mental health. Merriam-Webster defines mental health as \"A state of emotional and psychological well-being in which an individual is able to use his or her cognitive and emotional capabilities, function in society, and meet the ordinary demands of everyday life.\" According to the World Health Organization (WHO), there is no one \"official\" definition of mental health. Cultural differences, subjective assessments, and competing professional theories all affect how \"mental health\" is defined. In general, most experts agree that \"mental health\" and \"mental disorder\" are not opposites. In other words, the absence of a recognized mental disorder is not necessarily an indicator of mental health.\n\nOne way to think about mental health is by looking at how effectively and successfully a person functions. Feeling capable and competent; being able to handle normal levels of stress, maintaining satisfying relationships, and leading an independent life; and being able to \"bounce back,\" or recover from difficult situations, are all signs of mental health.\n\nPsychotherapy is an interpersonal, relational intervention used by trained psychotherapists to aid clients in problems of living. This usually includes increasing individual sense of well-being and reducing subjective discomforting experience. Psychotherapists employ a range of techniques based on experiential relationship building, dialogue, communication and behavior change and that are designed to improve the mental health of a client or patient, or to improve group relationships (such as in a family). Most forms of psychotherapy use only spoken conversation, though some also use various other forms of communication such as the written word, art, drama, narrative story, or therapeutic touch. Psychotherapy occurs within a structured encounter between a trained therapist and client(s). Purposeful, theoretically based psychotherapy began in the 19th century with psychoanalysis; since then, scores of other approaches have been developed and continue to be created.\n\nAnimal cognition, or cognitive ethology, is the title given to a modern approach to the mental capacities of animals. It has developed out of comparative psychology, but has also been strongly influenced by the approach of ethology, behavioral ecology, and evolutionary psychology. Much of what used to be considered under the title of \"animal intelligence\" is now thought of under this heading. Animal language acquisition, attempting to discern or understand the degree to which animal cognition can be revealed by linguistics-related study, has been controversial among cognitive linguists.\n\n In 1950 Alan M. Turing published \"Computing machinery and intelligence\" in \"Mind\", in which he proposed that machines could be tested for intelligence using questions and answers. This process is now named the Turing Test. The term Artificial Intelligence (AI) was first used by John McCarthy who considered it to mean \"the science and engineering of making intelligent machines\". It can also refer to intelligence as exhibited by an artificial (\"man-made\", \"non-natural\", \"manufactured\") entity. AI is studied in overlapping fields of computer science, psychology, neuroscience and engineering, dealing with intelligent behavior, learning and adaptation and usually developed using customized machines or computers.\n\nResearch in AI is concerned with producing machines to automate tasks requiring intelligent behavior. Examples include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to answer diagnostic and consumer questions, handwriting, natural language, speech and facial recognition. As such, the study of AI has also become an engineering discipline, focused on providing solutions to real life problems, knowledge mining, software applications, strategy games like computer chess and other video games. One of the biggest limitations of AI is in the domain of actual machine comprehension. Consequentially natural language understanding and connectionism (where behavior of neural networks is investigated) are areas of active research and development.\n\nThe debate about the nature of the mind is relevant to the development of artificial intelligence. If the mind is indeed a thing separate from or higher than the functioning of the brain, then hypothetically it would be much more difficult to recreate within a machine, if it were possible at all. If, on the other hand, the mind is no more than the aggregated functions of the brain, then it will be possible to create a machine with a recognisable mind (though possibly only with computers much different from today's), by simple virtue of the fact that such a machine already exists in the form of the human brain.\n\nMany religions associate spiritual qualities to the human mind. These are often tightly connected to their mythology and ideas of afterlife.\n\nThe Indian philosopher-sage Sri Aurobindo attempted to unite the Eastern and Western psychological traditions with his integral psychology, as have many philosophers and New religious movements. Judaism teaches that \"moach shalit al halev\", the mind rules the heart. Humans can approach the Divine intellectually, through learning and behaving according to the Divine Will as enclothed in the Torah, and use that deep logical understanding to elicit and guide emotional arousal during prayer. Christianity has tended to see the mind as distinct from the soul (Greek \"nous\") and sometimes further distinguished from the spirit. Western esoteric traditions sometimes refer to a mental body that exists on a plane other than the physical. Hinduism's various philosophical schools have debated whether the human soul (Sanskrit \"atman\") is distinct from, or identical to, \"Brahman\", the divine reality. Taoism sees the human being as contiguous with natural forces, and the mind as not separate from the body. Confucianism sees the mind, like the body, as inherently perfectible.\n\nBuddhist teachings explain the moment-to-moment manifestation of the mind-stream. The components that make up the mind are known as the five aggregates (i.e., material form, feelings, perception, volition, and sensory consciousness), which arise and pass away continuously. The arising and passing of these aggregates in the present moment is described as being influenced by five causal laws: biological laws, psychological laws, physical laws, volitional laws, and universal laws. The Buddhist practice of mindfulness involves attending to this constantly changing mind-stream.\n\nAccording to Buddhist philosopher Dharmakirti, the mind has two fundamental qualities: \"clarity and cognizes\". If something is not those two qualities, it cannot validly be called mind. \"Clarity\" refers to the fact that mind has no color, shape, size, location, weight, or any other physical characteristic, and \"cognizes\" that it functions to know or perceive objects. \"Knowing\" refers to the fact that mind is aware of the contents of experience, and that, in order to exist, mind must be cognizing an object. You cannot have a mind – whose function is to cognize an object – existing without cognizing an object.\n\nMind, in Buddhism, is also described as being \"space-like\" and \"illusion-like\". Mind is space-like in the sense that it is not physically obstructive. It has no qualities which would prevent it from existing. In Mahayana Buddhism, mind is illusion-like in the sense that it is empty of inherent existence. This does not mean it does not exist, it means that it exists in a manner that is counter to our ordinary way of misperceiving how phenomena exist, according to Buddhism. When the mind is itself cognized properly, without misperceiving its mode of existence, it appears to exist like an illusion. There is a big difference however between being \"space and illusion\" and being \"space-like\" and \"illusion-like\". Mind is not composed of space, it just shares some descriptive similarities to space. Mind is not an illusion, it just shares some descriptive qualities with illusions.\n\nBuddhism posits that there is no inherent, unchanging identity (Inherent I, Inherent Me) or phenomena (Ultimate self, inherent self, Atman, Soul, Self-essence, Jiva, Ishvara, humanness essence, etc.) which is the experiencer of our experiences and the agent of our actions. In other words, human beings consist of merely a body and a mind, and nothing extra. Within the body there is no part or set of parts which is – by itself or themselves – the person. Similarly, within the mind there is no part or set of parts which are themselves \"the person\". A human being merely consists of five aggregates, or \"skandhas\" and nothing else.\n\nIn the same way, \"mind\" is what can be validly conceptually labelled onto our mere experience of clarity and knowing. There is something separate and apart from clarity and knowing which is \"Awareness\", in Buddhism. \"Mind\" is that part of experience the sixth sense door, which can be validly referred to as mind by the concept-term \"mind\". There is also not \"objects out there, mind in here, and experience somewhere in-between\". There is a third thing called \"awareness\" which exists being aware of the contents of mind and what mind cognizes. There are five senses (arising of mere experience: shapes, colors, the components of smell, components of taste, components of sound, components of touch) and mind as the sixth institution; this means, expressly, that there can be a third thing called \"awareness\" and a third thing called \"experiencer who is aware of the experience\". This awareness is deeply related to \"no-self\" because it does not judge the experience with craving or aversion.\n\nClearly, the experience arises and is known by mind, but there is a third thing calls Sati what is the \"real experiencer of the experience\" that sits apart from the experience and which can be aware of the experience in 4 levels. (Maha Sathipatthana Sutta.)\n\nTo be aware of these four levels one needs to cultivate equanimity toward Craving and Aversion. This is Called Vipassana which is different from the way of reacting with Craving and Aversion. This is the state of being aware and equanimous to the complete experience of here and now. This is the way of Buddhism, with regards to mind and the ultimate nature of minds (and persons).\n\nDue to the mind–body problem, a lot of interest and debate surrounds the question of what happens to one's conscious mind as one's body dies. During brain death all brain function permanently ceases, according to the current neuroscientific view which sees these processes as the physical basis of mental phenomena, the mind fails to survive brain death and ceases to exist. This permanent loss of consciousness after death is often called \"eternal oblivion\". The belief that some spiritual or incorporeal component (soul) exists and that it is preserved after death is described by the term \"afterlife\".\n\nParapsychology is a study of certain types of paranormal phenomena, or of phenomena which appear to be paranormal but it does not have any scientific basis for instance precognition, telekinesis and telepathy.\n\nThe term is based on the Greek para (beside/beyond), psyche (soul/mind), and logos (account/explanation) and was coined by psychologist Max Dessoir in or before 1889. J.B. Rhine tried to popularize \"parapsychology\" using a fraudulent techniques as a replacement for the earlier term \"psychical research\", during a shift in methodologies which brought experimental methods to the study of psychic phenomena. Parapsychology is not accepted among the scientific community as science, as psychic abilities have not been demonstrated to exist. The status of parapsychology as a science has also been disputed, with many scientists regarding the discipline as pseudoscience.\n\n"}

On 10 November 2006, Tamayo Hernández was abducted and found dead inside a motel room in Guerrero, presumably killed by a lethal injection; the crime is yet to be solved, but there are signs that his death was work-related.\n\nTamayo Hernández was born in the Tierra Caliente region in Tlalchapa, Guerrero on 2 March 1952. Before going into journalism, he worked at a credit bank for the government at his locality and as a rancher. He had some experience in politics by joining the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), but he gave it up and followed his dream to pursue a career in journalism and create his own newspaper in 2001.\n\nTamayo Hernández was the editorial director and owner of \"El Despertar de la Costa\" (\"The Awakening of the Coast\"), a newspaper that circulates around the Costa Grande region in the state of Guerrero and is based in the city of Zihuatanejo, right on the coast of the Pacific Ocean. His newspaper was also run by his two sisters, Ruth and Rebecca Tamayo Hernández, who, along with Misael, took a critical stance of the local corruption and organized crime. He also wrote extensively on the drug cartel turf wars in Zihuatanejo and Acapulco, areas known for their lucrative smuggling routes for narcotics.\n\nAt around 9 a.m. on 9 November 2006, Tamayo Hernández left the offices of \"El Despertar de la Costa\" to have breakfast in Ixtapa with a bus company manager and former police commander of the state, Reynaldo Ríos de los Santos. About an hour and a half later, the journalist called his newspaper and told a reporter to carry out a report on the water administration of a nearby town. Tamayo Hernández had written on his newspaper column earlier that morning on the alleged corruption that besets the water system in Zihuatanejo city. After making this call, Tamayo Hernández never returned to work and stopped answering phone calls. By 3 a.m. the next day, his family contacted the police after not hearing from him. The man who accompanied him remains disappeared.\n\nTamayo Hernández (aged 53) was eventually found dead at 7:30 a.m. on 10 November 2006 by a security guard inside a motel room in the outskirts of Zihuatanejo, Guerrero. Both of his hands were tied behind his back with a belt, and three small perforations on both of his arms indicated that he was killed with a lethal injection. Post-mortem reports showed that he had died of a massive heart attack probably caused by the drugs injected into his body. He was completely naked; in the back pocket of his trousers, a small bag with white powder – possibly cocaine – was discovered at the crime scene. Later investigations showed that the credit and debit cards of Tamayo Hernández were used after he was killed, but no arrests have been made.\n\nHe reportedly received several death threats while being alive, but never took them seriously. The motives behind his death are still unknown, but there are signs that Tamayo Hernández's killing was work-related and due to his coverage on organized crime, drug trafficking, and corruption.\n\nIn Ciudad Altamirano and Tlalchapa, Tamayo Hernández's body was held in a wake and was buried in Arcelia, Guerrero on 13 November 2006.\n\nTamayo Hernández was the seventh journalist killed or disappeared in the country in 2006, placing Mexico at the top of the list for journalists assassinated in the Western Hemisphere. In the state of Guerrero, where Tamayo Hernández was killed, several other journalists received death threats that same year.\n\nBack in 1998, Pedro Valle Hernández and another journalist were assassinated in Guerrero, apparently as a reprisal for their journalistic coverage.\n\nThe most prominent journalists in the state of Guerrero are given an annual award called the \"State journalism award Misael Tamayo,\" in honor of him.\n\nTamayo Hernández had five children, one of them named Misael Tamayo Núñez, the current editorial director of \"El Despertar del Sur\" (\"The Awakening of the South\"), another family-owned newspaper in Arcelia, Guerrero, with Concepción Núñez, his wife.\n\nHe also had two sisters, Ruth and Rebeca Tamayo Hernández, who live in the city of Zihuatanejo.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2457021", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2457021", "title": "Neural gas", "text": "Neural gas\n\nNeural gas is an artificial neural network, inspired by the self-organizing map and introduced in 1991 by Thomas Martinetz and Klaus Schulten. The neural gas is a simple algorithm for finding optimal data representations based on feature vectors. The algorithm was coined \"neural gas\" because of the dynamics of the feature vectors during the adaptation process, which distribute themselves like a gas within the data space. It is applied where data compression or vector quantization is an issue, for example speech recognition, image processing or pattern recognition. As a robustly converging alternative to the k-means clustering it is also used for cluster analysis.\n\nGiven a probability distribution formula_1 of data vectors formula_2 and a finite number of feature vectors formula_3.\n\nWith each time step formula_4, a data vector formula_2 randomly chosen from formula_1 is presented. Subsequently, the distance order of the feature vectors to the given data vector formula_2 is determined. Let formula_8 denote the index of the closest feature vector, formula_9 the index of the second closest feature vector, and formula_10 the index of the feature vector most distant to formula_2. Then each feature vector is adapted according to\n\nformula_12\n\nwith formula_13 as the adaptation step size and formula_14 as the so-called neighborhood range. formula_13 and formula_14 are reduced with increasing formula_4. After sufficiently many adaptation steps the feature vectors cover the data space with minimum representation error.\n\nThe adaptation step of the neural gas can be interpreted as gradient descent on a cost function. By adapting not only the closest feature vector but all of them with a step size decreasing with increasing distance order, compared to (online) k-means clustering a much more robust convergence of the algorithm can be achieved. The neural gas model does not delete a node and also does not create new nodes.\n\nA number of variants of the neural gas algorithm exists in the literature so as to mitigate some of its shortcomings. More notable is perhaps Bernd Fritzke's growing neural gas, but also one should mention further elaborations such as the Growing When Required network and also the incremental growing neural gas.\n\nFritzke describes the growing neural gas (GNG) as an incremental network model that learns topological relations by using a \"Hebb-like learning rule\", only, unlike the neural gas, it has no parameters that change over time and it is capable of continuous learning.\n\nHaving a network with a growing set of nodes, like the one implemented by the GNG algorithm was seen as a great advantage, however some limitation on the learning was seen by the introduction of the parameter λ, in which the network would only be able to grow when iterations were a multiple of this parameter. The proposal to mitigate this problem was a new algorithm, the Growing When Required network (GWR), which would have the network grow more quickly, by adding nodes as quickly as possible whenever the network identified that the existing nodes would not describe the input well enough. \n\nAnother neural gas variant inspired in the GNG algorithm is the incremental growing neural gas (IGNG). The authors propose the main advantage of this algorithm to be \"learning new data (plasticity) without degrading the previously trained network and forgetting the old input data (stability).\" \n\n\n"}
{"id": "37830837", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37830837", "title": "Non Violent Resistance (psychological intervention)", "text": "Non Violent Resistance (psychological intervention)\n\nNon Violent Resistance (NVR) is a psychological approach for overcoming destructive, aggressive, controlling and risk-taking behaviour. It was originally developed to address serious behaviour problems in young people, although it is now also being utilised in many different areas, such as adult entitled dependence, anxiety-related problems, problems linked to paediatric illness, internet dependency and misuse, and domestic violence perpetrated by adults.\n\nEmpirical research is on-going and relatively new. However, the outcome studies carried out so far has shown it to be effective for reducing childhood violence and aggression, improved relationships within the family, as well as increasing parents’ confidence levels and improving parental mental health.\n\nNVR's principles are based on the socio-political practice of nonviolent resistance (or nonviolent action), which refers to achieving goals through nonviolent methods, such as symbolic protests, civil disobedience, and economic or political noncooperation. The modern leading father of nonviolent resistance as a form of political struggle is Mahatma Gandhi, the Indian leader who used peaceful protests to seek independence from the British. NVR draws upon the approaches used by Gandhi to develop interventions aimed at the violent or self-destructive behaviour of young people who act in controlling ways. More recently, the practice of NVR has spawned the concept of the “anchoring function of attachment”, a contribution to attachment theory which emphasises the child's need to become secure in the relationship with a ‘strong and wise adult’, as well as the conceptualisation of the “New Authority”, which is based on principles such as transparency, inter-personal closeness, accountability of the adult within the community, rather than the principles of positional power, hierarchy and distance which marked more traditional forms of authority.\n\nAs a therapeutic or coaching process, NVR involves the individual's family, and generally extends to include family friends, professionals, schools and members of the community in its network. The approach believes parents, carers or teachers overcome their isolation by adopting such a large support network, and drawing on interpersonal support. A course of NVR lasts for about 3 months, or longer in more serious cases. Parents or carers of the aggressive young person typically attend one session with an NVR practitioner weekly, and may receive additional support such as telephone calls 1-2 times a week initially, gradually reducing as the intervention progresses. The violent child does not have to participate; NVR has been designed specifically to help families in which a young person does not cooperate in the therapeutic process. It is thought that the parents’ perseverance in the face of the child's non-cooperation sends a message of resistance.\n\nThe purposes of NVR is to help adults develop a positive form of authority, develop effective, non-punitive strategies of addressing the young person's controlling behaviour without escalation, restore a sense of balance in the family, and improve family relationships. NVR is a stable alternative to violent conflict and unproductive attempts at verbal persuasion.\n\nThe intervention is used for a variety of aggressive people, including children, adolescents and adults. It is currently used with children in care, children with mental health issues, and people with Autistic Spectrum Disorder (ASD). The methods are concrete, specific, and are not overly reliant on the spoken word, which is why the approach is offered to families of people with ASD. The techniques can also be easily adapted into story boards and other methods, which may help the child understand what changes are being made to resist their behaviour.\n\nThe intervention is based on a number of principles and assumptions. Most young people who act in defiant, aggressive or violent ways do this to control others around them. A key element of NVR is an understanding of the concept of ‘parental (or adult) presence.’ This refers to an awareness of the person of the parent and their authority at home, in school, and when the child is with their peers. It also includes parents not being pushed aside, and regaining their parental space in the family unit. Practitioners find that parents of violent children often feel helpless and isolated, and claim this is largely due to a lowered parental presence. NVR aims to increase the parents’ presence in their child's mind, and to reduce the parent's helplessness. One necessary measure in achieving this is the development of an adult support network. This is an essential element in this therapeutic process, where supporters in the network play vital roles, such as mentor, mediator, witness and protector. Some of the other methods for raising parental presence are briefly mentioned in the next section.\n\nAnother important principle in NVR is that of a delayed reaction: this refers to ‘striking when the iron is cold,’ or not reacting immediately to a situation, which avoids escalation. Instead, the issue is dealt with later at the resistor's choosing. This gives back power to the parent, and helps them regain parental authority and presence.\nFinally, the therapy works on the premise of using action, not words. This is particularly useful when NVR is applied to people with ASD, who struggle with social communication.\n\nThe approach endeavours to help parents gain authority. This is achieved through supporting parents to become active in four main areas:\n\nDe-escalation refers to refusing to be drawn into a battle with the other (escalation). Escalation can be symmetrical where parent and child each attempt to gain control over the other and raise levels of aggression in an upward spiral, or complementary, where parents give in to child demands or the threat of violence or other controlling responses and acquiesce to the child. In each case, the parents are believed to lose more of their authority, and family members are weakened and left more vulnerable. By developing strategies to manage risk with an NVR practitioner, the aim is that parents can build up their authority without getting involved in fruitless power struggles.\n\nThe parents seen in NVR therapy often attempt to “keep the peace” by following rules explicitly or implicitly set in place by their child. It is important to break the rules, in order to resist the violence. Parents therefore learn to break the rules that their child has set up; this ‘parental disobedience,’ is a key principle of the approach.\n\nNVR does not rely mainly on punishments or consequences for reducing unacceptable behaviours, but instead on increasing the parents ability to become present and resist aggressive or self-risk behaviours.\n\nReconciliation gestures play an important role in the therapy process. The purpose of the gestures is to show the young person that their families care for and love them. The gestures are also thought to help the individual and their parents relate to one another beyond the aggression, and reestablish a loving connection.\n\nIt is believed within the NVR field that when young people have experienced physical or sexual child abuse or neglect, their aggressive or dismissive behaviour can mask vulnerability, such as anxiety or fear, and/or an unmet need. Some areas of unmet needs are said to be:\n\n\nThe child's behavioural problems divert the attention of adult and child away from any unmet need and vulnerability. NVR claims that by raising their own sense of agency and strength in resisting the destructive behaviour, and then using their efforts at reconciliation to address the child's unmet needs, the adults can re-sensitise themselves for the child's distress and re-instate themselves in a caring position.\n\nNVR uses a variety of methods, many of which are outlined in the NVR parents’ manual. The resistance process is developed step by step with the NVR practitioner, in order to increase the parents’, carers’ or teachers’ confidence. Initially, the intervention begins with a written announcement; the therapist or NVR coach/practitioner supports and guides the parents and/or other adults in writing and planning how to carry out the announcement without escalation or engaging in unproductive communication.\n\nA support network is developed by the parents with the aid of a NVR practitioner throughout the process. The aim of this is to help them to remove the secrecy and expose the violence, and help them to feel supported in their actions. The support network also plays a role in carrying out action, such as participating in ‘sit ins,’ where parents and supporters sit in with the child after an aggressive incident and express their expectation that the child will develop a solution to the violence. Parents are encouraged to document acts of violence or self-destructive acts, as well as their own behaviour and responses around these, and to pass this information on to their supporters, in order to enable public accountability for their own and the young person's behaviour.\n\nThe supporters also play a role in a ‘campaign of concern’ or ‘message campaign,’ by contacting the young person and expressing their concern for them and others affected by their aggression. This is done to reinforce the parents’ or carers’ message of resistance.\n\nAfter any demonstration of resistance to the child's aggression, adults use reconciliation gestures to communicate their unconditional care, respect and love for the young person.\n\nFurther techniques are the telephone round and tailing, which are used as methods for raising adult presence where young people withdraw from their families into dangerous environments. Parents and other adults use these and other methods, draw upon their inter-personal resources, to effectively resist their child's violence and self-destructive behaviour by raising parental (adult) presence.\n\nNVR can be utilised with a range of difficulties such as anxiety and aggression in young people on the autistic spectrum, Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD) and other severe anxiety-related problems, when the child does not collaborate in treatment. NVR is now being used for self-isolation, adult entitled dependency, and a variety of other problem areas.\n\nRecently NVR has been developed as an intervention in a variety of different settings, such as residential care and foster care (Jakob and van Holen, in process). It is also being developed for other problematic areas, such as childhood obesity and chronic paediatric illness.\n\nNVR is a relatively new intervention amongst other psychological interventions. It was developed by Haim Omer and colleagues at the University of Tel Aviv, to support parents/carers in developing effective resistance against violence.\n\nNVR is widely used in Israel, Germany and a number of other European countries. In the English – speaking world, it has been mainly introduced to the UK.\n\nReviews indicate that systemic and multi-modal approaches are effective in decreasing destructive behaviour in adolescents with behavioural problems. The NVR approach applies traditions of Systemic (Family) Therapy, involving family members and institutions surrounding the individual in the therapy process, and change is brought about through the interactions between them.\n\nNVR has its roots in the philosophy and methods of socio-political nonviolent resistance, such as those used by Mahatma Gandhi and Martin Luther King. Gandhi practised and advocated non-violence when leading protests against those seeking to oppress him and his fellow men and women. He famously spoke out about non-violently fighting the British without arms, through being peaceful and non-retaliatory. The principle of non-violently resisting a child's controlling behaviour derives from the same ideas and beliefs. Gandhi also promoted solidarity, which is one of the aims the supporters’ network strives to evoke in the parents.\n\nFinally, the stance of de-escalation and refusal to be drawn into conflict can be summed up by a famous quote from Gandhi: “An eye for an eye makes the whole world blind”. It is these non-violent beliefs that provided the foundation for NVR.\n\nNVR has an emerging evidence base. A recent study showed that NVR was highly effective at improving the problematic behaviour of a large percentage of young people, with no differences between children and adolescents. It was further found that NVR reduced parents’ feelings of helplessness, increased their confidence, and it also improved parental mental health. Parental escalation also decreased within the first four months of the intervention. There was also a very low drop-out rate: over 90% of all families completed the programme.\n\nA study conducted in Germany compared NVR against TEEN Triple-P (a parenting programme for parents of teenagers) and a waiting list group. It was found that the TEEN triple-P and NVR groups showed significant improvements in parenting behaviour, parental presence, reduced parental depression and helplessness. NVR was superior to TEEN Triple-P in showing significant improvements in the 11- to 18-year-old children's externalising behaviour problems, assessed by Achenbach's. Child Behaviour Checklist (CBCL).\n\nFinally, research has shown an improvement in reduced parental submission, fewer power struggles and improvements in children's behaviour.\n\nPresently, there is a Randomized controlled trial (RCT) of NVR for looked after children being conducted in Belgium (Opvang).\n\nNonviolent Resistance\n\nMahatma Gandhi\n\nMartin Luther King\n\nFamily Therapy\n\n\n\n"}

The police were notified of the body’s location by an anonymous caller who claimed that they could not give their name for reasons of ‘national security’. Neither the identity of the woman nor the caller has ever been established despite an extensive investigation. \n\nOn Friday 28 August 1981, at around 8:00 am, C John Jeffries of Ripon Police received a telephone call at the Police Station from a man who was described as well-spoken with a slight trace of a local accent. The caller stated: “\"Near Scawton Moor House, you will find a decomposed body among the willow herbs.”\" The caller then gave instructions on how to find the body. The called lasted for less than a minute and when the caller was asked for his name and address he stated that he could not give this information for “\"reasons of national security\"” and he abruptly terminated the call. \n\nThe local village constable attended the location identified but could not initially find the body, however, after careful searching, he uncovered human bones underneath a large bed of Rosebay Willow. The CID were called to the scene and cleared a large area of undergrowth.\n\nThe body was discovered near to Sutton Bank Top on an unclassified road between Sutton Bank and Scawton and Rievaulx near the junction with the A170 Thirsk to Scarborough Road. \n\nIt is thought that the body had lain undisturbed for up to two years. A clue was a discarded lid from a tin of meat paste, which was found to have been sold on 6 October 1979, which was found beneath the body. Police believe the woman was murdered but have never revealed how she died.\n\nThe body was so well concealed that it was highly improbable that it could have been discovered by accident despite the fact that the location was near to the entrance to Scawton Moor House Farm which was a popular family picnic area. The anonymous caller was later a suspect in the murder but their identity was never established.\n\nIn life, the woman was tall. She had dark brown hair with a length of around 4-6 inches which was untreated and cut in a page-boy style. The victim’s toenails were painted with Max Factor Maxi, pale-pink and she wore a size four shoe. \n\nThe woman had given birth to two or three children during her life and although no wedding ring was found it is believed that she had been married. No jewellery or clothing of any kind was found with the body implying that someone had tried to conceal the victims identity. \n\nAnalysis of the skeleton revealed that the victim had a neck vertebrae abnormality which would have caused a bad back in life. The victim also had a displaced septum and an old ankle fracture. Bone analysis revealed that until the age of seven, the woman lived in an area with high levels of natural fluoride in the drinking water, two local areas that had such water were Hartlepool and Grimsby.\n\nAll the victims upper teeth, and all but six of her lower teeth, were missing and an upper dental plate had been fitted. The woman had heavy staining on her remaining teeth which indicated that she smoked and drank heavily and did not pay much attention to herself in life.\n\nFollowing the investigation of the site of the discovery the wider investigation discovered some female clothing, a black evening gown and some underwear, hanging from a tree about a mile away from the location of the body. The items could not be proved to relate to the discovery of the woman but no one has come forward to claim them.\n\nPolice investigated the possibility that the woman was an escaped inmate from Askham Grange open prison. However, the prisoner unexpectedly responded to a request to prove that she was still alive by sending investigating officers two thumb prints and a signature on a blank sheet of paper.\n\nIn November 1981 medical students constructed a waxwork of the woman in one of the first examples of using this technique to identify an unknown decedent.\n\nIn 2012, the body was exhumed so that a DNA profile could be created. The profile was compared to samples from five families, two of whom came forward of their own volition, that could potentially be related to the woman. No match was found.\n\nIn 2013 police stated that they had added the woman’s DNA profile to the national database in the hope that a match would be found in the future.\n"}

Later, his image was adopted as the eagle appearing on a globe in Case Corporation's logo and as the screaming eagle on the insignia of the U.S. Army's 101st Airborne Division.\n\nOld Abe was captured by Ahgamahwegezhig or \"Chief Sky\". He was the son of Ah-mous (translated either as \"The Little Bee\" or \"Thunder of Bees\"), who was an influential leader of the Lac du Flambeau Ojibwe.\n\nIn spring of 1861, Chief Sky set up a hunting and fishing camp near the South Fork of the Flambeau River, within the present day Chequamegon National Forest, east of Park Falls, Wisconsin. Here, he noticed a treetop nest, with two fledgling eagles, and to capture them, cut down the tree. One eaglet died from the fall, and the other became the young Indian's pet. That summer, Chief Sky and his father canoed down the Chippewa River on a trading expedition. At Jim Falls, Wisconsin, they encountered Daniel McCann, who lived nearby in Eagle Point. The Indians sold the eagle to McCann in exchange for a bushel of corn.\n\nIn August 1861, John C. Perkins, assisted by Seth Pierce, Frank McGuire, Thomas G. Butler and Victor Wolf, recruited a company of volunteers from Eau Claire and Chippewa Counties. This company was called the \"Eau Claire Badgers\". Soon after its formation, McCann offered to sell the eagle to the Badgers, for $2.50. In his \"History of Old Abe\", published in 1865, Joseph O. Barrett, who helped McCann bring the eagle to Eau Claire, gave a description of the transaction, which can be paraphrased as:\n\n\"Will you buy my eagle,\" said McCann, \"only two dollars and a half?\"<br><br>\n\"Here, boys, let's put in twenty five cents apiece,\" answered Frank McGuire, who began to\ncollect quarters.<br><br>\nHe also solicited a contribution from a civilian, S. M. Jeffers, but was rebuffed. When the soldiers heard of this, they accosted Jeffers, and gave him three lusty groans. When he understood that they were protesting against his reluctance to help buy the eagle, Jeffers laughed, paid for the bird with a Quarter Eagle and presented him to the Company. After that, he had cheers instead of groans. The quarters were returned to the donors.\n\nCaptain Perkins named the eagle after President Abraham Lincoln, his quartermaster, Francis L. Billings, made a special perch on which to carry the bird into battle, and a young soldier, James McGinnis, volunteered to take care of him.\n\nOn September 3, 1861, the Badgers embarked, aboard the steamer \"Stella Whipple\", on a trip down the Chippewa to the Mississippi and up the Wisconsin River to Madison, Wisconsin. They arrived on the 6th and were immediately mustered into service as Company C of the 8th Wisconsin Volunteer Infantry Regiment. They became the regimental color company and were given the name \"Eagle Company\". The regiment also became the \"Eagle Regiment\". After a few weeks of training at Camp Randall, it began to play an important role in the Western Theater of the American Civil War.\n\nOn October, 12, the regiment left for St. Louis, Missouri, where the eagle got loose and flew out of sight. Fortunately, a policeman soon returned him. On the following day, the regiment left by rail to Fredericktown, Missouri, and on October 20, 1861, took part in the battle of Fredericktown. Subsequently, they were assigned guard duty until March 4, 1862, when they relocated to Point Pleasant, near New Madrid, Missouri, where they became part of General John Pope's Army of the Mississippi. From this base, during March and April, they participated in the Battle of Island Number Ten, which ended with a major victory that opened the Mississippi to Union forces down to Fort Pillow, just above Memphis. Thousands of Confederate prisoners were taken, along with valuable supplies.\n\nIn May 1862, the 8th participated in General Henry Halleck's Siege of Corinth, whose objective was to secure a critical rail junction of the Mobile & Ohio and Memphis & Charleston railroads. On May 9, 1862, during the approach to Corinth, the Eagle Company experienced its first serious combat at the Battle of Farmington, Mississippi, during which Old Abe Spread his wings and screamed. Here, Captain Perkins died and was replaced by the newly promoted Captain Victor Wolf. On May 29, after a skirmish at defensive works before Corinth, the Confederates withdrew during the night. The next day, the regiment marched into the city. That day, James McGinnis became sick with a fatal illness and was replaced as eagle bearer by Thomas J. Hill, who served until David McLain took over on August 18.\n\nOn August 22, after being bivouacked in summer quarters, the regiment arrived in Tuscumbia, Alabama, which is in the northwest corner of the state a few miles from the Mississippi border. By this time, General Ulysses S. Grant had taken over Halleck's responsibilities in northern Mississippi. The 8th Wisconsin was still part of the Army of the Mississippi, but General William Rosecrans had replaced Pope as commander. The regiment was in the second brigade of General David S. Stanley's second division, which was led by Colonel Joseph A. Mower. Pope's army was assigned to hold 20 miles of rail from Corinth east to Iuka, where the 8th Wisconsin was stationed. On September 13, 1862, the Confederate Army of the West under General Sterling Price appeared at Iuka and forced the regiment back to Farmington.\n\nShortly thereafter, forces under Rosecrans and General Edward Ord attempted to capture Price's army, which awaited, at Iuka, the arrival of massive reinforcements from General Earl Van Dorn's Army of West Tennessee. On September 19, during the Battle of Iuka, a fresh north wind caused an acoustic shadow that prevented Ord from hearing the battle. Consequently, he was unaware of it, and his troops stood idle while fighting raged a few miles away. Nevertheless, the Army of the Cumberland forced Price to withdraw during the night. He soon linked up with Van Dorn in Ripley.\n\nOn October 3 and 4, the combined Confederate armies launched a full-scale assault on Corinth, which was repulsed by troops under Rosecrans. During heavy fighting in this Second Battle of Corinth, 21 soldiers of the 8th Wisconsin died, and 60 were wounded. Colonel Mower was wounded in the neck and briefly captured.\n\nNewspaper accounts of this battle claimed that Old Abe soared over the front lines. According to David McLain, these stories are exaggerated:\n\n… a bullet cut the cord that held the eagle to his perch. About the same time that the cord was cut, Old Abe was shot through one wing, cutting out three quill feathers, but not drawing blood, and the bearer (McLain) was shot through the left shoulder of his blouse and right leg of his pants.<br><br>\n… (The eagle) flew about 50 feet down the line, must have been what caused the newspapers to come out the next week with great headlines telling about the eagle of the 8th Wisconsin getting away after a rebel bullet cut his cord and soaring, over the lines of both armies, and back to his perch, which is not so.<br><br>\nHe was quite excited always in battle and he'd spread his wings and scream but never flew over the lines of either army.\n\nOn November 2, 1862, the regiment moved to Grand Junction, Tennessee, where it joined forces being assembled for General Grant's first attempt to take the strategic river city of Vicksburg. From this base, Grant moved down the Mississippi Central Railroad in conjunction with General William Tecumseh Sherman, who launched a simultaneous advance north of the city. Confederates attempted to defend the railroad's Tallahatchie River bridge near Abbeville, but retreated when they learned of a flanking maneuver by Grant. Skirmishes were fought along the railroad to Oxford, and the Confederates were pushed south past Water Valley, but after the battle of Coffeeville, managed to stall the Federal advance at Oakland.\n\nDuring this push, the 8th Wisconsin, with Old Abe, was in the thick of the fighting. In Oxford, the regiment was accosted by a southern girl who scornfully exclaimed: \"Oh! See that \"Yankee Buzzard\".\", enraging the men, drawing a verbal response from the 8th's ranks that caused her to retreat hastily to her house. This was a name by which southern civilians and soldiers referred to Old Abe. Under orders from their officers, Confederate troops made numerous attempts to kill or capture the eagle, but they never succeeded.\n\nOn December 20, while Grant was stalled, General Van Dorn led a successful cavalry raid on the Union supply base at Holly Springs. After destroying the supplies, Van Dorn and General Nathan Bedford Forest moved north into Tennessee tearing up railroad and telegraph lines. With his infrastructure disrupted, and with Sherman's advance turned back at Chickasaw Bayou, Grant was forced to end the campaign and retire to Memphis.\n\nAt the time of Van Dorn's raid, the Wisconsin regiment was stationed in Holly Springs on guard duty. Its troops were surprised, overwhelmed, captured, and immediately paroled. Consequently, their commander, Colonel Murphy, was dismissed. He was replaced by Lieutenant Colonel Robbins, who was promoted to Colonel. On December 28, when the regiment had moved to La Grange, Tennessee, David McLain turned over his job as eagle bearer to Ed Homeston.\n\nIn March 1863, the regiment went to Helena, Arkansas, where it became part of Grant's plan to cross the Mississippi south of Vicksburg. His objectives were to separate Vicksburg from Confederate units under General Joseph E. Johnston and to prevent supplies from reaching the city on the Southern Railroad.\n\nFrom Helena, the regiment went to Young's Point, Louisiana, where they joined the second brigade of the third division of Sherman's XV Corps, under the command of Brigadier General Mower, who had been promoted on November 29, 1862. Here, on April 13, 1863, a promotion to Lieutenant Colonel went to Major John Wayles Jefferson. He had been with the regiment since it was formed, and as the grandson of Sally Hemings, is believed to have been also a grandson of Thomas Jefferson.\n\nOn May 2, Sherman's corps crossed the river at Grand Gulf and proceeded toward Raymond, Mississippi, which the XVII Corps under General James B. McPherson occupied on May 12. Sherman bypassed Raymond and advanced on Jackson, which he and McPherson took on May 14, and from which Johnston had withdrawn. After Sherman appointed Mower as military governor of Jackson, Union troops burned part of the town, destroyed numerous factories, and cut the railroad connections with Vicksburg. Grant's objectives were further consolidated when his army prevailed at the Battle of Champion Hill on May 16 and at the Battle of Big Black River Bridge on May 17. On May 22, the regiment participated in Grant's all-out assault on Vicksburg. \nWhen this operation failed, Grant reluctantly settled into a siege.\n\nDuring the siege, the 8th Wisconsin left Vicksburg to participate in an expedition to Mechanicsburg, Mississippi, where Benjamin Hilliker was severely wounded on June 4, 1863. They then returned to Young's Point where they blocked Confederates from escaping westward from Vicksburg. From this encampment, Sherman despatched them as part of a force assigned to drive General John G. Walker's Confederates from Richmond, Louisiana. This objective was accomplished by the Battle of Richmond, on June 15, after which the 8th returned to Young's Point.\n\nOn July 12, 1863, the regiment returned to Vicksburg, shortly after its surrender on July 4. Subsequently, the regiment camped in various places near Vicksburg, from which they joined several mop-up operations. During this period, in September, Ed Homeston resigned his position as eagle bearer, John Burkhardt took charge of Old Abe, and Colonel Robbins was replaced by Lieutenant Colonel Jefferson. Under his command, the regiment joined McPherson's expedition to Canton, from October 14 to 20, and participated in expeditions toward Pocahontas, Arkansas against General Nathan Bedford Forest. From February 3, 1864, until March 5, they took part in Sherman's Meridian expedition against an important railroad center and arsenal in eastern Mississippi.\n\nIn the following letter to Governor Edward Salomon, General William T. Sherman summarized the activities of the Eighth Wisconsin during the Vicksburg campaign:\n\nH 15 A C,<br>\nSept. 21st, 1863<br><br><br>\n\"To His Excellency, the Governor of Wisconsin:\"<br><br>\nSir Lt. Col. Jefferson, of the Eighth Wisconsin, is about to start for his home on a short leave of absence, during the period of rest allowed us by the lull of military events in this quarter. I avail myself of the opportunity to express to you my personal and official approbation of the entire regiment since I have had the honor to count it as one of my command. The Eighth Wisconsin has ever done its whole duty, in the camp, on the march and in battle. It has shared with us all the honors and success of our conquest of Mississippi and has displayed peculiar courage and gallantry at Jackson, May 14th, and throughout the siege of Vicksburg.<br><br>\nIt also, under the leadership of Gen. Mower, cleared the west bank of the river, driving the enemy out of Richmond, La., and bore patiently and manfully the deadly sickness of Young's Point, till the fall of Vicksburg admitted of its recall to join us on this higher and more healthy ground. I am glad to report that the men are fast recovering from the sickness caused by that exposure, and I hope it will share with us our future labors and honors. If within your power, I hope you will fill its thinned ranks, and then I will promise all I can to ensure its return to your State, bearing a full share of honor and fame in the establishment of our General Government on a basis so firm, that no internal or external power can shake it during this generation.<br><br>\nWith great respect, etc.,<br>\nW. T. SHERMAN,<br>\n\"Maj. Gen.\"\n\nSherman was not the only general who had a high regard for the 8th Wisconsin and Old Abe. In the words of David McLain:\n\nI have frequently seen Generals Grant, Sherman, McPherson, Rosecrans, Blair, Logan, and others, when they were passing our regiment, raise their hats as they passed Old Abe, which always brought a cheer from the regiment and then the eagle would spread his wings …\n\nIn early 1864, many soldiers in the 8th Wisconsin became eligible for veteran furlough. However, General Sherman made a special request that they join General A. J. Smith's forces who had been assigned to the Red River Campaign, along with troops from the Army of the Gulf, under General Nathaniel P. Banks, and Admiral David Dixon Porter's Mississippi River Squadron. After agreeing to Sherman's request, the regiment joined the Right Wing of the XVI Corps, under the command of General Mower. On March 10, 1864, the contingent began a voyage from Vicksburg down the Mississippi and up the Red River to Simmesport, Louisiana, where they disembarked on March 12. Two days later, Mower's command surprised and captured Fort DeRussy, which opened the river up to Alexandria.\n\nAfter arriving there on March 16, the troops from Vicksburg settled down to wait for Banks to arrive and to assess opposing forces under General Richard Taylor, who was the son of President Zachary Taylor. While waiting, General Mower assembled a task force, with which he proceeded twenty five miles to Henderson's hill on Bayou Rapides. Here, he encountered Confederate defenses. After leaving a blocking force to engage the defenders at the front, he made a detour of 15 miles to get to their rear, where he arrived around midnight on the cold and rainy night of March 21. On the way, a courier from General Taylor was captured and provided the countersign. This enabled Mower's forces, including the 8th Wisconsin, to overcome the defenses without a shot being fired. In addition to 262 prisoners, 4 guns and 400 horses were taken.\n\nThis success made it possible for Smith's army to move quickly upriver to Grand Ecore, where it prepared to support forces of General Banks, which were advancing on Shreveport. On April 8, Banks was routed by Taylor at the Battle of Mansfield. This was a decisive victory, for it stopped the Union advance and turned the campaign into a general retreat.\n\nThat evening, retreating units under Banks reached Pleasant Hill nearly simultaneously with Smith's XVII and XVI Corps, which included the 8th Wisconsin. These reinforcements enabled the Union to win the next day's Battle of Pleasant Hill, but Banks immediately ordered a retreat to Grand Ecore, and from there, to Alexandria. During this retreat, the regiment fought rear guard actions at Natchitoches, Monett's Ferry, and Cloutierville.\n\nAfter Smith's forces arrived in Alexandria on April 26, they were temporarily deployed to prevent attacks during Joseph Bailey's attempts to get Porter's squadron over the rapids there, with the aid of Bailey's Dam and two small wing dams upstream. After this task was completed, Banks resumed his retreat on May 13, leaving Alexandria in flames.\n\nOn May 16, Union forces reached Mansura where Taylor's army attempted to prevent them from reaching river transportation. After heavy fighting, the Confederates fell back, and the Union troops marched toward Simmesport, where Bailey was building a bridge over the Atchafalaya River that would allow them to reach transport ships. On the 18th, Banks learned that Taylor's force was deployed near Yellow Bayou and arranged for Mower to stop the Confederates. After several hours of see-saw action, the ground cover caught fire and forced both sides to retire. The next day, Smith's army embarked and reached Vicksburg on the 24th.\n\nIn early June 1864, General Smith ordered Mower to launch a forceful demonstration to deter interference with Mississippi river traffic near Lake Village, Arkansas. This town is named for its location on Lake Chicot, an oxbow lake formed from the Mississippi. On the evening of June 5, Mower disembarked and camped near Sunnyside Landing. The next morning, as he marched along the south side of the lake, Confederates, led by General Colton Greene, fought a delaying action at Ditch Bayou and then withdrew. The Union troops advanced to Lake Village, camped there overnight, and the next day, boarded transports that took them to Memphis. At Ditch Bayou, the regiment lost 3 killed and 16 wounded.\n\nOn June 19, 1864, 240 reenlisted veterans left Memphis on furlough, with their eagle. They arrived at Chicago on the 21st. The next day, flags were displayed along the streets of Madison, the bells of the city were rung, and a national salute was fired. At the Capitol, crowds of citizens assembled to greet the veterans and Old Abe. Here, they were addressed by several dignitaries, including General Lucius Fairchild, Colonel Jefferson and Chauncey Abbott, who was a former mayor of Madison.\n\nA few days later, on June 26, 56 veterans of Company C arrived at Eau Claire, with the eagle, and were greeted with booming cannons, martial music, patriotic songs, and an abundant feast. Citizens of Chippewa Falls constructed a huge wigwam. Here, according to Reverend Joseph O. Barrett, who spoke at the celebration, a great feast was served to Old Abe and the soldiers on July 4, 1864. Afterwards, a procession circled through the streets, headed by a band, the eagle and the veterans.\n\nIn August 1864, the veterans and Old Abe returned from furlough to Memphis. During their absence, the regiment had been active in northern Mississippi. Following Forrest's victory over a large Union force at Brice's Crossroads, on June 10, 1864, Sherman vowed to track him down with forces under \"two officers at Memphis who will fight all the time, A. J. Smith and J. A. Mower.\" A month later, Mower's four brigades overtook Forrest near Tupelo, Mississippi, repulsed a series of attacks, and inflicted hundreds of casualties, including the slight wounding of Forrest himself. On August 13, 1864, the day after Mower had been promoted to Major General, the regiment, including the returned troops, participated in another defeat of Forrest's command at Hurricane Creek, Mississippi This was Old Abe's last battle.\n\nSeptember 16, 1864, marked the end of the three years for which original members of the 8th Wisconsin had enlisted. Consequently, the veterans headed north with the eagle, whom the regiment had agreed to give to the state of Wisconsin. On September 21, they reached Chicago, where John Burkhardt resigned as eagle bearer and turned Old Abe over to John H. Hill, who had been disabled by a wound at Corinth. He was the brother of Thomas J. Hill who had also served as eagle bearer. The next day, Hill bore the eagle into Madison at the head of 70 veterans, of which 26 were from Company C. Here, on the 26th, Captain Victor Wolf presented Old Abe to Governor James T. Lewis, who handed the eagle, with its perch, to Quartermaster General N. F. Lund.\n\nAfter Wisconsin took possession of Old Abe, state officials classified him as a \"War Relic\" and created an \"Eagle Department\" in the Capitol building, which included a two-room \"apartment,\" a custom bathtub for the eagle, and a caretaker. Later John Hill served in this capacity.\n\nOld Abe became a nationally known celebrity, whose presence at events was requested by individuals and organizations from the state and the country. Old Abe appeared at the 1876 Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and the 1880 Grand Army of the Republic National Convention. Other events were fundraisers for charities, which included: the 1865 Northwest Sanitary Fair in Illinois, Soldiers' Home Fair, Soldier's Orphan's Home, Harvey Hospital, and Ladies Aid Society of Chippewa Falls.\n\nIn February 1881, a small fire broke out in the basement of the Capitol. After Old Abe raised an alarm, the fire was quickly put out. However, the eagle inhaled a large amount of thick black smoke, and about a month later, lost strength and began to decline. On March 26, 1881, in spite of the efforts of numerous doctors, Old Abe died in the arms of caretaker George Gilles.\n\nOn September 17, 1881, Old Abe's stuffed remains were placed in a glass display case located in the rotunda of the Capitol. Four years later, Old Abe was moved, within the Capitol, from the rotunda to the G.A.R. Memorial Hall. In 1900, his remains were transferred to the new building of the State Historical Society of Wisconsin. However, pressure from veterans convinced Governor Robert M. La Follette to return Old Abe to the Capitol building in 1903. That year, President Theodore Roosevelt viewed the remains and expressed his pleasure at being able to see the eagle he had studied in school as a child. However, in 1904, Old Abe's remains and the glass case were destroyed in a fire that razed the Capitol building.\n\nSince 1915, a replica of Old Abe has presided over the Wisconsin State Assembly Chamber in the Capitol, and another is on display at the Wisconsin Veterans Museum in Madison. A stone sculpture of the eagle is at the top of the Camp Randall Arch.\n\nIn 1865, Jerome Case incorporated Old Abe into the trademark of the J. I. Case agricultural equipment manufacturing company of Racine, Wisconsin. This trademark was retired in 1969.\n\nThe insignia of the U.S. Army's 101st Airborne Division is a depiction of Old Abe. Wisconsin was the territory of the original 101st Division after World War I, and the insignia's design is based on Civil War traditions of the state. The black shield derives from black hats worn by members of the Iron Brigade. This was a famous Civil War unit composed of western regiments, which included three from Wisconsin, but not the 8th regiment.\n\nOld Abe is the mascot of Eau Claire Memorial High School, whose athletic teams are known as \"Old Abes\", and of Racine Case High School, whose teams are \"Eagles\".\n\n"}

Most of the songs he sang were written by Ramprasad Sen and Kamalakanta Bhattacharya, both of whom were Shakta poets of Bengal. He was eight years younger than his elder brother Dhananjay Bhattacharya. He developed a special style of singing, Shyama Sangeet, that continues to be used. He committed suicide at the age of 36.\n\nVery little is known about his background. Even the Bengali 'Cąritavidan' does not provide adequate information about his early life or childhood. He was born in Bally, Barendrapara, Howrah and spent most of his life there.\n\nPannalal started singing in 1947, at the age of 17, with another renowned musician, Sanat Sinha. His elder brother Prafulla took them both to a program, where none of them were allowed to sing because of the immaturity in their voices. They encountered the same problem at HMV. They got their first break in Megaphone. At first Pannalal sang modern Bengali songs, until Bishwanath Kumar, a friend of Sanat Sinha signed him for his first hit Shyama sangeet, \"Aamar sadh na mitilo aasha na purilo, sokoli phuraye jay ma...\" (None of my desires were fulfilled, nor my hopes have come true, O mother...). This rendition is now acclaimed as a classic in Bengal. However, \"Aamar Sadhna mitilo\" wasn't Pannalal's first Shyama sangeet record. His earlier and popular songs include \"Aamar Mayer Paye Jaba Hoye\", \"Tui naki Ma Dayamayee\", Tui je Kemon Dayamayee\", \"Sakali Tomari Ichha\", \"Amay De Ma Pagal Kore\", \"Muchiye De Ma Aamar a Duti Nayan\", \"Moneri basona shyama\" among others.\n\nPannalal was married and cared well for his family until his death in 1966. After his death his elder brother Dhananjay bore the responsibility of Pannalal's family, along with his own.\n\nPannalal developed a special style of singing, that with devotion. His distinct voice and a spirit filled with devotion have touched the hearts of countless devotees of Mother Kali across Bengal. He became a great devotee of Kali and always remained engrossed in her thoughts. Pannalal and his elder brother Dhananjay Bhattacharya, another eminent singer of Shyama Sangeet, wanted to please Kali by offering her their songs. One doesn't need to necessarily know Bengali to empathize with his unparalleled tune dripping with devotion regardless of belief. One will feel his climbing, devoted prayer to Mother Kali mounting in his own heart.\n\nIn the last years, Pannalal looked morose for some unknown reason. It is claimed by some that Dhananjay, received the divine grace of Mother Kali, the Exalted, but Pannalal didn't, and so he committed suicide on 27 March 1966, in his house on Kakulia Road. He died only at a very young age of 36, but he has claimed a paramount position in the hearts of thousands of Kali devotees since his first Shyama Sangeet performance.\n\nDhananjay Bhattacharya\n\n\n"}
{"id": "12459821", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12459821", "title": "Pelvic girdle pain", "text": "Pelvic girdle pain\n\nPelvic girdle pain (abbreviated PGP) is a pregnancy discomfort that causes pain, instability and limitation of mobility and functioning in any of the three pelvic joints. PGP has a long history of recognition, mentioned by Hippocrates and later described in medical literature by Snelling.\n\nPrior to the 20th century, specialists of pregnancy-related PGP used varying terminologies. It is now referred to as Pregnancy Related Pelvic Girdle Pain that may incorporate the following conditions:\n\n\n\"\"The classification between hormonal and mechanical pelvic girdle instability is no longer used. For treatment and/or prognosis it makes no difference whether the complaints started during pregnancy or after childbirth.\" Mens (2005)\"\n\nA combination of postural changes,baby, unstable pelvic joints under the influence of pregnancy hormones, and changes in the centre of gravity can all add to the varying degrees of pain or discomfort. In some cases it can come on suddenly or following a fall, sudden abduction of the thighs (opening too wide too quickly) or an action that has strained the joint.\n\nPGP can begin as early as the first trimester of pregnancy. Pain is usually felt low down over the symphyseal joint, and this area may be extremely tender to the touch. Pain may also be felt in the hips, groin and lower abdomen and can radiate down the inner thighs. Women suffering from PGP may begin to waddle or shuffle, and may be aware of an audible clicking sound coming from the pelvis. PGP can develop slowly during pregnancy, gradually gaining in severity as the pregnancy progresses.\n\nDuring pregnancy and postpartum, the symphyseal gap can be felt moving or straining when walking, climbing stairs or turning over in bed; these activities can be difficult or even impossible. The pain may remain static, e.g., in one place such as the front of the pelvis, producing the feeling of having been kicked; in other cases it may start in one area and move to other areas. It is also possible that a woman may experience a combination of symptoms.\n\nAny weight bearing activity has the potential of aggravating an already unstable pelvis, producing symptoms that may limit the ability of the woman to carry out many daily activities. She may experience pain involving movements such as dressing, getting in and out of the bath, rolling in bed, climbing the stairs or sexual activity. Pain may also be present when lifting, carrying, pushing or pulling.\n\nThe symptoms (and their severity) experienced by women with PGP vary, but include:\n\n\nThe severity and instability of the pelvis can be measured on a three level scale.\n\nPelvic type 1:The pelvic ligaments support the pelvis sufficiently. Even when the\nmuscles are used incorrectly, no complaints will occur when performing everyday activities. This is the most common situation in persons who have never been pregnant, who have never been in an accident, and who are not hypermobile.\"\n\nPelvic type 2:The ligaments alone do not support the joint sufficiently. A\ncoordinated use of muscles around the joint will compensate for ligament weakness. In case the muscles around the joint do not function, the patient will experience pain and weakness when performing everyday activities. This type often occurs after giving birth to a child weighing 3000 grams or more, in cases of hypermobility, and sometimes after an accident involving the pelvis. Type 2 is the most common form of pelvic instability. Treatment is based on learning how to use the muscles around the pelvis more efficiently.\n\nPelvic type 3:The ligaments do not support the joint sufficiently. This is a serious\nsituation whereby the muscles around the joint are unable to compensate for ligament weakness. This type of pelvic instability usually only occurs after an accident, or occasionally after a (small) accident in combination with giving birth. Sometimes a small accident occurring long before giving birth is forgotten so that the pelvic instability is attributed only to the childbirth. Although the difference between Type 2 and 3 is often difficult to establish, in case of doubt an exercise program may help the patient. However, if Pelvic Type 3 has been diagnosed then invasive treatment is the only option: in this case parts of the pelvis are screwed together. (Mens 2005)\n\nPGP in pregnancy seriously interferes with participation in society and activities of daily life; the average sick leave due to posterior pelvic pain during pregnancy is 7 to 12 weeks.\n\nIn some cases women with PGP may also experience emotional problems such as anxiety over the cause of pain, resentment, anger, lack of self-esteem, frustration and depression; she is three times more likely to suffer postpartum depressive symptoms. Other psychosocial risk factors associated with woman experiencing PGP include higher level of stress, low job satisfaction and poorer relationship with spouse.\n\nSometimes there is no obvious explanation for the cause of PGP but usually there is a combination of factors such as:\n\n\nPregnancy related Pelvic Girdle Pain (PGP) can be either specific (trauma or injury to pelvic joints or genetical i.e. connective tissue disease) and non-specific. PGP disorder is complex and multi-factorial and likely to be also represented by a series of sub-groups driven by pain varying from peripheral or central nervous system,\naltered laxity/stiffness of muscles, laxity to injury of tendinous/ligamentous structures to ‘mal-adaptive’ body mechanics.\n\nPregnancy begins the physiological changes through a pattern of hormonal secretion and signal transduction thus initiating the remodelling of soft tissues, cartilage and ligaments. Over time, the ligaments could be stretched either by injury or excess strain and in turn may cause PGP.\n\nThe pelvis is the largest bony part of the skeleton and contains three joints: the pubic symphysis, and two sacroiliac joints. A highly durable network of ligaments surrounds these joints giving them tremendous strength.\n\nThe pubic symphysis has a fibrocartilage joint which may contain a fluid filled cavity and is avascular; it is supported by the superior and arcuate ligaments. The sacroiliac joints are synovial, but their movement is restricted throughout life and they are progressively obliterated by adhesions. The nature of the bony pelvic ring with its three joints determines that no one joint can move independently of the other two.\n\nRelaxin is a hormone produced mainly by the corpus luteum of the ovary and breast, in both pregnant and non-pregnant females. During pregnancy it is also produced by the placenta, chorion, and decidua. The body produces relaxin during menstruation that rises to a peak within approximately 14 days of ovulation and then declines. In pregnant cycles, rather than subsiding, relaxin secretion continues to rise during the first trimester and then again in the final weeks. During pregnancy relaxin has a diverse range of effects, including the production and remodelling of collagen thus increasing the elasticity of muscles, tendons, ligaments and tissues of the birth canal in view of delivery.\n\nAlthough relaxin's main cellular action in pregnancy is to remodel collagen by biosynthesis (thus facilitating the changes of connective tissue) it does not seem to generate musculoskeletal problems. European Research has determined that relaxin levels are not a predictor of PGP during pregnancy.\n\nThe pregnant woman has a different pattern of \"gait\". The step lengthens as the pregnancy progresses due to weight gain and changes in posture. Both the length and height of the footstep shortens with PGP. Sometimes the foot can turn inwards due to the rotation of the hips when the pelvic joints are unstable. On average, a woman's foot can grow by a half size or more during pregnancy. Pregnancy hormones that are released to adapt the bodily changes also remodel the ligaments in the foot. In addition, the increased body weight of pregnancy, fluid retention and weight gain lowers the arches, further adding to the foot's length and width. There is an increase of load on the lateral side of the foot and the hind foot. These changes may also be responsible for the musculoskeletal complaints of lower limb pain in pregnant women.\n\nDuring the motion of walking, an upward movement of the pelvis, one side then the other, is required to let the leg follow through. The faster or longer each step the pelvis adjusts accordingly. The flexibility within the knees, ankles and hips are stabilized by the pelvis. Normal gait tends to minimize displacement of centre of gravity whereas abnormal gait through pelvic instability tends to amplify displacement. During pregnancy there may be an increased demand placed on hip abductor, hip extensor, and ankle plantar flexor muscles during walking. To avoid pain on weight bearing structures a very short stance phase and limp occurs on the injured side(s), this is called Antalgic Gait.\n\nA number of treatments have some evidence for benefits include an exercise program. Paracetamol (acetaminophen) has not been found effective but is safe. NSAIDs are sometimes effective but should not be used after 30 weeks of pregnancy. There is tentative evidence for acupuncture.\n\nSome pelvic joint trauma will not respond to conservative type treatments and orthopedic surgery might become the only option to stabilize the joints.\n\nFor most women, PGP resolves in weeks after delivery but for some it can last for years resulting in a reduced tolerance for weight bearing activities. PGP can take from 11 weeks, 6 months or even up to 2 years postpartum to subside. However, some research supports that the average time to complete recovery is 6.25 years, and the more severe the case is, the longer recovery period.\n\nOverall, about 45% of all pregnant women and 25% of all women postpartum suffer from PGP. During pregnancy, serious pain occurs in about 25%, and severe disability in about 8% of patients. After pregnancy, problems are serious in about 7%. There is no correlation between age, culture, nationality and numbers of pregnancies that determine a higher incidence of PGP.\n\nIf a woman experiences PGP during one pregnancy, she is more likely to experience it in subsequent pregnancies; but the severity cannot be determined.\n\n"}
{"id": "17808671", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17808671", "title": "Schema (genetic algorithms)", "text": "Schema (genetic algorithms)\n\nA schema is a template in computer science used in the field of genetic algorithms that identifies a subset of strings with similarities at certain string positions. Schemata are a special case of cylinder sets; and so form a topological space.\n\nFor example, consider binary strings of length 6. The schema 1**0*1 describes the set of all words of length 6 with 1's at the first and sixth positions and a 0 at the fourth position. The * is a wildcard symbol, which means that positions 2, 3 and 5 can have a value of either 1 or 0. The \"order of a schema\" is defined as the number of fixed positions in the template, while the \"defining length\" formula_1 is the distance between the first and last specific positions. The order of 1**0*1 is 3 and its defining length is 5. The \"fitness of a schema\" is the average fitness of all strings matching the schema. The fitness of a string is a measure of the value of the encoded problem solution, as computed by a problem-specific evaluation function.\n\nThe length of a schema formula_2, called formula_3, is defined as the total number of nodes in the schema. formula_3 is also equal to the number of nodes in the programs matching formula_2.\n\nIf the child of an individual that matches schema H does not \"itself\" match H, the schema is said to have been \"disrupted\".\n\nIn evolutionary computing such as genetic algorithms and genetic programming, propagation refers to the inheritance of characteristics of one generation by the next. For example, a schema is propagated if individuals in the current generation match it and so do those in the next generation. Those in the next generation may be (but don't have to be) children of parents who matched it.\n\nRecently schema have been studied using order theory.\n\nTwo basic operators are defined for schema: expansion and compression. The expansion maps a schema onto a set of words which it represents, while the compression maps a set of words on to a schema.\n\nIn the following definitions formula_6 denotes an alphabet, formula_7 denotes all words of length formula_8 over the alphabet formula_6, formula_10 denotes the alphabet formula_11 with the extra symbol formula_12. formula_13 denotes all schema of length formula_8 over the alphabet formula_10 as well as the empty schema formula_16.\nFor any schema formula_17 the following operator formula_18, called the formula_19 of formula_20, which maps formula_20 to a subset of words in formula_22:\n\nformula_23\n\nWhere subscript formula_24 denotes the character at position formula_24 in a word or schema. When formula_26 then formula_27. More simply put, formula_18 is the set of all words in formula_29 that can be made by exchanging the formula_12 symbols in formula_20 with symbols from formula_11. For example, if formula_33, formula_34 and formula_35 then formula_36.\n\nConversely, for any formula_37 we define formula_38, called the formula_39 of formula_40, which maps formula_40 on to a schema formula_42:\nformula_43\nwhere formula_20 is a schema of length formula_45 such that the symbol at position formula_24 in formula_20 is determined in the following way: if formula_48 for all formula_49 then formula_50 otherwise formula_51. If formula_52 then formula_53. One can think of this operator as stacking up all the items in formula_40 and if all elements in a column are equivalent, the symbol at that position in formula_20 takes this value, otherwise there is a wild card symbol. For example, let formula_56 then formula_57.\n\nSchemata can be partially ordered. For any formula_58 we say formula_59 if and only if formula_60. It follows that formula_61 is a partial ordering on a set of schemata from the reflexivity, antisymmetry and transitivity of the subset relation. For example, formula_62.\nThis is because formula_63.\n\nThe compression and expansion operators form a Galois connection, where formula_64 is the lower adjoint and formula_65 the upper adjoint.\n\nFor a set formula_37, we call the process of calculating the compression on each subset of A, that is <math>\\\n"}

Prior to and after an official retirement, Sinbad was assigned the rank of K9C or \"Chief Dog\" - equivalent to Chief Petty Officer. At the time of the biography written by George Foley, no other member of the United States Coast Guard had yet been the subject of a published biography. Sinbad spent 11 years at sea on the \"Campbell\" including combat in World War II that became widely publicized as part of the homefront campaign.\n\nSinbad's birth is not recorded, but he was obtained by Chief Boatswain's Mate A. A. \"Blackie\" Rother of the USCGC \"George W. Campbell\", who intended the dog as a gift for a girlfriend. She did not take him in due to a restriction against pets in her apartment building, leaving Rother with him as he returned from liberty in 1937. No crewman would take the dog, leaving him a stray without an owner, but most wanted him to remain on board. To justify enlistment, thereby eliminating the need for a master, the crew said that Sinbad displayed the attributes of a sailor by drinking coffee, whiskey with beer chasers at port bars, having regular and general quarters duty stations, and generally demonstrating seamanship. According to the Coast Guard and several published articles, he was enlisted into the service with his pawprint on enlistment papers. As Foley notes, Sinbad was assigned his own service and Red Cross identification numbers, service record, and bunk. He was also recorded as a member of the Society of Polar Explorers. Being prone to the indiscretions of both a canine and a sailor, Sinbad was subject to Captains Mast on two occasions, and was promoted and demoted in rank on several occasions. Sinbad ended his time at sea with the rank K9C Chief Dog and commensurate pay rate.\n\nSinbad was aboard \"Campbell\" throughout World War II while the cutter was assigned to convoy escort duty in the Atlantic. Although publicity photos depicted Sinbad standing helmeted on the barrel of a large gun, he actually stayed below decks with a general quarters duty post \"assigned to damage control\", keeping him away from the sound of gunfire.\n\n\"Campbell\"s most significant action involved combat with, and sinking by ramming of, the German submarine \"U-606\". After the cutter suffered severe damage, becoming disabled and without power due to flooding, \"essential crew\" were left aboard the otherwise evacuated ship to keep it afloat as it was towed to Canada for repair, and Sinbad travelled with them. Crew members later stated to the media that Captain James Hirschfield believed that nothing could befall the ship if Sinbad remained aboard. A statue of Sinbad is on the mess deck of current \"Famous-class\" medium endurance cutter , successor to the preceding \"Campbell\".\n\nSinbad was aboard during other anti-submarine warfare and strafing attacks by enemy aircraft.\n\nWhile less decorated than the ship on which he was present during the war, Sinbad was awarded the following service ribbons: American Defense Service Medal, American Campaign Medal, European-African-MiddleEastern Campaign Medal, Asiatic-Pacific Campaign Medal, World War II Victory Medal and Navy Occupation Service Medal, which were attached to Sinbad's collar.\n\nSinbad became a public figure through media attention first accumulated through his presence in bars in ports of call. He also frequented Red Cross facilities such as his alleged favorite in Londonderry, where he was also the guest of honor at a dinner in Guild Hall.\n\nNew York papers featured the story of the clash with \"U-606\", though without photographs as Sinbad was sequestered below after a night on the town. \"The Boston Globe\"s Martin Sheridan described him in a December 1943 \"Life\" magazine story as \"liberty-rum-chow-hound, with a bit of bulldog, doberman pinscher, and what-not. Mostly what-not\", which appealed to blue collar and farm town America.\n\nPhoto sessions and network news interviews when the \"Campbell\" was in port served the home-front morale effort and gave Sinbad nationwide recognition. His celebrity further increased following the end of the war and the publication of George F. Foley's \"Sinbad of the Coast Guard\", whose book-signing tour Sinbad accompanied.\n\nAs both a dog and sailor, Sinbad was not immune to causing trouble in port towns where the crew went on liberty, and was not always cooperative at public relations events. He was the subject of formal complaints called \"diplomatic incidents\" in Casablanca and Greenland.\n\nAfter spending 11 years with the \"Campbell\"s crew, mostly at sea, Sinbad was taken ashore at the Barnegat Light station in New Jersey, and listed as honorably discharged from the Coast Guard on 21 September 1948, and on \"inactive duty\". Once described by \"Life\" magazine as \"an old sea dog [who] has favorite bars and plenty of girls in every port\", Sinbad lived another three years quietly ashore, frequenting Kubel's bar on Seventh (the only bar) in Barnegat Light and looking out to sea from the station.\n\nSinbad was also long known for playing with a metal washer that he balanced on his nose, tossed in the air, and caught. A statue of Sinbad is on the mess deck of current \"Famous-class\" medium endurance cutter , successor to the preceding \"Campbell\". Lacking any oversized washers, or a large engine room crew Foley dubbed \"the black gang\" in reference to the soot and oil of their jobs to provide one, the statue instead balances a rawhide bone. The public affairs officer for \"Campbell\", Ensign John Jeffares, wrote in 2011 in reference to their statue deemed in part to protect the ship vis-à-vis the belief attributed to Captain Hirschfield that \"here on board we have our own special tradition. Sinbad's statue as well as his bone (as seen pictured on his nose) is considered off limits. Any personnel other than chief petty officers (Sinbad's rank while he was a crewmember onboard) who touch the statue and his bone are said to be stricken with bad luck... you just don't touch it.\"\n\nSinbad died on 30 December 1951 and was buried beneath a granite monument at the base of the light station's flagpole. The decommissioned station has since become the emergency operations center for the Borough of Barnegat Light, New Jersey.\n\n"}
{"id": "81798", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=81798", "title": "Solipsism", "text": "Solipsism\n\nSolipsism (; ) is the philosophical idea that only one's own mind is sure to exist. As an epistemological position, solipsism holds that knowledge of anything outside one's own mind is unsure; the external world and other minds cannot be known and might not exist outside the mind. As a metaphysical position, solipsism goes further to the conclusion that the world and other minds do not exist.\n\nThere are varying degrees of solipsism that parallel the varying degrees of skepticism:\n\nMetaphysical solipsism is a variety of solipsism. Based on a philosophy of subjective idealism, metaphysical solipsists maintain that the self is the only existing reality and that all other realities, including the external world and other persons, are representations of that self, and have no independent existence. There are several versions of metaphysical solipsism, such as Caspar Hare's egocentric presentism (or perspectival realism), in which other people are conscious, but their experiences are simply not \"present\".\n\nEpistemological solipsism is the variety of idealism according to which only the directly accessible mental contents of the solipsistic philosopher can be known. The existence of an external world is regarded as an unresolvable question rather than actually false. Further, one cannot also be certain as to what extent the external world exists independently of one's mind. For instance, it may be that a God-like being controls the sensations received by one's brain, making it appear as if there is an external world when most of it (excluding the God-like being and oneself) is false. However, the point remains that epistemological solipsists consider this an \"unresolvable\" question.\n\nMethodological solipsism is an agnostic variant of solipsism. It exists in opposition to the strict epistemological requirements for \"knowledge\" (\"e.g.\" the requirement that knowledge must be certain). It still entertains the points that any induction is fallible. Methodological solipsism sometimes goes even further to say that even what we perceive as the brain is actually part of the external world, for it is only through our senses that we can see or feel the mind. Only the existence of thoughts is known for certain.\n\nImportantly, methodological solipsists do not intend to conclude that the stronger forms of solipsism are actually true. They simply emphasize that justifications of an external world must be founded on indisputable facts about their own consciousness. The methodological solipsist believes that subjective impressions (empiricism) or innate knowledge (rationalism) are the sole possible or proper starting point for philosophical construction. Often methodological solipsism is not held as a belief system, but rather used as a thought experiment to assist skepticism (\"e.g.\" Descartes' cartesian skepticism).\n\nDenial of material existence, in itself, does not constitute solipsism.\n\nA feature of the metaphysical solipsistic worldview is the denial of the existence of other minds. Since personal experiences are private and ineffable, another being's experience can be known only by analogy.\n\nPhilosophers try to build knowledge on more than an inference or analogy. The failure of Descartes' epistemological enterprise brought to popularity the idea that all certain knowledge may go no further than \"\"I think; therefore I exist\"\" without providing any real details about the nature of the \"I\" that has been proven to exist.\n\nThe theory of solipsism also merits close examination because it relates to three widely held philosophical presuppositions, each itself fundamental and wide-ranging in importance:\n\n\nTo expand on point 2 a little further, the conceptual problem here is that the previous assumes mind or consciousness (which are attributes) can exist independent of some entity having this capability, i.e., that an attribute of an existent can exist apart from the existent itself. If one admits to the existence of an independent entity (e.g., your brain) having that attribute, the door is open. (See the Brain in a vat.)\n\nSome people hold that, while it cannot be proven that anything independent of one's mind exists, the point that solipsism makes is irrelevant. This is because, whether the world as we perceive it exists independently or not, we cannot escape this perception (except via death), hence it is best to act assuming that the world is independent of our minds. For example, if one committed a crime, one is likely to be punished, causing potential distress to oneself even if the world was not independent of one's mind; therefore, it is in one's best interests and is most convenient to assume the world exists independently of one's mind.\n\nThere is also the issue of plausibility to consider. If one is the only mind in existence, then one is maintaining that one's mind alone created all of which one is apparently aware. This includes the symphonies of Beethoven, the works of Shakespeare, all of mathematics and science (which one can access via one's phantom libraries), etc. Critics of solipsism find this somewhat implausible. However, since, for example, people are able to construct entire worlds inside their minds while having dreams when asleep, and people have had dreams which included things such as music of Beethoven or the works of Shakespeare or math or science in them, solipsists do have counter-arguments to justify their views being plausible.\n\nSolipsism was first recorded by the Greek presocratic sophist, Gorgias (c. 483–375 BC) who is quoted by the Roman sceptic Sextus Empiricus as having stated:\n\n\nMuch of the point of the Sophists was to show that \"objective\" knowledge was a literal impossibility. (See also comments credited to Protagoras of Abdera).\n\nThe foundations of solipsism are in turn the foundations of the view that the individual's understanding of any and all psychological concepts (thinking, willing, perceiving, etc.) is accomplished by making an analogy with his or her own mental states; \"i.e.\", by abstraction from \"inner experience\". And this view, or some variant of it, has been influential in philosophy since Descartes elevated the search for incontrovertible certainty to the status of the \"primary goal\" of epistemology, whilst also elevating epistemology to \"first philosophy\".\n\nGeorge Berkeley's arguments against materialism in favour of idealism provide the solipsist with a number of arguments not found in Descartes. While Descartes defends ontological dualism, thus accepting the existence of a material world (res extensa) as well as immaterial minds (res cogitans) and God, Berkeley denies the existence of matter but not minds, of which God is one.\n\nOne of the most fundamental debates in philosophy concerns the \"true\" nature of the world—whether it is some ethereal plane of ideas or a reality of atomic particles and energy. Materialism posits a real 'world out there,' as well as in and through us, that can be sensed—seen, heard, tasted, touched and felt, sometimes with prosthetic technologies corresponding to human sensing organs. (Materialists do not claim that human senses or even their prosthetics can, even when collected, sense the totality of the 'universe'; simply that what they collectively cannot sense cannot in any way be known to us.)\n\nMaterialists do not find this a useful way of thinking about the ontology and ontogeny of ideas, but we might say that from a materialist perspective pushed to a logical extreme communicable to an idealist (an \"Away Team\" perspective), ideas are ultimately reducible to a physically communicated, organically, socially and environmentally embedded 'brain state'. While reflexive existence is not considered by materialists to be experienced on the atomic level, the individual's physical and mental experiences are ultimately reducible to the unique tripartite combination of environmentally determined, genetically determined, and randomly determined interactions of firing neurons and atomic collisions.\n\nAs a correlative, the only thing that dreams and hallucinations prove are that some neurons can reorganize and 'clean house' 'on break' (often reforming according to emergent, prominent, or uncanny cultural themes), misfire, and malfunction. But for materialists, ideas have no primary reality as essences separate from our physical existence. From a materialist \"Home Team\" perspective, ideas are also social (rather than purely biological), and formed and transmitted and modified through the interactions between social organisms and their social and physical environments. This materialist perspective informs scientific methodology, insofar as that methodology assumes that humans have no access to omniscience and that therefore human knowledge is an ongoing, collective enterprise that is best produced via scientific and logical conventions adjusted specifically for material human capacities and limitations.\n\nModern Idealists, on the other hand, believe that the mind and its thoughts are the only true things that exist. This is the reverse of what is sometimes called classical idealism or, somewhat confusingly, Platonic idealism due to the influence of Plato's Theory of Forms (εἶδος \"eidos\" or ἰδέα \"idea\") which were not products of our thinking. The material world is ephemeral, but a perfect triangle or \"beauty\" is eternal. Religious thinking tends to be some form of idealism, as God usually becomes the highest ideal (such as Neoplatonism). On this scale, solipsism can be classed as idealism. Thoughts and concepts are all that exist, and furthermore, only the solipsist's own thoughts and consciousness exist. The so-called \"reality\" is nothing more than an idea that the solipsist has (perhaps unconsciously) created.\n\nThere is another option: the belief that both ideals and \"reality\" exist. Dualists commonly argue that the distinction between the mind (or 'ideas') and matter can be proven by employing Leibniz' principle of the \"identity of indiscernibles\" which states that if two things share exactly the same qualities, then they must be identical, as in indistinguishable from each other and therefore one and the same thing. Dualists then attempt to identify attributes of mind that are lacked by matter (such as privacy or intentionality) or vice versa (such as having a certain temperature or electrical charge). One notable application of the identity of indiscernibles was by René Descartes in his \"Meditations on First Philosophy\". Descartes concluded that he could not doubt the existence of \"himself\" (the famous \"cogito ergo sum\" argument), but that he \"could\" doubt the (separate) existence of \"his\" body. From this, he inferred that the \"person Descartes\" must not be identical to \"the Descartes body\" since one possessed a characteristic that the other did not: namely, it could be known to exist. Solipsism agrees with Descartes in this aspect, and goes further: only things that can be known to exist for sure should be considered to exist. \"The Descartes body\" could only exist as an idea in the mind of the \"person Descartes\". Descartes and dualism aim to prove the actual existence of reality as opposed to a phantom existence (as well as the existence of God in Descartes' case), using the realm of ideas merely as a starting point, but solipsism usually finds those further arguments unconvincing. The solipsist instead proposes that his/her own unconscious is the author of all seemingly \"external\" events from \"reality\".\n\n\"The World as Will and Representation\" is the central work of Arthur Schopenhauer. Schopenhauer saw the human will as our one window to the world behind the representation, the Kantian thing-in-itself. He believed, therefore, that we could gain knowledge about the thing-in-itself, something Kant said was impossible, since the rest of the relationship between representation and thing-in-itself could be understood by analogy as the relationship between human will and human body.\n\nThe idealist philosopher George Berkeley argued that physical objects do not exist independently of the mind that perceives them. An item truly exists only as long as it is observed; otherwise, it is not only meaningless but simply nonexistent. The observer and the observed are one. Berkeley does attempt to show things can and do exist apart from the human mind and our perception, but only because there is an all-encompassing Mind in which all \"ideas\" are perceived – in other words, God, who observes all. Solipsism agrees that nothing exists outside of perception, but would argue that Berkeley falls prey to the egocentric predicament – he can only make his own observations, and thus cannot be truly sure that this God or other people exist to observe \"reality\". The solipsist would say it is better to disregard the unreliable observations of alleged other people and rely upon the immediate certainty of one's own perceptions.\n\nRationalism is the philosophical position that truth is best discovered by the use of reasoning and logic rather than by the use of the senses (see Plato's theory of Forms). Solipsism is also skeptical of sense-data.\n\nThe theory of solipsism crosses over with the theory of the philosophical zombie in that all other seemingly conscious beings actually lack true consciousness, instead they only display traits of consciousness to the observer, who is the only conscious being there is.\n\nSolipsism is not a falsifiable hypothesis as described by Karl Popper or Imre Lakatos: there does not seem to be an imaginable disproof.\n\nOne critical test is nevertheless to consider the induction from experience that the externally observable world does not seem, at first approach, to be directly manipulable purely by mental energies alone. One can indirectly manipulate the world through the medium of the physical body, but it seems impossible to do so through pure thought (\"e.g.\" via psychokinesis). It might be argued that if the external world were merely a construct of a single consciousness, \"i.e.\" the self, it could then follow that the external world should be somehow directly manipulable by that consciousness, and if it is not, then solipsism is false. An argument against this states the notion that such manipulation may be possible but barred from the conscious self via the subconscious self, a 'locked' portion of the mind that is still nevertheless the same mind. Lucid dreaming might be considered an example of when these locked portions of the subconscious become accessible. An argument against this might be brought up in asking why the subconscious mind would be locked. Also, the access to the autonomous ('locked') portions of the mind during the lucid dreaming is obviously much different (for instance: is relatively more transient) than the access to autonomous regions of the perceived nature.\n\nThe method of the typical scientist is materialist: they first assume that the external world exists and can be known. But the scientific method, in the sense of a predict-observe-modify loop, does not require the assumption of an external world. A solipsist may perform a psychological test on themselves, to discern the nature of the reality in their mind - however David Deutsch uses this fact to counter-argue: \"outer parts\" of solipsist, behave independently so they are independent for \"narrowly\" defined (conscious) self. A solipsist's investigations may not be proper science, however, since it would not include the co-operative and communitarian aspects of scientific inquiry that normally serve to diminish bias.\n\nSolipsism is a form of logical minimalism. Many people are intuitively unconvinced of the nonexistence of the external world from the basic arguments of solipsism, but a solid proof of its existence is not available at present. The central assertion of solipsism rests on the nonexistence of such a proof, and strong solipsism (as opposed to weak solipsism) asserts that no such proof can be made. In this sense, solipsism is logically related to agnosticism in religion: the distinction between believing you do not know, and believing you could not have known.\n\nHowever, minimality (or parsimony) is not the only logical virtue. A common misapprehension of Occam's Razor has it that the simpler theory is always the best. In fact, the principle is that the simpler of two theories of \"equal explanatory power\" is to be preferred. In other words: additional \"entities\" can pay their way with enhanced explanatory power. So the realist can claim that, while his world view is more complex, it is more satisfying as an explanation.\n\nSome developmental psychologists believe that infants are solipsistic, and that eventually children infer that others have experiences much like theirs and reject solipsism.\n\nThe earliest reference to Solipsism in Hindu philosophy is found in the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad, dated to early 1st millennium BCE. The Upanishad holds the mind to be the only god and all actions in the universe are thought to be a result of the mind assuming infinite forms. After the development of distinct schools of Indian philosophy, Advaita Vedanta and Samkhya schools are thought to have originated concepts similar to solipsism.\n\nAdvaita is one of the six most known Hindu philosophical systems and literally means \"non-duality\". Its first great consolidator was Adi Shankaracharya, who continued the work of some of the Upanishadic teachers, and that of his teacher's teacher Gaudapada. By using various arguments, such as the analysis of the three states of experience—wakefulness, dream, and deep sleep, he established the singular reality of Brahman, in which Brahman, the universe and the Atman or the Self, were one and the same.\nThe concept of the Self in the philosophy of Advaita could be interpreted as solipsism. However, the transhuman, theological implications of the Self in Advaita protect it from true solipsism as found in the west. Similarly, the Vedantic text Yogavasistha, escapes charge of solipsism because the real \"I\" is thought to be nothing but the absolute whole looked at through a particular unique point of interest.\n\nAdvaita is also thought to strongly diverge from solipsism in that, the former is a system of exploration of one's mind in order to finally understand the nature of the self and attain complete knowledge. The unity of existence is said to be directly experienced and understood at the end as a part of complete knowledge. On the other hand, solipsism posits the non-existence of the external void right at the beginning, and says that no further inquiry is possible.\n\nSamkhya philosophy, which is sometimes seen as the basis of Yogic thought, adopts a view that matter exists independently of individual minds. Representation of an object in an individual mind is held to be a mental approximation of the object in the external world. Therefore, Samkhya chooses representational realism over epistemological solipsism. Having established this distinction between the external world and the mind, Samkhya posits the existence of two metaphysical realities Prakriti (matter) and Purusha (consciousness).\n\nSome misinterpretations of Buddhism assert that external reality is an illusion, and sometimes this position is [mis]understood as metaphysical solipsism. Buddhist philosophy, though, generally holds that the mind and external phenomena are both equally transient, and that they arise from each other. The mind cannot exist without external phenomena, nor can external phenomena exist without the mind. This relation is known as \"dependent arising\" (\"pratityasamutpada\").\n\nThe Buddha stated, \"Within this fathom long body is the world, the origin of the world, the cessation of the world and the path leading to the cessation of the world\". Whilst not rejecting the occurrence of external phenomena, the Buddha focused on the illusion created within the mind of the perceiver by the process of ascribing permanence to impermanent phenomena, satisfaction to unsatisfying experiences, and a sense of reality to things that were effectively insubstantial.\n\nMahayana Buddhism also challenges as illusion the idea that one can experience an 'objective' reality independent of individual perceiving minds.\n\nFrom the standpoint of Prasangika (a branch of Madhyamaka thought), external objects do exist, but are devoid of any type of inherent identity: \"Just as objects of mind do not exist [inherently], mind also does not exist [inherently]\". In other words, even though a chair may physically exist, individuals can only experience it through the medium of their own mind, each with their own literal point of view. Therefore, an independent, purely 'objective' reality could never be experienced.\n\nThe Yogacara (sometimes translated as \"Mind only\") school of Buddhist philosophy contends that all human experience is constructed by mind. Some later representatives of one Yogacara subschool (Prajnakaragupta, Ratnakīrti) propounded a form of idealism that has been interpreted as solipsism. A view of this sort is contained in the 11th-century treatise of Ratnakirti, \"Refutation of the existence of other minds\" (\"Santanantara dusana\"), which provides a philosophical refutation of external mind-streams from the Buddhist standpoint of ultimate truth (as distinct from the perspective of everyday reality).\n\nIn addition to this, the Bardo Thodol, Tibet's famous book of the dead, repeatedly states that all of reality is a figment of one's perception, although this occurs within the \"Bardo\" realm (post-mortem). For instance, within the sixth part of the section titled \"The Root Verses of the Six Bardos\", there appears the following line: \"May I recognize whatever appeareth as being mine own thought-forms\"; there are many lines in similar ideal.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "7692848", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7692848", "title": "Techniques of neutralization", "text": "Techniques of neutralization\n\nTechniques of neutralization are a theoretical series of methods by which those who commit illegitimate acts temporarily neutralize certain values within themselves which would normally prohibit them from carrying out such acts, such as morality, obligation to abide by the law, and so on. In simpler terms, it is a psychological method for people to turn off \"inner protests\" when they do, or are about to do something they themselves perceive as wrong.\n\nThe idea of such techniques was first postulated by David Matza (born May 1, 1930) and Gresham Sykes (born 1922) during their work on Edwin Sutherland's Differential Association in the 1950s. While Matza and Sykes were at the time working on juvenile delinquency, they theorized that the same techniques could be found throughout society and published their ideas in \"Delinquency and Drift\" 1964.\n\nMatza and Sykes' theory states that people are always aware of their moral obligation to abide by the law, and that they have the same moral obligation within themselves to avoid illegitimate acts. Thus, they reasoned, when a person did commit illegitimate acts, they must employ some sort of mechanism to silence the urge to follow these moral obligations.\n\nThis theory rejects other theories which suggested that groups containing delinquents have set up their own permanent moral code which completely replaces moral obligations. Thus, Matza and Sykes were able to explain how offenders 'drift' from illegitimate to legitimate lifestyles repeatedly, as they retain the moral code rather than wipe it clean to be replaced by a more illegitimate one as previous theories suggested.\n\nThe theory was built up upon four observations:\n\n\nThese theories were brought from positivistic criminology which looked at epistemological perspectives of delinquency.\n\nFrom these, Matza and Sykes created the following methods by which, they believed, delinquents justified their illegitimate actions:\n\n\nThere are five methods of neutralization generally manifest themselves in the form of arguments, such as:\n\n\nIn 2017, Bryant et al. analysed statements made by 27 individuals accused of participation in the Rwanda genocide and found two neutralization techniques that had not been identified before:\n\nFurther research in the theory has produced inconclusive results. Offenders have been found both with a solid belief in their moral obligations, and without. Travis Hirschi, a social bond theorist, also raised the question as to whether the offender develops these techniques to neutralise their qualms regarding offending \"before\" or \"after\" they actually commit the offence.\n\nNeutralization Theory was introduced by Sykes and Matza in 1957, facing the then prevailing criminological wisdom that offenders engage in crime because they adhere to an oppositional subcultural rule set that values law breaking and violence, they rejected this perspective. Subsequent research revealed that the original formulation of the Sykes and Matza's theory explains only the behavior of \"conventionally attached individuals\" not those of \"nonconventionally oriented individuals\" such as \"criminally embedded street offenders\". Professor Volkan Topalli, at Georgia State University, in his article \"The Seductive Nature of Autotelic Crime: How Neutralization Theory Serves as a Boundary Condition for Understanding Hardcore Street Offending\", explains that for those groups \"guilt is not an issue at all because their crimes are not only considered acceptable, but attractive and desirable\".\n\n"}
{"id": "74007", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=74007", "title": "Technology assessment", "text": "Technology assessment\n\nTechnology assessment (TA, German: , French: ) is a scientific, interactive, and communicative process that aims to contribute to the formation of public and political opinion on societal aspects of science and technology.\n\nTA is the study and evaluation of new technologies. It is based on the conviction that new developments within, and discoveries by, the scientific community are relevant for the world at large rather than just for the scientific experts themselves, and that technological progress can never be free of ethical implications. Also, technology assessment recognizes the fact that scientists normally are not trained ethicists themselves and accordingly ought to be very careful when passing ethical judgement on their own, or their colleagues, new findings, projects, or work in progress.\n\nTechnology assessment assumes a global perspective and is future-oriented, not anti-technological. TA considers its task as an interdisciplinary approach to solving already existing problems and preventing potential damage caused by the uncritical application and the commercialization of new technologies.\n\nTherefore, any results of technology assessment studies must be published, and particular consideration must be given to communication with political decision-makers.\n\nAn important problem concerning technology assessment is the so-called Collingridge dilemma: on the one hand, impacts of new technologies cannot be easily predicted until the technology is extensively developed and widely used; on the other hand, control or change of a technology is difficult as soon as it is widely used.\n\nTechnology assessments, which are a form of cost–benefit analysis, are difficult if not impossible to carry out in an objective manner since subjective decisions and value judgments have to be made regarding a number of complex issues such as (a) the boundaries of the analysis (i.e., what costs are internalized and externalized), (b) the selection of appropriate indicators of potential positive and negative consequences of the new technology, (c) the monetization of non-market values, and (d) a wide range of ethical perspectives. Consequently, most technology assessments are neither objective nor value-neutral exercises but instead are greatly influenced and biased by the values of the most powerful stakeholders, which are in many cases the developers and proponents (i.e., corporations and governments) of new technologies under consideration. In the most extreme view, as expressed by Ian Barbour in '’Technology, Environment, and Human Values'’, technology assessment is \"a one-sided apology for contemporary technology by people with a stake in its continuation.\"\n\nSome of the major fields of TA are: information technology, hydrogen technologies, nuclear technology, molecular nanotechnology, pharmacology, organ transplants, gene technology, artificial intelligence, the Internet and many more. Health technology assessment is related, but profoundly different, despite the similarity in the name.\n\nThe following types of concepts of TA are those that are most visible and practiced. There are, however, a number of further TA forms that are only proposed as concepts in the literature or are the label used by a particular TA institution.\n\nMany TA institutions are members of the European Parliamentary Technology Assessment (EPTA) network, some are working for the STOA panel of the European Parliament and formed the European Technology Assessment Group (ETAG).\n\n\n"}

Corey Rieger, Andrew Simpson, David Pesta, and Orson Ossman star as scientists who attempt to reanimate the dead.\n\nPerry Frank assembles a team of four young scientists to take part in an experiment to reanimate the dead. The group consists of himself, his friend and protege Carter Watts, biologist Devin Fischer, and engineer Ampersand \"Amps\" Garner. Although Devin and Amps are privately dubious about Carter's usefulness, the team members express their optimism and excitement for the project in taped interviews that Perry arranges. Perry explains that their funding only allows for five subjects, so they must proceed slowly and carefully. As they set up the equipment, Amps and Carter bond. Devin confides to Perry that his father, a scientist, experienced his greatest regret in having his work finished by later teams, and Devin says he wants to push this experiment all the way.\n\nTheir first subject is an insect. When the experiment fails, Devin suggests that since the experiment was designed around mammals, they should abandon tests on insects. Perry reluctantly agrees, and Amps recalibrates the equipment for a mouse. Carter, initially supportive of the idea, becomes reluctant when it comes time to kill the mouse, which the others refused to let him name. The experiment is once again a failure. Carter and Devin give up for the day, but Amps convinces Perry to set up a second test on the same subject. Amps becomes demoralized when this also results in failure. When Carter walks through the lab that night, he notices the mouse's body has moved. He excitedly wakes the others, and they celebrate. Carter later approaches Perry privately and cautiously suggests that one of the team members may have moved the mouse to raise morale. Perry reassures him that he has the situation under control.\n\nFurther tests prove failures. Frustrated, Devin requests Carter contact the grant organization and request money for more tests. Carter is incensed when he finds that Perry has lied to them; there is no grant, and Perry is bankrolling the experiment privately. Carter quits the project, citing legal and moral implications, though Devin elects to stay. Perry and Devin do not explain the situation to Amps. Devin pushes for a larger mammal, which he says will be easier to test, and Perry allows the use of a rabbit, though he cautions Devin that to maintain public acceptance they must avoid animal testing on anything larger. Devin and Perry become further estranged when Perry learns Devin has joined to project for personal reasons – his sister is near death, and Devin intends to reanimate her. Perry angrily reminds Devin that human experimentation is not possible.\n\nAfter promising results, Amps' updated calculations reveal that the second subject, the mouse, could not have moved. Perry admits that he moved the mouse himself, and Amps says that he needs time away from the project. Devin pushes Perry to perform another test without Amps, and they experience their first unqualified success. Although initially angry they would operate his machine without permission, Amps also becomes excited. Perry contacts Carter, apologizes for lying about the grant, and requests that he rejoin them. Carter returns once he hears about their success. Meanwhile, Devin convinces Amps to secretly test on a human subject. When Perry finds out, he threatens to call the police. Seeing no alternative, Devin commits suicide to force them to test the machine on him. The result is initially a success, but the others are quickly horrified to learn that Devin's memory and personality have been wiped; he does not even understand how to speak. Perry orders them to destroy the equipment, and they leave the lab with Devin in tow. As they put him in a car, Devin stares wide-eyed at the world around him.\n\n\nThe $60,000 budget was raised partially through crowdfunding on Kickstarter.\n\n\"The Phoenix Project\" premiered on video on demand and had a limited theatrical release on January 16, 2015.\n\nFrank Scheck of \"The Hollywood Reporter\" wrote that \"while it earns points for its thoughtful, non-exploitative approach to its subject, [it] is neither brainy enough to attract sci-fi aficionados nor fast-paced enough to please horror fans\". \"Film Journal International\" wrote, \"This melancholy take on the Frankenstein story should play well with horror buffs who prefer character conflict to rampaging creatures and gore, but its low-key virtues make break-out appeal unlikely.\" Michael Rechtshaffen of the \"Los Angeles Times\" called it \"a technically impressive but talky sci-fi drama that never quite comes to life\". Joe Friar of the \"Victoria Advocate\" wrote, \"The lack of tension proves to be the movie's weakness and at times it feels like the little brother to the excellent 2004 film \"Primer\"\".\n\n"}

He now works at the synthetic biology company Ginkgo Bioworks, which he cofounded in 2008.\n\nTom Knight arrived at MIT when he was fourteen. Even though he only started his undergraduate studies at the regular age of 18, he took classes in computer programming and organic chemistry during high school because he lived close to that university. He built early hardware such as ARPANET interfaces for host #6 on the network, some of the first bitmapped displays, the ITS time sharing system, Lisp machines (he was also instrumental in releasing a version of the operating system for the Lisp machine under a BSD license), the Connection Machine, and parallel symbolic processing computer systems.\n\nIn 1967 Knight wrote the original kernel for the ITS operating system, as well as the combination of command processor and debugger that was used as its top-level user interface. ITS was the dominant operating system for first Project MAC and later the MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory and MIT Laboratory for Computer Science. ITS ran on PDP-6 and, later, PDP-10 computers.\n\nIn 1968, Knight designed and supervised the construction of the first PDP-10 ARPANET interfaces with Bob Metcalfe.\n\nIn 1972, Knight designed one of the first semiconductor memory-based bitmap displays. This was later commercialized and led directly to the development of the Bedford Computer Systems newspaper layout system and influenced many of the bitmapped display devices available today. That same year, along with Jeff Rubin, Knight designed and implemented a network file system that provided the first transparent remote file access over the ARPANET.\n\nIn 1974, Knight designed and implemented the prototype version of the MIT Lisp Machine processor, with the production version following in 1976. The Lisp Machine was a microprogrammed machine, tuned for high-performance emulation of other instruction sets. The design of the Lisp Machine was directly implemented by both Symbolics and LMI and was the basis of all of their computers. Texas Instruments implemented surface mount and single-chip versions of the architecture in 1983 and 1987, respectively.\n\nKnight collaborated with Jack Holloway in designing and implementing the Chaosnet, a re-engineered version of the Xerox 3 Mbit/s Ethernet. In 1975 this network became the first local area network on MIT's campus. Chaosnet's innovation of a preamble bit string for packets was eventually incorporated into the 10 Mbit/s Ethernet standard.\n\nIn 1980, Knight participated in the development of the Connection Machine architecture and its original implementation. Other notable and diverse accomplishments during the 1980s included the creation of the first silicon retina in 1981, the creation of a single-chip optical mouse, the design of the Cross-Omega interconnection network architecture, and the design of the Transit multiprocessor interconnection architecture.\n\nDuring the early 1990s, Knight was involved in the formation of Permabit and of Exa Corporation and the architecture of the latter's initial version of its FX/1 lattice gas parallel fluid flow computer. Advances included using over-relaxation techniques to make 10x algorithmic improvements in lattice gas computations, landmark CFD accuracies, and correction of misconceptions about the origin of fluid turbulence in simple two-dimensional flow situations. Within the Laboratory for Computer Science, he led the Abacus SIMD project, worked on VLSI microdisplays, and made advances in the field of adiabatic (reversible) computing.\n\nIt was also during this period that Knight's interests in biological systems began. Inspired in part by the work of Harold J. Morowitz, a Yale physicist and biologist, Knight studied biochemistry, genetics, and cellular biology, and set up a biology lab within the MIT AI Laboratory. In this lab he created the concept of the BioBrick plasmid DNA part and began creating a library of BioBricks that could be used to simplify the genetic engineering of Escherichia coli cells. Today, BioBricks form the basis of the enormous annual iGEM (International Genetically Engineered Machine) competition and Knight is sometimes referred to as the godfather of synthetic biology. Knight co-founded Ginkgo Bioworks, a synthetic biology company.\n\n"}
{"id": "289463", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=289463", "title": "Woody Hayes", "text": "Woody Hayes\n\nWayne Woodrow \"Woody\" Hayes (February 14, 1913 – March 12, 1987) was an American football player and coach. He served as the head coach at Denison University (1946–1948), Miami University in Oxford, Ohio (1949–1950), and Ohio State University (1951–1978), compiling a career college football record of 238 wins, 72 losses, and 10 ties.\n\nDuring his 28 seasons as the head coach of the Ohio State Buckeyes football program, Hayes' teams won five national championships (1954, 1957, 1961, 1968, 1970), captured 13 Big Ten Conference titles, and amassed a record of 205–61–10. Over the last decade of his coaching tenure at Ohio State, Hayes's Buckeye squads faced off in a fierce rivalry against the Michigan Wolverines coached by Bo Schembechler, a former player under and assistant coach to Hayes. During that stretch in the Michigan–Ohio State football rivalry, dubbed \"The Ten Year War\", Hayes and Schembechler's teams won or shared the Big Ten Conference crown every season and usually each placed in the national rankings.\n\nDespite his great achievements at Ohio State, Hayes's coaching career ended ignominiously when he was dismissed from his position as head coach after punching Clemson nose guard Charlie Bauman for intercepting an Ohio State pass with two minutes left on the clock in the 1978 Gator Bowl. He was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame as a coach in 1983.\n\nA native of Clifton, Ohio, Hayes was the youngest of three children born to Wayne B. and Effie (née Hupp) Hayes. He played center at Newcomerstown High School in Newcomerstown, Ohio. At Denison University, he played tackle under coach Tom Rogers, and was a member of Sigma Chi fraternity. After graduating from Denison in 1935, Hayes went on to serve as an assistant at two Ohio high schools: Mingo Junction in 1935–1936 and New Philadelphia in 1937. When New Philadelphia head coach John Brickels left to accept another position, Hayes was elevated to the head coaching position, where he put together a 17–2–1 record in his first two seasons before enduring a 1–9 record in 1940.\n\nHayes enlisted in the United States Navy in July 1941, eventually rising to the rank of Lieutenant Commander during World War II. He commanded \"PC 1251\" in the Palau Islands invasion and the destroyer-escort USS \"Rinehart\" in both the Atlantic and Pacific operations.\n\nAs World War II was near its end, and Hayes' alma mater, Denison University, was pursuing plans to reinstate its football program (which had been suspended during the war), it contacted former head coach Rogers (also in the Navy) about rejoining the program as head coach. Rogers declined, but recommended that his former team captain, Hayes, should be named the next head coach. Denison was able to locate and give Hayes an offer, which he accepted, minutes before his Navy ship was to begin the voyage through the Panama Canal — meaning Hayes would have been incommunicado for an extended period of time.\n\nUpon returning to Denison in 1946, Hayes had a hard first year, winning only 2 games, over Capital and the season finale against Wittenberg. However, that victory sparked a 19-game winning streak, a surge that propelled him into the head coaching position at Miami University. Miami is recognized as the \"Cradle of Coaches\" because of its history of outstanding coaches starting their careers there, such as Paul Brown, Ara Parseghian, Weeb Ewbank, Bill Mallory, Sid Gillman, Randy Walker, and Bo Schembechler. Gillman was Hayes' immediate predecessor at Miami before Gillman moved down the road to coach at the University of Cincinnati, which was then Miami's chief rival. Hayes and Gillman maintained a sparkling feud between themselves, combining mutual distaste for the other's coaching style, and because they were in recruiting competition in the same general area.\n\nIn his second year with the Miami Redskins, Hayes led the 1950 team to an appearance in the Salad Bowl, where they defeated Arizona State. That success led him to accept the Ohio State head coaching position on February 18, 1951, in a controversial decision after the university rejected the applications of other more well-known coaches, including former Buckeyes' head coach Paul Brown, incumbent Buckeye assistant Harry Strobel, and Missouri head coach Don Faurot.\n\nAs head coach of the Ohio State Buckeyes, Hayes led his teams to a 205–61–10 record (.761), including three consensus national championships (1954,1957 and 1968), two other non-consensus national titles (1961 and 1970), 13 Big Ten conference championships, and eight Rose Bowl appearances. Hayes was a three-time winner of The College Football Coach of the Year Award, now known as the Paul \"Bear\" Bryant Award, and was \"the subject of more varied and colorful anecdotal material than any other coach past or present, including fabled Knute Rockne\", according to biographer Jerry Brondfield.\n\nHayes' basic coaching philosophy was that \"nobody could win football games unless they regarded the game positively and would agree to pay the price that success demands of a team.\" His conservative style of football (especially on offense) was often described as \"three yards and a cloud of dust\"—in other words, a \"crunching, frontal assault of muscle against muscle, bone upon bone, will against will.\" The basic, bread-and-butter play in Hayes' playbook was a fullback off-guard run or a tailback off tackle play. Hayes was often quoted as saying \"only three things can happen when you pass (a completion, an incompletion, and an interception) and two of them are bad.\"\n\nIn spite of this apparent willingness to avoid change, Hayes became one of the first major college head coaches to recruit African-American players, including Jim Parker, who played both offensive and defensive tackle on Hayes' first national championship team in 1954. While Hayes was not the first to recruit African-Americans to Ohio State, he was the first to recruit and start African-Americans in large numbers there and to hire African-American assistant coaches.\n\nAnother Hayes' recruit, Archie Griffin, was the only two-time Heisman Trophy winner in seven decades of selections. Altogether, Hayes had 58 players earn All-America honors under his tutelage. Many notable football coaches, such as Lou Holtz, Bill Arnsparger, Bill Mallory, Dick Crum, Bo Schembechler, Ara Parseghian and Woody's successor, Earle Bruce, served as his assistants at various times.\n\nHayes would often use illustrations from historical events to make a point in his coaching and teaching. When Hayes was first hired to be the head coach at Ohio State, he was also made a \"full professor of physical education\", having earned an M.A. degree in educational administration from Ohio State in 1948. The classes that he taught on campus were usually full, and he was called \"Professor Hayes\" by students. Hayes also taught mandatory English and vocabulary classes to his freshman football players. One of his students was a basketball player named Bobby Knight, who was to become a legendary basketball coach.\n\nDuring his time at Ohio State, Hayes' relationships with students faculty members were particularly good. Even those members of the faculty who believed that the role of intercollegiate athletics was growing out of control respected Hayes personally for his commitment to academics, the standards of integrity with which he ran his program, and the genuine enthusiasm he brought to his hobby as an amateur historian. Hayes often ate lunch or dinner at the university's faculty club, interacting with faculty and administrators.\n\nAs a coach and an educator, Hayes was one of the first to use the motion picture as a teaching and learning tool. He was also memorable in that he could be seen walking across campus, taking the time to visit with students. When talking to young people, Hayes treated all with respect, without regard to race or socio-economic class. This behavior by Hayes was helpful to Ohio State to quell the violence and damage from anti-war demonstrations that other college campuses suffered in the late 1960s and early 1970s. He would actually take the time to communicate with student leaders. Then-team quarterback Rex Kern said, \"Woody was out there on the Oval with the protesters, and he'd grab a bullhorn and tell the students to express their beliefs but not be destructive. He believed in Nixon, and he believed in the Establishment, but he wasn't afraid to talk to the students. He wanted to stay close to the action.\" Hayes was considered one of the few authority figures that students then had respect for. His enthusiasm for coaching and winning was such that many across the nation consider the following maxim to be true: \"What Vince Lombardi was to professional football, Woody Hayes was to college football.\"\n\nDuring his tenure at Ohio State, Hayes would joke that he considered himself to be Notre Dame's best recruiter because if he could not convince a recruit to come to Ohio State instead of Michigan he would try to steer the recruit to Notre Dame, whom Ohio State did not play. While Hayes' public stance was that he refused to play Notre Dame because he was afraid of polarizing the Catholic population in Ohio, Notre Dame's long-time athletic director Edward \"Moose\" Krause said that Hayes had told him that Hayes liked having Michigan as the only tough game on the Ohio State schedule and that having the Buckeyes play Notre Dame would detract from that. Despite Hayes' apparent fear of playing more than one \"tough\" game a year, Ohio State still managed to schedule regular-season games with Nebraska, Washington, Southern California, UCLA, and Oklahoma during his tenure.\n\nAfter losses or ties, Hayes would conduct locker room interviews while naked. A journalist from his tenure noted, \"He was an ugly guy so it would clear the locker room out pretty fast.\"\n\nIn 1959, following a 17−0 loss to USC, Hayes threw a punch at \"Los Angeles Examiner\" sportswriter Al Bine, but missed, and punched the brother of \"Pasadena Independent\" sports editor Bob Shafer in the back instead. In a May 1965 meeting of Big Ten Conference athletic directors and coaches, Hayes nearly started a fight with Iowa's athletic director, Forest Evashevski, before being restrained.\n\nIn 1968, Hayes team won a game against rival Michigan, 50–14. Late in that game, Ohio State held a commanding 44–14 advantage and scored one final touchdown. Rather than taking the more common extra point kick, Hayes instead opted for a two-point conversion, but was unsuccessful, leading many football fans to believe that Hayes was running up the score. When asked later why he went for two points, Hayes said, \"Because they wouldn’t let me go for three.”\n\nPrior to the 1973 Rose Bowl, Hayes shoved a camera into the face of a news photographer. As a result, Hayes was suspended for three games, fined $2,000, and left California with a subpoena.\n\nIn 1977, a late fumble at Michigan caused him to charge at ABC cameraman Mike Freedman, who recorded his frustration; Hayes was ejected, put on probation by the Big Ten Conference, and fined $2,000.\n\nIn the 1961 season, Ohio State won the Big Ten championship, qualifying automatically for the Rose Bowl. At the time, the Big Ten Conference rules stated that the school's Faculty Council must officially approve of the trip. In this unusual development, the Ohio State Faculty Council voted 28 to 25 against the 1962 Rose Bowl trip, prompted by the head of a university alumni group, on the grounds that the school's academic reputation was suffering because of over-emphasis on the football team. Other reports stated that the bid was declined because Ohio State had already beaten their would-be Rose Bowl opponent, UCLA, during the regular season. The decision sparked minor rioting on the Ohio State Campus and in the Columbus area. The \"Columbus Dispatch\" published the names, addresses, and phone numbers of those Faculty Council Members who voted against the trip as well as the amount of university money that they spent on the trips. While Hayes was diplomatic with some faculty members who voted against the trip and urged the students to cease complaining, he did not spare his criticism of the alumni club president who led the charge against accepting the bowl bid.\n\nSpeaking at a football banquet in 1969, Hayes spoke about the recently revealed My Lai Massacre. He stated that the Vietnamese men in My Lai deserved to die, \"and I wouldn't be so sure those women were innocent. The children are obviously innocent – if they are less than five.\"\n\nLate in the 1971 rivalry game against Michigan in Ann Arbor, furious over what he thought was a missed defensive pass interference foul committed by Thom Darden of Michigan, Hayes stormed onto the field, launched a profanity-laced tirade at referee Jerry Markbreit, and tore up the sideline markers, receiving a 15-yard unsportsmanlike conduct penalty. Hayes then threw the penalty flag into the crowd, began destroying the yard markers, and threw the first-down marker into the ground like a javelin before being restrained by Buckeyes team officials; Hayes was then assessed an additional 15-yard penalty and ejected. Hayes was suspended for one game and fined $1,000.\n\nOn December 29, 1978, the Buckeyes played in the Gator Bowl against Clemson. Late in the fourth quarter, Clemson was leading Ohio State 17–15. Freshman quarterback Art Schlichter managed to get Ohio State into field goal range. On third and 5 at the Clemson 24-yard line with 2:30 left and the clock running, Hayes called a pass rather than a run, because Schlichter was having a great game up to that point. Schlichter's next pass was intercepted by Clemson nose guard Charlie Bauman, who returned it toward the Ohio State sideline, where he was run out of bounds. After Bauman got back up, Hayes punched him in the throat, triggering a bench-clearing brawl. Hayes stormed onto the field and was abusive towards the referee. When one of Hayes' own players, offensive lineman, Ken Fritz, tried to intervene, Hayes turned on him and had to be restrained by defensive coordinator George Hill. The Buckeyes were assessed two 15-yard unsportsmanlike conduct penalties for Hayes' attack on Bauman and his abuse towards the referee. Bauman was not injured by Hayes' punch and shrugged the incident off. Even though the game was being telecast by ABC, announcers Keith Jackson and Ara Parseghian did not comment about the punch. (At the time, all non-press box cameras were operated remotely from another site, and Jackson allegedly did not actually witness the punch, his view of the sidelines being blocked by the upper tier of the stadium).\n\nAfter the game, Ohio State Athletic Director Hugh Hindman, who had played for Hayes at Miami of Ohio, and had been an assistant under him for seven years, privately confronted Hayes in the Buckeye locker room. He said that he intended to tell school president Harold Enarson about what happened, and strongly implied that Hayes had coached his last game at Ohio State. After a heated exchange, Hindman said that he then offered Hayes a chance to resign, but Hayes refused, saying, \"That would make it too easy for you. You had better go ahead and fire me.\" Hindman then met with Enarson at a country club near Jacksonville, and the two agreed that Hayes had to go.\n\nThe next morning, Hindman told Hayes that he had been fired. A press conference was held at the hotel where the team had been staying. The team returned to Columbus around noon, and Hayes left the airport in a police car. Regarding Hayes' dismissal, Enarson said that \"there isn't a university or athletic conference in this country that would permit a coach to physically assault a college athlete.\" After the incident, Hayes reflected on his career by saying, \"Nobody despises to lose more than I do. That's got me into trouble over the years, but it also made a man of mediocre ability into a pretty good coach.\" About two months after the incident, Hayes called Bauman in his dorm room, but did not apologize for his previous attack on him. Earle Bruce succeeded Hayes as Ohio State's head coach.\n\nMany years later, Leonard Downie, Jr., former executive editor of \"The Washington Post\" and student journalist at Ohio State, said he regretted not reporting an incident in the 1960s where Hayes instructed a player to take off his helmet and then hit him in the head.\n\nAccording to the 1994 HBO documentary \"American Coaches: Men of Vision and Victory\", Hindman had placed Hayes on notice at the beginning of the 1978 season, not just for the swing at the ABC cameraman during the 1977 Michigan game, but also for hitting a player during a practice. In his 1989 autobiography, Michigan's Bo Schembechler wrote that he believed Hayes, who was diabetic and may have had a high blood sugar level, didn’t believe he struck Bauman. Schembechler also pointed out that Hayes had maintained that all he was trying to do was grab the ball away.\n\nBefore and after the dismissal incident, Hayes was a professor of Military History at Ohio State. His office was in the ROTC building, Converse Hall, across the street from Ohio Stadium. For the remainder of his years at OSU, he continued to teach and mentor students.\n\nOn March 11, 1987, Hayes was clearly in failing health when he had someone drive him in his pickup truck to Dayton to introduce Bo Schembechler, who was speaking at a banquet. Organizers had tried to discourage Hayes from attending, but Hayes insisted. He gave a lengthy introduction to Schembechler and then stayed to hear him speak before being driven back home.\n\nThe next morning, March 12, Hayes's wife Anne found him unconscious in his bed at the couple's home. He died of a heart attack at age 74. He is interred at Union Cemetery in Columbus, Ohio.\n\nHayes's lifetime record of 238–72–10 placed him ninth in all-time NCAA Division I FBS coaching victories. He was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1983.\n\nAt Hayes's funeral at First Community Church in Grandview, Ohio on March 17, 1987, former president Richard Nixon delivered the eulogy before a crowd of 1,400, acknowledging the friendship that had begun between the two during his second term as vice president. Having met Hayes at a reception following a Buckeye win over Iowa in 1957, Nixon recalled, \"I wanted to talk about football. Woody wanted to talk about foreign policy. And you know Woody—we talked about foreign policy.\" The following day, more than 15,000 people took part in a memorial service at Ohio Stadium.\n\nHayes's commitment to academics at Ohio State was evidenced by his request that donations from his family, friends, and supporters be made to the academic side of the university. Following his death and in keeping with his wishes, the Wayne Woodrow Hayes Chair in National Security Studies was established at Ohio State's Mershon Center for International Security Studies. Professor John Mueller currently holds the chair. In November 1987, the university dedicated the new Woody Hayes Athletic Center in his memory.\n\nHayes married the former Anne Gross in 1942. Anne Hayes was a formidable and popular woman in her own right, who used to jokingly say at numerous sports banquets, \"Divorce Woody? Never! But there were plenty of times I wanted to murder him!\" The couple had one son, Steven, who went on to become a lawyer and judge. Coincidentally, the younger Hayes would be assigned to the 2003 trial of former Ohio State standout Maurice Clarett.\n\nBecause of his knowledge of military history and ongoing popularity, Hayes in the early 1980s hosted the broadcast of six World War II films for WBNS-TV in Columbus, which has served as the official outlet of Ohio State sports media programming for years, including the football coach's shows. Among the movies broadcast were \"Patton\", \"Midway\", \"The Wackiest Ship in the Army\", \"\", and \"Tora! Tora! Tora!\"\n\nHayes would also give salty historical perspectives related to each movie. Hayes' segments, depending upon the movie, were taped in such locations as Fort Knox, West Point, the , and Stuttgart, Germany, where he interviewed Manfred Rommel, Lord Mayor of Stuttgart and the son of Erwin Rommel.\n\nFormer assistants who became NCAA Division I FBS or NFL head coaches:\n\nFormer players who became assistants who became NCAA Division I FBS or NFL head coaches:\n\n\n"}
{"id": "100542", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=100542", "title": "Ātman (Hinduism)", "text": "Ātman (Hinduism)\n\nĀtman () is a Sanskrit word that means inner self or soul. In Hindu philosophy, especially in the Vedanta school of Hinduism, Ātman is the first principle, the \"true\" self of an individual beyond identification with phenomena, the essence of an individual. In order to attain liberation (moksha), a human being must acquire self-knowledge (atma jnana), which is to realize that one's true self (Ātman) is identical with the transcendent self Brahman.\n\nThe six orthodox schools of Hinduism believe that there is Ātman (soul, self) in every being. This is a major point of difference with the Buddhist doctrine of Anatta which holds that there is no unchanging soul or self.\n\n\"Ātman\" (Atma, आत्मा, आत्मन्) is a Sanskrit word which means \"essence, breath, soul.\" It is related to the PIE *etmen (a root meaning \"breath\"; cognates: Dutch \"adem\", Old High German \"atum\" \"breath,\" Modern German \"atmen\" \"to breathe\" and \"Atem\" \"respiration, breath\", Old English \"eþian\").\n\nĀtman, sometimes spelled without a diacritic as \"atman\" in scholarly literature, means \"real self\" of the individual, \"innermost essence\", and soul. Atman, in Hinduism, is considered as eternal, imperishable, beyond time, \"not the same as body or mind or consciousness, but is something beyond which permeates all these\". Atman is a metaphysical and spiritual concept for the Hindus, often discussed in their scriptures with the concept of Brahman.\n\nThe earliest use of word \"Ātman\" in Indian texts is found in the Rig Veda (RV X.97.11). Yāska, the ancient Indian grammarian, commenting on this Rigvedic verse, accepts the following meanings of Ātman: the pervading principle, the organism in which other elements are united and the ultimate sentient principle.\n\nOther hymns of Rig Veda where the word Ātman appears include I.115.1, VII.87.2, VII.101.6, VIII.3.24, IX.2.10, IX.6.8, and X.168.4.\n\nĀtman is a central idea in all of the Upanishads, and \"know your Ātman\" is their thematic focus. These texts state that the core of every person's self is not the body, nor the mind, nor the ego, but \"Ātman\", which means \"soul\" or \"self\". Atman is the spiritual essence in all creatures, their real innermost essential being. It is eternal, it is the essence, it is ageless. Atman is that which one is at the deepest level of one's existence.\n\nThe \"Brihadaranyaka Upanishad\" describes Atman as that in which everything exists, which is of the highest value, which permeates everything, which is the essence of all, bliss and beyond description. In hymn 4.4.5, Brihadaranyaka Upanishad describes Atman as Brahman (universal absolute; supreme soul), and associates it with everything one is, everything one can be, one's free will, one's desire, what one does, what one doesn't do, the good in oneself, the bad in oneself.\nThis theme of Ātman, that is soul and self of oneself, every person, every being is the same as Brahman, is extensively repeated in Brihadāranyaka Upanishad. The Upanishad asserts that this knowledge of \"I am Brahman\", and that there is no difference between \"I\" and \"you\", or \"I\" and \"him\" is a source of liberation, and not even gods can prevail over such a liberated man. For example, in hymn 1.4.10,\n\nAlong with the \"Brihadāranyaka\", all the earliest and middle Upanishads discuss Ātman as they build their theories to answer how man can achieve liberation, freedom and bliss. The \"Katha Upanishad\", for example, explains Atman as immanent and transcendent innermost essence of each human being and living creature, that this is one, even though the external forms of living creatures manifest in different forms, for example, in hymns 2.2.9 and others, its states\n\nKatha Upanishad, in Book 1, hymns 3.3 to 3.4, describes the widely cited analogy of chariot for the relation of \"Soul, Self\" to body, mind and senses. Stephen Kaplan translates these hymns as, \"Know the Self as the rider in a chariot, and the body as simply the chariot. Know the intellect as the charioteer, and the mind as the reins. The senses, they say are the horses, and sense objects are the paths around them\". The Katha Upanishad then declares that \"when the Self [Ātman] understands this and is unified, integrated with body, senses and mind, is virtuous, mindful and pure, he reaches bliss, freedom and liberation\".\n\nThe \"Chandogya Upanishad\" explains Ātman as that which appears to be separate between two living beings but isn't, that essence and innermost, true, radiant self of all individuals which connects and unifies all. In hymn 4.10.1 through 4.10.3, for example, it explains it with example of rivers, some of which flow to the east and some to the west, but ultimately all merge into the ocean and become one. In the same way, the individual souls are pure being, states the \"Chandogya Upanishad\"; an individual soul is pure truth, and an individual soul is a manifestation of the ocean of one universal soul.\n\nĀtman is a key topic of the Upanishads, but they express two distinct, somewhat divergent themes. Some teach that Brahman (highest reality; universal principle; being-consciousness-bliss) is identical with Ātman, while others teach that Ātman is part of Brahman but not identical to it. This ancient debate flowered into various dual and non-dual theories in Hinduism. The Brahmasutra by Badarayana (~100 BCE) synthesized and unified these somewhat conflicting theories, stating that Atman and Brahman are different in some respects, particularly during the state of ignorance, but at the deepest level and in the state of self-realization, Atman and Brahman are identical, non-different (advaita). This synthesis overcame the dualistic tradition of Samkhya-Yoga schools and realism-driven traditions of Nyaya-Vaiseshika schools, enabling it to become the foundation of Vedanta as Hinduism's enduring spiritual tradition.\n\nAll major orthodox schools of Hinduism –Nyaya, Vaisesika, Samkhya, Yoga, Mimamsa, and Vedanta– accept the foundational premise of the Vedas and Upanishads that \"Ātman exists\". Jainism too accepts this premise, though it has its own idea of what that means. In contrast, both Buddhism and the Charvakas deny that there is anything called \"Ātman/soul/self\".\n\nKnowing Ātman, also referred to as self-knowledge, is one of the defining themes of all major orthodox schools of Hinduism, but they diverge on how. In Hinduism, self-knowledge is the knowledge and understanding of Atman, what it is, and what it is not. Hinduism considers Atman as distinct from the ever-evolving individual personality characterized with \"Ahamkara\" (ego, non-spiritual psychological I-ness Me-ness), habits, prejudices, desires, impulses, delusions, fads, behaviors, pleasures, sufferings and fears. Human personality and \"Ahamkara\" shift, evolve or change with time, state the schools of Hinduism; while, Atman doesn't. Atman, state these schools, is the unchanging, eternal, innermost radiant self that is unaffected by personality, unaffected by ego of oneself, unaffected by ego of others; Atman is that which is ever-free, never-bound, one that seeks, realizes and is the realized purpose, meaning, liberation in life. Puchalski states, \"the ultimate goal of Hindu religious life is to transcend individually, to realize one's own true nature\", the inner essence of oneself, which is divine and pure.\n\nPhilosophical schools such as Advaita (non-dualism) see the \"spirit/soul/self\" within each living entity as being fully identical with Brahman– the universal soul. The Advaita school believes that there is one soul that connects and exists in all living beings, regardless of their shapes or forms, and there is no distinction, no superior, no inferior, no separate devotee soul (Atman), no separate god soul (Brahman). The oneness unifies all beings, there is divine in every being, and that all existence is a single reality, state the Advaita Vedanta Hindus. In contrast, devotional sub-schools of Vedanta such as Dvaita (dualism) differentiate between the individual Atma in living beings, and the supreme Atma (Paramatma) as being separate.\n\nAdvaita Vedanta philosophy considers Atman as self-existent awareness, limitless and non-dual. To Advaitins, the Atman is the Brahman, the Brahman is the Atman, each self is non-different from the infinite. Atman is the universal principle, one eternal undifferentiated self-luminous consciousness, the truth asserts Advaita Hinduism. Human beings, in a state of unawareness of this universal self, see their \"I-ness\" as different than the being in others, then act out of impulse, fears, cravings, malice, division, confusion, anxiety, passions, and a sense of distinctiveness. To Advaitins, Atman-knowledge is the state of full awareness, liberation, and freedom that overcomes dualities at all levels, realizing the divine within oneself, the divine in others, and in all living beings; the non-dual oneness, that God is in everything, and everything is God. This identification of individual living beings/souls, or jiva-atmas, with the 'one Atman' is the non-dualistic Advaita Vedanta position.\n\nThe monist, non-dual conception of existence in Advaita Vedanta is not accepted by the dualistic/theistic Dvaita Vedanta. Dvaita Vedanta calls the Atman of a supreme being as \"Paramatman\", and holds it to be different from individual Atman. Dvaita scholars assert that God is the ultimate, complete, perfect, but distinct soul, one that is separate from incomplete, imperfect \"jivas\" (individual souls). The Advaita sub-school believes that self-knowledge leads to liberation in this life, while the Dvaita sub-school believes that liberation is only possible in after-life as communion with God, and only through the grace of God (if not, then one's Atman is reborn). God created individual souls, state Dvaita Vedantins, but the individual soul never was and never will become one with God; the best it can do is to experience bliss by getting infinitely close to God. The Dvaita school, therefore, in contrast to monistic position of Advaita, advocates a version of monotheism wherein Brahman is made synonymous with Vishnu (or Narayana), distinct from numerous individual Atmans. Dvaita school, states Graham Oppy, is not strict monotheism, as it does not deny existence of other gods and their respective Atman.\n\nThe Vedanta sub-schools of Vishishtadvaita Vedanta and Achintya Bheda Abheda combine ideas about Ātman from dual and non-dual schools.\n\nĀtman, in the ritualism-based Mīmāṃsā school of Hinduism, is an eternal, omnipresent, inherently active essence that is identified as I-consciousness. Unlike all other schools of Hinduism, Mimamsaka scholars considered ego and Atman as the same. Within Mimamsa school, there was divergence of beliefs. Kumārila, for example, believed that Atman is the object of I-consciousness, whereas Prabhakara believed that Atman is the subject of I-consciousness. Mimamsaka Hindus believed that what matters is virtuous actions and rituals completed with perfection, and it is this that creates merit and imprints knowledge on Atman, whether one is aware or not aware of Atman. Their foremost emphasis was formulation and understanding of laws/duties/virtuous life (dharma) and consequent perfect execution of \"kriyas\" (actions). The Upanishadic discussion of Atman, to them, was of secondary importance. While other schools disagreed and discarded the Atma theory of Mimamsa, they incorporated Mimamsa theories on ethics, self-discipline, action, and dharma as necessary in one's journey toward knowing one's Atman.\n\nThe Vaisheshika school of Hinduism, using its non-theistic theories of atomistic naturalism, posits that Ātman is one of the four eternal non-physical substances without attributes, the other three being \"kala\" (time), \"dik\" (space) and \"manas\" (mind). Time and space, stated Vaiśeṣika scholars, are \"eka\" (one), \"nitya\" (eternal) and \"vibhu\" (all pervading). Time and space are indivisible reality, but human mind prefers to divide them to comprehend past, present, future, relative place of other substances and beings, direction and its own coordinates in the universe. In contrast to these characteristics of time and space, Vaiśeṣika scholars considered Ātman to be many, eternal, independent and spiritual substances that cannot be reduced or inferred from other three non-physical and five physical \"dravya\" (substances). Mind and sensory organs are instruments, while consciousness is the domain of \"atman, soul, self\".\n\nThe knowledge of Ātman, to Vaiśeṣika Hindus, is another knowledge without any \"bliss\" or \"consciousness\" moksha state that Vedanta and Yoga school describe.\n\nEarly atheistic Nyaya scholars, and later theistic Nyaya scholars, both made substantial contributions to the systematic study of Ātman. They posited that even though \"self/soul\" is intimately related to the knower, it can still be the subject of knowledge. John Plott states that the Nyaya scholars developed a theory of negation that far exceeds Hegel's theory of negation, while their epistemological theories refined to \"know the knower\" at least equals Aristotle's sophistication. Nyaya methodology influenced all major schools of Hinduism.\n\nThe Nyaya scholars defined Ātman as an imperceptible substance that is the substrate of human consciousness, manifesting itself with or without qualities such as desires, feelings, perception, knowledge, understanding, errors, insights, sufferings, bliss, and others. Nyaya school not only developed its theory of Atman, it contributed to Hindu philosophy in a number of ways. To the Hindu theory of Ātman, the contributions of Nyaya scholars were twofold. One, they went beyond holding it as \"self evident\" and offered rational proofs, consistent with their epistemology, in their debates with Buddhists, that \"Atman exists\". Second, they developed theories on what \"Atman is and is not\". As proofs for the proposition \"self/soul exists\", for example, Nyaya scholars argued that personal recollections and memories of the form \"I did this so many years ago\" implicitly presume that there is a self that is substantial, continuing, unchanged, and existent.\n\nNyayasutra, a 2nd-century CE foundational text of Nyaya school of Hinduism, states that the soul is a proper object of human knowledge. It also states that soul is a real substance that can be inferred from certain signs, objectively perceivable attributes. For example, in book 1, chapter 1, verses 9 and 10, Nyayasutra states\n\nIn book 2, chapter 1, verses 1 to 23, Nyayasutras text posits that the sensory act of looking is different than perception and cognition, that perception and knowledge arise from the seekings and actions of Ātman (soul). Naiyayikas emphasize that Ātman has qualities, but is different than its qualities. For example, desire is one of many quality of Ātman in Nyaya school, but they state that Ātman need not always have desire, and in the state of liberation, for instance, Atman is without desire. Atman is the object, and the conventional \"I, me\" is one of its subjects, to Nyaya school.\n\nThe concept of Ātman in Samkhya, the oldest school of Hinduism, is quite similar to one in Advaita Vedanta school. Both Samkhya and Advaita consider the ego (asmita, ahamkara) rather than the Ātman to be the cause of pleasure and pain. They both consider Ātman as self, soul that is innermost essence of any individual being. Further, they both consider self-knowledge as the means of liberation, freedom and bliss. The difference between Samkhya and Advaita is that Samkhya holds there are as many \"Atmans\" as there are beings, each distinct reality unto itself, and self-knowledge a state of Ipseity. In contrast, the monism theme of Advaita holds that there is one soul, and that the self of all beings are connected and unified with Brahman. The essence and spirit of everything is related to each self, asserts Advaita Vedanta, and each Atman is related to the essence and spirit of everything; all is one; self is Brahman and Brahman is self. Samkhya asserts that each being's Atman is unique and different.\n\nThe Yogasutra of Patanjali, the foundational text of Yoga school of Hinduism, mentions \"Atma\" in multiple verses, and particularly in its last book, where Samadhi is described as the path to self-knowledge and kaivalya. Some earlier mentions of Atman in Yogasutra include verse 2.5, where evidence of ignorance includes \"confusing what is not Atman as Atman\".\n\nIn verses 2.19-2.20, Yogasutra declares that pure ideas are the domain of the soul, the perceivable universe exists to enlighten the soul, but while the soul is pure, it may be deceived by complexities of perception or its intellect. These verses also set the purpose of all experience as a means to self-knowledge.\n\nIn Book 4, Yogasutra states spiritual liberation as the stage where the yogin achieves distinguishing self-knowledge, he no longer confuses his mind as his soul, the mind is no longer affected by afflictions or worries of any kind, ignorance vanishes, and \"pure consciousness settles in its own pure nature\".\n\nThe Yoga school is similar to the Samkhya school in its conceptual foundations of Ātman. It is the self that is discovered and realized in the Kaivalya state, in both schools. Like Samkhya, this is not a single universal Ātman. It is one of the many individual selves where each \"pure consciousness settles in its own pure nature\", as a unique distinct soul/self. However, Yoga school's methodology was widely influential on other schools of Hindu philosophy. Vedanta monism, for example, adopted Yoga as a means to reach \"Jivanmukti\" – self-realization in this life – as conceptualized in Advaita Vedanta.\n\nThe Atman theory in Upanishads had a profound impact on ancient ethical theories and dharma traditions now known as Hinduism. The earliest Dharmasutras of Hindus recite Atman theory from the Vedic texts and Upanishads, and on its foundation build precepts of dharma, laws and ethics. Atman theory, particularly the Advaita Vedanta and Yoga versions, influenced the emergence of the theory of Ahimsa (non-violence against all creatures), culture of vegetarianism, and other theories of ethical, dharmic life.\n\nThe Dharmasutras and Dharmasastras integrate the teachings of Atman theory. Apastamba Dharmasutra, the oldest known Indian text on dharma, for example, titles Chapters 1.8.22 and 1.8.23 as \"Knowledge of the Atman\" and then recites,\n\nThe ethical prohibition against harming any human beings or other living creatures (Ahimsa, अहिंसा), in Hindu traditions, can be traced to the Atman theory. This precept against injuring any living being appears together with Atman theory in hymn 8.15.1 of Chandogya Upanishad (ca. 8th century BCE), then becomes central in the texts of Hindu philosophy, entering the dharma codes of ancient \"Dharmasutras\" and later era \"Manu-Smriti\". Ahimsa theory is a natural corollary and consequence of \"Atman is universal oneness, present in all living beings. Atman connects and prevades in everyone. Hurting or injuring another being is hurting the Atman, and thus one's self that exists in another body\". This conceptual connection between one's Atman, the universal, and Ahimsa starts in Isha Upanishad, develops in the theories of the ancient scholar Yajnavalkya, and one which inspired Gandhi as he led non-violent movement against colonialism in early 20th century.\n\nAll orthodox schools of Hinduism hold the premise, \"Atman exists, as self evident truth\". Buddhism, in contrast, holds the premise, \"Atman does not exist (or, An-atman) as self evident\".\n\nBuddhists do not believe that at the core of all human beings and living creatures, there is any \"eternal, essential and absolute something called a soul, self or atman\". Buddhists reject the concept and all doctrines associated with atman, call atman as illusion (\"maya\"), asserting instead the theory of \"no-self\" and \"no-soul\". Buddhism, from its earliest days, has denied the existence of the \"self, soul\" in its core philosophical and ontological texts. In its soteriological themes, Buddhism has defined nirvana as that blissful state when a person realizes that he or she has \"no self, no soul\".\n\nHindus believe in Atman. They hold that at the core of all human beings and living creatures, there is \"eternal, innermost essential and absolute something called a soul, self that is atman.\" Within the diverse schools of Hinduism, there are differences of opinion on whether souls are distinct, whether a supreme soul or god exists, whether the nature of Atman is dual or non-dual, how to reach moksha– the knowledge of self that liberates one to blissful content state of existence, and whether moksha is achievable in this life (Advaita Vedanta, Yoga) or is achievable only in after-life (Dvaita Vedanta, Nyaya). However, despite these diversity of ideas and paths in different schools of Hinduism, unlike Buddhism, the foundation premise of Hinduism is that \"soul/self exists\", and there is bliss in seeking self, knowing self, and self-realization.\n\nBuddhist texts chronologically placed in the 1st millennium of common era, such as the Mahayana tradition's \"Tathāgatagarbha sūtras\" suggest self-like concepts, variously called \"Tathagatagarbha\" or \"Buddha nature\". These have been controversial idea in Buddhism, and \"eternal self\" concepts have been generally rejected. In modern era studies, scholars such as Wayman and Wayman state that these \"self-like\" concepts are neither self nor sentient being, nor soul, nor personality. Some scholars posit that the \"Tathagatagarbha Sutras\" were written to promote Buddhism to non-Buddhists.\n\nIn Theravada tradition, the Dhammakaya Movement in Thailand teaches that it is erroneous to subsume nirvana under the rubric of \"anatta\" (non-self); instead, nirvana is taught to be the \"true self\" or \"dhammakaya\". Similar interpretations have been put forth by the then Thai Sangharaja in 1939. According to Williams, the Sangharaja's interpretation echoes the \"tathāgatagarbha\" sutras. The Dhammakaya Movement teaching that nirvana is atta (atman) in 1999, has been criticized as heretical in Buddhism by Ven. Payutto, a well-known scholar monk, who added that 'Buddha taught nibbana as being non-self\". This dispute on the nature of teachings about 'self' and 'non-self' in Buddhism has led to arrest warrants, attacks and threats.\n\nAccording to Johannes Bronkhorst, a professor of Indology specializing in early Buddhism and Hinduism, while there may be ambivalence on the existence or non-existence of self in early Buddhist literature, it is clear from these texts that seeking self-knowledge is not the Buddhist path for liberation, and turning away from self-knowledge is.\n\nThe Atman concept and its discussions in Hindu philosophy, parallel with \"psuchê\" (soul) and its discussion in ancient Greek philosophy. Eliade notes that there is a capital difference, with schools of Hinduism asserting that liberation of Atman implies \"self-knowledge\" and \"bliss\". Similarly, self-knowledge conceptual theme of Hinduism (\"Atman jnana\") parallels the \"know thyself\" conceptual theme of Greek philosophy. Max Müller summarized it thus,\n\n\n\n"}
