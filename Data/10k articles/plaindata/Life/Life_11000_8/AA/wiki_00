The attack happened near Aleg, 250 km east of the capital Nouakchott.\n\nThe victims, five French tourists on holiday, were attacked while they were having a picnic. Four of them were killed and the fifth was seriously injured. There was one survivor; the victims were his two adult sons, brother, and a friend. The 2008 Dakar Rally was cancelled because of this incident due to concerns of a possible terrorist attack.\n\nMauritanian authorities arrested nine people on January 7, 2008. An assault rifle was recovered by police from a location close to the scene of the killings. The Mauritanian interior minister blamed a terrorist sleeper cell for the killings. Authorities say suspects are members of an extremist group linked to al-Qaida.\n\nOne of the suspects arrested in January, Sidi Ould Sidna, escaped from the police in March but was arrested again in April. Sidna had trained with the group Al-Qaeda in the Maghreb, which confirmed Sidna was affiliated with their organization. In 2010, three men who claimed to be \"soldiers of Al-Qaeda\", Sidi Ould Sidna, Mohamed Ould Chabarnou, and Maarouf Ould Haiba, were sentenced to death by a Mauritanian court for the attack. Since Mauritania has not used the death penalty since the 1980s, their death sentence will likely be commuted to an extended prison sentence on appeal.\n"}

He graduated from Harvard University in 1855, subsequently studying engineering and chemistry, and taking the degree of bachelor of science at the Lawrence scientific school of the same institution in 1857; in 1859 became an assistant in the United States Coast Survey. \nThenceforward he became a specialist in marine ichthyology. Agassiz was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1862. Up until the summer of 1866, Agassiz worked as an assistant in the museum of natural history that his father founded at Harvard.\nE. J. Hulbert, a friend of Agassiz's brother-in-law, Quincy Adams Shaw, had discovered a rich copper lode known as the Calumet conglomerate on the Keweenaw Peninsula in Michigan. Hulbert persuaded them, along with a group of friends, to purchase a controlling interest in the mines, which later became known as the Calumet and Hecla Mining Company based in Calumet, Michigan. That summer, he took a trip to see the mines for himself and he afterwards became treasurer of the enterprise.\n\nOver the winter of 1866 and early 1867, mining operations began to falter, due to the difficulty of extracting copper from the conglomerate. Hulbert had sold his interests in the mines and had moved on to other ventures. But Agassiz refused to give up hope for the mines. He returned to the mines in March 1867, with his wife and young son. At that time, Calumet was a remote settlement, virtually inaccessible during the winter and very far removed from civilization even during the summer. With insufficient supplies at the mines, Agassiz struggled to maintain order, while back in Boston, Shaw was saddled with debt and the collapse of their interests. Shaw obtained financial assistance from John Simpkins, the selling agent for the enterprise to continue operations.\n\nAgassiz continued to live at Calumet, making gradual progress in stabilizing the mining operations, such that he was able to leave the mines under the control of a general manager and return to Boston in 1868 before winter closed navigation. The mines continued to prosper and in May 1871, several mines were consolidated to form the Calumet and Hecla Mining Company with Shaw as its first president. In August 1871, Shaw \"retired\" to the board of directors and Agassiz became president, a position he held until his death. Until the turn of the century, this company was by far the largest copper producer in the United States, many years producing over half of the total.\n\nAgassiz was a major factor in the mine's continued success and visited the mines twice a year. He innovated by installing a giant engine, known as the Superior, which was able to lift 24 tons of rock from a depth of . He also built a railroad and dredged a channel to navigable waters. However, after a time the mines did not require his full-time, year-round, attention and he returned to his interests in natural history at Harvard. Out of his copper fortune, he gave some US$500,000 to Harvard for the museum of comparative zoology and other purposes.\n\nShortly after the death of his father in 1873, Agassiz acquired a small peninsula in Newport, Rhode Island, which features spectacular views of Narragansett Bay. Here he built a substantial house and a laboratory for use as his summer residence. The house was completed in 1875 and today is known as the Inn at Castle Hill.\n\nIn 1875, he surveyed Lake Titicaca, Peru, examined the copper mines of Peru and Chile, and made a collection of Peruvian antiquities for the Museum of Comparative Zoology (MCZ), of which he was first curator from 1874 to 1885 and then director until his death in 1910. He assisted Charles Wyville Thomson in the examination and classification of the collections of the 1872 \"Challenger\" Expedition, and wrote the \"Review of the Echini\" (2 vols., 1872–1874) in the reports. Between 1877 and 1880 he took part in the three dredging expeditions of the steamer \"Blake\" of the Coast Survey, and presented a full account of them in two volumes (1888).\n\nIn 1896 Agassiz visited Fiji and Queensland and inspected the Great Barrier Reef, publishing a paper on the subject in 1898.\n\nOf Agassiz's other writings on marine zoology, most are contained in the bulletins and memoirs of the museum of comparative zoology. However, in 1865, he published with Elizabeth Cary Agassiz, his stepmother, \"Seaside Studies in Natural History\", a work at once exact and stimulating. They also published, in 1871, \"Marine Animals of Massachusetts Bay\".\n\nHe received the German Order Pour le Mérite for Science and Arts in August 1902.\n\nAgassiz served as a president of the National Academy of Sciences, which since 1913 has awarded the Alexander Agassiz Medal in his memory. He died in 1910 on board the RMS \"Adriatic\" en route to New York from Southampton.\n\nHe was the father of three sons – George R. Agassiz (1861–1951), Maximilian Agassiz (1866–1943) and Rodolphe Agassiz (1871–1933).\n\nAlexander Agassiz is commemorated in the scientific name of a species of lizard, \"Anolis agassizi.\n\n\n\n\n"}

By providing remediation on-demand, learners can gain greater understanding of a topic while stimulating discovery and learning.\n\nTechnologies incorporating rich media and interaction have demonstrated the educational potential that scholars, teachers and students are embracing. Instead of focusing on memorization, the learner experiences an adaptive learning experience based upon the current context. The augmented content can be dynamically tailored to the learner's natural environment by displaying text, images, video or even playing audio (music or speech). This additional information is commonly shown in a pop-up window for computer-based environments.\n\nMost implementations of augmented learning are forms of e-learning. In desktop computing environments, the learner receives supplemental, contextual information through an on-screen, pop-up window, toolbar or sidebar. As the user navigates a website, e-mail or document, the learner associates the supplemental information with the key text selected by a mouse, touch or other input device. In mobile environments, augmented learning has also been deployed on tablets and smartphones.\n\nAugmented learning is closely related to augmented intelligence (intelligence amplification) and augmented reality. Augmented intelligence applies information processing capabilities to extend the processing capabilities of the human mind through distributed cognition. Augmented intelligence provides extra support for autonomous intelligence and has a long history of success. Mechanical and electronic devices that function as augmented intelligence range from the abacus, calculator, personal computers and smart phones. Software with augmented intelligence provide supplemental information that is related to the context of the user. When an individual's name appears on the screen, a pop-up window could display person's organizational affiliation, contact information and most recent interactions.\n\nIn mobile reality systems, the annotation may appear on the learner's individual \"heads-up display\" or through headphones for audio instruction. For example, apps for Google Glasses can provide video tutorials and interactive click-throughs, .\n\nForeign language educators are also beginning to incorporate augmented learning techniques to traditional paper-and-pen-based exercises. For example, augmented information is presented near the primary subject matter, allowing the learner to learn how to write glyphs while understanding the meaning of the underlying characters. See Understanding language, below.\n\nAugmentation tools can help learners understand issues, acquire relevant information and solve complex issues by presenting supplementary information at the time of need or \"on demand.\" This contrasts with traditional methods of associative learning, including rote learning, classical conditioning and observational learning, where the learning is performed in advance of the learner's need to recall or apply what has been learned.\n\nSnyder and Wilson assert that just-in-time learning is not sufficient. Long-term learning demands continuous training should be individualized and built upon individual competencies and strengths.\n\nAugmented learning tools have been useful for learners to gain an enhanced understanding of words or to understand a foreign language. The interactive, dynamic nature of these on-demand language assistants can provide definitions, sample sentences and even audible pronunciations. When sentences or blocks of text are selected, the words are read aloud while the user follows along with the native text or phonetics. Speech rate control can tailor the text-to-speech (TTS) to keep pace with the learner's comprehension.\n\nAugmented reality has come a long way in the science field, but it is still in its infancy. They have started using webcams, making them read a certain marker label, then an object where the label would be comes up on the screen. Developers are continuing to gather information on how AR (augmented reality) could take it's part in the learning environment. Over the past few years there have been technologies added to the classroom such as computers, laptops, projectors, white boards and much more. It is allowing students to be more engaged in what is happening. \n\nStudents are also now able to take notes without having to listening to what the teacher is saying, but instead writing what they typed on the projector. The notes can be more thorough and to the point, rather than an entire explanation. With the help of AR we can also see pictures on the board showing students the space in between certain objects such as planets or atoms.\n\nOne researcher has suggested that handheld devices like cell phones and portable game machines (Game Boy, PlayStation Portable) can make an impact on learning. These mobile devices excel in their portability, context sensitivity, connectivity and ubiquity. By incorporating social dynamics in a real-world context, learning games can create compelling environments for learners.\n\nAt the Allard Pierson Museum in Amsterdam, visitors view information on-demand at the \"A Future for the Past\" exhibit. In a virtual reconstruction of Satricum and the Forum Romanum, users can call up information that is overlaid on room-sized photos and other images. The museum uses both stationary displays and mobile computers to allow users to view translucent images and information keyed to their specific interest.\n\nCritics may see learning augmentation as a crutch that precludes memorization; similar arguments have been made about using calculators in the past. Just as rote learning is also not a substitute for understanding, augmented learning is simply another faculty for helping learners recall, present and process information.\n\nCurrent research suggests that even unconscious visual learning can be effective. Visual stimuli, rendered in flashes of information, showed signs of learning even when the human adult subjects were unaware of the stimulus or reward contingencies.\n\nAugmented learning has allowed not only students to learn, but also their parents. Tools like mobile games have made it easier for parents to understand more fully what their child is learning in school. Technology brings the childs content to a new platform which is helpful to parents when trying to make meaningful connections to what their child is learning in school. Furthermore, augmented reality has brought a new way of learning to young children to have the ability to articulate words. By using marker labels in books that are read by a tablet, making pictures appear on the screen along with audio narration for enhanced reading. \n\nAugmented Reality in education has the potential to change the timing and location of the conventional learning process. This style of learning introduces new methods of studying. With the boom of technology and younger students being the biggest users, the learning platform has the ability to connect this generation and their smartphones to gain knowledge. Though it has yet to be fully discovered, Augmented Reality in education is looking to become a large market.\n\nThis style of learning can gain attention and expand the students interest in subject and topics he would not learn or come across in the conventional classroom lecture. Extra data such as fun facts, visual models, or historical data from events could give a wider understanding of the topics being taught. The learning platform hopes to explain abstract concepts, engage and interact with the learner, and discover and learn additional information about what they what to learn.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2884728", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2884728", "title": "Automated reasoning", "text": "Automated reasoning\n\nAutomated reasoning is an area of computer science and mathematical logic dedicated to understanding different aspects of reasoning. The study of automated reasoning helps produce computer programs that allow computers to reason completely, or nearly completely, automatically. Although automated reasoning is considered a sub-field of artificial intelligence, it also has connections with theoretical computer science, and even philosophy.\n\nThe most developed subareas of automated reasoning are automated theorem proving (and the less automated but more pragmatic subfield of interactive theorem proving) and automated proof checking (viewed as guaranteed correct reasoning under fixed assumptions). Extensive work has also been done in reasoning by analogy induction and abduction.\n\nOther important topics include reasoning under uncertainty and non-monotonic reasoning. An important part of the uncertainty field is that of argumentation, where further constraints of minimality and consistency are applied on top of the more standard automated deduction. John Pollock's OSCAR system is an example of an automated argumentation system that is more specific than being just an automated theorem prover.\n\nTools and techniques of automated reasoning include the classical logics and calculi, fuzzy logic, Bayesian inference, reasoning with maximal entropy and a large number of less formal \"ad hoc\" techniques.\n\nThe development of formal logic played a big role in the field of automated reasoning, which itself led to the development of artificial intelligence. A formal proof is a proof in which every logical inference has been checked back to the fundamental axioms of mathematics. All the intermediate logical steps are supplied, without exception. No appeal is made to intuition, even if the translation from intuition to logic is routine. Thus, a formal proof is less intuitive, and less susceptible to logical errors.\n\nSome consider the Cornell Summer meeting of 1957, which brought together a large number of logicians and computer scientists, as the origin of automated reasoning, or automated deduction. Others say that it began before that with the 1955 Logic Theorist program of Newell, Shaw and Simon, or with Martin Davis’ 1954 implementation of Presburger’s decision procedure (which proved that the sum of two even numbers is even). Automated reasoning, although a significant and popular area of research, went through an \"AI winter\" in the eighties and early nineties. The field subsequently revived, however. For example, in 2005, Microsoft started using verification technology in many of their internal projects and is planning to include a logical specification and checking language in their 2012 version of Visual C.\n\nPrincipia Mathematica was a milestone work in formal logic written by Alfred North Whitehead and Bertrand Russell. Principia Mathematica - also meaning Principles of Mathematics - was written with a purpose to derive all or some of the mathematical expressions, in terms of symbolic logic. Principia Mathematica was initially published in three volumes in 1910, 1912 and 1913.\n\nLogic Theorist (LT) was the first ever program developed in 1956 by Allen Newell, Cliff Shaw and Herbert A. Simon to \"mimic human reasoning\" in proving theorems and was demonstrated on fifty-two theorems from chapter two of Principia Mathematica, proving thirty-eight of them. In addition to proving the theorems, the program found a proof for one of the theorems that was more elegant than the one provided by Whitehead and Russell. After an unsuccessful attempt at publishing their results, Newell, Shaw, and Herbert reported in their publication in 1958, \"The Next Advance in Operation Research\":\n\nExamples of Formal Proofs\n\n\n\n\nAutomated reasoning has been most commonly used to build automated theorem provers. Oftentimes, however, theorem provers require some human guidance to be effective and so more generally qualify as proof assistants. In some cases such provers have come up with new approaches to proving a theorem. Logic Theorist is a good example of this. The program came up with a proof for one of the theorems in Principia Mathematica that was more efficient (requiring fewer steps) than the proof provided by Whitehead and Russell. Automated reasoning programs are being applied to solve a growing number of problems in formal logic, mathematics and computer science, logic programming, software and hardware verification, circuit design, and many others. The TPTP (Sutcliffe and Suttner 1998) is a library of such problems that is updated on a regular basis. There is also a competition among automated theorem provers held regularly at the CADE conference (Pelletier, Sutcliffe and Suttner 2002); the problems for the competition are selected from the TPTP library.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "15340830", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15340830", "title": "Clover (creature)", "text": "Clover (creature)\n\nClover is the production name given to the giant monster in the 2008 film \"Cloverfield\". The creature was originally conceived by producer J. J. Abrams and was designed by artist Neville Page. In the film, the monster's name is never mentioned; the name \"Cloverfield\" is only given to the US Department of Defense case file of the incidents depicted in the film. The Department of Defense names the creature \"LSA\" for Large-Scale Aggressor in the film's Blu-ray special feature called \"Cloverfield Special Investigation Mode\". The name Clover was the nickname affectionately given to the monster among the production staff.\n\nThe monster was first referred to in the viral marketing campaign for \"Cloverfield\", including a recording of its roar, foreign news clips about a monster attack and sonar images. It then made its first full appearance in the film, where it was seen to be 25 stories tall and rampaging through New York City while being attacked by the United States military.\n\nA similar monster next appears in the four-part manga series \"Cloverfield/Kishin\" (2008) by Yoshiki Togawa, which serves as a spin-off from the film.\n\nClover does not appear in the second film of the \"Cloverfield\" franchise, the 2016 film \"10 Cloverfield Lane\".\n\nDespite its size, Clover was conceived by the film's creators as being a newborn. In \"The Cloverfield Paradox\" (2018), a similar but significantly larger creature is seen at the conclusion of the film. Earlier in the 2018 film, a massive shadow was seen by the character Michael Hamilton, but it is not made clear if the shadow was from the creature seen at the end of the film, or from the original Clover, or from a third member of Clover’s species.\n\nJ. J. Abrams conceived of a new monster after he and his son visited a toy store in Japan while promoting \"\". He explained, \"We saw all these Godzilla toys, and I thought, we need our own [American] monster, and not like King Kong, King Kong's adorable. But I wanted something that was just insane and intense\".\n\nThe monster was designed by artist Neville Page. He sought a biological rationale for the creature, though many of his ideas would not show up on screen. Page designed the creature as immature and suffering from \"separation anxiety\". He compared the creature to a rampaging elephant, saying \"there's nothing scarier than something huge that's spooked\". Page said of the creature's backstory, \"For me, one of the most key moments in our collective brainstorming was the choice to make the creature be something that we would empathize with. It is not out there just killing. It is confused, lost, scared. It's a newborn. Having this be a story point (one that the audience does not know), it allowed for some purposeful choices about its anatomy, movement and, yes, motivations\". The creature was developed by visual effects supervisor Kevin Blank and Phil Tippett's company Tippett Studio. Blank described the intended goal of the creature, \"Rather than the monster having a personality [like Godzilla or King Kong], it's more of an entity or an event\".\n\nReeves described the creature's reaction to its surroundings thus: \"It’s this new environment that it finds frightening\". To indicate this, Reeves suggested the addition of white in the creature's eyes so it would look similar to a spooked horse. The filmmakers generated and used the idea of parasites because the film could not realistically have scenes between the human protagonists and the enormous creature.\n\nAlthough conceived by the film's creators as infantile, the creature is 25 stories tall (corresponding to 250+ feet or 76+ meters) and withstands missiles, artillery shells, and bombs with minimal injury.\n\nIt is vaguely quadrupedal, though capable of standing upright over short distances. The limbs are comparatively long and thin compared with the body core, and according to creator Neville Page, this, coupled with its quadrupedal stance, is meant to imply that it is a newborn: he speculates that the adults may be bipedal. The forelimbs are large in proportion to the body, and the hind legs stubby. The creature's head at first glance appears to be a solid sphere; but it can open its mouth extremely wide. Above the eyes on either side of the head are fleshy pouches which it inflates when agitated.\n\nThe creature's design includes appendages on its underbelly, described by Neville Page as an \"elongated, and articulated external esophagus with the business end terminating in teethlike fingers\". They were designed to relate the scale of human prey to the huge scale of the creature. The scenes from the film where people were consumed by these appendages were cut from the final edit, but the fourth and final chapter of \"Cloverfield/Kishin\" shows this.\n\nThe creature is covered with parasites, which it sheds as part of a \"post-birth ritual\". Abrams described the parasites as \"horrifying, dog-sized creatures that just scatter around the city and add to the nightmare of the evening\". Reeves added that \"The parasites have a voracious, rabid, bounding nature, but they also have a crab-like crawl. They have the viciousness of a dog, but with the ability to climb walls and stick to objects.\" The top half of the parasite's head is the mandible. The top and lower jaws end in serrated edges and have four pairs of eyes each. The rest of the parasite consists of a crustacean-like carapace, several pairs of claws, and arms. A deep blue-purple muscular membrane stretches between the top and lower jaws. When a human is bitten, the victim becomes ill and bleeds profusely, mainly from the eyes, and shortly after this, the torso expands and explodes. They are called HSPs (Human Scale Parasites) on the Blu-ray Special Investigation Mode.\n\nArtist Neville Page, in response to claims that the design of the creature was similar to that of the 2006 South Korean film \"The Host\", said, \"They are [similar] in that they ravage and seem to originate from the water, but the end results are quite different. However, when I finally saw some of the concept art, there were some very obvious similarities. But then again, I think that we were both channeling similar biological possibilities.\"\n\nInitially, the viral marketing campaign for \"Cloverfield\" suggested that the creature was an amphibious organism awakened by the fall of a satellite into the ocean. However, the events of \"The Cloverfield Paradox\" suggest that for some versions of Earth, the organism may have originated from another dimension.\n\nBased on the success of \"Cloverfield\", which earned over $40 million during its opening weekend in January 2008, the toy company Hasbro began accepting orders for a 14-inch limited edition toy figure of the monster to be shipped to fans starting December 24, 2008. It comes with several accessories, including the disembodied head of the Statue of Liberty, two changeable heads (one with an open mouth, one with a closed mouth), and 10 static figures of the monster's parasites.\n\nReviewing the film \"Cloverfield\", the \"San Jose Mercury News\" described the creature as \"a monster for the MySpace generation\". Reviewer James Berardinelli noted, \"The movie follows the \"Jaws\" rule that monsters are usually more intimidating when they are shown infrequently and only in brief glimpses\". Amy Biancolli of the \"Houston Chronicle\" described the creature as retaining \"an air of mystery—a monstrous \"je ne sais quoi\" that makes him all the freakier.\" Richard Corliss of \"Time\" complained of the recycled elements of the creature, such as its emergence mimicking the original \"Godzilla\" film and its parasites being similar to the \"toy meanies\" from the 1984 film \"Gremlins\".\n\nRoger Ebert of the \"Chicago Sun-Times\" expressed acceptance of the lack of explanation for the creature's origin, explaining that it \"is all right with me after the tiresome opening speeches in so many of the 30 or more \"Godzilla\" films\". Peter Howell of the \"Toronto Star\" thought that the \"main\" creature was disappointing, while he considered the \"mutant spider crabs\" that came from it as \"way scarier\". Lawrence Person of \"Locus Online\" describes it as \"like a cross between a truly giant mantis and Johnny the Skeletal Torso.\" Todd McCarthy of \"Variety\" found that the creature was more reassuring as it appeared more in the film, explaining, \"Its very nature as a walking, stalking being suggests it can somehow be killed by conventional means\". Chris Vognar of \"The Dallas Morning News\" applauded the creature's appearance as cinematic:\n\n\n"}

The laws on its role and function vary by jurisdiction.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, all inquests were once conducted with a jury. They acted somewhat like a grand jury, determining whether a person should be committed to trial in connection to a death. Such a jury was made up of up to twenty-three men, and required the votes of twelve to render a decision. Similar to a grand jury, a Coroner's Jury merely accused, it did not convict.\n\nSince 1927, Coroner's Juries have rarely been used in England. Under the \"Coroners Act, 1988\", a Jury is only required to be convened in cases where the death occurred in prison, police custody, or in circumstances which may affect public health or safety. The coroner can actually choose to convene a jury in any investigation, but in practice this is rare. The qualifications to sit on a Coroner's Jury are the same as those to sit on a jury in Crown Court, the High Court, and the county courts.\n\nAdditionally, a Coroner's Jury only determines cause of death, its ruling does not commit a person to trial. While grand juries, which did have the power to indict, were abolished in the United Kingdom by 1948 (after being effectively stopped in 1933), Coroner's Juries retained those powers until the Criminal Law Act 1977. This change came about after Lord Lucan was charged in 1975 by a Coroner's Jury in the death of Sandra Rivett, his children's nanny.\n\nA coroner's jury deemed Wyatt Earp, Doc Holliday, and their posse guilty in the death of Frank Stilwell in March 1882 (See ).\n\nIn the aftermath of the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire, a coroner's jury found factory owners Isaac Harris and Max Blanck responsible for the death of Mary Herman, a factory operator.\n\n"}
{"id": "54250976", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54250976", "title": "Death of Conrad Roy", "text": "Death of Conrad Roy\n\nConrad Henri Roy III (September 12, 1995 July 13, 2014) was an American marine salvage captain. His suicide at the age of 18 with encouragement from his long-distance girlfriend, 17-year-old Michelle Carter, was the subject of a noted investigation and involuntary manslaughter trial in Massachusetts, popularly known as the \"texting suicide case\". The case, \"Commonwealth v. Michelle Carter\", involved many text messages, emails, and phone calls between Carter and Roy at the time of Roy's death. Roy had seen numerous mental health professionals and insisted he wanted to die. They had both been prescribed psychiatric medication. The case raised complex questions about criminal responsibility. Carter was convicted by a judge of involuntary manslaughter, who stated this was due specifically to a final text in which Carter told Roy to get back in his truck when he became scared.\n\nRoy was born in 1995 in Mattapoisett, Massachusetts. He was sometimes socially anxious attending school and going into the classroom. For many years he worked with his father, grandfather, and uncle in his family's marine salvage business, Tucker-Roy Marine Towing and Salvage, Inc. in the New England area. In the Spring of 2014 he earned his captain's license from the Northeast Maritime Institute by completing three months of night classes. In June 2014 he graduated on the Honor Roll (highest grades) from Old Rochester Regional High School (ORR) in Mattapoisett. He was an all-around high school athlete who played baseball, rowed crew, and ran track. He graduated with a 3.88 GPA and had been accepted to Fitchburg State University to study business, but at that point had decided not to go.\n\nRoy struggled with social anxiety and depression for which he had seen several therapists and counselors, including a cognitive behavioral therapist in the weeks prior to his death. He had been hospitalized for an acetaminophen (paracetamol) overdose at the age of 17; he was talking to a girl he had met in a group and she called the police.\n\nOn Sunday, July 13, 2014, following digital exchanges with Carter while interacting with his family, Roy committed suicide by poisoning himself with carbon monoxide fumes in his truck in the now-closed Kmart parking lot in Fairhaven, Massachusetts. \nCarter attended a different high school, King Philip Regional High School, in Wrentham, Massachusetts. They had met on family vacation in Florida several years prior and had maintained on-off communication, meeting only a few times.\n\nRoy's Memorial Mass was celebrated on Saturday, July 19, 2014, at St. Anthony's Church in Mattapoisett. The Captain Conrad H. Roy III Scholarship Fund at the Northeast Maritime Institute in Fairhaven, Massachusetts, was established in his memory.\n\nMichelle Carter was indicted on February 4, 2015, and arraigned the following day at in New Bedford Juvenile Court on charges of involuntary manslaughter in Taunton, Massachusetts. The grand jury found enough to charge her with \"wantonly and recklessly\" assisting the suicide. She was 17 at the time and the court indicted her as a 'youthful offender' rather than a 'juvenile', meaning she could be sentenced as if an adult.\n\nIn May 2015, Roy's family were upset by pictures posted on social media by Gail Carter, despite a court order, showing her daughter Michelle in a prom dress and on a trip to Orlando taking part in a DECA schools competition which included visiting Walt Disney World.\n\nIn June 2015 a district court judge denied a defense motion to remove the Bristol County District Attorney’s office from the prosecution because DA Thomas M. Quinn III is a third cousin of Conrad Roy and first cousin to Roy’s grandmother Janice Roy. Quinn had already handed the case over to his Deputy DA William McCauley. On July 1, 2016 an appeal heard by the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court was also denied, on the basis that there was probable cause, allowing the case to go forward.\n\nThe day before trial was due to start on June 6, 2017, Carter waived her right to jury trial and therefore the case was heard by Hon. Lawrence Moniz in the Bristol County Juvenile Court of Massachusetts, in Taunton. Carter was represented by Joseph P. Cataldo and Cory Madera. It is believed to be the first involuntary manslaughter trial in Massachusetts related to texting to encourage suicide though there have been a few related cases.\n\nOn June 16, 2017, Judge Lawrence Moniz of the Bristol County Juvenile Court of Massachusetts, in Taunton found Carter legally guilty of involuntary manslaughter. He stated prior to his ruling that it was Carter's phone calls with Roy when he was in his truck gassing himself (as described by Carter's texts to friends), rather than the preceding text messages, that caused him to go through with killing himself.\n\nAccording to CNN, this decision \"could set legal precedent for whether it's a crime to tell someone to commit suicide.\" Carter remained free on bail until her sentencing on August 3 when she was sentenced to 2.5 years in prison for manslaughter, though she faced up to 20 years.\n\nIn April 2016 Roy's mother Lynn reportedly said she was not sure what she wanted to happen to Carter, referring to an interaction between two unwell people and that Carter could have saved him. After the guilty verdict Roy's father stated publicly that the family were pleased with the verdict but that they wanted privacy and time to process the events they have experienced; Lynn Roy appeared on the CBS '48 Hours' show saying she didn't believe Carter had a conscience and that she knew exactly what she was doing.\n\nOn August 3, 2017, Judge Lawrence Moniz sentenced Carter to serve a two-and-a-half-year term, with 15 months to be served in the Bristol County House of Corrections, the rest of the balance suspended, and five years of probation to be served. Soon after the sentencing was handed down, Carter's lawyers asked Judge Moniz to issue a stay of the sentence until all of Carter's Massachusetts court appeals options are exhausted. Judge Moniz granted the stay with conditions that Carter stay away from the Roy family.\n\nMichelle Carter and then 16-year-old Conrad Roy met one another in Florida in 2012 while each had been visiting relatives. After this initial encounter, they saw each other in person again only once or twice over the course of three years, despite having lived only about 35 miles (55 km) away from each other in the Boston suburbs. Instead, they mostly exchanged text messages and emails.\n\nRoy also made some videos of himself talking to camera, which formed an important part of the case.\n\nCarter was born on August 11, 1996, in Massachusetts to Gail and David Carter. She went to King Philip Regional High School, Wrentham. She had developed an eating disorder from the age 8 or 9, may have injured herself by cutting, was on prescription psychiatric medication from the age of 14, and attended counseling at McLean Hospital in Belmont.\n\nAccording to court documents, Roy had allegedly been physically hit by his father and verbally abused by his grandfather, and tried to kill himself in October 2012 while despondent after his parents divorced. After learning that he was planning to kill himself, Carter repeatedly discouraged him from committing suicide in 2012 and 2014 and encouraged him to \"get professional help\". However, her attitude changed in July 2014, when she started thinking that it would be a \"good thing to help him die\". In June, Roy had texted Carter suggesting they act like Romeo and Juliet, checking that she understood they had each killed themselves.\n\nProsecutors claimed that Carter had sought public attention from her boyfriend's death, and their putative relationship was almost entirely online rather than in-person. The suggestibility and vulnerability of Roy, a minor at the time, has been an issue.\n\nCarter's defense lawyers argued that Roy had a history of suicide attempts and the decision to end his life was his own, that Carter was \"bewildered\" over the case against her, and that, \"Taking all the texts in context, she tried to talk him out of it... .\" They argued in initial hearings that the defendant had broken no law and had been a first amendment right to free speech, and that at that time she was a juvenile.\n\nRoy had also been taking Celexa for some time. In the United States, citalopram carries a boxed warning stating it may increase suicidal thinking and behavior in those under age 24. In 2016 the judge had refused the defense's request for funds to hire an expert on Celexa, describing it as 'speculative'.\n\nThe case is expected by some to set a legal precedent. \"The ruling... may spur lawmakers to codify the behavior highlighted in the case as criminal.\" The judge had noted that Carter had willed Roy's death, that she did not order him out of the truck and that her actions \"put him in that toxic environment\" which \"constituted reckless conduct\" and \"that the conduct caused the death of Mr. Roy.\" In effect, her actions led to his death and that her complicity did not falter.\n\nWhile, per U.S. law, the lower-court decision cannot bind other courts, legal professionals believe it could have a social effect by raising other courts' attention to new, digital methods of committing crimes. The case also attempts to redefine the social spectrum and which attitudes and behaviors would qualify as criminal that were not considered criminal before. \n\nCarter was sentenced to 2.5 years (30 months) in prison but to serve 15 months (1.25 years).\n\nOn September 23, 2018, Lifetime released a TV film called \"\" which stars Austin P. McKenzie as Conrad Roy and Bella Thorne as Michelle Carter.\n\n"}

{"id": "20753177", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20753177", "title": "Euthanasia device", "text": "Euthanasia device\n\nA euthanasia device is a machine engineered to allow an individual to die quickly with minimal pain. The most common devices are those designed to help terminally ill people die by voluntary euthanasia or assisted suicide without prolonged pain. They may be operated by a second party, such as a physician, or by the person wishing to die. There is an ongoing debate on the ethics of euthanasia and the use of euthanasia devices.\n\nInvented by Jack Kevorkian, to use this device and called it a \"Thanatron\" or death machine after the Greek daemon, Thanatos. It worked by pushing a button to deliver the euthanizing drugs mechanically through an IV. It had three canisters mounted on a metal frame. Each bottle had a syringe that connected to a single IV line in the person's arm. One contained saline, another contained a sleep-inducing barbiturate called sodium thiopental and the third a lethal mixture of potassium chloride, which immediately stopped the heart, and pancuronium bromide, a paralytic medication to prevent spasms during the dying process. Two deaths were assisted with this method.\n\nKevorkian assisted others with a device that employed a gas mask fed by a canister of carbon monoxide which was called \"Mercitron\" (mercy machine). This became necessary because Kevorkian's medical license had been revoked after the first two deaths, and he could no longer have legal access to the substances required for the \"Thanatron\". It was a rudimentary device consisting of a canister of carbon monoxide attached to a face mask with a tube. A valve must be released to start the gas flowing. Depending on the person's disability, a makeshift handle may be attached to the valve to make it easier to turn. Or, with the valve in the \"open\" position, a clip or clothespin could be clamped on the tubing. Pulling it off allows the gas to flow. By Kevorkian's estimates, this method took 10 minutes or longer. Sometimes he encouraged people to take sedatives or muscle relaxants to keep them calm as they breathed deeply of the gas.\n\nThe Deliverance Machine was invented by Philip Nitschke. It consisted of software entitled Deliverance, that came on a special laptop that could be connected to an IV in a person's arm. The computer program asked a series of questions to confirm the person's intent to die. After answering affirmatively to all of the questions, a lethal injection of barbiturates was triggered.\n\nIn an interview Nitschke said that, even if it had been legal for a doctor to give a lethal injection, he preferred that the patient be in control of the administration of the drugs. Reducing the role of a physician also allowed a patient to be alone with their family during the euthanasia process.\n\nThe machine was used, legally, while the Australian Northern Territory's Rights of the Terminally Ill Act 1995 was in effect; the act was eventually nullified by legislation of the Australian Parliament.\n\nThe Exit International euthanasia device was invented by Philip Nitschke in 2008. It uses a canister of nitrogen, a plastic suicide bag, and a plastic tube with one end attached to the gas canister and the other fixed inside the bag by a tie held by adhesive tape. Nitschke said, \"That idea of giving people access to a means of feeling that they're back in control of this issue is actually a way of prolonging life. It may seem paradoxical, but what we find is when people feel that they're back in control, they're less likely to do desperate things.\"\n\nThe basic principle of autoeuthanasia by anoxia was first described in the book \"Final Exit\" by Derek Humphry in 1991. The original methodology was devised, using helium, by the \"NuTech\" group.\n\nNitschke described his device as a modification of the exit bag with helium method described in \"The Peaceful Pill Handbook\". Helium was replaced by a cylinder of compressed nitrogen and a regulator to supply the nitrogen into a plastic bag. One advantage of this method was the availability of larger amounts of nitrogen and flow rates last longer. Nitschke states that nitrogen is also more physiologically inert than helium, with less chance of adverse reaction, and that loss of consciousness is quick with death following within minutes. Unlike helium cylinders, nitrogen cylinders can be refilled in the event of leakage and nitrogen gas can't be detected during an autopsy.\n\nThe principle behind the device is oxygen deprivation that leads to hypoxia, asphyxia and death within minutes. Deprivation of oxygen in the presence of carbon dioxide creates panic and a sense of suffocation (the hypercapnic alarm response), and struggling even when unconscious, whereas anoxia in the presence of an inert gas, like nitrogen, helium or argon, does not.\n\nClose contact with an enclosed inert gas is lethal, but released into the open air, it quickly disperses, and is safe for others. It is neither flammable nor explosive. Humphry's book describes close contact with the gas achieved by enclosing the head in a strong, clear plastic bag, secured around the neck, with the inert gas fed into the bag by plastic tubing.\n\nSuicides using this method are documented in the forensic literature. In the study \"Asphyxial suicide with helium and a plastic bag\" (Ogden et al.), the authors describe a typical case history, in which an elderly cancer sufferer used a plastic bag which was secured over her head, a helium tank, and a plastic hose attached to the tank valve and plastic bag. The authors noted that a suicide bag filled with helium will cause almost immediate unconsciousness, followed within minutes by death. Time to loss of consciousness in a bag filled with nitrogen is 15 seconds, according to professors Copeland, Pappas and Parr, who campaigned for a more humane execution method in the US state of Oklahoma.\n\nIn 2017 Nitschke invented the 3D-printed suicide capsule, which he named \"the Sarco machine\". The Sarco capsule would contain a touchpad and nitrogen, and once an activation code is entered, \"the person is again asked if they wish to die\". An affirmative answer causes nitrogen to flow into the capsule, displacing oxygen, and death follows shortly thereafter. The Sarco machine cannot be printed on small 3D printers. The Sarco offers a \"euphoric death\".\n\nNitschke plans to release the open source plans for the Sarco by 2019.\n\n\n"}

The Evaporating Cloud (EC) - also referred to in the literature as \"the cloud\", or as a \"conflict resolution diagram\" - is a logical diagram representing a problem that has no obvious satisfactory solution.\n\nThe most commonly used of the TOC tools, the EC was designed to address conﬂict or dilemma situations (trade-off situations where there is no acceptable compromise) by diagramming the logic behind the conflict and methodically examining the assumptions behind the logic.\nThe EC has a set format with five boxes, labelled A, B, C, D, D’, that are usually laid out as follows:\n\nThe boxes represent two opposing \"wants\" that represent the conflict (D, D’), the \"needs\" that each want is trying to satisfy (B, C), and a common \"objective\" or goal (A) that both needs are trying to fulfil.\n\nThe lines or arrows connecting the nodes represent the rationale or causal assumptions that are used to link the nodes. When communicating the cloud, the arrows should be read as “in order to” or “because” or “so that”. For example: \"“In order to achieve A we require B because there is no way we can have A without B.”\" Or: \"“There is no way we can have D and have D’ \"(read as \"D-prime\")\" at the same time.”\"\n\nAccording to Scheinkopf (2002) the Evaporating Cloud is so named in honor of Richard Bach. In Bach's 1977 book \"Illusions\", the main characters remove storm clouds from the sky by thinking them away.\nThe Evaporating Cloud tool is intended to similarly \"vapourize\" difficult problems by resolving an underlying conflict.\n\nThe general process for applying an EC to problem solving is described by Cohen (2010) as follows:\n\nClouds are \"built\" by filling in the appropriate boxes with statements about the situation. Both the wording of the statements and the sequence of filling the boxes can be important. Below is a guide to the recommended sequence and questions for building \"Day-to-day Conflict\" or \"Inner Dilemma\" clouds.\nDifferent types of problems have slightly different requirements when it comes to documenting and communicating the underlying conflict. Below is a summary of different types of problems, and the suggested sequence for building and communicating the cloud.\nGoldratt has illustrated the use of the evaporating cloud technique in a discussion of the Economic production quantity model. The prerequisite wants are to \"run large batches\" (D) and yet to \"run small batches\" (D’). These are clearly in conflict. The required need that D is trying to meet is to \"reduce setup cost\" (B), whereas the D’ prerequisite needs to \"reduce carrying cost per unit\" (C). Both requirements are aimed at the objective (A): to \"reduce cost per unit\".\nFedurko (2011) recommends checking the logic of the EC by reading the logical statements aloud, in the following sequence:\n\nAccording to Fedurko,\n\nGoldratt claims that each of the logical connections in the EC represent an (often hidden) assumption.\n\nThe assumptions behind the above connections can be surfaced by again reading the statements with a \"because\" clause added. For example, Goldratt surfaces the following assumptions behind the 2nd statement in the example EC:\nAnd again, with the 5th statement:\n\nThe second assumption is challenged by distinguishing between \"production batch\" size (between setups) and \"transfer batch\" size (between workstations), and so allowing different sized batches for different purposes.\n\nThe Core Conflict Cloud is an Evaporating Cloud that emerges from analysis of a current reality tree (CRT), which is one of the Thinking Processes. The CRT provides a way for analyzing many system or organizational problems at once, treating them as symptoms of a single core problem.\nIf an easy solution to such a core problem has not already been implemented, it is likely there is some conflict in the organization that is blocking implementation. The role of the Core Conflict Cloud is to address this inherent conflict that is preventing the sorting out of the core problem.\n\n"}

This type of vehicle is used to pick up the remains of a recently deceased person, and transport that person to the funeral home for preparation. This initial pickup is called the \"first call\", hence the name of these vehicles. While some funeral homes will use the hearse for these initial pickups, having vehicles for first calls and using the hearse solely for funerals reduces wear on hearses and makes the first call process more discreet.\n\nToday, the vehicles usually used for this service are minivans. In some cases, funeral homes purchase minivans that have been converted into first call vehicles by the same companies that produce hearses. In other cases, general purpose minivans are purchased without the rear seats installed. \n\nIn the United States, larger SUVs such as the Chevrolet Suburban and Ford Excursion have been employed. Their large wheelbase, pickup truck-derived chassis and larger engines make them popular, well suited to their purpose and requiring little alteration. From the 1970s to the mid-1990s, full-sized station wagons such as the Chevrolet Caprice, Buick Roadmaster and Ford LTD were popular options as well. Conversion on these ranged from tinting or blacking-out the rear windows, and installing a metal deck (or sometimes, just bars) to secure the stretcher or casket, to having the rear section modified as a landau and the installation of a casket tray, similar to a hearse. Many of these remain in service.\n\nIt is not uncommon for older hearses to be employed as a first call vehicle. This often makes sense for the funeral home when a new hearse is purchased, as opposed to purchasing a second new vehicle.\n\nThe First Call vehicle is sometimes operated by an outside company that has contracts with various mortuaries and funeral homes, rather than by the funeral homes. In the UK, these are known as \"private ambulances\"\n\n"}
{"id": "842532", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=842532", "title": "Functional electrical stimulation", "text": "Functional electrical stimulation\n\nFunctional electrical stimulation (FES) is a technique that uses low energy electrical pulses to artificially generate body movements in individuals who have been paralyzed due to injury to the central nervous system. More specifically, FES can be used to generate muscle contraction in otherwise paralyzed limbs to produce functions such as grasping, walking, bladder voiding and standing. This technology was originally used to develop neuroprostheses that were implemented to permanently substitute impaired functions in individuals with spinal cord injury (SCI), head injury, stroke and other neurological disorders. In other words, a consumer would use the device each time he/she wanted to generate a desired function. FES is sometimes also referred to as neuromuscular electrical stimulation ^(NMES).\n\nIn recent years FES technology has been used to deliver therapies to retrain voluntary motor functions such as grasping, reaching and walking. In this embodiment, FES is used as a short-term therapy, the objective of which is restoration of voluntary function and not lifelong dependence on the FES device, hence the name functional electrical stimulation therapy, FES therapy (FET or FEST). In other words, the FEST is used as a short-term intervention to help the central nervous system of the consumer to re-learn how to execute impaired functions, instead of making the consumer dependent on neuroprostheses for the rest of her/his life.\n\nNeurons are electrically active cells. In neurons, information is coded and transmitted as a series of electrical impulses called action potentials, which represent a brief change in cell electric potential of approximately 80–90 mV. Nerve signals are frequency modulated; i.e. the number of action potentials that occur in a unit of time is proportional to the intensity of the transmitted signal. Typical action potential frequency is between 4 and 12 Hz. An electrical stimulation can artificially elicit this action potential by changing the electric potential across a nerve cell membrane (this also includes the nerve axon) by inducing electrical charge in the immediate vicinity of the outer membrane of the cell.\n\nFES devices take advantage of this property to electrically activate nerve cells, which then may go on to activate muscles or other nerves. However, special care must be taken in designing safe FES devices, as passing electric current through tissue can lead to adverse effects such as decrease in excitability or cell death. This may be due to thermal damage, electroporation of the cell membrane, toxic products from electrochemical reactions at the electrode surface, or overexcitation of the targeted neutrons or muscles. Typically FES is concerned with stimulation of neurons and nerves. In some applications, FES can be used to directly stimulate muscles, if their peripheral nerves have been severed or damaged (i.e., denervated muscles). However, the majority of the FES systems used today stimulate the nerves or the points where the junction occurs between the nerve and the muscle. The stimulated nerve bundle includes motor nerves (efferent nerves—descending nerves from the central nervous system to muscles) and sensory nerves (afferent nerves—ascending nerves from sensory organs to the central nervous system).\n\nThe electrical charge can stimulate both motor and sensory nerves. In some applications, the nerves are stimulated to generate localized muscle activity, i.e., the stimulation is aimed at generating direct muscle contraction. In other applications, stimulation is used to activate simple or complex reflexes. In other words, the afferent nerves are stimulated to evoke a reflex, which is typically expressed as a coordinated contraction of one or more muscles in response to the sensory nerve stimulation.\n\nWhen a nerve is stimulated, i.e., when sufficient electrical charge is provided to a nerve cell, a localized depolarization of the cell wall occurs resulting in an action potential that propagates toward both ends of the axon. Typically, one \"wave\" of action potentials will propagate along the axon towards the muscle (orthodromic propagation) and concurrently, the other \"wave\" of action potentials will propagate towards the cell body in the central nervous system (antidromic propagation). While the direction of propagation in case of the antidromic stimulation and the sensory nerve stimulation is the same, i.e., towards the central nervous system, their end effects are very different. The antidromic stimulus has been considered an irrelevant side effect of FES. However, in recent years a hypothesis has been presented suggesting the potential role of the antidromic stimulation in neurorehabilitation. Typically, FES is concerned with orthodromic stimulation and uses it to generate coordinated muscle contractions.\n\nIn the case where sensory nerves are stimulated, the reflex arcs are triggered by the stimulation on sensory nerve axons at specific peripheral sites. One example of such a reflex is the flexor withdrawal reflex. The flexor withdrawal reflex occurs naturally when a sudden, painful sensation is applied to the sole of the foot. It results in flexion of the hip, knee and ankle of the affected leg, and extension of the contralateral leg in order to get the foot away from the painful stimulus as quickly as possible. The sensory nerve stimulation can be used to generate desired motor tasks, such as evoking flexor withdrawal reflex to facilitate walking in individuals following stroke, or they can be used to alter reflexes or the function of the central nervous system. In the later case, the electrical stimulation is commonly described by the term \"neuromodulation\".\n\nNerves can be stimulated using either surface (transcutaneous) or subcutaneous (percutaneous or implanted) electrodes. The surface electrodes are placed on the skin surface above the nerve or muscle that needs to be \"activated\". They are noninvasive, easy to apply, and generally inexpensive. Until recently the common belief in the FES field has been that due to the electrode-skin contact impedance, skin and tissue impedance, and current dispersion during stimulation, much higher-intensity pulses are required to stimulate nerves using surface stimulation electrodes as compared to the subcutaneous electrodes.\n\nA major limitation of the transcutaneous electrical stimulation is that some nerves, for example those innervating the hip flexors, are too profound to be stimulated using surface electrodes. This limitation can be partly addressed by using arrays of electrodes, which can use several electrical contacts to increase selectivity.\n\nSubcutaneous electrodes can be divided into percutaneous and implanted electrodes. The percutaneous electrodes consist of thin wires inserted through the skin and into muscular tissue close to the targeted nerve. These electrodes typically remain in place for a short period of time and are only considered for short-term FES interventions. However, it is worth mentioning that some groups, such as Cleveland FES Center, have been able to safely use percutaneous electrodes with individual patients for months and years at a time. One of the drawbacks of using the percutaneous electrodes is that they are prone to infection and special care has to be taken to prevent such events.\n\nThe other class of subcutaneous electrodes is implanted electrodes. These are permanently implanted in the consumer's body and remain in the body for the remainder of the consumer's life. Compared to surface stimulation electrodes, implanted and percutaneous electrodes potentially have higher stimulation selectivity, which is a desired characteristics of FES systems. To achieve higher selectivity while applying lower stimulation amplitudes, it is recommended that both cathode and anode are in the vicinity of the nerve that is stimulated. The drawbacks of the implanted electrodes are they require an invasive surgical procedure to install, and, as is the case with every surgical intervention, there exists a possibility of infection following implantation.\n\nTypical stimulation protocols used in clinical FES involves trains of electric pulses. Biphasic, charged balanced pulses are employed as they improve the safety of electrical stimulation and minimize some of the adverse effects. Pulse duration, pulse amplitude and pulse frequency are the key parameters that are regulated by the FES devices. The FES devices can be current or voltage regulated. Current regulated FES systems always deliver the same charge to the tissue regardless of the skin/tissue resistance. Because of that, the current regulated FES systems do not require frequent adjustments of the stimulation intensity. The voltage regulated devices may require more frequent adjustments of the stimulation intensity as the charge that they deliver changes as the skin/tissue resistance changes. The properties of the stimulation pulse trains and how many channels are used during stimulation define how complex and sophisticated FES-induced function is. The system can be as simple such as FES systems for muscle strengthening or they can be complex such as FES systems used to deliver simultaneous reaching and grasping, or bipedal locomotion.\n\n\"Note: This paragraph was developed in part using material from. For more information on FES please consult that and other references provided in the paragraph.\"\n\nFES was initially referred to as Functional Electrotherapy by Liberson, and it was not until 1967 that the term Functional Electrical Stimulation was coined by Moe and Post, and used in a patent entitled, \"Electrical stimulation of muscle deprived of nervous control with a view of providing muscular contraction and producing a functionally useful moment\". Offner's patent described a system used to treat foot drop.\n\nThe first commercially available FES devices treated foot drop by stimulating the peroneal nerve during gait. In this case, a switch, located in the heel end of a user's shoe, would activate a stimulator worn by the user.\n\nInjuries to the spinal cord interfere with electrical signals between the brain and the muscles, resulting in paralysis below the level of injury. Restoration of limb function as well as regulation of organ function are the main application of FES, although FES is also used for treatment of pain, pressure, sore prevention, etc. Some examples of FES applications involve the use of Neuroprostheses that allow the people with paraplegia to walk, stand, restore hand grasp function in people with quadriplegia, or restore bowel and bladder function. High intensity FES of the quadriceps muscles allows patients with complete lower motor neuron lesion to increase their muscle mass, muscle fiber diameter, improve ultrastructural organization of contractile material, increase of force output during electrical stimulation and perform FES assisted stand-up exercises.\n\nKralj and his colleagues described a technique for paraplegic gait using surface stimulation, which remains the most popular method in use today. Electrodes are placed over the quadriceps muscles and peroneal nerves bilaterally. The user controls the neuroprosthesis with two pushbuttons attached to the left and right handles of a walking frame, or on canes or crutches. When the neuroprosthesis is turned on, both quadriceps muscles are stimulated to provide a standing posture. Electrodes are placed over the quadriceps muscles and peroneal nerves bilaterally. The user controls the neuroprosthesis with two pushbuttons attached to the left and right handles of a walking frame, or on canes or crutches. When the neuroprosthesis is turned on, both quadriceps muscles are stimulated to provide a standing posture. \n\nKralj’s approach was extended by Graupe et al. into a digital FES system that employs the power of digital signal processing to result in the Parastep FES system, based on US Patents 5,014,705 (1991), 5,016,636 (1991), 5,070,873 (1991), 5,081,989 (1992), 5,092,329 (1992) and related foreign patents. The Parastep system became the first FES system for standing and walking to receive the US FDA approval (FDA, PMA P900038, 1994) and become commercially available.\n\nThe Parastep’s digital design allows a considerable reduction in rate of patient-fatigue by drastically reducing of stimulation pulse-width (100-140 microseconds) and pulse-rate (12-24 per sec.), to result, in walking times of 20-60 minutes and average walking distances of 450 meters per walk, for adequately trained thoracic-level complete paraplegics patients who complete training that includes daily treadmill sessions , with some patients exceeding one mile per walk ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AKlSzEwhsg). Also, Parestep-based walking was reported to result in several medical and psychological benefits, including restoration of near-normal blood flow to lower extremities and holding of bone density decline \n\nWalking performance with the Parastep system greatly depends on rigorous upper body conditioning-training and on a completing 3-5 months of a daily one/two hours training program which includes 30 of more minutes of treadmill training .\nAn alternative approach to the above techniques is the FES system for walking developed using the Compex Motion neuroprosthesis. Compex Motion neuroprosthesis for walking is an eight to sixteen channel surface FES system used to restore voluntary walking in stroke and spinal cord injury individuals. This system does not apply peroneal nerve stimulation to enable locomotion. Instead, it activates all relevant lower limb muscles in a sequence similar to the one that brain uses to enable locomotion. The hybrid assistive systems (HAS) and the RGO walking neuroprostheses are devices that also apply active and passive braces, respectively. The braces were introduced to provide additional stability during standing and walking. A major limitation of neuroprostheses for walking that are based on surface stimulation is that the hip flexors cannot be stimulated directly. Therefore, hip flexion during walking must come from voluntary effort, which is often absent in paraplegia, or from the flexor withdrawal reflex. Implanted systems have the advantage of being able to stimulate the hip flexors, and therefore, to provide better muscle selectivity and potentially better gait patterns. Hybrid systems with exoskeleton have been also proposed to solve this problem. These technologies have been found to be successful and promising, but at the present time these FES systems are mostly used for exercise purposes and seldom as an alternative to wheelchair mobility.\n\nIn the acute stage of stroke recovery, the use of cyclic electrical stimulation has been seen to increase the isometric strength of wrist extensors. In order to increase strength of wrist extensors, there must be a degree of motor function at the wrist spared following the stroke and have significant hemiplegia. Patients who will elicit benefits of cyclic electrical stimulation of the wrist extensors must be highly motivated to follow through with treatment, After 8 weeks of electrical stimulation, an increase in grip strength can be apparent. Many scales, which assess the level of disability of the upper extremities following a stroke, use grip strength as a common item. Therefore, increasing strength of wrist extensors will decrease the level of upper extremity disability.\n\nPatients with hemiplegia following a stroke commonly experience shoulder pain and subluxation; both of which will interfere with the rehabilitation process. Functional electrical stimulation has been found to be effective for the management of pain and reduction of shoulder subluxation, as well as accelerating the degree and rate of motor recovery. Furthermore, the benefits of FES are maintained over time; research has demonstrated that the benefits are maintained for at least 24 months.\n\nDrop foot is a common symptom in hemiplegia, characterized by a lack of dorsiflexion during the swing phase of gait, resulting in short, shuffling strides. It has been shown that FES can be used to effectively compensate for the drop foot during the swing phase of the gait. At the moment just before the heel off phase of gait occurs, the stimulator delivers a stimulus to the common peroneal nerve, which results in contraction of the muscles responsible for dorsiflexion. There are currently a number of drop foot stimulators that use surface and implanted FES technologies. Drop foot stimulators have been used successfully with various patient populations, such as stroke, spinal cord injury and multiple sclerosis.\n\nThe term \"orthotic effect\" can be used to describe the immediate improvement in function observed when the individual switches on their FES device compared to unassisted walking. This improvement disappears as soon as the person switches off their FES device. In contrast, a \"training\" or \"therapeutic effect\" is used to describe a long term improvement or restoration of function following a period of using the device which is still present even when the device is switched off. A further complication to measuring an orthotic effect and any long term training or therapeutic effects is the presence of a so-called \"temporary carry over effect\". Liberson et al., 1961 was the first to observe that some stroke patients appeared to benefit from a temporary improvement in function and were able to dorsiflex their foot for up to an hour after the electrical stimulation had been turned off. It has been hypothesised that this temporary improvement in function may be linked to a long term training or therapeutic effect. \n\nHemiparetic stroke patients, who are impacted by the denervation, muscular atrophy, and spasticity, typically experience an abnormal gait pattern due to muscular weakness and the incapacity to voluntary contract certain ankle and hip muscles at the appropriate walking phase. Liberson et al., (1961) were the first to pioneer FES in stroke patients. More recently, there have been a number of studies that have been conducted in this area. A systematic review conducted in 2012 on the use of FES in chronic stroke included seven randomized controlled trials with a total of 231 participants. The review found a small treatment effect for using FES for the 6 minute walking test.\n\nFES has also been found to be useful for treating foot drop in people with multiple sclerosis. The first use was reported in 1977 by Carnstam et al., who found that it was possible to generate strength increases through using peroneal stimulation. A more recent study examined the use of FES compared to an exercise group and found that although there was an orthotic effect for the FES group, no training effect in walking speed was found. Further qualitative analysis including all participants from the same study found improvements in activities of daily living and a reduced number of falls for those using FES compared with exercise. A further small scale (n=32) longitudinal observational study has found evidence for a significant training effect through using FES.\nWith NMES treatment there were measurable gains in ambulatory function.\n\nHowever, a further large observational study (n=187) was supportive of previous findings and found a significant improvement in orthotic effect for walking speed.\n\nFES has been found to be useful for treating the symptoms of cerebral palsy. A recent randomised controlled trial (n=32) found significant orthotic and training effects for children with unilateral spastic cerebral palsy. Improvements were found in gastrocnemius spasticity, community mobility and balance skills. A recent comprehensive literature review of the area of using electrical stimulation and FES to treat children with disabilities mostly included studies on children with cerebral palsy. The reviewers summarised the evidence as the treatment having the potential to improve a number of different areas including muscle mass and strength, spasticity, passive range of motion, upper extremity function, walking speed, positioning of the foot and ankle kinematics. The review further concludes that adverse events were rare and the technology is safe and well tolerated by this population.\n\nNICE have issued full guidelines on the treatment of drop foot of central neurological origin (IPG278). NICE have stated that \"current evidence on the safety and efficacy (in terms of improving gait) of functional electrical stimulation (FES) for drop foot of central neurological origin appears adequate to support the use of this procedure provided that normal arrangements are in place for clinical governance, consent and audit\".\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "8316202", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8316202", "title": "John Duff", "text": "John Duff\n\nJohn Francis Duff (January 17, 1895 – January 8, 1958) was a Canadian racecar driver who won many races and has been inducted in the Canadian Motorsport Hall of Fame. He was one of only two Canadians who raced and won on England’s famous Brooklands Motor Course. The other, Kay Petre, is already an honoured member of the CMHF. Duff was the first Canadian to race in the legendary 24 Hours of Le Mans. To date, he is the only Canadian to win the overall classification at Le Mans.\n\nDuff also held over fifty world records for speed and endurance. Those records were sanctioned by the AIACR, the forerunner of today’s FIA. They included both class and absolute records. His achievements helped make the name of the Bentley car company. Duff scored a top-ten finish in his first Indianapolis 500 and a top-three in his first board track race. Those achievements make him one of the preeminent Canadian automobile racers of the first half of the twentieth century.\n\nJohn Duff was born in Kiukiang, China. His parents were Canadians from Hamilton, Ontario who established a commercial outpost in nearby Kuling. As a boy, the rambunctious young Duff was sent to Hamilton for a good Victorian education. He lived there until he was sixteen. In 1912, Duff was back in Kuling. When war was declared in 1914, he travelled across Russia to England, where he joined the army. Gravely wounded at the Third Battle of Ypres, Duff was sent to a hospital in England where he met and married his nurse. In 1919, John Duff learned how to drive a car and became a dealer. In 1920, he started racing.\n\nIn 1920, Duff began his racing career at Brooklands, a 2.6 mile long concrete track with concave banking. He drove a Fiat S.61, a 10-litre chain-driven car built in 1908. By August 1920, he was lapping in the same range as Henry Segrave, one of the great Brooklands and Grand Prix drivers of the 1920s.\n\nDriving the S.61, Duff won the 75 Long Handicap at Brooklands in May 1921 at a speed of 104.19 mph. He won the 100 Long Handicap at Brooklands’ mid-summer meeting, averaging 104.85 mph. Duff was the fastest on the track for both wins. He also lost a number of races where he was the fastest. As Duff’s driving skills improved, his reputation began to put him at a disadvantage with the handicappers.\n\nIn the off-season, Duff bought another old Fiat, the 18-litre pre-war racer called \"Mephistopheles\". In June, he took both Fiats to the Fanoe beach speed trials in Denmark. Duff set the fastest time of the meeting with a run at 165.9 km/h. He also took a class win with the S.61 at a speed of 149.2 km/h, the third fastest speed of the meeting.\n\nIn 1922, Duff sold the S.61 and focused on making Mephistopheles faster and more reliable. Harry Ricardo made a set of aluminum pistons and raised the engine’s compression ratio. In May, Duff finished third in Brooklands’ 100 Mile Handicap. In its next race, one of the Fiat’s engine blocks detached from the crankcase. When the engine blew, the hood was torn off the car, just missing Duff’s head. Engine parts rained down on the track. Duff sold the car for scrap.\n\n1922 saw the birth of Duff and Aldington, a dealership set up to sell the new Bentley car. Duff raced a Bentley at Brooklands. On August 28, he took a stock 3-litre model to the track where he made an attempt on the \"Double Twelve\" record (24 Hour runs were not allowed at Brooklands due to the noise). The car broke before he could achieve that goal but, in the process, Duff set new Class E world records for 1, 2, and 3 hours, 100 and 200 miles, and 100, 200, 300, and 400 km.\n\nDuff returned to Brooklands on September 27–28, driving both 12 hour shifts singlehanded to take the Double 12 at an average of 86.52 mph, for a total distance of 2,082 miles (3,351 km). He also broke the Class E world records for 1 to 12 hours and all distances from 100 to 1,000 miles and 100 to 1,600 km. In total, he set 38 international class records. The Double 12 record was an absolute record, regardless of class. The event was depicted on the cover picture of the first edition of the \"Brooklands Gazette\", published in July 1924.\n\nAt Brooklands’ autumn meeting, Duff appeared at the wheel of J.L. Dunne’s old 21-litre Blitzen Benz. He lost the 100 Mile Handicap to Parry Thomas, despite lapping at 114.49 mph. Unable to stop the old car at the end of the last lap, Duff shot over the top of the banking, crashing through trees and a telegraph pole outside the circuit before finally coming to rest.\n\nEarly in 1923, Duff learned of a new 24 Hour race to be held at Le Mans. He was the first entrant. W. O. Bentley, the founder and then-owner of Bentley Motors, thought it was madness and that no car would finish. In the face of Duff’s determination, he agreed to have the car prepared at the factory and let his test driver, Frank Clement, partner Duff. The Duff/Clement Bentley was one of the fastest cars, Duff setting the fastest lap at 9 mins 39 sec for the 10.726 mile lap. Rough track conditions took their toll as a flying stone holed the fuel tank, forcing Duff to run back to the pits. As only the drivers could work on the cars, Clement had to bicycle back with a can of gas to power the car back to the pits. Despite the drama, Duff and Clement finished a strong fourth. More importantly, W.O. Bentley, who only went over at the last minute, became hooked on Le Mans, the race that would make his cars famous.\n\nDuff then took his Bentley to the Spanish Touring Car GP at Lasarte. Leading with two laps to go, he was hit in the face by a stone thrown up by a lapped car. Duff crashed into a wall, injuring his jaw and breaking some teeth. Despite that, he won first place in the 3 litre class, as he had easily outlasted and outdistanced his competition. \"In token of his gallant drive Duff was awarded the 3-litre trophy anyway, there being no other finishers in the class.\" \n\nBy 1924, Bentley was now fully committed to Le Mans. Duff was still a private entrant, using one of the dealership’s cars. His car was prepared alongside the works entry using ideas Duff had come up with after the 1923 race. Partnered by Clement, in a race run in intense heat, Duff won handily, giving Bentley its first victory at Le Mans. In 1925, a carburetor fire ended Duff’s chances at Le Mans.\n\nOn September 9–10, 1925, Duff went to the high-banked Montlhéry track, near Paris, for an attempt at the absolute 24 Hour Record. He had a special single-seater Weymann body on his Bentley and works driver Dudley Benjafield as his co-driver. In driving rain, they did the first 12 hours at 97.7 mph but missed the 12 hour record. At 18 ½ hours, the camshaft drive failed, ending the attempt. He was able to claim two world records: 1,000 Kilometres in 6 hrs, 23 mins, 55 secs and 1,000 miles in 10 hrs 15 mins 59secs. On September 21, Duff returned to Montlhéry with Woolf Barnato as his co-driver. Driving on a damp track in heavy mist, they covered 2,280 miles in 24 hours, averaging 95.02 mph. They beat the previous record, held by the 9-litre Renault of Garfield and Plessier, by over 7 mph. Along the way, the 3-litre Bentley took 21 world records, including those for six and twelve hours, and 500, 1000, and 2000 miles.\n\nLooking for new challenges, Duff went to America in February 1926. He signed to drive a Miller sponsored by the Elcar Automobile Company in the Indianapolis 500, following the death of Herbert Jones, who was killed attempting to qualify for the race in the Elcar Special. In a race shortened to 400 miles by rain, Duff finished 9th. The next AAA championship event was on the 1.25 mile board track at Altoona, Pennsylvania on June 12. Duff finished 3rd in the 250 mile race, two laps down. The next race was on the Rockingham board track in Salem, New Hampshire. A puncture pitched Duff’s car sideways, throwing him from the car. \"John Duff of Indianapolis, Ind., wrecked his machine and suffered a broken collar bone when his car crashed through the top rail and dropped clear of the track.\" Duff suffered painful bone and muscle injuries, and a concussion that affected his vision. Knowing that his competitiveness would be compromised, and having promised his wife that he would quit if he suffered another serious injury, Duff retired from racing.\n\nAfter the accident, Duff brought his family over from England. They settled in Santa Monica, near Los Angeles. Duff opened a fencing academy where he trained many of the movie stars of the day. He doubled for his friend Gary Cooper and others in swordfighting scenes in Hollywood films. He also taught fencing at UCLA. In 1932, he coached some of his students on the U.S. Olympic team. When the Depression led to a decline in the demand for fencing instruction, Duff moved his family to China. The Duff family’s settlement at Kuling had prospered over the years and turned into a thriving resort. They stayed in China from 1932 to 1934, when they moved back to England. In January 1935 he became a member of the British Racing Drivers' Club. Duff continued to be a successful swordsman into the late 1930s. He also did well in business. The money he made allowed him to indulge his passion for horses. He became a competitive steeplechaser and show jumper. John Duff died in a riding accident in Epping Forest on January 8, 1958.\n\nJohn Duff was born in China in 1895. Like everyone else in the British Empire, Canadians were subjects of the reigning monarch, not citizens of any country. If there had been Canadian citizenship, Duff would have qualified via his Canadian parents. John Duff can be found on the Canadian Census for both 1901 and 1911. There was a category for \"Nationality\". In both cases, Duff’s was listed as Canadian. When John Duff started racing in 1920, he had lived a significant part of his life in Canada. Although there was no Canadian citizenship until 1947, Canada had issued its own passports since the 1860s. As late as 1932, John Duff carried a Canadian passport — which means that he carried one throughout his racing career. In a newspaper interview given after his last crash, Duff was clear about his Canadian origins. Finally, and most conclusively, John Duff’s eldest son and daughter have no doubt that their father was a Canadian.\n\n"}

They were formerly often treated in Hamamelidaceae. They are decorative deciduous trees that are used in the wood industry and for ornamental purposes.\n\nBoth the scientific and common names refer to the sweet resinous sap (\"liquid amber\") exuded by the trunk when cut.\n\n\nThey are all large, deciduous trees, tall, with palmately 3- to 7-lobed leaves arranged spirally on the stems and length of , having a pleasant aroma when crushed. Their leaves can be many colors such as bright red, Orange and yellow. Mature bark is grayish and vertically grooved. The flowers are small, produced in a dense globular inflorescence diameter, pendulous on a stem. The fruit is a woody multiple capsule in diameter (popularly called a \"gumball\"), containing numerous seeds and covered in numerous prickly, woody armatures, possibly to attach to fur of animals. The woody biomass is classified as hardwood.\nIn more northerly climates, sweetgum is among the last of trees to leaf out in the spring, and also among the last of trees to drop its leaves in the fall, turning multiple colors. Fall colors are most brilliant where autumn nights are chilly, but some cultivars color well in warm climates. Although a temperate species, at least one living Liquidambar tree survives in a hot and humid tropical city: Bangkok, Thailand.\n\nSpecies within this genus are widespread in China, Korea, Thailand, Taiwan, Laos, Vietnam, Turkey, Rhodes, North America and Mexico up to Honduras). In cultivation they can be seen in warm temperate and subtropical climates around the world.\n\nThis genus is known in the fossil record from the Cretaceous to the Quaternary (age range: 99.7 to 0.781 million years ago). The genus was much more widespread in the Tertiary, but has disappeared from Europe due to extensive glaciation in the north and the east-west oriented Alps and Pyrenees, which have served as a blockade against southward migration. It has also disappeared from western North America due to climate change, and also from the unglaciated (but nowadays too cold) Russian Far East. There are several fossil species of \"Liquidambar\", showing its relict status today.\n\nThe wood is used for furniture, interior finish, paper pulp, veneers and baskets of all kinds. The heartwood once was used in furniture, sometimes as imitation mahogany or Circassian walnut. It is used widely today in flake and strand boards. Sweetgum is a foodplant for various Lepidoptera caterpillars, such as the gypsy moth. The American sweetgum is widely planted as an ornamental, within its natural range and elsewhere.\n\nThe hardened sap, or gum resin, excreted from the wounds of the sweetgum, for example, the American sweetgum (\"Liquidambar styraciflua\"), can be chewed on like chewing gum and has been long used for this purpose in the Southern United States. The sap was also believed to be a cure for sciatica, weakness of nerves, etc.\n\nIn Chinese herbal medicine, \"lu lu tong\", or \"all roads open,\" is the hard, spiky fruit of native sweetgum species. It first appeared in the medical literature in \"Omissions from the Materia Medica,\" by Chen Cangqi, in 720 AD. Bitter in taste, aromatic, and neutral in temperature, \"lu lu tong\" is claimed to promote the movement of blood and qi, water metabolism and urination, expels wind, and unblocks the channels. It is an ingredient in formulas for epigastric distention or abdominal pain, anemia, irregular or scanty menstruation, low back or knee pain and stiffness, edema with difficult urination, or nasal congestion.\n\nThe trees drop their hard, spiky seedpods in the fall by the hundreds, and these can become a serious nuisance on pavements and lawns. Some cities have expedited permitting for removal of liquidambar trees.\n\n"}
{"id": "4845813", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4845813", "title": "Love (2011 film)", "text": "Love (2011 film)\n\nLove is a 2011 science fiction drama film produced and scored by the alternative rock band Angels & Airwaves. The film is the directorial debut of filmmaker William Eubank. The film's world premiere took place on February 2, 2011 at the 26th Annual Santa Barbara International Film Festival and the film was later featured in the Seattle International Film Festival, FanTasia 2011, and a number of other festivals around the world. The film was screened in 460 theatres across the United States on August 10, 2011, in the Love Live event.\n\n\"Love\" portrays the personal-psychological effects of isolation and loneliness when an astronaut becomes stranded in space and through this, emphasizes the importance of human connection and love. Additionally, it touches on the fragility of humanity's existence (explored through a dying Earth-apocalyptic doomsday scenario) inspired by the cautions of Carl Sagan in \"Pale Blue Dot\" and considers the importance of memories and stories as humanity's legacy.\n\nDuring an 1864 battle of the American Civil War, a lone Union soldier, Captain Lee Briggs (Bradley Horne), is dispatched on a mission to investigate a mysterious object reported to Union forces. He leaves to venture on the mission.\n\n175 years later, in the year 2039, United States Astronaut Lee Miller (Gunner Wright) is sent to the International Space Station (ISS) as a one-man skeleton crew to examine if it is safe for use and to perform necessary modifications after it had been abandoned two decades earlier for reasons unknown. Shortly after arriving on board, tumultuous events break out on Earth, eventually resulting in Miller losing contact with CAPCOM and finding himself stranded in orbit alone, forced to helplessly watch events on Earth from portholes 200 miles above his home planet. Miller struggles to maintain his sanity while in isolation by interacting with Polaroid pictures of former ISS crew members left aboard the ship.\n\nWhen the station has some power glitches, Miller journeys into an unpressurised module of the space station to perform repairs and discovers the 1864 journal of Briggs. Miller reads Briggs's account of the war and becomes enthralled by the mysterious object he is searching for, not realizing he will soon become more familiar with the very same object, and not by accident.\n\nIn 2045, six years after losing contact with CAPCOM and with a failing oxygen system inside the ISS, Miller puts on a space suit and goes for a spacewalk, deciding that it would be easier for him to detach his tether and slowly drift towards Earth and to burn in the atmosphere than slowly suffocate to death on board the ISS. He finds, however, that he is unable to go through with his suicide.\n\nMiller is seen still aboard the ISS, presumably much later: his hair has grown extremely long, and he is extensively tattooed. He has drawn sketches of people and battles of the Civil War from the journal all over the interior of the ISS. The cramped quarters of the space station have become a rat's nest symbolic of his diminished sanity. He then seems to be contacted from outside the ISS, and to receive instructions to dock and transfer over. He does so, and seems to arrive in a giant uninhabited structure of distinctly human making. It is unclear whether this is reality or imagined by Miller, who is now insane.\n\nMiller wanders around until he happens upon a server mainframe where he finds a book titled \"'A Love Story' As Told by 'You'\". Inside this book, he finds pictures of Captain Lee Briggs with his discovery, a gigantic cube-like alien object that may have helped advance Human society. In the index of the book, Miller finds a reference to himself and types it into the computer prompt. He then finds himself inside a generic hotel room, where a disembodied voice says:\n\nDuring the speech, we see the same cube-like object in space in the year 2045. The viewer is left to assume that this object has 'obtained' Lee Miller and is speaking directly to him. The film ends with the voice of a computer speaking of human connections and love.\n\nReviewers have also noted the production design, with the space-station set reportedly being built in William Eubank's parents' backyard. In a making-of video uploaded to his Vimeo account, Eubank details the construction of the set and lists materials such as packing quilts, MDF, pizza bags, velcro, insulation, Christmas lights, and other salvaged material as components to the ISS set. According to Tom DeLonge, the production was going to rent the space station from another movie but instead opted to construct it from salvaged materials for budget reasons.\n\nEarly teasers were released in 2007 and 2009. On January 10, 2011, the film's final trailer was released on Apple Trailers. The release of this trailer saw coverage on several industry websites. Based on the style choices seen in the film's trailer, reviewers have mentioned similarities to \"\", \"Moon\", and \"Solaris\".\n\nThe film's world premiere took place on February 2, 2011 at the 26th Annual Santa Barbara International Film Festival, with additional screenings on February 3, 4 and 5 at the Metro 4 and Arlington Theater. The film was screened for free on February 11 at the Riviera Theatre in Santa Barbara as one of eleven films chosen as \"Best of the Fest\".\n\nThe 2011 Seattle International Film Festival featured \"Love\" in both their Sci-Fi and Beyond Pathway and their New American Cinema program. The film played on May 21 at the Pacific Place Theatre and May 22 at the SIFF Cinema. The film played a third time, June 11, at the Egyptian Theatre.\n\n\"Love\" was accepted into the 2011 Fantasia International Film Festival held in Montreal, Quebec. Its FanTasia screening on July 18 in Hall Theatre, as part of the festival's Camera Lucida Section, marked the film's international premiere. The film also screened in Athens, Lund, London, Nantes, South Korea, Spain, Israel, and elsewhere.\n\n\"Love\" was shown nationwide on August 10, 2011.\n\nAngels & Airwaves released a box set containing the film \"Love\", the soundtrack to the film, \"Love Part I\", and the band's fourth studio album \"Love Part II\" on November 8, 2011.\n\nAt the Santa Barbara International Film Festival, the film was originally slotted three showings but two additional showings in the Arlington Theatre were added after some original showings sold-out.\n\nDennis Harvey, for Los Angeles-based magazine \"Variety\", wrote \"[The film's] spiritual abstruseness and the script's myriad other ambiguities might infuriate in a film less ingeniously designed on more tangible fronts. But \"Love\" delights with the detail of its primary set as well as in accomplished effects, consistently interesting yet subservient soundtrack textures (the sole original song is reserved for the closing-credit crawl) and a brisk editorial pace…\"\n\nDustin Hucks, for Ain't It Cool News, wrote \"\"Love\" can at times get very broad with scenes, dialogue, and flow… if you're keen on clarity and the linear, \"Love\" is going to leave you frustrated. For others, however–the challenge of understanding what is what may lead to a desire for repeat viewings, which for me – is a lot of fun… This is a film that's clearly not for everyone – but has a lot to offer the \"Inception\" and \"Moon\" crowds.\"\n\nHucks continued to say \"Love\" was one of the most visually exciting low-budget films he'd seen in some time and concluded with an overall endorsement: \"\"Love\" is well worth seeking out in theaters – but don't miss it on DVD if you don't get the opportunity to view it in theaters.\"\n\n\n"}

It was planned as a three-day extended mission, to launch in late 1963; the spacecraft, Freedom 7-II, would have been flown by Alan Shepard, a veteran of the suborbital Mercury-Redstone 3 mission in 1961. However, it was cancelled after the success of the one-day Mercury-Atlas 9 mission in May 1963, to allow NASA to focus its efforts on the more advanced two-man Gemini program.\n\nScheduling for the MA-10 mission began as early as mid-1961, before a single orbital flight had been flown. It was planned as a one-day orbital mission, using Spacecraft #15 and Atlas booster 144D. The - by now heavily modified - spacecraft #15A was delivered to Cape Canaveral on 16 November 1962, renumbered #15B in January 1963, and prepared for use as a backup spacecraft for MA-9; by this stage, NASA was noncomittal about whether or not a fifth orbital flight would be flown.\n\nShortly after the Mercury-Atlas 8 flight in October 1962, some commentators speculated on the possibility of MA-10 being flown as a \"dual mission\". In this approach, MA-10 and a new MA-11 flight, the latter using the MA-10 backup capsule, would be launched in close proximity, and fly a loosely co-ordinated mission, similar to the Soviet Vostok 3 and Vostok 4.\n\nWhile in late 1962 the MA-10 mission had still been planned as a nominal one-day flight, as of early 1963, the tentative plan for the MA-10 mission anticipated it being around three days long. The mission was to be flown by Alan Shepard, the backup pilot for MA-9, then in preparation, and previously the pilot of the Mercury-Redstone 3 suborbital mission in 1961. In a nod to his earlier spacecraft, Shepard named #15B \"Freedom 7-II\".\n\nThe mission would have carried a re-entry communications experiment, which involved injecting water into the plasma sheath surrounding the spacecraft on reentry, in the hope that it would disrupt the sheath enough to allow radio communications; this was later flown on Gemini 3.\n\nThe backup astronaut for Shepard is unclear, but most likely would have been Gordon Cooper, as he was the only other astronaut who had not left the program entirely by mid-1963 or had moved to Gemini.\n\nBy April, NASA had begun referring to MA-9 as the \"culmination\" of the program, and on 11 May NASA declared publicly that it was \"absolutely beyond question\" that a successful MA-9 flight would mean no MA-10. During the MA-9 postflight press conference on 19 May, Robert C. Seamans was asked about the possibility of a fifth orbital flight, and described it as \"quite unlikely\". President Kennedy, when asked a similar question three days later, demurred, saying that the decision was one for NASA to make.\n\nA meeting on 6 and 7 June debated carrying on to the MA-10 flight - or possibly beyond. The main argument put forward was that it would gain usable information for the Gemini and Apollo missions without needing a great deal of investment; the spacecraft and launch vehicles were available and almost ready for flight. Pressure had come from a more directly involved constituency as well; both NASA officials and the President himself had been lobbied by the \"Mercury Seven\" astronauts for a seventh Mercury mission.\n\nWork continued on modifying Spacecraft #15B until 8 June, but on 12 June, the NASA Administrator, James E. Webb, stated publicly to the Senate Space Committee that there would be no further Mercury flights. All work ceased on the program, with personnel and resources reassigned to the Gemini and Apollo programs.\n\nBy the summer of 1963, it was obvious that continuing Mercury would sap resources needed for Gemini and Apollo. Despite the ambitious experiments planned for later Mercury missions, they would have run up against the tight payload capacity limits of the capsule and Atlas vehicle. The consumables needed for a three-day Mercury flight alone would have added 100 pounds (136 kilograms) of additional weight. In addition, the large number of malfunctions that occurred on Faith 7's flight drove home the fact that Mercury's hardware wasn't robust enough to stand a day-long mission, let alone multi-day. NASA officials disliked the lengthy gap between manned missions that would result from this decision, and the first manned Gemini mission ended up taking place in March 1965, twenty-two months after the end of Mercury and an even longer amount of time than originally expected.\n\nFour Atlas boosters and Mercury capsules were in a state of partial completion when Mercury was cancelled. Although there was talk of using the leftover Atlases to launch Agena target vehicles for Gemini, the program's funding was eventually increased enough that NASA could afford to buy brand-new Atlases using the newer SLV-3 core.\n\nThe capsule was placed in storage, then later displayed at the Ames Research Center in California; it is now on display at the Smithsonian's Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center in Chantilly, Virginia.\n\n\n\n"}

It is the first prosthesis to feature an electronically actuated thumb which mimics natural human hand movements. The Michelangelo Hand can be used for a variety of delicate everyday tasks, was first fitted to an Austrian elective-amputee in July 2010 and has been in use by military and civilian amputees in the United States and United Kingdom since 2011.\n\nThe Michelangelo Hand's development was begun by the German prosthetics manufacturer Ottobock. In 2008, the American company Advanced Arm Dynamics became involved with testing and further refinement of the prosthesis.\n\nThe prosthesis is battery-powered and can be used for up to 20 hours between charges. Constructed of metal and plastic, it is designed with a natural, anthropomorphic aesthetic, and can be custom-fitted for each user. Its motions are controlled by built-in electrodes, which detect the movements of the user's remaining arm muscles and interpret them using electromyography software. The fingers can form numerous naturalistic configurations to hold, grip or pinch objects. The Michelangelo Hand is capable of moving with enough precision to conduct delicate tasks such as cooking, ironing and opening a toothpaste tube, but can also exert enough strength to use an automobile's steering wheel. Skin-toned cosmetic gloves are also available for the prosthesis. In 2013, the Michelangelo Hand had a unit cost of around £47,000 (US$73,800).\n\nAustrian electrician Patrick Mayrhofer suffered serious injuries to his hands at the age of 20 when he touched a 6000-volt power line in February 2008. After unsuccessful attempts to reconstruct his left hand, it was amputated below the elbow in July 2010 and he became the first patient in the world to be fitted with a Michelangelo Hand. He joined Ottobock 3 years later, helping their customers learn to use their prostheses. Having started para-snowboarding in 2012, Mayrhofer was named Paralympic Austrian Sports Personality of the Year after winning a gold medal in banked slalom at the 2015 Para-Snowboard World Championships He went on to win the Paralympic silver medal in banked slalom at the 2018 Winter Olympics.\n\nNumerous American soldiers who suffered limb amputation in combat have received Michelangelo Hands since 2011. In January 2012, Matt Rezink of Wisconsin became the first American civilian to receive a unit. In January 2013, Chris Taylor, a British service engineer who had lost his right hand in a jet ski accident in 2009, became the first UK citizen to be fitted with a Michelangelo Hand. By 2013, the hand was offered by several British prosthetic services companies, including Dorset Orthopaedic.\n\n\n"}

When he was 13, his parents moved to Cole County, Missouri. Two years later, they moved again to Jefferson City, which Parsons would thereafter make his home. As a young man, Mosby read law and was admitted to the bar in 1846. He served as a volunteer in the Mexican-American War with the rank of captain in Colonel Alexander W. Doniphan's regiment and was cited for gallantry at the Battle of Sacramento on February 28, 1847. Returning to Missouri after the war, he married Mary Wells on September 18, 1850. However, his wife died just three years later, leaving him with an infant son, Stephen Kearney Parsons.\n\nParsons served as the United States District Attorney for western Missouri. In 1856 was elected to the state legislature. He became a state senator in 1858, serving until the Civil War began in early 1861.\n\nDuring the secession crisis in Missouri, Parsons was appointed brigadier general in command of the Sixth Division of the Missouri State Guard. He arrived too late to participate in the skirmish at Boonville, but he went on to lead his division at Carthage and the Battle of Wilson's Creek in Missouri. Although his Missouri State Guardsmen participated in the Battle of Pea Ridge in Arkansas, Parsons was absent from this action seeking an appointment into the Confederate Army in Richmond, Virginia.\n\nParsons was commissioned a brigadier general of the Confederacy on November 5, 1862 and led his infantry brigade in the Battle of Prairie Grove, Arkansas one month later.

She lived in Hanwell, west London, with her sister, Nina Gross, and parents, Jose Gross and Rosalind Hodgkiss. She went missing after leaving her home in Hanwell on 28 August 2014. The search for her was the largest deployment of Metropolitan Police officers in a search operation since the 7 July 2005 London bombings.<ref name=\"Sky 7/7\"></ref> It involved 600 officers from eight forces.

Glick's murder was a shock to the Twin Cities community, and his death and the subsequent court proceedings of his murderers received widespread attention in the Twin Cities press.\n\nBrian Glick was born on April 25, 1972, in Duluth, Minnesota. He grew up in Minneapolis. His parents were divorced in 1978. His family moved to Bloomington and in 1990 Glick graduated from Bloomington Kennedy High School. In 1992 he began working at a Subway store on Old Shakopee Road East, a block away from where he lived with his mother, stepfather and teenage sister, Tammy. At the time of his death Glick had been working to save enough money to marry his fiancée Katie Long. Glick was interested in aviation, but his plans to become an aircraft mechanic were thwarted when it was discovered that he was color-blind. Instead, Glick returned to school and completed the necessary course work to become a paramedic.\n\nIn the year before his death, it was discovered that Glick had a large benign brain tumor, and in May 1992 he underwent surgery to have it removed. At the time of his death Glick was still recovering, but his prognosis was positive. However, the operation that saved his life contributed to his death. Shortly after surgery Glick returned to work at Subway. On the last day his boss saw him he commented \"You're really bouncing around here tonight. You really look good.\" Glick responded that he was feeling the best he had since the surgery and he was going to make it.\n\nOn the night of Monday October 25, 1993, Glick was working alone at the Subway shop. He spoke with his fiancée by telephone around 11 p.m., and fifteen minutes later, at around 11:15 p.m., went out back to empty the trash. Glick was unaware that Dennis Tate (b. 04/27/1977), 16, and Michael William Olson (b. 03/05/1974), 19, were waiting for him behind the store. Olson was a former employee at the store, but had been fired, and knew both Glick and the layout of the store. As Glick headed back into the shop after emptying the trash, Tate and Olson jumped him and brutally choked and beat him until he was unrecognizable. The two then entered the store, vandalized surveillance cameras, and stole a cashbox containing $152. \nGlick's fiancée went to the store about 11:30 p.m. to pick him up. When she found the store empty she called police, who arrived shortly before midnight. Glick was found behind the store and immediately taken by ambulance to Hennepin County Medical Center. \nGlick died at 4:50 a.m. Tuesday, October 26, 1993, with his parents at his bedside. Doctors noted that a piece of skull that was healing from the recent brain tumor operation had been pushed up and back into his brain, contributing to Glick's death.\n\nMichael Olson was arrested on October 27 after police found a bloody shirt at his home. Dennis Tate was apprehended the following day. The two confessed to killing Glick, and told the police that they had intended to double the money stolen with the purchase and sale of drugs - a plan that went awry when they were ripped off by a drug dealer.\n\nOlson and Tate pleaded guilty in a Hennepin County District Court. Olson's proceedings were overseen by Judge Kevin Burke. Olson was sentenced in March 1994 to 27 years and two months in prison for second-degree murder. Glick's father, Stephen; mother; and fiancée provided victim statements at the proceedings. At Olson's sentencing Glick's father said: \n\nTate's proceedings took over a year because his defense argued he was not yet sixteen years old, even though a birth certificate showed he was born over sixteen years ago, and therefore he could not be tried as an adult. The motion was denied by the judge, but Tate's team appealed the conviction all the way to Minnesota Supreme Court, which denied Tate's petition. Tate was ordered to stand trial as an adult, but he pleaded guilty to second-degree murder. In January 1995, Tate was sentenced to 25½ years in prison by Judge John M. Stanoch. At Tate's sentencing, Minneapolis Imam Matthew Ramadan spoke on Tate's behalf and stated Tate's fate was \"the same situation of so many other African-American males. I expect the courts to\njudge him more harshly because he killed a white man. Justice is not blind.\" Glick's exasperated mother was quoted in the Star Tribune saying, \"I'm the one who lost a son. Why did he [Ramadan] try to turn it into a racial thing?\"\n\nWhile in prison, Tate changed his name to Mujahid Ghazi Muhammad. He was released from prison under supervised custody in a work release program in Ramsey County in 2010.\nIn 2011 Olson was released from prison under supervised custody in a work release program in Hennepin County.\n\n"}
{"id": "460821", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=460821", "title": "Murder of Polly Klaas", "text": "Murder of Polly Klaas\n\nPolly Hannah Klaas (January 3, 1981 – October 1, 1993) was an American murder victim whose case gained national attention. On October 1, 1993, at the age of twelve, she was kidnapped at knife point during a slumber party from her mother's home in Petaluma, California. She was later strangled. Richard Allen Davis was convicted of her murder in 1996 and sentenced to death.\n\nOn October 1, 1993, Polly Klaas and two friends were having a slumber party. Late in the evening, Richard Allen Davis entered their bedroom, carrying a knife. He tied both friends up, pulled pillowcases over their heads and told them to count to 1,000. He then kidnapped Klaas.\n\nOver the next two months, about 4,000 people helped search for Klaas. TV shows such as \"20/20\" and \"America's Most Wanted\" covered the kidnapping. An APB (all-points bulletin) with the suspect's information was broadcast within 30 minutes of the kidnapping. The broadcast, however, only went out over Sonoma County Sheriff's Channel 1.\n\nIn a rural area of Santa Rosa, about 20 miles north of Petaluma, a babysitter on her way home noted a suspicious vehicle stuck in a ditch on her employer's private driveway. She phoned the property owner, who decided to leave with her daughter. As she drove down the long driveway to Pythian Road, the owner passed Davis. She called 911 when she got to a service station and two deputies were dispatched on the call. The deputies did not know of the kidnapping or the suspect's description, due to Sonoma Valley units being on Channel 3. The deputies ran Davis' driver's license and license plate number, but they came back with no wants or warrants. The deputies tried to convince the property owner to perform a citizen's arrest for trespassing. Under California law, a citizen may make an arrest for this type of misdemeanor. The property owner would have had to go to the car with the deputies and say \"I arrest you.\" The deputies then would have taken Davis into custody. The property owner refused.\n\nThe deputies called for a tow truck to get Davis' car out of the ditch. They searched it thoroughly before the arrival of the tow truck and did not find evidence of anyone else in the car. The only possible violation was an open container of beer, but Davis was not driving at the time of the deputies' contact and mere possession of an open container was not illegal. Before Davis was allowed to leave, he was instructed to pour out the beer and the deputies filled out an FI (Field Interrogation) card with his information and the FI card was filed.\n\nOn November 28, 1993, the property owner was inspecting her property after loggers had partially cleared the property of trees. She discovered items that made her think they might have matched those used in the kidnapping. She called the sheriff's department to report her discovery, and deputies and crime scene investigators were dispatched. One of the items found, a torn pair of ballet leggings, was matched by the FBI Crime Laboratory to the other part of the leggings that were taken as evidence on the night of the kidnapping. A review of calls in the area the day of the kidnapping turned up the contact with Davis, who had only been identified because both deputies had filled out and filed the FI card. Once the identity of Davis was revealed, his palm print at the scene of the kidnapping was also traced to him. Authorities had been unable to match the partial print earlier due to the poor quality of the print.\n\nThe Sonoma County Sheriff's Department, in cooperation with Petaluma Police and the FBI, launched a search of the property and the Pythian Road area during a heavy rainstorm. The first two days of the search were kept as low-key as possible, since Davis was under surveillance at an Indian rancheria near Ukiah, California. When nothing was found during the initial search and the surveillance of Davis also produced no results, the decision was made to arrest him for the kidnapping of Klaas.\n\nWhile Davis was being interrogated by Petaluma PD and the FBI, a massive search was launched on Friday, December 3. The Sonoma County Sheriff's Department was assisted by over 500 search team members from 24 agencies, coming from as far away as Kern County, California and Washoe County, Nevada. The mutual aid effort was coordinated by the California State Office of Emergency Services (now known as the California Governor's Office of Emergency Services), FBI Crime Scene teams and numerous other state and federal agencies. The search remains today as one of the largest ever conducted in California. The search continued through Saturday, December 4. The search effort produced other items of evidence, but did not produce any evidence of human remains. The search was planned to continue on Sunday, December 5, but on the evening of December 4, Davis confessed to kidnapping and murdering Klaas and led investigators to her body. He had buried her in a shallow grave just off Highway 101, about a mile south of the city limits of Cloverdale, California. The grave site is about 20 air miles and about 30 road miles from the search site.\n\nAlthough Davis admitted to strangling Klaas to death, he refused to give investigators a timeline of the events from October 1. Investigators thought he was fearful that both people who passed him would call the sheriff's department. It is believed that he killed her before the arrival of deputies and hid her body in the thick brush on the hillside above where his car was stuck. He then waited for an undetermined period of time after being escorted back to Highway 12, about 1.5 miles from where his car was stuck and drove back up to retrieve her body. He was reportedly out of breath, sweating profusely (despite being a cool night) and had twigs and leaves in his hair when contacted by deputies. It is also believed that he had chosen the grave site in advance, since it would not have been discovered by a casual observer. The gravesite area would be directly visible from Highway 101, but not the grave itself. He had to drive from the Indian Rancheria in Ukiah once a week to meet with his parole officer and he would have seen any police activity in the area.\n\nAfter a long, tumultuous trial, Davis was convicted on June 18, 1996, of first-degree murder and four special circumstances (robbery, burglary, kidnapping and a lewd act on a child) in Klaas' death. A San Jose Superior Court jury returned a verdict of death. At his formal sentencing by a judge, Davis provoked national outrage by taunting his victim's family, extending both middle fingers at a courtroom camera and later saying that Klaas' last words just before he killed her were that her father molested her. Judge Thomas Hastings sentenced Davis to death by lethal injection and remarked, \"It is very easy for me to pronounce this sentence, given your revolting behavior in this courtroom\".\n\nDavis is currently on death row at San Quentin State Prison, in Marin County, California. Having survived an apparent drug overdose while in prison and attacks on him by several other prisoners, Davis is now in solitary confinement and continues to assist his attorneys in various appeals, and has more appeals ahead of him before the sentence passed can be carried out.\n\nActress Winona Ryder, who had been raised in Petaluma, offered a $200,000 reward for Klaas' safe return during the search. After her death, Ryder starred in a film version of \"Little Women\" and dedicated it to her memory, because that had been her favorite book.\n\nKlaas' body was cremated and her ashes spread over the Pacific Ocean by her friends and family.\n\nIn the wake of the murder, Klaas' father, Marc Klaas, became a child advocate and established the KlaasKids Foundation. He has made himself available to parents of kidnapped children and has appeared frequently on \"Larry King Live\", \"CNN Headline News\" and \"Nancy Grace\". He is also portrayed in \"The Elizabeth Smart Story\" by Barry Flatman, as meeting the Smarts and informing them he was working with Fox News.\n\nThe all points bulletin was broadcast on the CHP (California Highway Patrol) channel, which only CHP radios could receive. CHP practice changed after the case. The radio system was upgraded and such bulletins are now broadcast on all police channels through a centralized 911 dispatch system.\n\nFive years after Klaas' murder, a performing arts center was named in her honor in Petaluma.\n\nIn the wake of the murder, politicians in California and other U.S. states supported three strikes laws and California's Three Strikes act was signed into law on March 8, 1994.\n\nInvestigation Discovery re-enacted the kidnapping and murder in \"Motives & Murder: Cracking the Case: Who Took Polly Klaas?\" (Season 3 Episode 2, 2014).\n\nThe A&E television series \"American Justice\" released the episode \"Free to Kill -- The Polly Klaas Murder\". The episode exposes the challenges of the penal system to rehabilitate inmates. Davis had been in and out of jail, his convictions ranging from kidnapping to burglary. The episode originally aired October 23, 1996.\n\nThe Discovery Channel crime series \"The FBI Files\"' first episode's topic was the Polly Klaas case. The episode reveals the details of the FBI agents' collection of evidence and their hunt for the criminal, and originally aired October 20, 1998.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2615613", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2615613", "title": "Noble Ape", "text": "Noble Ape\n\nNoble Ape is an artificial life development project launched in June, 1996 by Tom Barbalet. It was designed to be a forum for a diversity of contributors to work towards a coherent cognitive simulation development environment.\n\nThe central software of the project is the Noble Ape Simulation, based on the ideas outlined in Noble Ape Philosophic. There are two primary aims of the Simulation;\n\nThe Noble Apes move around and react to external and internal events (weather, fear, panic, sleep, ...). Noble Ape integrates many concepts in the areas of philosophy, biology and physics.\n\nNoble Ape is available as open source software, under the Noble Ape Open Source License, and is distributed with Apple Computer's CHUD Tools, included with every new Apple Macintosh computer and is used by Intel. It runs under Mac, Windows, and Unix platforms.\n\nThe graphics engine in the Noble Ape Simulation, codenamed Ocelot, is a non-polygonal engine, which allows smooth and quick rendering of land and water surfaces.\n\nThe Noble Ape Simulation also contains the programming language, ApeScript.\n\nNoble Ape also features a podcast, Ape Reality, where various aspects of the programming, biology, philosophy and meta-theory behind the development are discussed.\n\nNoble Ape received a grant from the Australian Film Commission in 1998. Barbalet used this money to buy computer hardware and record an audio CD/CDROM, \"Isle of the Apes\". Having returned from the US at the end of 1998, Barbalet recorded the second CD/CDROM, \"Mind Monkeys and Purrfect Beats\" (sic). A collection of tracks from these CDs were released on the 2018 digital compilation \"Noble Ape: Project Music\". In mid-2018, Barbalet released the single \"June 13 (This is Noble Ape)\" to address some of the challenges the development has experienced over twenty two years.\n\nTo celebrate twenty-two years of continuous development, Barbalet undertook an at-least a video per day vlog project documenting many different aspects of Noble Ape that had not been previously talked about. Barbalet noted that the reason to do this on YouTube and Instagram was to introduce a new audience to his work.\n\nNoble Ape provided the core of six different sub-projects that had been developed by Barbalet and others through the Noble Ape development history. These six sub-projects are actively maintained under the Noble Ape development.\n\nNoble Warfare was developed by Barbalet in Wilmslow in Cheshire. Inspired by Lindow Man, Barbalet reflected on the impact unwritten wars had through history on a local population. He was also inspired by the Total War (series) of video games. Noble Warfare pits two armies defined through an ApeScript-like interface and shows how the resolution of the battles can be covered by many different probabilistic outcomes.\n\nThe early development of the Mushroom Boy came from Barbalet's time in Canberra, Australia. The simulation is based in a vast suburb-based landscape and uses a number of core technologies in Noble Ape to create the environment and the entities that wander through the suburban environment. The name comes from an urban terrorism simulation Barbalet initially developed with the sub-project.\n\nPlanet Noble Ape was initially developed by Barbalet in Sunnyvale, California. It provides the Noble Ape Simulation as part of a planetary simulation.\n\nEcosim takes the ideas of the Noble Ape Simulation and creates an educational tool specifically developed to highlight concepts in biodiversity. It was developed by Barbalet in 1997-1998 based on correspondence with a high school science teacher in Australia who wanted to have a tool to teach biodiversity based on Barbalet's work with Noble Ape.\n\nThis sub-project comes from the work of Bob Mottram to create a skeleton and vascular simulation based on the Noble Ape Simulation. The sub-project is based on taking Mottram's work and re-integrating it with the ongoing development.\n\nNoble Insect came from Barbalet's time in Las Vegas, Nevada. It is based on taking an insect brain and simulating that interaction with ideas and concepts developed through Noble Ape.\n\n\n"}

In 1964, she joined the Pakistan Navy and saw the military actions in the Indo-Pakistani theaters in 1965 and, later in 1971.\n\nIn 1968, \"Ghazi\" executed a submerged circumnavigation of Africa and southern parts of Europe through the Indian Ocean to the Atlantic Ocean due to the closure of the Suez Canal in order to be refitted and updated at Gölcük, Turkey. The submarine could be armed with up to ~28 Mk.14 torpedoes and had the capability of mine-laying added as part of her refit.\n\nStarting from being the only submarine in the Indo-Pakistani war of 1965, \"Ghazi\" remained the Pakistan Navy's flagship submarine until she sank under mysterious circumstances near India's eastern coast while conducting naval operations en route to the Bay of Bengal. While the Indian Navy credits \"Ghazi\"s sinking to its destroyer , the Pakistani military review stated that \"the submarine sank due to either an internal explosion or accidental detonation of mines being laid by the submarine off the Visakhapatnam harbour\" with neutral sources confirming that \"Rajput\" was still in port when the submarine sank.\nIndian historians consider the sinking of \"Ghazi\" to be a notable event. They have described the sinking as one of the \"last unsolved greatest mysteries of the 1971 war.\"\n\n, a long-range fast-attack was launched on 1 December 1944, sponsored by the wife of U.S. Navy's Captain V. D. Chapline on 31 March 1945 with Lieutenant Commander Gordon Graham Matheson as her first commanding officer.\n\nShe was the only warship of the United States Navy to be named \"Diablo\", which means \"devil\" in Spanish. The submarine's assigned and issued insignia patch identified the caricature image of the devil running with a torpedo in the sea.\n\nAs her keel was laid down by the Portsmouth Navy Yard, \"Diablo\" arrived at Pearl Harbor from New London, Connecticut on 21 July 1945 and sailed for her first war patrol on 10 August with instructions to stop at Saipan for final orders. With the ceasefire, her destination was changed to Guam where she arrived on 22 August 1945. On the last day of the month, she got underway for Pearl Harbor and the East Coast arriving at New York City on 11 October, except for a visit to Charleston, South Carolina in October where she remained at New York until 8 January 1946.\n\nFrom 15 January 1946 to 27 April 1949, \"Diablo\" was based in the Panama Canal Zone participating in fleet exercises and rendering services to surface units in the Caribbean Sea. From 23 August to 2 October 1947, she joined the submarines and for a simulated war patrol down the west coast of South America and around Tierra del Fuego. The three submarines called at Valparaíso, Chile, in September while homeward bound. \"Diablo\" sailed to Key West, Florida, for antisubmarine warfare exercises, from 16 November to 9 December 1947, and operated from New Orleans, Louisiana, for the training of naval reservists in March 1948.\n\n\"Diablo\" arrived at Naval Station Norfolk in Virginia, her new home port, on 5 June 1949, and participated in Operation Convex in 1951, and alternated training cruises with duty at the Sonar School at Key West. Her homeport became New London in 1952 and she arrived there 17 September to provide training facilities for the Submarine School.\n\nFrom 3 May to 1 June 1954, she was attached to the Operational Development Force at Key West for tests of new weapons and equipment. She participated in Operation Springboard in the Caribbean from 21 February to 28 March 1955, and continued to alternate service with the Submarine School with antisubmarine warfare and fleet exercises in the Caribbean and off Bermuda, as well as rendering services to the Fleet Sonar School and Operational Development Force at Key West. Between February and April 1959, she cruised through the Panama Canal along the coasts of Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, and Chile for exercises with South American navies. On 27 May 1960, she entered Philadelphia Naval Shipyard for an overhaul which continued through October 1960.\n\nIn 1962, her hull classification symbol was changed to AGSS-479.\n\nThe procurement and acquisition of \"Ghazi\" was a result of lengthy and complicated negotiation between the administrations of Pakistan and the United States. \nSince the 1950s the Pakistan Navy had been seeking to procure imported submarines, initially negotiating with the Royal Navy and subsequently also with the United States Navy.\n\nWith Ayub administration improving relations with the Eisenhower administration in 1960, \"Ghazi\" was finally procured under the Security Assistance Program (SAP) authorised by the Kennedy administration on a four-year lease with an option of renewing or purchasing the submarine afterwards in 1963.\n\n\"Ghazi\" was the first submarine to be operated by a Navy in South Asia becoming a serious threat to the Indian Navy. Contrary to popular perception, \"Ghazi\" technological feats were downgraded and extensively refitted its Fleet Snorkel under the Guppy program of the U.S. Navy at the Philadelphia Naval Dockyard, and was mostly unmodernized when she joined the services of Pakistan Navy. Naval historians had described \"Ghazi\" as an unarmed \"clockwork mouse\" used for training purposes. Nonetheless, the Indian Navy immediately was under the impression that it was militarized and an updated submarine that posed a serious threat.\n\nShe was fitted with 14 vintage Mark-14 torpedoes which had the controversy and notoriety of its own during the World War II. On 4 September 1964, she arrived at the Naval Dockyard in Karachi and joined the Navy as its first-ever long-range fast-attack submarine. She was named and designated as \"Ghazi\" (lit. Holiest Warrior) by the Pakistan Navy in 1964.\n\nOn 5 August 1965, the war broke out between India and Pakistan as a result of covert infiltration in Indian Kashmir, and \"Ghazi\", at that time, was under the command of then-Commander Karamat Rahman Niazi, who would later ascend as a four-star admiral in the Navy. Other officers who served in \"Ghazi\" were then-Lieutenant-Commander Ahmed Tasnim (later promoted as Vice-Admiral), Sub-Lieutenant Fasih Bokhari, and Lieutenant Zafar Muhammad who would later command her, as a Commander, in 1971.\n\nThe notable commanding officers of \"Ghazi\" in 1965 included: \nShe was the only submarine in the conflict arena that was deployed in the war theatre with a mission scope of attacking only heavy and major warships of the Indian Navy. She only aided the flotilla under the command of Commodore S.M. Anwar that launched a naval attack on radar station in Dwarka, Gujarat, India. In addition, she was also seeking , the only aircraft carrier, but did not detect her target during the entire conflict. On 9 September 1965, INS \"Beas\" made an unsuccessful depth charge attack in an attempt to make a contact with \"Ghazi\".\n\nOn 17 September 1965, \"Ghazi\" made a surface contact and identified INS \"Brahmaputra\" and fired three World War II-origin Mark 14 torpedoes and increased depth to evade the counterattack. According to submarine war logs, there were three distinct explosions that were heard at about the time when the torpedoes should have impacted but \"Brahmaputra\" was not sunk neither it had been hit it since the warship did not released the depth charge nor it had detected the homing signal. No ships were sunk or damaged in the area and \"Ghazi\" safely reported back to base.\n\nUpon her return, she won ten war awards including two decorations of \"Sitara-e-Jurat\", one \"Tamgha-i-Jurat\", and the President's citations and six Imtiazi Sanads while her commander, Cdr. K.R. Niazi was decorated with the Sitara-e-Jurat and chief petty officers were decorated with the Tamgha-i-Jurat. It is not known what \"Ghazi\"s target was or what were the three mysterious explosions were since no inquiry report was ever submitted.\n\nAfter the war, an arms embargo was placed in 1965–66 on both India and Pakistan but was later waived by the United States that was strictly based on the cash and carry method as \"Ghazi\" badly needing refitting. In 1967, the Navy applied to renew another four-year lease deal which was duly approved by the U.S. Navy and the U.S. Government but her material state and equipment continued to deteriorate. The Navy then signed a deal with the Turkish Navy for a refit and mid-life update that was to be carried out at Gölcük in Turkey – the only facility to update the \"Tench\"-class submarines.\n\nBecause of the Six-Day War in Middle East which had closed the Suez Canal due to the Egyptian Navy's blockage in 1967, \"Ghazi\", under the command of Commander Ahmed Tasnim, had to execute a submerged circumnavigation in 1968 from Africa to Western Europe which began from Karachi coast to Cape of Good Hope, South Africa and then through the Atlantic Ocean and it ended at the east coast of the Sea of Marmara where the Gölcük Naval Shipyard is located. Chief of Naval Staff Admiral S.M. Ahsan had arranged necessary refitting of \"Ghazi\"s computers at the Karachi Engineering and Shipyard Works (KESW) from the help from the local industry such as DESTO.\n\nDuring her submerged circumnavigation voyage, she briefly stopped at Mombasa, Kenya for refueling and, in Maputo, Mozambique before making a farewell visit at Simon's Town, South Africa. After passing the Cape of Good Hope, she made another stopover at Luanda, Angola for victualing and continued her journey towards Western Europe to stopover at Toulon, France where she was greeted by the French Navy. Her final stopover was at İzmir in Turkey and submerged through the east coast of the Sea of Marmara to dock at the Gölcük Naval Shipyard which was the only facility to upgrade the \"Tench\"-class based computers and other electromechanical equipments. It took her two months to complete her circumnavigation of Africa and Europe.\n\nThe deal for refitting and mid-life upgrading of her military computers reportedly cost ~$1.5 million ($11.1 million in 2015–16). The program started in March 1968 and completed in April 1970 and it is believed that the U.S-made ill-fitted World War II era Mk.14/Mk.10 naval mines were bought \"secretly\" from Turkey.\n\nUnder the command of Lieutenant Commander Yousaf Raza, \"Ghazi\" returned to Karachi coast after successfully completing the submerged circumnavigation of Africa which was taken in order to undergo a refitting program and mid-life updates of her military computers on 2 April 1970.\n\nIn August 1971, the Indian Navy transferred INS \"Vikrant\", its aircraft carrier, to the Eastern Naval Command in Visakhapatnam that forced the Pakistan Navy to adjust its submarine operations. Before 1971, there were several proposals made to the Ayub administration to strengthen the naval defense of East Pakistan but none were made feasible and the Navy was in no position to mount a defence against an approaching Indian naval advances. After the defection of officers and sailors of East-Pakistan Navy to India, the Eastern Command was under intense pressure to counter the insurgency and the advance of the Indian Army towards East Pakistan on three fronts. The Yahya administration insisted the Navy attempt to reinforce the naval defence of the East while the Navy NHQ objected to the idea of deploying \"Ghazi\" in the total absence of a seaport, straying away from their original plan. Many senior commanders had felt that the deployment of \"Ghazi\" was highly dangerous and impossible to achieve by sending the obsolete submarine behind enemy lines but deployment came when it became apparent that the war was inevitable.\n\nPrior to her deployment, \"Ghazi\" continued to experience equipment failures and reportedly had aging issues. Since it was the only submarine of the Pakistan Navy and had the range and capability to undertake operations in the distant waters controlled by India, \"Ghazi\" was pressed into operation to destroy or damage \"Vikrant\". On 14 November 1971, she quietly sailed around the Indian peninsula from the Arabian Sea to the Bay of Bengal under the command of Zafar Muhammad who was commanding a submarine for the first time, with 10 officers and 82 sailors. \"Ghazi\" was on a two-fold mission: the primary goal was to locate and sink \"Vikrant\" and secondary was to mine India's eastern seaboard which was to be fulfilled irrespective of the accomplishment of the first.\n\nThe mysterious sinking of \"Ghazi\" took place on 4 December 1971 during its hunt to find \"Vikrant\" and/or during the minelaying mission on the Visakhapatnam Port, Bay of Bengal. The true cause of the sinking is still unknown, and Indian and Pakistani sources have different views.\n\nOn 16 November, she was in contact with the Navy NHQ and Commander Khan charted the coordinates that reported that she was off Bombay. On 19 November, she was off to Sri Lanka and entered in Bay of Bengal on 20 November 1971. Around this time, the Top Secret files were opened as instructed and the hunt for \"Vikrant\" began on 23 November and \"Ghazi\" was off to Madras where reportedly the Indian aircraft carrier was stationed but she was 10 days late and \"Vikrant\" was now actually somewhere near the Andaman Islands. Unable to detect her target, \"Ghazi\"s commanders became delusional from their hunt for \"Vikrant\" and turned back to Visakhapatnam to start laying mines off the harbour with a confidence that it will take its swipe at \"Vikrant\" or at least bottle up the Indian Navy's heavy units clustered in this major Indian naval base on the night of 2–3 December 1971.\"\n\nOn 1 December 1971, Vice Admiral Nilakanta Krishnan briefed Captain Inder Singh, the commanding officer of , that a Pakistani submarine had been sighted off the Sri Lankan coast and was absolutely certain that the submarine would be somewhere around Madras or Visakhapatnam. He made it clear that once \"Rajput\" had completed refueling, she must leave the harbor with all navigational aids switched off.\n\nAccording to Indian claims, at 23:40 on 3 December 1971, taking on board a pilot, \"Rajput\" moved through the channel to the exit from Visakhapatnam.\n\nExactly at midnight, shortly after passing the entrance buoy, the starboard lookout reported a breaker on the surface of the water right on the nose. According to the Indian Navy's claims, Captain Singh changed the course at full speed across the specified point and ordered to drop two depth charges, which was done. The explosions were \"stunning\", and \"Rajput\" suffered a serious material concussion to its structure. However, visible results of this attack are not given. \"Rajput\" for some time surveyed the area dumping bombs, no longer found any contact — either visual or acoustic. A few minutes later, the destroyer continued her way to the coast of East Pakistan.\n\nOn the night of the 4–5 December 1971, \"Ghazi\" sunk with all 93 servicemen on board (11 officers and 82 enlisted) under the mysterious circumstances off the Visakhapatnam coast, allowing the Indian Navy to effect a naval blockade of East Pakistan (now Bangladesh).\n\nAccording to Indian DNI's director Rear-Admiral Mihir K. Roy, \"Ghazi\"s existence was revealed when a signal addressed to naval authorities in Chittagong was intercepted, requesting information on a lubrication oil only used by submarines and minesweepers.\n\nIndian Navy intelligence tracked \"Ghazi\" with a codename issued as \"Kali Devi\", and the Indian Navy began to realize that the Pakistanis would inevitably be forced to send their submarine \"Ghazi\" to the Bay of Bengal, as the sole ship which could operate in these waters.\n\nVice Admiral Nilakanta Krishnan of the Eastern Naval Command had maintained that it was pretty clear that Pakistan would have deployed \"Ghazi\" in the Bay of Bengal and a part of its plan was an attempt to sink the Indian aircraft carrier \"Vikrant\". At the same time concerted action was taken to disseminate misinformation designed to mislead the enemy about the true location of the aircraft carrier, and to foster confidence that the carrier was stationed at Visakhapatnam.\n\nAll these activities were apparently successful in deceiving \"Ghazi\" when on 25 November 1971, the Navy NHQ communicated with \"Ghazi\" that stated: \"INTEL INDICATES CARRIER IN PORT Visakhapatnam\".\n\nOn 26 November 1971, \"Ghazi\" was expected to communicate with the Navy NHQ to submit its mission report but did not communicate with its base. The Navy NHQ repeatedly made frantic efforts to establish the communication and anxiety grew as days passed for her return to the base. Before the naval hostilities broke out, commanding officers had started worrying about \"Ghazi\"s fate and had already began to agitate their minds but the Navy NHQ senior command had replied to their junior officers that several reasons could, however, be attributed to the failure of the submarine to communicate.\n\nOn 9 December, the Indian Navy strangely issued a statement about the fate of \"Ghazi.\" The first indication of \"Ghazi\"s fate came when a message from the Indian NHQ, claiming sinking of \"Ghazi\" on the night of 3 December, was intercepted. The Indian NHQ issued the statement a few hours before the loss of , and prior to launch of second missile attack on Karachi port.\n\nAfter the ceasefire in 1971, the Government of India undertook an investigation into the incident and immediately claimed that the submarine was sunk following the series of maneuvers by the Indian Navy. A submarine rescue vessel, INS \"Karanj\" was sent to check the debris and India later built a \"Victory Memorial\" on the coast near where \"Ghazi\" was sunk. India credits the INS \"Rajput\" for sinking \"Ghazi\" and her crew were honored with gallantry awards for this event, but the actual details of \"Ghazi\"s sinking soon began to emerge after the war.\n\nThe claim of sinking \"Ghazi\" has been a center of controversy between the Indian authors, giving doubts in their theories of mysterious sinking of the submarine. With Commodore Ranjit Roy testifying that \"very loud explosion effects were heard at the beach that came from underwater.\" Commodore Roy also concluded that \"...at that time, how the \"Ghazi\" was sunk remained unclear as it does today.\"\n\nThe official history of Indian Navy: ‘\"Transition to Triumph\"’, authored by retired Vice-Admiral G.M. Hiranandani, gave exhaustive account of the sinking of \"Ghazi\" and quoted that the naval records and top naval officials who commanded operations on the eastern seafront as saying that INS \"Rajput\" was sent from Visakhapatnam to track down \"Ghazi\". The book also noted that the time of dropping of the charges, the explosion which was heard by the people of Visakhapatnam and that of a clock recovered from \"Ghazi\", matched. However, Admiral Hiranandani maintained that the submarine almost certainly suffered an internal explosion but its causes are debatable.\n\nAdmiral Roy of India states: \"The theories propounded earlier by some who were unaware of the \"ruse de guerre\" (attempt to fool the enemy in wartime) leading to the sinking of the first submarine in the Indian Ocean gave rise to smirks from within our own (Indian) naval service for an operation which instead merited a \"Bravo Zulu\" (flag hoist for Well Done)\".\n\nAdmiral S. M. Nanda, Chief of Naval Staff of the Indian Navy during the conflict, stated : \"In narrow channels, ships, during an emergency or war, always throw depth charges around them to deter submarines. One of them probably hit the \"Ghazi\". The blow-up was there, but nobody knew what it was all about until the fisherman found the life jacket\".\n\nIn 2003, the Indian Navy again sent its divers to overlook its investigation and the divers recovered some items including the war logs, officials backup tapes from her computers, and mission files that were displaced in Eastern Naval Command of Indian Navy, but the divers who studied the wreckage confirmed that the submarine must have suffered an internal explosion which blew up its mines and torpedoes. Another theory suggests an explosion of hydrogen gas which violently built up inside the submarine while its batteries were being charged underwater.\n\nIn 2010, Lieutenant-General J.F.R Jacob of Eastern Command mentioned in an article that \"\"Ghazi\" was destroyed in an accident in which Indian Navy was not involved. There were many opinions from authors of the Indian side who also shared this skepticism of the Indian Navy’s official stance. In 2011, former Indian naval chief, Admiral Arun Prakash quoted in the national security conference that [\"Ghazi\"] had sunk under mysterious circumstances, \"not by INS Rajput as originally claimed.\"\n\nIn 1972, the Hamoodur Rahman Commission (HRC) never carried out investigation into this incident despite its formation to assess the military and political failures of the country in the war of 1971.\n\nIt was only on 10 February 1972, when the incident was officially recognized by the Government of Pakistan and then-President Zulfikar Bhutto met with the grieving families and loved ones of the officers and sailors who served in \"Ghazi\", and told them that they may have all perished due to this incident as many of the slain family members were pushing for repatriation to the Government of Pakistan as they were keeping the hope alive that they may have survived and rescued by India.\n\nThe Naval Intelligence conducted its own investigations and its military oversights stated that \"Ghazi\" sank, when the mines it was laying, were accidentally detonated. Pakistani military oversights into this incident were not immediate instead, the Naval Intelligence took time to conclude its investigations that went on for several years. Over the decades, the military oversights were kept hidden and were not known to the public until when the Navy made an announcement over the completion of its insights into this incident. Following this announcement, Pakistan addressed the problems connecting the electromechanical failures, computer problems, and Mk.14 torpedoes' \"circular deep running\" once launched from the firing ship.\n\nPakistan never accepted the theory from Indian Navy but provided its alternative insights into this disaster based on the investigations on the Mark 14 torpedoes and other vintage military equipment installed in \"Ghazi\". According to Pakistan Navy's investigation, there were two probable reasons connecting to this mishappening:\n\nAnother more plausible theory from foreign experts, also favored by Pakistan, is that the explosive shock waves from one of the depth charges set off the torpedoes and mines (some of which may have been armed for laying) stored aboard the submarine. The Navy NHQ counter-argued: \"Ghazi\" itself may have inadvertently passed over the mines during the mine laying operations; patrolling Indian vessels or Indian depth charges might also have tripped the count mechanism of one or more mines. Credibility is added to this story by the later discovery made by Indian Coast Guard divers in 2003, that the damaged parts of the submarine had been blown inside out.\n\nIn addition, the NI's investigations also exposed the ill-considered deployment of \"Ghazi\" when it was indicated that there was no indication that \"Ghazi's\" crew had ever practiced with mines.\n\nIn 2006, Pakistan, citing their evidences, vehemently rejected India's claim of sinking \"Ghazi\" and termed the claims as \"false and utterly absurd\".\n\nAn independent testimony stems from an Egyptian Navy officer, who claimed that the Indian ships were docked at the Visakhapatnam.\n\nMany independent writers and investigators maintained \"Ghazi\" was sunk mysteriously not by two depth charges alone– \"Ghazi\" may have sunk either by the hydrogen explosion produced when the batteries were charging, or by the detonation of a mine, or either by the sea floor impact while trying to avoid the depth charge released by INS \"Rajput\".\n\nIn 2012, Pakistani investigative journalists from \"The Express Tribune\" who were affiliated with the Express News USA based in the Washington D.C. were able to get in touch with \"Diablo's\"' retired and now-aged former US Navy crew members who were allowed to study the sonar pictures and sketches of the sunken vessel where they believed that: \"an explosion in the Forward Torpedo Room (FTR) destroyed the Ghazi.\" This view is also shared by Indian journalist Sandeep Unnithan, who specializes in military and strategic analysis.\n\nIn 1972, both the United States and the Soviet Union offered to raise the submarine to the surface at their own expense. The Government of India, however, rejected these offers and allowed the submarine to sink further into the mud off the fairway buoy of Visakhapatnam.\n\nIn 2003, Indian Navy divers recovered few items from the submarine and brought up six bloated bodies of Pakistani servicemen when they blasted their way into the submarine. All six servicemen were given military honorary burial by the Indian Navy. Items recovered were the back-up tapes of the radar computers, war logs, broken windshield, top secret files, as well as one of the bodies of a Petty Officer Mechanical Engineer (POME) who had a wheel spanner tightly grasped in his fist. Another sailor had in his pocket a letter written in Urdu to his fiancée.\n\nIn 2003, additional photos were released by the Indian Navy of the vessel.\n\nIn 1972, \"Ghazi\" and her serving officers as well as crew members were honored with gallantry awards by the Government of Pakistan. After the war, President Richard Nixon forgave the remaining debt of \"Ghazi\" to Pakistan when the U.S. Navy's CNO Admiral Elmo Zumwalt visited Admiral Mohammad Shariff in Calcutta in 1972. In addition, she remained the first and yet to-date the only U.S.-built submarine to have served in the Pakistan Navy, although in successive years, only surface warships had been acquired through transfers from the United States as Pakistan worked towards building its own long-range submarines, the Agosta 90B, through a technology transfer from France.\n\nAt the Naval Dockyard in Karachi, a 'Ghazi Monument' was built to perpetuate the memory of the submarine and its 93 men. In 1974, the naval base, , was commissioned and constructed in the memory of Commander Zafar Muhammad Khan that now serves as the headquarter for Northern Naval Command. In 1975, the Navy acquired the from the Portuguese Navy and named it \"Ghazi\" (S-134), in memory of PNS \"Ghazi\".\n\nIn 1998, the Inter-Services Public Relations produced and released the telefilm, \"Ghazi Shaheed\" that starred Shabbir Jan as commander of \"Ghazi\", and Mishi Khan as Commander's wife; the telefilm is based on the events involving \"Ghazi\"s mission and overlooks the lives of men who served in \"Ghazi\". Another movie, \"Untold Stories: Ghazi and Hangor\" were sponsored and released by the ISPR to commemorate \"Ghazi\" and her crew during their missions in 1971. In 2017, an Indian film was based on this submarine attack named \"The Ghazi Attack\".\n\nIn 2016, was commissioned where \"Ghazi\" was honored and is a namesake of her first officer, Lt-Cdr. Pervez Hameed.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Although they may still enter in competitions, winning is not the soul surfer's main motive, since they scorn the commercialization of surfing. The term denotes a spirituality of surfing. As Brad Melekian put it in a 2005 article in \"Surfer\" magazine:\n\nto pursue surfing not just as an athletic endeavor or as a sunny day diversion, but to try to glean whatever lessons you can from the practice. It means being aware of your surroundings, and respectful of the people and places that you interact with. It means being patient, mindful, kind, compassionate, understanding, active, thoughtful, faithful, hopeful, gracious, disciplined and...good.\nThe term originates from a 1963 surf instrumental of the same name.\n\nThe first published mention of the term was in the 1963 surf guitar instrumental \"Soul Surfer\", by the Southern California surf guitarist Johnny Fortune. The song was intended to reference the then-current soul music genre. The term \"soul surfing\" gained popularity in the late '60s, with the phrase most used in the mid- and late-'70s. In 1969 theologian Tom Blake penned an article entitled \"Voice of the Wave\", which examined the religious elements of surfing. By the early 70s, curious surfers began to experiment with various Eastern philosophies, such as yoga and meditation.\n\nThe concept of the soul surfer was the main focus for the 1987 film \"North Shore\", where the lead character fails to win a major surf competition because someone cheated, yet, unfazed, shrugs his shoulders and remarks that “it doesn’t matter to a soul surfer”. This was also a concept expounded in the 1994 film \"The Endless Summer II\", a documentary which sees two talented surfers go around the world to emulate the original film, \"The Endless Summer\". More recently, the phrase was used as the title of a book about Bethany Hamilton, a young female surfer who continued to surf after her arm was bitten off by a tiger shark. The book was made into a 2011 feature film, also called \"Soul Surfer\".\n\nSoul surfing has been described as “the highest level, the pinnacle of surfing spirituality equivalent to Nirvana, Satori, and total enlightenment, but is rarely attained. The Soul Surfer expresses himself through his unity with the breaking wave. He borrows the wave's spirit for a short while and uses his body and equipment to translate the essence of the wave's spirit into Art”.\n\n\n"}

A past Miss Universe Denmark and Miss International Friendship, Binau has since developed resources for families to use when coping with grief and the death or imminent death (hospice care) of a friend or family member.\n\nBinau and her sister Helle Bøje Holm, were born to mother Jytte Anna Christiansen and (late) father Peter Bøje Rasmussen. Binau is the mother to four children: Christina Binau Bonnor (born 1988), Malene Binau Bonnor (born 1991), Christian Binau Bonnor (born 1996) and Anders Frederik Binau (born 2004). She married investor and music producer Alan Binau in August 2004. The couple divorced in 2016.\n\nBinau's education includes degrees from Roskilde University, Master in Adult Education and Human Resource Development; Danmarks Pædagogiske Universitet, P.D. (Bachelor) Educational planner, and an Adult Teaching Degree (Aarhus Universitet Danmarks Lærerhøjskole). In addition, Binau completed marketing and leadership training through the Danish Bachelor of Commerce accreditation program, and holds a certification in cognitive behavioral and psychological testing: Myers-Briggs Type Indicator, Jungian Type Index, Belbin Self Perception Inventory, and Occupational Personality Questionnaires.\n\n\nAs a result of a cancer diagnosis in October 2006, Binau began to consider other ways that she could put her experience and energy to work to help families of seriously ill patients. She had envisioned how \"easy\", simple and important it would be to create a \"hands on tool\" that hospital staff could distribute to terminally ill patients and their loved ones. That vision became a reality when she developed the Angels Package.\n\nWhen this project began, Binau did not have a budget to work with; she spray painted the first angels in her garage in Florida, then brought the first prototypes with her in a suitcase to Denmark. At this time, her father was dying and Binau arrived just in time to say goodbye. As the first recipient of an Angel Package, he was surrounded by angels and calming music from MusiCure when he died. This loss taught Binau some important lessons that she later described in the national Danish newspaper \"Søndagsavisen\". The life lessons learned through this difficult time were integral to the development of Binau's short publication \"Dignity in the final hours\" (Vaerdighed I sidste stund).\n\nIn the following years, Binau embraced a role as \"the voice of the families and children\", advocating and participating as much as possible in the media, and on national television and radio to build awareness about the needs and challenges of families facing terminal or serious illness.\n\nAfter facing serious illness in their own relationship and understanding that sharing their own experience may help other couples with the difficult challenges encountered during the illness of a partner, Binau and her husband Alan Binau co-authored the book \"Till Sickness Do Us Part - How Love Survives in Difficult Times\", published by .\n\nAddressing the difficult topics of illness, death and dying in her books was a way to create awareness of harmful cultural taboos. Sharing her own experiences and the experiences of her family opened much needed community and international dialog on this topic, ultimately leading to speaking engagements throughout Denmark and beyond. Through these engagements, Binau speaks to patients, patient families, and healthcare professionals to provide motivation, inspiration, and guidance.\n\nDuring chemotherapy Binau co-founded the company Vfactor A/S with Charlotte Alexandra Pedersen. This was something that Binau and Pederson had planned and discussed for a long time, and they persisted in this work and vision despite the challenges presented by Binau's chemotherapy treatments and recovery from surgery.\n\nBinau is credited with developing new educational concepts including \"Value Academy\" and \"Charter Academy\", and building a strong mentor network of CEOs of some of the most prominent Danish companies. Within the first couple of years, the client-base and vast network of Vfactor A/S had grown to include some of Denmark's largest corporations including AP Møller Mærsk and Microsoft. The company also established successful collaborations with notable politicians.\n\nIn 2009 Binau made the decision to fully focus on being an advocate for families dealing with terminal illness. In an article written by Amy Patt, Binau emphasized how important it is to share experiences with like-minded people (patients, families, and friends) in order to avoid loneliness and isolation. This concept was the driving motivator behind Binau's success in founding charities on two continents while working with minimal financial resources.\n\nIn 2011 Binau founded the Danish charity Landsforeningen Støtte før Afskeden, together with composer Niels Eje. The MusiCure CD sampler included in the patient donation package is an important component. The music consists of soundscapes which use a scientifically based method to induce calm and soothing therapeutic effects in listeners.\n\nAlso in 2011, Binau founded USA-based AngelKIT Foundation.\n\nPreviously, Binau founded and managed another charity, the Female Courage Foundation.\n\nIn 2013, Binau's nine-year-old son Andy (Anders) handed her a book called \"Max the Super Dog's Pet Shop Adventures\". Andy said that he wanted to give his mother a helping hand: \"My mother had created a book about cancer for the adults in the hospitals. So I thought that there was a lack of a book for children, who must lose one they care about, and then I started to do it.\" This booklet, about a 'superpup', was created as an activity book to be given as a gift for hospitalized children. It later became an important part of a donation program, the AngelKID Heart Package (HJERTEPAKKE package), for children who have a terminally ill relative.\n\nThe AngelKID package program was launched through the Danish Charity founded by Binau, Landsforeningen Støtte Før Afskeden (National Association for Support Before Parting). The launch was publicized during a national bus campaign and on national television, with Ambassador Cecilie Lind (age 25) and her sister Fiona (age 9), sisters who lost their mother in 2012 after a short battle with cancer. The book \"Max the Super Dog's Adventures\" and Heart Package Donations were further publicized by Susan and Andy Binau during a fall 2014 campaign in Denmark.\n\nHeart Packages (Hjertepakken, Danish) have been donated to over 1000 children.\n\nThe project received support from several large foundations including Harboefonden, Tømrerhandler Johannes Fog Fonden, Fonden Brand af 1849], Møenbrogaard Fonden, and OLE KIRKS FOND, a Danish charity named after the founder of Lego, Ole Kirk.\n\nIn 2012, Binau partnered with Danish Actor Christian Heldbo Wienborg to begin fundraising and production of an international television documentary program designed to demonstrate that discussing, understanding, preparing for, and coping with the death of loved ones is a natural part of life and should not be a cultural taboo.\n\nAn experienced speaker, Binau has traveled internationally to share her personal and professional experiences and successes with patients, patient families, healthcare professionals, and other audiences around the globe. Her time is split between homes in the USA and Europe.\n\nDanish books:\n\nThe Caring Soul Series is a collection of three inspirational self-help books, which are based on true stories and focus on people dealing with challenging life experiences ranging from serious illness through death and grieving. \n\nThe books in the \"Super Dog Zam Grief\" series offer families with grieving children a self-help tool to use at home. The workbooks were developed specifically for three different age groups: 3-5, 6-8, and 9–12 years. The books were co-authored by Binau's youngest son, Andy Binau (creator of \"The Super Dog ZAM\" and author of \"My Doggy Diary\"), and daughter, Malene Shak (a certified Montessori teacher).\n\n\n\n\n"}

It was published as a hardcover by Random House in 2007 and as a paperback by Cambridge University Press in 2011.\n\nThe Living Cosmos is a non-fiction book by University of Arizona professor of astronomy Chris Impey on the status of astrobiology. It summarizes the state of research as scientists trying to address one of the most profound questions we can ask about nature: Is there life in the universe beyond the Earth? The author interviewed dozens of leading researchers, and he includes material from the interviews and vignettes of the researchers in the book. The companion web site to the book contains articles and video clips on astrobiology produced by the author, as well as a glossary and links to other relevant sites.\n\nThe book begins with a review of the cosmic setting for life and reviews the insights of astronomy since Copernicus. The discovery that we live in a “biological universe” would be a continuation of the progression where there is nothing exceptional about the setting of the Earth and the events that have occurred on this planet.\n\nSubsequent chapters consider the origin of life on Earth, and the physical extremes to which life as adapted. In astrobiology, it pays to think “outside the box” and imagine how strange life might be or whether post-biological evolution is possible, where the basis is mechanical or computational. A chapter on evolution shows how it is affected by the cosmic environment.\nPossibilities of life in the Solar System are considered next, with emphasis on Mars, Titan, and outer moons harboring liquid water. Next is a summary of the rapidly changing state of play in the search for extrasolar planets or exoplanets. After centuries of speculation and decades of futile searching, planets around other stars were first discovered in 1995 and the number is now over 850, with several thousand more candidates from the Kepler mission. The book ends with the search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI) and the use of the Drake equation to frame discussions of cosmic companionship.\n\nThe web site for the book features images of a set of seven mixed media, boxed construction art pieces by Heather Green, commissioned specially for the book. The art is on permanent display in the BIO5 Institute at the University of Arizona. An article on the collaboration between Heather Green and Chris Impey and the artistic and scientific themes of the work was published in the Leonardo Journal online.\n\nThe Living Cosmos was generally very well received. It received a starred review from Kirkus Reviews, referring to the book as a “Lively, clear, and up-to-date overview of astronomy, cosmology, biology, and evolution, specifically as related to the search for extraterrestrial life”. Popular magazine Entertainment Weekly gave the book a grade of B+, saying it was “not an easy read” but calling it a “live, elegant overview”. It was reviewed by \"Nature\", \"Physics Today\", and \"New Scientist\", with the latter commenting on occasional digressions, but declaring the book “beautifully written”. Reader reviews are 85% five stars on Amazon and over 90% like the book on Goodreads. The 2011 paperback edition has updates to help keep up with the accelerating pace of exoplanet discovery.\n\n"}

Such tombs can be found in many nations and are usually high-profile national monuments. Throughout history, many soldiers have died in war with their remains being unidentified. Following World War I, a movement arose to commemorate these soldiers with a single tomb, containing the body of one such unidentified soldier. It is a tomb for unknown people.\n\nDuring the First World War, the British and French armies who were allies during the war jointly decided to bury soldiers themselves. In the UK, under the Imperial War Graves Commission (now Commonwealth War Graves Commission), the Reverend David Railton had seen a grave marked by a rough cross while serving in the British Army as a chaplain on the Western Front, which bore the pencil-written legend \"An Unknown British Soldier\". He suggested (together with the French in their own country) the creation at a national level of a symbolic funeral and burial of an \"Unknown Warrior\", proposing that the grave should in the UK include a national monument in the form of what is usually, but not in this particular case, a headstone. The idea received the support of the Dean of Westminster, Prime Minister David Lloyd George, and later from King George V, responding to a wave of public support. At the same time, a similar concern grew in France. In November 1916, a local officer of Le Souvenir français proposed the idea of burying \"an ignored soldier\" in the Panthéon. A formal bill was presented in Parliament in November 1918. The decision was voted into law on September 1919.\n\nThe United Kingdom and France conducted services connected with their 'monumental' graves (as presumably newly conceived, and in any case approved, by their respective armies) on Armistice Day 1920 (the burial itself taking place later in January of the following year in France). In the UK, the Tomb of the Unknown Warrior was created at Westminster Abbey, while in France \"La tombe du soldat inconnu\" was placed in the Arc de Triomphe.\n\nThe idea of a symbolic Tomb of the Unknown Soldier then spread to other countries. In 1921, the United States unveiled its own Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, Portugal its Túmulo do Soldado Desconhecido, and Italy its La tomba del Milite Ignoto. Other nations have followed the practice and created their own tombs.\n\nIn Chile and Ukraine, second 'unknown tombs' were unveiled to commemorate \"The Unknown Sailor\".\n\nThe Tombs of the Unknown Soldiers typically contain the remains of a dead soldier who is unidentified (or \"known but to God\" as the stone is sometimes inscribed). These remains are considered impossible to be identified, and so serve as a symbol for all of a country's unknown dead wherever they fell in the war being remembered. The anonymity of the entombed soldier is the key symbolism of the monument; it could be the tomb of anyone who fell in service of the nation, and therefore serves as a monument symbolizing all of the sacrifices.\n\nTombs of the Unknown Soldiers from around the world and various wars include the following:\n\n\n"}

Each of them was shot execution-style with several bullets in the head.\n\nAccording to investigations by French authorities, it is possible that MİT (Turkey's National Intelligence Organization) is involved in the murders. The suspected murderer, Ömer Güney, was a 34 year old Turkish maintenance employee at Paris Charles de Gaulle airport. Video cameras at the site of the murder show that he was inside the building between 00:11 and 00:56 when the deaths occurred. Gunpowder was found on his bag. Technical investigations were performed on his Nokia mobile phone and experts decrypted it and restored deleted files. They found images taken the day before (January 8) establishing that he was in the premises of a Kurdish association in Villers-le-Bel between 4:23 and 5:33 in the morning and took pictures of 329 memberships files. Two days before, he took pictures of accounting tracing alleged racketeering activity inside the Kurdish community.\n\nA few months after these murders, an audio recording between Ömer Güney and some members of MiT, and some notes were anonymously released on the Internet. Omer Güney also had hundreds of pictures of Kurdish activists in his mobile phone. Antiterrorist judge Jeanne Duyé was in charge of investigations; in September 2013, her computer was stolen from her home in a burglary. Ömer Güney was in jail from January 21, 2013.\n\nThe judge considered the involvement of Turkish secret services in the murder to be a possibility, but didn't establish who ordered the operation and if the murderer acted according to the will of the top management or not (in theory, this may have been an attempt to stall peace talks that were occurring between Ankara and the PKK at that time). On December 13, 2016, Ömer Güney was moved to a hospital for urgent care connected to his brain tumor and he died the next day, five weeks before the scheduled start of his trial.\n\nEyüp Doru, a representative of Turkish party HDP in Europe, stated that he suspects Fidan Doğan was the main target of the assassination. Lawyer Sylvie Boitel explained that this young woman was very clever and had three cultures: French, Turkish and Kurdish; one of her friends explained that she met French President François Hollande at least three times when he was leader of the Socialist Party and had active relationships with French authorities.\n\nMetin, the brother of Sakine Cansiz, says that France is responsible because she was killed in France and the murderer died in jail before trial.\n\n\"Triple Assassinat au 147, Rue Lafayette\" is a book by Laure Marchand, who spent three years investigating the murders and links with the Turkish secret services.

It has a vivid blue pigment, and is the better known of the two extant species. The species has been assessed as critically endangered on the IUCN Red List.\n\nThe average weight of \"Latimeria chalumnae\" is 80 kg (176 lb), and they can reach up to 2 m (6.5 ft) in length. Adult females are slightly larger than males. \"L. chalumnae\" is widely but very sparsely distributed around the rim of the western Indian Ocean, from South Africa northward along the east African coast to Kenya, the Comoros and Madagascar, seemingly occurring in small colonies.\n\n\"L. chalumnae\" is listed as critically endangered by IUCN. In accordance with the Convention on International Trade of Endangered Species treaty, the coelacanth was added to Appendix I (threatened with extinction) in 1989. The treaty forbids international trade for commercial purposes and regulates all trade, including sending specimens to museums, through a system of permits. In 1998, the total population of the West Indian Ocean coelacanth was estimated to have been 500 or fewer, a number that would threaten the survival of the species.\n\nOn December 23, 1938, Hendrik Goosen, the captain of the trawler \"Nerine\", returned to the harbour at East London, South Africa, after a trawl between the Chalumna and Ncera Rivers. As he frequently did, he telephoned his friend, Marjorie Courtenay-Latimer, curator at East London Museum, to see if she wanted to look over the contents of the catch for anything interesting, and told her of the strange fish he had set aside for her. Correspondence in the archives of the South African Institute for Aquatic Biodiversity (SAIAB, formerly the JLB Smith Institute of Ichthyology) show that Goosen went to great lengths to avoid any damage to this fish and ordered his crew to set it aside for the East London Museum. Goosen later told how the fish was steely blue when first seen but by the time the \"Nerine\" entered East London harbour many hours later the fish had become dark grey.\n\nFailing to find a description of the creature in any of her books, she attempted to contact her friend, Professor J. L. B. Smith, but he was away for Christmas. Unable to preserve the fish, she reluctantly sent it to a taxidermist. When Smith returned, he immediately recognized it as a coelacanth, known only from fossils. Smith named the fish \"Latimeria chalumnae\" in honor of Marjorie Courtenay-Latimer and the waters in which it was found. The two discoverers received immediate recognition, and the fish became known as a \"living fossil\". The 1938 coelacanth is still on display in the East London, South Africa, museum.\n\nHowever, as the specimen had been stuffed, the gills and skeleton were not available for examination, and some doubt therefore remained as to whether it was truly the same species. Smith began a hunt for a second specimen that would take more than a decade.\n\nA second specimen with a missing dorsal fin and deformed tail fin was captured in 1952 off the coast of Anjouan. At the time it was believed to be a new species and placed in a new genus as well, \"Malania\", named in honour of the Prime Minister of South Africa at the time, Daniel François Malan, without whose help the specimen would not have been preserved with its muscles and internal organs more or less intact.\n\nThe genome of \"Latimeria chalumnae\" was sequenced in 2013 to provide insight into tetrapod evolution. The full sequence and annotation of the entry is available on the Ensembl genome browser.\n\n\n"}

Ariès wrote several major books and articles on death mentalities and is credited with introducing death as a topic for historical inquiry. \"Western Attitudes Toward Death\" began as a series of lectures presented to Johns Hopkins University, which he gave for the express purpose of translation and publication. Because Ariès saw America as influential in changing the way the western world viewed death, he felt it was important to have his ideas circulating on both sides of the Atlantic. Covering over a millennia of history, Ariès divided \"Western Attitudes Toward Death\" into four separate periods, which make up the four major sections of the book: Tamed Death, One’s Own Death, Thy Death, and Forbidden Death.\n\nIn his first chapter, he discusses the first period, \"Tamed Death\", using a number of ancient texts and medieval romances. He argues that prior to the seventeenth century, people were acutely aware of their own imminent death, prepared for it, and accepted it. True to his roots as a medieval historian, he cites examples such as of King Ban, Tristan, and Lancelot—these characters are shown facing death while knowing that 'their time has come' and prepare themselves by following prescribed rituals. These rituals were often religious such as Lancelot positioning the body to be facing Jerusalem. The dying man readied his body and soul for death and waited.\n\nThere were four general characteristics: first, the dying person would usually be lying in bed, or at least in a recumbent position. In the Christian tradition the dying person would lie on his or her back, facing the heavens. Second, the dying person in this period always presided over his death and understood its accompanying religious rituals and protocol. The priest was not brought until he was called for, and loved ones did not say goodbye until the dying person consented. Third, death was a public ceremony and parents, spouses, family, neighbors and even children were present at the bedside. Death was seen as normal and it was customary for loved ones to witness the occasion. Finally, while accepted and witnessed, it lacked \"theatrics\" and a \"great show of emotions\". Ariès explains his choice of \"Tamed Death\" as a title is meant to contrast with the \"wild\" death of the twentieth century, in which people fear and avoid death.\n\nIn this early medieval period people were not concerned with what would happen to their bodies after death. For superstitious reasons they did not want the dead to be buried in cities or near the houses of the living, but if the body was buried in a churchyard and remained under the church's protection, little else mattered. People did not believe that the grave should be permanent (especially the graves of the poor) and ossuaries were very common. Moreover, the burial grounds were common meeting places where dancing, gambling, and even commerce took place.\n\nSubtle changes in western people’s attitudes toward death occurred around the eleventh and twelfth centuries. Ariès titled this mentality shift: \"One's Own Death\". The defining feature of this era was a new personalization of death, in which the individual rather than the act of death itself came to the forefront. Ariès notes four major indicators that signify this change.\n\nHe explains that in the previous era, the Christian tradition of Last Judgment separated believers and non-believers after death. Christians alleged that during the second coming of Christ believers would be resurrected in Paradise, while non-believers would cease to exist. However, by the twelfth century Ariès observes that Last Judgment had taken on new meaning. It came to signify judgment passed on one's soul after the moment of death. In the new Christian tradition, people believed that after death their good and bad deeds would be weighed against each other, and based on those deeds they would be either dammed or admitted immediately into heaven. This made death more personal and individual. Ariès notes that the actual moment of death began to gain greater significance, as Christians believed that a person's deathbed behavior and personal reflection on their own deeds, at the moment of death, could influence heavenly judgment. As in the previous era friends and family were often present, but their presence became more closely tied to witnessing the moment before judgment rather than simply witnessing death.\n\nFinally, in this era, depictions of corpses and skeletons became more prevalent, and individual tombs with inscriptions grew in popularity. Although religious artwork had featured macabre themes in the past, by the seventeenth century there was an influx of artwork that featured decaying cadavers and the physical body after death. Ariès argues that this artwork was meant to warn against moral corruption and also express love of life. He states that men of that era felt a \"love of life which we today can scarcely understand\", due to our increased longevity. Ariès also notes that by the thirteenth century individual tombs with inscriptions were becoming more typical, especially for the religious elite and royalty. Although during the Roman period individual graves had not been uncommon, this practice had faded during the middle ages. By the eighteenth century, the middle and lower classes were also likely to have tombs, or at least plaques, marked with individual inscriptions. As people became more conscious of their individual place in the world, their death reflected that awareness \n\nBy the early eighteenth century, Ariès observed an abrupt change in the western person’s attitude toward death. Death was dramatized, exalted, feared, and in some cases worshipped. Looking to themes in artwork from the sixteenth to eighteenth centuries, Ariès argues that death became categorically similar to sex, and was seen as a break from the ordinary. Although the erotic associations with death did not last beyond that short period, he maintains that death was no longer normalized. People did not look at death as a familiar occasion that was part of life, as they had in the past. Although people continued to participate socially and ritualistically in death, and crowds still flocked to the bedside of a dying person, their purpose had changed. Instead of witnessing death, they mourned it.\n\nAlthough mourning was not completely new in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, Ariès argues that it became unregulated. It was less of a ritualized social obligation, and more of a spontaneous and often excessive display of emotions. Ariès maintains that survivors no long accepted the death of friends and loved ones. He states that people of this period lamented that death was such a complete rupture from life and were consoled by preserving the memory of the deceased. Memorializing the dead became an important feature of the period of \"thy death\".\n\nThere was also a renewed interest in burial grounds and grave markers. In the past Christians had been content to relinquish bodies to the care of the church. Even when gravestones became more prevalent, Ariès argues that they were predominantly an expression of individuality or representative of individual donations to the church. However, by the eighteenth century, bodies were buried away from the church in individual cemetery plots, where people felt they could commiserate with the dead and cultivate their memory. Ariès also observes that while all western people celebrated cemeteries and their new role in society, France, Italy, and Germany are known for more elaborate tombs and burial sites when compared to the simplistic style of North America, the UK, and Northwestern Europe. He suggests that this trend is due to economic inequalities; poorer nations were more inclined to build elaborate tombs as a statement against the elegant simplicity that wealthier nations promoted. Ariès also notes that because the countries that favored more ornate tombs were also Catholic, it later became indicative of religion.\n\nThe final period Ariès demarcates in the evolution of western attitudes toward death is the era of \"forbidden death\". Beginning in the very late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, Ariès argues that a \"brutal revolution\" occurred in western attitudes toward death, in which death became both shameful and forbidden. While this trend began in the United States – spreading to England, Northwestern Europe, and eventually the whole of the continent – the bulk of his analysis in this section deals primarily with England and Europe. Growing out of the sentimental era of \"thy death\" in which survivors mourned the death of loved ones openly, spontaneously, and with heightened displays of emotion, it soon became common practice to shield the people actually dying from the reality of their condition. The mourner, so moved by the gravity of death, wished to spare their dying loved one any emotional turmoil. Thus in the era of \"forbidden death\" the dying man no longer presided over his own death. Soon the extreme emotions that survivors expressed in the previous period were replaced with an equally extreme avoidance of death and suppression of emotion that became dominant in twentieth century. Ariès names two societal trends that he believes were very influential on shifting attitudes toward death: the advent of the hospital as a place of dying, and a growing sentiment that life should be, above all, happy.\n\nCiting trends in literature, such as the work of Tolstoy, Ariès argues that the feeling surrounding death changed before its actual rituals did. By 1930–1950, he states that the displacement of the site of death from the home to the hospital accelerated changes in attitude. While for most of history the dying person took his or her last breath in bed, surrounded by loved ones, now, in era of \"forbidden death\" people are more likely to end their lives alone on a hospital bed. Ariès writes that death is in the hospital is often a \"technical cession\" that is predetermined by a hospital team, frequently occurring after the dying person has already lost consciousness. He argues that the moment of death is difficult to distinguish for most survivors because they have already witnessed many \"silent deaths\" as the dying person loses different abilities – from breathing and eating on their own, to verbal communication and eventually consciousness. He states that in this current period there is no great and dramatic act of death, which was what family, friends, and neighbors used to gather together to witness. Ariès writes: \"No one any longer has the strength or patience to wait over a period of weeks for a moment which has lost its meaning.\" Instead, doctors battle against death and when death finally comes it is usually considered a failure of medicine rather than a normal occurrence.\n\nAriès second observation regarding social changes over the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries was that happiness became the expected dominant emotion. He states that people began to believe \"life is always happy or should always seem so.\" Death, being sorrowful and ugly, was therefore denied. Expressing sadness or emotional turmoil, Ariès argues, is likely to be equated with bad manners, mental instability, and unnecessary morbidity. Referencing anthropologist Geoffrey Gorer, Ariès states that death has replaced sex as western society's greatest taboo. Children are less likely to be shielded from the notion of sex in the modern era, but they are not taught about death. When death occurs a child is told the deceased are \"resting\" and every effort is made to distract them from the truth. Ariès also argues that the prevalence of cremation in England and parts of Europe reflects the western world's denial of death. He states that the act of cremation, with its usual lack of formality, associated rituals, and permanent location for remains is the ultimate expression of \"forbidden death\".\n\nAlthough Ariès states that many of the recent trends regarding death originated in the United States, he argues that Americans have a unique death culture that is an amalgamation of the two extreme periods \"thy death\" and \"forbidden death\". He maintains that Americans do deny death as a part of life, and they are equally likely to die alone in a hospital, but once death actually occurs Americans have rituals that are all their own. Embalming became common practice in America by the early to mid-twentieth century, and American funerals are distinguished by the \"wake\" or viewing of the deceased. Ariès maintains that both practices are far less frequent in the rest of the western world. He argues that the embalmed body is not seen as fully dead and Americans believe they can communicate their last words and goodbyes to the deceased at this moment. Funeral directors, he states, market themselves as \"doctors of grief\" who can see people through the period of mourning and return them to normalcy after the rituals of death (funeral, wake, burial/cremation) are complete. In this way, Ariès argues, death is sold like any other consumer good. Ariès concludes by stating that the current consensus toward death is that while we are vaguely aware of it, \"at heart we feel we are nonmortals\".\n\nAriès' \"Western Attitudes Toward Death\" has been applauded in both the field of history and the wider world of academia. Initial reviews celebrated this work as eye-opening, thought-provoking, and the first of its kind. Historian David Stannard, writing for the \"American Historical Review\" noted the book was similar in structure, style and \"panoramic vision\" to Ariès' earlier works in the history of childhood. Like his earlier works, scholars predicted that Ariès would again ignite a new subfield in history.\n\nOne reviewer stated that prior to Ariès’ study of death, scholars almost universally projected their own fear of death onto the historical record, believing revulsion toward death was a static mainstay of western history. Another reviewer congratulated Ariès for his masterful application of the “history of mentalities,” to a shockingly overlooked subject. Although not everyone agreed with the Ariès’ exact methods and conclusions, reviewers acknowledged the history of death as deserving of further study. Philipe Ariès published frequently on the subject for the remainder of his career, including a revision of \"Western Attitudes Toward Death\", titled \"The Hour of Our Death\", which further separated the period he called “One’s Own Death,” into two separate categories: “The Death of Self,” and “Remote and Imminent Death.” This was done to take into consideration certain economic disparities in the period as well as the impact of the Reformation. Ariès works on the history of death are now considered seminal and current historians of death rely heavily on his frameworks.\n\nAlthough Ariès is credited with opening the history of death up to further inquiry, many critics found that his short book spanning over a millennia of subject matter treated the subject too lightly, leaving more questions than answers. He was accused of overgeneralization on a number of counts. Reviewers critiqued his broad treatment of large geographic areas, not accounting for any cultural differences. One critic found that Ariès did not adequately differentiate between rich, poor, rural, and urban groups, and also that he relied to heavily on literature, which can sometimes distort reality. Historians of science and medicine felt their discipline had been overlooked and that changes in medical practice impacted death more than Ariès implied. Roy Porter noted that while Ariès was critical of hospital death, calling it cruel and impersonal, in the nineteenth century many people felt that dying in the care of a doctor was a “good death,” and doctors were heralded for their ability to ease patients’ pain in their final hour. Furthermore, Porter argues that the way people die is very much dependant on the disease they are suffering from, and it is difficult to make comparisons and generalize a single mode of death. Finally, although Ariès periodization of western attitudes toward death was one of his biggest contributions, many critics questioned the periods he established, finding them “vague” or unconvincing.\n\nSince the publication of \"Western Attitudes Toward Death\", Ariès, even by his critics has been hailed “the doyen of the historians of death.” As predicted by early reviewers, Ariès’ work has helped present death as a subject for serious historical inquiry. Generations of historians have since examined attitudes toward death from many vantage points – cultural, racial, socio-economic – providing sharper explanations for attitude shifts in various geographic locations and time periods. The notion of “Forbidden Death” has received particular attention from scholars and critiques of the American funeral industry were popular in the 1960s and 70s. Jessica Mitford’s \"The American Way of Death\" exposed high profit margins for funeral directors and the large manufacturers that supply the material necessities related to burial (caskets, grave markers, etc.) Similarly, Ivan Illich, a well-known critic of modern medicine, devoted a chapter in his famed work \"Medical Nemesis\" to the horrors of hospital death. This chapter, he states “leans heavily on the masterful essays by Philippe Ariès.\" Although many historians have commented on Ariès’ depiction of hospital death, few have commented on Ariès’ notion that the modern age is oppressed by its obsession with happiness. Historian Gary Laderman agreed that death has become a “forbidden” subject in recent years, but challenged Ariès, stating: “perhaps the experience of two world wars, particularly the mass destruction of the holocaust in Europe and the dropping of the atomic bomb in Japan, contributed to this reticence to discuss the subject.\"\n\nAmerican historians, in the years that followed the publication of Western Attitudes Toward Death, became particularly interested in the deviation Ariès noted between Americans and Europeans. David Stannard, an early reviewer of Ariès’ work, penned \"The Puritan Way of Death\" a few short years after Ariès' publication. He maintained that American religious practices strongly influenced their attitudes toward death. While he hoped to clarify some of the comments Ariès made about changes in American attitudes, he applauded Ariès seminal work as both “profound and insightful.” Although \"Western Attitudes Toward Death\" has been heavily critiqued, historians of death have venerated it as a classic and foundational work on the subject.\n"}

{"id": "8455187", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8455187", "title": "Xian (Taoism)", "text": "Xian (Taoism)\n\nXian () is a Chinese word for an enlightened person, translatable in English as:\n\"Xian\" semantically developed from meaning spiritual \"immortality; enlightenment\", to physical \"immortality; longevity\" involving methods such as alchemy, breath meditation, and tai chi, and eventually to legendary and figurative \"immortality\".\n\nThe \"xian\" archetype is described by Victor H. Mair.\n\nThey are immune to heat and cold, untouched by the elements, and can fly, mounting upward with a fluttering motion. They dwell apart from the chaotic world of man, subsist on air and dew, are not anxious like ordinary people, and have the smooth skin and innocent faces of children. The transcendents live an effortless existence that is best described as spontaneous. They recall the ancient Indian ascetics and holy men known as \"ṛṣi\" who possessed similar traits.1994:376 \n\nAccording to the Digital Dictionary of Buddhism, Chinese \"xian\" (仙) can mean Sanskrit \"ṛṣi\" (\"rishi\" \"inspired sage in the Vedas\").\n\nThe most famous Chinese compound of \"xiān\" is \"Bāxiān\" (八仙 \"the Eight Immortals\"). Other common words include \"xiānrén\" (仙人 sennin in Japanese, \"immortal person; transcendent\", see \"Xiānrén Dòng\"), \"xiānrénzhăng\" (仙人掌 \"immortal's palm; cactus\"), \"xiānnǚ\" (仙女 \"immortal woman; female celestial; angel\"), and \"shénxiān\" (神仙 \"gods and immortals; divine immortal\"). Besides humans, \"xiān\" can also refer to supernatural animals. The mythological \"húlijīng\" 狐狸精 (lit. \"fox spirit\") \"fox fairy; vixen; witch; enchantress\" has an alternate name of \"húxiān\" 狐仙 (lit. \"fox immortal\").\n\nThe etymology of \"xiān\" remains uncertain. The circa 200 CE \"Shiming\", a Chinese dictionary that provided word-pun \"etymologies\", defines \"xiān\" (仙) as \"to get old and not die,\" and explains it as someone who \"qiān\" (遷 \"moves into\") the mountains.\"\n\nEdward H. Schafer (1966:204) defined \"xian\" as \"transcendent, sylph (a being who, through alchemical, gymnastic and other disciplines, has achieved a refined and perhaps immortal body, able to fly like a bird beyond the trammels of the base material world into the realms of aether, and nourish himself on air and dew.)\" Schafer noted \"xian\" was cognate to \"xian\" 䙴 \"soar up\", \"qian\" 遷 \"remove\", and \"xianxian\" 僊僊 \"a flapping dance movement\"; and compared Chinese \"yuren\" 羽人 \"feathered man; \"xian\"\" with English peri \"a fairy or supernatural being in Persian mythology\" (Persian pari from \"par\" \"feather; wing\").\n\nTwo linguistic hypotheses for the etymology of \"xian\" involve Arabic and Sino-Tibetan languages. Wu and Davis (1935:224) suggested the source was \"jinn\", or \"jinni\" \"genie\" (from Arabic \"جني\" \"jinnī\"). \"The marvelous powers of the \"Hsien\" are so like those of the \"jinni\" of the Arabian Nights that one wonders whether the Arabic word, \"jinn\", may not be derived from the Chinese \"Hsien\".\" Axel Schuessler's etymological dictionary (2007:527) suggests a Sino-Tibetan connection between \"xiān\" (Old Chinese *\"san\" or *\"sen\") \"'An immortal' ... men and women who attain supernatural abilities; after death they become immortals and deities who can fly through the air\" and Tibetan \"gšen\" < \"g-syen\" \"shaman, one who has supernatural abilities, incl[uding] travel through the air\".\n\nThe word \"xiān\" is written with three characters , , or , which combine the logographic \"radical\" \"rén\" (人 or 亻 \"person; human\") with two \"phonetic\" elements (see Chinese character classification). The oldest recorded \"xiān\" character 僊 has a \"xiān\" (\"rise up; ascend\") phonetic supposedly because immortals could \"ascend into the heavens\". (Compare \"qiān\" 遷 \"move; transfer; change\" combining this phonetic and the motion radical.) The usual modern \"xiān\" character 仙, and its rare variant 仚, have a \"shān\" (山 \"mountain\") phonetic. For a character analysis, Schipper (1993:164) interprets \"'the human being of the mountain,' or alternatively, 'human mountain.' The two explanations are appropriate to these beings: they haunt the holy mountains, while also embodying nature.\"\n\nThe \"Classic of Poetry\" (220/3) contains the oldest occurrence of the character 僊, reduplicated as \"xiānxiān\" (僊僊 \"dance lightly; hop about; jump around\"), and rhymed with \"qiān\" (遷). \"But when they have drunk too much, Their deportment becomes light and frivolous—They leave their seats, and [遷] go elsewhere, They keep [僊僊] dancing and capering.\" (tr. James Legge) Needham and Wang (1956:134) suggest \"xian\" was cognate with \"wu\" 巫 \"shamanic\" dancing. Paper (1995:55) writes, \"the function of the term \"xian\" in a line describing dancing may be to denote the height of the leaps. Since, \"to live for a long time\" has no etymological relation to \"xian\", it may be a later accretion.\"\n\nThe 121 CE \"Shuowen Jiezi\", the first important dictionary of Chinese characters, does not enter 仙 except in the definition for ( \"name of an ancient immortal\"). It defines 僊 as \"live long and move away\" and 仚 as \"appearance of a person on a mountaintop\".\n\nThis section chronologically reviews how Chinese texts describe \"xian\" \"immortals; transcendents\". While the early \"Zhuangzi\", \"Chuci\", and \"Liezi\" texts allegorically used \"xian\" immortals and magic islands to describe spiritual immortality, later ones like the \"Shenxian zhuan\" and \"Baopuzi\" took immortality literally and described esoteric Chinese alchemical techniques for physical longevity. On one the hand, \"neidan\" (內丹 \"internal alchemy\") techniques included \"taixi\" (胎息 \"embryo respiration\") breath control, meditation, visualization, sexual training, and Tao Yin exercises (which later evolved into Qigong and T'ai chi ch'uan). On the other hand, \"waidan\" (外丹 \"external alchemy\") techniques for immortality included alchemical recipes, magic plants, rare minerals, herbal medicines, drugs, and dietetic techniques like inedia.\n\nThe earliest representations of Chinese immortals, dating from the Han Dynasty, portray them flying with feathery wings (the word \"yuren\" 羽人 \"feathered person\" later meant \"Daoist\") or riding dragons. In Chinese art, \"xian\" are often pictured with symbols of immortality including the dragon, crane, fox, white deer, pine tree, peach, and mushroom. \nBesides the following major Chinese texts, many others use both graphic variants of \"xian\". \"Xian\" (仙) occurs in the \"Chunqiu Fanlu\", \"Fengsu Tongyi\", \"Qian fu lun\", \"Fayan\", and \"Shenjian\"; \"xian\" (僊) occurs in the \"Caizhong langji\", \"Fengsu Tongyi\", \"Guanzi\", and \"Shenjian\".\n\nTwo circa 3rd century BCE \"Outer Chapters\" of the \"Zhuangzi\" (莊子 \"[Book of] Master Zhuang\") use the archaic character \"xian\" 僊. Chapter 11 has a parable about \"Cloud Chief\" (雲 將)  and \"Big Concealment\" (鴻濛) that uses the \"Shijing\" compound \"xianxian\" (\"dance; jump\"):\nBig Concealment said, \"If you confuse the constant strands of Heaven and violate the true form of things, then Dark Heaven will reach no fulfillment. Instead, the beasts will scatter from their herds, the birds will cry all night, disaster will come to the grass and trees, misfortune will reach even to the insects. Ah, this is the fault of men who 'govern'!\"<br>\"Then what should I do?\" said Cloud Chief.<br>\"Ah,\" said Big Concealment, \"you are too far gone! [僊僊] Up, up, stir yourself and be off!\"<br>Cloud Chief said, \"Heavenly Master, it has been hard indeed for me to meet with you—I beg one word of instruction!\"<br>\"Well, then—mind‑nourishment!\" said Big Concealment. \"You have only to rest in inaction and things will transform themselves. Smash your form and body, spit out hearing and eyesight, forget you are a thing among other things, and you may join in great unity with the deep and boundless. Undo the mind, slough off spirit, be blank and soulless, and the ten thousand things one by one will return to the root—return to the root and not know why. Dark and undifferentiated chaos—to the end of life none will depart from it. But if you try to know it, you have already departed from it. Do not ask what its name is, do not try to observe its form. Things will live naturally end of themselves.\"<br>Cloud Chief said, \"The Heavenly Master has favored me with this Virtue, instructed me in this Silence. All my life I have been looking for it, and now at last I have it!\" He bowed his head twice, stood up, took his leave, and went away. (11, tr. Burton Watson 1968:122-3)\n\nChapter 12 uses \"xian\" when mythical Emperor Yao describes a \"shengren\" (聖 人 \"sagely person\").\nThe true sage is a quail at rest, a little fledgling at its meal, a bird in flight who leaves no trail behind. When the world has the Way, he joins in the chorus with all other things. When the world is without the Way, he nurses his Virtue and retires in leisure. And after a thousand years, should he weary of the world, he will leave it and [上] ascend to [僊] the immortals, riding on those white clouds all the way up to the village of God. (12, tr. Watson 1968:130)\n\nWithout using the word \"xian\", several \"Zhuangzi\" passages employ \"xian\" imagery, like flying in the clouds, to describe individuals with superhuman powers. For example, Chapter 1, within the circa 3rd century BCE \"Inner Chapters\", has two portrayals. First is this description of Liezi (below).\nLieh Tzu could ride the wind and go soaring around with cool and breezy skill, but after fifteen days he came back to earth. As far as the search for good fortune went, he didn't fret and worry. He escaped the trouble of walking, but he still had to depend on something to get around. If he had only mounted on the truth of Heaven and Earth, ridden the changes of the six breaths, and thus wandered through the boundless, then what would he have had to depend on? Therefore, I say, the Perfect Man has no self; the Holy Man has no merit; the Sage has no fame. (1, tr. Watson 1968:32) \n\nSecond is this description of a \"shenren\" (神人 \"divine person\").\nHe said that there is a Holy Man living on faraway [姑射] Ku-she Mountain, with skin like ice or snow, and gentle and shy like a young girl. He doesn't eat the five grains, but sucks the wind, drinks the dew, climbs up on the clouds and mist, rides a flying dragon, and wanders beyond the Four Seas. By concentrating his spirit, he can protect creatures from sickness and plague and make the harvest plentiful. (1, tr. Watson 1968:33) \n\nThe authors of the \"Zhuangzi\" had a lyrical view of life and death, seeing them as complimentary aspects of natural changes. This is antithetical to the physical immortality (\"changshengbulao\" 長生不老 \"live forever and never age\") sought by later Daoist alchemists. Consider this famous passage about accepting death.\nChuang Tzu's wife died. When Hui Tzu went to convey his condolences, he found Chuang Tzu sitting with his legs sprawled out, pounding on a tub and singing. \"You lived with her, she brought up your children and grew old,\" said Hui Tzu. \"It should be enough simply not to weep at her death. But pounding on a tub and singing—this is going too far, isn't it?\"\n\nChuang Tzu said, \"You're wrong. When she first died, do you think I didn't grieve like anyone else? But I looked back to her beginning and the time before she was born. Not only the time before she was born, but the time before she had a body. Not only the time before she had a body, but the time before she had a spirit. In the midst of the jumble of wonder and mystery a change took place and she had a spirit. Another change and she had a body. Another change and she was born. Now there's been another change and she's dead. It's just like the progression of the four seasons, spring, summer, fall, winter.\"<br>\"Now she's going to lie down peacefully in a vast room. If I were to follow after her bawling and sobbing, it would show that I don't understand anything about fate. So I stopped. (18, tr. Watson 1968:191–2) \n\nAlan Fox explains this anecdote about Zhuangzi's wife.\nMany conclusions can be reached on the basis of this story, but it seems that death is regarded as a natural part of the ebb and flow of transformations which constitute the movement of Dao. To grieve over death, or to fear one's own death, for that matter, is to arbitrarily evaluate what is inevitable. Of course, this reading is somewhat ironic given the fact that much of the subsequent Daoist tradition comes to seek longevity and immortality, and bases some of their basic models on the \"Zhuangzi\". (1995:100) \n\nThe 3rd-2nd century BCE \"Chuci\" (楚辭 \"Lyrics of Chu\") anthology of poems uses \"xian\" 仙 once and \"xian\" 僊 twice, reflecting the disparate origins of the text. These three contexts mention the legendary Daoist \"xian\" immortals Chi Song (赤松 \"Red Pine\", see Kohn 1993:142–4) and Wang Qiao (王僑, or Zi Qiao 子僑). In later Daoist hagiography, Chi Song was Lord of Rain under Shennong, the legendary inventor of agriculture; and Wang Qiao was a son of King Ling of Zhou (r. 571–545 BCE), who flew away on a giant white bird, became an immortal and was never again seen.\n\nThe \"Yuan You\" (遠遊 \"Far-off Journey\") poem describes a spiritual journey into the realms of gods and immortals, frequently referring to Daoist myths and techniques.\nMy spirit darted forth and did not return to me,<br>And my body, left tenantless, grew withered and lifeless.<br>Then I looked into myself to strengthen my resolution,<br>And sought to learn from where the primal spirit issues.<br>In emptiness and silence I found serenity;<br>In tranquil inaction I gained true satisfaction.<br>I heard how once Red Pine had washed the world's dust off:<br>I would model myself on the pattern he had left me.<br>I honoured the wondrous powers of the [真人] Pure Ones,<br>And those of past ages who had become [仙] Immortals.<br>They departed in the flux of change and vanished from men's sight,<br>Leaving a famous name that endures after them. (tr. Hawkes 1985:194) \n\nThe \"Xi shi\" (惜誓 \"Sorrow for Troth Betrayed\") resembles the \"Yuan You\", and both reflect Daoist ideas from the Han period. \"Though unoriginal in theme,\" says Hawkes (1985:239), \"its description of air travel, written in a pre-aeroplane age, is exhilarating and rather impressive.\"\nWe gazed down of the Middle Land [China] with its myriad people<br>As we rested on the whirlwind, drifting about at random.<br>In this way we came at last to the moor of Shao-yuan:<br>There, with the other blessed ones, were Red Pine and Wang Qiao.<br>The two Masters held zithers tuned in perfect concord:<br>I sang the Qing Shang air to their playing.<br>In tranquil calm and quiet enjoyment,<br>Gently I floated, inhaling all the essences.<br>But then I thought that this immortal life of [僊] the blessed,<br>Was not worth the sacrifice of my home-returning. (tr. Hawkes 1985:240) \n\nThe \"Ai shi ming\" (哀時命 \"Alas That My Lot Was Not Cast\") describes a celestial journey similar to the previous two.\nFar and forlorn, with no hope of return:<br>Sadly I gaze in the distance, over the empty plain.<br>Below, I fish in the valley streamlet;<br>Above, I seek out [僊] holy hermits.<br>I enter into friendship with Red Pine;<br>I join Wang Qiao as his companion.\nWe send the Xiao Yang in front to guide us;<br>The White Tiger runs back and forth in attendance.<br>Floating on the cloud and mist, we enter the dim height of heaven;<br>Riding on the white deer we sport and take our pleasure. tr. Hawkes 1985:266) \n\nThe \"Li Sao\" (離騷 \"On Encountering Trouble\"), the most famous \"Chuci\" poem, is usually interpreted as describing ecstatic flights and trance techniques of Chinese shamans. The above three poems are variations describing Daoist \"xian\".\n\nSome other \"Chuci\" poems refer to immortals with synonyms of \"xian\". For instance, \"Shou zhi\" (守志 \"Maintaining Resolution), uses \"zhenren\" (真人 \"true person\", tr. \"Pure Ones\" above in \"Yuan You\"), which Wang Yi's commentary glosses as \"zhen xianren\" (真仙人 \"true immortal person\").\nI visited Fu Yue, bestriding a dragon,<br>Joined in marriage with the Weaving Maiden,<br>Lifted up Heaven's Net to capture evil,<br>Drew the Bow of Heaven to shoot at wickedness,<br>Followed the [真人] Immortals fluttering through the sky,<br>Ate of the Primal Essence to prolong my life. (tr. Hawkes 1985:318) \n\nThe \"Liezi\" (列子 \"[Book of] Master Lie\"), which Louis Komjathy (2004:36) says \"was probably compiled in the 3rd century CE (while containing earlier textual layers)\", uses \"xian\" four times, always in the compound \"xiansheng\" (仙聖 \"immortal sage\").\n\nNearly half of Chapter 2 (\"The Yellow Emperor\") comes from the \"Zhuangzi\", including this recounting of the above fable about Mount Gushe (姑射, or Guye, or Miao Gushe 藐姑射).\nThe Ku-ye mountains stand on a chain of islands where the Yellow River enters the sea. Upon the mountains there lives a Divine Man, who inhales the wind and drinks the dew, and does not eat the five grains. His mind is like a bottomless spring, his body is like a virgin's. He knows neither intimacy nor love, yet [仙聖] immortals and sages serve him as ministers. He inspires no awe, he is never angry, yet the eager and diligent act as his messengers. He is without kindness and bounty, but others have enough by themselves; he does not store and save, but he himself never lacks. The Yin and Yang are always in tune, the sun and moon always shine, the four seasons are always regular, wind and rain are always temperate, breeding is always timely, the harvest is always rich, and there are no plagues to ravage the land, no early deaths to afflict men, animals have no diseases, and ghosts have no uncanny echoes. (tr. Graham 1960:35) \n\nChapter 5 uses \"xiansheng\" three times in a conversation set between legendary rulers Tang (湯) of the Shang Dynasty and Ji (革) of the Xia Dynasty.\nT'ang asked again: 'Are there large things and small, long and short, similar and different?'<br>—'To the East of the Gulf of Chih-li, who knows how many thousands and millions of miles, there is a deep ravine, a valley truly without bottom; and its bottomless underneath is named \"The Entry to the Void\". The waters of the eight corners and the nine regions, the stream of the Milky Way, all pour into it, but it neither shrinks nor grows. Within it there are five mountains, called Tai-yü, Yüan-chiao, Fang-hu, Ying-chou and P'eng-Iai. These mountains are thirty thousand miles high, and as many miles round; the tablelands on their summits extend for nine thousand miles. It is seventy thousand miles from one mountain to the next, but they are considered close neighbours. The towers and terraces upon them are all gold and jade, the beasts and birds are all unsullied white; trees of pearl and garnet always grow densely, flowering and bearing fruit which is always luscious, and those who eat of it never grow old and die. The men who dwell there are all of the race of [仙聖] immortal sages, who fly, too many to be counted, to and from one mountain to another in a day and a night. Yet the bases of the five mountains used to rest on nothing; they were always rising and falling, going and returning, with the ebb and flow of the tide, and never for a moment stood firm. The [仙聖] immortals found this troublesome, and complained about it to God. God was afraid that they would drift to the far West and he would lose the home of his sages. So he commanded Yü-ch'iang to make fifteen [鼇] giant turtles carry the five mountains on their lifted heads, taking turns in three watches, each sixty thousand years long; and for the first time the mountains stood firm and did not move.<br>'But there was a giant from the kingdom of the Dragon Earl, who came to the place of the five mountains in no more than a few strides. In one throw he hooked six of the turtles in a bunch, hurried back to his country carrying them together on his back, and scorched their bones to tell fortunes by the cracks. Thereupon two of the mountains, Tai-yü and Yüan-chiao, drifted to the far North and sank in the great sea; the [仙聖] immortals who were carried away numbered many millions. God was very angry, and reduced by degrees the size of the Dragon Earl's kingdom and the height of his subjects. At the time of Fu-hsi and Shen-nung, the people of this country were still several hundred feet high.' (tr. Graham 1960:97–8) \n\nPenglai Mountain became the most famous of these five mythical peaks where the elixir of life supposedly grew, and is known as Horai in Japanese legends. The first emperor Qin Shi Huang sent his court alchemist Xu Fu on expeditions to find these plants of immortality, but he never returned (although by some accounts, he discovered Japan).\n\nHolmes Welch (1957:88–97) analyzed the beginnings of Daoism, sometime around the 4th-3rd centuries BCE, from four separate streams: philosophical Daoism (Laozi, Zhuangzi, Liezi), a \"hygiene school\" that cultivated longevity through breathing exercises and yoga, Chinese alchemy and Five Elements philosophy, and those who sought Penglai and elixirs of \"immortality\". This is what he concludes about \"xian\".\nIt is my own opinion, therefore, that though the word \"hsien\", or Immortal, is used by Chuang Tzu and Lieh Tzu, and though they attributed to their idealized individual the magic powers that were attributed to the \"hsien\" in later times, nonetheless the \"hsien\" ideal was something they did not believe in—either that it was possible or that it was good. The magic powers are allegories and hyperboles for the \"natural\" powers that come from identification with Tao. Spiritualized Man, P'eng-lai, and the rest are features of a \"genre\" which is meant to entertain, disturb, and exalt us, not to be taken as literal hagiography. Then and later, the philosophical Taoists were distinguished from all other schools of Taoism by their rejection of the pursuit of immortality. As we shall see, their books came to be adopted as scriptural authority by those who did practice magic and seek to become immortal. But it was their misunderstanding of philosophical Taoism that was the reason they adopted it. (Welch 1957:95) \n\nThe \"Shenxian zhuan\" (神仙傳 Biographies of Spirit Immortals\") is a hagiography of \"xian\". Although it was traditionally attributed to Ge Hong (283–343 CE), Komjathy (2004:43) says, \"The received versions of the text contain some 100-odd hagiographies, most of which date from 6th-8th centuries at the earliest.\"\n\nAccording to the \"Shenxian zhuan\", there are four schools of immortality:\n\nQì (气—“energy”): Breath control and meditation. Those who belong to this school can\n\n\"...blow on water and it will flow against its own current for several paces; blow on fire, and it will be extinguished; blow at tigers or wolves, and they will crouch down and not be able to move; blow at serpents, and they will coil up and be unable to flee. If someone is wounded by a weapon, blow on the wound, and the bleeding will stop. If you hear of someone who has suffered a poisonous insect bite, even if you are not in his presence, you can, from a distance, blow and say in incantation over your own hand (males on the left hand, females on the right), and the person will at once be healed even if more than a hundred li away. And if you yourself are struck by a sudden illness, you have merely to swallow pneumas in three series of nine, and you will immediately recover.<br>But the most essential thing [among such arts] is fetal breathing. Those who obtain [the technique of] fetal breathing become able to breathe without using their nose or mouth, as if in the womb, and this is the culmination of the way [of pneumatic cultivation].\" (Campany 2002:21) \n\nFàn (饭—“Diet”): Ingestion of herbal compounds and abstention from the \"Sān Shī Fàn\" (三尸饭—“Three-Corpses food”)—Meats (raw fish, pork, dog, leeks, and scallions) and grains. The \"Shenxian zhuan\" uses this story to illustrate the importance of \"bigu\" \"grain avoidance\":\n\"During the reign of Emperor Cheng of the Han, hunters in the Zhongnan Mountains saw a person who wore no clothes, his body covered with black hair. Upon seeing this person, the hunters wanted to pursue and capture him, but the person leapt over gullies and valleys as if in flight, and so could not be overtaken. [But after being surrounded and captured, it was discovered this person was a 200 plus year old woman, who had once been a concubine of Qin Emperor Ziying. When he had surrendered to the 'invaders of the east', she fled into the mountains where she learned to subside on 'the resin and nuts of pines' from an old man. Afterwards, this diet 'enabled [her] to feel neither hunger nor thirst; in winter [she] was not cold, in summer [she] was not hot.']<br>The hunters took the woman back in. They offered her grain to eat. When she first smelled the stink of grain, she vomited, and only after several days could she tolerate it. After little more than two years of this [diet], her body hair fell out; she turned old and died. Had she not been caught by men, she would have become a transcendent.\" (Campany 2002:22–23) \n\nFángzhōng Zhī Shù (房中之术—“Arts of the Bedchamber”): Sexual yoga. (Campany 2002:30–31) According to a discourse between the Yellow Emperor and the immortaless \"Sùnǚ\" (素女—“Plain Girl”), one of the three daughters of Hsi Wang Mu,\n\nThe \"White Tigress (Zhuang Li Quan Pure Angelic Metal Ajna Empress \"Toppest\") Manual\", a treatise on female sexual yoga, states,\n\nDān (丹—\"Alchemy\", literally \"Cinnabar\"): Elixir of Immortality.(Campany 2002:31)\n\nThe 4th century CE \"Baopuzi\" (抱朴子 \"[Book of] Master Embracing Simplicity\"), which was written by Ge Hong, gives some highly detailed descriptions of \"xian\".\n\nThe text lists three classes of immortals:\n\n\nThese titles were usually given to humans who had either not proven themselves worthy of or were not fated to become immortals. One such famous agent was Fei Changfang, who was eventually murdered by evil spirits because he lost his book of magic talismans. However, some immortals are written to have used this method in order to escape execution. (Campany 2002:52–60)\n\nGe Hong wrote in his book \"The Master Who Embraces Simplicity\",\nThe [immortals] Dark Girl and Plain Girl compared sexual activity as the intermingling of fire [yang/male] and water [yin/female], claiming that water and fire can kill people but can also regenerate their life, depending on whether or not they know the correct methods of sexual activity according to their nature. These arts are based on the theory that the more females a man copulates with, the greater benefit he will derive from the act. Men who are ignorant of this art, copulating with only one or two females during their life, will only suffice to bring about their untimely and early death. (Hsi 2001:48) \n\nThe \"Zhong Lü Chuan Dao Ji\" (鐘呂傳道集/钟吕传道集 \"Anthology of the Transmission of the Dao from Zhong[li Quan] to Lü [Dongbin]\") is associated with Zhongli Quan (2nd century CE?) and Lü Dongbin (9th century CE), two of the legendary Eight Immortals. It is part of the so-called “Zhong-Lü” (鍾呂) textual tradition of internal alchemy (\"neidan\"). Komjathy (2004:57) describes it as, \"Probably dating from the late Tang (618–906), the text is in question-and-answer format, containing a dialogue between Lü and his teacher Zhongli on aspects of alchemical terminology and methods.\"\n\nThe \"Zhong Lü Chuan Dao Ji\" lists five classes of immortals:\n\n\nThe \"Śūraṅgama Sūtra\", in an approach to Taoist teachings, discusses the characteristics of ten types of \"xian\" who exist between the world of devas (\"gods\") and that of human beings. This position, in Buddhist literature, is usually occupied by asuras (\"Titans\", \"antigods\"). These \"xian\" are not considered true cultivators of \"samadhi\" (\"unification of mind\"), as their methods differ from the practice of \"dhyāna\" (\"meditation\").\n\n\n\n\n"}
