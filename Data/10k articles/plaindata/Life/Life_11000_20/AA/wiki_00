Set in the distant future, the series follows three space probes that have gained sentience and watch humanity play an evolved form of American football, in which games can be played for millennia over distances of thousands of miles. The series debuted on July 5, 2017, and new chapters were published daily until the series concluded ten days later with its twenty-fifth chapter on July 15.\n\nBois began developing \"17776\" in 2016. Because the story incorporates text, animated GIFs, still images, and videos hosted on YouTube, new tools were developed to allow it to be hosted efficiently on the SB Nation website. The work explores themes of consciousness, hope, despair, and why humans play sports. \"17776\" was well received by critics, who praised it for its innovative use of its medium and for the depth of emotion it evoked. In 2018, the story won a National Magazine Award for Digital Innovation and was longlisted for a Hugo Award for Best Graphic Story.\n\nThe story takes place on an Earth where humans stopped dying, aging, and being born in 2026. All social ills were subsequently eliminated, and technology preventing humans from any injury was developed. In the United States, American football evolved to include new rules, including those that allow fields thousands of miles long, hundreds of in-game players, and games millennia long. Over time, computers gained sentience due to constant exposure to broadcast human data.\n\nBy the year 17776, the space probe \"Pioneer 9\" (called Nine) has gained sentience and made contact with \"Pioneer 10\" (called Ten) and the Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer (called Juice). As Nine adjusts to a world radically different from that of the 20th century, the three space probes watch multiple football games occurring across the United States: a game using the entirety of Nebraska as a field in which the next point scored wins the game; a game in which players strive to possess every existing football signed by Koy Detmer; a game played between the Canadian border and the Mexican border deadlocked for 13,000 years at the bottom of a gorge in Arizona; an NFL regulation game between the Denver Broncos and the Pittsburgh Steelers that changed over 15,000 years into 58 playing teams owning and capitalizing upon portions of the field while the ball is lost; a 500 game that results in the destruction of the Centennial Light; and a game in which the possessing player is attempting to score an automatic win by hiding in his team's end zone for 10,000 years.\n\n\"17776\" is read by scrolling through pages occupied by large GIF images and colored dialogue text, interspersed with occasional YouTube videos. The story is divided into chapters, which were originally published in daily installments between July 5 and July 15, 2017.\n\nBois wrote and illustrated \"17776\" for Vox Media's sports news website SB Nation, of which he is creative director. Aside from \"17776\", Bois produces two other recurring, humorous video essay programs for the site: \"Pretty Good\", which focuses on unusual sports topics and stories, and \"Chart Party\", which focuses on statistics and has an emphasis on Bois' use of visual art in his journalism and storytelling. Bois is also known for the \"Breaking Madden\" series, in which he attempted unusual scenarios in the \"Madden NFL\" series of video games.\n\nIn early 2016, Bois began developing an \"anti-sci fi\" project as a possible sequel to \"The Tim Tebow CFL Chronicles\", an earlier work for SB Nation, and set the story in a year far enough in the future that \"nobody ever thinks about it.\" Although he liked the concept and the visuals, he believed the project would not connect with readers and shelved it. Later, he realized that the story needed a centering character; he wrote one in the form of a small town, AM radio talk show host before coming up with the characters of the probes. Development renewed in May 2016, and the project solidified after SB Nation published its article \"The Future of Football.\" Bois described it as the biggest project he ever attempted.\n\nThe series was developed by Graham MacAree, who used a Vox Media tool that creates custom packages from standard article sets to give Bois creative leeway and to accommodate the series' weight on the SB Nation website. MacAree found that there were few resources online for achieving the desired effects.\n\nBois has stated that he had \"conceived [\"17776\"] to give the reader a good time,\" asserting that this \"was literally the whole point.\"\n\nWilliam Hughes writing for \"The A.V. Club\" described \"17776\" as concerned with why humans play sports: \"That is, given the massive resources, time, and information at our disposal (not to mention those available to our descendants), why does communal game-playing still hold such an important place in society?\" He also listed consciousness, hope, and despair as among the work's themes. Beth Elderkin of \"io9\" described it as \"a deep thought experiment into what we consider humanly possible\". She also felt that Ten and Juice take on the role of angel and devil, and she suggested the two may be unreliable narrators. Ian Crouch of \"The New Yorker\" felt that the work had a \"tonal echo\" of Don DeLillo's 1972 novel \"End Zone\" due to thematic similarities \"with the way that the order and logic of football might act as a counterbalance to the chaos of the real world\".\n\nAccording to the communications director at Vox Media, \"17776\" garnered over 2.3 million pageviews by July 10. Two days later it had received more than 2.9 million pageviews. Average engagement time was over nine minutes, and 43 percent of readers finished each installment of the series published by July 7. On July 19, Bois claimed that \"17776\" received 700,000 unique visitors and 4 million total pageviews, with an average engagement time of 11 minutes.\n\nThu-Huong Ha described \"17776\" as \"part Italo Calvino, part Peter Heller [author of \"The Dog Stars\"], with humor seemingly from within the depths of Reddit,\" saying that the story would appeal to fans of both sports and literature. Tor.com described the first chapter as full of tension and felt that receiving answers is a \"surprisingly heartbreaking\" experience \"lessened by a gleeful bouncing immaturity\" one would not expect from the characters. Beth Elderkin at \"io9\" said the series is \"akin to \"Homestuck\"\" and described it as \"weird, complex, and pretty spectacular\". William Hughes writing for \"The A.V. Club\" felt that \"17776\" is a \"truly innovative piece of work\". After reading the first three chapters, Agatha French of the \"Los Angeles Times\" stated that she was \"impressed and excited by the innovation\" of what she saw, and that she was intrigued despite not knowing what the work is or is saying. She felt the work took full advantage of its online medium and suggested that it \"may also be a glimpse into the future of reading on the Internet\". Ian Crouch of \"The New Yorker\" described the series as, \"despite its seemingly meagre parts, a thing of startling beauty\". Of the chapters published by July 12, he felt \"the most striking chapter\" to be one that utilized audio of Verne Lundquist calling the end of a 2013 game between the University of Alabama and Auburn University over a video panning over Earth. He also noted that the series was compared to \"Homestuck\" and relayed additional comparisons to Thomas Pynchon novels and \"a Reddit thread hijacked by robot trolls\".\n\nThe series won a National Magazine Award for Digital Innovation from the American Society of Magazine Editors for the story and its delivery. It was also longlisted for the Hugo Award for Best Graphic Story in 2018, ultimately finishing in 11th place.\n\n"}

Annette Laming studied philosophy in Paris until World War II began. She then turned to teaching while participating in the French Resistance. After the war, she studied archaeology and specialized in cave art, her doctoral thesis, done under the supervision of André Leroi-Gourhan, \"La Signification de l’art rupestre paléolithique\" (published in 1962),dismissed the various, too creative theories of its predecessors, and, with them, any residual nineteenth-century prejudice or romance about the \"primitive\" mind. Laming-Emperaire's structuralist methodology is still in use, much facilitated by computer science. It involves compiling minutely detailed inventories and diagrams of the way that species are grouped on the cave walls; of their gender, frequency, and position; and of their relation to the signs and handprints that often appear close to them.\n\nShe married a fellow archeologist, Joseph Emperaire, a student of Paul Rivet, who believed humans had come to South America from South Asia before reaching North America, and they began digging, looking for signs of early human occupation, in Brazil, Argentina, and Chile, where Joseph died when the wall of an excavation fell in on him. In the early 1970s, she returned to Brazil and selected six sites in the Lagoa Santa area, where the Danish paleontologist Peter Wilhelm Lund had dug a century earlier. She found a rock shelter at site IV where in 1974-1975 she discovered most of the fat bones of what was named Lapa Vermelha IV hominid 1, the oldest human fossil in Brazil, around 11 thousand years old. The skull was given the nickname Luzia. \"Shortly after that, Annette Laming-Emperaire too died tragically. She went on a vacation in 1976 to the Brazilian state of Paraná, and was asphyxiated in her shower by a defective gas heating element.\" After her death, work at the site ceased until her assistant Andre Prous (who became a professor at UFMG) returned to Lapa Vermelha IV in 1979 to take over the project.\n\nA memorial by a colleague called her \"un des esprits les plus riches et les plus féconds de la recherche préhistorique française\" ['one of the richest and most fertile spirits of French prehistoric research'].\n\nThe passage of the French researcher at region of Lagoa Santa, which includes, in addition to Lagoa Santa and Pedro Leopoldo, the municipalities of Matozinhos, Capim Branco, Vespasiano, Confins, Funilândia and Prudente de Morais, are at the Archeology Center Annette Laming Emperaire (Caale), of the Municipality of Lagoa Santa, in operation for 35 years. In Annette's team were researchers from the National Museum, where thousands of ceramic, lytic fragments and bones found in the excavations. The Franco-Brazilian mission in Lagoa Santa, under the auspices of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (Unesco), remained in the region between 1974 and 1976 and concentrated the excavations mainly in the Lapa Vermelha de Pedro Leopoldo. It was in this cave that Annette found \"Luzia\". In 1998, the \"first Brazilian\", as it entered the history, gained a face. When surveying collections of fossils in the museum, anthropologist Walter Neves, from the University of São Paulo (USP), made in-depth studies on the bones and provided the dating, which is 11,400 years. One of the great merits of the Franco-Brazilian mission, according to experts, was to rescue in the world scientific scenario the importance of Lagoa Santa, where Dr. Lund, in more than four decades, collected more than 12 thousand fossils, which were sent in 1845, to the King of Denmark. After Lund, the region, in the Lagoa Santa Cárstica Environmental Preservation Area (APA Cárstica), only attracted new glances in the 1950s, when researchers from the Minas Gerais Academy of Sciences and the National Museum in Rio de Janeiro resumed the excavations.\n\n\n"}

She was the second daughter of Archduke Albert, Duke of Teschen and Princess Hildegard of Bavaria (1825–1864).\n\nHer forenames were derived from her mother's sisters, Mathilde, Grand Duchess of Hesse (1813–1862), Adelgunde, Duchess of Modena (1823–1914) and Princess Alexandra of Bavaria (1826–1875), with whom Hildegard had a very close relationship.\n\nMathilde had two elder siblings: Maria Theresia (1845–1927) in 1865 married Duke Philipp of Württemberg (1838–1917) and her only brother, Karl Albrecht (1847–1848), who died of smallpox at the age of 18 months.\n\nAfter the death of his father Archduke Karl, Archduke Albrecht inherited in 1847 the Weilburg Palace in Baden bei Wien, that Karl had built for his wife Princess Henrietta of Weilburg (1797–1829). Albrecht and his family usually spent summers there, Archduchess Hildegard being especially fond of its renowned public baths. Because of his charity, he was popularly named \"Engelsherz\" (Angel's Heart). During the winter, the family lived in Vienna. Her family was very close to the imperial family, and Empress Elisabeth greatly enjoyed the company of her cousin Archduchess Hildegard.\n\nAmong Mathilde's circle of friends was the Archduchess Marie Therese (1849–1919), later Queen of Bavaria, who was of the same age and also the stepdaughter of Karl Ferdinand (1818–1874), Mathilde's uncle.\n\nA distant cousin, Archduke Ludwig Salvator (1847–1915), of the Italian Habsburg line, fell in love with Mathilde and sought to marry her, but they never became engaged. Mathilde was intended to become Queen of Italy as the wife of Umberto of Savoy (1844–1900) in order to improve the already tense relations between Austria-Hungary and Italy.\n\nDuring her stay in Munich for the funeral of her brother King Maximilian II (1811–1864) in March 1864, Mathilde's mother became ill with a lung inflammation and pleurisy, and died; Mathilde was then 15 years old.\n\nMathilde died at the age of 18 in Schloss Hetzendorf, the Viennese home of Empress Elisabeth, on 6 June 1867. The archduchess had put on a gauze dress to go to the theatre. Before leaving for the theatre, she wanted to smoke a cigarette but shortly thereafter her father, who had forbidden smoking, approached her, and she hid the cigarette behind her dress, immediately setting light to its very flammable material and giving her second and third-degree burns. Her death was witnessed by her whole family.\n\nArchduchess Mathilde was buried in the imperial vault in the Imperial Crypt beside her mother and her brother Karl Albrecht.\n\n"}

Asarpay spoke for the Apurimac shrine, understood as an oracle of the personified river. She would give advice and warning to those of her community on the shrine's behalf. Asarpay is known for her actions and premonitions during the Spanish conquest; Asarpay foretold the Conquest and advised Inca nobility to gather and use up all of their food stores, as to not leave the conquerors any access to their resources. Asarpay is mentioned most frequently in regards to her sensationalized suicide; the reasoning for her suicide, however, is not exact. There are some claims that Asarpay threw herself into the Apurimac river gorge as a way to assure her freedom after being previously kidnapped by the Spaniard Diego Nunez Mercado. However, it is also believed that Asarpay threw herself from the Apurima temple into the river as a way of returning to the river goddess, rather than watching the destruction of the idol by the advancing Spanish army.\n"}

In a 1988 study of 28 persons hospitalized as a result of falling from height, findings showed most fallers had serious psychiatric disorders.\n\nExamination of data from between 1990 and 1998 of this type of suicide within New York city showed the highest number of deaths were within the populus aged 65 and over (Abrams \"et al\" 2005).\n\nIn the period between 1987 and 1990, 39 people were treated at the University Hospital Bochum with injuries sustained by falls from height.\n\nA study of 1998 (Joyce & Fleminger) reported that according to the Office of Census and Surveys 1990-1994, 4% of all deaths by suicide were accountable by falling from height or jumping in front of a moving object.\n\nReports of cases of suicide of this nature are complicated by doubt as to whether death was caused as a result of murder (homicide).

{"id": "4208004", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4208004", "title": "Boot camp (correctional)", "text": "Boot camp (correctional)\n\nBoot camps can be governmental being part of the correctional and penal system of some countries. Modeled after military recruit training camps, these programs are based on shock incarceration grounded on military techniques. The aggressive training used has resulted in deaths in a variety of circumstances. Boot camps are also criticized around the world for their lack of behavioral change and for the way extreme force can traumatize children and teenagers.\n\nIn Australia the Premier of the state of Queensland Campbell Newman announced that bootcamps for convicted young people will open in Townsville and Rockhampton by September 2013, along with two other camps.\n\nIn Canada participation in boot camp programs is voluntary, so as to avoid any challenges under the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms under which treatment at boot camps could be seen as an infringement on a youth's right to not be subject to cruel and unusual punishment and to ensure security of person. Canada started a boot camp project for non-violent juveniles with differences from the American models. The first one was opened in 1997 in Ontario. Unlike in the US system it is not possible to trade or shorten a jail sentence with a significantly shorter boot camp program.\n\nCanadian boot camps do not have the time frame of 90 to 180 days and they are restricted to juveniles under 18, and are not yet open to female offenders. The judges do not directly possess the authority to send a youth to a boot camp. They may impose a sentence of secure or open custody. The latter is defined as, \"a community residential center, group home, child care institution or forest or wilderness camp...\" Once an open custody sentence is granted, a correctional official decides whether a sentence is served in a boot camp program. But the ultimate decision rests with the young person and the decision is made purely on the merits of the program because the time served remains the same.\n\nThe Canadian system is too new to show any comparable results but research has been done among US boot camps with different emphases, e.g. more on drug treatment or education than solely on military drill. According to the findings treatment has a slightly positive impact on the reduction of recidivism over strict discipline.\n\nNew Zealand set up its first boot camps in 1971 but they were abandoned in 1981. The boot camps were regarded as a failure with a 71% rate of re-offending among corrective trainees. Prior to being elected into Government in 2008 the National Party released a policy of using boot camps for those with drug problems. The Fifth National Government introduced military-style activity camps (MACs) run by the New Zealand Defence Force for forty of the most serious recidivist young offenders which involved marching exercises, mentoring, drug and alcohol treatment programs, education, and an assisted move back into the community. The Government also launched a nine-week camp for the most serious, recidivist offenders in Christchurch in 2010 and a court-supervised programme providing up to ten days of adventure camp activities. While the-then Deputy Prime Minister Paula Bennett claimed the programmes had succeeded in lowering offending among that group, this was disputed by Prime Minister John Key's chief science adviser Sir Peter Gluckman in a 2011 report. The New Zealand Families Commission concluded that military camps and other measures such as curfews with electronic monitoring could not reduce re-offending on their own and that the most successful rehabilitation programmes involved the offenders' families. \n\nOn 13 August 2017, Prime Minister Bill English promised to establish a boot camp known as the \"Junior Training Academy\" for youth offenders at the Waiouru Military Camp during the 2017 election campaign. English clarified that the camp would be for small group of around 150 young offenders who had committed serious offenses including serious assault, sexual assaults, aggravated robbery and murder. In response, youth Justice advocacy group JustSpeak director Katie Bruce criticized the proposed boot camp policy and argued that it would do little to curb re-offending among young offenders. National's proposed policy was criticized by the radio host Mark Sainsbury, The Opportunities Party leader Gareth Morgan, the New Zealand First leader Winston Peters, and the University of Canterbury psychologist and author Jarrod Gilbert, who contended that the policy was aimed at enticing voters rather than helping youth offenders and that previous boot camp programmes had failed. The boot camp policy was also criticized by both National's support partner, the Māori Party, and the opposition Green Party for doing little to address youth offending within the Māori and the Pasifika communities. David Seymour, the leader of National's support partner the ACT Party, criticized the boot camp policy as a sign of the Government's failure to tackle \"broken families\" and youth crime.\n\nThe first boot camps appeared in the states of Georgia and Oklahoma in 1983. Boot camps are intended to be less restrictive than prison but harsher than probation.\n\nIn most U.S. states participation in boot camp programs is offered to young first-time offenders in place of a prison term or probation; in some states a youth can also be sentenced to participate in such a program. The time served can range from 90 to 180 days, which can make up for prison sentences of up to 10 years. \nFederal shock incarceration programs are authorized under 18 U.S.C. § 4046, although the placement requires consent of the prisoner.\n\nIn 1995, the U.S. federal government and about two-thirds of the 50 states were operating boot camp programs. Presently, there are no statistics as to how many boot camps there are in the U.S. today. In 2000, there were 51 boot camps still open.\n\nThere are many types of boot camps. Some boot camps are more therapeutic. Boot camps such as West Ridge Academy in West Jordan, Utah offer a wide range of activities, academics, and boarding school treatment programs to give students a well-rounded education.\n\nState run boot camps were banned in Florida on June 1, 2006 through legislation signed by Florida Governor Jeb Bush after 14-year-old Martin Lee Anderson died during his abidance in a boot camp. Anderson died as drill instructors beat him and encouraged him to continue physical exercise after he had collapsed. While Anderson was unconscious, guards placed ammonia tablets near his nose in an attempt to revive him, and he suffocated. Anderson attended Bay County Boot Camp in Panama City, Florida. The Victory Forge Military Academy in Florida has come under intense scrutiny of its methods, which border on physical abuse.

A Scottish army observed the landing on 3 May 1544 but did not engage with the English force. The Provost of Edinburgh was compelled to allow the English to sack Leith and Edinburgh. However, the Scottish artillery within Edinburgh Castle harassed the English forces, who had neither the time nor the resources to besiege the Castle. The English fleet sailed away loaded with captured goods, and with two ships that had belonged to James V of Scotland.\n\nHenry VIII of England wished to unite the Kingdom of Scotland with the Kingdom of England, or at least bring the kingdom under his hegemony. He had contracted with the Regent Arran that Mary, Queen of Scots would marry his son, Prince Edward. But Arran allowed the Parliament of Scotland to revoke this agreement prompting Henry to declare war in December 1543, and now the Regent was making ground against his rebels who still supported the English marriage, such as the Earl of Lennox, Earl of Glencairn, the Earl of Cassillis and the Earl of Angus. These nobles were in touch with Henry VIII via Lennox's secretary Thomas Bishop and Angus's chaplain, Master John Penven. Their letters to Henry VIII requested intervention, and in March he replied that a 'main army' was in preparation. Henry's Privy Council issued his instructions for the invasion force on 10 April 1544, and they were to;\"Put all to fire and sword, burn Edinburgh, so razed and defaced when you have sacked and gotten what ye can of it, as there may remain forever a perpetual memory of the vengeance of God lightened upon (them) for their falsehood and disloyalty.\" Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset, at this time called Lord Hertford was the King's Lieutenant of this Army Royal. He had considered establishing an English garrison at Leith but the Privy Council vetoed this plan. Henry VIII had also asked him to destroy St Andrews, but Lord Hertford pointed out the extra distance would be troublesome.\n\nHertford discussed with Privy Council the possibility of Scottish allies capturing Cardinal Beaton during his invasion. Henry VIII believed that Beaton, a favourer of the Auld Alliance with France, was particularly responsible for the rejection of the marriage plan. Beaton's would-be kidnappers included James Kirkcaldy of Grange, Norman Leslie Master of Rothes, and John Charteris who offered to attempt to capture the Cardinal as he travelled in Fife. Their second scheme was to attack Arbroath while attention was focussed on Edinburgh. This offer was made by Alexander Crichton of Brunstane who sent a messenger called Wishart to Lord Hertford. Time was too short to offer military support for these plans, but if those concerned would join in the destruction of Church property they would be offered asylum in England and £1000 to fund their action. Any schemes more elaborate than a punitive raid on Edinburgh were shelved as Henry VIII committed resources to the siege of Boulogne in France already planned for the summer.\n\nThe army assembled at Newcastle upon Tyne and Gateshead. In April 1544, Sir Christopher Morris reported to Lord Hertford that he had organised munitions for the invasion at Berwick upon Tweed. These included;\nAnthony Neville of South Leverton was appointed Surveyor General of Victuals for the army.\nEdward Shelley (who was one of the first English soldiers to be killed at the battle of Pinkie) reported that he had 40 thousand-weight of biscuit on 20 April. At Berwick, Shelley had problems getting enough coal or wood for baking and brewing. He had to ask permission to impress more supplies and hold sales to rotate his stock. 4000 border horsemen waited at Berwick for Hertford's signal. At first it was planned that they would make a diversionary attack on Haddington. Their commander Ralph Eure wrote from Alnwick on 28 April that these 'countrymen' were so poor he had to lend them money. He also asked for 1000 Yorkshire archers as reinforcement so that they could come to Edinburgh to support the landing. In the event, it was agreed that Hertford would summon Eure when he had disembarked his troops. When Eure's men arrived in Edinburgh they would get their pay.\n\nOrders for the fleet at Tynemouth were given on 28 April. All the ships were to be ready to weigh anchor at a favourable wind. The Lord Admiral, Viscount Lisle's flagship would fly the St George Cross on the fore-top mast and two top-lights at night. The ships of the 'vaward', the vanguard, would follow and anchor as near as possible. Hertford and the treasure-ship (Ralph Sadler was treasurer) would follow with his ensign on the main-top mast of the \"Rose Lion\" with two night lights on the shrouds. The Earl of Shrewsbury, captain of the rear-ward would fly the ensign on his mizzen mast, with a cresset light in the poop deck at night. The other ships were not to show flags or lights. Any ship that was transporting base or double base guns was to mount them on the fore-deck for the landing.\n\nOn 23 April 1544, all Scottish east coast towns were warned to entrench their bounds to resist the English navy. Men from neighbouring counties were summoned to muster in Edinburgh on 5 May. Extra gunners were hired for Edinburgh Castle, and Regent Arran's goods and the royal tapestries were carried up the Royal Mile from Holyroodhouse to the Castle and watched by his wardrobe servant Malcolm Gourlay. In the previous month an Edinburgh merchant James Johnston of Coates was paid £22 for going to \"find out the Englishmen's purpose.\" The Burgh records are mostly missing for the year, so there is no detailed information on any defence measures provided by the town. The English account mentions that the Scots had cast great trenches and ditches to defend Leith.\n\nAn account of the episode was published later in 1544 in London as; \"The Late Expedition in Scotland made by the King's highness' army under the conduct of the Right Honourable the Earl of Hertford in 1544.\" A later account by Mary's secretary Claude Nau records the fleet burning St Mynettes on the north side of the Forth and taking fishing boats for landing-craft. John Knox gave an account of the landing from another Scottish viewpoint. The English fleet was sighted before noon on Saturday. Knox said that Cardinal Beaton dismissed the threat and sat calmly at dinner. At 6pm there were 200 ships and an English pilot sounded the depths between Granton and Leith. Though experts could see this meant the English minded to land still there was no Scottish response. At daybreak on Sunday some of the smaller boats nosed onto land at Granton Crags and the troops landed using these as piers for the larger boats. According to Knox, when around 10,000 men were landed unchallenged the Cardinal and Regent Arran left Edinburgh.\nThe English account is similar, but mentions the presence of five or six thousand horsemen and some foot soldiers, positioned to prevent the short march from Granton to Leith at a ford on the Water of Leith. The Cardinal was with this army but after a few shots and only a couple of casualties on either side, the Scots abandoned their position at the ford of a stream, leaving their eight cannon. (Lisle said two slings and three serpentines were placed to fire across the river, agreeing with Lee's plan). The Earls of Huntly and Moray also left the field. Hertford's own dispatch describes this as a half hour fight, \"right sharply handled on both parts,\" with Peter Mewtas's hagbuters giving good service. The Admiral reported that Beaton stayed until he was in range of the handguns. He was wearing a frock of yellow velvet, cut and pulled out with white tinselled sarcenet.\n\nAnother stand before Leith itself gave some resistance, but folded after three expert Scottish gunners were killed by arrows. Hertford summoned Eure and the border horsemen with a brief note mentioning the lack of resistance, signed from the field on the west of Leith. The English then entered Leith unopposed, where they found two ships that had belonged to James V, the \"Salamander of Leith\" and the \"Unicorn.\" Some buildings in Leith were burnt, including St Ninian's chapel at the Bridge-end. Their overnight security was increased by recently constructed defensive entrenchments. Next day, Monday 5 May, the larger English ships were able to unload the heavier artillery on the quayside of the Shore of Leith. these guns were to be used against Edinburgh's gates and the castle. Cardinal Beaton left the area on Monday, the date recorded in his accounts for hiring a guide between Corstorphine and Stirling, (a journey then more usually made by boat). According to Eustace Chapuys, on the same day the Cardinal's enemy Alexander Crichton of Brunstane tried to meet Hertford at Leith, but an English guard shot him with an arrow in the leg. However, Hertford wrote that Brunstane was in the field with Arran and retreated with him to Linlithgow.\n\nThe Earl of Angus, George Douglas of Pittendreich and Lord Maxwell were in prison at Blackness Castle and Edinburgh Castle because they supported the English alliance. Arran, Guise and the Cardinal now ordered their release so their supporters would help their cause. Maxwell later wrote that they were offered cash inducements, with incomes from church lands and pensions from the King of France.\n\nWilliam Stourton (later commander of the Newhaven fort at Ambleteuse) was left in charge of Leith on 6 May with 1,500 men while the main force approached Edinburgh itself. They were met by the Provost Adam Otterburn and two heralds. Otterburn offered to give up the keys of the town on conditions. Hertford refused to accept as he had no authority to bargain. Another English herald went to the Castle, and returned with the news that the Earl of Huntly and Lord Home had brought 2000 horsemen to defend the town.\n\nSir Christopher Morris was then ordered to bring his artillery up the Canongate to assault Edinburgh's Netherbow Gate. During this operation some of the English gunners were killed. The infantry attacked the gate and, according to the English narrative, pulled one of the Scottish artillery pieces through its gunloop. The Scots could not retaliate due to heavy small arms fire and archery, during which Morris placed a cannon close to the gate. After three or four rounds, the gate was breached and the English army stormed through killing 300 or 400 defenders. The Scottish exchequer accounts record that their heavy guns were withdrawn from the High Street into the Castle. At this point, according to a report sent to Charles V, the English troops who were unused to urban warfare fought amongst each other, and William Howard, brother of the Duke of Norfolk, was hurt in the cheek by an English arrow. On the Royal Mile, the central main street of Edinburgh, the English were exposed to the artillery of the Castle. They attempted to place their cannon above the Butter-Tron, between Lawnmarket and Castlehill. A shot from the Castle dismounted one English cannon, and Hertford ordered it to be deliberately burst. At the end of that day, the English retired from the town to their camp at Leith after starting a number of fires.\n\nOn 7 May, the fire-raising and looting continued, in the town and at Holyrood, and the English force was joined by Ralph Eure's 4000 border horsemen. Nicholas Poyntz was sent to burn Kinghorn and villages on the north of the river Forth. The fortress on the island of Inchgarvie was captured and destroyed by Richard Brooke in the \"Galley Subtile\" on 6 May. (Hertford mentioned in his dispatch that it would have been useful to garrison Inchgarvie, but his orders from Henry VIII would not allow it.)\n\nChristopher Morris shipped the larger artillery, the ships sailed, and on 14 May the harbour and piers of Leith were demolished. Hertford, as the King's Lieutenant, knighted fifty-eight of his captains and his servant Thomas Fisher distributed three pounds and fifteen shillings amongst the men. The army left Leith by land on 15 May, stopping to burn Seton Palace and Haddington.\n\nAlthough Hertford's army entered the town with little resistance, the defenders of the castle led by the Captain, James Hamilton of Stenhouse kept up an artillery barrage, firing down the line of the Royal Mile. The Clerk of the King's Works, Richard Lee, who was Captain of the Pioneers on this expedition and the Surveyor of Calais, William Burgate, declared the castle impregnable.\n\nOne of the Castle gunners was Andrew Mansioun, a French carver who had made fittings for the \"Unicorn\", the yacht of James V and furniture for the royal palaces. His hand was injured when a cannon backfired, and in June 1544 he was given 44 shillings to pay for treatment.\n\nRepairs were made in July 1544, when two of the gunners, Tibault Roqueneau and Piers Schouffene (French or Flemish, originally employed at Dunbar Castle) were working to improve the gun emplacements with gabions. The fore-wall of the castle was strengthened and repaired from July. This work was completed between July and August 1546 by three masons and four workmen (called barrowmen in the accounts).\n\nHertford estimated the value of goods in Leith at £10,000. This included a large stock of three grades of linen cloth from Brittany. The ships were loaded with property seized in Edinburgh and Leith. He also took the \"Salamander\" and \"Unicorn\", loading them with 80,000 cannon balls for ballast from the King's Wark arsenal. One surviving captured item is the Dunkeld Lectern, removed from Holyrood Abbey before the English soldiers fired the church. The lectern may have come into the possession of Sir Richard Lee who made plans of Edinburgh and Leith and assessed the strength of Edinburgh Castle. Lee certainly took a brass font from Holyrood which he gave to St Albans Abbey. He had it engraved with an inscription claiming that it was used for the baptism of the Kings of Scotland. As a relic of the monarchy it was destroyed during the English civil war. Longleat House has a manuscript copy of a translation of Hector Boece's \"Chronicle of Scotland\", taken by John Thynne, Hertford's steward, from Holyroodhouse on Wednesday 7 May 1544.\n\nSome of Hertford's muster lists survive at Longleat. These include the name of Sir William Norris of Liverpool. It has traditionally been asserted that carved panelling at his house of Speke Hall came from the Palace of Holyroodhouse though this has been challenged on stylistic grounds. At Speke there were legal books including \"Bartolus sup. primi degestis veteris\", Venice (1499) and \"Panormitanus on the Decretals\", Lyon (1501), with Robert Estienne's Bible (1532). William Norris wrote in each volume that they were won at Edinburgh on 8 May 1544. The books passed to the library of the Liverpool Athenaeum in the 19th century. They were returned to Edinburgh in 2008 when the National Library of Scotland bought the collection. Inscriptions show they belonged to the Abbot of Cambuskenneth, who had a lodging on the south side of the Lawnmarket.\n\nThe returning English army burnt a number of settlements. The destruction was described by Walter Lynne in his appendix to Johann Carion's \"Cronicles\", (1550); \"burnyng and destroyeng the countrey about, sparyng nether castel, towne, pyle nor vyllage, untyll they had overthrowen and destroyed many of them, as the borough and towne of Edenborough with the Abbey called Holy Rodehouse, and the kynges Palice adjoyned to the same. The towne of Lyth also with the haven and peyre. The castell and vyllage of Cragmyller, the Abbay of Newbottell, and parte of Muskelborowe towne, the Chappel of our lady of Lawret. Preston towne, and the castell Hatintowne wyth the Freres and Nunery, and castell of Oliuer Sancklers, the towne of Dunbar, Laurestone wyth the Graunge, with many other townes, castels, vyllages and pyles.\"\n\nThe following places burnt or demolished were listed by William Patten, with other places and dates from a manuscript in the Harley Collection.\n\n\nNews spread quickly throughout Europe, though Nicholas Wotton at Speyer had to show the importance of Edinburgh as the capital of Scotland using the chronicles of Hector Boece and John Mair. However, apart from the physical destruction, a recent historian of the conflict Marcus Merriman concluded that the army, \"really did little of any long-term effect.\" Although Edinburgh was not again threatened by the war, rebuilding was a slow process. New buildings were built on the exact site of their predecessors. Tenure of the Edinburgh lands was complex with numbers of owners claiming incomes from sub-divided buildings, with some portions 'mortified' to the chaplains of altars. At the end of the war, in September 1551 and February 1552 Parliament laid down guidelines for sharing the burden of costs for re-building the burnt lands and tenements \"brint be the auld inimies of Ingland.\"\n\nHertford, as the King's lieutenant knighted the men listed below. The names of his captains are recorded in pay-books and muster lists preserved at Longleat House. A book of 'conduct money' notes where the captains came from, e.g., Hugh Chomley from Cholmondeley, Cheshire with 100 men, paid for travelling 130 miles to Edinburgh and back, William Norris from Liverpool, John Markham from Cottham near Retford, Nottinghamshire.<br>Knighted on Sunday, 11 May, at Leith;\n\nKnighted on Tuesday, 13 May, at Leith;\n\nKnighted on Sunday, 18 May, at Butterdean near Coldingham, (called Kilspindie Castle);\n\n"}

Combs in 1997. It is designed to prevent combinatorial explosion in fuzzy logic rules.\n\nThe Combs method takes advantage of the logical equality formula_1.\n\nThe simplest proof of given equality involves usage of truth tables:\nSuppose we have a fuzzy system that considers N variables at a time, each of which can fit into at least one of S sets. The number of rules necessary to cover all the cases in a traditional fuzzy system is formula_2, whereas the Combs method would need only formula_3 rules. For example, if we have five sets and five variables to consider to produce one output, covering all the cases would require 3125 rules in a traditional system, while the Combs method would require only 25 rules, taming the combinatorial explosion that occurs when more inputs or more sets are added to the system.\n\nThis article will focus on the Combs method itself. To learn more about the way rules are traditionally formed, see fuzzy logic and fuzzy associative matrix.\n\nSuppose we were designing an artificial personality system that determined how friendly the personality is supposed to be towards a person in a strategic video game. The personality would consider its own fear, trust, and love in the other person.

To obtain the output of the system, we just average the outputs of each rule for that output. For example, to calculate how much the computer is Enemies with the player, we take the average of how much the computer is Unafraid, Distrusting, and Unloving of the player. When all three averages are obtained, the result can then be defuzzified by any of the traditional means.\n\n"}

He is portrayed by Josh Dallas, who also happens to be married to series co-star Ginnifer Goodwin, who plays David's wife Snow White/Mary Margaret Blanchard. \n\nThe leader of the Enchanted Forest's War Council who is comatose in Storybrooke. While initially he is known simply as \"John Doe\" in Storybrooke because of his comatose state, he is eventually revealed to be called David Nolan, after waking up. The creators also mixed Charming's history with that of \"The Prince and the Pauper\", with Dallas portraying both the original Prince and the Pauper who replaced his brother after he was killed. Because of this history, Dallas tried to bring a \"rural\" feel to the character to make him more accessible to viewers. On what makes his portrayal of Prince Charming different to those before, Dallas explained that \"Prince Charming just happens to be a name. He's still a man with the same emotions as any other man. He's a Prince, but he's a Prince of the people. He gets his hands dirty. He's got a kingdom to run. He has a family to protect. He has an epic, epic love for Snow White. He's like everybody else. He's human.\"\n\nIn the Enchanted Forest, David was originally a poor shepherd whose twin brother James was given to King George as an heir in a deal with Rumplestiltskin. From an internal story chronology we first encounter him when he meets Anna of Arendelle, whom he tells he is a friend of Kristof, and we find him being terrorized by the evil Little Bo Peep.\n\nWhen James, his twin brother, is killed in battle, David takes his brother's name in exchange for the prosperity of his mother's farm. King Midas declares David fit to marry his daughter Abigail and unite the kingdoms. However, David wants to marry for love, but George vows to kill his mother if he declines. He falls in love with Snow White, who nicknames him Charming, later inviting her to run away. After continuous interceptions by George, the Evil Queen Regina captures him to convince Snow to willingly eat an apple containing a sleeping curse. He later awakens her and the pair marry, before Regina announces that she will cast a curse to destroy their happiness. Rumplestiltskin informs them that their child will break the curse in 28 years. Emma is born before the curse takes hold, and Charming places her in a magical wardrobe to protect her from the curse, before being wounded by the Queen's knights.\n\nIn Storybrooke, as a result of his wounds, he first appears as a John Doe, who has gone unidentified for years. He awakens after Mary Margaret (Snow White) reads him their story. He reunites with his wife Kathryn (Princess Abigail), and is identified as David Nolan. David suffers from amnesia and cannot remember his fake life with Kathryn. He falls in love with Mary Margaret and begins an affair with her, ending his marriage to Kathryn, who is soon reported as being murdered, a plan arranged between Regina Mills and Mr. Gold. David becomes a suspect in her disappearance, until evidence against Mary Margaret is found. Kathryn is found alive, though David's relationship with Mary Margaret becomes strained, as he did not believe her innocence. He decides to move to Boston, though the curse is broken shortly after, and he reunites with Snow and Emma. David agrees to send a wraith released into Storybrooke through a portal, though Emma and Mary Margaret are dragged with it. David looks after Henry while Emma and Mary Margaret are absent. After failing attempts of transportation, David falls under a sleeping curse to communicate with Mary Margaret. He is awoken by true love's kiss when the two return. When Henry is kidnapped to Neverland, David travels with his family and friends to rescue him from Peter Pan.\n\nIn Neverland, David is poisoned by Dreamshade, though Hook partially cures him and the group successfully return to Storybrooke where Mr. Gold fully heals him. After Pan enacts the original curse once more, David is returned to his original world with the remaining inhabitants, while Emma and Henry escape to New York City.\n\nBack in the Enchanted Forest, David learns that Snow is pregnant but also discovers that Zelena, the Wicked Witch of the West wants their baby. The two enact a new curse to return to Storybrooke and make Emma stop Zelena. David insists Snow crush his heart, though she later asks Regina to split her heart in two to give to both of them. Zelena adds a forgetting potion to the curse, removing their memories of the past year. A year later, Emma returns to Storybrooke, and David and Mary Margaret reveal they are having a baby. Zelena poses as the couple's mid-wife, stealing a symbol of David's courage from him. Zelena is ultimately defeated and Mary Margaret gives birth to a son, whom she names after Henry's father and Rumplestiltkin's son, Neal. Following the Queens of Darkness's arrival in Storybrooke, Mary Margaret and David battle to keep their secret (being the reason Maleficent lost her child) from Emma. However, they eventually tell Emma the truth, who finds it hard to forgive them. After Mary Margaret is almost killed by Maleficent's daughter Lily, Emma reunites with her parents, although this is short lived when Emma sacrifices herself to become the new Dark One. With the other residents, Mary Margaret transports to the Enchanted Forest, taking Emma to Camelot in order to find Merlin and remove her darkness. However, weeks later, they return to Storybrooke with missing memories as to how they failed. In \"Siege Perilous\", David is knighted by King Arthur (Liam Garrigan) and bestowed the Siege Perilous seat at the Round Table. He later gives this up when he learned of Arthur's deception, which would later result in David having Arthur arrested in Storybrooke.\n\nAfter Emma restored his memory, David followed his daughter to the Underworld to help rescue Hook, only to learn that his late twin brother James is the Sheriff in this realm and discovered from Cruella de Vil that James has resentment against David over being raised by their mother and having a family that James envies. When the two finally meet for the first time, David attempted to explain to James (who still believed he was the \"Prince\") over what happened back in the Enchanted Forest, but James cut to the chase and used a stun gun on David, and pretended to play \"Shepherd\" in a scheme to help him and Cruella escape the Underworld by tricking Emma into finding the location of where Robin Hood was keeping Zelena's baby. When James attempted to send Emma and Robin to the River of Lost Souls at the harbor, David stopped James and tried to convince him that he can be at peace and move on, but James continued to believe that killing David was his unfinished business. James attempted to pull a knife to kill David but he missed and is sent into the water, where he was consumed by the lost souls. As David watched this unfold, Emma told her father that despite his effort to save him, it was too late for James anyway.\n\nOnce the Evil Queen return to Storybrooke chaos erupted but David and his family tried to continue to have a normal life but this is short lived when the Evil Queen threatens the town with water from the River of Lost Souls unless Snow and David give up their hearts which they do. However, instead of killing them the Evil Queen puts a sleeping curse on their shared heart so when one is awake, the other will remain asleep so now Snow and David cannot be together but they try to adjust to life without each other. It was revealed that while David believed his father was a drunk who died because of his behavior, David's father Robert rescued James after James ran away from King George. When Robert asked to take James back because James was unhappy, King George ordered the father killed causing David to almost kill King George but is later stopped by Hook. Hook after given permission by David to marry Emma finds out he killed the men who were supposed to kill the father, and he killed Robert because \"dead men tell no tales.\"\n\nPrior to landing the role on the series, Dallas was cast in 2011 as Fandral in \"Thor\" after Irish actor Stuart Townsend withdrew from the role days before filming was to begin. However, Dallas did not reprise his role in the sequel to \"Thor\" due to his commitments in \"Once Upon a Time\". Zachary Levi replaced him in the film.\n\nThe creators also mixed Charming's history with that of \"The Prince and the Pauper\", with Dallas portraying both the original Prince and the Pauper who replaced his brother after he was killed.

{"id": "24704855", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24704855", "title": "Enlightenment (spiritual)", "text": "Enlightenment (spiritual)\n\nEnlightenment is the \"full comprehension of a situation\". The term is commonly used to denote the Age of Enlightenment, but is also used in Western cultures in a religious context. It translates several Buddhist terms and concepts, most notably \"bodhi\", \"kensho\" and \"satori\". Related terms from Asian religions are \"moksha\" (liberation) in Hinduism, \"Kevala Jnana\" in Jainism, and \"ushta\" in Zoroastrianism.\n\nIn Christianity, the word \"enlightenment\" is rarely used, except to refer to the Age of Enlightenment and its influence on Christianity. Roughly equivalent terms in Christianity may be illumination, kenosis, metanoia, revelation, salvation and conversion.\n\nPerennialists and Universalists view enlightenment and mysticism as equivalent terms for religious or spiritual insight.\nIn the Western world the concept of \"enlightenment\" in a religious context acquired a romantic meaning. It has become synonymous with self-realization and the true self, which is being regarded as a substantial essence which is covered over by social conditioning.\n\nThe use of the Western word \"enlightenment\" is based on the supposed resemblance of \"bodhi\" with \"Aufklärung\", the independent use of reason to gain insight into the true nature of our world. As a matter of fact there are more resemblances with Romanticism than with the Enlightenment: the emphasis on feeling, on intuitive insight, on a true essence beyond the world of appearances.\n\nThe equivalent term \"awakening\" has also been used in a Christian context, namely the Great Awakenings, several periods of religious revival in American religious history. Historians and theologians identify three or four waves of increased religious enthusiasm occurring between the early 18th century and the late 19th century. Each of these \"Great Awakenings\" was characterized by widespread revivals led by evangelical Protestant ministers, a sharp increase of interest in religion, a profound sense of conviction and redemption on the part of those affected, an increase in evangelical church membership, and the formation of new religious movements and denominations.\n\nAnother equivalent term is Illuminationism, which was also used by Paul Demieville in his work \"The Mirror of the Mind\", in which he made a distinction between \"illumination subie\" and \"illumination graduelle\". Illuminationism is a doctrine according to which the process of human thought needs to be aided by divine grace. It is the oldest and most influential alternative to naturalism in the theory of mind and epistemology. It was an important feature of ancient Greek philosophy, Neoplatonism, medieval philosophy, and in particular, the Illuminationist school of Islamic philosophy.\n\nAugustine was an important proponent of Illuminationism, stating that everything we know is taught to us by God as He casts His light over the world, saying that \"The mind needs to be enlightened by light from outside itself, so that it can participate in truth, because it is not itself the nature of truth. You will light my lamp, Lord,\" and \"You hear nothing true from me which you have not first told me.\" Augustine's version of illuminationism is not that God gives us certain information, but rather gives us insight into the truth of the information we received for ourselves.\n\nThis romantic idea of enlightenment as insight into a timeless, transcendent reality has been popularized especially by D.T. Suzuki. Further popularization was due to the writings of Heinrich Dumoulin. Dumoulin viewed metaphysics as the expression of a transcendent truth, which according to him was expressed by Mahayana Buddhism, but not by the pragmatic analysis of the oldest Buddhism, which emphasizes anatta. This romantic vision is also recognizable in the works of Ken Wilber.\n\nIn the oldest Buddhism this essentialism is not recognizable. According to critics it doesn't really contribute to a real insight into Buddhism:\nA common reference in Western culture is the notion of \"enlightenment \"experience\"\". This notion can be traced back to William James, who used the term \"religious experience\" in his book, \"The Varieties of Religious Experience\". Wayne Proudfoot traces the roots of the notion of \"religious experience\" further back to the German theologian Friedrich Schleiermacher (1768–1834), who argued that religion is based on a feeling of the infinite. The notion of \"religious experience\" was used by Schleiermacher to defend religion against the growing scientific and secular critique.\n\nIt was popularised by the Transcendentalists, and exported to Asia via missionaries. Transcendentalism developed as a reaction against 18th-century rationalism, John Locke's philosophy of Sensualism, and the predestinationism of New England Calvinism. It is fundamentally a variety of diverse sources such as Hindu texts like the Vedas, the Upanishads and the Bhagavad Gita, various religions, and German idealism.\n\nIt was adopted by many scholars of religion, of which William James was the most influential.\n\nThe notion of \"experience\" has been criticised. Robert Sharf points out that \"experience\" is a typical Western term, which has found its way into Asian religiosity via western influences. The notion of \"experience\" introduces a false notion of duality between \"experiencer\" and \"experienced\", whereas the essence of kensho is the realisation of the \"non-duality\" of observer and observed. \"Pure experience\" does not exist; all experience is mediated by intellectual and cognitive activity. The specific teachings and practices of a specific tradition may even determine what \"experience\" someone has, which means that this \"experience\" is not the \"proof\" of the teaching, but a \"result\" of the teaching. A pure consciousness without concepts, reached by \"cleaning the doors of perception\", would be an overwhelming chaos of sensory input without coherence.\n\nNevertheless, the notion of religious experience has gained widespread use in the study of religion, and is extensively researched.\n\nThe English term \"enlightenment\" has commonly been used to translate several Sanskrit, Pali, Chinese and Japanese terms and concepts, especially \"bodhi\", \"prajna\", \"kensho\", \"satori\" and buddhahood.\n\n\"Bodhi\" is a Theravada term. It literally means \"awakening\" and \"understanding\". Someone who is awakened has gained insight into the workings of the mind which keeps us imprisoned in craving, suffering and rebirth, and has also gained insight into the way that leads to \"nirvana\", the liberation of oneself from this imprisonment.\n\n\"Prajna\" is a Mahayana term. It refers to insight into our true nature, which according to Madhyamaka is empty of a personal essence in the stream of experience. But it also refers to the \"Tathāgata-garbha\" or Buddha-nature, the essential basic-consciousness beyond the stream of experience.\n\nIn Zen, \"kensho\" means \"seeing into one's true nature\". \"Satori\" is often used interchangeably with \"kensho\", but refers to the \"experience\" of \"kensho\".\n\nBuddhahood is the attainment of full awakening and becoming a Buddha. According to the Tibetan Thubten Yeshe, enlightenment full awakening; buddhahood. The ultimate goal of Buddhist practice, attained when all limitations have been removed from the mind and one's positive potential has been completely and perfectly realized. It is a state characterized by infinite compassion, wisdom and skill.\n\nIn Indian religions \"moksha\" (Sanskrit: '; liberation) or \"mukti\" (Sanskrit: ; release —both from the root ' \"to let loose, let go\") is the final extrication of the soul or consciousness (\"purusha\") from \"samsara\" and the bringing to an end of all the suffering involved in being subject to the cycle of repeated death and rebirth (reincarnation).\n\n\"Advaita Vedanta\" (IAST '; Sanskrit: अद्वैत वेदान्त ) is a philosophical concept where followers seek liberation/release by recognizing identity of the Self (Atman) and the Whole (Brahman) through long preparation and training, usually under the guidance of a guru, that involves efforts such as knowledge of scriptures, renunciation of worldly activities, and inducement of direct identity experiences. Originating in India before 788 AD, Advaita Vedanta is widely considered the most influential and most dominant sub-school of the Vedānta (literally, \"end or the goal of the Vedas\", Sanskrit) school of Hindu philosophy. Other major sub-schools of Vedānta are ' and \"Dvaita\"; while the minor ones include Suddhadvaita, Dvaitadvaita and Achintya Bhedabheda.\n\n\"Advaita\" (literally, \"non-duality\") is a system of thought where \"Advaita\" refers to the identity of the Self (\"Atman\") and the Whole (Brahman). Recognition of this identity leads to liberation. Attaining this liberation takes a long preparation and training under the guidance of a guru.\n\nThe key source texts for all schools of Vedānta are the Prasthanatrayi—the canonical texts consisting of the Upanishads, the Bhagavad Gita and the Brahma Sutras. The first person to explicitly consolidate the principles of Advaita Vedanta was Shankara Bhagavadpada, while the first historical proponent was Gaudapada, the guru of Shankara's guru Govinda Bhagavatpada.\n\nShankara systematized the works of preceding philosophers. His system of Vedanta introduced the method of scholarly exegesis on the accepted metaphysics of the Upanishads. This style was adopted by all the later Vedanta schools.\n\nShankara's synthesis of Advaita Vedanta is summarized in this quote from the , one of his (philosophical treatises):\nIn half a couplet I state, what has been stated by crores of texts;\nthat is Brahman alone is real, the world is mithyā (not independently existent),\nand the individual self is nondifferent from Brahman.\n\nIn the 19th century, Vivekananda played a major role in the revival of Hinduism, and the spread of Advaita Vedanta to the West via the Ramakrishna Mission. His interpretation of Advaita Vedanta has been called \"Neo-Vedanta\".\n\nIn a talk on \"The absolute and manifestation\" given in at London in 1896 Swami Vivekananda said,\nVivekananda emphasized samadhi as a means to attain liberation. Yet this emphasis is not to be found in the Upanishads nor in Shankara. For Shankara, meditation and Nirvikalpa Samadhi are means to gain knowledge of the already existing unity of Brahman and Atman, not the highest goal itself:\nVivekenanda's modernisation has been criticized:\n\"Neo-Advaita\" is a new religious movement based on a modern, Western interpretation of Advaita Vedanta, especially the teachings of Ramana Maharshi. Neo-Advaita is being criticized for discarding the traditional prerequisites of knowledge of the scriptures and \"renunciation as necessary preparation for the path of \"jnana\"-yoga\". Notable neo-advaita teachers are H. W. L. Poonja, his students Gangaji Andrew Cohen, Madhukar and Eckhart Tolle.\n\nThe prime means to reach moksha is through the practice of yoga (Sanskrit, Pāli: , /ˈjəʊɡə/, \"\") is a commonly known generic term for physical, mental, and spiritual disciplines which originated in ancient India. Specifically, yoga is one of the six \"āstika\" (\"orthodox\") schools of Hindu philosophy. It is based on the \"Yoga Sūtras of Patañjali\". Various traditions of yoga are found in Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism and Sikhism.\n\nPre–philosophical speculations and diverse ascetic practices of first millennium BCE were systematized into a formal philosophy in early centuries CE by the \"Yoga Sutras of Patanjali\". By the turn of the first millennium, Hatha yoga emerged as a prominent tradition of yoga distinct from the Patanjali's \"Yoga Sutras\". While the \"Yoga Sutras\" focus on discipline of the mind, Hatha yoga concentrates on health and purity of the body.\n\nHindu monks, beginning with Swami Vivekananda, brought yoga to the West in the late 19th century. In the 1980s, yoga became popular as a physical system of health exercises across the Western world. Many studies have tried to determine the effectiveness of yoga as a complementary intervention for cancer, schizophrenia, asthma and heart patients. In a national survey, long-term yoga practitioners in the United States reported musculo–skeletal and mental health improvements.\n\nClassical Advaita Vedanta emphasises the path of \"jnana yoga\", a progression of study and training to attain moksha. It consists of four stages:\n\nThe paths of \"bhakti yoga\" and \"karma yoga\" are subsidiary.\n\nIn bhakti yoga, practice centers on the worship God in any way and in any form, like Krishna or Ayyappa. Adi Shankara himself was a proponent of devotional worship or \"Bhakti\". But Adi Shankara taught that while Vedic sacrifices, \"puja\" and devotional worship can lead one in the direction of \"jnana\" (true knowledge), they cannot lead one directly to \"moksha\". At best, they can serve as means to obtain moksha via shukla gati.\n\nKarma yoga is the way of doing our duties, in disregard of personal gains or losses. According to Sri Swami Sivananda,\nJainism (; ', \"Samaṇam\", ', ', \"Jainmat\", '), is an Indian religion that prescribes a path of non-violence towards all living beings. Its philosophy and practice emphasize the necessity of self-effort to move the soul toward divine consciousness and liberation. Any soul that has conquered its own inner enemies and achieved the state of supreme being is called a \"jina\" (\"conqueror\" or \"victor\"). The ultimate status of these perfect souls is called siddha. Ancient texts also refer to Jainism as \"shramana dharma\" (self-reliant) or the \"path of the nirganthas\" (those without attachments or aversions).\n\nIn Jainism highest form of pure knowledge a soul can attain is called Kevala Jnana ( Sanskrit : केवलज्ञान )or Kevala Ṇāṇa (Prakrit : केवल णाण). which means “absolute or perfect” and Jñāna, which means \"knowledge\". Kevala is the state of isolation of the jīva from the ajīva attained through ascetic practices which burn off one's karmic residues, releasing one from bondage to the cycle of death and rebirth. Kevala Jñāna thus means infinite knowledge of self and non-self, attained by a soul after annihilation of the all ghātiyā karmas. The soul which has reached this stage achieves moksa or liberation at the end of its life span.\n\nMahavira, 24th thirthankara of Jainism, is said to have practised rigorous austerities for 12 years before he attained enlightenment,\n\nKevala Jñāna is one of the five major events in the life of a Tirthankara and is known as Jñāna Kalyanaka and supposedly celebrated by all gods. Mahavira’s Kaivalya was said to have been celebrated by the demi-gods, who constructed the Samosarana or a grand preaching assembly for him.\n\nThe word \"enlightenment\" is not generally used in Christian contexts for religious understanding or insight. More commonly used terms in the Christian tradition are religious conversion and revelation.\n\nLewis Sperry Chafer (1871–1952), one of the founders of Dispensationalism, uses the word \"illuminism\". Christians who are \"illuminated\" are of two groups, those who have experienced true illuminism (biblical) and those who experienced false illuminism (not from the Holy Spirit).\n\nChristian interest in eastern spirituality has grown throughout the 20th century. Notable Christians, such as Hugo Enomiya-Lassalle and AMA Samy, have participated in Buddhist training and even become Buddhist teachers themselves. In a few places Eastern contemplative techniques have been integrated in Christian practices, such as centering prayer. But this integration has also raised questions about the borders between these traditions.\n\nWestern and Mediterranean culture has a rich tradition of esotericism and mysticism. The Perennial philosophy, basic to the New Age understanding of the world, regards those traditions as akin to Eastern religions which aim at awakening/ enlightenment and developing wisdom. The hypothesis that all mystical traditions share a \"common core\", is central to New Age, but contested by a diversity of scientists like Katz and Proudfoot.\n\nJudaism includes the mystical tradition of Kabbalah. Islam includes the mystical tradition of Sufism. In the Fourth Way teaching, enlightenment is the highest state of Man (humanity).\n\nA popular western understanding sees \"enlightenment\" as \"nondual consciousness\", \"a primordial, natural awareness without subject or object\". It is used interchangeably with Neo-Advaita.\n\nThis nondual consciousness is seen as a common stratum to different religions. Several definitions or meanings are combined in this approach, which makes it possible to recognize various traditions as having the same essence. According to Renard, many forms of religion are based on an experiential or intuitive understanding of \"the Real\"\n\nThis idea of nonduality as \"the central essence\" is part of a modern mutual exchange and synthesis of ideas between western spiritual and esoteric traditions and Asian religious revival and reform movements. Western predecessors are, among others, New Age, Wilber's synthesis of western psychology and Asian spirituality, the idea of a Perennial Philosophy, and Theosophy. Eastern influences are the Hindu reform movements such as Aurobindo's Integral Yoga and Vivekananda's Neo-Vedanta, the Vipassana movement, and Buddhist modernism. A truly syncretistic influence is Osho and the Rajneesh movement, a hybrid of eastern and western ideas and teachings, and a mainly western group of followers.\n\n\"Religious experiences\" have \"evidential value\", since they confirm the specific worldview of the experiencer:\nYet, just like the very notion of \"religious experience\" is shaped by a specific discourse and habitus, the \"uniformity of interpretation\" may be due to the influence of religious traditions which shape the interpretation of such experiences.\n\nYandell discerns various \"religious experiences\" and their corresponding doctrinal settings, which differ in structure and phenomenological content, and in the \"evidential value\" they present. Yandell discerns five sorts:\n\nVarious philosophers and cognitive scientists state that there is no \"true self\" or a \"little person\" (homunculus) in the brain that \"watches the show,\" and that consciousness is an emergent property that arise from the various modules of the brain in ways that are yet far from understood. According to Susan Greenfield, the \"self\" may be seen as a composite, whereas Douglas R. Hofstadter describes the sense of \"I\" as a result of cognitive process.\n\nThis is in line with the Buddhist teachings, which state that\nTo this end, Parfit called Buddha the \"first bundle theorist\".\n\nThe idea that the mind is the result of the activities of neurons in the brain was most notably popularized by Francis Crick, the co-discoverer of DNA, in his book The Astonishing Hypothesis. The basic idea can be traced back to at least Étienne Bonnot de Condillac. According to Crick, the idea was not a novel one:\n\nSeveral users of entheogens throughout the ages have claimed spiritual enlightenment with the use of these substances, their use and prevalence through history is well recorded, and continues today. In modern times we have seen increased interest in these practices, for example the rise of interest in Ayahuasca. The psychological effects of these substances have been subject to scientific research focused on understanding their physiological basis.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "3980316", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3980316", "title": "Fernando Amorsolo", "text": "Fernando Amorsolo\n\nFernando Amorsolo y Cueto (May 30, 1892 – April 24, 1972) was one of the most important artists in the history of painting in the Philippines. Amorsolo was a portraitist and painter of rural Philippine landscapes. He is popularly known for his craftsmanship and mastery in the use of light.\n\nAmorsolo was born on May 30, 1892, in Paco, Manila. Don Fabián de la Rosa, his mother's cousin, was also a Filipino painter. At the age of 13, Amorsolo became an apprentice to De la Rosa, who would eventually become the advocate and guide to Amorsolo's painting career. During this time, Amorsolo's mother embroidered to earn money, while Amorsolo helped by selling water color postcards to a local bookstore for 10 centavos each. His brother, Pablo Amorsolo, was also a painter.\nAmorsolo's first success as a young painter came in 1908, when his painting \"Leyendo el periódico\" took second place at the \"Bazar Escolta\", a contest organized by the \"Asociacion Internacional de Artistas\". Between 1909 and 1914, he enrolled at the Art School of the Liceo de Manila.\n\nAfter graduating from the Liceo, he entered the University of the Philippines' School of Fine Arts, where De la Rosa worked at the time. During college, Fernando Amorsolo's primary influences were the Spanish people court painter Diego Velázquez, John Singer Sargent, Anders Zorn, Claude Monet, Pierre-Auguste Renoir, but mostly his contemporary Spanish masters Joaquín Sorolla Bastida and Ignacio Zuloaga. Amorsolo's most notable work as a student at the Liceo was his painting of a young man and a young woman in a garden, which won him the first prize in the art school exhibition during his graduation year. To make money during school, Amorsolo joined competitions and did illustrations for various Philippine publications, including Severino Reyes’ first novel in Tagalog language, \"Parusa ng Diyos\" (\"Punishment of God\"), Iñigo Ed. Regalado's \"Madaling Araw\" (\"Dawn\"), as well as illustrations for editions of the \"Pasion\". Amorsolo graduated with medals from the University of the Philippines in 1914.\n\nAfter graduating from the University of the Philippines, Amorsolo worked as a draftsman for the Bureau of Public Works, as a chief artist at the Pacific Commercial Company, and as a part-time instructor at the University of the Philippines (where he would work for 38 years). After three years as an instructor and commercial artist, Amorsolo was given a grant to study at the Academia de San Fernando in Madrid, Spain by Filipino businessman Enrique Zóbel de Ayala. During his seven months in Spain, Amorsolo sketched at museums and along the streets of Madrid, experimenting with the use of light and color. Through the Zóbel grant, Amorsolo was also able to visit New York City, where he encountered postwar impressionism and cubism, which would be major influences on his work.\n\nAmorsolo set up his own studio upon his return to Manila and painted prodigiously during the 1920s and the 1930s. His \"Rice Planting\" (1922), which appeared on posters and tourist brochures, became one of the most popular images of the Commonwealth of the Philippines. Beginning in the 1930s, Amorsolo's work was exhibited widely both in the Philippines and abroad. His bright, optimistic, pastoral images set the tone for Philippine painting before World War II. Except for his darker World War II-era paintings, Amorsolo painted quiet and peaceful scenes throughout his career.\n\nAmorsolo was sought after by influential Filipinos including Luis Araneta, Antonio Araneta and Jorge B. Vargas. Amorsolo also became the favourite Philippine artist of United States officials and visitors to the country. Due to his popularity, Amorsolo had to resort to photographing his works and pasted and mounted them in an album. Prospective patrons could then choose from this catalog of his works. Amorsolo did not create exact replicas of his trademark themes; he recreated the paintings by varying some elements.\n\nHis works later appeared on the cover and pages of children textbooks, in novels, in commercial designs, in cartoons and illustrations for the Philippine publications such \"The Independent\", \"Philippine Magazine\", \"Telembang\", \"El Renacimiento Filipino\", and \"Excelsior\". He was the director of the University of the Philippine's College of Fine Arts from 1938 to 1952.\n\nDuring the 1950s until his death in 1972, Amorsolo averaged to finishing 10 paintings a month. However, during his later years, diabetes, cataracts, arthritis, headaches, dizziness and the death of two sons affected the execution of his works. Amorsolo underwent a cataract operation when he was 70 years old, a surgery that did not impede him from drawing and painting.\n\nAmorsolo was a close friend of the Philippine sculptor Guillermo Tolentino, the creator of the Caloocan City monument to the patriot Andrés Bonifacio.\n\nAmorsolo is best known for his illuminated landscapes, which often portrayed traditional Filipino customs, culture, fiestas and occupations. His pastoral works presented \"an imagined sense of nationhood in counterpoint to American colonial rule\" and were important to the formation of Filipino national identity. \nHe was educated in the classical tradition and aimed \"to achieve his Philippine version of the Greek ideal for the human form.\" In his paintings of Filipina women, Amorsolo rejected Western ideals of beauty in favor of Filipino ideals and was fond of basing the faces of his subjects on members of his family.\n\nAmorsolo used natural light in his paintings and developed the backlighting technique Chiaroscuro, which became his artistic trademark and his greatest contribution to Philippine painting.\nIn a typical Amorsolo painting, figures are outlined against a characteristic glow, and intense light on one part of the canvas highlights nearby details. Philippine sunlight was a constant feature of Amorsolo's work; he is believed to have painted only one rainy-day scene.\n\nAmorsolo was an incessant sketch artist, often drawing sketches at his home, at Luneta Park, and in the countryside. He drew the people he saw around him, from farmers to city-dwellers coping with the Japanese occupation. Amorsolo's impressionistic tendencies, which may be seen in his paintings as well, were at their height in his sketches. His figures were not completely finished but were mere \"suggestions\" of the image.\n\nAmorsolo also painted a series of historical paintings on pre-Colonial and Spanish Colonization events. Amorsolo's \"Making of the Philippine Flag\", in particular, was widely reproduced. His \"The First Baptism in the Philippines\" required numerous detailed sketches and colored studies of its elements. These diverse elements were meticulously and carefully set by the artist before being transferred to the final canvas. For his pre-colonial and 16th-century depiction of the Philippines, Amorsolo referred to the written accounts of Antonio Pigafetta, other available reading materials, and visual sources He consulted with the Philippine scholars of the time, H. Pardo de Tavera and Epifanio de los Santos.\n\nAmorsolo also painted oil portraits of Presidents like General Emilio Aguinaldo, and other prominent individuals such as Don Alfredo Jacób and Doña Pura Garchitorena Toral of Camarines Sur. He also painted the wedding picture of Don Mariano Garchitorena and Doña Caridad Pamintuan of Pampanga.\n\nHe also did a portrait of American Senator Warren Grant Magnuson (1905–1989), of the Democratic Party from Washington, whom the Warren G. Magnuson Health Sciences Building at the University of Washington, and the Warren G. Magnuson Clinical Center at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Maryland are named after.\n\nAfter the onset of World War II, Amorsolo's typical pastoral scenes were replaced by the depictions of a war-torn nation. During the Japanese occupation of the Philippines during World War II, Amorsolo spent his days at his home near the Japanese garrison, where he sketched war scenes from the house's windows or rooftop.\n\nDuring the war, he documented the destruction of many landmarks in Manila and the pain, tragedy and death experienced by Filipino people, with his subjects including \"women mourning their dead husbands, files of people with pushcarts and makeshift bags leaving a dark burning city tinged with red from fire and blood.\" Amorsolo frequently portrayed the lives and suffering of Filipina women during World War II. Other World War II-era paintings by Amorsolo include a portrait \"in absentia\" of General Douglas MacArthur as well as self-portraits and paintings of Japanese occupation soldiers. In 1948, Amorsolo's wartime paintings were exhibited at the Malacañang Presidential Palace.\n\nAmorsolo's supporters consider his portrayals of the countryside as \"the true reflections of the Filipino Soul.\"\n\nAmorsolo has been accused, however, of succumbing to commercialism and merely producing souvenir paintings for American soldiers. Critic Francisco Arcellana wrote in 1948 that Amorsolo's paintings \"have nothing to say\" and that they were not hard to understand because \"there is nothing to understand.\" Critics have criticized Amorsolo's portraits of Philippine Commonwealth personalities, his large, mid-career anecdotal works, and his large historical paintings. Of the latter, critics have said that his \"artistic temperament was simply not suited to generating the sense of dramatic tension necessary for such works.\"\n\nAnother critic, however, while noting that most of Amorsolo's estimated ten thousand works were not worthy of his talent, argues that Amorsolo's oeuvre should nonetheless judged by his best works instead of his worst. Amorsolo's small landscapes, especially those of his early career, have been judged as his best works, \"hold[ing] well together plastic-ally.\" Amorsolo may \"be considered a master of the Philippine landscape as landscape, even outranking Luna and Hidalgo who also did some Philippine landscapes of the same measurements.\"\n\nAfter being confined at the St. Luke's Hospital in Quezon City for two months, Amorsolo died of heart failure at the age of 79 on April 24, 1972.\n\nFour days after his death, Amorsolo was honoured as the first National Artist in Painting at the Cultural Center of the Philippines by then President Ferdinand Marcos.\n\nThe volume of paintings, sketches and studies of Amorsolo is believed to have reached more than 10,000 pieces. Amorsolo was an important influence on contemporary Filipino art and artists, even beyond the so-called \"Amorsolo school.\" Amorsolo's influence can be seen in many landscape paintings by Filipino artists, including early landscape paintings by abstract painter Federico Aguilar Alcuaz.\n\nIn 2003, Amorsolo's children founded the Fernando C. Amorsolo Art Foundation, which is dedicated to preserving Fernando Amorsolo's legacy, promoting his style and vision, and preserving a national heritage through the conservation and promotion of his works.\n\nDuring the post-war period, Insular Life commissioned Amorsolo to create a series of paintings of historical events for their offices (and which were subsequently used in Insular Life calendars from '50s to '80s). .\n\nAt a 2001 auction in Wellesley, Massachusetts, two original 1950s paintings by Amorsolo, \"The Cockfight\" and \"Resting Under the Trees\", were bought by a New Jersey collector for $36,000 and $31,500, respectively. During a 2002 episode of Antiques Roadshow, a Sotheby's antiques appraiser estimated that an attendee's signed 1945 rural landscape painting by Amorsolo could fetch between $30,000 and $50,000 at auction. At a 1996 Christie's auction, Amorsolo's \"The Marketplace\" went for $174,000. In April 2002, \"Portrait of Fernanda De Jesus\" was bought for US$377,947.\n\nOn November 30, 2009, the \" Family Gathering Fruit\" sold for US$77,257 at Christie's. In December 2009, \"Fruit Gatherer\" was auctioned off in Maryland, in record-breaking manner, topping 19th- and 20th-century European and American paintings. In May 2010, the highest priced Amorsolo painting was auctioned off at Christie's for about US$440,000.\n\nThe Jorge B. Vargas Museum and Filipiniana Research Center in Manila displays a major collection of Amorsolo's work.\n\nMajor works by Amorsolo include:\n\n\nIn 1972, Fernando Amorsolo became the first Filipino to be distinguished as the Philippine's National Artist in Painting. He was named as the \"Grand Old Man of Philippine Art\" during the inauguration of the Manila Hilton's art center, where his paintings were exhibited on January 23, 1969.\n\nOutside the Philippines, his exhibitions were held in Belgium, at the Exposicion de Panama in 1914, at a one-man show at the Grand Central Art Galleries in New York City in 1925, and at the National Museum in Herran on November 6, 1948. During the 1931 Paris Exposition, Amorsolo exhibited one of his anecdotal paintings, \"The Conversion of the Filipinos\". Amorsolo's entries at the \"Exposicion\" in Panama were a portrait of U.S. President Woodrow Wilson and the piece \"La Muerte de Socrates\". At the 1948 National Museum in Herran, Amorsolo exhibition was sponsored by the Art Association of the Philippines. In 1950, Amorsolo exhibited two more historical paintings, \"Faith Among the Ruins\" and \"Baptism of Rajah Humabon\" at ssthe Missionary Art Exhibit in Rome. In 1979, Fernando Amorsolo's legacy as a painter was celebrated through an exhibition of his works at the Art Center of the Manila Hilton. His art was also featured in a 2007 exhibition in Havana.\n\nDuring his lifetime, Amorsolo was married twice and had 20 children. In 1916, he married Salud Tolentino Jorge, with whom he had six children. Amorsolo's first wife died in 1931 leaving him with six children. He had six more children by a common-law wife, named Virginia Guevarra Santos. Amorsolo have three children with her namely Manuel (followed in his father's footstep, with a degree in Fine Arts from the University of the Philippines), Jorge and Norma when he met his second wife. Subsequently, Virginia found an engagement ring in one of Amorsolo's drawers; she knew about Maria, that prompted her to leave his house with her three children. In 1935, he married Maria del Carmen who gave him eight more children. Among her daughters are Sylvia Amorsolo-Lazo and Luz. But as Maria was giving birth with his children, Virginia had three more children with Amorsolo. His reputation was growing as fast as his brood and his work was more than enough to provide for his rather large family. Six of Amorsolo's children became artists themselves.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "309664", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=309664", "title": "Fog of war", "text": "Fog of war\n\nThe fog of war () is the uncertainty in situational awareness experienced by participants in military operations. The term seeks to capture the uncertainty regarding one's own capability, adversary capability, and adversary intent during an engagement, operation, or campaign. Military forces try to reduce the fog of war through military intelligence and friendly force tracking systems. The term is also used to define uncertainty mechanics in wargames.\n\nThe word \"fog\" in reference to uncertainty in war was introduced by the Prussian military analyst Carl von Clausewitz in his posthumously published book, \"Vom Kriege\" (1832), which appeared in English translation in 1873 under the title \"On War\":\n\nIt has been pointed out that von Clausewitz does not use the exact phrase \"fog of war,\" using multiple similar metaphors such as \"twilight\" and \"moonlight\" to describe lack of clarity. It was not until 1896 when the exact phrase \"fog of war\" was used in text, described as \"the state of ignorance in which commanders frequently find themselves as regards the real strength and position, not only of their foes, but also of their friends.\"\n\nThe fog of war is a reality in all military conflict. Precision and certainty are unattainable goals, but modern military doctrine suggests a trade off of precision and certainty for speed and agility. Militaries employ command and control (C2) systems and doctrine to partially alleviate the fog of war.\n\nThe term also applies to the experience of individual soldiers in battle: often cited is the pure confusion of direction, location, and perspective on a battlefield. Officers and soldiers become separated, orders become confused and subject to revision with poor communication. Sounds and vision are limited from the perspective of the individual and may not be easily resolved, resulting in a continuing uncertainty, a perceptual \"fog\".\n\nThe fog of war has been decreasing as intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance technology is improving. In 2016, Chief of Staff of the United States Army Gen. Mark A. Milley stated that \"On the future battlefield, if you stay in one place longer than two or three hours, you will be dead..With enemy drones and sensors constantly on the hunt for targets, there won’t even be time for four hours’ unbroken sleep.\"\n\nAbstract and military board games sometimes try to capture the effect of the fog of war by hiding the identity of playing pieces, by keeping them face down or turned away from the opposing player (as in \"Stratego\") or covered (as in \"Squad Leader\"). Other games, such as the \"Kriegspiel\" chess-variant, playing pieces could be hidden from the players by using a duplicate, hidden game board.\n\nAnother version of fog of war emulation is used by block wargaming where, much like \"Stratego\", the blocks face each player, hiding their value. However, this also allows for incremental damage, where the block is rotated up to four times to indicate battle damage before the unit is eliminated from the playing field.\n\nSolitaire games also by their nature attempt to recreate fog of war using random dice rolls or card draws to determine events. Complex double-blind miniature wargames, including military simulations, may make use of two identical maps or model landscapes, one or more referees providing limited intelligence to the opposing sides, participants in the roles of sub-unit leaders, and the use of radio sets or intercoms.\n\nA computer's ability to effectively hide information from a player is seen as a distinct advantage over board games when simulating war. Fog of war in strategy video games refers to enemy units, and often terrain, being hidden from the player; this is lifted once the area is explored, but the information is often fully or partially re-hidden whenever the player does not have a unit in that area.\n\nThe earliest use of fog of war was in the 1977 game \"Empire\" by Walter Bright. Another early use of fog of war was the 1978 game \"Tanktics\" designed by Chris Crawford, which was criticized for its unreliable and \"confusing\" fog of war system. Crawford in 1982 suggested \"limit[ing] the amount of information available to the human player\" to compensate for the computer's lack of intelligence. In a 1988 \"Computer Gaming World\" article Dave Arneson called fog of war \"one of the biggest 'plus' factors in computer simulations\", while Crawford concluded, using \"Tanktics\" as an example, that video game fog of war systems became less \"fun\" the more realistic they were, leading the medium to instead use simplified systems.\n\nTwo large Blizzard franchises, \"Warcraft\" and \"StarCraft\", use a fog of war which only reveals terrain features and enemy units through a player's reconnaissance. Without a unit actively observing, previously revealed areas of the map are subject to a shroud through which only terrain is visible, but changes in enemy units or bases are not. This is also common in both turn-based and real-time strategy games, such as the \"Total War\" series, \"Age of Empires\" series, , \"Advance Wars\" series, \"Fire Emblem\" series and Sid Meier's \"Civilization\" series.\n\nFog of war gives players an incentive to uncover a game's world. A compulsion to reveal obscured parts of a map has been described to give a sense of exploring the unknown. Crawford said that \"reasonable\" uses of fog of war, such as needing to send out scouts, \"not only seem natural, but ... add to the realism and excitement of the game\" \"Merchant Prince\" displays over unexplored territory what \"Computer Gaming World\" described as a \"renaissance-style map of dubious accuracy\". In some strategy games that make use of fog of war, enemy AI can get access to complete visibility of the map, which a player may associate with cheating when discovered. A designer may use fog of war to keep a game that has become impossible to win enjoyable, by hiding this fact from the player.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "30655952", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30655952", "title": "Frank Pearson", "text": "Frank Pearson\n\nFrank Pearson (1837–22 December 1899) was an Australian bushranger, operating under the pseudonym \"Captain Starlight.\" Pearson claimed he was the inspiration for a fictional figure of the same name: the character Captain Starlight in Rolf Boldrewood's novel, of 1882–1883, \"Robbery Under Arms\". Boldrewood, who presumably had some insight into the matter, denied the claim and stated that the character was a composite of several bushrangers of the era, including Henry Readford and Thomas Smith, alias \"Captain Midnight\". The cattle thief Readford did not use a pseudonym himself and had no connection with Captain Starlight until the author indicated a possible influence.\n\nPearson's early life is a mystery as he gave a range of different versions of his background. In his earlier prison records he claimed he was born in London and that he had arrived in Australia in 1866. Later he claimed to be from America; he also told friends that he was born in Mexico of a Spanish mother and Irish father. He used so many aliases that his origins are obscure; however, he may have been connected to a family with the surname \"Arnold\".\n\nIn September 1868, as Doctor Frank Pearson, he teamed up with stockman Charley Rutherford and robbed the shop, the Yarrambah Post Office, and Angledool Station in New South Wales before heading to Enngonia also in New South Wales, some from Bourke, New South Wales. Two police constables, McCabe from New South Wales and McManus from Queensland,set out from Walgett, New South Wales to catch the bushrangers but became lost. The Police patrol stopped for supplies in Enngonia and were making a purchase at the Shearer's Inn when Pearson and Rutherford entered the inn yelling \"Bail Up\". Both constables opened fire hitting Pearson in the arm and wrist while Pearson returned fire hitting McCabe in the chest. The two bushrangers then fled to Belalie where they stole fresh horses before continuing down the Darling River to near Pooncarie where they split up and went their separate ways. Pearson travelled north, robbing several stations along the way before heading toward Mount Gunderbooka, south of Bourke. A police party tracked Pearson to Mount Gunderbooka but he eluded them in the thick scrub of the mountain. Based at the foot of the mountain and stationing men at the waterholes to prevent Pearson from access to water, the party chased him for three days before capturing him on Christmas Day, in a small cave, weakened from lack of water and badly bitten by bull ants. Contable McCabe had died from his injury in November and Pearson was charged with murder. Committed for trial on 4 January 1869 Pearson was found guilty at trial on 3 May 1869 and sentenced to death. The sentence was later commuted to life imprisonment and he was released in 1884 after fifteen years. The commutation of his sentence was controversial. There is some evidence to suggest that William Munnings Arnold, Parliamentary Speaker of the time, may have influenced the decision.\nAccording to legend, In 1884 bushrangers stopped at the local police station in Barmera, South Australia, where they locked the police in their own cells. The leader of the gang then rode his horse into the bar of the Overland Corner Hotel and carved his name into the wall. No trace remains of the name and his identity is disputed with some claiming it was Captain Moonlite. However it is known that Pearson was active in the area at the time.\n\nPearson returned to Queensland and in 1887 was arrested for forgery and false pretences, under the name of Frank Gordon (alias Dr Lamb), tried in Rockhampton and sentenced to a year in prison in Brisbane. He was admitted to Boggo Road Gaol and shortly afterwards, transferred to St. Helena Island . It was while in prison here that Pearson boasted that he was the inspiration for Boldrewood’s Captain Starlight. While in prison he met fellow prisoner Major Patrick Edward Pelly and, from his release, Pearson adopted that name. Upon his release from St Helena, Pearson was re-arrested, tried at Toowoomba, and imprisoned (again as Frank Gordon) in the Toowoomba Gaol for another three months. As Patrick \"Frank\" Pelly he lived in South Australia for around two years, working as a drover. He is not known to have committed any serious crimes during this time. In 1896 he moved to Perth where, as Major Patrick Frances Pelly he was employed on the recommendation of the WA Premier, Sir John Forrest, as a clerk-accountant with the Western Australia Geological Survey. In Perth he often related elaborate and false stories of his past as a major in the British army and a member of the Russian Czar’s bodyguard.\n\nOn 22 December 1899, Pearson died after accidentally swallowing cyanide. He was drunk and mistook it for his medicine. He is buried in Karrakatta Cemetery Western Australia.\n"}
{"id": "247827", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=247827", "title": "Gar", "text": "Gar\n\nGars (or garpike) are members of the Lepisosteiformes (or Semionotiformes), an ancient holosteian order of ray-finned fish; fossils from this order are known from the Late Jurassic onwards. The family Lepisosteidae includes seven living species of fish in two genera that inhabit fresh, brackish, and occasionally marine, waters of eastern North America, Central America and the Caribbean islands. Gars have elongated bodies that are heavily armored with ganoid scales, and fronted by similarly elongated jaws filled with long, sharp teeth. All of the gars are relatively large fish, but the alligator gar (\"Atractosteus spatula\") is the largest, as specimens have been reported to be in length; however, they typically grow to and weigh over . Unusually, their vascularised swim bladders can function as lungs, and most gars surface periodically to take a gulp of air. Gar flesh is edible and the hard skin and scales of gars are used by humans; however their eggs are highly toxic.\n\nThe name \"gar\" was originally used for a species of needlefish (\"Belone belone\") found in the North Atlantic and likely taking its name from the Old English word for \"spear\". \"Belone belone\" is now more commonly referred to as the \"garfish\" or \"gar fish\" to avoid confusion with the North American gars of the family Lepisosteidae. Confusingly, the name \"garfish\" is commonly used for a number of other species of the related genera \"Strongylura, Tylosurus\" and \"Xenentodon\" of the family Belonidae.\n\nThe genus name \"Lepisosteus\" comes from the Greek \"lepis\" meaning \"scale\" and \"osteon\" meaning \"bone\". \"Atractosteus\" is similarly derived from Greek, in this case from \"atraktos\", meaning \"arrow.\"\n\nFossil gars are found in Europe, India, South America, and North America, indicating that in times past, these fish had a wider distribution than they do today. Gars are considered to be a remnant of a group of bony fish that flourished in the Mesozoic, and are most closely related to the bowfin. The distribution of the Gar \"Lepisosteidae\" in North America, lies mainly in the shallow, brackish waters off of Texas and Louisiana, and off the eastern coast of Mexico. A few populations are also present in the Great Lakes region of the United States, living in similar shallow waters.\n\nGar bodies are elongated, heavily armored with ganoid scales, and fronted by similarly elongated jaws filled with long, sharp teeth. Their tails are heterocercal, and the dorsal fins are close to the tail.\n\nAs their vascularised swim bladders can function as lungs, most gars surface periodically to take a gulp of air, doing so more frequently in stagnant or warm water when the concentration of oxygen in the water is low. Experiments on the swim bladder has shown that the temperature of the water affects which respiration method the gar will use: aerial or aquatic. They will increase the aerial breathing rate (breathing air) as temperature of the water is increased. Gars can live completely submerged in oxygenated water without access to air and remain healthy while also being able to survive in deoxygenated water if allowed access to air. This adaptation can be the result of environmental pressures and behavioral factors. As a result of this organ, they are extremely resilient and able to tolerate conditions that most other fish could not survive in.\n\nThe gar has paired appendages, including pectoral fins, pelvic fins, while also having an anal fin, caudal fin, and a dorsal fin. The bone structures within the fins are important to study as they can show homology throughout the fossil record. Specifically, the pelvic girdle resembles that of other actinopterygians yet still having some of its own characteristics. Gars have a postcleithrun - which is a bone that is lateral to the scapula, but do not have postpectorals. Proximally to the postcleithrum, the supracleithrum is important as it plays a critical role in opening the gar's jaws. This structure has a unique internal coracoid lamina only present in the Gar species. Proximal to the supracleithrum is the posttemporal bone, which is significantly smaller than other actinopterygians. Gars also have no clavicle bone, although there have been observations of elongated plates within the area.\n\nAll the gars are relatively large fish, but the alligator gar \"Atractosteus spatula\" is the largest. The largest alligator gar ever caught and officially recorded was long, weighed , and was around the girth. Even the smaller species, such as \"Lepisosteus oculatus\", are large, commonly reaching lengths of over , and sometimes much more.\n\nGars tend to be slow-moving fish except when striking at their prey. They prefer the shallow and weedy areas of rivers, lakes, and bayous, often congregating in small groups. They are voracious predators, catching their prey with their needle-like teeth, obtained with a sideways strike of the head. They feed extensively on smaller fish and invertebrates such as crabs. Gars are found across much of North America (for example \"Lepisosteus osseus\"). Although gars are primarily found in freshwater habitats, several species enter brackish waters and a few, most notably \"Atractosteus tristoechus\", are sometimes found in the sea. Some gars travel from lakes and rivers through sewers to get to ponds.\n\nThe gar family contains seven extant species, in two genera:\nFamily Lepisosteidae\n\nGar flesh is edible, and sometimes available in markets, but unlike the sturgeon they resemble, their eggs are highly toxic to humans. Gar eggs are toxic because of a protein toxin called ichthyotoxins. The protein can be denatured when brought to a temperature of 120 degrees celsius. When cooking roe, the temperature does not typically get that high so the protein stays intact and causes severe symptoms. It was once thought that the production of the toxin in gar roe was an evolutionary adaptation to provide protection for the eggs. However, bluegills and channel catfish were fed gar eggs and remained healthy, even though they are the natural predators of the gar eggs. Crayfish were not immune to the toxin and most of the crayfish that ate the roe died. The immunity to the ichthyotoxins in bluegills and catfish suggests that the toxin came about for a reason other than keeping the gar eggs safe. It may just be a coincidence that the roe is toxic to humans and crayfish.\n\nSeveral species are traded as aquarium fish. The hard skin and scales of the gar were used by humans. Native Americans used the scales of the gar as arrowheads, native Caribbeans used the skin for breastplates, and early American pioneers covered the blades of their plows in gar skin. Not much is known about the precise function of the gar in Native American religion and culture, but besides using the gar, Creek and Chickasaw people have ritual \"garfish dances\".\n"}

{"id": "25896603", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25896603", "title": "Hmong women and childbirth practices", "text": "Hmong women and childbirth practices\n\nThe Hmong People society originally from Thailand, Laos, Vietnam, and southeast China. the worldwide Hmong population is about twelve million. The Hmong culture is patrilineal, allowing a husband's family to make all major decisions, even when they solely concern the woman. However, the Hmong women have traditionally carried a large amount of responsibility and some power due to their necessary contribution of food and labor to the family.\n\nHmong children learn gender expectations at a young age. Women belong to their marital family, and before marriage are considered \"other people’s women\" by their birth family or clan. Girls traditionally learned household skills from their female elders by the age of eight. Hmong women worked as housekeepers, child bearers and caretakers, cooks, and tailors, and were responsible for making all of their families’ clothes and preparing all meals. Women also planted, harvested, and cleared fields with their husbands, carried water from the river, tended to the animals, and helped build their own houses and furniture.\n\n\"Marriage is considered vital in every Hmong person's life and is the basis for establishing ties with other family groups.\" Hmong men traditionally chose a bride from another clan, with the man's father arranging the marriage. It was taboo for a man to choose a bride from his own clan. The father would consult with his own relatives and the bride. She could decline the match, but if she and her family agreed, drinks were made and a bride price was discussed. \n\nA traditional Hmong wedding consisted of three separate ceremonies of animal sacrifices and feasts. In the Hmong society, a woman keeps close relationships with her family and never takes her husband’s last name. However, after marriage, she joins her husband’s family to work and live with them. If widowed, a Hmong woman has few choices. According to a Hmong saying, \"Widows cry to death\". The woman’s children belong to her husband’s family and a woman cannot inherit wealth, which leaves her with virtually nothing. If her husband’s brother marries her she can remain in her husband’s family. Polygamy is condoned in Hmong society, but rare.\n\nA large part of Hmong women’s culture is sewing. Hmong women are highly skilled and famous for their fine needlework and embroidery called paj ntaub (flower cloth). Example of this ancient craft can be found in Chinese art albums. Women spend years on one piece of clothing for a wedding or other celebratory attire. The cross-stitching, if done exceptionally well, is so fine it can appear to the naked eye as beading. There are five traditional patterns including an eight-point star, a snail shell, a ram’s head, an elephant’s footprint and a heart, which, when combined create a beautiful display. Women work all day in the fields and in the house and then sew by oil lamp throughout the night so that their children will have appropriate clothes for New Year’s.\n\nHmong families usually consist of many children, fulfilling several crucial purposes. First and foremost, children guarantee the continuation of the lineage and clan. Children also provide helping hands for farm work, housework, and childcare. Being able to produce many children adds to a sense of importance for women, helping them feel a stronger sense of belonging within their clan. Children are also very highly celebrated in Hmong culture, as the Hmong people believe in reincarnation and center their lives around the family.\n\nDuring pregnancy, Hmong women carried out their daily responsibilities until the day they went into labor. A Hmong woman would follow her food cravings to guarantee that her child would not be born with a deformity. Once her water broke she would then walk to the nearest water source and carry water to her house to wash her baby when it was born. \n\nIn the book \"The Spirit Catches You and You Fall Down\", Anne Fadiman discusses a woman who gave birth to twelve of her fifteen children alone in the middle of the night. The woman, Foua, delivered each child into her own hands in completely silence, believing that noise would \"thwart the birth\". The father then cut the umbilical cord and the mother washed her newborn. The father proceeded to dig a deep hole in the dirt floor of the house to bury the placenta. If the baby was a girl the placenta was buried underneath her parents' bed, but if it was a boy it was buried with greater honor under the central column of the house. The Hmong believe that after death a soul returns to its birthplace, retrieves its placental jacket, puts it on, and begins its voyage to the sky. Women had a strict postpartum diet that consisted solely of hot foods and drinks. Cold food would \"make the blood congeal in the womb instead of cleansing it by flowing freely\". These beliefs were closely followed to ensure the continued fertility of the new mother.\n\nA baby was not considered part of the community until a ceremony called the hu plig (soul-calling) occurred three days after its birth. Chickens were sacrificed and if the soul was content in its new body, the chickens' tongues would be curled upward and the skulls translucent. Either string or silver necklaces or bracelets were put on the infant to prevent the soul from wandering from the body. After this ceremony the infant would be named and considered an official member of the human race.\n\nFoua, the woman from \"The Spirit Catches You and You Fall Down\", noted that her personal life was based on her cultural life. Hmong culture is centered around legends, the religion of shamans, souls, high regards for ancestors, and the many rituals and ceremonies the Hmong perform. Women's social life and status is often a direct result of the completion of and attendance at the proper rituals and ceremonies. One Hmong legend tells of a girl who took every man who passed by her as a lover. Eventually, \"her sexual excesses so destroyed her health that she fell ill and died\". In this story, the woman's failure to follow one of the religious tenets of Hmong culture resulted in her death. The Hmong also have stories of great female shamans, showing how social life and cultural life of Hmong women are interrelated. Hmong culture shapes gender roles in that female culture is a culture in itself. The female gender is shaped beginning in childhood and to gain high status, a woman must always fulfill the expectations for the female sex.\n\nThe Hmong people’s way of life changed drastically during the Vietnam War. The United States could not send troops into Laos, so they instead trained Hmong men to fight in the hopes that they could keep Laos an anticommunist nation. Since the Hmong were fighting against Laos, they had to evacuate their homes there and live in refugee camps in Thailand. After the war was over, Thailand closed the refugee camps and Hmong people were dispersed all over the world to Western countries such as the United States, Australia, France, and Canada. The rest of the Hmong people fled to various countries in Asia. \n\nHmong women in the Western world had a difficult time adjusting to a new way of life, having trouble transferring skills they had learned in Asia to a different culture. The newer generation of Hmong women are generally more assimilated. In Fadiman’s book the mother, Foua, declares herself stupid because she is not familiar with American culture. She cannot read or speak English and due to that inability cannot perform simple yet necessary tasks such as grocery shopping. She can no longer farm or provide for her children as she once could.\n\nThe patrilineal and patriarchal family system has changed little since for those Hmong who emigrated to the Global North. Decisions about any family member of either gender are still passed down through the husband's family elders. Women contribute greatly to their families, but in different ways. Women tend to have somewhat more freedom in choosing a husband, but the families of the bride and groom still have the final say in the match. The woman does not live outside the home before she is married to protect her reputation. \n\nChildbirth is also a different process now that hospitals are located in every neighborhood. Once Foua, from Fadiman’s book, relocated to the United States she no longer birthed her own children; a doctor did. She no longer bathed her infants; a nurse took care of it. Foua’s husband brought in the proper postpartum food because the hospital offered only ice water. Often a doctor will not release the placenta to the parents of the newborn and the Hmong fear that they will never recover the placental jackets necessary for afterlife. Over time, the women of this group have lost some of their power and agency. As a result of globalization and assimilation into another culture, women have less control over their lives because they cannot provide food for their families as they did, birth children traditionally, or perform many traditional ceremonies.\n\n\n\n"}

The man's exact cause of death has not been released, but the nature was determined to have been murder. The victim was aged between nineteen and twenty-five, although he may have been up to thirty years old when he died. He was approximately tall at a weight of . His hair was around long and was brown with a reddish tint. He was dressed in a tan shirt with jeans and had both American and Canadian currency in his shirt pocket, leading officers to believe he was of Canadian nationality. Additionally, he was found near the border of the Canadian province of Ontario. A gold and chrome-colored lighter and a set of five Canadian-style keys on a key ring, with the number \"330\" etched in it, were also found with the remains. The man's belongings and clothing no longer exist, as they were destroyed. He is believed to have died approximately six months before his discovery.\n\nOn February 10, 1987, the body of a young woman, aged 16 to 25 was located in a dump in Detroit, Wayne County, Michigan. The victim was deceased less than two days and had been stabbed to death. She was approximately tall and weighed around . The victim had given birth eight weeks to one year prior and she was lactating. A scar from an episiotomy was also found on her body. Her hair was brown with red and blond highlights and was styled with a long nape with various layers. She was slender, but had an athletic build and an O blood type. Her nails were painted with pink polish and she had brown or hazel eyes. A worn black bikini bottom was the only clothing she wore. Two rings were found on her left hand, one on her index finger and one on her ring finger, indicating she may have been married. She also had pierced ears. Along with some other unidentified decedents from Detroit, the victim was exhumed in 2014 for additional examination.\n\nThe remains of a woman were found on August 23, 1992 in New Buffalo, Berrien County, Michigan. The victim was nude and between the ages of 65 and 75 when she was murdered. The victim was wrapped in a bed sheet, two garbage bags and a towel and left alongside a highway. Her hands were severed to prevent identification through fingerprint examination. The victim was also missing her dentures, as she had no teeth. The body was at the scene for approximately two days, but she was killed four to seven days before. The woman may have been from a nursing home in Illinois or Indiana. She was believed to have been five feet two inches tall at a weight of around 102 pounds.\n\nThe body of a female between fifteen and twenty-five years old was located in an alley in Highland Park, Wayne County, Michigan on May 20, 1996. The victim's cause of death has not been disclosed, but is considered a homicide. The young woman weighed and was tall. She is presumed to be a mix of white and African-American. Her hair was reddish-brown, curly and tied with a white bow in a ponytail. She wore a distinctive white shirt with yellow smiley faces, a white bra, white socks and black shoes, as well as a teddy-bear shaped wristwatch. Her eyes were brown, like her hair. The victim's teeth had three fillings and untreated decay, although none of them had been removed. She is also believed to have been a tobacco smoker. Other than this, she is believed to have been drug-free. She had O type blood and painted her nails, her fingernails were purple and her toenails were pink. Other distinguishing features included many freckles on her face and a scar under her right knee. The victim also had pelvic inflammatory disease.\n\nIn the afternoon of May 8, 2002, the burned body of a white or Hispanic man was discovered in a wooded area of a blueberry field in Grand Haven, Ottawa County, Michigan. The man was killed by blunt force trauma and was then set on fire after being transported to the area. He had extensive dental work, including a partial dental plate, crowns and restorations. However, they had not been performed within a decade before he died. It is believed that he received such care in the southern United States or Mexico. His clothing included a shirt originating from southern California, boxer shorts and a watch. He was to tall and was fairly healthy when he was alive. His remains were found in a footlocker that was then set on fire. A charred cushion, which was placed below the remains, was also found. Because of the size of the footlocker and the absence of disturbance to the surface of the earth, it is believed that more than one person was involved in disposing the corpse. Because it had rained the morning of the discovery, trace evidence at the scene was no longer available.\n\nOn July 13, 2005, the severely deteriorated body of a 35- to 60-year-old woman was found naked inside an abandoned building in Detroit, Michigan. The woman had extremely poor dentition, possibly due to methamphetamine use. However, the nails on the toes and fingers were well cared for. She had short auburn and grey hair; standing at approximately tall. The skull was reconstructed twice, once with clay and the other by drawing.\n\nAn African-American woman of slender build, reported to be a prostitute, was discovered around a week after her death on June 5, 2006. She had been strangled and had also suffered trauma to the head. She was between 20 and 30 years of age and had been left in a deserted building. The clothing she wore included a red T-shirt, a blue jacket decorated with flags and Nike shoes. One of her front teeth was missing; the oral care was not well performed. Shelley Brooks, a serial killer, confessed to killing her and six other women and remains incarcerated for the rest of his life.\n\nThe partially mummified remains of a woman were located in Detroit, Wayne County, Michigan on March 26, 2009 in an alley. The woman's cause of death is unknown, but she was found without clothing, which indicates homicide. The victim was between 25 and 45 years old, standing around tall. Because of the state of her body, her weight could not be estimated. The Jane Doe was deceased for approximately eight months. Judging by a wad of hair found at the scene, she may have had red or auburn hair when she was alive. Examining the woman's bones suggested that she had borne at least one child and had trauma to her back before she died, which likely caused her pain.\n\n"}

He belonged to the \"gens Aemilia\", one of the oldest patrician families of Ancient Rome.\n\nIn 342, during the dictatorship of Marcus Valerius Corvus, Aemilius served as Magister Equitum. The following year he was elected to his first consulship with Gaius Plautius Venox Hypsaeus. Gaius Plautius led his troops to victories in Priverno and Volsci, while Lucius Aemilius travelled to Samnium where he received the region's ambassadors who demanded peace. The praetor laid the petition of the Samnites before the Senate, and the Senators voted to renew the treaty with them. \n\nAfter the peace was accepted by the Roman Senate, Lucius Aemilius left Samnium. The Roman army was at once recalled, after receiving a year's pay and rations for three months, which the consul had stipulated should be the price of a truce, to last until the envoys should return. According to Livy, Aemilius was encouraged by his colleagues to resign before the end of his term of office because of the impending Latin War. \n\nIn 335 he was appointed dictator (\"dictator comitiorum habendorum causa\"). In 329 Aemilius was again elected to the consulship alongside Gaius Plautius Decianus. There was great alarm at Rome at this time because of a report that the Gauls were marching southward. Accordingly, while Decianus proceeded against Privernum, which was continuing to resist the Romans, Lucius Aemilius began to levy a large army in order to oppose the Gauls. However, the report of the Gaulish invasion proved to be unfounded, so both consuls united their forces against Privernum. The town was taken and Mamercinus, as well as his colleague, obtained a triumph as a result. The capture of this town must have been regarded as a very glorious achievement since Mamercinus received the surname of Privernas. \n\nIn 326 he was selected as interrex. In 316 he again served as dictator (\"dictator rei gerundae causa\"). His primary mission as dictator was to fight the Samnites.\n\n"}

Bednar knew Daynes only through online gaming and had never met him in person until he visited Daynes's flat at Rosebery Road in Grays, Essex, England.\n\nBednar was a student at St Bede's School in Redhill in Surrey, and a member of the Air Training Corps 135 Squadron also in Redhill. He attended St John the Evangelist church in Caterham. His mother described him as relaxed and warm-hearted, with many friends with whom he played games online after school, and passionate about computing.\n\nBednar's parents, Barry Bednar and Lorin LaFave, were born in the United States. The family moved to England from the United States seventeen years before the murder. Barry Bednar, 49, is an oil trader and shipping consultant, described by some sources as a millionaire. Lorin LaFave, 48, is a teaching assistant. The \"Daily Mail\" reported that the couple had divorced in 2006 and that Lorin LaFave was living as a single mother with the four children in their family home in Surrey. The \"London Evening Standard\" reported that the family lives with their three surviving children in a family home in Caterham.\n\nIt was reported that Bednar's mother, Lorin LaFave, \"limited his access to electronics, installed parental controls and forbade him from using the same server as a boy she had grown suspicious of.\" She recalled, \"His personality was changing and his ideology was changing and he was starting to refuse to attend church with us. I felt like it was because of the negative influence of this person.\" According to the \"Daily Mail\", Bednar had been introduced to the 'exclusive' six-person online gaming club at a church youth group. Bednar's mother described Lewis Daynes as controlling the group, with the power to expel members, owning and controlling an Internet chat channel on which members would communicate by voice. She told the \"Daily Mail\" that Daynes had told her son improbable stories, such as donating $2.5 million in bitcoin to Syrian rebels, and had told members they did not need to finish school because he would arrange £100,000 computer technology jobs for them.\n\nIn December 2013 a relative of Breck placed a call to Surrey Police expressing concerns around online grooming. LaFave said she warned British police that her son was in danger. Nonetheless, it was reported, \"The teenagers had been playing games online for several months, despite LaFave's efforts to put an end to their relationship.\"\n\nOn the day of Bednar's death, LaFave's former husband, with whom he had been expected to spend the weekend, sent a text message to tell her that the boy had not arrived. A few hours later his siblings, 12-year-old triplets, began to receive messages that their brother had been killed, describing photos of Bednar that had been posted to social media, which were soon confirmed by the police. The photos, showing Bednar's body, were posted to other members of the six-person online gaming group. Word spread, leading to a friend's text message to one of the triplets, \"Is it true about your brother? If it's true, it's so sad.\" At the same time, police were telling Bednar's parents the news that their son had been murdered.\n\nPolice and paramedics were called to the flat where Bednar was found with stab wounds to his neck, but were unable to prevent him from dying at the scene.\n\nAccording to BBC News, \"Lewis Daynes, 19, of Rosebery Road, Grays, was due to stand trial at Chelmsford Crown Court on a charge of murder but admitted the offence\" before the jury was sworn. Sentencing by Mrs Justice Cox was scheduled for 12 January 2015. Daynes, an unemployed computer engineer, was believed to have met Bednar while playing online video games. \"The Daily Telegraph\" described Daynes as a 'baby-faced killer' who looked 'much younger than his 19 years'. Daynes was reported by the \"Daily Mirror\" to have grown up as an only child, and after his parents split when he was 16 he lived alone in a flat owned by his grandparents; his neighbours described him as 'reclusive'.\n\nProsecutor Richard Whittam QC told the court, \"The prosecution case was that at the time of his murder Breck was aged 14. The law makes specific provision for the murder of a child involving sexual or sadistic motivation. The prosecution have advanced the case on that basis and anticipate doing that again on the date of sentence.\"\n\nSimon Mayo QC, mitigating, said Daynes had Asperger syndrome which \"affects his ability to make sound judgments.\" Mayo also argued that there was not enough evidence to prove that the murder had been premeditated.\n\nDaynes was given a life sentence with a minimum 25-year term. Crown Prosecutor Jenny Hopkins said: \"Our case was that Lewis Daynes, even though he was only 18 when he committed Breck's murder, was a controlling and manipulative individual who carefully planned this crime. [...] The degree of planning and manipulation by Daynes is shocking and when you consider the young ages of perpetrator and victim, it stands out as one of the most cruel, violent and unusual cases we have dealt with.\"\n\nBednar's family established The Breck Foundation to raise awareness of online dangers and promote responsible use of the Internet. His mother was quoted by the BBC: \"I want Breck's tragedy to open the eyes of everyone to recognise the dangers of online predators. It is a very real danger today. We all need to look after each other.\" His mother asked his favourite band, Coldplay, to help raise awareness of online dangers. She told ABC News, \"People think it only happens to anti-social kids, but it's just not true.\"\n\nMs LaFave has called for \"more help from the government for online safety\", saying that she had expected more feedback from Surrey Police and adding, \"I also wasn't recommended to contact CEOP (Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre), which I found out – when it was too late – is a really great agency that would help parents.\"\n\nAfter Daynes' plea in court, Assistant Chief Constable Gavin Stephens said the handling of Bednar's case by Surrey Police had been referred to the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC): \"Following Breck's death we carried out a review of practices in our call handling centre and implemented changes to improve the way information is handled and shared. Due to the prior contact the case was referred to the IPCC. They have since decided to conduct an independent investigation into the actions taken by Surrey Police following this communication.\"\n\nAccording to ABC News, the family was \"filing a lawsuit against Essex and Surrey police over the handling of the case.\" In March 2016, the family accepted a settlement in which Surrey Police apologised for their mishandling of the case, and paid an undisclosed sum in compensation.\n\nIn January 2016, BBC Three broadcast a drama-documentary about the murder entitled \"Murder Games: The Life and Death of Breck Bednar\". It was alleged, in January 2016, that Daynes had been blogging from prison.\n\nIn March 2018 in the U.S., the story was depicted on the Investigation Discovery channel in 'Dangerous Games' episode on \"Web of Lies\" series.\n\nIn 2015, Bednar's murder was featured in the US series \"Stalkers Who Kill\" in the episode titled \"Babyface Killer\".\n"}

It was considered one of the U.S.'s most famous trees, and drew thousands of visitors annually.\nIt was estimated to have been more than 1,000 years old, and measured in diameter; its exact age and height were not known.\nThe tree was topped before 1859. It fell and shattered during a storm on January 8, 2017.\n\nThe Pioneer Cabin Tree got its name from its distinctively hollow trunk, partially burnt by lightning strikes and forest fire.\nIt had small compartments as in a log cabin, the tree's burnt core as a chimney, and a small opening as a backdoor.\n\nIn 1857 it was noted that the \"top half\" of the tree was broken off at about 150 feet, and that the tree was hollow.\n\nIn early 1880s,\na tunnel was cut through the compartments by a private land owner at the request of James Sperry, founder of the Murphys Hotel, so that tourists could pass through it.\nThe tree was chosen in part because of the large forest fire scar. The Pioneer Cabin Tree emulated the tunnel carved into Yosemite's Wawona Tree, and was intended to compete with it for tourists.\n\nSince the 1880s and for more than 50 years, visitor graffiti was encouraged, but this practice was prohibited in the 1930s. At first only pedestrians were allowed to pass through the tree.\nLater, for many years, automobiles drove through it as part of the \"Big Trees Trail\". It was one of several drive-through trees in California.\nSubsequently, only hikers were allowed to pass through the tree's tunnel as part of the North Grove Loop hiking trail.\n\nThe Pioneer Cabin Tree fell during a rain storm and flooding on January 8, 2017. It was the strongest storm to hit the area in over a decade. The flooding, combined with the shallow root system of giant sequoias, likely caused it to fall. A park volunteer reported that the tree had been weakening, becoming brittle and leaning to one side for several years, with only a single branch remaining alive. It had been weakened by the severe damage caused by the tunnel carved through its trunk. The tree shattered on impact with the ground.\n\nAfter the fall of the tree the park trail closed for a cleanup operation. Some sections of the tree remained intact, but the park's preservation policy prevented them from being cut up, for example to determine the tree's exact age.\n\nAt least one observer suggested that the tree fell victim to the profit motive and greed, not just a storm. It was one of several trees that were mutilated to promote tourism. California State Parks supervising ranger Tony Tealdi said that today the hollowing out of a tree would not be permitted.\n\nThis was one of several trees that were hollowed out for the amusement of tourists.\nThe two giant sequoia drive-through trees have both fallen:\n\nTwo walk-through giant sequoia tunnel trees still stand:\n\nTwo others have edifices carved within:\n\nTunnel Log is a fallen giant sequoia tree in Sequoia National Park. The tree, which measured 275 feet (84 m) tall and 21 feet (6.4 m) in diameter, fell across a park road in 1937 due to natural causes. The following year, a crew cut an 8-foot (2.4 m) tall, 17-foot (5.2 m) wide tunnel through the trunk, making the road passable again.\n\nThere are three coast redwood trees that can be driven through near US 101 in northern California, namely: Klamath Tour Thru Tree; Shrine Drive-Thru Tree; and Chandelier Tree.\n\nThe loss of the Pioneer Cabin Tree occasioned an encomium to other important trees that still remain.\n\n"}

The story focuses on the player who has been turned into a Pokémon and has developed amnesia who later joins a rescue team with a partner Pokémon while finding out who they are. The game received mixed reviews, being criticized for the repetitive nature of the changing dungeons but praised for its addictive nature. As of July 25, 2007, \"Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Blue Rescue Team\" had sold 3.08 million copies worldwide. Two sequels, , were released in Japan on September 13, 2007, and in North America on April 20, 2008. They featured Generation IV Pokémon, improved Wi-Fi features, and more touchscreen options.\n\nThe games received moderately positive reviews, with praise for their originality, while their gameplay and poor visuals were criticized. By 2007, the two games had accumulated lifetime sales of over 5.25 million copies. \"Red Rescue Team\" and \"Blue Rescue Team\" were released on the European Wii U Virtual Console on February 11, 2016 and on the Japanese Wii U Virtual Console on March 23, 2016. They were released on the North American Wii U Virtual Console on June 23, 2016.\n\nThe player starts out as a human who turned into a Pokémon, which can be one of sixteen Pokémon (Bulbasaur, Squirtle, Charmander, Cyndaquil, Totodile, Chikorita, Treecko, Torchic, Mudkip, Pikachu, Eevee, Machop, Cubone, Psyduck, Meowth, and Skitty) and is determined by a personality quiz taken at the beginning of the game. The player chooses a partner Pokémon which is one of ten Pokémon (which excludes the last six stated above and the Pokémon of the same type). The game is mission-based with many jobs, which can be found on the bulletin board, requested by mail, or initiated through story events, and include rescuing Pokémon, delivering items, and escorting clients. If the player successfully completes a job, they receive a reward, and Rescue Points, which increase a team's rank.\n\nThese jobs take part in dungeons, of which the layout is randomized. The objective is to either finish a job, or go through all the floors to find the exit. In the dungeon, there are wild Pokémon that battle with the player's team. These battles are turn-based, and take place in the dungeon map. Pokémon fight using the four moves they know, by using a standard 'A button' attack, or using projectiles and other items. While going through the dungeon, the player gets hungry and has to eat food, either found in the dungeon or bought in advance.\n\nThe player will fail if the main character is defeated. Before the credits, the player will also fail if the partner is defeated. However, supplementary allies (including the partner, after the credits) can be lost, at which point they will return to the base.\n\nThe player wakes up one day finding that they have been transformed into a Pokémon, without any memory of their past. In a world devastated by many natural disasters — that have only begun to happen quite recently — the player and a newly made friend join forces and form a rescue team. The team meets other rescue teams, including a top-ranked rescue team consisting of Alakazam, Charizard, and Tyranitar, named Team ACT. The team makes enemies unwittingly with another rescue team, Team Meanies, consisting of Gengar, Ekans, and Medicham, who seek world domination under the disguise of a rescue team. Not far into the storyline, the player is told of a legend about a Ninetales laying a curse on a human who had deliberately grabbed Ninetales' tail. Ninetales predicted that the human would eventually be reborn as a Pokémon, and that the natural balance of the world would be upset. In the quest to discover the player's lost memory and purpose as a Pokémon, the team journeys to where the fortune-teller Xatu resides. Xatu is quick to realize that the player was once a human and tells that the player's human-to-Pokémon transformation is tied together with the natural disasters. This conversation is eavesdropped upon by Team Meanies' Gengar, who reveals the player's secret to the townsfolk and says that eliminating the human-turned-Pokémon in the legend would return the world to normal.\n\nThey are confronted by Alakazam, who says the Pokémon held a town meeting on what they must do to save the world: they must find and kill the player and anyone who sides with them. As they give the team one night to get away, the two leave Pokémon Square as fugitives and make their way to the northeasternmost part of the world in an effort to elude the teams that are now hunting them down. Along the way, they encounter the legendary birds Moltres and Articuno, who feel the effects of the disasters in their respective areas. They befriend an Absol who seeks to find the true cause of the natural disasters. The trio reaches the top of Mt. Freeze only to be cornered by Team ACT. They get ready to finish the player and partner off, but are stopped by Ninetales, who reveals that the player is not the human in the legend and that the world is in greater danger caused by the awakening of Groudon. Team ACT proceeds to try and stop Groudon, while the team heads home to clear all remaining suspicion at Pokémon Square. After a few days, the player and the partner worry, as Team ACT has not come back from their mission to quell Groudon. Asking to rescue the missing Team ACT, Lombre refuses to let them go, saying there are plenty of tougher Pokémon than them. Shiftry convinces three of the strongest Pokémon, Blastoise, Octillery, and Golem, to form a special rescue team and rescue Team ACT. After a few days, the special team returns defeated.\n\nAfter being discouraged by Gengar, the player and partner are able to get everyone's spirits back up, and volunteer to rescue Team ACT themselves. When the team reaches Magma Cavern, they find Charizard and Tyranitar defeated, with Alakazam fighting against Groudon alone before quickly being defeated. The team takes matters into their own hands and defeat Groudon. They return to town as heroes, but their celebration is short-lived as grave news arrives from Xatu. A huge meteor, revealed to be the true cause of the natural disasters, is heading for the world, threatening to destroy it. The only way to stop it is to ask for help from the sky guardian Rayquaza. It is less than cooperative, but after a battle, Rayquaza agrees to use its Hyper Beam to destroy the meteor. The team reawakens on the ground, surrounded by their supporters, where they find that the world is safe once again. However, the player must return to being a human and leave the Pokémon world behind. After the credits roll, the player returns to the rescue team base in Pokémon form and surprises everybody. \n\nAs time passes, many more secrets are revealed. A shard of the destroyed meteor opens a secret cave under Whiscash Pond, enabling evolution. It is later revealed that another shard hit Latias' wing, and the team rescues her at Pitfall Valley. It is eventually discovered that Gengar was the human from the legend; after uncomfortably getting the player's assistance, he manages to remove the part of the curse that affected his old partner Gardevoir.\n\nFirst revealed in August 2005, the Japanese release date was announced in September. More details were released later that month, showing information about the gameplay and plot. In November, Nintendo announced a bug in \"Blue Rescue Team\" version, when connecting to the Game Boy Advance slot to link up with \"Red Rescue Team\". If the user had any other game besides \"Red Rescue Team\", it would erase any game files the game has. Nintendo started shipment of replacement DS cards on December 8. At E3 2006, Nintendo announced the English release of the games and revealed the release date later that month.\n\nThe game has received mixed to positive reviews. IGN rated the game a \"Passable\" 6.5, feeling that the DS version could have been better if it did not have to be made for Game Boy Advance. They stated, \"For a game that encourages team play, it's amazing that Chunsoft missed the boat when it comes to exploring dungeons and finishing missions with a friend\". The game has been criticized for its visuals, with reviewers stating that the DS version does not improve graphically on the GBA version. GameSpot gave it a 5.2, stating, \"No matter how much you claim to love Pokémon, you should probably skip Pokémon Mystery Dungeon\", further stating, \"Chunsoft's dungeon hack game wasn't that good to begin with, and the injection of Pokémon elements hasn't done a thing to change that\". 1UP gave the games an A-, saying, \"you may realize the game isn't 'perfect,' but somehow it's addictive\". GameSpy gave it a 4/5, stating, \"It may confuse some and frustrate others, but its addictive nature should keep you hooked until you learn to appreciate the art of the dungeon crawl\". Nintendo Power gave the game an 80/100, saying, \"Mystery Dungeon is not perfect, but its robust and original aspects form a game more solid than many expected\". Electronic Gaming Monthly gave the game a 7.2/10, stating, \"storing and retrieving items is too much of a hassle\"; they also did not like that when the player faints, they lose all of their valuable items.\n\nBy the end of 2006, \"Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Blue Rescue Team\" had sold over 761,000 copies in Japan, while \"Red Rescue Team\" had sold just over 715,000 copies. As of July 25, 2007, \"Blue Rescue Team\" has sold 3.08 million copies worldwide while \"Red Rescue Team\" sold 2.20 million copies by March 31.\n\n and are a matched pair of \"Pokémon\" games for the Nintendo DS. The two games were released in Japan on September 13, 2007, and in North America on April 20, 2008. New features include the addition of Generation IV Pokémon, improved Wi-Fi features, and more touchscreen options.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "19995454", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19995454", "title": "Rotating locomotion in living systems", "text": "Rotating locomotion in living systems\n\nSeveral organisms are capable of rolling locomotion; however, true wheels and propellers—despite their utility in human vehicles—do not appear to play a significant role in the movement of living things (with the exception of certain flagella, which function like corkscrews). Biologists have expounded on the reasons for this apparent absence of biological wheels, and wheeled creatures have appeared often in speculative fiction.\n\nGiven the ubiquity of the wheel in human technology, and the existence of biological analogues of many other technologies (such as wings and lenses), the lack of wheels in the natural world would seem to demand explanation—and the phenomenon is broadly explained by two main factors. First, there are several developmental and evolutionary obstacles to the advent of a wheel by natural selection, addressing the question \"Why can't life evolve wheels?\" Secondly, wheels are often at a competitive disadvantage when compared with other means of propulsion (such as walking, running, or slithering) in natural environments, addressing the question \"If wheels \"could\" evolve, why might they be rare nonetheless?\" This environment-specific disadvantage also explains why at least one historical civilization abandoned the wheel as a mode of transport.\n\nThere exist two distinct modes of locomotion using rotation: first, simple rolling; and second, the use of wheels or propellers, which spin on an axle or shaft, relative to a fixed body. While many creatures employ the former mode, the latter is restricted to microscopic, single-celled organisms.\n\nSome organisms use rolling as a means of locomotion. These examples do not constitute the use of a wheel, as the organism rotates as a whole, rather than employing separate parts which rotate independently.\n\nSeveral species of elongate organisms form their bodies into a loop to roll, including certain caterpillars (which do so to escape danger), tiger beetle larvae, myriapods, mantis shrimp, Armadillidiidae, and Mount Lyell salamanders. Other species adopt more spherical postures, primarily to protect their bodies from predators; this posture has been seen in pangolins, wheel spiders, hedgehogs, armadillos, Armadillo girdled lizards, isopods, and fossilized trilobites. Pangolins and wheel spiders have been observed to purposely roll away from predators. These species may roll passively (under the influence of gravity or wind) or actively, typically by altering their shape to generate a propulsive force.\n\nTumbleweeds, which are the above-ground portions of certain plants, separate from their root structure and roll in the wind to distribute their seeds. These plants are found especially in open plain environments. The most well-known of these include \"Kali tragus\" (also known as \"Salsola tragus\"), or prickly Russian thistle, which arrived in North America in the late 19th century, and gained a reputation as a noxious weed. Fungi of the genus \"Bovista\" are known to use the same strategy to disperse their spores.\n\nRotifers are a phylum of microscopic but multi-celled animals, typically found in freshwater environments. Although the Latin name \"rotifer\" means 'wheel-bearer', these organisms do not have any rotating structures, but rather a ring of rhythmically beating cilia used for feeding and propulsion.\n\nKeratinocytes, a type of skin cell, migrate with a rolling motion during the process of wound healing. These cells serve to form a barrier against pathogens and moisture loss through wounded tissue.\n\nDung beetles form spherical balls of animal excrement, which they roll with their bodies, generally by walking backwards and pushing the ball with their rear legs. Phylogenetic analysis indicates that this rolling behavior evolved independently several times. The behavior of these beetles was noted in ancient Egyptian culture, which imparted sacred significance to their activities. Although it is the dung ball that rolls rather than the beetle itself, the beetles face many of the same mechanical difficulties that rolling organisms contend with.\n\nAmong animals, there exists a single known example of an apparently freely-rotating structure, though it is used for digestion rather than propulsion: the crystalline style of certain bivalves and gastropods. The style consists of a transparent glycoprotein rod which is continuously formed in a cilia-lined sac and extends into the stomach. The cilia rotate the rod, so that it becomes wrapped in strands of mucus. As the rod slowly dissolves in the stomach, it releases digestive enzymes. Estimates of the speed of rotation of the style \"in vivo\" vary significantly, and it is unclear if the style is rotated continuously or intermittently.\n\nThere are two known examples of molecular-scale rotating structures used by living cells. ATP synthase is an enzyme used in the process of energy storage and transfer. It bears some similarity to the flagellar motors discussed below. ATP synthase is thought to have arisen by modular evolution, in which two subunits with their own functions have become associated and gained a new functionality.\nThe only known example of a biological \"wheel\"—a system capable of providing continuous propulsive torque about a fixed body—is the flagellum, a corkscrew-like tail used by single-celled prokaryotes for propulsion. The bacterial flagellum is the best known example. About half of all known bacteria have at least one flagellum, indicating that rotation may in fact be the most common form of locomotion in living systems, though its use is restricted to the microscopic environment.\n\nAt the base of the bacterial flagellum, where it enters the cell membrane, a motor protein acts as a rotary engine. The engine is powered by proton motive force, i.e. by the flow of protons (hydrogen ions) across the bacterial cell membrane due to a concentration gradient set up by the cell's metabolism. (In species of the genus \"Vibrio\", there are two kinds of flagella, lateral and polar, and some are driven by a sodium ion pump rather than a proton pump.) Flagella are quite efficient, allowing bacteria to move at speeds of up to 60 cell lengths per second. The rotary motor at the base of the flagellum is similar in structure to ATP synthase. \"Spirillum\" bacteria have helical bodies with flagella at either end, and they spin about the central axis of their bodies as they move through the water.\n\nArchaea, a group of prokaryotes separate from bacteria, also feature flagella – known as archaella – driven by rotary motor proteins, which are structurally and evolutionarily distinct from bacterial flagella: whereas bacterial flagella evolved from the bacterial Type III secretion system, archaella appear to have evolved from type IV pili.\n\nSome eukaryotic cells, such as the protist \"Euglena\", also have flagella, but eukaryotic flagella do not rotate at the base; rather, they bend in such a way that the tip of the flagellum whips in a circle. The eukaryotic flagellum, also called a cilium or undulipodium, is structurally and evolutionarily distinct from prokaryotic flagella.\n\nThe absence of wheels in nature is frequently attributed to constraints imposed by biology: natural selection constrains the evolutionary paths available to species, and the processes by which multicellular organisms grow and develop may not permit the construction of a functioning wheel.\n\nThe processes of evolution, as they are presently understood, can help explain why wheeled locomotion has not evolved in multicellular organisms: simply put, a complex structure or system will not evolve if its incomplete form provides no benefit to the organism.\n\nAccording to neo-Darwinism, adaptations are produced incrementally through natural selection, so major genetic changes will usually spread within populations only if they do not decrease the fitness of individuals. Although neutral changes (ones which provide no benefit) can spread through genetic drift, and detrimental changes can spread under some circumstances, large changes that require multiple steps will occur only if the intermediate stages increase fitness. Richard Dawkins describes the matter: \"The wheel may be one of those cases where the engineering solution can be seen in plain view, yet be unattainable in evolution because it lies [on] the other side of a deep valley, cutting unbridgeably across the massif of Mount Improbable.\" In such a fitness landscape, wheels might sit on a highly favorable \"peak\", but the valley around that peak may be too deep or wide for the gene pool to migrate across by genetic drift or natural selection. Stephen Jay Gould notes that biological adaptation is limited to working with available components, commenting that \"wheels work well, but animals are debarred from building them by structural constraints inherited as an evolutionary legacy\".\n\nNatural selection therefore explains why wheels are an unlikely solution to the problem of locomotion: a partially evolved wheel, missing one or more key components, would probably not impart an advantage to an organism. The exception to this is the flagellum, the only known example of a freely rotating propulsive system in biology; in the evolution of flagella, individual components were recruited from older structures, where they performed tasks unrelated to propulsion. The basal body that is now the rotary motor, for instance, might have evolved from a structure used by the bacterium to inject toxins into other cells. This recruitment of previously evolved structures to serve new functions is called \"exaptation\".\n\nMolecular biologist Robin Holliday has written that the absence of biological wheels argues against creationist or intelligent design accounts of the diversity of life, because an intelligent creator—free of the limitations imposed by evolution—would be expected to deploy wheels wherever they would be of use.\n\nUsing human manufacturing processes, wheeled systems of varying complexity have proven fairly simple to construct, and issues of power transmission and friction have proven tractable. It is not clear, however, that the vastly different processes of embryonic development are suited to—or even capable of—producing a functioning wheel, for reasons described below.\n\nThe greatest anatomical impediment to wheeled multicellular organisms is the interface between the static and rotating components of the wheel. In either a passive or driven case, the wheel (and possibly axle) must be able to rotate freely relative to the rest of the machine or organism. Unlike animal joints, which have a limited range of motion, a wheel must be able to rotate through an arbitrary angle without ever needing to be \"unwound\". As such, a wheel cannot be permanently attached to the axle or shaft about which it rotates (or, if the axle and wheel are fixed together, the axle cannot be affixed to the rest of the machine or organism). There are several functional problems created by this requirement.\n\nIn the case of a driven wheel, a torque must be applied to generate the locomotive force. In human technology, this torque is generally provided by a motor, of which there are many types, including electric, piston-driven, turbine-driven, pneumatic, and hydraulic. (Torque may also be provided by human power, as in the case of a bicycle.) In animals, motion is typically achieved by the use of skeletal muscles, which derive their energy from the metabolism of nutrients from food. Because these muscles are attached to both of the components that must move relative to each other, they are not capable of directly driving a wheel. In addition, large animals cannot produce high accelerations, as inertia increases rapidly with body size.\n\nReducing friction is vital for minimizing wear on mechanical components and preventing overheating. As the relative speed of the components rises, and as the contact force between them increases, the importance of friction mitigation increases. Various types of bearing and/or lubricant may be used to reduce friction at the interface between two components. In biological joints such as the human knee, friction is reduced by means of cartilage with a very low friction coefficient, as well as lubricating synovial fluid, which has very low viscosity. Gerhard Scholtz of Humboldt University of Berlin asserts that a similar secreted lubricant or dead cellular material could allow a biological wheel to rotate freely.\n\nAnother potential problem that arises at the interface between wheel and axle (or axle and body) is the limited ability of an organism to transfer materials across this interface. If the tissues that make up a wheel are living, they will need to be supplied with oxygen and nutrients and have wastes removed to sustain metabolism. A typical animal circulatory system, composed of blood vessels, would not be able to provide transportation across the interface. In the absence of circulation, oxygen and nutrients would need to diffuse across the interface, a process that would be greatly limited by the available partial pressure and surface area, in accordance with Fick's law of diffusion. For large multicellular animals, diffusion would be insufficient. Alternatively, a wheel could be composed of excreted, nonliving material such as keratin, of which hair and nails are composed.\n\nWheels incur mechanical and other disadvantages in certain environments and situations that would represent a decreased fitness when compared with limbed locomotion. These disadvantages suggest that, even barring the biological constraints discussed above, the absence of wheels in multicellular life may not be the \"missed opportunity\" of biology that it first seems. In fact, given the mechanical disadvantages and restricted usefulness of wheels when compared with limbs, the central question can be reversed: not \"Why does nature not produce wheels?\", but rather, \"Why do human vehicles not make more use of limbs?\" The use of wheels rather than limbs in most engineered vehicles can likely be attributed to the complexity of design required to construct and control limbs, rather than to a consistent functional advantage of wheels over limbs.\n\nAlthough stiff wheels are more energy efficient than other means of locomotion when traveling over hard, level terrain (such as paved roads), wheels are not especially efficient on soft terrain such as soil, because they are vulnerable to rolling resistance. In rolling resistance, a vehicle loses energy to the deformation of its wheels and the surface on which they are rolling. Smaller wheels are especially susceptible to this effect. Softer surfaces deform more and recover less than firm surfaces, resulting in greater resistance. Rolling resistance on medium to hard soil can be five to eight times greater than on concrete, and on sand it can be ten to fifteen times greater. While wheels must deform the surface along their entire path, limbs induce only a small, localized deformation around the region of foot contact.\n\nRolling resistance is also the reason at least one historical human civilization abandoned the use of wheels. During the time of the Roman Empire, wheeled chariots were common in the Middle East and North Africa; yet when the Empire collapsed and its roads fell into disrepair, wheels fell out of favor with the local populations, who turned to camels to transport goods in the sandy desert climate. In his book \"Hen's Teeth and Horse's Toes\", Stephen Jay Gould explains this curiosity of history, asserting that, in the absence of maintained roads, camels required less manpower and water than a cart pulled by oxen.\n\nWhen moving through a fluid, rotating systems carry an efficiency advantage only at extremely low Reynolds numbers (i.e. viscosity-dominated flows) such as those experienced by bacterial flagella, whereas oscillating systems have the advantage at higher (inertia-dominated) Reynolds numbers. Whereas ship propellers typically have efficiencies around 60% and aircraft propellers up to around 80% (achieving 88% in the human-powered \"Gossamer Condor\"), much higher efficiencies, in the range of 96%–98%, can be achieved with an oscillating flexible foil like a fish tail or bird wing.\n\nWheels are prone to slipping—an inability to generate traction—on loose or slippery terrain. Slipping wastes energy and can potentially lead to a loss of control or becoming stuck, as with an automobile on mud or snow. This limitation of wheels can be seen in the realm of human technology: in an example of biologically inspired engineering, legged vehicles find use in the logging industry, where they allow access to terrain too challenging for wheeled vehicles to navigate. Tracked vehicles suffer less from slipping than wheeled vehicles, owing to their larger contact area with the ground—but they tend to have larger turning radii than wheeled vehicles, and they are less efficient and more mechanically complex.\n\nWork by engineer Mieczysław G. Bekker implies that the distribution of irregularities in natural terrains is log-normal; that is, small obstacles are far more common than larger ones. Thus, obstacle navigation presents a challenge to locomotion in natural terrains at all size scales. The primary means of obstacle navigation are to go around obstacles and to go over them; each has its attendant challenges.\n\nAnatomist Michael LaBarbera of the University of Chicago illustrates the poor maneuverability of wheels by comparing the turning radii of walking and wheelchair-using humans. As Jared Diamond points out, most biological examples of rolling are found in wide open, hard packed terrain, including the use of rolling by dung beetles and tumbleweeds.\n\nWheels are poor at dealing with vertical obstacles, especially obstacles on the same scale as the wheel itself, and may be unable to climb vertical obstacles taller than about 40% of the wheel height. Because of this limitation, wheels intended for rough terrain require a larger diameter.\n\nIn addition, without articulation, a wheeled vehicle can become stuck on top of an obstacle, with the obstacle between the wheels, preventing them from contacting the ground. Limbs, in contrast, are useful for climbing and are equipped to deal with uneven terrain.\n\nWith unarticulated wheels, climbing obstacles will cause the body of a vehicle to tilt. If the vehicle's center of mass moves outside of the wheelbase or axle track, the vehicle becomes statically unstable, and will tend to tip over. At speed, a vehicle can become dynamically unstable, meaning that it can be tipped over by an obstacle smaller than its static stability limit, or by excessive acceleration or tight turning. Without articulation, this can be an impossible position from which to recover.\n\nLimbs used by animals for locomotion over terrain are frequently also used for other purposes, such as grasping, manipulating, climbing, branch-swinging, swimming, digging, jumping, throwing, kicking, and grooming. With a lack of articulation, wheels would not be as useful as limbs in these roles.\n\nLegends and speculative fiction reveal a longstanding human fascination with rolling and wheeled creatures. Such creatures appear in mythologies from Europe, Japan, pre-Columbian Mexico, the United States, and Australia.\n\nThe hoop snake, a creature of legend in the United States and Australia, is said to grasp its tail in its mouth and roll like a wheel towards its prey. Japanese culture includes a similar mythical creature, the \"Tsuchinoko\". Buer, a demon mentioned in the 16th-century grimoire \"Pseudomonarchia Daemonum\", was described and illustrated in Collin de Plancy's \"Dictionnaire Infernal\" as having radially-arranged arms on which it rolled.\n\nThe Dutch graphic artist M. C. Escher illustrated a rolling creature of his own invention in a 1951 lithograph. Rolling creatures are also featured in works written by comic author Carl Barks, science fiction writers Fredric Brown, George R. R. Martin, and Joan Slonczewski, and in the \"Sonic the Hedgehog\" video game series, which first appeared in 1991.\n\nToy animals with wheels dating from the Pre-Columbian era were uncovered by archaeologists in Veracruz, Mexico, in the 1940s. The indigenous peoples of this region did not use wheels for transportation prior to the arrival of Europeans.\nSeveral twentieth-century writers explored possibilities of wheeled creatures. L. Frank Baum's 1907 children's novel \"Ozma of Oz\" features humanoid creatures with wheels instead of hands and feet, called Wheelers. Their wheels are composed of keratin, which has been suggested by biologists as a means of avoiding nutrient and waste transfer problems with living wheels. Despite moving quickly on firm open terrain, the Wheelers cannot cross sand, and are stymied by obstacles in their path that do not hinder creatures with limbs.\n\nIn the latter half of the twentieth century, wheeled or wheel-using creatures featured in works by fantasy and science fiction writers including Clifford D. Simak, Piers Anthony, David Brin, K. A. Applegate, Philip Pullman, and writing partners Ian Stewart and Jack Cohen. Some of these works address the developmental and biomechanical constraints on wheeled creatures: Brin's creatures suffer from arthritic axles, and Pullman's Mulefa are not born with wheels, but roll on seed pods with which they coevolved.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "15144375", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15144375", "title": "Social network aggregation", "text": "Social network aggregation\n\nSocial network aggregation is the process of collecting content from multiple social network services, such as Instagram, Tumblr, Flickr, LinkedIn, Twitch, YouTube, etc. into one unified presentation. The task is often performed by a social network aggregator (such as Hootsuite, Taggbox and FriendFeed), which pulls together information into a single location, or helps a user consolidate multiple social networking profiles into one profile. Various aggregation services provide tools or widgets to allow users to consolidate messages, track friends, combine bookmarks, search across multiple social networking sites, read RSS feeds for multiple social networks, see when their name is mentioned on various sites, access their profiles from a single interface, provide \"lifestreams\", etc. Social network aggregation services attempt to organize or simplify a user's social networking experience, although the idea has been satirized by the concept of a \"social network aggregator aggregator\".\n\nThere are other related uses of social media aggregators aside from simplifying the user's social networking experiences. Some aggregators are designed to help companies (and bloggers) improve engagement with their brand(s) by creating aggregated social streams that can be embedded into an existing website and customized to look visually intrinsic to the site. This allows potential customers to interact with all the social media posts maintained by the brand without requiring them to jump from site to site. This has the benefit of keeping customers on the brand's site for a longer period of time (increasing \"time on site\" metrics).\n\nSocial network aggregation platforms allow social network members to share social network activities like Twitter, YouTube, Stumbleupon, Digg, Delicious, with other major platforms. All content appears in real time to other members who subscribe to a particular community, which eliminates the need to jump from one social media network to another, trying to keep an eye on one's interests.\n\nSocial network aggregation systems can rely on initiation by publishers or by readers. In the publisher-initiated aggregation systems, the publishers combine their own identities, which make their readers see all aggregated content once subscribed. In the reader-initiated systems (such as Windows Phone 7 people hub and Linked Internet UI), the readers combine the identities of others, which has no impact on the publishers or other readers. The publishers can still keep separate identities for different readers.\n\nTechnically, the aggregation is enabled by APIs provided by social networks. For the API to access a user's actions from another platform, the user will have to give permission to the social-aggregation platform, by specifying the user-id and password of the social media to be syndicated. This concept resembles open ID. In March 2008, \"The Economist\" reported that social network services are only beginning the move away from \"walled gardens\" to more open architectures. Some sites are working together on a \"data portability workgroup\", while others are focusing on a single sign-on system called OpenID to allow users to log on across multiple sites. Historically, the trend from private services to more open ones can be seen across many Internet services from email and instant messaging to the move that early online service providers made to become websites. The OpenSocial initiative aims to bridge the member overlap between various online social network services.\n\nThe attraction of social network aggregation comes from the fact that some users tend to use multiple social networks: they have accounts on several social-networking sites. In November 2007, Alex Patriquin of Compete.com reported on the member overlap between various online social network services:\n\nA 2009 study of 11,000 users\nreported that the majority of MySpace, LinkedIn, and Twitter users also have Facebook accounts.\n\n"}
{"id": "140282", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=140282", "title": "Space habitat", "text": "Space habitat\n\nA space habitat (also called a space colony, space settlement, orbital habitat, orbital settlement or orbital colony) is a type of space station, intended as a permanent settlement rather than as a simple way-station or other specialized facility. No space habitat has been constructed yet, but many design concepts, with varying degrees of realism, have come both from engineers and from science-fiction authors.\n\nThe term \"space habitat\" sometimes includes more broadly colonies built on or in a body other than Earth - such as the Moon, Mars or an asteroid. This article concentrates on self-contained structures envisaged for micro-g environments.\n\nSeveral motivations for building space colonies have been proposed:\n(See: Reasons for space colonization or Space and survival.)\n\nA number of arguments are made for space habitats having a number of advantages:\n\nSpace has an abundance of light produced from the Sun. In Earth orbit, this amounts to 1400 watts of power per square meter. This energy can be used to produce electricity from solar cells or heat engine based power stations, process ores, provide light for plants to grow and to warm space colonies.\n\nEarth-to-space habitat trade would be easier than Earth-to-planetary colony trade, as colonies orbiting Earth will not have a gravity well to overcome to export to Earth, and a smaller gravity well to overcome to import from Earth.\n\nSpace habitats may be supplied with resources from extraterrestrial places like Mars, asteroids, or the Moon (in-situ resource utilization [ISRU]; see Asteroid mining). One could produce breathing oxygen, drinking water, and rocket fuel with the help of ISRU. It may become possible to manufacture solar panels from lunar materials.\n\nMost asteroids have a mixture of materials, that could be mined, and because these bodies do not have substantial gravity wells, it would require low delta-V to draw materials from them and haul them to a construction site.\n\nThere is estimated to be enough material in the main asteroid belt alone to build enough space habitats to equal the habitable surface area of 3,000 Earths.\n\nA 1974 estimate assumed that collection of all the material in the main asteroid belt would allow habitats may be constructed to give an immense total population capacity. Using the free-floating resources of the Solar System, this estimate extended into the trillions.\n\nIf a large area at the rotation axis is enclosed, various zero-g sports are possible, including swimming, hang gliding and the use of human-powered aircraft.\n\nA space habitat can be the passenger compartment of a large spacecraft for colonizing asteroids, moons, and planets. It can also function as one for a generation ship for travel to other planets (see: Space and survival) or distant stars (L. R. Shepherd described a generation starship in 1952 comparing it to a small planet with many people living in it).\n\nThe requirements for a space habitat are many. They would have to provide all the material needs for hundreds or thousands of humans, in an environment out in space that is very hostile to human life.\n\nAir pressure, with normal partial pressures of oxygen(21%), carbon dioxide and nitrogen(78%), is a basic requirement of any space habitat. Basically, most space colony designs concepts envision large, thin-walled pressure vessels. The required oxygen could be obtained from lunar rock. Nitrogen is most easily available from the Earth, but is also recycled nearly perfectly. Also, nitrogen in the form of ammonia () may be obtainable from comets and the moons of outer planets. Nitrogen may also be available in unknown quantities on certain other bodies in the outer solar system. The air of a colony could be recycled in a number of ways. One concept is to use photosynthetic gardens, possibly via hydroponics, or forest gardening. However, these do not remove certain industrial pollutants, such as volatile oils, and excess simple molecular gases. The standard method used on nuclear submarines, a similar form of closed environment, is to use a catalytic burner, which effectively decomposes most organics. Further protection might be provided by a small cryogenic distillation system which would gradually remove impurities such as mercury vapor, and noble gases that cannot be catalytically burned. \n\nOrganic materials for food production would also need to be provided. At first, most of these would have to be imported from Earth. After that, feces recycling should reduce the need for imports. One proposed recycling method would start by burning the cryogenic distillate, plants, garbage and sewage with air in an electric arc, and distilling the result. The resulting carbon dioxide and water would be immediately usable in agriculture. The nitrates and salts in the ash could be dissolved in water and separated into pure minerals. Most of the nitrates, potassium and sodium salts would recycle as fertilizers. Other minerals containing iron, nickel, and silicon could be chemically purified in batches and reused industrially. The small fraction of remaining materials, well below 0.01% by weight, could be processed into pure elements with zero-gravity mass spectrometry, and added in appropriate amounts to the fertilizers and industrial stocks. It is likely that methods would be greatly refined as people began to actually live in space habitats.\n\nLong-term on-orbit studies have proven that zero gravity weakens bones and muscles, and upsets calcium metabolism and immune systems. Most people have a continual stuffy nose or sinus problems, and a few people have dramatic, incurable motion sickness. Most colony designs would rotate in order to use inertial forces to simulate gravity. NASA studies with chickens and plants have proven that this is an effective physiological substitute for gravity. Turning one's head rapidly in such an environment causes a \"tilt\" to be sensed as one's inner ears move at different rotational rates. Centrifuge studies show that people get motion-sick in habitats with a rotational radius of less than 100 metres, or with a rotation rate above 3 rotations per minute. However, the same studies and statistical inference indicate that almost all people should be able to live comfortably in habitats with a rotational radius larger than 500 meters and below 1 RPM. Experienced persons were not merely more resistant to motion sickness, but could also use the effect to determine \"spinward\" and \"antispinward\" directions in the centrifuges.\n\nSome very large space habitat designs could be effectively shielded from cosmic rays by their structure and air. Smaller habitats could be shielded by stationary (nonrotating) bags of rock. Sunlight could be admitted indirectly via mirrors in radiation-proof louvres, which would function in the same manner as a periscope.\n\nThe colony is in a vacuum, and therefore resembles a giant thermos bottle. Habitats also need a radiator to eliminate heat from absorbed sunlight. Very small habitats might have a central vane that rotates with the colony. In this design, convection would raise hot air \"up\" (toward the center), and cool air would fall down into the outer habitat. Some other designs would distribute coolants, such as chilled water from a central radiator.\n\nThe habitat would need to withstand potential impacts from space debris, meteoroids, dust, etc. Most meteoroids that strike the earth vaporize in the atmosphere. Without a thick protective atmosphere meteoroid strikes would pose a much greater risk to a space habitat. Radar will sweep the space around each habitat mapping the trajectory of debris and other man-made objects and allowing corrective actions to be taken to protect the habitat.\nIn some designs (O'Neill/NASA Ames \"Stanford Torus\" and \"Crystal palace in a Hatbox\" habitat designs have a non-rotating cosmic ray shield of packed sand (~1.9m thick) or even artificial aggregate rock (1.7m ersatz concrete). Other proposals use the rock as structure and integral shielding (O'Neill, \"the High Frontier\". Sheppard, \"Concrete Space Colonies\"; Spaceflight, journal of the B.I.S.) In any of these cases, strong meteoroid protection is implied by the external radiation shell ~4.5tonnes of rock material, per square meter.\nSuggestions have been made to layer such protections around a habitat, multiple thicknesses, up to such protection to equal an Earth city (which after all, is completely vulnerable to total obliteration at any second without notice, under the open sky. A small rock such as hit near Chelyabinsk in 2013 being too numerous and hard to detect for any mitigation scenario or advance warning.) With such a shell, mass of a colony goes up sharply, but it is only dumb structure -possibly non-rotating, and rock-dust as industrial slag is a free left-over from processing regolith for metals or volatiles extraction.\nNote that Solar Power Satellites are proposed in the multi-gW ranges, and such energies and technologies would allow constant radar mapping of nearby 3D space out-to arbitrarily far away, limited only by effort expended to do so.\nProposals are available to move even kilometer-sized NEOs to high Earth orbits, and reaction engines for such purposes would move a space colony and any arbitrarily large shield, but not in any timely or rapid manner, the thrust being very low compared to the huge mass.\n\nMost mirror geometries require something on the habitat to be aimed at the sun and so attitude control is necessary. The original O'Neill design used the two cylinders as momentum wheels to roll the colony, and pushed the sunward pivots together or apart to use precession to change their angle.\n\nEven the smallest of the habitat designs mentioned below are more massive than the total mass of all items that humans have ever launched into Earth orbit combined. Prerequisites to building habitats are either cheaper launch costs or a mining and manufacturing base on the Moon or other body having low delta-v from the desired habitat location.\n\nThe optimal habitat orbits are still debated, and so orbital stationkeeping is probably a commercial issue. The lunar and orbits are now thought to be too far away from the moon and Earth. A more modern proposal is to use a two-to-one resonance orbit that alternately has a close, low-energy (cheap) approach to the Moon, and then to the Earth. This provides quick, inexpensive access to both raw materials and the major market. Most colony designs plan to use electromagnetic tether propulsion, or mass drivers used as rocket motors. The advantage of these is that they either use no reaction mass at all, or use cheap reaction mass.\n\nAround 1970, near the end of Project Apollo (1961-1972), Gerard K. O'Neill, an experimental physicist at Princeton University, was looking for a topic to tempt his physics students, most of them freshmen in engineering. He hit upon the idea of assigning them feasibility calculations for large space-habitats. To his surprise, the habitats seemed feasible even in very large sizes: cylinders in diameter and long, even if made from ordinary materials such as steel and glass. Also, the students solved problems such as radiation protection from cosmic rays (almost free in the larger sizes), getting naturalistic Sun angles, provision of power, realistic pest-free farming and orbital attitude control without reaction motors. O'Neill published an article about these colony concepts in \"Physics Today\" in 1974. (See the above illustration of such a colony, a classic \"O'Neill Colony\"). He expanded the article in his 1976 book \"\".\n\nThe result motivated NASA to sponsor a couple of summer workshops led by O'Neill. Several concepts were studied, with sizes ranging from 1,000 to 10,000,000 people. including versions of the Stanford torus. Three concepts were presented to NASA: the Bernal Sphere, the Toroidal Colony and the Cylindrical Colony.\n\nO'Neill's concepts had an example of a payback scheme: construction of solar power satellites from lunar materials. O'Neill did not emphasize the building of solar power satellites as such, but rather offered proof that orbital manufacturing from lunar materials could generate profits. He and other participants presumed that once such manufacturing facilities had started production, many profitable uses for them would be found, and the colony would become self-supporting and begin to build other colonies as well.\n\nThe concept studies generated a notable groundswell of public interest. One effect of this expansion was the founding of the L5 Society in the U.S., a group of enthusiasts that desired to build and live in such colonies. The group was named after the space-colony orbit which was then believed to be the most profitable, a kidney-shaped orbit around either of Earth's lunar Lagrange points 5 or 4.\n\nIn 1977 O'Neill founded the Space Studies Institute, which initially funded and constructed some prototypes of the new hardware needed for a space colonization effort, as well as producing a number of feasibility studies. One of the early projects, for instance, involved a series of functional prototypes of a mass driver, the essential technology for moving ores efficiently from the Moon to space colony orbits.\n\nSome NASA concept studies included:\n\n\nThe following projects and proposals, while not truly space habitats, incorporate aspects of what they would have and may represent stepping stones towards eventually building of space habitats.\n\nThe Nautilus-X Multi-Mission Space Exploration Vehicle (MMSEV): this 2011 NASA proposal for a long-duration crewed space transport vehicle included an artificial gravity compartment intended to promote crew-health for a crew of up to six persons on missions of up to two years duration. The partial-g torus-ring centrifuge would utilize both standard metal-frame and inflatable spacecraft structures and would provide 0.11 to if built with the diameter option.\n\nThe ISS Centrifuge Demo, also proposed in 2011 as a demonstration project preparatory to the final design of the larger torus centrifuge space habitat for the Multi-Mission Space Exploration Vehicle. The structure would have an outside diameter of with a ring interior cross-section diameter and would provide 0.08 to partial gravity. This test and evaluation centrifuge would have the capability to become a Sleep Module for ISS crew.\n\nThe Bigelow Commercial Space Station was announced in mid-2010. The initial build-out of the station is expected in 2014/2015. Bigelow has publicly shown space station design configurations with up to nine modules containing of habitable space. Bigelow began to publicly refer to the initial configuration as \"Space Complex Alpha\" in October 2010.\n\nThe idea of space habitats either in fact or fiction goes back to the second half of the 19th century. \"The Brick Moon\", a fictional story written in 1869 by Edward Everett Hale, is perhaps the first treatment of this idea in writing. In 1903, space pioneer Konstantin Tsiolkovsky speculated about rotating cylindrical space colonies, with plants fed by the sun, in \"Beyond Planet Earth\". In the 1920s John Desmond Bernal and others speculated about giant space habitats. Dandridge M. Cole in the late 1950s and 1960s speculated about hollowing out asteroids and then rotating them to use as settlements in various magazine articles and books, notably \"Islands In Space: The Challenge Of The Planetoids\".\n\nThe space habitats have inspired a large number of fictional societies in science fiction. Some of the most popular and recognizable are in the Japanese Gundam universe, the space station and the space station Babylon 5.\n\nThe 2013 science-fiction movie \"Elysium\" takes place on both a ravaged Earth, and a luxurious rotating wheel space station called Elysium.\n\nIn the 2014 epic film \"Interstellar\", the main character Joseph Cooper wakes up on a space station orbiting Saturn toward the movie's climax.\n\n\n"}

It was approved for use by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on August 4, 1997. Installation is invasive, so it is typically only used when the tremors are incapacitating, and medication is ineffective. Typically, one or more electrodes are implanted in the brain, with subcutaneous leads to a neurostimulator, which may also be implanted. The electrodes stimulate the area of the thalamus, specifically the part of the brain that controls movement and muscle function.\n\nIt is notable that the presence of thalamic stimulators significantly changes ECG patterns, and prevents the use of MRI. It is sometimes regarded as a better alternative to pallidotomy or thalamotomy because it is non-permanent. For optimal installation, the patient is awake during the procedure, and talks to the surgeon to find the best placement. Once in place, the device can be activated and deactivated, for improved effectiveness during the day.\n\nRisks arising from the operation are infection, stroke and dysarthria.\n\nA fictional treatment of the device, out decades before the device itself, can be found in the novel \"The Terminal Man\".\n\n"}

{"id": "98093", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=98093", "title": "Transcranial magnetic stimulation", "text": "Transcranial magnetic stimulation\n\nTranscranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a form of neurostimulation. TMS is a non-invasive procedure in which a changing magnetic field is used to cause electric current to flow in a small targeted region of the brain via electromagnetic induction. During a TMS procedure, a magnetic field generator, or \"coil\", is placed on the scalp. The coil is connected to a pulse generator, or stimulator, that delivers a changing electric current to the coil.\n\nTMS is used diagnostically to measure the connection between the central nervous system and skeletal muscle to evaluate damage in a wide variety of disease states, including stroke, multiple sclerosis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, movement disorders, and motor neuron diseases.\nEvidence suggests it is useful for neuropathic pain and treatment-resistant major depressive disorder. A 2015 Cochrane review found that there was not enough evidence to determine its effectiveness in treating schizophrenia. For schizophrenia negative symptoms another review found possible efficacy. As of 2014, all other investigated uses of repetitive TMS have only possible or no clinical efficacy.\nMatching the discomfort of TMS to distinguish true effects from placebo is an important and challenging issue that influences the results of clinical trials. Adverse effects of TMS are uncommon, and include fainting and rarely seizure. Other adverse effects of TMS include discomfort or pain, hypomania, cognitive changes, hearing loss, and inadvertent current induction in implanted devices such as pacemakers or defibrillators.\nThe use of TMS can be divided into diagnostic and therapeutic uses.\n\nTMS can be used clinically to measure activity and function of specific brain circuits in humans. The most robust and widely accepted use is in measuring the connection between the primary motor cortex and a muscle to evaluate damage from stroke, multiple sclerosis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, movement disorders, motor neuron disease and injuries and other disorders affecting the facial and other cranial nerves and the spinal cord. TMS has been suggested as a means of assessing short-interval intracortical inhibition (SICI) which measures the internal pathways of the motor cortex but this use has not yet been validated.\n\nFor neuropathic pain, for which there is little effective treatment, high-frequency (HF) repetitive TMS (rTMS) appears effective. Unlike vagus nerve stimulation or deep brain stimulation, rTMS does not require surgery or implantation of electrodes. And, unlike electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), rTMS doesn't cause seizures or require sedation with anesthesia. For treatment-resistant major depressive disorder, HF-rTMS of the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) appears effective and low-frequency (LF) rTMS of the right DLPFC has probable efficacy. The Royal Australia and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists has endorsed rTMS for treatment resistant MDD. As of October 2008, the US Food and Drug Administration authorized the use of rTMS as an effective treatment for clinical depression.\n\nAlthough TMS is generally regarded as safe, risks increase for therapeutic rTMS compared to single or paired TMS for diagnostic purposes. In the field of therapeutic TMS, risks increase with higher frequencies.\n\nThe greatest immediate risk is the rare occurrence of syncope (fainting) and even less commonly, induced seizures.\n\nOther adverse short-term effects of TMS include discomfort or pain, transient induction of hypomania, transient cognitive changes, transient hearing loss, transient impairment of working memory, and induced currents in electrical circuits in implanted devices.\n\nDuring a transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) procedure, a magnetic field generator, or \"coil\" is placed near the head of the person receiving the treatment. The coil produces small electric currents in the region of the brain just under the coil via electromagnetic induction. The coil is positioned by finding anatomical landmarks on the skull including, but not limited to, the inion or the nasion. The coil is connected to a pulse generator, or stimulator, that delivers electric current to the coil.\n\nMost devices provide a shallow magnetic field that affects neurons mostly on the surface of the brain, delivered with coil shaped like the number eight. Some devices can provide magnetic fields that can penetrate deeper, are used for deep transcranial magnetic stimulation (deep TMS), and have different types of coils including the H-coil the C-core coil, and the circular crown coil; as of 2013 the H coil used in devices made by Brainsway were the most developed.\n\nNexstim obtained 510(k) FDA clearance for the assessment of the primary motor cortex for pre-procedural planning in December 2009 and for neurosurgical planning in June 2011.\n\nA number of deep TMS have received FDA 510k clearance to market for use in adults with treatment resistant major depressive disorders.\n\nThe use of single-pulse TMS was approved by the FDA for treatment of migraines in December 2013. It is approved as a Class II medical device under the \"\"de novo\" pathway\".\n\nIn the European Economic Area, various versions of Deep TMS H-coils has CE marking for Alzheimer's disease, autism, bipolar disorder, epilepsy chronic pain major depressive disorder Parkinson's disease, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), schizophrenia (negative symptoms) and to aid smoking cessation. One review found tentative benefit for cognitive enhancement in healthy people.\n\nIn August 2018, the US Food and Drug Administration authorized the use of TMS in the treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).\n\nIn 2013, several commercial health insurance plans in the United States, including Anthem, Health Net, and Blue Cross Blue Shield of Nebraska and of Rhode Island, covered TMS for the treatment of depression for the first time. In contrast, UnitedHealthcare issued a medical policy for TMS in 2013 that stated there is insufficient evidence that the procedure is beneficial for health outcomes in patients with depression. UnitedHealthcare noted that methodological concerns raised about the scientific evidence studying TMS for depression include small sample size, lack of a validated sham comparison in randomized controlled studies, and variable uses of outcome measures. Other commercial insurance plans whose 2013 medical coverage policies stated that the role of TMS in the treatment of depression and other disorders had not been clearly established or remained investigational included Aetna, Cigna and Regence.\n\nPolicies for Medicare coverage vary among local jurisdictions within the Medicare system, and Medicare coverage for TMS has varied among jurisdictions and with time. For example:\n\nThe United Kingdom's National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) issues guidance to the National Health Service (NHS) in England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. NICE guidance does not cover whether or not the NHS should fund a procedure. Local NHS bodies (primary care trusts and hospital trusts) make decisions about funding after considering the clinical effectiveness of the procedure and whether the procedure represents value for money for the NHS.\n\nNICE evaluated TMS for severe depression (IPG 242) in 2007, and subsequently considered TMS for reassessment in January 2011 but did not change its evaluation. The Institute found that TMS is safe, but there is insufficient evidence for its efficacy.\n\nIn January 2014, NICE reported the results of an evaluation of TMS for treating and preventing migraine (IPG 477). NICE found that short-term TMS is safe but there is insufficient evidence to evaluate safety for long-term and frequent uses. It found that evidence on the efficacy of TMS for the treatment of migraine is limited in quantity, that evidence for the prevention of migraine is limited in both quality and quantity.\n\nTMS uses electromagnetic induction to generate an electric current across the scalp and skull. A plastic-enclosed coil of wire is held next to the skull and when activated, produces a magnetic field oriented orthogonally to the plane of the coil. The magnetic field passes unimpeded through the skin and skull, inducing an oppositely directed current in the brain that activates nearby nerve cells in much the same way as currents applied directly to the cortical surface.\n\nThe path of this current is difficult to model because the brain is irregularly shaped and electricity and magnetism are not conducted uniformly throughout its tissues. The magnetic field is about the same strength as an MRI, and the pulse generally reaches no more than 5 centimeters into the brain unless using deep transcranial magnetic stimulation. Deep TMS can reach up to 6 cm into the brain to stimulate deeper layers of the motor cortex, such as that which controls leg motion.\n\nFrom the Biot–Savart law\nformula_1 \nit has been shown that a current through a wire generates a magnetic field around that wire. Transcranial magnetic stimulation is achieved by quickly discharging current from a large capacitor into a coil to produce pulsed magnetic fields between 2 and 3 T. By directing the magnetic field pulse at a targeted area of the brain, one can either depolarize or hyperpolarize neurons in the brain. The magnetic flux density pulse generated by the current pulse through the coil causes an electric field as explained by the Maxwell-Faraday equation,\nformula_2 .\nThis electric field causes a change in the transmembrane current of the neuron, which leads to the depolarization or hyperpolarization of the neuron and the firing of an action potential.\n\nThe exact details of how TMS functions are still being explored. The effects of TMS can be divided into two types depending on the mode of stimulation:\n\nThe design of transcranial magnetic stimulation coils used in either treatment or diagnostic/experimental studies may differ in a variety of ways. These differences should be considered in the interpretation of any study result, and the type of coil used should be specified in the study methods for any published reports.\n\nThe most important considerations include:\n\nWith regard to coil composition, the core material may be either a magnetically inert substrate (i.e., the so-called 'air-core' coil design), or possess a solid, ferromagnetically active material (i.e., the so-called 'solid-core' design). Solid core coil design result in a more efficient transfer of electrical energy into a magnetic field, with a substantially reduced amount of energy dissipated as heat, and so can be operated under more aggressive duty cycles often mandated in therapeutic protocols, without treatment interruption due to heat accumulation, or the use of an accessory method of cooling the coil during operation. Varying the geometric shape of the coil itself may also result in variations in the focality, shape, and depth of cortical penetration of the magnetic field. Differences in the coil substance as well as the electronic operation of the power supply to the coil may also result in variations in the biophysical characteristics of the resulting magnetic pulse (e.g., width or duration of the magnetic field pulse). All of these features should be considered when comparing results obtained from different studies, with respect to both safety and efficacy.\n\nA number of different types of coils exist, each of which produce different magnetic field patterns. Some examples:\n\nDesign variations in the shape of the TMS coils allow much deeper penetration of the brain than the standard depth of 1.5–2.5 cm. Circular crown coils, Hesed (or H-core) coils, double cone coils, and other experimental variations can induce excitation or inhibition of neurons deeper in the brain including activation of motor neurons for the cerebellum, legs and pelvic floor. Though able to penetrate deeper in the brain, they are less able to produce a focused, localized response and are relatively non-focal.\n\nLuigi Galvani did pioneering research on the effects of electricity on the body in the late 1700s, and laid the foundations for the field of electrophysiology. In the 1800s Michael Faraday discovered that an electrical current had a corresponding magnetic field, and that changing one, could change the other. Work to directly stimulate the human brain with electricity started in the late 1800s, and by the 1930s electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) has been developed by Italian physicians Cerletti and Bini. ECT became widely used to treat mental illness and became overused as it began to be seen as a \"psychiatric panacea\", and a backlash against it grew in the 1970s. Around that time Anthony T. Barker began exploring use of magnetic fields to alter electrical signalling in the brain, and the first stable TMS devices were developed around 1985. They were originally intended as diagnostic and research devices, and only later were therapeutic uses explored. The first TMS devices were approved by the FDA in October 2008.\n\nTMS research in animal studies is limited due to early FDA approval of TMS treatment of drug-resistant depression. Because of this, there has been no specific coils for animal models. Hence, there are limited number of TMS coils that can be used for animal studies. There are some attempts in the literature showing new coil designs for mice with an improved stimulation profile.\n\nAreas of research include:\n\nIt is difficult to establish a convincing form of \"sham\" TMS to test for placebo effects during controlled trials in conscious individuals, due to the neck pain, headache and twitching in the scalp or upper face associated with the intervention. \"Sham\" TMS manipulations can affect cerebral glucose metabolism and MEPs, which may confound results. This problem is exacerbated when using subjective measures of improvement. Placebo responses in trials of rTMS in major depression are negatively associated with refractoriness to treatment, vary among studies and can influence results.\n\nA 2011 review found that only 13.5% of 96 randomized control studies of rTMS to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex had reported blinding success and that, in those studies, people in real rTMS groups were significantly more likely to think that they had received real TMS, compared with those in sham rTMS groups. Depending on the research question asked and the experimental design, matching the discomfort of rTMS to distinguish true effects from placebo can be an important and challenging issue.\n\n\n"}

From the 1930s to the 1950s, Power appeared in dozens of films, often in swashbuckler roles or romantic leads. His better-known films include \"The Mark of Zorro\", \"Blood and Sand\", \"The Black Swan\", \"Prince of Foxes\", \"Witness for the Prosecution\", \"The Black Rose\", and \"Captain from Castile\". Power's own favorite film among those that he starred in was \"Nightmare Alley\".\n\nThough largely a matinee idol in the 1930s and early 1940s and known for his striking looks, Power starred in films in a number of genres, from drama to light comedy. In the 1950s he began placing limits on the number of films he would make in order to devote more time for theater productions. He received his biggest accolades as a stage actor in \"John Brown's Body\" and \"Mister Roberts\". Power died from a heart attack at the age of 44.\n\nPower was born in Cincinnati, Ohio, in 1914, son of Helen Emma \"Patia\" (née Reaume) and the Irish-ancestry English-born US stage and screen actor Tyrone Power Sr., often known by his first name \"Fred\". Power was descended from a long Irish theatrical line going back to his great-grandfather, the Irish actor and comedian Tyrone Power (1795–1841). Tyrone Power's sister, Ann Power was born in 1915, after the family moved to California. His mother was Roman Catholic, and her ancestry included the French-Canadian Reaume family and Germans from Alsace-Lorraine. Through his paternal great-grandmother, Anne Gilbert, Power was related to the actor Laurence Olivier; through his paternal grandmother, stage actress Ethel Lavenu, he was related by marriage to author Evelyn Waugh; and through his father's first cousin, Norah Emily Gorman Power, he was related to the theatrical director Sir (William) Tyrone Guthrie, founder of the Stratford Festival (now the Stratford Shakespeare Festival) in Canada and the Tyrone Guthrie Theatre in Minneapolis, Minnesota.\n\nPower went to Cincinnati-area Catholic schools and graduated from Purcell High School in 1931. Upon his graduation, he opted to join his father to learn what he could about acting from one of the stage's most respected actors.\n\nPower joined his father for the summer of 1931, after being separated from him for some years due to his parents' divorce. His father suffered a heart attack in December 1931, dying in his son's arms, while preparing to perform in \"The Miracle Man\". Tyrone Power Jr., as he was then known, decided to continue his pursuit of an acting career. He went door to door, trying to find work as an actor, and, while many contacts knew his father well, they offered praise for his father but no work for his son. He appeared in a bit part in 1932 in \"Tom Brown of Culver\", a movie starring actor Tom Brown. Power's experience in that movie did not open any other doors, however, and, except for what amounted to little more than a job as an extra in \"Flirtation Walk\", he found himself frozen out of the movies but making some appearances in community theater. Discouraged, he took the advice of a friend, Arthur Caesar, to go to New York to gain experience as a stage actor. Among the Broadway plays in which he was cast are \"Flowers of the Forest\", \"Saint Joan\", and \"Romeo and Juliet\".\n\nPower went to Hollywood in 1936. The director Henry King was impressed with his looks and poise, and he insisted that Power be tested for the lead role in \"Lloyd's of London\", a role thought already to belong to Don Ameche. Despite his own reservations, Darryl F. Zanuck decided to give Power the role, once King and Fox editor Barbara McLean convinced him that Power had a greater screen presence than Ameche. Power was billed fourth in the movie but he had by far the most screen time of any actor. He walked into the premiere of the movie an unknown and he walked out a star, which he remained the rest of his career.\n\nPower racked up hit after hit from 1936 until 1943, when his career was interrupted by military service. In these years he starred in romantic comedies such as \"Thin Ice\" and \"Day-Time Wife\", in dramas such as \"Suez\", \"Blood and Sand\", \"\", \"The Rains Came\" and \"In Old Chicago\"; in musicals \"Alexander's Ragtime Band\", \"Second Fiddle\", and \"Rose of Washington Square\"; in the westerns \"Jesse James\" (1939) and \"Brigham Young\"; in the war films \"A Yank in the R.A.F.\" and \"This Above All\"; and the swashbucklers \"The Mark of Zorro\" and \"The Black Swan\". \"Jesse James\" was a very big hit at the box office, but it did receive some criticism for fictionalizing and glamorizing the famous outlaw. The movie was shot in and around Pineville, Missouri, and was Power's first location shoot and his first Technicolor movie. (Before his career was over, he had filmed a total of 16 movies in color, including the movie he was filming when he died.) He was loaned out once, to MGM for \"Marie Antoinette\" (1938). Darryl F. Zanuck was angry that MGM used Fox's biggest star in what was, despite billing, a supporting role, and he vowed to never again loan him out, though Power's services were requested for the role of Ashley Wilkes in \"Gone with the Wind\"; Joe Bonaparte in \"Golden Boy\"; Paris in \"King's Row\"; roles in several films produced by Harry Cohn; and to play Irving Thalberg in a planned production by Norma Shearer of \"The Last Tycoon\".\n\nPower was named the second biggest box office draw in 1939, surpassed only by Mickey Rooney.\n\nIn 1940 the direction of Power's career took a dramatic turn when his movie \"The Mark of Zorro\" was released. Power played the role of Don Diego Vega/Zorro, fop by day, bandit hero by night. The role had been made famous by Douglas Fairbanks in the 1920 movie of the same title. The film was a hit, and 20th Century Fox often cast Power in other swashbucklers in the years that followed. Power was a talented swordsman in real life, and the dueling scene in \"The Mark of Zorro\" is highly regarded. The great Hollywood swordsman, Basil Rathbone, who starred with him in \"The Mark of Zorro\", commented, \"Power was the most agile man with a sword I’ve ever faced before a camera. Tyrone could have fenced Errol Flynn into a cocked hat.\"\n\nPower's career was interrupted in 1943 by military service. He reported to the United States Marine Corps for training in late 1942, but was sent back, at the request of 20th Century-Fox, to complete one more film, \"Crash Dive\", a patriotic war movie released in 1943. He was credited in the movie as Tyrone Power, U.S.M.C.R., and the movie served as a recruiting film.\n\nIn August 1942, Power enlisted in the United States Marine Corps. He attended boot camp at Marine Corps Recruit Depot San Diego, then Officer's Candidate School at Marine Corps Base Quantico, where he was commissioned a Second Lieutenant on June 2, 1943. As he had already logged 180 solo hours as a pilot before enlisting, he was able to do a short, intense flight training program at Naval Air Station Corpus Christi, Texas. The pass earned him his wings and a promotion to First Lieutenant. The Marine Corps considered Power over the age limit for active combat flying so he volunteered for piloting cargo planes that he felt would get him into active combat zones.\n\nIn July 1944, Power was assigned to Marine Transport Squadron (VMR)-352 as a R5C (Navy version of Army Curtiss Commando C-46) transport co-pilot at Marine Corps Air Station Cherry Point, North Carolina. The squadron moved to Marine Corps Air Station El Centro in California in December 1944. Power was later reassigned to VMR-353, joining them on Kwajalein Atoll in the Marshall Islands in February 1945. From there, he flew missions carrying cargo in and wounded Marines out during the Battles of Iwo Jima (Feb-Mar 1945) and Okinawa (Apr-Jun 1945).\n\nFor his services in the Pacific War, Power was awarded the American Campaign Medal, the Asiatic-Pacific Campaign Medal with two bronze stars, and the World War II Victory Medal.\n\nPower returned to the United States in November 1945 and was released from active duty in January 1946. He was promoted to the rank of Captain in the reserves on May 8, 1951. He remained in the reserves the rest of his life and reached the rank of major in 1957.\n\nIn the June 2001 \"Marine Air Transporter\" newsletter, Jerry Taylor, a retired Marine Corps flight instructor, recalled training Power as a Marine pilot, saying, \"He was an excellent student, never forgot a procedure I showed him or anything I told him.\" Others who served with him have also commented on how well Power was respected by those with whom he served. When Power died suddenly at age 44, he was buried with full military honors.\n\nOther than re-releases of his films, Power was not seen on screen again after his entry into the Marines until 1946, when he co-starred with Gene Tierney and Anne Baxter in \"The Razor's Edge\", an adaptation of W. Somerset Maugham's novel of the same title.\n\nNext up for release was a movie that Power had to fight hard to make, the film noir \"Nightmare Alley\" (1947). Darryl F. Zanuck was reluctant for Power to make the movie because his handsome appearance and charming manner had been marketable assets for the studio for years. Zanuck feared that the dark role might damage Power's image. Zanuck eventually agreed, giving Power A-list production values for what normally would be a B film. The movie was directed by Edmund Goulding, and though it died at the box office, it was one of Power's favorite roles for which he received some of the best reviews of his career. However, Zanuck was horrified that his \"darling boy\" would be seen in such a film with a downward spiral. So, he did not publicize it and removed it from release after only a few weeks insisting that it was a flop. The film was released on DVD in 2005 after years of legal battles.\n\nZanuck quickly released another costume-clad movie, \"Captain from Castile\" (also 1947), directed by Henry King, who directed Power in eleven movies. After making a couple of light romantic comedies reuniting him with two actresses under contract to 20th Century Fox, \"That Wonderful Urge\" with Gene Tierney and \"The Luck of the Irish\" (both 1948) with Anne Baxter. After these films, Power once again found himself in two swashbucklers, \"Prince of Foxes\" (1949) and \"The Black Rose\" (1950).\n\nPower was becoming increasingly dissatisfied with his costume roles, and he struggled between being a star and becoming a great actor. He was forced to take on assignments that did not appeal to him, such movies as \"American Guerrilla in the Philippines\" (1950) and \"Pony Soldier\" (1952). In 1950 he traveled to England to play the title role in \"Mister Roberts\" on stage at the London Coliseum, bringing in sellout crowds for twenty-three weeks. Another disappointing role for Power, \"Diplomatic Courier\" (1952) is a cold war drama, directed by Henry Hathaway, but received very modest reviews. It took its place among several other American spy movies, released previously, with similar material.\n\nPower's movies had been very profitable for Fox in the past, and as an enticement to renew his contract a third time, Fox offered him the lead role in \"The Robe\" (1953). He turned it down (Richard Burton was cast instead) and on 1 November 1952, he left on a ten-week national tour with \"John Brown's Body\", a three-person dramatic reading of Stephen Vincent Benét's narrative poem, adapted and directed by Charles Laughton, featuring Power, Judith Anderson and Raymond Massey. The tour culminated in a run of 65 shows between February and April 1953 at the New Century Theatre on Broadway. A second national tour with the show began in October 1953, this time for four months, and with Raymond Massey and Anne Baxter. In the same year, Power filmed \"King of The Khyber Rifles\", a depiction of India in 1857, with Terry Moore and Michael Rennie.\n\nFox now gave Power permission to seek his own roles outside the studio, on the understanding that he would fulfill his fourteen-film commitment to them in between his other projects. He made \"The Mississippi Gambler\" (1953) for Universal-International, negotiating a deal entitling him to a percentage of the profits. He earned a million dollars from the movie. Also in 1953, actress and producer Katharine Cornell cast Power as her love interest in the play \"The Dark is Light Enough\", a verse drama by British dramatist Christopher Fry set in Austria in 1848. Between November 1954 and April 1955, Power toured the United States and Canada in the role, ending with 12 weeks at the ANTA Theater, New York, and two weeks at the Colonial Theater, Boston. His performance in Julian Claman's \"A Quiet Place\", staged at the National Theater, Washington, at the end of 1955 was warmly received by the critics.\n\n\"Untamed\" (1955) was Tyrone Power's last movie made under his contract with 20th Century-Fox. The same year saw the release of \"The Long Gray Line\", a successful John Ford film for Columbia Pictures. In 1956, the year Columbia released \"The Eddy Duchin Story\", another great success for the star, he returned to England to play the rake Dick Dudgeon in a revival of Shaw's \"The Devil's Disciple\" for one week at the Opera House in Manchester, and nineteen weeks at the Winter Garden, London.\n\nPower's old boss, Darryl F. Zanuck, persuaded him to play the lead role in \"The Sun Also Rises\" (1957), adapted from the Hemingway novel, with Ava Gardner and Errol Flynn. This was his final film with Fox. Released that same year were \"Seven Waves Away\" (US: \"Abandon Ship\"), shot in Great Britain, and John Ford's \"Rising of the Moon\" (narrator only), which was filmed in Ireland, both for Copa Productions.\n\nFor Power's last completed film role he was cast against type as the accused murderer Leonard Vole in the first film version of Agatha Christie's \"Witness for the Prosecution\" (1957), directed by Billy Wilder. The critic for \"The National Post\", Robert Fulford, commented on Power's \"superb performance\" as \"the seedy, stop-at-nothing exploiter of women.\" The movie was a well-received box office success. Power returned to the stage in March, 1958 to play the lead in Arnold Moss's adaptation of Shaw's 1921 play, \"Back to Methuselah\".\n\nPower was one of Hollywood's most eligible bachelors until he married French actress Annabella (born Suzanne Georgette Charpentier on July 14, 1907). They had met on the 20th Century Fox lot around the time they starred together in the movie \"Suez\". Power adopted Annabella's daughter, Anne, before leaving for service. In an A&E biography, Annabella said that Zanuck \"could not stop Tyrone's love for me, or my love for Tyrone.\" J. Watson Webb, close friend and an editor at 20th Century Fox, maintained in the \"A&E Biography\" that one of the reasons the marriage fell apart was Annabella's inability to give Power a son, yet, Webb said, there was no bitterness between the couple. In a March 1947 issue of \"Photoplay\", Power was interviewed and said that he wanted a home and children, especially a son to carry on his acting legacy. Annabella shed some light on the situation in an interview published in \"Movieland\" magazine in 1948. She said, \"Our troubles began because the war started earlier for me, a French-born woman, than it did for Americans.\" She explained that the war clouds over Europe made her unhappy and irritable, and to get her mind off her troubles, she began accepting stage work, which often took her away from home. \"It is always difficult to put one's finger exactly on the place and time where a marriage starts to break up,\" she said \"but I think it began then. We were terribly sad about it, both of us, but we knew we were drifting apart. I didn’t think then—and I don’t think now—that it was his fault, or mine.\" The couple tried to make their marriage work when Power returned from military service, but they were unable to do so.\n\nFollowing his separation from Annabella, Power entered into a love affair with Lana Turner that lasted for a couple of years. In her 1982 autobiography, Turner claimed that she became pregnant with Power's child in 1948, but chose to have an abortion.\n\nOn September 1, 1947, Power set out on a goodwill trip around the world, piloting his own plane, \"The Geek.\" He flew with Bob Buck, an experienced pilot and war veteran. Buck stated in his autobiography that Power had a photographic mind, was an excellent pilot, and genuinely liked people. They flew with a crew to various locations in Europe and South Africa, often mobbed by fans when they hit the ground. However, in 1948 when \"The Geek\" reached Rome, Power met and fell in love with Mexican actress Linda Christian. Turner claimed that the story of her dining out with Power's friend Frank Sinatra was leaked to Power and that Power became very upset that she was \"dating\" another man in his absence. Turner also claimed that it could not have been a coincidence that Linda Christian was at the same hotel as Tyrone Power and implied that Christian had obtained Power's itinerary from 20th Century Fox.\n\nPower and Christian were married on January 27, 1949, in the Church of Santa Francesca Romana, with an estimated 8,000 to 10,000 screaming fans outside. Christian miscarried three times before giving birth to a baby girl, Romina Francesca Power, on October 2, 1951. A second daughter, Taryn Stephanie Power, was born on September 13, 1953. Around the time of Taryn's birth, the marriage was becoming rocky. In her autobiography, Christian blamed the breakup of her marriage on her husband's extramarital affairs, but acknowledged that she had had an affair with Edmund Purdom, which created great tension between Christian and her husband. They divorced in 1955.\n\nAfter his divorce from Christian, Power had a long-lasting love affair with Mai Zetterling, whom he had met on the set of \"Abandon Ship\". At the time, he vowed that he would never marry again, because he had been twice burned financially by his previous marriages. He also entered into an affair with a British actress, Thelma Ruby. However, in 1957, he met Deborah Ann Minardos. They were married on May 7, 1958, and she became pregnant soon after with the son he had always wanted.\n\nIn September 1958, Power and his wife Deborah went to Madrid and Valdespartera, Spain, to film the epic \"Solomon and Sheba,\" to be directed by King Vidor, co-starring Gina Lollobrigida. Power had filmed about 75 percent of his scenes when he was stricken by a massive heart attack while filming a dueling scene with his frequent co-star and friend, George Sanders. A doctor, Juan Olaguíbel, diagnosed Power's death as \"fulminant angina pectoris.\" He died while being transported to the hospital in Madrid on November 15, 1958, aged 44.\n\nPower was interred at Hollywood Forever Cemetery (then known as Hollywood Cemetery) in a military service at noon on November 21, 1958. Flying over the service was Henry King. Almost 20 years before, Tyrone had flown in King's plane to the set of \"Jesse James\" in Missouri. It was then that Power had his first experience of flying, which became a big part of his life, both in the U.S. Marines and as a civilian. In the foreword to Dennis Belafonte's \"The Films of Tyrone Power,\" King said, \"Knowing his love for flying and feeling that I had started it, I flew over his funeral procession and memorial park during his burial, and felt that he was with me.\" Power was laid to rest beside a small lake in one of the most beautiful parts of the cemetery. His grave is marked by a unique tombstone, in the form of a marble bench. On the tombstone are the masks of comedy and tragedy, with the inscription, \"Good night, sweet prince.\" At his grave, Laurence Olivier read the poem \"High Flight.\"\n\nPower's will, filed on December 8, 1958, contained a then-unusual provision. It stated his wish that, upon his death, his eyes be donated to the Estelle Doheny Eye Foundation, for such purposes as the trustees of the foundation should deem advisable, including transplantation of the cornea to the eyes of a living person or for retinal study.\n\nDeborah Power gave birth to their son, Tyrone Power IV, on January 22, 1959, some two months after Power's death.\n\nTyrone Power is one of the top 100 box-office moneymakers of all time (adjusted for inflation).\n\nFor Power's contribution to motion pictures, in 1960, he was honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, that can be found at 6747 Hollywood Blvd. On the 50th anniversary of his death, Power was honored by American Cinematheque with a weekend of films and remembrances by co-stars and family, and a memorabilia display. The event was held at the Egyptian Theatre in Los Angeles from November 14–16, 2008. A large etched glass mural depicting Tyrone epic moments was also displayed. Look magazine Dec 2,1952 featured the art works with a four-page spread titled\" Power's Pose for their Portrates.\n\nPower is shown on the cover of The Beatles' album \"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\" in the third row.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "5326278", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5326278", "title": "Unidentified body on Christmas Island", "text": "Unidentified body on Christmas Island\n\nThe unidentified body on Christmas Island was actually found on a life raft in the Indian Ocean, off that island, in 1942. He is widely believed to originate from the Royal Australian Navy (RAN) cruiser HMAS \"Sydney\", which sank off Western Australia in November 1941, after a mutually destructive battle with the German auxiliary cruiser \"Kormoran\". While 318 of 399 \"Kormoran\" personnel survived, \"Sydney\" was lost with no survivors from the 645 aboard. The locations of the shipwrecks were unknown until they were rediscovered in March 2008.\n\nThe body was found on 6 February 1942. It is reported that an inquest was held on Christmas Island, soon afterwards. His remains were buried with military honours, in an unmarked grave, in the Old European Cemetery on the island. Christmas Island was captured by Japanese forces on 31 March 1942 and remained in their hands until 1945. Relevant records, including any relating to the inquest, appear to have been lost or destroyed during this period.\n\nEyewitnesses on Christmas Island believed that the float and sailor had come from \"Sydney\". A post-war investigation by the RAN, including attempts to reconstruct the lost records by those who wrote them, determined that the body could possibly be a naval rating. Christmas Island's assistant harbour master, Captain E. Craig, stated that \"the Carley float was typical of those in service with the RN and RAN\". A government inquiry concluded \"on the balance of probability, that the body and the carley float ... were most likely from HMAS \"Sydney\".\"\n\nA RAN archaeological expedition in September–October 2006 recovered the body. Although a DNA profile and other data about the man's background have been recovered from the remains, researchers have not been able to match this to known relatives of personnel from \"Sydney\".\n\nDuring the late afternoon of 6 February 1942, lookouts on Christmas Island spotted an object out at sea. Initially thought to be a Japanese submarine, closer inspection from a pilot boat found it was a carley float with a dead person inside. The float was towed ashore.\n\nWith the island under threat of invasion, after brief examinations by the harbour master, the medical officer, and the man in charge of the radio station, the body was buried in an unmarked grave near Flying Fish Cove. Reports were written by these men; they were destroyed when Japanese forces occupied Christmas Island and later recreated from memory. An inquest was not convened until mid-February and was ongoing when evacuation began on 17 February with Japanese forces occupying the island on 23 March. It is unknown if the doctor on Christmas Island had performed an autopsy; if so it was never found.\n\nA preliminary examination in 1942 by the island's medical officer, Dr J. Scott Clark, found that the deceased was reported to have been a young adult male caucasoid who was tall by the standards of his time.\n\nThe remains were partly decomposed: its eyes, nose and all of the flesh from the right arm were missing and believed to have been consumed by fish or birds. There are several accounts regarding clothing. According to the island's Harbour Master, Captain J. R. Smith, the body was clothed in a blue boilersuit which had been bleached white by exposure with four plain press studs from neck to waist. According to J.C. Baker, who was in charge of the radio station at Christmas Island, the body was clothed in a white boilersuit. The body was not carrying \"dog tags\" or personal effects.\n\nA shoe was found beside the body, which Clark did not believe belonged to the dead man. Later recollections of the shoe varied: Clark stated that it was \"probably branded \"\", although he had some doubts about \"\" and \"\". Captain Smith, recalled a canvas shoe of a brand named \"\" or \"\", which carried symbols representing a crown and/or a broad arrow. A sergeant with the party who recovered the raft later contradicted the finding of a single shoe stating that a 'pair of boots' were found on the raft.\n\nIn Smith's opinion, the life raft was a naval carley float, which had come from \"Sydney\". The wooden decking was manufactured and branded with the word \"\" while the metal framework was branded \"\" inside.</small> The float had been damaged by gun or shellfire, with shrapnel embedded in the outer covering, and the underside was covered with barnacles and other marine growth, indicating that it had been at sea for some time.\n\nOn 23 April 1949, the Director of Naval Intelligence wrote to the Director of Victualling in regard to whether the clothing (3a) and carley float (3b) could have come from the \"Sydney\". The Director of Naval Victualling replied to 3a in a hand written note that while a rating may have worn a blue boilersuit, suits with press studs \"had never been adopted\" by the navy. However, RAN officers purchased their own boilersuits which would be either white or brown in colour with press studs. Additionally, the shoes described \"definitely\" corresponded with RAN issue \"provided they were leather not canvass.\" There is no record of a reply regarding the carley float.\n\nThe RAN claimed that the covering of the carley float did not match those used by Australian warships and thus could not have come from \"Sydney\". Historian Tom Frame was also sceptical regarding the raft's origins and stated that its connections to the \"Sydney\" were circumstantial.\n\nFor many years, other authors, like historian Barbara Winter (1984) and independent researcher Wes Olson (2000) disputed the official view put forward by the RAN. According to Olson, it was unclear how the RAN decided that the float cover was anomalous, as contemporary accounts of the float were often vague and/or contradicted each other. In addition, said Olson, the only available detail of the covering in eyewitness descriptions appeared to be that it was grey. Winter suggested that the currents of the Indian Ocean would have propelled a carley float, launched at the location and time of the battle, to the vicinity of Christmas Island, at around the time of its discovery. According to Olson, the rope used on the float and markings on the float were of naval origin, and the descriptions of marine growth on the float matched the period that a float from \"Sydney\" would have been in the water. In 2000, Olson claimed that evidence presented at the 1998 inquiry had changed Frame's mind.\n\nThe 1998 Joint Standing Committee for Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade inquiry into the loss of HMAS \"Sydney\" recommended that attempts be made to find the grave, to exhume the body and acquire DNA for comparison with relatives of personnel from \"Sydney\", to determine if the unknown sailor was from the cruiser.\n\nThe RAN performed an unsuccessful search of the graveyard in August–September 2001 and a second, successful search in October 2006. When it was found, the body was in an unusually-shaped coffin, which appeared to have been constructed around it as the body was buried \"with legs doubled under at the knee,\" the same position it had been in when found on the raft, possibly due to mummification. In addition to human remains, press studs and small fragments of clothing were found in the coffin.\n\nFollowing an autopsy and the taking of samples from the body to assist in identification, the remains of the unknown sailor were reburied in the Commonwealth War Graves section in the Geraldton Cemetery with full military honours on 19 November 2008.\n\nBrain trauma caused by a shell fragment of German origin has been identified as the cause of death. Regarding the unknown man's injuries, Bruce Billson (then Minister Assisting the Minister for Defence) reported that:\n\nThe fragment, which was thought initially to be a small-arms bullet, was found embedded in the man's skull during autopsy work in 2006.\n\nAnatomical analysis indicated that the unknown sailor was aged between 22 and 31 when he died, was right-handed, had size 11 feet, and was tall for his generation — between .\n\nBone isotope analysis shows that he had lived in eastern Australia — most likely NSW or Queensland — before enlistment and most probably grew up in a coastal area. The unknown sailor had acquired an unusual feature in both ankle joints, known as squatting facets; these indicated that he was more used to squatting than sitting on chairs. As squatting was unusual at the time in urban, western communities, it was speculated that the man had spent significant time:\n\nAttempts to extract a DNA profile from the remains began in or before 2009, although the results were not published before the Cole Inquiry. Analysis of the partial genetic profile recovered has since suggested that the man had red hair, blue eyes and pale skin, suggesting that he was of European descent. He belonged to a mitochondrial haplogroup — an ancient female line of descent — known as haplogroup J1c12.\n\nThe boilersuit and shoe found with the body were, according to evidence provided by the Australian War Memorial, available to ship’s officers, commissioned warrant officers and warrant officers senior enough to have a watch keeping certificate. Tests on the remains of the boilersuit showed that the fabric had never been dyed, was probably white and the press studs were of a type manufactured by Carr Australia Pty Ltd in the 1930s and 1940s. RAN \"Dress Regulations\" published in the Navy List of December 1940 do not mention white boilersuits. There is evidence, however, that during the period, boilersuits were a popular working dress among RAN personnel. Many RAN engineer officers wore white boilersuits most of the time, and other officers, commissioned warrant officers and warrant officers also wore white boilersuits. Two former RAN officers recalled being issued with a white boilersuit twice a year, that these were fastened with four or five press studs and that some had press studs at the wrist, while others did not. Dress regulations for December 1940 state that RAN personnel on \"foreign\" (tropical) stations were issued with a pair of white canvas shoes, to be worn only on those stations. While veterans did not recall being issued with them or seeing them worn, photographs of RAN personnel from the period show some of them wearing white canvas shoes.\n\nBy 2014, the identity of the unknown sailor had been narrowed to 50 members of the crew of HMAS \"Sydney\".\n\n"}

Such an event may be forceful enough to launch an extreme amount of material from the crust and mantle into a sub-orbital trajectory.\n\nVerneshots have been proposed as a causal mechanism explaining the statistically unlikely contemporaneous occurrence of continental flood basalts, mass extinctions, and \"impact signals\" (such as planar deformation features, shocked quartz, and iridium anomalies) traditionally considered definitive evidence of hypervelocity impact events.\n\nThe verneshot theory suggests that mantle plumes may cause heating and the buildup of carbon dioxide gas underneath continental lithosphere. If continental rifting occurs above this location, an explosive release of the built up gas may occur, potentially sending out a column of crust and mantle into a globally dispersive, super-stratospheric trajectory. It is unclear whether such a column could stay coherent through this process, or whether the force of this process would result in it shattering into much smaller pieces before impacting. The pipe through which the magma and gas had travelled would collapse during this process, sending a shockwave at hypersonic velocity that would deform the surrounding craton.\n\nA verneshot event is likely to be related to nearby continental flood basalt events, which may occur before, during or after the verneshot event. This may help in searching for evidence for the results of verneshot events; however, it is also quite probable that most of such evidence will be buried underneath the basalt flows, making investigation difficult. J. Phipps Morgan and others have suggested that subcircular Bouguer gravity anomalies recognized beneath the Deccan Traps may indicate the presence of verneshot pipes related to the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event.\n\nIf the Deccan Traps were the location of a verneshot event at the Cretaceous–Paleogene boundary, the strong iridium spike at the Cretaceous–Paleogene boundary could be explained by the iridium-rich nature of volatiles in the Reunion mantle plume, which is currently beneath Piton de la Fournaise, but during the end Cretaceous was located beneath India in the area of the Deccan Traps; the verneshot event could potentially distribute the iridium globally.\n\nIn 1865 Jules Verne's novel \"From the Earth to the Moon\" introduced the concept of a ballistic projectile escaping the Earth's gravity, from which Phipps Morgan and others derived the name \"Verneshot\" in their paper theorizing a connection between extinction events and cratonic gas ejection.\n"}
