He is a composer and MC in the group Hocus Pocus, member of beatmaker collective of DJs C2C, one half of the Hip Hop/Electronic duo AllttA and quadruple world champion DMC Team. He published his first EP, \"Motifs\", in 2014, followed by \"Motifs II\" in 2015.\n\nDuring his career, he also produced for artists and groups such as Diam's, Disiz, Kohndo, Slum Village, Fabe, Scred Connexion, Nakk, Sully Sefil, and is involved in projects such as \"Just Us vol.1\" or \"Original Bombattak\".\n\n20syl, originally a graphic designer, graduated from the Graduate School of Fine Arts in Nantes Métropole. He began his musical career in his bedroom at his parents' house in Rezé.\n\nIn 1995, 20Syl and Cambia released their first mixtape, \"Première Formule.\" Recorded in a makeshift studio, the first self-produced cassette was sold in the courtyard of their school. In 1997, they associated with DJ Greem, a high school friend of 20Syl, to form the group Hocus Pocus, and released their first album as a trio, \"Seconde Formule\", in 1998. Hocus Pocus mixes elements specific to hip-hop (scratches, samples, rap) to an instrumental sound influenced by jazz, soul and funk. Alongside Hocus Pocus, they created in collaboration with DJ Atom and DJ Pfel, a group called C2C (Coups2Cross). C2C was the world champion DMC team four years in a row from 2003 to 2006. They found the collaboration of two MCs and a DJ did not work on stage and went their separate ways; 20Syl continued his productions and DJ Greem invested specifically in C2C.\n\nIn 2001, 20syl worked again with DJ Greem and Cambia on stage as Hocus Pocus. The same year, they created the label \"On & On\" and released the maxi \"Sick\", which sold around 4000 copies. Three years later, they released the album \"73 Touches\" (in reference to the number of piano keys). Largely influenced by jazz, they refer to Miles Davis and Billie Holiday. Mathieu Lelièvre on keyboard, Hervé Godard on bass and David Le Deunff on guitar complement the trio. The same album was reissued in 2006 with a new version of \"Sick\" and six new titles.\n\nThe album \"Place 54\", released in October 2007, increased their willingness to create acoustic hip-hop. For this album, they signed with the label Motown France to promote and distribute it. The album was well received and attracted interest from mainstream TV and radio. In 2008, Hocus Pocus was nominated for a Grammy in the category \"Best Urban Contemporary Album\".\n\n20syl published his first solo EP, \"Motifs,\" on the 9 June 2014; the site sourdoreille.net considers this EP as \"a real gem\" whilst wordplaymagazine.com praises 20syl's style as \"frankly remarkable\". His second EP, \"Motifs II\", was published on 11 May 2015. Regarding the cover of \"Motifs II\" 20syl explains: \"For the first volume, I played on the contrast between the zebra and the checkerboard. For this one, I wanted another animal. I like animals with a solemn air, which release an aesthetic force. When I came across this owl, I found him mysterious and chic. I also chose the motif of the opposition in the checkered plumage. It is a way to symbolize the two aspects of my music: electronic and organic. This refined and enigmatic image raises questions.\"\n\nIn July 2015 in Nantes, 20syl presented the U, an interactive musical skateboard ramp (in collaboration with the collective Herrmutt Lobby). herrmuttlobby.com says regarding U \"The skater is the musician and the ramp is the instrument. He composes and decomposes the rhythm, he breaks down initial binary arrangements, making the digital human again for a moment.\" In September 2015 The Apple Keynote used a piece of 20syl to promote the functionality of Siri on the Apple Watch in their \"Choose Colorfully\" advertisement. In late 2015, 20syl published a remix of the Pulpalicious song \"How I Feel\". In January 2016, he published his first year production entitled \"Inertia\". Also in January 2016, he published a remix of the song \"Walk Walk\" by Yael Naim.\n\nIn 2015 he formed the group AllttA (A Little Lower Than The Angels) with the Californian rapper Mr. J. Medeiros. Their debut album, titled \"The Upper Hand\", was released on February 17, 2017.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

It is naturally produced by the body, although it is often taken as a dietary supplement. Acetylcarnitine is broken down in the blood by plasma esterases to carnitine which is used by the body to transport fatty acids into the mitochondria for breakdown.\n\nCarnitine is both a nutrient and made by the body as needed; it serves as a substrate for important reactions in which it accepts and gives up an acyl group. Acetylcarnitine is the most abundant naturally occurring derivative and is formed in the reaction:\n\nwhere the acetyl group displaces the hydrogen atom in the central hydroxyl group of carnitine. Coenzyme A (CoA) plays a key role in the Krebs cycle in mitochondria, which is essential for the production of ATP, which powers many reactions in cells; acetyl-CoA is the primary substrate for the Krebs cycle, once it is de-acetylated, it must be re-charged with an acetyl-group in order for the Krebs cycle to keep working.\n\nMost cell types appear to have transporters to import carnitine and export acyl-carnitines, which seems to be a mechanism to dispose of longer-chain moieties; however many cell types can also import ALCAR.\n\nWithin cells, carnitine plays a key roles in importing acyl-CoA into mitochondria; the acyl-group of the acyl-CoA is transferred to carnitine, and the acyl-carnitine is imported through both mitochondrial membranes before being transferred to a CoA molecule, which is then beta oxidized to acetyl-CoA. A separate set of enzymes and transporters also plays a buffering role by eliminating acetyl-CoA from inside mitochondria created by the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex that is in excess of its utilization by the Krebs cycle; carnitine accepts the acetyl moiety and becomes ALCAR, which is then transported out of the mitochondria and into the cytosol, leaving free CoA inside the mitochondria ready to accept new import of fatty acid chains. ALCAR in the cytosol can also form a pool of acetyl-groups for CoA, should the cell need it.\n\nExcess acetyl-CoA causes more carbohydrates to be used for energy at the expense of fatty acids. This occurs by different mechanisms inside and outside the mitochondria. ALCAR transport decreases acetyl-CoA inside the mitochondria, but increases it outside.\n\nCarnitine and ALCAR supplements carry warnings of a risk that they promote seizures in people with epilepsy, but a 2016 review found no basis for this warning in the literature.\n\n\n\n"}

He is thought to have been first a canon regular, later a Benedictine of Marmoutier Abbey, Tours, and then a Cistercian. In 1188, he became abbot of Perseigne Abbey, to which his reputation for holiness and wisdom drew the great personages of his time to seek his advice. He was for a time the confessor to King Richard Lionheart of England. He had at Rome a conference with the celebrated mystic, Joachim, Abbot of Flora, (in Calabria, Italy), on the subject of the latter's revelations, and aided Foulques de Neuilly in preaching during the Fourth Crusade. He died in 1221.\n\nHis sermons were published at Rome in 1662, under the title \"Adami Abbatis Perseniæ Ordinis Cisterciensis Mariale\". About half his known letters remained in circulation after the invention of the printing press in various collected formats. These collections were subsequently incorporated into the Patrologia Latina in volume CCXI.\n\nMany of his letters were addressed to members of the House of Champagne (e.g. the countesses of Chartres and of Châlons) and to the bishops and leading ecclesiastics of the dioceses of Le Mans, Chartres and of Normandy (especially Rouen).

{"id": "12506942", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12506942", "title": "Aimery II of Narbonne", "text": "Aimery II of Narbonne\n\nAimery II (or Aimeric II) (died 17 July 1134) was the Viscount of Narbonne from around 1106 until his death. \n\nHe was the eldest son of Aimery I of Narbonne and Mahalt (also Mahault or Mafalda), daughter of Robert Guiscard and Sichelgaita and widow of Raymond Berengar II of Barcelona. This made him a half-brother of Raymond Berengar III. He initially ruled as a minor under the regency of his mother. After he came of age he married Ermengard. \n\nProbably in 1112 or 1113, Aimery received the Fenouillèdes and the Peyrepertusès from his half-brother in return for swearing an oath of fealty against Bernard Ato IV of Béziers, with whom Raymond Berengar was at war. The lords of the Fenouillèdes and the Peyrepertuseès remained vassals of Narbonne until the Albigensian Crusade and the viscounts of Narbonne took the lordship of Rouffiac near Peyrepertuse into their own hands. When Douce I, Countess of Provence died and Raymond Berengar claimed the County of Provence, Aimery received the fief of Beaucaire and the \"terre d'Argence\" near the mouth of the Rhône in Provence. \n\nSometime during his rule, Aimery granted the merchants of Narbonne the right to form a consulate in imitation of Genoa. Probably he saw the self-organisation of his merchants and their formation of a military in their own defence as an aid to his own rule so long as the consulate remained under vicecomital control, which in the end it did not. Aimery also participated in 1114–15 in the Balearic Islands expedition led by the Republic of Pisa and Raymond Berengar. \n\nIn 1114, Aimery put an end to conflicting claims in the village of Le Lac on the Via Domitia by transferring his rights there to the abbey of Lagrasse in return for a large loan of gold and silver. He also entered into a conflict with his cousin Richard de Millau, Archbishop of Narbonne, who may have been a compromise candidate between Aimery and the pope for the archiepiscopal throne. Richard claimed that Aimery \"fecit mihi hominium propriis manibus\" (\"did homage to [him] with his own hands\") received \"fedovia\" (\"fiefs\") from the Church \"in the presence of the universal synod of the province of Narbonne.\" The archbishop accused Aimery of deceiving him concerning the extent of the Church's fiefs and attempting to hold land as his by inheritance which was his by grant of the Church; he also accused Aimery of withholding revenues from taxes and imposts that should have gone to the Church. Aimery was recorded to have even abused church property violently and there were disputes concerning who controlled the towers on the city walls. The whole dispute lasted a long time, but Aimery was made to come to terms by the Papacy's support of Richard. In the end, he had to swear oaths of fealty to the archbishop, recognise the archbishop's independent temporal lordship, and concede that some of the rights he held in the city of Narbonne constituted a fief of the archbishopric. \n\nIn 1124, Bernard Ato of Béziers declared war on Aimery, who responded by razing the castle (\"pro justicia\", \"out of justice\") at Montséret, which had been held by Aimery's vassal Bernard Amati until he had treacherously turned it over to Bernard Ato. Not long after this Aimery turned towards Iberia and joined the Reconquista being waged by Alfonso the Battler in the Ebro valley. \n\nIn July 1131, Aimery was at the deathbed of his half-brother to witness his final testament, of which he was to be the executor. Aimery died in battle before the walls of the Moorish city of Fraga, which Alfonso had been besieging. Aimery had a son and a daughter by Ermengard; the son, Aimery, predeceased him (ca. 1130), and he was succeeded by his daughter Ermengard, who was only four or five at the time. He married a second time to a woman named Ermessende and left by her a daughter of the same name. This second daughter, Ermessende, married before 1153 a great Castilian magnate, Manrique Pérez de Lara, lord of Molina.\n\n"}

He eventually held the post of Domestic of the Schools during the last years of the reign of Basil I the Macedonian and in the early reign of Leo VI the Wise, until his death. He played a major role in the domestic affairs of Leo's early reign, especially in the dismissal and trial of Patriarch Photios.\n\nAccording to the chronicler Genesios and the continuators of Georgios Monachos, Andrew descended from the \"western Scythians\", whence the sobriquet \"the Scythian\" given to him by modern scholars. In reality, \"Scythians\" was an archaizing Byzantine term for the Slavs.\n\nAndrew may be identifiable as the man of the same name who commanded the imperial bodyguard, the \"Hetaireia\", when the young Basil the Macedonian ()) served there during his swift rise from a simple stable groom to high office in the late 850s and early 860s as a protégé of Emperor Michael III (). When Basil came to power after assassinating Michael, Andrew too rose to higher office. In the 870s, as \"hypostrategos\" (deputy commander) of the Opsician Theme, he distinguished himself in the constant war of raids and counter-raids with the Muslim border emirates of Malatya and Tarsus, on the eastern fringes of Asia Minor. For his service, he was eventually rewarded with the titles of \"patrikios\" and the post of Domestic of the Schools (commander-in-chief). \n\nTheophanes Continuatus reports that he was dismissed due to accusations of timidity, after failing to follow up on a decisive victory against the emir of Tarsus, Abdallah ibn Rashid ibn Kawus, which the Byzantine sources place in the year 878. Genesios and the continuators of Georgios Monachos on the other hand don't mention a dismissal, but simply record that on account of his victories, he was raised further to the rank of \"magistros\". Andrew is also mentioned as leading, along with Christopher, the sacking of Tephrike, the Paulician capital, an event dated by modern scholars to 878. This is considered erroneous by modern scholars, since the final campaign against Tephrike was in all likelihood led by Emperor Basil in person. On the other hand, the chronicle of Symeon Logothetes gives an entirely different background to his dismissal, placing it in 883 and the fall-out between Basil and his son, the future Leo VI (). According to Symeon, Theodore Santabarenos accused Andrew of being privy to a plot of the circle around Leo to depose his father. Along with other high-ranking officials connected to the heir-apparent, Andrew lost his post, even though he was on campaign at the time. Whatever the true course of events, his disgrace did not last long, as his successor, Kesta Styppiotes, was decisively beaten by the Arabs, and Andrew soon regained his post, which he held to the end of his life.\n\nWhen Leo succeeded his father, Andrew quickly emerged as the new emperor's right-hand man. Thus it was Andrew who headed the delegation of senior officials and senators sent by Leo immediately after his accession on 29 August 886 to Chrysopolis in order to retrieve and bring back to the capital for reburial in the Church of the Holy Apostles the corpse of Michael III, whom Leo believed to have been his real father. Andrew was also instrumental in the downfall of the Patriarch Photios, who along with his protégé Theodore Santabarenos was accused by Andrew and the \"magistros\" Stephen of plotting to overthrow Leo. As the emperor's trusted agent, it was Andrew who, along with the Logothete of the Course, John Hagiopolites, went to the Hagia Sophia, read the charges brought against Photios from the pulpit, and arrested the patriarch. Photios' trial for treason took place in 887, before a tribunal of senior officials presided over by Andrew. Photios and Theodore were found guilty, with the former banished to the monastery of Gordon, where he died, while Theodore was exiled to Athens.\n\nThe trial of Photios is the last mention of Andrew in the sources. He must have died sometime between then and 894, when Nikephoros Phokas the Elder is recorded as having succeeded him as Domestic of the Schools.\n\n"}

Biodemographic studies are important for understanding the driving forces of the current longevity revolution (dramatic increase in human life expectancy), forecasting the future of human longevity, and identification of new strategies for further increase in healthy and productive life span.\n\nBiodemographic studies found a remarkable similarity in survival dynamics between humans and laboratory animals. Specifically, three general biodemographic laws of survival are found:\n\n\nThe Gompertz–Makeham law states that death rate is a sum of age-independent component (Makeham term) and age-dependent component (Gompertz function), which increases exponentially with age.\n\nThe compensation law of mortality (late-life mortality convergence) states that the relative differences in death rates between different populations of the same biological species are decreasing with age, because the higher initial death rates are compensated by lower pace of their increase with age.\n\nThe Late-life mortality deceleration law states that death rates stop increasing exponentially at advanced ages and level-off to the late-life mortality plateau. An immediate consequence from this observation is that there is no fixed upper limit to human longevity — there is no special fixed number, which separates possible and impossible values of lifespan. This challenges the common belief in existence of a fixed maximal human life span.\n\nBiodemographic studies found that even genetically identical laboratory animals kept in constant environment have very different lengths of life, suggesting a crucial role of chance and early-life developmental noise in longevity determination. This leads to new approaches in understanding causes of exceptional human longevity.\n\nAs for the future of human longevity, biodemographic studies found that evolution of human lifespan had two very distinct stages – the initial stage of mortality decline at younger ages is now replaced by a new trend of preferential improvement of the oldest-old survival. This phenomenon invalidates methods of longevity forecasting based on extrapolation of long-term historical trends.\n\nA general explanation of these biodemographic laws of aging and longevity has been suggested based on system reliability theory.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "3557327", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3557327", "title": "Canalisation (genetics)", "text": "Canalisation (genetics)\n\nCanalisation is a measure of the ability of a population to produce the same phenotype regardless of variability of its environment or genotype. It is a form of evolutionary robustness. The term was coined in 1942 by C. H. Waddington to capture the fact that \"developmental reactions, as they occur in organisms submitted to natural selection...are adjusted so as to bring about one definite end-result regardless of minor variations in conditions during the course of the reaction\". He used this word rather than robustness to take into account that biological systems are not robust in quite the same way as, for example, engineered systems.\n\nBiological robustness or canalisation comes about when developmental pathways are shaped by evolution. Waddington introduced the concept of the epigenetic landscape, in which the state of an organism rolls \"downhill\" during development. In this metaphor, a canalised trait is illustrated as a valley (which he called a creode) enclosed by high ridges, safely guiding the phenotype to its \"fate\". Waddington claimed that canals form in the epigenetic landscape during evolution, and that this heuristic is useful for understanding the unique qualities of biological robustness.\n\nWaddington used the concept of canalisation to explain his experiments on genetic assimilation. In these experiments, he exposed \"Drosophila\" pupae to heat shock. This environmental disturbance caused some flies to develop a crossveinless phenotype. He then selected for crossveinless. Eventually, the crossveinless phenotype appeared even without heat shock. Through this process of genetic assimilation, an environmentally induced phenotype had become inherited. Waddington explained this as the formation of a new canal in the epigenetic landscape.\n\nIt is, however, possible to explain genetic assimilation using only quantitative genetics and a threshold model, with no reference to the concept of canalisation. However, theoretical models that incorporate a complex genotype–phenotype map have found evidence for the evolution of phenotypic robustness contributing to genetic assimilation, even when selection is only for developmental stability and not for a particular phenotype, and so the quantitative genetics models do not apply. These studies suggest that the canalisation heuristic may still be useful, beyond the more simple concept of robustness.\n\nNeither canalisation nor robustness are simple quantities to quantify: it is always necessary to specify which trait is canalised (robust) to which perturbations. For example, perturbations can come either from the environment or from mutations. It has been suggested that different perturbations have congruent effects on development taking place on an epigenetic landscape. This could, however, depend on the molecular mechanism responsible for robustness, and be different in different cases.\n\nThe canalisation metaphor suggests that phenotypes are very robust to small perturbations, for which development does not exit the canal, and rapidly returns down, with little effect on the final outcome of development. But perturbations whose magnitude exceeds a certain threshold will break out of the canal, moving the developmental process into uncharted territory. Strong robustness up to a limit, with little robustness beyond, is a pattern that could increase evolvability in a fluctuating environment. Genetic canalisation could allow for evolutionary capacitance, where genetic diversity outside the canal accumulates in a population over time, sheltered from natural selection because it does not normally affect phenotypes. This hidden diversity could then be unleashed by extreme changes in the environment or by molecular switches, releasing previously cryptic genetic variation that can then contribute to a rapid burst of evolution.\n\n"}

The conference is currently a double-track meeting (single-track until 2015) that includes invited talks as well as oral and poster presentations of refereed papers, followed by parallel-track workshops that up to 2013 were held at ski resorts. \n\nThe NIPS meeting was first proposed in 1986 at the annual invitation-only Snowbird Meeting on Neural Networks for Computing organized by The California Institute of Technology and Bell Laboratories. NIPS was designed as a complementary open interdisciplinary meeting for researchers exploring biological and artificial Neural Networks. Reflecting this multidisciplinary approach, NIPS began in 1987 with information theorist Ed Posner as the conference president and learning theorist Yaser Abu-Mostafa and computational neurobiologist James Bower as co-program chairman. Research presented in the early NIPS meetings including a wide range of topics from efforts to solve purely engineering problems to the use of computer models as a tool for understanding biological nervous systems. Since then, the biological and artificial systems research streams have diverged, and recent NIPS proceedings have been dominated by papers on machine learning, artificial intelligence and statistics.\n\nFrom 1987 until 2000 NIPS was held in Denver, United States. Since then, the conference was held in Vancouver, Canada (2001–2010), Granada, Spain (2011), and Lake Tahoe, United States (2012–2013). In 2014 and 2015, the conference was held in Montreal, Canada, in Barcelona, Spain in 2016, and in Long Beach, United States in 2017. Reflecting its origins at Snowbird, Utah, the meeting was accompanied by workshops organized at a nearby ski resort up until 2013, when it outgrew ski resorts.\n\nThe NIPS Conference is organized by the NIPS Foundation, established by Ed Posner in 1987. Terrence Sejnowski has been the president of the NIPS Foundation since 1993, when Posner had a bicycle accident. The board of trustees consists of previous general chairs of the NIPS Conference.\n\nThe proceedings from the conferences have been published in book form by Morgan Kaufmann (1987–1993), MIT Press (1994–2004) and Curran Associates (2005–present) under the name \"Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems\".\n\nConference organizers considered abandoning the \"NIPS\" name because of a slang connotation with the word \"nipples\". After a comment period and survey of 2270 conference participants, conference organizers decided to keep the name. Of the survey respondents, 1,881 were men and 294 were women. Of the women, 44% agreed a name change should occur and 40% disagreed. Of the men, 28% agreed a name change should occur and 55% disagreed. However, on November 17th, 2018, the Neural Information Processing Systems Foundation Board of Trustees decided to change the official acronym of the conference from NIPS to NeurIPS.\n\nThe conference had 5,000 registered participants in 2016 and 8,000 in 2017, making it the largest conference in Artificial Intelligence. Besides machine learning and neuroscience, other fields represented at NIPS include cognitive science, psychology, computer vision, statistical linguistics, and information theory. Although the 'Neural' in the NIPS acronym had become something of a historical relic, the resurgence of deep learning in neural networks since 2012, fueled by faster computers and big data, has led to impressive achievement in speech recognition, object recognition in images, image captioning, language translation and world championship performance in the game of Go, based on neural architectures inspired by the hierarchy of areas in the visual cortex (ConvNet) and reinforcement learning inspired by the basal ganglia (Temporal difference learning).\nIn addition to invited talks and symposia, NIPS also organizes two named lectureships to recognize distinguished researchers. The NIPS Board introduced the Posner Lectureship in honor of NIPS founder Ed Posner; two Posner Lectures were given each year up to 2015. Past lecturers have included:\n\nIn 2015, the NIPS Board introduced the Breiman Lectureship to highlight work in statistics relevant to conference topics. The lectureship was named for statistician Leo Breiman, who served on the NIPS Board from 1994 to 2005. Past lecturers have included:\n\nIn NIPS 2014, the program chairs duplicated 10% of all submissions and sent them through separate reviewers to evaluate randomness in the reviewing process. Several researchers interpreted the result. Regarding whether the decision in NIPS is completely random or not, John Langford writes: \"Clearly not—a purely random decision would have arbitrariness of ~78%. It is, however, quite notable that 60% is much closer to 78% than 0%.\" He concludes that the result of the reviewing process is mostly arbitrary.\n\nPast editions:\nFuture editions:\n\n\n"}

He visited the local curandera Agustina Rodriguez, who in turn sent for the barber and healer Francisco Leona. Leona, who also had a criminal record, agreed to cure Ortega in exchange for 3000 reales.\n\nLeona and Julio \"El Tonto\" (\"The Fool\") Hernández, a son of Agustina the healer, offered to find a child. On the evening of June 27, 1910, Francisco Leona kidnapped Bernardo Gonzalez Parra, a seven year old from Rioja, drugged him with chloroform and put him in a sack.\n\nA brother of Julio \"Tonto\" Hernández, Joseph Hernández, was to advise the client Ortega, leaving his wife Elena to make dinner.\n\nLittle Bernardo's murder was as follows: after he was removed from the sack, dazed, Bernardo was stabbed in the heart by Leona, and Ortega mixed his blood with sugar and drank it. After that they took the boy to a place known as Las Pocicas where Leona killed him, crushing his skull with a rock. Then he extracted fat and mesentery to make a compress to apply to Ortega's chest.\n\nTo finish the ritual, Bernardo's body was concealed in a crevice, unburied but covered with herbs and stones, located in Las Pocicas.\n\nWhen distributing the actual 3000 Ortega paid him for his services, the healer Leona tried and failed to trick his accomplice \"Tonto\" Hernández. Realizing Leona's intentions, Hernández told the Civil Guard who had seen the body of a child while he was chasing partridges.\n\nWhen law enforcement officers arrived, the people of Gádor turned Leona over to them, as he was known for his illegal and occult practices. During court proceedings, Leona indicted \"el Tonto\" Hernández in his testimony, who in turn did the same to Leona. Finally, after multiple excuses, both confessed to the crime.\n\nMost of the perpetrators were executed by hanging. Leona was sentenced to death by garrote, but died in prison. The client, Ortega, and Agustina, the curandera, were both sentenced to death. Joseph Hernández, was sentenced to 17 years in prison while his wife, Elena, was acquitted. Julio \"el Tonto\" was sentenced to death too, but received a pardon on grounds of insanity following a psychiatric report.\n\nThis crime gave rise to the term Hombre del saco and Sacamantecas because the kidnapers used a gunny sack to carry the children. It was defined as \"medical crime\", inspired by the believes of the virtue of the therapy of the human blood and the child's \"manteca\".\n\nA TV episode named \"El sacamantecas\" was released in 1986.\n\n"}

If the system is not functioning correctly, the algorithm should be able to determine, as accurately as possible, which part of the system is failing, and which kind of fault it is facing. The computation is based on \"observations\", which provide information on the current behaviour.\n\nThe expression \"diagnosis\" also refers to the answer of the question of whether the system is malfunctioning or not, and to the process of computing the answer. This word comes from the medical context where a diagnosis is the process of identifying a disease by its symptoms.\n\nAn example of diagnosis is the process of a garage mechanic with an automobile. The mechanic will first try to detect any abnormal behavior based on the observations on the car and his knowledge of this type of vehicle. If he finds out that the behavior is abnormal, the mechanic will try to refine his diagnosis by using new observations and possibly testing the system, until he discovers the faulty component; the mechanic plays an important role in the vehicle diagnosis.\n\nThe expert diagnosis (or diagnosis by expert system) is based on experience with the system. Using this experience, a mapping is built that efficiently associates the observations to the corresponding diagnoses.\n\nThe experience can be provided:\n\nThe main drawbacks of these methods are:\n\nA slightly different approach is to build an expert system from a model of the system rather than directly from an expertise. An example is the computation of a diagnoser for the diagnosis of discrete event systems. This approach can be seen as model-based, but it benefits from some advantages and suffers some drawbacks of the expert system approach.\n\nModel-based diagnosis is an example of abductive reasoning using a model of the system. In general, it works as follows:\n\nWe have a model that describes the behaviour of the system (or artefact). The model is an abstraction of the behaviour of the system and can be incomplete. In particular, the faulty behaviour is generally little-known, and the faulty model may thus not be represented. Given observations of the system, the diagnosis system simulates the system using the model, and compares the observations actually made to the observations predicted by the simulation.\n\nThe modelling can be simplified by the following rules (where formula_1 is the \"Ab\"normal predicate):\n\nformula_2\n\nformula_3 (fault model)\n\nThe semantics of these formulae is the following: if the behaviour of the system is not abnormal (i.e. if it is normal), then the internal (unobservable) behaviour will be formula_4 and the observable behaviour formula_5. Otherwise, the internal behaviour will be formula_6 and the observable behaviour formula_7. Given the observations formula_8, the problem is to determine whether the system behaviour is normal or not (formula_9 or formula_10). This is an example of abductive reasoning.\n\nA system is said to be diagnosable if whatever the behavior of the system, we will be able to determine without ambiguity a unique diagnosis.\n\nThe problem of diagnosability is very important when designing a system because on one hand one may want to reduce the number of sensors to reduce the cost, and on the other hand one may want to increase the number of sensors to increase the probability of detecting a faulty behavior.\n\nSeveral algorithms for dealing with these problems exist. One class of algorithms answers the question whether a system is diagnosable; another class looks for sets of sensors that make the system diagnosable, and optionally comply to criteria such as cost optimization.\n\nThe diagnosability of a system is generally computed from the model of the system. In applications using model-based diagnosis, such a model is already present and doesn't need to be built from scratch.\n\n\nDX is the annual International Workshop on Principles of Diagnosis that started in 1989. \n\n"}

He was son of Kleckis (Old Prussian: \"bear\") and therefore is sometimes referred to by a nickname derived from the word \"bear\".\n\nHis first major victory came when Schippenbeil fell in 1263 after almost three years of siege. Twenty knights and their men sallied out to fight the joint forces of Batians and Sudovians in an open battle. However, the pagans blocked escape routes and all Teutons were killed. In terms of knights killed, it was one of the top ten losses by the Teutonic Knights during the 13th century. The garrison at Schippenbeil was left with too few soldiers and supplies to withstand the siege and escaped through Galindia to Masovia. Diwanus expected that fugitives would take a shorter route north to Balga or Königsberg, therefore the knights had a head start. Diwanus soon learned about the true route and, with a handful of his best men, hurried to pursue the fugitives. During a charge on the escapees, Bartians killed three knights, but Diwanus was seriously injured. \n\nSince all major Teutonic castles in Bartia fell, Bartians did not have the need to safeguard their land from potential attacks from Teutonic strongholds. They were free to send men to help other Prussian clans. Diwanus and his men were making minor expeditions into Pogesania and Chełmno Land. In 1271, a major campaign was organized together with Pogesanian leader Linko. The Bartian infantry and Pogesanians besieged a border castle, but were fended off by the Knights from Christburg. The Prussians, who managed to escape, joined their cavalry while the Knights set up their camp on the opposite bank of the Dzierzgoń River, blocking the route home. When Christians retired for the night, one half of the Prussian army crossed the river in a distance, in order to attack the Knights from the rear, while the other half charged straight across the river. The Knights were encircled. The Battle of Paganstin saw twelve knights and 500 men killed. The Prussians immediately assaulted Christburg and almost captured it. The Prussians were still looting the surrounding area when cavalry from Elbing arrived. Many of the Prussian infantry perished while cavalry escaped. Despite these losses, Diwanus was soon back and blocked roads leading to Christburg hoping to starve the castle. Three times the Knights tried to send supplies to the castle via the Dzierzgoń River, and each time the vessels were intercepted by the Bartians. However, Christburg refused to surrender. \n\nIn 1273, Diwanus brought 800 men for a siege on Schönsee. The small outpost had only three knights and a handful of sergeants. Diwanus tried to persuade them to surrender, but they refused and tried to hide their true strength by dressing every soldier as a noble knight. When Bartians attacked, brother Arnold shot and killed Diwanus. The Bartians, left without a leader, returned home. They withdrew from the uprising, and within a year the war was lost.\n"}

Hybrid seed production is predominant in modern agriculture and home gardening. It is one of the main contributors to the dramatic rise in agricultural output during the last half of the 20th century. The alternatives to hybridization are open pollination and clonal propagation.\n\nAll of the hybrid seeds planted by the farmer will produce similar plants, while the seeds of the next generation from those hybrids will not consistently have the desired characteristics. Controlled hybrids provide very uniform characteristics because they are produced by crossing two inbred strains. Elite inbred strains are used that express well-documented and consistent phenotypes (such as high crop yield) that are relatively good for inbred plants.\n\nHybrids are chosen to improve the characteristics of the resulting plants, such as better yield, greater uniformity, improved color, disease resistance.\nAn important factor is the heterosis or \"combining ability\" of the parent plants. Crossing any particular pair of inbred strains may or may not result in superior offspring. The parent strains used are therefore carefully chosen so as to achieve the uniformity that comes from the uniformity of the parents, and the superior performance that comes from heterosis.\n\nIn the US, experimental agriculture stations in the 1920s investigated the hybrid crops, and by the 1930s farmers had widely adopted the first hybrid maize.\n\n"}

As a junior officer he saw action at the Battle of the Saintes in April 1782 during the American Revolutionary War. He commanded at the defeat of the Dutch fleet in August 1795 during the French Revolutionary Wars and went on to be First Naval Lord during the closing stages of the Napoleonic Wars.\n\nYorke was born in Great Berkhampstead, Hertfordshire, on 6 June 1768, the second son, by his second marriage, of the politician Charles Yorke. He joined the navy at the age of 11, becoming a midshipman aboard , then under the command of Sir Charles Douglas, on 15 February 1780. He followed Douglas to his next command, , which flew the flag of Admiral George Rodney. Yorke was then present at Rodney's victory over François Joseph Paul de Grasse at the Battle of the Saintes from 9 April to 12 April 1782. The end of the American Revolutionary War led to the \"Formidable\" returning to Britain to be paid off. Yorke remained in employment however, transferring with Douglas to , and then moving to , under the command of Sir Erasmus Gower, filling the post of master's mate. Yorke spent three years in total serving on the Newfoundland Station.\n\nYorke was promoted to lieutenant on 16 June 1789, and moved aboard the 50-gun to serve under Admiral Sir Richard Hughes. He later served as lieutenant aboard and and in February 1791 he was appointed master and commander of the sloop . He remained aboard her, carrying out cruises into the English Channel until the outbreak of war with France in 1793. He was promoted to Post-Captain on 4 February 1793 and given command of the frigate , then part of a squadron under Admiral Richard Howe. He patrolled off the French port of Brest, and captured the corvette \"L'Espiegle\".\nYorke moved to in July 1794, and continued to serve in the Channel, occasionally ranging into the North Sea. On 22 August 1795 the \"Stag\" and a small British squadron chased two large ships and a cutter, eventually bringing the sternmost one to battle. An hour-long fight ensued, after which the enemy, subsequently found to be the Batavian frigate \"Alliance\", was forced to surrender. Yorke moved to command the newly built in March 1800, and by 1801 was in command of the 74-gun third rate . He commanded her until the Treaty of Amiens in 1802 brought a period of temporary peace. On the resumption of the war in 1803 Yorke was appointed to the 98-gun , followed by and then , an 80-gun former Danish ship captured at the Battle of Copenhagen in 1807.\n\nYorke was knighted during this period of service, on 21 April 1805, by King George III. On 23 April, Yorke was present at the installation of the Knights of the Garter, standing in for his brother, Philip Yorke, Earl of Hardwicke. Philip was at this time Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, and so was unable to be present in person. In 1810 Joseph Yorke's brother, Charles Philip Yorke became First Lord of the Admiralty and Joseph was transferred from command of the \"Christian VII\" to take up a seat on the Board of Admiralty.\n\nJoseph Yorke was promoted to Rear-Admiral of the Blue on 31 July 1810 and hoisted his flag in the 74-gun in January 1811. He sailed to the Tagus carrying reinforcements for Arthur Wellesley's army, fighting in the Peninsular War. After carrying this out he escorted a fleet returning to Britain from the East Indies. Yorke was promoted to Rear-Admiral of the White on 12 August 1812, Rear-Admiral of the Red on 4 December 1813 and Vice-Admiral of the Blue on 14 June 1814. He served as First Naval Lord in the Liverpool ministry from October 1813 until May 1816 but remained on the Admiralty Board until April 1818. He was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath (KCB) in the restructuring of that order in January 1815, promoted Vice-Admiral of the White on 12 August 1819, and promoted to Admiral of the Blue on 22 July 1830.\n\nYorke stood as a candidate for the constituency of Reigate in 1790, and was returned as its member. He represented the borough until 1806, when he was elected as member for St Germans. He stood aside, \"taking the Chiltern Hundreds\" in 1810 so that his brother, Charles Philip Yorke, could be elected. In the 1812 general election Joseph Yorke stood as a candidate for Sandwich and was returned as its member. He represented the borough until 1818 when he was re-elected to the Reigate constituency, which he represented until his death. Yorke's business interests include the chairmanship of the Waterloo Bridge Company.\n\nOn 29 March 1798, Yorke married Elizabeth Weake Rattray, the daughter of James Rattray, in Ireland. The couple had a number of children before Elizabeth's death on 20 January 1812. His eldest son, Charles Yorke also served in the navy, rising to the rank of admiral, and on the death without heir of Joseph Yorke's brother Philip, the 3rd Earl of Hardwicke in 1834, Charles became the 4th Earl. His daughter Agneta Elizabeth Yorke married the banker Robert Cooper Lee Bevan.\n\nOn 22 May 1813, Joseph married a second time, to Urania Anne, the Dowager Marchioness of Clanricarde, and daughter of George Paulet, 12th Marquess of Winchester, at St. Martin in the Fields, Westminster, London. The marriage did not produce any children.\n\nOn 5 May 1831 Yorke was returning from visiting Henry Hotham's flagship, , then moored at Spithead. He was making his way back to shore aboard the yacht \"Catherine\", in company with Captains Matthew Barton Bradby and Thomas Young, and a seaman named John Chandler, when the boat was struck by lightning in Stokes Bay, causing it to capsize. All aboard were drowned. The bodies were later recovered and an inquest returned a verdict of accidental death.

{"id": "37427", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37427", "title": "Le Chatelier's principle", "text": "Le Chatelier's principle\n\nLe Châtelier's principle (, ), also called Châtelier's principle or \"The Equilibrium Law\", can be used to predict the effect of a change in conditions on some chemical equilibria. The principle is named after Henry Louis Le Châtelier and sometimes Karl Ferdinand Braun who discovered it independently. It can be stated as:\n\nIn other words, whenever a system in equilibrium is disturbed the system will adjust itself in such a way that the effect of the change will be reduced or moderated.\n\nThis principle has a variety of names, depending upon the discipline using it (see homeostasis, a term commonly used in biology). It is common to take Le Châtelier's principle to be a more general observation, roughly stated:\n\nIn chemistry, the principle is used to manipulate the outcomes of reversible reactions, often to increase the yield of reactions. In pharmacology, the binding of ligands to the receptor may shift the equilibrium according to Le Châtelier's principle, thereby explaining the diverse phenomena of receptor activation and desensitization. In economics, the principle has been generalized to help explain the price equilibrium of efficient economic systems. In simultaneous equilibrium systems, phenomena that are in apparent contradiction to Le Châtelier's principle can occur; these can be resolved by the theory of response reactions.\n\nLe Châtelier's principle describes the qualitative behavior of systems where there is an externally induced, instantaneous change in one parameter of a system; it states that a behavioural shift occurs in the system so as to oppose (partly cancel) the parameter change. The duration of adjustment depends on the strength of the negative feedback to the initial shock. Where a shock initially induces positive feedback (such as thermal runaway), the new equilibrium can be far from the old one, and can take a long time to reach. In some dynamic systems, the end-state cannot be determined from the shock. The principle is typically used to describe closed negative-feedback systems, but applies, in general, to thermodynamically closed and isolated systems in nature, since the second law of thermodynamics ensures that the disequilibrium caused by an instantaneous shock must have a finite half-life. The principle has analogs throughout the entire physical world.\n\nThe principle while well rooted in chemical equilibrium and extended into economic theory, can also be used in describing mechanical systems in that the system put under stress will respond in a way such as to reduce or minimize that stress. Moreover, the response will generally be via the mechanism that most easily relieves that stress. Shear pins and other such sacrificial devices are design elements that protect systems against stress applied in undesired manners to relieve it so as to prevent more extensive damage to the entire system, a practical engineering application of Le Châtelier's principle.\n\nChanging the concentration of a chemical will shift the equilibrium to the side that would reduce that change in concentration. The chemical system will attempt to partly oppose the change affected to the original state of equilibrium. In turn, the rate of reaction, extent, and yield of products will be altered corresponding to the impact on the system.\n\nThis can be illustrated by the equilibrium of carbon monoxide and hydrogen gas, reacting to form methanol.\n\nSuppose we were to increase the concentration of CO in the system. Using Le Châtelier's principle, we can predict that the amount of methanol will increase, decreasing the total change in CO. If we are to add a species to the overall reaction, the reaction will favor the side opposing the addition of the species. Likewise, the subtraction of a species would cause the reaction to \"fill the gap\" and favor the side where the species was reduced. This observation is supported by the collision theory. As the concentration of CO is increased, the frequency of successful collisions of that reactant would increase also, allowing for an increase in forward reaction, and generation of the product. Even if the desired product is not thermodynamically favored, the end-product can be obtained if it is continuously removed from the solution.\n\nThe effect of a change in concentration is often exploited synthetically for condensation reactions (i.e., reactions that extrude water) that are equilibrium processes (e.g., formation of an ester from carboxylic acid and alcohol or an imine from an amine and aldehyde). This can be achieved by physically sequestering water, by adding desiccants like anhydrous magnesium sulfate or molecular sieves, or by continuous removal of water by distillation, often facilitated by a Dean-Stark apparatus.\n\nThe effect of changing the temperature in the equilibrium can be made clear by 1) incorporating heat as either a reactant or a product, and 2) assuming that an increase in temperature increases the heat content of a system. When the reaction is exothermic (Δ\"H\" is negative, puts energy out), heat is included as a product, and, when the reaction is endothermic (Δ\"H\" is positive, takes energy in), heat is included as a reactant. Hence, whether increasing or decreasing the temperature would favor the forward or the reverse reaction can be determined by applying the same principle as with concentration changes.\n\nTake, for example, the reversible reaction of nitrogen gas with hydrogen gas to form ammonia:\n\nBecause this reaction is exothermic, it produces heat:\n\nIf the temperature was increased, the heat content of the system would increase, so the system would consume some of that heat by shifting the equilibrium to the left, thereby producing less ammonia. More ammonia would be produced if the reaction was run at a lower temperature, but a lower temperature also lowers the rate of the process, so, in practice (the Haber process) the temperature is set at a compromise value that allows ammonia to be made at a reasonable rate with an equilibrium concentration that is not too unfavorable.\n\nIn exothermic reactions, increase in temperature decreases the equilibrium constant, \"K\", whereas, in endothermic reactions, increase in temperature increases the K value.\n\nLe Châtelier's principle applied to changes in concentration or pressure can be understood by having \"K\" have a constant value. The effect of temperature on equilibria, however, involves a change in the equilibrium constant. The dependence of \"K\" on temperature is determined by the sign of Δ\"H\". The theoretical basis of this dependence is given by the Van 't Hoff equation.\n\nThe equilibrium concentrations of the products and reactants do not directly depend on the total pressure of the system. They may depend on the partial pressures of the products and reactants, but if the number of moles of gaseous reactants is equal to the number of moles of gaseous products, pressure has no effect on equilibrium.\n\nChanging total pressure by adding an inert gas at constant volume does not affect the equilibrium concentrations (see §Effect of adding an inert gas below).\n\nChanging total pressure by changing the volume of the system changes the partial pressures of the products and reactants and can affect the equilibrium concentrations (see §Effect of change in volume below).\n\nChanging the volume of the system changes the partial pressures of the products and reactants and can affect the equilibrium concentrations. With a pressure increase due to a decrease in volume, the side of the equilibrium with fewer moles is more favorable and with a pressure decrease due to an increase in volume, the side with more moles is more favorable. There is no effect on a reaction where the number of moles of gas is the same on each side of the chemical equation.\n\nConsidering the reaction of nitrogen gas with hydrogen gas to form ammonia:\n\nNote the number of moles of gas on the left-hand side and the number of moles of gas on the right-hand side. When the volume of the system is changed, the partial pressures of the gases change. If we were to decrease pressure by increasing volume, the equilibrium of the above reaction will shift to the left, because the reactant side has a greater number of moles than does the product side. The system tries to counteract the decrease in partial pressure of gas molecules by shifting to the side that exerts greater pressure. Similarly, if we were to increase pressure by decreasing volume, the equilibrium shifts to the right, counteracting the pressure increase by shifting to the side with fewer moles of gas that exert less pressure. If the volume is increased because there are more moles of gas on the reactant side, this change is more significant in the denominator of the equilibrium constant expression, causing a shift in equilibrium.\n<!-- If we take the above reaction at standard conditions for temperature and pressure (STP), formula_1 would be as follow:\n\n\n"}

Although Chekov's friend Irina in the original series episode \"The Way to Eden\" was originally written as McCoy's daughter, it was changed before the episode was shot.\n\nIn the 2009 \"Star Trek\" film, which takes place in an \"alternate, parallel\" reality, McCoy and Kirk become friends at Starfleet Academy, which McCoy joins after a divorce that he says \"left [him] nothing but [his] bones.\" This line, improvised by Urban, explains how McCoy earned the nickname \"Bones\". McCoy later helps get Kirk posted aboard the USS \"Enterprise\". He later becomes the chief medical officer after Doctor Puri is killed during an attack by Nero. McCoy remains aboard to see the \"Enterprise\" defeat Nero and his crew, with Kirk becoming the commanding officer of the ship.\n\n\"The Guardian\" called Urban's portrayal of McCoy in the 2009 film an \"unqualified success\", and \"The New York Times\" called the character \"wild-eyed and funny\". Slate.com said Urban came closer than the other actors to impersonating a character's original depiction.\n\nKelley had worked with \"Star Trek\" creator Gene Roddenberry on previous television pilots, and he was Roddenberry's first choice to play the doctor aboard the USS \"Enterprise\". However, for the rejected pilot \"\" (1964), Roddenberry went with director Robert Butler's choice of John Hoyt to play Dr. Philip Boyce. For the second pilot, \"Where No Man Has Gone Before\" (1966), Roddenberry accepted director James Goldstone's decision to have Paul Fix play Dr. Mark Piper. Although Roddenberry wanted Kelley to play the character of ship's doctor, he did not put Kelley's name forward to NBC; the network never \"rejected\" the actor as Roddenberry sometimes suggested.\n\nKelley's first broadcast appearance as Doctor Leonard McCoy was in \"The Man Trap\" (1966). Despite his character's prominence, Kelley's contract granted him only a \"featuring\" credit; it was not until the second season that he was given \"starring\" credit, at the urging of producer Robert Justman. Kelley was apprehensive about \"Star Trek\"s future, telling Roddenberry that the show was \"going to be the biggest hit or the biggest miss God ever made\". Kelley portrayed McCoy throughout the original \"Star Trek\" series and voiced the character in the animated \"Star Trek\".\n\nKelley, who in his youth wanted to become a doctor like his uncle, but whose family could not pay for a medical education, in part drew upon his real-life experiences in creating McCoy: a doctor's \"matter-of-fact\" delivery of news of Kelley's mother's terminal cancer was the \"abrasive sand\" Kelley used in creating McCoy's demeanor. \"Star Trek\" writer D. C. Fontana said that while Roddenberry created the series, Kelley essentially created McCoy; everything done with the character was done with Kelley's input.\n\n\"Exquisite chemistry\" among Kelley, William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy manifested itself in their performances as McCoy, Captain James T. Kirk and science officer Spock, respectively. Nichelle Nichols, who played Uhura, referred to Kelley as her \"sassy gentleman friend\"; the friendship between the African-American Nichols and Southern Kelley was a real-life demonstration of the message Roddenberry hoped to convey through \"Star Trek\".\n\nFor the 2009 \"Star Trek\" film, writers Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman saw McCoy as an \"arbiter\" in Kirk and Spock's relationship. While Spock represented \"extreme logic, extreme science\" and Kirk symbolized \"extreme emotion and intuition\", McCoy's role as \"a very colorful doctor, essentially a very humanistic scientist\" represented the \"two extremes that often served as the glue that held the trio together.\" They chose to reveal that McCoy befriended Kirk first, explaining the \"bias\" in their friendship and why he would often be a \"little dismissive\" of Spock. Urban said the script was \"very faithful\" to the original character, including the \"great compassion for humanity and that sense of irascibility\" with which Kelley imbued the character. New Zealand-born Urban trained with a dialect coach to create McCoy's accent and reprised the role in its sequels \"Star Trek Into Darkness\" and \"Star Trek Beyond\".\n\nMcCoy is someone to whom Kirk unburdens himself, but is a foil to Spock. He is Kirk's \"friend, personal bartender, confidant, counselor, and priest\". Spock and McCoy's bickering became so popular that Roddenberry wrote in a 1968 memo \"we simply didn't realize ... how much the fans loved the bickering between our Arrowsmith and our Alien\". Urban said McCoy has a \"sense of irascibility with real passion for life and doing the right thing\", and that \"Spock's logic and McCoy's moral standing gave Kirk the benefit of having three brains instead of just one.\"\n\nKelley said that his greatest thrill at \"Star Trek\" conventions was the number of people who told him they entered the medical profession because of the McCoy character. He received two or three letters a month from others reporting similar experiences. A friend observed that despite not becoming a doctor as he had hoped, Kelley's portrayal of McCoy had helped create many doctors. According to Kelley, \"You can win awards and that sort of thing, but to influence the youth of the country ... is an award that is not handed out by the industry\".\n\nIn a humor column for the \"Canadian Medical Association Journal\", the ethicist Michael Yeo described the character of McCoy as \"TV’s only true physician\" and \"someone who has broken free from the yoke of ethics and practises the art and science of medicine beyond the stultifying opposition of paternalism and autonomy\".\n\nTwenty times on the original \"Star Trek\", McCoy declares someone or something deceased with the line, \"He's dead\", \"He's dead, Jim\", or something similar. The phrase so became a catchphrase of the character that Kelley joked that the line would appear on his tombstone—and it appeared in the first sentence of at least one obituary—but disliked repeating such lines and refused to say it in \"\" when Spock is near death. Kelley and James Doohan (Scotty) agreed to swap their lines, so McCoy warns Kirk against opening the engineering doors while Scotty says, \"He's dead already\".\n\nThe line has entered popular culture as a general metaphor. The USC literature professor Henry Jenkins cites Dr. McCoy's \"He's dead, Jim\" line as an example of fans actively participating in the creation of an underground culture in which they derive pleasure by repeating memorable lines as part of constructing new mythologies and alternative social communities.\n\nAnother of McCoy's catchphrases is his \"I'm a doctor, (Jim) not a(n)...\" statements, delivered by Kelley 11 times, and three times (by Karl Urban) in later films. McCoy repeats the line when he must perform some task beyond his medical skills, such as the \"classic moment\" when he is confronted with the unusual silicon-based Horta alien in \"The Devil in the Dark\" (1967), saying, \"I'm a doctor, not a bricklayer.\" The line was used in \"Terra Nova\". \n\nKelley himself parodied the phrase for a \"Trivial Pursuit\" commercial, in which the question is asked \"How many chambers does a human heart have?\" Kelley appears on screen and replies \"How should I know? I'm an actor, not a doctor!\".\n\n\n"}

It is native to Lichuan county in Hubei province, China. Although the shortest of the redwoods, it grows to at least 165 feet (50 meters) in height. Local villagers refer to the original tree from which most others derive as \"Shui-sa\", or \"water fir\", which is part of a local shrine. Since its rediscovery in 1944, the dawn redwood has become a popular ornamental.\n\nTogether with \"Sequoia sempervirens\" (coast redwood) and \"Sequoiadendron giganteum\" (giant sequoia) of California, \"Metasequoia\" is classified in the Cupressaceae subfamily Sequoioideae. \"M. glyptostroboides\" is the only living species in its genus, but three fossil species are known. Sequoioideae and several other genera have been transferred from the former Taxodiaceae family to Cupressaceae based on DNA analysis.\n\n\"Metasequoia\" redwood fossils are known from many areas in the Northern Hemisphere; more than 20 fossil species have been named (some were even identified as the genus \"Sequoia\"), but are considered as just three species, \"M. foxii\", \"M. milleri\", and \"M. occidentalis\". During the Paleocene and Eocene, extensive forests of \"Metasequoia\" occurred as far north as Strathcona Fiord on Ellesmere Island and sites on Axel Heiberg Island (northern Canada) at around 80° N latitude. \"Metasequoia\" was likely deciduous by this time. Given that the high latitudes in this period were warm and tropical, it is hypothesized that the deciduous habit evolved in response to the unusual light availability patterns, not to major seasonal variations in temperature. During three months in the summer, the sun would shine continuously, while three months of the winter would be complete darkness. It is also hypothesized that the change from evergreen to deciduous habit occurred before colonizing the high latitudes and was the reason \"Metasequoia\" was dominant in the north.\n\nLarge petrified trunks and stumps of the extinct \"Metasequoia occidentalis\" (sometimes identified as \"Sequoia occidentalis\") also make up the major portion of Tertiary fossil plant material in the badlands of western North Dakota.\n\nThe trees are well known from late Cretaceous to Miocene strata, but no fossils are known after that. Before its discovery, the taxon was believed to have become extinct during the Miocene; when it was discovered extant, it was heralded as a \"living fossil\".\n\nThe bark and foliage are similar to \"Sequoia\", but \"Metasequoia\" is deciduous like \"Taxodium distichum\" (bald cypress), and, similarly, older specimens form wide buttresses on the lower trunk. It is a fast-growing tree to 130–150 feet (40–45 m) tall and 6 feet (2 m) in trunk diameter in cultivation so far (with the potential to grow even higher).\n\nThe leaves are opposite, 0.4-1.25 inches (1–3 cm) long, and bright fresh green, turning foxy red-brown in fall. The pollen cones are 0.25 inch (6 mm) long, produced on long spikes in early spring; they are only produced on trees growing in regions with hot summers. The cones are globose to ovoid, 0.6-1.0 inches (1.5-2.5 cm) in diameter with 16–28 scales, arranged in opposite pairs in four rows, each pair at right angles to the adjacent pair; they mature in about 8–9 months after pollination.\n\n\"Metasequoia\" has experienced morphological stasis for the past 65 million years: the modern \"Metasequoia glyptostroboides\" appears identical to its late Cretaceous ancestors.\n\n\"Metasequoia\" was first described as a fossil from the Mesozoic Era by Shigeru Miki in 1941, but in 1944, a small stand of an unidentified tree species was discovered in China in Modaoxi (磨刀溪; presently, Moudao (谋道), in Lichuan County, Hubei) by Zhan Wang. Due to World War II, these were not studied further until 1946, and only finally described as a new living species of \"Metasequoia\" in 1948 by Wan Chun Cheng and Hu Hsen Hsu. In 1948, the Arnold Arboretum of Harvard University sent an expedition to collect seeds and, soon after, seedling trees were distributed to various universities and arboreta worldwide for growth trials.\n\nPresently, a number of natural \"Metasequoia\" populations exist in the hills and wetlands of Hubei's Lichuan County. Most of them are small, with fewer than 30 trees each; however, the largest of them, in Xiaohe Valley, is estimated to consist of around 5,400 trees. A few trees are also said to exist in neighboring Hunan Province.\n\nDawn redwoods are fast-growing trees. They will grow too large for small gardens, but can be good in a wide range of larger gardens and parks. Although they live in wet sites in their native habitat they will also tolerate dry soils. Unlike most conifers, their deciduous habit means they do not cast too much shade in winter. They are grown as street trees in London and elsewhere.\n\nStrawberry Fields is a landscaped section in New York City's Central Park dedicated to Beatle John Lennon. At the northern end of the lawns are three dawn redwood trees. The trees drop their needles each fall and regrow them each spring, a symbol of eternal renewal. The trees are expected to reach a height of 36 metres (118 ft), making them visible from great distances.\n\n"}
{"id": "2304704", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2304704", "title": "Mirror punishment", "text": "Mirror punishment\n\nA mirror punishment is a penal form of poetic justice which reflects the nature or means of the crime in the means of (often physical) punishment as a form of retributive justice—the practice of \"repaying\" a wrongdoer \"in kind\".\n\nIt can be an application of the \"lex talionis\" (“an eye for an eye”), but is not always proportional justice, as a similar method may be used to produce a worse or milder effect than the crime it \"retaliates\".\n\nThe simplest method of mirror punishment is to enact the same action upon the criminal as the criminal perpetrated upon the victim. For example, thieves have the same amount of money taken from them as they stole; one who strikes another is struck in the same way; one who willfully causes another person's death is killed; and so on.\n\nOften, however, a more esoteric method of mirror punishment is used, which implies punishing the part of the criminal's body used to commit the crime. Extreme examples include the amputation of the hands of a thief, as still permitted by Sharia law, or during the Middle Ages in Europe; or disabling the foot or leg of a runaway slave. \nOther examples include the punishment of adulterous women by the insertion of irritating substances into their vaginas (in the past hot pokers were sometimes used). A less extreme example is putting soap into a child's mouth for using inappropriate language (referred to in English as \"washing someone's mouth out with soap\"). \n\nAnother method to accomplish \"poetic justice\" is to mirror the physical method of the crime, e.g., executing a murderer with his own weapon, burning arsonists alive, or in a more far-fetched example, boiling a counterfeiter alive (because bullion is boiled to be minted).\n\nW. S. Gilbert's comic opera \"The Mikado\" contains a song satirizing mirror punishment. For example:\n\nThe refrain line \"to let the punishment fit the crime\" has sometimes been quoted in the course of British political debates, though the concept predates Gilbert. For instance, episode 80 of the television series \"Magnum, P.I.\", entitled \"Let the Punishment Fit the Crime\", features bits of several songs from \"The Mikado\". The phrase and the Mikado's song also are featured in the \"Dad's Army\" episode, \"A Soldier's Farewell.\" In \"The Parent Trap\" (1961), the camp director quotes the phrase before sentencing the twins to the isolation cabin together.\n"}

James O' Brien and Mary Jephson in Drogheda.

One important advocate of such a metaphysics, Josiah Royce (the founder of American idealism), wrote that he was indifferent \"whether anybody calls all this Theism or Pantheism\". Plato is regarded as one of the earliest representatives of objective idealism. It is distinct from the subjective idealism of George Berkeley, and it abandons the thing-in-itself of Kant's dualism.\n\nIdealism, in terms of metaphysics, is the philosophical view that the mind or spirit constitutes the fundamental reality. It has taken several distinct but related forms. Among them are objective and subjective idealism. Objective idealism accepts common sense realism (the view that material objects exist) but rejects naturalism (according to which the mind and spiritual values have emerged from material things), whereas subjective idealism denies that material objects exist independently of human perception and thus stands opposed to both realism and naturalism.\n\nSchelling and Hegel had forms of objective idealism. \n\nThe philosopher Charles Sanders Peirce stated his own version of objective idealism in the following manner:\n\nThe one intelligible theory of the universe is that of objective idealism, that matter is effete mind, inveterate habits becoming physical laws (Peirce, CP 6.25).\nA.

{"id": "18493095", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18493095", "title": "Open world", "text": "Open world\n\nIn video games, an open world is a virtual world in which the player can explore and approach objectives freely, as opposed to a world with more linear gameplay. While games have used open-world designs since the 1980s, the implementation in \"Grand Theft Auto III\" (2001) set a standard that has been used since.\n\nGames with open or free-roaming worlds typically lack the invisible walls and loading screens common in linear level designs. Generally, open-world games still enforce many restrictions in the game environment, either because of absolute technical limitations or in-game limitations imposed by a game's linearity. Examples of high level of autonomy in computer games can be found in massively multiplayer online role-playing games (MMORPG) or in single-player games adhering to the open world concept such as the \"Fallout\" series. The main appeal of open-world gameplay is that they provide a simulated reality and allow players to develop their character and its behavior in the direction of their choosing. In these cases, there is often no concrete goal or end to the game.\n\nAn open world is a level or game designed as nonlinear, open areas with many ways to reach an objective. Some games are designed with both traditional and open-world levels. An open world facilitates greater exploration than a series of smaller levels, or a level with more linear challenges. Reviewers have judged the quality of an open world based on whether there are interesting ways for the player to interact with the broader level when they ignore their main objective. Some games actually use real settings to model an open world, such as New York City.\n\nA major design challenge is to balance the freedom of an open world with the structure of a dramatic storyline. Since players may perform actions that the game designer did not expect, the game's writers must find creative ways to impose a storyline on the player without interfering with their freedom. As such, games with open worlds will sometimes break the game's story into a series of missions, or have a much simpler storyline altogether. Other games instead offer side-missions to the player that do not disrupt the main storyline. Most open-world games make the character a blank slate that players can project their own thoughts onto, although several games such as \"\" offer more character development and dialogue. Writing in 2005, David Braben described the narrative structure of current videogames as \"little different to the stories of those Harold Lloyd films of the 1920s\", and considered genuinely open-ended stories to be the \"Holy Grail we are looking for in fifth generation gaming\". Gameplay designer Manveer Heir, who worked on \"Mass Effect 3\" and \"Mass Effect Andromeda\" for Electronic Arts, said that there are difficulties in the design of an open-world game since it is difficult to predict how players will approach solving gameplay challenges offered by a design, in contrast to a linear progression, and needs to be a factor in the game's development from its onset. Heir opined that some of the critical failings of \"Andromeda\" were due to the open world being added late in development.\n\nSome open-world games, to guide the player towards major story events, do not provide the world's entire map at the start of the game, but require the player to complete a task to obtain part of that map, often identifying missions and points of interest when they view the map. This has been derogatorily referred to as \"Ubisoft towers\", as this mechanic was promoted in Ubisoft's \"Assassin's Creed\" series (the player climbing a large tower as to observe the landscape around it and identify waypoints nearby) and reused in other Ubisoft games, including \"Far Cry\", \"\" and \"Watch Dogs\". Other games that use this approach include \"\" and \"\".\n\nGames with open worlds typically give players infinite lives or continues, although games like \"Blaster Master\" force the player to start from the beginning should they die too many times. There is also a risk that players may get lost as they explore an open world; thus designers sometimes try to break the open world into manageable sections.\n\nProcedural generation refers to content generated algorithmically rather than manually, and is often used to generate game levels and other content. While procedural generation does not guarantee that a game or sequence of levels are nonlinear, it is an important factor in reducing game development time, and opens up avenues making it possible to generate larger and more or less unique seamless game worlds on the fly and using fewer resources. This kind of procedural generation is known as worldbuilding, in which general rules are used to construct a believable world.\n\nMost 4X and roguelike games make use of procedural generation to some extent to generate game levels. SpeedTree is an example of a developer-oriented tool used in the development of \"\" and aimed at speeding up the level design process. Procedural generation also made it possible for the developers of \"Elite\", David Braben and Ian Bell, to fit the entire game—including thousands of planets, dozens of trade commodities, multiple ship types and a plausible economic system—into less than 22 kilobytes of memory.\n\nEmergence refers to complex situations in a video game that emerge (either expectedly or unexpectedly) from the interaction of relatively simple game mechanics. According to Peter Molyneux, emergent gameplay appears wherever a game has a good simulation system that allows players to play in the world and have it respond realistically to their actions. It is what made \"SimCity\" and \"The Sims\" compelling to players. Similarly, being able to freely interact with the city's inhabitants in \"Grand Theft Auto\" added an extra dimension to the series.\n\nIn recent years game designers have attempted to encourage emergent play by providing players with tools to expand games through their own actions. Examples include in-game web browsers in \"EVE Online\" and \"The Matrix Online\"; XML integration tools and programming languages in \"Second Life\"; shifting exchange rates in \"Entropia Universe\"; and the complex object-and-grammar system used to solve puzzles in \"Scribblenauts\". Other examples of emergence include interactions between physics and artificial intelligence. One challenge that remains to be solved, however, is how to tell a compelling story using only emergent technology.\n\nIn an op-ed piece for BBC News, David Braben, co-creator of \"Elite\", called truly open-ended game design \"The Holy Grail\" of modern video gaming, citing games like \"Elite\" and the \"Grand Theft Auto\" series as early steps in that direction. Peter Molyneux has also stated that he believes emergence (or emergent gameplay) is where video game development is headed in the future. He has attempted to implement open-world gameplay to a great extent in some of his games, particularly \"Black & White\" and \"Fable\".\n\nThere is no consensus on what the earliest open world game is, due to differing definitions of how large or open a world needs to be. Ars Technica traces the concept back to the free-roaming exploration of 1976 text adventure game \"Colossal Cave Adventure\", which inspired the free-roaming exploration of \"Adventure\" (1980), but notes that it wasn't until 1984 that what \"we now know as open-world gaming\" took on a \"definite shape\" with 1984 space simulator \"Elite\", considered a pioneer of the open world; Gamasutra argues that its open-ended sandbox style is rooted in flight simulators, such as SubLOGIC's \"Flight Simulator\" (1979/1980), noting most flight sims \"offer a 'free flight' mode that allows players to simply pilot the aircraft and explore the virtual world\". Others trace the concept back to 1981 CRPG \"\", which had a free-roaming overworld map inspired by tabletop RPG \"Dungeons & Dragons\". The overworld maps of the first five \"Ultima\" games, released up to 1988, lacked a single, unified scale, with towns and other places represented as icons; this style was adopted by the first three \"Dragon Quest\" games, released from 1986 to 1988 in Japan.\n\nEarly examples of open-world gameplay in adventure games include \"The Portopia Serial Murder Case\" (1983) and \"The Lords of Midnight\" (1984), with open-world elements also found in \"The Hobbit\" (1982) and \"Valhalla\" (1983). The strategy video game, \"The Seven Cities of Gold\" (1984), is also cited as an early open-world game, influencing \"Sid Meier's Pirates!\" (1987). Eurogamer also cites British computer games such as \"Ant Attack\" (1983) and \"Sabre Wulf\" (1984) as early examples.\n\nAccording to \"Game Informer\"s Kyle Hilliard, \"Hydlide\" (1984) and \"The Legend of Zelda\" (1986) were among the first open-world games, along with \"Ultima\". IGN traces the roots of open-world game design to \"The Legend of Zelda\", which it argues is \"the first really good game based on exploration\", while noting that it was anticipated by \"Hydlide\", which it argues is \"the first RPG that rewarded exploration\". According to GameSpot, never \"had a game so open-ended, nonlinear, and liberating been released for the mainstream market\" with \"The Legend of Zelda\". According to \"The Escapist\", \"The Legend of Zelda\" was an early example of open-world, nonlinear gameplay, with an expansive and cohesive world, inspiring many games to adopt a similar open-world design.\n\n\"Mercenary\" (1985) has been cited as the first open -orld 3D action-adventure game. There were also other open-\\ world games in the 1980s, such as \"Back to Skool\" (1985), \"Turbo Esprit\" (1986) and \"Alternate Reality: The City\" (1985). \"Wasteland\", released in 1988, is also considered an open-world game. The early 1990s saw open-world games such as \"The Terminator\" (1990), \"The Adventures of Robin Hood\" (1991), and \"Hunter\" (1991), which IGN describes as the first sandbox game to feature full 3D, third-person graphics, and Ars Technica argues \"has one of the strongest claims to the title of \"GTA\" forebear\". Sierra On-Line's 1992 adventure game \"King's Quest VI\" has an open world; almost half of the quests are optional, many have multiple solutions, and players can solve most in any order. \"Quarantine\" (1994) is an example of an open-world driving game from this period, while \"Iron Soldier\" (1994) is an open-world mech game.\n\nIGN considers Nintendo's \"Super Mario 64\" (1996) revolutionary for its 3D open-ended free-roaming worlds, which had rarely been seen in 3D games before, along with its analog stick controls and camera control. Other 3D examples include \"\" (1998), the DMA Design (Rockstar North) game \"Body Harvest\" (1998), the Angel Studios (Rockstar San Diego) games \"Midtown Madness\" (1999) and \"\" (2000), the Reflections Interactive (Ubisoft Reflections) game \"Driver\" (1999), and the Rareware games \"Banjo-Kazooie\" (1998), \"Donkey Kong 64\" (1999), and \"Banjo-Tooie\" (2000).\n\n1UP considers Sega's adventure \"Shenmue\" (1999) the originator of the \"open city\" subgenre, touted as a \"FREE\" (\"Full Reactive Eyes Entertainment\") game giving players the freedom to explore an expansive sandbox city with its own day-night cycles, changing weather, and fully voiced non-player characters going about their daily routines. The game's large interactive environments, wealth of options, level of detail and the scope of its urban sandbox exploration has been compared to later sandbox games like \"Grand Theft Auto III\" and its sequels, Sega's own \"Yakuza\" series, \"Fallout 3\", and \"Deadly Premonition\".\n\nThe series that had the greatest cultural impact was \"Grand Theft Auto\", with over 200 million sales. Creative director Gary Penn, who previously worked on \"\", cited \"Elite\" as a key influence, calling it \"basically \"Elite\" in a city\", and mentioned other team members being influenced by \"Syndicate\" and \"Mercenary\". \"Grand Theft Auto III\" combined elements from previous games, and fused them together into a new immersive 3D experience that helped define open-world games for a new generation. Executive producer Sam Houser described it as \"\"Zelda\" meets \"Goodfellas\"\", while producer Dan Houser also cited \"The Legend of Zelda\" and \"Super Mario 64\" as influences. Radio stations had been implemented earlier in games such as Maxis' \"SimCopter\" (1996), the ability to beat or kill non-player characters date back to titles such \"Portopia\" (1983), and \"Valhalla\" (1983) and the way in which players run over pedestrians and get chased by police has been compared to \"Pac-Man\" (1980). After the release of \"Grand Theft Auto III\", many games which employed a 3D open world, such as Ubisoft's \"Watch Dogs\" and Deep Silver's \"Saints Row\" series, were labeled, often disparagingly, as \"Grand Theft Auto\" clones, much as how many early first-person shooters were called \"\"Doom\" clones\".\n\nOther notable examples include \"World of Warcraft\" and \"The Elder Scrolls\" series of games, which feature a large and diverse world offering tasks and possibilities to play.\n\nThe popular \"Assassin's Creed\" series, which began in 2007, allows players to explore historic open-world settings. These include the Holy Land during the Crusades, Renaissance Rome, New England during the American Revolution, the Caribbean during The Golden Age of Piracy, Paris during the French Revolution, London at the height of the Industrial Revolution, Ancient Egypt and Greece during the Peloponnesian War. The series intertwines factual history with a fictional storyline. In the fictional storyline, the Templars and the Assassins have been mortal enemies for all of known history. Their conflict stems from the Templars' desire to have peace through control, which directly contrasts the Assassins' wish for peace with free will. Their fighting influences much of history, as the sides often back real historical forces. For example, during the American Revolution depicted in \"Assassin's Creed 3\", the Templars support the British, while the Assassins side with the American colonists.\n\n\"\" was developed by GSC Game World in 2007, followed by two other games, a prequel and a sequel. The free world style of the zone was divided into huge maps, like sectors, and the player can go from one sector to another, depending on required quests or just by choice.\n\nIn 2011, Dan Ryckert of \"Game Informer\" wrote that open-world crime games were \"a major force\" in the gaming industry for the preceding decade.\n\nAnother popular open-world sandbox game is \"Minecraft\", which has sold over 122 million copies worldwide on multiple platforms by February 2017. \"Minecraft\"s procedurally generated overworlds cover a virtual 100 billion square kilometers.\n\nThe Outerra Engine is a world rendering engine in development since 2008 that is capable of seamlessly rendering whole planets from space down to ground level. Anteworld is a world-building game and free tech-demo of the Outerra Engine that builds up on real world data to render planet Earth realistically on a true-to-life scale.\n\n\"No Man's Sky\", released in 2016, is an open-world game set in a virtually infinite universe. According to the developers, through procedural generation, the game is able to produce more than 18 quintillion (18*10^15 or 18,000,000,000,000,000) planets to explore. Several critics found that the nature of the game can become repetitive and monotonous, with the survival gameplay elements being lackluster and tedious. Jake Swearingen in \"New York\" said, \"You can procedurally generate 18.6 quintillion unique planets, but you can’t procedurally generate 18.6 quintillion unique things to do.\" Subsequent updates made post-release have since aimed to address these criticisms.\nIn 2017, the open-world design of \"\" has been described by critics as being revolutionary, and by developers as a paradigm shift for open-world design. In contrast to the more structured approach of most open-world games, \"Breath of the Wild\" features a large and fully interactive world that is generally unstructured and rewards the exploration and manipulation of its world. Inspired by the original 1986 \"Legend of Zelda\", the open world of \"Breath of the Wild\" integrates multiplicative gameplay, where \"objects react to the player's actions and the objects themselves also influence each other.\" Along with a physics engine, the game's open world also integrates a chemistry engine, \"which governs the physical properties of certain objects and how they relate to each other,\" rewarding experimentation. Nintendo has described the game's approach to open-world design as \"open air\".\n\n"}
{"id": "36626461", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36626461", "title": "Pi de les Tres Branques", "text": "Pi de les Tres Branques\n\nPi de les Tres Branques (, \"the three-branched pine\") is a dead pine tree located in the countryside near the town of Berga in north-central Catalonia, Spain. It has long been regarded by some Catalan nationalists as representing the unity of the three \"Catalan Countries\" and is the site of regular political-cultural gatherings.\n\nThe tree has been dead since 1915 and is in poor structural condition, due in part to politically-motivated vandalism, but there is a very similar living tree a short distance away known as \"Pi Jove de les Tres Branques\" (\"the young three-branched pine\"), which is regarded as its successor. Both are protected as \"monumental trees\" by the Catalan government.\n\nThe tree is a Scots pine (\"Pinus sylvestris\"), tall, and as its name suggests, consists of three main branches or trunks rising from a common base. It is located in the centre of the Campllong plain, which measures about by and occupies the flat floor of a valley, surrounded by forested mountains of the Pre-Pyrenees, at an altitude of . To the south, separating the valley from Berga town, is the ridge, home to the religious complex, and to the north are the Rasos de Peguera mountains and ski resort. Berga is away by road.\n\nThe tree previously dominated the valley's farmed and grazed land, due to its height and full foliage, and was visible from a long distance, as is shown in old photographs. However, much of the surrounding land has now been taken over by forest, and Pi de les Tres Branques now has many other trees in its vicinity, which, together with its current skeletal form, make it much less visible than before.\n\nThe valley is traversed by a minor road which terminates at the small settlement of Castellar del Riu at its western end. The road passes close by Pi de les Tres Branques, which is indicated by a signpost.\nAlthough legend places the tree much earlier, it has been estimated that Pi de les Tres Branques took root between 1630 and 1632, when the local farmhouse was built.\n\nThe tree had been traditionally celebrated as a symbol of the Holy Trinity, and it is still a venue for religious ceremonies. The first reference in extant records was in 1685, when a cartographer wrote that it was known as the Tree of the Trinity. It is also recorded that in 1746, the bishop of Solsona granted indulgences to those who prayed at the site.\n\nIn 1876, the landowner of the site, in a letter to a local magazine denying that he was planning to sell the tree for timber, pointed out that it also represented the revolutionary ideals of liberty, equality and fraternity.\n\nThe Catalan language cultural revival of the 19th century saw a great increase in Catalan literature and culture. In 1875, playwright published a play \"\", which is set in Berga and at the tree, and contains a passage suggesting that the tree was already a Catalan national symbol. However, it was the 1888 poem \"Lo Pi de les Tres Branques\" by the poet Fr Jacint Verdaguer, published in his anthology \"\", which brought the tree to widespread attention, converting what was mainly a local religious symbol into a significant secular national symbol. In his poem, Jacint Verdaguer created the so-called 'legend' of the king-child King James I of Aragon who after being released from captivity in Narbonne (France) travelled with his retinue through Catalonia back to his seat at Monzón in Aragon, supposedly spending one of the nights sleeping under Pi de les Tres Branques, and it was there that he had an inspirational dream that he was destined to rule three kingdoms, represented by the three trunks of the tree, conquering the Balearic Islands and the Kingdom of Valencia from the Moors, which in fact he later achieved.\n\nThe previous year, Verdaguer had stayed a few days in the nearby Queralt Sanctuary and visited the tree. \"Lo Pi de les Tres Branques\" recounts the story of James and the tree's symbolism of the Trinity and the unity of the Catalan Countries, and expressed the wish that it be adopted as Catalonia's national tree. The poem has remained the tree's principal literary connection, regularly recited at gatherings there. It starts and ends with the often-quoted lines \"Preguem que sia aqueix Pi / l'arbre sagrat de la pàtria.\" (\"We pray that this Pine will be / the sacred tree of the fatherland.\").\n\nIt is accepted that in fact Verdaguer invented the story of James's sojourn for his poem, since there is no record of it before then, and that the poem's popularity created the legend.\n\nIn 1901, when Verdaguer was presiding at the Floral Games, a traditional Catalan poetry contest, he coined the sobriquet \"Guernica of Catalonia\" for the tree, referring to the Tree of Guernica, an oak tree which symbolises Basque freedom. He also suggested the tree's trunks symbolised the three major awards of the contest: country, faith, and love.\n\nIn May 1901 the landowner transferred ownership of the tree to the (\"Unió Catalanista\"), a grouping of various nationalist organisations, at their meeting in Terrassa, though the transaction was never legally registered.\nThis new popularity coincided with the slow decay of the tree, which eventually died in 1915.\n\nIn 1987 the Catalan regional government listed the tree as a protected \"monumental tree\", one of the first three such trees (along with Pi Jove and \"Roure de Can Codorniu\" in Sant Sadurní d'Anoia). A silhouette of Pi de les Tres Branques (while it was alive) is now used by the government as a generic logo for monumental trees.\nBefore its death, Pi de les Tres Branques had been attacked several times, for economic and/or political reasons.\nIn 1901, Jacint Verdaguer reported that a woodcutter had recently tried to cut down one of the trunks, causing it to lean out; damage from which the tree was unlikely to recover. It was also reported that around 1895, cuts had been made to tap the tree for resin, and a fire lit at its base to speed the process. This and other damage prompted the Catalanist Union to erect a high stone wall around the tree in 1907 to protect against further attacks, though it was suggested that the building work also contributed to the subsequent death of the tree. By 1915 the aforementioned wall had been demolished.\n\nIn 1910, it was reported that the tree had lost its leaves, though others suggest a date of 1913, and it was completely dead by 1915. Scots pines have a natural lifespan of up to over 700 years, depending on the region.\n\nMany years later, the trunk that was damaged as reported by Verdaguer, was struck by lightning and the top half broke off. The remnant of that trunk is still supported by a small stone wall.\n\nFollowing its death, the tree has continued to be attacked many times by elements opposed to its political symbolism.\n\nIn 1939, after the end of the Civil War, supporters of the victorious Nationalist faction started an attempt to topple the tree, but were repelled by local people. It has also been subject to regular minor damage such as anti-Catalan graffiti.\n\nHowever, the most serious deliberate damage happened during the night of 12/13 May 2014, when the tallest trunk was sawn off at its base with a chainsaw, by unknown perpetrators. Following the vandalism, the severed trunk was stored, and it was eventually decided to re-attach it with artificial supports, several steel straps connecting the trunk to the base; this work was carried out in early July 2015 at a cost of €35,000, shared by the Catalan government and the Barcelona provincial administration.\n\nIn January 2016, the tree was again attacked (along with Pi Jove) with a 10 cm chainsaw cut into one of the other trunks. This damage was quickly patched up with steel straps as before.\n\nFollowing the death of Pi de les Tres Branques, another three-branched pine away had been adopted as its successor. \"Pi Jove de les Tres Branques\", or \"Pi de les Tres Branques II\", is also hundreds of years old, but smaller at tall. Its similarities to the main tree had been noticed as far back as 1810, when the Baron of Maldà mentioned it in his diary.\n\nAt the 1921 rally at the site, following a campaign by poet-politician Ventura Gassol, Pi Jove was inaugurated as the successor to the then-dead main tree. Speaking at the event, Gassol invited the landowner, who was present, to donate the tree to the Commonwealth of Catalonia (a semi-recognised autonomous government), but he declined, saying that practical effort is more important than symbols.\n\nIt has since become the main attraction for younger and more radical elements of the nationalist movement. The older and younger trees are often simply called \"el Pi Vell\" (the old pine) and \"el Pi Jove\" (the young pine) respectively, to distinguish the two.\n\nAlong with Pi Vell, Pi Jove was registered as a protected \"monumental tree\" in 1987.\n\nUnlike Pi Vell, Pi Jove had escaped the attentions of vandals until more recently, due to its lower political profile and greater distance (200 m) from the road. In 2010, it was discovered with a circumferential cut through the bark, in addition to apparent shotgun damage. Vandals attacked it in June 2015, attempting to saw through one of its trunks, though it was not thought that the damage was serious enough to kill the affected trunk. As a precaution, in December 2015 arborists installed a frame to hold the three trunks together and ensure their stability. In January 2016, deeper chainsaw cuts were discovered on the already-damaged trunk which are believed harsh enough to kill the trunk altogether; these vandals also attacked Pi Vell.\n\nPi de les Tres Branques, as a symbol of the united Catalan Countries, or simply of Catalan self-determination, has been the site of large political rallies since the turn of the 20th century, at first sporadically, but annually since 1980.\n\nThe first record of a political assembly there was in October 1900, when a large group of Carlist troops, led by , based themselves there in preparation for their part in the failed .\n\nThe first major rally was in 1904 when the Catalanist Union organised an assembly there to celebrate its acquisition of the site, on Sunday 25 September. The ceremony, and associated events in Berga the day before, attracted several hundred activists, with messages from foreign sympathisers being read out. Another rally was held in 1915.\n\nThe next major rally was held in 1921, on 25 July, the St. James holiday; a key point of that event included the inauguration of Pi Jove as the intended replacement for the original tree.\n\nSubsequent political developments made it difficult to hold large organised rallies at the site. Catalan political gatherings were banned during the 1923–1930 dictatorship of Miguel Primo de Rivera, travel was difficult during the 1936–1939 Spanish Civil War, and political gatherings were again banned in Francoist Spain (1939–1975) and for some time after.\n\nIt was not until 1980, following the restoration of democracy in Spain, that the first annual gathering of the modern era took place, starting a tradition of a large gathering at the site on the third Sunday of July each year.\n\nAttendance at the gathering has varied; the 1980 inaugural gathering attracted 3,000 visitors, reached a peak of 14,000 in 1986, but has since declined, with attendances of 2,000 in 2001, 1,000 in 2012 and 1,500 in 2014.\nIt attracts Catalan nationalists of many different viewpoints, including those attending a mass, political activists from the entire nationalist spectrum left and right giving speeches, organisations hosting stands and selling political books and souvenirs, and performers of traditional Catalan cultural activities such as \"sardana\" bands and dancers, \"castellers\" (human towers), and \"gegants\" (giant puppets). The gathering also marks the culmination of the four-day \"El Rebrot\" (\"The Shoot\") musical/political festival which has been held in Berga almost every year since 2001, organised by the Maulets/Arran left-wing youth organisation.\n\nBecause of the shortage of parking at the site, shuttle buses are provided by Berga town council, who also organise catering for the crowds in the town after the event.\n\nEvents at the gathering have several times resulted in controversies, and clashes between rival political factions. Following the 1981 event, the Catalan parliament president Heribert Barrera, two parliamentary deputies, and several others, faced criminal charges of \"insulting the feelings and unity of the Spanish nation and distributing illegal publications\". The charges were dropped after three years. The 1986 gathering was marred by the burning of Spanish flags and harassment of moderate groups. As a result, the mainstream political parties Democratic Convergence and Republican Left stayed away from the 1987 event. In 1988, different factions of the far-left Movement for Defence of the Land (MDT) fought each other. In 1991, MDT militants attacked youth members of Democratic Convergence and Republican Left, and in 1996, hooded left-wing militants came from their assembly at Pi Jove to attack members of Estat Català at Pi Vell. Since the events of 1996, the authorities have increased security at the gathering, and the event has returned to a peaceful cultural atmosphere.\n\nAlthough both Pi Vell and Pi Jove are officially protected, they are easily accessible in an isolated wooded area, and therefore vulnerable to vandalism as well as natural hazards such as lightning and wildfire. Several proposals have been made over the years to improve the site.\n\nAround 1990, a private business identified the Campllong valley, with Pi de les Tres Branques as a central attraction, as one of the possible locations for a large-scale Catalan-identity theme park called \"Identirama\". A different site was eventually selected, but the project was abandoned.\n\nIn 2003, the Catalan parliament passed a resolution urging development of a government plan to improve the site. A government report in 2001, re-published in 2004, included a proposal to cut down the fragile Pi Vell, leaving the stump in place along with a commemorative monument, and purchase and develop the site as a public amenity.\n\nThe attack on Pi Jove in 2010 prompted activists to complain about perceived ongoing lack of action by the authorities, and prompted the local municipality of Castellar del Riu to start work with interested parties to develop a plan to secure the site. In 2012 the mayor announced plans to take over the maintenance of the land around the two trees and develop facilities for visitors, including a car park and information panels.\n\nIn March 2015, following the serious attack on Pi Vell ten months before, the government set up a working group consisting of representatives of the Barcelona provincial administration, the local municipality, and the Institute of Catalan Studies, to manage the maintenance and protection of the two trees. The first result was the repair of the damaged tree in July, and in February 2016 they decided to place video security cameras at the site, watching both trees.\n\nAnother similarly named tree is \"Pi de les Tres Branques de Freixinet\", located near the village of Freixinet in the municipality of Riner in central Catalonia. This tree is also protected by the Catalan government, since 1988, but was killed in a forest fire in 1998.\n\nIn recent times, local bodies such as the municipality of Castellar del Riu or Berga or the local branch of the Catalan National Assembly, have adopted the practice of presenting a young three-branched pine tree or sapling claimed to be a descendant of Pi de les Tres Branques to other bodies, as symbols of solidarity. Early examples include presentations to the Castle of Gallifa in 1986, and the Castle of St. Ferran in Berga in 1992 (along with a sapling of the Tree of Guernica). The practice gained momentum following the February 2014 presentation of a young tree to the town of Folgueroles, to commemorate Jacint Verdaguer who was born there; that tree has since been vandalised. Subsequent 2014 recipients have included Andorra la Vella, Sant Hipòlit de Voltregà, and Saldes. The Forest Museum in Sant Celoni also claims to have five descendants of Pi de les Tres Branques in its grounds.\n\n\n"}

Repeats of the show are broadcast in the UK on Watch.\n\nThe program is narrated by David Jason and presented by Nigel Marven. The fictional component is the theme that Nigel goes back to various geological time periods through a space-time portal, and brings live specimens of extinct animals back to the present day, where they are exhibited in a wildlife park named Prehistoric Park, which is a big area between high steep mountains and ocean, with varied environments, in what looks like KwaZulu-Natal province in South Africa.\n\nThe story, which is told in the style of a documentary, focuses on naturalist Nigel Marven leading missions to find and collect extinct animals from the distant past by use of a time machine. The animals are then placed in the confines of Prehistoric Park, a private wildlife park that is situated in a dry, mountainous region of an unspecified part of the world. Marven's core motivation in the series is to defy extinction and to give select extinct species a second chance at life.\n\n\nThere are various other staff members, but none of their names have been given.

{"id": "26265948", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26265948", "title": "Pseudosenility", "text": "Pseudosenility\n\nPseudosenility also reversible dementia is a condition where older people are in a state of memory loss, confusion, or disorientation that may have a cause other than the ordinary aging process. Generally, the term \"reversible dementia\" is used to describe most cases. A more specific term \"Pseudodementia\" is referring to \"behavioral changes that resembler those of the progressive degenerative dementias, but which are attributable to so-called functional causes\".\n\nThe \"New York Times\" reports that illnesses such as the flu and hydrocephalus, as well as side-effects to common medications, can produce symptoms in the elderly that are difficult to distinguish from ordinary dementia caused by aging. However, if the real cause of the effects is caught early enough, the effects can be reversed. According to studies cited in Cunha (1990), approximate 10% to 30% of patients who have exhibited symptoms of dementia might have a treatable or reversible pathologic process to some extent.\n\nIt should be noticed that describing the causation of reversible dementia is extremely difficult due to the complicated biopsychological systems and the hard-to-define collection of factors associated with cognitive decline. \nRoughly, the etiological factors that contribute to cognitive decline could be assigned into four categories: chemical, environmental, physical, and psychiatric. Chemical intoxication might be attributed to anesthesia, alcohol, heavy metal and commonly used medications. Jenike (1988) has recorded a certain amount of medications which may induce cognitive change in elder people.\nThe list is provided below.\nEnvironmental sources include overstimulation, radical changes in lifestyle, and sensory impairment. Physical disorders which are mostly induced by the aging process, consist of thyroid and other endocrine-system deprivation; metabolic disturbance, and vitamin deficiency. Psychiatric disorders, such as chronic schizophrenia and depression could also produce cognitive decline.\n\nIn summary, the etiological factors of reversible dementia are various, subtle and frequently interactive. Therefore, in-depth medical and psychosocial evaluations are vital for accurate diagnosis and treatment design. It is important for families and patients to understand the difficulties in determining an correct diagnosis and be prepared for probable frustration and confusion during evaluation and assessment process.\n\nAs certain of pseudodementia remains potentially treatable, it is essential that they are distinguished from primarily dementia of the Alzheimer's type (DAT), and multi-infarct dementia (MID). For instance, pseudodementia associated with depression (DD) has been found as the most frequently appearing, while as many as 10% to 20% patients are misdiagnosed as primary degenerative dementia (PDD) or vice versa. A significant overlapping in cognitive and neuropsychological dysfunction in DD and PDD patients seemed to increase the difficulty in diagnosis. However, differences in the severity of impairment and quality of patients' responses could be observed, and DD patients exhibited a greater depressive symptomatology. Additionally, a test of antisaccadic movements may be used to differentiate DD from PDD patients. as PDD patients significantly display poorer performance on this test. A general comparison between aspects of DD and PDD is shown below.\nIn general, pseudodementia patients present a considerable cognitive deficits, including disorders in learning, memory and psychomotor performance. Substantial evidences from brain imaging such as CT scanning and positron emission tomography (PET) have also revealed abnormalities in brain structure and function.\n\nSince the term of \"reversible\" has been used, it simply implies a high possibility of recovery from the disease. Cunha (1990) examined the recovery process of 26 patients with reversible dementia. Unfortunately, only 2 patients have found as return to normal function indicated by the MMSE scores. Poor results have also been reported in Copeland et al. (1992)'s studies, as 1 out of 21 DD patients had fully recovered. Thus, attention should be arisen that the diagnosis of reversible or pseudodementia needs to be given with extreme care, and the recovery pattern for individual patient remains uncertain.\n"}

Dolgov died while carrying out a high-altitude parachute jump from a Volga balloon gondola.\n\nDolgov was born into a family of farmers in the village of Bogoyavlenskoye (now Dolgovo) in Zemetchinsky District, Penza Oblast. He served with the Soviet airborne in World War II. In January 1945, Dolgov became a company commander in the 350th Guards Rifle Regiment of the 114th Guards Rifle Division. Dolgov participated in the Budapest Offensive and the Vienna Offensive. On 6 April, Dolgov reportedly knocked out a self-propelled gun and killed 40 German soldiers. He was wounded but allegedly refused to leave the battlefield. Dolgov graduated from the Ryazan Higher Airborne Command School in 1947.\n\nHe reportedly designed the ejection seats for the Vostok spacecraft.\n\nOn 1 November 1962, Dolgov and Eugene Andreyev ascended in a Volga balloon gondola from Volsk, near Saratov, to make high-altitude parachute jumps. Andreyev successfully completed his jump. Dolgov, testing an experimental pressure suit, jumped at 28,640 meters (93,970 ft). The helmet visor of Dolgov's pressure suit hit part of the gondola as he exited, and the suit depressurized, killing him. On 12 December 1962, Dolgov was posthumously named a Hero of the Soviet Union.\n\nIf Dolgov's jump had been successful, he still would not have exceeded the record set by Joseph Kittinger for the highest-altitude parachute jump in history (31,300 meters, 16 August 1960). The current world record is held by Alan Eustace (41,425 meters, 24 October 2014).\n\nAt the time of Dolgov's death, the Soviet Army newspaper \"Red Star\" announced that he had died in the course of \"carrying out his duties\". Over the years there have been false reports that Dolgov actually died on 11 October 1960, in a failed flight of a Vostok spacecraft.\n\nA fictionalized version of Dolgov's death (incorrectly dated in February 1961) appears in the short story \"The Chief Designer\" by Andy Duncan, which was published in \"Asimov's Science Fiction\" magazine and was a Hugo finalist.\n\n"}

{"id": "1802673", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1802673", "title": "Roadside memorial", "text": "Roadside memorial\n\nA roadside memorial is a marker that usually commemorates a site where a person died suddenly and unexpectedly, away from home. Unlike a grave site headstone, which marks where a body is laid, the memorial marks the last place on earth where a person was alive – although in the past travelers were, out of necessity, often buried where they fell.\n\nUsually the memorial is created and maintained by family members or friends of the person who died. A common type of memorial is simply a bunch of flowers, real or plastic, taped to street furniture or a tree trunk. A handwritten message, personal mementos, etc. may be included. More sophisticated memorials may be a memorial cross, ghost bike, or a plaque with an inscription, decorated with flowers or wreaths.\n\nRoadside memorials tend to be clustered along the busiest roadways and often times at intersections. This is evident when examining the clustering of tribute sites on a map such as this one showing how many sites are along US 30 in northern Indiana.\n\nRoadside memorials are a statement of grief and love from the loved ones of the accident victim(s).\n\nBut apart from their personal significance, these memorials also serve as a reminder and warning to other road users of the dangers of driving, and to encourage safer driving. In the 1940s and 1950s, the Arizona State Highway Patrol began using white crosses to mark the site of fatal car accidents. This practice was continued by families of road-crash victims after it had been abandoned by the police. The ghost bike phenomenon, where an old bicycle is painted white and locked up at an accident site, serves the same purpose in relation to cycling casualties. Some tribute sites include elaborate displays to memorialize the personality of the person to whom the tribute site is dedicated, including action figures and lights.\n\nHistorically, roadside memorials were personal memorials, but there is a modern trend toward public memorials of increasingly large size. Typically little or no effort is made to make the memorials accommodate the natural beauty of the landscape and many roadside memorials, over time, lack proper maintenance.\n\nThe phenomenon of roadside memorials may be associated with another growing trend: public outpouring of grief for celebrities. The death of Diana, Princess of Wales, for example, precipitated an avalanche of flowers and wreaths at the Pont de l'Alma road tunnel in Paris, the site of her death, and at Kensington Palace, her home in London. While car-crash victims are rarely so well known, something of the same sort of impulse to make a public display of emotion at the site of a tragedy may be partly responsible for the growing popularity of roadside memorials. The broad phenomenon of creating improvised and temporary memorials after traumatic death (accidents, murder, disasters etc.) has become popular since the 1980s. Because of their non-institutionalized character they are generically coined as grassroots memorials.\n\nRoadside memorials have been erected around the world for centuries. Their legality varies from country to country. A web site has been created in order to preserve in a more permanent manner the physical roadside tributes in a virtual manner. This helps to preserve in a longer term manner the original beauty of the tribute site that tends to degrade over time without regular maintenance. It also provides a means of creating a virtual tribute site for those who haven't yet built a physical memorial at the accident scene.\n\nThe number of memorials erected in Australia since 1990 has increased considerably. In 2003, it was estimated that one in five road deaths were memorialized at the site of the crash.\n\nIt is traditional in Ukraine to place a roadside memorial on the site of a deadly car or motorcycle crash. It is usually a cross or a small monument with a wreath of flowers. There are also usually fresh flowers regularly placed by the cross if the relatives of the person who died live close enough to look after the memorial. Sometimes Ukrainian roadside memorials can be more elaborate, including a small granite or marble gravestone and/or a picture of the loved one.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the practice of erecting roadside memorials has recently generated a media debate about the danger these memorials may pose to other road users and to people erecting them in unsafe places. This debate has been sparked by accounts of dangerous actions, such as when an adult crosses a main road with a child to place a tribute. Some jurisdictions already enforce local regulations, and police officials and local councilors have suggested that uniform rules be introduced across the country. For example, according to the BBC, in Merthyr Tydfil, memorials will only be allowed where it is deemed safe and appropriate, and they will be removed after three months.\n\nThe spread of spontaneous roadside memorials to mark the site of fatal traffic accidents in the United States is a relatively new phenomenon. There is a gravestone-style memorial in Ellington, CT marking a child's death in 1812. A typical memorial includes a cross (usually wooden), flowers, hand-painted signs, and, in the case of a child's death, stuffed animals. \n\nThe spread of roadside memorials in the United States has increased in recent decades as a result of large immigrant populations from Mexico entering the country . And while not limited to Mexican populations, roadside memorials are most common in areas with large Mexican populations. Formerly, in funerary processions where a group would proceed from a church to a graveyard carrying a coffin, the bearers would take a rest, or \"descanso\" in Spanish, and wherever they set the coffin down, a cross would be placed there in memory of the event. The modern practice of roadside shrines commemorate the last place a person was alive before receiving fatal injuries, even if they should actually die in a hospital after the crash.\n\nIn the southwestern United States, they are also common at historic parajes on old long distance trails, going back to the roots of the tradition, and also marked the graves of people who died while traveling. A descanso memorial may be decorated especially for the holidays, and for significant anniversaries in the person's life. A descanso memorial for a child may be decorated with special toys, even toy vignettes of family life, and votive candles may be placed there on special nights.\n\nIn the United States, the legal situation varies from state to state.\n\nIn New Mexico, Department of Transportation crews undertaking new construction are not required to protect them, but usually either avoid altering them, or otherwise place them as close to where they originally were as possible once construction has been completed as a courtesy.\n\nIn California, Streets and Highways Code Section 101.10 directs the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) to place and maintain memorial signs along state highways that read “Please Don't Drink and Drive” followed by “In Memory of {victim's name}.” Caltrans places signs at the request of victims’ relatives when there is a fatality as a result of an alcohol or drug-impaired driver. The signs are to remain in place for a period of seven years. The department shall charge the requesting party a fee to cover the department’s cost in designing, constructing, placing, and maintaining that sign, and the department’s costs in administering this section.\n\nThe states of Colorado, Massachusetts, Kentucky, and Wisconsin ban such memorials.\n\nIn the state of Delaware, roadside memorials are illegal per the Clear Zone Act for safety reasons. As an alternative to roadside memorials, the Delaware Highway Memorial Garden located at the Smyrna Rest Area consists of a path with bricks bearing the names of people who died along roads in Delaware. Other states impose specific requirements for roadside memorials.\nIn Birmingham, Alabama, roadside memorials have been removed from Interstate highways. Some people view unauthorized street memorials as illegal and think they constitute the taking of public property for private purposes, and are also a distraction and therefore dangerous to the motoring public. Others think they serve as a sort of public service announcement that reminds drivers to be careful and drive safely, and are no more distracting than any other roadside advertisement. For anyone but those close to the death, they may do little but clutter the landscape. If the memorial is located on a road that the loved ones seldom or never travel, or in a remote area, it may be seen as a form of grandstanding.\n\nUsing a Christian cross as a memorial along a public highway can be seen as an illegal endorsement of religion and has been challenged in a growing number of lawsuits by secular groups concerned about the separation of church and state. On 18 August 2010 the Tenth Circuit held that the State of Utah violated the Establishment Clause by constructing a series of 12-foot high Latin crosses along the roadside to memorialize fallen state troopers. In Lake Elsinore California, a personal roadside cross was removed following a complaint by the American Humanist Association.\n\n\n"}

It is a logarithmic graph starting not directly from ingestion, but from 4 hours post ingestion after absorption is considered likely to be complete.\n\nIn hands of skilled clinicians this nomogram allows for timely management of acetaminophen overdose. Generally, a serum plasma concentration (APAP) of 140–150 microgram/mL (or milligrams/L) at 4 hours post ingestion, indicates the need for NAC treatment. This nomogram is not used alone if the patient has altered mental status or if the history is not reliable. Rather, a second level should be drawn and plotted to see if the slope of the line remains at or above the nomogram. A formal half life may also be determined. Measure at time upon admission of the patient to the emergency department, and a blood value at time (t=4 hrs) should be obtained and half-life calculated. If half-life is more than 4 hours, then treatment is necessary to prevent hepatotoxicity and liver failure.\n\nThe original line starting at 200 microgram/mL at 4 hours was published in 1975 by Rumack BH. and Matthew H. When the NAC study was begun in 1976, the FDA required a line that was 25% below the original line now called the treatment line. The study line which is now referred to as the treatment line was created starting at 150 at 4 hours and is the usual line used in the United States to determine treatment of acetaminophen overdose. This was published in 1981.\n"}

Although both sphincter and detrusor muscles are stimulated at the same time, the slower contraction kinetics of the bladder wall (smooth muscle tissue) compared to the sphincter (striated muscle tissue) mean that voiding occurs between the stimulation pulses, rather than during them.\n\nThis device is implanted over the sacral anterior root of the spinal cord; controlled by an external transmitter, it delivers intermittent stimulation which improves the ability to empty the bladder. It may also assist in defecation and also may enable male patients to have a sustained full erection. The device is implanted in one of two regions, either through intrathecal administration or extradurally. It is often performed in conjunction with a dorsal rhizotomy, and many groups believe that the best results are only seen when this procedure is performed alongside the implantation. The rhizotomy will remove sensory reflexes, which in men may include sexual reflexes. For some patients this is a major drawback to the device. For others, the benefits outweigh the downside.\nThe related procedure of sacral nerve stimulation is to control incontinence in otherwise able-bodied patients.\n"}
{"id": "6413973", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6413973", "title": "Secular spirituality", "text": "Secular spirituality\n\nSecular spirituality is the adherence to a spiritual philosophy without adherence to a religion. Secular spirituality emphasizes the personal development of the individual, rather than a relationship with the divine. Secular spirituality is made up of the search for meaning outside of a religious institution; it considers one's relationship with the self, others, nature, and whatever else one considers to be the ultimate. Often, the goal of secular spirituality is living happily and/or helping others.\n\nAccording to Robert C. Solomon, an American Professor of Philosophy, \"spirituality is coextensive with religion and it is not incompatible with or opposed to science or the scientific outlook. Naturalized spirituality is spirituality without any need for the 'other‐worldly'. Spirituality is one of the goals, perhaps the ultimate goal, of philosophy.\" Cornel W Du Toit, head of the Research Institute for Theology and Religion at the University of South Africa, suggests secular spirituality is unique in that it adapts so well to modern world views, and is therefore compatible with other modern beliefs and ways of life, building community through shared experiences of \"awe\". Peter Van der Veer also argues an important aspect of secular spirituality is its promotion of community, creating solidarity through shared universal truth. This 'universal truth' can be experienced through a secular or non-religious world view, without the need for a concept of 'higher power' or a 'supernatural being'.\n\nInstances of secular spirituality are mediated differently, as instances of awe can be encouraged through a diversity of unique environments and situations. In the 21st century, individuals increasingly connect with the secularly spiritual through technology. As follows, the connection between contemporary spiritual practices and technology is deepening profoundly. Some traditionally religious practices have been adapted by secular practitioners under strictly spiritual understandings, such as yoga and mindfulness meditation. Secular spirituality affects education, relationships to nature, and community togetherness.\n\nSecular spirituality emphasizes humanistic qualities such as love, compassion, patience, forgiveness, responsibility, harmony and a concern for others. Du Toit argues aspects of life and human experience which go beyond a purely materialistic view of the world are spiritual; spirituality does not require belief in a supernatural reality or divine being. Mindfulness and meditation can be practiced in order to cherish, foster, and promote the development of one's empathy and manage selfish drivers of behavior, with solicitude and forgiveness. This can be experienced as beneficial, or even necessary for human fulfillment, without any supernatural interpretation or explanation. Spirituality in this context may be a matter of nurturing thoughts, emotions, words and actions that are in harmony with a belief that everything in the universe is mutually dependent. Scholar Daniel Dennett suggests spirituality as connected to \"awe and joy and sense of peace and wonder,\" explaining \"people make a mistake of thinking spirituality... has anything to do with either religious doctrines... or the supernatural,\" instead claiming spirituality can be and is often entirely secular.. However critics suggest that because 'secular spirituality' does not reference theistic, supernatural or any 'other-worldly' constructs it cannot be truly considered spirituality — without some non-ordinary /supernatural element, the dissenters argue that spirituality boils down to being nothing more than a synonym for humanism.\n\nCornel W Du Toit is a professor at the University of South Africa, who completed his studies at the Institute for Theology and Missiology. Du Toit defines \"secular spirituality\" as a contemporary phenomenon of spirituality experienced in spheres separate from structured, institutionalized religion. Du Toit cites Alister E. McGrath's definition of spirituality in his discussion of the secularly spiritual, arguing that spirituality generally concerns: \"the quest for a fulfilled and authentic life, involving the bringing together of the ideas distinctive of ... [some] religion and the whole experience of living on the basis of and within the scope of that religion.\" Du Toit argues that, as a contemporary phenomenon, secular spirituality is different than earlier spiritualities. A number of changes in prevailing worldviews have affected the concept of spirituality. The concept of spirituality means something different in the current techno-scientific world than it did in a world of phantoms, magic, gods, and demons, in which humans believed themselves to be at the mercy of forces they could not control. Du Toit believes that the increase in scientific explanations for what were previously seen as spiritual, \"unexplainable\" instances of awe, has increased individuals' tendency to call any experience that seems special \"spiritual.\" Du Toit argues that any realm can evoke an experience of spirituality whether it may be reading a novel, watching a movie or going on a hike.\n\nSecular spirituality is not a new religion, but rather the potential for all experiences to assume a spiritual quality, not limited to any one religious or transcendent realm. Du Toit argues that industrialism has led to an increase in materialism in the West. Du Toit further argues that materialism has contributed to a more individualistic Western culture, which underpins secularism. In saying this, though Du Toit connects secularism to individualism, Du Toit maintains that secular spirituality is inherently communal, as he argues that while instances of awe can be experienced individually, they ultimately contribute to the collective – as these instances of awe can motivate people to influence others and nature. Du Toit argues that if they do not meaningfully contribute to the collective, they can not be considered secular spiritual experiences. Du Toit argues that \"the spiritual experiences was never an end in itself... [as] any spirituality that does not produce service is false.\n\nPeter Van der Veer suggests secular spirituality began with the emphasis on forming group identities, both national and political, and the need for these communities to share a spiritual identity. For Van der Veer, secular spirituality arose in communities through the simultaneous rise of secularism and spirituality, as well as their interaction in the context of nineteenth century globalization. He identifies spirituality, the secular, and religion as three interacting but independent concepts that create frameworks for different systems of belief. For Van der Veer the combination of the spiritual and the secular allows the bridging of discursive traditions in the global-historical context which preserves identities of the communities who share spiritual beliefs across national boundaries.\n\nVan der Veer suggests the phenomenon of secular spirituality develops as many different expressions of belief because of the inconsistent integration of spirituality into secular society within social, market and political spaces. Secular spirituality reflects individualism and self-reflexivity through forming group identities outside of a modern geopolitical context. Secular spirituality does not imply rejecting modern ideas of liberalism, socialism or science, but instead exists as a parallel reading of the discourse with contemporary society. For Van der Veer, secular spirituality uses these contemporary ideas to create communities of individuals who have a shared secular interest written into their system of awesome belief. Van der Veer identifies the use of these contemporary ideas to create communities of individuals who share secular interests in a system of awesome belief as instances of secular spirituality.\n\nKim Knott focuses specifically on the secular sacred, in her discussion of secular spirituality. More specifically, Knott focuses on the possibility of experiencing the sacred outside the context of institutionalized religion. She believes that the sacred functions both within and outside of a theological context through the beliefs of individual persons. Knott deconstructs the common conceptional separation of the sacred from the profane. She argues that the concept of religion should not be conflated with the concept of the sacred, and that the concept of the secular should not be conflated with the concept of the profane. Throughout the enlightenment this separation between religion and the spiritual has occurred, as wilderness sites, marshes, coves, and other sites have been called sacred or spiritual places, without having religious influence or belonging to a religion. In this understanding the sacred is based in nature as these sacred sites serve in an individuals spatial sacred experience. This is how Knott breaks down the sacred experience, as it is achieved through the individuals embodiment, spatiality, and the awareness of ones the body and the spaces inside and around it. As these the sacred as the basis of the sacred as it becomes an operative connection within boundary crossing situations taking place inside and outside the human body and the inhabited territory.\n\nReligions and religious movements have strong online presence, which are often sorted into two categories: \"religion-online\" and \"online-religion.\" As coined by Christopher Helland, \"religion-online\" is understood as \"importing traditional forms of religion online\", while \"online-religion\" is uniquely secularly spiritual, in that it \"[creates] new forms of networked spiritual interactions,\" promoting discussions of ritual and 'awe'-filled moments within a secular, online community. Because of the Internet's ability to \"cross social and cultural borders\", Helland argues that this has created \"non-threatening environment\" that is ideal for anonymous users to engage in \"spiritual searching.\" Online spiritual discussion outside of the aegis of any particular religious movement is often thought to have begun with and have been most influenced by \"Communitree\", a \"California-based online social networking system\". The \"Origins\" board on Communitree promoted \"open-ended forms of religious discussion\", resulting in an unofficial \"set of religious and quasi-religious beliefs and practices that is not accepted, recognized or controlled by official religious groups.\" Scholars often associate Communitree with personal religiosity and individualized spirituality, as this entirely secular platform allowed for conversation to occur without a \"set doctrine, code of ethics or group of religious professionals to regulate belief and practices\". Outside of Communitree, the Internet contains countless forums, websites, and messaging systems. These platforms allow for information regarding spiritual ideas to be accessed, and connections to be made between those who are offering or seeking spiritual advice.\n\nA defining feature of secular spirituality is that instances of secular spirituality can occur in any realm. In the present techno-scientific age, spiritual practices are increasingly mediated through technology. For many religious people, technology can be seen as an alienating force – \"the encapsulation of human rationality\" – that competes with religion and spirituality as opposed to mediating or facilitating religion and spirituality. The recognition of a spiritual dimension of technology represents a recent shift in the discussion. According to philosopher Jay Newman, \"technology's very success is contributing to the realization of ideals such as freedom, knowledge, happiness, and peace.\" This may lead people to believe that \"technology is a proper successor to religion\", but this is certainly not the case in sociological trends. General levels of religiosity in the West have barely declined since the Enlightenment period. The current \"attribution of spiritual meaning to the digital realm\" represents a remarkable change in how spirituality has traditionally been mediated. Secular spirituality is a phenomenon that recognizes the link between technology and spirituality, as opposed to viewing technology as in competition with spirituality.\n\nThe popularity of the 'Yoga' in the West is integrally linked to secularization. This secularization began in India in the 1930s, when yoga teachers began to look for ways to make yoga accessible to the general public who did not have the opportunity to practice yoga as part of the Hindu faith. As such, yoga began to move from the realm of religion to the realm of secularity, promoting Yoga as a non-Hindu practice both within the West and East. Yoga has undeniably Hindu roots, first mentioned in the \"Katha Upanisad.\" Despite these roots, yoga has been secularized, and often referred to as being \"ancient Indian,\" \"Eastern,\" or \"Sanskritic,\" rather than as Hindu due to a desire to avoid any religious connotations. Modern Western yoga is thought to \"not require adoption of religious beliefs or dogma,\" despite Hindu origins. In the West, yoga has been \"modernized, medicalized, and transformed into a system of physical culture\". This system of physical culture has transformed yoga \"into an individualized spirituality of the self\", creating an activity that is very popular within secular societies, drawing off portrayals of yoga as \"mystical, experiential and individualistic.\" Western yoga students cite health, fitness, and stress reduction as reasons for yogic practice, rather than traditional Hindu motivations and goals such as enlightenment. However, many practice in order to reach \"contemplative states of consciousness and spirituality\", a goal that falls within the realm of secular spirituality. In a study of Ashram residents, researchers found residents were more likely to respond they had an \"experience of oneness\" during or after a yoga class and felt more \"in touch with divine or spiritual\" after a class than control groups, leaving researchers to believe yoga practice enhances transformational processes, including spiritual states.\n\nWhile meditation is traditionally considered a component of Buddhism, mindfulness meditation has become a way to exercise secular spirituality, particularly in the West. Meditation is considered a \"spiritual alternative\" to conventional values and goals, such as those found in traditional Western religions. Mindfulness-based stress reduction, while traditionally linked to the Buddhist understanding of Samadhi, has become medicalized in the secular aim of reducing illness, rather than the traditional Buddhist goal of liberation from the suffering that occurs in worldly experiences. As such, this medicalized, secularized version of meditation has been allowed into secular institutions within Western society, such as hospitals and schools. Research done at Bowling Green State University has shown that mindfulness practitioners who identify as spiritual, as opposed to non-spiritual, benefit more fully from mindfulness practice, and more significantly decreasing their anxiety, increasing the positivity of their moods and increasing their ability to tolerate pain. The Dalai Lama has promoted global exportation of meditation as a \"human practice,\" rather than strictly religious. As such, the secular nature of meditation \"for the goal of universal human benefit\" is emphasized, allowing for secular, spiritual but non-religious participation. An additional human benefit occurring as a result of meditative practice is a sense of community between practitioners. While meditation is entirely individual, it also relies on and creates social connection, building community through shared spirituality despite secular contexts.\n\nMarisa Crawford points to the importance of including secular spirituality in the Canadian curriculum. Crawford argues that a push for a secular public education system deprives students of the opportunity to explore life's \"ultimate questions of heart and soul.\" Crawford believes that there is a way to integrate spirituality into the secular sphere without indoctrination. She advocates allowing students to investigate how individuals and cultures have addressed spiritual concerns and issues. Public schools in Canada generally exclude the spiritual or transcendent dimension of human life from their explanation of religion and have thus bought into a brand of secularism that has excluded spirituality, giving students the false impression that spirituality has never been an important part of the human experience. Crawford argues that the deflection of students' questions about religion or spirituality is commonplace and contributes to misunderstandings and ignorance about religion and spirituality.\n\nAccording to Crawford, knowledge about religion and spirituality is essential for understanding and living in a pluralistic society. While textbooks include explanations of the rituals and practices of certain religious groups, textbooks rarely discuss religion's role in shaping human thought and action. In British Columbia, the School Act states that public schools must be conducted on \"strictly secular and non-sectarian principles,\" thereby alienating young people to \"questions that both enliven and vex the human spirit.\" Lois Sweet argues that \"public schools must begin to examine ways to include the spiritual dimension of human existence in a non-indoctrinating way,\" by teaching worldviews that are sensitive to religious differences and by emphasizing the features of religion and spirituality that overlap. Sweet points to the fact that the requirement for secularism in Canadian public schools simply signals the need for \"educational decisions and policies, whatever their motivation, to respect the multiplicity of religious and moral views that are held by families in the school community,\" not to ignore their discussion.\n\nAccording to a UNESCO report on education: \"It is thus education's noble task to encourage each and every one, acting in accordance with their traditions and convictions and paying full respect to pluralism, to lift their minds and spirits to the plane of the universal and, in some measure, to transcend themselves.\" According to Crawford, excluding religion from the curriculum endorses a passive hostility towards all religious points of view. According to Thomas Groome, by nurturing a sacramental cosmology – an awareness that each aspect of life manifests visible signs of invisible grace – educators can promote an attitude of reverence and gratitude for the world. He argues that doing so can encourage students to \"bring light to the thousands of wonders and transcendent signals in the ordinary things of life ...contemplating the world with a gaze of faith that encourages seeking meaning and celebrating instances of awe.\" Through integrating a sacramental cosmology into the Canadian Public Education system, Groome argues that students will have more opportunities to understand and appreciate the web of humanity – including love, friendship, and \"the intricate and consistent designs and patterns of science ... leading to contemplative wonder that is rooted in compassionate and loving relationships that embrace meaningful knowing.\" Crawford argues that the curriculum will have to avoid promoting one particular religious or irreligious point of view. The curriculum would have to introduce students to a diversity of worldviews and spiritual options \"allowing them critical access to alternative traditions so that informed insight and wisdom may flourish through the development of spiritual literacy.\"\n\n Nurse and researcher Kathleen Fischer notes that nature is a common context for a secular spiritual experience. In her view, individuals can foster a connection to the sacred through experiencing nature with an openness to joy and wonder. According to Fischer, spirituality is the broader reality, the search for meaning and purpose for those who long to discover a deeper dimension to their lives. She characterizes spiritual experience as being rooted in the feeling of awe in nature, which, in her words, may be inspired by sensing \"the intricacy, majesty, and beauty of creation: the delicate mist that arises from the spray of a waterfall, a hummingbird hovering at a flowering bush, white beaches bordering turquoise waters.\" Fischer's work is intended to affirm that not only that the lives of human beings, but all aspects of nature, are filled with a sacred mystery or power. In Fischer's own experience, the sacred power of spirituality has deepened and extended her spiritual practices, such as meditation or deep reflection to maintain strong mental wellbeing.\n\nThrough researching Aboriginal Australian groups, Vicki Grieve's has begun using research on their spiritual lives as a method for analyzing and interpreting the contemporary development of Australian Aboriginal groups. Australian Aboriginal spirituality while diverse seems to attend to similar themes on the sacredness of nature that is seen in Fischer's work. Australian Aboriginals are often taught that life is a sacred hoop in which everything has a place. All elements of nature, whether plants, animals, or insects, should be treated with the same respect as humans. Grieves believes that Aboriginal Australian spiritualities deep connection to nature builds a strong community belief system which has the potential to unite all living beings. Through researching Australian Aboriginal spirituality Grieves has noted how \"spirituality stems from a philosophy that establishes the wholistic notion of the interconnectedness of the elements of the earth and the universe, animate and inanimate.\" As part of her research, Grieves conducted a focus group with an inter-city contemporary Aboriginal group in Australia to better understand the impact spirituality has on their lives. This inter-city group described spirituality as a feeling of interconnectedness to their people's past, of community and a connectedness with land and nature. It is through spirituality that these inter-city aboriginals attained \"knowledge, inner strength, and a better understanding of their cultural roots\" contributing to feelings of \"acceptance, balance and focus\" as well as an overall sense of \"deep wellbeing\".\n\nChicano spirituality is a form of Mexicanism; a nationalist spiritual ideology that developed in Mexico and the Southern United States in the 1960s as a response to political and cultural mistreatment by both Mexican and American law. Chicano spirituality uses a combination of rituals from the Mexica, popular Catholic traditions, and secular Mexican traditions to forge an identity for the Chicano people. Chicanos understand their identity to be that of an independent ethnic minority in between Indigenous and Hispanic people, as such blending secular ethnic positionality with a variety of spiritual traditions. The Chicano identify as heirs to the Aztec lineage, and use this genealogy to justify their demands for territory and recognition in civil rights. Aztlán is the imagined territory that is the centre of the Anhuac tribes of whom the Chicano claim to be descendants. Aztlán is identified by the Chicano as the first settlement of the Anhuac people in North America before their southern migration to found the Aztec Empire. Chicano spiritual practice includes the celebration of Mexican civic holidays, and uniquely Chicano-Mexicanist rites of passage. One ritual, called Xilonen, is a rite of passage celebrated by fifteen-year-old Chicano girls that symbolically teaches them the place of women in the social order and in families.\n\nIn the context of the modern Chicano movement, the Chicano identity is used to transcend the modern national boundaries of Mexico and the United States as a distinct population. The territory of Atzlán allows the Chicano to justify their separation from other ethnic and cultural groups in these countries by providing them with Aztec ancestors, and a historical connection to territory in what is now the southern United States. The idea of the Aztlán homeland is imaginary, but supported by factors in pre-Hispanic history, allows the Chicano to more firmly stake their position to be recognized as a form of secular spirituality occurring in communities in both Mexico and the United States that desires political recognition of their minority identity as a tool to engage in contemporary society.\n\nThe three main arguments that the Chicano use in their fight for a distinct political identity are that the origin of the Chicano ancestors, the Nahua tribes were in North America, that until 1848 the modern national boundaries between Mexico and the United States were not set, and that there is a history of transient Mexican workers in the United States. By claiming a historical link to territory in both countries, the Chicano distinguish themselves as developing a cultural identity separate from either. Chicano spirituality is a combination of American and Mexican encounters with modern politics of human rights.\n\nEnglish rhetorician I.A. Richards has argued that the lack of a word for \"spirituality\" in Sanskrit makes it possible for the concept to be used in a nationalist capacity that transcends individual traditions. Mohandas Gandhi's principle in establishing Indian National Spirituality was that each person could discover a universal truth in the Indian struggle with British colonialism. His vision of Indian National Spirituality transcended the bounds of individual religious traditions, to enact a shared nationalist fervour in the fight for independence. Gandhi's Indian National Spirituality was an adaption of Hindu tradition in light of Western thought proposed an independent India to operate within. Gandhi used the Hindu principle of \"Sarva Dharma Sambhava\" which argues that all religions are equal as a way to invite participation of minority communities in his vision of a politically independent India. Gandhi's national spirituality relied on the entire population of India presenting themselves as a united front against colonialism. After the Lucknow Pact of 1916 Gandhi was forced as an act of Indian congress to give separate political representation to Muslims, and later to Sikhs. Gandhi felt that separating them from the political whole was a \"vivisection\" of Indian National spirituality as formed a shared ideology for fight for Indian Nationalism.\n\nIn addition to arguing for religious equality in India, Gandhi's ideology called for the equality of humankind, a secularly spiritual demand based on peace and kindness for the betterment of all. He believed that Indian National Spirituality would allow the East to be an example to the West in promoting national communities tied by belief. Gandhi saw the endemic oppression of the Dalit or untouchable population by the caste system of Hinduism as a heinous institution. He promoted embracing the Dalit population as also being \"Harijan\" or children of God, and the British programs implemented to raise Dalit status through educational and employment opportunity programs.\n\nGandhi's proposed universalist national spiritual identity for India faced criticism by both religious and secular nationalist groups. Hindu Nationalists opposed an all-encompassing spiritual tradition that accepted Muslims. They believed that being forced to share an identity with a group of the population that they saw as foreign would be another form of colonial emasculation.\n\nAnother response to the universalism of Indian National Spirituality as proposed by Gandhi was by B. R. Ambedkar in the fight for the Dalit. Ambedkar criticized the use of Hinduism as a basis for a universal spirituality because of the implied inequality of the embedded caste system. He saw the lack of mobility between castes and the systematic oppression of the Dalits, the lowest caste in the Hindu system, as necessitating a political separation from their oppressors in a contemporary Indian legal situation. Ambedkar believed that the community of the Dalit had to divorce itself from Hindu tradition in order to escape caste based oppression, explaining that Dalit problem \"would never be solved unless [the Dalit] got political power in their own hands.\" Ambedkar's method for achieving the goals of the Dalit meant that their identity needed to be reimagined as secular, separate from the Hindu caste system.\n\nAmbedkar used conversion to Buddhism as a means to promote the Dalit cause through a different spiritual framework than Gandhi's Indian National Spirituality. In 1956 Ambedkar and a number of his Dalit followers converted from Hinduism to Buddhism. The conversion was symbolic shift for the untouchable community to escape the implications of the Hindu caste system on the Dalit population in a secular realm. The tradition of Buddhism was seen by Ambedkar as \"a guide for right relations between man and man in all spheres of life,\" embodying the egalitarian character missing from Indian society. He hoped that converting the Dalit population to a religion that lacked a caste system would help to create a situation in which they had equal human rights in India as a minority group. Ambedkar's interpretation of Buddhism was based on a secular and this-worldly reading, wherein suffering was defined as the oppression of one culture by another, and freedom from suffering, and nirvana defined as righteous behaviour on earth between all people.\n\n"}

The St Lawrence Ground was built around the tree, which was located within the boundary ropes. As a result of the St Lawrence Ground being the only first-class ground with a tree in the playing area, special laws were enacted regarding the tree. These laws may have been instigated pre-1910 where a Hampshire County Cricket Club batsman was claimed to be caught by a Kent County Cricket Club fielder off the tree. The laws stated that if the ball hit the tree, it was scored as a four even if it would have gone on to score six otherwise and no batsman could be caught out from a rebound off the tree. It was viewed as a challenge to hit a ball over the tree; only four batsmen, Arthur Watson, Learie Constantine, Jim Smith and Carl Hooper, managed to do so.\n\nIn 1999, the St Lawrence Lime was diagnosed with heartwood fungus and given an expected lifespan of 10 years despite pollarding aimed to promote growth. In preparation, a replacement \"Tilia\" sapling was planted at the St Lawrence Ground by E. W. Swanton. Weakened by the fungus, the trunk of the tree was broken in two by high winds on 8 January 2005, leaving a stump. Kent initially planned to use the replacement to take the place of the St Lawrence Lime and had permission from the Marylebone Cricket Club to do so. However, because the replacement was still small and was deemed unable to take a cricket ball and being less visible to players, it was planted in the playing area outside the boundary ropes instead of inside to take the place of the St Lawrence Lime in a ceremony including Chris Cowdrey.\n"}
{"id": "3570630", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3570630", "title": "Svatantrya", "text": "Svatantrya\n\nSvātantrya (from the Sanskrit \"sva\" meaning \"self\" and \"tantram\" meaning \"dependence\" – 'self-dependency', or 'free will') is the Kashmiri Shaivite concept of divine sovereignty. \"Svātantrya\" is described as an energy that emanates from the Supreme (\"Paramaśiva\"), a wave of motion inside consciousness (\"spanda\") that acts as the fundament of the world, or in another view, the original word (logos, pārāvak). It does not use any external instrument as it itself is the first stage of creation.\n\nIn antithesis with the Vedantic concept of Brahman, which is a mere conscious witness without effective power, being inflicted by the illusory power (or \"maya\" of the Brahman), in the Kashmiri Shaivite viewpoint creation is actively willed into existence by the supreme consciousness (\"Śiva\") by the means of his irresistible will-force (\"Svātantrya\"). This is an important aspect of the Pratyabhijna school of \"Kashmir Shaivism\".\n\n\"Svātantrya\" is a concept that goes to the root of many spiritual matters in Kashmir Shaivism, like, the divine sovereignty of \"Śiva\" (God), consciousness (\"caitanya\"), creative power (\"vimarśa\"), mantric efficiency and \"Kundalini\".\n\nIn its acception of divine sovereignty, \"svātantrya\" is described as an absolute power of action, or, absolute power of freedom. This power arises from the mirror-like ability of the supreme consciousness (\"caitanya\") to contain images (\"vimarśa\") – the whole universe being a mere image shining inside this unique god-consciousness.\n\n\"Svātantrya\" has a number of traditional attributes such as: perfect fullness (of the energy of will), self-sufficiency, autodetermination, the power of doing and undoing – essence of the subject, supreme creativity, sovereignty, source of knowledge (\"jñāna\") and action (\"kriyā\") and being beyond contradictions: it exists beyond laws of any kind and is the source of all laws in the universe.\n\nThe Kashmir Shaivism theory of creation affirms that the world was willed into existence by the sovereign force of \"Śiva\". Thus, the world has no external causes outside \"Śiva's Svātantrya\". This power creates multiplicity (\"māyā\") from the original unity of the absolute, and as such, it exists inside and beyond \"māyā\". It is the seed of the universe, the matrix (\"mātrkā\") of generative phonemes, the ultimate creative force.\n\nDisclaimer: on this topic there is a certain amount of melding and unification of the seemingly distinct concepts of will, freedom, consciousness, speech and bliss in the speciality texts. This is due to the insufficient ability of common language to describe the mystical states of consciousness.\n\nThe \"prakāśa-vimarśa\" theory affirms the world is based on two principles: the self shining conscious light (\"prakāśa\") and its ability to contain a reflection of itself and of the creation (\"vimarśa\"). To reflect itself is to know absolute bliss (\"ānanda\") – thus, free will (\"svātantrya\"), conscious reflection (\"vimarśa\") and bliss (\"ānanda\") are three concepts describing the same reality. Bliss (\"ānanda\") is the internal state of consciousness, its natural state. The same is true of svātantrya: it too is a fundamental quality of the subject.\n\nSvātantrya is the first stage of creation, an undifferentiated energy, or, looking from bottom up, we could also say that it is the force that unifies all the energies of creation The first creation of \"svātantrya\" is the energy of will (\"icchā śakti\"). Then come the energies of knowledge (\"jñāna śakti\") and action (\"kriyā śakti\") and together with the energy of consciousness (\"cit śakti\") and the energy of bliss (\"ānanda śakti\") they form the supreme pentad of creation, the so-called \"pure creation\".\n\nEverything related to consciousness is also related to \"svātantrya\". Speech is seen in Kashmir Shaivism as differentiated in four classes : external (\"vaikharī\"), mental (\"madhyamā\"), subtle (\"paśyanti\") and supreme (\"parā\"). \"Svātantrya\" is equated to \"pārāvak\", the creative logos / \"logos spermatikos\".\n\nIn the mystical practices of Kashmir Shaivism, \"svātantrya\" is both the sovereign will of \"Śiva\", solely deciding the descent of divine grace (\"śaktipāt\") and the will of the adept as he becomes more and more submerged into the divine.\n\nAccording to Kashmir Shaivism, spiritual realization is more than a state of illumination (defined as \"pure witness\", \"non-dual consciousness\" or \"atma-vyapti\"). Full spiritual realization means to know bliss (\"ānanda\") and to control the energies (\"śakti\") and the mantras (or, the so-called \"śiva-vyāpti\"). The root of spiritual efficiency is \"svātantrya\", the operative, dynamic aspect of the absolute.\n\nAn adept who reaches spiritual illumination needs to learn how to stabilize his experience. The Kashmir Shaivism scriptures declare that stability is based on the assimilation of the energy of \"svātantrya\". Thus, while the incipient practitioner aims for the experience of the nondual consciousness, the advanced ones focus on the assimilation of all the energies into non-duality. \"Svātantrya\" being the root of all energies, it becomes automatically the final step of the spiritual practice.\n\nThe will of such an advanced practitioner becomes more and more efficient as it identifies with the will of \"Śiva\". Yet, his actions are necessarily without base in egoism (without the attributes of good or bad) – and this is an attitude that defines the discipline of karma yoga.\n\nAll the spiritual paths (\"upāyas\"): that of Śiva (\"śāmbhavopāya\"), that of Śakti (\"śāktopāya\") and that of the man (\"āṇavopāya\") are subsumed under the umbrella of \"svātantrya\" as it is the sole mediator of divine grace. The adept who has attained \"svātantrya\" is beyond the need for formal meditation – that is – for him to meditate or to act in everyday life is identical – he does all his actions from a state of perfect unity with \"Śiva\" from now on. This is the culmination of the Kashmiri Shaivite spiritual practice. Such an adept does not exert himself in maintaining this state of consciousness because it is his own nature. From his point of view, everything is made of just forms of consciousness, his own consciousness, also identified with the consciousness of \"Śiva\" at this stage. The energy he possesses is the risen form of Kundalini. His mantras have spiritual efficacy. His heart (\"hṛdaya\") is the receptacle of all objects.\n\nKashmir Shaivism doctrine affirms that nothing can compel \"Śiva\" to bestow the final spiritual realization – it is solely based on the unconditioned \"svātantrya\", or, from the opposite perspective, there is no obstacle that can separate the disciple from becoming one with \"Śiva\" because he has \"svātantrya\" which is the ultimate power that cannot be impeded by anything. Thus, in Kashmir Shaivism there is this paradoxical concept that nothing needs to be done, as the supreme realization can appear without effort, but also, no matter what effort one undergoes, he cannot compel \"Śiva\" to liberate his self (\"ātman\"). Yet, this is not an invitation to abandon hard work but a justification for humility.\n\nIn a meditation prescribed in Vijñana Bhairava Tantra, one is supposed to unite his vital energy (\"prāṇa\") with \"svātantrya\" in the mystical force center that exists 12 finger widths above the head, \"dvadaśānta\".\n\n\"Svātantrya\" has a number of synonyms such as: \"maheśvaraya\" (from maheśvara which means supreme lord), or \"aiśvarya\" (similarly, from the word Iśvara which also means Lord). It has been personalized as the Goddess (\"Devi\"), the virginal feminine deity \"Uma\" (virginity being a symbol of existence outside the reach of the profane world) and the playful goddess \"Kumārī\". Other scriptures also refer to \"svātantrya\" as the \"Glory of Siva\" on account of it being identical to the 'ocean' of uncreated light (\"prakāśa\") and cosmic bliss (\"ānanda\") – \"cidānanda-Ghana\".\n"}

It recounts the attempt to ascertain the origin of a lampshade claimed to be made out of human skin.\n\nIn the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, a lampshade, purported to be made from the skin of a Jewish Holocaust victim, turned up in a sidewalk rummage sale in New Orleans. Purchased for $35 by Skip Henderson, the lampshade was sent to his friend Mark Jacobson, a writer living in New York. Jacobson embarked on a quest to discover the origin of the lampshade. Genetic testing initially confirmed it was made from human skin. However, because of the condition of the tanned skin, there was no way to determine the ethnic origin of the person whose skin was used, or if it was indeed a relic of the Holocaust.\n\nOver the course of the next few years, Jacobson attempted to track down the origin of and examine the meaning of the lampshade, how it ended up in New Orleans, and to decide what to ultimately do with the gruesome object. Both the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, D.C., and the Yad Vashem museum in Jerusalem, declined to take possession of the lampshade, saying that the concentration camp lampshades made of human skin were probably a \"myth\". Over the course of his investigation, Jacobson examines the history of the Buchenwald concentration camp, where such objects were reputed to have been made, as well as the racial and post-Katrina history of New Orleans, the world of Holocaust deniers, the black market trafficking in such goods, and the mythology surrounding objects made from human skin.\n\nIn 2012 the lampshade was subjected to more sophisticated next-generation DNA testing and was found to be most likely cow skin.\n"}
{"id": "38082", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=38082", "title": "Viking program", "text": "Viking program\n\nThe Viking program consisted of a pair of American space probes sent to Mars, \"Viking 1\" and \"Viking 2\". Each spacecraft was composed of two main parts: an orbiter designed to photograph the surface of Mars from orbit, and a lander designed to study the planet from the surface. The orbiters also served as communication relays for the landers once they touched down.\n\nThe Viking program grew from NASA's earlier, even more ambitious, Voyager Mars program, which was not related to the successful Voyager deep space probes of the late 1970s. \"Viking 1\" was launched on August 20, 1975, and the second craft, \"Viking 2\", was launched on September 9, 1975, both riding atop Titan IIIE rockets with Centaur upper stages. \"Viking 1\" entered Mars orbit on June 19, 1976, with \"Viking 2\" following suit on August 7.\n\nAfter orbiting Mars for more than a month and returning images used for landing site selection, the orbiters and landers detached; the landers then entered the Martian atmosphere and soft-landed at the sites that had been chosen. The \"Viking 1\" lander touched down on the surface of Mars on July 20, 1976, and was joined by the \"Viking 2\" lander on September 3. The orbiters continued imaging and performing other scientific operations from orbit while the landers deployed instruments on the surface.\n\nThe project cost roughly 1 billion USD in 1970s dollars, equivalent to about billion USD in dollars. The mission was considered successful and is credited with helping to form most of the body of knowledge about Mars through the late 1990s and early 2000s.\n\n\nThe primary objectives of the two Viking orbiters were to transport the landers to Mars, perform reconnaissance to locate and certify landing sites, act as communications relays for the landers, and to perform their own scientific investigations. Each orbiter, based on the earlier Mariner 9 spacecraft, was an octagon approximately 2.5 m across. The fully fueled orbiter-lander pair had a mass of 3527 kg. After separation and landing, the lander had a mass of about and the orbiter The total launch mass was of which were propellant and attitude control gas. The eight faces of the ring-like structure were 0.4572 m high and were alternately 1.397 and 0.508 m wide. The overall height was 3.29 m from the lander attachment points on the bottom to the launch vehicle attachment points on top. There were 16 modular compartments, 3 on each of the 4 long faces and one on each short face. Four solar panel wings extended from the axis of the orbiter, the distance from tip to tip of two oppositely extended solar panels was 9.75 m.\n\nThe main propulsion unit was mounted above the orbiter bus. Propulsion was furnished by a bipropellant (monomethylhydrazine and nitrogen tetroxide) liquid-fueled rocket engine which could be gimballed up to 9 degrees. The engine was capable of thrust, translating to a change in velocity of 1480 m/s. Attitude control was achieved by 12 small compressed-nitrogen jets.\n\nAn acquisition Sun sensor, a cruise Sun sensor, a Canopus star tracker and an inertial reference unit consisting of six gyroscopes allowed three-axis stabilization. Two accelerometers were also on board. Communications were accomplished through a S-band (2.3 GHz) transmitter and two TWTAs. An X band downlink was also added specifically for radio science and to conduct communications experiments. Uplink was via S band A two-axis steerable parabolic dish antenna with a diameter of approximately 1.5 m was attached at one edge of the orbiter base, and a fixed low-gain antenna extended from the top of the bus. Two tape recorders were each capable of storing 1280 megabits. A 381-MHz relay radio was also available.\n\nThe power to the two orbiter craft was provided by eight 1.57 × 1.23 m solar panels, two on each wing. The solar panels comprised a total of 34,800 solar cells and produced 620 W of power at Mars. Power was also stored in two nickel-cadmium 30-A·h batteries.\n\nThe combined area of the four panels was , and they provided both regulated and unregulated direct current power; unregulated power was provided to the radio transmitter and the lander.\n\nTwo 30-amp-hour, nickel-cadmium, rechargeable batteries provided power when the spacecraft was not facing the Sun, and during launch, correction maneuvers and Mars occultation.\n\nBy discovering many geological forms that are typically formed from large amounts of water, the images from the orbiters caused a revolution in our ideas about water on Mars. Huge river valleys were found in many areas. They showed that floods of water broke through dams, carved deep valleys, eroded grooves into bedrock, and travelled thousands of kilometers. Large areas in the southern hemisphere contained branched stream networks, suggesting that rain once fell. The flanks of some volcanoes are believed to have been exposed to rainfall because they resemble those caused on Hawaiian volcanoes. Many craters look as if the impactor fell into mud. When they were formed, ice in the soil may have melted, turned the ground into mud, then flowed across the surface. Normally, material from an impact goes up, then down. It does not flow across the surface, going around obstacles, as it does on some Martian craters. Regions, called \"Chaotic Terrain,\" seemed to have quickly lost great volumes of water, causing large channels to be formed. The amount of water involved was estimated to ten thousand times the flow of the Mississippi River. Underground volcanism may have melted frozen ice; the water then flowed away and the ground collapsed to leave chaotic terrain.\n\nEach lander comprised a six-sided aluminium base with alternate long sides, supported on three extended legs attached to the shorter sides. The leg footpads formed the vertices of an equilateral triangle with sides when viewed from above, with the long sides of the base forming a straight line with the two adjoining footpads. Instrumentation was attached inside and on top of the base, elevated above the surface by the extended legs.\n\nEach lander was enclosed in an aeroshell heat shield designed to slow the lander down during the entry phase. To prevent contamination of Mars by Earth organisms, each lander, upon assembly and enclosure within the aeroshell, was enclosed in a pressurized \"bioshield\" and then sterilized at a temperature of for 40 hours. For thermal reasons, the cap of the bioshield was jettisoned after the Centaur upper stage powered the Viking orbiter/lander combination out of Earth orbit.\nEach lander arrived at Mars attached to the orbiter. The assembly orbited Mars many times before the lander was released and separated from the orbiter for descent to the surface. Descent comprised four distinct phases, starting with a deorbit burn. The lander then experienced atmospheric entry with peak heating occurring a few seconds after the start of frictional heating with the Martian atmosphere. At an altitude of about and traveling at a velocity of 900 kilometers per hour (600 mph), the parachute deployed, the aeroshell released and the lander's legs unfolded. At an altitude of about 1.5 kilometers (5,000 feet), the lander activated its three retro-engines and was released from the parachute. The lander then immediately used retrorockets to slow and control its descent, with a soft landing on the surface of Mars.\n\nPropulsion for deorbit was provided by the monopropellant hydrazine (NH), through a rocket with 12 nozzles arranged in four clusters of three that provided thrust, translating to a change in velocity of . These nozzles also acted as the control thrusters for translation and rotation of the lander.\n\nTerminal descent (after use of a parachute) and landing utilized three (one affixed on each long side of the base, separated by 120 degrees) monopropellant hydrazine engines. The engines had 18 nozzles to disperse the exhaust and minimize effects on the ground, and were throttleable from . The hydrazine was purified in order to prevent contamination of the Martian surface with Earth microbes. The lander carried of propellant at launch, contained in two spherical titanium tanks mounted on opposite sides of the lander beneath the RTG windscreens, giving a total launch mass of . Control was achieved through the use of an inertial reference unit, four gyros, a radar altimeter, a terminal descent and landing radar, and the control thrusters.\n\nPower was provided by two radioisotope thermoelectric generator (RTG) units containing plutonium-238 affixed to opposite sides of the lander base and covered by wind screens. Each generator was tall, in diameter, had a mass of and provided 30 watts continuous power at 4.4 volts. Four wet cell sealed nickel-cadmium 8 ampere-hours (28,800 coulombs), 28 volts rechargeable batteries were also on board to handle peak power loads.\n\nCommunications were accomplished through a 20-watt S-band transmitter using two traveling-wave tubes. A two-axis steerable high-gain parabolic antenna was mounted on a boom near one edge of the lander base. An omnidirectional low-gain S-band antenna also extended from the base. Both these antennae allowed for communication directly with the Earth, permitting Viking 1 to continue to work long after both orbiters had failed. A UHF antenna provided a one-way relay to the orbiter using a 30 watt relay radio. Data storage was on a 40-Mbit tape recorder, and the lander computer had a 6000-word memory for command instructions.\n\nThe lander carried instruments to achieve the primary scientific objectives of the lander mission: to study the biology, chemical composition (organic and inorganic), meteorology, seismology, magnetic properties, appearance, and physical properties of the Martian surface and atmosphere. Two 360-degree cylindrical scan cameras were mounted near one long side of the base. From the center of this side extended the sampler arm, with a collector head, temperature sensor, and magnet on the end. A meteorology boom, holding temperature, wind direction, and wind velocity sensors extended out and up from the top of one of the lander legs. A seismometer, magnet and camera test targets, and magnifying mirror are mounted opposite the cameras, near the high-gain antenna. An interior environmentally controlled compartment held the biology experiment and the gas chromatograph mass spectrometer. The X-ray fluorescence spectrometer was also mounted within the structure. A pressure sensor was attached under the lander body. The scientific payload had a total mass of approximately .\n\nThe Viking landers conducted biological experiments designed to detect life in the Martian soil (if it existed) with experiments designed by three separate teams, under the direction of chief scientist Gerald Soffen of NASA. One experiment turned positive for the detection of metabolism (current life), but based on the results of the other two experiments that failed to reveal any organic molecules in the soil, most scientists became convinced that the positive results were likely caused by non-biological chemical reactions from highly oxidizing soil conditions.\nAlthough there is consensus that the Viking lander results demonstrated a lack of biosignatures in soils at the two landing sites, the test results and their limitations are still under assessment. The validity of the positive 'Labeled Release' (LR) results hinged entirely on the absence of an oxidative agent in the Martian soil, but one was later discovered by the Phoenix lander in the form of perchlorate salts. It has been proposed that organic compounds could have been present in the soil analyzed by both \"Viking 1\" and \"Viking 2\", but remained unnoticed due to the presence of perchlorate, as detected by Phoenix in 2008. Researchers found that perchlorate will destroy organics when heated and will produce chloromethane and dichloromethane, the identical chlorine compounds discovered by both Viking landers when they performed the same tests on Mars.\n\nThe question of microbial life on Mars remains unresolved. Nonetheless, on April 12, 2012, an international team of scientists reported studies, based on mathematical speculation through complexity analysis of the Labeled Release experiments of the 1976 Viking Mission, that may suggest the detection of \"extant microbial life on Mars.\"\n\nThe leader of the imaging team was Thomas Mutch, a geologist at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island. The camera uses a movable mirror to illumate 12 photo diodes. Each of the 12 silicon diodes are designed to be sensitive to different frequences of light. Several diodes are placed to focus accurately at distances between six and 43 feet away from the lander.\n\nThe cameras scanned at a rate of five vertical scan lines per second, each composed of 512 pixels. The 300 degree panorama images were composed of 9150 lines. The cameras scan was slow enough that in a crew shot several members show up several times in the shot as they moved themselves as the camera scanned.\n\nThe Viking landers used a Guidance, Control and Sequencing Computer (GCSC) consisting of two Honeywell HDC 402 24-bit computers with 18K of plated-wire memory, while the Viking orbiters used a Command Computer Subsystem (CCS) using two custom-designed 18-bit serial processors.\n\nThe two orbiters cost 217 million USD (at the time), which is about billion USD in year-dollars. The most expensive single part of the program was the lander's life-detection unit, which cost about 60 million then or million USD in year-dollars. Development of the Viking lander design cost 357 million USD. This was decades before \"faster, better, cheaper\", Viking needed to pioneer never before imagined technologies under the pressure of national prestige pulled by the Global Cold War conflict and a Space race, not to mention a possibility they might discover extraterrestrial life for the first time (it would only be after the mission, with results created by Viking that such an idea rang less plausible). The experiments had to adhere to a special 1971 directive that mandated that no single failure shall stop the return of more than one experimenta difficult and expensive task for a device with over 40,000 parts.\n\nThe Viking camera system cost 27.3 million USD to develop, or about million in year-dollars. When the Imaging system design was completed, it was difficult to find anyone who could manufacture it so advanced. The program managers were later praised for fending off pressure to go with a simpler, less advanced imaging system, especially when the views rolled in. The program did save some money by cutting out a third lander and reducing the number of experiments on the lander.\n\nOverall NASA says that US$1 billion in 1970s dollars was spent on the program, which when inflation-adjusted to dollars is about billion USD.\n\nThe craft eventually failed, one by one, as follows:\n\nThe Viking program ended on May 21, 1983. To prevent an imminent impact with Mars the orbit of \"Viking 1\" orbiter was raised on August 7, 1980 before it was shut down 10 days later. Impact and potential contamination on the planet's surface is possible from 2019 onwards. It's unknown if the \"Viking 2\" orbiter's orbit was also raised to prevent an impact.\n\nThe \"Viking 1\" lander was found to be about 6 kilometers from its planned landing site by the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter in December 2006.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "12600412", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12600412", "title": "Viva Piñata: Pocket Paradise", "text": "Viva Piñata: Pocket Paradise\n\nViva Piñata: Pocket Paradise is a life simulation game developed by Rare, for the Nintendo DS video game console and based on \"Viva Piñata\".\n\nIt was developed by Rare's handheld team, as opposed to \"\" and the PC version of the original game, which were developed by separate third-party developers.\n\n\"Viva Piñata: Pocket Paradise\" is, like its predecessor, a sandbox game that tasks the player with turning a neglected plot of land into a beautiful garden. The game retains the majority of features and all of the piñata from the original. As the game was built from the ground up for the \"DS\", Rare’s handheld team took the opportunity to add additional features and changes.\n\nThe most obvious difference between \"Pocket Paradise\" and the original is that the entire game is controlled using the stylus, giving the player a very direct, intuitive method of interacting with their garden. It is now possible to simply ‘draw’ grass onto soil, or double tap a flower to remove its head.\n\nThe game also makes use of the two screens on the DS where, for the majority of the game, the main garden view is displayed in the lower screen of the DS. In the upper screen, there is a context sensitive information panel that is unique to this version of the game. The information that is displayed dynamically changes to reflect what is currently selected - ranging from an individual piñata's romance requirements to a percentage breakdown of the garden's floor tiles. It is even possible to swap the screens around and interact with the information panel, to view a comprehensive piñata encyclopedia, a journal, an awards page and a piñata pyramid (amongst other things).\n\nOther than control changes, there is a handful of design changes that are unique to this version of the game. First off, it is no longer possible to buy fertiliser or romance sweets. Fertiliser (which is now accessed via the main tools pallet) is only produced when a Taffly is made to interact with a piece of fruit - the colour of the fruit dictates the colour of the fertiliser. Romance sweets are now earned by completing Viva Piñata Central challenges, putting much more emphasis on what was originally a purely optional aspect of the game. Another major difference between the DS version and the original is the addition of an overhead map that not only enables the player to view the whereabouts of their piñata instantly, but allows them to zoom in on any pinata by simply tapping their icon.\n\nA new game mode has also been added that mirrors the \"Just for fun\" mode in \"\", named “Playground”. This is a no-pressure version of the main game (set on a beach) where young or inexperienced players can experiment without having to deal with the challenging aspects of the game, such as Dastardos or Ruffians, or having to pay for items.\n\nRare explains on their website that \"you'll also be given free rein with an expanded selection of tools and tool actions, upgraded forms of the Journal and Encyclopedia... and Episodes (tying in more closely to the TV series and allowing fans of the show to spend quality time with familiar faces).\" They also state that “DS wireless connectivity... lets you send prime Piñata specimens to your friends, making the act of parading your Doenut around in a humiliating pirate outfit easier than ever.\"\n\nBack in 2005, Electronic Gaming Monthly reported that Rare was hard at work on two projects for the Nintendo DS. Their first Nintendo DS game released was \"Diddy Kong Racing DS\", so that game and \"Viva Piñata\" were most likely the two projects mentioned.\n\n\"Viva Piñata\" for the Nintendo DS was first hinted at in an interview between Microsoft Game Studios and 1UP.com at the DICE 2007 Summit in Las Vegas.\n\nThe game was announced later at Comic-Con 2007 and on May 13, 2008 THQ officially announced the release of \"Viva Piñata: Pocket Paradise\" in the Fall of 2008. On May 22, 2008 Rare opened a dedicated \"Viva Piñata: Pocket Paradise\" section on their website.\n\nIn a May 2008 interview with members from the team, the question \"Was it always the plan to transfer Viva Piñata across to the DS, or did it take some prompting?\" received the response \"In discussions for a follow-on project for \"DKR DS\" it became a greater focal point, and in hindsight, seeing what we came up with, it's proven to be a complete no-brainer. We love it.\" from the game's producer, Paul Machacek.\n\n\"Viva Piñata: Pocket Paradise\" won the award for Best Simulation Game for the Nintendo DS from IGN in their 2008 video game awards.\n\"Viva Piñata: Pocket Paradise\" also received a pair of 2009 BAFTA nominations for Best Strategy Game at the Game Awards and Best Video Game at the Children's Awards.\n\n"}

Perhaps most famed for her act in 722, when she destroyed the stronghold of Taunton (which had been built by Ine) in an attempt to find the rebel Ealdbert.\n\nÆthelburg was born circa 673. She was the wife of King Ine of Wessex. Æthelburg is considered by some historians to be one of the few Anglo-Saxon women warriors. In 722, Æthelburg burned down the city of Taunton, a city built by Ine, to avoid its destruction by enemies. In 726 King Ine of Wessex abdicated the throne, and, with Æthelburg, went to Rome.\n\nÆthelburg of Wessex is sometimes confused with Æthelburg of Kent, the wife of Edwin of Northumbria, who founded the Lyminge monastery in Kent. Æthelburg is a featured figure on Judy Chicago's installation piece \"The Dinner Party\", being represented as one of the 999 names on the \"Heritage Floor.\n\nIn \"The Dinner Party\" the character Æthelburg is actually a combination of Æthelburg of Wessex and Æthelburg of Kent.\n\n\n"}
