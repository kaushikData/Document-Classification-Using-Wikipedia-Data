He is also the son of the famous Qurayshite statesmen, Suhayl ibn Amr and brother of Abu Jandal ibn Suhayl.\n\nAbdullah ibn Suhayl was born in approximately 594 and was the son of Suhayl ibn Amr from Banu Amir branch. His mother, Atika bint Awf was from Banu Amir also. \n\nAbdullah had become a Muslim before the Battle of Badr, but did not have a way to join the Muslims in Medina. Leaving Mecca and being openly Muslim was difficult for Abdullah because of the powerful influence of his father and his esteemed place in Quraysh. Abdullah concocted a plan to switch sides and join forces with the Muslims at Badr. He rode to Badr with the rest of the pagan Quraysh and his father and waited until the two forces camped close enough to each other that they were both within eyesight of each other. With the Muslim camp so close, Abdullah escaped to the side of Muhammad and fought alongside them the next day.\n\nHis relatively early conversion to Islam and his participation in the Battle of Badr as a Muslim places him in the esteemed position of the Sahabah. He is said to have emigrated to Ethiopia in the first migration. Abdullah ibn Suhayl also participated in the Battle of Uhud, the Battle of the Trench, and the Battle of Yamama.\n\nAbdullah was killed at the Battle of Yamama at 38 years old in 632 CE. His brother in law, Abu Hudhayfa ibn 'Utba, adopted nephew, Salim Mawla Abu Hudhayfa, and second cousin, Zayd ibn al-Khattab were killed seconds after him. After his death, Khalid ibn al-Walid said that he had fulfilled his duty and that God's messenger was proud of him when he died. He was mourned deeply by his brother, Abu Jandal ibn Suhayl and his father, Suhayl ibn Amr. His father would sometimes pray to Allah to grant mercy and to bestow his grace to Abdullah.\n"}

Son of a Neustrian noble named Betto, he was a first cousin of Audoin and related to the Faronids and Agilolfings, and less certainly to the Merovingians. His name, the Frankish language equivalent of Æthelberht, has been taken to suggest a link with the royal family of the Kingdom of Kent.\n\nAgilbert was consecrated as a bishop in Francia before he travelled to Britain. He arrived in the West Saxon kingdom after the return to power of King Cenwalh of Wessex, who had been driven out by Penda of Mercia, either in the late 640s or 650s. He was appointed to succeed Birinus as bishop of the West Saxons, or Bishop of Dorchester. Agilbert, according to Bede's \"Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum\", had \"spent a long time in Ireland for the purpose of studying the Scriptures\". His appointment was due to Cenwalh.\n\nFrom Bede, it appears that Agilbert did not speak Old English, and it is said that his see was divided in two, with Wine being given half, because King Cenwalh \"tired of his barbarous speech\", although this may be mistaken. This insult supposedly led to Agilbert's resignation. He then travelled north to Northumbria, where he ordained Wilfrid. He was present at the Synod of Whitby in 664, where he led the pro-Roman party, but he had the young Wilfrid speak on his behalf.\n\nReturning to Francia, Agilbert later took part in Wilfrid's consecration as a bishop at Compiègne. Agilbert became bishop of Paris between 666 and 668, and hosted Theodore of Tarsus. He was later invited to return by Cenwalh, to become bishop of Winchester, but sent his nephew Leuthhere in his place.\n\nOne modern historian, D. P. Kirby, is unsure if Agilbert actually went to Northumbria after being expelled from Dorchester, suggesting it is just as likely that he went directly to the continent.\n\nAgilbert died at some time after 10 March 673, on which date he witnessed Clotilde's foundation charter for the Abbey of Bruyères-le-Châtel, and probably between 679 and 690. He was buried at Jouarre Abbey where his sister Theodechildis was abbess. His fine sculpted sarcophagus can be seen there in the crypts, as can that of his sister.\n"}

Alexander III was also the grandson of William the Lion. Alexander's father died on 8 July 1249 and he became king at the age of seven, inaugurated at Scone on 13 July 1249.\n\nThe years of his minority featured an embittered struggle for the control of affairs between two rival parties, the one led by Walter Comyn, Earl of Menteith, the other by Alan Durward, Justiciar of Scotia. The former dominated the early years of Alexander's reign. At the marriage of Alexander to Margaret of England in 1251, Henry III of England seized the opportunity to demand from his son-in-law homage for the Scottish kingdom, but Alexander did not comply. In 1255 an interview between the English and Scottish kings at Kelso led to Menteith and his party losing to Durward's party. But though disgraced, they still retained great influence, and two years later, seizing the person of the king, they compelled their rivals to consent to the erection of a regency representative of both parties.\n\nOn attaining his majority at the age of 21 in 1262, Alexander declared his intention of resuming the projects on the Western Isles which the death of his father thirteen years before had cut short. He laid a formal claim before the Norwegian king Haakon. Haakon rejected the claim, and in the following year responded with a formidable invasion. Sailing around the west coast of Scotland he halted off the Isle of Arran, and negotiations commenced. Alexander artfully prolonged the talks until the autumn storms should begin. At length Haakon, weary of delay, attacked, only to encounter a terrific storm which greatly damaged his ships. The Battle of Largs (October 1263) proved indecisive, but even so, Haakon's position was hopeless. Baffled, he turned homewards, but died in Orkney on 15 December 1263. The Isles now lay at Alexander's feet, and in 1266 Haakon's successor concluded the Treaty of Perth by which he ceded the Isle of Man and the Western Isles to Scotland in return for a monetary payment. Norway retained only Orkney and Shetland in the area.\n\nAlexander had married Margaret (his 4th cousin by Henry I of England), daughter of King Henry III of England and Eleanor of Provence, on 25 December 1251. She died in 1275, after they had had three children.\n\nAccording to the Lanercost Chronicle, Alexander did not spend his decade as a widower alone: \"he used never to forbear on account of season nor storm, nor for perils of flood or rocky cliffs, but would visit none too creditably nuns or matrons, virgins or widows as the fancy seized him, sometimes in disguise.\"\n\nTowards the end of Alexander's reign, the death of all three of his children within a few years made the question of the succession one of pressing importance. In 1284 he induced the Estates to recognize as his heir-presumptive his granddaughter Margaret, the \"Maid of Norway\". The need for a male heir led him to contract a second marriage to Yolande de Dreux on 1 November 1285.\n\nAlexander died in a fall from his horse while riding in the dark to visit the queen at Kinghorn in Fife on 18 March 1286 because it was her birthday the next day. He had spent the evening at Edinburgh Castle celebrating his second marriage and overseeing a meeting with royal advisors. He was advised by them not to make the journey to Fife because of weather conditions, but he travelled anyway. Alexander became separated from his guides and it is assumed that in the dark his horse lost its footing. The 44-year-old king was found dead on the shore the following morning with a broken neck. Some texts have said that he fell off a cliff. Although there is no cliff at the site where his body was found, there is a very steep rocky embankment, which \"would have been fatal in the dark.\" After Alexander's death, his strong realm was plunged into a period of darkness that would eventually lead to war with England. He was buried in Dunfermline Abbey.\n\nAs Alexander left no surviving children, the heir to the throne was his unborn child by Queen Yolande. When Yolande's pregnancy ended, probably with a miscarriage, Alexander's seven-year-old granddaughter Margaret, Maid of Norway, became the heir. Margaret died, still uncrowned, on her way to Scotland in 1290. The inauguration of John Balliol as king on 30 November 1292 ended the six years of the Guardians of Scotland governing the land.\n\nThe death of Alexander and the subsequent period of instability in Scotland was lamented in an early Scots poem recorded by Andrew of Wyntoun in his Orygynale Cronykil of Scotland.\n\nIn 1886, a monument to Alexander III was erected at the approximate location of his death in Kinghorn.\n\nAlexander III has been depicted in historical novels.

{"id": "1790", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1790", "title": "Alexander Selkirk", "text": "Alexander Selkirk\n\nAlexander Selkirk (167613 December 1721) was a Scottish privateer and Royal Navy officer who spent four years and four months as a castaway (1704–1709) after being marooned by his captain on an uninhabited island in the South Pacific Ocean. He survived that ordeal, but succumbed to tropical illness a dozen years later while serving aboard off West Africa.\n\nSelkirk was an unruly youth, and joined buccaneering voyages to the South Pacific during the War of the Spanish Succession. One such expedition was on \"Cinque Ports\", captained by Thomas Stradling and under the overall command of William Dampier. Stradling's ship stopped to resupply at the uninhabited Juan Fernández Islands, and Selkirk judged correctly that the craft was unseaworthy and asked to be left there.\n\nWhen he was eventually rescued by English privateer Woodes Rogers, in company with Dampier, Selkirk had become adept at hunting and making use of the resources that he found on the island. His story of survival was widely publicised after their return to England, becoming a source of inspiration for writer Daniel Defoe's fictional character Robinson Crusoe.\n\nAlexander Selkirk was the son of a shoemaker and tanner in Lower Largo, Fife, Scotland, born in 1676. In his youth he displayed a quarrelsome and unruly disposition. He was summoned before the Kirk Session in August 1693 for his \"indecent conduct in church\", but he \"did not appear, being gone to sea\". He was back at Largo in 1701 when he again came to the attention of church authorities for assaulting his brothers.\n\nEarly on, he was engaged in buccaneering. In 1703 he joined an expedition of English privateer and explorer William Dampier to the South Pacific Ocean, setting sail from Kinsale in Ireland on 11 September. They carried letters of marque from the Lord High Admiral authorising their armed merchant ships to attack foreign enemies as the War of the Spanish Succession was then going on between England and Spain. Dampier was captain of \"St George\" and Selkirk served on \"Cinque Ports\", \"St George\"s companion ship, as sailing master under Captain Thomas Stradling. By this time, Selkirk must have had considerable experience at sea.\n\nIn February 1704, following a stormy passage around Cape Horn, the privateers fought a long battle with a well-armed French vessel, \"St Joseph\", only to have it escape to warn its Spanish allies of their arrival in the Pacific. A raid on the Panamanian gold mining town of Santa María failed when their landing party was ambushed. The easy capture of \"Asunción\", a heavily laden merchantman, revived the men's hopes of plunder, and Selkirk was put in charge of the prize ship. Dampier took off some much-needed provisions of wine, brandy, sugar and flour; then abruptly set the ship free, arguing that the gain was not worth the effort. In May 1704 Stradling decided to abandon Dampier and strike out on his own.\n\nIn September 1704, after parting ways with Dampier, Captain Stradling brought \"Cinque Ports\" to an island known to the Spanish as Más a Tierra located in the uninhabited Juan Fernández archipelago off the coast of Chile for a mid-expedition restocking of fresh water and supplies.\n\nSelkirk had grave concerns about the seaworthiness of their vessel, and wanted to make the necessary repairs before going any farther. He declared that he would rather stay on Juan Fernández than continue in a dangerously leaky ship. Stradling took him up on the offer and landed Selkirk on the island with a musket, a hatchet, a knife, a cooking pot, a Bible, bedding and some clothes. Selkirk immediately regretted his rashness, but Stradling refused to let him back on board.\n\n\"Cinque Ports\" did indeed later founder off the coast of what is now Colombia. Stradling and some of his crew survived the loss of their ship but were forced to surrender to the Spanish. The survivors were taken to Lima, Peru, where they endured a harsh imprisonment.\n\nAt first, Selkirk remained along the shoreline of Juan Fernández. During this time he ate spiny lobsters and scanned the ocean daily for rescue, suffering all the while from loneliness, misery and remorse. Hordes of raucous sea lions, gathered on the beach for the mating season, eventually drove him to the island's interior. Once inland, his way of life took a turn for the better. More foods were available there: feral goats—introduced by earlier sailors—provided him with meat and milk, while wild turnips, cabbage leaves and dried pepper berries offered him variety and spice. Rats would attack him at night, but he was able to sleep soundly and in safety by domesticating and living near feral cats.\nSelkirk proved resourceful in using materials that he found on the island: he forged a new knife out of barrel hoops left on the beach, he built two huts out of pepper trees, one of which he used for cooking and the other for sleeping, and he employed his musket to hunt goats and his knife to clean their carcasses. As his gunpowder dwindled, he had to chase prey on foot. During one such chase he was badly injured when he tumbled from a cliff, lying helpless and unable to move for about a day. His prey had cushioned his fall, probably sparing him a broken back.\n\nChildhood lessons learned from his father, a tanner, now served him well. For example, when his clothes wore out, he made new ones from hair-covered goatskins using a nail for sewing. As his shoes became unusable, he had no need to replace them, since his toughened, calloused feet made protection unnecessary. He sang psalms and read from the Bible, finding it a comfort in his situation and a prop for his English.\n\nDuring his sojourn on the island two vessels came to anchor. Unfortunately for Selkirk, both were Spanish. As a Scotsman and a privateer, he would have faced a grim fate if captured and therefore did his best to hide himself. Once he was spotted and chased by a group of Spanish sailors from one of the ships. His pursuers urinated beneath the tree in which he was hiding but failed to notice him. The would-be captors then gave up and sailed away.\n\nSelkirk's long-awaited deliverance came on 2 February 1709 by way of \"Duke\", a privateering ship piloted by William Dampier, and its sailing companion \"Duchess\". Thomas Dover led the landing party that met Selkirk. After four years and four months without human company, Selkirk was almost incoherent with joy. The \"Duke\" captain and leader of the expedition was Woodes Rogers, who mischievously referred to Selkirk as the governor of the island. The agile castaway caught two or three goats a day and helped restore the health of Rogers' men, who were suffering from scurvy.\n\nCaptain Rogers was impressed by Selkirk's physical vigour, but also by the peace of mind that he had attained while living on the island, observing: \"One may see that solitude and retirement from the world is not such an insufferable state of life as most men imagine, especially when people are fairly called or thrown into it unavoidably, as this man was.\" He made Selkirk \"Duke\"s second mate, later giving him command of one of their prize ships, \"Increase\", before it was ransomed by the Spanish.\n\nSelkirk returned to privateering with a vengeance. At Guayaquil in present-day Ecuador, he led a boat crew up the Guayas River where a number of wealthy Spanish ladies had fled, and looted the gold and jewels they had hidden inside their clothing. His part in the hunt for treasure galleons along the coast of Mexico resulted in the capture of \"Nuestra Señora de la Encarnación y Desengaño\", renamed \"Bachelor\", on which he served as sailing master under Captain Dover to the Dutch East Indies. Selkirk completed the around-the-world voyage by the Cape of Good Hope as the sailing master of \"Duke\", arriving at the Downs off the English coast on 1 October 1711. He had been away for eight years.\n\nSelkirk's experience as a castaway aroused a great deal of attention in England. Fellow crewmember Edward Cooke mentioned Selkirk's ordeal in a book chronicling their privateering expedition, \"A Voyage to the South Sea and Round the World\" (1712). A more detailed recounting was published by the expedition's leader, Rogers, within months. The following year, prominent essayist Richard Steele wrote an article about him for \"The Englishman\" newspaper. Selkirk appeared set to enjoy a life of ease and celebrity, claiming his share of \"Duke\"'s plundered wealth—about £800 (equivalent to £ today). However, legal disputes made the amount of any payment uncertain.\n\nAfter a few months in London, he began to seem more like his former self again. In September 1713 he was charged with assaulting a shipwright in Bristol and may have been kept in confinement for two years. He returned to Lower Largo, where he met Sophia Bruce, a young dairymaid. They eloped to London early in 1717 but apparently did not marry. He was soon off to sea again, having enlisted in the Royal Navy. While on a visit to Plymouth in 1720, he married a widowed innkeeper named Frances Candis. He was serving as master's mate on board , engaged in an anti-piracy patrol off the west coast of Africa, when he died on 13 December 1721, succumbing to the yellow fever that plagued the voyage. He was buried at sea.\n\nWhen Daniel Defoe published \"The Life and Surprising Adventures of Robinson Crusoe\" (1719), few readers could have missed the resemblance to Selkirk. An illustration on the first page of the novel shows \"a rather melancholy-looking man standing on the shore of an island, gazing inland\", in the words of modern explorer Tim Severin. He is dressed in the familiar hirsute goatskins, his feet and shins bare. Yet Crusoe's island is located not in the mid-latitudes of the South Pacific but away in the Caribbean, where the furry attire would hardly be comfortable in the tropical heat. This incongruity supports the popular belief that Selkirk was a model for the fictional character, though most literary scholars now accept that his was \"just one of many survival narratives that Defoe knew about\".\n\n<poem>:::I am monarch of all I survey,\n\n<poem>:::Oh, Alexander Selkirk knew the plight\n\n<poem>:::These passengers, by reason of their clinging to a mast,\n\n\n\"Selkirk, the Real Robinson Crusoe\" is a stop motion film by Walter Tournier based on Selkirk's life. It premièred simultaneously in Argentina, Chile, and Uruguay on 2 February 2012, distributed by The Walt Disney Company. It was the first full-length animated feature to be produced in Uruguay.\n\nSelkirk has been memorialised in his Scottish birthplace. Lord Aberdeen delivered a speech on 11 December 1885, after which his wife, Lady Aberdeen, unveiled a bronze statue and plaque in memory of Selkirk outside a house on the site of his original home on the Main Street of Lower Largo. David Gillies of Cardy House, Lower Largo, a descendant of the Selkirks, donated the statue created by Thomas Stuart Burnett.\n\nThe Scotsman is also remembered in his former island home. In 1869 the crew of placed a bronze tablet at a spot called Selkirk's Lookout on a mountain of Más a Tierra, Juan Fernández Islands, to mark his stay. On 1 January 1966 Chilean president Eduardo Frei Montalva renamed Más a Tierra Robinson Crusoe Island after Defoe's fictional character to attract tourists. The largest of the Juan Fernández Islands, known as Más Afuera, became Alejandro Selkirk Island, although Selkirk probably never saw that island since it is located to the west.\n\nAn archaeological expedition to the Juan Fernández Islands in February 2005 found part of a nautical instrument that likely belonged to Selkirk. It was \"a fragment of copper alloy identified as being from a pair of navigational dividers\" dating from the early 18th (or late 17th) century. Selkirk is the only person known to have been on the island at that time who is likely to have had dividers, and was even said by Rogers to have had such instruments in his possession. The artefact was discovered while excavating a site not far from Selkirk's Lookout where the famous castaway is believed to have lived.\n\n\n\n"}

It was influenced by his participation in the Paris Commune, the Gnostic philosophy of Georg Hegel as well as the works of Goethe and Victor Hugo. It begins in an occult castle. The Byronic hero Axël meets a Germanic princess. After an initial conflict they fall in love. They speak of the amazing journeys they plan to have. But they realize that life will never measure up to their dreams. They then commit suicide.\n\n\"Axël\" was the work Villiers considered his masterpiece, although critical opinion has often been reluctant to agree with him, placing far higher value on his fiction. Villiers began work on the piece around 1869 and had still not put the finishing touches to it when he died. It was first published posthumously in 1890. The play is heavily influenced by the Romantic theatre of Victor Hugo, as well as Goethe's \"Faust\" and the music dramas of Richard Wagner. The last time it was staged was during the year 2006 in Québec and Montréal, directed by Christian Lapointe.\n\nThe scene is set in Germany in 1828 and opens on Christmas Eve in the convent of Saint Apollodora, where the rich heiress Sara de Maupers is just about to take the veil. But when the archdeacon asks Sara whether she is ready to accept \"light, hope and life\", she replies \"no\". The religious authorities attempt to imprison Sara, but she manages to flee. The rest of the drama takes place in the castle of Axël d'Auersperg, a young nobleman distantly related to Sara. Axël's cousin Kaspar has learnt that a vast treasure is buried near the castle. He tries to persuade Axël to help him look for it but Axël refuses, the two quarrel and Axël kills Kaspar in a duel. In the third act, Axël's Rosicrucian tutor, Master Janus, prepares to initiate Axël into the occult mysteries. He asks his pupil whether he is ready to accept \"light, hope and life\", and Axël replies \"no\". In Act Four, Axël decides to leave the castle forever and goes down to the crypt to say farewell to the tombs of his ancestors. Here he surprises Sara, who has been led to the castle by an old manuscript which tells of the location of the buried treasure. A door opens and the treasure pours out. Axël and Sara fight, then fall in love. They dream of the glorious future the treasure will bring them then declare their dreams are far too magnificent to be fulfilled in everyday, unimaginative reality. They decide to kill themselves and die as the sun rises. The play's most famous line is Axël's \"Vivre? les serviteurs feront cela pour nous\" (\"Living? Our servants will do that for us\"). Edmund Wilson used the title \"Axel's Castle\" for his study of early Modernist literature.\n\n"}

The series finale, \"Chowder Grows Up,\" aired on August 7, 2010.\n\nEach character is named after a type of food or dish. \n\n\nA total of 49 episodes were aired in the series. Season 1, which consists of 20 episodes, started on November 2, 2007, with the series premiere, entitled \"The Froggy Apple Crumble Thumpkin/Chowder's Girlfriend\". Season 1 ended on July 24, 2008, with the special \"The Apprentice Games\". Season 2 also contains 20 episodes, debuting on October 1, 2008, with \"The Arborians/The Garage Sale\", and ending with \"A Faire to Remember/Tofu-Town Showdown\", broadcasting on September 29, 2009, and October 6, 2009, respectively. Season 3 consists of only 9 episodes, premiering October 12, 2009, with \"The Blast Raz\", and ending with the series finale, entitled \"Chowder Grows Up\", which aired on August 7, 2010.\n\nDuring his time working on Nickelodeon's \"SpongeBob SquarePants\", Greenblatt had been sketching various characters for his own animation series concept. Greenblatt originally based the premise on the idea of the sorcerer's apprentice style of story, such as \"The Sword in the Stone\". The plot devices were modified so that the story revolves around a master chef who teaches his young apprentice how to cook. Chowder himself was developed with no specific species in mind, but rather with the intentions of invoking the image of a child's soft squeeze toy. Some of the inspiration comes from Dr. Seuss, with other inspiration from Saturday morning cartoons.\n\nGreenblatt pitched the concept to Cartoon Network, and two years later the series was approved with another year for production before the pilot episode aired. Greenblatt estimates he spent about seven years working on \"Chowder\" before the show made it to air in 2007.\n\nEpisodes are produced in seasons which consist of twenty 24-minute episodes. Each episode is produced with a 30-second puppet sequence that is meant to run over the ending credits. Episodes can be purchased from the iTunes Store in the United States which are delivered with the sequences as are episodes which are available on Cartoon Network's VOD website also within the United States.\n\nOne of the unusual design features of the show is the patterns used on the clothing or players. The patterns are developed as a full-screen image and then sent to the production house, where the characters are modified to fill the patterns in over the character clothing. Using this technique, when a character moves, their patterns do not follow, but display as a \"static\" background. A similar technique was used in the \"Monkey Island\" video game series (particularly for the Stan), the Nickelodeon series The Off-Beats, and the \"Mr. Bean\" animated series.\n\nThe show is also known for the very wide variety of media used in various episodes. These include animation using watercolors and ink-and-paint in addition to the cartoon's classic pattern style. It also uses stop motion animation with real food, action figures and clay; live-action scenes with the voice actors of the show and puppets; both marionette and hand-controlled. This was also sometimes used in \"Courage the Cowardly Dog\". It boasts one of the most diverse varieties of mediums used in any single series.\n\n\"Chowder\" was cancelled by Cartoon Network in August 2010, as the network felt the show did not fit its new demographic of older boys, favoring shows such as the live-action \"Destroy, Build, Destroy\" instead. On his blog, C.H. Greenblatt expressed relief about having his schedule freed up by the cancellation, saying: \"I didn't really think there'd be this many upsides to having a show officially cancelled by a network, but I'm feeling happier than I've been in a long time. Since we've only got post-production, my schedule finally eases up. I haven't had a break like this in a long, long time... \"Chowder\" has opened up a lot of awesome possibilities for me, and creatively I'm feeling more inspired than ever.\" C.H. Greenblatt also noted that many of the staff signed on to a new project at Disney, which would end up being the Disney Channel animated series \"Fish Hooks\", which Greenblatt worked on as an episode director. The cancellation of \"Chowder\" also led to Greenblatt developing a new project for Nickelodeon, \"Bad Seeds\" (later retitled \"Harvey Beaks\").\n\nThe complete series has been released in ten Region 3 fullscreen DVD volumes in Thailand from MVD Company Limited\n\nBarry Garron of \"The Hollywood Reporter\" thought that the show would appeal to children and adults alike, using exotic artwork, unusual settings, and a zany cast of characters. On Toon Zone, Ed Liu expands on the animation and crazy antics of the characters, pointing that \"the humor is kid-friendly without being juvenile\" and praising it for getting laughs, \"without resorting to an excess of toilet humor, even if Chowder's pet happens to be a sentient fart cloud.\" Aaron H. Bynum on \"Animation Insider\" wrote, \"Featuring brightly colored environments, stylishly matted/fixed background artwork and humorously designed characters with unique personalities to boot, \"Chowder\" is one of the network's largest creative accomplishments in recent years.\"\n\n"}
{"id": "296846", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=296846", "title": "Christian mortalism", "text": "Christian mortalism\n\nChristian mortalism incorporates the belief that the human soul is not naturally immortal; and may include the belief that the soul is uncomprehending during the time between bodily death and resurrection, known as the intermediate state. \"Soul sleep\" is an often pejorative term so the more neutral term \"materialism\" was also used in the nineteenth century, and \"Christian mortalism\" since the 1970s.\n\nHistorically the term psychopannychism was also used, despite problems with the etymology and application. The term thnetopsychism has also been used, for example Gordon Campbell (2008) identified Milton as believing in the latter though in fact both \"De doctrina Christiana\" and \"Paradise Lost\" refers to death as \"sleep\" and the dead as being \"raised from sleep\". The difference is difficult to identify in practice.\n\nRelated and contrasting viewpoints of life after death include universal reconciliation, where all souls are immortal (or are mortal, but universally given continuance) and eventually are reconciled, and special salvation, where a positive afterlife is exclusively held by just some souls. Christian mortalism has been taught by several theologians and church organizations throughout history while also facing opposition from aspects of Christian organized religion. The Roman Catholic Church condemned such thinking in the Fifth Council of the Lateran as \"erroneous assertions\". Supporters include the sixteenth-century religious figure Martin Luther and the eighteenth-century religious figure Henry Layton among many others.\n\nSince the phrases \"soul sleep\" or \"soul death\" do not occur either in the Bible or in early Anabaptist materials, an explanation is required for the origin of the term. Additionally several other terms have been introduced relating to the view. Modern theologians have used the term \"Christian mortalism\" and related wordings from the 21st century onwards.\n\nThe phrase \"soul sleep\" appears to have been popularised by John Calvin in the subtitle to his Latin tract \"Psychopannychia\" (, , , ). The title of the booklet comes from Greek \"psyche\" (soul, mind) with \"pan-nychis\" (παν-νυχίς, all-night vigil, all-night banquet), so \"Psychopannychia\", originally, represents Calvin's view; that the soul was conscious, active.\n\nThe title and subtitle of the 1542 Strasbourg 1st edition read: .\n\nThe title and subtitle of the 1545 2nd Latin edition read: .\n\nThe 1558 French edition was a translation of that of the 1545 2nd edition: \n\n\nLuther's use of similar language (but this time defending the view) appears in print only a few years after Calvin:\n\nHistorically, Christian mortalists have advanced theological, lexical, and scientific arguments in support of their position.\n\nSome early eastern Christians argued for mortalism on the basis of the identity of blood with life in Leviticus 17:11. Theological arguments which contended that the continued existence of the soul was not taught in the Bible were made by mortalists such as Francis Blackburne, Joseph Priestley, and Samuel Bourne. Mortalists such as Richard Overton advanced a combination of theological and philosophical arguments in favor of mortalism. Thomas Hobbes likewise made extensive use of theological argumentation. Some mortalists viewed their beliefs as a return to original Christian teaching. Mortalist theological arguments were also used to contest the Roman Catholic doctrine of purgatory and masses for the dead.\n\nIn the late eighteenth century, the standard Hebrew lexicon and grammar of John Parkhurst expressed the view that the traditional rendering of the Hebrew word \"nephesh\" as reference to an immortal soul, had no lexical support. Mortalists in the nineteenth century used lexical arguments to deny the traditional doctrines of hell and the immortal soul.\n\nThe eighteenth-century mortalist Henry Layton presented arguments based on physiology. Scientific arguments became important to the nineteenth-century discussion of mortalism and natural immortality, and mortalist Miles Grant cited extensively from a number of scientists who observed that the immortality of the soul was unsupported by scientific evidence.\n\nThe mortality of the soul has been held throughout the history of both Judaism and Christianity.\n\nAlthough in the Book of Genesis Jacob mentions he would descend into the Sheol where he thought his son Joseph already was and the Witch of Endor summons the ghost of the deceased prophet Samuel at the behest of King Saul, modern scholars believe the concept of an immortal soul going to bliss or torment after death entered mainstream Judaism after the exile and existed throughout the Second Temple era, though both ‘soul sleep’ and ‘soul death’, were also held.\n\nMortalism is present in certain Second Temple Period pseudepigraphal works, later rabbinical works, and among medieval era rabbis such as Abraham Ibn Ezra (1092–1167), Maimonides (1135–1204), and Joseph Albo (1380–1444).\n\nSome authorities within Conservative Judaism, notably Neil Gillman, also support the notion that the souls of the dead are unconscious until the Resurrection.\n\nTraditional rabbinic Judaism, however, has always been of the opinion that belief in immortality of at least most souls, and punishment and reward after death, was a consistent belief back through the giving of the Torah at Mt. Sinai. Traditional Judaism reads the Torah accordingly. As an example, the punishment of kareth (excision) is understood to mean that soul is cut off from God in the Afterlife.\n\nThe earliest unambiguous instance of Christian mortalism is found in Tatian's Address to the Greeks from the second half of the second century. Tatian writes: \"The soul is not in itself immortal... If, indeed, it knows not the truth, it dies, and is dissolved with the body, but rises again at last at the end of the world with the body, receiving death by punishment in immortality. But, again, if it acquires the knowledge of God, it dies not, although for a time it be dissolved.\" Tatian's contemporary Athenagoras of Athens came close to mortalism by teaching that souls sleep dreamlessly between death and resurrection: \"[T]hose who are dead and those who sleep are subject to similar states, as regards at least the stillness and the absence of all sense of the present or the past, or rather of existence itself and their own life.\" However, the best-known case of mortalism in the early church is that recorded by Eusebius of Caesarea:\nThis synod in Arabia would have been during the reign of Emperor Philip the Arab (244–249). Redepenning (1841) was of the opinion that Eusebius' terminology here, \"the human soul dies\" was probably that of their critics rather than the Arabian Christians' own expression and they were more likely simply \"psychopannychists\", believers in \"soul sleep\".\n\nSome Syriac writers such as Aphrahat, Ephrem and Narsai believed in the \"dormition\", or \"sleep\", of the soul, in which \"...souls of the dead...are largely inert, having lapsed into a state of sleep, in which they can only dream of their future reward or punishments.\" John of Damascus denounced the ideas of some Arab Christians as \"thnetopsychism\" (\"soul death\"). Eustratios of Constantinople (after 582) denounced this and what he called \"hypnopsychism\" (\"soul sleep\"). The issue was connected to that of the Intercession of saints. The writings of Christian ascetic Isaac of Nineveh (d. 700), reflect several perspectives which include mortalism.\n\nMortalism evidently persisted since various Byzantine writers had to defend the doctrine of the veneration of saints against those who said the saints sleep. John the Deacon (eleventh century) attacked those who \"dare to say that praying to the saints is like shouting in the ears of the deaf, as if they had drunk from the mythical waters of Oblivion.\"\n\nPope John XXII inadvertently caused the beatific vision controversy (1331–34) by suggesting that the saved do not attain the Beatific Vision, or \"see God\" until Judgment Day (in Italian: \"Visione beatifica differita\", \"deferred beatific vision\"), which was a view possibly consistent with soul sleep. The Sacred College of Cardinals held a consistory on the problem in January 1334, and Pope John conceded to the more orthodox understanding. His successor, in that same year, Pope Benedict XII, declared that the righteous do see Heaven prior to the final judgement. In 1536, Pope Benedict XII issued the papal bull Benedictus Deus. This document defined the Church's belief that the souls of the departed go to their eternal reward immediately after death, as opposed to remaining in a state of unconscious existence until the Last Judgment.\n\nMortalism re-emerged in Christianity when it was promoted by some Reformation leaders, and it survives today mostly among Restorationist sects, such as Seventh-day Adventist Church. Conti has argued that during the Reformation both psychosomnolence (the belief that the soul sleeps until the resurrection) and thnetopsychism (the belief that the body and soul both die and then both rise again) were quite common.\n\nWilliam Tyndale (1494–1536) argued against Thomas More in favour of soul sleep:\nMorey suggests that John Wycliffe (1320–84) and Tyndale taught the doctrine of soul sleep \"as the answer to the Catholic teachings of purgatory and masses for the dead.\"\n\nMany Anabaptists in this period, such as Michael Sattler (1490–1527), were Christian mortalists.\n\nHowever, the best known advocate of soul sleep was Martin Luther (1483–1546). In writing on Ecclesiastes, Luther says\nElsewhere Luther states that\nJürgen Moltmann (2000) concludes from this that \"Luther conceived the state of the dead as a deep, dreamless sleep, removed from time and space, without consciousness and without feeling.\" That Luther believed in soul sleep is also the view of . Some writers have claimed that Luther changed his view later in life.\n\nGottfried Fritschel (1867) argued that quotations from Luther's Latin works had occasionally been misread in Latin or in German translation to contradict or qualify specific statements and Luther's overall teaching, namely that the sleep of the dead was unconscious: These readings can still be found in some English sources.\n\nThe two most frequently cited passages are:\n\nAs such, Lutheran Churches affirm that \"The Confessions rule out the contemporary view that death is a pleasant and painless transition into a perfect world\" and reject both the ideas that \"the teaching that the soul is by nature and by virtue of an inherent quality immortal\" and that \"the teaching that the soul 'sleeps' between death and the resurrection in such a way that it is not conscious of bliss\".\n\nOn the other hand, others believing in Christian mortalism included Camillo Renato (1540), Mátyás Dévai Bíró (1500–45), Michael Servetus (1511–53), Laelio Sozzini (1562), Fausto Sozzini (1563), the Polish Brethren (1565 onwards), Dirk Philips (1504–68), Gregory Paul of Brzezin (1568), the Socinians (1570–1800), John Frith (1573), George Schomann (1574) and Simon Budny (1576).\n\nSoul sleep was a significant minority view from the eighth to the seventeenth centuries, and soul death became increasingly common from the Reformation onwards.\n\nSoul sleep has been called a \"major current of seventeenth century protestant ideology.\" John Milton wrote in his unpublished \"De Doctrina Christiana\",\nGordon Campbell (2008) identifies Milton's views as \"thnetopsychism\", a belief that the soul dies with the body but is resurrected at the last judgment. however Milton speaks also of the dead as \"asleep\".\n\nThose holding this view include: 1600s: Sussex Baptists d. 1612: Edward Wightman 1627: Samuel Gardner 1628: Samuel Przypkowski 1636: George Wither 1637: Joachim Stegmann 1624: Richard Overton 1654: John Biddle (Unitarian) 1655: Matthew Caffyn 1658: Samuel Richardson 1608–74: John Milton 1588–1670: Thomas Hobbes 1605–82: Thomas Browne 1622–1705: Henry Layton 1702: William Coward 1632–1704: John Locke 1643–1727: Isaac Newton 1676–1748: Pietro Giannone 1751: William Kenrick 1755: Edmund Law 1759: Samuel Bourn 1723–91: Richard Price 1718–97: Peter Peckard 1733–1804: Joseph Priestley Francis Blackburne (1765).\n\nBelief in conditional immortality and the annihilation of the unsaved became increasingly common during the nineteenth century, entering mainstream Christianity in the twentieth century. From this point it is possible to speak in terms of entire groups holding the belief, and only the most prominent individual nineteenth-century advocates of the doctrine will be mentioned here.\n\nOthers include: Millerites (from 1833), Edward White (1846), Christadelphians (from 1848), Thomas Thayer (1855), François Gaussen (d. 1863), Henry Constable (1873), Louis Burnier (Waldensian, d. 1878), the Baptist Conditionalist Association (1878), Cameron Mann (1888), Emmanuel Pétavel-Olliff (1891), Miles Grant (1895), George Gabriel Stokes (1897).\n\nPresent-day defenders of mortalism include Nicky Gumbel, some Lutherans, the Seventh-day Adventist Church, Advent Christian Church, the Afterlife group, Christadelphians, the Church of God (Seventh Day), Church of God (7th day) – Salem Conference, the Church of God Abrahamic Faith, and various other Church of God organizations and related denominations which adhered to the older teachings of Herbert W. Armstrong's Worldwide Church of God and the Bible Student movement.\n\nJehovah's Witnesses also teach a form of mortalism but represent a special case. They believe that 144,000 believers began to be raised from the dead a short time after October 1914 (possibly, in the spring of 1918) to receive immortality in heaven, but all other believers will be raised from the dead on Judgment Day to receive eternal life on earth.\n\nThe orthodox Christian belief about the intermediate state between death and the Last Judgment is immortality of the soul followed immediately after death of the body by particular judgment. In Catholicism some souls temporarily stay in Purgatory to be purified for Heaven (as described in the Catechism of the Catholic Church, 1030–32). Eastern Orthodoxy, Methodism, Anglicanism, and Mormonism use different terminology, but generally teach that the soul waits in the Abode of the Dead, specifically Hades or the Spirit World, until the resurrection of the dead, the saved resting in light and the damned suffering in darkness. According to James Tabor this Eastern Orthodox picture of particular judgment is similar to the first-century Jewish and possibly Early Christian concept that the dead either \"rest in peace\" in the Bosom of Abraham (mentioned in the Gospel of Luke) or suffer in Hades. This view was also promoted by John Calvin, although Calvin taught that immortality was not in the nature of the soul but was imparted by God. Nineteenth-century Reformed theologians such as A. A. Hodge, W. G. T. Shedd, and Louis Berkhof also taught the immortality of the soul, but some later Reformed theologians such as Herman Bavinck and G. C. Berkouwer rejected the idea as unscriptural.\n\nOpponents of psychopannychism (soul sleeping) and thnetopsychism (the temporary death of the soul) include the Roman Catholic Church and Eastern Orthodox Church (that also teach about Intercession of saints, connected to this subject), most mainline Protestant denominations, and most conservative Protestants, Evangelicals, and Fundamentalists.\n\nBelievers in the opposing concept of universal reconciliation, arguing that salvation will eventually be received by all of humanity, have also referred to various books of the New Testament that seem to describe grace given to immortal souls such as the First Epistle to the Corinthians. The sections of 1 Corinthians 15:22, \"As all die in Adam, so all will be made alive in Christ\", and 1 Corinthians 15:28, \"God will be all in all\", are cited. Verses that seem to contradict the tradition of complete damnation and come up in arguments also include Lamentations 3:31-33 (NIV), \"For no one is cast off by the Lord forever. Though he brings grief, he will show compassion, so great is his unfailing love\", and 1 Timothy 4:10 (NIV), \"We have put our hope in the living God, who is the Savior of all people, and especially of those who believe.\"\n\nAs well, the Epistle to the Colossians receives attention, with Colossians 1:17-20 reading:\nThe Roman Catholic Church has called \"soul mortality\" a serious heresy:\n\nThe idea that the spirit continues as a conscious, active, and independent agent after mortal death is an important teaching of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. \nConcerning the post-death, pre-judgment place of human spirits, LDS scripture states that \"the spirits of all men, whether they be good or evil, are taken home to that God who gave them life\" (Alma 40:11). They are then assigned to a state of paradise or hell (called Spirit Prison) in the spirit world depending on their faith in Christ and the manner of their mortal life (Alma 40:12-14). The Spirits remain in these states until the final judgment, when they are either received into a state of glory in the Kingdom of God, or they are cast off into Outer Darkness. \n\nLatter-Day Saint doctrine differs from Eastern Orthodox doctrine in that LDS doctrine teaches that the souls in Prison who ended up there due to ignorance or inability to accept Christ may be preached to while in Prison so that they may accept Christ. This is derived from the LDS interpretation of 1 Peter 3:18-20 where Christ is described as preaching to the \"dead who were in prison\" and 1 Peter 4:5-6, which states:\nLike many Eastern Orthodox and Catholics, the LDS Church teaches that the prayers of the righteous living may be of help to the dead, but the LDS Church takes this one step further with vicarious sacraments (called \"ordinances\" but with a sacramental theological meaning). The LDS Church preaches the necessity of baptism by water and the Holy Ghost (Baptism and Confirmation) for salvation. They teach that previously ignorant spirits who accept Christ in Spirit Prison may receive saving ordinances through vicarious Baptism and Confirmation of the living. This is drawn from 1st Corinthians 15, wherein the Apostle Paul is arguing against a group of Christians who are mistakenly denying the physical resurrection of the dead. Paul asks them in 1st Corinthians 15:29:\n\nThe LDS Church believes that this is a reference to vicarious work for the dead which was practiced by the ancient Christian Church and considered orthodox in Early Christianity, including by the Apostle Paul, hence his use of it as an example of the correct doctrine of the resurrection. This is the origin of the LDS practice of baptism for the dead. As such, a great deal of LDS doctrine and practice is tied to the idea of the continued existence and activity of the human spirit after death and before judgment.\n\nAs early as 1917 Harvey W. Scott wrote \"That there is no definite affirmation, in the Old Testament of the doctrine of a future life, or personal immortality, is the general consensus of Biblical scholarship.\" The modern scholarly consensus is that the canonical teaching of the Old Testament made no reference to an \"immortal soul\" independent of the body. This view is represented consistently in a wide range of scholarly reference works.\n\nAccording to Donelley, \"Twentieth century biblical scholarship largely agrees that the ancient Jews had little explicit notion of a personal afterlife until very late in the Old Testament period,\" and \"only the latest stratum of the Old Testament asserts even the resurrection of the body.\" Scholars have noted that the notion of the \"disembodied existence of a soul in bliss\" is not in accordance with a Hebrew world view: \"While Hebrew thought world distinguished soul from body (as material basis of life), there was no question of two separate, independent entities.\" Gillman argues that\nHowever, N. T. Wright suggests that \"the Bible offers a spectrum of belief about life after death.\" While Goldingay suggests that Qohelet points out that there is no evidence that \"human beings would enjoy a positive afterlife,\" Philip Johnston argues that a few Psalms, such as Psalm 16, Psalm 49 and Psalm 73, \"affirm a continued communion with God after death,\" but \"give no elaboration of how, when or where this communion will take place.\"\n\nNeyrey suggests that, \"for a Hebrew, ‘soul’ indicated the unity of a human person,\" and \"this Hebrew field of meaning is breached in the Wisdom of Solomon by explicit introduction of Greek ideas of soul. Avery-Peck argues that\nRegardless of the character of the soul's existence in the intermediate state, biblical scholarship affirms that a disembodied soul is unnatural and at best transitional. Bromiley argues that \"the soul and the body belong together, so that without either the one or the other there is no true man. Disembodied existence in Sheol is unreal. Paul does not seek a life outside the body, but wants to be clothed with a new and spiritual body (1 Cor. 15; 2 Cor. 5).\"\n\nThe mortalist disbelief in the existence of a naturally immortal soul, is affirmed as biblical teaching by a range of standard scholarly Jewish and Christian sources. The Blackwell Encyclopedia of Modern Christian Thought (1995) says, \"There is no concept of an immortal soul in the Old Testament, nor does the New Testament ever call the human soul immortal.\" Harper's Bible Dictionary (1st ed. 1985) says that \"For a Hebrew, ‘soul’ indicated the unity of a human person; Hebrews were living bodies, they did not have bodies\". says, \"But to the Bible man is not a soul in a body but a body/soul unity\". says, \"Scripture does not present even a rudimentarily developed theology of the soul\" and \"The notion of the soul as an independent force that animates human life but that can exist apart from the human body—either prior to conception and birth or subsequent to life and death—is the product only of later Judaism\". The says that the Septuagint translated the Hebrew word \"nefesh\" by the Greek word \"psyche\", but the latter does not have the same sense in Greek thought. The says, \"Far from referring simply to one aspect of a person, “soul” refers to the whole person\". The says, \"Possibly Jn. 6:33 also includes an allusion to the general life-giving function. This teaching rules out all ideas of an emanation of the soul.\" and \"The soul and the body belong together, so that without either the one or the other there is no true man\". The says, \"Indeed, the salvation of the “immortal soul” has sometimes been a commonplace in preaching, but it is fundamentally unbiblical.\" The says \"The Hebrew Bible does not present the human soul (nepeš) or spirit (rûah) as an immortal substance, and for the most part it envisions the dead as ghosts in Sheol, the dark, sleepy underworld\". The says, \"there is practically no specific teaching on the subject in the Bible beyond an underlying assumption of some form of afterlife (see immortality)\". The says \"It is this essential soul-body oneness that provides the uniqueness of the biblical concept of the resurrection of the body as distinguished from the Greek idea of the immortality of the soul\".\n\nThe mortalist disbelief in the existence of a naturally immortal soul is also affirmed as biblical teaching by various modern theologians, and Hebblethwaite observes the doctrine of immortality of the soul is \"not popular amongst Christian theologians or among Christian philosophers today\".\n\n"}

Color moments are mainly used for color indexing purposes as features in image retrieval applications in order to compare how similar two images are based on color. Usually one image is compared to a database of digital images with pre-computed features in order to find and retrieve a similar Image. Each comparison between images results in a similarity score, and the lower this score is the more identical the two images are supposed to be.\n\nColor moments are scaling and rotation invariant. It is usually the case that only the first three color moments are used as features in image retrieval applications as most of the color distribution information is contained in the low-order moments. Since color moments encode both shape and color information they are a good feature to use under changing lighting conditions, but they cannot handle occlusion very successfully. Color moments can be computed for any color model. Three color moments are computed per channel (e.g. 9 moments if the color model is RGB and 12 moments if the color model is CMYK). Computing color moments is done in the same way as computing moments of a probability distribution.\n\nThe first color moment can be interpreted as the average color in the image, and it can be calculated by using the following formula\n\nwhere N is the number of pixels in the image and formula_2 is the value of the j-th pixel of the image at the i-th color channel.\n\nThe second color moment is the standard deviation, which is obtained by taking the square root of the variance of the color distribution.\n\nwhere formula_4 is the mean value, or first color moment, for the i-th color channel of the image.\n\nThe third color moment is the skewness. It measures how asymmetric the color distribution is, and thus it gives information about the shape of the color distribution. Skewness can be computed with the following formula:\n\nKurtosis is the fourth color moment, and, similarly to skewness, it provides information about the shape of the color distribution. More specifically, kurtosis is a measure of how flat or tall the distribution is in comparison to normal distribution.\n\nHigher-order color moments are usually not part of the color moments feature set in image retrieval tasks as they require more data in order to obtain a good estimate of their value, and also the lower-order moments generally provide enough information.\n\nColor moments have significant applications in image retrieval. They can be used in order to compare how similar two images are. This is a relatively new approach to color indexing. The greatest advantage of using color moments comes from the fact that there is no need to store the complete color distribution. This greatly speeds up image retrieval since there are less features to compare. In addition, the first three color moments have the same units, which allows for comparison between them.\n\nColor indexing is the main application of color moments. Images can be indexed, and the index will contain the computed color moments. Then, if someone has a particular image and wants to find similar images in the database, the color moments of the image of interest will also be computed. After that the following function will be used in order to compute a similarity score between the image of interest and all the images in the database:\nwhere:\nFinally, the images in the database will be ranked according to the computed similarity score with the image of interest, and the database images with the lowest formula_14 value should be retrieved. \"A retrieval based on formula_14 may produce false positives because the index contains no information about the correlation between the color channels\".\n\nA simple and concise example of the use of color moments for image retrieval tasks is illustrated in.\n\nConsider having several test images in a database and a \"New Image\". The goal is to retrieve images from the database that are similar to the \"New Image\". The first three color moments are used as features. There are several steps in this computation.\n\n\n\n\n"}

The atmosphere generated by the dystopian Combine state has been praised by reviewers, although the artificial intelligence of the transhuman Combine characters was thought to be inferior to that of other characters in \"Half-Life 2\". In addition to their role within the \"Half-Life\" series, the Combine have been adapted for machinima productions and one Combine character type has been made into plush toys by Valve.\n\nSome elements of the Combine's appearance, such as that of the Advisor, are inspired by the works of Frank Herbert. The towering Striders seen throughout Half Life 2 and its subsequent episodes are based directly on the Martian tripods of the H.G. Wells novel The War of the Worlds, where said Martians invade Victorian Era England, using the tripods as their main \"weapon\". The name \"Combine\" itself is a tribute to Ken Kesey's novel \"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\", which features a collection of authorities which mechanistically manipulate and process individuals.\n\nDuring \"Half-Life 2\"s development, various concepts for Combine non-player characters were cut. Female Combine assassins, similar to black operations assassins featured in the first game, were planned but later abandoned, although they appear in the \"\" arcade game. Another non-player character, the cremator, was conceptualized as a Combine laborer who cleaned the streets of bodies after a battle with an acid gun and although removed from the game, its head was featured in Eli Vance's laboratory. Other cuts included a variety of alien Combine soldiers that would have complemented the transhuman soldiers in the game and a number of synthetic combat machines. Many of \"Half-Life 2\"s Combine characters went through multiple redesigns; the Combine Overwatch soldier was subjected to at least twelve redesigns before the final appearance was settled on.\n\nOpera singer and actress Ellen McLain provides the voice for the Combine Overwatch announcer and dispatcher in \"Half-Life 2\" and its episodic expansions, while the various Combine soldiers throughout the games are voiced by John Patrick Lowrie.\n\nLittle is revealed of the Combine's role outside of Earth, but dialogue in \"Half-Life 2\" states that they control worlds in different dimensions and inhabited by a range of species. The Combine occupation of Earth, however, is shown to be a brutal police state. In City 17, an Eastern European city, Civil Protection units are seen frequently, often conducting random searches of apartment blocks, interrogating human citizens and engaging in random police brutality. The military Overwatch forces of the Combine are shown attacking human resistance bases in an effort to further solidify their control. The citizens themselves are all clad in blue uniforms and live in designated apartment blocks. Citizens are shown to be moved around to different cities or locales at the Combine's will, using passenger trains. Vortigaunts, alien creatures from the original \"Half-Life\", are also shown to have been enslaved, and are observed in various jobs such as janitors. According to \"\", the Combine are draining the Earth's oceans, minerals and resources to be used on other Combine worlds; both the water levels along the coast of City 17 and later coastal levels are also greatly reduced.\n\nAt the heart of the Combine's command structure in \"Half-Life 2\" is the Citadel, an enormous structure of Combine construction, reaching approximately 2.6 kilometres (1.6 miles) into the sky from ground level, and delving deep underground. Located within City 17, the Citadel serves as the primary headquarters of the Combine, housing both Combine Advisors and the office of the Earth administrator, Wallace Breen. Breen is frequently seen on large screens around the city from which he spreads propaganda. The Citadel projects an energy field that is able to prevent human reproduction, as well as a field that keeps dangerous alien wildlife out of the city. In addition, the Citadel contains a trans-dimensional teleporter which allows the Combine to travel between their native universe and Earth. The Citadel also contains construction facilities for various synthetic Combine combat machines.\n\nThe Combine is composed of various species and machines. The most commonly encountered enemies throughout \"Half-Life 2\" and its expansions are the transhuman Overwatch soldiers and human Civil Protection officers. A variety of combat machines also encountered, ranging from APCs and helicopter gunships to a giant 'Smart wall' which encloses occupied cities and gradually destroys anything in its path. A number of weaponised alien 'synths' are also encountered by Freeman.\n\nAdvisors are large larvae-like creatures which are virtually featureless, with no visible eyes, ears or limbs, though they do possess an eye-like mechanical device attached to the left side of their heads, and detachable mechanical arms. Their faces are covered by a form of respirator, which is able to lift to reveal a mouth-like orifice from which extends a long flexible proboscis. With this, they can examine objects, or attack and kill enemies. Advisors appear to be feeding upon their victim during their attacks. It is implied that Advisors are the original master race behind the Combine, with the Earth administrator Wallace Breen answering directly to them. Although Advisors are usually seen in protective pods guarded by Combine soldiers, they also possess telekinetic powers with which they are able to float through the air and immobilize enemies so that their proboscis can examine their victims without interference. Their appearance was based on the Guild Navigators from the film \"Dune\".\n\nCivil Protection is the Combine's law enforcement agency on Earth, consisting of humans who have agreed to work on behalf of the Combine. Also referred to as metrocops, Civil Protection units wear light armor and gas masks, which heavily resemble a somewhat modified Soviet PMG mask. They are usually armed with electroshock batons and pistols, and are occasionally seen using submachine guns. Metrocops are brutal in their methods, keeping the local populace in line via intimidation and physical force. Interrogations, inspections, raids, random beatings, summary executions and acts of extreme police brutality are all used as a means of policing their respective jurisdictions; their methods are justified by their role as \"protectors of the civilians well-being\". On the outskirts of City 17, Civil Protection units are observed patrolling for escapees from the city. Civil Protection officers are in constant contact with Combine Overwatch headquarters, which gives them objectives and situation updates. On the death of an officer, that officer's armor detects that its wearer is no longer alive and automatically informs headquarters of the fatality and advises nearby units as to the place of death.\n\nThe Combine Overwatch is the primary military force of the Combine on Earth. It consists of biomechanically enhanced humans, who wear heavily padded long-sleeve body armor and gas masks. The markings on the suit change depending on each individual unit's assignment and rank. Elite Combine soldiers wear bright white armor with one red eye, while the majority of soldiers wear blue armor. Shotgun units wear similar armour to the standard Combine Soldier, but coloured brown with orange eyes. They are armed with a variety of firearms, including shotguns, submachine guns, sniper rifles and pulse rifles. Overwatch soldiers usually operate in small groups, using squad tactics and grenades to flush out and flank the player. They occasionally provide support to Combine synths, and often travel to areas by use of dropships. They use radios to communicate with each other and with Overwatch headquarters. Combine Overwatch soldiers are usually encountered outside City 17, and only appear in the city after \"The Uprising\" near the end of \"Half-Life 2\".\n\nThe Combine use a large array of science fiction technology. They have access to teleportation technology, which takes them from their dimension to Earth. However, their teleporter technology is restrictive in comparison to that developed by Eli Vance, Isaac Kleiner and Judith Mossman in that it cannot be used to teleport to other locations on Earth without significant modification. Throughout the games, various futuristic computer consoles, doors, power sources and weapon emplacements are encountered. In addition, the Combine employ the use of small airborne robots, scanners, to observe the citizens of Earth. The city variant merely moves about the streets, monitors individuals, and takes photographs, while the combat equivalent is capable of dropping mines into an area. Civil Protection makes use of smaller airborne robots called manhacks, which fly using razor-sharp rotating blades with which they attack their targets to cause laceration injuries. These are often deployed in closed-in areas. The Combine also use two types of land mines; hopper mines throw themselves into the air and detonate when an enemy is detected nearby, while the spherical rollermines roll towards vehicles or other enemies, attach themselves and deliver damaging electrical attacks. Combine technology is also used to transform humans into Overwatch soldiers or stalkers, deformed and mutilated humans with no memory of their past selves who act as slaves and maintenance workers in Combine facilities. Transformation into a Stalker is considered among the Combine's worst punishments for dissidents.\n\nMilitarily, the Combine make use of both synthetic machines—machines powered by organic components—and traditional mechanical machines such as armored personnel carriers and attack helicopters. The most prominent of the synthetic machines are the insect-like gunships; and Striders, armored creatures that walk upon three legs, which are armed with a high powered warpspace cannon and a head-mounted pulse turret. In \"Episode Two\", a smaller equivalent to the Strider, the Hunter, is introduced. These 2.5 m (8 ft) tall, tripodal assault machines fire explosive flechettes at targets and are small enough to maneuver indoors. Other synths are seen near the end of the \"Half-Life 2\", although their roles are not elaborated on. Sentry turrets are also used by the Combine. The Combine also use headcrabs as a biological weapon against dissidents, firing artillery shells loaded with the creatures into areas and allowing them to infest the vicinity.\n\nAccording to the backstory presented during \"Half-Life 2\", the Combine appear on Earth after the death of the Nihilanth, the boss character at the end of \"Half-Life\". The death of the Nihilanth, a powerful creature controlling the dimensional rip between Xen and the Black Mesa Research Facility on Earth, causes the rip to worsen, resulting in \"portal storms\" which spread the hostile wildlife of Xen across Earth. The Combine manipulate this tear in the spacetime continuum, widening it to allow access to Earth from their dimension. When it is sufficiently wide, the Combine invade in force, and in the subsequent Seven Hour War quickly defeat the forces of Earth and destroy the United Nations Secretariat Building in New York City. Earth's surrender is negotiated by Wallace Breen, who is then made the Combine puppet administrator of Earth, and uses City 17 as his base of operations.\n\nThe Combine's first appearance is in \"Half-Life 2\". Through the early stages of the game, Combine Civil Protection units pursue Gordon Freeman through City 17 after he accidentally reveals his presence to Wallace Breen. Due to Freeman's actions in \"Half-Life\", Breen sees Freeman as a major threat. As Freeman escapes the city, Civil Protection units raid the resistance base of Black Mesa East and capture resistance leader Eli Vance, who is transferred to holding facilities at Nova Prospekt. Freeman and Vance's daughter Alyx break into the facility to rescue him, but Eli Vance is teleported to the Combine Citadel by double agent Judith Mossman. However, the strike against Nova Prospekt is seen as the start of a revolution by the citizens of Earth, who take up arms against the Combine. In response, Combine Overwatch are deployed to City 17, and heavy street fighting takes place. Freeman manages to infiltrate the Citadel but is captured and taken to Breen. Mossman allows Freeman to break free of his captivity, and Breen flees to the Citadel's trans-dimensional teleporter, intent on escape. However, Freeman destroys the teleporter's reactor before Breen can escape, causing a large explosion that destroys the top of the Citadel.\n\nIn \"\", the destruction of the teleporter at the top of the Citadel has isolated the Combine forces on Earth, but also caused its primary reactor to begin to melt down. This forces Gordon Freeman and Alyx Vance to journey back into the critically damaged Citadel to temporarily stabilize its reactor while the city's inhabitants are evacuated. The Combine forces, however, instead attempt to accelerate the meltdown in order to send a message to their native universe for reinforcements. After Alyx acquires an encrypted copy of the message to be sent, Overwatch forces desperately attempt to stop the pair from escaping the city, spurred on by Combine Advisors. As the pair escape on a train at the end of the game, the Citadel detonates, sending the message and destroying City 17.\n\n\"\" opens with Alyx and Freeman discovering that the Citadel's destruction has resulted in the formation of a super portal to the Combine dimension, which is slowly progressing to a stage where the Combine can send overwhelming reinforcements. They also discover that the data packet in the message they retrieved from the Citadel contains codes that can be used to close the portal, and so traverse the countryside to deliver the packet to the resistance headquarters at White Forest. As they progress, it becomes evident that the Combine Advisors escaped the Citadel's destruction, and that remaining Combine forces are regrouping, albeit under occasional attacks by Vortigaunts. Aware of the resistance's plans to close the super portal, the Combine attack White Forest in force, but are repelled. The super portal is destroyed after the resistance launch a satellite containing the appropriate data. However, in the game's closing scenes, two Advisors attack Freeman, Alyx and Eli Vance, and kill Eli before being driven off by Dog.\n\nThe use of sandbox applications like \"Garry's Mod\" have allowed for Combine non-player characters to be used in a variety of webcomics and machinima productions. The combine are also referenced in the Portal (video game series). In one webcomic, \"Concerned\", the Combine are portrayed as a highly bureaucratic and often inept organization. One issue shows a Civil Protection briefing for attempting to capture the comic's protagonist Gordon Frohman, in which officers are instructed to cluster around explosive barrels, seek cover on unstable structures and rappel down from bridges in front of fast moving vehicles. In another example, the machinima series \"Combine Nation\" follows Civil Protection officers in a similar style to police procedural documentaries. The officers perform their duties with various twists, such as the team's medical officer having an obsession with adhesive bandages and the legal consultant, an Overwatch soldier, favoring dramatic entries, such as throwing flashbangs, which often backfire on him. Another web series, called \"The Combine\", parodies the TV show \"The Office\". This series attempts to portray the combine as an intergalactic corporation that suffers from everyday office issues and problems. One episode shows the soldiers attempting to bypass a webfilter so they can watch videos online instead of working. Other media portray the Combine with more serious overtones, such as the live-action video \"The Combine Interview\", which parodies an interview with Tom Cruise discussing Scientology. The video, described by ActionTrip as \"eerie, to say the least\" and by both Joystiq and Kotaku as \"creepy\", instead presents an interview with a Civil Protection officer discussing the Combine's rule of Earth, adapting Cruise's words to fit the Combine theme. \"PC Gamer\" UK noted that \"the suggestion, of course, is that Scientology's purpose or self-image in some way resembles that of the homogenising intergalactic murderous alien collective\".\n\nThe Combine have inspired the creation of several items of merchandise for the \"Half-Life\" series. A plush toy was created by Valve, based on the synthetic tripod Hunters introduced in \"Episode Two\". Sold and distributed via Valve's online store, the toy was released in February 2008. In addition, Valve has produced t-shirts depicting the Combine's idea of humanity's evolution, from ape to Combine Overwatch soldier, and a lithograph displaying twelve pieces of concept art for the Combine soldier.\n\nThe Combine have received a positive reaction from critics. 1UP.com praised the \"epic feel\" built up by the Combine and their harsh rule of City 17 in \"Half-Life 2\", stating that this created \"a world governed by newspeak, decorated with urban decay, and lacking any hope\". GameSpot echoed this praise, saying that the \"vision of a dystopian police state is chillingly effective\". \"PC Zone\" described the appearance of the Combine's soldiers as \"stormtrooper-like\", but although stating that overall the artificial intelligence for the game was \"extremely competent\", the Combine non-player characters \"could have used better survival instincts\", citing their reluctance to take cover and tendency to charge at the player and into a shotgun blast.\n\nA number of reviews of \"Episode One\" were disappointed by the lack of new characters for the Combine, although GameSpot praised the improved AI for Combine soldiers and the addition of new abilities, such as rappelling down buildings.\n\nThe Combine were ranked at #22 in IGN's 'Top 100 Videogame Villains' list.\n\n"}

They transform into futuristic helicopters. They are all based on adaptations of the character Gyro Robo from the Machine Robo toy line. Cop-Tur first appeared in America as one of the main villains in the \"Challenge of the Gobots\" animated series.\n\nLike most of the Renegades, Cop-Tur isn't especially smart. He has something of a sick sense of humor, and often lets off a vicious chuckle when he comes across a weaker foe. He is considered cold-blooded.\n\nHe can fire energy blasts from his hands or eyes. Cop-Tur can use his rotor blades in either mode to create localised hurricanes, or (in robot mode) a sword or spinning hand-held blade weapon. In vehicle mode used a tractor beam which he uses to haul cargo as large as himself while flying.\n\nThe sound effect used for Cop-Tur's blades when flying were later used for the Autobot Sandstorm's blades in the Transformers series.\n\nCrasher and Cop-Tur aided Cy-Kill when he stole the astrobeam and escaped Gobotron to Earth. Cop-Tur was, along with Crasher, Cy-Kill's regular muscle on the Renegades' frequent forays to Earth, beginning with the Renegades' first attempt to conquer the planet. Due to the nature of his vehicle mode, he would often be pitched into aerial combat with Guardian commander Leader-1, invariably coming off second best. He also developed something of a rivalry with the Guardian Flip Top.\n\nIn \"It's the Thought that Counts\" Cy-Kill, Cop-Tur, Crasher, Geeper-Creeper, Pincher, and Snoop attack a lab, but it is defended by Leader-1, Baron Von Joy, Blaster, Dozer, Dumper, Road Ranger, Scooter, Scratch and Turbo. Although the Guardians win the battle, an accidental backfire from Baron Von Joy's weapon allows the Renegades to escape.\n\nIn \"Doppelganger\" episode #23 Cy-Kill, Cop-Tur, Crasher and Snoop attacked Leader-1, Turbo, Scooter and Small Foot. Crasher wounded Small Foot. After attaining recordings of the Guardians the Renegades retreated. Using the recordings Cy-Kill had Herr Fiend program robot duplicates of the Guardians. When demonstrating Space Bender weapon to Unicom Leader-1 learned that the Renegades were attacking Washington. The Renegades ambushed Leader-1 and replaced him with his duplicate. Leading the Command Center back to Gobotron and getting rid of Scooter and Small Foot the Renegades then released duplicates of Path Finder, Rest-Q, Van Guard and Turbo. Small Foot and Scooter were able to capture the Turbo duplicate and learn where their friends were being held. Cy-Kill then replaced Good Night. Using the duplicate Turbo the Guardians infiltrated the Renegade base, freed the captured Guardians and escape from Spoons and Fitor. Although blocked by the Renegades, Scooter used a hologram of Zod to make the Renegades flee. Making it back to Gobotron the Guardians were attacked by the Guardian duplicates. The real Guardians were able to defeat their duplicates with the aid of the real Zeemon, Hans-Cuff and Rest-Q. Cy-Kill then arrived in Thrustor with more duplicates, but Small Foot was able to stop with robots using the Space Bender, which would fuse their robot brains.\n\nIn episode #27, \"Tarnished Image\" Doctor Go creates a device that allows the Renegades to appear like Guardians. Cy-Kill, Crasher and Cop-Tur disguise themselves as Leader-1, Scooter and Turbo and go on a rampage on Earth while the real Guardians are sent on a fake rescue mission. When the Guardians return they are banished from Earth by the humans. The Guardians are eventually able to prove the Renegades staged the attacks, chase them off and capture Doctor Go.\n\nScooter and Small Foot joined Nick and A.J. to watch a car stunt show which was attacked by Crasher, BuggyMan and Fly Trap. Small Foot fought Buggyman and defeated him, but the Renegades regained the upper hand until the Guardians were rescued by Leader-1 and Turbo who arrived in Power Suits. Cy-Kill vowed to gain Power Suits for the Renegades. Scooter decided he needed more firepower, so he had Baron Von Joy remove his damaged holo projector in favor of a blaster unit. Screw Head, Bad Boy and Cop-Tur were sent to attack Unicom bases and distract the Guardians while Cy-Kill, Crasher and Scorp attempted to take the suits from the Guardian Command Center. Small Foot and Scooter were able to delay the Renegades until Leader-1 and Turbo returned to chase away the Renegades. Realizing he was a better Guardian with his holo projector, Scooter had it reinstalled.\n\nCop-Tur was among the Renegade Gobot forces who aided the Rock Lord Magmar on the planet Cordax.\nCop-Tur appeared in the story \"Scooter's Mighty Magnet\" as one of Cy-Kill's minions.\n\nCop-Tur appeared in the story \"La Qonquista De La Tierra\" (The Conquest of the Earth) from the Argentina \"Gobots\" comic #5.\n\nIn the \"Eagle\" comic storyline, Cop-Tur was built on Earth by Stron-Domez, and first saw action taking control of a factory in Birmingham. He only had a short life, as soon afterwards the factory was rushed by the Robotron Security Forces, and Cop-Tur was captured. He was deactivated, and his body most likely remained on board the SF Command Centre at the end of the series.\n\nThe character's prosaic name was also lampooned in the \"Robot Chicken\" episode \"Book of Corrine\".\n\n\nThis version of Cop-Tur is a Decepticon who made a post-humous cameo in the Transformers: Armada storyline.\n\nCop-Turn appears in the \"\" comic as one of the unnamed Decepticons killed by the heralds of Unicron.\n\nThis version of Cop-Tur is the Micromaster partner of Dion. They are part of the 2010 exclusive Transformers Collectors Club membership set.\n\nThis character's personality is based on that of the Gobot character, as he likes to break things.\n\nCop-Tur's biography is printed in issue #31 of the Transformers Collectors Club magazine.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "183373", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=183373", "title": "Critical chain project management", "text": "Critical chain project management\n\nCritical chain project management (CCPM) is a method of planning and managing projects that emphasizes the resources (people, equipment, physical space) required to execute project tasks. It was developed by Eliyahu M. Goldratt. It differs from more traditional methods that derive from critical path and PERT algorithms, which emphasize task order and rigid scheduling. A critical chain project network strives to keep resources levelled, and requires that they be flexible in start times.\n\nCritical chain project management is based on methods and algorithms derived from Theory of Constraints. The idea of CCPM was introduced in 1997 in Eliyahu M. Goldratt's book, \"Critical Chain\". Application of CCPM has been credited with achieving projects 10% to 50% faster and/or cheaper than the traditional methods (i.e., CPM, PERT, Gantt, etc.) developed from 1910 to 1950s.\n\nAccording to studies of traditional project management methods by Standish Group and others as of 1998, only 44% of projects typically finish on time. Projects typically complete at 222% of the duration originally planned, 189% of the original budgeted cost, 70% of projects fall short of their planned scope (technical content delivered), and 30% are cancelled before completion. CCPM tries to improve performance relative to these traditional statistics.\n\nWith traditional project management methods, 30% of lost time and resources are typically consumed by wasteful techniques such as bad multitasking (in particular task switching), student syndrome, Parkinson's law, in-box delays, and lack of prioritization.\n\nIn a project plan, the critical chain is the sequence of both precedence- and resource-dependent tasks that prevents a project from being completed in a shorter time, given finite resources. If resources are always available in unlimited quantities, then a project's critical chain is identical to its critical path method.\n\nCritical chain is an alternative to critical path analysis. Main features that distinguish critical chain from critical path are: \n\nCCPM planning aggregates the large amounts of safety time added to tasks within a project into the buffers—to protect due-date performance and avoid wasting this safety time through bad multitasking, student syndrome, Parkinson's Law, and poorly synchronized integration.\n\nCritical chain project management uses buffer management instead of earned value management to assess the performance of a project. Some project managers feel that the earned value management technique is misleading, because it does not distinguish progress on the project constraint (i.e., on the critical chain) from progress on non-constraints (\"i.e., on other paths). Event chain methodology can determine a size of project, feeding, and resource buffers.\n\nA project plan or work breakdown structure (WBS) is created in much the same fashion as with critical path. The plan is worked backward from a completion date with each task starting as late as possible.\n\nA duration is assigned to each task. Some software implementations add a second duration: one a \"best guess,\" or 50% probability duration, and a second \"safe\" duration, which should have higher probability of completion (perhaps 90% or 95%, depending on the amount of risk that the organization can accept). Other software implementations go through the duration estimate of every task and remove a fixed percentage to be aggregated into the buffers.\n\nResources are assigned to each task, and the plan is resource leveled, using the aggressive durations. The longest sequence of resource-leveled tasks that lead from beginning to end of the project is then identified as the critical chain. The justification for using the 50% estimates is that half of the tasks will finish early and half will finish late, so that the variance over the course of the project should be zero.\n\nRecognizing that tasks are more likely to take more time than less time due to Parkinson's law, Student syndrome, or other reasons, CCPM uses \"buffers\" to monitor project schedule and financial performance. The \"extra\" duration of each task on the critical chain—the difference between the \"safe\" durations and the 50% durations—is gathered in a buffer at the end of the project. In the same way, buffers are gathered at the end of each sequence of tasks that feed into the critical chain. The date at the end of the project buffer is given to external stakeholders as the delivery date. Finally, a baseline is established, which enables financial monitoring of the project.\n\nAn alternate duration-estimation methodology uses probability-based quantification of duration using Monte Carlo simulation. In 1999, a researcher applied simulation to assess the impact of risks associated with each component of project work breakdown structure on project duration, cost and performance. Using Monte Carlo simulation, the project manager can apply different probabilities for various risk factors that affect a project component. The probability of occurrence can vary from 0% to 100% chance of occurrence. The impact of risk is entered into the simulation model along with the probability of occurrence. The number of iterations of Monte Carlo simulation depend on the tolerance level of error and provide a density graph illustrating the overall probability of risk impact on project outcome.\n\nWhen the plan is complete and the project is ready to start, the project network is fixed and the buffers' sizes are \"locked\" (i.e., their planned duration may not be altered during the project), because they are used to monitor project schedule and financial performance.\n\nWith no slack in the duration of individual tasks, resources are encouraged to focus on the task at hand to complete it and hand it off to the next person or group. The objective here is to eliminate bad multitasking. This is done by providing priority information to all resources. The literature draws an analogy with a relay race. Each element on the project is encouraged to move as quickly as they can: when they are running their \"leg\" of the project, they should be focused on completing the assigned task as quickly as possible, with minimization of distractions and multitasking. In some case studies, actual batons are reportedly hung by the desks of people when they are working on critical chain tasks so that others know not to interrupt. The goal, here, is to overcome the tendency to delay work or to do extra work when there seems to be time. The CCPM literature contrasts this with \"traditional\" project management that monitors task start and completion dates. CCPM encourages people to move as quickly as possible, regardless of dates.\n\nBecause task duration has been planned at the 50% probability duration, there is pressure on resources to complete critical chain tasks as quickly as possible, overcoming student's syndrome and Parkinson's Law.\n\nAccording to proponents, monitoring is, in some ways, the greatest advantage of the Critical Chain method. Because individual tasks vary in duration from the 50% estimate, there is no point in trying to force every task to complete \"on time;\" estimates can never be perfect. Instead, we monitor the buffers created during the planning stage. A fever chart or similar graph can be created and posted to show the consumption of buffer as a function of project completion. If the rate of buffer consumption is low, the project is on target. If the rate of consumption is such that there is likely to be little or no buffer at the end of the project, then corrective actions or recovery plans must be developed to recover the loss. When the buffer consumption rate exceeds some critical value (roughly: the rate where all of the buffer may be expected to be consumed \"before\" the end of the project, resulting in late completion), then those alternative plans need to be implemented.\n\nCritical sequence was originally identified in the 1960s.\n\n\nTzvi Raz, Robert Barnes and Dov Dvir, Project Management Journal, December 2003.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "5197883", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5197883", "title": "Death of Brittanie Cecil", "text": "Death of Brittanie Cecil\n\nBrittanie Nichole Cecil (March 20, 1988 – March 18, 2002) was a hockey fan who died from injuries suffered when a puck was deflected into the stands and struck her in the left temple at Nationwide Arena in Columbus, Ohio, on March 16, 2002. It was the first and currently only fan fatality in the NHL's 100-year history. Because of Cecil's death, the league implemented mandatory netting at both ends of the rink in every arena at the beginning of the next NHL season in 2002–03 to protect spectators from errant pucks.\n\nA native of West Alexandria, Ohio, a rural community near Dayton, Cecil was an avid sports fan and soccer player, competing in a state tournament with her team, the Orange Crush, at eleven years old. After the team qualified for the state tournament, mayor Carol Lunsford declared the day Orange Crush Day. Cecil attended Twin Valley South Middle School as a cheerleader, student council member and an honor student. She attended Thompson Secondary School.\n\nCecil had been watching the Columbus Blue Jackets play the Calgary Flames on March 16, 2002, on tickets received as an early gift from her father for her 14th birthday. With 12:10 remaining in the second period and the Blue Jackets up 1–0, a shot by the Blue Jackets' Espen Knutsen was deflected by the Flames' Derek Morris and went over the glass behind the net, striking her in the left temple. Play carried on as the players were unaware of having accidentally caused any serious injury. The Blue Jackets, who were already eliminated from playoff contention, would go on to win the game 3–1. In fact, although Cecil had suffered a skull fracture, she walked to a first-aid station before being taken to Columbus Children's Hospital in an ambulance with her only visible injury being a gash on her forehead. At the hospital, she suffered an initial seizure and was admitted, but appeared to be recovering the next day, both communicative and ambulatory, and without complaints of pain or dizziness. A CT-scan, however, had failed to catch a torn vertebral artery, resulting in severe clotting and swelling of the brain. On March 18, she developed a high fever and lost consciousness. She died nearly 48 hours after being struck, at 5:15 p.m. on March 18, 2002, two days before her 14th birthday.\n\nCecil's funeral was held at Preble Memory Gardens Chapel near West Alexandria, after which a procession of more than 150 cars followed the hearse to Fairview Cemetery, where she was buried. Attending the funeral was Blue Jackets general manager Doug MacLean, who spoke on behalf of the team.\n\nThe Thursday after the incident, a moment of silence was observed for Cecil at the next Blue Jackets home game, played against the Detroit Red Wings. Her initials \"BNC\" were worn by the team's players on their helmets for the remainder of the season.\n\nKnutsen and Morris, the two players who combined for the fatal slapshot, expressed remorse following Cecil's death. Morris, who deflected the puck, explained, \"You try to say, 'It happens all the time,' but you can't. I don't know how many times pucks get deflected over the glass, but it doesn't make it any better. You can always say, 'It's not my fault,' but you always feel like it is, a little.\" Knutsen, who was given the option of sitting out the next game by Blue Jackets coach Dave King but chose to play, told reporters, \"I think about it all the time. It was a terrible accident, and I cannot get it off my mind.\"\n\nIn December 2010, Knutsen met with Cecil's family, bringing some closure to both parties.\n\nThe NHL implemented mandatory safety netting above the glass behind and to the sides of both ends of the rink in all arenas. The netting has also been implemented by other hockey leagues and organizing bodies globally.

She was a daughter of Duke Maximilian Joseph in Bavaria (1808–1888) and Princess Ludovika of Bavaria. The ninth of ten children born to her parents, she was known as \"Sopherl\" within the family. \n\nShe was also a sister of Empress Elisabeth of Austria and Queen Maria Sophie of the Two Sicilies. After the marriage of her older sister, Duchess Mathilde Ludovika in Bavaria to 1861 to the Neapolitan Prince Luis of the Two Sicilies, her parents then looked for a suitable husband for Sophie Charlotte. \n\nShe was engaged to her cousin King Ludwig II of Bavaria. Their engagement was publicised on 22 January 1867, but after having repeatedly postponed the wedding date, Ludwig finally cancelled it in October, as it seemed she’d fallen in love with the court photographer, Edgar Hanfstaengl. \n\nOther proposed husbands included the renowned homosexual Archduke Ludwig Viktor of Austria, brother of both Franz Joseph I of Austria and Maximilian I of Mexico, as well as the future Luís I of Portugal. Another candidate was Duke Philipp of Württemberg, the first cousin of her eventual husband.\n\nShe refused all the candidates. She was sent to stay with her aunt, Amalie Auguste, then the Queen of Saxony as wife of King John of Saxony. It was in Saxony Sophie Charlotte met Prince Ferdinand of Orléans (12 July 1844 – 29 June 1910), \"Duke of Alençon\", the son of Prince Louis, Duke of Nemours and grandson of the late King Louis Philippe (died 1850). Soon after, on 28 September 1868, she married him at Possenhofen Castle, near Starnberg.\n\nShe had a good relationship with her husband as well as with her sister-in-law Princess Marguerite Adélaïde of Orléans, wife of Prince Władysław Czartoryski. Her mother in law, Princess Victoria of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, cousin of Queen Victoria, had died in 1857. Sophie Charlotte did not have an overly good relationship with her father-in-law, the widowed Duke of Nemours. \n\nThe year after their marriage, the ducal couple moved into Bushy House in the Teddington area of Southwest London, where Sophie Charlotte gave birth to her first child, Princess Louise of Orléans. \n\nSophie died in a fire at the Bazar de la Charité in Paris on 4 May 1897. She had refused rescue attempts, insisting that the girls working with her at the bazaar be saved first. Attempts to have her body identified by her personal maid having failed, her dentist, M. Lavanport, was called in. After two hours examining various bodies he identified hers on the basis of her gold fillings.\n\n\n"}

Many Christian authors have welcomed the scientific theory of the heat death of the universe as the ultimate fate of the universe as it was first proposed, while atheists and materialists back then commonly opposed the theory in favour of the idea that the universe and life in it would exist eternally. Nonetheless, in modern days, nontheists have largely come to accept the theory, while Christian eschatology is in conflict with the idea that entropy will be the predominant factor in determining the state of the far future, instead predicting God's creation of the New Earth and its existence into the far future. According to Mahayana Buddhism, an emanation of the Buddha-nature will appear in the material world in the far future.\n\nIn Hinduism, Brahma, the creator god, will live for 100 years, with each day of these years made up of two \"kalpas\", and each \"kalpa\" lasting 4.32 billion human years. The lifetime of Brahma, and thus the universe, is therefore predicted to last 315.36 trillion years.\n\nMayan religion often cites incredibly long time periods. Stela 1 at Coba marks the date of creation as in the Mesoamerican Long Count. According to Linda Schele, these 13s represent \"the starting point of a huge odometer of time\", with each acting as a zero and resetting to 1 as the numbers increase. Thus this inscription anticipates the current universe lasting at least 20×13×360 days, or roughly 2.687×10 years; a time span equal to 2 quintillion times the age of the universe as determined by cosmologists. Others have suggested, however, that this date marks creation as having occurred after that time span.\n\n"}

Bushman\n\nFrancis Xavier Bushman (January 10, 1883 – August 23, 1966) was an American film actor and director. His career as a matinee idol started in 1911 in the silent film \"His Friend's Wife.\" He gained a large female following and was one of the biggest stars of the 1910s and early 1920s.\n\nBushman, like many of his contemporaries, broke into the moving picture business via the stage. He was performing at Broncho Billy Anderson's Essanay Studios in Chicago, Illinois, where he was first noticed for his muscular, sculpted frame. He appeared in nearly 200 feature film roles—more than 175 films before 1920, and 17 in his screen debut year of 1911 alone. He also worked for the Vitagraph studio before signing with Metro in 1915.\n\nHe was born in Baltimore, Maryland. As a young man Bushman joined the Maryland Athletic Club and began a body building regimen that would give him his famous film physique. He cited Eugen Sandow as one of his body building influences. In New York, he worked as a sculptor's model, often posing in the nude in sessions. In 1902, he married seamstress Josephine Fladine Duval. By the launch of his film career, the couple had five children. In 1918, he was the subject of a national scandal as his affair with longtime costar Beverly Bayne became public. Three days after his divorce with Josephine was final, Bushman and Bayne were married; they would eventually have a son. Bushman and his studios had kept his marriage secret for fear of losing popularity. He was married four times.\n\nBushman eventually retained the talented services of Harry Reichenbach as his agent. When Bushman noted that he would be well suited to starring in the upcoming 1925 film, \"\", Reichenbach had a plan to increase his client's marketability. He took Bushman to see studio executives from the railway station and dropped pennies to the street from his pocket. Lots of people followed them, picking up the coins and following them. The crowd gave the studio executives an impression that Bushman was very popular and cast him as Messala. Bushman was concerned that playing a villain would affect his career, so he asked the advice of William S. Hart who had played the part on stage for years. \"Take it\", Hart advised—\"It's the best part in the play!\" Unlike Ramon Novarro, the star of the picture, Bushman knew how to properly drive a team of horses and a chariot without getting severely injured or killed in the process. When \"Ben Hur\" was remade in 1959, Charlton Heston had to learn the technique and quipped \"The only man in Hollywood who can drive a chariot is Francis X. Bushman—and he's too old!\"\n\nAt the peak of his career, he was advertised as \"The Handsomest Man in the World\". Bushman was also known as \"the King of Photoplay\" or \"the King of Movies\" before those titles were more popularly attached to Clark Gable.\n\nBushman was paid large salaries during his screen career, and donated the land upon which Sid Grauman erected his famous Chinese Theater. But his fortune was wiped out in the great crash of 1929, and his career as a movie star had had its run. After his film career had waned, Bushman made his broadcasting mark on the CBS Radio network's long-running dramatic serial entitled \"Those We Love\". In the soap opera, which ran from 1938 to 1945, he played the role of John Marshall, a father of the twins (played by Richard Cromwell and Nan Grey). Robert Cummings rounded out the cast. He took small roles in pictures and attempted to run a few small businesses, all of which lost money. On viewing one of his early films, Bushman is said to have remarked, \"My God, look at that! I'm putting all my emotion into my \"chin\"!\"\n\nIn later years, Bushman made assorted guest appearances on American television in the 1950s and 1960s. On February 6, 1958, he and his wife Iva Millicient Richardson appeared on the quiz show \"You Bet Your Life\" with Groucho Marx and won $1,000 by successfully answering questions in a geography quiz. He also performed on weekly sitcoms and television dramas, including \"Burns and Allen\", \"Peter Gunn\", \"Make Room for Daddy\", \"The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis\", \"Perry Mason\", \"The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet\", and \"Dr. Kildare\". Bushman guest-starred as well in 1966 on a two-part episode of \"Batman\". Both Bushman and Neil Hamilton, his co-star in \"The Grip of the Yukon\", appeared in the \"Batman\" episode—their first reunion acting together in 38 years. Bushman's role as a wealthy collector of silent pictures and promoter of a silent film festival was his last appearance on camera.\n\nFrancis X. Bushman is mentioned numerous times by the character \"Pearl Bodine\" in the first season of the Beverly Hillbillies. In the episode entitled, \"No Place Like Home,\" Pearl Bodine has written a song which she plays when the silent version of \"Ben-Hur\" is shown in the Clampett's hometown. In a later episode, when Pearl visits the Clampetts in Los Angeles, she speaks about hoping to meet Francis X. Bushman. In the episode \"Jed's Dilemma,\" \"Jed\" takes the family on a sightseeing tour of Beverly Hills. When passing a fancy home, Pearl wonders if it could be the home of a movie star, possibly Francis X. Bushman. Jed tells her no, because he got a good look in the yard and didn't see room for horses or a chariot.\n\nFrancis X. Bushman suffered a heart attack and died at his home in Pacific Palisades, California, on August 23, 1966. He was interred at Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery in Glendale, California.\n\n\"see Francis X. Bushman filmography\"\n\nHis son Ralph Everly Bushman (1903–1978) had a film career from the 1920s through the 1940s. Tall (6'4\") and good-looking, he was in over 40 films, often playing stuffy upper-class types or menacing gangsters. In \"Brown of Harvard\" (1926) he was cast against William Haines and Jack Pickford. He was often billed as \"Francis X. Bushman Jr.\"\n\nFrancis Bushman's granddaughter, Barbara Bushman Quine, married actor Harry Morgan. A grandson, Pat Conway (1931–1981), the son of film director Jack Conway and Bushman's daughter, Virginia, starred on the ABC western television series \"Tombstone Territory\".\n\nFor his contributions to the film industry, Bushman was inducted into the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1960 with a motion pictures star located at 1651 Vine Street.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1769652", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1769652", "title": "Future proof", "text": "Future proof\n\nFuture-proofing is the process of anticipating the future and developing methods of minimizing the effects of shocks and stresses of future events. Future-proofing is used in industries such as electronics, medical industry, industrial design, and, more recently, in design for climate change. The principles of future-proofing are extracted from other industries and codified as a system for approaching an intervention in an historic building.\n\nIn general, the term \"future-proof\" refers to the ability of something to continue to be of value into the distant future—that the item does not become obsolete.\n\nThe concept of future-proofing is the process of anticipating the future and developing methods of minimizing the effects of shocks and stresses of future events. This term is commonly found in electronics, data storage, and communications systems. It is also found in industrial design, computers, software, health care/medical, strategic sustainable development, strategic management consultancy and product design.\n\nStudy of the principles behind “future-proofing” both within the architecture, engineering and construction (AEC) industry and among outside industries can give vital information about the basis of future-proofing. This information can be distilled into several Principles which can be applied to a variety of areas.\n\nBased on the sources reviewed above, there are several principles of future-proofing that can be determined. Originally published in 2014 and updated in 2016 by Brian Rich, Principal of Richaven Architecture & Preservation, the Principles of Future-Proofing include:\n\n1. Prevent decay. \n\nPromote durable building materials and methods of construction that prevent premature deterioration of the built environment rather than accelerate deterioration. Interventions should use building materials of equal or greater durability than existing building fabric or design for disassembly and replacement. \n\n2. Stimulate flexibility and adaptability. \n\nFlexibility and adaptability of the environment and the attitudes towards it are essential its retention in a disposable society.\n\n3. Extend service life. \n\nExtend the service life of the built environment through regular inspections and maintenance so it may continue to contribute to economy, culture, and sustainable society.\n\n4. Fortify\n\nBuild engineered resilience by fortifying the built environment against climate change, extreme weather and natural hazards, and shortages of materials and energy.\n\n5. Increase redundancy.\n\nRedundant systems provide backup in the event that a primary system fails and allow a building to continue to function.\n\n6. Reduce obsolescence.\n\nPlanned obsolescence wouldn't be accepted. A proactive approach to preventing physical, functional, aesthetic, and sustainable obsolescence should be taken.\n\n7. Planning Ahead.\n\nThe demolition of existing building fabric by using optimum materials, construction phasing, and scalability through long range planning should be planned.\n\n8. Diversify.\n\nAllow for multiple stable states, like ecologically resilient systems. Include different sources, uses, capabilities, and economic models rather than one dominant trait.\n\n9. Be local and healthy.\n\nIncorporate non-toxic, renewable, local materials, parts, and labor into our built environment to ensure materials and manufacturing capabilities will be readily available in the future for efficient repairs.\n\n10. Consider life cycle benefits.\n\nConsider the long-term life cycle benefits of interventions in our built environment as opposed to demolition and disposal of existing historic building fabric.\n\n11. Take advantage of cultural heritage policy documents.\n\nTypically applied during the design phases of a project, cultural heritage policy documents provide excellent guidance for the long-term retention of an historic building.\n\n12. Promote understanding. \n\nRenovation, rehabilitation and other types of alterations to existing buildings should allow for understanding of the built environment and its place in our built heritage through minimal interventions that remain distinguishable from the original structure. Construction should respect historic fabric and seek to protect it.\n\nIn future-proof electrical systems buildings should have “flexible distribution systems to allow communication technologies to expand.” Image-related processing software should be flexible, adaptable, and programmable to be able to work with several different potential media in the future as well as to handle increasing file sizes. Image-related processing software should also be scalable and embeddable – in other words, the use or place where the software is employed is variable and the software needs to accommodate the variable environment. Higher processing integration is required to support future computational requirements in image processing as well.\n\nIn wireless phone networks, future-proofing of the network hardware and software systems deployed become critical because they are so costly to deploy that it is not economically viable to replace each system when changes in the network operations occur. Telecommunications system designers focus heavily on the ability of a system to be reused and to be flexible in order to continue competing in the marketplace.\n\nIn 1998, teleradiology (the ability to send radiology images such as x-rays and CAT scans over the internet to a reviewing radiologist) was in its infancy. Doctors developed their own systems, aware that technology would change over time. They consciously included future-proof as one of the characteristics that their investment would need to have. To these doctors, future-proof meant open modular architecture and interoperability so that as technology advanced it would be possible to update the hardware and software modules within the system without disrupting the remaining modules. This draws out two characteristics of future-proofing that are important to the built environment: interoperability and the ability to be adapted to future technologies as they were developed.\n\nIn industrial design, future-proofing designs seek to prevent obsolescence by analyzing the decrease in desirability of products. Desirability is measured in categories such as function, appearance, and emotional value. The products with more functional design, better appearance, and which accumulate emotional value faster tend to be retained longer and are considered future-proof. Industrial design ultimately strives to encourage people to buy less by creating objects with higher levels of desirability. Some of the characteristics of future-proof products that come out of this study include a timeless nature, high durability, aesthetic appearances that capture and hold the interest of buyers. Ideally, as an object ages, its desirability is maintained or increases with increased emotional attachment. Products that fit into society’s current paradigm of progress, while simultaneously making progress, also tend to have increased desirability. Industrial design teaches that future-proof products are timeless, have high durability, and develop ongoing aesthetic and emotional attraction.\n\nIn one region of New Zealand, Hawke’s Bay, a study was conducted to determine what would be required to future-proof the regional economy with specific reference to the water system. The study specifically sought to understand the existing and potential water demand in the region as well as how this potential demand might change with climate change and more intense land use. This information was used to develop demand estimates that would inform the improvements to the regional water system. Future-proofing thus includes forward planning for future development and increased demands on resources. However, the study focuses on future demands almost exclusively and does not address other components of future-proofing such as contingency plans to handle disastrous damage to the system or durability of the materials in the system.\n\nThe term “future-proofing” in relation to sustainable design began to be used in 2007. It has been used more often in sustainable design in relation to energy conservation to minimize the effects of future global temperature rise and/or rising energy costs. By far, the most common use of the term “future-proofing” is found in relation to sustainable design and energy conservation in particular. In this context, the term is usually referring to the ability of a structure to withstand impacts from future shortages in energy and resources, increasing world population, and environmental issues, by reducing the amount of energy consumption in the building. Understanding the use of “future-proofing” in this field assists in development of the concept of future-proofing as applied to existing structures.\n\nIn the realm of sustainable environmental issues, future-proof is used generally to describe the ability of a design to resist the impact of potential climate change due to global warming. Two characteristics describe this impact. First, “dependency on fossil fuels will be more or less completely eliminated and replaced by renewable energy sources.” Second, “Society, infrastructure and the economy will be well adapted to the residual impacts of climate change.”\n\nIn the design of low energy consuming dwellings, “buildings of the future should be sustainable, low-energy and able to accommodate social, technological, economic and regulatory changes, thus maximizing life cycle value.” The goal is to “reduce the likelihood of a prematurely obsolete building design.”\n\nIn Australia, research commissioned by the Health Infrastructure New South Wales explored “practical, cost-effective, design-related strategies for “future-proofing” the buildings of a major Australian health department.” This study concluded that “a focus on a whole life-cycle approach to the design and operation of health facilities clearly would have benefits.” By designing in flexibility and adaptability of structures, one may “defer the obsolescence and consequent need for demolition and replacement of many health facilities, thereby reducing overall demand for building materials and energy.”\n\nThe ability of a building’s structural system to accommodate projected climate changes and whether “non-structural [behavioral] adaptations might have a great enough effect to offset any errors from… …an erroneous choice of climate change projection.” The essence of the discussion is whether adjustments in the occupant’s behavior can future-proof the building against errors in judgment in estimates of the impacts of global climate change. There are clearly many factors involved and the paper does not go into them in exhaustive detail. However, it is clear that “soft adaptations” such as changes in behavior (such as turning lights off, opening windows for cooling) can have a significant impact on the ability of a building to continue to function as the environment around it changes. Thus adaptability is an important criterion in the concept of future-proofing” buildings. Adaptability is a theme that begins to come through in many of the other studies on future-proofing.\n\nThere are examples of sustainable technologies that can be used in existing buildings to take “advantage of up-to-date technologies in the enhancement of the energetic performance of buildings.” The intent is to understand how to follow the new European Energy Standards to attain the best in energy savings. The subject speaks to historic buildings and specifically of façade renewal, focusing on energy conservation. These technologies include “improvement of thermal and acoustic performance, solar shadings, passive solar energy systems, and active solar energy systems.” The main value of this study to future-proofing is not the specific technologies, but rather the concept of working with an existing façade by overlapping it rather than modifying the existing one. The employment of ventilated facades, double skin glass facades, and solar shadings take advantage of the thermal mass of existing buildings commonly found in Italy. These techniques not only work with thermal mass walls, but also protect damaged and deteriorating historic facades to varying degrees.\n\nUse of the term “future-proofing” has been uncommon in the AEC industry, especially with relation to historic buildings until recently. In 1997, the MAFF laboratories at York, England were described in an article as “future-proof” by being flexible enough to adapt to developing rather than static scientific research. The standard building envelope and MEP services provided could be tailored for each type of research to be performed. In 2009, “future-proof” was used in reference to “megatrends” that were driving education of planners in Australia. A similar term, “fatigue proofing,” was used in 2007 to describe steel cover plates in bridge construction that would not fail due to fatigue cracking. In 2012, a New Zealand-based organization outlined 8 principles of future-proof buildings: smart energy use, increased health and safety, increased life cycle duration, increased quality of materials and installation, increased security, increased sound control for noise pollution, adaptable spatial design, and reduced carbon footprint.\n\nAnother approach to future-proofing suggests that only in more extensive refurbishments to a building should future-proofing be considered. Even then, the proposed time horizon for future-proofing events is 15 to 25 years. The explanation for this particular time horizon for future-proof improvements is unclear. This author believes that time horizons for future-proofing are much more dependent on the potential service life of the structure, the nature of the intervention, and several other factors. The result is that time horizons for future-proof interventions could vary from 15 years (rapidly changing technology interventions) to hundreds of years (major structural interventions).\n\nIn the valuation of real estate, there are three traditional forms of obsolescence which affect property values: physical, functional, and aesthetic. Physical obsolescence occurs when the physical material of the property deteriorates to the point where it needs to be replaced or renovated. Functional obsolescence occurs when the property is no longer capable of serving the intended use or function. Aesthetic obsolescence occurs when fashions change, when something is no longer in style. A potential fourth form has emerged as well: sustainable obsolescence. Sustainable obsolescence proposes to be a combination of the above forms in many ways. Sustainable obsolescence occurs when a property no longer meets one or more sustainable design goals. Obsolescence is an important characteristic of future-proofing a property because it emphasizes the need for the property to continue to be viable. Though not explicitly stated, the shocks and stresses to a property in the future are one potential way in which a property may become not future-proof. It is also important to note that each form of obsolescence can be either curable or incurable. The separation of curable and incurable obsolescence is ill defined because the amount of effort one is willing to put into correcting it varies depending on several factors: people, time, budget, availability, etc.\n\nHowever, the most informative realm within the AEC industry is the concept of resiliency. A new buzzword among preservationists and sustainable designers, resiliency has several clearly identified principles. In its common usage, “resilience” describes the ability to recoil or spring back into shape after bending, stretching, or being compressed. In ecology, the term “resilience” the capacity of an ecosystem to tolerate disturbance without collapsing into a qualitatively different state. The principles of a resilient built environment include:\n\n\nOne reasonable approach to future-proof sustainable cities is an integrated multi-disciplinary combination of mitigation and adaptation to raise the level of resilience of the city. In the context of urban environments, resilience is less dependent on an exact understanding of the future than on tolerance of uncertainty and broad programs to absorb the stresses that this environment might face. The scale of the context is important in this view: events are viewed as regional stresses rather than local. The intent for a resilient urban environment is to keep many options open, emphasize diversity in the environment, and perform long-range planning that accounts for external systemic shocks. Options and diversity are strategies similar to ecological resilience discussed above. This approach again points out the importance of flexibility, adaptability, and diversity to future-proofing urban environments.\n\nThe design of interventions in existing buildings which are not detrimental to the future of the building may be called “future-proofing.” Future-proofing includes the careful consideration of how “sustainable” alterations to historic structures affect the original historic material of the structure. This effect is significant for long service life structures in order to prevent them from deteriorating and being demolished. This effect is especially significant in designated structures where the intent is to do no harm to the historic fabric of the structure.\n\nHistoric buildings are particularly good candidates for future-proofing because they have already survived for 50 to 100 years or more. Given their performance to date and appropriate interventions, historic building structures are likely to be able to last for centuries. This durability is evident in the buildings of Europe and Asia which have survived centuries and millennia. Extension of the service life of our existing building stock through sensitive interventions reduces energy consumption, decreases material waste, retains embodied energy, and promotes a long-term relationship with our built environment that is critical to the future survival of the human species on this planet.\n\nFuture-proofing of designated historic structures adds a level of complexity to the concepts of future-proofing in other industries as described above. All interventions on historic structures must comply with the Secretary’s Standards for the Treatment of Historic Properties. The degree of compliance and the Standard selected may vary depending on jurisdiction, type of intervention, significance of the structure, and the nature of the intended interventions. The underlying principle is that no harm is done to the structure in the course of the intervention which would damage the structure or make it unavailable to future generations. In addition, it is important that the historic portions of the structure be able to be understood and comprehended apart from the newer interventions.\n\nFuture-proofing is also a new methodology to address vulnerabilities of infrastructure systems. For example, analysis of domestic water infrastructure in the Southern California and Tijuana area completed by Rich and Gattuso in 2016 demonstrates that potential vulnerabilities include levee failures, material deterioration, and climate change. With changes in the hydrologic conditions due to climate change, there will be increased emphasis on ensuring that the water infrastructure systems continue to function after a natural hazard event where specific components or facilities in the system are compromised. In addition to the aqueducts and pipelines, local or regional infrastructure such as reservoirs, dams, local pipeline systems, pump stations, water treatment, and desalination facilities could be impacted by any of several potential natural hazards. Imported water via aqueducts and pipelines stands as the most significant vulnerability due to the high volumes required, the length of travel, and the nature of the delivery system. Conventional piping infrastructure is at risk for damage in a seismic event as the materials do not generally react well to the shear stresses brought upon by earthquakes.\n\nMany new potable water technologies, such as desalination, physical treatment, chemical treatment, and biological treatment systems, can help to address these vulnerabilities. However, development of a future-proof infrastructure system con have longer lasting benefits. The San Diego Regional Water System has been implementing a program of infrastructure improvements to ensure plentiful water sources in the future. These include developed an emergency storage program aimed at providing a 75% service level and includes several key elements of the regional water system. The regional water authority is also in the middle of a multi-decade long project to reline the existing pipeline system to increase their service life (Water-technology.net, 2012). the region also seeks to supplement the water supply through diversification of sources of water which will support continued growth of the regional population. Priorities for development of new water sources (in order of preference) are seawater desalination, indirect potable reuse (wastewater recycling), and additional water from the Colorado River. These projects and improvements are examples of ways in which a water infrastructure systems may be developed in a future-proof way while also addressing hazard mitigation concerns, long term adaptive cycles.\n\nThe strategies being employed in San Diego and Tijuana are future-proofing their potable water infrastructure systems by including seismic loops and flexible over-sized systems to prevent damage in seismic events accommodate future changes in use and population growth. The San Diego Regional Water System is pursuing strategies that diversify and increase redundancy of water supplies by including metropolitan water district sources, irrigation water transfer, canal lining to prevent leakage, conservation or reduced consumption, recycled wastewater, desalination, groundwater sources, and surface water sources. Development of new water tunnels and relining water mains, branches, and canals extends the service life, and fortifies the system while reducing physical and functional obsolescence and preventing further deterioration of the system. Ongoing maintenance, diversification efforts, capacity development, and planning for future requirements will ensure an ongoing future-proof supply of water for the region.\n\nLife Cycle Assessment/Analysis (LCA) can be used as an indicator of long term impacts to the environment, and an important aspect of future-proofing our built environment, quantifying the impacts of initial construction, periodic renovation, and regular maintenance of a building over an extended time span. A study completed published in 2015 by Rich compares the impacts of gymnasiums constructed of different building materials over a 200 year period using the Athena Impact Estimator. Rich developed the phrase \"First Impacts\" to describe the environmental impacts of new construction from raw material extraction to occupancy of the building. When the environmental impacts of maintenance and replacement are considered with first impacts for a building, a complete picture of the environmental impacts are formed.\n\nWhile choice of materials is important to initial impacts of a building or product, less durable materials lead to more frequent maintenance, operating expenses and replacement. By contrast, more durable materials may have more significant initial impacts, but those impacts will pay off in the long run by reducing maintenance, repairs, and operations expenses. Durability of all components of a building system should have equivalent service lives or allow for disassembly in order to maintain the shorter service life materials. This allows retention of materials that have longer service lives rather than disposing of them when removed to perform maintenance. Proper maintenance of a building is critical to long term service life because it prevents deterioration of less durable materials that can expose additional materials to deterioration.\n\n\n21. http://www.svconline.com/news/news/telecom-giant-shines-new-facility/369946 The term \"future Proof\" used as it relates to the AV industry by Anthony Zamarin in an article published in ProAV magazine June 2007\n\n"}

It supports congressional oversight by:\n\nProducts of GAO includes the following:\nGAO also produce special publications on specific issues of general interest to many Americans, such as its report on the fiscal future of the United States, GAO’s role in the federal bid protest process, and critical issues for congressional consideration related to improving the nation's image abroad.\n\nThe GAO was established as the General Accounting Office by the Budget and Accounting Act of 1921. The act required the head of the GAO to \"investigate, at the seat of government or elsewhere, all matters relating to the receipt, disbursement, and application of public funds, and shall make to the President ... and to Congress ... reports [and] recommendations looking to greater economy or efficiency in public expenditures\". According to the GAO's current mission statement, the agency exists to support the Congress in meeting its constitutional responsibilities and to help improve the performance and ensure the accountability of the federal government for the benefit of the American people.\n\nThe name was changed in 2004 to Government Accountability Office by the GAO Human Capital Reform Act to better reflect the mission of the office. While most other countries have government entities similar to the GAO, their focus (with the exceptions of the Taiwanese Control Yuan and the Israeli State Comptroller) is primarily on conducting financial audits. The GAO's auditors conduct not only financial audits, but also engage in a wide assortment of performance audits.\n\nOver the years, the GAO has been referred to as \"The Congressional Watchdog\" and \"The Taxpayers' Best Friend\" for its frequent audits and investigative reports that have uncovered waste and inefficiency in government. News media often draw attention to the GAO's work by publishing stories on the findings, conclusions and recommendations of its reports. Members of Congress also frequently cite the GAO's work in statements to the press, congressional hearings, and floor debates on proposed legislation. In 2007 the Partnership for Public Service ranked the GAO second on its list of the best places to work in the federal government and \"Washingtonian\" magazine included the GAO on its 2007 list of great places to work in Washington, a list that encompasses the public, private, and non-profit sectors.\n\nThe GAO is headed by the comptroller general of the U.S., a professional and non-partisan position in the U.S. government. The comptroller general is appointed by the president, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, for a 15-year, non-renewable term. The president selects a nominee from a list of at least three individuals recommended by an eight-member bipartisan, bicameral commission of congressional leaders. During such term, the comptroller general has standing to pursue litigation to compel access to federal agency information. The comptroller general may not be removed by the president, but only by Congress through impeachment or joint resolution for specific reasons. Since 1921, there have been only seven comptrollers general, and no formal attempt has ever been made to remove a comptroller general.\n\nLabor-management relations became fractious during the 9-year tenure of the 7th comptroller general, David M. Walker. On September 19, 2007, GAO analysts voted by a margin of two to one (897–445), in a 75% turnout, to establish the first union in the GAO's 86-year history. The analysts voted to affiliate with the International Federation of Professional and Technical Engineers (IFPTE), a member union of the AFL-CIO. There are more than 1,800 analysts in the GAO analysts bargaining unit; the local voted to name itself IFPTE Local 1921, in honor of the date of the GAO's establishment. On February 14, 2008, the GAO analysts' union approved its first-ever negotiated pay contract with management; of just over 1,200 votes, 98 percent were in favor of the contract.\nThe GAO also establishes standards for audits of government organizations, programs, activities, and functions, and of government assistance received by contractors, nonprofit organizations, and other nongovernmental organizations. These standards, often referred to as Generally Accepted Government Auditing Standards (GAGAS), are to be followed by auditors and audit organizations when required by law, regulation, agreement, contract, or policy. These standards pertain to auditors' professional qualifications, the quality of audit effort, and the characteristics of professional and meaningful audit reports.\n\nIn 1992 the GAO hosted XIV INCOSAI, the fourteenth triennial convention of the International Organization of Supreme Audit Institutions (INTOSAI).\n\nGAO is a United States government electronic data provider, as all of its reports are available on its website, except for certain reports whose distribution is limited to official use in order to protect national and homeland security. The variety of topics reported on range from Federal Budget and Fiscal Issues to Financial Management, Education, Retirement Issues, Defense, Homeland Security, Administration of Justice, Health Care, Information Management and Technology, Natural Resources, Environment, International Affairs, Trade, Financial Markets, Housing, Government Management and Human Capital. GAO often produces highlights of its reports that serve as a statement for the record for various subcommittees of the United States Congress.\n\nMost GAO studies and reports are initiated by requests from members of Congress, including requests mandated in statute, and so reflect concerns of current political import, for example to study the impact of a government-wide hiring freeze. Many reports are issued periodically and take a long view of U.S. agencies' operations. GAO also produces annual reports on key issues such as Duplication and Cost savings and High-Risk Update.\n\nThe GAO prepares some 900 reports annually. GAO publishes reports and information relating to, \"inter alia\":\n\nEach year the GAO issues an audit report on the financial statements of the United States Government. The 2010 Financial Report of the United States Government was released on December 21, 2010. The accompanying press release states that the GAO 'cannot render an opinion on the 2010 consolidated financial statements of the federal government, because of widespread material internal control weaknesses, significant uncertainties, and other limitations'.\n\nAs part of its initiative to advocate sustainability, the GAO publishes a Federal Fiscal Outlook Report, as well as data relating to the deficit. The US deficit is presented on a cash rather than accruals basis, although the GAO notes that the accrual deficit 'provides more information on the longer-term implications of the government's annual operations'.\nIn FY 2010, the US federal government had a net operating cost of $2,080 billion, although since this includes accounting provisions (estimates of future liabilities), the cash deficit is $1,294 billion.\n\nThe most recent GAO plan, for 2010-2015, sets out four goals, namely to address: (1) Current and Emerging Challenges to the Well-being and Financial Security of the American People; (2) Changing Security Threats and the Challenges of Global Interdependence; (3) Transformation of the Federal Government to Address National Challenges; (4) Maximization of the Value of the GAO.\n\nForensic Audits and Investigative Service (FAIS)\n\nThe Forensic Audits and Investigative Service (FAIS) team provides Congress with high-quality forensic audits and investigations of fraud, waste, and abuse; other special investigations; and security and vulnerability assessments. Its work cuts across a diverse array of government programs administered by IRS, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the Department of Veterans Affairs, and the Department of Homeland Security, among others.\n\nAfter the closing of the Office of Technology Assessment (OTA) in 1995, Congress directed GAO to conduct a technology assessment (TA) pilot program. Between 2002 and 2006, four reports were completed– use of biometrics for border security, cyber security for critical infrastructure protection, technologies for protecting structures in wildland fires, and cargo container security technologies. In the first report, GAO found that while biometrics technologies could be used to secure the border, they had limitations in fingerprinting and facial recognition systems. An immediate impact of the report was a congressional testimony on the use of biometrics which, in turn, helped to inform U.S. national security reform efforts. GAO reports, which are made available to the public, have become essential vehicles for understanding science and technology (S&T) implications of policies considered by the Congress.\n\nSince 2007, Congress has established a permanent TA function within GAO. This new operational role augments GAO’s performance audits related to S&T issues, including effectiveness and efficiency of U.S. federal programs. In 2010, GAO joined European Parliamentary Technology Assessment (EPTA) as an associate member. In the last three years, GAO has completed TA reports on three topics, the most recent one being released in 2011 – rail security, climate engineering, and alternate neutron detectors. In the climate engineering report, Congress requested GAO to examine three areas: the current S&T state of climate engineering, views of experts on the future of climate engineering research, and potential public responses to climate engineering. When the GAO receives a request to conduct TA, it follows five phases: Acceptance, Planning, Data Gathering and Analysis, Product development and Distribution and Results. Phases one and two include selecting the topic and initiating the TA plan while the other ones are respectively: conducting TA, followed by developing the report and ensuring its accuracy and integrity, and finally receiving feedback from Congress and developing lessons learned to enhance the TA process.\n\nThe GAO describes the TA as providing \"thorough and balanced analysis of critical technological innovations that affect our society, the environment, and the economy\" explaining \"the consequences that each featured technology will have on federal agencies and departments, and their wider impacts on American society\". This broad working definition enables GAO analysts to utilize TA as a tool for policy analysis. Technology assessments at GAO are conducted in accordance with GAO’s quality assurance framework. GAO initiates technology assessments through congressional mandates, requests from congressional leaders, and through the authority of U.S. Comptroller General.\n\nThe Technology Assessment section of GAO's website offers the latest TA reports and videos.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

(1826 – 21 August 1899), generally referred to as H. T. Whittell or H. Thomas Whittell, was a medical doctor in South Australia and Adelaide's City Coroner.\n\nWhittell was born in Warwick, England, and had a happy childhood. He was educated at one of the private schools in Leamington Spa. At age nineteen he entered Queen's College, Birmingham, to study medicine and in his spare time read books about legal cases. He received his diploma as a member of the Royal College of Surgeons, and served some time as house surgeon at Queen's Hospital. He spent ten years practising in Birmingham, then obtained his M.D. degree at Aberdeen.\n\nHe arrived in Adelaide in May 1858 and was soon an active member of the Total Abstinence Society.He had a very busy practice, first operating from his home on Grenfell Street, near the Sturt Hotel, then ten years later on North Terrace.\nAdelaide experienced an outbreak of diphtheria around July to September 1859, and Whittell, who had had some experience of an epidemic in England shortly before he left, was kept busy. By a remarkable piece of timing, his booklet on the disease appeared in the bookshops in August that year. He initially had a solo practice, then after the death of Dr. Anton Bayer in 1866, joined his erstwhile partner Dr. William Gosse (c. 1813–1883) in partnership for about six years then returned to a solo practice.\nIn 1879, suffering perhaps from overwork, he took on Dr. J. Davies Thomas (c. 1845–1893) as a partner. At the end of that year he sold the practice to Dr. Thomas, and sought recuperation in an extended trip to Europe. He remained in Europe for two and a half years, and became vitally interested in the recent microbial discoveries and developed a passion for microscopy. He associated with the leading microscopical men at the time when bacteriology was beginning to have a marked effect upon the views of the pathologists in London. He met Robert Koch and Louis Pasteur, the great scientists whose discoveries were attracting worldwide attention, and made a lasting impression on Whittell.\n\nWhittell succeeded Gosse as President of the Central Board of Health on 20 August 1883, and applied microscopy to the solution of many problems of public sanitation.\nIn January 1886, as part of a series of retrenchments, he was appointed Registrar of Births, Marriages and Deaths to replace J. F. Cleland. This was in addition to his Board of Health duties without any addition to his salary.\nOn the (perhaps forced) resignation of Thomas Ward (1815 – 28 December 1888) in October 1888, Whittell was appointed City Coroner on top of his duties at the Central Board of Health, and in addition was made Vaccination Officer and Inspector of Anatomy. \nDespite his multiple roles, Whittell was being seriously discussed by Parliament for retrenchment. He was replaced as Registrar General of Births, Deaths and Marriages by George Hamilton Ayliffe, son of Thomas Hamilton Ayliffe, in January 1889.\n\nIt was perhaps as City Coroner that Dr. Whittell rendered the greatest official service to the colony. This is a job which on top of medical knowledge is required a great deal of tact and sensitivity, qualities which the obituarist declares, Whittell had in abundance, together with a working knowledge of the law. He was also considerate of witnesses, never allowing an inquest to extend into a second day if it could be dealt with in one.\n\nHe died peacefully after a few months' illness; his remains were buried at the West Terrace Cemetery.\nHis wife died of pneumonia a few months later, and his son may have been written out of his will, as the bulk of his estate was inherited by his daughter Anna.\n\n\n\nWhittell married Caroline ?? ( – 8 October 1899) on 3 August 1848. They had a son and a daughter:\nThey had a home on East Terrace, Adelaide.\n\nThere is no reason to believe he was related to H. M. Whittell, the great Australian ornithologist.\n"}

It was the second film adaptation of Harry Segall's play of the same name, being preceded by \"Here Comes Mr. Jordan\" (1941).\n\nThe film was nominated for nine Academy Awards. The cast reunites Beatty with Julie Christie and Jack Warden, who also starred together in \"McCabe & Mrs. Miller\" (1971) and \"Shampoo\" (1975), respectively.\n\nIn 2001, a third film adaptation of the play was done, titled \"Down to Earth\", sharing its name with the sequel to 1941's Here Comes Mr. Jordan.\n\nJoe Pendleton, a backup quarterback for the American football team Los Angeles Rams, is looking forward to leading his team to the Super Bowl. While riding his bicycle through the older west side of tunnel one on Kanan-Dume road in Malibu, an over-anxious guardian angel (known only as The Escort) on his first assignment sees Joe heading into the tunnel, and a large truck heading into the other end of the tunnel towards Joe and his bicycle. The Escort plucks Joe out of his body early, in the mistaken belief that Joe was about to be killed. Pendleton immediately arrives in the afterlife.\n\nOnce there, he refuses to believe that his time was up and, upon investigation, the mysterious Mr. Jordan discovers that he is right: he was not destined to die until much later (10:17 am on March 20, 2025, to be exact). Unfortunately, his body has already been cremated, so a new body must be found. After rejecting several possibilities of men who are about to die, Joe is finally persuaded to accept the body of a millionaire industrialist. Leo Farnsworth has just been drugged and drowned in his bathtub by his cheating gold digger wife Julia Farnsworth and her lover, Farnsworth's personal secretary, Tony Abbott.\n\nJulia and Tony are naturally confused when Leo reappears, alive and well. Leo buys the Los Angeles Rams to lead them to the Super Bowl as their quarterback. To succeed, he must first convince, and then secure the aid of, long-time friend and trainer Max Corkle to get his new body in shape. At the same time, he falls in love with an environmental activist, Betty Logan, who disapproves of the original Farnsworth's policies and actions.\n\nWith the Rams about to play in the Super Bowl, the characters all face a crisis. Mr. Jordan informs Farnsworth that he must give up this body as well. Farnsworth resists, but hints to Betty that she might someday meet someone else and should think of him. Julia and Abbott continue their murderous plans, and Abbott shoots Farnsworth dead. The Rams are forced to start another quarterback, Tom Jarrett, in the climactic game. A detective, Lieutenant Krim, interrogates the suspects while they watch the game on television. With the help of Corkle, he gets Julia and Abbott to incriminate each other.\n\nAfter a brutal hit on the field, Jarrett is himself killed. With Mr. Jordan's help, Joe then occupies his final body. He is shown snapping to life in Jarrett's body, then leading the Rams to victory. During the team's post-game celebration, Mr. Jordan seemingly removes Joe's memory of his past life and departs. Joe becomes Tom Jarrett and the cosmic balance is restored. The one left crestfallen is Corkle, who realizes that Jarrett living without any memory of being \"Joe\", is really the death of Joe in a way. Jarrett bumps into Betty while leaving the stadium. They strike up a conversation, and Betty appears to recognize something of Joe in this stranger Jarrett. This is just as earlier in the film Joe had asked Betty to watch for and recognize in a stranger she might meet one day, implying something of Joe still exists even without his memory.\n\n\nA number of former Los Angeles Rams players have cameo roles in the film, including Deacon Jones, Les Josephson, Jack Snow, Jim Boeke and Charley Cowan.\n\nIn addition to the former players, some well-known sportscasters also appear, playing familiar roles. Bryant Gumbel is seen in the background of one scene on TV, delivering a sportscast. Curt Gowdy and Al DeRogatis can be heard doing the Super Bowl play-by-play commentary. Dick Enberg conducts an abortive post-game interview of Joe Pendleton/Tom Jarrett.\n\nBeatty lobbied hard for Cary Grant to accept the role of Mr. Jordan, going so far as to have Grant's ex-wife, Dyan Cannon, who stars as Julia Farnsworth, urge him to take the part. Although Grant was tempted, he ultimately decided not to end his retirement from filmmaking.\n\nFuture game-show host Peter Tomarken appears as a reporter in the film.\n\nBeatty initially wanted Muhammad Ali to play the central character, but because of Ali's continued commitment to boxing, Beatty changed the character from a boxer to an American football player and played it himself. The type of instrument he played was also changed; in \"Here Comes Mr. Jordan\", Pendelton essays \"The Last Rose of Summer\" on the alto saxophone, while in the 1978 film he plays \"Ciribiribin\" on a soprano sax. The music during the comic training scene with Joe and the servants at the Farnsworth mansion as well as the later training session with the Rams is Handel's Sonata No. 3 in F Major, performed by Paul Brodie (sopranino saxophone) and Antonin Kubalek (piano). The main theme is the song \"Heaven Can Wait\" performed by Dave Grusin and the London Symphony Orchestra. Neil Diamond composed a song entitled \"Heaven Can Wait\" specifically for the film that he thought would be a good theme song, but Beatty declined to use it. The Paul McCartney and Wings song \"Did We Meet Somewhere Before?\" was also considered for as a theme song for the film, but was eventually ruled out. It later appeared in the Ramones film \"Rock and Roll High School\" (1979).\n\nThe Super Bowl game (Pittsburgh Steelers vs. the Rams) was filmed during halftime of the San Diego Chargers vs Los Angeles Rams preseason game at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum on September 1, 1977. (About a year and a half after the film's release, in January 1980, the Rams and Steelers would meet in real life in Super Bowl XIV.)\n\nOn Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 89% based on 36 reviews, with an average rating of 7.7/10. The site’s critical consensus reads, \"A throwback to the high-gloss screwball comedies of the 1940s, \"Heaven Can Wait\" beguiles with seamless production values and great comic relief from Charles Grodin and Dyan Cannon.\" Metacritic gave the film a weighted average score of 72 out of 100 based on 10 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".\n\nThe film won the Academy Award for Best Art Direction (Art Direction: Paul Sylbert and Edwin O'Donovan; Set Decoration: George Gaines), and was nominated for Best Actor in a Leading Role (Warren Beatty), Best Actor in a Supporting Role (Jack Warden), Best Actress in a Supporting Role (Dyan Cannon), Best Cinematography, Best Director, Best Music, Original Score, Best Picture and Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay (Elaine May and Warren Beatty).\n\n\n"}

It was introduced by german zoologist Oscar Hertwig in 1884. The rule emphasizes the cell shape to be a default mechanism of spindle apparatus orientation. Hertwig's rule predicts cell division orientation, that is important for tissue architecture, cell fate and morphogenesis.\n\nIn Hertwig's experiments the orientation of divisions of the frog egg was studied. Frog egg has a round shape and the first division occur in the random orientation. Hertwig compressed the egg between two parallel plates. The compression forced egg to change its shape from round to elongated. Hertwig noticed that elongated egg divides not randomly, but orthogonal to its long axis. The new daughter cells were formed along the longest axis of the cell. That observation got name of 'Hertwig's rule' or 'long axis rule'.\n\nRecent studies in animal and plant systems support the 'long axis rule'. The studied systems include the mouse embryo, Drosophila epithelium, Xenopus blastomeres (Strauss 2006), MCDK cell monolayers and plants (Gibson et al., 2011).\nThe mechanism of the 'long axis rule' relies on interphase cell long axis sensing. However, during division many animal cell types undergo cell rounding, causing the long axis to disappear as the cell becomes round. It is at this rounding stage that the decision on the orientation of the cell division is made by the spindle apparatus. The spindle apparatus then rotates in the round cell and after several minutes the spindle position is stabilised preferentially along the interphase cell long axis. The cell then divides along the spindle apparatus orientation. The first insights into how cells could remember their long axis came from studies on the Drosophila epithelium. The study indicates Cell junction#Tricellular junctions (TCJ) participation in determining the spindle orientation. TCJ localized at the regions where three or more cells meet. As cells round up during mitosis, TCJs serve as spatial landmarks. The orientation of TCJ remains stable, independent of the shape changes associated with cell rounding. The position of TCJ encode information about interphase cell shape anisotropy to orient division in the rounded mitotic cell. However this study is limited to only one type of epithelia in \"Drosophila melanogaster\" and has not been shown to be true in other epithelial types.\n\nIt has been shown that mechanical force can cause cells to divide against their long axis and instead with the direction of mechanical stretch in MDCK monolayers. \n\nCell divisions along 'long axis' are proposed to be implicated in the morphogenesis, tissue response to stresses and tissue architecture.\nDivision along the long cell axis reduces global tissue stress more rapidly than random divisions or divisions along the axis of mechanical stress. Long-axis division contributes to the formation of isotropic cell shapes within the monolayer.\n"}

In 1839 the British government began a programme of recruiting Indian labourers in Calcutta to be sent to Trinidad. They bound themselves to work as indentured labourers for a set number of years on the plantations. The mostly Hindu and Muslim labourers were required to work seven and a half hours a day, six days a week for three years, receiving about 13 cents a day for their work. At first, half of the recruits were women but, in 1840, the proportion was reduced to a third of the number of men. In 1844, the period of indenture was extended to five years with a guarantee that, if they wished, they would get a free passage home at the end of their service. In 1853 the law was again amended to allow the indentured labourers to re-indenture themselves for a second five-year term or, if they wished, to commute any portion of their contract by repayment of a proportionate part of their indenture fee.\nIndustrial unrest on the plantations was gaining momentum to be followed by a deepening depression in the sugar industry in 1884. This atmosphere was also fuelled by frequent strikes. In the previous year, met with restrictions on the use of torches the African community celebrating ‘Canboulay’ reacted and this resulted in violence.\n\nThe decision by the authorities to prohibit the Indians from entering the towns with their processions, which began, on the estates ‘were regarded by the Indians as an arbitrary and unjust measure’. The Indians protested with a petition led by the Hindu Sookhoo and 31 others.\n\nOn 26 October Administrator John Bushe consulted the Executive Council on ‘the final arrangements to be made for preserving order during the Hosea’. Acting Colonial Secretary, Mr. Pyne informed the Inspector Commandant of Police, Captain Baker instructing him on the 'deployment of police, marines, from the HMS Dido, and a volunteer force'. 27 October – Capt Baker personally monitors the situation. The next day Baker reports that the Indians would make no attempt to enter San Fernando. In a series of telegrams Baker attempts to avoid an armed confrontation with the Indians, however Mr. Pyne appeared bent on such a confrontation to show the Indians who was in charge. (Shantal Ramnarine)\n\nAt midday the first procession of 6,000 was sighted approaching San Fernando reaching Cross Crossing about 2:30 pm and proceeded along to the entrance of Cipero Street. There the Indians met by British troops under Major Bowles of the First North Staffordshire Regiment. The local magistrate, a Mr. Child, read the Riot Act and when the crowd failed to disperse, Child ordered the police to fire upon the unarmed Indians. Two volleys were fired into the crowd.\n\nAt the Mon Repos Junction of the Princes Town and Circular roads a similar fate was to meet the Indians there. The procession was in sight about 3:30 pm. Captain Baker gave the order to fire a single volley of bullets after the Riot Act was read.\n\nAnthony reports that nine people were killed and 100 wounded at Toll Gate (on the south side of the town), while others were injured at Mon Repos (on the eastern side of the town) and at Pointe-à-Pierre Road on the north. Indian historian Prabhu P. Mohapatra suggests a higher figure of 22 dead, and over a hundred injured.\n\n"}

After committing several murders, he faced off against Batman and the new Robin, Jason Todd, who defeated him.\n\nIn these original, pre-Crisis appearances, Killer Croc resembled a powerfully built man covered entirely in green scales, but was still basically human in his facial proportions and build. He was also originally depicted as killing Jason Todd's parents (this was later retconned to make Two-Face their murderer). His appearance and personality have become increasingly bestial, explained in the comics that his disease has slowly robbed him of all identifiable human traits. In his most recent appearances, he has an elongated snout and tail.\n\nKiller Croc escaped custody and began living with a group of homeless people and committed thefts in Gotham City to support his new family. Batman tracked him down and Croc went into a homicidal rage. When new water tunnels were built, which would flood Killer Croc's new home, Croc seemingly sacrificed himself to hold the water back when they finally were open.\n\nIn reality, Croc was buried under rubble and was freed from his prison by storm drains. Killer Croc survived on rats and was isolated for months, driving him further into madness. Croc went on a rampage after a confrontation with a vagrant and Croc wound up in a shopping mall. After delivering several blows to Croc, Batman is distracted by a glimpse of Bane. Croc then grabs Batman and tries to break his back. He fails, and Bane pits himself against Croc, breaking his arms. He is then put back into Arkham Asylum.\n\nWhen Bane breaks the inmates out of Arkham Asylum in the \"\" saga, Croc attempts to get revenge on Bane. While in the sewers, he smells Bane and goes after him and the two fight each other atop a ledge. Bane casually breaks one of Croc's arms again, but Croc keeps fighting until the ledge they are standing on breaks and the two fall into the sewers. The fight ends up as a draw. Croc later returns, attacking the docks to try and lure Robin out, but is defeated by Dick Grayson (now acting as Batman after Bruce defeated Valley before taking time off for self-analysis) without realizing that he is facing a new Batman. Killer Croc is left for the police in a fishing net.\n\nIn a storyline that ran in \"Batman\" #521 and #522, Croc is summoned by a paranormal force to break out of Arkham and make his way to the Louisiana swamps. Batman follows him there, only to find that the mysterious force is actually Swamp Thing, who offers Croc a place in the swampland where he can finally give in to his animal side and live free from human persecution.\n\nKiller Croc has appeared in both the \"\" storyline and its chronological follow up, \"Broken City\". In the former, he is infected with a virus that greatly increases the rate of his devolution, 'overseeing' a kidnapping for Hush before Batman defeats him; this provides Batman's first clue that someone else is orchestrating events, as he knows that Croc is too stupid to attempt a complex scheme like a kidnapping. Though Killer Croc was briefly restored to his original form The Mad Hatter, under Black Mask's orders, implanted Killer Croc with a device that made him loyal to Black Mask and caused the virus to return. Batman freed Croc from Black Mask's control. Croc attempted to take revenge on the Mad Hatter but was stopped by Batman and Croc escaped.\n\nIn 2005's \"Detective Comics\" #810, Killer Croc attempts to cure his condition. When the doctor fails, Croc devours her and retreats to the sewers, vowing vengeance on Batman and Black Mask.\n\nIn \"Infinite Crisis\", Croc becomes a member of Alexander Luthor, Jr.'s Secret Society of Super Villains.\n\nOne Year Later during the \"\" storyline, Killer Croc is shown to have been feeding on the dead body of Orca. He next shows up in \"Countdown\" where he breaks free from his shackles in Arkham Asylum and attempts to kill Jimmy Olsen, who uses elastic powers to escape. Killer Croc is then subdued.\n\nHe is later seen among the exiled supervillains in \"Salvation Run\". After the Martian Manhunter is defeated and imprisoned in a fiery cage, Croc suggests that he eats him. Lex Luthor forbids it however.\n\nDuring the \"Final Crisis\" storyline, Killer Croc can be seen as the member of Libra's Secret Society of Super Villains. Killer Croc is later turned into a Justifier.\n\nIn the \"\" storyline, Killer Croc is recruited by a new Black Mask to be a part of a group of villains aiming to take over Gotham.\n\nDuring the events of \"Brightest Day\", Killer Croc is accidentally released from his cell by a guard whom Osiris kills when Deathstroke and his band of Titans infiltrate Arkham. While attempting to flee from the facility, he is attacked by Osiris who mistakes Killer Croc for his old enemy Sobek.\n\nIn the continuity of DC's 2011 reboot The New 52, Killer Croc is established to have fought Roy Harper in Hell's Kitchen in a flashback seen in \"Red Hood and the Outlaws\". He is then passingly referenced by Roy as he is Roy's current sponsor for his alcoholism at the time when Roy was in a bar with Jason Todd. Roy is only drinking water, but knows Waylon would disapprove.\n\nDuring the 2013–2014 \"Forever Evil\" storyline Croc began ruling over Gotham's lower class. He murders a corrupt S.W.A.T. team that murdered one of the few people who were nice to him. When the Crime Syndicated invades Earth, Croc takes over Wayne Tower. He is confronted by the villain Bane, who injects Croc with Venom, turning Croc into a hulking giant, whom Bane then defeats.\n\nWhile institutionalized in Arkham, Killer Croc meets Sybil Silverlock, a woman with dual-personality disorder. He bonds with her softer personality, and she shows him a picture of her daughter, Olive. Sybil has him promise to look after Olive if he ever gets out. After the destruction of Arkham Asylum, Killer Croc escapes and travels to Gotham Academy, where he watches over Olive, and tells her about her mother, who was rendered comatose by the Asylum's destruction. Batman confronts them, Olive and Killer Croc escape to a swamp. Before parting, he tells her that if she is like her mother, to come and find him one day.\n\nHe recently helped Harley Quinn and her friends fight a gang of other Batman villains in Coney Island.\n\nIn DC's 2016 relaunch of its books, DC Rebirth, Killer Croc appears as one of the many villains attempting to kill Batman to stop Two-Face from leaking secret information. He attacks Batman on a train alongside Amygdala and King Shark.\n\nIn the pages of Suicide Squad, Killer Croc and the Squad go on a mission to retrieve a \"cosmic item\" from a Russian undersea prison, revealed to be a portal to the Phantom Zone, and come face-to-face with General Zod. He attacks the Squad and, when spotting Zod about to kill June Moone/Enchantress, Croc saves her just in time. After the mission, back in their cells, June Moone and Croc have a heartfelt conversation and embrace each other. Killer Croc and June Moone enjoy New York City exploit their romance in the future. Croc encourages her to try, but later expresses fear and shed tears that he will lose her if she is able to achieve her dream. Enchantress rampage in New York City until It is revealed that it is an editor from a magazine company who rejected June. After being convinced by Croc to reevaluate her, he decided to give her some freelance work. Moved by Waylon's actions, June reigns in the Enchantress and thanks her love for helping her.\n\nIn Harley Quinn's series Killer Croc joined the Penguin's plans to take over New York, but went off on his own to take Coney Island, revealing that he was on display there in a freak show as a kid driving out the other villains. After it was all torn down Harley convinced him to join her side and help take it all back from Penguin.\n\nKiller Croc's backstory explains that he was born with a condition resembling epidermolytic hyperkeratosis, a disfiguring skin disorder. However, it is actually a form of regressive atavism, meaning that he has inherited traits of ancestral species of the human race such as reptiles. This condition has been augmented by the presence of a metagene. Consequently, he has several extraordinary physical abilities relating to his endurance, speed, and strength, making him able to lift up to two tons.\n\nHis skin is hardened to the degree that it is nearly impenetrable to ordinary forms of abrasion including high caliber weapons fired from a distance. He also possesses an extraordinary super strength; for example, he was able to tear a bank vault door off of its hinges with minimal effort. He has demonstrated regenerative powers allowing him to heal and restore lost limbs and teeth. He possesses superhuman reflexes and speed, especially while he is moving underwater. Killer Croc also has an enhanced sense of smell. Once he has become familiar with a person's scent he can track them from miles away. As his appearance and personality has grown more and more bestial, his misanthropy has increased dramatically. He is jealous and hateful of \"normal\" people and often lashes out violently without provocation. As a result of these feelings of jealousy, Croc will often entertain himself by grabbing hold of small, pointy objects as a source of comfort.\n\nCroc's main weakness is consistently portrayed in most adaptations, aside from \"The Batman\" series, as being his low intellect. He typically resorts to brute force to solve most problems, allowing Batman to outmaneuver him in combat by thinking his way through the problems he faces in defeating the powerful Croc. Batman regularly describes his foe as an animal rather than a man. He acts almost solely on instinct and hardly ever takes the time to plan or rationalize his actions.\n\nIn recent years, Killer Croc has been portrayed as being much more reptilian than in past incarnations. An action figure made by Kenner in 1998 featured a tail and dinosaur-like feet. When Mattel got the license to make DC products in the early 2000s, they released their own version of Killer Croc, sculpted by Four Horsemen Studios. This version also featured a tail and dinosaur feet. In late 2005, a re-release of this figure was modified so that the tail, along with his shirt, was removed. This version also sports a more \"human\" head.\n\nThe 2002-2003 \"Batman\" storyline \"\" featured a more bestial Croc who had been mutated against his will to appear more reptilian. This version of the character was drawn by artist Jim Lee.\n\nIn The New 52, he is shown to have a crocodile-like head, though how this came to be has not yet been revealed. Such a design had previously appeared in \"Red Hood and the Outlaws\" drawn by Kenneth Rocafort.\n\nIn the non-canon graphic novel, \"Joker\", written by Brian Azzarello and artist Lee Bermejo, Croc is portrayed as a large, muscular black man with a scaly skin condition. Of all his previous designs, this is the most human, without a snout, tail, or claws. The book hints that Croc enjoys feeding on human flesh, with the story's narrator remarking that Croc \"has a certain... eccentric way with evidence\". Croc is shown leading a gang of thugs, and later becomes a high-level member of Joker's newly formed gang. This vision of the character is not unlike the one from Azzarello's previous work on Batman, \"Broken City\".\n\nIn the \"Batman Beyond\" comic, Killer Croc is mentioned as being a prisoner in a Cadmus Labs facility; his cell is briefly attacked by the new Hush, a clone of Dick Grayson, when Hush escapes the facility before he decides to simply leave. Another Cadmus official later contemplates releasing Croc to lure Hush out, but Amanda Waller dismisses the idea due to the potential for collateral damage.\n\nIn the crossover \"Batman/Aliens 2\", Killer Croc is part of an experiment by the twisted black ops officer Doctor Fortune to create hybrid soldiers using DNA from the aliens and the DNA of some of Batman's villains, hoping to harness the villains' genetic traits for survival without their psychological trauma. However, her use of Croc proves to be her undoing as Batman notes that Croc turned to villainy because he was naturally ruthless rather than being subject to any sort of trauma, resulting in the Croc/Alien hybrid tearing Fortune's head off before Batman manages to drown it after destroying her offshore base.\n\nIn \"Batman: Crimson Mist\", Killer Croc begins as a rumoured serial killer stalking Gotham's sewers, later joining Two-Face's gang as the muscle. Faced with the threat of the vampire Batman stalking and killing his opponents, Killer Croc and Two-Face form an alliance with Commissioner Gordon and Alfred Pennyworth to trap Batman in the Batcave and expose him to the sunlight (although Croc briefly contemplated just physically tearing Batman apart himself before the others pointed out that he was too fast for Croc, the vampire Batman proving more than a match for him physically when they did engage in close-quarter combat despite his withered physical condition). Although Croc and Two-Face attempt to kill Gordon and Alfred when Batman is believed dead, Alfred is able to help his old master recover by sacrificing his life and blood to give Batman the strength to stop Gotham's last criminals. With Alfred's sacrifice, Batman impales Croc with a stalactite, commenting that Croc can keep his cold blood thanks to Alfred's sacrifice having sated his appetite for the moment.\n\nIn the alternate timeline of the 2011 \"Flashpoint\" storyline, Killer Croc kidnapped the people of Gotham and imprisoned them in the sewer. Batman then arrived and attacked Killer Croc. Killer Croc was about to strike back at Batman, but Batman stabbed him in the head with his own machete. Batman rescued the people that Killer Croc had imprisoned.\n\nIn the second volume of \"\" series, in contrast with the mainstream continuity's version, Waylon Jones appears benign and is not a cannibal, and is dubbed \"Killer Croc\" by the media due to his ichthyosis condition. His mother sold him to the Haly's Circus when he was a child, and forced to perform there until he escapes. Jones hides in Gotham’s sewer system out of fear of the society’s discriminations over his genetic disorder. He helps Batman locate the Riddler’s underground hideout, and later aids his fight against the villain. Batman offers Jones a place in Wayne Manor in addition to help him find a cure for his condition, and asking his help in finding a location to establish his own hideout after his experience at the Riddler’s.\n\nKiller Croc appears in the \"\" prequel comic, he observes the argument between the heroes in silence until Cyborg angrily attacks Batman after discovering the virus he had uploaded into him during their first meeting, with Croc commenting that as \"pretty evil\". When Harley Quinn releases all the inmates to attack the heroes, Croc goes straight for Batman, preventing the Dark Knight from coming to his son Robin's aid as he's dragged underground by Solomon Grundy. Croc is next seen holding Batman down while the Riddler prepares to crush his skull with a large rock. Riddler is knocked out by Green Arrow and Croc is dispatched with a headbutt from Batman. In the prequel to \"Injustice 2\", Croc is now a member of the Suicide Squad. When the Squad is taken over by Ra's, he and Orca are used as his heavy hitters for his global conquest. He later marries Orca after she becomes pregnant with his child.\n\n\"Batman '66\" features a version of Killer Croc in the reality of the 1966 television series. This version of Waylon Jones was a henchman of King Tut and drank an elixir that transformed him into the reptilian monster Killer Croc. He uses his newfound strength to commit various crimes in Gotham. Batman and Robin interrogate his girlfriend Eva and find out she's in on his plan to become Gotham's biggest crime lord. They chase him down into the sewer where they defeat Croc and hand him over to the police.\n\nKiller Croc was a recurring character in the children's series \"Tiny Titans\" renamed \"Kroc.\" He was often depicted causing trouble showing up, and his rude and messy actions were often compared to the cleanliness and tidiness of Alfred.\n\nIn the \"DC Bombshells\" continuity, Killer Croc resides in the Belle Reeve Manor House in the bayous of Louisiana with the Coven (Batgirl, Enchantress, and Ravager), all of which he used to date at one point. The four occasionally helps others in nearby towns using potions and poisons for those who have been harmed by men. When Francine Charles comes with an offer from Amanda Waller, he agrees to help her convince the Coven to take Waller up on her offer. The four and Francine eventually form Waller's Suicide Squad. This version was formerly a handsome young man who was transformed into a crocodile monster from the Enchantress' magic.\n\nKiller Croc appears trying to steal the Batmobile to make a profit, but goes through the sewers where the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles attack and defeat him after he unknowingly invades their lair.\n\nKiller Croc appears in the 2017 series (which, though unconfirmed, appears to be heavily inspired by ). Croc, along with several other Batman villains, is tricked by Jack Napier (who in this reality was a Joker who had been force fed an overdose of pills by Batman which temporarily cured him of his insanity) into drinking drinks that had been laced with particles from Clayface’s body. This was done so that Napier, who was using Mad Hatter’s technology to control Clayface, could control them by way of Clayface’s ability to control parts of his body that had been separated from him. Croc and the other villains are then used to attack a library which Napier himself was instrumental in building in one of Gotham’s poorer districts.\n\n\n\n\n\nKiller Croc appears in the \"\" series where he has been voiced by Steven Blum in \"Arkham Asylum\", \"Arkham City\", and \"Arkham Knight\" and \"VR\", and by Khary Payton in \"Arkham Origins\".\n\n\n\nIn the novel \"Batman: Knightfall and Beyond\", based largely on the comics storyline, Killer Croc is said to have suffered from \"a raging skin cancer\" that turned the outer layers of his flesh into a hardened covering when he was younger. He escapes from Arkham Asylum when Bane and his men destroy it, freeing most of Batman's major foes in the process as part of a plan by Bane to wear him down before Bane himself \"breaks\" him. Batman later defeats Croc in a one-on-one fight in the sewers, crushing a cylinder of knock-out gas against the underside of his nose to disable him. Croc is then arrested and held in Blackgate Prison with the other Arkham escapees until the asylum can be rebuilt.\n\n"}
{"id": "9424037", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9424037", "title": "Mark Kellogg (reporter)", "text": "Mark Kellogg (reporter)\n\nMark Kellogg (March 31, 1831 – June 25, 1876) was a newspaper reporter killed at the Battle of the Little Bighorn. Kellogg rode with George Armstrong Custer during the battle and was evidently one of the first men killed by the Sioux and Cheyenne. His dispatches were the only press coverage of Custer and his men in the days leading up to the battle. As a newspaper stringer whose reports were picked up around the country, Kellogg is considered the first Associated Press correspondent to die in the line of duty.\n\nBorn Marcus Henry Kellogg on March 31, 1831, in Brighton, Ontario, Canada, Kellogg was the third of ten children. Kellogg's family moved a number of times in his youth before they eventually settled in La Crosse, Wisconsin. While there Kellogg learned to operate a telegraph and went to work for both the Northwestern Telegraph Company and the Atlantic and Pacific Telegraph Company.\n\nHe married Martha J. Robinson in 1861 and they had two daughters. During the years of the American Civil War, Kellogg became the assistant editor for the \"La Crosse Democrat\" newspaper. He also unsuccessfully ran for the office of city clerk in 1867 and played shortstop on one of the town's baseball teams.\n\nIn 1867 Kellogg's wife died. Leaving his daughters to be raised by an aunt, Kellogg began drifting around the upper Midwest, working as a reporter and editorial assistant in places such as Council Bluffs, Iowa, and Brainerd, Minnesota. While living in Brainerd he ran for election to the Minnesota Legislature, but was defeated. He also worked as a string correspondent for the \"St. Paul Dispatch\", with his articles often published under the pen name of \"Frontier.\"\n\nIn the early 1870s, he moved to Bismarck, North Dakota, where in 1873 he helped editor Clement A. Lounsberry found \"The Bismarck Tribune\". Even though Kellogg was only an editorial assistant for the paper, he substituted for Lounsberry as editor of the \"Tribune\"'s second, third and fourth issues.\n\nWhen Lounsberry learned that a military column (including the 7th U.S. Cavalry Regiment commanded by Lt. Col. George Armstrong Custer) would soon leave Fort Abraham Lincoln for the Montana Territory, he agreed to accompany Custer and provide news coverage. However, at the last minute Lounsberry's wife fell ill, so the editor asked Kellogg to take his place. Lounsberry expected Kellogg would cover nothing more than a sensational military victory.\n\nKellogg sent three dispatches back to Lounsberry, the last one four days before the battle when they were near the mouth of the Rosebud River. His last dispatch read, \"By the time this reaches you we would have met and fought the red devils, with what result remains to be seen. I go with Custer and will be at the death.\" Kellogg was not predicting his own death or Custer's defeat; instead, \"at the death\" is a phrase borrowed from fox hunting meaning \"present at the kill\" (\"viz\"., of the pursued).\n\nFour days after that dispatch, the Battle of the Little Bighorn was fought, resulting in the deaths of Custer and the 208 soldiers, scouts, and civilians riding with him, including Kellogg.\n\nColonel John Gibbon, whose men arrived at the battle on Tuesday, June 27, and also helped bury the dead, said he found Kellogg's body in a ravine where a number of men from Company E died. Kellogg's body was scalped and missing an ear; he was identified by the boots he wore.\n\nWhen Clement Lounsberry learned of the defeat of Custer's force and Kellogg's death, he \"worked tirelessly throughout the night\" to produce a special edition of \"The Bismarck Tribune\". Published on July 6, 1876, the article was the battle's first full account. Lounsberry also telegraphed the news, including Kellogg's correspondence, to a number of eastern newspapers, including the \"New York Herald\". Two letters written by Kellogg were published posthumously by the \"Herald\" on July 11, 1876.\n\nAs a newspaper stringer whose reports were picked up around the country, Kellogg is considered the first Associated Press correspondent to die in the line of duty.\n\nSome of Kellogg's diary and notes survived the battle and these, along with his news accounts, are one of the primary historical sources for information on the days preceding the battle. His notes are now in the possession of the State Historical Society of North Dakota. His satchel, pencil, and eyeglasses are on display in the Newseum in Washington, DC.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "10842218", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10842218", "title": "Myrrhbearers", "text": "Myrrhbearers\n\nIn Orthodox Christian tradition the Myrrhbearers (Greek: Μυροφόροι, Latin: \"Myrophorae\"; Slavonic: Жены́-мѷроно́сицы; ) are the individuals mentioned in the New Testament who were directly involved in the burial or who discovered the empty tomb following the resurrection of Jesus. The term traditionally refers to the women with myrrh who came to the tomb of Christ early in the morning to find it empty. In Western Christianity, the two women at the tomb, Three Marys or other variants are the terms normally used. Also included are Joseph of Arimathea and Nicodemus, who took the body of Jesus down from the cross, embalmed it with myrrh and aloes, wrapped it in clean linen, and placed it in a new tomb. (, , , , ).\n\nThe women followed Jesus during his earthly ministry in Galilee, providing for him and his followers out of their own means (). They remained faithful to him even during the most dangerous time of his arrest and execution, and not only stood by the cross, but accompanied him to his burial, noticing where the tomb was located. Because of the impending Sabbath, it was necessary for the burial preparations to be brief. Jewish custom at the time dictated that mourners return to the tomb every day for three days. Once the Sabbath had passed, the women returned at the earliest possible moment, bringing myrrh to anoint the body. It was at this point that the Resurrection was revealed to them, and they were commissioned to go and tell the Apostles. They were, in effect, the apostles to the Apostles. For this reason, the myrrhbearing women, especially Mary Magdalene, are sometimes referred to as \"Equal to the Apostles.\"\n\nJoseph of Arimathea was a disciple of Jesus, but secretly (). He went to Pontius Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus and, together with Nicodemus, hurriedly prepared the body for burial. He donated his own new tomb for the burial. A native of Arimathea, he was apparently a man of wealth, and probably a member of the Sanhedrin (which is the way the biblical Greek, \"bouleutēs\"—literally, \"counselor\"—is often interpreted in and ). Joseph was an \"honourable counselor, who waited (or \"was searching\") for the kingdom of God\" (). Luke describes him as \"a good man, and just\" ().\n\nNicodemus (Greek: Νικόδημος) was a Pharisee and also a member of the Sanhedrin, who is first mentioned early in the Gospel of John, when he visits Jesus to listen to his teachings, but he comes by night out of fear (). He is mentioned again when he states the teaching of the Law of Moses concerning the arrest of Jesus during the Feast of Tabernacles (). He is last mentioned following the Crucifixion, when he and Joseph of Arimathea prepare the body of Jesus for burial (). There is an apocryphal \"Gospel of Nicodemus\" that purports to be written by him.\n\nThe Myrrhbearers are traditionally listed as:\n\nThere are also generally accepted to be other Myrrhbearers, whose names are not known.\n\nIn the Eastern Orthodox and Greek Catholic churches, the \"Third Sunday of Pascha\" (i.e. the second Sunday after Easter) is called the 'Sunday of the Myrrhbearers'. The Scripture readings appointed for the services on this day emphasize the role of these individuals in the Death and Resurrection of Jesus: Matins Gospel—, Divine Liturgy Epistle— and Gospel—.\n\nSince this day commemorates events surrounding not only the Resurrection, but also the entombment of Christ, some of the hymns from Holy Saturday are repeated. These include the Troparion of the Day: \"The noble Joseph...\" (but with a new line added at the end, commemorating the Resurrection), and the Doxastikhon at the Vespers Aposticha: \"Joseph together with Nicodemus...\"\n\nThe week that follows is called the Week of the Myrrhbearers and the Troparion mentioned above is used every day at the Canonical Hours and the Divine Liturgy. The Doxastikhon is repeated again at Vespers on Wednesday and Friday evenings.\n\nMany of the Myrrhbearers also have separate feast days on which they are commemorated individually in the Menaion.\n\nThere are numerous liturgical hymns which speak of the Myrrhbearers, especially in the Sunday Octoechos and in the Pentecostarion. Every Sunday, there is a special hymn that is chanted at Matins and the Midnight Office, called the \"Hypakoë\", (Greek: Ύπακοί, Slavonic: Ўпаκои), which means, \"sent\", and refers to the Myrrhbearing women being sent to announce the Resurrection to the Apostles.\n\nThere are several prominent Orthodox cathedrals and churches named after the Myrrhbearers. They celebrate their patronal feast day on the Sunday of the Myrrhbearers.\n\nIn the Gospels, especially the synoptics, women play a central role as eyewitness at Jesus' death, entombment, and in the discovery of the empty tomb. All three synoptics repeatedly make women the subject of verbs of seeing, clearly presenting them as eyewitnesses.\n\nThe presence of women as the key witnesses who discover the empty tomb has been seen as increasing the credibility of the testimony, since, in the contemporary culture (Jewish and Greco-Roman), one might expect a fabrication to place men, and especially numerous and important men, at this critical place, rather than just \"some grieving women.\" C. H. Dodd considered the narrative in John to be \"self-authenticating\", arguing that no one would make up the notion that Jesus had appeared to the \"little known woman\" Mary Magdalene. However, some passages in the Mishnah (Yebamoth 16:7; Ketubot 2:5; Eduyot 3:6) indicate that women could give testimony if there was no male witness available. Also, Josephus and Pliny the Younger have used women as witnesses to their claims. In addition, Paul does not mention the women. Bart D. Ehrman argues:\n\"One of Mark's overarching themes is that virtually no one during the ministry of Jesus could understand who he was. His family didn't understand. His townspeople didn't understand. The leaders of his own people didn't understand. Not even the disciples understood in Mark—especially not the disciples! For Mark, only outsiders have an inkling of who Jesus was: the unnamed woman who anointed him, the centurion at the cross. Who understands at the end? Not the family of Jesus! Not the disciples! It's a group of previously unknown women…the women at the tomb….\"\nAll three Synoptics name two or three women on each occasion in the passion-resurrection narratives where they are cited as eyewitnesses: the Torah's required two or three witnesses in a statute that had exerted influence beyond legal courts and into situations in everyday life where accurate evidence was needed. Among the named women (and some are left anonymous), Mary Magdalene is present in all four Gospel accounts, and Mary the mother of James is present in all three synoptics; however, variations exist in the lists of each Gospel concerning the women present at the death, entombment, and discovery. For example, Mark names three women at the cross and the same three who go to the tomb, but only two are observed to be witnesses at the burial. Based on this, and similar examples in Matthew and Luke, Richard Bauckham argued that the evangelists showed \"scrupulous care\" and \"were careful to name precisely the women who were known to them as witnesses to these crucial events\" since there would be no other reason, besides interest in historical accuracy, not to simply use the same set of characters from one scene to another.\n\nMark's account (which in the earliest extant manuscripts) ends abruptly and claims that the women told no one. The Gospels of Matthew and Mark do not present any further involvement at the tomb. Luke describes Peter as running to the tomb to check for himself, and John adds that the Beloved Disciple did so too, the beloved disciple outrunning Peter.\n\n\n"}

Marsh\n\nNorman Winfield Marsh (February 25, 1898 or 1899 [sources differ] – February 10, 1980) was an American cartoonist and comic strip creator known for his character Dan Dunn, a hardboiled detective. \n\nMarsh was born in Waukegan, Illinois, the son of Ernest Morrell Marsh and Julia Inez Craver.\n\nMarsh worked as agent for the Secret Service for about five years, and then as a detective in the Chicago Police Department.\n\nMarsh was drafted into the military in 1942, during World War II, and retired at the rank of Captain.\n\nAfterward, he moved to Los Angeles. He was part of a veterans group called the Studio City Barracks, named after the neighborhood where he lived and worked.\n\nHe supported the Republican Party.\n\nNorman Marsh's career as a cartoonist began c. 1922. He created the hardboiled detective character Dan Dunn in the proto-comic book \"Detective Dan: Secret Operative No. 48\" (May 12, 1933). The book contained all-original stories as opposed to reprinted newspaper strips. Comics historian Don Markstein notes that this periodical and the only two others from this publisher were pioneering in that they contained \"non-reprinted comics in 1933\", though these periodicals were not \"in modern comic book format. Theirs were done as tabloids\" with \"Detective Dan: Secret Operative No. 48\" measuring either 9 1/2 x 12-inches or 10 x 13-inches (sources differ), with black-and-white newsprint pages and a three-color cardboard cover.\n\nThe character appeared primarily in the newspaper comic strip \"Dan Dunn\", syndicated by Publishers Syndicate beginning Monday, September 25, 1933, with a Sunday page added soon afterward. The strip, which ran through Sunday, October 3, 1943, eventually would appear in approximately 135 papers. \"Dan Dunn\" strips were reprinted in comic books, through publisher Eastern Color's \"Famous Funnies\", Dell Comics' \"The Funnies\" and \"Red Ryder Comics\", and Western Publishing's \"Crackajack Funnies\" from 1935 to 1943.\n\nFollowing the end of \"Dan Dunn\", Marsh created another hardboiled-detective strip, \"Hunter Keene\", for King Features Syndicate, which ran daily and not Sunday from April 15, 1946, to April 12, 1947. Following this was \"Danny Hale\", about \"a kid frontiersman who found himself tagging along with revolutionary war heroes, accompanying the Lewis and Clark expedition, and generally being in the right place at the right time (even if those times were widely separated)\", according to comics historian Allan Holtz. King Features syndicated it beginning October 27, 1947, and after three years, with the syndicate prepared to end it, Marsh began self-syndicating the strip starting January 15, 1951 episode. A year later, he changed the title to \"Dan'l Hale\" and aged the character to a young man. The strip ended on October 13, 1962.\n"}

{"id": "3907319", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3907319", "title": "Pattern formation", "text": "Pattern formation\n\nThe science of pattern formation deals with the visible, (statistically) orderly outcomes of self-organization and the common principles behind similar patterns in nature.\n\nIn developmental biology, pattern formation refers to the generation of complex organizations of cell fates in space and time. Pattern formation is controlled by genes. The role of genes in pattern formation is an aspect of morphogenesis, the creation of diverse anatomies from similar genes, now being explored in the science of evolutionary developmental biology or evo-devo. The mechanisms involved are well seen in the anterior-posterior patterning of embryos from the model organism \"Drosophila melanogaster\" (a fruit fly), one of the first organisms to have its morphogenesis studied, and in the eyespots of butterflies, whose development is a variant of the standard (fruit fly) mechanism.\n\nExamples of pattern formation can be found in Biology, Chemistry, Physics and Mathematics, and can readily be simulated with Computer graphics, as described in turn below.\n\nBiological patterns such as animal markings, the segmentation of animals, and phyllotaxis are formed in different ways. \n\nIn developmental biology, pattern formation describes the mechanism by which initially equivalent cells in a developing tissue in an embryo assume complex forms and functions. Embryogenesis, such as of the fruit fly \"Drosophila\", involves coordinated control of cell fates. Pattern formation is genetically controlled, and often involves each cell in a field sensing and responding to its position along a morphogen gradient, followed by short distance cell-to-cell communication through cell signaling pathways to refine the initial pattern. In this context, a field of cells is the group of cells whose fates are affected by responding to the same set positional information cues. This conceptual model was first described as the French flag model in the 1960s. More generally, the morphology of organisms is patterned by the mechanisms of evolutionary developmental biology, such as changing the timing and positioning of specific developmental events in the embryo.\n\nPossible mechanisms of pattern formation in biological systems include the classical reaction-diffusion model proposed by Alan Turing and the more recently found elastic instability mechanism which is thought to be responsible for the fold patterns on the cerebral cortex of higher animals, among other things.\n\nBacterial colonies show a large variety of patterns formed during colony growth. The resulting shapes depend on the growth conditions. In particular, stresses (hardness of the culture medium, lack of nutrients, etc.) enhance the complexity of the resulting patterns. Other organisms such as slime moulds display remarkable patterns caused by the dynamics of chemical signalling.\n\nVegetation patterns such as tiger bush and fir waves form for different reasons. Tiger bush consists of stripes of bushes on arid slopes in countries such as Niger where plant growth is limited by rainfall. Each roughly horizontal stripe of vegetation absorbs rainwater from the bare zone immediately above it. In contrast, fir waves occur in forests on mountain slopes after wind disturbance, during regeneration. When trees fall, the trees that they had sheltered become exposed and are in turn more likely to be damaged, so gaps tend to expand downwind. Meanwhile, on the windward side, young trees grow, protected by the wind shadow of the remaining tall trees.\n\n\nBénard cells, Laser, cloud formations in stripes or rolls. Ripples in icicles. Washboard patterns on dirtroads. Dendrites in solidification, liquid crystals. Solitons.\n\nSphere packings and coverings. Mathematics underlies the other pattern formation mechanisms listed.\n\nSome types of automata have been used to generate organic-looking textures for more realistic shading of 3d objects.\n\nA popular Photoshop plugin, KPT 6, included a filter called 'KPT reaction'. Reaction produced reaction-diffusion style patterns based on the supplied seed image.\n\nA similar effect to the 'KPT reaction' can be achieved with convolution functions in digital image processing, with a little patience, by repeatedly sharpening and blurring an image in a graphics editor. If other filters are used, such as emboss or edge detection, different types of effects can be achieved.\n\nComputers are often used to simulate the biological, physical or chemical processes that lead to pattern formation, and they can display the results in a realistic way. Calculations using models like Reaction-diffusion or MClone are based on the actual mathematical equations designed by the scientists to model the studied phenomena.\n\n"}

A pan European network is currently working on its Design, and it is set to open in 2014, to mark the 100th anniversary of World War I.\n\nOne famous example was that of Vinoba Bhave, who undertook a peace walk with many of his followers throughout India for land reform.\n\nA recent peace walk campaign named \"Freedom Walk\" was organized by the Free Software Community in Kerala in 2008. 4 volunteers walked 750 miles (1,200 km) from one end of the state to the other to promote Free Software.\n\nA peace walk was undertaken in 1962 by Satish Kumar and his companion who walked without money from India via the Soviet Union, France and the UK to the United States (using ships to cross the channel and Atlantic). Vinoba gave 2 gifts to Satish and his companion: pennilessness, i.e. voluntary poverty, and vegetarianism.\n\nEarly in 1984, peace campers walked 26 miles from Daws hill to Naphill through country roads and countryside to raise money for \"The Angry Pacifist\" magazine.\n\nThe \"King-Carter Freedom Peace Walk\" is a 1.5-mile walkway in Atlanta, Georgia's (USA) Freedom Park. It commemorates the only two Georgia winners of the Nobel Prize for Peace: Martin Luther King Jr. and Jimmy Carter.\n\nVarious peace organizations throughout the United States have organized marches and vigils to protest the Iraq War, since before the war started in 2003, and then annually ever since. Sometimes these marches are coordinated to take place on the same day across the nation. In San Diego, the greatest number of anti-war protesters, an estimated 7,000, turned out for a demonstration on March 15, just five days before the beginning of the Iraq War.\n\nPeace walk for the Unity of Hungary, on the 29th of March, 2014.\n\n\"The Interfaith Pilgrimage for Peace and Life\" started in Auschwitz, Poland on December 8, 1994, and ended in Nagasaki on the fiftieth anniversary of the Nagasaki bombing, 9 August 1995. It was led by Nipponzan-Myōhōji Japanese Buddhist monks. The monks, however, were dwarfed in number by American, European, South American and Japanese lay people.\n\nThe trip was organized to both commemorate the 50th anniversary of the end of World War II as well as to be witness to the suffering in contemporary war zones. The group walked from Auschwitz to Vienna, then travelled through Croatia, Bosnia and Serbia. They crossed the front lines of the Bosnian war in Mostar and held a day of vigil, fasting and prayer there. The next leg took them through Israel, the Gaza Strip, the West Bank, Jordan and Iraq.\n\nThe group travelled across the front lines in Cambodia, where they joined the Dhammayietra, an annual Cambodian peace walk led by \"the Gandhi of Cambodia\" Maha Ghosananda. They then visited war sites in Vietnam and the Philippines before going to Hiroshima and Nagasaki.\n\nThis walk was one of many peace pilgrimages organized by the Nipponzan Myōhōji monks, but it was the largest in scale, number of participants, time, and distance travelled.\n\nOver 1000 people participated in at least part of the pilgrimage, including Buddhists, Quakers, Catholics, Muslims and Jews. The pilgrimage received media attention and books were written about it.\n\n\"A Walk to Moscow\" was a peace walk, one of many walks for peace in the 20th century. These were specially organized by groups of pacifists and peace activists who wanted to make some protest against the politics of war and the use of chemical, biological and nuclear weapons. In the early 1960s, there was a walk across the United States, Europe and the USSR (its history is told in a book \"You Come with Naked Hands\" by Bradford Lyttle.\n\nIn the 1980s, a group organized to walk across America and through Europe to Moscow to show solidarity with all people and to demonstrate in a grass roots way that all people are linked by their right to live on the earth in peace and safety. This walk was conceived by organizers while on another peace walk \"A Walk for Survival\" (from Santa Cruz, California to Washington State) in 1980. While at a requested meeting with the Russian Consulate in San Francisco one organizer, Jack Chalmers asked if we continued our walk across America, and Europe would we be allowed to walk to Moscow? The Consulate answered \"of course\". \"A Walk for Survival\" ended at Bangor, Washington State at the site of a Trident nuclear submarine base, and the organizers immediately started planning \"A Walk to Moscow\". The walk started in Bangor on March 1, 1981 and reached the East Coast in time to winter it out in Boston, before flying to Europe in March 1982. The summer of 1982 was spent walking across the UK (with a side-tip to Ireland), France, Belgium, and Federal Republic of Germany (with a trip to West Berlin by bus which returned to its starting point in order for the walking route to continue uninterrupted.) The Walk operated by sending advance teams a few weeks ahead to cities and towns along a prospective path to set up press, speaking engagements and accommodations for the group. Decisions were made only by complete consensus, which often led to long and stormy meetings.\n\nThe German Democratic Republic had refused entry to the group, so they walked south to Bavaria and stayed there for the winter, while negotiating visas for Czechoslovakia, Poland and the USSR. A Walk to Moscow (the indefinite article rather than the definite \"The Walk\" was important to many of the original walkers, as it implied that it was only one initiative, and others would hopefully follow. The distinction was, however, lost on people in the Eastern countries of the route,as Slavonic languages do not have words for either an or the!) spent nearly a year in Europe working from an Old Mill in Regnitzlosau in Bavaria, Germany. It was difficult to get the governments then in the Communist Bloc to allow the group to walk through their territory. While the group negotiated with the government of Czechoslovakia, Poland and Russia the walkers visited many places on foot in Germany and gave talks to local Peace groups. Some members of the group got involved in passive resistance chaining themselves to railings over conscription in Germany or others fasted for peace in the world. Members went to Denmark to join in with peace groups and talk about the walk.\n\nIn 1983 visas were obtained for Czechoslovakia and Poland, and a continuous walking route was planned and successfully carried out as far as the border between Poland and the USSR.\n\nRelations with official \"peace\" groups in those countries were tricky, and the Czech government tried to incorporate the initiative into their showpiece pro-Warsaw Pact 1983 conference in Prague - however the group did not partake, although a few members lobbied delegates outside, and were invited in for one discussion). Walking across the USSR was not permitted however. The group entered and transited to Minsk, then Smolensk, hoping for some compromise in negotiations, but this did not happen. At this point many of the members chose to return, and not go to Moscow; the others tried to walk to Moscow anyway, but were immediately apprehended and sent to rejoin the others in Minsk. Some members went to Denmark to join in with peace groups and talk about the walk. When the walk finished some people from the group talked at a CND rally about their work and the passive resistance movement. The group membership was international, people came from all over the world to join in and make a difference.\n\nSome Walk to Moscow participants later met with other walks that crossed the U.S. and Europe, including Walk of the People - A Pilgrimage for Life, which occurred from 1984 to 1985.\n\nThe Women Cross DMZ (Korean demilitarized zone) group, which includes noted American feminist and activist Gloria Steinem, Nobel Peace Prize laureate Mairead Maguire, and organizer Christine Ahn with other activist women members, have conducted a peace symposium in Pyongyang on May 20, 2015 and this women group walked across the DMZ, separating North and South Korea for peace on May 24, 2015.\n\n\n"}

Known in Indonesia/Malaysia as \"kain kafan\", the shroud is the prescribed length of cloth used in Muslim burials to wrap the body of the dead person. The dead body is covered in white fabric tied over the head, under the feet, and on the neck.\n\nAccording to traditional beliefs, the soul of a dead person will stay on the Earth for 40 days after the death. If the ties over the shroud are not released after 40 days, the body is said to jump out from the grave to warn people that the soul needs to be released. After the ties are released, the soul will leave the Earth forever. Because of the tie under the feet, the ghost can't walk. This causes the pocong to hop like a rabbit. They also have the ability to fly and teleport.\n\nPocongs often appear in religion-based movies or TV serials. In the early 2000s (decade), TV stations in Indonesia purported to capture ghost appearances with their cameras and put the records on a specific show of their own. In these shows, the Pocong appearances could be seen very often, along with the kuntilanak. There was also a movie \"Pocong\" (2006) directed by Rudy Soedjarwo, which was banned and censored in French and German DVD versions due to the disturbing, scary, and terrifying, scenes. Not long after it was banned, the director created a sequel less horrible but about the same story, \"Pocong 2\" (2006). Other titles \"Pocong 3\" (2007), \"The Real Pocong\" (2009), \"40 Hari Bangkitnya Pocong\" (2008) were introduced in the movie series in theaters in Indonesia.\n\nMovie \"Pocong Jumat Kliwon\", directed by successful director Nayato Fio Nuala, began a trend of horror comedy Pocong movies. \nIn 2011 \"Pocong is also Pocong\", a new horror-comedy featuring Pocong, was made by female director Chiska Doppert, Nayato's former partner.\n\nOther recent movies featuring Pocong are \"Sumpah, (Ini) Pocong!\" (2009), \"Pocong Setan Jompo\" (2009) and \"Kepergok Pocong\" (2011).\n\n"}

He was greatly influenced by his wife, a beautiful but power-hungry German princess. Because of Popiel's misrule and his failure to defend the land from marauding Vikings, his twelve uncles conspired to depose him; however, at his wife's instigation, he had them all poisoned during a feast (some believe that she committed the act herself). Instead of cremating their bodies as was the custom, he had the corpses cast into Lake Gopło.\n\nWhen the commoners saw what Popiel and his wife had done, they rebelled. The couple took refuge in a tower near the lake. As the story goes, a throng of mice and rats (which had been feeding on the unburnt bodies of Popiel's uncles) rushed into the tower, chewed through the walls, and devoured Popiel and his wife alive. Prince Popiel was succeeded by Piast Kołodziej and Siemowit.\n\nOn the shore of Lake Gopło stands a medieval tower, nicknamed the \"Mouse Tower\"; however, it bears no relation to the site of the events described in the legend as it was erected some 500 years thereafter.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "4012069", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4012069", "title": "Pseudomonas phage Φ6", "text": "Pseudomonas phage Φ6\n\nΦ6 (Phi 6) is the best-studied bacteriophage of the virus family Cystoviridae. It infects \"Pseudomonas\" bacteria (typically plant-pathogenic \"P. syringae\"). It has a three-part, segmented, double-stranded RNA genome, totalling ~13.5 kb in length. Φ6 and its relatives have a lipid membrane around their nucleocapsid, a rare trait among bacteriophages. It is a lytic phage, though under certain circumstances has been observed to display a delay in lysis which may be described as a \"carrier state\".\n\nΦ6 typically attaches to the Type IV pilus of \"P. syringae\" with its attachment protein, P3. It is thought that the cell then retracts its pilus, pulling the phage toward the bacterium. Fusion of the viral envelope with the bacterial outer membrane is facilitated by the phage protein, P6. The muralytic (peptidoglycan-digesting) enzyme, P5, then digests a portion of the cell wall, and the nucleocapsid enters the cell coated with the bacterial outer membrane.\n\nA copy of the sense strand of the large genome segment (6374 bases) is then synthesized (transcription) on the vertices of the capsid, with the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, P2, and released into the host cell cytosol. The four proteins translated from the large segment spontaneously assemble into procapsids, which then package a large segment sense strand, polymerizing its complement during entry through the P2 polymerase-containing vertices.\nWhile the large segment is being translated (expressed) and synthesized (replicated), the parental phage releases copies of the sense strands of the medium segment (4061 bases) and small segment (2948 bases) into the cytosol. They are translated, and packaged into the procapsids in order: medium then small. The filled capsids are then coated with the nucleocapsid protein P8, and then outer membrane proteins somehow attract bacterial inner membrane, which then envelopes the nucleocapsid.\n\nThe lytic protein, P5, is contained between the P8 nucleocapsid shell and the viral envelope. The completed phage progeny remain in the cytosol until sufficient levels of the lytic protein P5 degrade the host cell wall. The cytosol then bursts forth, disrupting the outer membrane, releasing the phage. The bacterium is killed by this lysis.\n\nRNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRPs) are critical components in the life cycle of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) viruses. However, it is not fully understood how these important enzymes function during viral replication. Expression and characterization of the purified recombinant RdRP of Φ6 is the first direct demonstration of RdRP activity catalyzed by a single protein from a dsRNA virus. The recombinant Φ6 RdRP is highly active \"in vitro\", possesses RNA replication and transcription activities, and is capable of using both homologous and heterologous RNA molecules as templates. The crystal structure of the Φ6 polymerase, solved in complex with a number of ligands, provides insights towards understanding the mechanism of primer-independent initiation of RNA-dependent RNA polymerization. This RNA polymerase appears to operate without a sigma factor/subunit. The purified Φ6 RdRP displays processive elongation \"in vitro\" and self-assembles along with polymerase complex proteins into subviral particles that are fully functional.\n\nΦ6 has been studied as a model to understand how segmented RNA viruses package their genomes, its structure has been studied by scientists interested in lipid-containing bacteriophages, and it has been used as a model organism to test evolutionary theory such as Muller's ratchet. Phage Φ6 has been used extensively in additional phage experimental evolution studies.\n\n\n"}

As a little girl in the 1930s she began to claim to remember details of a past life. The case was brought to the attention of Mahatma Gandhi who set up a commission to investigate; a report was published in 1936. Two further reports were written at the time. The report by Bal Chand Nahata was published as a Hindi booklet by the name \"Punarjanma Ki Paryalochana\". In this, he stated that \"'Whatever material that has come before us, does not warrant us to conclude that Shanti Devi has 'former life recollections or that this case proves reincarnation\". This argument was disputed by Indra Sen in an article later. A further report, based on interviews conducted in 1936, was published in 1952. Later in life Shanti Devi was interviewed again, and a Swedish author who had visited her twice published a book about the case in 1994; the English translation appeared in 1998.\n\nAccording to these accounts, when she was about four years old, she told her parents that her real home was in Mathura where her husband lived, about 145 km from her home in Delhi. Discouraged by her parents, she ran away from home at age six, trying to reach Mathura. Back home, she stated in school that she was married and had died ten days after having given birth to a child. Interviewed by her teacher and headmaster, she used words from the Mathura dialect and divulged the name of her merchant husband, \"Kedar Nath\". The headmaster located a merchant by that name in Mathura who had lost his wife, Lugdi Devi, nine years earlier, ten days after having given birth to a son. Kedar Nath traveled to Delhi, pretending to be his own brother, but Shanti Devi immediately recognized him and Lugdi Devi's son. As she knew several details of Kedar Nath's life with his wife, he was soon convinced that Shanti Devi was indeed the reincarnation of Lugdi Devi. When Mahatma Gandhi heard about the case, he met the child and set up a commission to investigate. The commission traveled with Shanti Devi to Mathura, arriving on 15 November 1935. There she recognized several family members, including the grandfather of Lugdi Devi. She found out that Kedar Nath had neglected to keep a number of promises he had made to Lugdi Devi on her deathbed. She then traveled home with her parents. The commission's report concluded that Shanti Devi was indeed the reincarnation of Lugdi Devi.\n\nShanti Devi did not marry. She told her story again at the end of the 1950s, and once more in 1986 when she was interviewed by Ian Stevenson and K.S. Rawat. In this interview she also related her near death experiences when Lugdi Devi died. K.S. Rawat continued his investigations in 1987, and the last interview took place only four days before her death on 27 December 1987.\n\n"}

In the game, Fred Flintstone and Barney Rubble must find the treasure before any other Buffalo member (or even their wives, Wilma and Betty). The game features passwords that must be written down in order to continue the game from the highest level reached.\n\nThe game itself first involves a world map representing a themed set of worlds. Rolling the dice results in either Fred or Barney moving to the appropriate space on the board. Depending on the landed space, the player must clear a level in that particular world, defeat bosses, or enter shops, among other things. On some zones, Wilma and Betty appear and if any one of them manage to meet their respective husband, she will drag him some spaces back to an arbitrary location. Moving the players in the game is similar to playing a Japanese sugoroku board game.\n\nThe levels themselves are simple platformer segments. In these segments, the characters must traverse from left to right (and sometimes right to left), while avoiding hazards and defeating dinosaurs, Water Buffalo members or other creatures. In order to defeat enemies, Fred and Barney use a wood club. There is an overall difficulty level of \"medium\" to the game; providing frequent breaks from the low-difficulty horizontal scrolling action stages with mini-games that have a high level of difficulty. There are also powerups such as brontoburger (energy) and clams (in-game currency). In a few cases, a powerup is a trap in which the Cavemouse appears, being followed by Dino. Unlike the TV show, Dino actually hurts the player if he is hit by him.\n\nThe earlier zones in the game can only be cleared by first defeating specific Water Buffalo members (most of which appeared at some point in the cartoon series) by winning them in a race located at a stadium. Races use the game's RAM to simulate variables like forward speed, leaning angle, maximum terrain speed, and vertical speed. These events must be found as their items are crucial to the success of the quest. If any character go to the stadium, the race can be practiced. The person who operates the racing mini-game will give an item to both Fred and Barney after defeating him, so that they can go the next world.\n\nThe types of worlds involved include Bedrock, Snowrock (an ice world), and Magmarock (a fire world), amongst other worlds present in the game. Within each world are mini-game challenges that allow players to experience the diversity of that world.\n\n\"GamePro\" gave the game a negative review, summarizing, \"Intermediate gamers will find this game repetitive and way too easy. Everyone else will find themselves leaving the cave for some fresh air rather than being stuck with this humdrum rock-knocker.\"\n"}

Derived from the Greek \"xenos\", which as a substantive has the meaning \"stranger, wanderer, refugee\" and as an adjective \"foreign, alien, strange, unusual.\"\n\nIt is used to denote a hypothetical science whose object of study would be extraterrestrial societies developed by alien lifeforms. In science fiction criticism and studies the term has been advocated by writers such as David Brin (\"Xenology: The New Science of Asking 'Who's Out There?'\" \"Analog\", 26 April 1983) as an analogue of (terrestrial) ethnology. By extension the term may also refer to the fictional creation of \"alternative humankinds\".\n\nInstances in which Xenology was referred to in a work of Science Fiction include the Brothers Strugatsky's 1972 novel \"Roadside Picnic\". In section three of which one of the character's, a noble laureate by the name of Valentine Pillman, explains Xenology as \"an unnatural mixture of science fiction and formal logic. At its core is a flawed assumption—that an alien race would be psychologically human.\"\n\nThe term xenology was employed by German Indologist Wilhelm Halbfass in his \"Indien und Europa, Perspektiven ihrer geistigen Begegnung\" (India and Europe: Perspectives on Their Spiritual Encounter) (1981) to denote the study of the ethnocentric views held by societies with regard to different classes of foreigner, in other words the positive or negative ways in which a given culture defines those outside or alien to it. Xenology is thus the study of the various modalities whereby self and otherness are defined \"within a historically complex collision of cultures\".\n\nRobert A. Freitas Jr. self-published a book on the subject, \"Xenology: An Introduction to the Scientific Study of Extraterrestrial Life, Intelligence, and Civilization\" (XRI, 1979). Freitas argued for the primacy of the term in the context of extraterrestrial life in a 1983 letter to the journal Nature.\n"}
