{"id": "57134064", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=57134064", "title": "Aggregated distribution", "text": "Aggregated distribution\n\nAn aggregated distribution, commonly found among predators and parasites, is a highly uneven (skewed) statistical distribution pattern in which they collect or aggregate in regions, which may be widely separated, where their prey or hosts are at high density. This distribution makes sampling difficult and invalidates commonly-used parametric statistics. A similar pattern is found among predators that search for their prey.\n\nWhen predators need to search for their prey, they could search at random, as has been assumed in models such as those made by Lotka in 1925 and Volterra in 1928. This would imply that they scatter themselves evenly across the environment. However, prey may be concentrated at high densities in some areas and scarce elsewhere. The zoologists M. P. Hassell and R. M. May noted that predators and parasites, too, might aggregate themselves where prey was abundant, choosing some response curve: they observed for example that redshanks (predatory birds) adopted a sigmoid (s-shaped) response to the density of \"Corophium\" (amphipod) prey per square metre of mudflats. They noted, too, that several different behaviours of predators or parasites could cause them to aggregate selectively in areas where prey are at high density: they could be attracted by a volatile substance liberated by prey or the plants they are feeding on; they could choose to spend more time in areas where they have caught prey, as many predators appear to do; or, predators could follow an individual predator which had located prey, as is seen in feeding terns. Aggregated distributions of predators where they tend to spend time in areas where prey are concentrated have the effect of stabilising prey populations; when the time to travel between such concentrated areas is high; and when the prey populations too are more highly clumped.\n\nParasite aggregation with respect to hosts is, according to Robert Poulin \"a defining feature of metazoan parasite populations.\" The main reason for this is probably either that some hosts are more exposed to parasites, or that they are more susceptible to them.\nAggregation is seen in directly transmitted parasites (those not using a vector) from many groups: ectoparasites like lice and mites, marine parasites like copepods and cyamid amphipods, and many kinds of nematode, fungi, protozoa, bacteria, and viruses. It is widespread, too, in trophically transmitted parasites of animals. The observed pattern is that most individual hosts are free or almost free of parasites, while a minority carry a large number of parasites.\n\nAggregated distribution of parasites across their hosts poses considerable problems for students of parasite ecology, as it renders parametric statistics as commonly used by biologists invalid. Log-transformation of data before the application of parametric test, or the use of non-parametric statistics is recommended by several authors, but this can give rise to further problems, so quantitative parasitology is based on more advanced biostatistical methods.\n"}

He was the only child of Prince Arthur of Connaught and Princess Alexandra, 2nd Duchess of Fife. He was a great-grandson of Queen Victoria through his father and also her great-great-grandson through his mother.\n\nIn 1942, he became the second Duke of Connaught and Strathearn and Earl of Sussex when he inherited his grandfather's title. In 1943, at the age of 28, he died in Canada of exposure, after falling out of a window in a state of inebriation.\n\nAlastair was born on 9 August 1914 at his parents' home at 54 Mount Street, Mayfair, London (now the Brazilian Embassy). His father was Prince Arthur of Connaught, the only son of Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught and Strathearn, and Princess Louise Margaret of Prussia. His mother was Princess Alexandra, 2nd Duchess of Fife, the eldest daughter of Alexander Duff, 1st Duke of Fife, and Louise, Princess Royal. Alastair was thus a great-grandchild of Queen Victoria through his father and great-great grandchild of her through his mother.\n\nThe Prince was baptised on 1 September 1914 at his parents' home and his godparents were King George V (his maternal great-uncle), King Alfonso XIII of Spain (for whom Lord Farquhar, a Lord in Waiting to King George, stood proxy), Queen Alexandra (his maternal great-grandmother), the Duke of Connaught (his grandfather, for whom Major Malcolm Murray stood proxy), Princess Louise, Duchess of Argyll (his great aunt), and Princess Mary (his cousin).\n\nPrince Alastair was born shortly after the First World War broke out, prompting strong anti-German feelings in the United Kingdom. George V eventually responded to this by changing the name of the Royal House from the House of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha to the House of Windsor and relinquishing all German titles belonging to members of the family who were British subjects.\n\nIn letters patent dated 20 November 1917, George V undertook further restructuring of the royal styles and titles by restricting the titles of Prince or Princess and the style of Royal Highness to the children of the sovereign, the children of the sovereign's sons, and the eldest living son of the eldest son of the Prince of Wales. This excluded Alastair, who was a great-grandson of a former sovereign but was not the eldest living son of the eldest son of the Prince of Wales. It further stated that all titles of \"the grandchildren of the sons of any such Sovereign in the direct male line (save only the eldest living son of the eldest son of the Prince of Wales) shall have the style and title enjoyed by the children of Dukes.\"\n\nLord Macduff received his education at Bryanston and at the Royal Military College, Sandhurst. On 31 January 1935, he received a commission as a second lieutenant in the Royal Scots Greys (2nd Dragoons), his father's regiment, which was based in Egypt from 1936. In 1939, Lord Macduff was promoted to lieutenant on 14 July, and was assigned to Ottawa as aide-de-camp to his kinsman The Earl of Athlone, then Governor General of Canada; his own grandfather had held the same post during the First World War.\n\nHe succeeded his grandfather as Duke of Connaught and Strathearn, and Earl of Sussex, in 1942. However, he died in 1943 at the age of 28 \"on active service\" in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, in unusual circumstances. The diaries of Sir Alan Lascelles, King George VI's private secretary, published in 2006, recorded that both the regiment and Athlone had rejected him as incompetent, and he fell out of a window when drunk and perished of hypothermia overnight. Theo Aronson, in his biography of Princess Alice, Countess of Athlone, simply stated that the Duke \"was found dead on the floor of his room at Rideau Hall on the morning of 26 April 1943. He had died, apparently, from hypothermia.\" Marlene Eilers Koenig, who wrote about the Duke's mother in an article for \"Majesty\" magazine, noted that he was found lying \"near an open window.\" Newspapers at the time cited the cause of death as \"natural causes.\"\n\nHis ashes were interred at St Ninian's Chapel, Braemar, Scotland.\n\n\nUntil the age of three, he was styled as \"Prince Alastair of Connaught\". However, in 1917, he lost the title of a British prince and the style of \"Highness\". After that, he was known as the \"Earl of Macduff\", this being the courtesy title he had as heir to his mother's Dukedom of Fife.\n\nIn 1942, on the inheritance of his grandfather's dukedom, he was granted arms, being, quarterly, first and fourth his grandfather's arms (being the royal arms, differenced with a three-point label argent, the first and third points bearing fleurs-de-lys azure, the second a cross gules), second and third that of Fife, and Duff.\n\nUpon his death, the Dukedom of Connaught and Strathearn and the Earldom of Sussex became extinct. His first cousin, James Carnegie (23 September 1929 – 22 June 2015), succeeded as 3rd Duke of Fife and Earl of Macduff upon Princess Alexandra's death on 26 February 1959.\n\nAlastair was born ninth in the line of succession, behind the six children of George V, his grandmother and his mother. When he died, he was 12th in the line of succession. His mother and he were the first two people in line behind the descendants of George V.\n"}

He is considered the founder of Casa d'Este (House of Este), having been head of the first family to be master of Este, a town of Padua.\n\nAlberto Azzo II was the only son of Albert Azzo I, Margrave of Milan and Adela of Milan. He inherited his father's offices around 1029, and continually increased his properties in northern Italy. Around 1073 he made a castle at Este his residence, from which the House of Este took its name. Before his building project, Este was little more than a village.\n\nIn the Investiture Controversy between Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor, and Pope Gregory VII, Azzo attempted to mediate, but later he joined the side of the pope. \n\nAzzo II married Kunigunde (also called Chuniza), the daughter of Welf II, Count of Altdorf, in 1035/6. Azzo's son with Chuniza, Welf, moved first to Carinthia and then to Bavaria, giving rise to one of the most important families in European history, the Guelphs. \n\nAround 1050, Azzo married again, to Garsende, daughter of Herbert I, Count of Maine, around 1050. In 1069–1070, he tried to acquire Maine for his son Hugh, because his wife, Garsende, was a co-heiress of the previous counts of Maine. Hugh was declared count, but he could not prevail against Robert, the Duke of Normandy, who had been betrothed to the last heiress. Another son from this marriage, Fulk I of Milan, made the first documented use of the title \"Marquis d'Este.\"\n\nWith his first wife, Chuniza, Azzo had one known child:\n\nWith his second wife, Garsende, Azzo had two known sons:\n\nSome sources say he also married Vitalia Orseolo, daughter of Peter Orseolo. They had a daughter: Itta.\n\nHe had an extra-marital affair with, or perhaps married, Matilda, sister of William/Guglielmo, Bishop of Pavia (r.1069-1102/3), with whom he had a daughter named Adelasia, who married Guglielmo Adelardi.\n\nAlberto Azzo II was extremely long-lived. He lived to at least his mid-80s and was perhaps one hundred years old when he died. He died in August 1097 at the monastery of Vangadizza, near Legnago, where he was buried.\n\n\n"}

Her baby son died at the same time and the story of her death played a huge part in a seminal national debate in the country at the time on women giving birth outside marriage.\n\nTuesday, 31 January 1984 was a cold, wet, winter's day in Granard, County Longford. That afternoon, the fifteen-year-old school girl left her Catholic Cnoc Mhuire Secondary School and made her way to a Grotto dedicated to the Virgin Mary at the top of her small hometown in the Irish midlands. It was here beneath the statue of Our Lady, that she gave birth, alone, to her infant son.\n\nAt around 4 pm that day some children on their way home from school saw Ann's schoolbag on the ground and discovered her lying in the Grotto. They alerted a passing farmer who rushed to the nearby priest's house to inform him of the chilling discovery of Ann and her already deceased baby in the adjacent grotto. The priest's response to his request for help was; \"It's a doctor you need\".\n\nAnn, still alive but hemorrhaging heavily, was carried to the house of the Parish Priest from where a doctor was phoned. She was then driven in the doctor's car to her parents house in the centre of the town. By the point an ambulance arrived it was already too late.\n\nAnn Lovett and her child were quietly buried three days later in Granardkill cemetery.\n\nOn Saturday night, 4 February 1984, Ireland's most popular television show was coming to an end, when the host read this headline from the next day's \"Sunday Tribune\" newspaper: \"Girl, 15, Dies Giving Birth In A Field\".\n\nWith the words \"Nothing terribly exciting there\", the newspaper was cast down on the studio floor by the \"Late Late Show\" host, Gay Byrne.\n\nThis moment marked the first introduction the world had to the story of Ann Lovett and her newborn child.\n\nA phonecall had been made to the Dublin newspaper by an anonymous caller from Granard and the story, broken in the \"Sunday Tribune\" by Emily O'Reilly, drew the attention of the world to the tragic incident. The next day Granard was swamped with national and international media.\n\nThe story shocked the nation and left many asking how such a thing could happen. For others it was an opportunity to finally reveal similar stories that had remained hidden for decades. The Gay Byrne show on RTÉ Radio began to receive letters from all over the country – \"Too many letters. They couldn't be ignored.\"\n\nThe local community and clergy, including the order of nuns at the school which Ann had attended remained tight lipped, apart from a terse statement, denying any knowledge of the teenager's pregnancy.\n\nWhile the statement issued by the nuns, following legal advice, said they \"did not know\" about her pregnancy, they subsequently refused to confirm whether they had suspected it or not.\n\nRumours also abounded about the identity of the child's father and the difficult family circumstances in which Ann herself was reared.\n\nMany residents of Granard, accused the media of being overly intrusive and of wrongly attaching blame to the community for the tragedy.\n\nIn National Archives of Ireland documents released in December 2014, a letter was revealed written by the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Armagh to poet Christopher Daybell which claimed Lovett's \"sad death reflects more on her immaturity than on any lack of Christian charity\".\n\nAn inquest was held in Mullingar a few weeks later and found that Ann's death was due to irreversible shock caused by haemorrhage and exposure during childbirth.\n\nThe inquest also confirmed that, contrary to claims emanating from the local community, some people did indeed know about Ann's pregnancy before her death.\n\nSubsequent enquiries by the Gardaí, the Department of Education and the Midlands Health Board have yet to be published leaving the tragic events of that day and the circumstances that forced a young girl to leave her classroom on a cold, wet winters day to give birth alone in a grotto, still shrouded in uncertainty.\n\nAnn Lovett's death came just four months after the outcome of a divisive abortion referendum in which a two-thirds majority voted to enshrine the right to life of the unborn in the constitution, creating confusion over where that left the rights of the mother.\n\nIn the ensuing public debate, the tragic events at Granard became symbolic of the emerging clash between church and state.\n\nIn the run-up to the 2018 Irish abortion referendum the case was again remembered. After publishing an extensive piece in March retracing the facts of the case, on 5 May 2018 the \"Irish Times\" carried a detailed interview with Ricky McDonnell, Ann Lovett's former boyfriend, coming forward for the first time and discussing the circumstances of their lives and their relationship. According to McDonnell, their close relationship had foundered when Lovett had found it difficult to continue, after she had come to him one night apparently having suffered a sexual assault. He did not know whether the child she had borne had been his, but he had lived with the tragic outcome for the rest of his life.\n\nTwelve years after Ann's death, Lorelei Harris, a producer on the Gay Byrne programme, decided to make a radio documentary on the letters sent to the show in the immediate aftermath of the Granard tragedy.\n\nShe sought the opinions of local people on the pregnancy and death of Ann Lovett. Journalists and broadcasters also talked about their experiences at the time. Contributors to this documentary include Emily O'Reilly, Kevin O'Connor and people from Granard. The \"Letters to Ann\" were read by Aidan Matthews and John MacKenna, with Ann-Marie Horan reading from the original Gay Byrne show letters.\n\nIn 2004, TG4 produced a 30-minute documentary in their \"Scannal\" series about the tragedy.\n\n"}

Schmidt\n\nAnna Maria Geertruida \"Annie\" Schmidt (20 May 1911 – 21 May 1995) was a Dutch writer. She is called the mother of the Dutch theatrical song, and the queen of Dutch children's literature, praised for her \"delicious Dutch idiom,\" and considered one of the greatest Dutch writers. An ultimate honour was extended to her posthumously, in 2007, when a group of Dutch historians compiled the \"Canon of Dutch History\" and included Schmidt, alongside national icons such as Vincent van Gogh and Anne Frank.\n\nAlthough Schmidt wrote poetry, songs, books, plays, musicals, and radio and television drama for adults, she is known best for children's books. Her best-known work for children may be the series \"Jip and Janneke\". Many of her books, such as \"Pluk van de Petteflet\", were illustrated by Fiep Westendorp.\n\nSchmidt received the 1988 Hans Christian Andersen Medal for her lasting contribution as a children's writer. The biennial award conferred by the International Board on Books for Young People is the highest recognition available to a writer or illustrator of children's books.\n\nBy the time she died in 1995 (of heart failure caused by euthanasia), she was an icon of the Dutch literary world, and even her death—peaceful, in the company of her friends and family—continues to be referenced in the Dutch media and played an important role in discussions of euthanasia.\n\nAnna Mannie Gannie \"Annie\" Schmidt was born on 20 May 1911 in Kapelle, Zeeland in the Netherlands. She was the daughter of Dutch Reformed minister Johannes Daniel Schmidt (1871–1951) and school teacher Geertruida Maria Bouhuijs. She had an elder brother Wim and two older sisters also named Anna M. G. who both died young and before she was born. She was called Zus () by her family.\n\nShe was a solitary child, who found an escape in writing poetry and fiction, even though she once received a grade of 2 (on a scale of 1 to 10) in Dutch class—she would later brag about the report card. Her mother encouraged her and sent some of her poetry to Willem Kloos.\n\nAfter secondary school in Goes and working as an au pair in Germany, she began to study for a job as a librarian, an occupation she held until 1946.\n\nIn 1947, she embarked upon her literary career while writing for the Amsterdam newspaper \"Het Parool\", and shortly after started writing songs and sketches for such luminaries as Wim Sonneveld and Wim Kan.\n\nHer literary career took off in the early 1950s, and included song- and playwriting for the theatre, scripts for radio and television shows, columns for newspapers, and children's books.\n\nHer final book, \"Wat Ik Nog Weet\", a book of childhood memories, appeared in 1992. She used euthanasia a day after her 84th birthday (with a combination of pills and alcohol) and was buried in Amsterdam.\n\nBy the time she died in 1995 (of heart failure caused by euthanasia), she was an icon of the Dutch literary world, and even her death—peaceful, in the company of her friends and family—continues to be referenced in the Dutch media and played an important role in discussions of euthanasia. Her life became the subject of plays in 2003 and 2009, her work continues to be in print, and her plays are still performed (such as 1980's \"\", a play discussing euthanasia, performed again in 1999).\n\nShe is included as one of the topics in the Canon of Dutch History, which was prepared by a committee headed by Frits van Oostrom and presented to the Minister of Education, Culture and Science, Maria van der Hoeven, in 2006; the Canon is a list of fifty topics that aims to provide a chronological summary of Dutch history to be taught in primary schools and the first two years of secondary school in the Netherlands. A revised version, which still includes her as one of the topics, was presented to the Dutch government on 3 October 2007.\n\n\nSchmidt began writing \"Jip en Janneke\" while working in Amsterdam at \"Het Parool\". Jip and Janneke are two children who live next to each other, and engaged in short, self-contained adventures every week (apparently, some story lines were based on real adventures involving Schmidt's son Flip and the girl next door). The stories were illustrated by Fiep Westendorp. The first was published 13 September 1952, the last 7 September 1957; a total of eight book collections were published between 1953 and 1960. Jip and Janneke are among the best-known children's characters in the Netherlands—they were listed first on a list of \"five typically Dutch phenomena\"—and their likeness is marketed on a variety of products sold by the HEMA department stores.\n\n\"Minoes\" (1970) is the story of a cat who turns into a young lady and, by spreading gossip from the cat world, helps a young journalist keep his job at the newspaper. In 2001, a movie version was directed by Vincent Bal based on a script by Burny Bos; it became one of the most popular Dutch children's movies abroad. Winning two Golden Calves, \"Minoes\" was the best-selling Dutch children's movie to date, and the DVD was certified platinum in 2002. More than 815,000 people saw it in the theatre, making it the highest-selling Dutch movie of the year, beating \"Costa!\" and \"The Discovery of Heaven\". The movie won first prize at the 2002 Chicago International Children's Film Festival. \nThe book \"Minoes\" has been translated into English as \"Minnie\" (1992) and as \"The Cat Who Came In off the Roof\" (2014).\n\nIn 1952 Schmidt began writing a radio show, the immensely popular \"De Familie Doorsnee\", which ran until 1958. In 1957 she began writing \"Pension Hommeles\", a musical comedy on VARA television.\n\nIn the 1960s Schmidt wrote one of the most popular Dutch television series of all time, (English: \"Yes Nurse! No Nurse!\"), later the inspiration for the 2002 film of the same name.\n\nAccording to Rieks Swarte, who adapted her 1962 comic strip \"Tante Patent\" to a play (with music by Fay Lovski) in 2007, that story was the breeding ground for \"Ja Zuster, Nee Zuster.\"\n\n\n"}
{"id": "42442584", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=42442584", "title": "April 27 demonstrations", "text": "April 27 demonstrations\n\nThe April 27 demonstrations were massive student marches throughout major cities in China during the Tiananmen Square Protests of 1989. The students were protesting in response to the April 26 Editorial published by the \"People's Daily\" the previous day. The editorial asserted that the student movement was anti-party and contributed to a sense of chaos and destabilization. The content of the editorial incited the largest student protest of the movement thus far in Beijing: 50,000–200,000 students marched through the streets of Beijing before finally breaking through police lines into Tiananmen Square.\n\nAfter the editorial was published, the students at Peking University in Beijing met during the night to discuss their plans for a march on April 27. Some of the authorities in the school tried to coax the students into calling it off; they gave hints that if the students did not protest, then the school officials would use their government connections to begin dialogues. But the students were too upset to stand down, and their enthusiasm to march could not be quelled. They compromised: they would only march part of the way, up to the Third Ring Road, but not all the way to Tiananmen Square itself. One scholar observed that the students thought it would show that they \"rejected the April 26 editorial but would not constitute a major provocation,\" because the students were still scared of the government using retaliatory force.\n\nAlthough students had demonstrated before, the April 27 demonstrations were particularly significant, in part because their scale was the largest instance of defying the state since 1949. Students were protesting across China: \"not only in cities where demonstrations had already taken place, such as Shanghai, Tianjin, Changchun, Xi'an, Wuhan, Nanjing, Hangzhou, Hefei, Changsha, Chengdu, and Chongqing, but also in cities where demonstrations now broke out for the first time: Shenyang, Dalian, Shijiazhuang, Nanning, Kunming, Shenzhen, Yinchuan, and Guilin.\" \n\nThe Beijing demonstration was the largest, with one conservative estimate at 30,000 students marching, but most sources claim between 150,000-200,000 were present. It is difficult to ascertain the exact number of student protesters, however, because there were so many citizens from Beijing cheering them on and supporting them in solidarity. This is another reason why this demonstration was significant. In the words of economist Chu-yuan Cheng, it was the first time that a \"pro-democracy student protest campaign drew enthusiastic support from the masses.\" According to two Canadian journalists, the April 26 editorial had also \"struck a raw nerve within the general populace\" and the focus on themes like corruption and inflation stirred the people's sympathy. Many of students were carrying signs or banners, not advocating for overthrowing the CPC, which the April 26 editorial had accused them of, but rather focused on democracy and cracking down on corruption. According to Chai Ling, a student protester who would later become a leader of the Hunger Strike Group, the Beijing Students' Autonomous Federation had planned to stage a demonstration in the Square on April 27 even \"before the government verdict appeared in the \"People's Daily\".\"\n\nMany officials were worried about the size and support of the demonstrations: Yang Shangkun, with Deng Xiaoping's permission, had five hundred troops of Beijing Military Region's Thirty-Eighth Army enter Beijing in case the demonstrations got out of hand. This was in addition to all the available Beijing police, which included students from the police academy. But thousands of workers surrounded the soldiers and cut them off from the students; some of the workers even cleared aside police barricades to let the students march onward. The students, marching for fourteen hours, gained more support as they went on, and Canadian journalist Scott Simmie estimated that half a million citizens participated in the demonstration.\n\nDespite the presence of police and military, there was little-to-no violence or altercations between them and the students. Both sides were self-disciplined, and according to a few observing citizens, some of the students even shook officers' hands and chanted \"the people's police love the people.\" The police did not resort to violence either; they temporarily slowed down the marchers before ultimately stepping aside and letting them pass. There was also little-to-no vandalism or trouble from the students in general: one Chinese bystander remarked that \"even the vagabonds and thieves were on their good behaviour this time. No one wanted to stir up trouble.\" This only served to buoy the students' feelings of elation, and instead of abandoning the march at the Third Ring Road, as planned, their enthusiasm compelled them to continue all the way to Tiananmen Square.\n\nFrom the students' perspective, the April 27 demonstrations were a milestone in the student movement: they realized that they had the potential to make a difference. For the first time, the students were speaking for the people and workers; they did not focus solely on the interests of students and intellectuals. In one scholar's interpretation, the people were unable to protest and demonstrate, so the student demonstrations took on the \"silent frustrations of the population.\" It was also the first case of when the students faced official resistance, such as police lines and a military presence, whom they interacted with peacefully. The government became more placatory and held dialogues with the students afterwards, which encouraged them to continue protesting. It served to revitalize the movement and inspired the students by showing that their actions had serious consequences. One big-character poster was put up on the next day at People's University, explaining the attitude of the students in the aftermath: \"those of us who went through the experience agree: the march was a great victory in the process of democratization in China.\" This was the immediate sensation of many of the students involved, but their elation was short-lived. The talks with the government would not go well, and the threat of violence would loom over the dialogues. Some observers even claim that these protests were not free from violence. A foreign medical student saw that \"three or four students were brought into intensive care that evening, badly beaten, one allegedly with a broken back.\" After news of this, another student said that \"'blood will be shed…'where this would happen, or how soon it might come, he could not say, but he felt that it was coming.\" While violence may not have been inevitable, the events after the April 27 demonstrations did not reflect the students' triumphant attitude at the time.\n\n"}

Marwan spied for the Egyptian intelligence agency during the 1973 Yom Kippur War, feeding Egypt strategic information on the location of Israeli military assets\n\nFrom 1969, Marwan served in the Presidential Office, first under Nasser and, then as a close aide to his successor, President Anwar Sadat. In 2002 it became known that, during the period leading up to the October 1973 Yom Kippur War, Marwan spied for Israel (under the Mossad code-name \"The Angel\"). However, some Egyptian sources claim he was a double agent working for the Egyptian intelligence, although this has never been confirmed. His warning on 5 October 1973 that \"war will start tomorrow\", triggered an emergency Israeli military mobilization and prevented both a complete surprise on 6 October and the complete occupation of the Golan Heights by the Syrian Army a day later. Marwan died under mysterious circumstances in June 2007, falling from the balcony of his expensive London house.\n\nMaj. Gen. (ret.) Zvi Zamir, the Mossad Chief who was one of Marwan's handlers, describes him as \"the best source we have ever had\". Simon Parkin, a British journalist who investigated the case, regards him as the \"20th century's greatest spy\". Others claim that Marwan was a \"double-spy\" who worked for Sadat and deceived the Israelis. Recent evidence has questioned this claim.\n\nMarwan was born in Egypt on 2 February 1944 to a respected family. His grandfather was the chief of the Sharia courts in Egypt, and his father, a military officer, reached the rank of General in the Egyptian Republican Guard. In 1965, at the age of 21, Marwan graduated Cairo University with a degree in chemical engineering and was conscripted into the army. At the same year he met Mona Nasser, the president’s second daughter, who was 17 at the time. She fell in love with him, but her father suspected that Marwan’s interest in his daughter stemmed more from her political status than her personal charms. Nevertheless, under her pressure, he agreed to the marriage, which took place in July 1966.\n\nIn 1968 Marwan started working in the Presidential Office under Sami Sharaf, Nasser’s aide-de-camp and the strong man of the Egyptian security service, who kept an eye on him. In late 1968 Marwan, Mona, and their new-born son, Gamal, left for London, allegedly for the continuation of Marwan’s studies. A few months later the young couple was ordered by Nasser, who was irritated by information concerning their lavish lifestyle, to return to Egypt, where Marwan continued working under Sami Sharaf.\n\nMarwan's service at the Presidential Office lasted eight years (1968–1976). Although, under Nasser, he held only a junior position, the president used him sometimes for delicate missions such as calming the crisis that erupted following General Saad al Shazly’s resignation from the army when his rival was nominated as chief of staff. Following Nasser's death in September 1970, Marwan became a close aide to President Sadat, who needed him by his side in order to demonstrate that he had the support of Nasser's family. In May 1971 Marwan played an important role in defeating an alleged coup attempt by Nasser's loyalists, including Sami Sharaf, against Sadat's rule. Following these events, known as the \"Corrective Revolution\", Sharaf was arrested and Sadat nominated Marwan to replace him. Despite his official title, Marwan was actually Sadat's personal emissary, in charge of relations with Saudi Arabia and Libya.\n\nIn his new capacity, Marwan developed excellent relations with the Saudi and the Libyan leaderships. In Saudi Arabia he worked hand in hand with Kamal Adham, King Feisal's brother-in-law, who established and supervised the Saudi security service. In Libya he was close to Muammar Gaddafi, and his counterpart for many missions was the Libyan Prime Minister, Abdessalam Jalloud. Both Saudi Arabia and Libya provided Egypt with critical financial and military assistance before the Yom Kippur War. Libya delivered to Egypt Mirage-5 aircraft that were considered critical for the coming war and which, under the French embargo, could not be sold directly to Egypt. Marwan managed this Libyan-Egyptian deal as well as other highly sensitive issues.\n\nAfter the 1973 war Marwan continued his way to the top. On 14 February 1974 he became Secretary to the President of the Republic for Foreign Relations, a new position that reflected Sadat's ruling style. Given Sadat's dissatisfaction with the conduct of his Foreign Minister, Ismail Fahmy, Marwan was considered as a candidate to replace him.\n\nBy this stage, however, he accumulated a considerable number of personal enemies, who accused him of using his position near Sadat to gain personal wealth. When these accusations gained momentum, Sadat had to yield to the pressure and in March 1976 he ended Marwan's service in the Presidential Office.\n\nMarwan was nominated to head the Arab Organization for Industrialization, an arms production complex in Cairo that was financed by Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and Qatar. Following additional political pressures, Sadat had to relieve him from this position in October 1978.\n\nFollowing Sadat's assassination in October 1981, Marwan left Egypt and started a business career in London. He gained a reputation as a mysterious man who did not play according to the rules of the City. Among others he was involved in the failed attempt by Tiny Rowland to take over the House of Fraser – a group of department stores, whose jewel in the crown was Harrods, where the English aristocracy used to shop. Marwan amassed significant wealth which has, to this day, never been disclosed. \n\nEgypt had begun preparing a war with the aim of retaking the Sinai Peninsula that it had lost to the Israelis in the 1967 Six Day War. Marwan’s unparalleled access to his nation’s best-kept secrets, especially after his promotion in May 1971, allowed him to provide Israel with information about the coming war—including the full Egyptian war plans, detailed accounts of military exercises, original documentation of Egypt’s arm deals with the Soviet Union and other countries, the Egyptian military Order of Battle, the minutes from meetings of the high command, accounts of Sadat’s private conversations with other Arab leaders, and even the minutes of secret summit meetings in Moscow between Sadat and Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev. As a senior Israeli intelligence officer had said, by providing these documents Marwan turned his country, Israel’s main enemy, into an open book.\n\nThe information Marwan provided made its way to the desks of Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir, Defense Minister Moshe Dayan, and the Israeli Defense Force (IDF) chief of staff in raw form. It shaped Israel’s strategic and tactical approach to Egypt and allowed the Israelis a direct look at Egypt’s war calculus, including Sadat’s minimal requirements for launching a war. These were mainly long-range attack aircraft and Scud missiles, without which Egypt would not be able to overcome Israeli air superiority.\n\nIn October 1973 Sadat decided to launch war without waiting for these arms and Egypt accelerated its war preparations. Marwan reported on Sadat's decision and the military preparations for war but personally he expressed the estimate that ultimately Egypt would be deterred from militarily challenging Israel. Nevertheless, in April he (as well as other Mossad sources), warned that Egypt planned to attack in mid-May. Israel raised its state-of military readiness, but war did not come, probably because President Assad of Syria convinced Sadat to delay it until Syria was better prepared to occupy the Golan Heights. Known in Israel as \"the Blue-White\" alert, this episode eroded Israeli fear of an Arab attack. Consequently, by fall 1973, when Egypt and Syria geared to war, military intelligence leaders, including Eli Zeira, refused to accept, despite numerous warnings and warning indicators, that the Arabs plan to attack. Accordingly, Israel’s leadership avoided the mobilization of the reserve army which in 1973 constituted 80% of the IDF ground forces.\n\nOn Thursday, 4 October, about 44 hours before war launched, Marwan called Dubi, his Mossad handler in London, and asked to meet urgently the Mossad chief in order to talk about \"a lot of chemicals\" (code name for war). The meeting took place on Friday late at night in London and Marwan informed Zamir that \"war would start tomorrow\". As became evident recently, he did not know the exact D-Day when calling Dubi on Thursday and learned about it only after arriving in London on Friday morning. Because of this warning, Israel began mobilizing its forces on the morning of 6 October—hours before the attack was launched. Marwan's warning prevented a complete Egyptian surprise. Without it, the entire Golan Heights would have been lost, and the war likely would have ended with far greater Israeli losses of both territory and life. During the war he met with Zamir once more in order to explain Sadat's warnings in a speech in the Egyptian Parliament, to launch missiles on Israel. The meeting took place in Paris on 18 October.\n\nOn 28 October, a few days after the war ended and two days before Golda Meir started critical talks in the White House, Zamir conferred with \"the Angel\" once more to get information about Sadat's goals in the Egyptian-Israeli negotiations that were to start. \n\nMarwan continued working for the Mossad until 1998 and was handled throughout this period by his single case officer, Dubi. His identity as a spy for Israel was revealed in December 2002, by the London-based Israeli historian Ahron Bregman, who claimed that Marwan was a double-spy who deceived the Israelis. Bregman’s source was Maj. Gen. (ret.) Eli Zeira, the director of Israel’s Military Intelligence in the 1973 War and the main culprit in the intelligence fiasco prior to the war.\n\nMarwan married Mona Abdel Nasser in the 1960s. One of Marwan's sons was married to the daughter of former Arab League Secretary General Amr Moussa. His other son, Gamal, is the owner of the television group \"Melody\" and a close friend of Gamal Mubarak, the son of former Egyptian President Husni Mubarak.\n\nMarwan died on 27 June 2007 outside his flat in Carlton House Terrace, London. The cause of death was traumatic aortic rupture following a fall from the balcony of his fifth-floor apartment. News reports indicate that the Metropolitan Police Service increasingly believe Marwan was murdered, a belief also held by Marwan's eldest son, Gamal. Marwan's funeral in Egypt was led by Egypt's highest-ranked religious leader, Muhammad Sayyid Tantawy, and attended by, amongst others, Gamal Mubarak, son of the former Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, and intelligence chief Omar Suleiman. According to President Mubarak, \"Marwan carried out patriotic acts which it is not yet time to reveal.\" Following a case review in January 2008, the investigation was transferred to the Specialist Crime Directorate, both because of its public nature and because the shoes Marwan was wearing when he fell, key evidence in the case, had been lost.\n\nOne witness, who was on the third floor of a nearby building, told police that he saw two men \"wearing suits and of Mediterranean appearance\" appear on the balcony moments after Marwan's fall, look down, and then return inside the apartment. Police are also reported to have lost Marwan's shoes, which could hold clues on whether or not Marwan jumped from the balcony.\n\nMarwan is the fourth Egyptian of note to die in London in a similar manner. The others, all of whom were involved in Egyptian politics between 1966 and 1971, are actress Suad Hosni; Egyptian ambassador to Greece Al-Leithy Nassif; and Ali Shafeek, secretary in the office of former Egyptian Vice President Abdel Hakim Amer.\n\nAt the time of the investigation, Marwan's wife said she believed that Mossad was behind his death. However, an analysis in \"The Guardian\" found this scenario to be unlikely: \"For one thing, killing a former agent after his name is revealed would seem to be a major disincentive for new recruits. Even if Israel believed that Marwan was a double agent, working for the Egyptians, better to do nothing and, through their silence, imply he was faithful to their cause.\" Further, Marwan was at least the third Egyptian living in London to die under similar circumstances, all of whom had ties with the Egyptian security services.\n\nEgyptian journalist Amr Ellissy conducted an investigation into Marwan's death for his documentary series \"Ekhterak\", broadcast on Egyptian television in six episodes on the first anniversary of Marwan's death. \"Ekhterak\" was filmed in Marwan's London apartment and included interviews with his son, a witness, and acquaintances of Marwan. Ellissy published his book \"The Agent Babel\" in Arabic through Dar Al Shorouq press, and it was launched on 2 February 2009.\n\nThe British magazine \"Private Eye\" also followed the story closely and suggested that there was considerable cause for suspicion surrounding the circumstances of Marwan's death.\n\nAhron Bregman, published in 2016 a book on his relationship with Ashraf Marwan, titled \"The Spy Who Fell to Earth\". In 2017, Salon Productions purchased the rights to turn the book into a feature documentary.\n\nProfessor Uri Bar-Joseph wrote a book published in 2016 titled \"The Angel: The Egyptian Spy Who Saved Israel\", which was later used as the basis of a Netflix film, \"The Angel\". Bar-Joseph's book addresses whether Marwan was a genuine spy or a double agent. In a review of the book in the CIA's \"Studies in Intelligence\", Thomas G. Coffey states that the book persuasively \"argues that the nature of the intelligence Marwan gave the Israelis was simply too destructive of Egyptian interests\" for Marwan to have been a double agent, and that it offers \"a convincing defense\" against the claim that the intelligence he provided was \"late, flawed, and of little practical use.\"\n"}

{"id": "43956835", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=43956835", "title": "Binding neuron", "text": "Binding neuron\n\nA binding neuron (BN) is an abstract mathematical model of the electrical activity of a neuron, closely related to well-known integrate-and-fire model. The BN model originated in a 1998 paper by A. K. Vidybida \n\nFor a generic neuron the stimuli are excitatory impulses. Normally, more than single input impulse is necessary for exciting neuron up to the level when it fires and emits an output impulse.\nLet the neuron receives formula_1 input impulses at consecutive moments of time formula_2. In the BN concept the temporal coherence formula_3 between input impulses is defined as follows\n\nformula_4\n\nThe high degree of temporal coherence between input impulses suggests that in external media all formula_1 \nimpulses can be created by a single complex event. Correspondingly, if BN is stimulated by a highly coherent set of input impulses, it fires and emits an output impulse. In the BN terminology, BN binds the elementary events (input impulses) into a single event (output impulse). The binding happens if the input impulses are enough coherent in time, and does not happen if those impulses do not have required degree of coherence.\n\nInhibition in the BN concept (essentially, the slow somatic potassium inhibition) controls the degree of temporal coherence required for binding: the higher level of inhibition, the higher degree of temporal coherence is necessary for binding to occur.\n\nThe emitted output impulse is treated as abstract representation of the compound event (the set of coherent in time input impulses), see Scheme.\n\n\"Although a neuron requires energy, its main function is to receive signals and to send them out that is, to handle information.\" --- this words by Francis Crick point at the necessity to describe neuronal functioning in terms of processing of abstract signals \nThe two abstract concepts, namely, the \"coincidence detector\" and \"temporal integrator\" are offered in this course,\nThe first one expects that a neuron fires a spike if a number of input impulses are received at the same time. In the temporal integrator concept a neuron fires a spike after receiving a number of input impulses distributed in time.\nEach of the two takes into account some features of real neurons since it is known that a realistic neuron can display\nboth coincidence detector and temporal integrator modes of activity depending on the stimulation applied,\nAt the same time, it is known that a neuron together with excitatory impulses receives also inhibitory stimulation.\nA natural development of the two above mentioned concepts could be a concept which endows inhibition with its own signal processing role.\n\nIn the neuroscience, there is an idea of binding problem. \nFor example, during visual perception, such features as form, color and stereopsis are represented in the brain by \ndifferent neuronal assemblies. The mechanism ensuring those features to be perceived as belonging to a single real object is called \"feature binding\",\nThe experimentally approved opinion is that precise temporal coordination between neuronal impulses is required for the binding to occur,\n,\n,\nThis coordination mainly means that signals about different features must arrive to certain areas in the brain within a certain time window.\n\nThe BN concept reproduces at the level of single generic neuron the requirement, which is necessary for the feature binding to occur, and which was \nformulated earlier at the level of large-scale neuronal assemblies.\nIts formulation is made possible by the analysis of response of the \nHodgkin–Huxley model to stimuli similar to those the real neurons receive\nin the natural conditions, see \"Mathematical implementations\", below.\n\nHodgkin–Huxley model — physiologically substantiated neuronal model, \nwhich operates in terms of\ntransmembrane ionic currents, and describes mechanism of generation of action potential.\n\nIn the paper\nthe response of the H-H model was studied numerically to stimuli formula_6 composed of many\nexcitatory impulses distributed randomly within a time window formula_7:\n\nformula_8\n\nHere formula_9 denotes magnitude of \nexcitatory postsynaptic potential at moment formula_10; \nformula_11 — is the moment of arrival of formula_12-th impulse; formula_13 — is the total number of impulses the \nstimulus is composed of. The numbers formula_11 are random, \ndistributed uniformly within interval\nformula_15. The stimulating current applied in the H-H equations \nis as follows\n\nformula_16\n\nwhere formula_17 — is the capacity of unit area of excitable membrane.\nThe probability to generate action potential was calculated as a function \nof the window width formula_7.\nDifferent constant potassium conductances were added to the H-H equations \nin order to create certain levels of \ninhibitory potential. The dependencies obtained, if recalculated as functions of formula_19, \nwhich is analogous to temporal coherence of impulses in the compound stimulus, have step-like form.\nThe location of the step is controlled by the level of inhibition potential, \nsee Fig. 1. \nDue to this type of dependence, the H-H equations can be treated as mathematical model of the BN concept.\n\nLeaky integrate and fire neuron is a widely used abstract neuronal model.\nIf to state a similar problem for the LIF neuron with appropriately chosen \ninhibition mechanism,\nthen it is possible to obtain step-like dependencies similar to the Fig. 1 \nas well.\nTherefore, the LIF neuron as well can be considered as mathematical model of the BN concept.\n\nThe binding neuron model implements the BN concept in the most refined form.\nIn this model each input impulse is stored in the neuron during fixed \ntime formula_20 and then disappears.\nThis kind of memory serves as surrogate of the \nexcitatory postsynaptic potential.\nThe model has a threshold formula_21: if the number of stored in \nthe BN impulses exceeds formula_21\nthen the neuron fires a spike and clears it internal memory. The presence of \ninhibition results in the decreased formula_20.\n\nIn the BN model, it is necessary to control the time to live of any stored \nimpulse during calculation of the neuron's\nresponse to input stimulation. This makes the BN model more complicated \nfor numerical simulation than the LIF model.\nOn the other hand, any impulse spends finite time formula_20 \nin the BN model neuron. This is in contrast to the\nLIF model, where traces of any impulse can be present infinitely long. \nThis property of the BN model allows to\nget precise description of output activity of BN stimulated with random \nstream of input impulses, see\n\nThe limiting case of BN with infinite memory, \"τ\"→∞, corresponds to \nthe temporal integrator.\nThe limiting case of BN with infinitely short memory, \"τ\"→0, corresponds \nto the coincidence detector.\n\nThe above-mentioned and other neuronal models and nets made of them can be implemented in microchips. Among different chips it is worth mentioning the field-programmable gate arrays. These chips can be used for implementation of any neuronal model, but the BN model can be programmed most naturally because it can use only integers and do not need solving differential equations. Those features are used, e.g. in and\n\nAs an abstract concept the BN model is subjected to necessary limitations. Among those are such as ignoring neuronal morphology, identical magnitude of input impulses, replacement of a set of transients with different relaxation times, known for a real neuron, with a single time to live, formula_20, of impulse in neuron, the absence of refractoriness and fast (chlorine) inhibition. The BN model has the same limitations, yet some of them can be removed in a complicated model, see, e.g., where the BN model is used with refractoriness and fast inhibition.\n"}

Primarily an enemy of Daredevil, he is also an enemy of the Punisher and Wolverine.\n\nCreated by Ann Nocenti and Rick Leonardi, the character made his first appearance in \"Daredevil\" #248 (November 1987).\n\nOriginally a priest, Carl Burbank abandoned his vows following the drug-related deaths of young parishioners. He joined the C.I.A., which outfitted him with a cybernetic arm and made him an assassin under the codename \"Bushwacker\", but ultimately he became a freelancer.\n\nAt some point, an event took place that compelled Bushwacker to begin a war against all mutants. Bushwacker began hunting and assassinating mutants, most often those mutants whose abilities Bushwacker perceived as making them especially talented in \"the arts\". Bushwacker also claimed that he was paid large sums of money to kill mutants, but this has yet to be verified. Wolverine learned of Bushwacker's activities and began to hunt the killer. At the same time, Bushwacker's wife Marilyn believed her husband was insane and needed to be placed in a hospital. She sought aid from lawyer Matt Murdock (secretly the hero Daredevil). Bushwacker was tracked down and defeated by the two heroes, which left the right side of his face horribly scarred, and he was placed in police custody.\n\nLater, Bushwacker joined with Typhoid Mary and other enemies of Daredevil in a plan to kill their common foe. After the completion of the plan, Bushwacker was left to his own activities.\n\nEntering the Kingpin's employ, Burbank attacked the Punisher, but was left for dead. It was during this time that his wife finally left him. He reappeared in the employ of drug lord Nick Lambert, who hired Bushwacker to kill reporter Ben Urich, who was about to run a story of his illegal activities. Instead, when Bushwacker learned the truth, he allowed Urich to live and to complete the exposé. However, the drug lord managed to bribe himself out of jail. Bushwacker then killed him. Bushwacker was later freed by Deathlok from captivity by Mecha Doom.\n\nSubsequent activities brought him into conflict with Daredevil, Nomad, the Punisher, Boomerang, and Elektra. His clash with Nomad was over the life of a baby that Nomad had taken under his care whom Bushwacker believed to be the daughter of Troy Donohue, Burbank's ex-brother-in-law (she was in the fact the daughter of Nomad's foe, the drug lord Umberto Saffilios and a teenaged prostitute). Bushwacker hoped that his wife would approve of his \"rescue\" and welcome him back into her life.\n\nImprisoned in the super-villain holding facility the Raft, Burbank escaped during the mass breakout engineered by Electro. Burbank was subsequently employed by the Jackal to kill the Punisher, but was defeated once again by Daredevil. Following this, Bushwacker created a disturbance in downtown Manhattan and took a woman hostage to lure the Punisher out of hiding and kill him. The Punisher showed up as expected. As it turns out, G.W. Bridge arranged the incident in Times Square with Bushwacker to ambush and capture The Punisher. Although complications arose by an on-site NYPD officer the incident fell through, the Punisher escaped, and Bushwacker was defeated by S.H.I.E.L.D. operative G. W. Bridge and put back in jail.\n\nThe Hood has hired him as part of his criminal organization to take advantage of the split in the superhero community caused by the Superhuman Registration Act. He helped them fight the New Avengers but was taken down by Doctor Strange.\n\nAs part of the Hood's gang, he later joins the fight against the Skrull invading force in New York City. He was with the Hood when he presented the Scorpion costume to whichever crook impressed him until the party was crashed by Scorpion, who stole the costume.\n\nBushwacker was seen during the Siege of Asgard as part of the Hood crime syndicate.\n\nIn \"X-Force: Sex and Violence\" #2, Bushwacker was apparently killed by Wolverine after an assassination attempt on him and Domino. He was killed with a middle claw to the throat.\n\nDuring the \"Civil War II\" storyline, Kingpin encounters Bushwacker in San Francisco.\n\nBushwacker's right arm has been altered bionically so that it can function as a gun. He can fire bullets from his index finger as if his hand were a pistol. Using his left hand, he can alter the configuration of his right arm, allowing it to function in several modes that replicate the effects of a number of weapons, including a machine gun and a shotgun. He employs powerful gadgets and weapons, most notably a flamethrower, all of which can be created by the mechanical prostheses that have replaced his forearms. He manages to load the weapons by swallowing ammo, such as bullets or flamethrower fuel. Bushwacker's skin can liquefy to seal wounds. There are some versions that take this a step further, having Bushwacker be able to use highly concussive energy weaponry (very similar to that of Iron Man or War Machine), and even be able to morph his arm into blades as a last resort.\n\nIn the \"Daredevil vs. Punisher\" miniseries, it was implied that his powers are actually a natural mutation, making the assassin himself one of the mutants he hates so much. However, this is contradicted by his other appearances which identify the origins of his powers as cybernetics.\n\nBushwacker has been trained in CIA hand-to-hand combat techniques, and is trained in infiltration and assassination. He also has familiarity with the workings of international intelligence agencies and their methods.\n\nBushwacker appeared in the House of M reality spin-off \"House of M: Masters of Evil\".\n\n\n"}

These edifices are associated with alternative worship and the emerging church movements, and seek to find new forms and approaches to existing as a church in the 21st century. These churches are often focused on relationship aspects of Christian fellowship and outreach to their local community, and use the modern gathering place of a café in their ministry.\n\nThe cafe church can be viewed as an organically based philosophy for planting churches, centered around the idea of making the message of Christ's love relevant to the needs of the local community that the church seeks to serve.\n\nThe \"Alma Mount Hope Coffeehouse Church\", of Alma, MI, says:\n\n\"The ministry statement for AMH Coffeehouse Church is found in Acts 2:42: 'And they continued steadfastly in the apostles' doctrine and fellowship, in the breaking of bread, and in prayers.'\" \n\nThe goal of cafe church endeavors is to impact their local community with a message of God's love and the transforming power of Christ's love.\n\nDepending on the leadership, some cafe church leaders will provide a clear doctrinal perspective, while others may be more open-minded and comfortable with members and visitors asking questions of speakers.\n\nFor example, \"One World Coffeehouse\" in Columbia, Maryland was founded by a church member who said, \"I felt that our church needed an outreach effort ... and a way to express principles such as multiculturalism and acceptance of others different from yourself.\"\n\nAnd the \"Glebe Café Church,\" in New South Wales, Australia states that:\n\n\"Café Church is a Glebe-based, non-traditional Christian faith community. We aim to provide an inclusive, accepting and welcoming space for everybody, no matter what their spiritual path. Café Church revolves around open discussion, creative expression and alternative approaches to worship. Our core values include hospitality, creativity, discipleship and social and environmental justice.\"\nChurches using the cafe as a model for their organization can take different forms. Some cafe churches maintain a permanent cafe or restaurant, which offers the local community a high-quality array of coffee, sandwiches, and food, and provides a venue where the members of the church fellowship meet. Church members may also volunteer their time to support the enterprise.\n\nOther churches simply use the cafe model as a way to build community, facilitating variation within their normal service structure and within the confines of their building, by serving coffee after or during the service in a predesignated area, or holding a coffeehouse event.\n\n\"Ebenezer's Coffeehouse\", in Washington, DC, operated by the National Community Church, is one example of a cafe church. Its website asks, \"How much more comfortable can you get sipping a Chai in church?\" This church is a multi-location church located at sites accessible by public transit, which links its indie music coffeehouse broadcasts to other locations via the Internet.\n\nAlso located in Washington is the \"Potters House,\" an outreach ministry of the Church of the Savior. Its website states, \"We, the members of that church, asked ourselves, 'Would Jesus want to hang out with folks at a traditional institutional church? or would he want to hang out over a beer in a bar or coffee in a restaurant?' The resounding answer was the latter. We chose coffee over beer because of our support for the budding AA movement in 1960.\"\n\nAn old congregation house of Oxford University, dating back to 1320, is home to \"The Vaults and Garden Cafe\", operated by the University Church of St Mary the Virgin, which specializes in organically grown and locally sourced foods. The cafe serves the community by catering events, and donating funds. Another religious organization specializing in healthy food is the International Society for Krishna Consciousness, which runs a chain of vegetarian restaurants called \"Govinda's\".\n\n\"The Loft\" coffeehouse, a project of Alamo Heights United Methodist Church, San Antonio, TX includes \"a food bank, thrift store and a resource center for the needy.\"\n\nCafé churches became more popular in the Christian community of South Korea around 2016, especially among younger Protestants, as an alternative to the traditional Korean megachurches' conservatism and perceived corruption.\n\nChurch-sponsored coffeehouses have a long history in the United States. For example, Nameless Coffeehouse has operated for over 40 years (since 1966) on the site of The First Parish Unitarian Universalist Church in Cambridge, MA. And fifty years ago, it was \"The Sacred Mushroom\" coffeehouse in Columbus, OH that hosted Phil Ochs; a local fan reminisced, \"One of his first public performances as a solo artist was at the First Unitarian Universalist Church on Weisheimer Road, where he performed for a ladies luncheon,\" she said with a laugh ... \"God only knows the songs he performed there.\"\nIn fact, Unitarian Universalists are a denomination particularly known for sponsoring folk coffeehouses.\n\n\"The welcoming environment of Unitarian Universalist coffeehouses has provided an artistic haven for a variety of performers and helped launch the entertainment careers of folk musicians such as Pete Seeger and Arlo Guthrie.\nFolk music is featured at \"The Old Ship Coffeehouse Off The Square\", located in the parish house of Old Ship Church in Hingham, MA, (which is, incidentally, \"the oldest English church in continuous use in America.\")\nThe First Congregational Church in Branford, CT sponsors the \"Branford Folk Coffeehouse\", a monthly folk music concert series held in its auditorium.\n\n\"Mom & Pop's Coffeehouse\", a folk concert series held in the sanctuary at United Christian Church in Levittown, PA, uses the altar as the stage, and has been held since 1994.\n\nAnd in 2011, the \"Good Folk Coffeehouse\" began its 21st concert season at the Rowayton United Methodist Church, in Rowayton, CT.\n\n\n"}

At the end of the war he worked as a securities salesman for the First California Company in Sacramento until 1950 when he joined the United States Marine Corps at the beginning of the Korean War. Later becoming acting First Sergeant, Headquarters Battery 2nd Battalion, 11th Marines while serving in South and Central Korea. On separation from the Marine Corp he settled in the San Francisco Bay Area where he was he was a developer and builder from 1954 till his disappearance in 1964\n\nAt 6 pm on August 12, 1964, Charles Ogle took off from Oakland International Airport in his Cessna 210A tail number N9492X. He did not file a flight plan and he did not radio the tower on takeoff. He was never seen or heard from again. It was originally reported that his planned flight destination was Reno, Nevada. A private investigator hired by his father later reported his actual destination was Las Vegas, Nevada.\n\nIn 2007 with the disappearance of Steve Fossett and during the subsequent search approximately eight unidentified plane wrecks were discovered. It was speculated that one of these aircraft could be the Cessna 210A that Charles Ogle was flying, or one of several other aircraft that have disappeared flying over the Sierra Nevada. Only one aircraft was partially identified. With the rest there has been no follow up by the civil authorities. The fate of Charles Ogle remains a mystery.\n\n"}

Jones\n\nCharles William Jones (December 24, 1834October 11, 1897) was a United States Senator from Florida. He abandoned the seat after an apparent onset of mental illness.\n\nJones was born in Balbriggan, Ireland. His father was a British army surgeon who died when he was a child. In 1844, Jones and his mother immigrated to New York City. After attending school in New York City and St. Louis, Missouri, Jones moved to Louisiana (in 1848) and Mississippi before settling in Santa Rosa County, Florida in 1854.\n\nJones was admitted to the Florida Bar in 1857, moved to Pensacola, Florida and was appointed tax assessor for Santa Rosa and Escambia Counties. He married Mary Ada Quigley in 1861 and they had four children before her death in 1880.\n\nIn 1872, Jones decided to try his hand at politics as a Democrat but was defeated by William Purman in a bid to become a U.S. representative. In 1874, Jones won a seat on the Florida House of Representatives, winning by only five votes.\n\nAfter gaining independent support, Jones made a second attempt at federal office and, this time, was successful. He began his first Senate term in 1875 and was hailed as an early success and an example of resurgence for the Democratic party in the Reconstruction era. Although criticized for his speaking style, Jones was elected to a second term in 1881.\n\nIn the spring of 1885, Jones announced he was taking a vacation in Canada and Detroit, Michigan. When the Detroit vacation extended into early 1886, questions started to be asked and gossip ensued. The most popular story was that Jones was pursuing - or even stalking - a wealthy younger woman named Clothilde Palms and was refusing to leave Detroit without her.\n\nBy April 1886, the speculation was that Jones had become insane. Around that time, the Senate leadership started replacing him on various committees. Although that move drew vocal ire from Jones, he continued to live in Detroit. Florida newspapers were campaigning for Jones to be replaced but Florida's Governor Edward A. Perry refused to take any action, citing, among other things, the lack of concrete rules regarding a senator who would not work but had not been officially declared physically or mentally impaired. Instead, Jones' seat went unfilled until his term expired in March 1887.\n\nAfter Jones' term – and salary – ended in 1887, his life quickly spiraled downward. By year's end, he had been evicted from his room in Detroit and reportedly became destitute. Doctors informed one of his sons that they would sign a certificate of insanity for legal purposes.\n\nIn spring of 1888, Jones had reportedly been reduced to common vagrancy. In May 1890, Jones' son was granted permission to have him restrained and a probate court was told that he conclusively suffered from monomania. Shortly thereafter, Senator Jones was taken into custody and brought to an asylum for the insane in Dearborn, Michigan where he stayed until his death over seven years later.\n\nDespite rampant gossip and speculation about both his mental state and Clothilde Palms, Jones himself never spoke publicly about either subject. The cause of his sudden decline remains a mystery.\n\nClothilde Palms married a Detroit surgeon in 1889 shortly before Jones was committed.\n\nCharles W. Jones is interred in Pensacola, Florida.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "263636", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=263636", "title": "Connectionism", "text": "Connectionism\n\nConnectionism is an approach in the fields of cognitive science, that hopes to explain mental phenomena using artificial neural networks (ANN).\nThe central connectionist principle is that mental phenomena can be described by interconnected networks of simple and often uniform units. The form of the connections and the units can vary from model to model. For example, units in the network could represent neurons and the connections could represent synapses, as in the human brain.\n\nIn most connectionist models, networks change over time. A closely related and very common aspect of connectionist models is \"activation\". At any time, a unit in the network has an activation, which is a numerical value intended to represent some aspect of the unit. For example, if the units in the model are neurons, the activation could represent the probability that the neuron would generate an action potential spike. Activation typically spreads to all the other units connected to it. Spreading activation is always a feature of neural network models, and it is very common in connectionist models used by cognitive psychologists.\n\nNeural networks are by far the most commonly used connectionist model today. Though there are a large variety of neural network models, they almost always follow two basic principles regarding the mind:\n\n\nMost of the variety among neural network models comes from:\n\nConnectionists are in agreement that recurrent neural networks (directed networks wherein connections of the network can form a directed cycle) are a better model of the brain than feedforward neural networks (directed networks with no cycles, called DAG). Many recurrent connectionist models also incorporate dynamical systems theory. Many researchers, such as the connectionist Paul Smolensky, have argued that connectionist models will evolve toward fully continuous, high-dimensional, non-linear, dynamic systems approaches.\n\nConnectionist work in general does not need to be biologically realistic and therefore suffers from a lack of neuroscientific plausibility.\n\nThe weights in a neural network are adjusted according to some learning rule or algorithm, such as Hebbian learning. Thus, connectionists have created many sophisticated learning procedures for neural networks. Learning always involves modifying the connection weights. In general, these involve mathematical formulas to determine the change in weights when given sets of data consisting of activation vectors for some subset of the neural units. Several studies have been focused on designing teaching-learning methods based on connectionism.\n\nBy formalizing learning in such a way, connectionists have many tools. A very common strategy in connectionist learning methods is to incorporate gradient descent over an error surface in a space defined by the weight matrix. All gradient descent learning in connectionist models involves changing each weight by the partial derivative of the error surface with respect to the weight. Backpropagation (BP), first made popular in the 1980s, is probably the most commonly known connectionist gradient descent algorithm today.\n\nConnectionism can be traced to ideas more than a century old, which were little more than speculation until the mid-to-late 20th century.\n\nThe prevailing connectionist approach today was originally known as parallel distributed processing (PDP). It was an artificial neural network approach that stressed the parallel nature of neural processing, and the distributed nature of neural representations. It provided a general mathematical framework for researchers to operate in. The framework involved eight major aspects:\n\n\nA lot of the research that led to the development of PDP was done in the 1970s, but PDP became popular in the 1980s with the release of the books \"Parallel Distributed Processing: Explorations in the Microstructure of Cognition - Volume 1 (foundations)\" and \"Volume 2 (Psychological and Biological Models)\", by James L. McClelland, David E. Rumelhart and the PDP Research Group. The books are now considered seminal connectionist works, and it is now common to fully equate PDP and connectionism, although the term \"connectionism\" is not used in the books.\n\nPDP's direct roots were the perceptron theories of researchers such as Frank Rosenblatt from the 1950s and 1960s. But perceptron models were made very unpopular by the book \"Perceptrons\" by Marvin Minsky and Seymour Papert, published in 1969. It demonstrated the limits on the sorts of functions that single-layered (no hidden layer) perceptrons can calculate, showing that even simple functions like the exclusive disjunction (XOR) could not be handled properly. The PDP books overcame this limitation by showing that multi-level, non-linear neural networks were far more robust and could be used for a vast array of functions.\n\nMany earlier researchers advocated connectionist style models, for example in the 1940s and 1950s, Warren McCulloch and Walter Pitts (MP neuron), Donald Olding Hebb, and Karl Lashley. McCulloch and Pitts showed how neural systems could implement first-order logic: Their classic paper \"A Logical Calculus of Ideas Immanent in Nervous Activity\" (1943) is important in this development here. They were influenced by the important work of Nicolas Rashevsky in the 1930s. Hebb contributed greatly to speculations about neural functioning, and proposed a learning principle, Hebbian learning, that is still used today. Lashley argued for distributed representations as a result of his failure to find anything like a localized engram in years of lesion experiments.\n\nThough PDP is the dominant form of connectionism, other theoretical work should also be classified as connectionist.\n\nMany connectionist principles can be traced to early work in psychology, such as that of William James. Psychological theories based on knowledge about the human brain were fashionable in the late 19th century. As early as 1869, the neurologist John Hughlings Jackson argued for multi-level, distributed systems. Following from this lead, Herbert Spencer's \"Principles of Psychology\", 3rd edition (1872), and Sigmund Freud's \"Project for a Scientific Psychology\" (composed 1895) propounded connectionist or proto-connectionist theories. These tended to be speculative theories. But by the early 20th century, Edward Thorndike was experimenting on learning that posited a connectionist type network.\n\nIn the 1950s, Friedrich Hayek proposed that spontaneous order in the brain arose out of decentralized networks of simple units. Hayek's work was rarely cited in the PDP literature until recently.\n\nAnother form of connectionist model was the relational network framework developed by the linguist Sydney Lamb in the 1960s. Relational networks have been only used by linguists, and were never unified with the PDP approach. As a result, they are now used by very few researchers.\n\nThere are also hybrid connectionist models, mostly mixing symbolic representations with neural network models.\nThe hybrid approach has been advocated by some researchers (such as Ron Sun).\n\nAs connectionism became increasingly popular in the late 1980s, some researchers (including Jerry Fodor, Steven Pinker and others) reacted against it. They argued that connectionism, as then developing, threatened to obliterate what they saw as the progress being made in the fields of cognitive science and psychology by the classical approach of computationalism. Computationalism is a specific form of cognitivism that argues that mental activity is computational, that is, that the mind operates by performing purely formal operations on symbols, like a Turing machine. Some researchers argued that the trend in connectionism represented a reversion toward associationism and the abandonment of the idea of a language of thought, something they saw as mistaken. In contrast, those very tendencies made connectionism attractive for other researchers.\n\nConnectionism and computationalism need not be at odds, but the debate in the late 1980s and early 1990s led to opposition between the two approaches. Throughout the debate, some researchers have argued that connectionism and computationalism are fully compatible, though full consensus on this issue has not been reached. Differences between the two approaches include the following:\n\n\nDespite these differences, some theorists have proposed that the connectionist architecture is simply the manner in which organic brains happen to implement the symbol-manipulation system. This is logically possible, as it is well known that connectionist models can implement symbol-manipulation systems of the kind used in computationalist models, as indeed they must be able if they are to explain the human ability to perform symbol-manipulation tasks. But the debate rests on whether this symbol manipulation forms the foundation of cognition in general, so this is not a potential vindication of computationalism. Nonetheless, computational descriptions may be helpful high-level descriptions of cognition of logic, for example.\n\nThe debate largely centred on logical arguments about whether connectionist networks could produce the syntactic structure observed in this sort of reasoning. This was later achieved, although using processes unlikely to be possible in the brain, thus the debate persisted. , progress in neurophysiology and general advances in the understanding of neural networks have led to the successful modelling of a great many of these early problems, and the debate about fundamental cognition has, thus, largely been decided among neuroscientists in favour of connectionism. However, these fairly recent developments have yet to reach consensus acceptance among those working in other fields, such as psychology or philosophy of mind.\n\nPart of the appeal of computational descriptions is that they are relatively easy to interpret, and thus may be seen as contributing to our understanding of particular mental processes, whereas connectionist models are in general more opaque, to the extent that they may be describable only in very general terms (such as specifying the learning algorithm, the number of units, etc.), or in unhelpfully low-level terms. In this sense connectionist models may instantiate, and thereby provide evidence for, a broad theory of cognition (i.e., connectionism), without representing a helpful theory of the particular process that is being modelled. In this sense the debate might be considered as to some extent reflecting a mere difference in the level of analysis in which particular theories are framed.\n\nThe recent popularity of dynamical systems in philosophy of mind have added a new perspective on the debate; some authors now argue that any split between connectionism and computationalism is more conclusively characterized as a split between computationalism and dynamical systems.\n\nIn 2014, Alex Graves and others from DeepMind published a series of papers describing a novel Deep Neural Network structure called the Neural Turing Machine able to read symbols on a tape and store symbols in memory. Relational Networks, another Deep Network module published by DeepMind are able to create object-like representations and manipulate them to answer complex questions. Relational Networks and Neural Turing Machines are further evidence that connectionism and computationalism need not be at odds.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "14421821", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14421821", "title": "Crysis 3", "text": "Crysis 3\n\nCrysis 3 is a first-person shooter video game developed by Crytek and published by Electronic Arts for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360. It is the third main installment of the \"Crysis\" series, a sequel to the 2011 video game \"Crysis 2\". The multiplayer portion of the game was developed by Crytek UK. \"Crysis 3\"s story revolves around Prophet, a Nanosuit holder who is on a quest to take revenge on the Alpha Ceph, the leader of the Ceph alien race. The game's story serves as the end of the \"Crysis\" trilogy. Gameplay revolves around the use of the Nanosuit, which grants players a variety of abilities such as being invisible. New features introduced in \"Crysis 3\" include a new Nanosuit ability called \"Rip & Throw\", a compound bow and the \"hacking\" feature, which allows players to hack into enemies' equipment, drones, and security defenses.\n\nThe game is set in a post-apocalyptic New York City, in an effort to combine the urban landscape of \"Crysis 2\" and the forest setting of the original \"Crysis\". The game introduces the \"Seven Wonders\", with each wonder having its own unique landscape and tactical layout. Due to complaints about \"Crysis 2\"s linearity, the game's levels were opened up so as to grant players more freedom. The development team also put efforts into creating a more emotional story, and the story's protagonist was inspired by the lead character of \"District 9\". The game was developed by a team of 100 people during its 23-month development cycle. Crytek UK developed the game's multiplayer portion.\n\nOfficially announced in April 2012, \"Crysis 3\" received positive reviews upon release. Praise was directed at the weapon selection and customization, menus, visuals and multiplayer, while it was criticized for its story, level design, length, and outdated mechanics in comparison to its predecessors. With a budget of $66 million, the game sold 205,000 copies in its debut month, and became a commercial failure for Electronic Arts. The game was later included in \"The Crysis Trilogy\", a bundle released in February 2014.\n\nSimilar to the earlier games in the \"Crysis\" series, \"Crysis 3\" is a first-person shooter. Players take control of Prophet as he progresses through New York City to defeat the Ceph, a technologically advanced alien race. Throughout the game, players can slide, sprint, jump and crouch. When encountering enemies, players can defeat them by using guns or a compound bow, utilizing explosives like grenades and C4, or by performing a melee attack. Performing certain movements takes up energy from the Nanosuit, the armor worn by Prophet. Some abilities are not available for players to perform or utilize if the Nanosuit's energy is too low; they must wait until energy is refilled. As a result, players are tasked to manage the use of the energy. The game's artificial intelligence was updated allowing enemies to react more quickly to players' attacks. Enemies can take cover when attacked, and can employ strategy to assist and support each other against attacks.\n\nThe Nanosuit allows players to identify the threat level, and the weapons held by enemies. Players can tag enemies and items by enabling visor, and can spot enemies using Nano-Vision, which detects the heat of both enemies and allies. Levels are more open-ended than in \"Crysis 2\". Players are given more freedom, and can choose a gameplay style based on direct confrontation, or a more discreet and stealthy approach, in order to deal with enemies and to complete their objectives. There is no definite way to beat the game's seven levels. Instead, players can take different alternate routes to reach their objectives. \n\nPlayers can fight against enemies utilizing a wide array of gadgets and weapons, and by using the abilities granted by the Nanosuit. They can utilize an invisibility cloak to evade enemies, prevent themselves from being detected, or to perform silent takedowns. The nanosuit also has an armor mode, which reduces the amount of damage taken, in exchange for slower movement speed. New weapons are introduced in \"Crysis 3\", such as a compound bow. Players can use the bow while in cloak mode. When using other firearms, the cloak is disrupted and can no longer function until it cools down. Arrows can be collected by players after use. Players can hack into enemies' technology, one of the game's new features. In addition, players can hack security codes, weapon boxes, Ceph technology, mines, lasers, and sentry turrets, which can all be used to fight against enemies.\nPlayers can also upgrade and customize their weapons and the Nanosuit. They can change the attachment and ammo types for their weapons. For instance, players can change between explosive arrows and electric arrows for their bow. The Nanosuit can be upgraded by collecting different suit upgrade modules scattered across the world. These upgrades can increase the suit's properties, and strengthen or unlock new abilities for players as they progress through the game.\n\nGameplay remains similar when playing the multiplayer mode. Unlike the single-player campaign, when players sprint or boost their armor in the multiplayer modes, it does not use any nanosuit energy. There are 8 different modes, with a total of 12 available maps to play on. They are Team Deathmatch, Deathmatch, Crash Site / Spears, Capture the Relay / Extraction, Hunter, Assault, Cell Vs Rebel, Developers Choice, Maximum Team Deathmatch, and Maximum Deathmatch. Scattered throughout each map are special alien weapons with scarce ammo and can be picked up by players. Players also have a new passive ability called Rip and Throw, in which they interact with environmental objects to create obstacles for hostile players and tactical advantages for themselves.This interactibility with the environment was pushed heavily upon the team by their publisher, EA. A refined kill streak system is introduced in \"Crysis 3\", allowing players to gain rewards by killing hostile players simultaneously while collecting their dog tag. This refined kill system involves collecting dog tags that are dropped by enemy players when killed. The perks gained from this vary from map to map. They are Maximum Radar, Swarmer, Gamma Burst, EMP, and Maximum Nanosuit, which reveals enemy players locations on the mini-map. \n\nIn addition to traditional multiplayer modes, a new multiplayer mode, the Hunter mode, is featured in the game. It is an asymmetrical multiplayer mode which pits two teams of players, playing as either hunters, or troopers from CELL, against each other. The three CELL classes are equipped with completely different weapons, and defeated troopers respawn as hunters and have to defeat their former teammates. Hunters are equipped with the nanosuit and infinite cloak, as well as the Hunter Bow, which allows the hunter to fire while they're cloaked. The hunters also have access to a Thermite Arrow tip, and the CELL have various explosives and weapons that change depending on class selected. The PC version of the game can accommodate up to 16 players, while the console versions can only support 12 players.\n\nPlayers take on the role of Prophet as he returns to New York in 2047, 24 years after the events of \"Crysis 2\". He discovers the city has been encased in a giant Nanodome created by the corrupt CELL corporation. The New York City Liberty Dome is a veritable urban rainforest teeming with overgrown trees, dense swamplands, and raging rivers. Within the Liberty Dome, seven distinct and treacherous environments are known as the Seven Wonders. Prophet is said to be on a \"revenge mission\" after uncovering the truth behind CELL's motives for building the quarantined Nanodome.\n\nAfter the events of \"Crysis 2\", Psycho and Prophet travel the world looking for the Alpha Ceph, the ultimate Ceph leader. Prophet and Psycho finally trace the Alpha Ceph in Russia and imprison it. However, shortly afterwards CELL Corporation, now attempting global domination of land and technology, disables Prophet in Siberia and captures all the Nanosuit soldiers, skinning them of their suits to recover the Ceph genetics stored in them. CELL transfers Prophet to a facility to skin him. Locked in a storage device, Prophet is transported by CELL to New York, encased within a giant \"Nanodome\". He is saved by a resistance force, led by Claire Fontanelli and Jacob Hargreave's colleague, Karl Ernst Rasch, as Prophet is the only Nanosuit holder left who can stop CELL. Psycho, who was saved by Claire after being skinned, explains to Prophet that during his absence, CELL used Ceph technology to generate unlimited energy, and gained a monopoly over the world's power supply. Those who could not pay for energy were enslaved by debt to CELL. The source of CELL's power generation for the entire world, called System X, is located in now abandoned New York. The resistance group wants System X destroyed to free the world from CELL.\n\nAfter Psycho and Prophet disable System X's core, it turns out that it is a system protocol designed to contain the Alpha Ceph while draining energy off of the alien. However, the secondary defense protocol was initiated, causing the power facility to self-destruct. The Alpha Ceph, free from containment, opens a wormhole to the Ceph homeworld. They plan to send an even larger force to invade Earth through the wormhole and terraform it at the expense of all local life's extinction. With the Alpha Ceph no longer dormant, the Ceph coordinator reactivates, and a coordinated Ceph attack ensues. Prophet decides to kill the Alpha Ceph and end the alien threat.\n\nAfter unlocking his potential ability by removing some neural blocks in his suit, Prophet learns that CELL plans to use Archangel, a satellite-based energy distribution device that can draw power from the world's power grid, as a directed energy weapon to destroy the Alpha Ceph. Firing it would cause a chain reaction that would destroy Earth. They shut off the weapon before it has enough energy to fire. Along the way, Psycho discovers Claire was one of the scientists who reluctantly skinned him, causing friction in his previously romantic relationship with her. Unfortunately, Karl, who had secretly used Ceph technology to extend his lifespan, is possessed by the Ceph and critically wounds Claire while psychically crippling Prophet. Regaining control after Psycho shot him, he sacrifices himself to distract the Alpha Ceph. Prophet, Psycho, and Claire board the VTOL and engage in a massive air battle with Ceph ships, eventually crashing. Claire dies in the process. Psycho, saddened by her death, laments to Prophet that he is powerless because he no longer possesses a Nanosuit. Upon being told that his lack of a Nanosuit saved him from Karl's control earlier, Psycho, now going by his real name, Michael, finds another VTOL to take Prophet to the Ceph.\n\nMichael and Prophet head towards the Alpha Ceph, but are bogged down by the Ceph Master Mind. Prophet finds his way through the Ceph Army hordes and kills the Alpha Ceph which in turn kills all other Ceph troopers in the area. However, they do not have enough time to destroy the Ceph wormhole structure and the beam powering the wormhole pulls Prophet into space. Now in orbit around Earth, Prophet sees a massive Ceph warship coming through the wormhole. Initially, he has all but given up and begins shutting down. Recalling Archangel's power, Prophet wakes up and hacks into the satellite, and uses it to destroy the warship. The explosion collapses the wormhole and Prophet is pushed back to Earth. He crashlands in the water near the Lingshan Islands where the events of \"Crysis\" took place 27 years earlier.\n\nWhen Prophet wakes the next morning, he is in an abandoned hut in Lingshan, the same area Nomad initially encountered during the events of \"Crysis\". A television playing in the background informs him that CELL's assets were frozen by Senator Strickland as the corporation is under investigation. As the neural blocks are removed from the Nanosuit, the suit's outer layer is changed to reform Prophet's former physical body, resurrecting him. He walks out onto the beach and relinquishes his past by throwing his tags into the water. He then decides to use his actual name \"Laurence Barnes\" from then on. The game ends with Prophet walking back to the shed and activating his stealth ability.\n\nThen a cutscene is played; beginning with a first-person view of a soldier on the chase, then changing to a free view of a total of 2 CELL soldiers rushing 3 \"board members\" inside of what seems like a bunker, added with a few seconds of a view from a night vision device. After entering \"safehouse 4,\" the two soldiers are shot by the soldier, revealed to be Michael, who later claimed that he would like to make a complaint to the \"board members\" regarding his treatment at one of their \"hospitals.\"\n\n\"Crysis 3\"s development began in February 2011, two months before the release of \"Crysis 2\". The development of the game's campaign was handled by Crytek; its multiplayer was handled by Crytek UK. Its development budget was significantly smaller than that of \"Crysis 2\", as resources and manpower were relocated to develop \"Homefront 2\" and \"\". As a result, only about 100 people worked on the game during its 23 months development. The game's budget was about $66 million.\n\n\"Crysis 2\" was criticised for abandoning the island setting of the original \"Crysis\". The studio decided to recreate New York City and set the game in a post-apocalyptic environment. To do this, the company introduced a concept called \"Nanodome\", a dome set up by CELL to isolate New York City, which had fallen to ruins over the years. Plants have grown significantly, leading to an environment that is a mix between an urban environment and the jungle setting of the past two games. The decision was made to create this environment as the team wanted to stay away from typical urban war field shown in other games of the same genre. Instead of having a rainforest in the abandoned wasteland, the Nanodome is used to fix the shape of the forest, and Crytek hoped that it would define the atmosphere and the narrative of the game.\n\nThe game's main protagonist is Prophet, a nanosuit holder who had previously appeared in \"Crysis\" and \"Crysis 2\". He returns in \"Crysis 3\" as Crytek considered him as the most complex character who has the longest heritage in the series. When designing him, the team took inspiration from the protagonist of \"District 9\". Psycho from the original \"Crysis\" and \"Crysis Warhead\" returns as Prophet's companion. The game revolves around Prophet attempting to redeem himself by taking revenge after finding his former squad members are dead. The story explores the themes of redemption and revenge as well as the relationship between humans and technology. Mike Read, the game's producer, summed up the game calling it \"human\". Unlike \"Crysis 2\"s protagonist Alcatraz who does not speak throughout the game, Prophet is voiced in \"Crysis 3\" in an effort to deliver more emotional connection. The company made use of performance capture to record actor's performance, body movements and facial expressions. According to Read, this helps the company to create a more affecting and emotional story. This was not done in the previous games due to technological limitations.\n\nUnlike the original \"Crysis\", which gives players more freedom to explore, \"Crysis 2\" was criticized for being too linear. As a result, in developing the game's campaign, Crytek attempted to integrate the two major aspects of the previous installments, the freedom given in the original \"Crysis\" and the linearity of \"Crysis 2\". Despite not being as open as the first half of \"Crysis\", maps are significantly larger in this game than in previous installments. Several linear segments were preserved. Crytek referred to the game's map as \"action bubbles\", which do not necessarily fix players in a small place but allows them to move around freely. Linearity was preserved as developers considered having such segments present could help players to experience \"epic\" moments and \"massive Michael Bay\" moments. Crytek hoped that by opening up levels they could give players a sense of control, allowing them to plan and execute strategy. The game's seven levels were developed simultaneously, and the focus phrases of gameplay, art and optimization of a level was about one to two weeks.\n\nAnother theme featured in the game is \"hunt\" and, as a result, many weapons were built around the concept. The studio wanted to stay away from typical weapon design and did not want a weapon to simply differentiate between \"Crysis 3\" and \"Crysis 2\". The team aimed to use weapons to create narrative. The game features a compound bow which is reminiscent of a weapon that a hunter often uses. The game's gameplay is built based on three pillars, access, adapt, and attack. Players are often tasked to do detect, spot, and to learn their enemies' behaviors and patterns before attacking. With the bow, players are encouraged to play the game stealthily, extending the game's combat. A new feature called \"hacking\" was developed. According to Crytek, hacking plays a huge role throughout the game. The game's combat was also made more fast-paced than that of its predecessors.\n\nOne of the major goals in developing \"Crysis 3\" was to \"push graphics\", as the company considered that they can effectively assist and drive gameplay and create immersion for the player. The game is powered by CryEngine 3, Crytek's proprietary engine. It utilizes some of the newest features of CryEngine 3, such as volumetric fog shadows, improved dynamic vegetation, dynamic caustics, improved area lighting and diffuse shadows. After \"Crysis 2\" received some criticism from PC gamers because of the design sacrifices made due to the limitations of the older console hardware, Crytek responded that the PC version of \"Crysis 3\" will figuratively \"melt down PCs\" due to its high system requirements. The PC version of the game required a DirectX 11 compatible video card and operating system. Similar to \"Crysis 2\", the game is a multi-platform title, and Crytek considered the development of the game's console version a huge obstacle they had to \"rip the engine to pieces\" so as to get the game running on console.\n\nThe multiplayer portion of the game was created by Crytek UK. It was designed to improve the efficiency of the Nanosuit in an online environment. In an effort to create memorable maps, the team designed routes that can only be discovered after a player's first playthrough. Crytek UK hoped that this approach would help players to become more immersed in the game's universe. The Hunter mode, introduced in this game, originated from a \"TimeSplitters\"'s Gladiator mode. The decision to make sprint energy separated from the nanosuit energy was due to the development team's desire to create larger levels, and help players to navigate the map in a faster way.\n\nThe game's music was composed by Borislav Slavov, who had previously led the soundtrack development of \"Crysis 2\". New music was composed for the game, while some other themes from the past installments were rearranged. The theme of the game's music is changed so as to fit the game's post-apocalyptic setting. The game's music is dynamic and is designed to reflect players' gameplay style. As a result, when players use a radical approach to complete missions, more exciting background music will be played. In contrast, when players are playing stealthily, the background music will be relatively calmer and quieter.\n\nIn November 2010, Nathan Camarillo, an executive producer from Crytek, revealed that the \"Crysis\" series could potentially be a very long-running franchise, as the company considered the series' universe easy for players to get into and become invested in. He added: \"As the franchise grows down the line, there's no reason it can't be as big [as \"Call of Duty\"]\". The story elements of the game had already been planned in January 2011. Despite that, Cevat Yerli, Crytek's CEO, claimed that if \"Crysis 2\" was not a successful title, Crytek would not develop its sequel. In March 2012, Crytek teased an \"absolutely fantastic\" project and announced that a full reveal of the game would be held in April 2012. The game was accidentally revealed by EA on its web store on 11 April 2012. It was removed immediately from the store but the title was later officially announced on 16 April 2012. Filmmaker Albert Hughes was commissioned to produce \"The 7 Wonders of Crysis 3\", a series of six short stylized videos, each of which features a different aspect of the game.\n\nA PC-only closed alpha version of the multiplayer was released to selected Origin users on 31 October 2012. The test began on 2 November and ended on 9 November 2012. A public multiplayer beta containing two maps (\"Museum\" and \"Airport\") and two game modes (\"Crash Site\" and \"Hunter\") was available for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 console platforms, as well as for the PC through Origin. The beta was made available on 29 January 2013 and ended on 12 February 2013. Crytek and EA announced that 3 million people participated in the beta.\n\n\"Crysis 3\" was released worldwide on 19 February 2013 in the US and 21 February 2013 in the UK for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360. The Wii U version was cancelled after relations between Nintendo and EA became troubled. The \"Hunter Edition\", which features exclusive in-game items, and early access to the compound bow in the multiplayer portion of the game, was released alongside the game. Players who had pre-ordered the game could also get the original \"Crysis\" for free. On 4 March 2015, the game was made available for Android via Nvidia Shield. \"The Crysis Trilogy\" bundle was released on 20 February 2014 consisting of the original, the Deluxe Edition of \"Crysis\", along with other games in the series.\n\nOn 30 May 2013, Electronic Arts announced \"The Lost Island\" downloadable content (DLC). The multiplayer-only DLC includes two weapons, four maps, and two competitive multiplayer modes called \"Frenzy\" and \"Possession\". The downloadable content was released worldwide on 4 July 2013 for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360.\n\n\"Crysis 3\" has received generally positive reviews from critics. Aggregating review websites Metacritic rated the Xbox 360 version 76/100, the PlayStation 3 version 77/100 and the PC version 76/100.\n\nThe visuals and graphics of the game were widely praised by reviewers. Christian Donlan of Eurogamer praised the game's stable frame rate. Furthermore, he considered the game's environmental design \"artful\". Matthew Rorie of GameSpy thought that the game was visually stunning. He applauded the team at Crytek for creating an environment that is \"both inhospitable and queerly beautiful\". Matt Bertz of \"Game Informer\" praised the visuals powered by CryEngine, and considered the game one of the best-looking games ever created. He especially praised its realistic environments, water effects, and character facial animation. Kevin VanOrd of GameSpot also praised the mix of the decayed urban environment and the rainforest, saying that it made the game striking to look at.\n\nThe game's design was praised by various reviewers. Donlan considered the game's support of stealth a welcoming addition, despite calling the game's last level a forgettable experience. Rorie praised the game's map design; he opined that the opened-up levels encourage exploration. Bertz considered the game's world had successfully captured a balance between the settings of its predecessors, and that the larger levels allowed players to deploy strategy before performing attacks. He added that some of the best missions were featured in the later stages of the game. Tristan Ogilvie of IGN thought that the control was almost perfect, despite criticizing the clumsy control of several segments which require players to control vehicles. VanOrd criticized the game for being too easy for players to play.\n\nThe game's online multiplayer received positive reviews from critics. Josh Harmon of \"Electronic Gaming Monthly\" thought that the game's multiplayer was better than the campaign, and that it made the overall experience more enjoyable. Donlan praised the Hunter mode; he believed that it had delivered a tense experience. Bertz echoed similar thoughts, but felt that the mode's appeal was not as good as typical modes like Domination. As well, he criticized the multiplayer's respawn system and terrain-design. Lorenzo Veloria of GamesRadar thought that some of the game modes were unique and entertaining, despite noting some technical issues. Michael Rougeau of \"Complex\" criticized the Hunter mode, calling it \"unbalanced\". He furthered criticized the game for lacking a co-operative multiplayer mode. David Hinkle of \"Joystiq\" also noted some design errors in the Hunter mode.\n\nThe story was disliked by critics compared to the game's other aspects. Harmon thought that several emotional segments of the game failed to deliver, as well as criticizing the forgettable storyline and plot twists. Despite that, he praised the game's finale and considered that it brought a proper closure to the \"Crysis\" trilogy. In contrast, Donlan commented that it was not quite the conclusion the series deserved. Rorie thought that the story was more mature than its predecessors, despite having a relatively weak start and short length of about six hours. Bertz opined that the story was the most cohesive of the titles in the series. Veloria, however, criticized the game's narrative; he added that it was uninspiring due to the lack of character development and interesting dialogue. In contrast, Ogilvie thought that the game's dialogue and voice-acting were excellent, citing the game's relateable characters that its predecessors failed to achieve. He considered the game's storytelling a massive improvement for the series.\n\nMany reviewers considered \"Crysis 3\" was an evolution of the series instead of a groundbreaking revolution. Rorie criticized the game for being unambitious, and that despite the game's overall refinements, it had not strayed far enough from its predecessors. He concluded that \"Crysis 3\" did not achieve the revolution brought by the original \"Crysis\". Veloria thought that the title failed to bring any new element to the genre, but the overall experience delivered by the game was still satisfying. Evan Lahti of \"PC Gamer\" commented that the game did not surprise players, and that the title presented a feeling of \"Crysis 2: Episode 2\" instead of a proper sequel.\n\nDuring its debut release week and the next, \"Crysis 3\" was the best-selling retail game in the UK closely followed by \"\". It sold 205,000 copies in 12 days in North America during its debut month. The title, along with \"Dead Space 3\", another EA title that was released in the same month, failed to meet the company's sales expectations. Cevat Yerli, Crytek's CEO, was also disappointed by the sales of \"Crysis 3\". Nevertheless, he considered \"Crysis 3\" the best game the studio had produced so far.\n\nWith \"Crysis 3\" being the end of the \"Crysis\" trilogy, Crytek teased that the series would have a \"radical future\". Yerli confirmed that the next installment would not be called \"Crysis 4\", as he considered such a title \"misleading\". On 12 June 2012, it was revealed that Crytek would focus only on free-to-play titles following the release of \"Crysis 3\".\n"}

The Church itself condoned the use of bells to frighten away evil spirits and this ensured the practice's survival and development. Bells were often baptised, and once baptised were believed by many to possess the power to ward off evil spells and spirits. The use of the dead bell was typical of this belief, rung for the recently deceased to keep evil spirits away from the body.\n\nThe dead bell was therefore originally rung for two reasons: firstly to seek the prayers of Christians for a dead person's soul, and secondly to drive away the evil spirits who stood at the foot of the dead person's bed and around the house.\n\nThe use of the dead bell is illustrated on the Bayeux tapestry at the funeral of Edward the Confessor and may have been brought over to Britain by the Normans.\n\nBefore the Reformation, friars in Glasgow rang the dead bell through the streets for the repose of the soul of the deceased, especially if the individual was a benefactor of the church. It is known that the ancient bell of Saint Mungo (aka Saint Kentigern) was used for this purpose. From 1454 a record survives of the bell being rung annually for the soul of Johne Steuart (John Stewart), the first Provost of Glasgow, who had left lands and property to the church. A record of 1509 for Sir Archibald Crawford of Cadder also shows that the ringing of the dead bell sometimes took place more than once and was intended to encourage others to pray for the deceased, his ancestors, and other Christian souls. In 1594 the presbytery of Glasgow attempted to recover the right of use of the dead bell, arguing that it was an ecclesiastical and not a secular function.\n\nThe Ballad of Willie's Lyke-Wake from the north of Scotland records the payment of a groat for the ringing of the dead bell at his funeral by the bedral or bell-man.\n\nIn later, secular times, the bell ringer would pass through the streets of villages, towns or cities announcing the name of a recently deceased person, with details of the funeral. At the funeral the bell ringer, often the beadle, would walk at the head the cortege, solemnly ringing the bell from the home of the deceased until the church was reached. The bell was also sometimes used to indicate the point at which the coffin-bearers were changed.\n\nThe dead bell ringer was instructed to go through the town no more than twice and was not permitted to use the words \"faithful\" or \"God\". He was not permitted to ring the bell before sunrise or after sunset.\n\nKirk session records show that in one Ayrshire parish the dead bell ringer was paid at a rate of a penny a mile at first, rising to two pence per mile by 1762. The income from the ringing of the dead bell went to the kirk session and was used to support the poor.\n\nThe ballad of \"Barbara Allan\" reads:-\nRecords show that the use of the dead bell was common in Eastern Scotland during the seventeenth and eighteenth century and for many years before. In pre-reformation times the dead bell was also used to summon the priest to administer the last rites.\n\nIn the eighteenth century, the church beadle went around the parish farms, Kirton, and hamlets at the time of the death and later when the funeral arrangements had been settled.\n\nAt poor people's funerals the dead bell was hung on a tree and rung throughout the service.\n\nThe dead bell was held in high regard and one bell ringer was reportedly sacked for an indecent use of the dead bell.\n\nIn the Inns of Court, as well as the usual use, a passing bell was rung on the appointment of a member as a Serjeant-at-Law, who was said to have \"died to the Inn\" as he left his Inn of Court and joined Serjeant's Inn, until appointments of Serjeants ceased in the 19th century.\n\nThe Loudoun Kirk dead bell still survived in 1894, having originally been sent to the parishioners from Holland by James Campbell, 2nd Earl of Loudoun who died in 1684. It had \"Loudoun Kirk\" cast in raised lettering and was used at funeral processions; it was held by Mrs. Semple at Loudoun Village in 1875. Loudoun parish church at Newmilns has a deid bell inscribed \"Countess of Loudoun\". The Kilmarnock example had the town's name and the date \"1639\" and was preserved in the town hall. The Galston example had the name and the date \"1722\". The Maybole dead bell had no markings and after being exhibited at the 1911 Glasgow Exhibition it remained in the Kelvingove Museum's collections. A Hawick dead bell is recorded.\n\nAn example of 1641 from Glasgow was made to replace the ancient Saint Mungo's. This bell had the Chapter of Glasgow's seal on it, a tree and a salmon, together with a representation of an ancient square-shaped bell; like that of Saint Mungo, which still existed at that date. Saint Mungo's bell was rescued by a Glasgow magistrate, James Laing, after the reformation and the Glasgow officials purchased it for the substantial sum of £10 Scots in 1577. In 1640 the council had a new dead bell made, Saint Mungo's bell probably having become too worn. This was then used for many years and then lost; however, in 1867 it was recovered and returned to the Glasgow corporation. The present whereabouts of Saint Mungo's bell is unknown.\n\nThe Kilmarnock funeral bell carries the inscription \"Kilmarnock, 1639\" and is made of bell metal, 8 inches high and 7 inches wide at the mouth. Its use was remembered by local inhabitants still alive in the 1850s. In 1873 the Dunblane dead bell was kept in Dunblane Cathedral. Partick's dead bell was similar to Glasgow's and was dated 1726 and after many travels it was given to the Partick Curling Club. Hexham, Carlisle and Penrith are recorded to have used dead bells as late at the 1870's in the case of Penrith.\n\nIn Northern England and Scotland dead bells are not uncommon as symbols of death on funerary monuments. As an emblem of mortality the dead bell was mainly confined to eighteenth-century tombstones in the North-East of Scotland, especially in Morayshire and Aberdeenshire. In Angus and Perthshire its use is rare and further south it only occurs on seventeenth-century stones. The handbell is more common than the church bell and rope, the wooden handle on former being clearly depicted.\n\nJames Hogg, the Ettrick Shepherd, wrote that the dead bell was the 'tinkling in the ears' which the country people regard as the secret intelligence of some friend's decease.\n\n"}
{"id": "32472154", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=32472154", "title": "Deep learning", "text": "Deep learning\n\nDeep learning (also known as deep structured learning or hierarchical learning) is part of a broader family of machine learning methods based on learning data representations, as opposed to task-specific algorithms. Learning can be supervised, semi-supervised or unsupervised.\n\nDeep learning architectures such as deep neural networks, deep belief networks and recurrent neural networks have been applied to fields including computer vision, speech recognition, natural language processing, audio recognition, social network filtering, machine translation, bioinformatics, drug design, medical image analysis, material inspection and board game programs, where they have produced results comparable to and in some cases superior to human experts.\n\nDeep learning models are vaguely inspired by information processing and communication patterns in biological nervous systems yet have various differences from the structural and functional properties of biological brains (especially human brains), which make them incompatible with neuroscience evidences.\n\nDeep learning is a class of machine learning algorithms that:\n\nMost modern deep learning models are based on an artificial neural network, although they can also include propositional formulas or latent variables organized layer-wise in deep generative models such as the nodes in deep belief networks and deep Boltzmann machines.\n\nIn deep learning, each level learns to transform its input data into a slightly more abstract and composite representation. In an image recognition application, the raw input may be a matrix of pixels; the first representational layer may abstract the pixels and encode edges; the second layer may compose and encode arrangements of edges; the third layer may encode a nose and eyes; and the fourth layer may recognize that the image contains a face. Importantly, a deep learning process can learn which features to optimally place in which level \"on its own\". (Of course, this does not completely obviate the need for hand-tuning; for example, varying numbers of layers and layer sizes can provide different degrees of abstraction.)\n\nThe \"deep\" in \"deep learning\" refers to the number of layers through which the data is transformed. More precisely, deep learning systems have a substantial \"credit assignment path\" (CAP) depth. The CAP is the chain of transformations from input to output. CAPs describe potentially causal connections between input and output. For a feedforward neural network, the depth of the CAPs is that of the network and is the number of hidden layers plus one (as the output layer is also parameterized). For recurrent neural networks, in which a signal may propagate through a layer more than once, the CAP depth is potentially unlimited. No universally agreed upon threshold of depth divides shallow learning from deep learning, but most researchers agree that deep learning involves CAP depth > 2. CAP of depth 2 has been shown to be a universal approximator in the sense that it can emulate any function. Beyond that more layers do not add to the function approximator ability of the network. Deep models (CAP > 2) are able to extract better features than shallow models and hence, extra layers help in learning features.\n\nDeep learning architectures are often constructed with a greedy layer-by-layer method. Deep learning helps to disentangle these abstractions and pick out which features improve performance.\n\nFor supervised learning tasks, deep learning methods obviate feature engineering, by translating the data into compact intermediate representations akin to principal components, and derive layered structures that remove redundancy in representation.\n\nDeep learning algorithms can be applied to unsupervised learning tasks. This is an important benefit because unlabeled data are more abundant than labeled data. Examples of deep structures that can be trained in an unsupervised manner are neural history compressors and deep belief networks.\n\nDeep neural networks are generally interpreted in terms of the universal approximation theorem or probabilistic inference.\n\nThe universal approximation theorem concerns the capacity of feedforward neural networks with a single hidden layer of finite size to approximate continuous functions. In 1989, the first proof was published by George Cybenko for sigmoid activation functions and was generalised to feed-forward multi-layer architectures in 1991 by Kurt Hornik.\n\nThe probabilistic interpretation derives from the field of machine learning. It features inference, as well as the optimization concepts of training and testing, related to fitting and generalization, respectively. More specifically, the probabilistic interpretation considers the activation nonlinearity as a cumulative distribution function. The probabilistic interpretation led to the introduction of dropout as regularizer in neural networks. The probabilistic interpretation was introduced by researchers including Hopfield, Widrow and Narendra and popularized in surveys such as the one by Bishop.\n\nThe term \"Deep Learning\" was introduced to the machine learning community by Rina Dechter in 1986, and to artificial neural networks by Igor Aizenberg and colleagues in 2000, in the context of Boolean threshold neurons.\n\nThe first general, working learning algorithm for supervised, deep, feedforward, multilayer perceptrons was published by Alexey Ivakhnenko and Lapa in 1965. A 1971 paper described a deep network with 8 layers trained by the group method of data handling algorithm.\n\nOther deep learning working architectures, specifically those built for computer vision, began with the Neocognitron introduced by Kunihiko Fukushima in 1980. In 1989, Yann LeCun et al. applied the standard backpropagation algorithm, which had been around as the reverse mode of automatic differentiation since 1970, to a deep neural network with the purpose of recognizing handwritten ZIP codes on mail. While the algorithm worked, training required 3 days.\n\nBy 1991 such systems were used for recognizing isolated 2-D hand-written digits, while recognizing 3-D objects was done by matching 2-D images with a handcrafted 3-D object model. Weng \"et al.\" suggested that a human brain does not use a monolithic 3-D object model and in 1992 they published Cresceptron, a method for performing 3-D object recognition in cluttered scenes. Because it directly used natural images, Cresceptron started the beginning of general-purpose visual learning for natural 3D worlds. Cresceptron is a cascade of layers similar to Neocognitron. But while Neocognitron required a human programmer to hand-merge features, Cresceptron learned an open number of features in each layer without supervision, where each feature is represented by a convolution kernel. Cresceptron segmented each learned object from a cluttered scene through back-analysis through the network. Max pooling, now often adopted by deep neural networks (e.g. ImageNet tests), was first used in Cresceptron to reduce the position resolution by a factor of (2x2) to 1 through the cascade for better generalization.\n\nIn 1994, André de Carvalho, together with Mike Fairhurst and David Bisset, published experimental results of a multi-layer boolean neural network, also known as a weightless neural network, composed of a 3-layers self-organising feature extraction neural network module (SOFT) followed by a multi-layer classification neural network module (GSN), which were independently trained. Each layer in the feature extraction module extracted features with growing complexity regarding the previous layer.\n\nIn 1995, Brendan Frey demonstrated that it was possible to train (over two days) a network containing six fully connected layers and several hundred hidden units using the wake-sleep algorithm, co-developed with Peter Dayan and Hinton. Many factors contribute to the slow speed, including the vanishing gradient problem analyzed in 1991 by Sepp Hochreiter.\n\nSimpler models that use task-specific handcrafted features such as Gabor filters and support vector machines (SVMs) were a popular choice in the 1990s and 2000s, because of ANNs' computational cost and a lack of understanding of how the brain wires its biological networks.\n\nBoth shallow and deep learning (e.g., recurrent nets) of ANNs have been explored for many years. These methods never outperformed non-uniform internal-handcrafting Gaussian mixture model/Hidden Markov model (GMM-HMM) technology based on generative models of speech trained discriminatively. Key difficulties have been analyzed, including gradient diminishing and weak temporal correlation structure in neural predictive models. Additional difficulties were the lack of training data and limited computing power.\n\nMost speech recognition researchers moved away from neural nets to pursue generative modeling. An exception was at SRI International in the late 1990s. Funded by the US government's NSA and DARPA, SRI studied deep neural networks in speech and speaker recognition. Heck's speaker recognition team achieved the first significant success with deep neural networks in speech processing in the 1998 National Institute of Standards and Technology Speaker Recognition evaluation. While SRI experienced success with deep neural networks in speaker recognition, they were unsuccessful in demonstrating similar success in speech recognition. \nThe principle of elevating \"raw\" features over hand-crafted optimization was first explored successfully in the architecture of deep autoencoder on the \"raw\" spectrogram or linear filter-bank features in the late 1990s, showing its superiority over the Mel-Cepstral features that contain stages of fixed transformation from spectrograms. The raw features of speech, waveforms, later produced excellent larger-scale results.\n\nMany aspects of speech recognition were taken over by a deep learning method called long short-term memory (LSTM), a recurrent neural network published by Hochreiter and Schmidhuber in 1997. LSTM RNNs avoid the vanishing gradient problem and can learn \"Very Deep Learning\" tasks that require memories of events that happened thousands of discrete time steps before, which is important for speech. In 2003, LSTM started to become competitive with traditional speech recognizers on certain tasks. Later it was combined with connectionist temporal classification (CTC) in stacks of LSTM RNNs. In 2015, Google's speech recognition reportedly experienced a dramatic performance jump of 49% through CTC-trained LSTM, which they made available through Google Voice Search.\n\nIn 2006, publications by Geoff Hinton, Ruslan Salakhutdinov, Osindero and Teh\n\nDeep learning is part of state-of-the-art systems in various disciplines, particularly computer vision and automatic speech recognition (ASR). Results on commonly used evaluation sets such as TIMIT (ASR) and MNIST (image classification), as well as a range of large-vocabulary speech recognition tasks have steadily improved. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) were superseded for ASR by CTC for LSTM. but are more successful in computer vision.\n\nThe impact of deep learning in industry began in the early 2000s, when CNNs already processed an estimated 10% to 20% of all the checks written in the US, according to Yann LeCun. Industrial applications of deep learning to large-scale speech recognition started around 2010.\n\nThe 2009 NIPS Workshop on Deep Learning for Speech Recognition was motivated by the limitations of deep generative models of speech, and the possibility that given more capable hardware and large-scale data sets that deep neural nets (DNN) might become practical. It was believed that pre-training DNNs using generative models of deep belief nets (DBN) would overcome the main difficulties of neural nets. However, it was discovered that replacing pre-training with large amounts of training data for straightforward backpropagation when using DNNs with large, context-dependent output layers produced error rates dramatically lower than then-state-of-the-art Gaussian mixture model (GMM)/Hidden Markov Model (HMM) and also than more-advanced generative model-based systems. The nature of the recognition errors produced by the two types of systems was characteristically different, offering technical insights into how to integrate deep learning into the existing highly efficient, run-time speech decoding system deployed by all major speech recognition systems. Analysis around 2009-2010, contrasted the GMM (and other generative speech models) vs. DNN models, stimulated early industrial investment in deep learning for speech recognition, eventually leading to pervasive and dominant use in that industry. That analysis was done with comparable performance (less than 1.5% in error rate) between discriminative DNNs and generative models.\n\nIn 2010, researchers extended deep learning from TIMIT to large vocabulary speech recognition, by adopting large output layers of the DNN based on context-dependent HMM states constructed by decision trees.\n\nAdvances in hardware enabled the renewed interest. In 2009, Nvidia was involved in what was called the “big bang” of deep learning, “as deep-learning neural networks were trained with Nvidia graphics processing units (GPUs).” That year, Google Brain used Nvidia GPUs to create capable DNNs. While there, Ng determined that GPUs could increase the speed of deep-learning systems by about 100 times. In particular, GPUs are well-suited for the matrix/vector math involved in machine learning. GPUs speed up training algorithms by orders of magnitude, reducing running times from weeks to days. Specialized hardware and algorithm optimizations can be used for efficient processing.\n\nIn 2012, a team led by Dahl won the \"Merck Molecular Activity Challenge\" using multi-task deep neural networks to predict the biomolecular target of one drug. In 2014, Hochreiter's group used deep learning to detect off-target and toxic effects of environmental chemicals in nutrients, household products and drugs and won the \"Tox21 Data Challenge\" of NIH, FDA and NCATS.\n\nSignificant additional impacts in image or object recognition were felt from 2011 to 2012. Although CNNs trained by backpropagation had been around for decades, and GPU implementations of NNs for years, including CNNs, fast implementations of CNNs with max-pooling on GPUs in the style of Ciresan and colleagues were needed to progress on computer vision. In 2011, this approach achieved for the first time superhuman performance in a visual pattern recognition contest. Also in 2011, it won the ICDAR Chinese handwriting contest, and in May 2012, it won the ISBI image segmentation contest. Until 2011, CNNs did not play a major role at computer vision conferences, but in June 2012, a paper by Ciresan et al. at the leading conference CVPR showed how max-pooling CNNs on GPU can dramatically improve many vision benchmark records. In October 2012, a similar system by Krizhevsky et al. won the large-scale ImageNet competition by a significant margin over shallow machine learning methods. In November 2012, Ciresan et al.'s system also won the ICPR contest on analysis of large medical images for cancer detection, and in the following year also the MICCAI Grand Challenge on the same topic. In 2013 and 2014, the error rate on the ImageNet task using deep learning was further reduced, following a similar trend in large-scale speech recognition. The Wolfram Image Identification project publicized these improvements.\n\nImage classification was then extended to the more challenging task of generating descriptions (captions) for images, often as a combination of CNNs and LSTMs.\n\nSome researchers assess that the October 2012 ImageNet victory anchored the start of a \"deep learning revolution\" that has transformed the AI industry.\n\nArtificial neural networks (ANNs) or connectionist systems are computing systems inspired by the biological neural networks that constitute animal brains. Such systems learn (progressively improve their ability) to do tasks by considering examples, generally without task-specific programming. For example, in image recognition, they might learn to identify images that contain cats by analyzing example images that have been manually labeled as \"cat\" or \"no cat\" and using the analytic results to identify cats in other images. They have found most use in applications difficult to express with a traditional computer algorithm using rule-based programming.\n\nAn ANN is based on a collection of connected units called artificial neurons, (analogous to biological neurons in a biological brain). Each connection (synapse) between neurons can transmit a signal to another neuron. The receiving (postsynaptic) neuron can process the signal(s) and then signal downstream neurons connected to it. Neurons may have state, generally represented by real numbers, typically between 0 and 1. Neurons and synapses may also have a weight that varies as learning proceeds, which can increase or decrease the strength of the signal that it sends downstream.\n\nTypically, neurons are organized in layers. Different layers may perform different kinds of transformations on their inputs. Signals travel from the first (input), to the last (output) layer, possibly after traversing the layers multiple times.\n\nThe original goal of the neural network approach was to solve problems in the same way that a human brain would. Over time, attention focused on matching specific mental abilities, leading to deviations from biology such as backpropagation, or passing information in the reverse direction and adjusting the network to reflect that information.\n\nNeural networks have been used on a variety of tasks, including computer vision, speech recognition, machine translation, social network filtering, playing board and video games and medical diagnosis.\n\nAs of 2017, neural networks typically have a few thousand to a few million units and millions of connections. Despite this number being several order of magnitude less than the number of neurons on a human brain, these networks can perform many tasks at a level beyond that of humans (e.g., recognizing faces, playing \"Go\" ).\n\nA deep neural network (DNN) is an artificial neural network (ANN) with multiple layers between the input and output layers. The DNN finds the correct mathematical manipulation to turn the input into the output, whether it be a linear relationship or a non-linear relationship. The network moves through the layers calculating the probability of each output. For example, a DNN that is trained to recognize dog breeds will go over the given image and calculate the probability that the dog in the image is a certain breed. The user can review the results and select which probabilities the network should display (above a certain threshold, etc.) and return the proposed label. Each mathematical manipulation as such is considered a layer, and complex DNN have many layers, hence the name \"deep\" networks. The goal is that eventually, the network will be trained to decompose an image into features, identify trends that exist across all samples and classify new images by their similarities without requiring human input.\n\nDNNs can model complex non-linear relationships. DNN architectures generate compositional models where the object is expressed as a layered composition of primitives. The extra layers enable composition of features from lower layers, potentially modeling complex data with fewer units than a similarly performing shallow network.\n\nDeep architectures include many variants of a few basic approaches. Each architecture has found success in specific domains. It is not always possible to compare the performance of multiple architectures, unless they have been evaluated on the same data sets.\n\nDNNs are typically feedforward networks in which data flows from the input layer to the output layer without looping back. At first, the DNN creates a map of virtual neurons and assigns random numerical values, or \"weights\", to connections between them. The weights and inputs are multiplied and return an output between 0 and 1. If the network didn’t accurately recognize a particular pattern, an algorithm would adjust the weights. That way the algorithm can make certain parameters more influential, until it determines the correct mathematical manipulation to fully process the data.\n\nRecurrent neural networks (RNNs), in which data can flow in any direction, are used for applications such as language modeling. Long short-term memory is particularly effective for this use.\n\nConvolutional deep neural networks (CNNs) are used in computer vision. CNNs also have been applied to acoustic modeling for automatic speech recognition (ASR).\n\nAs with ANNs, many issues can arise with naively trained DNNs. Two common issues are overfitting and computation time.\n\nDNNs are prone to overfitting because of the added layers of abstraction, which allow them to model rare dependencies in the training data. Regularization methods such as Ivakhnenko's unit pruning or weight decay (formula_1-regularization) or sparsity (formula_2-regularization) can be applied during training to combat overfitting. Alternatively dropout regularization randomly omits units from the hidden layers during training. This helps to exclude rare dependencies. Finally, data can be augmented via methods such as cropping and rotating such that smaller training sets can be increased in size to reduce the chances of overfitting.\n\nDNNs must consider many training parameters, such as the size (number of layers and number of units per layer), the learning rate, and initial weights. Sweeping through the parameter space for optimal parameters may not be feasible due to the cost in time and computational resources. Various tricks, such as batching (computing the gradient on several training examples at once rather than individual examples) speed up computation. Large processing capabilities of many-core architectures (such as, GPUs or the Intel Xeon Phi) have produced significant speedups in training, because of the suitability of such processing architectures for the matrix and vector computations.\n\nAlternatively, engineers may look for other types of neural networks with more straightforward and convergent training algorithms. CMAC (cerebellar model articulation controller) is one such kind of neural network. It doesn't require learning rates or randomized initial weights for CMAC. The training process can be guaranteed to converge in one step with a new batch of data, and the computational complexity of the training algorithm is linear with respect to the number of neurons involved.\n\nLarge-scale automatic speech recognition is the first and most convincing successful case of deep learning. LSTM RNNs can learn \"Very Deep Learning\" tasks that involve multi-second intervals containing speech events separated by thousands of discrete time steps, where one time step corresponds to about 10 ms. LSTM with forget gates is competitive with traditional speech recognizers on certain tasks.\n\nThe initial success in speech recognition was based on small-scale recognition tasks based on TIMIT. The data set contains 630 speakers from eight major dialects of American English, where each speaker reads 10 sentences. Its small size lets many configurations be tried. More importantly, the TIMIT task concerns phone-sequence recognition, which, unlike word-sequence recognition, allows weak phone bigram language models. This lets the strength of the acoustic modeling aspects of speech recognition be more easily analyzed. The error rates listed below, including these early results and measured as percent phone error rates (PER), have been summarized since 1991.\n\nThe debut of DNNs for speaker recognition in the late 1990s and speech recognition around 2009-2011 and of LSTM around 2003-2007, accelerated progress in eight major areas:\n\n\nAll major commercial speech recognition systems (e.g., Microsoft Cortana, Xbox, Skype Translator, Amazon Alexa, Google Now, Apple Siri, Baidu and iFlyTek voice search, and a range of Nuance speech products, etc.) are based on deep learning.\n\nA common evaluation set for image classification is the MNIST database data set. MNIST is composed of handwritten digits and includes 60,000 training examples and 10,000 test examples. As with TIMIT, its small size lets users test multiple configurations. A comprehensive list of results on this set is available.\n\nDeep learning-based image recognition has become \"superhuman\", producing more accurate results than human contestants. This first occurred in 2011.\n\nDeep learning-trained vehicles now interpret 360° camera views. Another example is Facial Dysmorphology Novel Analysis (FDNA) used to analyze cases of human malformation connected to a large database of genetic syndromes.\n\nClosely related to the progress that has been made in image recognition is the increasing application of deep learning techniques to various visual art tasks. DNNs have proven themselves capable, for example, of a) identifying the style period of a given painting, b) \"capturing\" the style of a given painting and applying it in a visually pleasing manner to an arbitrary photograph, and c) generating striking imagery based on random visual input fields.\n\nNeural networks have been used for implementing language models since the early 2000s. LSTM helped to improve machine translation and language modeling.\n\nOther key techniques in this field are negative sampling and word embedding. Word embedding, such as \"word2vec\", can be thought of as a representational layer in a deep learning architecture that transforms an atomic word into a positional representation of the word relative to other words in the dataset; the position is represented as a point in a vector space. Using word embedding as an RNN input layer allows the network to parse sentences and phrases using an effective compositional vector grammar. A compositional vector grammar can be thought of as probabilistic context free grammar (PCFG) implemented by an RNN. Recursive auto-encoders built atop word embeddings can assess sentence similarity and detect paraphrasing. Deep neural architectures provide the best results for constituency parsing, sentiment analysis, information retrieval, spoken language understanding, machine translation, contextual entity linking, writing style recognition, Text classification and others.\n\nRecent developments generalize word embedding to sentence embedding.\n\nGoogle Translate (GT) uses a large end-to-end long short-term memory network. Google Neural Machine Translation (GNMT) uses an example-based machine translation method in which the system \"learns from millions of examples.\" It translates \"whole sentences at a time, rather than pieces. Google Translate supports over one hundred languages. The network encodes the \"semantics of the sentence rather than simply memorizing phrase-to-phrase translations\". GT uses English as an intermediate between most language pairs.\n\nA large percentage of candidate drugs fail to win regulatory approval. These failures are caused by insufficient efficacy (on-target effect), undesired interactions (off-target effects), or unanticipated toxic effects. Research has explored use of deep learning to predict the biomolecular targets, off-targets, and toxic effects of environmental chemicals in nutrients, household products and drugs.\n\nAtomNet is a deep learning system for structure-based rational drug design. AtomNet was used to predict novel candidate biomolecules for disease targets such as the Ebola virus and multiple sclerosis.\n\nDeep reinforcement learning has been used to approximate the value of possible direct marketing actions, defined in terms of RFM variables. The estimated value function was shown to have a natural interpretation as customer lifetime value.\n\nRecommendation systems have used deep learning to extract meaningful features for a latent factor model for content-based music recommendations. Multiview deep learning has been applied for learning user preferences from multiple domains. The model uses a hybrid collaborative and content-based approach and enhances recommendations in multiple tasks.\n\nAn autoencoder ANN was used in bioinformatics, to predict gene ontology annotations and gene-function relationships.\n\nIn medical informatics, deep learning was used to predict sleep quality based on data from wearables and predictions of health complications from electronic health record data. Deep learning has also showed efficacy in healthcare.\n\nFinding the appropriate mobile audience for mobile advertising is always challenging, since many data points must be considered and assimilated before a target segment can be created and used in ad serving by any ad server. Deep learning has been used to interpret large, many-dimensioned advertising datasets. Many data points are collected during the request/serve/click internet advertising cycle. This information can form the basis of machine learning to improve ad selection.\n\nDeep learning has been successfully applied to inverse problems such as denoising, super-resolution, inpainting, and film colorization. These applications include learning methods such as \"Shrinkage Fields for Effective Image Restoration\" which trains on an image dataset, and Deep Image Prior, which trains on the image that needs restoration.\n\nDeep learning is being successfully applied to financial fraud detection and anti-money laundering. \"Deep anti-money laundering detection system can spot and recognize relationships and similarities between data and, further down the road, learn to detect anomalies or classify and predict specific events\". The solution leverages both supervised learning techniques, such as the classification of suspicious transactions, and unsupervised learning, e.g. anomaly detection.\n\nThe Department of Defense applied deep learning to train robots in new tasks through observation. \n\nDeep learning is closely related to a class of theories of brain development (specifically, neocortical development) proposed by cognitive neuroscientists in the early 1990s. These developmental theories were instantiated in computational models, making them predecessors of deep learning systems. These developmental models share the property that various proposed learning dynamics in the brain (e.g., a wave of nerve growth factor) support the self-organization somewhat analogous to the neural networks utilized in deep learning models. Like the neocortex, neural networks employ a hierarchy of layered filters in which each layer considers information from a prior layer (or the operating environment), and then passes its output (and possibly the original input), to other layers. This process yields a self-organizing stack of transducers, well-tuned to their operating environment. A 1995 description stated, \"...the infant's brain seems to organize itself under the influence of waves of so-called trophic-factors ... different regions of the brain become connected sequentially, with one layer of tissue maturing before another and so on until the whole brain is mature.\"\n\nA variety of approaches have been used to investigate the plausibility of deep learning models from a neurobiological perspective. On the one hand, several variants of the backpropagation algorithm have been proposed in order to increase its processing realism. Other researchers have argued that unsupervised forms of deep learning, such as those based on hierarchical generative models and deep belief networks, may be closer to biological reality. In this respect, generative neural network models have been related to neurobiological evidence about sampling-based processing in the cerebral cortex.\n\nAlthough a systematic comparison between the human brain organization and the neuronal encoding in deep networks has not yet been established, several analogies have been reported. For example, the computations performed by deep learning units could be similar to those of actual neurons and neural populations. Similarly, the representations developed by deep learning models are similar to those measured in the primate visual system both at the single-unit and at the population levels.\n\nMany organizations employ deep learning for particular applications. Facebook's AI lab performs tasks such as automatically tagging uploaded pictures with the names of the people in them.\n\nGoogle's DeepMind Technologies developed a system capable of learning how to play Atari video games using only pixels as data input. In 2015 they demonstrated their AlphaGo system, which learned the game of Go well enough to beat a professional Go player. Google Translate uses an LSTM to translate between more than 100 languages.\n\nIn 2015, Blippar demonstrated a mobile augmented reality application that uses deep learning to recognize objects in real time.\n\nAs of 2008, researchers at The University of Texas at Austin (UT) developed a machine learning framework called Training an Agent Manually via Evaluative Reinforcement, or TAMER, which proposed new methods for robots or computer programs to learn how to perform tasks by interacting with a human instructor.\n\nFirst developed as TAMER, a new algorithm called Deep TAMER was later introduced in 2018 during a collaboration between U.S. Army Research Laboratory (ARL) and UT researchers. Deep TAMER used deep learning to provide a robot the ability to learn new tasks through observation.\n\nUsing Deep TAMER, a robot learned a task with a human trainer, watching video streams or observing a human perform a task in-person. The robot later practiced the task with the help of some coaching from the trainer, who provided feedback such as “good job” and “bad job.”\n\nDeep learning has attracted both criticism and comment, in some cases from outside the field of computer science.\n\nA main criticism concerns the lack of theory surrounding some methods. Learning in the most common deep architectures is implemented using well-understood gradient descent. However, the theory surrounding other algorithms, such as contrastive divergence is less clear. (e.g., Does it converge? If so, how fast? What is it approximating?) Deep learning methods are often looked at as a black box, with most confirmations done empirically, rather than theoretically.\n\nOthers point out that deep learning should be looked at as a step towards realizing strong AI, not as an all-encompassing solution. Despite the power of deep learning methods, they still lack much of the functionality needed for realizing this goal entirely. Research psychologist Gary Marcus noted:\"Realistically, deep learning is only part of the larger challenge of building intelligent machines. Such techniques lack ways of representing causal relationships (...) have no obvious ways of performing logical inferences, and they are also still a long way from integrating abstract knowledge, such as information about what objects are, what they are for, and how they are typically used. The most powerful A.I. systems, like Watson (...) use techniques like deep learning as just one element in a very complicated ensemble of techniques, ranging from the statistical technique of Bayesian inference to deductive reasoning.\"As an alternative to this emphasis on the limits of deep learning, one author speculated that it might be possible to train a machine vision stack to perform the sophisticated task of discriminating between \"old master\" and amateur figure drawings, and hypothesized that such a sensitivity might represent the rudiments of a non-trivial machine empathy. This same author proposed that this would be in line with anthropology, which identifies a concern with aesthetics as a key element of behavioral modernity.\n\nIn further reference to the idea that artistic sensitivity might inhere within relatively low levels of the cognitive hierarchy, a published series of graphic representations of the internal states of deep (20-30 layers) neural networks attempting to discern within essentially random data the images on which they were trained demonstrate a visual appeal: the original research notice received well over 1,000 comments, and was the subject of what was for a time the most frequently accessed article on \"The Guardian's\" web site.\n\nSome deep learning architectures display problematic behaviors, such as confidently classifying unrecognizable images as belonging to a familiar category of ordinary images and misclassifying minuscule perturbations of correctly classified images. Goertzel hypothesized that these behaviors are due to limitations in their internal representations and that these limitations would inhibit integration into heterogeneous multi-component AGI architectures. These issues may possibly be addressed by deep learning architectures that internally form states homologous to image-grammar decompositions of observed entities and events. Learning a grammar (visual or linguistic) from training data would be equivalent to restricting the system to commonsense reasoning that operates on concepts in terms of grammatical production rules and is a basic goal of both human language acquisition and AI.\n\nAs deep learning moves from the lab into the world, research and experience shows that artificial neural networks are vulnerable to hacks and deception. By identifying patterns that these systems use to function, attackers can modify inputs to ANNs in such a way that the ANN finds a match that human observers would not recognize. For example, an attacker can make subtle changes to an image such that the ANN finds a match even though the image looks to a human nothing like the search target. Such a manipulation is termed an “adversarial attack.” In 2016 researchers used one ANN to doctor images in trial and error fashion, identify another's focal points and thereby generate images that deceived it. The modified images looked no different to human eyes. Another group showed that printouts of doctored images then photographed successfully tricked an image classification system. One defense is reverse image search, in which a possible fake image is submitted to a site such as TinEye that can then find other instances of it. A refinement is to search using only parts of the image, to identify images from which that piece may have been taken.\n\nAnother group showed that certain psychedelic spectacles could fool a facial recognition system into thinking ordinary people were celebrities, potentially allowing one person to impersonate another. In 2017 researchers added stickers to stop signs and caused an ANN to misclassify them.\n\nANNs can however be further trained to detect attempts at deception, potentially leading attackers and defenders into an arms race similar to the kind that already defines the malware defense industry. ANNs have been trained to defeat ANN-based anti-malware software by repeatedly attacking a defense with malware that was continually altered by a genetic algorithm until it tricked the anti-malware while retaining its ability to damage the target.\n\nAnother group demonstrated that certain sounds could make the Google Now voice command system open a particular web address that would download malware.\n\nIn “data poisoning”, false data is continually smuggled into a machine learning system’s training set to prevent it from achieving mastery.\n\n"}
{"id": "7563524", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7563524", "title": "Dinosaur renaissance", "text": "Dinosaur renaissance\n\nThe dinosaur renaissance was a small-scale scientific revolution that started in the late 1960s, and led to renewed academic and popular interest in dinosaurs. It was sparked by new discoveries and research indicating that dinosaurs may have been active and warm-blooded animals, rather than cold-blooded and sluggish as had been the prevailing view and description during the first half of the twentieth century.\n\nThe new view of dinosaurs was championed by John Ostrom, who argued that birds evolved from coelurosaurian dinosaurs, and particularly Robert Bakker who argued passionately that dinosaurs were warm-blooded in a way similar to modern mammals and birds. Bakker frequently portrayed his ideas as a renaissance of those popular in the late nineteenth century, referring to the period in between the Dinosaur Wars and the dinosaur renaissance as \"the dinosaur doldrums\".\n\nThe dinosaur renaissance led to a profound shift in thinking on nearly all aspects of dinosaur biology, including physiology, evolution, behaviour, ecology and extinction. It also led to many depictions of dinosaurs in popular culture.\n\nIn the mid and latter parts of the nineteenth century, many scientists thought there was a close relationship between birds and dinosaurs—and that dinosaurs represented an intermediate stage between \"reptiles\" and birds.\n\nShortly after the 1859 publication of Charles Darwin's \"The Origin of Species\", British biologist and evolution-defender Thomas Henry Huxley proposed that birds were descendants of dinosaurs. He cited skeletal similarities, particularly among dinosaurs, the \"first bird\"—\"Archaeopteryx\"—and modern birds.\n\nHowever, in 1926, Gerhard Heilmann wrote his influential book \"The Origin of Birds\", in which he dismissed the dinosaur–bird link, based on the dinosaurs' supposed lack of a furcula. Thereafter, the accepted hypothesis was that birds evolved from crocodylomorph and thecodont ancestors, rather than from dinosaurs. This removed dinosaurs from a central role in debates about the origin of living species, and may have contributed to the decline of academic interest in dinosaur evolution.\n\nThis situation persisted until 1964, when John Ostrom discovered a small carnivorous dinosaur which he named \"Deinonychus antirrhopus\", a theropod whose skeletal resemblance to birds seemed unmistakable. This led Ostrom to argue that Huxley had been right, and that birds had indeed evolved from dinosaurs. Although it was \"Deinonychus\" that inspired Ostrom to connect birds with dinosaurs, very similar birdlike dinosaurs, such as \"Velociraptor\", had been known for many decades, but no connection had been made. After Ostrom's discoveries, the idea that birds evolved from dinosaurs gained support among palaeontologists, and today it is almost universally accepted. Newer methods, such as cladistics, and the discovery of several feathered dinosaurs have helped confirm the relationship.\n\nThe relationship between dinosaurs and birds has led to considerable interest in dinosaur—particularly theropod—phylogeny, which is now far better understood.\n\nInitially, dinosaurs were thought to be a monophyletic group, comprising animals with a common ancestor not shared by other reptiles. However, Harry Seeley disagreed with this interpretation, and split the Dinosauria into two orders, the Saurischia (\"lizard-hipped\") and the Ornithischia (\"bird-hipped\"), which were seen as members of the Archosauria with no special relationship to each other. As such, the Dinosauria was no longer seen as a scientific grouping, and \"dinosaur\" was reduced to being a popular term, without scientific meaning. This became the standard interpretation throughout much of the twentieth century.\n\nThis changed in 1974, when Bakker and Peter Galton published a paper in \"Nature\", arguing that not only were dinosaurs a natural monophyletic group, but that they should be raised to the status of a new class, which would also contain birds. Although initially this revival of dinosaur monophyly was controversial, the idea did gain acceptance, and since the rise of cladistic methodology, it has been nearly universally supported. The raising of the Dinosauria to class rank found less support, perhaps largely due to increasing use of phylogenetic taxonomy among vertebrate palaeontologists, in which ranks are entirely abandoned.\n\nIn a series of scientific papers, books, and popular articles in the 1970s and 1980s, beginning with his 1968 paper \"The superiority of dinosaurs\", Robert Bakker argued strenuously that dinosaurs were warm-blooded and active animals, capable of sustained periods of high activity. In most of his writings Bakker framed his arguments as new evidence leading to a revival of ideas popular in the late 19th century, frequently referring to an ongoing \"dinosaur renaissance\". He used a variety of anatomical and statistical arguments to defend his case, the methodology of which was fiercely debated among scientists.\n\nThese debates sparked interest in new methods for ascertaining the palaeobiology of extinct animals, such as bone histology, which have been successfully applied to determining the growth-rates of many dinosaurs.\n\nToday, it is generally thought that many or perhaps all dinosaurs had higher metabolic rates than living reptiles, but also that the situation is more complex and varied than Bakker originally proposed. For example, while smaller dinosaurs may have been true endotherms, the larger forms could have been inertial homeotherms, or many dinosaurs could have had intermediate metabolic rates.\n\nThe late 1960s also saw several new theories on the way dinosaurs behaved, often involving sophisticated social behaviour.\n\nOn the basis of trackways, Bakker argued that sauropod dinosaurs moved in structured herds, with the adults surrounding the juveniles in a protective ring. However, shortly afterwards this particular interpretation was challenged by Ostrom among others, although the venerable dinosaur track expert Roland T. Bird apparently agreed with Bakker.\n\nThe first rigorous study of dinosaur nesting behaviour came in the late 1970s, when palaeontologist Jack Horner showed that the duckbilled dinosaur \"Maiasaura\" cared for its young.\n\nThe dinosaur renaissance changed not only scientific ideas about dinosaurs, but also their portrayal by artists. Bakker, himself a talented artist, often illustrated his ideas in a lively fashion. Indeed, Bakker's illustration of \"Deinonychus\", made for Ostrom's 1969 description, has become one of the most recognisable and iconic of dinosaur restorations.\n\nDuring the 1970s, restorations of dinosaurs shifted from being lizard-like, to being more mammal- and bird-like. Artists started to show dinosaurs in more active poses, and incorporating newer theories of dinosaur locomotion and behaviour. Tails that were widely shown as having been dragged behind a creature, were now shown uplifted, in order to balance the huge bodies while active.\n\nBesides Bakker, key artists in this \"new wave\" were first Mark Hallett, Gregory S. Paul in the 1970s, and during the 1980s Doug Henderson and John Gurche.\n\nGregory Paul in particular defended and expanded on Bakker's ideas on dinosaur anatomy. He expounded a rigorous and detailed approach to dinosaur restoration, in which he often criticised the errors of the traditionalist approach. He also produced a large number of restorations showing small dinosaurs with feathers, and defended the idea in a number of articles and his book \"Predatory Dinosaurs of the World\". His view was proven largely correct in the late 1990s with the discovery of several feathered dinosaurs. Paul's ideas and style have had a significant impact on dinosaur art, and likely will continue to do so for some time.\n\nTraditionally paleontology had followed geology in preferring uniformitarian mechanisms, despite the promotion by Eugene Merle Shoemaker of the importance of catastrophic impacts. During the renaissance period Walter Alvarez and others found iridium in the Cretaceous–Tertiary boundary layer. Also the Chicxulub Crater, was identified and determined to be due to a meteor impact. These discoveries led to the acceptance and popularisation of the idea that the extinction had been caused by an impact event. This in turn undermined the assumption that dinosaurs had become extinct because they were inferior to mammals. Instead it suggested they had fallen prey to a random event which no large animal could have survived.\n\nBakker's non-technical articles and books, particularly \"The Dinosaur Heresies\", have contributed significantly to the popularization of dinosaur science.\n\n\"The Land Before Time\" was one of the first films to portray theropods in the correct horizontal pose, though the tripod pose was used more often.\n\nThe 1993 film version of \"Jurassic Park\" was perhaps the most significant event in raising public awareness of dinosaur renaissance theories. For the first time in a major film, dinosaurs were portrayed as intelligent, agile, warm-blooded animals, rather than lumbering monsters more common to older films. Jack Horner was a consultant, and the artwork of Gregory Paul, Mark Hallett, Doug Henderson, and John Gurche were used in pre-production. While the dinosaurs eventually shown in the films had various anatomical inaccuracies, all four of these artists are in the on-screen credits as \"Dinosaur Specialists\". Bakker himself was not consulted or credited, but his research is referenced by one of the characters in the film, and a Bakker look-alike appears in the sequel \"\".\n\n\n"}

There have been some cases in which an alleged act of homicide has occurred and the prime suspect may have committed the act while sleepwalking. The veracity of recorded cases is disputed. About 68 cases had been reported in the literature up to the year 2005. One such case is that of Kenneth Parks, who was acquitted of the murder of his mother-in-law in 1987 after using the sleepwalking defense.\n\nSergeant Willis Boshears was a US serviceman based in the UK. He confessed to strangling a local woman named Jean Constable in the early hours on New Years Day 1961, but claimed that he was asleep and only woke to realize what he had done. The following day, Boshears disposed of the body in an isolated lane. Several days later he was arrested and charged with murder. At his trial in February 1961 at the Essex Assizes he pled not guilty on the basis of being asleep at the time he committed the offence and was acquitted.\n\nIn 1987, Kenneth James Parks was a married 23-year-old Canadian man with a 5-month-old daughter. He had a very close relationship to his in-laws, with his 42-year-old mother-in-law Barbara Ann Woods referring to him as \"her gentle giant.\" The summer before the controversial events, he developed a gambling problem and fell into deep financial problems. To cover his losses, he took funds from his family's savings and then began to embezzle at work. Eventually, in March 1987, his actions were discovered, and he was fired from his job. On May 20, he went to his first Gamblers Anonymous meeting. He made plans to tell his grandmother the following Saturday (May 23) and his in-laws on Sunday (May 24) about his gambling problems and financial difficulties.\n\nOn an early morning on May 24, 1987, Kenneth Parks drove 20 kilometers from Pickering, Ontario to the house of his in-laws in Scarborough, Ontario. He entered their house with a key they had previously given him and used a tire iron to bludgeon his mother-in-law to death. He then turned on his father-in-law, attempting to choke him to death, but he managed to survive the attack. He got back in his car and, despite being covered with blood, drove straight to a nearby police station and confessed, turning himself in, stating \"I think I have just killed two people\".\n\nParks's only defense was that he was asleep during the entire incident and was not aware of what he was doing. Naturally, nobody believed it; even sleep specialists were extremely skeptical. However, after careful investigation, the specialists could find no other explanation. Parks’ EEG readings were highly irregular even for a parasomniac. This combined with the facts that there was no motive, that he was amazingly consistent in his stories for more than seven interviews despite repeated attempts of trying to lead him astray, that the timing of the events fit perfectly with the proposed explanation, and that there is no way to fake EEG results, led to a jury acquitting Parks of the murder of his mother-in-law and the attempted murder of his father-in-law. The Supreme Court of Canada upheld the acquittal in the 1992 decision \"R v Parks\".\n\nScott Falater, a resident of Phoenix, Arizona was accused of murdering his wife, Yarmila, by stabbing her 44 times on the night of January 16, 1997. According to an eyewitness, Falater was also seen holding his wife’s head underwater. When he was tried, the prosecution claimed that after the murder had been committed, Falater changed his clothes, put the murder weapon in a Tupperware container, put the container in a trash bag with his boots and socks, and then stashed the bag in the spare tire well in the trunk of his car. Prosecutors testified that Falater's actions were \"too complex\" to have been carried out while sleepwalking. In June 1999, Scott Falater was convicted of first degree murder and sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole.\n\nAntonio Nieto, 58, a resident of Málaga, Spain murdered his wife and mother in law using an axe and a hammer on January 11, 2001. Nieto's daughter suffered a jaw fracture but was left alone after feigning death, and his son disarmed him after receiving a cut on the ear. Nieto claimed to have been asleep during the attack and dreaming that he was defending himself against aggressive ostriches. However, his children stated that he had recognized them and had even told his son to not turn on the lights because their mother (gravely injured already) was sleeping. In 2007 Nieto (already under psychiatric treatment) was sentenced to 10 years interment in a psychiatric hospital and ordered to pay 171,100 euros as compensation to the victims.\n\nOn October 30, 2004, the body of 83-year-old Edward Lowe was found on his driveway in Manchester, England. His son, Jules, admitted that he caused his father's death, but did not remember committing the act. He has used \"automatism\" as his defense. He was found not guilty by reason of insanity and detained at Her Majesty's pleasure (that is, indefinitely) in a secure hospital. He was released after ten months.\n\nBrian Thomas, 59, who suffered from automatism and sleepwalking since he was a child, confessed to strangling his 57-year old wife, Christine in July 2008 in their camper van while on vacation. He called emergency services, and was heard telling the operator, \"What have I done? I've been trying to wake her. I think I've killed my wife. Oh my God. I thought someone had broken in. I was fighting with those boys but it was Christine. I must have been dreaming or something. What have I done?...\" He claimed he had mistaken his wife for an intruder, waking up to find it was his wife. He was freed in 2009 by a judge, who found him not guilty of murder.\n\nIn \"The Book of Lists 3\" there is a list of eight people who were recorded as having killed in their sleep by means of using firearms, fighting, or mishandling infants.\n\n\"A. F. \" was a gun fancier and a hunter who kept loaded firearms in his room. His father, with similar interests, slept in the adjoining room. Hearing a bump against the connecting door early one morning, \"A.F.\", still asleep, hollered \"You dog, what do you want here?\" and fired the gun nearest to his reach. The intruder turned out to be his father.\n\nSimon Fraser, of Glasgow, Scotland, often dreamed that a beast had invaded his home at night. One time, he dreamed that a white beast had come up through the floor. He seized it and dashed it to the ground. He woke up to find he had killed his infant son. This episode was probably a night terror, with or without sleepwalking.\n\nWasyl Gnypiuk, a Polish immigrant to England, had suffered Nazi internment which caused him to have nightmares. In one of these, he dreamed of fighting back. In fact, he was in the home of his landlady, and when he woke up it turned out he had beaten her to death. He decided to cut off her head and bury it in a nearby woods. He buried the rest of her some 60 yards from the house. He also stole £350 from her. He was found guilty of capital murder, sentenced to death and hanged at Lincoln on January 27, 1961.\n\nEsther Griggs, resident of London and a mother of three, dreamt one night that her house was on fire, screaming \"save my children!\". Though asleep, Ms. Griggs threw her baby into the street. This episode was probably a night terror, with or without sleepwalking.\n\nJo Ann Kiger, a teenager, was asleep when she took a revolver in each hand, poised to defend her family against a \"monster.\" She fired, and fatally shot her brother and her father. She was found not guilty.\n\nIn 1887, Robert Ledru, a French police detective, was asked to investigate the murder of André Monet on the beach at Le Havre. Examining the evidence—the fatal bullet and some footprints—he decides he himself had been sleepwalking on the beach and fired the fatal shot. He turned himself in. While in jail, he was given a gun loaded with blanks. One night he got up and fired at one of the guards at point blank range. This convinced the authorities he was telling the truth about his sleepwalking. From then until his death he lived on a farm outside Paris, under 24-hour watch.\n\nFrederick Oughton's novel \"The Two Lives of Robert Ledru\" is based on this case.\n\nWilliam Pollard was a farmer whose neighbors knew him well as a sleepwalker and sleep\"worker\"—doing his chicken-farm chores while fast asleep. One night he dreamt he was fighting with a marauding stranger. When his wife awakened him, he found he had killed their daughter.\n\nThe volume says how the law dealt with these cases, adding that Western law recognizes sleepwalking as a defense but is otherwise not consistent.\"Griggs was charged but the grand jury refused to hand down an indictment; Pollard was never charged; 'A. F.,' Kiger, and Boshears were acquitted; Fraser was not formally acquitted but the court adjourned and then deserted the \"diet simpliciter\", Ledru was acquitted and both were ordered by the court to sleep henceforth only by themselves, in locked rooms; while Gnypiuk, denied an appeal to the House of Lords Appellate Committee, was hanged.\"\n\nSleepwalking and other forms of disorders of arousal occur from deep non-REM slow wave sleep (SWS). There are parasomnias that occur from rapid eye movement sleep. It is caused by an inappropriate physiological event where the brain tries to exit SWS and go straight to wake. In normal sleep, the brain transitions from sleep either from stages 1 or 2 of NREM or REM sleep, but almost never from SWS. As a result, the brain gets “stuck” between a sleep and wake state. In the case of Kenneth Parks, his EEG showed that his brain tries to wake from SWS 10 to 20 times a night. Needless to say, this is an incredible number compared to normal sleepers who almost never experience this. Nobody is sure why some people will commit murders in their sleepwalking episodes, but it seems reasonable to assume that many conditions must be met. Using Kenneth Parks as an example again, he was planning to go to his in-laws’ residence the next day, he was stressed and depressed from marital and financial troubles, and he had been sleep deprived because he couldn’t get any sleep the night before.\n\nIn the first season of the \"Perry Mason\" TV series, one episode was titled \"The Case of the Sleepwalker's Niece.\"\n\nOn the episode \"Dreamcatchers\" in the fifth season of the TV series \"Teen Wolf\".\n\nIn the episode 'In the Dark' of Criminal Minds, a serial killer suffers with this illness, killing multiple people during the night.\n\nIn the webcomic and animated short \"Welcome to Hell\", the main character Sock accidentally kills his parents in his sleep.\n\nThe 1920 German horror film \"The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari\" centers upon a series of murders committed by a somnambulist under control of the eponymous Dr. Caligari.\n\nThe 1932 American gentlemen jewel thief romantic heist comedy \"Arsene Lupin\" features numerous depictions of somnambulism, specifically sleepwalking both real and faked by various characters.\n\nThe 1971 Italian thriller \"A Lizard in a Woman's Skin\" involves a woman who thinks she may have murdered a neighbor in her sleep.\n\nThe 1997 TV movie \"The Sleepwalker Killing\" depicts a story in which a man kills his mother-in-law and wounds his father-in-law in the middle of the night, then turns himself in.\n\nThe 2010 thriller \"In My Sleep\" depicts a character who believes he may have murdered a good friend while sleepwalking. The movie was inspired by real life cases.\n\nThe 2013 thriller \"Side Effects\" focuses on a woman who allegedly kills her husband while sleepwalking due to a side effect of the medication she is taking.\n\n\nWalker, N, (1968) Crime and Insanity in England Volume One: The Historical Perspective’, Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press. \n"}

Scott Washington first appeared in \"The New Warriors\" #21 (March 1992) by writer Fabian Nicieza and penciller Mark Bagley. The Hybrid symbiote first appeared in \"Venom: Along Came A Spider\" #1 (January 1996) by writer Evan Skolnick and penciller Patrick Zircher.\n\nCreated by writer Fabian Nicieza and penciller Mark Bagley, Scott Washington appears in \"The New Warriors\" #21 (March 1992), #25-26 and #36. In 1996, he is the main character Hybrid in the back-up stories in two miniseries \"Venom: Along Came a Spider\" and \"Venom: The Hunted\", all written by Evan Skolnick.\n\nIn 2007, he is mentioned in \"Civil War: Battle Damage Report\" #1. Hybrid is also mentioned at the conclusion of the first issue of \"Carnage U.S.A.\" (2011), along with Venom, Anti-Venom, Toxin, and Scorn, as being the next option to stop Carnage's rampage in the Mid-west after the Avengers are defeated.\n\nHe has an entry in \"All-New Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A to Z\" #5 - 'Gorgon to Jury' (2006) and an entry in \"Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A to Z\" HC vol. 05 - 'Guardsmen to Jackal (Warren)' (2008).\n\nScott Washington was an African-American Guardsman involved in guarding and transporting Justice who had been arrested and sentenced to the Vault prison for supervillains.\n\nThe Hybrid symbiote is an amalgamation of four symbiotes (Riot, Phage, Lasher and Agony) into a single symbiote entity. The fused symbiote then sought out Washington in the Vault's lab facility. While guarding the symbiotes, Scott realized that they were not evil, not a threat, and the experiments were causing the organism terrible pain, so he let it go. When his superiors discovered that Scott had released the aliens he was supposed to guard, Scott was fired. He returned to the Bedford-Stuyvesant section of Brooklyn, the gang-torn neighborhood in which he grew up. Following a basketball court scuffle with the Eazy X gang, Scott and his brother Derek were shot: Derek was killed while Scott became crippled, losing the use of his legs.\n\nThe Hybrid symbiote afterwards located and bonded with Scott, which resulted in Scott regaining the ability to walk, and more since Scott has a lot of anger, so often the symbiotes hold him back from acts of violence, not the other way around. Since the Hybrid symbiote was originally four different entities, Scott has to contend with four different voices/personalities in his head besides his own. As Hybrid, Scott got revenge on the Eazy Xs gang that had crippled him. Hybrid began to get a lot of press attention. While most of Hybrid's publicity was positive, The Jury's attention got drawn anyway. Despite Scott and Curtis Elkins (Sentry) being former co-workers, Hybrid would've been executed by these self-appointed guardians of justice just for being a symbiote host but was rescued by the New Warriors. Justice offered membership in the group but Scott declined, citing more important work to do in his home neighborhood.\n\nScott Washington was considered as a \"potential recruit\" for the program.\n\nScott is hunted down and murdered by Eddie Brock as part of a goal to eliminate the symbiotes' \"evil\" from Earth. The Hybrid symbiote is later separated into the four symbiotes by a clandestine military group to be used by the U.S. Government.\n\nLike Spider-Man and the Venom symbiote, Hybrid has wall-crawling and web-slinging abilities, and can form pseudopodia or tendrils to create snares and bladed weapons. Hybrid also has the ability to camouflage, such as its ability to mimic clothes on the person it has bonded with. It also has a border-line warning sense and can \"see\" through symbiote itself. Hybrid can also detach a piece of itself to send messages to allies, and can change shape to form a membrane that allows it to glide through the air. The Hybrid symbiote can also absorb various materials and chemicals, such as Spider-Man's synthetic webbing.\n\nLike the Venom and Carnage symbiotes, the Hybrid symbiote has superhuman strength. With Scott Washington as its host, he regained his ability to walk which he had lost during a gang fight. After Washington's death and being forcibly separated, the symbiotes became catatonic and no longer retain sentience.\n\n\n"}

The TRH stimulates the anterior pituitary to produce thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH). The TSH, in turn, stimulates the thyroid to produce thyroid hormone until levels in the blood return to normal. Thyroid hormone exerts negative feedback control over the hypothalamus as well as anterior pituitary, thus controlling the release of both TRH from hypothalamus and TSH from anterior pituitary gland.\n\nThe HPA, HPG, and HPT axes are three pathways in which the hypothalamus and pituitary direct neuroendocrine function.\n\nThyroid homeostasis results from a multi-loop feedback system that is found in virtually all higher vertebrates. Proper function of thyrotropic feedback control is indispensable for growth, differentiation, reproduction and intelligence. Very few animals (e.g. axolotls and sloths) have impaired thyroid homeostasis that exhibits a very low set-point that is assumed to underlie the metabolic and ontogenetic anomalies of these animals.\n\nThe pituitary gland secretes thyrotropin (TSH; Thyroid Stimulating Hormone) that stimulates the thyroid to secrete thyroxine (T4) and, to a lesser degree, triiodothyronine (T3). The major portion of T3, however, is produced in peripheral organs, e.g. liver, adipose tissue, glia and skeletal muscle by deiodination from circulating T4. Deiodination is controlled by numerous hormones and nerval signals including TSH, vasopressin and catecholamines.\n\nBoth peripheral thyroid hormones (iodothyronines) inhibit thyrotropin secretion from the pituitary (negative feedback). Consequently, equilibrium concentrations for all hormones are attained.\n\nTSH secretion is also controlled by thyrotropin releasing hormone (thyroliberin, TRH), whose secretion itself is again suppressed by plasma T4 and T3 in CSF (long feedback, Fekete–Lechan loop). Additional feedback loops are ultrashort feedback control of TSH secretion (Brokken-Wiersinga-Prummel loop) and linear feedback loops controlling plasma protein binding.\n\nRecent research suggested the existence of an additional feedforward motif linking TSH release to deiodinase activity in humans. The existence of this TSH-T3 shunt could explain why deiodinase activity is higher in hypothyroid patients and why a minor fraction of affected individuals may benefit from substitution therapy with T3.\n\nConvergence of multiple afferent signals in the control of TSH release including but not limited to T3, cytokines and TSH receptor antibodies may be the reason for the observation that the relation between free T4 concentration and TSH levels deviates from a pure loglinear relation that has previously been proposed.\n\n\nStandard procedures cover the determination of serum levels of the following hormones:\n\nFor special conditions the following assays and procedures may be required:\n\n\n"}
{"id": "28863514", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=28863514", "title": "Last Day of the Dinosaurs", "text": "Last Day of the Dinosaurs\n\nLast Day of the Dinosaurs is a 2010 Discovery Channel television documentary about the extinction of the dinosaurs. It portrays the Alvarez hypothesis as the cause of extinction. The documentary was released on August 28, 2010 and narrated by Bill Mondy.\n\nThe dinosaur models created for \"Clash of the Dinosaurs\" were reused for this program. The \"Parasaurolophus\" model was used for \"Charonosaurus\" even though the legs of \"Charonosaurus\" were shorter than those of \"Parasaurolophus\". The \"Deinonychus\" model was used for \"Saurornithoides\" (rather inaccurately, as \"Saurornithoides\" was slenderer than \"Deinonychus\"), and the \"Sauroposeidon\" model was used for \"Alamosaurus\" (even though \"Alamosaurus\" had different proportions than \"Sauroposeidon\"). The same \"Tyrannosaurus\", \"Triceratops\", \"Ankylosaurus\", and \"Quetzalcoatlus\" models were also used. These models were placed upon different backdrops most of the time than those used in \"Clash of the Dinosaurs\".\n\nIn the Pacific Northwest of North America, a \"Quetzalcoatlus\" is soaring above the valley during a rainstorm when it spots an unguarded \"Tyrannosaurus Rex\" nest. The pterosaur flies down and consumes several of the hatchlings. Meanwhile, the father \"Tyrannosaurus\" is hunting for prey in the forest when his acute sense of smell alerts him to the intruder at the nest and runs back towards the nest. The \"Quetzalcoatlus\" is forced to flee when the enraged father \"Tyrannosaurus\" arrives, trying to fly off but its huge wings prevent it from flying in the thick forest. The \"T. rex\" repeatedly lunges and tries to kill it. It finally takes off just as the father \"T. rex\" bites the pterosaur's foot, though the pterosaur manages to break free of his jaws by pecking at his eye. Only one \"T. rex\" hatchling survives the carnage.\n\nAfter a \"T. rex\" attacks an \"Ankylosaurus\" before being driven off, a male \"Triceratops\" loses a fight for mating rights against another male \"Triceratops\". Two \"T.rex\" hear the commotion and close in to hunt the loser. Working together, they bring down the \"Triceratops\". In Mongolia a herd of \"Charonosaurus\" is drinking at a watering hole in an oasis. A \"Saurornithoides\" steals an egg from a nest and flees, but the enraged mother follows the raptor into a cave. It tries to eat the egg, but the mother arrives, bellowing before the raptor's partner appears, and the \"Charonosaurus\" flees, with the \"Saurornithoides\" pair racing after it. They manage to bring down the \"Charonosaurus\" by tearing into its neck.\n\nMeanwhile, in what is today central Mexico, a herd of \"Alamosaurus\" is roaming the plains in search of food while a female lays her eggs without nesting, as a six-mile wide asteroid formed from the collision of two asteroids 100 million years earlier enters the Earth's atmosphere. The asteroid hits the Earth in the Gulf of Mexico, creating a massive explosion and sending debris into the air. The explosion heats the air temperature near the crash site to 600° F. Hundreds of \"Alamosaurus\" are burned alive. Two minutes after impact, seismic shock waves trigger an 11.1 earthquake, which, combined with a second heat wave from the impact, wipes out the remaining \"Alamosaurus\". Most of their eggs are destroyed but some survive, buried under the cool soil.\n\nThe effects of the collision begin to affect the animals in British Columbia, with the 11.1 magnitude earthquake rippling through the valley. Falling debris litters the ground and drive animals from the valley. Several \"Triceratops\" and \"Ankylosaurus\" are engulfed by a 300° ejecta cloud and burnt to death. Fifteen minutes after impact, the ejecta cloud has spread to the Pacific Northwest and threatens to in-circulate the entire planet in ash. A pair of \"Quetzalcoatlus\" tries to fly away, but pieces of flaming debris shower the valley. Suffering from burnt wings, the male pterosaur falls from the sky to his death. After trying to save her mate, the also wounded female is forced to land in the valley. The effects of the ejecta also caused lightning storms to strike the valley.\n\nThe soaring temperatures create high humidity in the valley and force the \"Triceratops\" to keep moving. Many of the dead dinosaurs provide plentiful food for the hungry \"Tyrannosaurus\". The debris create massive fires that devastate forests of the Pacific Northwest. In the valley, the air pressure plummets, creating a vacuum that sucks in the raging flames and ignites a firestorm, causing temperatures in the valley to reaches 1800° F. The female \"Quetzalcoatlus\" stands over her mate's body but panics when the vegetation around her ignites. She manages to take off despite her tattered wings, leaving the dead male behind. Smaller animals hide underground while the larger animals are forced to flee.\n\nIn Mongolia, forty-five minutes since the impact, the ejecta cloud rolls in from the east, increasing the temperature around Mongolia by several degrees every second until it reaches 300°, causing three \"Charonosaurus\" and a pair of \"Saurornithoides\" to use a cave for shelter (unenthusiastically with each other as well). The temperatures return to normal after five hours, and the \"Saurornithoides\" run outside to feast on a \"Charonosaurus\" corpse, while two of the surviving \"Charonosaurus\" travel to the watering hole. The third stays behind. Soon the ejecta cloud causes a sandstorm, suffocating the two \"Charonosaurus\" alive. The pair of \"Saurornithoides\" survive by hiding behind their prey, while the third \"Charonosaurus\" remains in the cave. A day passes, and the \"Saurornithoides\" return to the watering hole, where the last \"Charonosaurus\" is drinking. The \"Saurornithoides\" are desperately hungry, yet are weak from their ordeal. One of them recklessly attacks the \"Charonosaurus\", but the hadrosaur collapses on top of it, killing it in the process. The remaining \"Saurornithoides\" resorts to eating the corpse of its companion.\n\nFour days since impact, food is in short supply across the entire planet. In the Pacific Northwest, four \"Triceratops\" head towards an island in search of food. The earthquake caused by the impact event forms a huge megatsunami, but also causes the water to recede and form a land bridge to the island. Three of the \"Triceratops\" cross the land bridge to the island. The female \"Quetzalcoatlus\" lands, where she eats a stranded fish, just as the megatsunami builds and races towards the shore. The \"Quetzalcoatlus\" attempts to take off but is caught into the vast wave and drowns, with the wave subsequently drowning the three \"Triceratops\" as well.\n\nTen days have passed since impact, and few dinosaurs remain. In Mongolia, the \"Charonosaurus\" stays close to the watering hole, but collapses and dies from inhaling hydrogen sulfide that rose from the watering hole. The \"Saurornithoides\" runs up to the dead \"Charonosaurus\", but it too is killed by the poisonous gas. \n\nA month and a half later, in the Pacific Northwest, a handful of dinosaurs patrol the wasteland. A starving but weak \"Ankylosaurus\" finds a small bush, but it’s almost forced to fight over it when a wandering \"Triceratops\" appears, until the \"Tyrannosaurus\" arrives. The \"Tyrannosaurus\" loses an eye to his prey's horn, but he manages to break off one of its horns and kills it by simply lunging and biting down hard on the neck. The \"Tyrannosaurus\" then turns his attention to the \"Ankylosaurus\" and after being struck in the right leg, flips it over and rips out its throat. He heads back to the dead \"Triceratops\", but trips over the \"Ankylosaurus\" and is impaled through the neck on the \"Triceratops's\" remaining horn. In Mexico, an \"Alamosaurus\" baby emerges from an egg that was sheltered away in the ground. All around the world, small handfuls of dinosaurs try to start over, but their species are beyond hope for replenishing their numbers. In the end, inbreeding, disease, and starvation will wipe out their populations until a single \"Alamosaurus\" remains, only to die in the wasteland too, and it only took 160 million years to bring the dinosaurs to this catastrophic point in their evolution.\n\nBut life on Earth was not completely destroyed: fish and crocodiles surviving underwater; small mammals, snakes, insects, arachnids, and lizards hid underground; birds flew or swam away from the disaster. Three years pass before sunlight finally reaches the planet again, and plant life finally carpets the Earth again, setting the stage for a new era: the era of mammals. Mammals now multiply and diversify, with countless species of mammals evolving, until 10,000 species explode across the planet and one species, humans, eventually rule the planet like the dinosaurs once had.\n\n\n\n"}

Although some modern histories have accorded Margaret the title \"Princess of Wales\", there is no contemporary record that Margaret used either that title or her husband's earlier title of Prince of Powys. \"Princess of Wales\", an English honorific given to the wife of the English prince of Wales, was first used by Joan of Kent. Only one wife of a Welsh prince is known to have used the title: Eleanor de Montfort, wife of Llywelyn ap Gruffudd, the last Prince of Wales.\n\nNothing is known of Margaret's early life, not even the precise date of her marriage. She was the daughter of Sir David Hanmer and his wife Angharad ferch Llywelyn Ddu, and was probably raised in a Welsh household. Her father taught Owain Glyndwr when the latter studied law; it is not known when Margaret married Owain, although it is thought that their wedding may have taken place in 1383 in the church of St Chad's in Hanmer. The number of children she bore, and the dates of their births, are likewise uncertain.\n\nThe poet Iolo Goch praises Margaret and her generosity in his poem \"Llys Owain Glyndŵr yn Sycharth\", one of three he composed in Owain's honour.\n\n\"A gwraig orau o’r gwragedd, \n\"Gwyn fy myd o’i gwin a’i medd!\n\"Merch eglur llin marchoglyw,\n\"Urddol hael anional yw;\n\"A’i blant a ddeuant bob ddau,\n\"Nythaid teg o benaethau.\"\n\nAnd the best of wives,\nBlessed am I in her wine and mead!\nA fine lady of knightly line,\nMost generous by nature;\nHer children come in two by two,\nA beautiful nest of chieftains.\n\nMargaret had three brothers, Gruffydd, Philip and John, all of whom supported Glyndŵr when he formally assumed his ancestral title of Prince of Powys in 1400. The Hamners were still with Owain when a Welsh parliament proclaimed the latter Prince of Wales at Machynlleth in 1404.\n\nMargaret's husband held estates at Sycharth, Glyndyfrdwy, and elsewhere in North Wales. According to Sir John E. Lloyd, Margaret bore her husband five sons and four or five daughters. One daughter, Catrin, married Edmund Mortimer, son of the Earl of March and brother-in-law of the famous Harry Hotspur, who had been taken prisoner at the battle of Bryn Glas in 1402; when forbidden by the King to exercise his right to ransom himself, Sir Edmund allied himself with Glyndŵr.

{"id": "43437541", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=43437541", "title": "Murder of Holly Bobo", "text": "Murder of Holly Bobo\n\nHolly Lynn Bobo (October 12, 1990 – c. April 13, 2011) was an American woman who disappeared on April 13, 2011, from her family home in Darden, Tennessee. Bobo was last seen alive by her brother, Clint, shortly before 8 a.m., walking into the woods outside her home with a man wearing camouflage. In September 2014, partial remains were found in northern Decatur County, and her death was ruled a homicide via a gunshot to the back of the head. Bobo was the cousin of singer Whitney Duncan.\n\nSix men have been arrested for varying degrees of involvement in the crime. However, only three of the six have been prosecuted. Most of the arrests were made on the basis of a confession by a man with an intellectual disability named John Dylan Adams, who told police he saw his brother, Zach, and another friend, Jason Autry, with Holly at his brother's home after her kidnapping. It is unknown what led police to question Dylan about Bobo's disappearance. Dylan, Zach, and Autry were charged with especially aggravated kidnapping, first-degree murder and rape. Of the other three men arrested, charges against two men were dropped, and one committed suicide without any charges being filed against him.\n\nThe case has been met with several setbacks such as the death of a suspect, multiple changes to the prosecutorial team, and disputes with the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation (TBI). The prosecution has been heavily criticized for its refusal to produce evidence against the defendants, missing multiple discovery deadlines, and for making frequent changes to the charges against the defendants with little explanation. The TBI even briefly withdrew its services to the entire district after the prosecutor accused it of compromising the case by proceeding \"so slowly that the culprits were always one step ahead and that TBI... was leaking information and possibly covering up evidence.\" Defense attorneys for the men said they still had yet to receive a bill of particulars detailing the case against their clients and the results of forensic testing done on evidence from the case over a year after the arrests were made, and filed motions to dismiss charges on the grounds of \"silence or stonewalling.\" The arrests took place in early 2014, but it wasn't until July 2015 that it was announced that the defendants finally received access to all the evidence against them.\n\nOn September 22, 2017, a jury found Zach guilty on all charges, including first-degree murder. He was sentenced to life in prison plus 50 years on September 23. He maintains his innocence. In January 2018, Zach's brother, Dylan, accepted an Alford plea and he was sentenced to 35 years in prison.\n\nAt the time of her disappearance, Holly Bobo was a 20-year-old nursing student in the Licensed Practical Nurse program at the University of Tennessee at Martin Parsons Center in Parsons, living with her parents and brother in Darden. Friends described her as shy and sweet. She was the cousin of country singer Whitney Duncan. In 2017, Duncan released a song called \"Better Place\" in memory of Holly.\n\nA timeline of events on the morning of April 13, 2011, is given below, on the basis of witness statements and reported phone records:\n\nClint described the man as being between 5′10″ and 6 feet tall (1.78–1.80 m), weighing and having dark hair sticking out from under his cap that was long enough to cover his neck and touch his collar. Clint said the man was wearing a hat and camouflage clothing from head to toe and identified the pattern as either Mossy Oak break up or leafy wear. He described the male voice he heard as a very deep and low.\n\nExtensive searches of the area were conducted following Bobo's disappearance. Several items belonging to Bobo were found scattered throughout the town, including her lunchbox, a receipt with her name on it, a card from school, her cell phone, and the SIM card, which had been removed from it.\n\nEarly in the investigation, the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation (TBI) focused heavily on a registered sex offender who matched the witness description named Terry Britt. His home was wire-tapped and searched during the course of the investigation, but he was never charged.\n\nIn September 2014, Bobo's partial remains were found by ginseng hunters in a wooded area of northern Decatur County, Tennessee, just off of I-40, nearly 20 miles (32 km) from Darden.\nThe owner of the property said it was not uncommon for people to hunt there without permission. One of the men who found the remains said he saw a large bucket in the woods, which he upturned. Details of the contents have not been released. He then spotted Bobo's remains spread on the ground behind him. Investigators recovered her skull, teeth, several ribs, and one shoulder blade. Her skull had a bullet hole in the back of it on the right with the trajectory going left, fracturing her left cheek bone when it exited.\n\nA total of six men have been implicated in connection with Bobo's disappearance, with the first of the arrests occurring in March 2014, prior to the discovery of Holly's remains. Zach Adams, his brother Dylan Adams, and friend Jason Autry were ultimately charged with especially aggravated kidnapping, first-degree murder, and rape. Another two men, Jeffrey and Mark Pearcy, were arrested on charges of accessory after the fact and tampering with evidence; however charges against the Pearcy brothers were dropped. Another man, Shayne Austin, committed suicide.\n\nIt is unclear what initially led law enforcement to suspect these men, but the investigation began with the arrest of Dylan Adams on unrelated weapons charges. Following this arrest, he told police that he witnessed Bobo alive with his brother at Zach's home following her abduction. An affidavit for a search warrant states that Dylan told authorities that on April 13, 2011, he went to Zach's residence to get his truck. Dylan reportedly \"observed Holly Lynn Bobo sitting in a green chair in the living room wearing a pink t-shirt, with Jason Wayne Autry standing just a few feet away.\" He also told police Zach was \"wearing camouflage shorts, black cut-off-sleeve t-shirt and a pair of green Crocs\" shoes. Dylan also said that Zach told him \"he had raped Bobo and videotaped it.\" The alleged videotape has not been found. Dylan later recanted the confession and alleged that he was coerced, but his confession led to the arrests of Zach Adams, Jason Autry, and Shayne Austin. Many of the details contained in the confession were eventually found to be inconsistent with the known evidence, and the narrative presented later in court was vastly different. In early 2017, it was announced that Jason Autry had agreed to testify against Zach in exchange for leniency.\n\nIn 2014, District Attorney Matt Stowe said he and the TBI were still \"actively looking\" to bring criminal charges against additional people, although he declined to name the parties or the charges.\n\nShayne Kyle Austin was initially offered immunity in exchange for information regarding the location of Bobo's body. Phone records indicate that Austin was in contact with Adams several times on the day of Bobo's abduction and police believed that Austin helped dispose of the body. The agreement was withdrawn after Austin was unable or unwilling to lead them to the body and the district attorney released a statement saying that Austin \"has not been completely truthful, forthcoming and cooperative as to any and all aspects of this investigation.\" In April, Austin's attorney filed a complaint against the State asking for an immediate and permanent injunction preventing the state from charging Austin. Austin was found deceased in February 2015 in Bartow, Florida of an apparent suicide. Austin's attorney blamed the suicide on the continual threats of prosecution as well as the \"witch hunt\" style of investigation, where they relied on rumors instead of evidence. His attorney insists he had nothing to do with the murder and cooperated fully with police.\n\nIn July 2014, Jeffrey Pearcy and his brother Mark Pearcy were arrested and charged with accessory after the fact and tampering with evidence. They were arrested on the basis of allegations made by Jeff's former roommate Sandra King, who alleged that in May 2014, Jeff showed her part of a video showing Adams assaulting Bobo, who was tied up and crying. She told police that she watched only a small clip and did not see the sexual assault. Police arranged for King to make a recorded call to Jeff where she told him over the phone \"That video of Holly, if it had been you, I would have watched it,\" to which he replied, \"I know.\" King alleges that Pearcy's brother Mark shot the video.\n\nBoth brothers deny that a video existed and Jeff Pearcy denies knowing the other men who have been arrested for the crime. Jeff claims that he was unable to hear Sandra during the phone conversation and that his ex-wife's name is also Holly. Police have analyzed over 20 phones but have not found any video. Charges against both men were subsequently dropped and the narrative described at Zach Adams's trial did not include any mention of involvement by the Pearcy brothers.\n\nIn September 2017, Zach Adams was the first to go on trial. The prosecution's case was largely circumstantial, as there was no DNA or other forensic evidence tying Zach to the murder. Jason Autry, the state's key witness, testified to a series of events that was drastically different from Dylan's confession. He testified that he himself was not involved in the abduction but that he went to Shayne Austin's home to buy drugs where he saw Zach, Dylan, and Shayne disposing of evidence from the crime. He said Zach had a body in the back of his truck wrapped up in a multi-colored blanket and Shayne was disposing of evidence in a burn barrel.\n\nAccording to Jason Autry, he agreed to help Zach dispose of the body. They drove to a spot along the Tennessee River with plans to \"gut\" her so she didn't float to the top. After unloading her body from the bed of the truck, they realized she was still alive, so Zach shot her in the back of the head. Fearing that the noise of the gunshot might have attracted attention, they loaded her body back into the truck and Zach dropped Jason off. Autry testified that Zach later said that he'd dumped the body near a place called Kelly Ridge. (Her remains were found in a different location and it is unclear how the body ended up where it was ultimately found.)\n\nThe narrative presented at trial is that Zach, Shayne, and Dylan went to the Bobo residence to teach Clint Bobo to make meth, an allegation that Clint denies. Holly came out of the home \"screaming and hollering\" and that is when the men abducted her. The prosecution alleged that Shayne Austin was the man that Clint described as walking into the woods with Holly, as he is the only one who was close to the size of the man he described. The three men are alleged to have raped Holly in a local barn owned by the grandmother of both Shayne Austin and Jason Autry.\n\nTwo pieces of paper belonging to Holly, a receipt and a note card, were found on the road where Shayne Austin lived. The receipt was found 75 feet from Austin's driveway.\n\nThe prosecution also presented other pieces of circumstantial evidence linking Zach to the murder, including that he drove a white truck; a neighbor of the Bobo family had seen a white truck driving rapidly the morning of the murder. A number of other witnesses testified that Zach made statements implicating himself in her disappearance. Zach's then-girlfriend, Rebecca Earp, testified that \"He said he would tie me up just like he did Holly Bobo and nobody would ever see me again.\" He also allegedly threatened Dylan after his arrest that he would \"put him in a hole beside her\" if he didn't keep his mouth shut.\n\nA gun, listed as an Arminus model HW5, 32 caliber Smith & Wesson long revolver was introduced into evidence by the prosecution. A local man, Victor Dinsmore, led police to the gun, claiming that Shayne Austin and Jason Autry sold him the weapon in exchange for drugs. It was reportedly found under water. Forensic tests on the weapon failed to find any DNA or fingerprints on the weapon and prosecutors were unable to link the gun to the case with ballistics tests\n\nOn September 22, 2017, a jury found Zach Adams guilty on all charges, including first-degree murder, especially aggravated kidnapping, and aggravated rape. On September 23, 2017, he was sentenced to life in prison without parole and two consecutive terms of 25 years for both the kidnapping and rape convictions.\n\nOn January 18, 2018, John Dylan Adams pled guilty to charges of facilitation of first-degree murder and especially aggravated kidnapping. He was sentenced to 15 years for facilitation of first-degree murder and 35 years for especially aggravated kidnapping. Those sentences are set to run concurrently, meaning he will serve 35 years without parole. Dylan entered an Alford plea, a type of guilty plea where the defendant does not admit to the criminal act and maintains his innocence but concedes that the prosecution's case may result in a guilty verdict.\n\nDespite confessions from Autry, Austin, and Dylan Adams, all men arrested for the crime have vehemently denied involvement in the disappearance at some point and have accused the state of coercive tactics. Early in the case, Autry claimed that investigators tried to get him to testify falsely against Zach Adams. The family of Dylan Adams, who is mentally disabled, claimed that \"[T]hey kept him up all night, would not give him anything to eat or drink and finally he said, 'What do you want me to say? According to family members, Dylan has some ability to read but cannot perform other tasks such as telling time, and they believe that Dylan is being manipulated.\n\nAt the trial for Zach, it was alleged that the state used unethical investigatory techniques to coerce a confession from Dylan. In 2014, Dylan was arrested on federal gun charges that would have ended in a lengthy prison sentence. The prosecutor, who was also handling the Bobo case, arranged a no-jail plea deal on the condition that he go live with a retired police officer, Dennis Benjamin, whom Dylan did not know. Five weeks later, Benjamin called 911 to report that he had someone in his home that wanted to confess to the murder of Holly Bobo. Despite the fact that this confession led to the arrests, much of what he confessed to did not match the evidence.\n\nDylan's mother claims that there was extensive coercion in his interrogation: \"In this statement Dylan is trying to tell his story as to what happened, and you've got this TBI agent saying, 'Don't you mean this? Don't you mean it happened like this?' And, 'No, Dylan, it went down like this.' And you can honestly tell at [that] point that Dylan, I can as his mother, he gave up. He's like, 'OK, if that's what you said, OK, Cindy Adams said.\n\nJeffrey Pearcy also claims the statements regarding his involvement were fabricated by King to assist her son, who has been in prison for 14 years and has 24 years left on his sentence. \"I have been up front and honest about everything. I have willingly given them everything. Take it, I mean, it's there,\" he said. \"My heart goes out to the Bobo family. It could have very well been one of my kids. For someone to give them false hope, and that's exactly what's been done to them,\" he said. \"But for the justice system to just haul someone in and destroy their whole life, I mean, there's no sense in that at all.\"\n\nAt Zach Adams's trial, his defense contended that he was \"100% innocent.\" The defense alleged that Jason Autry concocted a story in exchange for a reduced sentence and that although some of his story seemed to be corroborated he had access to all these details through discovery. They also pointed to the fact that cell phone pings do not follow the path that Holly's cell phone takes and that none of the men matched the witness description given by Clint Bobo. Zach, Dylan, and Jason were all too tall and were either too slim or too heavy to be the abductor. Shayne Austin was the correct weight and height, but Clint described a man with dark hair that covered his neck; Shayne had short red hair.\n\nFormer TBI agent Terry Dicus, who was the lead investigator on the case, testified for the defense. He told the jury that he ruled the men out early in the case because Shayne Austin passed a polygraph, their alibis checked out, and cell phone records put Zach and Holly several miles apart during the critical time frame. According to a defense expert, Zach's and Holly's cell phones were in separate sectors nearly the entire time frame of her abduction; the cell phones came into the same sector only at about 9:10 a.m., over an hour later. Dicus also noted that for Autry's story to fit with the cell phone pings, they would have to drive 106 miles per hour, a scenario that is unlikely on the winding gravel roads they traveled. The defense also noted that all four men had been ruled out as the originator of a palmprint found on Holly's car, while another suspect, Terry Britt, could not be excluded.\n\nZach's defense attorney, Jennifer Thompson, contends that the initial suspect in the case, Terry Britt, was the real killer, saying that he \"has never been cleared by the TBI and in fact it appears the government has more evidence of his guilt than it does of the three defendants charged in the present case.\"\n\nBritt is a convicted sex offender who has been convicted of three separate rapes and, , is serving time in prison for the 2008 kidnapping and attempted rape of another woman. It was argued at trial that Britt fit the physical description and had a history of stalking blond women. Clint Bobo also identified a voice sample of Britt's voice as being very similar to the voice he heard that morning.\n\nFormer TBI agent Terry Dicus testified that Britt had fabricated an alibi for that morning. Britt told investigators that his wife stayed home from work that morning to help him install a bathtub. Through the investigation, Dicus discovered that his wife, Janet, had gone to work that morning but Terry called and made her leave \"on the biggest news day\" of the county's history. The Britts did produce a handwritten receipt for the bathtub, but the store had no record of the sale. According to Dicus, Britt's wife had been with him on previous occasions where Britt had stalked girls. Britt also could not be excluded as the contributor of the handprint. He also testified that following Holly's abduction, Terry Britt allegedly changed his appearance by cutting his hair.\n\nA U.S. Marshals senior inspector testified that at one point, Britt said, \"Sounds like you have it all figured out,\" and said he would \"plead to it,\" but did not clarify specific charges or conditions for a plea deal.\n\nThe criminal case against the men charged has been met with strong criticism and conflict between members of the prosecution, complicating the investigation. District Attorney Matt Stowe was elected to office in the summer of 2014 following the arrests and stated that he believes he was elected in part due to skepticism regarding the arrests and questions over whether enough evidence exists against them to obtain a conviction. \"[Voters] wanted another set of eyes on this Holly Bobo case; they weren't happy with everything that was coming out of there, and I think that they wanted someone else to take a look and someone else to say, 'We know what's going on.\n\nIn the fall of 2014, Jason Autry's attorney, John Herbison, accused the prosecutor of arresting the defendants without probable cause as an unethical \"investigatory technique,\" then adding and dropping charges strategically before hearings to avoid having to produce evidence against the defendants. In October 2014, when evidence tampering charges were dropped against Dylan Adams just days after he was charged with rape, Herbison said: \"If those reports are correct, it means that they're just playing games,\" Herbison said. \"They charged him with something less serious in order to keep him locked up, and then when it comes time to answer questions about the charge, they dismiss that and charge him with a more serious charge in circuit court, where he's not entitled to a preliminary hearing.\"\n\nHe also noted the state's similar treatment of Mark Pearcy to avoid hearings. In August 2014, the state failed to arrange transport for Pearcy to the courthouse causing the hearing to be rescheduled for September, but just prior to the new hearing the charges against him were dropped with the explanation given that Pearcy was facing unrelated federal charges and they were being forced to wait to proceed with the state charges. Herbison said the laws regarding the charges would not preclude the state charges. \"If the state is claiming that is the case, the prosecutor is either ill-informed or being disingenuous,\" he said. Charges were never reinstated and the case against his brother, Jeff, was similarly dropped.\n\nZach Adams's attorney, Jennifer Thompson, repeatedly said that evidence wasn't turned over to the defense. For example, in 2014, DA Matt Stowe made a statement that because Holly was menstruating at the time of her abduction there was a lot of DNA evidence in Zachary Adams's Decatur County home. No DNA evidence was ever turned over to the defense or produced at trial. She also said that the medical examiner referred to materials that were never given to her.\n\nOn December 17, 2014, nine months after Zach Adams's arrest, Judge Creed McGinley chastised prosecutors for delays in the case and for the state's failure to turn over evidence to the defense. \"I am absolutely out of patience with these cases not moving,\" he said. Judge McGinley ordered that a bill of particulars be filed for Zachary Adams's case within seven days and that discovery take place immediately. The prosecution ignored both deadlines. In response, attorneys for the men filed motions to dismiss charges. The motions filed accused the state of \"silence or stonewalling,\" stating that, among other things, the state had yet to disclose evidence that the skull found belonged to Bobo. \"It would appear to me if they had a skull with a dental match they would have given that to us right away. It's a little suspicious why we don't have that forensic information,\" said Autry's attorney Fletcher Long.\n\nFollowing the hearing in December 2014, a dispute regarding the handling of the case led the TBI to briefly drop its investigation of the case and cut ties with the entire district, saying District Attorney Matt Stowe had accused them of misconduct. The TBI agreed to come back on the case after Stowe recused himself from the case and Jennifer Nichols was appointed as special prosecutor. Following Stowe's allegations of misconduct by the TBI, the defense attorneys working on the case stated that they intended to subpoena Stowe to question him regarding the alleged misconduct. Emails by Wally Kirby, Executive Director of Tennessee District Attorney's Conference, revealed that Stowe accused TBI of compromising the case by proceeding \"so slowly that the culprits were always one step ahead and that TBI...was leaking information and possibly covering up evidence.\"\n\nThe case attracted a high level of national media coverage. Discovery Channel published an article several months after her disappearance, discussing how the high levels of media coverage, including some instances of inaccurate media coverage, hurt the investigation. A notable example of misinformation was the description of her last known movements. Early reports inaccurately reported that Bobo was dragged into the woods. Clint later clarified that Holly had, in fact, walked with the man wearing camouflage into the woods, either willingly or by coercion. This clarification led to rumors that Clint had changed his story and was a suspect in his sister's disappearance. Whitney Duncan defended him in an April 17 Twitter statement, stating that he was innocent and not a suspect in the case. Some early sources also erroneously reported that the skull was found on property owned by Zach Adams's family. Her body was found 10 miles away from Adams's property on land owned by the Tubbs family.\n\nPolice received scores of erroneous tips from the public, including a number of \"psychics,\" making it difficult for police to identify important leads.\n\nOn Friday night September 29, 2017, the ABC network aired an investigative journalism segment, \"Justice for Holly Bobo,\" on its prime-time television program 20/20.\n"}
{"id": "22672118", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=22672118", "title": "Occupational burnout", "text": "Occupational burnout\n\nOccupational burnout is thought to result from long-term, unresolvable, job stress. In 1974, Herbert Freudenberger became the first researcher to publish in a \"psychology\"-related journal a paper that used the term \"burnout\". The paper was based on his observations of the volunteer staff (including himself) at a free clinic for drug addicts. He characterized burnout by a set of symptoms that includes exhaustion resulting from work's excessive demands as well as physical symptoms such as headaches and sleeplessness, \"quickness to anger\" and closed thinking. He observed that the burned-out worker \"looks, acts, and seems depressed\". After the publication of Freudenberger's original paper, interest in occupational burnout grew. Because the phrase \"burnt-out\" was part of the title of a 1961 Graham Greene novel, \"A Burnt-Out Case\", which dealt with a doctor working in the Belgian Congo with patients who had leprosy, the phrase may have been in use outside the psychology literature before Freudenberger employed it.\n\nIn order to study burnout, a number of researchers developed more focused conceptualizations of burnout. In one conceptualization, job-related burnout is characterized by emotional exhaustion, depersonalization (treating clients/students and colleagues in a cynical way), and reduced feelings of work-related personal accomplishment. In another conceptualization, burnout is thought to comprise emotional exhaustion, physical fatigue, and cognitive weariness. A third conceptualization holds that burnout consists of exhaustion and disengagement. The core of the three conceptualizations, as well as Freudenberger's, is exhaustion. Long limited to these dimensions, burnout is now known to involve the full array of depressive symptoms (e.g., low mood, cognitive alterations, sleep disturbance).\n\nOriginally, Maslach and her colleagues focused on burnout within human service professions (e.g., teachers, social workers). She later expanded the application of burnout to include individuals in many other occupations.\n\nBurnout is not recognized as a distinct disorder in the DSM-5. It is included in the ICD-10, but not as a disorder. It can be found in the ICD under problems related to life-management difficulty (Z73).\n\nIn 1981, Christina Maslach and Susan Jackson developed the first widely used instrument for assessing burnout, namely, the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI). Consistent with Maslach's conceptualization, the MBI operationalizes burnout as a three-dimensional syndrome consisting of emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and reduced personal accomplishment. Other researchers have argued that burnout should be limited to fatigue and exhaustion.\n\nA growing body of evidence suggests that burnout is etiologically, clinically, and nosologically similar to depression. In a study that directly compared depressive symptoms in burned out workers and clinically depressed patients, no diagnostically significant differences were found between the two groups; burned out workers reported as many depressive symptoms as clinically depressed patients. Moreover, a study by Bianchi, Schonfeld, and Laurent (2014) showed that about 90% of workers with full-blown burnout meet diagnostic criteria for depression. The view that burnout is a form of depression has found support in several recent studies.\n\nEvidence suggests that the etiology of burnout is multifactorial, with dispositional factors playing an important, long-overlooked role. Cognitive dispositional factors implicated in depression have also been found to be implicated in burnout. One cause of burnout includes stressors that a person is unable to cope with fully. Occupational burnout often develops slowly and may not be recognized until it has become severe. When one's expectations about a job and its reality differ, burnout can begin.\n\nBurnout is thought to occur when a mismatch is present between the nature of the job and the person doing the job. A common indication of this mismatch is work overload, which sometimes involves a worker who survives a round of layoffs, but after the layoffs the worker finds that he or she is doing too much with too few resources. Overload may occur in the context of downsizing, which often does not narrow an organization's goals, but requires fewer employees to meet those goals.\n\nThe job demands-resources model has implications for burnout, as measured by the Oldenburg Burnout Inventory (OLBI). Physical and psychological job demands were concurrently associated with the exhaustion, as measured by the OLBI. Lack of job resources was associated with the disengagement component of the OLBI.\n\nMaslach, Schaufeli and Leiter identified six risk factors for burnout: mismatch in workload, mismatch in control, lack of appropriate awards, loss of a sense of positive connection with others in the workplace, perceived lack of fairness, and conflict between values.\n\nBurnout is supposed to be a work-specific syndrome. However, this restrictive view of burnout's scope has been shown to be groundless. In other words, burnout could apply to nonwork roles such as that of caregiver or student.\n\nSome research indicates that burnout is associated with reduced job performance, coronary heart disease, and mental health problems (although note the abovementioned research that suggests it is a depressive syndrome, e.g., Ahola et al., 2005). Chronic burnout is also associated with cognitive impairments such as memory and attention. Occupational burnout is also associated with absences, time missed from work, and thoughts of quitting.\n\nIt is difficult to treat the three symptoms of exhaustion, cynicism, and inefficacy, as they react to the same preventive or treatment activities in different ways. Exhaustion is more easily treated than cynicism and professional inefficacy, which tend to be more resistant to treatment. Research shows that intervention actually may worsen the professional efficacy of one who originally had low professional efficacy.\n\nFor the purpose of preventing occupational burnout, various stress management interventions have been shown to help improve employee health and well-being in the workplace and lower stress levels. Training employees in ways to manage stress in the workplace have also proven effective in prevention of burnout. One study suggest that social-cognitive processes such as commitment to work, self-efficacy, learned resourcefulness and hope may insulate individuals from experiencing occupational burnout. Increased job control is another intervention shown to help counteract exhaustion and cynicism in the workplace.\n\nBurnout prevention programs have traditionally focused on cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), cognitive restructuring, didactic stress management, and relaxation. CBT, relaxation techniques (including physical techniques and mental techniques), and schedule changes are the best-supported techniques for reducing and preventing burnout in a health-care specific setting. Combining both organizational and individual level activities may be the most beneficial approach to reduce symptoms. A Cochrane review reported that evidence for the efficacy of CBT in healthcare workers is of low quality, indicating that it is no better than alternative interventions.\n\nEmployee rehabilitation is a tertiary preventive intervention which means the strategies used in rehabilitation are meant to alleviate, as well as prevent, burnout symptoms. Such rehabilitation of the working population includes multidisciplinary activities with the intent of maintaining and improving employees' working ability and ensuring a supply of skilled and capable labor in society.\n\nAdditional prevention methods include: starting the day with a relaxing ritual; adopting healthy eating, exercising, and sleeping habits; setting boundaries; taking breaks from technology; nourishing one's creative side, and learning how to manage stress.\n\nWhile individuals can cope with the symptoms of burnout, the only way to truly prevent burnout is through a combination of organizational change and education for the individual.\n\nMaslach and Leiter postulated that burnout occurs when there is a disconnection between the organization and the individual with regard to what they called the six areas of work life: workload, control, reward, community, fairness, and values. Resolving these discrepancies requires integrated action on the part of both the individual and the organization. A better connection on workload means assuring adequate resources to meet demands as well as work/life balances that encourage employees to revitalize their energy. A better connection on values means clear organizational values to which employees can feel committed. A better connection on community means supportive leadership and relationships with colleagues rather than discord.\n\nOne approach for addressing these discrepancies focuses specifically on the fairness area. In one study employees met weekly to discuss and attempt to resolve perceived inequities in their job.

Whilst on the books of Abercorn, he made his solitary international appearance for Scotland on 21 March 1891 scoring in a 4–3 victory over Wales.\n\nHe then moved to England to join the short-lived Sunderland Albion.\n\nAfter Sunderland Albion disbanded in May 1892, he transferred to Burnley, playing in the Football League First Division. In his first season he was top scorer (jointly with Billy Bowes) with eight goals from 22 appearances, helping Burnley to finish in sixth place, their highest league finish to date. The following season, Buchanan was less successful in front of goal with only four goals from his 18 appearances, but Burnley finished the season one place higher in the league table.\n\nIn September 1894 he moved to join Woolwich Arsenal, for 1894–95, their second season in the Football League Second Division. Playing alongside Peter Mortimer and Paddy O'Brien, he contributed nine goals from his 25 appearances, which included a goal on his debut, in Arsenal's 4–2 win over Manchester City on 29 September 1894. The following season he made 17 appearances with seven goals, switching from centre forward to inside left. In total he scored 16 goals in 44 league and cup appearances for Arsenal.\n\nHe moved to the south coast in the summer of 1896 to join Southern League team Southampton St. Mary's. The Southampton public took to him immediately and his \"\"never-give-up\" attitude earned him the nickname \"Death or Glory Bob\"\". In his first season with the \"Saints\" he was ever-present, scoring eleven league goals as Southampton took the Southern League title for the first time. He scored a hat trick in his second appearance, a 6–1 victory over Sheppey United on 26 September 1896. He also helped Southampton reach Round 2 of the FA Cup for the first time, where they went out to Newton Heath after a replay.\n\nThe following season, he was top-scorer with ten league and six FA Cup goals as the Saints again took the Southern League championship. Saints also had a superb run in the FA Cup reaching the semi final where they went out in a replay 2–0 to Nottingham Forest. In the cup run he scored \"unlikely goals\" against Leicester Fosse and Newcastle United.\n\nAlthough he remained with Southampton for the 1898–98 season, he only played twice. After 57 appearances for the Saints with 33 goals, he moved back to south-east London to join Sheppey United.\n\nOn retiring from the game, he settled in Sheerness, where he worked as an engine-fitter and died in Southwark in early 1909.\n\n"}
{"id": "42222494", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=42222494", "title": "Spirituality and homelessness", "text": "Spirituality and homelessness\n\nSpirituality affects both mental and physical health outcomes in the general United States population across different ethnic groups. Because of the nuanced definitions of spirituality and religiosity, the literature on spirituality is not consistent in definitions or measures resulting in a lack of coherence. However, taken as a whole, research tends to show that the effect of spirituality is positive, associated with better health outcomes. For those who engage in spirituality, it may serve as a buffer from negative life events, often moderating the relationship between negative life experiences and levels of anxiety or depression. The exception is when negative spiritual coping is practiced. This type of coping has negative health implications.\n\nThe homeless are a vulnerable population that experiences the moderating effect of spirituality; spirituality plays a role in their emotional and mental capacity to handle challenges they face and practice health-promoting behaviors. For the homeless who practice spirituality as a positive coping mechanism, it often improves their life and is cited as a source of strength and comfort in qualitative research.\n\nSpirituality does not have a clear definition, though it is generally regarded as the search for and experience of the sacred, meaning God, a higher power, or something of divine nature. Spirituality is characterized as something experienced personally, an individualized process that involves personal or private beliefs. However, it may involve the values of community and relationship, or an emphasis on the connectedness of people. Spirituality often emphasizes the integration of mind, body and spirit, and it can provide a sense of purpose or life significance.\n\nThere is considerable overlap in the definitions of religion and spirituality and, for this reason, they are often used interchangeably in the literature. Religion, like spirituality, can provide people a sense of purpose or meaning through personal beliefs. The main distinguishing factor between religion and spirituality is that religion is generally practiced collectively with some type of structural or institutional reinforcement. Both terms are multi-faceted and are typically measured along similar dimensions. Common dimensions of spirituality/religion as defined by the National Institute of Healthcare Research and NIA/Fetzer Institute are as follows:\n\n\nThese dimensions are simply two examples of measures used in the literature on spirituality. Because of the nebulous definition of spirituality in the literature, measures are not consistent across different studies resulting in a lack of coherence in the literature. However, there is a consensus in research done on spirituality that it influences health. This effect is generally positive with the exception of negative spiritual coping.\n\nSpiritual wellbeing has been associated with positive physical health outcomes in research. Spirituality reduces the likelihood of illness and is strongly related to increased longevity. For example, it lowers the rate of heart disease, cirrhosis, emphysema, stroke, kidney failure, cancer mortality, overall mortality. Spirituality also decreases blood pressure and cholesterol levels. If someone does become ill or must endure surgery, they are likely to endure a better recovery. These effects may vary depending on the strictness of behavioral codes associated with a religion, the intensity of the person's practice of spirituality, and whether or not their spiritual experience is a positive one. If someone uses negative spiritual coping, the positive health benefits will not happen and the individual's health may be influenced negatively (see religious/spiritual coping section).\n\nSpirituality tends to improve mental health. Spirituality is associated with lower rates of suicide, anxiety disorders, and depression. In regards to depression, individuals who are more spiritually involved are more likely to recover. In a review of forty-three studies, Rew and Wong (2006) found that religiosity and spirituality are important correlates of adolescent health with 84% of the literature indicating a positive correlation. Spirituality also reduces the likelihood of drug/alcohol dependency or abuse and is associated with a more effective recovery from abuse/dependence. While spirituality generally improves mental health, for individuals who use harmful forms of religious coping, spirituality is \"correlated with impaired mental health and poorer resolution of negative life events.\"\n\nThere are two types of spiritual coping, positive and negative. Positive spiritual coping manifests itself as a strong relationship with God, seeking support from the community and a higher power, looking for meaning in life and helping others. Most people who practice spirituality engage in positive spiritual coping which is associated with improved mental and physical health.\n\nNegative spiritual coping, a pattern distinct from positive spiritual coping, has negative health implications. Negative spiritual coping involves deferring all responsibility to God, feeling abandoned by God or blaming God for difficulties. It often manifests itself as a less secure relationship with God, an ominous worldview and general spiritual discontent. For those who engage in negative spiritual coping, it is related to significantly poorer physical and mental health outcomes as well as higher mortality. In a study done by Pargament (1998), negative spiritual coping had differing negative health implications among different populations. For citizens of Oklahoma City who experienced the federal building bombing, it was associated with more post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms and higher levels of callousness. For college students, negative spiritual coping was associated with higher levels of emotional distress and poorer physical health. For hospital patients with physical ailments, negative spiritual coping was associated with higher levels of depression and lower quality of life.\n\nA homeless person is an individual without a consistent, fixed nighttime residence or someone whose nighttime residence is a supervised shelter that provides temporary housing. Homelessness is a chronic stressor producing reduced wellbeing. Homeless populations are a vulnerable population experiencing a higher prevalence of mental and physical health problems as well as victimization and increased mortality rates. Spirituality is one method some homeless individuals use to cope with their position of high vulnerability. Runquist and Reed (2007) found that spiritual perspective correlated positively with measures of wellbeing among the sample of homeless individuals surveyed and that measures of wellbeing correlated positively with self-rated health status. Social capital resulting from spirituality or religion, according to Irwin (2008), is a critical factor to wellbeing among homeless populations. It increases the resource base of the individual enabling them to cope with their situation in healthier ways.\n\nYouth, typically defined as people between the ages of twelve and twenty-four, make up a large portion of the homeless population. As they are a transient population, it is difficult to get an accurate count of homeless youth; the number is commonly thought to be somewhere between 1.3 and 2 million. These youth have higher rates of mental health disorders, suicide, and drug/alcohol dependency due to the high amount of stressors in their lives.\n\nSpirituality is one of many coping mechanisms homeless youth employ in order to manage life on the streets as well as techniques such as avoidant coping, use of alcohol, interpersonal skills, problem-focused coping and self-reliance. Spirituality as a coping mechanism often serves as positive force in the lives of homeless youth. Kidd (2003) surveyed 80 street youth on the topic of coping and found that spirituality gave meaning to suffering, enabling the youth to process negative emotion and retain some hope. In interviews done by Lindsey et al. (2000), spirituality served as a resource to youth and empowered those engaged in spirituality to redirect their lives in a healthy manner. A theme across multiple studies the coping mechanisms of homeless youth is that their beliefs act as a source of strength and comfort; many attribute their ability to survive to the direct intervention of a higher power or to their faith. One individual in a group discussion conducted by Bender (2007) commented on his engagement with the divine as a source of comfort and survival saying, \"The man upstairs is what helps me. Just knowing that he's there. There may be times when I feel like he's not there, but he's helping me out slowly.\"\n\nThese positive effects of spirituality appear largely in qualitative work, meaning that the youth themselves associate spirituality with improved coping and better mental health. Youth who do not engage in spirituality thus do not use it as a coping mechanism and do not comment on it. There are no examples of negative religious coping among the youth in the studies cited. However, a quantitative study conducted by Kidd and Carroll revealed that spirituality was not associated with a lower suicide risk in homeless youth.\n\nFor homeless men, specifically those suffering from a substance abuse problem or who are in crisis, spirituality often serves as a positive coping mechanism, giving meaning to life and is tied to a sense of peace. However, positive spiritual coping lessens in its effectiveness the longer someone is homeless and is not as effective for homeless men with mental health problems as for those who are alcohol/drug dependent or in crisis. Many homeless men attribute their ability to get sober to their spirituality, though this may be a product of the spiritual nature of programs like Alcoholics Anonymous. In a study done by Brush and McGee (2000) surveying homeless men in a shelter for recovery, 78% of the respondents commented on how their spiritual views influence their decisions and two thirds agreed or strongly agreed \"to seeking spiritual guidance in daily life experiences.\"\n\nWomen are the fastest growing segment of the homeless population, making up an estimated 32% of the population. Many of these women are single mothers. African American women are disproportionately represented among homeless populations as a result of their increased vulnerability to socioeconomic structures. Homeless women, irrespective of ethnicity, tend to have more health problems than the general public including higher rates of substance abuse and mental health issues, as well as prior victimization.\n\nSpirituality is used as a coping mechanism by many women of various ethnicities to deal with the stress of being homeless and/or to recover from substance abuse. It serves as a source of emotional support as well as a motivating force for women to take care of themselves and their families in a healthy way. Many accredit God with their survival and ability to be clean, looking to their spirituality to guide them in parenting. In a study by Shuler (1994), 42% of homeless women surveyed said their beliefs gave them strength and helped them survive. For the women who considered prayer an effective coping mechanism, they experienced considerably less worries and depressive symptoms. Increased spirituality is associated with less substance abuse; for women who do not use drugs or alcohol, religious/moral beliefs are often the basis of their decision. Higher levels of spirituality is also associated with a lowered risk of depression and suicide among homeless women as well as increased health-promoting behaviors.\n\nResearch shows that African Americans as a population, especially women, tend to have higher levels of religious involvement and deep ties to faith and spirituality. This is the case for homeless African American women as well; spirituality plays a larger role as a coping mechanism for African American homeless women than other women. Douglas et al. (2008) found that homeless African American women placed a higher importance on spirituality and that lower rates of spiritual well-being among African American homeless mothers resulted in higher anxiety, increased trauma, punitive parenting and child behavioral issues. A study done by Washington et al. (2009) in which older African American homeless women were interviewed found that spirituality was an important asset for these women. Through their faith, they felt empowered to take control of their lives. These women's experience of spirituality also had a mediating effect on their worries and concerns.\n"}

The \"stochastic terrorist\" does not direct the actions of members of a group, rather, he is an ideologue speaking over mass media to individuals with who he is not affiliated as part of any form of organization. Instead, he depends on \"the use of mass media to provoke random acts of ideologically motivated violence that are statistically predictable but individually unpredictable\". According to an anonymous blogger posting on the Daily Kos, the speaker, whether intentionally or not, incites those with a combination of personality traits that leads them to violence. Since the speaker only focuses animus towards the victim instead of directly participating, they may escape culpability and the perpetrator may be labeled a lone wolf by law enforcement. The term has mostly been applied to domestic American incidents of violence.\n\nIn their 2017 book, Age of Lone Wolf Terrorism, criminologist Mark S. Hamm and sociologist Ramón Spaaij discuss stochastic terrorism as a form of \"indirect enabling\" of terrorists. They write that \"stochastic terrorism is the method of international recruitment used by ISIS\", and they refer to Anwar al-Awlaki and Alex Jones as stochastic terrorists. They note that:\n\nHamm and Spaaij discuss two instances of violence that \"shine a light on the phenomenon of stochastic terrorism in the post-9/11 era.\" In the 2010 Oakland freeway shootout, Byron Williams was said to be en route to offices of the American Civil Liberties Union and the Tides Foundation, planning to commit mass murder, \"indirectly enabled by the conspiracy theories\" of Glenn Beck and Alex Jones. As a left-wing example, they cite the 2012 shooting incident at the headquarters of the Family Research Council. Hamm and Spaaij say the shooter's radicalization was indirectly enabled by his reading a report in an online magazine of the Southern Poverty Law Center, which \"featured a 'Hate Map' giving the exact location of FRC headquarters.\"\n\nNote that the phrase \"stochastic terrorism model\" typically does not refer to this concept of stochastic terrorism as a form of incitement. That is, a stochastic terrorism model is usually a stochastic, that is, random, model of terror attacks intended by the random nature of their timing and targets to excite a generalized fear.\n\nAfter the 2011 Tucson shooting, the Daily Kos' \"diarist\" (blogger) G2geek posted \"Stochastic Terrorism: Triggering the shooters.\" While saying it wasn't immediately clear that the murderer Jared Lee Loughner was triggered, G2geek accused Osama Bin Laden and personalities such as Glenn Beck, Bill O'Reilly, and Sean Hannity of inciting perpetrators such as Jim David Adkisson, Scott Roeder, and Byron Williams. \"Rawstory\" said that the 2015 Colorado Springs Planned Parenthood shooting was incited by far-right Christians. An op-ed in \"Rolling Stone\" referred to then presidential-candidate Donald Trump's comment during one of his 2016 campaign rallies as stochastic terrorism. Trump said of his opponent Hillary Clinton: \"If she gets to pick her judges, nothing you can do folks. Although the Second Amendment people, maybe there is. I don't know\". \"Salon\" tied these comments to a history of encouragement of violence by O'Reilly and other right-wing media personalities.\n\nCNN's legal analyst Danny Cevallos opinion piece said Trump's comment was likely protected speech, even against a presidential candidate, because it wasn't directed to inciting imminent unlawful action. And with respect to it being stochastic terrorism added, \"It's scary, and probably true... It's hard to predict or measure the effect with any certainty.\"\n\nThe phase \"Scripted Violence\" has been used in social science since at least 2010. As Darrell Y. Hamamoto argues, the concept of \"scripted violence\" provides \"a sorely-needed corrective to the under-theorization of race and racism in understanding acts of scripted violence within hyper-militarized society.\" Hamamoto also suggests that \"serial killing and mass murder are examples of civilian \"blowback\" that originates with heightened US military adventurism in the postwar period.\nA stochastic terrorist is a demagogue who uses the rhetoric of scripted violence (such as demonization or scapegoating) to portray a target group as involved in a malevolent conspiracy to undermine the society or nation, and thus prompt most acts of stochastic terrorism. See, for example, the work on demonization and scapegoating of scholars Hannah Arendt and Gordon Allport.\n\n\n"}

It is a position held by some Gnostics in the first to third century, as well as some modern Mandaeans, Muslims and, many Japanese Christians .\n\nThe \"Book of Thomas the Contender\", a Gnostic text thought to have been written in the late second or the third century, cites Jesus as stating, when speaking to Thomas the Apostle, \"[I]t has been said that you are my twin and true companion.\". Additionally, the third century text \"Acts of Thomas\" (not to be confused with the Gospel of Thomas) contains an episode in which the risen Jesus appears \"in the likeness of\" Thomas the Apostle, and is subsequently mistaken for Thomas by a king. However, these early texts do not expressly put forward any sort of substitution hypothesis with respect to the death and resurrection of Jesus. \n\nThe \"Second Treatise of the Great Seth\", a Gnostic text from the third century, claims that Simon of Cyrene was crucified in the place of Jesus. The text is written from the first-person narrative perspective of Jesus, attributing to Jesus statements such as \"I was laughing at their ignorance\" when the crowd mistakenly crucifies Simon of Cyrene, and asserting that this deception was made possible because \"I [Jesus] was altering my shapes, changing from form to form.\"\n\nThe \"Gospel of Barnabas\" describes Jesus escaping crucifixion through being raised alive to heaven by a committee of holy angels; afterwards, Judas Iscariot is supernaturally transformed to look identical to Jesus, and is subsequently crucified in Jesus' place. Concerning its date of composition, few academics argue that the Gospel of Barnabas was composed any earlier than the 14th century, although a minority of scholars see it as containing portions of an earlier work.\n\nPaul William Roberts reports in his 1995 travel narrative \"\", that some contemporary Mandaeans hold that Thomas the Apostle was the twin brother of Jesus and was crucified in Jesus' place.\n\nThe etymology of \"Thomas\" with respect to Thomas the Apostle and the name Judas (distinct from Judas Iscariot) that he is given in various early texts and traditions is alluded to by some as evidence of Jesus having had a twin.\nMany Japanese christians believe Jesus had a brother named Isukiri who actually crucified on the cross.After surviving Crucifixion ,Jesus then went to Japan and died there. See: Shingō, Aomori\n\nA verse in the Qur'an saying of Jesus that \"they killed him not, nor crucified him, but so it was made to appear to them\" has been interpreted by many Muslims to mean that a different man who only appeared to be Jesus died in his place. Muslim scholars do not agree on the identity of the substitute, but he is often thought to have been one of the Apostles or Simon of Cyrene.\nMuslim scholar Ibn Abbas wrote that a Roman soldier named Tatianos crucified instead of Jesus in his Quranic commentary .\n\n\n\n"}

He had a substantial influence over 20th century-Arabian culture.\n\nTalal Maddah began his career emulating Hijazi singers such as Hassan Jawa and Mohammed Ali Sindi. During his career, he participated in many festivals in Saudi Arabia between 1960 and 2000. He also participated in many festivals in the Arab states of the Persian Gulf, Egypt, Syria, Lebanon, Algeria, Tunisia and Libya.\n\nMaddah was born in Mecca, Saudi Arabia. He was raised by his uncle.\n\nMaddah began singing in school concerts when he was student in Al-Taif. Abdul Rahman Khundaneh, one of Maddah's classmates, played the oud and became his accompanist. Since the two boys had to keep the oud at Maddah's house to hide it from Khundaneh's father, Maddah also learned to play the instrument.\n\nIn the mid-1950s, Maddah attended a wedding in Al-Taif that featured a selection of artists such as Tariq Abdul-Hakim, Abdullah Mohammed and Abdullah Morshidi. Maddah was astonished to see a concert with a full orchestra. At the concert, he was introduced to Abbas Fayegg Ghazzawi who was then a director at Radio Jeddah. Ghazzawi encouraged him to come to record his first songs. Maddah's first song is called \"Wardak Ya Zarea Al Ward\" (Grower of Roses, Arabic: وردك يا زارع الورد). The song was a success and was played on the radio daily in the mid-1950s.\n\nIn the 1960s, Talal Maddah became famous due to the birth of Saudi Arabia's official radio. Along with other artists like Muhammad Ali Sindi, Fawzi Mhasson and Abdullah Mohammed, he was one of the most popular singers of the era.\n\nGradually, his music was introduced to the rest of the Arab world after his songs were played in Cairo. Egyptian composers like Mohammed Abdel Wahab, Mohammed Al Mogy and Baligh Hamdi began to write songs for him. In 1976, he had his first pan-Arab hit with \"Muqadir\". Over the course of his long career, Maddah collaborated with many composers, including Ibrahim Raafat, Gamal Salama, Tariq Abdul Hakim, Abu Bakr Salem Belfkih, Sami Ihsan and Mohammed Shafiq.

{"id": "1886691", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1886691", "title": "Theory of Colours", "text": "Theory of Colours\n\nTheory of Colours (German: \"Zur Farbenlehre\") is a book by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe about the poet's views on the nature of colours and how these are perceived by humans. It was published in German in 1810 and in English in 1840. The book contains detailed descriptions of phenomena such as coloured shadows, refraction, and chromatic aberration.\n\nThe work originated in Goethe's occupation with painting and mainly exerted an influence on the arts (Philipp Otto Runge, J. M. W. Turner, the Pre-Raphaelites, Wassily Kandinsky). The book is a successor to two short essays entitled \"Contributions to Optics\".\n\nAlthough Goethe's work was rejected by physicists, a number of philosophers and physicists have concerned themselves with it, including Thomas Johann Seebeck, Arthur Schopenhauer (see: \"On Vision and Colors\"), Hermann von Helmholtz, Rudolf Steiner, Ludwig Wittgenstein, Werner Heisenberg, Kurt Gödel, and Mitchell Feigenbaum.\n\nGoethe's book provides a catalogue of how colour is perceived in a wide variety of circumstances, and considers Isaac Newton's observations to be special cases. Unlike Newton, Goethe's concern was not so much with the analytic treatment of colour, as with the qualities of how phenomena are perceived. Philosophers have come to understand the distinction between the optical spectrum, as observed by Newton, and the phenomenon of human colour perception as presented by Goethe—a subject analyzed at length by Wittgenstein in his comments on Goethe's theory in \"Remarks on Colour\".\n\nAt Goethe's time, it was generally acknowledged that, as Isaac Newton had shown in his \"Opticks\" in 1704, colourless (white) light is split up into its component colours when directed through a prism.\n\nGoethe's starting point was the supposed discovery of how Newton erred in the prismatic experiment, and by 1793 Goethe had formulated his arguments against Newton in the essay \"Über Newtons Hypothese der diversen Refrangibilität\" (\"On Newton's hypothesis of diverse refrangibility\"). Yet, by 1794, Goethe had begun to increasingly note the importance of the physiological aspect of colours.\n\nAs Goethe notes in the historical section, Louis Bertrand Castel had already published a criticism of Newton's spectral description of prismatic colour in 1740 in which he observed that the sequence of colours split by a prism depended on the distance from the prism—and that Newton was looking at a special case.\n\n\"Whereas Newton observed the colour spectrum cast on a wall at a fixed distance away from the prism, Goethe observed the cast spectrum on a white card which was progressively moved away from the prism... As the card was moved away, the projected image elongated, gradually assuming an elliptical shape, and the coloured images became larger, finally merging at the centre to produce green. Moving the card farther led to the increase in the size of the image, until finally the spectrum described by Newton in the Opticks was produced... The image cast by the refracted beam was not fixed, but rather developed with increasing distance from the prism. Consequently, Goethe saw the particular distance chosen by Newton to prove the second proposition of the Opticks as capriciously imposed.\" (Alex Kentsis, Between Light and Eye)\n\nIn the preface to the \"Theory of Colours\", Goethe explained that he tried to apply the principle of \"polarity\", in the work—a proposition that belonged to his earliest convictions and was constitutive of his entire study of nature.\n\nIt is hard to present Goethe's \"theory\", since he refrains from setting up any actual theory; he says, \"its intention is to portray rather than explain\" (\"Scientific Studies\"). Instead of setting up models and explanations, Goethe collected specimens—he was responsible for the meteorological collections of Jena University. By the time of his death, he had amassed over 17,800 minerals in his personal collection—the largest in all of Europe. He took the same approach to colour—instead of narrowing and isolating things to a single 'experimentum crucis' (or critical experiment that would prove or disprove his theory), he sought to gain as much breadth for his understanding as possible by developing a wide-ranging exposition through which is revealed the essential character of colour—without having to resort to explanations and theories about perceived phenomena such as 'wavelengths' or 'particles'.\n\n\"The crux of his color theory is its experiential source: rather than impose theoretical statements, Goethe sought to allow light and color to be displayed in an ordered series of experiments that readers could experience for themselves.\" (Seamon, 1998). According to Goethe, \"Newton's error.. was trusting math over the sensations of his eye.\" (Jonah Lehrer, 2006).\n\nTo stay true to the perception without resort to explanation was the essence of Goethe's method. What he provided was really not so much a theory, as a \"rational description\" of colour. For Goethe, \"the highest is to understand that all fact is really theory. The blue of the sky reveals to us the basic law of color. Search nothing beyond the phenomena, they themselves are the theory.\"\n\nGoethe outlines his method in the essay, \"The experiment as mediator between subject and object\" (1772). It underscores his experiential standpoint. \"The human being himself, to the extent that he makes sound use of his senses, is the most exact physical apparatus that can exist.\" (Goethe, \"Scientific Studies\")\n\nUnlike his contemporaries, Goethe didn't see darkness as an absence of light, but rather as polar to and interacting with light; colour resulted from this interaction of light and shadow. For Goethe, light is \"the simplest most undivided most homogenous being that we know. Confronting it is the darkness\" (Letter to Jacobi).\n\nBased on his experiments with turbid media, Goethe characterized colour as arising from the dynamic interplay of darkness and light. Rudolf Steiner, the science editor for the Kurschner edition of Goethe's works, gave the following analogy:\n\nGoethe expresses this more succinctly:\n\nGoethe's studies of colour began with experiments which examined the effects of turbid media, such as air, dust, and moisture on the perception of light and dark. The poet observed that light seen through a turbid medium appears yellow, and darkness seen through an illuminated medium appears blue.\n\nHe then proceeds with numerous experiments, systematically observing the effects of rarefied mediums such as dust, air, and moisture on the perception of colour.\n\nWhen viewed through a prism, the orientation of a light–dark boundary with respect to the prism's axis is significant. With white above a dark boundary, we observe the light extending a blue-violet edge into the dark area; whereas dark above a light boundary results in a red-yellow edge extending into the light area.\n\nGoethe was intrigued by this difference. He felt that this arising of colour at light–dark boundaries was fundamental to the creation of the spectrum (which he considered to be a compound phenomenon).\n\nVarying the experimental conditions by using different shades of grey shows that the intensity of coloured edges increases with boundary contrast.\n\nSince the colour phenomenon relies on the adjacency of light and dark, there are two ways to produce a spectrum: with a light beam in a dark room, and with a dark beam (i.e., a shadow) in a light room.\n\nGoethe recorded the sequence of colours projected at various distances from a prism for both cases (see Plate IV, \"Theory of Colours\"). In both cases, he found that the yellow and blue edges remain closest to the side which is light, and red and violet edges remain closest to the side which is dark. At a certain distance, these edges overlap—and we obtain Newton's spectrum. When these edges overlap in a light spectrum, green results; when they overlap in a dark spectrum, magenta results.\n\nWith a light spectrum (i.e. a shaft of light in a surrounding darkness), we find yellow-red colours along the top edge, and blue-violet colours along the bottom edge. The spectrum with green in the middle arises only where the blue-violet edges overlap the yellow-red edges. Unfortunately an optical mixture of blue and yellow gives white, not green, and so Goethe's explanation of Newton's spectrum fails.\n\nWith a dark spectrum (i.e., a shadow surrounded by light), we find violet-blue along the top edge, and red-yellow along the bottom edge—and where these edges overlap, we find (extraspectral) magenta.\n\nGoethe anticipated Ewald Hering's Opponent process theory by proposing a symmetric colour wheel. He writes, \"The chromatic circle... [is] arranged in a general way according to the natural order... for the colours diametrically opposed to each other in this diagram are those which reciprocally evoke each other in the eye. Thus, yellow demands violet; orange [demands] blue; purple [demands] green; and vice versa: thus... all intermediate gradations reciprocally evoke each other; the simpler colour demanding the compound, and vice versa ( paragraph #50).\n\nIn the same way that light and dark spectra yielded green from the mixture of blue and yellow—Goethe completed his colour wheel by recognising the importance of magenta—\"For Newton, only spectral colors could count as fundamental. By contrast, Goethe's more empirical approach led him to recognize the essential role of magenta in a complete color circle, a role that it still has in all modern color systems.\"\n\nGoethe also included aesthetic qualities in his colour wheel, under the title of \"allegorical, symbolic, mystic use of colour\" (\"Allegorischer, symbolischer, mystischer Gebrauch der Farbe\"), establishing a kind of color psychology.\nHe associated red with the \"beautiful\", orange with the \"noble\", yellow to the \"good\", green to the \"useful\", blue to the \"common\", and violet to the \"unnecessary\".\nThese six qualities were assigned to four categories of human cognition, the rational (\"Vernunft\") to the beautiful and the noble (red and orange), the intellectual (\"Verstand\") to the good and the useful (yellow and green), the sensual (\"Sinnlichkeit\") to the useful and the common (green and blue) and, closing the circle, imagination (\"Phantasie\") to both the unnecessary and the beautiful (purple and red).\n\nMagenta appeared as a colour term only in the mid-nineteenth century, after Goethe. Hence, references to Goethe's recognition of \"magenta\" are fraught with interpretation. If one observes the colours coming out of a prism—an English person may be more inclined to describe as magenta what in German is called \"Purpur\"—so one may not lose the intention of the author.\n\nHowever, literal translation is more difficult. Goethe's work uses two composite words for mixed (intermediate) hues along with corresponding usual colour terms such as \"orange\" and \"violet\".\n\nIt is not clear how Goethe's \"Rot\", \"Purpur\" (explicitly named as the complementary to green), and \"Schön\" (one of the six colour sectors) are related between themselves and to the red tip of the visible spectrum. The text about interference from the \"physical\" chapter does not consider \"Rot\" and \"Purpur\" synonymous. Also, \"Purpur\" is certainly distinct from \"Blaurot\", because \"Purpur\" is named as a colour which lies somewhere between \"Blaurot\" and \"Gelbrot\" (, paragraph 476), although possibly not adjacent to the latter. This article uses the English translations from the above table.\n\n\"The essential difference between Goethe’s theory of colour and the theory which has prevailed in science (despite all modifications) since Newton’s day, lies in this: While the theory of Newton and his successors was based on excluding the colour-seeing faculty of the eye, Goethe founded his theory on the eye’s experience of colour.\"\n\n\"The renouncing of life and immediacy, which was the premise for the progress of natural science since Newton, formed the real basis for the bitter struggle which Goethe waged against the physical optics of Newton. It would be superficial to dismiss this struggle as unimportant: there is much significance in one of the most outstanding men directing all his efforts to fighting against the development of Newtonian optics.\" (Werner Heisenberg, during a speech celebrating Goethe's birthday)\n\nDue to their different approaches to a common subject, many misunderstandings have arisen between Newton's mathematical understanding of optics, and Goethe's experiential approach.\n\nBecause Newton understands white light to be composed of individual colours, and Goethe sees colour arising from the interaction of light and dark, they come to different conclusions on the question: is the optical spectrum a primary or a compound phenomenon?\n\nFor Newton, the prism is immaterial to the existence of colour, as all the colours already exist in white light, and the prism merely fans them out according to their refrangibility. Goethe sought to show that, as a turbid medium, the prism was an integral factor in the arising of colour.\n\nWhereas Newton narrowed the beam of light in order to isolate the phenomenon, Goethe observed that with a wider aperture, there was no spectrum. He saw only reddish-yellow edges and blue-cyan edges with white between them, and the spectrum arose only where these edges came close enough to overlap. For him, the spectrum could be explained by the simpler phenomena of colour arising from the interaction of light and dark edges.\n\nNewton explains the appearance of white with colored edges by saying that due to the differing overall amount of refraction, the rays mix together to create a full white towards the centre, whereas the edges do not benefit from this full mixture and appear with greater red or blue components. For Newton's account of his experiments, see his \"Opticks\" (1704).\n\nGoethe's reification of darkness is rejected by modern physics. Both Newton and Huygens defined darkness as an absence of light. Young and Fresnel combined Newton's particle theory with Huygen's wave theory to show that colour is the visible manifestation of light's wavelength. Physicists today attribute both a corpuscular and undulatory character to light—comprising the wave–particle duality.\n\nThe first edition of the \"Farbenlehre\" was printed at the Cotta’schen Verlagsbuchhandlung on May 16, 1810, with 250 copies on grey paper and 500 copies on white paper. It contained three sections: i) a didactic section in which Goethe presents his own observations, ii) a polemic section in which he makes his case against Newton, and iii) a historical section.\n\nFrom its publication, the book was controversial for its stance against Newton. So much so, that when Charles Eastlake translated the text into English in 1840, he omitted the content of Goethe's polemic against Newton.\n\nGoethe was initially induced to occupy himself with the study of colour by the questions of hue in painting. \"During his first journey to Italy (1786–88), he noticed that artists were able to enunciate rules for virtually all the elements of painting and drawing except color and coloring. In the years 1786–88, Goethe began investigating whether one could ascertain rules to govern the artistic use of color.\"\n\nThis aim came to some fulfillment when several pictorial artists, above all Philipp Otto Runge, took an interest in his colour studies. After being translated into English by Charles Eastlake in 1840, the theory became widely adopted by the art world—especially among the Pre-Raphaelites. J. M. W. Turner studied it comprehensively and referenced it in the titles of several paintings. Wassily Kandinsky considered it \"one of the most important works.\"\n\nDuring a party in Weimar in the winter of 1785, Goethe had a late-night conversation with the South American revolutionary Francisco de Miranda. In a letter written to Count Semyon Romanovich Vorontsov (1792), Miranda recounted how Goethe, fascinated with his exploits throughout the Americas and Europe, told him, \"Your destiny is to create in your land a place where primary colours are not distorted.” He proceeded to clarify what he meant:\nIn the nineteenth century Goethe's Theory was taken up by Schopenhauer in \"On Vision and Colors\", who developed it into a kind of arithmetical physiology of the action of the retina, much in keeping with his own representative realism.\n\nIn the twentieth century the theory was transmitted to philosophy via Wittgenstein, who devoted a series of remarks to the subject at the end of his life. These remarks are collected as \"Remarks on Colour\", (Wittgenstein, 1977).\n\nWittgenstein was interested in the fact that some propositions about colour are apparently neither empirical nor exactly a priori, but something in between: phenomenology, according to Goethe. However, Wittgenstein took the line that 'There is no such thing as phenomenology, though there \"are\" phenomenological problems.' He was content to regard Goethe's observations as a kind of logic or geometry. Wittgenstein took his examples from the Runge letter included in the \"Farbenlehre\", e.g. \"White is the lightest colour\", \"There cannot be a transparent white\", \"There cannot be a reddish green\", and so on. The logical status of these propositions in Wittgenstein's investigation, including their relation to physics, has been discussed in Jonathan Westphal's \"Colour: a Philosophical Introduction\" (Westphal, 1991).\n\nAs early as 1853, in Hermann von Helmholtz's lecture on Goethe's scientific works—he says of Goethe's work that he depicts the perceived phenomena—\"circumstantially, rigorously true to nature, and vividly puts them in an order that is pleasant to survey, and proves himself here, as everywhere in the realm of the factual, to be the great master of exposition\" (Helmholtz 1853). Helmholtz ultimately rejects Goethe's theory as the work of a poet, but expresses his perplexity at how they can be in such agreement about the facts of the matter, but in violent contradiction about their meaning—'And I for one do not know how anyone, regardless of what his views about colours are, can deny that the theory in itself is fully consequent, that its assumptions, once granted, explain the facts treated completely and indeed simply'. (Helmholtz 1853)\n\nAlthough the accuracy of Goethe's observations does not admit a great deal of criticism, his aesthetic approach did not lend itself to the demands of analytic and mathematical analysis used ubiquitously in modern Science. Thomas Johann Seebeck was the only prominent scientist among Goethe's contemporaries who acknowledged the theory, but later also saw it critically.\n\nMuch controversy stems from two different ways of investigating light and colour. Goethe was not interested in Newton's analytic treatment of colour—but he presented an excellent \"rational description\" of the phenomenon of human colour perception. It is as such a collection of colour observations that we must view this book.\n\nMitchell Feigenbaum came to believe that \"Goethe had been right about colour!\"\n\n\"Newton believed that with the help of his prism experiments, he could prove that sunlight was composed of variously coloured rays of light. Goethe showed that this step from observation to theory is more problematic than Newton wanted to admit. By insisting that the step to theory is not forced upon us by the phenomena, Goethe revealed our own free, creative contribution to theory construction. And Goethe's insight is surprisingly significant, because he correctly claimed that all of the results of Newton's prism experiments fit a theoretical alternative equally well.. a century before Duhem and Quine's famous arguments for Underdetermination.\"\n\n\"Goethe’s critique of Newton was not an attack on reason or science, though it has often been portrayed that way.. The critique maintained that Newton had mistaken mathematical imagining as the pure evidence of the senses.. Goethe tried to define the scientific function of imagination: to interrelate phenomena once they have been meticulously produced, described, and organized... Newton had introduced dogma.. into color science by claiming that color could be reduced to a function of rays.\" (Dennis L. Sepper, 2009)\n\"Although he soon rejected Newton’s differential refrangibility, Goethe always affirmed Newtonian mechanics. It was not an apriori poetic prejudice against mathematical analysis but rather performing the experiments that led him to reject the theory... Goethe soon concluded that in order to explain color one needs to know not just about light but also about eye function and relative differences in light across the visual field.\" (Sepper, 2009)\n\nAs a catalogue of observations, Goethe's experiments probe the complexities of human colour perception. Whereas Newton sought to develop a mathematical model for the behaviour of light, Goethe focused on exploring how colour is perceived in a wide array of conditions. Developments in understanding how the brain interprets colours, such as colour constancy and Edwin H. Land's retinex theory bear striking similarities to Goethe's theory.\n\nA modern treatment of the book is given by Dennis L. Sepper in the book, \"Goethe contra Newton: Polemics and the Project for a New Science of Color\" (Cambridge University Press, 2003).\n\n\n\n"}

In thermoregulation, body heat is generated mostly in the deep organs, especially the liver, brain, and heart, and in contraction of skeletal muscles. Humans have been able to adapt to a great diversity of climates, including hot humid and hot arid. High temperatures pose serious stress for the human body, placing it in great danger of injury or even death. For humans, adaptation to varying climatic conditions includes both physiological mechanisms resulting from evolution and behavioural mechanisms resulting from conscious cultural adaptations.\n\nThere are four avenues of heat loss: convection, conduction, radiation, and evaporation. If skin temperature is greater than that of the surroundings, the body can lose heat by radiation and conduction. But, if the temperature of the surroundings is greater than that of the skin, the body actually \"gains\" heat by radiation and conduction. In such conditions, the only means by which the body can rid itself of heat is by evaporation. So, when the surrounding temperature is higher than the skin temperature, anything that prevents adequate evaporation will cause the internal body temperature to rise. During sports activities, evaporation becomes the main avenue of heat loss. Humidity affects thermoregulation by limiting sweat evaporation and thus heat loss.\n\nThe core temperature of a human is regulated and stabilized primarily by the hypothalamus, a region of the brain linking the endocrine system to the nervous system, and more specifically by the anterior hypothalamic nucleus and the adjacent preoptic area regions of the hypothalamus. As core temperature varies from the set point, endocrine production initiates control mechanisms to increase or decrease energy production/dissipation as needed to return the temperature toward the set point (see figure).\n\n\nIn general, humans appear physiologically well adapted to hot dry conditions. However, effective thermoregulation is reduced in hot, humid environments such as the Red Sea and Persian Gulf (where moderately hot summer temperatures are accompanied by unusually high vapor pressures), tropical environments, and deep mines where the atmosphere can be water-saturated. In hot-humid conditions, clothing can impede efficient evaporation. In such environments, it helps to wear light clothing such as cotton, that is pervious to sweat but impervious to radiant heat from the sun. This minimizes the gaining of radiant heat, while allowing as much evaporation to occur as the environment will allow. Clothing such as plastic fabrics that are impermeable to sweat and thus do not facilitate heat loss through evaporation can actually contribute to heat stress.\n\n\nAdjusting the human body temperature downward has been used therapeutically, in particular, as a method of stabilizing a body following trauma. It has been suggested that adjusting the A1 receptor of the hypothalamus may allow humans to enter a hibernation-like state of reduced body temperature, which could be useful for applications such as long-duration space flight.\n\n\nHumans output from 70 watts to 870 watts, depending on the amount of physical activity undertaken.\n"}

In contemporary usage, \"tree of life\" refers to the compilation of comprehensive phylogenetic databases rooted at the last universal common ancestor of life on Earth. The Open Tree of Life, first published 2015, is a project to compile such a database for free public access.\n\nAlthough the mutability of species may have appeared in paintings and trees have been used as a metaphor for other purposes (Porphyrian tree) earlier than 1800, the combination of the concept of branching evolution and the tree image did not appear before 1800. The earliest tree of life was published by the French botanist Augustin Augier in 1801. It shows the relationships between members of the plant kingdom.\n\nJean-Baptiste Lamarck (1744–1829) produced the first branching tree of animals in his \"Philosophie Zoologique\" (1809). It was an upside-down tree starting with worms and ending with mammals. However, Lamarck did not believe in common descent of all life. Instead, he believed that life consists of separate parallel lines advancing from simple to complex.\n\nThe American geologist Edward Hitchcock (1793–1864) published in 1840 the first tree of life based on paleontology in his \"Elementary Geology\". On the vertical axis are paleontological periods. Hitchcock made a separate tree for plants (left) and animals (right). The plant and the animal tree are not connected at the bottom of the chart. Furthermore, each tree starts with multiple origins. Hitchcock's tree was more realistic than Darwin's 1859 theoretical tree (see below) because Hitchcock used real names in his trees. It is also true that Hitchcock's trees were branching trees. However, they were not \"evolutionary\" trees, because Hitchcock believed that a deity was the agent of change. That was an important difference with Darwin.\n\nThe first edition of Robert Chambers' \"Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation\", which was published anonymously in 1844 in England, contained (p. 212) in the chapter \"Hypothesis of the development of the vegetable and animal kingdoms\". It shows a model of embryological development where fish (F), reptiles (R), and birds (B) represent branches from a path leading to mammals (M). In the text this branching tree idea is tentatively applied to the history of life on earth: \"there may be branching\" (p. 191), but the branching diagram is not displayed again specifically for this purpose. However, the image of a branching tree could easily have inspired others to use it explicitly as a representation of the history of life on earth.\n\nIn 1858, a year before Darwin's \"Origin\", the paleontologist Heinrich Georg Bronn (1800–1862) published a hypothetical tree labeled with letters. Although not a creationist, Bronn did not propose a mechanism of change.\n\nCharles Darwin (1809–1882) used the concept of a tree of life in the context of his theory of evolution. In \"On the Origin of Species\" (1859) Chapter IV he presented an abstract diagram of a theoretical tree of life for species of an unnamed large genus (see figure). On the horizontal base line hypothetical species within this genus are labelled A – L and are spaced irregularly to indicate how distinct they are from each other, and are above broken lines at various angles suggesting that they have diverged from one or more common ancestors. On the vertical axis divisions labelled I – XIV each represent a thousand generations. From A, diverging lines show branching descent producing new varieties, some of which become extinct, so that after ten thousand generations descendants of A have become distinct new varieties or even sub-species a, f, and m. Similarly, the descendants of I have diversified to become the new varieties w and z. The process is extrapolated for a further four thousand generations so that the descendants of A and I become fourteen new species labelled a to z. While F has continued for fourteen thousand generations relatively unchanged, species B,C,D,E,G,H,K and L have gone extinct. In Darwin's own words: \"Thus the small differences distinguishing varieties of the same species, will steadily tend to increase till they come to equal the greater differences between species of the same genus, or even of distinct genera.\". This is a branching pattern with no names given to species, unlike the more linear tree Ernst Haeckel made years later (figure below) which includes the names of species and shows a more linear development from \"lower\" to \"higher\" species. In his summary to the section, Darwin put his concept in terms of the metaphor of the tree of life:\n\nThe meaning and importance of Darwin's use of the tree of life metaphor have been extensively discussed. Stephen Jay Gould, for example, says that Darwin placed the famous passage quoted above \"at a crucial spot in his text\", where it marked the conclusion of his argument for natural selection, illustrating both the interconnectedness by descent of organisms as well as their success and failure in the history of life. David Penny has written that Darwin did not use the tree of life to describe the relationship between groups of organisms, but to suggest that, as with branches in a living tree, lineages of species competed with and supplanted one another. Petter Hellström has demonstrated that Darwin consciously chose to name his tree after the biblical tree of life, as described in Genesis, thus relating his theory to Christian mythology, and suggesting that he did so to mobilise the imagination of his readers.\n\nErnst Haeckel (1834–1919) constructed several trees of life. His first sketch (in the 1860s) of his famous tree of life shows \"Pithecanthropus alalus\" as the ancestor of \"Homo sapiens\". His 1866 tree of life from \"Generelle Morphologie der Organismen\" shows three kingdoms: Plantae, Protista and Animalia. His 1879 'Pedigree of Man' was published in \"The Evolution of Man\".\n\nThe model of a tree is still considered valid for eukaryotic life forms. , research into the earliest branches of the eukaryote tree has suggested a tree with either four or two supergroups. There does not yet appear to be a consensus; in a review article, Roger and Simpson conclude that \"with the current pace of change in our understanding of the eukaryote tree of life, we should proceed with caution.\"\n\nIn 2015, the first draft of the Open Tree of Life was published, in which information from nearly 500 previously published trees was combined into a single online database, free to browse and download.\n\nIn 2016, a new tree of life, summarizing the evolution of all known life forms, was published, illustrating the latest genetic findings that the branches were mainly composed of bacteria. The new study incorporated over a thousand newly discovered bacteria and archaea.\n\nThe prokaryotes (the two domains of bacteria and archaea) and certain animals such as bdelloid rotifers and the tardigrade have the ability to transfer genetic information between unrelated organisms through horizontal gene transfer. Recombination, gene loss, duplication, and gene creation are a few of the processes by which genes can be transferred within and between bacterial and archaeal species, causing variation that is not due to vertical transfer. There is emerging evidence of horizontal gene transfer within the prokaryotes at the single and multicell level, so the tree of life does not explain the full complexity of the situation in the prokaryotes.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "74663", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=74663", "title": "Valentinian II", "text": "Valentinian II\n\nValentinian II (; 37115 May 392), was Roman Emperor from AD 375 to 392.\n\nFlavius Valentinianus was born to Emperor Valentinian I and his second wife, Justina. He was the half-brother of Valentinian's other son, Gratian, who had shared the imperial title with his father since 367. He had three sisters: Galla, Grata and Justa. The elder Valentinian died on campaign in Pannonia in 375. Neither Gratian (then in Trier) nor his uncle Valens (emperor for the East) were consulted by the army commanders on the scene. Instead of merely acknowledging Gratian as his father's successor, Valentinian I's generals acclaimed the four-year-old Valentinian \"augustus\" on 22 November 375. The army, and its Frankish general Merobaudes, may have been uneasy about Gratian's lack of military ability, and so raised a boy who would not immediately aspire to military command.\n\nGratian, forced to accommodate the generals who supported his half-brother, governed the trans-alpine provinces (including Gaul, Hispania, and Britain), while Italy, part of Illyricum, and North Africa were under the rule of Valentinian. In 378, their uncle, the Emperor Valens, was killed in battle with the Goths at Adrianople, and Gratian invited the general Theodosius to be emperor in the East. As a child, Valentinian II was under the influence of his Arian mother, the Empress Justina, and the imperial court at Milan, an influence contested by the Nicene bishop of Milan, Ambrose.\n\nJustina used her influence over her young son to oppose the Nicean party which was championed by Ambrose. In 385 Ambrose refused an imperial request to hand over the Portian basilica for the celebration of Easter by the Imperial court. When he was summoned to be punished to the Imperial palace, the orthodox populace rioted, and Justina's Gothic troops were prevented by the arch-bishop himself, standing in the doorway, from entering the Basilica. Justina was forced to back down. Afterwards, Justina ordered legislation to rescind the penalties enacted by Gratian and Valentinian against heresy, proclaiming universal toleration. When Ambrose was found, as no doubt she had intended, to have determinedly infracted the new laws, Justina again tried to have him banished, and Ambrose was forced to barricade himself, with the enthusiastic backing of the people, within the walls of the Basilica. The Imperial troops besieged him, but Ambrose held on, reinforcing the resolution of his followers by allegedly unearthing, beneath the foundations of the church, the bodies of two ancient martyrs. Theodosius, the orthodox emperor of the east, interceded, forcing Justina to again relent. Magnus Maximus was to use the emperor's heterodoxy against him. Valentinian also tried to restrain the despoiling of pagan temples in Rome. Buoyed by this instruction, the pagan senators, led by Aurelius Symmachus, the Prefect of Rome, petitioned in 384 for the restoration of the Altar of Victory in the Senate House, which had been removed by Gratian in 382. Valentinian, at the insistence of Ambrose, refused the request and, in so doing, rejected the traditions and rituals of pagan Rome to which Symmachus had appealed.\n\nIn 383, Magnus Maximus, commander of the armies in Britain, declared himself Emperor and established himself in Gaul and Hispania. Gratian died while fleeing him. For a time the court of Valentinian, through the mediation of Ambrose, came to an accommodation with the usurper, and Theodosius recognized Maximus as co-emperor of the West. In 386 or 387, Maximus crossed the Alps into the Po valley and threatened Milan. Valentinian II and Justina fled to Theodosius in Thessalonica. The latter came to an agreement, cemented by his marriage to Valentinian's sister Galla, to restore the young emperor in the West. In 388, Theodosius marched west and defeated Maximus. Although he was to appoint both of his sons emperor (Arcadius in 383, Honorius in 393), Theodosius remained loyal to the dynasty of Valentinian I.\n\nAfter the defeat of Maximus, Theodosius remained in Milan until 391. Valentinian took no part in Theodosius's triumphal celebrations over Maximus. Valentinian and his court were installed at Vienne in Gaul, while Theodosius appointed key administrators in the West and had coins minted, which implied his guardianship over the 17-year-old. Justina had already died, and Vienne was far away from the influence of Ambrose. Theodosius's trusted general, the Frank Arbogast, was appointed magister militum for the Western provinces (bar Africa) and guardian of Valentinian. Acting in the name of Valentinian, Arbogast was actually subordinate only to Theodosius. While the general campaigned successfully on the Rhine, the young emperor remained at Vienne, in contrast to his warrior father and his older brother, who had campaigned at his age. Arbogast's domination over the emperor was considerable, and the general even murdered Harmonius, a friend of Valentinian suspected of taking bribes, in the emperor's presence.\n\nThe crisis reached a peak when Arbogast prohibited the emperor from leading the Gallic armies into Italy to oppose a barbarian threat. Valentinian, in response, formally dismissed Arbogast. The latter ignored the order, publicly tearing it up and arguing that Valentinian had not appointed him in the first place. The reality of where the power lay was openly displayed. Valentinian wrote to Theodosius and Ambrose complaining of his subordination to his general. In explicit rejection of his earlier Arianism, he invited Ambrose to come to Vienne to baptize him.\n\nOn 15 May 392, Valentinian was found hanged in his residence in Vienne. Arbogast maintained that the emperor's death was suicide. Most sources agree, however, that Arbogast murdered him with his own hands, or paid the Praetorians. Zosimus writing in the early sixth century from Constantinople, states that Arbogast had Valentinian murdered; ancient authorities being divided in their opinion. Ambrose's eulogy is the only contemporary Western source for Valentinian's death. It is ambiguous on the question of the emperor's death, which is not surprising, as Ambrose represents him as a model of Christian virtue. Suicide, not murder, would make the bishop dissemble on this key question.\n\nThe young man's body was conveyed in ceremony to Milan for burial by Ambrose, mourned by his sisters Justa and Grata. He was laid in a porphyry sarcophagus next to his brother Gratian, most probably in the Chapel of Sant'Aquilino attached to San Lorenzo.\n\nAt first Arbogast recognized Theodosius's son Arcadius as emperor in the West, seemingly surprised by his charge's death. After three months, during which he had no communication from Theodosius, Arbogast selected an imperial official, Eugenius, as emperor. Theodosius initially tolerated this regime but, in January 393, elevated the eight-year-old Honorius as \"augustus\" to succeed Valentinian II. Civil war ensued and, in 394, Theodosius defeated Eugenius and Arbogast at the Battle of Frigidus River.\n\nValentinian himself seems to have exercised no real authority, and was a figurehead for various powerful interests: his mother, his co-emperors, and powerful generals. Since the Crisis of the Third Century, the empire had been ruled by powerful generals, a situation formalised by Diocletian and his collegiate system. While Constantine I and his sons had been strong military figures, they had also re-established the practice of hereditary succession, adopted by Valentinian I. The obvious flaw in these two competing requirements came in the reign of Valentinian II, a child. His reign was a harbinger of the fifth century, when children or nonentities, reigning as emperors, were controlled by powerful generals and officials.\n\n\n \n"}

Brown or W. W. Brown (died October 1871) was an American merchant and pioneer settler of Milwaukee, Wisconsin who served in the Wisconsin State Assembly for one year, as a member of the 1st Wisconsin Legislature in 1848.\n\nBrown came early to Milwaukee, a contemporary of George H. Walker, Byron Kilbourn, and Don A. J. Upham. The first ship built in Milwaukee, the 30-ton sloop \"Wenona\", was built for Brown by George Barber in 1835. By 1842, Brown also owned the 100-ton schooner \"Fur Trader\", and was an active merchant in Milwaukee (his Wm. Brown and Company was one of the first businesses in Milwaukee). He was sometimes called \"Double-Headed Brown\" to distinguish him from another William Brown, with whom he was at one time in business partnership.\n\nHe served as a contractor building the mile-long canal in Milwaukee for Kilbourn and Increase Lapham's Rock River Canal Company, which was begun in April 1841 and ready for use by December 1842. This was the only portion of the canal which would ever be built; the bed thereof later became Commerce Street in Milwaukee's Beerline B neighborhood.\n\nIn 1839, Brown, a Whig, was a candidate for Assessor in Milwaukee. He served in the House of Representatives of the Wisconsin Territory for one term representing Milwaukee County in the first 1847 session. After statehood, he was elected in 1848 to the 3rd Milwaukee County Assembly district (the 3rd Ward of the City of Milwaukee). He was a candidate for re-election in 1849, but was not elected. (The Assembly was re-districted, and it is unclear who succeeded him.)\n\nIn 1851, he came in 7th out of 8 candidates for alderman in the Third Ward. He was successful in 1852, coming in first out of four candidates.\n\nHe was elected as a delegate to the 1852 Whig National Convention, and in 1852 was the Whig candidate for Sheriff of Milwaukee County.\n\nIn 1851, he was among the incorporators (along with Kilbourn, Upham and others) of the Milwaukee and Humboldt Plank Road Company.\nMilwaukee pioneer historian James Smith Buck described Brown's final years as follows:Few men have ever lived in Milwaukee who were more widely known, or less thought of (when we take into consideration his ability, for he was a very smart man,) than William W. Brown. Had he devoted his talents to a proper use, his memory would have been respected; but he did not, and finally died, deserted and alone. I shall never forget the look of utter despair that sat upon his face as I met him for the last time, in October, 1871... wending his weary way to the European Hotel, which he never left again alive; it said plainly enough, \"This is the end of a misspent life.\"... He died a few days later, and I remember the difficulty his few remaining friends (and I could name them all,) had, to get help enough to get his body from his room to the hearse.\n"}
