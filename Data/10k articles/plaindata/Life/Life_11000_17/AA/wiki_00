His father, Abu al-Qasim Muhammad ibn Abbad, had established the taifa of Seville, and Abbad became its king when Abu al-Qasim died in 1042. He initially had amicable relations with his neighbour Ferdinand I, Count of Castile and King of León, and tolerated the Christian faith in his own lands. Among other acts of friendship, he authorized the transfer of Saint Isidore's relics from Seville to the Basilica of San Isidoro of León.\n\nAl-Mu'tadid expanded his territory by conquering numerous Islamic taifas (independent principalities), including those of Mértola (1044-45), Huelva (1051), Algeciras (1055), Ronda (1065) and Arcos (1069). In 1053, he invited a number of minor Berber princes from the south to his palace in Seville, suffocating them to death by treating them to an open steam bath, having first sealed up all of the openings in the bathhouse. He also fought against the Zirids of Granada and the Aftasids of Badajoz, but with no conclusive results.

Malfeasance in office is often grounds for a for cause removal of an elected official by statute or recall election. Abuse of power can also mean a person using the power they have for their own personal gain.\n\nInstitutional abuse is the maltreatment of a person (often children or older adults) by a system of power. This can range from acts similar to home-based child abuse, such as neglect, physical and sexual abuse, to the effects of assistance programs working below acceptable service standards, or relying on harsh or unfair ways to modify behavior.\n\nIn February 2010, Judge John Leonardo found that Arpaio \"misused the power of his office to target members of the Board of Supervisors for criminal investigation\".\n\nIn 2008, a federal grand jury began an inquiry of Arpaio for abuse of power, in connection with an FBI investigation. On August 31, 2012, the Arizona US Attorney's office announced that it was \"closing its investigation into allegations of criminal conduct\" by Arpaio, without filing charges.\n\nArpaio was investigated for politically motivated and \"bogus\" prosecutions, which a former US Attorney called \"utterly unacceptable\". Phoenix Mayor Phil Gordon has called Arpaio's \"long list\" of questionable prosecutions \"a reign of terror\".\n\nFa Zheng, a Chinese man, was appointed as the Administrator (太守) of Shu commandery (蜀郡) and \"General Who Spreads Martial Might\" (揚武將軍) by Liu Bei. He oversaw administrative affairs in the vicinity of Yi Province's capital Chengdu and served as Liu Bei's chief adviser.\n\nDuring this period of time, he abused his power by taking personal revenge against those who offended him before and killing them without reason. Some officials approached Zhuge Liang, another of Liu Bei's key advisers, and urged him to report Fa Zheng's lawless behaviour to their lord and take action against him. However, Zhuge Liang replied, \"When our lord was in Gong'an (公安), he was wary of Cao Cao's influence in the north and fearful of Sun Quan's presence in the east. Even in home territory he was afraid that Lady Sun might stir up trouble. He was in such a difficult situation at the time that he could neither advance nor retreat. Fa Xiaozhi supported and helped him so much, such that he is now able to fly high and no longer remain under others' influence. How can we stop Fa Zheng from behaving as he wishes?\" Zhuge Liang was aware that Liu Bei favoured and trusted Fa Zheng, which was why he refused to intervene in this matter.\n\nIn dictatorial, corrupt, or weak states, police officers may carry out many criminal acts for the ruling regime with impunity.\n\nIndividual officers, or sometimes whole units, can be corrupt or carry out various forms of police misconduct; this occasionally happens in many forces, but can be more common where police pay is very low unless supplemented by bribes. Police officers sometimes act with unwarranted brutality when they overreact to confrontational situations, to extract a confession from a person they may or may not genuinely suspect of being guilty, or in other circumstances.\n"}

His reign saw an extension of the Christian domain of Asturias, reconquering Galicia and León.\n\nHe succeeded his brother-in-law Favila, and was succeeded by his son, Fruela I. Alfonso's youngest son, Mauregatus, also became king, and his daughter Adosinda was consort to king Silo of Asturias. The dynasty started by Alfonso was known in contemporary Al-Andalus as the \"Astur-Leonese dynasty\".\n\nAs the son of Duke Peter of Cantabria, Alfonso held many lands in that region. He is said to have married Ermesinda, daughter of Pelagius, who founded Asturias after the Battle of Covadonga in which he reversed the Moorish conquest of the region. He succeeded Pelagius' son, his brother-in-law, Favila, on the throne after the latter's premature death.\nWhether Pelagius or Favila were ever considered kings in their own lifetime is debatable, but Alfonso certainly was. He began a lifelong war against the Moors. In 740, he conquered Galicia and in 754, León. He went as far as La Rioja. However, the few urban populations of these frontier regions fled to his northern dominions, leaving a depopulated buffer between the Christian and Muslim states.\n\nThis created the so-called \"Desert of the Duero\", an empty region between the River Duero and the Asturian Mountains. Alfonso intended it this way; he wished to leave such a zone where any invading army would find it too difficult to survive. Besides the martial, the demographic and cultural effects of this policy on later Asturian, Spanish and Portuguese history is large. It was over a hundred years before the region was repopulated (an event known as the \"Repoblación\").\n\nThe Arab writers speak of the kings of the northwest of Iberia as the \"Beni Alfons\" (descendants or House of Alfonso), and appear to recognize them as a Galician royal stock derived from Alfonso I. Alfonso is credited with establishing the shrine of Our Lady of Covadonga, in commemoration of his father in law's victory at the Battle of Covadonga. He and his queen are interred there. Their epitaph reads:\n\nAlfonso had four children. Three were through his marriage to Ermesinda, although Mauregatus was born to a Muslim slave, Sisalda.\n\n"}
{"id": "331170", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=331170", "title": "All men are created equal", "text": "All men are created equal\n\nThe quotation \"All men are created equal\" has been called an \"immortal declaration,\" and \"perhaps [the] single phrase\" of the American Revolutionary period with the greatest \"continuing importance.\" Thomas Jefferson first used the phrase in the U.S. Declaration of Independence, which he penned in 1776 during the beginning of the American Revolution. It was thereafter quoted and incorporated into speeches by a wide array of substantial figures in American political and social life in the United States. The final form of the phrase was stylized by Benjamin Franklin.\n\nThomas Jefferson, through his friendship with Lafayette, was heavily influenced by French philosophers of the Age of Enlightenment, such as Voltaire, Rousseau and Montesquieu. In their often censored writings, those philosophers advocated that men were born free and equal. This later led to the French Revolution of 1789 and the concept of Human Rights (Droits de l'Homme in French). At the age of 33, Jefferson may have also borrowed the expression from an Italian friend and neighbor, Philip Mazzei, as noted by Joint Resolution 175 of the 103rd Congress as well as by John F. Kennedy in \"A Nation of Immigrants\".\n\nIn 1776 the Second Continental Congress asked Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Jefferson, John Adams, Robert Livingston, and Roger Sherman to write the Declaration of Independence. This Committee of Five voted to have Thomas Jefferson write the document. After Jefferson finished he gave the document to Franklin to proof. Franklin suggested minor changes, one of which stands out far more than the others: \"We hold these truths to be sacred and un-deniable...\" became \"We hold these truths to be self-evident.\"\n\nThe second paragraph of the United States Declaration of Independence starts as follows: \nThe Virginia Declaration of Rights, chiefly authored by George Mason and approved by the Virginia Convention on June 12, 1776, contains the wording:\nGeorge Mason was an elder-planter who had originally stated John Locke's theory of natural rights:\nMason's draft was accepted by a small committee and then rejected by the Virginia Convention. Thomas Jefferson, a competent Virginia lawyer, saw this as a problem in legal writing and chose words that were more acceptable to the Second Continental Congress.\n\nThe Massachusetts Constitution, chiefly authored by John Adams in 1780, contains in its the wording:\nThe plaintiffs in the cases of \"Brom and Bett v. John Ashley\" and \"Commonwealth v. Nathaniel Jennison\" argued that this provision abolished slavery in Massachusetts. The latter case resulted in a \"sweeping declaration . . . that the institution of slavery was incompatible with the principles of liberty and legal equality articulated in the new Massachusetts Constitution\".\n\nThe phrase has since been considered a hallmark statement in democratic constitutions and similar human rights instruments, many of which have adopted the phrase or variants thereof.\n\nThe contradiction between the claim that \"all men are created equal\" and the existence of American slavery attracted comment when the Declaration of Independence was first published. Before final approval, Congress, having made a few alterations to some of the wording, also deleted nearly a fourth of the draft, including a passage criticizing the slave trade. At that time many members of Congress, including Jefferson, owned slaves, which clearly factored into their decision to delete the controversial \"anti-slavery\" passage. Jefferson, an abolitionist at heart, believed adding such a passage would dissolve the independence movement. Jefferson decades before the declaration of independence, argued in court for abolition of a slave. The court dismissed the case outright. In writing the declaration, Jefferson believed the phrase \"all men are created equal\" to be self evident, and would ultimately resolve slavery. In 1776, abolitionist Thomas Day wrote: If there be an object truly ridiculous in nature, it is an American patriot, signing resolutions of independency with the one hand, and with the other brandishing a whip over his affrighted slaves.\n\nThe phrase \"all men are created equal\" has received criticism from elitists and traditional conservatives. For instance, Richard M. Weaver writing in one of the cornerstone works of traditional conservatism, \"Ideas Have Consequences\" (1948), paraphrased a 19th-century writer in writing that \"no man was ever created free and no two men [were] ever created equal\". He continues:\nThe Vietnamese proclamation of independence, written in 1945, uses the phrase \"all men are created equal\" and mentions the U.S. Declaration of Independence in it as well.\n\nThe Rhodesian declaration of independence, ratified in November 1965, is based on the American one, however, it omits the phrase \"all men are created equal\", along with \"the consent of the governed\".\n\n\n"}

He went by the pseudonym Mr. Apology (a label which has since been adopted by an advice columnist) and used new technology of the time, an answering machine, to record confessions from anonymous callers.\n\nBorn in Falls Church, Virginia, Bridge attended the University of Chicago, where he earned a bachelor's degree in fine arts. Returning to the Washington, D. C. area, he became one of the second generation of artists of the Washington Color School movement.\n\nFor a series of large-scale paintings, he used poured paint techniques and then moved on to geometric abstraction. He was championed and collected by Gene Baro, at one time the director of the Corcoran Gallery of Art. Bridge exhibited at the Corcoran and many other galleries in the 1970s. He created at least 79 paintings in the years spanning 1970 to 1977. Bridge married Elinor Schiele in 1977, and they divorced in 1981.\n\nEventually, Bridge tired of the visual image and began making interactive machines with moral implications. The most famous best known of these is \"Crime Time\", where the viewer spins a wheel of chance and either gets away with a \"crime\" by receiving a marble from the machine, or he gets \"caught\" and his hand is held in a lock for 30 seconds. From \"Crime Time\", the next jump for his restless mind was the Apology Line, created after he moved to Manhattan in 1977.\n\nBridge sold rights for a film and novel. \"Mr. Apology\" by Campbell Black was published by Ballantine Books in 1984, and this was adapted by screenwriter Mark Medoff for the HBO thriller, \"Apology\" (1986). The film switched the sex of the conceptual artist from male to female (portrayed by Lesley Ann Warren).\n\nIn 1993, Bridge was the subject of a long article, \"The Confession,\" by Alec Wilkinson, published in the October 4, 1993 issue of \"The New Yorker\". Wilkinson's article was reprinted a decade later in \"Mr. Apology and Other Essays\" (Houghton Mifflin, 2003).\n\nSome confessions taped from the Apology phone calls were published in \"Apology\", a magazine edited and published by Bridge. The last issue was published January 1996. After investigating the notion of bringing the Apology Project to the online service GEnie, he was working on a book about the Apology Line and making plans in 1995 to expand the Apology confessions to the Internet.\n\nIn 1989, his second wife, Marissa Bridge, founded Marissa Bridge Studios, which became one of New York’s leading decorative painting and restoration companies, with offices in Manhattan and the Hamptons. Active in boating and scuba diving, Bridge was diving in August 1995, when he was killed by a hit-and-run jet skier. Lydia Nibley wrote about this in her essay \"All Apologies\" (December 16, 2004):\n\nSeveral passages about Bridge and jet skis are scattered throughout \"The Unwanted Sound of Everything We Want: A Book About Noise \" by Garret Keizer.\n\n\"Apology\", a new theatrical piece based on the life and work of Allan Bridge, is being developed by Greg Pierotti, co-writer of \"The Laramie Project\".\n\nA bank of phone booths were installed for Bridge's 1981 show at the New Museum, enabling guests to pick listen directly to the original Apology Line tapes.\n\nThe film \"Apology\" won the Audience Award at the 1987 Cognac Festival du Film Policier, and that same year it won a CableACE Award for Maurice Jarre's music score.\n\n\n"}

Cannon\n\nBerry Louis Cannon (March 22, 1935 – February 17, 1969) was an American aquanaut who served on the SEALAB II and III projects of the U.S. Navy. Cannon died of carbon dioxide poisoning while attempting to repair SEALAB III. It was later found that his diving rig's baralyme canister, which should have absorbed the carbon dioxide Cannon exhaled, was empty.\n\nBorn March 22, 1935, Cannon grew up in Williston, Florida, where he was raised by his grandmother. He was captain of his high school football team and graduated from Williston High School. Cannon joined the United States Navy after high school and served for four years, becoming a Mineman Second Class. At one time he served at the Hawthorne Naval Ammunition Depot in Hawthorne, Nevada, where he was on the boxing team. Cannon graduated from the University of Florida in 1962 with a Bachelor of Science degree in Electronic Engineering.\n\nCannon was a civilian electronics engineer at the U.S. Navy Mine Defense Laboratory in Panama City, Florida, where he designed intercommunications systems. From August 28 to September 12, 1965, Cannon served on the first crew of SEALAB II near La Jolla, California. He received the Navy's Superior Civilian Service Award for his participation in the project.\n\nIn 1969, Cannon was assigned to Team One for the SEALAB III project, which would take place off San Clemente Island. He was one of four members of Team One assigned to open and secure the habitat, alongside fellow aquanauts Robert A. Barth, Richard Blackburn and John Reaves. On February 16, 1969, the SEALAB III habitat sprang a leak. Cannon, Barth, Blackburn and Reaves were twice sent down to SEALAB in the Personnel Transfer Capsule (PTC) in an attempt to repair the problem.\n\nShortly after 0500 hours on February 17, Cannon began to convulse while working on the exterior of the habitat. Barth tried to save him, holding his head in the breathable gas pocket of the skirt surrounding SEALAB's entrance and unsuccessfully attempting to force the mouthpiece of the emergency aqua-lung regulator between Cannon's teeth. Finally, Barth dragged Cannon back toward the PTC, where his fellow aquanauts helped him bring Cannon inside and Reaves and Blackburn attempted resuscitation. When the PTC reached the surface it was obvious that Cannon was dead. His body was placed in the outer airlock of the deck decompression chamber (DDC), returned to surface pressure and brought to San Diego Naval Hospital. Cannon's funeral was held at Humphrey Mortuary in Chula Vista, California, on February 19. He was buried at Wacahoota Baptist Cemetery in central Florida.\n\nIt was widely reported in the news media that Cannon had died of a heart attack. However, the official board of inquiry, held in San Diego from February 28 to March 12, 1969, concluded that Cannon had in fact died of carbon dioxide poisoning. The carbon dioxide-scrubbing baralyme canister on Cannon's Mark IX diving rig was empty. The SEALAB III aquanauts, including Cannon, did not set up their own diving rigs. The identity of the person who failed to refill the baralyme canister was never determined. SEALAB medical officer Paul G. Linweaver later suggested that Cannon would have realized his equipment was faulty had he not been suffering from extreme cold due to breathing pressurized helium. Surgeon commander John Rawlins, a Royal Navy medical officer assigned to the project, also suggested that hypothermia was a contributing factor.\n\nAccording to John Piña Craven, the U.S. Navy's head of the Deep Submergence Systems Project of which SEALAB was a part, SEALAB III had been \"plagued with strange failures at the very start of operations\". According to Craven, while the other divers were undergoing the weeklong decompression, repeated attempts were made to sabotage their air supply by someone aboard the command barge. Eventually, a guard was posted on the decompression chamber and the men were recovered safely. A potentially unstable suspect was identified by the staff psychiatrist but the culprit was never prosecuted. Craven suggests this may have been done to spare the Navy bad press so soon after the USS \"Pueblo\" incident. As a result, it has been suggested that Cannon's death was a murder.\n\nCannon was married to Mary Lou Cannon and had three sons. He was known for seldom complaining if his complaint would go against command authority. He enjoyed reading the works of Zane Grey.\n\nThe Berry L. Cannon Memorial Aquarium was dedicated in 1970 to the distinguished honor and memory of Berry L. Cannon. It is now part of the Citrus County School District's Marine Science Station in Crystal River, FL.\n\n\n"}

Based on the novel \"The Positronic Man\" by Isaac Asimov and Robert Silverberg (which is itself based on Asimov's original novella of the same name), the plot explores issues of humanity, slavery, prejudice, maturity, intellectual freedom, conformity, sex, love, and mortality. The film, a co-production between Touchstone Pictures and Columbia Pictures, was directed by Chris Columbus. The title comes from the main character existing to the age of two hundred years, and Asimov's novella was published in the year the United States had its bicentennial.\n\nDespite being a box office bomb, makeup artist Greg Cannom was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Makeup at the 72nd Academy Awards, and the film has drawn a cult following. The theme song of the film which was written by James Horner and Will Jennings and sung by Celine Dion is \"Then You Look at Me\".\n\nThe NDR series robot \"Andrew\" is introduced in 2005 into the Martin family home to perform housekeeping and maintenance duties. The family's reactions range from acceptance and curiosity, to outright rejection, and deliberate vandalism by their rebellious older daughter, Grace, who treats him as a mere robot and continues with her rebellious ways while growing up. This leads Andrew to discover that he can both identify emotions and reciprocate in kind. When Andrew accidentally breaks a figurine belonging to \"Little Miss\" Amanda, he carves a replacement out of wood, as way to apologize to her. The family is astonished by this creativity and “Sir” Richard Martin takes Andrew to his manufacturer, to inquire if all the robots are like him. The CEO of the company, Dennis Mansky, sees this development as a problem and wishes to scrap Andrew. Angered, Richard takes Andrew home and allows him to pursue his own development, encouraging Andrew to educate himself in the humanities.\n\nYears later, Martin again takes Andrew to NorthAm Robotics for repairs following an accident in which his thumb is accidentally cut off. Richard ensures first that Andrew's personality will remain un-tampered with. Andrew requests his face be altered to convey the emotions he feels but cannot fully express, while he is being repaired. Twelve years later, Andrew eventually asks for his freedom, much to Richard's dismay. He grants the request, but banishes Andrew so he can be 'completely' free. Andrew builds himself a home and lives alone. In 2048, Andrew sees Richard one last time on his deathbed, where he apologizes for banishing him.\n\nAndrew goes on a quest to locate more NDR series robots to discover if others have also developed sentience. After nearly twenty years of failure, he finds Galatea, an NDR robot that has been given feminine attributes and personality. These, however, are simply aspects of her programming and not something which she spontaneously developed. Galatea is owned by Rupert Burns, son of the original NDR robot designer. Burns works to create more human-looking robots, but is unable to attract funding. Andrew agrees to finance the research and the two join forces to revolutionize robotics. He meanwhile maintains contact with Amanda, who grew up, married, had a child, divorced and now has a granddaughter called Portia. After receiving human features, Andrew comes back home, and sees Amanda, now aged, with Portia, who is the same as her grandmother in her younger years. Initially he has some troubles reintegrating into the family since now there is only Amanda who actually knows him, but he manages to befriend Portia.\n\nSome time later, Amanda passes away, leaving Andrew to realise that everyone he knows will die one day. Accepting this fact, Andrew decides to become human. With the help of Rupert, he creates a new type of mechanical organs that can be used both by him to become more human and used by humans as prosthetic organs. He gains a nervous system and lots of other organs that make him able to eat, to feel emotions and sensations, and also to have sexual intercourse. Eventually, Andrew becomes human enough to fall in love with Portia and, ultimately, she falls in love with him.\n\nOver the course of the next century, Andrew petitions the World Congress to recognize him as human, which would allow him and Portia to be legally married, but is rejected; the Speaker of the Congress explains that society can tolerate an everlasting machine, but argues that an immortal human would create too much jealousy and anger. Initially Andrew decides to make Portia live as much as possible through his medical inventions but after some decades she tells him that she can't and doesn't want to live forever, so one day she will refuse any more treatment. Andrew decides to make Burns inject blood into his system, thereby allowing him to age, and thus he begins to grow old alongside Portia.\n\nAndrew again attends the World Congress with Portia, both now appearing old and frail, and again petitions to be declared a human being. On their death bed with life support, Andrew and Portia watch as the Speaker of the World Congress announces on television the court's decision: that Andrew is officially recognized as human, and (aside from \"Methuselah and other Biblical characters\") is the oldest human being in history at the age of two-hundred years old. The Speaker also validates the marriage between Portia and Andrew. Andrew dies while listening to the broadcast despite his life support, and Portia orders their nurse Galatea, a now recognizably-human android, to unplug her life support. Portia dies hand-in-hand with Andrew after she whispers \"See you soon\" to him.\n\n\nWilliams confirmed in a \"Las Vegas Sun\" interview that his character was not played by a body double and that he had actually worn the robot costume.\n\nThe film holds a 36% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 96 critical reviews, with an average rating of 4.8/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \"\"Bicentennial Man\" is ruined by a bad script and ends up being dull and mawkish.\" The review aggregator Metacritic gives it a score of 42.\n\nRoger Ebert gave it two out of four stars: \nWilliam Arnold of the \"Seattle Post-Intelligencer\" said: \nTodd McCarthy of \"Variety\" summed it up as \"an ambitious tale handled in a dawdling, sentimental way.\"\n\n\n"}

Because of his open opposition to the Fanmi Lavalas political party, the Mayor had given him the nickname \"Iron Pants.\" This nickname also earned Lindor countless death threats from local authorities and radical supporters of President Aristide.\nIn addition to being a news editor, Lindor also worked as an inspector at the local customs office, and also taught social science classes at the Caribbean Secondary Centre school in Petit-Goâve.\n\nOn the morning of 3 December 2001, Lindor and Emmanuel Espoir Clédanor, a former journalist for \"Radio Plus\", were in route to the village of Miragoâne. When they reached L'Acul, approximately 5 km outside of Petit-Goâve, their vehicle was attacked by members of “Dómi Nan Bwa\", who are supporters of President Jean-Bertrand Aristide's Fanmi Lavalas party. Clédanor managed to escape unharmed. Lindor attempted to hide in the nearby home of Mr. Zéphir Pétuel, President of the Assembly of the Communal Section (ASEC) of the First Plain and member of Popular Organization \"Dòmi nan Bwa.\" As Lindor was chased by his attackers, he was forced to surrender and then hacked to death with machetes.\n\nJust three days prior to Lindor's murder, Dumay Bony, the deputy mayor of Petit-Goâve, referred to Lindor as a terrorist, and encouraged others to apply the policy of \"zero tolerance\", which was a euphemism for lynching, to Lindor and a list of others considered to be affiliated with the opposition. Lindor became a specific target of this policy, because of his recent invitation to members of the Convergence Démocratique to appear on his radio show \"Dialogue\". The group openly criticized the governance of President Aristide and his Fanmi Lavalas Party.\n\nLindor's murder is presumed to be linked to an attack by members of the Convergence Démocratique on Joseph Céus Duverger, a chief of Domi nan Bwa, earlier that same morning. This is supported by the fact that Love Augustin, another member of the Convergence Démocratique, was about to be executed in his home by a group of Domi nan Bwa members, until they spotted Lindor's car pull up across the street, and immediately left Augustin to go attack Lindor. Ten Domi nan Bwa members have been indicted for Lindor's murder, including Raymond Désulmé, Sissi Dio, D'or Monal, Joël Jolifils, Saint-Juste Joubert, Bob Toussaint, Fritznel Doudoute (aka Lionel Doudoute), Ti Florian, Jean-Raymond Flory and Sedner Sainvilus (known as Ti Lapli), but only four have been arrested. Two of the charged, Joubert Saint-Juste and Jean-Remy Demosthene, were convicted and sentenced to life, seven more were convicted in absentia, and of those none have been arrested or brought into custody. One of the defendants was acquitted because he was arrested by a mistake in identity having shared the same name as one of the alleged killers.\n\nFollowing his murder, Lindor's family still received many threats, and was ultimately forced to flee the country and seek asylum in Paris, France.\n\nHaiti has experienced several long periods of political tension, one of which can be traced back to the decision by a group of small political organizations to boycott the presidential elections of 2000. This boycott was their way of protesting the parliamentary elections earlier that year, which they claimed had fraudulently awarded 15 of the 19 Senate seats and eighty percent of seats in the House of Assembly to Jean Bertrand Aristide's newly formed Fanmi Lavalas party. This group of political organizations later joined together to form an alliance known as the Convergence Démocratique, also referred to as the \"opposition,\" which sought to undermine the authority of President Aristide.\n\nDirectly related to this political tension, the beginning of 2001 marked an enormous decline in press freedom in Haiti, with close to 40 journalists having faced violent threats or attacks in that year alone. The majority of these threats and attacks were initiated by either police or supporters of President Aristide's Fanmi Lavalas Party, therefore greatly reducing the likelihood of any government intervention on behalf of the victims of this violence. That situation was a direct result of President Aristide's instatement of a \"zero tolerance\" campaign against crime in June of that year. Through this campaign, police officers were allowed and even encouraged to punish criminals on the spot, without a trial, if they are caught red-handed. Members of the press/media in Haiti were often characterized by President Aristide as members of the opposition, but such allegations served as a way of justifying the violence that was being committed against them, regardless of whether or not the allegations were in fact true.\n\nLindor has not been the only journalist to be killed in Haiti, as in 2000 Jean Léopold Dominique of Radio Haiti-Inter and Gérard Denoze of Radio Plus met the same fate.\n\nLindor proved to be a prominent and influential voice for democracy in Haiti, specifically in his small town of Petit-Goâve. He did not associate himself with any one political group, but instead used his position at Radio Echo 2000 to give all groups the chance to share their views and opinions. The nature of Lindor's murder was especially gruesome, and acted as a new kind of warning for all members of the media that are considered to be aligned with the opposition. A dozen other journalists were so afraid that they would meet the same fate as Lindor that they fled the country soon after his murder.\n\nLindor was not the only Haitian journalist to be killed by supporters of Aristide, but his murder led to a particular increase in outrage toward Aristide's administration, causing the people of Petit-Goâve, followed by both national and international communities, to organize protests and even riots that demanded justice for Lindor.\n\nHe is one example across the region of journalists who have been threatened by politicians and killed as a result.\n\nUNESCO Director-General Koïchiro Matsuura condemned the murder, saying, \"The murder of Brignol Lindor, in horrific circumstances, will cause indignation among all who believe in the democratic future of Haiti and all those who struggle for freedom of expression. I request the highest authorities of the country to make all resources available to investigators so that this heinous crime will not go unpunished. A society that endeavors to heal the wounds of the past and build a democratic future needs all forums of expression and dialogue.\"\n\nNearly a full year after Lindor was murdered, more than 8,000 protesters walked through the streets of Petit-Goâve, Haiti, on 18 November 2002, and chanted \"Down with Aristide!\" and \"Justice for Brignol!\" according to a report by Radio Vision 2000\n\nOn the first anniversary of his murder, his brother Moreno issued a call for justice through Reporters Without Borders, saying, \"I was at home the day I heard he had been chopped to death. I feared it was the end for my family. I was wrong. But we were threatened and had to flee the country. A year later, the killers can still count on the inertia of the authorities. The hardest thing is the injustice of it, that nobody has been punished. My brother was killed because he allowed everyone to speak on the radio. Haitians must be given their say and Brignol must be given justice.\"\n\n"}

The bolt may or may not destroy part of the brain.\n\nThe bolt consists of a heavy rod made of corrosion-resistant alloys, such as stainless steel. It is held in position inside the barrel of the stunner by means of rubber washers. The bolt is usually not visible in a stunner in good condition. The bolt is actuated by a trigger pull and is propelled forward by compressed air, spring mechanism, or by the discharge of a blank round ignited by a firing pin. After striking a shallow but forceful blow on the forehead of the animal, spring tension causes the bolt to recoil back into the barrel.\n\nThe captive bolt pistol was invented in 1903 by Dr. Hugo Heiss, former director of a slaughterhouse in Straubing, Germany.\n\nCaptive bolt pistols are of three types: penetrating, non-penetrating, and free bolt. The use of penetrating captive bolts has largely been discontinued in commercial situations in order to minimize the risk of transmission of disease.\n\nIn the penetrating type, the stunner uses a pointed bolt which is propelled by pressurized air, spring mechanism, or a blank cartridge. The bolt penetrates the skull of the animal, enters the cranium, and catastrophically damages the cerebrum and part of the cerebellum. Concussion causes destruction of vital centers of the brain, and an increase in intracranial pressure, the animal loses consciousness. This method is currently the most effective type of stunning, since it physically destroys brain matter (increasing the probability of a successful stun), while also leaving the brain stem intact and thus ensuring the heart continues to pump during the exsanguination. One disadvantage of this method is that brain matter is allowed to enter the blood stream, possibly contaminating other tissue with bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE, colloquially known as mad cow disease).\nThe action of a non-penetrating stunner is similar, but the bolt is blunt with a mushroom-shaped tip. The bolt strikes the forehead with great force and immediately retracts. This concussion is responsible for the unconsciousness of the animal. This type of stunner is less reliable at causing immediate and permanent unconsciousness than penetrating types; however, it has undergone a resurgence of popularity because of concerns about mad cow disease. In the European Union, this captive bolt design is required for slaughter of animals that will be used for pharmaceutical manufacture.\n\nThe free bolt stunner is used for emergency, in-the-field euthanasia of large farm-animals that cannot be restrained. It differs from a true captive bolt gun in that the projectile is not retractable; it is similar in operation to a powder-actuated nail gun or conventional firearm. Capable of firing only when pressed firmly against a surface (typically the animal's forehead), the device fires a small projectile through the animal's skull. The veterinarian can then either leave the animal to die from the projectile wound or administer lethal drugs.\nWith cattle, goats, sheep, rabbits, and horses, failure to adequately stun using a penetrating stunner can largely be attributed to incorrect positioning. Captive bolts allow for meat trimmings from the head to be salvaged. In some veal operations, a non-penetrating concussive stunner is used in order to preserve the brains for further processing.\n\nCaptive bolt stunners are safer to use in most red meat slaughter situations. There is no danger of ricochet or over-penetration as there is with regular firearms.\n\nThe cartridges typically use 2 to 3 grains (130 to 190 mg) of smokeless powder but can use up to 7 grains (450 mg) in the case of large animals such as bulls. The velocity of the bolt is usually in the case of small animals and in the case of large animals.\n\nThere have been a number of cases where a captive bolt pistol has been used for homicide, including:\n\n\n"}

His holdings were on the south of the central Los Angeles Plaza, later the first site of the city's Chinatown and location of present-day Union Station.\n\nApablasa was born April 13, 1847, in San Diego, California. He was the son of Juan Apablasa (or Apablaza) of Chile, who came to Mexican Alta California about 1839, and to Pueblo de Los Ángeles in 1843. His mother was María del Espíritu Santo Blanco. He had 7 siblings. Cayetano attended parochial school.\n\nHe was married in Los Angeles to Concepcion Carasco (or Carrasco), and they had two sons and three daughters—John Vincent, Cayetano John (who later became a dentist), Mary (Mrs. Maria Conley, or Mrs. Lita Bernstein), Candelaria or Conchita (Mrs. Finlay), and Laura (Mrs. Thesing). The family home was in a seven-acre orchard near the Old Plaza.\n\nHe died November 14, 1889, several weeks after he was thrown from his horse in an accident. His widow married Ildefonso A. Sepulveda in 1892.\n\nAfter he left school at age seventeen, he entered the Wilmington Shipbuilding Company in Wilmington and served there during the American Civil War, until 1869. After the war, he opened a blacksmithery or a wagon shop at 99 Alameda Street. His later activities involved the extensive real estate holdings of his family. In 1985 the \"Los Angeles Times\" noted that:\n\nThe family built what was believed to be the city's first frame house but it was moved in 1933 to make room for what was then Union Passenger Terminal, the nation's newest train depot when it opened in 1937–38. The Apablasa family was also responsible for Los Angeles' first subdivision, when late in the last century it sold land to Chinese residents who built the first Chinatown. An \"Apablasa Street\" once ran through the Chinese quarter.\n\nApablasa was elected to the Los Angeles Common Council on December 3, 1877, for a term ending in December 1878, representing the 1st Ward. He was a member of the police committee.\n\nThe Workingman's Party nominated him for the State Senate in 1880.\n\n"}

{"id": "232857", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=232857", "title": "Chao (Sonic)", "text": "Chao (Sonic)\n\nChao (; ) are fictional life forms in the \"Sonic the Hedgehog\" video game series published by Sega. They are small, childlike creatures that go through a complex life cycle and exist in several visual forms depending on how they are raised. Developer Sonic Team incorporated Chao into the games to encourage players to explore levels and support the good–evil dichotomy of \"Sonic Adventure 2\".\n\nChao have appeared in many games in the series, beginning with \"Sonic Adventure\" in 1998. They usually take the form of digital pets, but have also played parts in the story and figured into other gameplay elements. Most notably, the character Cream the Rabbit has a Chao named Cheese, whom she uses to attack enemies. They have also appeared in games outside the series, the \"Sonic the Hedgehog\" comics, and the \"Sonic X\" anime, as well as being featured in promotions and merchandise. Critics have given mixed opinions on Chao and their integration into \"Sonic\" gameplay, generally praising their worth as a diversion but criticizing Chao minigames' low interactivity.\n\nSonic Team's Takashi Iizuka stated in an interview with video game publication 1UP.com that Chao were incorporated into \"Sonic Adventure\" \"so that new players would be forced to go out, explore the action sections, and find Flickies and things.\" Chao were designed as a \"relative neutral entity\" in this game. However, to remain consistent with the good–evil dichotomy of \"Sonic Adventure 2\", they were designed so that the player could raise them as \"Hero Chao\" or \"Dark Chao\". Chao were given the ability to socialize and interact in \"Sonic Adventure 2\" in order to make the game unique, and to more resemble \"a real artificial life form.\"\n\nChao are small creatures with a pudding-like body and behave much like human infants, with pleasant and relaxing personalities. Professor Chao, a minor character in \"Sonic Adventure 2\", states that Chao are cute, and enjoy toys and being held or petted. However, they dislike being held while the player jumps, spins around, or throws them. Chao's diets consist of tree fruit and coconuts. Chao hatch from eggs found in Chao Gardens. When the player spends enough time with a Chao in the Chao Garden, the Chao develops a cocoon; it hatches from this as an adult. Eventually it develops another cocoon. If the Chao has been treated well, the cocoon is pink and the Chao is reincarnated as an egg; the cycle then restarts and the Chao remembers the player. If, however, the Chao has been treated poorly, the cocoon is gray and the Chao dies, removing every trace of itself from the game. Chao can breed to produce fertile eggs.\n\nChao have appeared in numerous \"Sonic the Hedgehog\" video games as digital pets. They made their first appearance in the 1998 Dreamcast game \"Sonic Adventure\". The player can raise them, enter them in races, and export them to \"Chao Adventure\", a game for the Dreamcast's VMU peripheral. The player can also trade Chao or post their high scores online using the Dreamcast's Internet capabilities. The Chao raising feature was expanded in \"Sonic Adventure 2\"; Chao may become \"Hero Chao\" or \"Dark Chao\" depending on whether the game's \"hero\" characters (Sonic the Hedgehog, Miles \"Tails\" Prower, and Knuckles the Echidna) or \"dark\" characters (Shadow the Hedgehog, Doctor Eggman, and Rouge the Bat) are nicer to them. Chao can enter karate competitions in this game, as well as racing. The Game Boy Advance (GBA) games \"Sonic Advance\", \"Sonic Advance 2\", and \"Sonic Pinball Party\" feature a \"Tiny Chao Garden\", similar to the Chao Gardens of \"Sonic Adventure\" and \"Sonic Adventure 2\" but with minigames in place of racing and karate competitions. Chao can be transferred between \"Sonic Adventure 2 Battle\" and \"Sonic Adventure DX: Director's Cut\"—Nintendo GameCube ports of \"Sonic Adventure 2\" and \"Sonic Adventure\"—and the GBA games featuring a Tiny Chao Garden. Unusually, a generic Chao is an unlockable character in the party game \"Sonic Shuffle\".\n\nChao have also appeared in the series as minor characters and gameplay elements. Two Chao—one Normal and one Dark—who drive Chao-styled mechas are playable characters in the two-player battle mode of \"Sonic Adventure 2: Battle\". On the \"Sonic the Hedgehog\"-styled pinball board in \"Sonic Pinball Party\", one of the player's objectives is to hatch several Chao eggs. Each world in the 2004 GBA game \"Sonic Advance 3\" features Chao-inspired minigames to earn extra lives for the player, and a sidequest that involves finding Chao to obtain Chaos Emeralds. 2007's PlayStation Portable installment \"Sonic Rivals 2\" hides Chao throughout levels to be found in a free play mode. In the 2008 Nintendo DS role-playing game \"\", Chao eggs are hidden throughout the in-game universe for the player to find and hatch. The resulting infant Chao can be equipped to characters. This affects the characters' performance in battle; for example, one kind will increase the character's hit points. The game features a multiplayer mode in which Chao can be traded between players who each have a copy of the game. Chao take the form of an item in the \"Panel Flip\" party game of the 2009 Wii and DS game \"Mario & Sonic at the Olympic Winter Games\". Each player's object is to claim as many panels as possible in a six-by-six grid; finding a Chao upon flipping a panel claims all panels in a given row or column for the player. One mission in \"Sonic Generations\" (2011) involves racing against Cream the Rabbit to collect lost Chao in a city location.\n\nCream, a prominent character in the series, has a Chao named Cheese as a partner. In a move to keep her image safe, she often uses him to attack enemies instead of doing so herself. Other notable Chao include Chaos, guardian of the Chao, who serves as an antagonist in \"Sonic Adventure\"; Omochao, a robotic Chao who appears in several games as a means of player tutorial; and Chocola, Cheese's twin whom Cream, Amy Rose, and Big the Cat search for over the course of \"Sonic Heroes\".\n\nChao have also made appearances in video games outside the \"Sonic the Hedgehog\" series. In the 2004 PlayStation 2 game \"Sega Superstars\"; the player uses points earned during the game to please a pet Chao. Marking the introduction of the character Sonic the Hedgehog to the 2008 Wii game \"Super Smash Bros. Brawl\", Chao and other characters from the \"Sonic the Hedgehog\" series appear as collectible trophies and stickers.\n\nThey also appear as throphies in \"Super Smash Bros. for 3DS and Wii U\" and as spirits in \"Super Smash Bros. Ultimate\".\n\nChao were recurring characters in the \"Sonic X\" anime that ran from 2003 to 2006. In the episode \"Little Chao Lost\", Cheese becomes lost while swimming in a stream. The main characters find him at the stream's end, in a Chao colony, where Doctor Eggman shows up to steal a supposed Chaos Emerald from them until he is defeated. Later on, in \"Flood Fight\", a colony of Chao appears after a battle with Chaos; they turn out to be Chaos' old friends and embrace it as it leaves with Tikal the Echidna to return to the past.\n\nChao have also made occasional appearances in Archie Comics' \"Sonic the Hedgehog\" comic book series. They debuted in an \"Sonic Adventure\"-based story arc, where they work together with Tikal to defeat Chaos. At one point, Sonic, Tails, and Knuckles find a Chao garden and one Chao followed Sonic home, and after spending time around his Roboticized father came to resemble Omochao. However, Eggman destroys the garden, and the Chao migrate to a lake. Much later, Cream and her mother Vanilla protect a frightened but incompetent group of Chao from Eggman's assistant, Snively. Cream's friend Amy Rose realizes they are the same group from the lake and, to Cream's delight, suggests that the lake can be converted to a Chao garden. Following the comic reboot, Cheese continued to accompany Cream while Chocola was revealed to live with her mother Vanilla and Gemerl (from Sonic Advance 3). The heroes would also discover a Chao Garden hidden in an undersea cavern whose inhabitants included an ancient Chao named Aquarius and a guard dog-like Chao named Crusher.\n\nChao and the Chao-raising \nsystem have received generally positive reviews. In a review of \"Sonic Adventure\", GameSpot's Peter Bartholow stated that \"with the Chao-breeding simulation and the minigames, \"Sonic\" offers much more beyond the completion of its story.\" IGN stated that \"\"SA\" more than has the extras department covered.\" This enthusiasm was extended to IGN's reviews of \"Sonic Adventure 2\", \"Sonic Advance\", and \"Sonic Adventure DX: Director's Cut\". GameSpot's Shane Satterfield was critical of the Chao raising feature in \"Sonic Adventure 2: Battle\", stating that \"there's little in the way of interactivity\" and that \"the Chao training aspect using the Game Boy Advance is little more than a novelty.\" However, GameSpy's Shane Bettenhausen praised the feature in the game, comparing Chao to Tamagotchi digital pets. GameSpot's Frank Provo noted the appeal to \"those people who might only enjoy pinball in passing\" that Chao brought to \"Sonic Pinball Party\". 1UP.com's Chris Baker called the Chao feature in \"Sega Superstars\" \"ultimately worthless... but some might find it amusing.\" In a review of \"Sonic Chronicles: The Dark Brotherhood\", GameSpot's Shiva Stella praised the level of strategy that the game's Chao system added. Destructoid's Jim Sterling voiced a similar opinion, although saying that Chao had been \"rubbish\" in previous games.\n\nA Chao keychain was released as part of a \"Sonic X\" character keychain series. Between July 27 and September 8, 2002, Sega hosted events at Tokyo-based department stores to promote upcoming Sega video games. Attendees could download \"Chao Mini Garden\"s and exclusive Chao to their copies of \"Sonic Advance\". Chao clothing clips, along with accessories based on other Sega characters, were available.\n\nChao's notability extends beyond the \"Sonic\" series and related media; Mary Jane Irwin of IGN used \"Chao program\" to describe \"Pokémon Channel\" in her review of the game.\n\n"}
{"id": "20821593", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20821593", "title": "Charles Winters", "text": "Charles Winters\n\nCharles \"Charlie\" Thompson Winters (February 10, 1913 – October 29, 1984) was an American businessman who volunteered during the 1948 Arab–Israeli War. He was imprisoned for 18 months for helping smuggle three B-17 Flying Fortress heavy bombers to Israel in the late 1940s, but pardoned posthumously by President George W. Bush on December 23, 2008.\n\nWinters, the Protestant son of Scotch-Canadian and Irish parents, was born in Brookline, Massachusetts in 1913. Polio struck him at an early age, leaving him with a limp. Because of this handicap, the United States Army rejected him during World War II, and he instead spent the war working for the government as a purchasing agent.\n\nWinters entered the produce export business after the war, buying decommissioned military cargo planes that were being used to transport fruits and vegetables. A friend and flight engineer named Al Schwimmer, known as the father of the Israeli air force, enlisted Winters in his efforts to supply aircraft to Jewish fighters in Israel; with his government experience, Winters managed to smuggle three B-17 bombers to Israel. Taking off from Miami, the two B-17s refueled in Puerto Rico, as if completing a normal shipping route, but instead flew to Israel by way of the Azores and Czechoslovakia; a third B-17 joined the group in Czechoslovakia. They constituted the newly created Israeli Air Force's first heavy bombers. Winters was said to have decided to help supply the Israeli forces as a favor to his Jewish friends, and received no monetary compensation for the work. His efforts gained him the nickname \"The Godfather of the Israeli Airforce\" \n\nThe three bombers smuggled by Winters were the only heavy bombers in the Israeli Air Force during the war, but were reportedly essential in turning the tide of war in Israel's favor. In his diary on July 16, 1948, David Ben-Gurion noted their arrival in Israel, and mentioned that they had already been used for several bombing runs in Egypt. They formed 69 Squadron of the Israeli Air Force, known as the \"Hammers\".\n\nWinters was subsequently prosecuted by the U.S. Attorney in Miami for violating the Neutrality Act of 1939 in conspiring to smuggle three bombers via Czechoslovakia to Palestine. Winters was found guilty, fined $5000, spent 18 months in prison, and was finally released on November 17, 1949. Schwimmer, though convicted, was not sentenced to prison, and was pardoned by President William J. Clinton in 2000. Another man in the operation, Herman Greenspun, was also convicted with no prison time, and pardoned in 1961 by President John F. Kennedy.\n\nAt the time of his death, Winters was married to the former Joan Babineau and had two children with her, Lisa and James (Jimi). His sons Charles Todd and Charles Jr. were from previous marriages. He never told his children about his smuggling or prison time, and his son Jimi recounted that the first hint he ever had of something in his father's past was when his father admitted to him that he couldn't buy a gun. In 1961 he received a letter from then Foreign Affairs Minister Golda Meir, commending him for his efforts and inviting him to the opening of a new memorial in Israel. Winters lived the rest of his life in Miami, where he founded an export firm. He died there October 30, 1984 and his ashes were buried in the Alliance International Cemetery in Jerusalem's \"German Colony,\" next to Jerusalem's Knights Templar cemetery as well as scattered from Mount Tabor.\n\nWinters' son James, along with his close childhood friend Frank Jimenez, began campaigning for his father's pardon after his death, receiving the support of, among others, 21 Congressmen, the American Jewish Committee, and Steven Spielberg. President Bush officially pardoned Winters on December 23, 2008. Democratic Representative Ron Klein, who led the congressional group, commented that \"President Bush made the right decision today to issue a posthumous pardon to Charles Winters, a Florida resident who played an essential role in the creation of the state of Israel.\"\n\nWinters' lawyer, Wilmer Hale partner Reginald Brown, stated, \"He did a heroic thing and, at the time, the law didn’t reflect our values. The pardon is a way of the law catching up with the history.\" His son James responded to the pardon, saying, \"This is a present for my father...It was a monumental challenge, but my dad used to always say ‘Keep the faith,’ and we did\". Winters' pardon constituted the first posthumous pardon since Henry Ossian Flipper in 1999.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2070766", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2070766", "title": "Constitutional growth delay", "text": "Constitutional growth delay\n\nConstitutional delay of growth and puberty (CDGP) is a term describing a temporary delay in the skeletal growth and thus height of a child with no physical abnormalities causing the delay. Short stature may be the result of a growth pattern inherited from a parent (familial) or occur for no apparent reason (idiopathic). Typically at some point during childhood, growth slows down, eventually resuming at a normal rate. CDGP is the most common cause of short stature and delayed puberty.\n\nChildren with constitutional delay of growth and puberty (CDGP), the most common cause of short stature and pubertal delay in males, typically have slowed linear growth within the first 3 years of life. In this variant of normal growth, linear growth velocity and weight gain slows beginning as young as age 3–6 months, resulting in downward crossing of growth percentiles, which often continues until age 2–3 years. At that time, growth resumes at a normal rate, and these children grow either along the lower growth percentiles or beneath the curve but parallel to it for the remainder of the prepubertal years.\n\nAt the expected time of puberty, the height of children with CDGP begins to drift further from the growth curve because of delay in the onset of the pubertal growth spurt. Catch-up growth, onset of puberty, and pubertal growth spurt occur later than average, resulting in normal adult stature and sexual development. Although CDGP is a variant of normal growth rather than a disorder, delays in growth and sexual development may contribute to psychological difficulties, warranting treatment for some individuals. Recent studies have suggested that referral bias is largely responsible for the impression that normal short stature per se is a cause of psycho-social problems; non-referred children with short stature do not differ from those with more normal stature in school performance or socialization.\n\nCDGP is a global delay in development that affects every organ system. Delays in growth and sexual development are quantified by skeletal age, which is determined from bone age radio-graphic studies of the left hand and wrist. Growth and development are appropriate for an individual's biologic age (skeletal age) rather than for their chronological age. Timing and tempo of growth and development are delayed in accordance with the biologic state of maturity.\n\nApproximately 15% of patients with short stature referred for endocrinologic evaluation have CDGP. Individuals with CDGP and familial short stature represent another 23%. The frequency of CDGP may be underestimated because individuals with milder delays and those who are not psychologically stressed may not be seen by subspecialists. In a study of 555 (out of 80,000) schoolchildren below the third percentile in height for age with growth rates below normal (<5 cm/y), twice as many boys as girls were affected. CDGP was found in 28% of boys and 24% of girls, and another 18% of boys and 16% of girls had familial short stature in combination with CDGP.\n\nCDGP is not associated with increased mortality because it is a variant of normal growth rather than a disease. However, in some affected individuals, it can be associated with significant psychological stress, resulting in poor self-image and social withdrawal. In recent years, researchers have also found that individuals with CDGP may be at increased risk for reduced bone mass in adulthood because of the delay in sex steroid influence on bone accrual during adolescence.\n\nAlthough the epidemiologic data indicate that all variants of normal growth are twice as common in boys as in girls, referrals for short stature reflect an even more divergent sex ratio. This likely reflects greater concern about males who are shorter than their peers or who have delayed sexual development.\nNo racial bias has been identified. Patterns of growth consistent with CDGP occur in infants as young as 3–6 months. However, individuals often do not seek medical attention until puberty, when lack of sexual development becomes a concern and discrepancy in height from peers is magnified by the delay in pubertal growth spurt.\n\nIndividuals with constitutional delay of growth and puberty (CDGP) are usually of normal size at birth. Deceleration in both height and weight velocity typically occurs within the first 3–6 months of life. This shift downward is similar to that observed in infants experiencing normal lag-down growth but tends to be more severe and prolonged. Individual variation is substantial; however, most children resume a normal growth velocity by age 2–3 years. During childhood, these individuals grow along or parallel to the lower percentiles of the growth curve.\n\nSkeletal age, which is estimated from radiographic studies of the left hand and wrist, is usually delayed (typically 2-4 y by late childhood) and is most consistent with the child's height age (age for which a child's height is at the 50th percentile) rather than the child’s chronologic age. Because the timing of the onset of puberty, pubertal growth spurt, \nand epiphyseal fusion are determined by a child's skeletal age (biologic age), children with CDGP are often referred to as \"late bloomers.\"\nAt the usual age for puberty, these children continue to grow at a prepubertal rate appropriate for their biologic stage of development. Natural slowing of linear growth just before onset of puberty may be exaggerated, emphasizing the difference in size from peers who are accelerating in growth. The timing of the pubertal growth spurt is delayed, and the spurt may be prolonged with a lower peak height velocity. In patients with both CDGP and familial short stature, the degree of growth retardation may appear more severe, but the adult height is appropriate for the genetic background.\n\nPhysical examination findings in patients with CDGP are essentially normal, with the exception of immature appearance for age. Body proportions may reflect the delay in growth. During childhood, the upper-to-lower body ratio may be greater than normal, reflecting more infantile proportions. In adults, the ratio is often reduced (i.e., <1 in whites, <0.9 in blacks) as a result of the longer period of leg (long bone) growth.\n\nCDGP is thought to be inherited from multiple genes from both parents. The strong role of heredity is reflected in the 60-90% likelihood of this growth pattern in a family member of the same or opposite sex. A delay in the reactivation of the hypothalamic-pituitary pulse generator results in a later onset of puberty.\n\n\n"}

He first appeared in \"Captain America\" vol. 1 #310 (October 1985), created by writer Mark Gruenwald and artist Paul Neary. Burchell Clemens was artificially enhanced and given the ability to extend his jaw to over a foot and bite through solid materials such as concrete. He first showed up as part of the Serpent Society, often teaming up with Society member Asp. The team came into conflict with Captain America during a paid hit on MODOK After being arrested Society leader Sidewinder freed Cottonmouth and others from custody. When Viper took control of the Serpent Society Cottonmouth was one of the members who opposed her, siding with Captain America to take Viper down. Cottonmouth remained a member when the Serpent Society was reorganized as Serpent Solutions.\n\nOriginally from Mobile, Alabama, Cottonmouth was chosen by Sidewinder to join a snake-themed villain group, the Serpent Society. With the ability to extend his jaws over a foot wide, he was given steel fangs, possibly by the Roxxon Oil Company, which he uses to torture his victims in an almost cannibalistic way. His jaw muscles are superhumanly strong, and can bite with sufficient force to crush cinderblock or metals that are softer than iron. However, very little is known about his past, other than the fact that he was an active criminal in the southern portion of the United States.\n\nCottonmouth was often paired up with Asp, such as when the two were to advertise the Serpent Society to Kingpin. The Serpent Society was hired by A.I.M. to hunt down MODOK. During their confrontation with MODOK, Cottonmouth and teammate Death Adder were able to slay him, which was a big win for their organization. Cottonmouth also battled Captain America for the first time. They were soon defeated by Captain America, but were able to escape. He also participated in the mission to retrieve the retired Porcupine's costume, which turned out to be a trap by Captain America. Cottonmouth was injured during the battle, his teeth being destroyed by the star-spangled hero's shield. He, along with teammates Rattler and Death Adder were eventually defeated and taken into custody. Not for long, however, as Sidewinder soon teleported them to safety. Cottonmouth and Rattler next confronted the Kingpin's men over Death Adder's murder.\n\nDuring the Viper's invasion, Cottonmouth sided with Diamondback and the other members who refused to take the leadership away from Sidewinder. He later betrayed Diamondback, attempting to bite her head off after she saved him, proving that his loyalties lied with Viper. He fought Steve Rogers as The Captain during this confrontation. Cottonmouth participated in the Serpent Society's mission to recover mystic objects for Ghaur and Llyra, and battled Psylocke and Storm of the X-Men. He voted against Diamondback during the Serpent Society's trial against her. Alongside the Serpent Society, he combatted Captain America. Paladin, and Diamondback.\n\nHe has also battled other super-heroes such as Black Panther and Luke Cage. He was eventually imprisoned, but escaped with Hawkeye, Plant-Man, and Headlok in Thunderbolts. He took Bushmaster's real name, Quincy McIver though his actual name has not been revealed.\n\nCottonmouth was later tracked down by American Eagle in Arizona. Several Serpent Society members including Anaconda, Black Mamba, Bushmaster and Cottonmouth, fought members of the New Avengers in a semi-tropical locale. Cottonmouth was defeated by Wolverine.\n\nCottonmouth has been seen working with the Serpent Society on several occasions. During an encounter with Deadpool, Cottonmouth was shot in the skull. He somehow recovered, as he was seen robbing a bank with the Society, where he was defeated by mutant Hope Summers.\n\nAs part of the \"All-New, All-Different Marvel\" event, Cottonmouth appears as a member of Viper's Serpent Society under its new name Serpent Solutions. He alongside Black Racer and Copperhead attacked Captain America and Diamondback where Captain America learned too late that Diamondback is a member of Serpent Solutions where she knocks him out and brings him to Serpent Solutions' headquarters.\n\nDuring the \"Opening Salvo\" part of the \"Secret Empire\" storyline, Cottonmouth (along with Serpent Solutions) is recruited by Baron Helmut Zemo to join his Army of Evil.\n\nDue to bionic reconstruction, Cottonmouth possesses enhanced jaw and neck muscles, and steel teeth enabling him to bite with sufficient force to crush cinderblock or deform metals softer than iron, hang from a rope by his teeth for up to an hour, and to open his mouth larger than the size of a human head.\n\n\n\n"}

Born and raised in the United States, Berger was a lawyer by education and had emigrated to Israel after taking part in the 1969 Maccabiah Games.\n\nDavid Mark Berger was born in Cleveland, Ohio on May 24, 1944. His mother was Dorothy Berger, (née Davidson), and his father was Benjamin Berger, who was a well known physician. A high school honors student as well as an athlete, Berger graduated from Shaker Heights High School in 1962. He attended Tulane University in New Orleans from 1962 to 1966 where he was an honors student. While studying at Tulane, he continued weightlifting training at the New Orleans Athletic Club. As a junior at Tulane, he won the NCAA weightlifting title in the 148-pound class. Berger earned a bachelor's degree in psychology from Tulane in 1966. He went on to enroll in a combined MBA-law degree program at Columbia University in New York, from which he graduated in 1969. While working toward his degrees, Berger continued to devote time to weightlifting, training at the McBurney YMCA in Midtown Manhattan. During his time in New York, Berger competed in the middleweight division. In 1968, competing as a middleweight, he finished fourth in the U.S. Olympic trials. His father, Benjamin, was once quoted as saying, \"I used to tell him ‘You may not be the best weightlifter in the world, but you’re certainly the smartest!’\"\n\nAfter winning a gold medal in the middleweight weight-lifting contest in the 1969 Maccabiah Games, Berger emigrated to Israel, intending to open a law office in Tel Aviv after completing his compulsory military service. Berger continued competing in weightlifting, but moved up in body weight to the lightheavy class. He won a silver medal at the 1971 Asian Weightlifting Championships, and achieved a long time dream when he was chosen to represent Israel as a member of the 1972 Israeli Olympic team. In late August of that year, Berger flew to Munich with his teammates. On September 2, 1972, Berger competed, but was eliminated in an early round. He died in the Munich massacre four days later when Palestinian terrorists invaded the Olympic village and held the Israeli team hostage.\n\nEarly on the morning of September 5, 1972, Palestinian terrorists took Berger and his five roommates hostage, after having earlier seized six officials in another apartment as well as wounding wrestling coach Moshe Weinberg in the face. While the athletes were being moved to the first apartment, Weinberg grappled with the intruders, allowing flyweight wrestler Gad Tsobari to escape but resulting in Weinberg’s death by gunfire. As the remaining hostages and terrorists entered the officials’ apartment, weightlifter Yossef Romano also attempted to overpower the intruders. Romano was cut nearly in half by automatic fire (his corpse was left all day at the feet of the hostages, who were tied to beds), and Berger was shot in his left shoulder, a wound seen by German officials later in the day. It is believed that Berger, being physically one of the largest of the hostages, was also beaten in order to intimidate the other hostages.\n\nAfter all-day negotiations, the terrorists and their tied-up hostages were transferred from the Olympic Village via helicopter to Fürstenfeldbruck airbase outside of Munich, where the terrorists believed they would be flown to a friendly Arab nation. Instead, the German border guards and Munich police attempted to ambush the terrorists and free the hostages. After a two-hour gunfight, one of the terrorists turned on the helicopter in which Berger was sitting and sprayed it with machine-gun fire. The other three hostages in the helicopter were killed instantly, but somehow Berger only received two non-lethal wounds in his legs. However, the terrorist then detonated a hand grenade inside the helicopter, causing a huge explosion and fire. An autopsy found that Berger had died of smoke inhalation. The five hostages in the other helicopter were all shot to death by another terrorist.\n\nWhile the 10 other Israeli Olympians were flown to and buried in Israel, David Berger’s body was returned to the United States on an Air Force jet personally ordered by President Richard Nixon. Berger is buried at the Mayfield Cemetery in his hometown of Cleveland.\n\n\n\n"}

At the time of his death, Bennett was considered to be the \"most famous mascot in the world\".\n\nBennett was born in Flatbush, Brooklyn. When Bennett was very young, he received a spine injury suffered in a baby carriage incident. That injury left Bennett with a hunchbacked back and restricted his growth, by the time he was an adult he was considered a dwarf. Bennett's parents died in the 1918 flu epidemic, and Bennett, needing a job, convinced Chicago White Sox outfielder Happy Felsch that he had \"mystical powers\" that could bring good luck to everyone that uses him. He became Felsch's personal mascot and when Felsch play improved, he moved on to become the White Sox personal mascot in 1919. The club won the pennant that year with Bennett sitting on the bench with the players. During the 1919 World Series, eight members of the White Sox, including Felsch decided to throw the World Series. A scandal erupted which later led those eight players receiving lifetime bans from baseball and Bennett left the team to join his hometown Brooklyn Robins. The Robins won the pennant in 1920, but after participating in the first three World Series games both the second and third being Robins victories, Bennett wasn't invited to join the team at Cleveland. The Robins went on to lose their next four games, and the series to the Indians. He soon left the team citing \"lack of trust\". \n\nAt the age of 18, Bennett became the bat boy for the New York Yankees on the request of Yankees owner Jacob Ruppert. He was considered to be a \"good luck charm\" by the members of the club, and became a well-known celebrity in New York. Each year, he went down to Florida to join the Yankees spring training. He became one of Babe Ruth's closest friends on the team, and they played catch on the field nearly every game. A close confidant of manager Miller Huggins, Bennett usually sat next to Huggins during Yankees games, pointing out issues he noticed on the field, a predecessor of a bench coach in today's baseball.\n\nOn May 19, 1932, Bennett was hit by a taxi on a New York City street. He suffered a broken leg and other injuries from which he never recovered. To find relief from the pain he suffered from the injuries, Bennett started to abuse alcohol. He was forced to retire as the Yankees mascot in the middle of 1933 season, although Ruppert insisted he remain on the payroll all year. \"The New York Times\" reported that the \"notoriously superstitious\" ballplayers and fans blamed Bennett's absence on the Yankees' failure to win the pennant in 1933 and 1934.\n\nIn January 1935, Bennett died penniless in his room at a lodging house at 115 W. 84th Street in Manhattan, age 31. The coroner ruled the cause of death as alcoholism; according to his landlady, Bennett had told her that drinking was the only relief from his chronic pain. He had no known relatives and had been scheduled to be buried in a pauper's grave until Ruppert paid for his funeral and burial. Ruppert and general manager Ed Barrow were not able to attend the service but sent flowers. The entire Yankee front office staff of Paul Krichell, Gene McCann, Mark Roth, George Perry, and Charlie McManus accompanied Bennett's body from the funeral parlor to St. Gregory the Great Church for the service and on to St. John's Cemetery in Queens for burial. No player attended the service despite being it being the off-season.\n\nBennett's life was mentioned by billionaire Warren Buffett during his annual stockholder report in 2002, saying that Bennett was a key role model during Buffett's career in investing, naming him a \"winner at every costs\".\n"}

{"id": "997173", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=997173", "title": "Electromyography", "text": "Electromyography\n\nElectromyography (EMG) is an electrodiagnostic medicine technique for evaluating and recording the electrical activity produced by skeletal muscles. EMG is performed using an instrument called an electromyograph to produce a record called an electromyogram. An electromyograph detects the electric potential generated by muscle cells when these cells are electrically or neurologically activated. The signals can be analyzed to detect medical abnormalities, activation level, or recruitment order, or to analyze the biomechanics of human or animal movement.\n\nEMG testing has a variety of clinical and biomedical applications. EMG is used as a diagnostics tool for identifying neuromuscular diseases, or as a research tool for studying kinesiology, and disorders of motor control. EMG signals are sometimes used to guide botulinum toxin or phenol injections into muscles. EMG signals are also used as a control signal for prosthetic devices such as prosthetic hands, arms, and lower limbs.\n\nAn acceleromyograph may be used for neuromuscular monitoring in general anesthesia with neuromuscular-blocking drugs, in order to avoid postoperative residual curarization (PORC).\n\nExcept in the case of some purely primary myopathic conditions EMG is usually performed with another electrodiagnostic medicine test that measures the conducting function of nerves. This is called nerve conduction studies (NCS). Needle EMG and NCSs are typically indicated when there is pain in the limbs, weakness from spinal nerve compression, or concern about some other neurologic injury or disorder. Spinal nerve injury does not cause neck, mid back pain or low back pain, and for this reason, evidence has not shown EMG or NCS to be helpful in diagnosing causes of axial lumbar pain, thoracic pain, or cervical spine pain. Needle EMG may aid with the diagnosis of nerve compression or injury (such as carpal tunnel syndrome), nerve root injury (such as sciatica), and with other problems of the muscles or nerves. Less common medical conditions include amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, myasthenia gravis, and muscular dystrophy.\n\nThe first step before insertion of the needle electrode is skin preparation. This typically involves simply cleaning the skin with an alcohol pad.\n\nThe actual placement of the needle electrode can be difficult and depends on a number of factors, such as specific muscle selection and the size of that muscle. Proper needle EMG placement is very important for accurate representation of the muscle of interest, although EMG is more effective on superficial muscles as it is unable to bypass the action potentials of superficial muscles and detect deeper muscles. Also, the more body fat an individual has, the weaker the EMG signal. When placing the EMG sensor, the ideal location is at the belly of the muscle: the longitudinal midline. The belly of the muscle can also be thought of as in-between the motor point (middle) of the muscle and the tendonus insertion point.\n\nCardiac pacemakers and implanted cardiac defibrillators (ICDs) are used increasingly in clinical practice, and no evidence exists indicating that performing routine electrodiagnostic studies on patients with these devices pose a safety hazard. However, there are theoretical concerns that electrical impulses of nerve conduction studies (NCS) could be erroneously sensed by devices and result in unintended inhibition or triggering of output or reprogramming of the device. In general, the closer the stimulation site is to the pacemaker and pacing leads, the greater the chance for inducing a voltage of sufficient amplitude to inhibit the pacemaker. Despite such concerns, no immediate or delayed adverse effects have been reported with routine NCS.\n\nNo known contraindications exist for performing needle EMG or NCS on pregnant patients. Additionally, no complications from these procedures have been reported in the literature. Evoked potential testing, likewise, has not been reported to cause any problems when it is performed during pregnancy.\n\nPatients with lymphedema or patients at risk for lymphedema are routinely cautioned to avoid percutaneous procedures in the affected extremity, namely venipuncture, to prevent development or worsening of lymphedema or cellulitis. Despite the potential risk, the evidence for such complications subsequent to venipuncture is limited. No published reports exist of cellulitis, infection, or other complications related to EMG performed in the setting of lymphedema or prior lymph node dissection. However, given the unknown risk of cellulitis in patients with lymphedema, reasonable caution should be exercised in performing needle examinations in lymphedematous regions to avoid complications. In patients with gross edema and taut skin, skin puncture by needle electrodes may result in chronic weeping of serous fluid. The potential bacterial media of such serous fluid and the violation of skin integrity may increase the risk of cellulitis. Before proceeding, the physician should weigh the potential risks of performing the study with the need to obtain the information gained.\n\nThere are two kinds of EMG: surface EMG and intramuscular EMG. Surface EMG assesses muscle function by recording muscle activity from the surface above the muscle on the skin. Surface electrodes are able to provide only a limited assessment of the muscle activity. Surface EMG can be recorded by a pair of electrodes or by a more complex array of multiple electrodes. More than one electrode is needed because EMG recordings display the potential difference (voltage difference) between two separate electrodes. Limitations of this approach are the fact that surface electrode recordings are restricted to superficial muscles, are influenced by the depth of the subcutaneous tissue at the site of the recording which can be highly variable depending of the weight of a patient, and cannot reliably discriminate between the discharges of adjacent muscles.\n\nIntramuscular EMG can be performed using a variety of different types of recording electrodes. The simplest approach is a monopolar needle electrode. This can be a fine wire inserted into a muscle with a surface electrode as a reference; or two fine wires inserted into muscle referenced to each other. Most commonly fine wire recordings are for research or kinesiology studies. Diagnostic monopolar EMG electrodes are typically insulated and stiff enough to penetrate skin, with only the tip exposed using a surface electrode for reference. Needles for injecting therapeutic botulinum toxin or phenol are typically monopolar electrodes that use a surface reference, in this case, however, the metal shaft of a hypodermic needle, insulated so that only the tip is exposed, is used both to record signals and to inject. Slightly more complex in design is the concentric needle electrode. These needles have a fine wire, embedded in a layer of insulation that fills the barrel of a hypodermic needle, that has an exposed shaft, and the shaft serves as the reference electrode. The exposed tip of the fine wire serves as the active electrode. As a result of this configuration, signals tend to be smaller when recorded from a concentric electrode than when recorded from a monopolar electrode and they are more resistant to electrical artifacts from tissue and measurements tend to be somewhat more reliable. However, because the shaft is exposed throughout its length, superficial muscle activity can contaminate the recording of deeper muscles. Single fiber EMG needle electrodes are designed to have very tiny recording areas, and allow for the discharges of individual muscle fibers to be discriminated.\n\nTo perform intramuscular EMG, typically either a monopolar or concentric needle electrode is inserted through the skin into the muscle tissue. The needle is then moved to multiple spots within a relaxed muscle to evaluate both insertional activity and resting activity in the muscle. Normal muscles exhibit a brief burst of muscle fiber activation when stimulated by needle movement, but this rarely lasts more than 100ms. The two most common pathologic types of resting activity in muscle are fasciculation and fibrillation potentials. A fasciculation potential is an involuntary activation of a motor unit within the muscle, sometimes visible with the naked eye as a muscle twitch or by surface electrodes. Fibrillations, however, are only detected by needle EMG, and represent the isolated activation of individual muscle fibers, usually as the result of nerve or muscle disease. Often, fibrillations are triggered by needle movement (insertional activity) and persist for several seconds or more after the movement ceases.\n\nAfter assessing resting and insertional activity, the electromyographer assess the activity of muscle during voluntary contraction. The shape, size, and frequency of the resulting electrical signals are judged. Then the electrode is retracted a few millimetres, and again the activity is analyzed. This is repeated, sometimes until data on 10–20 motor units have been collected in order to draw conclusions about motor unit function. Each electrode track gives only a very local picture of the activity of the whole muscle. Because skeletal muscles differ in the inner structure, the electrode has to be placed at various locations to obtain an accurate study.\n\nSingle fiber electromyography assesses the delay between the contractions of individual muscle fibers within a motor unit and is a sensitive test for dysfunction of the neuromuscular junction caused by drugs, poisons, or diseases such as myasthenia gravis. The technique is complicated and typically only performed by individuals with special advanced training. \n\nSurface EMG is used in a number of settings; for example, in the physiotherapy clinic, muscle activation is monitored using surface EMG and patients have an auditory or visual stimulus to help them know when they are activating the muscle (biofeedback). A review of the literature on surface EMG published in 2008, concluded that surface EMG may be useful to detect the presence of neuromuscular disease (level C rating, class III data), but there are insufficient data to support its utility for distinguishing between neuropathic and myopathic conditions or for the diagnosis of specific neuromuscular diseases. EMGs may be useful for additional study of fatigue associated with post-poliomyelitis syndrome and electromechanical function in myotonic dystrophy (level C rating, class III data).\n\nCertain US states limit the performance of needle EMG by nonphysicians. New Jersey declared that it cannot be delegated to a physician's assistant. Michigan has passed legislation saying needle EMG is the practice of medicine. Special training in diagnosing medical diseases with EMG is required only in residency and fellowship programs in neurology, clinical neurophysiology, neuromuscular medicine, and physical medicine and rehabilitation. There are certain subspecialists in otolaryngology who have had selective training in performing EMG of the laryngeal muscles, and subspecialists in urology, obstetrics and gynecology who have had selective training in performing EMG of muscles controlling bowel and bladder function.\n\nOne basic function of EMG is to see how well a muscle can be activated. The most common way that can be determined is by performing a maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) of the muscle that is being tested.\n\nMuscle force, which is measured mechanically, typically correlates highly with measures of EMG activation of muscle. Most commonly this is assessed with surface electrodes, but it should be recognized that these typically only record from muscle fibers in close approximation to the surface.\n\nSeveral analytical methods for determining muscle activation are commonly used depending on the application. The use of mean EMG activation or the peak contraction value is a debated topic. Most studies commonly use the maximal voluntary contraction as a means of analyzing peak force and force generated by target muscles. According to the article, Peak and average rectified EMG measures: Which method of data reduction should be used for assessing core training exercises?, concluded that the “average rectified EMG data (ARV) is significantly less variable when measuring the muscle activity of the core musculature compared to the peak EMG variable.” Therefore, these researchers would suggest that “ARV EMG data should be recorded alongside the peak EMG measure when assessing core exercises.” Providing the reader with both sets of data would result in enhanced validity of the study and potentially eradicate the contradictions within the research.\n\nEMG can also be used for indicating the amount of fatigue in a muscle. The following changes in the EMG signal can signify muscle fatigue: an increase in the mean absolute value of the signal, increase in the amplitude and duration of the muscle action potential and an overall shift to lower frequencies. Monitoring the changes of different frequency changes the most common way of using EMG to determine levels of fatigue. The lower conduction velocities enable the slower motor neurons to remain active.\n\nA motor unit is defined as one motor neuron and all of the muscle fibers it innervates. When a motor unit fires, the impulse (called an action potential) is carried down the motor neuron to the muscle. The area where the nerve contacts the muscle is called the neuromuscular junction, or the motor end plate. After the action potential is transmitted across the neuromuscular junction, an action potential is elicited in all of the innervated muscle fibers of that particular motor unit. The sum of all this electrical activity is known as a motor unit action potential (MUAP). This electrophysiologic activity from multiple motor units is the signal typically evaluated during an EMG. The composition of the motor unit, the number of muscle fibres per motor unit, the metabolic type of muscle fibres and many other factors affect the shape of the motor unit potentials in the myogram.\n\nNerve conduction testing is also often done at the same time as an EMG to diagnose neurological diseases.\n\nSome patients can find the procedure somewhat painful, whereas others experience only a small amount of discomfort when the needle is inserted. The muscle or muscles being tested may be slightly sore for a day or two after the procedure.\n\nEMG signals are essentially made up of superimposed motor unit action potentials (MUAPs) from several motor units. For a thorough analysis, the measured EMG signals can be decomposed into their constituent MUAPs. MUAPs from different motor units tend to have different characteristic shapes, while MUAPs recorded by the same electrode from the same motor unit are typically similar. Notably MUAP size and shape depend on where the electrode is located with respect to the fibers and so can appear to be different if the electrode moves position. EMG decomposition is non-trivial, although many methods have been proposed.\n\nRectification is the translation of the raw EMG signal to a signal with a single polarity, usually positive. The purpose of rectifying the signal is to ensure the signal does not average to zero, due to the raw EMG signal having positive and negative components. Two types of rectification are used: full-wave and half-wave rectification. Full-wave rectification adds the EMG signal below the baseline to the signal above the baseline to make a conditioned signal that is all positive. If the baseline is zero, this is equivalent to taking the absolute value of the signal. This is the preferred method of rectification because it conserves all of the signal energy for analysis. Half-wave rectification discards the portion of the EMG signal that is below the baseline. In doing so, the average of the data is no longer zero therefore it can be used in statistical analyses.\n\nNeedle EMG used in clinical settings has practical applications such as helping to discover disease. Needle EMG has limitations, however, in that it does involve voluntary activation of muscle, and as such is less informative in patients unwilling or unable to cooperate, children and infants, and in individuals with paralysis., Surface EMG can have limited applications due to inherent problems associated with surface EMG. Adipose tissue (fat) can affect EMG recordings. Studies show that as adipose tissue increased the active muscle directly below the surface decreased. As adipose tissue increased, the amplitude of the surface EMG signal directly above the center of the active muscle decreased. EMG signal recordings are typically more accurate with individuals who have lower body fat, and more compliant skin, such as young people when compared to old. Muscle cross talk occurs when the EMG signal from one muscle interferes with that of another limiting reliability of the signal of the muscle being tested. Surface EMG is limited due to lack of deep muscles reliability. Deep muscles require intramuscular wires that are intrusive and painful in order to achieve an EMG signal. Surface EMG can only measure superficial muscles and even then it is hard to narrow down the signal to a single muscle.\n\nThe electrical source is the muscle membrane potential of about –90 mV. Measured EMG potentials range between less than 50 μV and up to 30 mV, depending on the muscle under observation.\n\nTypical repetition rate of muscle motor unit firing is about 7–20 Hz, depending on the size of the muscle (eye muscles versus seat (gluteal) muscles), previous axonal damage and other factors. Damage to motor units can be expected at ranges between 450 and 780 mV.\n\nMuscle tissue at rest is normally electrically inactive. After the electrical activity caused by the irritation of needle insertion subsides, the electromyograph should detect no abnormal spontaneous activity (i.e., a muscle at rest should be electrically silent, with the exception of the area of the neuromuscular junction, which is, under normal circumstances, very spontaneously active). When the muscle is voluntarily contracted, action potentials begin to appear. As the strength of the muscle contraction is increased, more and more muscle fibers produce action potentials. When the muscle is fully contracted, there should appear a disorderly group of action potentials of varying rates and amplitudes (a complete recruitment and interference pattern).\n\nEMG findings vary with the type of disorder, the duration of the problem, the age of the patient, the degree to which the patient can be cooperative, the type of needle electrode used to study the patient, and sampling error in terms of the number of areas studied within a single muscle and the number of muscles studied overall. Interpreting EMG findings is usually best done by an individual informed by a focused history and physical examination of the patient, and in conjunction with the results of other relevant diagnostic studies performed including most importantly, nerve conduction studies, but also, where appropriate, imaging studies such as MRI and ultrasound, muscle and nerve biopsy, muscle enzymes, and serologic studies.\n\nAbnormal results may be caused by the following medical conditions (please note this is not an exhaustive list of conditions that can result in abnormal EMG studies):\n\nDisorders of Muscle:\nDisorders of the neuromuscular junction: \n\nDisorders of Nerves:\n\nPlexus disorders: \n\nRoot disorders: \n\nMotor neuron disease\nThe first documented experiments dealing with EMG started with Francesco Redi’s works in 1666. Redi discovered a highly specialized muscle of the electric ray fish (Electric Eel) generated electricity. By 1773, Walsh had been able to demonstrate that the eel fish’s muscle tissue could generate a spark of electricity. In 1792, a publication entitled \"De Viribus Electricitatis in Motu Musculari Commentarius\" appeared, written by Luigi Galvani, in which the author demonstrated that electricity could initiate muscle contraction. Six decades later, in 1849, Emil du Bois-Reymond discovered that it was also possible to record electrical activity during a voluntary muscle contraction. The first actual recording of this activity was made by Marey in 1890, who also introduced the term electromyography. In 1922, Gasser and Erlanger used an oscilloscope to show the electrical signals from muscles. Because of the stochastic nature of the myoelectric signal, only rough information could be obtained from its observation. The capability of detecting electromyographic signals improved steadily from the 1930s through the 1950s, and researchers began to use improved electrodes more widely for the study of muscles. The AANEM was formed in 1953 as one of several currently active medical societies with a special interest in advancing the science and clinical use of the technique. Clinical use of surface EMG (sEMG) for the treatment of more specific disorders began in the 1960s. Hardyck and his researchers were the first (1966) practitioners to use sEMG. In the early 1980s, Cram and Steger introduced a clinical method for scanning a variety of muscles using an EMG sensing device.\n\nIt was not until the middle of the 1980s that integration techniques in electrodes had sufficiently advanced to allow batch production of the required small and lightweight instrumentation and amplifiers. At present, a number of suitable amplifiers are commercially available. In the early 1980s, cables that produced signals in the desired microvolt range became available. Recent research has resulted in a better understanding of the properties of surface EMG recording. Surface electromyography is increasingly used for recording from superficial muscles in clinical or kinesiological protocols, where intramuscular electrodes are used for investigating deep muscles or localized muscle activity.\n\nThere are many applications for the use of EMG. EMG is used clinically for the diagnosis of neurological and neuromuscular problems. It is used diagnostically by gait laboratories and by clinicians trained in the use of biofeedback or ergonomic assessment. EMG is also used in many types of research laboratories, including those involved in biomechanics, motor control, neuromuscular physiology, movement disorders, postural control, and physical therapy.\n\nEMG can be used to sense isometric muscular activity where no movement is produced. This enables definition of a class of subtle motionless gestures to control interfaces without being noticed and without disrupting the surrounding environment. These signals can be used to control a prosthesis or as a control signal for an electronic device such as a mobile phone or PDA .\n\nEMG signals have been targeted as control for flight systems. The Human Senses Group at the NASA Ames Research Center at Moffett Field, CA seeks to advance man-machine interfaces by directly connecting a person to a computer. In this project, an EMG signal is used to substitute for mechanical joysticks and keyboards. EMG has also been used in research towards a \"wearable cockpit,\" which employs EMG-based gestures to manipulate switches and control sticks necessary for flight in conjunction with a goggle-based display.\n\nUnvoiced speech recognition recognizes speech by observing the EMG activity of muscles associated with speech. It is targeted for use in noisy environments, and may be helpful for people without vocal cords and people with aphasia.\n\nEMG has also been used as a control signal for computers and other devices. An interface device based on EMG could be used to control moving objects, such as mobile robots or an electric wheelchair. This may be helpful for individuals that cannot operate a joystick-controlled wheelchair. Surface EMG recordings may also be a suitable control signal for some interactive video games.\n\nIn 1999 an EMG program called Echidna was used to enable a man with locked in syndrome to send a message to a computer. That program, now called NeuroSwitch, developed by Control Bionics enables people with severe disabilities to communicate by text, email, SMS, computer-generated voice and to control computer games and programs, and - through the internet - Anybots telepresence robots.\n\nA joint project involving Microsoft, the University of Washington in Seattle, and the University of Toronto in Canada has explored using muscle signals from hand gestures as an interface device. A patent based on this research was submitted on June 26, 2008.\n\n\n\n"}

He attended the University of Chicago as both an undergraduate and a master's student in Chinese studies, receiving his M.A. in 1954. While still a student in 1952, he married his first wife, Carolina (Carol) Borja Feldman, a classmate at the University of Chicago. Their marriage ended in divorce. After their divorce, she died in 1981. He married his second wife Laura Sherman in 1976.\n\nFeldman served in Hong Kong for eight years, Taiwan for six, and Japan for four years. As a member of the Policy Planning Staff of the State Department, he helped plan U.S. president Richard Nixon's first visit to China in 1972. He continued involvement with the process of relations with China when he became the Director of the Office of Republic of China Affairs in September 1977. In that capacity, he and Lee Marks began to draft the Taiwan Relations Act at the request of Richard Holbrooke; the act would be passed into law in 1979. He also created the American Institute in Taiwan which replaced the U.S. embassy in Taipei after relations were shifted to Beijing. On August 2, 1979, he was appointed to the position of U.S. ambassador to Papua New Guinea and the Solomon Islands, resident in Port Moresby, the capital of PNG; he held that position until May 25, 1981. He later served as an alternative U.S. representative to the United Nations, an ambassadorial-rank position and his final role in the State Department. He retired in 1986.\n\nAfter his retirement, Feldman continued his involvement with China affairs. In 1989, he met with then-ROC president Lee Teng-hui and advised him on potential strategies for helping the ROC to regain membership in the United Nations. In 1994, he became a fellow in China Policy of The Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank. In 2007, he spoke out against remarks by United States National Security Council Senior Director for Asian Affairs Dennis Wilder stating that \"Taiwan, or the Republic of China, is not at this point a state in the international community\"; Feldman responded that U.S. government had no basis under law to oppose ROC membership in international bodies.\n\nOutside of his China-related activities, Feldman was also a board member of the Jewish Institute for National Security Affairs and a partner in consultancy firm Global Business Access. He died on February 24, 2009 at the age of 77 due to complications from aortic dissection. He was survived by two sons from his marriage to Carol Borja Feldman (Chris Feldman and Peter Feldman), as well as his second wife Laura Sherman and their son Alex Feldman, as well as a sister, three grandchildren, and two great-granddaughters.\n\n"}

This altercation became the most penalized on-court fight in the NBA since the Pacers–Pistons brawl from two years before.\n\nThe fight began with a flagrant foul by Knicks guard Mardy Collins on Nuggets guard J. R. Smith in the closing seconds of the game. Several players joined in the confrontation, and began to make physical contact. The fight briefly spilled into the stands, and also stretched to the other end of the court. All ten players on the floor at the time were ejected after the altercation was finished. When suspensions were announced, seven players were suspended without pay for a combined total of 47 games.\n\nAlthough they were not penalized, Nuggets coach George Karl and Knicks coach Isiah Thomas were both scrutinized for their part in the brawl. Carmelo Anthony was also criticized for harming his image as a star, and several writers said the league had penalized the players excessively because it wanted to keep its image free from violence.\n\nEntering the game, the New York Knicks had a record of 9–17 while the Denver Nuggets sported a 13–9 record. Despite trailing the entire game, the Knicks came as close as 2 points in the first half but the Nuggets regrouped and closed the half with a 13-point advantage and continued to lead in the second half by as much as 26 points in the third quarter. The Knicks briefly came within 10 points with ten minutes left in the game, but the Nuggets went on a 12–2 run and were never threatened again. Carmelo Anthony scored 24 points to lead the Nuggets, and Marcus Camby added 24 points and 9 rebounds; Stephon Marbury scored a season-high 31 points for the Knicks.\n\nThe incident occurred with 1:15 remaining in the Knicks' home game at Madison Square Garden, where the Nuggets were leading 119–100. The Knicks' Mardy Collins fouled the Nuggets' J. R. Smith on a fast break by slapping his arms around Smith's neck, knocking him to the floor. As Smith stood up to confront Collins, Nate Robinson pulled Smith away, and then began pushing and shouting at him. David Lee tried to hold Smith back, but Smith broke free and charged into Robinson, causing both players to fall into the photographers and front row courtside seats, before they were quickly separated by teammates.\n\nAs the fighting was seemingly coming to an end, Carmelo Anthony confronted Collins and punched him in the face, knocking him to the ground. Jared Jeffries immediately tried to attack Anthony but tripped over Marcus Camby, before being restrained by coaches and teammates, while Anthony backed up towards the Nuggets' bench. Collins also ran down the court to get at Anthony but was blocked by Nenê and Smith. All ten players on the court at the time of the incident were ejected by the officiating crew that consisted of Dick Bavetta, Violet Palmer, and Robbie Robinson. No fans came onto the court during the entire ordeal, which prevented any repetition of the Pacers–Pistons brawl from 2 years ago.\n\nNBA commissioner David Stern reacted with strict penalties for the players involved, stating, \"It is our obligation to take the strongest possible steps to avoid such failures in the future.\" Seven players were suspended for a total of 47 games, and the players lost in excess of $1.2 million in salary. Each team was also fined $500,000.\n\nBecause Anthony's suspension was longer than 12 games, he was eligible to appeal to an arbitrator; however, Anthony eventually announced he would not attempt one, saying he did not \"want to be a further distraction\".\n\nSeveral sportswriters said the brawl was not as violent as the Pacers–Pistons brawl two years before, and 81% of respondents in a SportsNation poll said the biggest difference between the two brawls was that it \"didn't involve players going into the stands and fighting fans\". However, MSNBC's Michael Ventre said that the Knicks and Nuggets brawl was worse because \"it was touched off by the actions of players, and it escalated because of them.\" Several writers said that the penalties were more severe because of the Pacers–Pistons brawl, because the league was on a \"very serious image-cleanup campaign.\"\n\nSteve Francis claimed that the media reaction to the fight and the suspensions itself were \"racially motivated.\" He argued that Major League Baseball and the National Hockey League had \"incidents that are way worse than basketball,\" but did not face the scrutiny that the NBA received \"because there are more black players in the NBA.\" This was echoed by several writers, and sportswriter-television personality Michael Wilbon said that \"NBA players have endured more scrutiny, pertaining to image, than any other professional athletes in America.\" Martin Luther King III called for a meeting to end the violence in the NBA, stating, \"Individuals who play a game should be able to conduct themselves appropriately.\" However, the NBA said through a spokesman that they \"don't think that meeting is necessary.\"\n\nMinutes before the brawl started, Knicks coach Isiah Thomas asked Carmelo Anthony not to go into the painted area around the basket, despite the fact that they were not members of the same team. Thomas later said that because Denver head coach George Karl kept his team's starting players on the court for the closing minutes of the game, which Thomas thought showed a lack of sportsmanship, his orders to Anthony were to \"show some class.\" However, Karl responded by saying the brawl \"was directed by Isiah\".\n\nThomas was not penalized after the brawl, as an NBA investigation ruled that they did not have \"adequate evidence upon which to make a determination,\" but several writers criticized the NBA for not including Thomas in the suspensions. ESPN analyst Marc Stein called Thomas' explanations of his comments \"laughable,\" and commentator Greg Anthony, a former Knicks player, said he \"never had a coach say that to an opponent.\" It was also suggested that Thomas was attempting to resurrect the physical tactics of his former team, the \"Bad Boy\" Pistons.\n\nIn response to Thomas saying that keeping the Nuggets starters on the floor in the final minutes of the game was unsportsmanlike, Karl said that he \"never thought about running up the score,\" and only wanted to \"get a big win on the road.\" However, several sportswriters criticized his decision, and some said that he should also have been penalized. It was also suggested that Karl was trying to humiliate Thomas due to the perception that Thomas had mistreated Larry Brown, a friend of Karl's. Karl was also blamed for putting his players in a position to start a fight.\n\nThe day following the brawl, Anthony issued a statement and apology to his family, the league, and fans. He also specifically apologized to Mardy Collins, whom he directly struck during the incident. At the time of the brawl, Anthony was the league's leading scorer; his suspension was also the longest of the players suspended, and the sixth-longest in NBA history. According to former NBA player Steve Kerr, Anthony had \"tarnished\" his image, and basketball analyst Ric Bucher said that Anthony had \"torched his own career\". Sports Illustrated writer Marty Burns said that Anthony faced becoming known by sports fans across America as the player who punched Collins in the face and then ran away. An example of the backlash was Northwest Airlines pulling Anthony from its in-flight magazine cover, as it said it did not want \"to condone the behavior of Anthony\".\n\nA day after Anthony was suspended, Denver acquired Allen Iverson, who was then second in the league in scoring behind Anthony. After Anthony and Smith returned from their suspensions, the trio led the Nuggets to 45 wins and the sixth seed in the Western Conference for the playoffs. However, they were eliminated in the first round by the San Antonio Spurs. The Knicks finished 33–49, 12th in the Eastern Conference, and did not make the playoffs.\n\nThe two teams faced each other for the first time since the altercation on November 17, 2007, which the Nuggets won 115–83. Opposing players Renaldo Balkman and Linas Kleiza began arguing with each other after Balkman was called for a hard foul on Kleiza, but the incident was defused after Balkman was given a technical foul. Iverson, Anthony, and Marcus Camby were all removed early in the fourth quarter. Balkman and Kleiza later became teammates after Balkman was traded to the Nuggets in the 2008 off-season.\n\nAs of the 2010–11 season, of the seven suspended players, three were still with their respective teams. Mardy Collins was traded to the Los Angeles Clippers in 2008. Jerome James was traded to the Chicago Bulls a year later, but never played for the Bulls as he suffered a torn Achilles tendon. Jeffries and Robinson were traded at the 2010 trade deadline to the Houston Rockets and Boston Celtics, respectively. Robinson then signed a multi-year deal with the Denver Nuggets on July 26, 2013. Carmelo Anthony was traded to the Knicks before the 2011 trade deadline. Meanwhile, Jeffries' contract was bought out by the Rockets and he rejoined the Knicks. In addition, J.R. Smith was signed by the Knicks in February of the 2012 season, which will make him the second former Nugget involved in the brawl to join the Knicks. Though not directly involved in the brawl, 2006 Nuggets C/PF Marcus Camby also joined the Knicks during the 2012 off-season, making him the third 2006 Nugget to join the Knicks for the 2012-2013 season. Also not directly involved in the brawl, PF Kenyon Martin joined the Knicks on February 21, 2013 (initially on a 10-day contract), making him the 4th member of the 2012-2013 Knicks to have been on the '06 Nuggets team.\n\n"}

Ashraf was confirmed to have been fatally shot in the back of her head killing her on the scene. Her funeral was held on March 29, 2014 in Estanhaa Village at El Monotia.\n\nHer case is known in Egypt as one of the \"Ain Shams incidents\" among the Post-coup unrest in Egypt (2013–2014) because Ains Shams is the district around the Ain Shams University with a demographic of Morsy supporters, and is a site where there were multiple protests.\n\nMayada Ashraf, 22 or 23 years of age at the time of death, was born in Egypt. Ashraf was the daughter of Azza Ashraf, mother, and Ashraf A. Ashraf. father. She graduated with a degree in Mass Communications at Cairo University one year before her death. Her funeral was held on March 29, 2014 in Estanhaa village at El Monofia, Monufia Governorate.\n\nMayada Ashraf was a field reporter for the \"Al-Dustour\" newspaper, as well as a free-lance journalist for the \"Masr Alarabia\" news website.

Ashraf covered protests previously for \"Al-Dostour\".\n\nMonths before her death, she wrote, \"Morsi is not worth dying for, but el-Sisi is also not worth renouncing our humanity for.\"\n\nMayada Ashraf was killed on Friday March 28, 2014, while covering the clashes between the Muslim Brotherhood and the Egyptian Military coup in one of the many anti-el-Sisi protests in the Ain Shams district of Egypt. This district is near Ain Shams University. The clashes began after President Morsi was ousted by el-Sisi in a coup and Morsi supporters demanded the resignation of el-Sisi. The account from the Morsi supporters say Ashraf was fatally shot in the head in the midst of police fire while reporting on an anti-el-Sisi demonstration. In the official account and the one supported by \"Al-Dostour\", Ashraf's last report said that the shots were being fired by Morsi supporters into the crowd. Ashraf was proclaimed dead in the suburb area of Ain Shams in Cairo with a gunshot wound to the head. In the event of Mayada's death, \"Al-Dostour\" claimed to have made pleas publicly on the online news website for help to be sent to the location to take Ashraf's body out of Ain Shams. Due to the crowded streets filled with protesters the ambulance called was unable to reach Ashraf in time to save her, leading to her on site death in Ain Shams.\n\nAround 100 people were arrested at the protest. A judge ordered a trial for 48 of those involved in the protest, 13 of which were not in custody, who were suspected of being accountable for Mayada Ashraf's murder, as well as that of other casualties or for belonging to the Muslim Brotherhood and charged with terrorism. The prosecutor in the case said it had 25 confessions. The three killed in protest were Ashraf; Mary Sameh George, a female Coptic Christian; and Sherif Abdul Raouf, a male adolescent. Some reports said that a fourth person was also killed.\n\nAnti-el-Sisi demonstrations were fueled by the anger of supporters of President Mohammad Morsi after Morsi was overthrown in a coup led by Abdel Fattah el-Sisi. Clashes between Morsi supporters and the government erupted after el-Sisi took over and proclaimed the Muslim Brotherhood a terrorist organization and Morsi an accomplice. The Muslim Brotherhood, which has been condemned by many nations as a terrorist group, had a part in the protests against el-Sisi.\n\nMayada Ashraf was the fifth journalist out of 10 to be killed while reporting on clashes in Cairo, Egypt since June 30. She was one of 66 journalists killed worldwide in the year 2016. The death of Mayada Ashraf has led to the continued fight for the safety of journalists in Egypt with a push for more protective equipment and bullet-proof vests. She recommended as a Martyr of the Revolution to Prime Minister Ibrahim Mahlab.\n\nIrina Bokova, director-general of UNESCO, said, \"I deplore the murder of Mayada Ashraf, killed while carrying out her professional duty to inform the public \" the Director-General said. \"I count on the government to do everything possible to shed light on this crime and bring the authors to justice. Journalists must be able to do their job without fearing for their lives. This is key for upholding the right to freedom of expression, one of the pillars of democratic society.\"\n\nReporters Without Borders released a statement, \"We offer our heartfelt condolences to Ashraf's family and colleagues and we urge the competent authorities to carry out an independent and impartial investigation to ensure that this crime does not go unpunished.\"\n\nJim Boumelha, president of International Federation of Journalists, said, \"This is not about the political blame game or settling political scores, it is about ensuring that press freedom is upheld and making sure that the perpetrators of this brutal murder face the full weight of justice for their crime.\"\n\nNada Rashwan, an Egyptian journalist, said, \"It's frightening on more than one level, the indiscriminate force used in quelling protests, the manipulation of the truth by the shamelessly biased media, and how people have been desensitized by the repetition of violent scenes. The brutal murder of a young woman in broad daylight does not seem to shock anyone.\"\n\n"}

{"id": "4464817", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4464817", "title": "Neurodegeneration", "text": "Neurodegeneration\n\nNeurodegeneration is the progressive loss of structure or function of neurons, including death of neurons. Many neurodegenerative diseases – including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and Huntington's disease – occur as a result of neurodegenerative processes. Such diseases are incurable, resulting in progressive degeneration and/or death of neuron cells. As research progresses, many similarities appear that relate these diseases to one another on a sub-cellular level. Discovering these similarities offers hope for therapeutic advances that could ameliorate many diseases simultaneously. There are many parallels between different neurodegenerative disorders including atypical protein assemblies as well as induced cell death. Neurodegeneration can be found in many different levels of neuronal circuitry ranging from molecular to systemic.\n\nThe greatest risk factor for neurodegenerative diseases is aging. Mitochondrial DNA mutations as well as oxidative stress both contribute to aging. Many of these diseases are late-onset, meaning there is some factor that changes as a person ages for each disease. One constant factor is that in each disease, neurons gradually lose function as the disease progresses with age. It has been proposed that DNA damage accumulation provides the underlying causative link between aging and neurodegenerative disease.\n\nMany neurodegenerative diseases are caused by genetic mutations, most of which are located in completely unrelated genes. In many of the different diseases, the mutated gene has a common feature: a repeat of the CAG nucleotide triplet. CAG encodes for the amino acid glutamine. A repeat of CAG results in a polyglutamine (polyQ) tract. Diseases showing this are known as polyglutamine diseases.\n\n\nSeveral neurodegenerative diseases are classified as proteopathies as they are associated with the aggregation of misfolded proteins.\n\nParkinson's disease and Huntington's disease are both late-onset and associated with the accumulation of intracellular toxic proteins. Diseases caused by the aggregation of proteins are known as proteinopathies, and they are primarily caused by aggregates in the following structures:\n\n\nThere are two main avenues eukaryotic cells use to remove troublesome proteins or organelles:\n\n\nDamage to the membranes of organelles by monomeric or oligomeric proteins could also contribute to these diseases. Alpha-synuclein can damage membranes by inducing membrane curvature, and cause extensive tubulation and vesiculation when incubated with artificial phospholipid vesicles.\nThe tubes formed from these lipid vesicles consist of both micellar as well as bilayer tubes. Extensive induction of membrane curvature is deleterious to the cell and would eventually lead to cell death.Apart from tubular structures, alpha-synuclein can also form lipoprotein nanoparticles similar to apolipoproteins.\n\nThe most common form of cell death in neurodegeneration is through the intrinsic mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. This pathway controls the activation of caspase-9 by regulating the release of cytochrome c from the mitochondrial intermembrane space (IMS). Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are normal byproducts of mitochondrial respiratory chain activity. ROS concentration is mediated by mitochondrial antioxidants such as manganese superoxide dismutase (SOD2) and glutathione peroxidase. Over production of ROS (oxidative stress) is a central feature of all neurodegenerative disorders. In addition to the generation of ROS, mitochondria are also involved with life-sustaining functions including calcium homeostasis, PCD, mitochondrial fission and fusion, lipid concentration of the mitochondrial membranes, and the mitochondrial permeability transition. Mitochondrial disease leading to neurodegeneration is likely, at least on some level, to involve all of these functions.\n\nThere is strong evidence that mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress play a causal role in neurodegenerative disease pathogenesis, including in four of the more well known diseases Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, Huntington's, and Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.\n\nNeurons are particularly vulnerable to oxidative damage due to their strong metabolic activity associated with high transcription levels, high oxygen consumption, and weak antioxidant defense.\n\nThe brain metabolizes as much as a fifth of consumed oxygen, and reactive oxygen species produced by oxidative metabolism are a major source of DNA damage in the brain. Damage to a cell’s DNA is particularly harmful because DNA is the blueprint for protein production and unlike other molecules it cannot simply be replaced by re-synthesis. The vulnerability of post-mitotic neurons to DNA damage (such as oxidative lesions or certain types of DNA strand breaks), coupled with a gradual decline in the activities of repair mechanisms, could lead to accumulation of DNA damage with age and contribute to brain aging and neurodegeneration. DNA single-strand breaks are common and are associated with the neurodegenerative disease ataxia-oculomotor apraxia. Increased oxidative DNA damage in the brain is associated with Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson’s disease. Defective DNA repair has been linked to neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, ataxia telangiectasia, Cockayne syndrome, Parkinson’s disease and xeroderma pigmentosum.\n\nAxonal swelling and spheroids have been observed in many different neurodegenerative diseases. This suggests that defective axons are not only present in diseased neurons, but also that they may cause certain pathological insult due to accumulation of organelles. Axonal transport can be disrupted by a variety of mechanisms including damage to: kinesin and cytoplasmic dynein, microtubules, cargoes, and mitochondria. When axonal transport is severely disrupted a degenerative pathway known as Wallerian-like degeneration is often triggered.\n\nProgrammed cell death (PCD) is death of a cell in any form, mediated by an intracellular program. This process can be activated in neurodegenerative diseases including Parkinson's disease, amytrophic lateral sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease and Huntington's disease. There are, however, situations in which these mediated pathways are artificially stimulated due to injury or disease.\n\nApoptosis is a form of programmed cell death in multicellular organisms. It is one of the main types of programmed cell death (PCD) and involves a series of biochemical events leading to a characteristic cell morphology and death.\n\n\nCaspases (cysteine-aspartic acid proteases) cleave at very specific amino acid residues. There are two types of caspases: initiators and effectors. Initiator caspases cleave inactive forms of effector caspases. This activates the effectors that in turn cleave other proteins resulting in apoptotic initiation.\n\nAutophagy is essentially a form of intracellular phagocytosis in which a cell actively consumes damaged organelles or misfolded proteins by encapsulating them into an autophagosome, which fuses with a lysosome to destroy the contents of the autophagosome. Many neurodegenerative diseases show unusual protein aggregates. This could potentially be a result of underlying autophagic defect common to multiple neurodegenerative diseases. It is important to note that this is a hypothesis, and more research must be done.\n\nThe final and least understood PCD mechanism is through non-apoptotic processes. These fall under Type III, or cytoplasmic cell death. Many other forms of PCD are observed but not fully understood or accepted by the scientific community. For example, PCD might be caused by trophotoxicity, or hyperactivation of trophic factor receptors. In addition to this, other cytotoxins that induce PCD at low concentrations act to cause necrosis, or aponecrosis – the combination of apoptosis and necrosis, when in higher concentrations. It is still unclear exactly what combination of apoptosis, non-apoptosis, and necrosis causes different kinds of aponecrosis.\n\nIn the above-mentioned neurodegenerative diseases, PCD may be pathogenic. In order to identify the potential of neuroprotective targets in PCD machinery, there were experimental models conducted on these neurodegenerative diseases. These studies showed that the expression of certain components have been altered by genetic and pharmacological means. Expression of PCD molecular components are said to be controlled by gene and antisense therapy, but this needs further research. Pharmacological approaches involve inhibitors of caspase activity, and caspase inhibition might delay cell death in the different experimental models.\n\nTransglutaminases are human enzymes ubiquitously present in the human body and in the brain in particular.\n\nThe main function of transglutaminases is bind proteins and peptides intra- and intermolecularly, by a type of covalent bonds termed isopeptide bonds, in a reaction termed transamidation or crosslinking.\n\nTransglutaminase binding of these proteins and peptides make them clump together. The resulting structures are turned extremely resistant to chemical and mechanical disruption.\n\nMost relevant human neurodegenerative diseases share the property of having abnormal structures made up of proteins and peptides.\n\nEach of these neurodegenerative disesases have one (or several) specific main protein or peptide. In Alzheimer's disease, these are amyloid-beta and tau. In Parkinson’s disease, it is alpha-synuclein. In Huntington’s disease, it is huntingtin.\n\nTransglutaminase substrates:\nAmyloid-beta, tau, alpha-synuclein and huntingtin have been proved to be substrates of transglutaminases in vitro or in vivo, that is, they can be bonded by trasglutaminases by covalent bonds to each other and potentially to any other transglutaminase substrate in the brain.\n\nTransglutaminase augmented expression:\nIt has been proved that in these neurodegenerative diseases (Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, and Huntington’s disease) the expression of the transglutaminase enzyme is increased.\n\nPresence of isopeptide bonds in these structures:\nThe presence of isopeptide bonds (the result of the transglutaminase reaction) have been detected in the abnormal structures that are characteristic of these neurodegenerative diseases.\n\nCo-localization:\nCo-localization of transglutaminase mediated isopeptide bonds with these abnormal structures has been detected in the autopsy of brains of patients with these diseases.\n\nAlzheimer's disease is characterised by loss of neurons and synapses in the cerebral cortex and certain subcortical regions. This loss results in gross atrophy of the affected regions, including degeneration in the temporal lobe and parietal lobe, and parts of the frontal cortex and cingulate gyrus.\n\nAlzheimer's disease has been \"hypothesized\" to be a protein misfolding disease (proteopathy), caused by accumulation of abnormally folded A-beta and tau proteins in the brain. Plaques are made up of small peptides, 39–43 amino acids in length, called beta-amyloid (also written as A-beta or Aβ). Beta-amyloid is a fragment from a larger protein called amyloid precursor protein (APP), a transmembrane protein that penetrates through the neuron's membrane. APP is critical to neuron growth, survival and post-injury repair. In Alzheimer's disease, an unknown process causes APP to be divided into smaller fragments by enzymes through proteolysis. One of these fragments gives rise to fibrils of beta-amyloid, which form clumps that deposit outside neurons in dense formations known as senile plaques.\n\nParkinson's disease is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder and manifests as bradykinesia, rigidity, resting tremor and posture instability. The crude prevalence rate of PD has been reported to range from 15 per 100,000 to 12,500 per 100,000, and the incidence of PD from 15 per 100,000 to 328 per 100,000, with the disease being less common in Asian countries. Parkinson's disease is a degenerative disorder of the central nervous system. It results from the death of dopamine-generating cells in the substantia nigra, a region of the midbrain; the cause of cell-death is unknown. The following paragraph is an excerpt from the Pathophysiology section of the article Parkinson's disease.\n\nThe mechanism by which the brain cells in Parkinson's are lost \"may\" consist of an abnormal accumulation of the protein alpha-synuclein bound to ubiquitin in the damaged cells. The alpha-synuclein-ubiquitin complex cannot be directed to the proteasome. This protein accumulation forms proteinaceous cytoplasmic inclusions called Lewy bodies. The latest research on pathogenesis of disease has shown that the death of dopaminergic neurons by alpha-synuclein is due to a defect in the machinery that transports proteins between two major cellular organelles – the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the Golgi apparatus. Certain proteins like Rab1 may reverse this defect caused by alpha-synuclein in animal models.\n\nRecent research suggests that impaired axonal transport of alpha-synuclein leads to its accumulation in the Lewy bodies. Experiments have revealed reduced transport rates of both wild-type and two familial Parkinson's disease-associated mutant alpha-synucleins through axons of cultured neurons. Membrane damage by alpha-synuclein could be another Parkinson's disease mechanism.\n\nThe main known risk factor is age. Susceptibility genes including α-synuclein, leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK-2), and glucocerebrosidase (GBA) have shown that genetic predisposition is another important causal factor.\n\nThe following paragraph is an excerpt from the Mechanism section of the article Huntington's disease.\n\nHD causes astrogliosis and loss of medium spiny neurons. Areas of the brain are affected according to their structure and the types of neurons they contain, reducing in size as they cumulatively lose cells. The areas affected are mainly in the striatum, but also the frontal and temporal cortices. The striatum's subthalamic nuclei send control signals to the globus pallidus, which initiates and modulates motion. The weaker signals from subthalamic nuclei thus cause reduced initiation and modulation of movement, resulting in the characteristic movements of the disorder, notably chorea.\n\nMutant Huntingtin is an aggregate-prone protein. During the cells' natural clearance process, these proteins are retrogradely transported to the cell body for destruction by lysosomes. It is a possibility that these mutant protein aggregates damage the retrograde transport of important cargoes such as BDNF by damaging molecular motors as well as microtubules.\n\nAmyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS or Lou Gehrig's disease) is a disease in which motor neurons are selectively targeted for degeneration. In 1993, missense mutations in the gene encoding the antioxidant enzyme Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) were discovered in subsets of patients with familial ALS. This discovery led researchers to focus on unlocking the mechanisms for SOD1-mediated diseases. However, the pathogenic mechanism underlying SOD1 mutant toxicity has yet to be resolved. More recently, TDP-43 and FUS protein aggregates have been implicated in some cases of the disease, and a mutation in chromosome 9 (C9orf72) is thought to be the most common known cause of sporadic ALS.\n\nRecent independent research by Nagai et al. and Di Giorgio et al. provide \"in vitro\" evidence that the primary cellular sites where SOD1 mutations act are located on astrocytes. Astrocytes then cause the toxic effects on the motor neurons. The specific mechanism of toxicity still needs to be investigated, but the findings are significant because they implicate cells other than neuron cells in neurodegeneration.\n\nBatten disease is a rare and fatal recessive neurodegenerative disorder that begins at birth.\n\nThe process of neurodegeneration is not well understood, so the diseases that stem from it have, as yet, no cures. In the search for effective treatments (as opposed to palliative care), investigators employ animal models of disease to test potential therapeutic agents. Model organisms provide an inexpensive and relatively quick means to perform two main functions: target identification and target validation. Together, these help show the value of any specific therapeutic strategies and drugs when attempting to ameliorate disease severity. An example is the drug Dimebon (Medivation). This drug is in phase III clinical trials for use in Alzheimer's disease, and also recently finished phase II clinical trials for use in Huntington's disease. In March 2010, the results of a clinical trial phase III were released; the investigational Alzheimer's disease drug Dimebon failed in the pivotal CONNECTION trial of patients with mild-to-moderate disease. With CONCERT, the remaining Pfizer and Medivation Phase III trial for Dimebon (latrepirdine) in Alzheimer's disease failed in 2012, effectively ending the development in this indication.\n\nIn another experiment using a rat model of Alzheimer's disease, it was demonstrated that systemic administration of hypothalamic proline-rich peptide (PRP)-1 offers neuroprotective effects and can prevent neurodegeneration in hippocampus amyloid-beta 25–35. This suggests that there could be therapeutic value to PRP-1.\n\nProtein degradation offers therapeutic options both in preventing the synthesis and degradation of irregular proteins. There is also interest in upregulating autophagy to help clear protein aggregates implicated in neurodegeneration. Both of these options involve very complex pathways that we are only beginning to understand.\n\nThe goal of immunotherapy is to enhance aspects of the immune system. Both active and passive vaccinations have been proposed for Alzheimer's disease and other conditions, however more research must be done to prove safety and efficacy in humans.\n\n"}

When evident clinically, the condition is usually massive. The onset of pulmonary hemorrhage is characterized by cough productive of blood (hemoptysis) and worsening of oxygenation leading to cyanosis. Treatment should be immediate and should include tracheal suction, oxygen, positive pressure ventilation, and correction of underlying abnormalities (e.g. disorders of coagulation). A blood transfusion may be necessary.\n\nThe outcome of treatment is dependent on causality. Pulmonary Hemorrhage is present in 7 to 10% of neonatal autopsies, but up to 80% of autopsies of very preterm infants. The incidence is 1 in 1,000 live births. Pulmonary hemorrhage has a high mortality rate of 30% to 40%.\n\nInfant prematurity is the factor most commonly associated with pulmonary hemorrhage. Other associated factors are those that predispose to perinatal asphyxia or bleeding disorders, including toxemia of pregnancy, maternal cocaine use, erythroblastosis fetalis, breech delivery, hypothermia, infection, Infant respiratory distress syndrome (IRDS), administration of exogenous surfactants (in some studies) and Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO).\n\nAlthough the pathogenesis is uncertain, it is probable that the symptoms are a consequence of hemorrhagic pulmonary edema, as the hematocrit is lower than normal blood (usually 15-20% less) and the concentration of small proteins is higher than in plasma. It is postulated that the infant suffers from asphyxia with resultant heart attack; this increases pulmonary microvascular pressure, resulting in pulmonary edema. Contributing factors include factors that favor increased filtration of fluid from pulmonary capillaries (e.g., low concentration of plasma proteins, high alveolar surface tension, lung damage, hypervolemia).\n\nDiffuse alveolar hemorrhage is bleeding from many alveoli throughout the lungs. Common causes include autoimmune diseases and connective tissue diseases.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "648450", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=648450", "title": "Rachel's Tomb", "text": "Rachel's Tomb\n\nRachel's Tomb ( translit. \"Qever Raḥel\", \"Qabr Rāḥīl\") is the site revered as the burial place of the matriarch Rachel. The tomb has been considered holy to Jews, Christians and Muslims for 2000 years. Since the mid-1990s, Palestinians have referred to the site as the Bilal bin Rabah mosque ()\n\nThe tomb, located at the northern entrance of Bethlehem, is built in the style of a traditional maqam. The burial place of the matriarch Rachel as mentioned in Jewish Tanakh, Christian Old Testament and in Muslim literature is contested between this site and several others to the north. Although this site is considered unlikely to be the actual site of the grave, it is by far the most recognized candidate.\n\nThe earliest extra-biblical records describing this tomb as Rachel's burial place date to the first decades of the 4th century CE. The structure in its current form dates from the Ottoman period, and is situated in a Christian and Muslim cemetery dating from at least the Mamluk period. When Sir Moses Montefiore renovated the site in 1841 and obtained the keys for the Jewish community, he also added an antechamber, including a \"mihrab\" for Muslim prayer, to ease Muslim fears. According to the 1947 United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine, the tomb was to be part of the internationally administered zone of Jerusalem, but the area was occupied by The Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, which prohibited Jews from entering the area. Following the Israeli occupation of the West Bank in 1967, though not initially falling within Area C, the site has come under the control of the Israeli Ministry of Religious Affairs.\n\nRachel's tomb is the third holiest site in Judaism and has become one of the cornerstones of Jewish-Israeli identity. According to , a mazzebah was erected at the site of Rachel's grave in ancient Israel, leading scholars to consider the site to have been a place of worship in ancient Israel. According to Martin Gilbert, Jews have made pilgrimage to the tomb since ancient times. The first historically recorded pilgrimages to the site were by early Christians, and Christian witnesses wrote of the devotion shown to the shrine by local Muslims and then later also by Jews. Throughout history, the site was rarely considered a shrine exclusive to one religion and is described as being \"held in esteem equally by Jews, Muslims, and Christians\".\n\nFollowing a 1929 British memorandum, in 1949 the UN ruled that the \"Status Quo\", an arrangement approved by the 1878 Treaty of Berlin concerning rights, privileges and practices in certain Holy Places, applies to the site. In 2005, following Israeli approval on 11 September 2002, the Israeli West Bank barrier was built around the tomb, effectively annexing it to Jerusalem. A 2005 report from OHCHR Special Rapporteur John Dugard noted that: \"Although Rachel’s Tomb is a site holy to Jews, Muslims and Christians, it has effectively been closed to Muslims and Christians.\" On October 21, 2015, UNESCO adopted a controversial resolution reaffirming a 2010 statement that Rachel's Tomb was: \"an integral part of Palestine.\" On 22 October 2015, the tomb was separated from Bethlehem with a series of concrete barriers.\n\nBiblical scholarship identifies two different traditions in the Hebrew Bible concerning the site of Rachel's burial, respectively a northern version, locating it north of Jerusalem near Ramah, modern Al-Ram, and a southern narrative locating it close to Bethlehem. In rabbinical tradition the duality is resolved by using two different terms in Hebrew to designate these different localities. In the Hebrew version given in Genesis, Rachel and Jacob journey from Shechem to Hebron, a short distance from Ephrath, which is glossed as Bethlehem (35:16-21, 48:7). She dies on the way giving birth to Benjamin:\n\"And Rachel died, and was buried on the way to Ephrath, which is Bethlehem. And Jacob set a pillar upon her grave: that is the pillar of Rachel's grave unto this day.\" — Genesis 35:19-20\nTom Selwyn notes that R. A. S. Macalister, the most authoritative voice on the topography of Rachel's tomb, advanced the view in 1912 that the identification with Bethlehem was based on a copyist's mistake.\nThe Judean scribal gloss \"(Ephrath, ) which is Bethlehem\" was added to distinguish it from a similar toponym Ephrathah in the Bethlehem region. Some consider as certain, however, that Rachel's tomb lay to the north, in Benjamite, not in Judean territory, and that the Bethlehem gloss represents a Judean appropriation of the grave, originally in the north, to enhance Judah's prestige. At 1 Samuel 10:2, Rachel's tomb is located in the 'territory of Benjamin at Zelzah.' In the period of the monarchy down to the exile, it would follow, Rachel's tomb was thought to lie in Ramah. The indications for this are based on 1 Sam 10:2 and Jer. 31:15, which give an alternative location north of Jerusalem, in the vicinity of ar-Ram, biblical Ramah, five miles south of Bethel. One conjecture is that before David's conquest of Jerusalem, the ridge road from Bethel might have been called \"the Ephrath road\" (\"derek ’eprātāh\". ; \"derek’eprāt,\" ), hence the passage in Genesis meant 'the road \"to\" Ephrath or Bethlehem,' on which Ramah, if that word refers to a toponym, lay. A possible location in Ramah could be the five stone monuments north of Hizma. Known as \"Qubur Bene Isra'in\", the largest so-called tomb of the group, the function of which is obscure, has the name \"Qabr Umm beni Isra'in\", that is, \"tomb of the mother of the descendants of Israel\".\n\nAs to the structure outside Bethlehem being placed exactly over an ancient tomb, it was revealed during excavations in around 1825 that it was not built over an underground cavity; however, a deep cavern was discovered a small distance from the site.\n\nTraditions regarding the tomb at this location date back to the beginning of the 4th century AD. Eusebius' \"Onomasticon\" (written before 324) and the Bordeaux Pilgrim (333-334) mention the tomb as being located 4 miles from Jerusalem.\n\nIn the late 7th century, the tomb was marked with a stone pyramid, devoid of any ornamentation. During the 10th century, Muqaddasi and other geographers fail to mention the tomb, which indicates that it may have lost importance until the Crusaders revived its veneration.\n\nMuhammad al-Idrisi (1154) writes, \"Half-way down the road [between Bethlehem and Jerusalem] is the tomb of Rachel (\"Rahil\"), the mother of Joseph and of Benjamin, the two sons of Jacob peace upon them all! The tomb is covered by twelve stones, and above it is a dome vaulted.\" \n\nBenjamin of Tudela (1169–71) was the first Jewish pilgrim to describe his visit to the tomb. He mentioned a pillar made of 11 stones and a cupola resting on four columns \"and all the Jews that pass by carve their names upon the stones of the pillar.\" Petachiah of Regensburg explains that the 11 stones represented the tribes of Israel, excluding Benjamin, since Rachel had died during his birth. All were marble, with that of Jacob on top.\"\n\nIn the 14th century, Antony of Cremona referred to the cenotaph as \"the most wonderful tomb that I shall ever see. I do not think that with 20 pairs of oxen it would be possible to extract or move one of its stones.\" It was described by Franciscan pilgrim Nicolas of Poggibonsi (1346–50) as being 7 feet high and enclosed by a rounded tomb with three gates.\n\nFrom around the 15th century onwards, if not earlier, the tomb was occupied and maintained by the Muslim rulers. The Russian deacon Zozimos describes it as being a mosque in 1421. A guide published in 1467 credits Shahin al-Dhahiri with the building of a cupola, cistern and drinking fountain at the site. The Muslim rebuilding of the \"dome on four columns\" was also mentioned by Francesco Suriano in 1485. Felix Fabri (1480–83) described it as being \"a lofty pyramid, built of square and polished white stone\"; He also noted a drinking water trough at its side and reported that \"this place is venerated alike by Muslims, Jews, and Christians\". Bernhard von Breidenbach of Mainz (1483) described women praying at the tomb and collecting stones to take home, believing that they would ease their labour. Pietro Casola (1494) described it as being \"beautiful and much honoured by the Moors.\" Mujir al-Din al-'Ulaymi (1495), the Jerusalemite \"qadi\" and Arab historian, writes under the heading of \"Qoubbeh Râhîl\" (\"Dome of Rachel\") that Rachel's tomb lies under this dome on the road between Bethlehem and Bayt Jala and that the edifice is turned towards the \"Sakhrah\" (the rock inside the Dome of the Rock) and widely visited by pilgrims.\n\nIn 1615 Muhammad Pasha of Jerusalem repaired the structure and transferred exclusive ownership of the site to the Jews. In 1626, Franciscus Quaresmius visited the site and found that the tomb had been rebuilt by the locals several times. He also found near it a cistern and many Muslim graves.\n\nGeorge Sandys wrote in 1632 that “The sepulchre of Rachel... is mounted on a square... within which another sepulchre is used for a place of prayer by the Mohometans\".\n\nRabbi Moses Surait of Prague (1650) described a high dome on the top of the tomb, an opening on one side, and a big courtyard surrounded by bricks. He also described a local Jewish cult associated with the site. A 1659 Venetian publication of Uri ben Simeon's \"Yichus ha-Abot\" included a small and apparently inaccurate illustration.\n\nIn March 1756, the Istanbul Jewish Committee for the Jews of Palestine instructed that 500 \"kurus\" used by the Jews of Jerusalem to fix a wall at the tomb were to be repaid and used instead for more deserving causes. In 1788, walls were built to enclose the arches. According to Richard Pococke, this was done to \"hinder the Jews from going into it\". Pococke also reports that the site was highly regarded by Turks as a place of burial.\n\nIn 1806 François-René Chateaubriand described it as \"a square edifice, surmounted with a small dome: it enjoys the privileges of a mosque, for the Turks as well as the Arabs, honour the families of the patriarchs. [..] it is evidently a Turkish edifice, erected in memory of a santon.\n\nAn 1824 report described \"a stone building, evidently of Turkish construction, which terminates at the top in a dome. Within this edifice is the tomb. It is a pile of stones covered with white plaster, about 10 feet long and nearly as high. The inner wall of the building and the sides of the tomb are covered with Hebrew names, inscribed by Jews.\"\n\nWhen the structure was undergoing repairs in around 1825, excavations at the foot of the monument revealed that it was not built directly over an underground cavity. However, a small distance from the site, an unusually deep cavern was discovered.\n\nIn 1830, the Ottomans legally recognized the tomb as a Jewish holy site. Proto-Zionist banker Sir Moses Montefiore visited Rachel's Tomb together with his wife on their first visit to the Holy Land in 1828. The couple were childless, and Lady Montefiore was deeply moved by the tomb, which was in good condition at that time. Before the couple's next visit, in 1839, the Galilee earthquake of 1837 had heavily damaged the tomb. In 1838 the tomb was described as \"merely an ordinary Muslim Wely, or tomb of a holy person; a small square building of stone with a dome, and within it a tomb in the ordinary Muhammedan form; the whole plastered over with mortar. It is neglected and falling to decay; though pilgrimages are still made to it by the Jews. The naked walls are covered with names in several languages; many of them Hebrew.\"\nIn 1841, Montefiore renovated the site and obtained for the Jews the key of the tomb. He renovated the entire structure, reconstructing and re-plastering its white dome, and added an antechamber, including a mihrab for Muslim prayer, to ease Muslim fears. Professor Glenn Bowman notes that some writers have described this as a “purchase” of the tomb by Montefiore, asserting that this was not the case.\n\nIn 1843, Ridley Haim Herschell described the building as an ordinary Muslim tomb. He reported that Jews, including Montefiore, were obliged to remain outside the tomb, and prayed at a hole in the wall, so that their voices enter into the tomb. In 1844, William Henry Bartlett referred to the tomb as a \"Turkish Mosque\", following a visit to the area in 1842.\n\nIn 1845, Montefiore made further architectural improvements at the tomb. He extended the building by constructing an adjacent vaulted ante-chamber on the east for Muslim prayer use and burial preparation, possibly as an act of conciliation. The room included a \"mihrab\" facing Mecca.\n\nIn the mid-1850s, the marauding Arab e-Ta'amreh tribe forced the Jews to furnish them with an annual £30 payment to prevent them from damaging the tomb.\n\nAccording to Elizabeth Anne Finn, wife of the British consul, James Finn, the only time the Sephardic Jewish community left the Old City of Jerusalem was for monthly prayers at \"Rachel's Sepulchre\" or Hebron.\n\nIn 1864, the Jews of Bombay donated money to dig a well. Although Rachel's Tomb was only an hour and a half walk from the Old City of Jerusalem, many pilgrims found themselves very thirsty and unable to obtain fresh water. Every \"Rosh Chodesh\" (beginning of the Jewish month), the Maiden of Ludmir would lead her followers to Rachel’s tomb and lead a prayer service with various rituals, which included spreading out requests of the past four weeks over the tomb. On the traditional anniversary of Rachel's death, she would lead a solemn procession to the tomb where she chanted psalms in a night-long vigil.\n\nIn 1868 a publication by the Catholic missionary society the Paulist Fathers noted that \"[Rachel's] memory has always been held in respect by the Jews and Christians, and even now the former go there every Thursday, to pray and read the old, old history of this mother of their race. When leaving Bethlehem for the fourth and last time, after we had passed the tomb of Rachel, on our way to Jerusalem, Father Luigi and I met a hundred or more Jews on their weekly visit to the venerated spot.\"\n\nThe Hebrew monthly \"ha-Levanon\" of August 19, 1869, rumored that a group of Christians had purchased land around the tomb and were in the process of demolishing Montefiore's vestibule in order to erect a church there. During the following years, land in the vicinity of the tomb was acquired by Nathan Straus. In October 1875, Rabbi Zvi Hirsch Kalischer purchased three dunams of land near the tomb intending to establish a Jewish farming colony there. Custody of the land was transferred to the Perushim community in Jerusalem. In the 1880s, Conder and Kitchener noted: \"A modern Moslem building stands over the site, and there are Jewish graves near it.\"\n\nIn 1912 the Ottoman Government permitted the Jews to repair the shrine itself, but not the antechamber. In 1915 the structure had four walls, each about 7 m (23 ft.) long and 6 m (20 ft.) high. The dome, rising about 3 m (10 ft.), \"is used by the Moslems for prayer; its holy character has hindered them from removing the Hebrew letters from its walls.\"\n\nThree months after the British occupation of Palestine the whole place was cleaned and whitewashed by the Jews without protest from the Muslims. However, in 1921 when the Chief Rabbinate applied to the Municipality of Bethlehem for permission to perform repairs at the site, local Muslims objected. In view of this, the High Commissioner ruled that, pending appointment of the Holy Places Commission provided for under the Mandate, all repairs should be undertaken by the Government. However, so much indignation was caused in Jewish circles by this decision that the matter was dropped, the repairs not being considered urgent. In 1925 the Sephardic Jewish community requested permission to repair the tomb. The building was then made structurally sound and exterior repairs were effected by the Government, but permission was refused by the Jews (who had the keys) for the Government to repair the interior of the shrine. As the interior repairs were unimportant, the Government dropped the matter, in order to avoid controversy. In 1926 Max Bodenheimer blamed the Jews for letting one of their holy sites appear so neglected and uncared for.\n\nDuring this period, both Jews and Muslims visited the site. From the 1940s, it came to be viewed as a symbol of the Jewish people's return to Zion, to its ancient homeland, For Jewish women, the tomb was associated with fertility and became a place of pilgrimage to pray for successful childbirth. Depictions of the Tomb of Rachel have appeared in Jewish religious books and works of art. Muslims prayed inside the mosque there and the cemetery at the tomb was the main Muslim cemetery in the Bethlehem area. The building was also used for Islamic funeral rituals. It is reported that Jews and Muslims respected each other and accommodated each other's rituals.\nDuring the riots of 1929, violence hampered regular visits by Jews to the tomb. Both Jews and Muslims demanded control of the site, with the Muslims claiming it was an integral part of the Muslim cemetery within which it is situated. It also demanded a renewal of the old Muslim custom of purifying corpses in the tomb's antechamber.\n\nFollowing the 1948 Arab–Israeli War till 1967, the site was ruled by Jordan and occupied by the Islamic waqf. On December 11, 1948, the UN General Assembly passed Resolution 194 which called for free access to all the holy places in Israel and the remainder of the territory of the former Palestine Mandate of Great Britain. In April 1949, the Jerusalem Committee prepared a document for the UN Secretariat in order to establish the status of the different holy places in the area of the former British Mandate for Palestine. It noted that ownership of Rachel's Tomb was claimed by both Jews and Muslims. The Jews claimed possession by virtue of a 1615 firman granted by the Pasha of Jerusalem which gave them exclusive use of the site and that the building, which had fallen into decay, was entirely restored by Moses Montefiore in 1845; the keys were obtained by the Jews from the last Muslim guardian at this time. The Muslims claimed the site was a place of Muslim prayer and an integral part of the Muslim cemetery within which it was situated. They stated that the Ottoman Government had recognised it as such and that it is included among the Tombs of the Prophets for which identity signboards were issued by the Ministry of Waqfs in 1898. They also asserted that the antechamber built by Montefiore was specially built as a place of prayer for Muslims. The UN ruled that the \"status quo\", an arrangement approved by the Ottoman Decree of 1757 concerning rights, privileges and practices in certain Holy Places, apply to the site.\n\nIn theory, free access was to be granted as stipulated in the 1949 Armistice Agreements, though Israelis, unable to enter Jordan, were prevented from visiting. Non-Israeli Jews, however, continued to visit the site. During this period the Muslim cemetery was expanded.\n\nFollowing the Six-Day War in 1967, Israel occupied of the West Bank, which included the tomb. The tomb was placed under Israeli military administration. Some time after the occupation, Islamic crescents, inscribed into the rooms of the structure, were erased. Muslims claim that they were prevented from using the mosque, although they were allowed to use the cemetery for a while.\n\nPrime minister Levi Eshkol instructed that the tomb be included within the new expanded municipal borders of Jerusalem, but citing security concerns, Moshe Dayan decided not to include it within the territory that was annexed to Jerusalem. Starting in 1993, Muslims were barred from using the cemetery. According to Bethlehem University, \"[a]ccess to Rachel's Tomb is now restricted to tourists entering from Israel.\"\n\nFollowing the Oslo accords, the Israeli–Palestinian Interim Agreement was signed on September 28, 1995, placing Rachel's Tomb in Area C under Israeli jurisdiction. Originally, Yitzhak Rabin had decided to cede Rachel's Tomb, along with Bethlehem. Israel's first draft had placed Rachel's Tomb, which is situated 460 metres from the municipal border of Jerusalem, in Area A under PA jurisdiction. Popular pressure exerted by religious parties in Israel to keep the religious site under Israeli control threatened the agreement, and Yassir Arafat agreed to forego the request.\n\nOn December 1, 1995, Bethlehem, with the exception of the tomb enclave, passed under the full control of the Palestinian Authority. Jews could reach it in bulletproof vehicles under military supervision. In 1996 Israel began an 18-month fortification of the site at a cost of $2m. It included a 13 foot high wall and adjacent military post. In response, Palestinians said that \"the Tomb of Rachel was on Islamic land\" and that the structure was in fact a mosque built at the time of the Arab conquest in honour of Bilal ibn Rabah, an Ethiopian known in Islamic history as the first muezzin.\n\nAfter an attack on Joseph's Tomb and its subsequent takeover by Arabs, hundreds of residents of Bethlehem and the Aida refugee camp, led by the Palestinian Authority-appointed governor of Bethlehem, Muhammad Rashad al-Jabari, attacked Rachel's Tomb. They set the scaffolding that had been erected around it on fire and tried to break in. The IDF dispersed the mob with gunfire and stun grenades, and dozens were wounded. In the following years, the Israeli-controlled site became a flashpoint between young Palestinians who hurled stones, bottles and firebombs and IDF troops, who responded with tear gas and rubber bullets.\nAt the end of 2000, when the second intifada broke out, the tomb came under attack for 41 days. Fatah operatives and members of the Palestinian security services who were responsible for curbing militant activity against Israelis actively participated in it. In May 2001, fifty Jews found themselves trapped inside by a firefight between the IDF and Palestinian Authority gunmen. In March 2002 the IDF returned to Bethlehem as part of Operation Defensive Shield and remained there for an extended period of time. In September 2002, the tomb was incorporated on the Israeli side of the West Bank barrier and surrounded by a concrete wall and watchtowers.\n\nIn February 2005, the Israel Supreme Court rejected a Palestinian appeal to change the route of the security fence in the region of the tomb. Israeli construction destroyed the Palestinian neighbourhood of \"Qubbet Rahil\". Israel also declared the area to be a part of Jerusalem. From 2011, a \"Wall Museum\" was created by Palestinians on the North wall of the Israeli separation barrier surrounding Rachel’s tomb.\n\nIn February 2010, Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu announced that the tomb would become a part of the national Jewish heritage sites rehabilitation plan. The decision was opposed by the Palestinian Authority, who saw it as a political decision associated with Israel's settlement project. The UN's special coordinator for the Middle East, Robert Serry, issued a statement of concern over the move, saying that the site is in Palestinian territory and has significance in both Judaism and Islam. The Jordanian government said that the move would derail peace efforts in the Middle East and condemned \"unilateral Israeli measures which affect holy places and offend sentiments of Muslims throughout the world\". UNESCO urged Israel to remove the site from its heritage list, stating that it was \"an integral part of the occupied Palestinian territories\". A resolution was passed at UNESCO that acknowledged both the Jewish and Islamic significance of the site, describing the site as both Bilal ibn Rabah Mosque and as Rachel's Tomb. The resolution passed with 44 countries supporting it, twelve countries abstaining, and only the United States voting to oppose. An article written by Nadav Shargai of the Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs, published in the \"Jerusalem Post\" criticized UNESCO, arguing that the site was not a mosque and that the move was politically motivated to disenfranchise Israel and Jewish religious traditions. Also writing in the \"Jerusalem Post\", Larry Derfner, defended the UNESCO position. He pointed out that UNESCO had explicitly recognized the Jewish connection to the site, having only denounced Israeli claims of sovereignty, while also acknowledging the Islamic and Christian significance of the site. The Israeli Prime Minister's Office criticised the resolution, claiming that: \"the attempt to detach the Nation of Israel from its heritage is absurd. ... If the nearly 4,000-year-old burial sites of the Patriarchs and Matriarchs of the Jewish Nation – Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Sarah, Rebecca, Rachel and Leah – are not part of its culture and tradition, then what is a national cultural site?\"\n\nIn Jewish lore, Rachel was born on 11 Cheshvan 1553 BCE. \n\nEarly Jewish scholars noticed an apparent contradiction in the Bible with regards to the location of Rachel's grave. In Genesis, the Bible states that Rachel was buried \"on the way to Ephrath, which is Bethlehem.\" Yet a reference to her tomb in Samuel states: \"When you go from me today, you will find two men by Rachel's tomb, in the border of Benjamin, in Zelzah\" (1 Sam 10:2). Rashi asks: \"Now, isn't Rachel's tomb in the border of Judah, in Bethlehem?\" He explains that the verse rather means: \"Now they are by Rachel's tomb, and when you will meet them, you will find them in the border of Benjamin, in Zelzah.\" Similarly, Ramban assumes that the site shown today near Bethlehem reflects an authentic tradition. After he had arrived in Jerusalem and seen \"with his own eyes\" that Rachel's tomb was on the outskirts of Bethlehem, he retracted his original understanding of her tomb being located north of Jerusalem and concluded that the reference in Jeremiah (Jer 31:15) which seemed to place her burial place in Ramah, is to be understood allegorically. There remains however, a dispute as to whether her tomb near Bethlehem was in the tribal territory of Judah, or of her son Benjamin.\n\nA Jewish tradition teaches that Rachel weeps for her children and that when the Jews were taken into exile, she wept as they passed by her grave on the way to Babylonia. Jews have made pilgrimage to the tomb since ancient times.\n\nThere is a tradition regarding the key that unlocked the door to the tomb. The key was about long and made of brass. The beadle kept it with him at all times, and it was not uncommon that someone would knock at his door in the middle of the night requesting it to ease the labor pains of an expectant mother. The key was placed under her pillow and almost immediately, the pains would subside and the delivery would take place peacefully.\n\nTill this day there is an ancient tradition regarding a \"segulah\" or charm which is the most famous women's ritual at the tomb. A red string is tied around the tomb seven times then worn as a charm for fertility. This use of the string is comparatively recent, though there is a report of its use to ward off diseases in the 1880s.\n\nThe Torah Ark in Rachel's Tomb is covered with a curtain (Hebrew: \"parokhet\") made from the wedding gown of Nava Applebaum, a young Israeli woman who was killed by a Palestinian terrorist in a suicide bombing at Café Hillel in Jerusalem in 2003, on the eve of her wedding.\n\nThe tomb of Sir Moses Montefiore, adjacent to the Montefiore synagogue in Ramsgate, England, is a replica of Rachel's Tomb.\n\nIn 1934, the Michigan Memorial Park planned to reproduce the tomb. When built, it was used to house the sound system and pipe organ used during funerals, but it has since been demolished.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

He served in the First and Second World Wars, and was killed in the sinking of by the German battleship \"Bismarck\" at the Battle of the Denmark Strait.\n\nKerr was born on 16 August 1891, the only son of Lieutenant-Colonel Sir Russell Kerr, and his wife Lady Kerr, of Newnham on Severn, Gloucestershire. He joined the Royal Navy on 15 May 1904, and after service as a cadet he rose through the ranks, being promoted to Lieutenant on 28 February 1914. He served in the First World War, spending most of the period aboard the battleship HMS \"Benbow\", the flagship of Admiral Sir Doveton Sturdee. He was present at the Battle of Jutland in May 1916, and by 1918 he had been given his own command, that of the destroyer HMS \"Cossack\".\n\nKerr was promoted to commander on 30 June 1927, and in December 1928 he was given command of the destroyer HMS \"Windsor\", followed by HMS \"Thruster\" in August 1929. He commanded \"Thruster\" until February 1931, and after a year on land, returned to sea in February 1932 in command of HMS \"Decoy\". Promotion to captain followed on 30 June 1935, and on 6 September 1935 he became commander of the Flotilla leader and captain (D) of the 21st Destroyer Flotilla. He stepped down from the position on 22 May 1936. His commander, Admiral Thomson, reported that he had found Kerr to be \"A very capable Captain (D) who has trained his Flotilla well. An officer probably much better suited to the practical side of naval life rather than to Staff duties. A strong personality with definite powers of command and a very good seaman. Most loyal and is very thorough in the carrying out of his duties. Social qualities good. Physically fit and has good powers of endurance.\"\n\nKerr became senior officer, Reserve Fleet aboard HMS \"Caledon\" in July 1936, transferring to HMS \"Colombo\" on 3 November 1936. As well as being the senior officer of the reserve fleet he then also became chief staff officer to the rear-admiral of the 10th Cruiser Squadron, where he remained for the next year, until July 1937. Vice-Admiral Sir Gerald Dickens also produced a highly favourable report, noting that Kerr was \"A very keen zealous officer who has done well as Senior Officer Reserve Fleet. Has plenty of character and drive and is mentally alert. A good seaman and a sound administrator. Very loyal, while ambitious to do well. Good social qualities. Keeps fit.\"\n\nKerr was to have then received an appointment to command the Flotilla leader HMS \"Duncan\", where he would be captain (D) of the 8th Destroyer Flotilla. The appointment was cancelled before he could take it up however. Instead, after a period of training, he became commander of HMS \"Hardy\" and captain (D) of the 2nd Destroyer Flotilla. During this period he served under Vice-Admiral John Tovey, and impressed both him, and the Commander-in-Chief Mediterranean Admiral Sir Dudley Pound. Kerr then took command of HMS \"Broke\" and the 15th Destroyer Flotilla, later transferring to the shore establishment HMS \"Cochrane\", at Rosyth on 30 August 1939. He remained at Rosyth with the Rosyth Destroyer Force until 24 January 1940, spending time on the staff of the commander-in-chief, Rosyth. He was awarded the CBE in 1940.\n\nKerr took command of the battlecruiser on 15 February 1941. Command of the Navy's largest capital ship was a major change, Kerr having only previously commanded destroyers. He took her to sea on the completion of her refit in mid March, and carried out gunnery exercises and patrols off Iceland. He was commander of \"Hood\" for just three months, when he was killed at the Battle of the Denmark Strait, along with most of his crew, when \"Hood\" was sunk by the German battleship \"Bismarck\". He was posthumously Mentioned in Despatches. Kerr is commemorated on Portsmouth Naval Memorial.\n\nHe had married Margaret Augusta Kerr on 14 February 1920, the marriage producing two children, Russell and Jane. They resided in St John's Wood, London. Russell Kerr, who had served as a captain in the Royal Artillery and as a tank commander, was killed while fighting in Burma in 1945.\n\n"}

{"id": "6117013", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6117013", "title": "Space food", "text": "Space food\n\nSpace food is a type of food product created and processed for consumption by astronauts in outer space. The food has specific requirements of providing balanced nutrition for individuals working in space, while being easy and safe to store, prepare and consume in the machinery-filled weightless environments of manned spacecraft. \n\nIn recent years, space food has been used by various nations engaging on space programs as a way to share and show off their cultural identity and facilitate intercultural communication. Although astronauts consume a wide variety of foods and beverages in space, the initial idea from The Man in Space Committee of the Space Science Board in 1963 was to supply astronauts with a formula diet that would supply all the needed vitamins and nutrients.\n\nFor lunch on Vostok I (1961) Yuri Gagarin ate from three 160 g toothpaste-type tubes, two of which contained servings of puréed meat and one which contained chocolate sauce.\n\nIn August 1961, Soviet Cosmonaut Gherman Titov became the first human to experience space sickness on Vostok II; he holds the record for being the first person to vomit in space. According to Lane and Feeback, this event \"heralded the need for space flight nutrition.\"\n\nOne of John Glenn's many tasks, as the first American to orbit Earth in 1962, was to experiment with eating in weightless conditions. Some experts had been concerned that weightlessness would impair swallowing. Glenn experienced no difficulties and it was determined that microgravity did not affect the natural swallowing process, which is enabled by the peristalsis of the esophagus.\n\nAstronauts in later Mercury missions (1959–1963) disliked the food that was provided. They ate bite-sized cubes, freeze-dried powders, and tubes of semiliquids. The astronauts found it unappetizing, experienced difficulties in rehydrating the freeze-dried foods, and did not like having to squeeze tubes or collect crumbs. Prior to the mission, the astronauts were also fed \"low residual\" launch-day breakfasts, to reduce the chances that they would defecate in flight.\n\nSeveral of the food issues from the Mercury missions were addressed for the later Gemini missions (1965–1966). Tubes (often heavier than the foods they contained) were abandoned. Gelatin coatings helped to prevent bite-sized cubes from crumbling. Simpler rehydration methods were developed. The menus also expanded to include items such as shrimp cocktail, chicken and vegetables, toast squares, butterscotch pudding, and apple juice.\n\nThe crew of Gemini III sneaked a corned beef sandwich on their spaceflight. Mission Commander Gus Grissom loved corned beef sandwiches, so Pilot John Young brought one along, having been encouraged by fellow astronaut Walter Schirra. However, Young was supposed to eat only approved food, and Grissom was not supposed to eat anything. Floating pieces of bread posed a potential problem, causing Grissom to put the sandwich away (although he did enjoy it) and the astronauts were mildly rebuked by NASA for the act. A congressional hearing was called, forcing the NASA deputy administrator George Mueller to promise no repeats. NASA took special care about what astronauts brought along on future missions.\n\nPrior to the Apollo program (1968–1975), early space food development was conducted at the US Air Force School of Aerospace Medicine and the Natick Army Labs. The variety of food options continued to expand for the Apollo missions. The new availability of hot water made rehydrating freeze-dried foods simpler, and produced a more appetizing result. The \"spoon-bowl\" allowed more normal eating practices. Food could be kept in special plastic zip-closure containers, and its moisture allowed it to stick to a spoon.\n\nOn Sunday, 20 July 1969, Buzz Aldrin, on the moon, partook of the Presbyterian Christian sacrament of Holy Communion, which had been consecrated by his pastor, the Rev. Dean Woodruff, two weeks prior to the space mission.\n\nAldrin received the Eucharist in the same hour that his local church did on that Sunday Sabbath and he later stated that \"I sensed especially strongly my unity with our church back home, and with the Church everywhere\".\n\nLarger living areas on the Skylab space station (1973–1974) allowed for an on-board refrigerator and freezer, which allowed perishable and frozen items to be stored and made microgravity the primary obstacle. When Skylab's solar panels were damaged during its launch and the station had to rely on minimal power from the Apollo Telescope Mount until Skylab 2 crewmembers performed repairs, the refrigerator and freezer were among the systems that Mission Control kept operational.\n\nMenus included 72 items; for the first time about 15% was frozen. Shrimp cocktail and butter cookies were consistent favorites; Lobster Newburg, fresh bread, processed meat products, and ice cream were among other choices. A dining room table and chairs, fastened to the floor and fitted with foot and thigh restraints, allowed for a more normal eating experience. The trays used could warm the food, and had magnets to hold eating utensils and scissors used for opening food containers. The food was similar to that used for Apollo, but canned for preservation; the crew found it to be better than that of Apollo but still unsatisfying, partially due to food tasting different in space than on Earth. The frozen foods were the most popular, and they enjoyed spicy foods due to head congestion from weightlessness dulling their senses of taste and smell. Weightlessness also complicated both eating and cleaning up; crews spent up to 90 minutes a day on housekeeping.\n\nAfter astronaut requests, NASA bought Paul Masson Rare Cream Sherry for one Skylab mission and packaged some for testing on a reduced gravity aircraft. In microgravity smells quickly permeate the environment and the agency found that the sherry triggered the gag reflex. Concern over public reaction to taking alcohol into space led NASA to abandon its plans, so astronauts drank the purchased supply while consuming their pre-mission special diet.\n\nThe astronauts of the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project (1975) received samples of Soviet space food when the combined crew dined together. Among the foods provided by Soyuz 19 were canned beef tongue, packaged Riga bread, and tubes of borscht (beet soup) and caviar. The borscht was labeled \"vodka\".\n\nAs part of the Interkosmos space program, allies of the Soviet Union have actively participated in the research and deployment of space technologies. The Institute of Cryobiology and Lyophilization (now the Institute of Cryobiology and Food Technology), founded in 1973 as a part of the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences, has since produced space food for the purposes of the program. The menu includes traditional Bulgarian dishes such as tarator, sarma, musaka, lyutenitza, kiselo mlyako, dried vegetables and fruits, etc.\n\nToday, fruits and vegetables that can be safely stored at room temperature are eaten on space flights. Astronauts also have a greater variety of main courses to choose from, and many request personalized menus from lists of available foods including items like fruit salad and spaghetti. Astronauts sometimes request beef jerky for flights, as it is lightweight, calorie dense, and can be consumed in orbit without packaging or other changes.\n\n\nNASA's Advanced Food Technology Project (AFT) is currently researching ways to ensure an adequate food supply for long-duration space exploration missions.\n\nDesigning food for consumption in space is an often difficult process. Foods must meet a number of criteria to be considered fit for space. Firstly, the food must be physiologically appropriate. Specifically, it must be nutritious, easily digestible, and palatable. Secondly, the food must be engineered for consumption in a zero gravity environment. As such, the food must be light, well packaged, fast to serve and require minimal cleaning up. (Foods that tend to leave crumbs, for example, are ill-suited for space.) Finally, foods require a minimum of energy expenditure throughout their use; they must store well, open easily and leave little waste behind.\n\nCarbonated drinks have been tried in space, but are not favored due to changes in belching caused by microgravity; without gravity to separate the liquid and gas in the stomach, burping results in a kind of vomiting called \"wet burping\". Coca-Cola and Pepsi were first carried on STS-51-F in 1985. Coca-Cola has flown on subsequent missions in a specially designed dispenser that utilizes BioServe Space Technologies hardware used for biochemical experiments. Space Station Mir carried cans of Pepsi in 1996.\n\nBeer has also been developed that counteracts the reduction of taste and smell reception in space and reduces the possibility of wet belches (vomiting caused by belching) in microgravity. Produced by Vostok 4-Pines Stout, a parabolic flight experiment validated that the reduced carbonation recipe met the criteria intended for space. Barley harvested from crops grown for several generations in space has also been brought back to Earth to produce beer. While not a space food (it used the same high carbonation 'Earth' recipe), the study did demonstrate that ingredients grown in space are safe for production.\n\nSpace bread has proved elusive because of a variety of challenges. By 2012 a method was suggested where dough is leavened by dissolved (as opposed to yeast) and cooked by a low-temperature process. This could allow fresh baked bread from bulk ingredients on future spaceflights.\n\nPackaging for space food serves the primary purposes of preserving and containing the food. The packaging, however, must also be light-weight, easy to dispose of and useful in the preparation of the food for consumption. The packaging also includes a bar-coded label, which allows for the tracking of an astronaut's diet. The labels also specify the food's preparation instructions in both English and Russian.\n\nMany foods from the Russian space program are packaged in cans and tins. These are heated through electro-resistive (ohmic) methods, opened with a can-opener, and the food inside consumed directly. Russian soups are hydrated and consumed directly from their packages.\n\nNASA space foods are packaged in retort pouches or employ freeze drying. They are also packaged in sealed containers which fit into trays to keep them in place. The trays include straps on the underside, allowing astronauts to attach the tray to an anchor point such as their legs or a wall surface and include clips for retaining a beverage pouch or utensils in the microgravity environment.\n\nThere are several classifications for food that is sent into space:\n\nMore common staples and condiments do not have a classification and are known simply by the item name:\n\nCapitalizing on the popularity of the Apollo space missions, Pillsbury marketed \"Food Sticks\" (also known as \"Space Food Sticks\") for the consumer market in the early 1970s. Fourteen individually packaged sticks were included in a box, and came in six flavors such as peanut butter, caramel, and chocolate. Food Sticks were marketed as a \"nutritionally balanced between meal snack\".\n\nMost of these products can now be found in NASA Space Center gift shops, general novelty shops or at Army Surplus stores. A popular example is freeze-dried ice cream. Campers have taken to using products such as Tang due to their reliability, but some others, such as many of the freeze dried foods, contain fragrances that can attract bears, cougars, and other forest animals.\n\nTang, originally marketed in 1959, also saw an increase in popularity during this era due to its inclusion on the manned space flights.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "7826437", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7826437", "title": "Species of The Saga of Seven Suns", "text": "Species of The Saga of Seven Suns\n\nThe races and Species of \"The Saga of Seven Suns\" are the assortment of humans and aliens represented in \"The Saga of Seven Suns\" series of science fiction novels written by Kevin J. Anderson and its sequel trilogy \"The Saga of Shadows\".\n\nThe human race is no longer confined to simply their home planet of Earth, and have spread out among the galaxy. Originally this was done using vast \"Generation\" spacecraft which took generations (as their name implies) to reach their destination. However, after the Generation ships were 'rescued' by the Ildirans, all spaceships quickly adapted to their far superior ekti-driven stardrives. There are three main factions among the humans.\n\nThe Terran Hanseatic League, known as the Hansa, control most of humanity's planets. They are an extensive commerce-based federation in control of Earth and most Terran colonies. They have a puppet king, who is more for show than anything else. The real power lies with the Chairman of the Hansa, who controls the king. They have trade relations with the Ildirans, who gave them the original Ildiran stardrive. Their military is the Earth Defense Forces, also known as the EDF. Their main religion is Unison, the head of which is the Archfather. They use compies, short for competent computerized companion. Compies are intelligent servant robots available in Friendly, Teacher, Governess, Listener, Analytical and other models. This is an interstellar version of the Hanseatic League which existed in northern Europe from the 13th through the 17th centuries.\n\nThe Roamers originated from the Kanaka, the last of the eleven generation ships to leave Earth. Originally intended to arrive on a planet and become colonists, they instead became the Roamers. This was brought about soon after the Ildirans brought their ancestors to the fertile planet, Iawa; during their first major harvest, the colonists' crops were all but annihilated by a virus that attacked Terran-based plant life. With their food reserves rapidly dwindling, the people decided to take their chances in space (where they had thrived), and so they all boarded the still intact Kanaka and set out into the vast galaxy once again. Eventually they re-established contact with the people they had left at the Meyer rubble belt, and all banded together to find a new way of life amongst the stars.\n\nRoamers are well known for their fierce independence, as well as their highly innovative (though somewhat dangerous) methods. They are normally referred to as 'Space Gypsies' or 'Roachers'. The Hansa do not think well of them, though they are required to trade with them for ekti, a vital stardrive fuel. This is one of their main sources of income. The Roamers use skymines, ekti-harvesting and processing facilities located in gas giant clouds, to acquire this fuel. They are the main source of ekti for both the Hansa and Ildiran Empire, though they do not have much trade with the Ildirans. They have next to no military force, relying mainly on secrecy to ensure their safety. The Roamer society is split up into multiple clans, their leader being a Speaker. Their 'capital' is at Rendezvous, a site which is kept very secret. They are extremely adaptable and can adjust their equipment and lifestyle to suit various harsh conditions. They rely on others for assistance, products, etc. as little as possible.\n\nThe Therons originated from the Caillié, fifth of the generation ships to depart Earth and first to be encountered by the Ildirans. The colonists of this ship were taken by the Ildirans to settle on Theroc. Their rulers are a Father and Mother, similar to a King and Queen. They live mainly on biological products, using next to no inorganic materials. The Therons have the capability of bonding with the worldforest (or verdani) to become green priests, who have telepathic relationships with the worldforest. They are, strictly speaking, independent of the Hansa. They have next to no military initially, although their alliance with the Verdani does give them protection to a certain degree. Following the centralization of the Confederation on their world however leads the Confederation Defense Force to protect the planet in addition to Verdani spacecraft.\n\nFormed by King Peter and Queen Estarra of the Hansa. The Confederation consists of Roamers, Therons and some former Hansa Colonies. The capital of The Confederation is on Theroc.\n\nThe Confederation was formed as an alternative to the increasingly oppressive Hansa, and as a response to the increasingly delusional Chairman of the Hanseatic League. Its incorporation of independent states such as the Roamers and Therons hints at a Federal nature, with a King hinting at some form of Monarchy, constitutional or otherwise.\n\nIts military is formed from a number of EDF (Earth Defence Force) ships that mutinied against the Hansa, and Roamer vessels outfitted with weaponry. Eventually the remaining 33 ships of the EDF and the 11 EDF ships of the Confederacy merged under the command of Fleet Admiral Sheila Willis. The Confederation is officially allied with the Ildiran Empire.\n\nAfter the assassination of Chairman Wenceslas and the dissolution of the Hanseatic League, the Confederacy incorporated all of Humanity and its widespread colonies, including Earth.\n\nThe Confederation's structure of governance relies upon individual governments for each planet, appropriately maintaining each planet while a central overhead Government oversees interstellar relations upon which the King and Queen monitor while still maintaining authority. Theroc is heart of the Confederation and is protected by the native Verdani.\n\nThe Ildirans are a polymorphic species ruled by the quasi-mystical Mage-Imperator, via an empathic link called the \"thism\". The thism links all Ildirans to their leader, who is in turn linked to the Lightsource, a warm, gentle communal light which brings peace and prosperity. The Lightsource may be considered an ancient alien race allied with the Ildirans, or their afterlife; descriptions vary throughout the series. Lens kithmen are able to focus the thism to touch each Ildiran. Traditionally the first born noble pure blood son of the previous Mage-Imperator, known as the Prime Designate, undergoes a ritual castration which will allow him to become the focal point for Thism. When a Mage-Imperator is killed, all members of the Ildiran race are cut off from the Lightsource. As Ildrians have a natural fear of the dark, it is urgent that they establish a new Mage-Imperator. All Ildrians can also feel when a Designate (son of the Mage-Imperator) or Designate-In-Waiting (son of new Mage-Imperator) dies, though they are less affected by it. An example of this is in Book Two, when Mage-Imperator Cyroc'h poisons himself, or in Book Three, when Designate-In-Waiting Pery'h is murdered on the orders of his corrupt uncle Rusa'h.\n\nSocially, the Ildiran are separated into castes (kiths), according to their dominant genetic traits. They vary widely, some seeming to cross the species gap by being nearly reptilian or avian. Most, especially the noble kith, are similar to baseline humans, with a pale golden or gray skin. Each Ildiran ends its name with a different sound to indicate kith; cross-breeds combine the sounds:\n\nIldirans are a stagnant race, mired in ritual and protocol, uninterested in expansion and content with the past glories described in their epic poem, the Saga of Seven Suns. The Saga of Seven Suns supposedly records every significant event in their history, and the task of retelling this epic is given to the rememberers. They are dependent on their thism-link with other Ildirans, so much so that isolation from other Ildirans can drive them into madness. The Ildirans invented the Ildiran stardrive, which uses ekti, an allotrope of hydrogen found mainly in gas giants, to quickly travel great distances. It is the only viable form of interstellar travel.\n\nThe Klikiss are an insectoid race that were thought to have become extinct 10,000 years before the beginning of the series. Their only remains are numerous ruins (some more or less intact, whilst others are wrecked beyond repair) scattered amongst worlds across the Spiral Arm. It is later discovered that some of the Klikiss' technology is still salvageable, as proven by the use of the Klikiss Torch and the inter-planetary portals found in a large number of their cities.\n\nAside from this, the only other legacy left behind by the Klikiss race is the large number of Klikiss robots (apparently designed in their likeness) that were reactivated half a millennia ago by the Ildirans. The robots themselves are very intricate in terms of design, with largely unknown inner workings. Though they all look identical, they each consider themselves unique in some respect, as they assign names to each member of their race. They have blunt speech mannerisms, and often do not reveal much about themselves or their motives.\n\nThe cause for the Klikiss' disappearance is a mystery to the rest of the galaxy, and the intelligent robots claim to have no knowledge of the events. Thus the dead race provides a very complex mystery, one which the human race has tried to unravel by studying the Klikiss ruins.\n\nIn reality, they were wiped out by the Hydrogues (in a deal with the Klikiss robots in exchange for Transportal technology), their robots (which turned on them) and the Ildirans, who did so to avoid being wiped out by the Hydrogues. A large number of them were killed instantaneously by passing through Transportals reprogrammed by their robots to send them to the cores of gas giants inhabited by the Hydrogues. The surviving robots are free to roam around the galaxy, but their purpose is dubious. The Ildirans do not have many dealings with them, although the Klikiss robots acted as negotiators between them and the Hydrogues, and some humans are wary of them. Although it appears that only a few of them survived, the 'awakened' ones are reviving their dormant comrades. They are allied with the Hydrogues, and are at war against Humanity in order to free their servant robots (\"compies\") - a reason why the Ildirans do not use similar technology.\n\nA number of Klikiss evidently survived the genocide, as they reappear (in droves) on the planet Llaro at the end of \"Of Fire and Night\", ready to take revenge on their traitorous robots and reclaim their old worlds, now colonized by the Hansa. In the 6th book - \"Metal Swarm\" - it is revealed that there are still thousands of Klikiss left which are divided into hives each ruled by a Breedex (like a queen bee in a bee hive). They live as a Eusocial society, all connected by a telepathic \"hive mind\" centred around the Breedex, similar to how the \"thism\" of Ildirans is centred round the Mage-Imperator, however it is more complex due to the fact no Klikiss on its own is sentient apart from the Breedex, and therefore Breedex has total control over the Klikiss minds. The Klikiss reproduce by absorbing organic matter and DNA from any living creature and incorporating it into newbreeds such as humans.\n\nLittle is known about the hydrogues. They are a highly aggressive, mercuric lifeform residing in the centres of gas giants and appear to lack emotions, being somewhat robotic in this sense. Hydrogues have the ability to alter their malleable forms, though they only tend to do this when communicating with other races (or \"rock-dwellers\"). They possess incredibly devastating weaponry (icewaves and powerful electrical blasts), and have no regard for the human race or Ildirans. They reappeared after the humans ignited the gas giant Oncier, which they inhabited, and began to destroy all human and Ildiran facilities, not appearing to distinguish between human factions, or even the two races. Their ships are spherical, heavily armoured (seemingly made out of diamond), and possess a great deal of firepower. They can completely destroy small celestial bodies within a day, and even extinguish stars. They represent the \"air\" aspect of the four elemental powers. During books 2-5 the Hydrogues were largely at war with the turncoat faeros, however the Klikiss Torch frequently deployed by the EDF forced their attention elsewhere. They are also at war with the Verdani (worldforest) and wentals. However the hydrogues beaten into submission by the combined attacks of the EDF, Ildrian Solar Navy, Verdani Battleships and the Roamers at the Battle for Earth in book 5.\n\nFollowing the end of the war the Hydrogues allow the use of Gas Giants for human purpose and even warn human presences of planetary threats.\n\nFaeros are fiery entities that dwell within suns, and are seemingly unaffected by the hazardous temperatures. They are considered to be treacherous by the Verdani. They once fought with the Verdani and Wentals against the Hydrogues, but then shifted alliances (for reasons relating to the Klikiss robots). In the ongoing war, they appear to have shifted alliances again, attacking the Hydrogues while sparing the other races. They represent the \"fire\" aspect of the four elemental powers.\n\nIt is suggested in \"Scattered Suns\" that the faeros may be the \"Lightsource\" from which the Ildiran \"thism\" is derived. This is expanded in \"Of Fire and Night\", in which the pretender to the Imperial Throne, Rusa'h, appears to be linked with the faeros, possibly in a similar manner to Jess Tamblynn and the wentals, or Beneto and the verdani. Also during the fifth book, a hydrogue emissary unknowingly hints that the Ildirans and faeros were once allies; later in the book, it seems that this bond (should the records be believed) was formed to drive off the evil Shana-Rei. When the Ildrians discover a dark nebulae the Faeros are actively afraid.\n\nAlso referred to as the \"Worldforest\", this race manifests itself as a telepathic network of trees that some humans (the Green Priests) can communicate with. Once the Verdani were present on thousands of worlds across the galaxy, but the conflict with the Hydrogues forced them to near-extinction. Losing the war has seemingly caused the Verdani to lose much of their combat resolve, as the mere thought of engaging a Hydrogue terrifies them.\n\nCurrently the largest concentration of Verdani reside on the planet Theroc, although they have started to be spread around the galaxy again with the aid of humans. They demonstrate the ability to absorb information like a sponge and store it eternally for later use by either themselves or other beings. This makes their thirst for new knowledge, whatever it may be, practically insatiable. Green priests are able to use Verdani as instant communication devices, sending any message across vast distances almost immediately. Although the Verdani are made up of many trees, they manifest themselves as one being. They represent the \"earth\" aspect of the four elemental powers.\n\nGreen priests have the ability to become part of the world-forest's mind upon their death, if they have time and ability to pour their souls into a tree as they die. The verdani are then capable of building a golem from one of these \"ghosts\", as they did with Beneto.\n\nWith the addition of wental water, the verdani are capable of producing \"treeships\", vast trees capable of interstellar flight, and able to destroy hydrogue warglobes with apparent ease. Each treeship requires a green priest joined in a permanent symbiosis to act as a pilot / navigator; such ships had been produced for the last war, ten millennia ago, piloted by a now-forgotten race of bird-like humanoids. These ships were sent into deep space, and returned to Theroc at the end of \"Scattered Suns\". An additional hundred were built during \"Of Fire and Night\". These large treeships are used to defend Theroc from orbit after the war.\n\nA water-based race who were considered extinct for 10,000 years after the war with the faeros/hydrogues, but in fact were broken up and dispersed throughout the interstellar void. Whilst wentals are unable to die, they can be \"disassociated\" into their more basic components, nullifying their sentience and thus putting them in a form of suspended animation. Like the verdani, they have some kind of telepathic link and speak as one.\n\nHowever, Jess Tamblyn accidentally collects wental essence while gathering water during a solitary deep-space mission. Because of this, the wentals are effectively brought back to life. They establish a telepathic link with him, telling him about the intergalactic war that took place millennia ago. Jess takes the wentals to an uninhabited oceanic planet and introduces them into the raging sea, initializing the first phase of the race's rebirth. They have the ability to take control of any water-based body (e.g. planets, comets) and control it, regardless of the state of the water. They can then manipulate the climate and lifeforms of the planet, and this is how they reproduce. They represent the \"water\" aspect of the four elemental powers.\n\nThough wentals are not hostile in nature, some aspects of their essence (under certain circumstances) can become 'tainted' due to strong selfish desires of their hosts. When trying to save Cesca from her excessive wounds, the wentals informed Jess of how tainted wentals had been formed in the past and caused great destruction. Fortunately, tainted wentals cannot propagate, but are eternally enraged by everything around them. They seek to replace order with chaos (what they feel is the 'Natural order') and thus attack all those around them. Tainted wentals can either be destroyed by killing the host body, or extracting the tainted essence and purifying it (a process which also kills the host). Karla Tamblyn became a Tainted Wental after Jess recovered her frozen body from within the ice of Plumas where she had died many years before. She was reanimated by tainted wental energy and almost completely destroyed the Clan Tamblyn homestead and water mines before Jess and the newly imbued Cesca returned and saved them.\n\nThe Shana Rei are an ancient, demonic and powerful race who personify darkness and chaos. Eons before the events of \"Hidden Empire\" (2002), they had battled the Ildirans and were eventually defeated with light-based weapons and an Ildiran alliance with the faeros. The Shana Rei are said to be the primary reason why Ildirans are afraid of the dark. In \"Scattered Suns\" (2005) it is discovered that parts of the Ildiran \"Saga of Seven Suns\" have been falsified, and the possibility arises that the Shana Rei might never have actually existed. More evidence emerges that they did in fact exist in \"Of Fire and Night\" (2006).\n\nThe Shana Rei reappear in the universe in \"The Dark Between the Stars\" (2014), awakened by another, unidentified universal power that is also arising after a long sleep. Hidden in the spaces behind our own universe, the Shana Rei resemble dark nebulae when they materialize in space. Disrupted by the deafening noise of life and creation, they hope to destroy all sentient life and return the universe to quiet emptiness and chaos. They trap the remaining Klikiss robots, and the robot leader Exxos convinces the Shana Rei to let his robots help in their plans. The Shana Rei and Klikiss robots begin attacking human and Ildiran warships, colonies and planets.\n\nA forgotten race who, long before the events of \"Hidden Empire\" (2002), had been hunted and extinguished by the Klikiss. In \"The Dark Between the Stars\" (2014), the Roamer Clan Reeves discovers and settles on an abandoned city in space which turns out to be formerly inhabited by a surviving group of the Onthos. They had been decimated by a Klikiss plague, however, and though they died out centuries or even millennia before, the human settlers are soon infected and killed themselves. Not long after, 99 spaceships appear at Theroc, containing another small group of Onthos. As the aliens touch the worldtrees, the verdani mind is reminded that the Onthos were once their caretakers long before humans, when the worldforest had originated on a different planet.\n\nA Condorfly is a fictional extraterrestrial insect which looks somewhat like a butterfly but is much larger, about the size of a dinner plate, roughly. Condorflies are unintelligent and very short-lived. Their bodies decompose fast after death leaving only their beautiful wings behind. They are only found on Theroc, and are often the pets of small children, kept on a long string to keep them from flying away.\n\nAlso, while appearing unintelligent one Condorfly, the pet of the Theron Mother and Father youngest child, Celli, was released into the wilderness to mate before it died, but it dutifully returned to her bed while she slept, seemingly to be with her one last time.\n\nShiny silver insects that live on Theroc.\n\nFurry crickets are unintelligent and are about the size of a rabbit, covered in fur and have long legs and antenna like a cricket. They are only found on Corribus. Furry crickets are portrayed as being readily tamed and affectionate despite appearing to be the primary prey animal for the known local predators. They are edible by humans even though they apparently don't taste very good.\n\nLowriders are carnivorous, crustaceans from the klikiss world of Corribus. They are described as having five eyes, a flattened spherical centre body and clockwork jaws. They live on furry cricket and flying creatures. They are noted as able to easily tear through bone and flesh.\n\nThese Nautilus/Snail like creatures are native to the sea world Rhejak and are so named for their numerous snakelike tentacles. They have two pairs of eyes, one pair for seeing above water and the other for below. Fully grown, they have shells the size of large rooms, and Rhejak natives use these shells as such, hollowing them out and connecting them together to make houses. Sometimes adolescents will ride these Medusas and get them to fight one another as entertainment. They also have edible meat described by Admiral Sheila Willis as having a rubbery texture \"like baked mushrooms\" and a strong flavour \"reminiscent of lobster\".\n\nA species of giant annelid with scarlet bodies and diamond chipped teeth, originating on Plumas. When Karla Tamblyn is reanimated by a tainted wental, she induces the nematodes to attack the water mine workers there.\n\nIsix cats are feline predators from the planet Ildira. They are quite deadly and, if they can be tamed, make exceptional guards. Yazra'h uses trained cats in her body guard duties. There were three of them originally before one was killed.\n\nA species of anemone native to Maratha. Ch'kanh have strong armoured crusts, which gives them their name (\"ch'kanh\" means \"living fortresses\" in Ildiran). Ch'kanh also have very sharp \"teeth\", which allow them to eat other creatures.\n\nShadow lions live on the planet Maratha. Their fur absorbs all light so they are extremely difficult to see at night. They can 'see' heat, due to their ability to perceive the infra-red spectrum and follow it to catch their prey. In the dark, Ildirans separated from other Ildirans often mistake these creatures for the Shana Rei. They are ruthless carnivores which demonstrate no fear.\n"}

Storgic lovers are friends first, and the friendship, and the storge, can endure even beyond the breakup of the sexual relationship. They want their significant others to also be their best friends, and will choose their mates based on similar goals and interests—homogamy. Storgic lovers place much importance on commitment, and find that their motivation to avoid committing infidelity is to preserve the trust between the two partners. Children and marriage are seen as legitimate long-term aims for their bond, while passionate sexual intensity is of lesser importance than in other love styles.\n\nAdvantages of storgic love may be the level of how one loves their family and understands each other. In addition, two people who are deeply devoted to one another can feel the intimacy that they share.\n\nThe main disadvantages of storgic love may be the large time investment and the loss of that investment if the friendship ends.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "47113785", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=47113785", "title": "Suicide in Nepal", "text": "Suicide in Nepal\n\nSuicide in Nepal has become a minor national issue highlighted by a series of high-profile suicides in recent years\n\nThe rate of suicide in Nepal has been reported to be as low as 3.7/100,000 as a result of under reporting caused by issues of legality, social stigma, and logistical problems.\n\nSuicide is illegal in Nepal and is punishable by fines and imprisonment. According to the director of Samanta, a Nepalese organization for women’s rights, \"most families will never report suicide cases as they are afraid of being entangled in police cases.\" In attempts to avoid legal trouble, suicidal patients and their families may avoid going to hospitals for treatment. Even after death, victims of suicide may have their deaths misattributed to avoid legal problems for their families.\n\nFamilies may also avoid reporting suicides due to social stigma and discrimination against people with mental health problems. Despite the recent abundance of articles discussing suicide in Nepal, issues related to suicide are largely avoided, both as the result and perpetuation of a powerful social stigma against mental illness. For women in particular, the under reporting of suicides and suicide-attempts may be caused in part by a \"culture of silence\", especially in cases related to domestic abuse.\n\nFinally, logistical issues pose a threat to accurate reporting and record keeping. According to the Nepal Health Sector Support Programme, due to \"poor record keeping by police and hospitals\" as well as the fact that \"registration systems are inaccurate and of poor quality,\" suicide may continue to be under reported even if social and legal issues were to be resolved.\n\nIn 2009, the Nepalese Family Health Division's Maternal Mortality and Morbidity Study published the \"shocking finding\" that suicide was the leading cause of death for women of reproductive age (15-49). According to the report, \"analysis of verbal autopsy data indicates mental health problems, relationships, marriage and family issues are key factors\" with 21% of suicides among women of reproductive age consisting of women 18 or younger, \"indicating that youth is a factor to be investigated.\" Although the suicide rate for men remains higher almost universally as well as in Nepal (30.1/100,000 for men, 20.0/100,000 for women), Nepal has a relatively high ratio of female:male suicides and stands out as being ranked 17th for male suicide rates but 3rd for female suicide rates. It's worth noting that while male suicide rates are higher, it is estimated that Nepalese women attempt suicide three times more than men do. Additionally, the tie ins to maternal health, domestic violence, and youth have made female suicide a prominent issue. A case study published in the same mortality report exemplifies the type of problems that women may face:\n\nSanju was a 21 years old, illiterate and mother of two children. By her third pregnancy she was anaemic and malnourished, feeling dizzy and weak, but she received no antenatal care. In her third month of pregnancy she was about to travel to her maternal home with her husband, but her relatives stopped her as there was a flood. She went to her room to rest, but when her mother-in-law went to her room an hour later she said she had eaten some medicine for killing lice. Her husband, mother-in-law and neighbour took her to the local medicine shop in their cart, and the pharmacist immediately referred her to the district hospital. The family borrowed money and took her to hospital in a private van, a 25 minute journey. She was admitted to the emergency ward and attended to by the doctor immediately, but died within a few hours. The above account was given by her mother-in-law. However, the female community health volunteer said Sanju suffered from hysteria and was being forced to have an illicit relationship with her father-in-law. She was treated for her hysteria but forced to continue the relationship, and therefore was tense. The FCHV and VHW felt this may have been the reason she committed suicide.\n\nMore indirectly, gender based inequality in Nepal has been suggested as the cause of female suicide in Nepal. The prominence of suicide among women of reproductive age may be as a result of unwanted pregnancies and early marriages. For Nepalese women, being married can come with the cost of leaving one's family and friends, creating a \"perennial cycle of dependence, which may lead some to view suicide as their only option.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "28049428", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=28049428", "title": "True threat", "text": "True threat\n\nA true threat is a threatening communication that can be prosecuted under the law. It is distinct from a threat that is made in jest. The U.S. Supreme Court has held that true threats are not protected under the U.S. Constitution based on three justifications: preventing fear, preventing the disruption that follows from that fear, and diminishing the likelihood that the threatened violence will occur. There is some concern that even satirical speech could be regarded as a \"true threat\" due to concern over terrorism.\n\nThe true threat doctrine was established in the 1969 Supreme Court case \"Watts v. United States\". In that case, an eighteen-year-old male was convicted in a Washington, D.C. District Court for violating a statute prohibiting persons from knowingly and willfully making threats to harm or kill the President of the United States. The conviction was based on a statement made by Watts, in which he said, \"[i]f they ever make me carry a rifle the first man I want to get in my sights is L.B.J.\" Watts appealed, leading to the Supreme Court finding the statute constitutional on its face, but reversing the conviction of Watts. \n\nIn reviewing the lower court's analysis of the case, the Court noted that \"a threat must be distinguished from what is constitutionally protected speech.\" The Court recognized that \"uninhibited, robust, and wideopen\" political debate can at times be characterized by \"vehement, caustic, and sometimes unpleasantly sharp attacks on government and public officials.\" In light of the context of Watts' statement - and the laughter that it received from the crowd - the Court found that it was more \"a kind of very crude offensive method of stating a political opposition to the President\" than a \"true threat.\" In so holding, the Court established that there is a \"true threat\" exception to protected speech, but also that the statement must be viewed in its context and distinguished from protected hyperbole. The opinion, however, stopped short of defining precisely what constituted a \"true threat.\" \n\n"}

At age 18, he headed the tenants in defending the Blakeney estate against the Rapparees. As a volunteer he fought the war in Flanders, and at the Siege of Venlo in 1702 won his commission.\nHe served as a subaltern throughout Marlborough's campaigns, and is said to have been the first to drill troops by signal of drum or colour.\nBetween 1725 and 1757, he represented Kilmallock in the Irish House of Commons.\n\nFor many years after the peace of Utrecht he served unnoticed, and was 65 years of age before he became a colonel. This neglect, which was said to be due to the hostility of Lord Verney, ceased when the Duke of Richmond was appointed colonel of Blakeney's regiment, and thenceforward his advance was rapid.\nBrigadier-general in the Cartagena expedition of 1741, and major-general a little later, he distinguished himself by his gallant and successful defence of Stirling Castle against the Highlanders in 1745.\nTwo years later George II made him lieutenant-general and lieutenant-governor of Menorca.\n\nThe governor of that island never set foot in it, and Blakeney was left in command for ten years.\nIn 1756 the Seven Years' War was preluded by a swift descent of the French on Menorca. Fifteen thousand troops under marshal the duc de Richelieu, escorted by a strong squadron under the marquis de la Gallisonnière, landed on the island on 18 April, and at once began the siege, where Blakeney commanded at most some 5,000 soldiers and workmen.\n\nThe defence, in spite of crumbling walls and rotted gun platforms, had already lasted a month when a weak, undersupplied British fleet under Vice-admiral John Byng appeared. La Gallisonnière and Byng fought, on 20 May, an indecisive battle. Byng left Blakeney to his fate after his fleet lost over 400 men. Byng sailed for the nearest port repair facilities in the Mediterranean, that being Gibraltar, where he hoped to repair his fleet for a return.\n\nA second expedition subsequently appeared off Menorca, but it was then too late, for after a heroic resistance of seventy-one days the old general had been compelled to surrender the fort to Richelieu (18 April28 June 1756). Only the ruined fortifications were the prize of the victors. Blakeney and his little garrison were transported to Gibraltar, with absolute liberty to serve again. Byng was tried and executed; Blakeney, on his return to England, found himself the hero of the nation.\n\nHe was made a colonel of the 27th (Inniskilling) Regiment of Foot, a Knight Companion of the Bath, and Baron Blakeney in the Irish peerage. Later, John Van Nost the Younger's statue of him was erected in Dublin (on the site of the present-day Spire of Dublin), and his popularity continued unabated for the short remainder of his life. He died unmarried on 10 September 1761, and was buried in Westminster Abbey. The barony became extinct upon his death.\n\n\n"}

It was developed by Hugh R. Wilson and Jack D. Cowan and extensions of the model have been widely used in modeling neuronal populations. The model is important historically because it uses phase plane methods and numerical solutions to describe the responses of neuronal populations to stimuli. Because the model neurons are simple, only elementary limit cycle behavior, i.e. neural oscillations, and stimulus-dependent evoked responses are predicted. The key findings include the existence of multiple stable states, and hysteresis, in the population response.\n\nThe Wilson–Cowan model considers a homogeneous population of interconnected neurons of excitatory and inhibitory subtypes. The fundamental quantity is the measure of the activity of an excitatory or inhibitory subtype within the population. More precisely, formula_1 and formula_2 are respectively the proportions of excitatory and inhibitory cells firing at time t. They depend on the proportion of sensitive cells (that are not refractory) and on the proportion of these cells receiving at least threshold excitation.\n\nProportion of cells in refractory period (absolute refractory period formula_3)\nformula_4\n\nProportion of sensitive cells (complement of refractory cells)\nformula_5\n\nIf formula_6 denotes a cell's threshold potential and formula_7 is the distribution of thresholds in the tissue, then the expected proportion of neurons receiving an excitation at or above threshold level per unit time is\n\nformula_8,\n\nwhere formula_9 is the mean integrated excitation at time t. The term \"integrated\" in this case means that each neuron sums up (i.e. integrates) all incoming excitations in a linear fashion to receive its total excitation. If this integrated excitation is at or above the neuron's excitation threshold, it will in turn create an action potential. Note that the above equation relies heavily on the homogeneous distribution of neurons, as does the Wilson-Cowan model in general.\n\nSubpopulation response function based on the distribution of afferent synapses per cell (all cells have the same threshold)\n\nformula_10\n\nAverage excitation level of an excitatory cell at time formula_11\n\nformula_12\n\nwhere formula_13 is the stimulus decay function, formula_14 and formula_15 are respectively the connectivity coefficient giving the average number of excitatory and inhibitory synapses per cell, P(t) is the external input to the excitatory population.\n\nExcitatory subpopulation expression\n\nformula_16\n\nComplete Wilson–Cowan model\n\nformula_17\n\nformula_18\n\nTime Coarse Graining\nformula_19\n\nIsocline Equation\nformula_20\n\nSigmoid Function\nformula_21\n\nThe determination of three concepts is fundamental to an understanding of hypersynchronization of neurophysiological activity at the global (system) level:\n\n\n\nA canonical analysis of these issues, developed in 2008 by Shusterman and Troy using the Wilson–Cowan model, predicts qualitative and quantitative features of epileptiform activity. In particular, it accurately predicts the propagation speed of epileptic seizures (which is approximately 4–7 times slower than normal brain wave activity) in a human subject with chronically implanted electroencephalographic electrodes.\n\nThe transition from normal state of brain activity to epileptic seizures was not formulated theoretically until 2008, when a theoretical path from a baseline state to large-scale self-sustained oscillations, which spread out uniformly from the point of stimulus, has been mapped for the first time.\n\nA realistic state of baseline physiological activity has been defined, using the following two-component definition:\n\n(1) A time-independent component represented by subthreshold excitatory activity E and superthreshold inhibitory activity I.\n\n(2) A time-varying component which may include singlepulse waves, multipulse waves, or periodic waves caused by spontaneous neuronal activity.\n\nThis baseline state represents activity of the brain in the state of relaxation, in which neurons receive some level of spontaneous, weak stimulation by small, naturally present concentrations of neurohormonal substances. In waking adults this state is commonly associated with alpha rhythm, whereas slower (theta and delta) rhythms are usually observed during deeper relaxation and sleep. To describe this general setting, a 3-variable formula_22 spatially dependent extension of the classical Wilson–Cowan model can be utilized. Under appropriate initial conditions, the excitatory component, u, dominates over the inhibitory component, I, and the three-variable system reduces to the two-variable Pinto-Ermentrout type model\n\nformula_23\nformula_24\n\nThe variable v governs the recovery of excitation u; formula_25 and formula_26 determine the rate of change of recovery. The connection function formula_27 is positive, continuous, symmetric, and has the typical form formula_28. In Ref. formula_29 The firing rate function, which is generally accepted to have a sharply increasing sigmoidal shape, is approximated by formula_30, where H denotes the Heaviside function; formula_31 is a short-time stimulus. This formula_32 system has been successfully used in a wide variety of neuroscience research studies. In particular, it predicted the existence of spiral waves, which can occur during seizures; this theoretical prediction was subsequently confirmed experimentally using optical imaging of slices from the rat cortex.\n\nThe expansion of hypersynchronized regions exhibiting large-amplitude stable bulk oscillations occurs when the oscillations coexist with the stable rest state formula_33. To understand the mechanism responsible for the expansion, it is necessary to linearize the formula_34 system around formula_35 when formula_36 is held fixed. The linearized system exhibits subthreshold decaying oscillations whose frequency increases as formula_37 increases. At a critical value formula_38 where the oscillation frequency is high enough, bistability occurs in the formula_39 system: a stable, spatially independent, periodic solution (bulk oscillation) and a stable rest state coexist over a continuous range of parameters. When formula_40 where bulk oscillations occur, \"The rate of expansion of the hypersynchronization region is determined by an interplay between two key features: (i) the speed c of waves that form and propagate outward from the edge of the region, and (ii) the concave shape of the graph of the activation variable u as it rises, during each bulk oscillation cycle, from the rest state u=0 to the activation threshold. Numerical experiments show that during the rise of \nu towards threshold, as the rate of vertical increase slows down, over time interval formula_41 due to the concave component, the stable solitary wave emanating from the region causes the region to expand spatially at a Rate proportional to the wave speed. From this initial observation it is natural to expect that the proportionality constant should be the fraction of the time that the solution is concave during one cycle.\" Therefore, when formula_40, the rate of expansion of the region is estimated by\n\nformula_43\n\nwhere formula_44 is the length of subthreshold time interval, T is period of the periodic solution; c is the speed of waves emanating from the hypersynchronization region. A realistic value of c, derived by Wilson et al., is c=22.4 mm/s.\n\nHow to evaluate the ratio formula_45 To determine values for formula_46 it is necessary to analyze the underlying bulk oscillation which satisfies the spatially independent system\n\nformula_47\nformula_48\n\nThis system is derived using standard functions and parameter values formula_49, formula_50 and formula_51 Bulk oscillations occur when formula_52. When formula_53, Shusterman and Troy analyzed the bulk oscillations and found formula_54. This gives the range\nformula_55\nSince formula_54, Eq. (1) shows that the migration Rate is a fraction of the traveling wave speed, which is consistent with experimental and clinical observations regarding the slow spread of epileptic activity. This migration mechanism also provides a plausible explanation for spread and sustenance of epileptiform activity without a driving source that, despite a number of experimental studies, has never been observed.\n\nThe rate of migration of hypersynchronous activity that was experimentally recorded during seizures in a human subject, using chronically implanted subdural electrodes on the surface of the left temporal lobe, has been estimated as\nformula_57,\nwhich is consistent with the theoretically predicted range given above in (2). The ratio Rate/c in formula (1) shows that the leading edge of the region of synchronous seizure activity migrates approximately 4–7 times more slowly than normal brain wave activity, which is in agreement with the experimental data described above.\n\nTo summarize, mathematical modeling and theoretical analysis of large-scale electrophysiological activity provide tools for predicting the spread and migration of hypersynchronous brain activity, which can be useful for diagnostic evaluation and management of patients with epilepsy. It might be also useful for predicting migration and spread of electrical activity over large regions of the brain that occur during deep sleep (Delta wave), cognitive activity and in other functional settings.\n"}
