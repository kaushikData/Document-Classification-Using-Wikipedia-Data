Some scholars indicate that the name is not a personal name, but a Bulgar military title \"alp bagatur\" (great hero) or \"alo bagatur\" (commander of heroes). \n\nConstantine Porphyrogennetos argues that for some time Alogobotur led all of the Bulgarian armies. In 926, Alogobotur was in command of a campaign against the Serbs who were plotting with the Byzantines against the Bulgarian Empire. He was then to invade the newly established Kingdom of Croatia which was in alliance with the Byzantine Empire. The Serbs were easily defeated and fled to Croatia but the campaign in the later ended with a disaster: the Bulgarian army was completely defeated in the battle of the Bosnian Highlands by the Croats under their King Tomislav in 926. Alogobotur most probably perished in the battle along with most of his soldiers. \n"}

However, in 2017 China issued a plan to become the global leader in artificial intelligence by 2030. \n\nChina is home to several major AI-centric companies, including Baidu, Tencent, and Alibaba. China is also home to countless startups related to the development of AI. SenseTime, founded in 2014 by researchers at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, produces computer vision technology for large Chinese companies such as China Mobile and JD.com. Peking University introduced the first academic course on AI in 2004, leading many other Chinese universities to adopt AI as a discipline.\n\nThe gap between China's AI industry and that of the United States is closing fast in terms of private investment, patents, and publications . Many AI experts have speculated that China will struggle to recruit experts in the field . However, China also boasts of some advantages which could prove to be critical. China has a strong precedent of government investment leading to industrial development. Further, fewer regulations hinder data collection and usage in China, which has proven to be advantageous in the realm of facial recognition . In summary, China benefits from stronger government dedication to the industry and fewer obstacles related to privacy and data integrity.\n\nIn April 2018, CNN noted that the two AI startups with the highest evaluation, SenseTime (4.5 billion USD) and Yitu Technology (2.4 billion USD), are both Chinese.\n\nChina's State Council issued the \"A Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan\" (State Council Document [2017] No. 35) on July 8, 2017, in which the CCP Central Committee and the State Council urge the governing bodies of China to promote the development of artificial intelligence. The State Council predicts that China will become a world-leader in artificial intelligence by 2030. Specifically, the State Council plans to spend $2.1 billion on an AI industrial park in Mentougou district . In order to achieve this end, the State Council states the need for massive talent acquisition, theoretical and practical developments, and public and private investments. In the document, the State Council lists myriad sectors open to the future influence of artificial intelligence, including transportation, healthcare, environmental protection, national security, social governance, and education. Throughout the document, the State Council emphasizes the need for focus on the ethics of artificial intelligence. \n\nThe State Council cites many motivating factors in their desire to become a global leader in artificial intelligence. Primarily, the State Council focuses on the potential for industrial growth and transformation. The State Council recognizes that \"AI has become the core driving force for a new round of industrial transformation.\" Many of their motivating factors resemble those of the West -- industry and national security, as well as \"education, medical care, pensions, environmental protection, urban operations, judicial services, and other fields.\" However, the State Council also alludes to motivating factors that do not resemble those of the West. The State Council details the potential of artificial intelligence to \"grasp group cognition and psychological changes in a timely manner... elevate the capability and level of social governance... maintain social stability.\" \n\nThe State Council acknowledges several relative advantages and disadvantages with regard to AI innovation potential, when compared to the West.\n\nThe State Council cites preceding development plans, such as the National Key Research and Development Plan, Internet +, and AI Three-Year Activities and Implementation Program as evidence of forthcoming success. The State Council draws attention to the fact that China is \"leading the world in voice recognition and visual recognition technologies.\" Further, they note that China is second in the world in international publications and patents in the domain of artificial intelligence. Instructing their audience to \"fully give play to the advantages of the socialist system,\" the State Council claims that the greater levels of central coordination will allow them to more efficiently make advancements in such a complex industry. Developments in AI will require a collaboration between the regulatory bodies, private enterprises, educational institutions, and military researchers, so they make a valid point with their claim. \n\nThe State Council acknowledges that China is not quite at the level of developed countries (particularly the United States) with regard to AI development. They admit that China is \"lacking major original results in basic theory, core algorithms, key equipment, high-end chips, major products and systems. foundational materials, components, software and interfaces, etc.\" \n\nThe State Council reports three general milestones for their integration of artificial intelligence into their industrial economy.\n\nBy 2020, China expects to be \"in step with globally advanced levels\" of artificial intelligence theoretical and technological development. The State Council foresees that by this time \"AI technology applications will have become a new way to improve people's livelihoods.\" The State Council predicts that China will have contributed globally to hardware, software, and methods pertinent to artificial intelligence. Specifically, the State Council projects the value of AI core industry in China to be worth 150 billion RMB, with a value of over 1 trillion RMB when accounting for related industries.\n\nBy 2025, the State Council aims for China to have fundamentally contributed to basic AI theory, solidifying its place as a global leader in AI research. Further, the State Council aims that \"AI becomes the main driving force for China's industrial upgrading and economic transformation\" by this time. The State Council projects the value of AI core industry in China to be worth 400 billion RMB, with a value of over 5 trillion RMB when accounting for related industries.\n\nBy this time, the State Council targets China to be the global leader in the development of artificial intelligence theory and technology. The State Council claims that China will have developed a \"mature new-generation AI theory and technology system.\" At this point, the State Council projects the value of AI core industry to be worth 1 trillion RMB, with a value of over 10 trillion RMB when accounting for related industries.\n\nThe State Council recognizes that talent acquisition is arguably the most crucial endeavor in bolstering its AI industry. The State Council wishes to produce individuals capable of reasoning about the whole spectrum of AI development, including components such as basic theory, application, and product development. The State Council states a desire to solidify AI as a discipline, and formalize its treatment in universities. Further, they plan on constructing \"national AI industrial parks.\" They even go so far as to suggest AI-related courses in primary and secondary schools. Extending upon educational infrastructure, the State Council aims to provide \"AI 'hackerspaces'\" and \"entrepreneurial service agencies\" dedicated to AI.\n\nThe State Council emphasized the importance of ethics in AI development. In each of their three milestones (2020, 2025, and 2030), the State Council includes a specific goal related to the development of research into or enforcement of AI-related ethics. Despite the fear of many Westerners that the Chinese will disregard privacy concerns and other data-related rights infringements, the State Council states its wishes to \"increase disciplinary efforts aimed at the abuse of data, violations of personal privacy, and actions contrary to moral ethics.\" In the short term, the State Council aims to look into AI's effects on employment, while it aims to look into AI's effects on social ethics in the long term.\n"}
{"id": "21189400", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21189400", "title": "Assassination of Martin Luther King Jr.", "text": "Assassination of Martin Luther King Jr.\n\nMartin Luther King Jr., an American clergyman and civil rights leader, was shot at the Lorraine Motel in Memphis, Tennessee, on April 4, 1968. King was rushed to St. Joseph's Hospital, and was pronounced dead at 7:05 p.m. CST. He was a prominent leader of the Civil Rights Movement and a Nobel Peace Prize laureate who was known for his use of nonviolence and civil disobedience.\n\nJames Earl Ray, a fugitive from the Missouri State Penitentiary, was arrested on June 8, 1968, in London at Heathrow Airport, extradited to the United States, and charged with the crime. On March 10, 1969, he pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 99 years in the Tennessee State Penitentiary. He later made many attempts to withdraw his guilty plea and be tried by a jury, but was unsuccessful; he died in prison on April 23, 1998, at age 70.\n\nAs early as the mid-1950s, King had received death threats due to his prominence in the Civil Rights Movement. He had confronted the risk of death, including a nearly fatal stabbing in 1958, and made its recognition part of his philosophy. He taught that murder could not stop the struggle for equal rights. After the assassination of President Kennedy in 1963, King told his wife Coretta, \"This is what is going to happen to me also. I keep telling you, this is a sick society.\"\n\nKing traveled to Memphis, Tennessee, in support of striking African American city sanitation workers. The workers had staged a walkout on February 11, 1968, to protest unequal wages and working conditions imposed by then-mayor Henry Loeb. At the time, Memphis paid black workers significantly lower wages than whites. There were no city-issued uniforms, no restrooms, no recognized union, and no grievance procedure for the numerous occasions on which they were underpaid. During Loeb's tenure as Mayor, conditions did not significantly improve, and the gruesome February 1968 deaths of two workers in a garbage-compacting truck turned mounting tensions into a strike.\n\nKing participated in a massive march in Memphis on March 28, 1968, that ended in violence. On April 3, King returned to Memphis to attempt a successful new march later that week. His airline flight to Memphis was delayed by a bomb threat but he arrived in time to make a planned speech to a gathering at the Mason Temple (World Headquarters of the Church of God in Christ).\n\nThere, King delivered the speech, now known as the \"I've Been to the Mountaintop\" address. In it, he recalled his 1958 attempted assassination, noting that the doctor who treated him said that because the knife used to stab him was so near to his aorta, any sudden movement, even a sneeze, might have killed him. He referred to a letter, written by a young girl, who told him she was happy he had not sneezed. He used that reference to say,\n\nHe repeated the phrase, \"If I had sneezed\", several more times, recalling numerous other events and acts of civil disobedience of the previous several years: the Albany Movement (1962), the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom in 1963, and the Selma to Montgomery March (1965).\n\nAs he neared the close, he referred to the bomb threat:\n\nOn Thursday, April 4, 1968, King was staying in room 306 at the Lorraine Motel in Memphis. The motel was owned by businessman Walter Bailey and named after his wife. Reverend Ralph Abernathy, a colleague and friend, later told the House Select Committee on Assassinations he and King had stayed in room 306 at the Lorraine Motel so often that it was known as the \"King–Abernathy Suite\".\n\nAccording to biographer Taylor Branch, King's last words were to musician Ben Branch, who was scheduled to perform that night at a planned event. King said, \"Ben, make sure you play 'Take My Hand, Precious Lord' in the meeting tonight. Play it real pretty.\"\n\nKing had gone out onto the balcony and was standing near his room when he was struck at 6:01 p.m. by a single .30-06 bullet fired from a Remington Model 760 rifle. The bullet entered through King's right cheek, breaking his jaw and several vertebrae as it traveled down his spinal cord, severing his jugular vein and major arteries in the process, before lodging in his shoulder. The force of the shot ripped King's necktie off. King fell violently backward onto the balcony, unconscious. \n\nShortly after the shot was fired, witnesses saw a man, later believed to be James Earl Ray, fleeing from a rooming house across the street from the Lorraine Motel. Ray had been renting a room there. Police found a package dumped close to the site, which included a rifle and binoculars, both with Ray's fingerprints. Ray had purchased the rifle under an alias six days earlier. A worldwide manhunt was triggered, which culminated in the arrest of Ray at London's Heathrow Airport two months later.\n\nAt the time, Abernathy heard the shot from inside the motel room and ran to the balcony to find King on the deck, bleeding profusely from the wound in his cheek. Jesse Jackson stated after the shooting that he cradled King's head as King lay on the balcony, but this account was disputed by other colleagues of King; Jackson later changed his statement to say that he had \"reached out\" for King. Andrew Young, a colleague from the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, first believed King was dead, but found he still had a pulse.\n\nKing was rushed to St. Joseph's Hospital, where doctors opened his chest and performed cardiopulmonary resuscitation. He never regained consciousness and was pronounced dead at 7:05 p.m. \nPaul Hess, assistant administrator at St. Joseph's Hospital, where Dr. King died despite emergency surgery, said the minister had \"received a gunshot wound on the right side of the neck, at the root of the neck, a gaping wound. He was pronounced dead at 7:05 P.M. Central standard time (8:05 P.M. New York time) by staff doctors,\" Mr. Hess said. \"They did everything humanly possible.\" \nAccording to Taylor Branch, his autopsy revealed that despite being aged just 39, his heart was in the condition of a 60-year-old man, which Branch attributed to the stress of his 13 years in the Civil Rights Movement.\n\nMrs. King had difficulty settling her children with the news that their father was deceased. She received a large number of telegrams, including one from Lee Harvey Oswald's mother, which she regarded as the one that touched her the most.\n\nFor some, King's assassination meant the end of the strategy of nonviolence. Others in the movement reaffirmed the need to carry on King's and the movement's work. Leaders within the SCLC confirmed they would carry on the Poor People's Campaign that year despite his loss. Some black leaders argued the need to continue King's and the movement's tradition of nonviolence.\n\nThat night, Senator Robert F. Kennedy, running to gain the presidential nomination to represent the Democratic Party, spoke about the assassination. Kennedy had spoken earlier that day in Indiana and learned about the shooting before boarding a plane to Indianapolis. He had a speech scheduled there in a predominantly black neighborhood of the city. His press secretary Frank Mankiewicz suggested he ask the audience to pray for the King family and to follow King's practice of nonviolence. Kennedy did not learn King had died until he landed in Indianapolis.\n\nMankiewicz and speechwriter Adam Walinsky drafted notes for Kennedy's use, but he refused them, using some he likely had written during the ride to the site. The Indianapolis chief of police advised Kennedy he could not provide protection and was worried he would be at risk in talking about the death of the revered leader. Kennedy decided to go ahead. Standing on a flatbed truck, Kennedy spoke for four minutes and fifty-seven seconds.\n\nHe was the first to tell the audience King had died; some of the attendees screamed and wailed in grief. Several of Kennedy's aides were worried that the delivery of this information would result in a riot. When the audience quieted, Kennedy acknowledged many would be filled with anger. He said: \"For those of you who are black and are tempted to be filled with hatred and mistrust of the injustice of such an act, against all white people, I would only say that I can also feel in my own heart the same kind of feeling. I had a member of my family killed, but he was killed by a white man.\" These remarks surprised his aides, who had never heard him speak publicly of his brother's death. Kennedy said the country had to make an effort to \"go beyond these rather difficult times\", and quoted a poem by the Greek playwright Aeschylus, \"Even in our sleep, pain which cannot forget falls drop by drop upon the heart until, in our own despair, against our will, comes wisdom through the awful grace of God.\" In conclusion, he said the country needed and wanted unity between blacks and whites, and asked the audience members to pray for the King family and the country, quoting the Greeks again.\n\nHis speech was credited in part with preventing post-assassination rioting in Indianapolis, on a night where such events broke out in major cities across the country. It is widely considered one of the greatest speeches in American history.\n\nKennedy subsequently canceled all of his scheduled campaign appearances and withdrew to his hotel room. Several phone conversations with black community leaders convinced him to speak out against the violent backlash beginning to emerge across the country. The next day, Kennedy gave a prepared response, \"On the Mindless Menace of Violence\", in Cleveland, Ohio. Although still considered significant, it is given much less historical attention than the Indianapolis speech.\n\nPresident Lyndon B. Johnson was in the Oval Office that evening, planning a meeting in Hawaii with Vietnam War military commanders. After press secretary George Christian informed him at 8:20 p.m. of the assassination, he canceled the trip to focus on the nation. He assigned Attorney General Ramsey Clark to investigate the assassination in Memphis. He made a personal call to King's wife, Coretta Scott King, and declared April 7 a national day of mourning, on which the U.S. flag would be flown at half-staff.\n\nColleagues of King in the Civil Rights Movement called for a nonviolent response to the assassination, to honor his most deeply held beliefs. James Farmer Jr. said:\n\nDr. King would be greatly distressed to find that his blood had triggered off bloodshed and disorder. I think instead the nation should be quiet; black and white, and we should be in a prayerful mood, which would be in keeping with his life. We should make that kind of dedication and commitment to the goals which his life served to solving the domestic problems. That's the memorial, that's the kind of memorial we should build for him. It's just not appropriate for there to be violent retaliations, and that kind of demonstration in the wake of the murder of this pacifist and man of peace.\n\nHowever, the more militant Stokely Carmichael called for forceful action, saying:\n\nWhite America killed Dr. King last night. She made it a whole lot easier for a whole lot of black people today. There no longer needs to be intellectual discussions, black people know that they have to get guns. White America will live to cry that she killed Dr. King last night. It would have been better if she had killed Rap Brown and/or Stokely Carmichael, but when she killed Dr. King, she lost.\n\nDespite the urging for calm by many leaders, a nationwide wave of riots erupted in more than 100 cities. After the assassination, the city of Memphis quickly settled the strike on favorable terms to the sanitation workers.\n\nOn April 8, King's widow, Coretta Scott King, together with the couple's four small children, led a crowd estimated at 40,000 in a silent march through the streets of Memphis to honor the fallen leader and support the cause of the city's black sanitation workers.\n\nThe next day, funeral rites for King were held in his hometown of Atlanta, Georgia. The service at Ebenezer Baptist Church was nationally televised, as were these other events. A funeral procession transported King's body for 3.5 miles through the streets of Atlanta, followed by more than 100,000 mourners, from the church to his alma mater of Morehouse College. A second service was held there before the burial.\n\nIn the wake of King's assassination, journalists reported some callous or hostile reactions from parts of white America, particularly in the South. David Halberstam, who reported on King's funeral, recounted a comment heard at an affluent white dinner party:\n\nOne of the wives—station wagon, three children, forty-five-thousand-dollar house—leaned over and said, \"I wish you had spit in his face for me.\" It was a stunning moment; I wondered for a long time afterwards what King could possibly have done to her, in what conceivable way he could have threatened her, why this passionate hate.\n\nReporters recounted that many whites were also grief-stricken at the leader's death. In some cases, the shock of events altered opinions. A survey later sent to a group of college trustees revealed their opinions of King had risen after his assassination. \"The New York Times\" praised King in an editorial, calling his murder a \"national disaster\" and his cause \"just\".\n\nPublic figures generally praised King in the days following his death. Others expressed political ideology. Governor George Wallace of Alabama, known as a segregationist, described the assassination as a \"senseless, regrettable act\". But Governor Lester Maddox of Georgia called King \"an enemy of our country\" and threatened to \"personally raise\" the state capitol flag back from half-staff. California Governor Ronald Reagan described the assassination as \"a great tragedy that began when we began compromising with law and order and people started choosing which laws they'd break\". Strom Thurmond, South Carolina Senator, wrote to his constituents: \"We are now witnessing the whirlwind sowed years ago when some preachers and teachers began telling people that each man could be his own judge in his own case.\"\n\nThe Federal Bureau of Investigation was assigned the lead to investigate King's death. J. Edgar Hoover, who had previously made efforts to undermine King's reputation, told Johnson his agency would attempt to find the culprit(s). Many documents related to this investigation remain classified, and are slated to remain secret until 2027. In 2010, as in earlier years, some argued for passage of a proposed Records Collection Act, similar to a 1992 law concerning the Kennedy assassination, in order to require the immediate release of the records. The measure did not pass.\n\nA crowd of 300,000 attended his funeral on April 9. Vice President Hubert Humphrey attended on behalf of Johnson, who was at a meeting on the Vietnam War at Camp David. (There were fears that Johnson might be hit with protests and abuses over the war if he attended). At his widow's request, King's last sermon at Ebenezer Baptist Church was played at the funeral; it was a recording of his \"Drum Major\" sermon, given on February 4, 1968. In that sermon, he asked that, at his funeral, no mention of his awards and honors be made, but that it be said he tried to \"feed the hungry\", \"clothe the naked\", \"be right on the [Vietnam] war question\", and \"love and serve humanity\".\n\nThe FBI investigation found fingerprints on various objects left in the bathroom from where the gunfire had come. Evidence included a Remington Gamemaster rifle from which at least one shot had been fired. The fingerprints were traced to an escaped convict named James Earl Ray. Two months after assassinating King, Ray was captured at London's Heathrow Airport while he was trying to depart from the United Kingdom for either Angola, Rhodesia, or apartheid South Africa on a false Canadian passport in the name of Ramon George Sneyd. Ray was quickly extradited to Tennessee and charged with King's murder.\n\nRay confessed to the assassination on March 10, 1969. On the advice of his attorney Percy Foreman, Ray took a guilty plea to avoid a conviction and potential death penalty. Ray was sentenced to a 99-year prison term; he recanted his confession three days later.\n\nRay fired Foreman as his attorney and claimed a man he met in Montreal with the alias \"Raul\" was involved, as was Ray's brother Johnny, but that he was not. He said through his new attorney Jack Kershaw that, although he did not \"personally shoot King\", he may have been \"partially responsible without knowing it\", hinting at a conspiracy. In May 1977, Kershaw presented evidence to the House Select Committee on Assassinations that he believed exonerated his client, but tests did not prove conclusive. Kershaw also claimed Ray was somewhere else when the shots were fired, but he could not find a witness to corroborate the claim.\n\nRay and seven other convicts escaped from Brushy Mountain State Penitentiary in Petros, Tennessee, on June 10, 1977. They were recaptured on June 13, three days later, and returned to prison. A year was added to Ray's sentence.\n\nRay worked for the remainder of his life attempting (unsuccessfully) to withdraw his guilty plea and secure a full trial. In 1997, King's son Dexter met with Ray; he publicly supported Ray's efforts to obtain a retrial.\n\nWilliam Francis Pepper remained James Earl Ray's attorney until Ray's death. He carried on the effort to gain a trial on behalf of the King family, who do not believe Ray was responsible, but that there was a conspiracy by elements of the government against King.\n\nRay died in prison on April 23, 1998, at the age of 70 from kidney and liver failure, caused by hepatitis C (probably contracted as a result of a blood transfusion given after a stabbing while at Brushy Mountain State Penitentiary).\n\nIn December 1993, Loyd Jowers, a white man from Memphis, appeared on ABC's \"Prime Time Live.\" He had gained attention by claiming an alleged conspiracy involving the Mafia, the Federal government, and himself to kill King. According to Jowers, Ray was a scapegoat, and not directly involved in the shooting. Jowers claimed he hired someone to kill King as a favor for a friend in the mafia, Frank Liberto, a produce merchant who died before 1993.\n\nAccording to the Department of Justice, Jowers had inconsistently identified different people as King's assassin since 1993. He had alternatively claimed the shooter was: (1) an African American man who was on South Main Street on the night of the assassination (the \"Man on South Main Street\"); (2) Raoul; (3) a white \"Lieutenant\" with the Memphis Police Department; and (4) a person whom he did not recognize. The Department does not consider Jowers' accusations credible, and refers to two of the accused individuals by pseudonym. DOJ has stated the evidence allegedly supporting the existence of a third assassin, \"Raoul\", is dubious. Jowers had business interests in the vicinity of the assassination site.\n\nIn 1997, King's son Dexter had a meeting with Ray and asked him, \"I just want to ask you, for the record, um, did you kill my father?\" Ray replied, \"No. No I didn't,\" and King told Ray he, along with the King family, believed him; the King family also urged that Ray be granted a new trial. In 1999, the King family filed a civil case against Jowers and unnamed co-conspirators for the wrongful death of King. The case, \"Coretta Scott King, et al. vs. Loyd Jowers et al.\", Case No. 97242, was tried in the circuit court of Shelby County, Tennessee, from November 15 to December 8, 1999.\n\nAttorney William Francis Pepper, representing the King family, presented evidence from 70 witnesses and 4,000 pages of transcripts. Pepper alleges in his book, \"An Act of State\" (2003), that the evidence implicated the FBI, the CIA, the Army, the Memphis Police Department, and organized crime in the murder of King. The suit alleged government involvement; however, no government officials or agencies were named or made a party to the suit, so there was no defense or evidence presented or refuted by the government. The jury found defendant Loyd Jowers and unknown co-defendants civilly liable for participation in a conspiracy to assassinate King in the amount of $100. Members of King's family acted as plaintiffs.\n\nAfter hearing no evidence from the government, and only testimony and pleadings cooperatively submitted by the plaintiffs and Jowers, the jury—six blacks and six whites—found King had been the victim of assassination by a conspiracy involving the Memphis police as well as federal agencies. Local Assistant District Attorney John Campbell, who was not involved in the case, said the case was flawed and \"overlooked so much contradictory evidence that never was presented.\" This civil verdict against Jowers has been claimed by some persons to have established Ray's criminal innocence, which the King family has always maintained, but it has no bearing on his having pleaded guilty. In the United States, civil and criminal trials are always adjudicated independently. The family said it had requested only $100 in damages to demonstrate they were not seeking financial gain. Dexter called the verdict \"a vindication for us\". At a press conference following the trial, members of the King family including Corretta Scott King and Dexter King told reporters they believed the Mafia and state, local, and federal Government agencies had conspired to plan the assassination and frame James Earl Ray as the shooter. When asked who they thought the true assassin was, Dexter King said that Jowers had identified Lt. Earl Clark of the Memphis Police Department as the shooter.\n\nIn 2000, the Department of Justice completed their own investigation into Jowers' claims; it did not find evidence to support the allegations about conspiracy. The investigation report recommends no further investigation unless some new reliable facts are presented. A sister of Jowers said he had fabricated the story so he could make $300,000 from selling it, and that she corroborated it to get some money to pay her income tax. King biographer David Garrow disagrees with William F. Pepper's claims that the government killed King. He is supported by author Gerald Posner. Posner wrote \"Killing the Dream: James Earl Ray and the Assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr.\" (1998), concluding that Ray killed King, acting alone, likely for the hope of collecting a racist bounty for the murder.\n\nOn the other hand, conspiracy theorists bristled at \"Killing the Dream\", criticizing Posner for in part basing it on \"a psychological evaluation of James Earl Ray, which he [Posner] is not qualified to give, and he dismisses evidence of conspiracy in King's murder as cynical attempts to exploit the tragedy\". William Pepper, Ray's final defense attorney, repeatedly dismissed Posner's book as inaccurate and misleading. Dexter King, one of Martin Luther King's sons, also criticized it. In response to the 1999 verdict in \"King vs. Jowers\", Posner told \"The New York Times\", \"It distresses me greatly that the legal system was used in such a callous and farcical manner in Memphis. If the King family wanted a rubber stamp of their own view of the facts, they got it.\"\n\nIn 1998, CBS reported the two separate ballistic tests conducted on the Remington Gamemaster allegedly used by Ray in the assassination were inconclusive. Moreover, witnesses with King at the moment of the shooting say the shot was fired from a different location; from behind thick shrubbery near the rooming house, and not from a window of the rooming house.\n\nKing's friend and SCLC organizer, Reverend James Lawson, has suggested the impending occupation of Washington, DC, by the Poor People's Campaign was a primary motive for the assassination. Lawson also noted during the civil trial that King alienated President Johnson and other powerful government actors when he repudiated the Vietnam War on April 4, 1967—exactly one year before the assassination.\n\nKing had been targeted by COINTELPRO and had also been under surveillance by military intelligence agencies during the period leading up to his assassination under the code name Operation Lantern Spike.\n\nA church minister, Ronald Denton Wilson, claimed his father, Henry Clay Wilson, assassinated Martin Luther King Jr., not James Earl Ray. He stated, \"It wasn't a racist thing; he thought Martin Luther King was connected with communism, and he wanted to get him out of the way.\" But Wilson had reportedly previously admitted his father was a member of the Ku Klux Klan.\n\nIn 2004, Jesse Jackson, who was with King when he was assassinated, noted:\n\nAccording to biographer Taylor Branch, King's friend and colleague James Bevel put it more bluntly: \"There is no way a ten-cent white boy could develop a plan to kill a million-dollar black man.\"\n\n\n\n"}

The nervous system consists of central and peripheral nervous systems and coordinates the actions of an animal by transmitting signals to and from different parts of its body. The brain and spinal cord are interwoven with the body and interact with other organ systems through the somatic, autonomic and enteric nervous systems. Neural pathways regulate brain-body interactions and allow to sense and control its body and interact with the environment.\n\nVarious types of brain-body interactions have been distinguished. For example, brain-gut interactions are biochemical signaling that takes place between the gastrointestinal tract and the central nervous system. Brain-heart interactions link cardiac physiology to activity in the central and peripheral nervous system and may explain how peripheral cardiovascular arousal can influence decision making and the regulation of social and emotional behaviours. Brain-muscle interactions involve both efferent nerve fibres that transmit action potentials to the muscles to generate muscle contractions and afferent nerve fibres that transmit somatosensory information back to the central nervous system.\n\nInteractions between brain regions have been studied using functional connectivity analysis. Resting state fMRI has shown that brain activity in different brain areas are coupled and form brain networks that can be studied using graph theory. Brain-body interactions can be studied using a similar approach by estimating functional connectivity between brain activity and peripheral electrophysiology, for example between brain activity and ECG, EGG or EMG activity. Synchrony between slow pulse fluctuations (related to sympathetic activity) and brain fMRI signal has revealed a network of sensory brain regions that appear to be relevant for characterizing human personality and emotions. These analyses can be extended to investigate interactions between multiple organ systems that together form a brain-body network.\n"}

She was part of the Fifth Company of missionaries sent to Hawaii by the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions (ABCFM).\n\nClarissa Chapman was born and raised on a farm in Russell, Massachusetts. Her father was \"crippled by rheumatism\" and she remembered assisting him in farm work. She trained as a teacher. Her brother was Reuben Atwater Chapman, a judge in Massachusetts.\n\nClarissa Chapman Armstrong sailed for Hawaii on a whaling ship in 1831, with her new husband, a Presbyterian minister. They were part of the Fifth Company of missionaries sent to Hawaii by the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions (ABCFM). She was pregnant for the entire six-month journey. Her first child, Caroline, was born two months after the couple arrived, in Honolulu. The couple with Benjamin and Mary Barker Parker were assigned as missionaries to Nuku Hiva in the Marquesas Islands from 1833 to 1834. Their first son was born there. The failure of the Marquesan mission prompted them to return to Hawaii. They lived at Wailuku on Maui from 1835 to 1840, and then moved to Honolulu. Clarissa Chapman Armstrong taught literacy and Bible study classes for women. She did not always enjoy living among the native residents of Hawaii, writing that \"Week after week passes and we see nothing but naked, filthy, wicked heathen with souls as dark as the tabernacles which they inhabit.\"\n\nArmstrong also made watercolor sketches of native Marquesan and Hawaiian people and places. Eric Kjellgren and Carol S. Ivory states: \"During her time in the Marquesas, Clarissa Armstrong painted four small watercolor portraits. They show details of tattoo and personal adornment, and though somewhat naive in their rendering of the human body nevertheless capture the dignity, humanity, and individuality of their subjects.\" Subjects of her watercolor made in Hawaii included blind preacher Bartimea Puaʻaiki, Governor Hoapili of Maui and Queen Kalākua Kaheiheimālie.\n\nRichard Armstrong left mission work in 1847 to take secular employment as the Minister of Public Instruction under King Kamehameha III. Clarissa Armstrong no longer taught classes, but continued to hold Bible study meetings, now with other wives of Hawaiian chiefs and government officials, including Queen Kalama. The Armstrongs lived in \"the Stone House\", a property of the Kingdom of Hawaii, which Clarissa kept as her residence after Richard's death in 1860. She sold the Honolulu house in 1881, and moved to San Francisco, California, to join her daughter's work at a Christian mission in that city's Chinatown.\n\nClarissa Chapman married Richard Armstrong on September 5, 1831, in Bridgeport, Connecticut. They had ten children. Their oldest son, William Nevins Armstrong (1835–1905) was Attorney General of the Kingdom of Hawaii from 1880 to 1882. Their youngest son, Samuel Chapman Armstrong (1839–1893) was a Union Army general during the American Civil War and afterwards the founder of the Hampton Institute. She became a widow when Richard died in a riding accident in 1860. She died on July 20, 1891, aged 86 years, from injuries sustained in a fall, in San Francisco. Her gravesite is in Oakland, California. Her papers are archived with Samuel Chapman Armstrong's, at Williams College.\n\n"}

E. van Vogt (1912–2000) and featured in his first published short story \"Black Destroyer\" (1939), later incorporated in the novel \"The Voyage of the Space Beagle\" (1950). The species' appearance is comparable to a large cat, except in that its forelegs are twice as long as its hind legs, and it possesses tentacles attached to its shoulders that terminate in suction cups. Its skin coloration is not mentioned (except as implied by the title), but was depicted as black in the cover art for its original magazine appearance. It sustains itself by feeding upon a substance it calls the \"Id\" of other beings.\n\nThe species appears indifferent to environment and can survive in different atmospheres. It can manipulate EM radiation (referred to as \"electric vibrations\" in the story) at will and seems to communicate via that method.\n\nIn \"Black Destroyer\", a sentient creature that calls itself Coeurl lives on an alien planet. When a human starship arrives, they find a Coeurl but assume it is an unintelligent animal, and even allow it to come on board. The Coeurl realizes it can feed on humans but plays along in order to learn more about them and their ship. Eventually, however, it kills and feeds on one of the ship's crew. The crew suspects the Coeurl did it and tries to prove it by feeding the creature organically bound phosphorus similar to that in the victim's bones, but the Coeurl is smart enough to pass the test. It is later found out and tries to escape, but it is no match for the humans' technology, and in the end commits suicide.\n\nWhen \"Black Destroyer\" was incorporated into \"The Voyage of the Space Beagle\", several changes were made in Coeurl's anatomy and physiology—for example, Coeurl's tentacles originally ended in tentacled fingers, but were changed in the novel to suction cups, and the dietary chemical was changed from phosphorus to potassium. In the novel, it is theorized that the members of Coeurl's race were pets or servants of the original inhabitants of the planet.\n\n\n"}

Vallero is an American environmental author and scientist. He was born in East St. Louis, Illinois and grew up in Collinsville, Illinois. He received a bachelor's degree and a master's degree in city and regional planning from Southern Illinois University-Edwardsville. He also earned a masters in civil and environmental engineering (environmental health sciences) from the University of Kansas and a PhD in civil and environmental engineering from Duke University with a thesis on \"“Dicarboximide Fungicide Flux to the Lower Troposphere from an Aquic Hapludult Soil”\n\nVallero is recognized internationally for advancing the state of environmental science and engineering, as an author, educator, engineer and scientific researcher. He has appeared on news and other shows, recently discussing plastic recycling on NBC's Today Show (http://www.today.com/video/today/51620316) and on MSNBC, and current state of ethics in research at universities. He began his professional career in the Kansas City regional office of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency in 1976 and has worked in numerous other scientific venues since then. He directed the Science, Technology and Human Values Program at Duke University from 1997 to 2005. Beginning in 2005, he has been adjunct Professor of Engineering Ethics at Duke University, with a joint appointment in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, and the Trinity School of Arts and Sciences. He held appointments also at the University of Missouri-Kansas City, North Carolina Central University, and as science staff member on Energy and Power Subcommittee of the United States House of Representatives.\nIn his books and other writings, Vallero has taken the systems view of living systems, As such he has bridged biomedical engineering with environmental engineering. He stresses the need to incorporate the social sciences into every engineering and design project. As a leader in engineering ethics, he has served the National Academy of Engineering as a member of the Online Ethics Committee and the Executive Board of the National Institute of Engineering Ethics. Vallero has also advised Sigma Xi, universities and other institutions on science and research ethics and the responsible conduct of research (RCR).\n\nVallero is editor for the Institution of Chemical Engineers' journal, \"Process Safety and Environmental Protection\", as well as the MDPI journal, \"Sustainability\". He is also the environmental engineering subject editor of the McGraw-Hill Encyclopedia of Science & Technology and the \"McGraw-Hill Yearbook of Science & Technology\".\n\nVallero is a pioneer of green engineering and the application of life cycle analysis to engineering design. He was among the first to question the sustainability and ethics of using corn as a source of ethanol fuel. His reasoning was that current farming practice's dependence on fossil fuels needed to grow (including fertilizer and pesticides), harvest and ferment the corn is highly inefficient thermodynamically. The use of corn for fuel is especially problematic, since only the seed are used, not to mention the misuse of an important part of the global food supply. Vallero argued that other crops are much more sustainable, especially those that make use of the whole plant, including cellulosic material, like switchgrass (Panicum virgatum).\n\nIn the book, \"DUST: The inside Story of its Role in the September 11th Aftermath,\" the late American scientist Paul Lioy credited Vallero with leading the way to sampling of hazardous air pollutants in and around Ground Zero following the 9/11 attacks on the World Trade Center. Lioy collaborated with Vallero in establishing a protocol for characterizing exposure in risk assessments following such emergencies. Lioy and Vallero coined the term “5 R’s” to delineate how exposure assessment varies during the five stages following a disaster: 1. Rescue; 2. Recovery; 3. Reentry; 4. Restoration; and 5. Rehabitation.\n\nWith architect, Chris Brasier, Vallero coined the term \"synthovation,\" as a new design process for green engineering and green architecture. A combination of synthesis and innovation, sustainable design does not consider innovation to be an interruption (feedback loop) to the design process as in traditional \"concept to completion\" design. Rather, innovations are to be expected and integrated. Differing from the traditional step-wise process, synthovation is a spiral, dynamic, and continuously moving process toward completion of the design and throughout the life of the project, including end-of life recycling and design for disassembly, a component of design for environment (DfE), with innovations added along the way that will increase the sustainability of the project over its entire life cycle.\n\nIn her book, \"Hormone Deception\", Lindsey Berkson credits Vallero as among the first to apply exposure science to endocrine disruptors.\n\n\n"}

She was married in 1713 to Richard Aldworth, Esq., in Newmarket. During the duration of the Hon. Elizabeth Aldworth—‘Whenever a benefit was given at the theaters in Dublin or Cork for the Masonic Female Orphan Asylum, she walked at the head of the Freemasons with her apron and other insignia of Freemasonary, and sat in the front row of the stage box. The house was always crowded on these occasions. Her portrait is in the lodge-room of almost every lodge of Ireland.’ \n\nThe date of her initiation into Freemasonry is uncertain, but the \"Memoir of a Lady Freemason\" indicates that it was between 1710–1712, before her marriage. In his paper in \"Ars Quatuor Coronatorum\" in 1895, Edward Conder states that it was sometime between 1710–1718. In a reply to the paper, Masonic scholar William James Hughan stated: \"Until Bro. Conder’s investigations we had all assumed that the various reports respecting the initiation of the Hon. Elizabeth St. Leger, though not always in agreement, were correct as to the occurrence being of a later date than 1730.\" Hughan also found the facts related to contradict the statements made by an Aldworth descendant.\n\nThose facts are found in the \"Memoir\", extracted from the records of the First Lodge of Ireland, which state that Arundel Hill was present at the initiation and often sat in Lodge with her. The \"Memoir\"'s editor also indicates that Conder's work was the first fixing of the date, which as of 1864 was not known.\n\nConder also states that the particular Lodge in which she was initiated, while commonly thought at the time of his research to be known, is also unknown, but that it may have been a private Lodge warranted out of London by her father. Conder also seems to be refuting an unelaborated-upon statement that Aldworth was initiated after the formation of the Grand Lodge of Ireland. He indicates that since the Viscount died in 1727, she could not have been initiated after that point, and at that time it seems that the commonly accepted date of formation of the Grand Lodge was 1729–30. It is now taken to be 1725.\n\nThe tradition of Aldworth's initiation is that Aldworth had fallen asleep while reading on a dim winter evening in the library, which was located next to the room in which the Lodge was meeting. In consequence of construction going on in the library, she was woken by the voices she heard next door, and the light shining through the loose brickwork. She removed some of the bricks and watched the proceedings. When she understood the solemnity of the proceedings, she wished to retreat, but was caught by the Lodge Tyler, who was also the family butler. Realizing her predicament, she screamed and fainted. The tyler summoned the Brethren (among them her father), and they ultimately decided to initiate her into the Lodge.\n\nIn the reply to Conder's presentation, a Bro. Rylands indicated that \"there was no evidence forthcoming\" that Aldworth served as Master of a Lodge, or that she regularly attended.\nElizabeth Aldworth died in 1775. There was a plaque erected at the new St. Finbarre's Cathedral by the Masons of Cork, which reads:\nIn Pious Memory of<br>\nThe Honourable<br>\nELIZABETH ALDWORTH,<br>\nWife of<br>\nRICHARD ALDWORTH,<br>\nOf Newmarket Court, Co.

The differences can apply to how behavior is governed with respect to government laws, business rules, or social etiquette. This classification has been applied especially to apollonian societies, sorting them according to the emotions they use to control individuals (especially children) and maintaining social order, swaying them into norm obedience and conformity. \n\n\nThe terminology were popularized by Ruth Benedict in \"The Chrysanthemum and the Sword\", who described American culture as a \"guilt culture\" and Japanese culture as a \"shame culture\".\n\nThough the same person may emphasize different considerations depending on the situation, government and business projects that bring together people from different types of cultures may experience problems.\n\nIn a guilt society, the primary method of social control is the inculcation of feelings of guilt for behaviors that the individual believes to be undesirable. A prominent feature of guilt societies is the provision of sanctioned releases from guilt for certain behaviors, whether before or after the fact. There is opportunity in such cases for authority figures to derive power, monetary and/or other advantages, etc. by manipulating the conditions of guilt and the forgiveness of guilt.\n\nPaul Hiebert characterizes the guilt society as follows:\n\n\nAnglo-Saxon England is particularly notable as a shame culture, and this trait survived even after its conversion to Christianity, which is typically a guilt culture. Other examples of shame culture under Christianity are the cultures of Mexico, Andalusia and generally Christian Mediterranean societies.\n\nIn China, the concept of shame is widely accepted due to Confucian teachings. In \"Analects\", Confucius is quoted as saying:\n\nLead the people with administrative injunctions and put them in their place with penal law, and they will avoid punishments but will be without a sense of shame. Lead them with excellence and put them in their place through roles and ritual practices, and in addition to developing a sense of shame, they will order themselves harmoniously.\n\nThe society of traditional Japan was long held to be a good example of one in which shame is the primary agent of social control. The first book to cogently explain the workings of the Japanese society for the Western reader was \"The Chrysanthemum and the Sword\" by Ruth Benedict. This book was produced under less than ideal circumstances since it was written during the early years of World War II in an attempt to understand the people who had become such a powerful enemy of the West. Under the conditions of war, it was impossible to do field research in Japan.\n\nWithout being able to study in Japan, Benedict relied on newspaper clippings, histories, literature, films, and interviews of Japanese-Americans. Her studies came to conclusions about Japanese culture and society that are still widely criticized today, both in America and Japan.\n\nTo the Roma, though living as local minorities in mostly Christian or Islamic societies, the concept of \"lajav\" (\"shame\") is important, while the concept of \"bezax\" (\"sin\") does not have such significance.\n\n\n\n\n"}

The herd is in its fifth generation and is currently being run by Edward Lewis.\n\nThomas Lewis founded his Hereford herd at \"The Woodhouse\", Shobdon, Herefordshire in 1822, 24 years before the publication of the first Hereford Cattle Herd Book. Many animals were exported from \"The Woodhouse\" Herd especially to the United States of America in the boom years of the 1880s, although Hereford cattle had first been introduced to the country in either 1816 or 1817. Amongst the 1880s sales was Woodhouse Dowager 6th whom Messrs. Gudgell & Simpson bought, along with Anxiety 4th, in 1881 and became the cornerstone of the Hereford breed's presence in the US. The policy of Gudgell and Simpson was to line breed their early imports, and their most notable achievement was the breeding of Prince Domino in 1914: he was probably the greatest bull in the early development of the North American Herefords. There were at least eight crosses of Woodhouse Dowager 6th in the pedigree of this bull.\n\nJames Lewis moved from \"The Woodhouse\" when he married Margaret Bray, whose grandfather was a nephew of Benjamin Tomkins, the original breeder of the Hereford. The couple set up home at The Haven in 1888 and continued to breed Herefords. One of the cows that they brought from \"The Woodhouse\" was Teresa 2nd, who founded the Tiny and Thrush families that are still prominent in the herd today. Among his most successful bulls during this period was Leyburn, a notable breeder of the day who produced a son, Haven Turgot, who was Champion at Hereford Show and Sale in 1917. Turgot was the first bull to be brought out by a Lady in Hereford Market, this being James Lewis' daughter as his son Edward was away at World War I.\n\nEdward Lewis took over The Haven from his father, James, when he married Beatrice Francis in 1928. This being the period of the Great Depression, the first ten years of his breeding was concentrated on survival and maintenance of the best attributes of the Hereford strain. He managed this by acquiring Free Town Bodyguard in 1946, a son of Bodyguard. Haven Victory was sold to Senor Duggan from Argentina in the February Show and Sale and Haven Broadside, another son of Bodyguard, was the first bull to make 1000 guineas at the Hereford April Sale when sold to the Duke of Newcastle. In 1948, Haven Idol, son of Tarington Magnate, was purchased by The Woodlands stud in Australia, where he proved to be an outstanding sire. The Queen viewed the cattle at Hereford Market in this year.\n\nE. L. Lewis & Son was formed in 1949 when Edward's son, Leslie, and daughter, Sybil, joined their father. Their first purchase was Shucknall Favourite, who proved to be one of the top breed sires for over a decade. Many of his progeny were exported throughout the world and were almost unbeatable in the show ring. The Haven acquired the female lines namely the Pinky, Prunella and Julia families formerly of the Vern herd and the Lady Lynda's of the Tarrington herd. Still in the herd today.\n\nThe \"Glasgow Herald\" reported that representative animals from the herd \"swept the boards\" at the Royal Highland Show of 1964 and \"stole the show\" at the 1965 event. In 1976 the same newspaper noted that the herd was \"internationally famous\", with sales having been made to Canada, China, Egypt, Israel, Russia, South Africa and South America. It was also noted that Edward and Leslie Lewis had produced \"many champion Herefords\". At that time it was stated that on-the-farm auctions were planned to be an annual event.\n\n\n"}

Intelligent agents may also learn or use knowledge to achieve their goals. They may be very simple or very complex. A reflex machine, such as a thermostat, is considered an example of an intelligent agent.\nIntelligent agents are often described schematically as an abstract functional system similar to a computer program. For this reason, intelligent agents are sometimes called abstract intelligent agents (AIA) to distinguish them from their real world implementations as computer systems, biological systems, or organizations. Some definitions of intelligent agents emphasize their , and so prefer the term autonomous intelligent agents. Still others (notably ) considered goal-directed behavior as the essence of intelligence and so prefer a term borrowed from economics, \"rational agent\".\n\nIntelligent agents in artificial intelligence are closely related to agents in economics, and versions of the intelligent agent paradigm are studied in cognitive science, ethics, the philosophy of practical reason, as well as in many interdisciplinary socio-cognitive modeling and computer social simulations.\n\nIntelligent agents are also closely related to software agents (an autonomous computer program that carries out tasks on behalf of users). In computer science, the term \"intelligent agent\" may be used to refer to a software agent that has some intelligence, regardless if it is not a rational agent by Russell and Norvig's definition. For example, autonomous programs used for operator assistance or data mining (sometimes referred to as \"bots\") are also called \"intelligent agents\".\n\nIntelligent agents have been defined many different ways. According to Nikola Kasabov AI systems should exhibit the following characteristics:\n\nA simple agent program can be defined mathematically as an agent function which maps every possible percepts sequence to a possible action the agent can perform or to a coefficient, feedback element, function or constant that affects eventual actions:\nAgent function is an abstract concept as it could incorporate various principles of decision making like calculation of utility of individual options, deduction over logic rules, fuzzy logic, etc.\n\nThe program agent, instead, maps every possible percept to an action.\n\nWe use the term percept to refer to the agent's perceptional inputs at any given instant. In the following figures an agent is anything that can be viewed as perceiving its environment through sensors and acting upon that environment through actuators.\n\n defines four classes of agents:\n\nGenerally, an agent can be constructed by separating the body into the sensors and actuators and that operates with a complex perception system that takes the description of the world as input for a controller and outputs commands to the actuator. However, a hierarchy of controller layers if often necessary to balance the immediate reaction desired for low-level tasks and the slow reasoning about complex, high-level goals.\n\n group agents into five classes based on their degree of perceived intelligence and capability:\n\nSimple reflex agents act only on the basis of the current percept, ignoring the rest of the percept history. The agent function is based on the \"condition-action rule\": if condition then action.\n\nThis agent function only succeeds when the environment is fully observable. Some reflex agents can also contain information on their current state which allows them to disregard conditions whose actuators are already triggered.\n\nInfinite loops are often unavoidable for simple reflex agents operating in partially observable environments. Note: If the agent can randomize its actions, it may be possible to escape from infinite loops.\n\nA model-based agent can handle partially observable environments. Its current state is stored inside the agent maintaining some kind of structure which describes the part of the world which cannot be seen. This knowledge about \"how the world works\" is called a model of the world, hence the name \"model-based agent\".\n\nA model-based reflex agent should maintain some sort of internal model that depends on the percept history and thereby reflects at least some of the unobserved aspects of the current state. Percept history and impact of action on the environment can be determined by using internal model. It then chooses an action in the same way as reflex agent.\n\nAn agent may also use models to describe and predict the behaviors of other agents in the environment.\n\nGoal-based agents further expand on the capabilities of the model-based agents, by using \"goal\" information. Goal information describes situations that are desirable. This allows the agent a way to choose among multiple possibilities, selecting the one which reaches a goal state. Search and planning are the subfields of artificial intelligence devoted to finding action sequences that achieve the agent's goals.\n\nGoal-based agents only distinguish between goal states and non-goal states. It is possible to define a measure of how desirable a particular state is. This measure can be obtained through the use of a \"utility function\" which maps a state to a measure of the utility of the state. A more general performance measure should allow a comparison of different world states according to exactly how happy they would make the agent. The term utility can be used to describe how \"happy\" the agent is.\n\nA rational utility-based agent chooses the action that maximizes the expected utility of the action outcomes - that is, what the agent expects to derive, on average, given the probabilities and utilities of each outcome. A utility-based agent has to model and keep track of its environment, tasks that have involved a great deal of research on perception, representation, reasoning, and learning.\n\nLearning has the advantage that it allows the agents to initially operate in unknown environments and to become more competent than its initial knowledge alone might allow. The most important distinction is between the \"learning element\", which is responsible for making improvements, and the \"performance element\", which is responsible for selecting external actions.\n\nThe learning element uses feedback from the \"critic\" on how the agent is doing and determines how the performance element should be modified to do better in the future.\nThe performance element is what we have previously considered to be the entire agent: it takes in percepts and decides on actions.\n\nThe last component of the learning agent is the \"problem generator\". It is responsible for suggesting actions that will lead to new and informative experiences.\n\nTo actively perform their functions, Intelligent Agents today are normally gathered in a hierarchical structure containing many “sub-agents”. Intelligent sub-agents process and perform lower level functions. Taken together, the intelligent agent and sub-agents create a complete system that can accomplish difficult tasks or goals with behaviors and responses that display a form of intelligence.\n\nIntelligent agents are applied as automated online assistants, where they function to perceive the needs of customers in order to perform individualized customer service. Such an agent may basically consist of a dialog system, an avatar, as well an expert system to provide specific expertise to the user. They can also be used to optimize coordination of human groups online.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "31028310", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31028310", "title": "Interplanetary contamination", "text": "Interplanetary contamination\n\nInterplanetary contamination refers to biological contamination of a planetary body by a space probe or spacecraft, either deliberate or unintentional.\n\nThere are two types of interplanetary contamination:\n\nThe main focus is on microbial life and on potentially invasive species. Non-biological forms of contamination have also been considered, including contamination of sensitive deposits (such as lunar polar ice deposits) of scientific interest. In the case of back contamination, multicellular life is thought unlikely but has not been ruled out. In the case of forward contamination, contamination by multicellular life (e.g. lichens) is unlikely to occur for robotic missions, but it becomes a consideration in crewed missions to Mars.\n\nCurrent space missions are governed by the Outer Space Treaty and the COSPAR guidelines for planetary protection. Forward contamination is prevented primarily by sterilizing the spacecraft. In the case of sample-return missions (back contamination) the aim of the mission is to return extraterrestrial samples to Earth, and sterilization of the samples would make them of much less interest. So, back contamination would be prevented mainly by containment, and breaking the chain of contact between the planet of origin and Earth. It would also require quarantine procedures for the materials and for anyone who comes into contact with them.\n\nMost of the Solar System appears hostile to life as we know it. No extraterrestrial life has ever been discovered, but there are several locations outside Earth where microbial life could possibly exist, have existed, or thrive if introduced. If extraterrestrial life exists, it may be vulnerable to interplanetary contamination by foreign microorganisms. Some extremophiles may be able to survive space travel to another planet, and foreign life could possibly be introduced by spacecraft from Earth and transform the location from its current pristine state. This poses scientific and ethical concerns.\n\nLocations within the Solar System where life might exist today include the oceans of liquid water beneath the icy surface of Europa, and Enceladus, and Titan (its surface has oceans of liquid ethane / methane, but it may also have liquid water below the surface and ice volcanoes).\n\nThere are multiple consequences for both forward- and back-contamination. If a planet becomes contaminated with Earth life, it might then be difficult to tell whether any lifeforms discovered originated there or came from Earth. Furthermore, the organic chemicals produced by the introduced life would confuse sensitive searches for biosignatures of living or ancient native life. The same applies to other more complex biosignatures. Life on other planets could have a common origin with Earth life, since in the early Solar System there was much exchange of material between the planets which could have transferred life as well. If so, it might be based on nucleic acids too (RNA or DNA). \n\nThis is true of species detected in spacecraft cleanrooms. The majority of the species isolated are not well understood or characterized and cannot be cultured in labs, and are known only from DNA fragments obtained with swabs. On a contaminated planet, it might be difficult to distinguish the DNA of extraterrestrial life from the DNA of life brought to the planet by the exploring. Most species of microorganism on Earth are not yet well understood or DNA sequenced. This particularly applies to the unculturable archaea, and so are difficult to study. This can be either because they depend on the presence of other microorganisms, or are slow growing, or depend on other conditions not yet understood. In typical habitats, 99% of microorganisms are not culturable. Introduced Earth life could contaminate resources of value for future human missions, such as water.\n\nInvasive species could outcompete native life or consume it, if there is life on the planet. One argument against this is that the native life would be more adapted to the conditions there. However, the experience on Earth shows that species moved from one continent to another may be able to outcompete the native life adapted to that continent. Additionally, evolutionary processes on Earth might have developed biological pathways different from extraterrestrial organisms, and so may be able to out-compete it. The same is also possible the other way around for back contamination introduced to Earth's biosphere.\n\nIn addition of science concerns, ethical or moral issues have also been raised on accidental and intentional interplanetary transport of life.\n\nEnceladus and Europa show the best evidence for current habitats, mainly due to the possibility of their hosting liquid water and organic compounds.\n\nThere is ample evidence to suggest that Mars once offered habitable conditions for microbial life. It is therefore possible that microbial life may have existed on Mars, although no evidence has been found.\n\nIt is thought that many bacterial spores (endospores) from Earth were transported on Mars spacecraft. Some may be protected within Martian rovers and landers on the shallow surface of the planet. In that sense, Mars may have already been interplanetarily contaminated. \n\nCertain lichens from the arctic permafrost are able to photosynthesize and grow in the absence of any liquid water, simply by using the humidity from the atmosphere. They are also highly tolerant of UV radiation, using melanin and other more specialized chemicals to protect their cells.\nAlthough numerous studies point to resistance to some of Mars conditions, they do so separately, and none has considered the full range of Martian surface conditions, including temperature, pressure, atmospheric composition, radiation, humidity, oxidizing regolith, and others, all at the same time and in combination. Laboratory simulations show that whenever multiple lethal factors are combined, the survival rates plummet quickly.\n\nOther studies have suggested the potential for life to survive using deliquescing salts. These, similarly to the lichens, use the humidity of the atmosphere. If the mixture of salts is right, the organisms may obtain liquid water at times of high atmospheric humidity, with salts capture enough to be capable of supporting life.\n\nResearch published in July 2017 shows that when irradiated with a simulated Martian UV flux, perchlorates become even more lethal to bacteria (bactericide effect). Even dormant spores lost viability within minutes. In addition, two other compounds of the Martian surface, iron oxides and hydrogen peroxide, act in synergy with irradiated perchlorates to cause a 10.8-fold increase in cell death when compared to cells exposed to UV radiation after 60 seconds of exposure. It was also found that abraded silicates (quartz and basalt) lead to the formation of toxic reactive oxygen species. The researchers concluded that \"the surface of Mars is lethal to vegetative cells and renders much of the surface and near-surface regions uninhabitable.\" This research demonstrates that the present-day surface is more uninhabitable than previously thought, and reinforces the notion to inspect at least a few meters into the ground to ensure the levels of radiation would be relatively low.\n\nThe \"Cassini\" spacecraft directly sampled the plumes escaping from Enceladus. Measured data indicates that these geysers are made primarily of salt rich particles with an 'ocean-like' composition, which is thought to originate from a subsurface ocean of liquid saltwater, rather than from the moon's icy surface. Data from the geyser flythroughs also indicate the presence of organic chemicals in the plumes. Heat scans of Enceladus' surface also indicate warmer temperatures around the fissures where the geysers originate from, with temperatures reaching -93 °C (-135 °F), which is 115 °C (207 °F) warmer than the surrounding surface regions.\n\nEuropa has much indirect evidence for its sub-surface ocean. Models of how Europa is affected by tidal heating require a subsurface layer of liquid water in order to accurately reproduce the linear fracturing of the surface. Indeed, observations by the \"Galileo\" spacecraft of how Europa's magnetic field interacts with Jupiter's field strengthens the case for a liquid, rather than solid, layer; an electrically conductive fluid deep within Europa would explain these results. Observations from the Hubble Space Telescope in December 2012 appear to show an ice plume spouting from Europa's surface, which would immensely strengthen the case for a liquid subsurface ocean. As was the case for Enceladus, vapour geysers would allow for easy sampling of the liquid layer. Unfortunately, there appears to be little evidence that geysering is a frequent event on Europa due to the lack of water in the space near Europa.\n\nForward contamination is prevented by sterilizing space probes sent to sensitive areas of the Solar System. Missions are classified depending on whether their destinations are of interest for the search for life, and whether there is any chance that Earth life could reproduce there.\n\nNASA made these policies official with the issuing of Management Manual NMI-4-4-1, \"NASA Unmanned Spacecraft Decontamination Policy\" on September 9, 1963. Prior to NMI-4-4-1 the same sterilization requirements were required on all outgoing spacecraft regardless of their target. Difficulties in the sterilization of Ranger probes sent to the Moon are the primary reasons for NASA's change to a target-by-target basis in assessing the likelihood forward contamination.\nSome destinations such as Mercury need no precautions at all. Others such as the Moon require documentation but nothing more, while destinations such as Mars require sterilization of the rovers sent there. For the details, see Planetary protection.\n\nBack contamination would be prevented by containment or quarantine. However, there have been no sample-returns thought to have any possibility of a back contamination risk since the Apollo missions. The Apollo regulations have been rescinded and new regulations have yet to be developed, see Precautions suggested for sample-return\n\nCrewed spacecraft are of particular concern for interplanetary contamination because of the impossibility to sterilize a human to the same level as a robotic spacecraft. Therefore, the chance of forward contamination is higher than for a robotic mission. Humans are typically host to a hundred trillion microorganisms in ten thousand species in the human microbiome which cannot be removed while preserving the life of the human. Containment seems the only option, but effective containment to the same standard as a robotic rover appears difficult to achieve with present-day technology. In particular, adequate containment in the event of a hard landing is a major challenge.\n\nHuman explorers may be potential carriers back to Earth of microorganisms acquired on Mars, if such microorganisms exist. Another issue is the contamination of the water supply by Earth microorganisms shed by humans in their stools, skin and breath, which could have a direct effect on the long-term human colonization of Mars.\n\nThe Moon has been suggested as a testbed for new technology to protect sites in the Solar System, and astronauts, from forward and back contamination. Currently, the Moon has no contamination restrictions because it is considered to be \"not of interest\" for prebiotic chemistry and origins of life. Analysis of the contamination left by the Apollo program astronauts could also yield useful ground truth for planetary protection models.\n\nOne of the most reliable ways to reduce the risk of forward and back contamination during visits to extraterrestrial bodies is to use only Robotic spacecraft. Humans in close orbit around the target planet could control equipment on the surface in real time via telepresence, so bringing many of the benefits of a surface mission, without its associated increased forward and back contamination risks.\n\nSince the Moon is now generally considered to be free from life, the most likely source of contamination would be from Mars during either a Mars sample-return mission or as a result of a crewed mission to Mars. The possibility of new human pathogens, or environmental disruption due to back contamination, is considered to be of extremely low probability but cannot yet be ruled out.\n\nThere are no immediate plans for a Mars sample-return, but it remains a high priority for NASA and the ESA because of its great potential biological and geological interest. The European Space Foundation report cites many advantages of a Mars sample-return. In particular, it would permit extensive analyses on Earth, without the size and weight constraints for instruments sent to Mars on rovers. These analyses could also be carried out without the communication delays for experiments carried out by Martian rovers. It would also make it possible to repeat experiments in multiple laboratories with different instruments to confirm key results.\n\nCarl Sagan was first to publicise back contamination issues that might follow from a Mars sample-return. In \"Cosmic Connection\" (1973) he wrote:\n\nLater in \"Cosmos\" (1980) Carl Sagan wrote:\nNASA and ESA views are similar. The findings were that with present-day technology, Martian samples can be safely returned to Earth provided the right precautions are taken.\n\nNASA has already had experience with returning samples thought to represent a low back contamination risk when samples were returned for the first time by Apollo 11. At the time, it was thought that there was a low probability of life on the Moon, so the requirements were not very stringent. The precautions taken then were inadequate by current standards, however. The regulations used then have been rescinded, and new regulations and approaches for a sample-return would be needed. \n\nA sample-return mission would be designed to break the chain of contact between Mars and the exterior of the sample container, for instance, by sealing the returned container inside another larger container in the vacuum of space before it returns to Earth. In order to eliminate the risk of parachute failure, the capsule could fall at terminal velocity and the impact would be cushioned by the capsule's thermal protection system. The sample container would be designed to withstand the force of the impact.\n\nTo receive, analyze and curate extraterrestrial soil samples, NASA has proposed to build a biohazard containment facility, tentatively known as the Mars Sample Return Receiving Facility (MSRRF). This future facility must be rated biohazard level 4 (BSL-4). While existing BSL-4 facilities deal primarily with fairly well-known organisms, a BSL-4 facility focused on extraterrestrial samples must pre-plan the systems carefully while being mindful that there will be unforeseen issues during sample evaluation and curation that will require independent thinking and solutions.\n\nThe facility's systems must be able to contain unknown biohazards, as the sizes of any putative Martian microorganisms are unknown. In consideration of this, additional requirements were proposed. Ideally it should filter particles of 0.01 µm or larger, and release of a particle 0.05 µm or larger is unacceptable under any circumstance. \n\nThe reason for this extremely small size limit of 0.01 µm is for consideration of gene transfer agents (GTAs) which are virus-like particles that are produced by some microorganisms that package random segments of DNA capable of horizontal gene transfer. These randomly incorporate segments of the host genome and can transfer them to other evolutionarily distant hosts, and do that without killing the new host. In this way many archaea and bacteria can swap DNA with each other. This raises the possibility that Martian life, if it has a common origin with Earth life in the distant past, could swap DNA with Earth microorganisms in the same way. In one experiment reported in 2010, researchers left GTAs (DNA conferring antibiotic resistance) and marine bacteria overnight in natural conditions and found that by the next day up to 47% of the bacteria had incorporated the genetic material from the GTAs. Another reason for the 0.05 µm limit is because of the discovery of ultramicrobacteria as small as 0.2 µm across.\n\nThe BSL-4 containment facility must also double as a cleanroom to preserve the science value of the samples. A challenge is that, while it is relatively easy to simply contain the samples once returned to Earth, researchers would also want to remove parts of the sample and perform analyses. During all these handling procedures, the samples would need to be protected from Earthly contamination. A cleanroom is normally kept at a higher pressure than the external environment to keep contaminants out, while a biohazard laboratory is kept at a lower pressure to keep the biohazards in. This would require to compartmentalize the specialized rooms in order to combine these in a single building. Solutions suggested include a triple walled containment facility, and one of the suggestions include extensive robotic handling of the samples.\n\nThe facility would be expected to take 7 to 10 years from design to completion, and an additional two years is recommended for the staff to become accustomed to the facilities.\n\nRobert Zubrin, from the Mars Society, maintains that the risk of back contamination is negligible. He supports this using an argument based on the possibility of transfer of life from Earth to Mars on meteorites.\n\nMargaret Race has examined in detail the legal process of approval for a MSR. She found that under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) (which did not exist in the Apollo era) a formal environment impact statement is likely to be required, and public hearings during which all the issues would be aired openly. This process is likely to take up to several years to complete.\n\nDuring this process, she found, the full range of worst accident scenarios, impact, and project alternatives would be played out in the public arena. Other agencies such as the Environment Protection Agency, Occupational Health and Safety Administration, etc., may also get involved in the decision making process.\n\nThe laws on quarantine will also need to be clarified as the regulations for the Apollo program were rescinded. In the Apollo era, NASA delayed announcement of its quarantine regulations until the day Apollo was launched, so bypassing the requirement for public debate - something that would be unlikely to be tolerated today.\n\nIt is also probable that the presidential directive NSC-25 will apply which requires a review of large scale alleged effects on the environment and is carried out subsequent to the other domestic reviews and through a long process, leads eventually to presidential approval of the launch.\n\nThen apart from those domestic legal hurdles, there are numerous international regulations and treaties to be negotiated in the case of a Mars sample-return, especially those relating to environmental protection and health. She concluded that the public of necessity has a significant role to play in the development of the policies governing Mars sample-return.\n\nSeveral exobiologists have suggested that a Mars sample-return is not necessary at this stage, and that it is better to focus more on in situ studies on the surface first. Although it is not their main motivation, this approach of course also eliminates back contamination risks.\n\nSome of these exobiologists advocate more in situ studies followed by a sample-return in the near future. Others go as far as to advocate in situ study instead of a sample-return at the present state of understanding of Mars.\n\nTheir reasoning is that life on Mars is likely to be hard to find. Any present day life is likely to be sparse and occur in only a few niche habitats. Past life is likely to be degraded by cosmic radiation over geological time periods if exposed in the top few meters of the Mars surface. Also, only certain special deposits of salts or clays on Mars would have the capability to preserve organics for billions of years. So, they argue, there is a high risk that a Mars sample-return at our current stage of understanding would return samples that are no more conclusive about the origins of life on Mars or present day life than the Martian meteorite samples we already have.\n\nAnother consideration is the difficulty of keeping the sample completely free from Earth life contamination during the return journey and during handling procedures on Earth. This might make it hard to show conclusively that any biosignatures detected does not result from contamination of the samples.\n\nInstead they advocate sending more sensitive instruments on Mars surface rovers. These could examine many different rocks and soil types, and search for biosignatures on the surface and so examine a wide range of materials which could not all be returned to Earth with current technology at reasonable cost.\n\nA sample-return to Earth would then be considered at a later stage, once we have a reasonably thorough understanding of conditions on Mars, and possibly have already detected life there, either current or past life, through biosignatures and other \"in situ\" analyses.\n\n\n\nDuring the “Exploration Telerobotics Symposium\" in 2012 experts on telerobotics from industry, NASA and academics met to discuss telerobotics, and its applications to space exploration. Amongst other issues, particular attention was given to Mars missions and a Mars sample-return.\n\nThey came to the conclusion that telerobotic approaches could permit direct study of the samples on the Mars surface via telepresence from Mars orbit, permitting rapid exploration and use of human cognition to take advantage of chance discoveries and feedback from the results obtained so far.\n\nThey found that telepresence exploration of Mars has many advantages. The astronauts have near real-time control of the robots, and can respond immediately to discoveries. It also prevents contamination both ways and has mobility benefits as well.\n\nReturn of the sample to orbit has the advantage that it permits analysis of the sample without delay, to detect volatiles that may be lost during a voyage home. This was the conclusion of a meeting of researchers at the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center in 2012.\nSimilar methods could be used to directly explore other biologically sensitive moons such as Europa, Titan, or Enceladus, once the human presence in the vicinity becomes possible.\n"}

In many species, such recognition is necessary for procreation.\n\nDifferent species may employ different methods, but all of them are based on one or more senses (after all, this is how the organism gathers information about the environment). The recognition may happen by chemical signature (smell), by having a distinctive shape or color (sight), by emitting certain sounds (hearing), or even by behaviour patterns. Often a combination of these is used.\n\nAmong human beings, the sense of sight is usually in charge of recognizing other members of the same species, with maybe the subconscious help of smell. In particular, the human brain has a disproportionate amount of processing power dedicated to finely analyze the features of a human face. This is why we are able to distinguish basically all six billions of human beings from each other (barring look-alikes), and a human being from a similar species like some anthropomorphic ape, with only a quick glance.\n\nIntra-species recognition systems are often subtle. For example, ornithologists have great difficulty in distinguishing the chiffchaff from the willow warbler by eye, and there is no evidence that the birds themselves can do so other than by the different songs of the male. Sometimes, intra-species recognition is fallible: in many species of frog, the males are not uncommonly seen copulating with females of the wrong species or even with inanimate objects.\n\n\"Heliconius charithonia\" displays intra-species recognition by roosting with conspecifics. They do this with the help of UV rhodopsins in the eye that help them distinguish between ultraviolet yellow pigments and regular yellow pigments. They have also been known to emit chemical cues in order to recognize members of their own species.\n\n"}

He was the son of professor Jose Manuel Aldea and Ursula Fonseca. His childhood was spent in Santiago with his paternal grandparents, Juan de Dios Aldea and Maria Antonieta Contreras. At the age of 8 he enrolled in the Franciscan School of Chillán, directed by his father. Here he distinguished himself with his excellent handwriting and his evident interest for military exercises.\n\nAfter living for four years with his aunt, on August 1, 1872, he enrolled as a volunteer soldier in the Financial Commission sent by the Navy's Artillery Battalion; an organization located in Valparaiso which was dependent on the General Command of the Chilean Navy. In this battalion, he also served as a chief.\n\nHe stayed in the First Company of that battalion for two years. In April 1874 he was sent on commission to Valdivia and on May 11 was promoted to 2nd Corporal.\n\nOn January 1, 1876 he was promoted to 1st Corporal, and a year later to 2nd Sergeant.\n\nIn June 1877 he embarked on the corvette \"Esmeralda\". In February 1878 he was transferred to the pontoon \"Thalaba\", and, after staying a month, he returned to the First Company of the Battalion. In October he was back in the \"Thalaba\" and in December returned to the Company of the Battalion, having transferred to the post of Guard of the Municipality of Valparaíso.\n\nDue to his impeccable service record, upon the declaration of the War of the Pacific, he was assigned to the corvette \"Esmeralda\".\n\nOn May 21, 1879, the \"Esmeralda\", along with the \"Covadonga\", blockaded the Peruvian port of Iquique. After the lookout of the \"Covadonga\" spotted the Peruvian ships \"Huascar\" and \"Independencia\", Aldea joined the gunners and took over their combat post. After an hour of combat, the Peruvian Commander Miguel Grau Seminario ordered the \"Huascar\" to ram the Esmeralda.\n\n"}
{"id": "8616990", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8616990", "title": "Judoon", "text": "Judoon\n\nThe Judoon are a fictional extraterrestrial species of mercenary police from the British science fiction television programme \"Doctor Who\" and its spin-offs. They first appeared in the episode \"Smith and Jones\" in 2007, at which time, The Doctor was portrayed by David Tennant.\n\nJudoon are galactic police, brutal in their precise application of the law and highly logical in their battle tactics, but not very intelligent. In fact, the Doctor states that, whilst their behaviour is (on the surface) that of a military police force, they are really little more than \"interplanetary thugs\". They have no jurisdiction on Earth and no authority to deal with human crime (when hunting a fugitive alien in an Earth hospital, they transported the building to the Moon); they will, however, strictly obey any laws on the planet they are on (e.g. road speed limits). The Judoon carry energy weapons which can incinerate humans.\n\nJudoon are upright-standing bipeds, with rhinoceros-like heads and only four digits on each hand: they wear black, bulky armour with heavy boots. According to the Doctor, the Judoon have a \"great big lung reserve\" which allows them to survive for extended periods in a limited oxygen environment. They have yellow blood.\n\nIn \"Smith and Jones\", the Doctor had never encountered the race on-screen before, but during the episode he repeatedly demonstrates considerable knowledge of them and their methods. The Judoon used an HO Scoop to bring a hospital which held the Tenth Doctor and Martha Jones to the moon where the Judoon could apprehend a criminal (species Plasmavore), which disguised itself as Florence Finnegan. The Judoon came in ships and landed on the moon, trying to find Finnigan with their scanners, but at first couldn't due to Finnigan assimilating human blood. However she was revealed when Finnigan took the Doctor (a non-human)'s blood. They executed her for murdering an alien princess and afterwards transported the hospital back to Earth.\n\nIn \"Revenge of the Slitheen\", from the spin-off series \"The Sarah Jane Adventures\", they were mentioned by the Slitheen, who said that the Intergalactic Police were after them.\n\nIn the novella \"Revenge of the Judoon\", where they seized Balmoral Castle in 1902 after being conned into a fraudulent mission, they made a deal with the Doctor that meant Earth was off-limits to them, something confirmed as canonical with the TV series by the BBC \"Monster Files\" feature. The Judoon are also mentioned in the \"Doctor Who Adventures\" comic \"The Great Mordillo.\"\n\nThey appear in \"The Stolen Earth\" as guards at the Shadow Proclamation. The TARDIS does not translate their language, because it is the universal law, like The Shadow Proclamation, and the Doctor replies in their language rather than in English. They only begin speaking English once he has introduced himself.\n\nIn \"Prisoner of the Judoon\", Captain Tybo, a Judoon, crashes on Earth while his prisoner, Androvax, escapes, leaving Tybo hunting for him. He is knocked unconscious by Androvax and saved by Sarah Jane Smith and her gang, who helped him find Androvax 'the Annihilator' who, as a veil form, has the ability to possess people; he uses this to possess Sarah Jane. Captain Tybo commandeers a London Metropolitan Police car and goes to Bannerman Road where he receives a call that more Judoon are coming. When Tybo and the gang go in they find that Sarah Jane has ordered Mr Smith to blow up in 60 seconds, but Luke stops him by reminding him that he is programmed to protect the planet. Tybo goes to the genetic system and regroups with the rest of the Judoon, finds Androvax and takes him back to the Shadow Proclamation. Despite the Judoon's nominal lack of jurisdiction on Earth, Tybo aggressively enforces English car radio volume limits and once points his machine gun at the driver of a nearby car whose music was too loud. Additionally, he and his colleagues summarily sentence Clyde Langer and Rani Chandra to restriction to Earth as punishment for their interference.\n\nJudoon are seen as part of an alliance of the Doctor's enemies in \"The Pandorica Opens\", who imprison him in the Pandorica beneath Stonehenge, believing he will destroy the Universe.\n\nIn \"A Good Man Goes to War\", a small group of Judoon are recruited by the Doctor to join his army in the Battle of Demon's Run. Alongside Sontaran commander Strax, a large battalion of Silurian warriors, and the newly space-pirating former crew of the \"Fancy\", they help to apprehend Colonel Manton and his Cleric forces.\n\nIndividual Judoon are seen in a handful of other episodes: eyeing a Raxacoricofallapatorian in a Zagizalgul bar in \"The End of Time\"; when Colony Sarff visits the Shadow Proclamation in \"The Magician's Apprentice; and living in the trap street in \"Face the Raven\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Offered by her owner to the riflemen of the First Brigade of the Polish Legions, she became the service mount of Commandant Józef Piłsudski, who entered Kielce on her in August 1914 and kept her as a riding horse until her untimely death 13 years later.\n\nShe was an elegant mare of moderate height, about at the withers, chestnut (light reddish-brown) in color, with markings that included a blaze and four white stockings. \n\nKasztanka was Józef Piłsudski's favorite horse and faithful companion in the Polish Legions' battles at the side of Austro-Hungary and Germany in World War I, for the independence of Poland. Indeed, she acknowledged only Piłsudski. Her task was to carry the Commandant during the First Brigade's marches. She was not remarkable for any unique gait nor for extraordinary feats of courage, but she was very loyal. Kasztanka was somewhat high-strung and hated artillery fire, but when her master asked, she remained controlled and obedient under difficult conditions, reciprocating his devotion.\n\nThe Polish Legions' First Uhlan Regiment, commanded by Colonel Władysław Belina-Prażmowski, presented Piłsudski with new trappings for Kasztanka, and it was in these that she henceforth appeared.\n\nIn 1922 Kasztanka went to Mińsk Mazowiecki into the care of the 7th Lublin Uhlan Regiment. From there she would be sent to Warsaw when Marshal Piłsudski, as Commander-in-Chief, was to take part in state ceremonies and, seated astride Kasztanka, review military parades. When he was at his country house in Sulejówek, the mare was sometimes brought there to visit, especially to the Marshal's daughters, Wanda and Jadwiga.\n\nKasztanka gave birth to two foals over the course of her life, a colt and a filly. Other than that in both cases she gave birth when she was stabled at the 7th Uhlan Regiment in Mińsk Mazowiecki, little information has been preserved concerning their sires, except that they were government-owned stallions. The colt, a gray named \"Niemen\" after the river, inherited only his dam's good looks but not her personality; he was lazy. He was proposed to succeed Kasztanka in serving Marshal Piłsudski, but never did. Kasztanka's filly, which Piłsudski christened \"Mera\" in memory of the river that flowed through Zułów, the family estate where he had been born, was foaled April 10, 1925, and was a chestnut like Kasztanka. In 1930, according to her surviving records, Mera was in the care of the First Light Cavalry Regiment as \"officer's service horse of First Marshal Józef Piłsudski.\"\n\nMarshal Piłsudski rode Kasztanka for the last time on November 11, 1927, at the Polish Independence Day parade on Warsaw's Saxon Square (now Piłsudski Square).\n\nTen days after Kasztanka's final parade, on November 21, 1927, she was sent by rail back to the 7th Uhlan Regiment at Mińsk Mazowiecki, where she was stabled. However, she became ill or injured en route and died two days later. The final report on her, in an addendum to the Regimental order of the day dated November 25, 1927, read:\n\n\"On November 3, 1927, the mare Kasztanka, property of Marshal Piłsudski, was sent to Warsaw for a parade celebrating the ninth anniversary of Poland's Independence on November 11. She was sent on the instructions of the military cabinet of the Minister of Military Affairs. Kasztanka was a saddle mare that had been ridden by Marshal Piłsudski since 1914. Kasztanka took part on November 11 in the parade, being mounted for the last time by Marshal Piłsudski. On November 21, 1927, she was sent by rail transport to Mińsk Mazowiecki, and became ill en route. Upon arrival at the railroad station, despite assistance rendered by the 7th Uhlan Regiment's doctor of veterinary medicine, Lt. W. Koppe, she was unable to rise. She was transported to barracks. In view of the worsening state of her health, veterinary assistance was summoned from Warsaw, and on the night of November 21–22 Lt. Col. Konrad Millak and Lt. Col. Władysław Kulczycki arrived. These doctors of veterinary medicine took further energetic measures. They did not succeed in improving the state of [Kasztanka's] health, and at 10 o'clock that day they issued the following assessment: 'Grave internal trauma... severe distress to blood vessels and heart.' Kasztanka died on November 23, 1927, at five o'clock in the morning.\"\n\nThe order of the day was signed by the 7th Uhlan Regiment's commander at the time, Lt. Col. Zygmunt Piasecki, who later complained that after Kasztanka's death Marshal Piłsudski would not talk to him. \n\nReportedly on the train, Kasztanka had attempted to get to the other side of a partition and had struck her backbone against a pole with all her force, and this was the cause of her injury and death. \nAfter her death, Kasztanka's body underwent taxidermy; in this form, after Marshal Piłsudski's death in 1935, she was given a place in the Belweder Palace museum. The rest of her remains were buried in a park at the barracks of the 7th Uhlan Regiment, beneath a stone inscribed, \"Here lies \"KASZTANKA\", favorite combat mare of Marshal Piłsudski.\"\n\nDuring World War II, under German occupation, the stuffed \"Kasztanka\" ended up in Warsaw's Museum of the Polish Armed Forces. The mount survived the war, but due to lack of routine care for the collections, was badly damaged by moths. After the war she was probably cremated. By some accounts, this was done at the behest of Marshal Michał Rola-Żymierski, who had opposed Marshal Piłsudski's May 1926 Coup d'État and been court-martialled and demoted from general to private, but during World War II had been restored by the Soviet Union's Marshal Joseph Stalin to the rank of general and on May 3, 1945, promoted to Marshal.\n\nKasztanka earned a place not only in the hearts of Marshal Piłsudski and his family, but in those of their countrymen. She became an equine celebrity. The first songs of Polish soldiers during World War I, written by K. Biernacki and B. Lubicz, featured \"Kasztanka\".\n\nShe was also a subject of Wojciech Kossak's 1928 painting \"Piłsudski on Horseback\", which hangs in the National Museum, Warsaw. This painting remains one of the most popular artistic portrayals of Piłsudski.\n\n\"Kasztanka\" figured as well in satirical artwork and songs produced by Piłsudski's political opponents.\n\n"}

His career began in 1927 as curator of the . From 1934 to 1956, he was director of the Staatlichen Kunsthalle Karlsruhe (National Art Gallery Karlsruhe). In 1940 he was appointed Head of the Municipal Museums of Strasbourg as well as Chief Commissioner of the Alsatian Museums. In 1956 he became Director of the Karlsruher Kunstakademie (Academy of Art Karlsruhe), and in 1957 General Director of the Bayerischen Staatsgemäldesammlungen (Bavarian State Painting Collection).\n\nMartin was a Protestant. He was married to Dr. med. Hildegard Wangrin since 1928.\n\nKurt Martin was born on January 31, 1899 in Zurich, as the third son of Rudolf Martin (1864–1925), professor of anthropology from Baden, and his wife Anna Hein (1865–1940). In Zurich, he attended elementary school before changing to the École Nouvelle in Lausanne and later to a secondary school in Karlsruhe. There he passed his Abitur (final secondary school examinations) in 1917. He served as a soldier in World War I. In 1920 he started his philosophy studies (among others with Martin Heidegger and Edmund Husserl) and majored in art history (with Hans Jantzen) at the University of Freiburg. He completed his art studies in 1924 at the Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München with Heinrich Wölfflin (1864–1945) with his PhD thesis on the subject of \"Die Nürnberger Steinplastik im 14. Jahrhundert\" (The Nuremberger Effigy in the 14th century).\n\nMartin started his career in 1927 as a volunteer at the Kunsthalle Mannheim (\"Art Gallery Mannheim\") with Gustav Friedrich Hartlaub. Soon he was appointed research assistant and subsequently curator at the Baden State Museum, Karlsruhe. In 1931 he addressed himself to the task of organizing the exhibition \"German Poets as Painters and Drawers\" for the Kunstverein (\"art society\") Heidelberg.\n\nIn the early 1930s Martin met Robert Wagner, a confidant of Adolf Hitler and NSDAP politician with whom Martin would have to do until 1945.\n\nIn the autumn of 1933 Wagner commissioned Martin with the development and organization of an army museum of Baden. Together with the retired Colonel Erich Blankenhorn, who had just been dismissed as chief of the Badische Landespolizei (\"State Police of Baden)\" by the new rulers, he built up an independent museum under the aegis of the Baden State Museum Karlsruhe (Badisches Landesmuseum). For this purpose premises were made available in the former stables of the Karlsruhe Palace, the residence of the State museum. On May 13, 1934 Robert Wagner and Kurt Martin inaugurated the museum with 80.000 guests and two days of celebration. Besides departments of the army of the Reich (Reichswehr) and color guards of the military associations, a row of delegations of NS-organizations, including SA, SS and Reich Labor Service (Reichsarbeitsdienst), marched up in the demilitarized zone.\n\nIn his opening speech from the balcony of the palace, Martin declared that the museum had benefited from over one thousand donations of military antiques. The museum was not only supposed to include the regiments of Baden, but also the regiments of the earlier 15th Alsatian army corps. The museum was supposed to be a \"speaking memorial, teaching everyone the military-political achievements of our frontier people. [...] Here the youth shall learn to respect and understand the achievements of their fathers.\" Wagner said about the purposes of the museum: \"What is given to the public today in the shape of the Army Museum is nothing else than an intellectual legacy from a time of struggling and fighting for our Germany for the struggle and fight for our Germany.\" In reality, the exhibition was nothing more than a \"Potemkin village\". Erich Blankenhorn commented on the state of the museum on the date of the opening and said that due to the short preparation period \"it was only possible to decorate the first royal stables with historically incoherent paintings and objects.\" For that reason the museum was closed one day after the opening.\n\nOn July 2, 1934 Wagner appointed Martin head of the Staatliche Kunsthalle Karlsruhe (\"National Art Gallery Karlsruhe\"). He succeeded Hans Adolf Bühler who was loyal to the party line and whose management of the museum was characterized by a radical opposition to the so-called degenerate art. Martin remained head of the Staatliche Kunsthalle until 1956.\n\nBetween 1934 and 1939 the Staatliche Kunsthalle was limited in its activities. In the years between 1934 and 1937 the orangery building of the botanical garden was remodeled in order to accommodate a special department for the Baden paintings of the late 19th and 20th century as from 1938. Since 1934 the department of the old German Masterpieces had been reorganized. It was reopened to the public in 1937. Finally, the also redesigned department of the Dutch and Flemish painters reopened as well.\n\nBetween 1934 and 1937 several exhibitions were organized in the gallery of prints, including an exhibition about Hans Thoma in 1934 and an exhibition of the most recent acquisitions of old German masterpieces by the Staatliche Kunsthalle in 1936.\n\nFurthermore, two travelling exhibitions were organized for the elementary schools in Baden. In 1936 an exhibition about Hans Thoma was shown in 55 locations and totaled about 90.000 visitors, and in 1937 an exhibition about Albrecht Dürer was shown in 25 locations and registered about 45.000 visitors.\n\nBetween 1934 and 1937 the Staatliche Kunsthalle organized annually, among others, about forty tours for the Reichsarbeitsdienst (\"Reichs Labor Service\"), the organization \"Kraft durch Freude\" (KdF) (\"Strength Through Joy\"), the NS-Frauenschaft (\"Nazi women’s organization\"), the sisterhood of the Red Cross and schools.\n\nJust before the beginning of the war, on July 2, 1939, the museum was reopened and back in full operation. At the same time the Kunsthalle celebrated its 100th anniversary. On this occasion Robert Wagner opened a memorial exhibition for Hans Thoma showing 180 works. Besides private collectors and galleries, the Nationalgalerie (\"National Gallery\") in Berlin, the Hamburger Kunsthalle (\"Art Gallery Hamburg\") and the Städtische Galerie Frankfurt (\"Municipal Gallery Frankfurt\") contributed to this exhibition with loans. Martin meant to present Thoma as \"a master of the German landscape and as a great portraitist\". At the same time the newly renovated \"Feuerbachsaal\" was reopened to the public. It contained the German paintings of the 19th century that had been \"rearranged\". The state government of Baden donated a work of Trübner, and the city of Karlsruhe a work of Thoma.\n\nFrom 1940 on, the Kunsthalle remained closed.\n\nBetween 1934 and 1937 the Kunsthalle acquired 115 paintings under the direction of Martin, including works of Hans Thoma, Emil Lugo and Hermann Daur.\n\nFrom 1938 to 1939 the Kunsthalle acquired 53 paintings. Martin emphasized paintings of Wilhelm Trübner, Anselm Feuerbach and Hans Thoma in his account report. Among the works that were marked as \"transfers\" were paintings by Karl Buchholz, Hermann Burte, Joseph Fratrel and Adolph von Menzel. At the same time the Kunsthalle acquired 175 drawings, 636 graphic print works and four sketchbooks. Regarding the drawings, Martin emphasized eight sheets by Ferdinand Kobell, three by Franz Kobell and nine by Wilhelm Trübner, as well as – a gift of the NSDAP-Gauleitung of Baden – the \"valuable early drawing of Hans Thoma, Schönau im Wiesental (Schönau in the valley of Wiesen)\".\n\nIn 1940, the collection of the Staatliche Kunsthalle Karlsruhe \"was enriched by a few works mainly by artists from Baden\". For example, the museum acquired paintings from Albert Lang, Fritz Boehle, Ferdinand Keller, Ernst Württemberger, and Eduard Hunziker, and several drawings by Hans Thoma and Ferdinand Keller.\n\nIn his activities report for the year 1940, Martin wrote: \"The General Administration managed to accomplish a few essential acquisitions for the public museums which will be reported about later in context.\"\n\nThe Kunsthalle Karlsruhe continuously took over art works from originally Jewish property. In a statement from 1947, Martin listed about 100 works, including works from the collections of Richard Lenel, Mannheim (one work), Benno Weil, Mannheim (one work), Siegfried Reiss, Mannheim (44 works), Arthur Levis, Karlsruhe (one work), E. Reiss, Heidelberg (three works), Paul Homburger, Karlsruhe (three works), Ettlinger, Karlsruhe (one work), Klara Goldschmit, Karlsruhe, Salomon, Karlsruhe (one work), Ernst Gallinek, Baden Baden (16 works and a porcelain collection including more than 400 objects) and Violetta von Waldberg, Heidelberg (wife of Max von Waldberg) (four works). The Kunsthalle took over these works from other State authorities that had expropriated the previous owners. Most of the works mentioned by Martin were transferred to the Kunsthalle from authorities, partly against payment. The Kunsthalle acquired 20 works on its own initiative from an \"Auction Sale of Jewish Property 6th-9th August 1941 in Karlsruhe\".\n\nIn 1935, Kurt Martin acquired the work \"Portrait of the Marchesa Veronica Spinola Doria\" by Peter Paul Rubens for 63.000 Reichsmark at the liquidation auction of the gallery van Diemen & Co. GmbH. In the 1950s the Kunsthalle Karlsruhe paid compensation to the heirs of the Jewish gallery directors. In 2000 a new compensation was claimed without success. This acquisition was not mentioned in the report for the years 1934 until 1937.\n\nWith the occupation of Alsatia, Robert Wagner became chief of the Alsatian Civilian Administration and had complete political freedom. It was his main objective to ensure that Alsatia become \"German\" again, in particular that Strasbourg become the \"preeminent first cultural center of the German Reich\". He pursued this goal in the performing arts by founding several theatres and establishing German libraries. Moreover, he prohibited the use of the French language in public and Germanized all toponyms.\n\nKurt Martin was responsible for the museums and helped Wagner prepare his \"vision of a cultural model-district Alsatia-Baden\".\n\nOn November 17, 1940, as \"State Representative for the Museums in Alsatia\", Martin describes the initial situation in Strasbourg in the light of the new political realities in an article about the future of the museums in \"our land at the Upper Rhine\": In the city, the Palais Rohan and the Frauenhausmuseum unite the architecture of the Middle Ages and the 18th century in a \"unique way in Germany\". This unity is also reflected in the museums' inventories. Martin aimed especially at the development of museums as places of national education with a regional and local focus.\n\nWith this scope in mind, Martin aimed at the expansion of the Strasbourg collection \"on European grounds\". He wanted to develop the collection as a collection of European significance.\n\nAt the instigation of Wagner, Martin became director of the Municipal Museums of Strasbourg. He also kept his position in Karlsruhe. As of April 1, 1941 he became the Director of the General Administration of the Upper Rhine Museums, thus of all museums in Baden and Alsatia.\n\nFrom 1941 to 1944, Martin purchased about 40 paintings and a series of other objet d'arts in the Netherlands. Some works with Dutch provenance, which Martin purchased, are part of the Dutch art collection (NK Collection) today.\n\nIn the database of the NK Collection, the following purchases of Martin are listed:\n\nKurt Martin was able to reintegrate his position as director of the Staatliche Kunsthalle Karlsruhe immediately in the summer of 1945, especially because Walter W. Horn, officers from the French Art Protection and his former French colleagues from Strasbourg confirmed his great integrity and qualification. Martin supported the French and American authorities in locating and rescuing the artworks that had been stored for purposes of protection during wartime.\n\nIn 1946 he co-founded the International Council of Museums and remained director of the German National Committee for 15 years. From 1948 until shortly before his death in 1975, he was a member of the administrative board of the Germanic National Museum in Nuremberg. In 1947 he was already able to exhibit masterpieces of the museum in St. Gall. In 1951 he reopened the museum in Karlsruhe. He added a pedagogical department to the museum, which was a novel idea at the time. In 1948 he curated an exhibition of German art for the Federal Foreign Office, which was shown in several cities in the United States. In 1950 he organized the exhibition \"Des maîtres de Cologne à Albrecht Dürer\" showing works of old German masters in Paris. He initiated the exhibition \"German watercolors, drawings and prints: A midcentury review\", which was shown by the German government in the US in 1956. Martin was one of the co-founders of the \"documenta\" in Kassel, an exhibition for contemporary art that took place for the first in time 1956. He was a member of the documenta-council for many years.\n\nIn 1956 he became director of the Academy of Art Karlsruhe. In 1957 he transferred to Munich, succeeding Ernst Buchner in the General Direction of the Bayerische Staatsgemäldesammlungen (\"Bavarian State Painting Collections\"). He retired in 1964. In Munich, Martin was responsible for the establishment of several museum branches in different cities in Bavaria. He also promoted the extension of the Munich Museum collections to contemporary art works.\n\nKurt Martin was one of the leading museum directors of his time.\n\nHe had a wide range of research interests. He published several articles about the art of the Middle Ages and Renaissance, the French painters of the 19th century and modern art.\n\nIn 1963 he received the Bavarian order of merit and in 1964 he was appointed to Dr.-Ing. e.h. by the TH Karlsruhe.\n\n"}

After graduating, he moved to New York City in 1958, and joined the A&R staff at Bobby Robinson's Fury and Fire record labels as their Southern promotions executive. He soon discovered singer Wilbert Harrison, whose recording of the Leiber and Stoller song \"Kansas City\" topped the US pop and R&B charts in 1959. The following year he secured another chart-topper for the Fire label, when he signed flamboyant New Orleans singer Bobby Marchan, who had a hit with \"There's Something on Your Mind\". He also discovered Lee Dorsey, pairing him with young songwriter and pianist Allen Toussaint, and helped secure hits for Gladys Knight and the Pips and Buster Brown. He ran sessions for the Fire and Fury labels in New Orleans, until the labels collapsed in 1963. He was credited as co-writer on many recordings including \"One Way Out\", which is usually credited to Sehorn and Elmore James.\n\nSehorn remained in New Orleans after the labels folded, and set up his own music publishing company, Rhinelander Music. He persuaded Toussaint to write new material for Lee Dorsey, which included \"Ride Your Pony\" and \"Working in the Coal Mine\", both of which became international hits. With Toussaint, he founded the Sansu record label, and signed singer Betty Harris. Harris' records for the label, including \"Nearer To You\", were among the first to feature the label's house band, who became The Meters. By the late 1960s, Sehorn and Toussaint had become \"the most influential music-makers in New Orleans\", and built the Sea-Saint recording studio in Gentilly. There they recorded such musicians as Dr. John, The Neville Brothers, and Labelle, whose \"Lady Marmalade\" was the studio's biggest hit. The studio also attracted Paul McCartney, whose 1975 Wings album \"Venus and Mars\" was largely recorded there.\n\nMarshal Sehorn decided in the 1970s to get out of the actual producing and recording of music, and he entered into the licensing end of the business. He started multiple companies, including Blue Dog Express, Red Dog Express and White Dog Records by which he exploited the rights to music, some of which he did not own.\n\nHe attempted to acquire certain rights to the Chess Records catalogue but MCA Records exercised a superior claim to the titles in the Chess Records catalogue, and sued him for infringement in California. \"In an action brought by MCA, the Los Angeles Superior Court determined that Red Dog and its owner, Marshall Sehorn, never in fact had any rights to the Chess Masters.\" MCA Records pursued another infringer Charly Holdings, Inc. \nSehorn lost, and when he could not pay the judgment, he and his companies declared bankruptcy. The bankruptcy estate started a company called Gulf Coast Music to hold the titles to music in Sehorn's Express company catalogs. Gulf Coast Music then turned over titles of songs to artists like Betty Harris who had been denied royalties for decades by Sehorn. In bankruptcy, drummer Joseph Modeliste of The Meters sought to file a claim for assets of Sehorn's estate, but the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed that Modeliste filed his claims with the bankruptcy court too late.\n\nSehorn had been sued before over unpaid royalties by artists like the Shirelles and B.J. Thomas.\nSehorn died in New Orleans of a respiratory disease in 2006, at the age of 72.\n"}

Kealy was the commander of a nine-member SAS squad, which came under attack from hundreds of PFLOAG guerillas during the Dhofar Rebellion in Oman.\n\nKealy died of hypothermia in February 1979 when he joined SAS candidates on a selection march in the Brecon Beacons in deteriorating weather conditions. He was found alive (but in poor condition) by a two-man search party—one of whom stayed with him and attempted to keep him warm. It was later acknowledged by the coroner that one of the major contributory factors in his death was the delay in retrieving him from the hillside—a delay of some 19 hours due to inclement weather. Another factor was that Kealy had not packed cold weather gear, instead carrying bricks in his Bergen pack to increase its weight to 50 pounds. When offered warm clothing by the search party, he refused—and even threw a warm blanket away. A combination of Kealy's bloody-minded stubbornness and the effects of hypothermia clouding his judgement seems to have been the tipping point.\n\nAs a direct result of this and similar incidents, those attempting SAS selection are now allowed to carry only useful items in their bergens when marching.\n\nSir Ranulph Fiennes turns the real Mike Kealy into a fictional character in his book \"The Feather Men\". In the novel, Mike Kealy is murdered by a group of contract killers called \"The Clinic\" in revenge for his role in Oman that had resulted in the killing of a sheik's son. Rather than succumbing to the extreme weather conditions while on an endurance march, as actually happened, the fictional character dies after going into diabetic shock following him being injected with insulin by \"The Clinic\".\n\n"}
{"id": "53010729", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=53010729", "title": "Mirror life", "text": "Mirror life\n\nMirror life (also called mirror-image life, chiral life, or enantiomeric life) is a hypothetical form of life with mirror-reflected molecular building blocks. The possibility of mirror life was first discussed by Louis Pasteur. Although this alternative life form has not been discovered in nature, efforts to build a mirror-image version of biology's molecular machinery are already underway.\n\nMany of the essential molecules for life on Earth can exist in two mirror-image forms, referred to as \"left-handed\" and \"right-handed\", but living organisms do not use both. Proteins are exclusively composed of left-handed amino acids; RNA and DNA contain only right-handed sugars. This phenomenon is known as homochirality. It is not known whether homochirality emerged before or after life, whether the building blocks of life must have this particular chirality, or indeed whether life needs to be homochiral. Protein chains built from amino acids of mixed chirality tend not to fold or function as catalysts, but mirror-image proteins have been constructed that work the same but on substrates of opposite handedness.\n\nIt is thought that such mirror organisms can be highly incompatible with existing microbes (viruses, bacteria, protozoa, etc.). Hypothetically, it is possible to recreate an entire ecosystem from the bottom up, in chiral form. In this way, the creation of an Earth ecosystem without microbial diseases might be possible. In some distant future, mirror life could be employed to create robust, effective and disease-free ecosystems for use on other planets.\n\nAdvances in synthetic biology, like synthesizing viruses since 2002, partially synthetic bacteria in 2010, or synthetic ribosomes in 2013, may lead to the possibility of fully synthesizing a living cell from small molecules, where we could use mirror-image versions (enantiomers) of life's building-block molecules, in place of the standard ones. Some proteins have been synthesized in mirror-image versions, including polymerase in 2016.\n\nReconstructing regular lifeforms in mirror-image form, using the mirror-image (chiral) reflection of their cellular components, could be achieved by substituting left-handed amino acids with right-handed ones, in order to create mirror reflections of all regular proteins. Analogously, we could get reflected sugars, DNA, etc., on which reflected enzymes would work perfectly. Finally we would get a normally functioning mirror reflection of a natural organism - a chiral counterpart organism - with which natural viruses and bacteria couldn't interact. Electromagnetic force (chemistry) is unchanged under such molecular reflection transformation (P-symmetry). There is a small alteration of weak interactions under reflection, which can produce very small corrections, but these corrections are many orders of magnitude lower than thermal noise - almost certainly too tiny to alter any biochemistry. However, there are also theories that weak interactions can have a greater effect on longer nucleic acids or protein chains, resulting in much less efficient conversion of mirror ribozymes or enzymes than normal ribozymes or enzymes.\n\nChiral animals would need to feed on reflected food, produced by reflected plants. The great advantage, though, is that such chiral organisms should enjoy a disease-free life, completely immune to all viruses and microbes (which virologists are now beginning to understand underlie a huge number of diseases).\n\nViruses would be completely incompatible with the reflected cellular structures; and bacteria, protozoa, and fungi could not function because they would not be able to find normal sugars inside reflected organisms. The reverse sugars circulating in the chiral organism's body would be indigestible as far as normal bacteria are concerned, so any bacterium entering a chiral organism would simply starve to death. The chiral environment is hostile for normal viruses, protozoa, bacteria, etc.\n\nMirror life presents potential dangers. For example, a chiral-mirror version of cyanobacteria, which only needs achiral nutrients and light for photosynthesis, could take over Earth's ecosystem due to lack of natural enemies, disturbing the bottom of the food chain by producing mirror versions of the required sugars. Some bacteria can digest L-glucose; exceptions like this would give some rare lifeforms an unanticipated advantage.\n\nDirect application of mirror-chiral organisms can be mass production of enantiomers (mirror-image) of molecules produced by normal life.\n\n\nThe creation of one chiral human is the basis of 1950 Arthur C. Clarke's story \"Technical Error\", from The Collected Stories. In this story, a physical accident transforms a person into his mirror image, speculatively explained by travel through a fourth physical dimension.\n\nAn alien machine that reverses chirality, and a blood-symbiote that functions properly only when in one chirality, were central to Roger Zelazny's 1976 novel Doorways in the Sand.\n\nIn the 2017 Daniel Suarez novel \"Change Agent\", an antagonist, Otto, nicknamed the \"Mirror Man\", is revealed to be a genetically-engineered enantiomeric human. He views other humans with disdain and causes them to feel an inexplicable repulsion by his very presence.\n\n"}
{"id": "3503442", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3503442", "title": "Mitr Chaibancha", "text": "Mitr Chaibancha\n\nMitr Chaibancha (Thai มิตร ชัยบัญชา (Pronunciation), January 28, 1934 in Phetchaburi, Thailand - October 8, 1970) was a Thai film actor who made 266 films from 1956 to 1970.\n\nHe died on October 8, 1970 at Dongtan Beach, Jomtien, Pattaya, after falling from a helicopter during the filming of a stunt for the final scene of \"Insee thong\" (\"Golden Eagle\").\n\nAt the height of his career in the 1960s, Mitr, along with Petchara Chaowarat, made a string of hit films that packed cinemas. Of the 75 to 100 films produced each year by the Thai film industry during this period, Mitr starred in nearly half of them.\n\nMitr was born into poverty as Pichet Pumhem. His parents separated when he was an infant. At age 8, Mitr and his mother moved to Bangkok, where he was enrolled in a Thai boxing school. He became the lightweight boxing champion for his school in 1952, and went on to win three lightweight division titles. After finishing secondary school, he studied at Pranakhon College. He was then accepted into the Royal Thai Air Force aviation school, where he was trained as a pilot. After graduation, he worked as a flight instructor at Don Muang Royal Thai Air Force Base.\nIn 1956 some friends showed his photograph to journalist Kingkaew Kaewprasert, who introduced him to Surat Pukkawet, the editor of a movie magazine. Before long Mitra starred in his first film, \"Chart Sua\" (\"Tiger Instinct\"). It was then he decided to change his name from Pichet Pumhem to Mitr Chaibancha. He caught the attention of movie fans after starring in \"Chao Nakleng\" (\"Gangster Lord\"), using the character name Rom Ritthikrai from author Sake Dusit's \"Insee Daeng\" (\"Red Eagle\") series of novels.\n\nHe married his wife, Jaruwan, in 1959. In 1961 a son, Yuthana, or Ton, was born. However, the marriage ended in a divorce.\n\nIn 1961 Mitr starred in \"Banthuk Rak Pimchawee\" (\"Love Diary of Pimchawee\"), his first film with Petchara Chaowarat. This was the beginning of the most celebrated hero-heroine partnerships in Thai cinematic history. The Mitr-Petchara duo made about 165 films together.\n\nOne of the pair's most famous films was 1970's \"Monrak luk thung\" (, or \"Magical Love of the Countryside\"), a musical romantic comedy rhapsodizing Thai rural life.\n\nMitr was an extremely busy actor and was always on the move, going from set to set and sleeping as little as a two or three hours per night.\n\nAnother of his best-known movies, \"Pet Tad Pet\" (\"Operation Bangkok\"), was shot in both Bangkok and Hong Kong, and featured Kecha Plianvitheee and Luecha Naruenart as the villains, as well as Hong Kong's then top actress, Regina Piping.\n\n\"Monrak luk thung\" was one of Mitr's last films. It played in Bangkok cinemas for a solid six months in 1970 and took in 6 million baht, its popularity spurred by the best-selling soundtrack album and Mitr's accidental death while filming \"Insee Thong\".\n\n\"Insee thong\" was the first film that Mitr produced himself, and it featured the return of his popular character, the masked crime-fighter, Insee Daeng (Red Eagle), the secret alter ego of alcoholic detective Rom Rittikrai.\n\nOn the last day of shooting, the script called for Mitr, having vanquished the villains, to fly off into the sunset in a helicopter. As the camera rolled, Mitr leapt from the ground to grab a rope ladder hanging from the aircraft, only managing to reach the lowest rung. Unaware of this, the helicopter pilot flew higher and higher, and Mitr finally lost his grip and fell to the ground. The accident was all caught on film and was actually left in the final theatrical release. The fatal fall has since been removed from DVD versions of the film, with Mitr simply flying off into the distance and some onscreen text paying tribute to the star.\n\nIt was another death that would make 1970 a difficult year for the Thai film industry, as months earlier pioneering director Rattana Pestonji collapsed while giving a speech urging government officials to support the domestic film industry. He died several hours later.\n\nMitr’s death was ruled as a tragic accident. For safety, there should have been two takes for the final scene. The first would have been of Mitr grabbing the ladder and flying off at low altitude. Then, a stunt double would have performed a second shot at a higher altitude.\n\nOn the day of his funeral, the streets leading to the Buddhist temple were packed, with tens of thousands trying to attend his cremation rites. On the DVD of \"Insee thong\", release in 2005 in Thailand, one of the special features is footage of the cremation ceremony. Mitr's body is held up so the throngs of onlookers could catch a last glimpse of the dead star. He was survived by his former wife and one son.\n\nA memorial shrine to Mitr is situated on a small street in Jomtien, off Jomtien Road in front of the Amphoe Bang Lamung Revenue Department, behind Jomtien Palm Beach Hotel. The shrine is open from 6:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. daily. Inside the spirit house is a statue of Mitr holding a pistol in his right hand, reminiscent of his numerous roles as an action movie star. The walls are lined with photographs and other memorabilia. Fortune seekers visit the shrine, shake Kau Cim sticks and then check for the corresponding fortune on tablets hung on the shrine. If wishes have been granted, fortune seekers return and purchase a small offering to leave at the shrine.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "356772", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=356772", "title": "Murder of Stephen Lawrence", "text": "Murder of Stephen Lawrence\n\nStephen Lawrence (13 September 1974 – 22 April 1993) was a black British teenager from Plumstead, south east London, who was murdered in a racially motivated attack while waiting for a bus in Well Hall, Eltham on the evening of 22 April 1993. The case became a cause célèbre; its fallout included cultural changes of attitudes on racism and the police, and to the law and police practice. It also led to the partial revocation of the rule against double jeopardy. Two of the perpetrators were convicted of murder in 2012.\n\nAfter the initial investigation, five suspects were arrested but not charged. It was suggested during the investigation that Lawrence was killed because he was black, and that the handling of the case by the police and Crown Prosecution Service was affected by issues of race. A 1998 public inquiry, headed by Sir William Macpherson, examined the original Metropolitan Police Service (MPS) investigation and concluded that the force was institutionally racist. It also recommended that the double jeopardy rule should be repealed in murder cases to allow a retrial upon new and compelling evidence: this was effected in 2005 upon enactment of the Criminal Justice Act 2003. The publication in 1999 of the resulting Macpherson Report has been called \"one of the most important moments in the modern history of criminal justice in Britain\". Jack Straw, Home Secretary from 1997 to 2001, commented in 2012 that ordering the inquiry was \"the single most important decision I made as Home Secretary\". In 2010 the case was said to be \"one of the highest-profile unsolved racially motivated murders\".\n\nOn 18 May 2011, after a further review, it was announced that two of the original suspects, Gary Dobson and David Norris, were to stand trial for the murder in the light of new evidence. At the same time it was disclosed that Dobson's original acquittal had been quashed by the Court of Appeal, allowing a retrial to take place. Such an appeal had only become possible following the 2005 change in the law, although Dobson was not the first person to be retried for murder as a result. On 3 January 2012, Dobson and Norris were found guilty of Lawrence's murder; the pair were juveniles at the time of the crime and were sentenced to detention at Her Majesty's pleasure, equivalent to a life sentence for an adult, with minimum terms of 15 years 2 months and 14 years 3 months respectively for what the judge described as a \"terrible and evil crime\".\n\nIn the years after Dobson and Norris were sentenced, the case regained prominence when concerns of corrupt police conduct during the original case handling surfaced in the media. Such claims had surfaced before, and been investigated in 2006, but were reignited in 2013 when a former undercover police officer stated in an interview that, at the time, he had been pressured to find ways to \"smear\" and discredit the victim's family, to mute and deter public campaigning for better police responses to the case. Although further inquiries in 2012 by both Scotland Yard and the Independent Police Complaints Commission had ruled that there was no basis for further investigation, Home Secretary Theresa May ordered an independent inquiry by a prominent QC into undercover policing and corruption, which was described as \"devastating\" when published in 2014. An inquiry into whether members of the police force shielded the alleged killers was set up in October 2015.\n\nStephen Lawrence was born in Greenwich on 13 September 1974 to Jamaican parents who had emigrated to the UK in the 1960s. His father is Neville Lawrence, then a carpenter, and his mother is Doreen, then a special needs teacher. Brought up in Plumstead, South-East London, he was the eldest of three children, the others being Stuart (born 1976) and Georgina (born 1982). During his teenage years, Lawrence excelled in running, competing for the local Cambridge Harriers athletics club, and appeared as an extra in Denzel Washington's film \"For Queen and Country\". At the time of his death he was studying technology and physics at the Blackheath Bluecoat School and English language and literature at Woolwich College, and was hoping to become an architect.\n\nLawrence had spent the day of Thursday 22 April 1993 at Blackheath Bluecoat School. After school, he went to Lewisham to look around shops. After this, he travelled by bus to an uncle's house in Grove Park. He was joined there by Duwayne Brooks, and they played video games until leaving at around 10:00 pm. After realising that the 286 bus on which they were travelling would get them home late, they decided to change for either bus routes 161 or 122 on Well Hall Road.\n\nLawrence and Brooks arrived at the bus stop on Well Hall Road at 10:25 pm. He walked along Well Hall Road to the junction of Dickson Road to see if he could see a bus coming and then went back towards the bus stop. Brooks was still on Well Hall Road, part way between Dickson Road and the roundabout with Rochester Way and Westhorne Avenue.\n\nAt this point, Brooks saw a group of five or six white youths crossing over Rochester Way on the opposite side of the street near the area of the zebra crossing moving towards them. At or just after 10:38 pm, he called out to ask whether Lawrence saw the bus coming. Brooks claimed that he heard one of Lawrence's assailants saying: \"What, what, nigger?\" as they all quickly crossed the road and \"engulfed\" Lawrence.\n\nThe attackers forced Lawrence down and stabbed him to a depth of about on both sides of the front of his body, in the right collarbone and left shoulder. Both wounds severed axillary arteries before penetrating a lung. Lawrence lost all feeling in his right arm and his breathing was constricted, while he was losing blood from four major blood vessels. Brooks began running, and shouted for Lawrence to run to escape with him. While the attackers disappeared down Dickson Road, they both ran in the direction of Shooters Hill, though Lawrence collapsed and bled to death after running .\n\nBrooks ran to call an ambulance while an off-duty police officer stopped his car and covered Lawrence with a blanket. Lawrence was taken to Brook General Hospital by 11:05 pm, but he was already dead.\n\nAll three witnesses at the bus stop at the time of the attack said in statements that the attack was sudden and short, although none was later able to identify the suspects. In the days following Lawrence's murder, several residents came forward to provide names of suspects and an anonymous note was left on a police car windscreen and in a telephone box naming a local gang as the five main suspects. The suspects were Gary Dobson, brothers Neil and Jamie Acourt, Luke Knight and David Norris. In February 1999, officers investigating the handling of the initial inquiry revealed that a woman who might have been a vital witness had telephoned detectives three times within the first few days after the killing, and appealed for her to contact them again. The five suspects were previously involved in racist knife attacks around the Eltham area. Four weeks before Lawrence's death, Dobson and Neil Acourt were involved in the racist attack of a black teenager, Kevin London, whom they verbally abused and attempted to stab. Neil's brother Jamie was accused of stabbing teenagers Darren Witham in May 1992 and Darren Giles in 1994, causing Giles to have a heart attack. The stabbings of victims Gurdeep Bhangal and Stacey Benefield, which both occurred in March 1993, in Eltham, were also linked to Neil and Jamie Acourt, David Norris and Gary Dobson.\n\nWithin three days of the crime, prime suspects had been identified. No arrests were made, however, until over two weeks after the killing. Detective Superintendent Brian Weeden, the officer who had been leading the murder investigation from its third day, and who would ultimately lead the murder squad for 14 months, explained to an incredulous public inquiry in 1998 that part of the reason no arrests had taken place by the fourth day after the killing (Monday 26 April) was that he had not known the law allowed arrest upon reasonable suspicion – a basic point of criminal law.\n\nOn 7 May 1993, the Acourt brothers and Dobson were arrested. Norris turned himself in to police and was likewise arrested three days later. Knight was arrested on 3 June. Neil Acourt, picked out at an identity parade, and Luke Knight were charged with murder on 13 May and 23 June 1993 respectively, but the charges were dropped on 29 July 1993, the Crown Prosecution Service citing insufficient evidence.\n\nAn internal review was opened in August 1993 by the Metropolitan Police. On 16 April 1994, the Crown Prosecution Service stated they did not have sufficient evidence for murder charges against anyone else, despite a belief by the Lawrence family that new evidence had been found.\n\nIn April 1994, Lawrence's family initiated a private prosecution against the initial two suspects and three others: Jamie Acourt, Gary Dobson and David Norris. The family were not entitled to legal aid and a fighting fund was established to pay for the analysis of forensic evidence and the cost of tracing and re-interviewing witnesses. The family were represented by counsel Michael Mansfield QC, Martin Soorjoo and Margo Boye who worked \"pro bono\". The charges against Jamie Acourt and David Norris were dropped before the trial for lack of evidence. On 23 April 1996, the three remaining suspects were acquitted of murder by a jury at the Central Criminal Court, after the trial judge, the Honourable Mr Justice Curtis, ruled that the identification evidence given by Duwayne Brooks was unreliable. The Macpherson report endorsed the judgement, stating that \"Mr Justice Curtis could [have] properly reach[ed] only one conclusion\" and that \"[t]here simply was no satisfactory evidence available\".\n\nAn inquest into the death of Lawrence was held in February 1997. The five suspects refused to answer any questions, claiming privilege against self-incrimination. The inquest concluded on 13 February 1997, with the jury returning a verdict after 30 minutes' deliberation of unlawful killing \"in a completely unprovoked racist attack by five white youths\"; this finding went beyond the bounds of their instructions. On 14 February 1997, the \"Daily Mail\" newspaper labelled all five suspects \"murderers\". The headline read, \"Murderers: The Mail accuses these men of killing. If we are wrong, let them sue us.\" Underneath this headline appeared pictures of the five suspects: Dobson, Neil and Jamie Acourt, Knight, and Norris. None of the men ever sued for defamation and strong public opinions rose against the accused and the police who handled the case.\n\nIn July 1997 an inquiry was ordered by the Home Secretary to identify matters related to the killing, known as the Macpherson Report, which was completed in February 1999 \"(see below)\". In 2002, David Norris and Neil Acourt were convicted and jailed for racially aggravated harassment after an incident involving a plain-clothes black police officer.\n\nIn 2005 the law was changed. As part of the findings on the Lawrence case, the Macpherson Report had recommended that the rule against double jeopardy (the common law rule that once acquitted an accused person could not be tried a second time for the same crime) should be repealed in murder cases, and that it should be possible to subject an acquitted murder suspect to a second trial if \"fresh and viable\" new evidence later came to light. The Law Commission later added its support to this in its report \"Double Jeopardy and Prosecution Appeals\" (2001). A parallel report into the criminal justice system by Lord Justice Auld, a former senior presiding judge for England and Wales, had also commenced in 1999 and was published as the Auld Report 6 months after the Law Commission report. It opined that the Law Commission had been unduly cautious by limiting the scope to murder and that \"the exceptions should [...] extend to other grave offences punishable with life and/or long terms of imprisonment as Parliament might specify.\"\n\nThese recommendations were implemented within the Criminal Justice Act 2003, and this provision came into force in April 2005. It opened murder and certain other serious crimes (including manslaughter, kidnapping, rape, armed robbery, and some drug crimes) to a second prosecution, regardless of when committed, with two conditions – the retrial must be approved by the Director of Public Prosecutions, and the Court of Appeal must agree to quash the original acquittal because of new and compelling evidence.\n\nBetween the Lawrence murder and early 2010, Dobson was arrested or charged a number of times for offences such as theft and burglary. Some of these charges were dropped, at least one resulted in a small fine. None led to imprisonment. On 27 July 2006, the \"Daily Mail\" repeated its now famous \"Murderers\" front page. In July 2010, Gary Dobson was jailed for five years for possessing and supplying 49 kg of class B drugs with a street value of around £350,000 (approximately US$550,000). At the time of Dobson's sentencing for drug dealing, \"The Independent\" described the Lawrence killing – despite it having happened more than 17 years previously – as \"one of the highest-profile unsolved racially motivated murders\".\n\nIn June 2006, a cold case review commenced, involving a full re-examination of the forensic evidence. Initially this was held in secrecy and not publicised; however, in November 2007, police confirmed they were investigating new scientific evidence.\n\nThe most important of the new evidence comprised:\n\n\nThe police unit manager involved in the matter commented that the new evidence was only found because of scientific developments and developments in forensic approaches that had taken place since 1996 which allowed microscopic blood stains and hair fragments to be analysed for DNA and other microscopic evidence to be found and used forensically.\n\nGary Dobson and David Norris were arrested and charged without publicity on 8 September 2010 and on 23 October 2010 the Director of Public Prosecutions, Keir Starmer QC, applied to the Court of Appeal for Dobson's original acquittal to be quashed. Dobson was in prison at the time for drug dealing. Norris had not been previously acquitted, so no application was necessary in his case. For legal reasons – to protect the investigation and ensure a fair hearing – reporting restrictions were put in place at the commencement of these proceedings; the arrests and subsequent developments were not publicly reported at the time.\n\nDobson's acquittal was quashed following a two-day hearing on 11 and 12 April 2011, enabling his retrial. On 18 May 2011, the Court of Appeal handed down its judgment and the reporting restrictions were partially lifted. It was announced by the Crown Prosecution Service that the two would face trial for Lawrence's murder in light of \"new and substantial evidence\". The judgment of the court stated that \"[i]f reliable, the new scientific evidence would place Dobson in very close proximity indeed to Stephen Lawrence at the moment of and in the immediate aftermath of the attack, proximity, moreover, for which no innocent explanation can be discerned\". The ruling also emphasised that this was to be \"a new trial of a defendant who, we repeat, is presumed in law to be innocent,\" and suggested a cautious and fact-based reporting style to avoid contempt of court or risk of prejudice to the future trial.\n\nA jury was selected on 14 November 2011, and the trial, presided over by Mr Justice Treacy, began the next day at the Central Criminal Court. With the prosecution led by Mark Ellison QC, the case centred on the new forensic evidence and whether it demonstrated the defendant's involvement in the murder, or was the result of later contamination due to police handling. On 3 January 2012, Dobson and Norris were found guilty of Lawrence's murder. The two were sentenced on 4 January 2012 to detention at Her Majesty's Pleasure, equivalent to a life sentence for an adult, with minimum terms of 15 years and 2 months for Dobson and 14 years and 3 months for Norris. Time spent on remand by Dobson was not deducted from his minimum term to ensure his existing sentence for drug-related offences was served. The judge's sentencing remarks were later published in full online.\n\nThe judge stated that the sentences reflected the fact that Dobson and Norris were juveniles (Dobson 17, and Norris 16) at the time of the offence, which took place before the Criminal Justice Act 2003; the starting point for the minimum term was therefore 12 years. The judge acknowledged this was \"lower than some might expect\". A similar crime committed in 2011 as an adult would have justified a minimum sentence of 30 years. (This is occasionally misreported as 25 years, the starting point for \"bringing and using a weapon\"; murder with racial motive incurs a higher 30-year starting point.)\n\nFollowing the 2012 convictions, Paul Dacre, \"Daily Mail\" editor since 1992, issued a comment on his 1997 headline decision.\n\nOthers have argued that, in writing the above, Dacre was overselling his involvement in what had finally been achieved. For instance, an article in the February 2012 edition of the \"Socialist Review\" stated:\n\nOn 5 January 2012, it was reported that the Attorney General was reviewing the minimum terms at the request of a member of the public, to determine whether he believed them to be \"unduly lenient\", and if so whether to apply to the Court of Appeal for an increase in the minimum terms. Juvenile minimum life sentences in a 2000 review (i.e. before the 2003 act passed into law) varied from a \"most common\" minimum of 10 years to a maximum of 20, placing Dobson and Norris in the middle of that range. On 1 February 2012, the Attorney General announced that he would not be referring the sentences to the Court of Appeal, as he believed that \"the minimum terms [were] ... within the appropriate range of sentences\".\n\nOn 30 January 2012, it emerged that Norris and Dobson were seeking leave from the Court of Appeal to appeal against their convictions.\n\nOn 23 August 2012, it was reported that Norris and Dobson had lost the first round of their appeal. On 15 March 2013, it was announced that Gary Dobson had dropped his appeal against his murder conviction.\n\nOn 31 July 1997, the Home Secretary Jack Straw ordered a public inquiry, to be conducted by Sir William Macpherson and officially titled \"The Inquiry Into The Matters Arising From The Death of Stephen Lawrence\". Its report, produced in February 1999, estimated that it had taken \"more than 100,000 pages of reports, statements, and other written or printed documents\" and concluded that the original Metropolitan Police Service investigation had been incompetent and that officers had committed fundamental errors, including: failing to give first aid when they reached the scene; failing to follow obvious leads during their investigation; and failing to arrest suspects. The report found that there had been a failure of leadership by senior MPS officers and that recommendations of the 1981 Scarman Report, compiled following race-related riots in Brixton and Toxteth, had been ignored.\n\nDetective Superintendent Brian Weeden said during the inquiry that mistakes had been made in the murder investigation, including his own ignorance that he could have arrested the suspects four days after the killing simply on reasonable suspicion, a basic point of criminal law.\n\nThe report also found that the Metropolitan Police was institutionally racist. A total of 70 recommendations for reform, covering both policing and criminal law, were made. These proposals included abolishing the double jeopardy rule and criminalising racist statements made in private. Macpherson also called for reform in the British Civil Service, local governments, the National Health Service, schools, and the judicial system, to address issues of institutional racism.\n\nThe report was criticised at the time by Michael Gove (later Secretary of State for Education and Lord Chancellor) in \"The Times\", who said, \"The tendentious reasoning and illiberal recommendations of that document have been brilliantly anatomised by the ethical socialists Norman Dennis and George Erdos and the Kurdish academic Ahmed al-Shahi in the Civitas pamphlet \"Racist Murder and Pressure Group Politics\".\"\n\nIn 1997, Lawrence's family registered a formal complaint with the Police Complaints Authority (PCA), which in 1999 exonerated the officers who had worked on the case of allegations of racism. Only one officer, Detective Inspector Ben Bullock, was ordered to face disciplinary charges for neglect of duty. Bullock, who was second in command of the investigation, was later found guilty of failure to properly brief officers and failure to fully investigate an anonymous letter sent to police, but he was acquitted of 11 other charges. Four other officers who would have been charged as a result of the inquiry retired before it concluded.\n\nBullock retired the day after his punishment was announced, so that it amounted to a mere caution. Neville Lawrence, Stephen's father, criticised the punishment, saying that Bullock was \"guilty on all counts.\" However, a spokesperson for the Metropolitan Police Federation stated that Bullock had been \"largely vindicated\" in the proceedings.\n\nOn 10 March 2006, the Metropolitan Police Service announced that it would pay Duwayne Brooks £100,000 as compensation for the manner in which police had handled his complaints about their actions toward him after the murder.\n\nOn 25 July 2006, the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) announced that it had asked the Metropolitan Police to look into alleged claims of police corruption that may have helped hide the killers of Lawrence.\n\nA BBC investigation alleged that the murder inquiry's Det. Sgt. John Davidson had taken money from known drug smuggler Clifford Norris, the father of David Norris, a chief suspect in the investigation. Neil Putnam, a former corrupt police detective turned whistleblower, told a BBC investigation that Clifford Norris was paying Davidson to obstruct the case and to protect the suspects. \"Davidson told me that he was looking after Norris and that to me meant that he was protecting him, protecting his family against arrest and any conviction,\" Putnam said. Davidson denied any such corruption.\n\nThe Metropolitan Police Service announced that it was to open up a special incident room to field calls from the public, following the BBC documentary \"The Boys Who Killed Stephen Lawrence\". The Independent Police Complaints Commission later stated that the claims made in the programme were unfounded.\nOn 17 December 2009, Independent Police Complaints Commission investigators and officers from the Metropolitan Police's directorate of professional standards arrested a former police constable and a serving member of Metropolitan Police staff on suspicion of attempting to pervert the course of justice by allegedly withholding evidence from the original murder inquiry, the Kent investigation and the Macpherson inquiry. Dr Richard Stone, who sat on the Macpherson inquiry, commented that the panel had felt that there was \"a large amount of information that the police were either not processing or were suppressing\" and \"a strong smell of corruption\". Baroness Ros Howells, patron of the Stephen Lawrence Charitable Trust, agreed: \"Lots of people said they gave the police evidence which was never produced.\" On 1 March 2010 the IPCC announced that \"No further action will be taken against the two men arrested following concerns identified by the internal Metropolitan police service (MPS) review of the murder of Stephen Lawrence\" and the two were released from bail.\n\nOn 23 June 2013, an interview with Peter Francis, a former under-cover police officer, was published in \"The Guardian\". In the interview Francis disclosed that while he was working undercover within an anti-racist campaign group in the mid-1990s, he was constantly pressured by superiors to \"smear\" the credibilities of the family of Lawrence so as to put an end to campaigns for a better investigation into Lawrence's death. After the revelation, Theresa May, the UK's home secretary pledged to be \"ruthless about purging corruption from the police\", and Prime Minister David Cameron ordered Police to investigate the allegations, saying of them that he was \"deeply worried about the reports\". Chief Constable Mick Creedon, who is leading Operation Herne, an ongoing inquiry into Metropolitan police undercover operations against protest groups, said he would investigate the allegations as part of the inquiry. In October 2015 an inquiry was set up by the National Crime Agency to investigate allegations that members of the police force shielded the alleged killers.\n\nFollowing the 2012 convictions, further inquiries by both Scotland Yard and the Independent Police Complaints Commission ruled that there was no new evidence to warrant further investigation. After discussions with Doreen Lawrence, Home Secretary Theresa May commissioned Mark Ellison QC to review Scotland Yard's investigations into alleged police corruption.\n\nThe report, titled \"The Stephen Lawrence Independent Review\", was presented to Parliament on 6 March 2014. Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe, Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police said the report, which prompted an inquiry into undercover policing, was \"devastating\". Ellison's report also showed that there was substantial evidence linking an alleged corrupt police officer with involvement in the murder of private investigator Daniel Morgan.\n\nAn annual architectural award, the Stephen Lawrence Prize, was established by the Marco Goldschmied Foundation in association with the Royal Institute of British Architects in Lawrence's memory.\n\nHis mother, Doreen Lawrence, said, \"I would like Stephen to be remembered as a young man who had a future. He was well loved, and had he been given the chance to survive maybe he would have been the one to bridge the gap between black and white because he didn't distinguish between black or white. He saw people as people.\"\n\nIn 1995 a memorial plaque was set into the pavement at the spot where he was killed on Well Hall Road. The plaque has been vandalised several times since then.\n\nIn 1999, Nicolas Kent designed a documentary play based on the trial, called \"The Colour of Justice\". It was staged at the Tricycle Theatre and was later filmed by the BBC. It was also performed at the Guildford School of Acting for the 20th anniversary of the murder.\n\nOn 7 February 2008, the Stephen Lawrence Centre, designed by architect David Adjaye, opened in Deptford, south-east London. A week later, it was vandalised in an attack that was initially believed to be racially motivated. However, doubt was cast on that assumption when CCTV evidence appeared to show one of the suspects to be mixed-race.\n\nThe Stephen Lawrence Charitable Trust is a national educational charity committed to the advancement of social justice. The Trust provides educational and employability workshops and mentoring schemes. It also awards architectural and landscape bursaries. In 2008 the Trust, with architects RMJM, created the initiative Architecture for Everyone to help promote architecture and the creative industries to young people from ethnic minorities.\n\nIn October 2012, Doreen Lawrence received a Lifetime Achievement Award at the 14th Pride of Britain Awards.\n\nDoreen Lawrence was elevated to the peerage as a Baroness on 6 September 2013, and is formally styled \"Baroness Lawrence of Clarendon, of Clarendon in the Commonwealth Realm of Jamaica\"; the honour is rare for being designated after a location in a Commonwealth realm outside the United Kingdom. She sits on the Labour benches in the House of Lords as a working peer specialising in race and diversity.\n\nOn 23 April 2018, at a memorial service to mark the 25th anniversary of his death, Prime Minister Theresa May announced that \"Stephen Lawrence Day\" would be an annual national commemoration of his death on 22 April every year starting in 2019. Stephen's mother Doreen Lawrence made a statement that Stephen Lawrence Day would be \"an opportunity for young people to use their voices and should be embedded in our education and wider system regardless of the government of the day\".\n\n\"Daily Mail\" journalist Stephen Wright has written about the Lawrence case, both before and subsequent to the prosecution. He was awarded a Special Campaign Award as part of the 2012 Paul Foot Award for his work in the Lawrence case.\n\nNovelist Deborah Crombie uses the turmoil following the Stephen Lawrence murder as a flashback setting in her 2017 book, \"The Garden of Lamentations\". The story includes police officers who were undercover on both sides of the protests, as well as widespread corruption for years afterward. Crombie includes an explanation of the murder in her Author's Note at the end of the book, but specifies that the rest of the characters are not meant to represent actual people.\n\n\n"}

It assists coroners, their staff, public sector agencies, researchers and other agencies in obtaining coronial data to inform death and injury prevention activities.\n\nThe NCIS was the first national database for coronial information in the world. It was established in Australia following recognition by coroners that their mandate for public health and safety could be improved if they could share coronial data across borders to identify previous similar deaths. Prior to the establishment of the NCIS there was no systematic national data storage system for Australia’s eight coronial jurisdictions and the NCIS is considered an invaluable tool to facilitate public health knowledge and research, hence strengthening the coroner's role\n\nIn September 1997, the Australian Coroners' Society endorsed a business plan for the development and management of the NCIS by a consortium called the Monash University National Centre for Coronial Information (MUNCCI). The consortium was made up of the Victorian Institute of Forensic Medicine (a statutory agency of the Victorian Department of Justice and Regulation, which also hosts the Department of Forensic Medicine at Monash University), Monash University’s Department of Epidemiology and Preventive Medicine, and the Monash University Accident Research Centre.\n\nThe NCIS was launched in 2000, as the National Coroners information System, with the objective to securely share case information beyond state and territory borders for the purpose of coronial investigation and death prevention.\n\nThe NCIS was managed by MUNCCI until 2004. The Victorian Institute of Forensic Medicine subsequently managed the system from 2004-2012. Since 2012, the NCIS has been part of the Victorian Department of Justice and Regulation through the Service, Strategy and Reform Division\n\nThe NCIS collects demographic, contextual and circumstantial information on every reportable death in Australia and New Zealand, as well as legal, medical and scientific reports such as the coroner's finding, post mortem report, toxicology report and police summary of death reports. Supplementary data is provided by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) and the New Zealand Ministry of Health. All deaths occurring in Australia and New Zealand are coded in accordance with the World Health Organisation (WHO) International Classification of Death – Tenth Revision (ICD-10) codes.\n\nThe NCIS provides information to agencies responsible for developing community health and safety strategies to reduce the incidence of preventable death and injury in Australia and New Zealand.\n\nThe NCIS database is available by application only to approved users, including death investigators (coroners, coronial death investigators, forensic pathologists and police assisting a coroner) and ethically approved third party researchers. Access for Australian and New Zealand death investigators provides them with the ability to review previous coronial cases across jurisdictions that may be similar in nature to current investigations, thus ensuring their ability to identify systemic hazards within the community. Access for approved researchers and government agencies enables them to identify the frequency and circumstances surrounding particular types of death for the purposes of research and prevention. \n\nThe NCIS is managed by the Victorian Department of Justice and Regulation and governed by a Board of Management composed of coronial, public health, and rotating jurisdictional representatives from Australian States and Territories and New Zealand.\n\nFunding for the NCIS is provided annually from core funding agencies, including:\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "4440591", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4440591", "title": "Paradox of enrichment", "text": "Paradox of enrichment\n\nThe paradox of enrichment is a term from population ecology coined by Michael Rosenzweig in 1971. He described an effect in six predator–prey models where increasing the food available to the prey caused the predator's population to destabilize. A common example is that if the food supply of a prey such as a rabbit is overabundant, its population will grow unbounded and cause the predator population (such as a lynx) to grow unsustainably large. That may result in a crash in the population of the predators and possibly lead to local eradication or even species extinction.\n\nThe term 'paradox' has been used since then to describe this effect in slightly conflicting ways. The original sense was one of irony; by attempting to increase the carrying capacity in an ecosystem, one could fatally imbalance it. Since then, some authors have used the word to describe the difference between modelled and real predator–prey interactions.\n\nRosenzweig used ordinary differential equation models to simulate the prey population that represented only prey populations. Enrichment was taken to be increasing the prey carrying capacity and showing that the prey population destabilized, usually into a limit cycle. \n\nThe cycling behavior after destabilization was more thoroughly explored in a subsequent paper (May 1972) and discussion (Gilpin and Rozenzweig 1972).\n\nMany studies have been done on the paradox of enrichment since Rosenzweig, and some have shown that the model initially proposed does not hold in all circumstances, as summarised by Roy and Chattopadhyay in 2007, such as these exceptions:\n\n\nThe paradox of enrichment can be accounted for by the bifurcation theory. As the carrying capacity increases, the equilibrium of the dynamical system becomes unstable.\n\nThe bifurcation can be obtained by modifying the Lotka–Volterra equation. First, one assumes that the growth of the prey population is determined by the logistic equation. Then, one assumes that predators have a nonlinear functional response, typically of type II. The saturation in consumption may be caused by the time to handle the prey or satiety effects.\n\nThus, one can write the following (normalized) equations:\n\n\nThe term formula_3 represents the prey's logistic growth, and formula_4 the predator's functional response.\n\nThe prey isoclines (points at which the prey population does not change, \"i.e.\" dx/dt = 0) are easily obtained as formula_5 and formula_6. Likewise, the predator isoclines are obtained as formula_7 and formula_8, where formula_9. The intersections of the isoclines yields three equilibrium states:\n\nThe first equilibrium corresponds to the extinction of both predator and prey, the second one to the extinction of the predator and the third to co-existence.\n\nBy the Hartman–Grobman theorem, one can determine the stability of the steady states by approximating the nonlinear system by a linear system. After differentiating each formula_13 and formula_14 with respect to formula_15 and formula_16 in a neighborhood of formula_17, we get:\n\nIt is possible to find the exact solution of this linear system, but here, the only interest is in the qualitative behavior. If both eigenvalues of the community matrix have negative real part, then by the stable manifold theorem the system converges to a limit point. Since the determinant is equal to the product of the eigenvalues and is positive, both eigenvalues have the same sign. Since the trace is equal to the sum of the eigenvalues, the system is stable if\n\nAt that critical value of the parameter K, the system undergoes a Hopf bifurcation. It comes as counterintuitive (hence the term 'paradox') because increasing the carrying capacity of the ecological system beyond a certain value leads to dynamic instability and extinction of the predator species.\n\nA credible, simple alternative to the Lotka–Volterra predator–prey model and its common prey dependent generalizations is the ratio dependent or Arditi–Ginzburg model. The two are the extremes of the spectrum of predator interference models. According to the authors of the alternative view, the data show that true interactions in nature are so far from the Lotka–Volterra extreme on the interference spectrum that the model can simply be discounted as wrong. They are much closer to the ratio dependent extreme so if a simple model is needed one can use the Arditi–Ginzburg model as the first approximation.\nThe presence of the paradox is strongly dependent on the assumption of the prey dependence of the functional response; because of this the ratio dependent Arditi–Ginzburg model does not have the paradoxical behavior. The authors claim that the paradox is absent in nature (simple laboratory systems may be the exception) is in fact a strong argument for their alternative view of the basic equations.\n\n\n"}

His work has earned him numerous accolades from his peers. He is also an executive producer for the live-action film \"\".\n\nTajiri was born on August 28, 1965, in Tokyo. Tajiri grew up in Machida, Tokyo, which, at the time still maintained a rural atmosphere. As a child, Tajiri enjoyed insect collecting as a hobby, which would be an inspiration for his later video game work. Other children called him \"Dr. Bug\", and he wanted to become an entomologist. As urban areas of Japan spread and more land was paved over, habitats for hunting bugs were lost. Tajiri wanted his games to allow children to have the feeling of catching and collecting creatures as he had. \n\nHe became fascinated with arcade games as a teenager, though his parents thought him a delinquent for this pastime. He particularly enjoyed playing Taito's \"Space Invaders\", which drew him into other video games. His interest eventually evolved into attempting to plan his own games. He took his Famicom apart to see how it worked, and won a contest for a video game idea sponsored by Sega.\n\nBecause of his fascination with video games, Tajiri frequently cut classes and nearly did not graduate high school. This confused and upset his parents, who felt that he was discarding his own future. His father attempted to get him a job at The Tokyo Electric Power Company, but Tajiri declined to take the position. He took make-up classes and eventually earned his high school diploma. Tajiri did not attend university, but instead attended a two-year technical degree program at the Tokyo National College of Technology, where he majored in electronics and computer science.\n\nTajiri wrote and edited a fanzine called \"Game Freak\" from 1981 to 1986, focusing on the arcade game scene. \"Game Freak\" was handwritten and stapled together. It was illustrated by Ken Sugimori. Satoshi created the Game Freak fanzine to help out gamers. It contained tips on winning games, as well as lists of easter eggs in games. The highest number of copies he has sold was over 10,000 which was about a game called Zabius. Nonetheless, Ken Sugimori, who later illustrated the first 151 Pokémon, saw the magazine at a dōjinshi shop, and became involved. As more contributors came to \"Game Freak\", Tajiri began to realize that most games were lacking in quality, and he and Sugimori decided the solution was to make their own games. Tajiri studied the \"Family BASIC\" game programming package, to better grasp the concepts of Famicom game design. He then purchased the requisite hardware for game development. Tajiri and Sugimori evolved the magazine into the video game development company Game Freak in 1989. Soon after, the two pitched their first game, an arcade-style game called \"Quinty\", to Namco, who published the game. Tajiri also wrote as a freelance writer for the magazine \"Famicom Hisshōbon\", later called \"Hippon\", and reviewed arcade games for \"Family Computer Magazine\" and \"Famicom Tsūshin\".\n\nTajiri first conceived the idea of \"Pokémon\" in 1990. The idea came together after he saw a Game Boy and the ability to communicate between Game Boys, and Tajiri decided \"Pokémon\" made the most sense on the handheld console. When he thought about the link cable being able to interact with two Game Boys, he envisioned bugs crawling back and forth, recalling his childhood love of bug collecting. Tajiri pioneered the idea of connectivity between handheld game consoles, by suggesting that Game Boys could use their link cables in order to have friends do more than simply play against each other. This idea of the two systems communicating with was for the players to be able to trade Pokemon with one another.\n\nWhen he first pitched the idea of \"Pokémon\" to Nintendo, they could not quite grasp the concept, but were impressed enough with Tajiri's game design reputation that they decided to explore it. Shigeru Miyamoto began to mentor Tajiri, guiding him during the creation process. \"Pokémon Red\" and \"Blue\" took six years to produce, and nearly bankrupted Game Freak in the process; often, there was barely enough money to pay the employees. Five employees quit, and Tajiri did not take a salary, instead living off of his father's income. Investment from Creatures Inc. allowed Game Freak to complete the games, and in return, Creatures received one-third of the franchise rights.\n\nBetween the approval and completion stages of the project, Tajiri assisted in the design of two \"Mario\" spin-off games for Nintendo: \"Yoshi\" and the Japanese-only release \"Mario & Wario\". He also worked on 1994's \"Pulseman\".\n\nOnce the games were completed, very few media outlets gave it attention, believing the Game Boy was a dead console; a general lack of interest of merchandising convinced Tajiri that Nintendo would reject the games. The \"Pokémon\" games were not expected to do well, but sales steadily increased until the series found itself among Nintendo's top franchises. Rumors of a hidden Pokémon creature named Mew, which could only be obtained by exploiting programming errors, increased interest in the game. Tajiri had included Mew in the game in order to promote trading and interaction between players, but Nintendo was not aware of the creature upon release. The franchise helped Nintendo's waning sales. Tajiri deliberately toned down violence in his games. In this vein, he designed Pokémon creatures to faint rather than die upon their defeat, as he believed it was unhealthy for children to equate the concept of death with losing a game. After the completion and release of \"Red\" and \"Blue\" in Japan, Tajiri later worked on 1997's \"Bushi Seiryūden: Futari no Yūsha\". Tajiri continues to be involved in the more modern \"Pokémon\" titles as well. For Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen, he supervised the process from start to finish and approved all the text. While developing games, Tajiri works irregular hours, often laboring 24 hours at a time and resting 12 hours.\n\nTajiri cites Shigeru Miyamoto as a major influence, thinking of him as a sort of mentor. For this reason, his developmental style closely matches that of Miyamoto. In the \"Pokémon\" anime, the main character is named Satoshi, and his rival is Shigeru.\n\nTajiri drew much of his inspiration from old Japanese shows and anime, including Godzilla and Ultraman . He has stated that if he did not design video games, he would most likely be in the anime field.\n\nIGN named Tajiri one of the top 100 game creators of all time, mainly for his ability to have built \"Pokémon\" into a \"worldwide phenomenon\". Electronic Gaming Monthly credited Tajiri as one of the 10 most influential people who made the modern video game market. Video game magazine \"Edge\" placed Tajiri on their list of the \"Hot 100 Game Developers of 2008\". Tajiri, alongside Tsunekazu Ishihara, received the Special Award from the Computer Entertainment Developers Conference in 2011. \"The Economist\" has described \"Pokémon\" as \"Japan’s most successful export.\"\n\n"}
{"id": "44542830", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=44542830", "title": "Sepp Angerer", "text": "Sepp Angerer\n\nJosef \"Sepp\" Angerer (1899–1961) was a rug merchant and art dealer who acted as an agent for Hermann Göring's private art collection, immediately before and during the Second World War. Art that Angerer dealt with for Göring came from a variety of sources: looted, acquired using threats, bought on the open market, and appropriated from museums.\n\nAngerer was director of Quantmeyer & Eicke, of Kronenstrasse 61, Berlin, importers of rugs, furniture and works of art. In art matters he was second only to Walter Hofer in importance to Göring. Angerer used his international contacts to find art for the Göring collection and arranged the sale of the modern works that Göring did not want, thus raising funds to buy the tapestries and old master works that Göring preferred. Although he had strong Nazi connections, Angerer held no official position within the Nazi state.\n\nThe Nazis regarded any art that did not fit with their ideas of what art should be as Degenerate art. Almost all modern art was regarded as \"degenerate\". It was banned under the regime, seized and placed in special storehouses, and the artists who produced it were subject to sanctions. In 1938, Göring removed 13 paintings from the store of seized \"degenerate art\" at Kopenickerstrasse. Among others, works of Paul Cézanne and Vincent van Gogh that he sold through Angerer. German-born Dutch national Franz Koenig bought Van Gogh's \"Portrait of Dr. Gachet\" (first version, 1890) and \"Daubigny's Garden\" (1890), and Cézanne's \"The Quarry\" (c. 1900). Koenig died in 1941 when he fell under a train at Cologne station. According to Ivan Lindsay, Koenig was killed by the Nazis, so his collection of old master drawings could be taken from him. Of the remaining paintings, one by Edward Munch and one by Paul Signac were sold by Angerer in Sweden and two further Munchs in London. Göring paid compensation to the Städel Museum for the Van Gogh and the Folkwang Museum for the Cézanne but at a fraction of the paintings true worth.\n\nTop Nazis liked to give each other gifts of art. When Göring desired to give Adolf Hitler a gift, he asked Angerer to buy eight Flemish tapestries from Albert Auwercx's series of \"Gothic Myths\", as the Nazis called these allegorical subjects. Göring's own deals could be mixed into such transactions in order to disguise them.\n\nAngerer was asked by Göring to buy six tapestries in Italy for 400,000 Lire. He took a dozen to Göring in Berlin in August 1941 of which Göring bought six. On a trip to Florence, around 1942, Angerer and the local German consul Gerhard Wolf went on a tour of Count Bonacossi's collection. Angerer supposedly told the count, \"What a pity you're not a Jew!\" and drawing a finger across his throat continued \"If you were a Jew, we could do just that! And all the paintings would be ours!\" Forewarned of a German art raid, local collections had already removed their best items and hidden them elsewhere behind false walls. Records had been falsified and the remaining works spaced out to disguise the absences. Enquirers after the Jewish art historian Bernard Berenson's collection were told that he had fled to Portugal with the help of the Vatican and that nothing of importance remained in Florence. In fact, he was still in Italy, awaiting the Allied liberation.\n\nAngerer was interrogated by the Allies in the Autumn of 1945. He was placed under arrest and his home at Berchtesgaden, which he had shared with Fritz Görnnert (Göring's personal assistant), was searched. Thomas Carr Howe Jr., one of the U.S. \"monuments men\" charged with recovering looted art, described what he found there:\n\n\"The house was an unpretentious villa hidden among pine trees high up in the hills above the town. The place was under guard. On the ground floor we examined the contents of a small storeroom. There were several cases bearing Angerer's name and three or four large crates containing Italian furniture. A similar storeroom on the second floor contained a dozen tapestries, a pile of Oriental rugs, a large collection of church vestments and nearly a hundred rare textiles mounted on cardboard. … Concealed beneath the tapestries were ten cases, each one about two feet square and a foot high... On each one was stenciled in Gothic letters: \"Reichsmarschall Hermann Göring.\" They contained a magnificent collection of Oriental weapons.\"\n\nIn 1946, Angerer was placed on the American Office of Strategic Services special counterintelligence Art Looting Investigation Unit's \"red flag\" list of people and organisations that were involved in the art trade under the Nazis. His life after that is unclear.\n\n\n\n"}

The film has been called \"a large-scale achievement in its documentation of futurist and counter-futurist ideas”.\n\nDoug Wolens organized his interviews with the commentators (see list below) by this set of topics, related to the singularity. During each topic or subtopic several commentators provide their viewpoints, some with suggestions on how to get there, others with a skeptical opinion about when it will happen.\n\n\n\nAmerican composer Christopher (“Chrizzy”) Lancaster scored the original soundtrack for the film. The soundtrack was created by the processing of acoustic cello sound through real-time samplers, audio effects and filtering recording his cello and feedback.\n\n\"The Singularity\" had limited theatrical release beginning with the 1400 seat Castro Theatre in San Francisco in September 2013, along with screening at the Brattle Theatre in Cambridge MA, the Smith Rafael Film Center in Marin California, and The Santa Fe Center for Contemporary Arts. The film has also had screenings at Yale University, University of Edinburgh, Arizona State University, NASA, BIL, and others. These screenings featured post-screening discussion with expert panels, and/or question and answer sessions with director Doug Wolens.\nDoug Wolens has pursued an alternative self-distribution strategy for The Singularity, working directly with theatres, museums, educational institutions, as well as with the national and local press, to promote the screenings and iTunes December, 2012 digital release.\n\nStephen Cass of the \"IEEE Spectrum\" called it \"a lively introduction\" that does not cover new ground. Geoff Pevere of \"The Globe and Mail\" wrote that the film, a \"intense, idea-packed account\" of the concept, casts McKibben as the most compelling speaker, as his arguments come across the most human, appealing not only to reason but also feeling. Alex Knapp of \"Forbes\" wrote that it is \"well done and provides a good overview\", though he said he would have liked to have seen more criticism of the basic tenet of exponential technological growth. The interviewees themselves also attracted commentary; Case asked why there were no non-white subjects, and Pevere described them called them \"neo-hippie, unkempt lonhairs\".\n\n"}

These are critical components of a quality management system such as ISO 9000. The words \"verification\" and \"validation\" are sometimes preceded with \"independent\", indicating that the verification and validation is to be performed by a disinterested third party. \"Independent verification and validation\" can be abbreviated as \"IV&V\".\n\nIn practice, as quality management terms, the definitions of verification and validation can be inconsistent. Sometimes they are even used interchangeably.\n\nHowever, the PMBOK guide, a standard adopted by IEEE, defines them as follows in its 4th edition:\n\nVerification is intended to check that a product, service, or system (or portion thereof, or set thereof) meets a set of design specifications. In the development phase, verification procedures involve performing special tests to model or simulate a portion, or the entirety, of a product, service or system, then performing a review or analysis of the modeling results. In the post-development phase, verification procedures involve regularly repeating tests devised specifically to ensure that the product, service, or system continues to meet the initial design requirements, specifications, and regulations as time progresses. It is a process that is used to evaluate whether a product, service, or system complies with regulations, specifications, or conditions imposed at the start of a development phase. Verification can be in development, scale-up, or production. This is often an internal process.\n\nValidation is intended to ensure a product, service, or system (or portion thereof, or set thereof) results in a product, service, or system (or portion thereof, or set thereof) that meets the operational needs of the user. For a new development flow or verification flow, validation procedures may involve modeling either flow and using simulations to predict faults or gaps that might lead to invalid or incomplete verification or development of a product, service, or system (or portion thereof, or set thereof). A set of validation requirements (as defined by the user), specifications, and regulations may then be used as a basis for qualifying a development flow or verification flow for a product, service, or system (or portion thereof, or set thereof). Additional validation procedures also include those that are designed specifically to ensure that modifications made to an existing qualified development flow or verification flow will have the effect of producing a product, service, or system (or portion thereof, or set thereof) that meets the initial design requirements, specifications, and regulations; these validations help to keep the flow qualified. It is a process of establishing evidence that provides a high degree of assurance that a product, service, or system accomplishes its intended requirements. This often involves acceptance of fitness for purpose with end users and other product stakeholders. This is often an external process.\n\nIt is sometimes said that validation can be expressed by the query \"Are you building the right thing?\" and verification by \"Are you building it right?\". \"Building the right thing\" refers back to the user's needs, while \"building it right\" checks that the specifications are correctly implemented by the system. In some contexts, it is required to have written requirements for both as well as formal procedures or protocols for determining compliance.\n\nIt is entirely possible that a product passes when verified but fails when validated. This can happen when, say, a product is built as per the specifications but the specifications themselves fail to address the user's needs.\n\nVerification of machinery and equipment usually consists of design qualification (DQ), installation qualification (IQ), operational qualification (OQ), and performance qualification (PQ). DQ may be performed by a vendor or by the user, by confirming through review and testing that the equipment meets the written acquisition specification. If the relevant document or manuals of machinery/equipment are provided by vendors, the later 3Q needs to be thoroughly performed by the users who work in an industrial regulatory environment. Otherwise, the process of IQ, OQ and PQ is the task of validation. The typical example of such a case could be the loss or absence of vendor's documentation for legacy equipment or do-it-yourself (DIY) assemblies (e.g., cars, computers etc.) and, therefore, users should endeavour to acquire DQ document beforehand. Each template of DQ, IQ, OQ and PQ usually can be found on the internet respectively, whereas the DIY qualifications of machinery/equipment can be assisted either by the vendor's training course materials and tutorials, or by the published guidance books, such as \"step-by-step\" series if the acquisition of machinery/equipment is not bundled with on- site qualification services. This kind of the DIY approach is also applicable to the qualifications of software, computer operating systems and a manufacturing process. The most important and critical task as the last step of the activity is to generating and archiving machinery/equipment qualification reports for auditing purposes, if regulatory compliances are mandatory.\n\nQualification of machinery/equipment is venue dependent, in particular items that are shock sensitive and require balancing or calibration, and re-qualification needs to be conducted once the objects are relocated. The full scales of some equipment qualifications are even time dependent as consumables are used up (i.e. filters) or springs stretch out, requiring recalibration, and hence re-certification is necessary when a specified due time lapse. Re-qualification of machinery/equipment should also be conducted when replacement of parts, or coupling with another device, or installing a new application software and restructuring of the computer which affects especially the pre-settings, such as on BIOS, registry, disk drive partition table, dynamically-linked (shared) libraries, or an ini file etc., have been necessary. In such a situation, the specifications of the parts/devices/software and restructuring proposals should be appended to the qualification document whether the parts/devices/software are genuine or not. Torres and Hyman have discussed the suitability of non-genuine parts for clinical use and provided guidelines for equipment users to select appropriate substitutes which are capable to avoid adverse effects. In the case when genuine parts/devices/software are demanded by some of regulatory requirements, then re-qualification does not need to be conducted on the non-genuine assemblies. Instead, the asset has to be recycled for non-regulatory purposes.\n\nWhen machinery/equipment qualification is conducted by a standard endorsed third party such as by an ISO standard accredited company for a particular division, the process is called certification. Currently, the coverage of ISO/IEC 15408 certification by an ISO/IEC 27001 accredited organization is limited; the scheme requires a fair amount of efforts to get popularized.\n\nValidation work can generally be categorized by the following functions:\n\nThe most tested attributes in validation tasks may include, but are not limited to\n\n\nThese terms generally apply broadly across industries and institutions. In addition, they may have very specific meanings and requirements for specific products, regulations, and industries. Some examples:\n\n\n\n\n"}

A paperback edition was published in 1991. ISF Publishing, sponsored by The Idries Shah Foundation, published a paperback edition on 2015, followed by the ebook version and audiobook. Both of which can be read and heard online at the ISF official website, here. \n\n\"Wisdom of the Idiots\" is a book of Sufi teaching stories designed to influence the reader using traditional Sufi psychology. Many stories are reminiscences of encounters with Sufis of long ago but experiences highlighted are valuable even from today's perspective. The carefully selected stories contain several levels of meaning and work like psychological mirrors in which the reader may see himself and Reality reflected, and come to understand these better.\n\n'In Idries Shah's \"Wisdom of the Idiots\", the 'idiots' are Sufis, called this because their wisdom penetrates to a depth which renders it inaccessible to the merely intelligent or academically-knowledgeable.'\n\nShortly before he died, Shah stated that his books form a complete course that could fulfill the function he had fulfilled while alive. As such, \"Wisdom of the Idiots\" can be read as part of a whole course of study.\n\nAs part of the corpus of teaching stories/traditional psychology, \"Wisdom of the Idiots\" has grabbed the attention of modern researchers into psychology. Various techniques that modern science has claimed for itself are clearly present in materials provided centuries before. The psychologist Robert Ornstein has researched the psychological nature of human mind and brain and their relationship to thought, realised potential, and the applicability of traditional techniques for today's applications. Arthur Deikman, a clinical professor of psychiatry and pioneer investigator of mystical states from scientific point of view, studied under Shah and wrote extensively on functional approaches to mysticism. \nM.Y. Shawarbi, an authority on Islamic culture, scientist and author, says of this book \"In comparative religion and metaphysics, the release of over five hundred \"teaching stories\" in \"Tales of the Dervishes\", and \"Wisdom of the Idiots\", and several other books was recognized in religious and philosophical journals as elucidating a hitherto very imperfectly known system of teaching.\" \nWealth, volume and entertainment factor of these stories have spurred establishment of many organizations and colleges of story tellers.\n\n\"Wisdom of the Idiots\" has been awarded many prizes, including two gold medals, one for being 'Best Book', in conjunction with UNESCO's World Book Year.\n\n"}
{"id": "43561218", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=43561218", "title": "Word embedding", "text": "Word embedding\n\nWord embedding is the collective name for a set of language modeling and feature learning techniques in natural language processing (NLP) where words or phrases from the vocabulary are mapped to vectors of real numbers. Conceptually it involves a mathematical embedding from a space with one dimension per word to a continuous vector space with a much lower dimension.\n\nMethods to generate this mapping include neural networks, dimensionality reduction on the word co-occurrence matrix, probabilistic models, explainable knowledge base method, and explicit representation in terms of the context in which words appear.\n\nWord and phrase embeddings, when used as the underlying input representation, have been shown to boost the performance in NLP tasks such as syntactic parsing and sentiment analysis.\n\nIn linguistics word embeddings were discussed in the research area of distributional semantics. It aims to quantify and categorize semantic similarities between linguistic items based on their distributional properties in large samples of language data. The underlying idea that \"a word is characterized by the company it keeps\" was popularized by Firth.\n\nThe technique of representing words as vectors has roots in the 1960s with the development of the vector space model for information retrieval. Reducing the number of dimensions using singular value decomposition then led to the introduction of latent semantic analysis in the late 1980s.\nIn 2000 Bengio et al. provided in a series of papers the \"Neural probabilistic language models\" to reduce the high dimensionality of words representations in contexts by \"learning a distributed representation for words\". (Bengio et al, 2003). Word embeddings come in two different styles, one in which words are expressed as vectors of co-occurring words, and another in which words are expressed as vectors of linguistic contexts in which the words occur; these different styles are studied in (Lavelli et al, 2004). Roweis and Saul published in \"Science\" how to use \"locally linear embedding\" (LLE) to discover representations of high dimensional data structures. The area developed gradually and really took off after 2010, partly because important advances had been made since then on the quality of vectors and the training speed of the model.\n\nThere are many branches and many research groups working on word embeddings. In 2013, a team at Google led by Tomas Mikolov created word2vec, a word embedding toolkit which can train vector space models faster than the previous approaches. Most new word embedding techniques rely on a neural network architecture instead of more traditional n-gram models and unsupervised learning.\n\nOne of the main limitations of word embeddings (word vector space models in general) is that possible meanings of a word are conflated into a single representation (a single vector in the semantic space). Sense embeddings are a solution to this problem: individual meanings of words are represented as distinct vectors in the space.\n\nWord embeddings for n-grams in biological sequences (e.g. DNA, RNA, and Proteins) for bioinformatics applications have been proposed by Asgari and Mofrad. Named bio-vectors (BioVec) to refer to biological sequences in general with protein-vectors (ProtVec) for proteins (amino-acid sequences) and gene-vectors (GeneVec) for gene sequences, this representation can be widely used in applications of deep learning in proteomics and genomics. The results presented by Asgari and Mofrad suggest that BioVectors can characterize biological sequences in terms of biochemical and biophysical interpretations of the underlying patterns.\n\nThought vectors are an extension of word embeddings to entire sentences or even documents. Some researchers hope that these can improve the quality of machine translation.\nSoftware for training and using word embeddings includes Tomas Mikolov's Word2vec, Stanford University's GloVe, AllenNLP's Elmo, fastText, Gensim, Indra and Deeplearning4j. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and T-Distributed Stochastic Neighbour Embedding (t-SNE) are both used to reduce the dimensionality of word vector spaces and visualize word embeddings and clusters.\n\nFor instance, the fastText is also used to calculate word embeddings for text corpora in Sketch Engine that are available online.\n"}
