A 26-year-old man and a 17-year-old girl were killed. Three deaths were mentioned in earlier reports of the incident but one has since been discounted.\n\nMost of the injured were minors; six were in serious condition. The city was subject to a \"clampdown\" after the attacks, and several hundred police launched a manhunt to locate the killer(s). In June 2013, Hagai Felician was charged over the murder, but the Police retracted its allegations in March 2014, after revealing its key witness fabricated evidence. \n\nThe shooting sparked widespread condemnation, with one lawmaker calling it the worst attack against the gay community in Israel's history. The location of the attack—at the heart of what is seen as Israel's most liberal city— resulted in protests by the gay community.\n\nAs of 2018, the police had yet to apprehend the shooter.\n\nOn the evening of August 1 at around 23:00, an unknown person with firearms entered the Aguda building in Tel Aviv, opened fire on the crowd attending a \"Youth Get Together\" event, and immediately escaped by foot. Two people were killed, and fifteen were wounded. Police launched a search campaign to find the shooter, and in addition immediately closed most entertainment locations for the gay community that operated during the same time of the shooting for fear of additional shooting.\n\nThe building was frequented by gay teenagers who engaged in social activities and listened to music. The centre was small with one terrace, thus preventing anyone from escaping. Attendees instead hid under a bed and tables as shots were fired. Israeli television said the crime scene was a \"bloodbath\". Five of the injured were treated at Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center, while five were treated at Wolfson Medical Center in Holon.\n\nThe shooter was masked, dressed in black and used a pistol to carry out the attack. It was not believed his motive was related to nationalist terrorism. The city's gay community stated the killer had a homophobic motive, while police criticized them for rushing to make declarations about incitement being the cause. Police were also investigating leads that the attack may have been due to a personal feud.\n\nA manhunt was immediately launched in an attempt to locate the gunman. Roadblocks were set up in the city. Police shut down all other gay clubs and buildings that had homosexual connections near the crime scene immediately after the shooting in case there were further attacks. Hundreds of police officers were conducting street and door-to-door searches in the city.\n\nPolice soon discarded the possibility that the shooting was a terror attack.\n\nPolice in Tel Aviv accompanied a teenaged survivor of the attack to the basement to conduct a reenactment on 3 August 2009.\n\nThe dead were named as 26-year-old Nir Katz from Givatayim and 17-year-old Liz Troubishi from Holon. One 16-year-old victim spoke of his fear that the shooting would cause an effect of enforced outing as parents find out their children are gay for the first time.\n\nFollowing a police investigation lasting nearly four years, three suspects were arrested. Their arrests were announced on 5 June 2013. A gag order was placed on the details of the investigation. The three suspects, all residents of Pardes Katz, a neighborhood in Bnei Brak, ranged in ages from 20 to 40. It was later announced that a prominent activist in the Israeli LGBT community had also been detained for questioning.\n\nThe \"Jerusalem Post\" reported that the shooting was planned by two young men, one of whom believed his teenaged relative had been abused by an activist at the Bar-Noar center. After the shooting, the gunman and his accomplice fled into Tel Aviv. The pistol used by the killer was found by hikers in December 2012 and the suspects were arrested some months later. \n\nOn 11 June, the gag order was officially lifted. According to police, a few months before the killings, one of the suspects, then 15 years old, came to Barnoar struggling with his sexual identity. There he met with a veteran Barnoar figure, the fourth person to be arrested in the case. Hagai Felician, the teenager's relative, became aware that the teen had been seen a few times at Barnoar, and asked him what he was doing there. The teenager confirmed he had been going there, but that he was raped by the senior figure at the club. Felician allegedly decided to take matters into his own hands, and together with another suspect, Tarlan Hankishayev, and the state's witness, plotted to harm the activist. On the day of the shooting, Felician allegedly came to Barnoar looking for the activist. Unable to find him, Felician “lost it” and shot those present. \n\nOn 23 June 2013, charges were dropped against the other two suspects. On 10 July 2013, Hagai Felician was indicted on two counts of murder.\n\nIn February 2014, the prosecution's case against Hagai Felician collapsed after new information was uncovered that suggested that the state witness around whose testimony the case had been built had lied. Subsequently, the witness, who was identified in media reports as \"Z\" due to his identity being under gag order, was arrested on charges of fabricating evidence. On 26 February, Felician was released, although he was remanded to house arrest until 2 April. On 9 March 2014, all charges against Felician were dropped.\n\nOn 24 June 2013, it was cleared for publication that Felician's brother, Yaakov, had been arrested on rape charges, and was suspected of raping a female attorney who had applied to serve as part of Hagai's defense team. Under police interrogation, Yaakov Felician claimed that the attorney had only filed a rape complaint after he did not hire her to serve on his brother's defense team. He was released to house arrest after a polygraph test determined he was being truthful.\n\nThe murderous event was broadly covered by the Israeli media, and was widely condemned by many public figures. President Shimon Peres reacted to the murder, stating that: \"The horrifying murder that was carried out yesterday in Tel Aviv, against teenagers and young people, is a murder that civilized and enlightened people cannot accept. Murder and hatred are the two most serious crimes in society. The police must exert great efforts in order to catch the despicable murderer, and the entire nation must unite in condemning this abominable act.\" Peres called the culprit a \"lowly criminal\" and urged the police to apprehend him quickly. \n\nPrime Minister of Israel Benjamin Netanyahu also condemned the murder at the opening of his Cabinet meeting He expressed his \"shock and dismay\", condemning the \"shocking murder\" and reminding Israeli citizens that \"we are a democratic and tolerant country and we must respect every person as he is\".\n\nNitzan Horowitz, the only openly gay member of the Knesset at the time, condemned it as \"the worst attack ever against the gay community in Israel [...] a blind attack against innocent youths.\n\nThe Shas party said they were \"shocked and bereaved, and denounce without reservation the murderous incident\". Public Security Minister Yitzhak Aharonovich, head of Israel's police force, called it \"a serious and grave incident\". Aharonovitch spoke of going to the crime scene, saying \"it was a difficult sight\".\n\nOpposition leader Tzipi Livni called it a \"grave incident\", saying \"even if all the details surrounding the event are not yet clear, the hatred exists and must be dealt with\". She said it should \"awaken society to rid itself of prejudice\" and \"shake up society, and all the circles inherent in it, including the political establishment and the education system, and on this day deliver an unequivocal message against intolerance, incitement and violence, and to act against any manifestation of these\".\n\nThe Mayor of Tel Aviv, Ron Huldai, said his city would still welcome members of the gay and lesbian community, saying they would fight for their rights to live. Tel Aviv's Head of Police, Shachar Ayalon, did not say the shooting was a hate crime.\n\nOn 8 August, days after the event, Peres came to the crime scene at Bar-Noar to show support for the community and the deadly attack on it.\n\nA protest rally was held in Tel Aviv following the shooting, including lit candles. \n\nA few hours after the event, a demonstration of a few hundred people took place on Rothschild Boulevard in Tel Aviv, and the protesters marched towards Allenby Street, and King George Street until they reached The Municipal Center for the Gay Community, in Meir Park, and on the way chanted \"Inciting homophobes, children's blood is on your hands.\" The next day, at 17:00 pm, an additional demonstration took place on Rothschild Boulevard, and in addition a protest watch was held in Mount Carmel's range, in Haifa City in the north, a known entertainment place as well, and also in Zion Square in Jerusalem and in the government complex in Beer-Sheba.\n\nOn 3 August 2009, more than 150 Jewish and LGBT people held a candlelight vigil in the Dupont Circle neighborhood of Washington, D.C., the capital of the United States. Rabbis and Jewish community leaders representing Orthodox, Conservative, and Reform congregations were among those in attendance. On 3 August 2009, more than 100 people held a memorial service at the San Francisco LGBT Center organized by the LGBT Alliance of the Jewish Community Federation of San Francisco, the Peninsula, Marin & Sonoma Counties and the Jewish Community Federation of the Greater East Bay. Rabbi Camille Shira Angel from Congregation Sha'ar Zahav, Supervisor Bevan Dufty, among others, spoke in condemnation of the violence.\n\nOn 31 August 2009, a cousin of Nir Katz — together with the Vancouver Hillel Foundation — organized a candlelight vigil in honour of the victims at the Vancouver Art Gallery in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. The evening's service drew about 100 people and served as a rally against hate crime. This vigil also served to mark \"Shloshim\", which in the Jewish tradition is a service to mark the end of the 30-day mourning period following the death. A video recording of this vigil can be found on youtube.com under the title \"Vancouver Vigil — In Memory of Nir Katz (1983-2009) Parts 1 through 5\". A separate vigil was held in Toronto. A rally to condemn the shootings was held in Berlin.\n\nA week after the murder, on 8 August, a solidarity rally was held in Rabin Square in Tel Aviv. Twenty thousand demonstrators or more gathered to show solidarity with Israel's gay community, including the victims shot at the center. President Shimon Peres addressed the crowd, saying the shots fired at the gay and lesbian community \"hurt all of us — as people, as Jews, as Israelis.\" Also attending the rally were Minister of Education Gideon Sa'ar, Minister of Culture Limor Livnat, Minister of Welfare & Social Services Isaac Herzog, various Knesset members, and Israeli singers such as Rita, Dana International, Ninet Tayeb, Keren Peles, Ivri Lider and Margalit Tzan'ani. In Jerusalem, members of the LGBT community lit candles at Zion Square in a tribute to the victims at a vigil.\n\n\n"}

He was one of five people to die in the incident, which received international attention and scrutiny, but he was the only journalist killed.\n\nAssaf Abu Rahhal was a native of Kfeir, Hasbaya District, Lebanon. He was married and a father of three. He died in Adaisseh, Lebanon, while reporting for his newspaper, as a result of Israeli military fire. Final services were held at Saint George Roman Orthodox Church in Kfeir for the deceased. The village of Adaisseh commemorated Abu Rahhal's death on the second anniversary of his death.\n\nAbu Rahhal worked for the \"Al Akhbar\" daily newspaper for four years where he was covering southern Lebanon. Before that he was a journalist with \"Al-Mustaqbal\", an Arabic daily newspaper, and he sometimes wrote for \"Shu’un Janoubiah\" magazine.\n\nThe dispute began around noon on 3 August 2010 when Israeli forces began to dig up a tree at the border between Misgav Am, Israel and Adaisseh, Lebanon. The United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon had given the Israelis permission to do the maintenance. The Lebanese claimed the Israelis had crossed border in conducting this work. The Israelis disputed this claim, and the UN Peacekeeping force also dismissed the border crossing claim. Lebanese sniper fire ensued. Both sides agree that the Lebanese issued a verbal warning prior to the shooting and the Israelis stood their ground and claimed they were on Israeli territory. After an Israeli reserve lieutenant colonel was killed and a captain was shot and injured, the Israelis responded to the sniper fire from the Lebanese side of the border. UN forces intervened to bring a halt to the armed conflict. Reporters Without Borders said the Israelis wanted to install a surveillance camera on the site of the tree. This was the first armed incident since 2006 Lebanon War and a violation of the UN Resolution 1701 to prevent further conflict.\n\nIn all, one Israeli officer, three Lebanese soldiers and Lebanese journalist Abu Rahhal were killed in the incident. In addition one Israeli officer was wounded and on the Lebanese side four soldiers were wounded and Lebanese TV reporter Shoaib.\n\nThe killing of Abu Rahhal was condemned by Irina Bokova, who is the director-general of UNESCO: \"I am deeply concerned about the circumstances in which Assaf Abu Rahhal was killed and his colleague Ali Shoaib injured ... I would further underline that freedom of expression, a fundamental human right, implies the possibility of exercising this right in safety. Armed forces are obligated to respect it.\"\n\nLebanon’s Syndicate of Photographers and the Maharat Foundation condemned the attack. The French-based Reporters Without Borders said Abu Rahhal's death was due to an \"Israeli military blunder.\"\n\nAl-Akhbar editor Omar Nashabe said, \"It is totally unacceptable that a civilian, a dedicated journalist, husband and father, be targeted and killed while the international community and UN troops [in southern Lebanon] stand by idly.\" News reports contradict the charge that Abu Rahhal was targeted.\n\nAccording to the New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists, the following Lebanese and Israeli journalists have died along the Israeli-Lebanese border in addition to Assaf Abu Rahhal: Ahmed Haidar of Al-Manar died in 1993; Ilan Roeh of Israeli radio died in 1999. Layal Najib, a freelance photographer, died in the border dispute in 2006. She was the last journalist to have been killed before Abu Rahhal.\n\nThe shooting of Lebanese TV journalist Ali Shabaan by Syrian forces on the Lebanese-Syrian border 9 April 2012 stirred up memories of Abu Rahhal at \"Al-Akhbar\". Shabaan was the next journalist after Abu Rahhal to have been killed near the Lebanese border.\n\n"}
{"id": "409394", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=409394", "title": "Barakah", "text": "Barakah\n\nIn Islam, Barakah or Baraka () is a kind of continuity of spiritual presence and revelation that begins with God and flows through that and those closest to God.\n\nBaraka can be found within physical objects, places, and people, as chosen by God. This force begins by flowing directly from God into creation that is worthy of baraka. These creations endowed with baraka can then transmit the flow of baraka to the other creations of God through physical proximity or through the adherence to the spiritual practices of the Islamic prophet Muhammad. God is the sole source of baraka and has the power to grant and withhold baraka.\n\nBaraka is a prominent concept in Islamic mysticism, particularly Sufism. It pervades Sufi texts, beliefs, practices, and spirituality. Sufism emphasizes the importance of esoteric knowledge and the spiritual union with God through the heart. Baraka symbolizes this connection between the divine and the worldly through God's direct and intentional blessing of those that are most reflective of Him and his teachings.\n\nBaraka is not a state, it is a flow of blessings and grace. It flows from God to those that are closest to God, such as saints and prophets. Those that have received baraka are thought to have the abilities to perform miracles (\"karamat\"), such as thought-reading, healing the sick, flying, and reviving the dead. However, according to Abd al-Karīm ibn Hawāzin Qushayri, a prominent Sufi mystic, the use of these miracles and the actual possession of these abilities are not indicative of a saint's status, however, the performance of these miracles by prophets is important to establish credentials.\n\nThe Qur'an, hadith, saints, prophets, Muhammad and his descendants are all powerful sources of baraka. Through these sources, one may achieve baraka by three methods: (1) visitation of saints and holy shrines charged with baraka, (2) attachment to the chain of spiritual masters through the khirqa, and (3) emulation of the inner Sunnah.\n\nSaints as the source of baraka, can transmit baraka to ordinary men simply through their presence. As this hadith explains, \"By means of the righteous Muslim, God repulses affliction from one hundred neighbors\". In this way, the saints provide a means for ordinary men to connect with the blessings of God through baraka. The physical closeness to a saint's shrine is said to emit baraka, which is why many followers of Islam choose to visit shrines. The ritualistic act of visiting tombs and other holy places, such as shrines, to receive baraka is known as ziyara.\n\nSufis pass esoteric knowledge and baraka from the master sheikh to the aspirant through the passing of the khirqa. The khirqa is the initiatory cloak of the Sufi chain of spirituality. This cloak initiates an aspirant into the silsilah, which is the chain of sheikhs that goes back to Muhammad. This chain serves as the channel through which baraka flows from the source of spiritual revelation to the being of the initiate. There are two kinds of this kind of transmission (tanakkul) of baraka through the khirqa: khirqa-yi irada and khirqa-yi tabarruk. Khirqa-yi irada is characterized by the passing of baraka to the aspirant from the singular sheikh to which he has sworn. Khirqa-yi tabarruk, also known as the \"frock of blessing\", is characterized by the passing of baraka to the worthy aspirant from any sheikh that he has encountered.\n\nThe silsilah chain created from the passing of the khirqa that confirms authenticity of many hadiths is known as the isnad. It was not until the late eleventh and twelfth centuries that the Sufi tradition began accepting this form of isnad as a means to transmit mystical knowledge and blessings.\n\nBy following the practices and teachings of Muhammad, one can achieve baraka through the emulation of Sunnah. Because Muhammad is the source of Muhammadan baraka, by living in constant remembrance of the names of God and in accordance to Muhammad's Sunnah. Those that live the inner Sunnah within the heart, are those that reflect the Light of Muhammad (al-nur al-muhammadi) and the Muhammadan baraka. Those that live according to the Sunnah, live in constant remembrance of God, and live authentically from the heart are those to whom God opens the channel through which baraka can flow. By living in accordance to Muhammad, one can become worthy of God's direct blessing of baraka. If granted baraka, the saintly person is able to feel God's force from within and is nourished by the hadith while being guided by the baraka.\n\nSeeking baraka has been a source of controversy throughout the Islamic world. Through the act of ziyara, saints and the shrines of saints are seen as a means to access the baraka sent from God. Because of this, many within Islam see ziyara as a form of idolatry in the way devotees may look towards the saints instead of towards God, Himself, for baraka. Although ziyara has been a source of great controversy, it remains one of the most typical ritual practices of Islamic spirituality.\n\n\n"}

It was used as a basis for developing the belief–desire–intention software model.\n\nBDI was part of the inspiration behind the BDI software architecture, which Bratman was also involved in developing. Here, the notion of intention was seen as a way of limiting time spent on deliberating about what to do, by eliminating choices inconsistent with current intentions.\n\nBDI has also aroused some interest in psychology. BDI formed the basis for a computational model of childlike reasoning CRIBB. It has been proposed that autistic children do not recognise other people as folk-psychological agents (i.e., agents with their own beliefs, etc.). BDI has been used to develop a rehabilitation strategy to teach autistic children to reason about other people.\n\n"}

The study concluded that while the Australian Cattle Dogs do live almost a year longer than most dogs of other breeds in the same weight class on average, the cases of Bluey and Chilla should be regarded as uncharacteristic exceptions rather than as indicators of common longevity for this entire breed.\n\n\n"}

He was the runner-up at the Pacific South-west Championship in 1928(lost to fellow Frenchman Henri Cochet) although he won the mixed title trophy alongside American Anne Harper. The same year he won his first outdoor doubles title in Düsseldorf pairing Davis Cup teammate Jean Borotra. He won his first singles championships in 1929. He was on the victorious French team at the Davis Cup four times, in 1929, 1930, 1931, and 1932, although he never played. The members of the team became known as the \"Four Musketeers\" and Boussus was the \"Fifth Musketeer\". He finally got his chance to play at the Davis cup in 1934, when the Four Musketeers had retired. During World War II in 1941 in Vichy France he won the unofficial French Open doubles title partnering Bernard Destremau, a feat that is unrecognized by the ITF. The same year he starred in a movie called \"L'Appel du stade\". After the war he became the captain of the French Davis Cup Team between 1949–1952 and vice-captain from 1953. In the very first year of his leadership France reached the final of the 1949 Davis Cup for the first time in 15 years. In club level team competitions he represented Racing Club de France of Paris.\nBoussus was defeated in the finals of the 1931 French Championships by Jean Borotra. In 1932, he and Marcel Bernard were defeated in the doubles finals of the French Championships by Henri Cochet and Jacques Brugnon. He played twice the Australian Championships, in 1928 and 1935, and won the mixed doubles that year, his only Grand Slam title. He competed in the French Championships nineteen times between 1927 and 1953, which is the third most appearances in history right after Fabrice Santoro (20) and Francois Jauffret (20). Boussus twice won the German Championships in Hamburg (1930, 1931) and the British Hard Court Championships on one occasion (1931). He was ranked number one French tennis player four times in a row in the consecutive years of 1934, 1935, 1936 and 1937.\n\nBoussus was ranked World No. 9 in 1930 and 1935 by A. Wallis Myers of The Daily Telegraph, and the European No. 6 in 1931 (the latter by \"Züricher Sport\" newspaper).\n\nAt the peak of his career in 1932 his play was observed by Great Britain's then active Davis Cup player Nigel Sharpe who described him as the greatest French left-hander in the following manner: \"He relies upon an all-round game with volleying as his forte. There is nothing of hurricane speed in his game. He takes the ball on the rise and hist his forehand with an easy swing and without much topspin. He gets good pace in this stroke and usually relies upon it as the forerunner of a volleying campaign[…]His backhand is of the cut variety but although putting so much slice on it he does not let it stop him from hitting it pretty hard. This stroke, of course, has its limitations, as it is distinctly difficult to make good passing shots against an agile volleyer. This wing is Boussus' chief weakness[…] (he) is able to make his volley down the line with great speed[..]but does not use his wrist quite so much\". He further analysed his service game and found it be most unorthodox. Boussus completely omitted to swing his racquet behind his head while serving making his serves rather ineffective. Although this style was useful in overhead smashes when accuracy is more important than the speed. With this type of serve he also put a great spin to the ball and kept it relatively low. Later in his career he adapted to baseline play and utilized a series of dropshots in his games.\n\nIn his student ages he studied advertising. His 1930 season was interrupted because he had to fulfill his military service. While playing amateur tennis he worked as a tire salesman in the mean time. Later he was appointed the Director of Communications for IBM France. Apart from his tennis playing style he is known as the first man to wear shorts instead of pants on court. He was in a civil partnership with French parfume designer Germaine Cellier with whom he lived together for 30 years until she died in 1976. He died at the age of 95, the last surviving Musketeer. He had a brother Roland, also amateur tennis player, with whom he won the doubles title of the Le Touquet Spa Championships in 1937, while also winning the singles and mixed contest as well.\n\n"}
{"id": "3271651", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3271651", "title": "Cities for Life Day", "text": "Cities for Life Day\n\nCities for Life Day is a worldwide festivity that supports the abolition of the death penalty. It is celebrated on November 30 of each year.\n\nCesare Beccaria was one of the greatest Italian Enlightenment writers, who was noted for his masterpiece \"Of Crimes and Punishments\" (1764), which was later translated into 22 languages. In it, Beccaria put forth some of the first modern arguments against the death penalty. His treatise was also the first full work of penology, advocating reform of the criminal law system. The book was the first full-scale work to tackle criminal reform and to suggest that criminal justice should conform to rational principles.\n\nAs a consequence in Italy the first pre-unitarian state to abolish the death penalty was the Grand Duchy of Tuscany as of November 30, 1786, under the reign of Pietro Leopoldo, later Holy Roman Emperor Leopold II. So Tuscany was the first civil state in the world to do away with torture and capital punishment.\n\nSince then in the last two centuries the refusal of death penalty has been increasing all around the world:\n\n\"In 2012, 141 states have abolished either by law or on a de facto basis the death penalty, while it is still on the books in 51 countries. Since 2007, the United Nations General Assembly has repeatedly called for a universal moratorium with a view toward total abolition of capital punishment. In 2011 progress was made in all regions of the world, particularly the United States: Illinois became abolitionist and in April 2012 Connecticut became the 17th state to abolish the death penalty, thus becoming the fifth American state to revoke capital punishment in the last five years.\"\n\nOn the \"Cities for Life Day\", November 30, many important cities around the world celebrate the first abolition of the death penalty by a European state, decreed by Leopold II, Holy Roman Emperor of Habsburg-Lorraine in 1786 for his Grand Duchy of Tuscany. On this occasion the participating cities show their commitment for life and against the death penalty.\n\nOn this day, participating cities illuminate a symbolic monument, such as the Atomium in Brussels, the Colosseum in Rome and the Plaza de Santa Ana in Madrid. Participating cities in 2009 include more than 60 capitals worldwide, and over 1,200 cities and towns around the world, such as Rome, Brussels, Madrid, Ottawa, Mexico City, Berlin, Barcelona, Florence, Venice, Buenos Aires, Austin, Dallas, Antwerp, Vienna, Naples, Paris, Copenhagen, Stockholm, Reggio Emilia, Bogotá, Santiago de Chile.\n\nBy this symbolic action, these cities demand a stay of all executions worldwide.

{"id": "714030", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=714030", "title": "Dybbuk", "text": "Dybbuk\n\nIn Jewish mythology, a dybbuk (, from the Hebrew verb \"dāḇaq\" meaning \"adhere\" or \"cling\") is a malicious possessing spirit believed to be the dislocated soul of a dead person. It supposedly leaves the host body once it has accomplished its goal, sometimes after being helped.\n\n\"Dybbuk\" is an abbreviation of \"dibbūq mē-rūaḥ rā‘ā\" (\"a cleavage of an evil spirit\"), or \"dibbūq min ha-ḥīṣōnīm\" (\"dibbuk from the outside\"), which is found in man. \"Dybbuk\" comes from the Hebrew word \"dibbūq\" which means \"the act of sticking\" and is a nominal form derived from the verb \"dāḇaq\" \"to adhere\" or \"cling\".\n\nThe term first appears in a number of 16th century writings, though it was ignored by mainstream scholarship until S. Ansky's play \"The Dybbuk\" popularised the concept in literary circles. Earlier accounts of possession (such as that given by Josephus) were of demonic possession rather than that by ghosts. These accounts advocated orthodoxy among the populace as a preventative measure. For example, it was suggested that a sloppily made mezuzah or entertaining doubt about Moses' crossing of the Red Sea opened one's household to dybbuk possession. Very precise details of names and locations have been included in accounts of dybbuk possession. Rabbi Yoel Teitelbaum, the Satmar rebbe (1887–1979) is reported to have supposedly advised an individual said to be possessed to consult a psychiatrist.\n\nAnsky's play is a significant work of Yiddish theatre, and has been adapted a number of times by writers, composers and other creators including Jerome Robbins/Leonard Bernstein and Tony Kushner. In the play, a young bride is possessed by the ghost of the man she was meant to marry, had her father not broken a marriage agreement.\n\nThere are other forms of soul transmigration in Jewish mythology. In contrast to the dybbuk, the ibbur (meaning \"impregnation\") is a positive possession, which happens when a righteous soul temporarily possesses a body. This is always done with consent, so that the soul can perform a mitzvah. The gilgul (, literally \"rolling\") puts forth the idea that a soul must live through many lives before it gains the wisdom to rejoin with God.\n\nIn psychological literature the Dybbuk has been described as an hysterical syndrome.\n\nThe Malayalam movie \"Ezra\" (2017) revolves around a Dybbuk box, with references to Kabbalist traditions and occultism.\n\nMichał Waszyński's 1937 film \"The Dybbuk\", based on the Yiddish play by S. Ansky, is considered one of the classics of Yiddish film-making.\n\nThe dybbuk was featured as the main antagonist in the horror films \"The Unborn\" (2009) and \"The Possession\" (2012).\n\nIn \"Love and Death\", Woody Allen's 1975 satire of Russian literature, Boris (Allen) flirts with Sonja (Diane Keaton), who is with the fish monger she is set to marry. The fiancée keeps getting in the way of Boris' advances, which leads him to ask Sonja, \"Did you have to bring the dybbuk?\"\n\n\"A Serious Man\" opens with a story about a couple who suspect that the rabbi they're hosting for dinner is a dybbuk.\n\nMarcin Wrona's \"Demon\" is the story of a groom possessed by a dybbuk the night before his wedding.\n\nIn the Christopher Guest 1997 movie \"Waiting for Guffman\", dentist Allan Pearl discusses his family history with show business: \"I think I got a, a, an entertaining bug... from my grandfather... uh, Chaim Pearlgut, who was very very big in the, um, Yiddish, uh, theater, back in New York. He was in the, the very... the sardonically irreverent... \"Dybbuk Shmybbuk, I Said 'More Ham'\" ... and that revue I believe was 1914, and that revue was what made him famous. Incidentally, the song \"Bubbe Made A Kishke\" came from that revue.\"\n\nIn Romain Gary's 1967 novel \"The Dance of Genghis Cohn\", a concentration camp warden is haunted by the dybbuk of one of his victims.\n\nIn Ellen Galford's 1993 novel \"The Dyke and the Dybbuk\", lesbian taxi-driver Rainbow Rosenbloom is haunted by, and gets the better of, a female dybbuk haunting her as a result of a curse placed on her ancestor 200 years ago.\n\nThe dybbuk appears in the fictional novel, \"The Inquisitor's Apprentice\" (2011) by Chris Moriarty.\n\nIn the comic series \"Girl Genius\", the forcible insertion of the mind of Agatha's mother, the main villain Lucrezia Mongfish/\"The Other\", into her own was compared to a dybbuk by one of her followers when reporting the situation to someone else.\n\nRichard Zimler's 2011 novel \"The Warsaw Anagrams\" is narrated by a dybbuk desperately trying to understand why he has remained in our world. This is in keeping with kabbalistic belief that dybbuks fail to pass over to the Other Side because of a mitzvah or duty that they have failed to fulfill.\n\nThe Dybbuk is mentioned in the paranormal TV show \"Paranormal Witness\", season 2, episode 4 \"The Dybbuk Box\".\n\nThe \"Dybbuk Box\" was shown on the first episode of \"Deadly Possessions\" (spin off of Ghost Adventures). In which the son of the relative of a holocaust survivor accounts the tale of the Dybbuks' attachment to the deaths relating around the box.\n\nIn the TV show \"Difficult People\", season 3, episode 3 \"Code Change\", Billy helps his sister-in-law Rucchel exorcise what she perceives to be a Dybbuk from her basement.\n\nIn the episode of \"The Real Ghostbusters\", \"Drool, the Dog-faced Goblin,\" the Ghostbusters discuss with Peter Venkman the many different forms an antagonistic ghost they are facing can take, with Egon Spengler mentioning a dybbuk. Peter asks Egon what a dybbuk is with Egon replying it's best if he didn't know. In a later episode titled \"The Devil to Pay,\" the Ghostbusters deal with a demon named Dib Devlin who swindles Ray Stanz and Winston Zeddemore into selling their souls to compete in his game show. Dib Devlin is later revealed to be a dybbuk.\n\nGrandpa Boris tells a scary story to the babies involving a Dybbuk in an early episode of \"Rugrats\".\n\n\n\n"}

As part of a \"Race War\", the player controls a neo-Nazi skinhead or a Klansman and is tasked with killing stereotypical African-American, Mexican, and Jewish enemies, ending with then-Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon.\n\nUsing the Genesis3D engine, the National Alliance created the game to be provocative and to support their white supremacist message. The game has been controversial, with the Anti-Defamation League taking particular issue; it has been ranked several times as one of the most controversial games ever created. It was planned to be followed by a long line of sequels, but only one, titled \"White Law\", has been released.\n\n\"Ethnic Cleansing\" is a standard, short-length first-person shooter set in a single level. The player can select a neo-Nazi, a Skinhead, or a Klansman to control. They run through a ghetto that has been compared to New York City and shoot African-Americans and Mexicans, before descending into a subway system to kill Jews. Finally, the player reaches the \"Yiddish Control Center\", where a fictionalized version of Ariel Sharon, then Prime Minister of Israel, is directing plans for world domination. He carries a rocket launcher; the player must kill him to complete the game. The heads-up display contains a map of nearby enemies and a counter of remaining ammunition.\n\nThe game's soundtrack consists of white power rock music. The game's art assets and sound effects feature racial stereotypes: when shot, black enemies make monkey noises and Jewish enemies are dressed as rabbis and shout \"oy vey!\". Mexican characters shout \"I need to take a siesta now\". In addition, black enemies are drawn to resemble apes and some wear T-shirts with the lettering \"NIGZ\", while Mexican enemies wear sombreros.\n\n\"Ethnic Cleansing\" was developed by members of the National Alliance, an American white supremacist organization, and published by Resistance Records, its subsidiary record label that specializes in white power music. It was developed for Microsoft Windows personal computers using Eclipse Entertainment's open-source game engine Genesis3D along with the Reality Factory development kit. The source code was not substantially changed from the original. Instead, the developers simply plugged in images and sounds that they had created in freely available editing programs.\n\nShaun Walker, the chairman of the National Alliance, explained to the United Press that the intent was to produce a racially provocative video game and promote racial segregation. National Alliance founder William Luther Pierce, who also appears in the game to discuss an \"upcoming white revolution\", considered video games to be simply another medium to promote his organization's messages. Resistance released the game on Martin Luther King, Jr. Day (January 21) of 2002. It was priced at USD $14.88, a reference to the white supremacist Fourteen Words slogan and the neo-Nazi numerical code \"88\" (which stands for \"HH\" or \"Heil Hitler\").\n\nWhile it received little attention from the mainstream media, the game was immediately controversial among Americans on both sides of the political spectrum. The Anti-Defamation League, an anti-racist organization that especially covers anti-Semitism, publicized the existence of the game and unsuccessfully lobbied the developers of Genesis3D to change their licensing conditions to prohibit the use of the engine to develop racist games. They lobbied the Interactive Digital Software Association to encourage its members to adopt such policies.\n\nThe game's reception from critics was extremely negative. David Leonard of PopMatters described the game's graphics and \"playability\". While not approving of the game's message, he argued that it was only the latest in a long line of racist video games that included the likes of \"Grand Theft Auto III\", \"NFL Street\", and \"Freedom Fighters\". In January 2003, \"Stuff\" named \"Ethnic Cleansing\" the 40th most controversial video game of all time. The staff opined that only \"very stupid children\" would be susceptible to its message and that it would make players feel like \"small-minded assholes\". \"Complex\" and \"UGO\" ranked it as the single most racist video game in history. \"UGO\" staff writer K. Thor Jensen called it \"profoundly stupid\".\n\nPierce estimated that \"a couple thousand\" copies of the game had been sold within a month of its release and that 90 percent of consumers had been white teenage boys.\n\nThe National Alliance and Resistance Records released a similar game, \"White Law\", in June 2003. It starred an Irish-American police officer taking up arms to protect his territory from racial minorities. It has been compared to \"Freedom Fighters\", though it was based on the events of Pierce's novel \"The Turner Diaries\". The National Alliance intended to create an entire line of racist games, but no more have surfaced.\n\n"}

From 2009 to 2013, violence linked to the Boko Haram insurgency resulted in 3,600 deaths, including 1,600 civilians. In mid-May 2013, the federal government declared a state of emergency in Adamawa, Borno, and Yobe States, as it aimed to end the Boko Haram insurgency.\nThe resulting crackdown has led to the capture or killing of hundreds of Boko Haram members, with the remainder retreating to mountainous areas from which they have increasingly targeted civilians.\n\nSince 2010, Boko Haram has targeted schools, killing hundreds of students. A spokesperson said such attacks would continue as long as government continued to interfere with traditional Koran-based education. More than 10,000 children are no longer able to attend school due to attacks by the Boko Haram. Roughly 20,000 people fled Yobe State to Cameroon during June 2013 to escape the violence.\n\nGunmen from Boko Haram entered the college at 1 a.m. local time and opened fire on the students while they were asleep. Only the male sleeping quarters were targeted. Forty-two bodies were recovered by Nigerian soldiers while eighteen injured were transported to Damaturu Specialist Hospital. Two of the wounded later died.\n\nAccording to one survivor, the attackers drove into the college in two double-cabin pickup all-terrain vehicles. Some were wearing Nigerian military uniforms. A survivor said that nearly all of those killed were Muslims, as is the majority of the student body. This attack followed a 6 July 2013 attack at Mamudo outside Damaturu that killed 29 students and a teacher, some by burning alive, which left many schools in the area closed, and other attacks in the week following killed 30 more civilians. Boko Haram's name means \"Western education is sinful\".\n\nAfter the attacks, 1000 other students fled the college. The militants appeared to be based in the Gwoza Hills, finding shelter in caves from repeated military bombardments. An engagement with the Nigerian military left 100 militants and 16 soldiers dead. In Gwoza town, where some of the victims were being treated, militants drove away medical officers from the government hospital and set fire to three public schools, and the town was reported to be deserted. More than 30,000 people from the region fled to Cameroon and Chad.\n"}
{"id": "43456997", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=43456997", "title": "HIV and pregnancy", "text": "HIV and pregnancy\n\nHIV in pregnancy is the presence of HIV in a woman while she is pregnant. HIV in pregnancy is of concern because women with HIV/AIDS may transmit the infection to their child during pregnancy, childbirth and while breastfeeding. However, the risk of mother-to-child transmission of HIV may be reduced by treatment of the HIV infection with antiretroviral therapy (ART). This lifelong therapy may be initiated in women before, during, and after pregnancy. After delivery, children are also given the medication temporarily as a prophylactic measure to reduce the risk of infection. Because HIV may also be spread through breast milk, mothers in the United States who are infected are encouraged to avoid breastfeeding. However, in developing countries such as South Africa, where the risk of death of the infant associated with avoiding exclusive breastfeeding is higher than the risk of contracting HIV, exclusive breastfeeding in a mother who is virally suppressed is encouraged.\n\nInfection with HIV/AIDS is not a contraindication to pregnancy. Women with the disease may choose to become pregnant if they desire, however, they are encouraged to talk with their doctors beforehand. Some women are unaware they have the disease until they become pregnant. In this case, they should begin antiretroviral therapy as soon as possible. With the appropriate treatment, the risk of mother-to-child infection can be reduced to below 1%. Without treatment, the risk of transmission is 15–45%.\n\nThere are approximately 1.4 million HIV positive women who become pregnant and contribute to more than 300,000 neonatal and fetal deaths each year. With the use of ART, transmission of HIV from the mother to child has decreased according to reports by the World Health Organization (WHO). In 2009, there were an estimated 400,000 children born with HIV and by 2013, there were 240,000. Countries in Sub-Saharan Africa are worst affected by the HIV/AIDS pandemic. In 2010, 30% of all pregnancies in the region were affected by HIV. In 2011, HIV was responsible for 50% of the deaths of children below the age of five. In the United States, fewer than 200 babies are born with HIV every year.\n\nAs of 2015, Cuba has become the first country in the world to eradicate mother-to-child transmission of HIV. In 2010, the WHO partnered with the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) to implement an initiative that would provide early prenatal care and HIV testing for all pregnant women in Cuba. For women who tested positive, ART was provided for both the mother and child, cesarean sections were performed, and alternatives to breastfeeding were provided. In implementing these measures, the country was successfully able to eradicate HIV transmission during pregnancy.\n\nIn couples where the male and female are both HIV positive, conception may occur normally without concern for disease transmission. However, in couples where only one partner is HIV positive there is risk of transmitting the infection to the uninfected partner. These couples, known as serodiscordant couples, are advised not to engage in unprotected intercourse. Instead, assistive reproductive methods are recommended. In all serodiscordant couples, the infected partner is advised to begin ART so that their viral load is undetectable prior to attempting conception.\n\nIn couples where the woman is HIV negative and the man is HIV positive, sperm is collected from the male partner and HIV is removed from the specimen using a technique called sperm washing. This process is then followed by intrauterine insemination (IUI) or in vitro fertilization (IVF). Couples may also use donor sperm from a non-infected male if desired.\n\nIn couples where the woman is HIV positive and the man is HIV negative, artificial insemination is recommended.\n\nIn areas where assistive reproductive techniques, such as IUI or IVF, are not available, techniques used during intercourse can be attempted to reduce, but not eliminate, the risk of HIV transmission. Most importantly, the HPTN 052 trial showed that when HIV infected partners were on ART and their viral load was undetectable no transmission occurred; in partners with a detectable viral load on ART there was 96% less transmission.\n\nMany serodiscordant couples use pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) to limit transmission of the infection to the uninfected partner. Daily use of PrEP has been shown to decrease transmission of the infection by an average of 63–75%. However, use of PrEP during pregnancy has not yet been studied and its long-term effects on the foetus are unknown.\n\nAlthough assisted reproductive techniques are available for serodiscordant couples, there are still limitations to achieving a successful pregnancy. Women with HIV have been shown to have decreased fertility, which can affect the available reproductive options. Women with HIV are also more likely to be infected with other sexually transmitted diseases, placing them at higher risk for infertility. Males with HIV appear to have decreased semen volume and sperm motility, which decreases their fertility. ART may also affect both male and female fertility and some drugs can be toxic to embryos. Additionally, there have been cases where an HIV-negative partner was infected with the disease despite artificial insemination with washed sperm.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends HIV testing for all pregnant women as a part of routine prenatal care. The test is usually performed in the first trimester of pregnancy with other routine laboratory tests. HIV testing is recommended because HIV-infected women who do not receive testing are more likely to transmit the infection to their children.\n\nHIV testing may be offered to pregnant women on an \"opt-in\" or an \"opt-out\" basis. In the \"opt-in\" model, women are counseled on HIV testing and elect to receive the test by signing a consent form. In the \"opt-out\" model, the HIV test is automatically performed with other routine prenatal tests. If a woman does not want to be tested for HIV, she must specifically refuse the test and sign a form declining testing. The CDC recommends \"opt-out\" testing for all pregnant women because it improves disease detection and treatment and helps reduce transmission to children.\n\nIf a woman chooses to decline testing, she will not receive the test. However, she will continue to receive HIV counseling throughout the pregnancy so that she may be as informed as possible about the disease and its impact. She will be offered HIV testing at all stages of her pregnancy in case she changes her mind.\n\nHIV testing begins with a screening test. The most common screening test is the rapid HIV antibody test which tests for HIV antibodies in blood, urine, or oral fluid. HIV antibodies are only produced if an individual is infected with the disease. Therefore, presence of the antibodies is indicative of an HIV infection. Sometimes, however, a person may be infected with HIV but the body has not produced enough antibodies to be detected by the test. If a woman has risk factors for HIV infection but tests negative on the initial screening test, she should be retested in 3 months to confirm that she does not have HIV. Another screening test that is more specific is the HIV antigen/antibody test. This is a newer blood test that can detect HIV infection quicker than the antibody test because it detects both virus particles and antibodies in the blood.\n\nAny woman who has a positive HIV screening test must receive follow-up testing to confirm the diagnosis. The follow-up test can differentiate HIV-1 from HIV-2 and is a more specific antibody test. It may also detect the virus directly in the bloodstream.\n\nHIV/AIDS may be vertically transmitted from a mother to her child. This means the infection may be spread during pregnancy, labor, delivery, or breastfeeding. 70% of transmissions are believed to occur during delivery when the baby comes into direct contact with the mother's infected blood or genital secretions/fluid in the birth canal. 30% of infections occur in utero during the pregnancy with 66% occurring within the last 14 days of a pregnancy. The mechanism for in utero infection is not well understood, but the current belief is that infected maternal secretions may cross the placenta during the pregnancy.\n\nThe risk of HIV transmission from a mother to child is most directly related to the plasma viral load of the mother. Untreated mothers with a viral load >100,000 copies/ml have a transmission risk of over 50%. For women with a viral load <1000 copies/ml, the risk of transmission is less than 1%. In general, the lower the viral load the lower the risk of transmission. For this reason, ART is recommended throughout the pregnancy so that viral load levels remain as low as possible and the risk of transmission is reduced.\n\nWomen with an established diagnosis of HIV often begin ART before becoming pregnant to treat the infection. It is recommended that all pregnant women begin ART regardless of CD4 counts or viral load to reduce the risk of transmission. The earlier ART is initiated, the more likely the viral load will be suppressed by the time of delivery. Some women are concerned about using ART early in the pregnancy, as babies are most susceptible to drug toxicities during the first trimester. However, delay in ART initiation may prove less effective in reducing infection transmission.\n\nAntiretroviral therapy is used at the following times in pregnancy to reduce the risk of mother-to-child transmission of HIV: \n\nAccording to current recommendations by the WHO, US CDC and U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), all individuals with HIV should begin ART. The recommendation is stronger under the following conditions:\nWomen are encouraged to begin treatment as soon as they are diagnosed with HIV. If they are diagnosed prior to pregnancy, they should continue with ART during the pregnancy. If the diagnosis of HIV is made during the pregnancy, ART should be initiated immediately.\n\nThe goal of antiretroviral use during pregnancy is to reduce the risk of transmission of HIV from mother to child. It is important to choose medications that are safe for the mother and the fetus and which are effective at decreasing the total viral load. Some studies have shown an increase in stillbirths, preterm delivery, and delayed fetal growth in women using high doses of antiretroviral drugs during pregnancy. However, the overall benefits of ART are believed to outweigh the risks and all women are encouraged to use ART for the duration of their pregnancy.\n\nDue to physiological changes in the body during pregnancy, it may be necessary to alter the dosing of medications so that they remain effective. Generally, the dose or the frequency of dosing are increased to account for these changes.\n\nThe recommended ART regimen for HIV-positive pregnant women consists of drugs from 4 different classes of medications listed below. In the United States, the favored regimen is a three-drug regimen where the first two drugs are NRTIs and the third is either a protease inhibitor, an integrase inhibitor, or an NNRTI.\n\n\nVitamin A plays a role in the immune system and is a low-cost intervention that has been suggested to help with preventing mother-to-child transmission of HIV. A Cochrane review summarised the evidence of five trials conducted in Malawi, South Africa, Tanzania and Zimbabwe between 1995 and 2005, where none of the participants received antiretroviral therapy. They found that giving vitamin A supplementation to pregnant women or to women after they delivered a baby probably has little or no effect on mother-to-child transmission of HIV. The intervention has been largely superseded by antiretroviral therapy.\n\nWomen should continue their ART regimen through childbirth.\n\nThe viral load helps determine which mode of delivery is safest for the mother and the baby. In cases where the viral load is low (<1000 copies/mL), the risk of transmission is low and a vaginal delivery may be performed. A cesarean section, on the other hand, is generally performed at 38 weeks gestation under the following circumstances:\nIf, before her scheduled cesarean section, a woman's water breaks and she goes into labor, a cesarean section may not significantly reduce the risk of infection transmission. Under this circumstance, if there is no other medical reason to proceed with a cesarean section, a vaginal delivery may be performed and may be the safest for the mother and the baby.\n\nWomen who present to the hospital in labor with an unknown HIV status should undergo immediate HIV testing. If the initial screening test is positive, the mother should immediately be given a single dose of nifedipine (NVD), tenofovir (TDF) and emtricitabine (FTC) and a three-hourly dose of zidovudine (AZT) and the baby should receive prophylactic ART after birth. This will help reduce the risk of HIV transmission during labor and delivery. A confirmatory HIV test should also be performed in the meantime. If the test results are positive, treatment should continue. If the results are negative, the medications may be stopped.\n\nWomen may transmit HIV to their child via breastmilk. For this reason, breastfeeding is discouraged in the United States amongst HIV-positive women. However, in developing countries such as South Africa, where the risk of death of the infant associated with avoiding exclusive breastfeeding is higher than the risk of contracting HIV, exclusive breastfeeding in a mother who is virally suppressed is encouraged.\n\nIn developed countries, where clean water and infant formula are both accessible and available, HIV-positive women should not breastfeed. They should use formula to reduce the risk of transmitting HIV to the child. Even if the mother is on ART, she should avoid breastfeeding as HIV can still be transmitted through the breastmilk. Some women elect to use donor milk (breast milk donated from non-HIV infected mothers) instead of formula so that their child may receive the health benefits of breast milk, the most notable being increased immunity.\n\nIn underdeveloped countries, where clean water and formula are not as readily available, breastfeeding is encouraged to provide the child with adequate food and nutrients. The benefit of nourishment outweighs the risk of HIV transmission so breastfeeding is acceptable. The South African Department of Health guidelines state that HIV-infected mothers should exclusively breastfeed, that is the infant's diet should consist of breastmilk only and should not be supplemented with water, other liquids or foods, for 6 months after birth. After 6 months, the mother should introduce complementary foods while continuing to breastfeed for up to 24 months.\n\nIn a study conducted in South Africa, 1.1% of children born to HIV-infected mothers who were uninfected at 6 weeks of age, were infected within 1 month of breastfeeding and 4.0% were infected by 6 months of age. A study in Malawi found that the risk of HIV transmission through breastfeeding was 7% in children who breastfed for one year and 10% in children who breastfed for two years. The risk of HIV infection appears to be highest in the early months of breastfeeding and HIV-infected mothers who are not virally suppressed should avoid breastfeeding entirely if possible. In contrast, a systematic review commissioned by the WHO found that there is a very low risk (1.1%) of postnatal HIV transmission in infants breastfed by mothers on lifelong ART that was initiated in early to mid pregnancy. The overall risk of transmission was 3.3%, including exposures \"in utero\" and during childbirth. Another systematic review found that prolonged breastfeeding for infants born to mothers on lifelong ART is beneficial in terms of HIV‐free survival at least up to 24 months of age – increasing HIV-free survival rates from 89% to 96%.\n\nIf the mother has a high HIV viral load (>1000 copies/L), replacement feeding, such as formula, is only initiated as per the UNAIDS guidelines, termed the AFASS criteria, \"where replacement feeding is acceptable, feasible, affordable, sustainable, and safe.\" A mother may only be given infant formula, as explained by the WHO, if the following conditions are met:\n\n\nPregnant women with HIV may still receive the trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine and the tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis (Tdap) vaccination during pregnancy.\n\nMany patients who are HIV positive also have other health conditions known as comorbidities. Hepatitis B, hepatitis C, tuberculosis and injection drug use are some of the most common comorbidities associated with HIV. Women who screen positive for HIV should also be tested for these conditions so that they may be adequately treated or controlled during the pregnancy. The comorbidities may have serious adverse effects on the mother and child during pregnancy, so it is extremely important to identify them early during the pregnancy.\n\nBabies born to HIV-positive women should receive a 6-week or 12-week course of zidovudine (AZT). The medication should ideally be started within the first 6 to 12 hours of life, but can be started up to 72 hours after birth. A 6-week course should be initiated if the mother has been on ART for more than four weeks before birth, and a 12-week course should be initiated if the mother is newly diagnosed or has been on ART for less than four weeks before birth. The baby should be tested for HIV at birth, 4 weeks after cessation of AZT (10 weeks or 16 weeks, depending on length of AZT course, after birth), 6 weeks after cessation of breastfeeding and at 18 months. Usual antibody based testing is unreliable in infants until the age of 18 months due to the transmission of maternal antibodies. A qualitative HIV DNA PCR assay is recommended as it will detect pro-viral HIV DNA since HIV RNA may be suppressed by ART. In order to ensure the baby is HIV-negative, there must be two negative test results. Since zidovudine has been known to cause or worsen anemia, the baby's blood count should be routinely checked during AZT therapy.\n\nTo reduce the risk of developing \"Pneumocystis jirovecii\" pneumonia (PJP), all infants born to HIV-positive mothers should receive trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (cotrimoxazole) from 4–6 weeks after birth, and stop prophylaxis when they are no longer at risk of contracting HIV from their mother.\n\nAlthough the risk is very low, HIV can also be transmitted to a baby through food that was previously chewed (pre-chewed) by a mother or caretaker infected with HIV. To be safe, babies should not be fed pre-chewed food.\n\n"}

After working in retail and fashion in New York City and Denver, Colorado, she opened Jean Yancey & Associates in the latter city in 1973, offering training, consulting, and education for women entrepreneurs. In close to 30 years, she assisted more than 1,000 women launching businesses in public relations, advertising, politics, publishing, and other fields, and was known in Denver as \"the mother of all businesswomen\". She received many awards, including the 1982 National Advocate for Women in Small Businesses award presented by US President Ronald Reagan in a ceremony in the White House Rose Garden. She was inducted into the Colorado Women's Hall of Fame in 1985.\n\nYancey was born Martha Jean Jolliffe on August 18, 1914, in Clarksburg, West Virginia. When she was eight years old, her family relocated to Denver, Colorado. As a student at East High School, she and her friend Jane Smith persuaded the president of The Denver Dry Goods Company to host the first high school fashion show in the United States. The three-day event drew 5,000 teens and their mothers.\n\nYancey studied drama and theatre at the University of Denver for two and a half years, becoming a member of Gamma Phi Beta. In 1936 she moved to New York City to pursue a career in Broadway theatre. In New York, she met and married Lenard Royston Yancey Jr. in April 1937. The couple had three sons.\n\nIn New York, Yancey worked in the bridal department at B. Altman and Company and at Joseph Bryne, organizing a large trade show for the latter. During World War II, when her husband was stationed in Denver, she worked as a buyer for teen fashions at Denver Dry Goods. In 1944 her husband was stationed in Tampa, Florida, and in 1948 in Des Moines, Iowa. In 1959 the family moved back to Denver and Yancey resumed working at Denver Dry Goods, managing the bridal department.\n\nIn 1962, Yancey and a partner opened the Bridal Loft in Cherry Creek North. She sold the business in 1969. In 1970, she formed the Goldstone Fashion Merchandising School, followed in 1973 by the small business consulting firm of Jean Yancey & Associates. Notwithstanding the name, Yancey ran the firm single-handedly.\n\nSpecializing in women's startups, Yancey offered training, consulting, and education to entrepreneurs. In close to 30 years, she assisted more than 1,000 women launching businesses in public relations, advertising, politics, publishing, and other fields. Yancey became known in Denver as \"the mother of all businesswomen\". She was also a recognized speaker in the United States and Canada, and her insights were quoted by women in business authors. Later in the 1970s, Yancey taught at the Emily Griffith Opportunity School and the Barbizon School of Modeling.\n\nYancey was an executive steering committee member for the Women and Business Conference, a director of the Women's Bank, and an honorary director of the Big Sisters of Denver. She was the first national honorary member of the National Association of Women Business Owners. Other memberships included the International Women's Forum, Fashion Group International, the World Future Society, the Denver Business Women's Network, and the Colorado Women's Forum. She was also a member of a Washington, D.C. committee that set the educational agenda for the 1986 White House Conference on Small Business.\n\nYancey was the recipient of many awards for her work mentoring women in business. These included the Salute to Women's 1980 Spice of Life Award and 1983 Outstanding Woman Award, the 1982 Woman of the Year by Soroptomist, the 1990 John Evans Award from the University of Denver, and the 1992 Entrepreneur of the Year Award.

She was posthumously inducted into the Alumni Heritage Hall of East High School in 2008.\n\nSeveral annual awards were named for her. During her lifetime, the Denver chapter of the National Association of Women Business Owners (NAWBO) presented the Jean Yancey Award for Excellence to the entrepreneur who has \"made the most difference\". Posthumously, the Jean Yancey Outstanding Women in Business awards have been presented by the Denver chapter of NAWBO and the \"Denver Business Journal\", in the categories of Large Business Owner, Small Business Owner, and Member of the Year.\n\nIn honor of her 80th birthday in 1994, Yancey's friends dedicated a park bench at Cherry Creek State Park in her name. In honor of her 85th birthday in 1999, 200 guests attended a party at the University of Denver. Yancey received personal greetings from Vice President Al Gore and U.S. Representative Diana DeGette, as well as proclamations signed by Colorado governor Bill Owens and Denver mayor Wellington Webb, who each declared the day as Jean Yancey Day. The party doubled as a benefit for the university's soon to be opened Fisher Early Learning Center. The $20,000 raised from the evening led to the dedication of Grandma Jean's Story Garden at the center.\n\nIn her final years, Yancey suffered from pulmonary hypertension and used a wheelchair and portable oxygen cylinder.

{"id": "299809", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=299809", "title": "John Jacob Astor IV", "text": "John Jacob Astor IV\n\nJohn Jacob \"Jack\" Astor IV (July 13, 1864 – April 15, 1912) was an American businessman, real estate builder, investor, inventor, writer, lieutenant colonel in the Spanish–American War, and a prominent member of the Astor family.\n\nAstor died in the sinking of RMS \"Titanic\" during the early hours of April 15, 1912. Astor was the richest passenger aboard the RMS \"Titanic\" and was thought to be among the richest people in the world at that time, with a net worth of nearly $87 million when he died (equivalent to $ billion in ).\n\nJohn Jacob Astor IV was born on July 13, 1864 at his parents' country estate Ferncliff in Rhinebeck, New York. He was the youngest of five children and only son of businessman, collector, and race horse breeder/owner William Backhouse Astor, Jr. and socialite Caroline Webster \"Lina\" Schermerhorn. His four elder sisters were Emily (1854–1881), Helen (1855–1893), Charlotte (1858–1920), and Caroline (\"Carrie\") (1861–1948). He was a great-grandson of fur-trader John Jacob Astor and Sarah Cox Todd (1761–1834), whose fortune made the Astor family one of the wealthiest in the United States. Astor's paternal grandfather William Backhouse Astor, Sr. was a prominent real estate businessman. Through his paternal grandmother Margaret Alida Rebecca Armstrong (1800–1872), Astor was also a great-grandson of Senator John Armstrong, Jr. and Alida Livingston (1761–1822) of the Livingston family. His maternal grandparents were Abraham Schermerhorn, a wealthy merchant, and socialite Helen Van Courtlandt White. He was also a nephew of financer/philanthropist John Jacob Astor III and grandnephew of occasional poet John Jacob Astor, Jr. (1791–1869). His sister Helen's husband was diplomat James Roosevelt \"Rosey\" Roosevelt, half-brother of President Franklin Delano Roosevelt of the Roosevelt family. Another sister, Carrie, a noted philanthropist, was the wife of Marshall Orme Wilson (1860–1926), brother of banker Richard Thornton Wilson, Jr. and socialite Grace Graham Wilson. Astor was also a first cousin of William Waldorf Astor, 1st Viscount Astor\n\nAstor attended St Paul's School in Concord, New Hampshire and later attended Harvard College. Astor went by the name \"Jack\". His ungainly appearance and the perception that he was an aimless dilettante led one newspaper to give him the name \"Jack Ass-tor\".\n\nOn February 17, 1891, Astor married socialite Ava Lowle Willing, a daughter of Edward Shippen Willing and Alice Barton. The couple had two children:\nAstor and Willing divorced in November 1909. Compounding the scandal of their divorce was Astor's announcement that he would remarry. At the age of 47, Astor married 18-year-old socialite Madeleine Talmage Force, the sister of real estate businesswoman and socialite Katherine Emmons Force. Their parents were William Hurlbut Force and Katherine Arvilla Talmage. Astor and Force were married in his mother's ballroom at Beechwood, the family's Newport, Rhode Island, mansion. There was also much controversy over their 29-year age difference. His son Vincent despised Force, yet he served as best man at his father's wedding. The couple took an extended honeymoon in Europe and Egypt to wait for the gossip to calm down. Among the few Americans who did not spurn him at this time was Margaret Brown, later fictionalized as \"The Unsinkable Molly Brown\". She accompanied the Astors to Egypt and France. After receiving a call to return to the United States, Brown accompanied the couple back home aboard .\n\nAmong Astor's accomplishments was \"A Journey in Other Worlds\" (1894), a science fiction novel about life in the year 2000 on the planets Saturn and Jupiter. He also patented several inventions, including a bicycle brake in 1898, a \"vibratory disintegrator\" used to produce gas from peat moss, and a pneumatic road-improver, and he helped develop a turbine engine. Astor made millions in real estate. In 1897, Astor built the Astoria Hotel, \"the world's most luxurious hotel\", in New York City, adjoining the Waldorf Hotel owned by Astor's cousin and rival, William. The complex became known as the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel. The Waldorf-Astoria would later be the host location to the U.S. inquiries into the sinking of the RMS \"Titanic\", on which Astor died.\n\nFrom 1894 to 1896, he was a colonel on the military staff of New York Governor Levi P. Morton. Shortly after the outbreak of the Spanish–American War in 1898, Astor personally financed a volunteer artillery unit known as the \"Astor Battery\", which saw service in the Philippines. In May 1898, Astor was appointed a lieutenant colonel in the U.S. Volunteers and served as an officer on the staff of Major General William Shafter in Cuba, during the Santiago Campaign. He was later given a brevet (honorary promotion) to colonel in recognition of his services. He was mustered out of the Volunteer Army in November 1898.\n\nDuring the war, he allowed his yacht \"Nourmahal\" to be used by the U.S. government. He appeared in the films \"President McKinley's Inspection of Camp Wikoff\" (1898) and \"Col. John Jacob Astor, Staff and Veterans of the Spanish–American War\" (1899). As a result of his military service, Astor was entitled to the Spanish Campaign Medal. After the war, Astor was often referred to as \"Colonel Astor.\"\nAstor was a member of several military and hereditary societies. He was an early member of the New York Society of Colonial Wars and was assigned membership number 138. He was also a member of the Military Order of Foreign Wars, Society of the Army of Santiago de Cuba, and the Society of the American Wars of the United States.\n\nAstor's estate \"Ferncliff\", north of the town center of Rhinebeck, New York, with a mile and a half of Hudson River frontage in the picturesque Lower Hudson River Valley, had been purchased piecemeal by his father in the mid-19th century; Astor was born there. His father's Italianate house of 1864 was partly rebuilt in 1904 to designs by Stanford White of McKim, Mead, and White, retaining its conservative exterior, and a sports pavilion in Louis XVI style was added. The \"Casino\" or \"Astor Courts\" reportedly housed the first residential indoor swimming pool in the U.S., an indoor tennis court with vaulting of Guastavino tile, and guest bedrooms; in the lower level were a bowling alley and a shooting range. The estate, reduced to and renamed \"Astor Courts\", eventually became a wedding venue. Chelsea Clinton was wed there on July 31, 2010.\n\nWhile traveling, Madeleine Force Astor became pregnant. Wanting the child born in the U.S., the Astors boarded \"Titanic\" on her maiden voyage to New York. They embarked in Cherbourg, France, in first class and were the wealthiest passengers aboard. Accompanying the Astors were Astor's valet, Victor Robbins; Force's maid, Rosalie Bidois; and her nurse, Caroline Louise Endres. They also took their pet Airedale, Kitty. The Astors were deeply fond of their dog and had come close to losing her on a previous trip when she went missing in Egypt. Kitty did not survive the sinking. A short while after \"Titanic\" hit the iceberg that caused her to sink, Astor informed his wife of the collision but told her the damage did not appear to be serious. Some time later, as the ship's lifeboats for first class were being manned, Astor remained unperturbed; he and his family played with the mechanical horses in the gymnasium. At some point Astor is thought to have sliced the lining of an extra lifebelt with a pen knife to show his wife its contents, either to prove they were not of use or to reassure her that they were. He even declared: \"We are safer here than in that little boat.\"\n\nWhen Second Officer Charles Lightoller later arrived on A Deck to finish loading Lifeboat 4, Astor helped his wife, with her maid and nurse, into it. He then asked if he might join his wife because she was in \"a delicate condition\"; however, Lightoller told him men were not to be allowed to board until all the women and children had been loaded. According to \"Titanic\" passenger Archibald Gracie IV, \"She was lifted up through the window, and her husband helped her on the other side, and when she got in, her husband was on one side of this window and I was on the other side, at the next window. I heard Mr Astor ask the second officer whether he would not be allowed to go aboard this boat to protect his wife. He said, \"No, sir, no man is allowed on this boat or any of the boats until the ladies are off.\" Mr Astor then said, \"Well, tell me what is the number of this boat so I may find her afterwards,\" or words to that effect. The answer came back, \"Number 4.\" According to child survivor Betty, as quoted on \"Children on the Titanic\" (2014), Astor was boarding the final lifeboat with his pregnant wife when he saw two scared children on deck and stepped aside, giving his place to them. A conflicting news article posted in the \"Chicago Record Herald\" tells of Astor placing his wife into the final lifeboat then ordering Ida Sophia Hippach and her 17-year-old daughter Jean Gertrude to take the final two places before the boat set sail.\n\nAfter Lifeboat 4 was lowered at 1:55 am, Astor is said to have stood alone while others tried to free the remaining collapsible boats; he was last seen alive on the starboard bridge wing, smoking a cigarette with Jacques Futrelle. A mere half hour later, the ship disappeared beneath the ocean. Survivor Philip Mock claimed to have seen Astor in the water clinging to a raft with William Thomas Stead. \"Their feet became frozen,\" said Mock, \"and they were forced to release their hold. Both were drowned.\" Madeleine Force Astor, her nurse, and her maid survived. Colonel Astor, his valet, Victor Robbins, and Futrelle did not.\n\nIn the aftermath, ships were sent out to retrieve the bodies from the site of the sinking; of the 1,517 passengers and crew who perished in the sinking, only 333 bodies were ever recovered. Astor's body was recovered on April 22 by the cable ship . Astor was identified by the initials sewn on the label of his jacket. Among the items found on him was a gold pocket watch which his son Vincent claimed and wore the rest of his life.\n\nAstor was buried in Trinity Church Cemetery in Manhattan, New York City. Four months after \"Titanic\" sank, Madeleine Astor gave birth to his second son, John Jacob \"Jakey\" Astor VI.\n\nAstor left $69 million of his $85 million estate (equivalent to approximately $1.75 billion in 2017 dollars) to Vincent. This value included his estate in Rhinebeck and his yacht, the \"Noma\". To Madeleine Force Astor, he left $100,000 as an outright bequest as well as a $5 million trust fund from which she was provided an income. Additionally she was given the use of his New York City mansion at 65th Street & Fifth Avenue and all its furnishings, his Newport mansion Beechwood and all its furnishings, pick of whichever luxury limousine she wanted from his collection, and five of his prized horses—as long as she did not remarry. His daughter Ava (who lived with her mother, also named Ava) received a $10 million trust fund. Upon turning 21, John Jacob VI inherited the $3 million trust fund Astor had set aside for him.\n\nAccording to Walter Lord, \"After [the Titanic] sank, the \"New York American\" broke the news on April 16 with a lead devoted almost entirely to John Jacob Astor; at the end it mentioned that 1800 others were also lost.\" Astor's prominence led to the creation of many exaggerated and unsubstantiated accounts about his actions during the sinking of the \"Titanic\". One story alleges that he opened the ship's kennel and released the dogs, including his own beloved Airedale, Kitty; in another, he placed a woman's hat on a boy to make sure the child was able to get into a lifeboat. Another legend claims that after the ship hit the iceberg, he quipped, \"I asked for ice, but this is ridiculous.\" These stories appeared in newspapers, magazines, and even books about the sinking. In reality, none of the claims about Astor's actions were substantiated, as nobody who recognized him survived other than the women who boarded lifeboats relatively early on. Wade wrote that the ice joke is almost certainly apocryphal, as Astor was not known for making jokes, and that the story about the hat (like many other \"survivor stories\" published shortly after the sinking) may have been invented by the reporter. Another legend is that Astor was crushed to death by one of the ship's falling funnels. However, this legend was not true.\n\nAstor's fame has made him a frequent character in films about the \"Titanic\". German actor Karl Schönböck played Astor in the 1943 Nazi propaganda film \"Titanic\". William Johnstone played Astor in the 1953 film \"Titanic\", and in the 1997 version of \"Titanic\" he was played by Eric Braeden. In the 1996 miniseries, he was played by Scott Hylands. Astor was also portrayed by David Janssen in the 1979 film \"S.O.S. Titanic\". Perennially, in the town of Astoria, Oregon (so named for Astor's patrilineal great-grandfather), he is portrayed by a local amateur actor in street corner vignettes. He was played by Miles Richardson in the 2012 \"Titanic\" miniseries. In April 2012, Astor was portrayed by his great-grandson Gregory Todd Astor in \"Titanic the Musical\".\n\n"}
{"id": "3485111", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3485111", "title": "Life Is a Dream", "text": "Life Is a Dream\n\nLife Is a Dream ( ) is a Spanish-language play by Pedro Calderón de la Barca. First published in 1635 (or possibly in early 1636) during the Spanish Baroque period (NADV1), it is a philosophical allegory regarding the human situation and the mystery of life. The play has been described as \"the supreme example of Spanish Golden Age drama\". The story focuses on the fictional Segismundo, Prince of Poland, who has been imprisoned in a tower by his father, King Basilio, following a dire prophecy that the prince would bring disaster to the country and death to the King. Basilio briefly frees Segismundo, but when the prince goes on a rampage, the king imprisons him again, persuading him that it was all a dream.\n\nThe play's central themes are the conflict between free will and fate, as well as restoring one's honor (NADV1). It remains one of Calderón's best-known and most studied works. Other themes include dreams vs. reality and the conflict between father and son. The play has been adapted for other stage works, in film and as a novel.\n\nCatholic Spain was the most powerful European nation by the 16th century. The Spanish Armada was defeated by England in 1588, however, while Spain was trying to defend the northern coast of Africa from the expansion of the Turkish Ottoman Empire, and the gold and silver that Spain took from its possessions in the New World were not adequate to sustain its subsequent decades of heavy military expenses. Spain's power was rapidly waning by the time Calderón wrote \"Life Is a Dream\".\n\nThe age of Calderón was also marked by deep religious conviction in Spain. The Catholic church had fostered Spanish pride and identity, to the extent that \"speaking Christian\" became, and remains, synonymous with speaking Spanish.\n\nAnother current that permeated Spanish thinking was the radical departure from the medieval ideal that royal power resided in God's will, as noted in Machiavelli's \"The Prince\" (1532). Francisco Suarez’s treatise \"On the Defense of Faith\" (\"De defensio fidei\", 1613) stated that political power resided in the people and rejected the divine rights of kings, and Juan Mariana's \"On Kings and Kingship\" (1599) went even further by stating that the people had the right to murder despotic kings.\n\nAmidst these developments during the 16th and 17th centuries, Spain experienced a cultural blossoming referred to as the Spanish Golden Age. The Spanish Golden Age was brought about by the colonization of Americas, as they took advantage of the newfound resources. It saw the birth of notable works of art: \"Don Quixote\", by Miguel de Cervantes (1605), played with the vague line between reality and perception. Lope de Vega, in his play \"Fuente Ovejuna\" (1619), talks about a village that rebels against authority. \n\nRosaura walks through the mountains of Poland, dressed as a man. She finds Clarín, a jester, who tries to make her forget how miserably Poland receives visitors. They arrive at a tower, where they find Segismundo imprisoned, bound in chains. He tells them that his only crime was being born. Clotaldo, Segismundo's old warden and tutor, arrives and orders his guards to disarm and kill the intruders, but he recognizes Rosaura's sword as his own that he had left behind in Muskovy (for a favor that he owed) years ago for his child to bear. Suspecting that Rosaura is his child (he thinks she is male), he takes Rosaura and Clarín with him to court. Fife also appears in this play, who is Rosaura's friend.\nAt the palace, Astolfo, Duke of Muscovy, discusses with his cousin, Princess Estrella (Segismundo's cousin), that as they are the nephew and niece of King Basilio of Poland, they would be his successors if they married each other. Estrella is troubled by the locket that Astolfo wears, with another woman's portrait. Basilio reveals to them that he imprisoned his infant son, Segismundo, due to a prophecy by an oracle that the prince would bring disgrace to Poland and would kill his father, but he wants to grant his son a chance to prove the oracle wrong. If he finds him evil and unworthy, he will send him back to his cell, making way for Astolfo and Estrella to become the new king and queen. Clotaldo enters with Rosaura, telling Basilio that the intruders know about Segismundo. He begs for the king's pardon, as he knows he should have killed them. The king says he should not worry, for his secret has already been revealed. Rosaura tells Clotaldo that she wants revenge against Astolfo, but she won't say why. Clotaldo is reluctant to reveal that he thinks he is Rosaura's father.\n\nClotaldo gives Segismundo a sedative that \"robs one in his sleep of his sense and faculties\" (109), which puts him in a sleep similar to death. In the Royal Palace of the capital city of Warsaw, Clotaldo has learned that Rosaura is a woman; Clarín explains that Rosaura is Princess Estrella's maid but has been going by the name of Astrea. When Segismundo is awakened and arrives at court, Clotaldo tells him that he is the prince of Poland and heir to the throne. He resents Clotaldo for keeping this secret from him for all those years. He finds Duke Astolfo irritating and is dazzled by Estrella's beauty. When a servant warns him about the princess's betrothal to Astolfo, Segismundo is enraged by the news and throws the servant from the balcony.\n\nThe king demands an explanation from his son. He tries to reason with him, but Segismundo announces he will fight everyone, for his rights were denied him for a long time. Basilio warns him that he must behave, or he might find out he's dreaming. Segismundo interrupts a conversation between Rosaura and Clarín. Rosaura wants to leave, but Segismundo tries to seduce her. Clotaldo steps up to defend his child, but Segismundo pulls out a dagger threatening to kill him. As Clotaldo begs for his life, Astolfo challenges Segismundo to a duel. Before they proceed, the king sedates the prince again and sends him back to his cell.\n\nAfter recriminating Astolfo for wearing another woman's portrait around his neck, Estrella commands Rosaura (still going by Astrea) to fetch this locket for her. When she approaches Astolfo for the locket, he says he recognized her as Rosaura and refuses to give her the locket, because the portrait inside is hers. Estrella walks in and demands to see it immediately, but, afraid of being discovered, Rosaura says the locket in Astolfo's hand is actually her own, and that he has hidden the one she was sent to fetch. Estrella leaves furious. Meanwhile, Clotaldo sends Clarín to prison, believing that Clarín knows his secret.\n\nSegismundo mutters in his sleep about murder and revenge. When the prince wakes up, he tells Clotaldo about his \"dream\". Clotaldo tells him that even in dreams, people must act with kindness and justice. When he leaves, Segismundo is left reflecting on dreams and life.\n\nThe people find out that they have a prince and many rebel, breaking him out of his prison tower, although at first they comically mistake Clarin for the prince. Segismundo finds Clotaldo, who is afraid of his reaction. Segismundo forgives him, asking to join his cause, but Clotaldo refuses, swearing allegiance to the king. Back in the palace, everyone prepares for battle, and Clotaldo speaks with Rosaura. She asks him to take Astolfo's life, as he had taken her honor before leaving her. Clotaldo refuses, reminding her that Duke Astolfo is now the heir to the throne. When Rosaura asks what will be of her honor, Clotaldo suggests that she spend her days in a nunnery. Disheartened, Rosaura runs away.\n\nAs war nears, Segismundo sees Rosaura, who tells him that she was the youth who found him in his prison and also the woman who he tried to seduce in court. She tells him that she was born in Muscovy of a noble woman who was disgraced and abandoned. She had the same fate, falling in love with Astolfo and giving him her honor before he abandoned her to marry Estrella. She followed him to Poland for revenge, finding that Clotaldo is her father, but he is unwilling to fight for her honor. Rosaura compares herself to female warriors Athena and Diana. She wants to join Segismundo's battle and to kill Astolfo or to die fighting. Segismundo agrees. While soldiers cheer for Segismundo, Rosaura and Clarín are reunited, and the king's soldiers approach.\n\nSegismundo's army is winning the battle. Basilio, Clotaldo and Astolfo are preparing to escape when Clarín is killed in front of them. Segismundo arrives and Basilio faces his son, waiting for his death, but Segismundo spares his life. In light of the Prince's generous attitude, the King proclaims Segismundo heir to his throne. As King, Segismundo decides that Astolfo must keep his promise to marry Rosaura to preserve her honor. At first Astolfo is hesitant because she is not of noble birth, but when Clotaldo reveals that she is his daughter, Astolfo consents. Segismundo then claims Estrella in marriage himself. Segismundo resolves to live by the motto that \"God is God\", acknowledging that, whether asleep or awake, one must strive for goodness.\n\nThe concept of life as a dream is an ancient one found in Hinduism and Greek philosophy (notably Heraclitus and the famous Platonic Allegory of the Cave), and is directly related to Descartes' dream argument. It has been explored by writers from Lope de Vega to Shakespeare. Key elements from the play may be derived from the Christian legend of Barlaam and Josaphat, which Lope de Vega had brought to the stage. This legend is, itself, a derivation of the story of the early years of Siddharta Gautama, which serves as the basis for the film \"Little Buddha\" that illustrates the Hindu-Buddhist concept of reality as illusion. \n\nOne of the major conflicts of the play is the opposition between king and prince, which parallels with the struggle of Uranus vs. Saturn or Saturn vs. Jupiter in classical mythology. This struggle is a typical representation of the opposition in baroque comedy between the values represented by a fatherly figure and those embodied by the son. An opposition which, in this case, may have biographical elements.\n\nThe theme of honor is major to the character Rosaura. She feels she has been stripped of her honor, and her aim is to reclaim it. She feels that both her and her mother were subjected to the same fate. She pleads to Clotaldo about earning her honor back, which he denies and sends her to a nunnery.\n\nMotifs and themes derived from a number of traditions found in this drama include the labyrinth, the monster, free will vs. predestination, the four elements, original sin, pride and disillusionment.\n\nThe Rosaura subplot has been subjected to much criticism in the past as not belonging to the work. Menéndez y Pelayo saw it as a strange and exotic plot, like a parasitical vine. Rosaura has also been dismissed as the simple stock character of the jilted woman. With the British School of Calderonistas, this attitude changed. A. E. Sloman explained how the main and secondary actions are linked. Others like E. M. Wilson and William M. Whitby consider Rosaura to be central to the work since she parallels Segismundo's actions and also serves as Segismundo's guide, leading him to a final conversion. For some Rosaura must be studied as part of a Platonic ascent on the part of the Prince. Others compare her first appearance, falling from a horse/hippogriff to the plot of Ariosto's \"Orlando furioso\" where Astolfo (the name of the character who deceives Rosaura in our play), also rides the hippogriff and witnesses a prophecy of the return of the mythical Golden Age. For Frederick de Armas, Rosaura hides a mythological mystery already utilized by Ariosto. When she goes to Court, she takes on the name of Astraea, the goddess of chastity and justice. Astraea was the last of the immortals to leave earth with the decline of the ages. Her return signals the return of a Golden Age. Many writers of the Renaissance and early modern periods used the figure of Astraea to praise the rulers of their times. It is possible that Rosaura (an anagram of \"auroras\", \"dawns\") could represent the return of a Golden Age during the reign of Segismundo, a figure that represents King Philip IV of Spain.\n\nThere have been many different interpretations of the play’s ending, where Segismundo condemns the rebel soldier who freed him to life imprisonment in the tower. Some have suggested that this scene is ironic – that it raises questions about whether Segismundo will in fact be a just king. Others have pointed out that Calderón, who lived under the Spanish monarchy, could not have left the rebel soldier unpunished, because this would be an affront to royal authority.\n\nIt is worth considering that Segismundo’s transformation in the course of the play is not simply a moral awakening, but a realization of his social role as the heir to the throne, and this role requires him to act as kings act. For some, the act of punishing the rebel soldier makes him a Machiavellian prince. Others argue that, while this action may seem unjust, it is in keeping with his new social status as the king. Daniel L. Heiple traces a long tradition of works where treason seems to be rewarded, but the traitor or rebel is subsequently punished.\n\nIt may well be that, rather than intending his audience to see this action as purely right or wrong, Calderón purposefully made it ambiguous, creating an interesting tension in the play that adds to its depth.\n\n\n\n"}

The list also includes fatal accidents in the International Championship for Manufacturers (IMC), the predecessor to the World Rally Championship, which was contested from 1970 to 1972. Well-known fatalities involving officials, spectators and team members are also mentioned.\n\nThe fatal accidents of the Group B era resulted in its demise. Only hours after Henri Toivonen's crash at the 1986 Tour de Corse, FISA president Jean-Marie Balestre announced that Group B cars were banned for the 1987 season. However, driver fatalities peaked in 1989, when five competitors died in the first three rallies of the season (two during reconnaissance, two who were spectating having only done reconnaissance for the event, and only one as an active competitor). Markko Märtin's co-driver Michael Park's death at the 2005 Wales Rally GB was the WRC's first fatality in over eleven years.\n\nAt the 1975 Safari Rally, a service car with four mechanics crashed into a truck near Mombasa. Carlino Dacista, Brian Fernandez and Willie Uis died instantly. The driver David Joshi sustained serious injuries. At the 1978 Monte Carlo Rally, two mechanics, Bernard Balmer and Georges Reinier, died when their van collided with a truck near Gap, Hautes-Alpes. On the second day of the 1987 Rallye Côte d'Ivoire, Toyota Team Europe's Cessna 340 crashed and exploded, killing all four inside; manager and former co-driver Henry Liddon, his assistant Nigel Harris, the pilot and the navigator. Team manager Ove Andersson withdrew Toyota from the event. Prior to the accident, Björn Waldegård and Fred Gallagher had been running second in their Toyota Supra Turbo. At the 1996 Safari Rally, competed in bad weather and rain, three British mechanics drowned while attempting to cross a river with their Land Rover.\n\nAt the end of the fourth stage of the 1981 1000 Lakes Rally, Audi Sport driver Franz Wittmann and his co-driver Kurt Nestinger did not notice the flying finish which marks the end of the stage. They continued at race speed with their Quattro and crashed into a group of people standing in front of a van. Raul Falin, chairman of AKK, Finland's sporting authority for motorsport and the country's representative in the FIA, was quickly taken to a hospital but died from his injuries soon after. Boris Rung, co-founder and chairman of the European Rallycross Association and member of FIA's Off-Road Commission, survived the accident along with Greek FIA observer Costas Glossotis.\n\nAt the 1978 Safari Rally, five passers-by and four spectators were killed in unrelated accidents, both involving non-competitive drivers crashing into competitors.\n\nOn the first stage of the 1986 Rally Portugal, Joaquim Santos lost control of his Ford RS200 while trying to avoid spectators on the road, crashing into a crowd of spectators, killing three and injuring over thirty. All the factory teams – Audi, Austin Rover, Ford, Lancia, Peugeot and Volkswagen – withdrew from the event.\n\nAt the 1996 1000 Lakes Rally, at a special stage that took place in the centre of Jyväskylä, one spectator died and 36 were injured when Danish driver Karsten Richardt lost control of his Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution. Rikhard reached the curve at , finally hitting the crowd at .\n\nAt the 2017 Monte Carlo Rally, a spectator died after Hayden Paddon slid wide on a left-hand corner and went rear-first on the roadside embankment.\n"}

Property dualists, on the other hand, claim that no such reductive explanation is possible. Eliminativists may reject the existence of mental properties, or at least of those corresponding to folk psychological categories such as thought and memory.

Her parents made a missing person report to the police and a search for her was made in the subsequent weeks, conducted by several organisations including the mainstream media and NGOs. Police were able to find CCTV footage, from a nearby camera, showing her being dragged into a white van the night she went missing. Her murder has not been solved.\n\nOn the morning of 17 September 2007, a brand-new gym bag was left in front of a shop lot in PJS 1/48, Petaling Jaya, discovered by the shop owner. It contained an unidentified child's naked body which had been stuffed in the fetal position; police believed that she had been dead for more than six hours before the discovery. A cucumber and a brinjal were found stuffed inside her genitals and had caused her rectum to rupture. It was determined that bacterial infection had contributed to her death. At the time, Nurin Jazlin's parents were not able to identify the body as their daughter's due to the changes in her physical features; it was even suggested that the child might be a foreigner, as she lacked the scar which would be caused by the mandatory BCG vaccination against tuberculosis. Her parents initially maintained hope that their daughter might be alive and were the victims of several prank calls from people claiming that Nurin was under their care. Later DNA tests conducted confirmed the body as Nurin Jazlin's.\n\nHer body was later claimed by her family from the Kuala Lumpur Hospital (HKL) and she was buried at the Muslim cemetery in Taman Ibukota, Setapak, Kuala Lumpur on 21 September after the Friday noon prayers.\n\nThe nature of her brutal torture and eventual death at the hands of an unknown assailant, suspected to be a psychopathic killer, sparked outrage throughout the country. Malaysian media and Internet blogs have been filled with anger and disbelief in reaction to the case, and the murder is widely considered to be \"the country's most horrifying crime in years.\" The case led to a statement by then Prime Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi about the possibility of publicising the list of convicted child sex offenders. Inspector-general of police Musa Hassan initially suggested that he would investigate whether Nurin's parents had been negligent, an offence which could lead to charges under Section 33 of the Child Act 2001. The suggestion provoked public outcry, most prominently from Lee Lam Thye, chairman of the Malaysia Crime Prevention Foundation, who responded that punishing the parents further would be unfair.\n\nOn 28 September, federal agents raided a shop in Section 7, Shah Alam, where they arrested four men and one woman between the ages of 27 and 35 in connection with the murder. The woman was released after questioning, while the men were remanded to police custody for seven days. However, they were released unconditionally three days later due to lack of evidence. Police then proceeded to put up an award of RM10,000 for information leading to the arrest of Nurin's killer; an anonymous private businessman agreed to match that with an additional RM10,000. On 2 October, police arrested an Indonesian woman at a market in Nilai, Negeri Sembilan; when confronted, the woman attempted to swallow a SIM card she was carrying.\n\nOn 11 October, police released video footage captured by a CCTV camera near a shoplot in Petaling Utama, Petaling Jaya, where the sports bag containing the body of eight-year-old Nurin was found. The CCTV footage was sent on 26 September to the FBI to enhance the clarity of the blurred images. The first clip, captured at about 1 pm on September 16, showed a motorcyclist carrying a sports bag (with Nurin's body in it) and leaving it at the shoplot. The second clip, recorded one hour later, showed a woman loitering around the shoplot who was later picked up by three men arriving at the scene. The enhanced footage, however, failed to reveal the face of the motorcyclist and the license plate of the motorcycle.\n\n"}

O'Neill in his 1976 book \"\". O'Neill proposed the colonization of space for the 21st century, using materials extracted from the Moon and later from asteroids.\n\nAn O'Neill cylinder would consist of two counter-rotating cylinders. The cylinders would rotate in opposite directions in order to cancel out any gyroscopic effects that would otherwise make it difficult to keep them aimed toward the Sun. Each would be in diameter and long, connected at each end by a rod via a bearing system. They would rotate so as to provide artificial gravity via centrifugal force on their inner surfaces.\n\nWhile teaching undergraduate physics at Princeton University, O'Neill set his students the task of designing large structures in outer space, with the intent of showing that living in space could be desirable. Several of the designs were able to provide volumes large enough to be suitable for human habitation. This cooperative result inspired the idea of the cylinder, and was first published by O'Neill in a September 1974 article of \"Physics Today\".\n\nO'Neill's project was not completely without precedent. In 1954, the German scientist Hermann Oberth described the use of gigantic habitable cylinders for space travel in his book \"Menschen im Weltraum – Neue Projekte für Raketen- und Raumfahrt (\"People in space – New projects for rockets and space travel\")\".\n\nO'Neill created three reference designs, nicknamed \"islands\":\n\nIsland One is a rotating sphere measuring one mile in circumference (1,681 feet or 512.27 meters in diameter), with people living on the equatorial region (see Bernal sphere). A later NASA/Ames study at Stanford University developed an alternative version of Island One: the Stanford torus, a toroidal shape in diameter.\n\nIsland Two is also spherical in design, and is 1,600 meters in diameter.\n\nThe Island Three design, better known as the O'Neill cylinder, consists of two counter-rotating cylinders, each in diameter, and capable of scaling up to long. Each cylinder has six equal-area stripes that run the length of the cylinder; three are transparent windows, three are habitable \"land\" surfaces. Furthermore, an outer agricultural ring, in radius, rotates at a different speed to support farming. The habitat's industrial manufacturing block is located in the middle, to allow for minimized gravity for some manufacturing processes.\n\nTo save the immense cost of rocketing the materials from Earth, these habitats would be built with materials launched into space from the Moon with a magnetic mass driver.\n\nThe cylinders rotate to provide artificial gravity on their inner surface. At the radius described by O'Neill, the habitats would have to rotate about twenty-eight times an hour to simulate a standard Earth gravity. Research on human factors in rotating reference frames\nindicate that, at such low rotation speeds, few people would experience motion sickness due to coriolis forces acting on the inner ear. People would, however, be able to detect spinward and antispinward directions by turning their heads, and any dropped items would appear to be deflected by a few centimetres. The central axis of the habitat would be a zero-gravity region, and it was envisaged that recreational facilities could be located there.\n\nThe habitat was planned to have oxygen at partial pressures roughly similar to terrestrial air, 20% of the Earth's sea-level air pressure. Nitrogen would also be included to add a further 30% of the Earth's pressure. This half-pressure atmosphere would save gas and reduce the needed strength and thickness of the habitat walls.\n\nAt this scale, the air within the cylinder and the shell of the cylinder provide adequate shielding against cosmic rays. The internal volume of an O'Neill cylinder is great enough to support its own small weather systems, which may be manipulated by altering the internal atmospheric composition or the amount of reflected sunlight.\n\nLarge mirrors are hinged at the back of each stripe of window. The unhinged edge of the windows points toward the Sun. The purpose of the mirrors is to reflect sunlight into the cylinders through the windows. Night is simulated by opening the mirrors, letting the window view empty space; this also permits heat to radiate to space. During the day, the reflected Sun appears to move as the mirrors move, creating a natural progression of Sun angles. Although not visible to the naked eye, the Sun's image might be observed to rotate due to the cylinder's rotation. Light transmitted through glass at an angle is somewhat polarized, which might confuse pollinating bees.\n\nTo permit light to enter the habitat, large windows run the length of the cylinder. These would not be single panes, but would be made up of many small sections, to prevent catastrophic damage, and so the aluminum or steel window frames can take most of the stresses of the air pressure of the habitat. Occasionally a meteorite might break one of these panes. This would cause some loss of the atmosphere, but calculations showed that this would not be an emergency, due to the very large volume of the habitat.\n\nThe habitat and its mirrors must be perpetually aimed at the Sun to collect solar energy and light the habitat's interior. O'Neill and his students carefully worked out a method of continuously turning the colony 360 degrees per orbit without using rockets (which would shed reaction mass).\nFirst, the pair of habitats can be rolled by operating the cylinders as momentum wheels. If one habitat's rotation is slightly off, the two cylinders will rotate about each other. Once the plane formed by the two axes of rotation is perpendicular in the roll axis to the orbit, then the pair of cylinders can be yawed to aim at the Sun by exerting a force between the two sunward bearings. Pushing the cylinders away from each other will cause both cylinders to gyroscopically precess, and the system will yaw in one direction, while pushing them towards each other will cause yaw in the other direction. The counter-rotating habitats have no net gyroscopic effect, and so this slight precession can continue throughout the habitat's orbit, keeping it aimed at the Sun.\nin 2014, a new construction method where suggested by inflating a bag and then taping it with a spool (from asteroid materials) like the construction of a Composite overwrapped pressure vessel.\n\nIn 1990 and 2007, a smaller design derivative was presented, Kalpana one, that deals with the wobbling effect of a rotating cylinder by increasing the diameter and shortening the length, the logistics challenges of the radiation shield by building the station in LEO, and by removing the windows to make it a closed cylinder.\n\n"}
{"id": "41077350", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=41077350", "title": "OpenWorm", "text": "OpenWorm\n\nOpenWorm is an international open science project to simulate the roundworm \"Caenorhabditis elegans\" at the cellular level as a simulation. Although the long-term goal is to model all 959 cells of the \"C. elegans\", the first stage is to model the worm's locomotion by simulating the 302 neurons and 95 muscle cells. This bottom up simulation is being pursued by the OpenWorm community. As of this writing, a physics engine called Sibernetic has been built for the project and models of the neural connectome and a muscle cell have been created in NeuroML format. A 3D model of the worm anatomy can be accessed through the web via the OpenWorm browser. The OpenWorm project is also contributing to develop Geppetto, a web-based multi-algorithm, multi-scale simulation platform engineered to support the simulation of the whole organism.\n\nThe roundworm \"C. elegans\" has one of the simplest nervous systems of any organism, with its hermaphrodite type having only 302 neurons. Furthermore, the structural connectome of these neurons is fully worked out. There are fewer than one thousand cells in the whole body of a \"C. elegans\" worm, and because \"C. Elegans\" is a model organism, each has a unique identifier and comprehensive supporting literature. Being a model organism, the genome is fully known, along with many well characterized mutants readily available, a comprehensive literature of behavioural studies, etc. With so few neurons and new calcium 2 photon microscopy techniques it should soon be possible to record the complete neural activity of a living organism. By manipulating the neurons through optogenetic techniques, combined with the above recording capacities the project is in an unprecedented position to be able to fully characterize the neural dynamics of an entire organism.\n\nIn the process of trying to build an \"in silico\" model of a relatively simple organism like \"C. elegans\", new tools are being developed which will make it easier to model progressively more complex organisms.\n\nProject Nemaload was created as a research program trying to empirically establish the relevant biological facts which are necessary for a true bottom-up simulation. The project founder, David Dalrymple, is a collaborator on the OpenWorm project.\n\nAlthough the ultimate goal is to simulate all features of \"C. elegans\"' behaviour, the project is new and the first behaviour the Open Worm community decided to simulate is a simple motor response: teaching the worm to crawl. To do so, the virtual worm must be placed in a virtual environment. A full feedback loop must be established: Environmental Stimulus > Sensory Transduction > Interneuron Firing > Motor Neuron Firing > Motor Output > Environmental Change > Sensory Transduction.\n\nThere are two main technical challenges here: modelling the neural/electrical properties of the brain as it processes the information, and modelling the mechanical properties of the body as it moves. The neural properties are being modeled by a Hodgkin-Huxley model, and the mechanical properties are being modeled by a Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamic algorithm.\n\nThe OpenWorm team built an engine called Geppetto which could integrate these algorithms and due to its modularity will be able to model other biological systems (like digestion) which the team will tackle at a later time.\n\nThe team also built an environment called NeuroConstruct which is able to output neural structures in NeuroML. Using NeuroConstruct the team reconstructed the full connectome of \"C. elegans\".\n\nUsing NeuroML the team has also built a model of a muscle cell. Note that these models currently only model the relevant properties for the simple motor response: the neural/electrical and the mechanical properties discussed above.\n\nThe next step is to connect this muscle cell to the six neurons which synapse on it and approximate their effect.\n\nThe rough plan is to then both:\n\nAs of January 2015, the project is still awaiting peer review, and researchers involved in the project are reluctant to make bold claims about its current resemblance to biological behavior; project coordinator Stephen Larson estimates that they are \"only 20 to 30 percent of the way towards where we need to get\".\n\nIn 1998 Japanese researchers announced the Perfect C. elegans Project. A proposal was submitted, but the project appears to have been abandoned.\n\nIn 2004 a group from Hiroshima began the Virtual C. elegans Project. They released two papers which showed how their simulation would retract from virtual prodding.\n\nIn 2005 a Texas researcher described a simplified C. elegans simulator based on a 1-wire network incorporating a digital Parallax Basic Stamp processor, sensory inputs and motor outputs. Inputs employed 16-bit A/D converters attached to operational amplifier simulated neurons and a 1-wire temperature sensor. Motor outputs were controlled by 256-position digital potentiometers and 8-bit digital ports. Artificial muscle action was based on Nitinol actuators. It used a \"sense-process-react\" operating loop which recreated several instinctual behaviors.\n\nThese early attempts of simulation have been criticized for not being biologically realistic. Although we have the complete structural connectome, we do not know the synaptic weights at each of the known synapses. We do not even know whether the synapses are inhibitory or excitatory. To compensate for this the Hiroshima group used machine learning to find some weights of the synapses which would generate the desired behaviour. It is therefore no surprise that the model displayed the behaviour, and it may not represent true understanding of the system.\n\nThe Open Worm community is committed to the ideals of open science. Generally this means that the team will try to publish in open access journals and include all data gathered (to avoid the file drawer problem). Indeed, all the biological data the team has gathered is publicly available, and the five publications the group has made so far are available for free on their website. All the software that OpenWorm has produced is completely free and open source.\n\nOpen Worm is also trying a radically open model of scientific collaboration. The team consists of anyone who wishes to be a part of it. There are over one hundred \"members\" who are signed up for the high volume technical mailing list. Of the most active members who are named on a publication there are collaborators from Russia, Brazil, England, Scotland, Ireland and the United States. To coordinate this international effort, the team uses \"virtual lab meetings\" and other online tools that are detailed in the resources section.\n\n"}

It is occasionally referred to as \"geobiology\".\n\nPaleobiological research uses biological field research of current biota and of fossils millions of years old to answer questions about the molecular evolution and the evolutionary history of life. In this scientific quest, macrofossils, microfossils and trace fossils are typically analyzed. However, the 21st-century biochemical analysis of DNA and RNA samples offers much promise, as does the biometric construction of phylogenetic trees.\n\nAn investigator in this field is known as a paleobiologist.\n\n\nThe founder or \"father\" of modern paleobiology was Baron Franz Nopcsa (1877 to 1933), a Hungarian scientist trained at the University of Vienna. He initially termed the discipline \"paleophysiology.\"\n\nHowever, credit for coining the word \"paleobiology\" itself should go to Professor Charles Schuchert. He proposed the term in 1904 so as to initiate \"a broad new science\" joining \"traditional paleontology with the evidence and insights of geology and isotopic chemistry.\"\n\nOn the other hand, Charles Doolittle Walcott, a Smithsonian adventurer, has been cited as the \"founder of Precambrian paleobiology.\" Although best known as the discoverer of the mid-Cambrian Burgess shale animal fossils, in 1883 this American curator found the \"first Precambrian fossil cells known to science\" – a stromatolite reef then known as \"Cryptozoon\" algae. In 1899 he discovered the first acritarch fossil cells, a Precambrian algal phytoplankton he named \"Chuaria\". Lastly, in 1914, Walcott reported \"minute cells and chains of cell-like bodies\" belonging to Precambrian purple bacteria.\n\nLater 20th-century paleobiologists have also figured prominently in finding Archaean and Proterozoic eon microfossils: In 1954, Stanley A. Tyler and Elso S. Barghoorn described 2.1 billion-year-old cyanobacteria and fungi-like microflora at their Gunflint Chert fossil site. Eleven years later, Barghoorn and J. William Schopf reported finely-preserved Precambrian microflora at their Bitter Springs site of the Amadeus Basin, Central Australia.\n\nFinally, in 1993, Schopf discovered O-producing blue-green bacteria at his 3.5 billion-year-old Apex Chert site in Pilbara Craton, Marble Bar, in the northwestern part of Western Australia. So paleobiologists were at last homing in on the origins of the Precambrian \"Oxygen catastrophe.\"\n\n\n\n\n"}

It can be found in the Western Ghats in India. Names in English that have been used for this species are purple frog, Indian purple frog, or pignose frog. Although the adult frog was formally described in October 2003, the taxon was recognized much earlier by its tadpole, which had been described in 1918.\n\nThe species was described from specimens collected in the Idukki district of Kerala by S.D. Biju from the Tropical Botanic Garden and Research Institute in Palode, India, and Franky Bossuyt from the \"Vrije Universiteit Brussel\" (Free University of Brussels), in 2003. However, it was already well known to the local people and several earlier documented specimens and publications had been ignored by the authors in the 2003 paper that describes the genus and species.\n\nThe scientific name \"Nasikabatrachus sahyadrensis\" is a latinized form, composed of respectively derived from Sanskrit \"nāsikā\" (नासिका) for \"nose\", Greek \"batrachos\" (βάτραχος) for \"frog\", and Sahyadri, the native name of the mountain range of the Western Ghats which he inhabits.\n\nThe body of \"Nasikabatrachus sahyadrensis\" appears robust and bloated and is relatively rounded compared to other more dorsoventrally flattened frogs. Its arms and legs splay out in the standard anuran body form. Compared to other frogs, \"N. sahyadrensis\" has a small head and an unusual pointed snout. Adults are typically dark purplish-grey in color. Males are about a third of the length of females. The specimen with which the species was originally described was 7.0 cm long from the tip of the snout to the vent. Tadpoles of the species had been described in 1917 by Nelson Annandale and C. R. Narayan Rao as having oral suckers that allowed them to live in torrential streams. Suckers are also present in rheophilic fishes of genera such as \"Glyptothorax\", \"Travancoria\", \"Homaloptera\", and \"Bhavania\", adaptations that are the result of convergent evolution. Some of these fishes co-occur with \"Nasikabatrachus\" tadpoles in the hill streams. Its vocalization is a drawn-out harsh call that sounds similar to a chicken clucking.\n\nEarlier thought to be restricted to the south of the Palghat Gap in the Western Ghats, additional records have extended its known range farther north of the gap. The species is now known to be quite widely distributed in the Western Ghats, ranging from the Camel's Hump Hill Range in the north, all the way to the northernmost portions of the Agasthyamalai Hill Range in the south.\n\nThe frog spends most of its life underground and surfaces only during the monsoon, for mating. With few field scientists out in the field during the rainy season the species was discovered and studied only in recent times. Males emerge to call beside temporary rainwater streams. They mount females and grip them (amplexus) along the veterbral column. Around 3000 eggs are laid in a rock pool and the tadpoles metamorphose after around 100 days.\n\nUnlike many other burrowing species of frogs that emerge and feed above the ground, this species has been found to forage underground, feeding mainly on termites using its tongue and a special buccal groove.\n\nIn 2015, tadpoles of the species were discovered to be traditionally consumed by local tribesmen.\n\n"}

He became known as \"Robert of Jerusalem\" (\"Robertus Hierosolimitanus\") or \"Robert the Crusader\" after his exploits in the First Crusade.\n\nHe was the eldest son of Robert I of Flanders and Gertrude of Saxony. His father, hoping to place the cadet branch (or \"Baldwinite\" branch) of Flanders over the county, began to associate him with his rule around 1086. From 1085 to 1091 he was regent of the county while his father was away on pilgrimage to the Holy Land.\n\nAfter becoming count in 1093, Robert joined the First Crusade, launched by Pope Urban II in 1095. He made his wife Clementia of Burgundy regent in Flanders, and formed an army that followed the retinue of his kinsman Godfrey of Bouillon, Duke of Lower Lorraine. After reaching Constantinople, the crusaders were obliged to swear an oath of fealty to Byzantine emperor Alexius I Comnenus and promise to return to the Byzantine Empire any land they might capture. Robert, whose father had already served Alexius during his pilgrimage in the 1080s, had no problem swearing this oath, but some of the other leaders did and there was some delay in leaving the city.\n\nRobert then participated in the Siege of Nicaea, after which the army was split into two groups. Robert marched with Stephen of Blois, Bohemund of Taranto, Robert Curthose, and the Byzantine guides, one day ahead of the rest of the crusaders. This army was surrounded by the Seljuk sultan Kilij Arslan I at the Battle of Dorylaeum on 30 June 1097. The next day, the second army, led by Raymond IV of Toulouse, Godfrey of Bouillon, and Hugh of Vermandois, arrived and broke the encirclement; the two armies joined together, with Robert and Raymond forming the centre. The Turks were defeated and the crusaders continued their march.\n\nAt the end of 1097 the crusaders arrived at Antioch. The Siege of Antioch lasted many months; in December, Robert and Bohemund briefly left the army to raid the surrounding territory for food, and on 30 December they defeated an army sent to relieve Antioch, led by Dukak of Damascus. Antioch was eventually betrayed to Bohemund by an Armenian guard, and Robert was among the first to enter the city, but only a few days later they were themselves besieged by Kerbogha of Mosul. On 28 June 1098, the crusaders marched out to meet him in battle; Robert and Hugh of Vermandois led the first of six divisions. Kerbogha was defeated and the Muslim-held citadel finally surrendered to the crusaders. Robert, along with Bohemund, Raymond, and Godfrey, occupied the citadel, but Bohemund soon claimed the city for himself. Raymond also claimed it, but Robert supported Bohemund in this dispute.\n\nThe dispute delayed the crusade even further. Raymond left Antioch to attack Ma'arrat al-Numan, which was captured; Robert took part in this siege as well. Raymond then tried to bribe Robert and the other leaders to follow him instead of Bohemund; Robert was offered six thousand \"sous\", but each attempted bribe was ignored. Raymond continued south to Jerusalem in January, 1099, but Robert and Godfrey remained behind in Antioch until February. They rejoined Raymond's army at the Siege of Arqa. In June, Robert and Gaston IV of Bearn led the vanguard which arrived at Ramla, and with Tancred of Taranto he led an expedition into Samaria to find wood in order to construct siege engines for the Siege of Jerusalem. When Jerusalem was captured on 15 July, Robert supported Godfrey's claim over that of Raymond, and on August 9 marched out with him to meet the Fatimid army under al-Afdal Shahanshah which was coming to relieve Jerusalem. Robert formed part of the centre wing in the ensuing Battle of Ascalon, which resulted in a crusader victory. However, Godfrey and Raymond quarrelled over possession of Ascalon, and even Robert could not support Godfrey in this dispute; the city remained uncaptured, although the victory allowed for the establishment of the Kingdom of Jerusalem.\n\nAt the end of August, Robert returned home with Robert Curthose and Raymond. On the way back they captured Latakia, which was returned to the Byzantine emperor, as promised years before. Raymond remained there but both Roberts continued home by way of Constantinople, after declining Alexius' request to stay there in his service. Robert brought back with him a precious relic, the arm of Saint George, a gift from Alexius. The relic was placed in the church of Anchin Abbey in Flanders. After he returned, Robert built the monastery of St. Andrew in Betferkerke, near Bruges. Because of his crusade and the spoils he brought home, he was nicknamed Robert of Jerusalem.\n\nDuring his absence, Holy Roman Emperor Henry IV had tried to seize imperial Flanders. Robert responded by supporting the revolt of the Commune of Cambrai against the emperor and his supporter, Bishop Gaulcher, and seized a number of castles. Peace was restored in 1102 paid homage to the emperor for imperial Flanders, but after 1105, the new emperor, Henry V, marched on Flanders, with the aid of Baldwin III, Count of Hainaut and an army from Holland. Robert stopped them outside of Douai and a new peace was signed, in which the emperor recognized Robert's claim to Douai and Cambrai.\n\nIn 1103 he made an alliance with King Henry I of England, offering 1000 cavalry in exchange for an annual tribute of £500, but when Henry refused to pay, Robert allied with his nominal overlord, Louis VI of France, and attacked Normandy. With the king diverted, Theobald IV of Blois led a revolt of the French barons. Robert led an army against Meaux; during the battle he fell off his horse and was trampled to death.\n\nHe married Clementia of Burgundy, sister of Pope Callistus II and daughter of William I, Count of Burgundy. They had three children, but only the oldest survived to adulthood. He succeeded Robert as Baldwin VII of Flanders.\n\n"}

After studying briefly at Duke University, he embarked on an acting career. He retired by the mid-1960s to become a freelance photojournalist under contract to \"Time\".\n\nIn search of exceptional images, he traveled with special forces units and irregulars operating in remote areas. While on assignment in Cambodia in April 1970, Flynn and fellow photojournalist Dana Stone were captured by communist guerrillas. Neither man was seen or heard from again.\n\nIn 1984, Flynn's mother had him declared dead \"in absentia\".\n\nFlynn's parents separated when he was young. He was raised by his mother, Lili Damita.\n\nFlynn first appeared in front of the cameras at the age of fifteen, when he appeared in an episode of his father's television show, \"The Errol Flynn Theatre\". The episode, \"Strange Auction,\" was broadcast in the U.K. in 1956 and in the United States in 1957.\n\nWhen Errol Flynn died, he left his son $5,000 to help with his college education (Errol left his two eldest daughters $10,000 each.)\n\nFlynn was studying at Duke University. Over a summer break in June 1960, he was visiting his mother in Fort Lauderdale. At the suggestion of his friend, actor George Hamilton, Flynn filmed a scene in Hamilton's picture \"Where the Boys Are\", which was shooting in Fort Lauderdale at the time. Most of his scenes ended up on the cutting room floor, but he can still be seen in a scene walking by wearing a blue \"Xavier University\" sweatshirt.\n\nIn May 1961, at the age of 20, Flynn accepted a contract with Sage Western Pictures to appear in the 1962 \"Il Figlio del Capitano Blood\", a sequel to his father's hit film \"Captain Blood\". He was paid $110 a week for the testing period, going up to $10,000 for 12 weeks work in the film. As Flynn was still legally a minor he needed his mother's permission, which was granted. The test was successful. The film was released in the United States in 1964 as \"The Son of Captain Blood\".\n\nIn 1962 George Hamilton announced that he wanted to make \"The Brothers\", based on a story by Hamilton, starring himself and Flynn and Terry Thomas, but the film was never made. Around this time his fiancé was Julie Payne, daughter of actors John Payne and Anne Shirley. (A few years later he was engaged to Alessandra Panao.)\n\nHe made a few more films in Europe, including \"\" (1963; released in 1964 as \"Duel at the Rio Grande\"), \"Verspätung in Marienborn\" with José Ferrer (1963; released in 1964 as \"Stop Train 349\"), \"Agent Special a Venise \"Voir Venise et...Crever\"\" (1964; sold to U.S. television syndication as \"Mission to Venice\"), and \"Sandok, Il Maciste della Jungla\" (1964; released in 1966 as \"Temple of the White Elephant\").\n\nFlynn became bored with acting, and he went to Africa in late 1964 to try his hand at being a guide for safaris and big-game hunting. He also spent time as a game warden in Kenya. In the latter part of 1965, he needed money, so he made two Spaghetti Westerns in Spain and Italy that were released in 1966: \"Sette Magnifiche Pistole\" (\"Seven Guns for Timothy\") and \"Dos Pistolas Gemelas\" co-starring the Spanish twin performers \"Pili & Mili\". In the summer of 1966, Flynn went to Singapore to star in his eighth and final film, the French-Italian action film \"Cinq Gars Pour Singapour\" (1967; released in 1968 as \"Five Ashore in Singapore\").\n\nIn September 1961 it was announced Flynn had signed a recording contract for a company known as Hi-Fidelity R.V. Records, and had already recorded four songs for them.\n\nTwo came out \"Stay in My Heart\" b/w \"Secret Love\". The songs were released regionally as a 45rpm single (Arvee 5043). The single is now a rare collector's item.\n\nFlynn arrived in South Vietnam in January 1966 as a freelance photojournalist, first for the French magazine \"Paris Match\", then for Time Life, and finally for United Press International. His photos were soon published around the world. He made a name for himself as one of a group of high-risk photojournalists (which included Dana Stone, Tim Page, Henri Huet, John Steinbeck IV, Perry Deane Young, Nik Wheeler, Chas Gerretsen, and others) who would do anything to get the best pictures, even go into combat.\n\nIn March 1966, Flynn was wounded in the knee while in the field.\n\nIn April 1966 he was on patrol with some Green Berets and Chinese mercenaries, Nungs, when they were ambushed by the Viet Cong. Flynn was carrying an M-16 rifle at the time and had to fight his way out along with the other soldiers. \"I thought not only me but all of us were greased.\" Flynn had been given the rifle by the Green Berets and been under fire with them before.\n\nIn May he was the only journalist who made it into the Tinh Hai pagoda in Da Nang.\n\nIn June 1966, he left Vietnam long enough to star in his last movie. It was to be shot in Paris and Singapore based on the 1959 novel, \"Cinq Gars Pour Singapour\" by Jean Bruce and was tentatively called \"OSS117 Goes to Singapore\", but was released as \"Cinq Gars Pour Singapour\" (Five Ashore in Singapore.).\n\nHe returned to Vietnam. In November 1966 he was credited with saving an Australian platoon from being decimated by a mine by identifying that mine while photographing the troops near Vung Tau.\n\nHe made a parachute jump with the 1st Brigade, 101st Airborne Division in December 1966.\n\nIn February 1967 he and Hamilton went on a skiing holiday in Lebanon.\n\nIn 1967, he went to Israel to cover the Arab-Israeli war of 1967.\n\nHe returned to Vietnam in 1968, after the Tet offensive.\n\nIn September 1968 he was working as a cameraman for CBS when he was injured slightly by grenade fragments while shooting a battle between US and enemy forces 85 miles south of Danang.\n\nHe went to Cambodia in early 1970, when news broke of North Vietnamese advances into that country.\n\nOn April 6, 1970, Flynn and a group of journalists left the city of Phnom Penh to attend a government sponsored press conference in Saigon. Flynn (who was freelancing) and fellow photojournalist Dana Stone (who was on assignment for CBS News) chose to travel on motorcycles instead of the limousines that the majority of the other journalists were traveling in (the limousines had been previously used by tourists before the journalists took them over). Reporter Steve Bell, who was one of the last Westerners to see the two alive, later said that after the press conference, Flynn and Stone had gotten word that there was a checkpoint on Highway 1 manned by members of the Viet Cong. Eager to get a photograph of the Viet Cong, Flynn and Stone decided to set out on Highway 1 alone. Before they left, Bell snapped the last known photo ever taken of Flynn and Stone.\n\nFour other journaliststwo Frenchmen and two Japanesehad also been captured by the Viet Cong inside Cambodia on the same day. By June 1970, 25 journalists had been captured in Cambodia in the previous three weeks. Three had been killed, some returned and others missing.\n\nFlynn and Stone were never seen or heard from again and their bodies have never been found.\n\nAlthough it is known that Flynn and Stone were captured by Viet Cong guerrillas at a checkpoint on Highway 1, their true fate is unknown. It has been suggested that they died in the hands of \"hostile\" forces. Citing various government sources, the current consensus is that Flynn and Stone were held captive for over a year before they were killed by the Khmer Rouge in June 1971.\n\nFlynn's mother, Lili Damita, spent an enormous amount of money searching for her son, with no success. In 1984 she had him declared legally dead. She died in 1994.\n\nIn March 2010, a British team searching for Flynn's body thought they had found it, when they uncovered the remains of a Western hostage allegedly executed by the Khmer Rouge. Test results on the human remains found at the grave site in eastern Kampong Cham province, Cambodia, were released on June 30, 2010, and they were found not to be the remains of Sean Flynn. Lt. Col. Wayne Perry of the Joint POW/MIA Accounting Command (JPAC) said there was no match between DNA from the recovered remains and DNA samples they had on file from the Flynn family.\n\nThe story of Sean Flynn was recounted by The Clash in the song \"Sean Flynn\" from the album \"Combat Rock\".\n\nFlynn has a prominent role in Michael Herr's book about his experiences as a war correspondent, \"Dispatches\".\n\nFlynn was portrayed by Kevin Dillon in the 1992 British/Australian miniseries \"Frankie's House\", based on a book by Flynn's friend and colleague, photojournalist Tim Page.\n\nIn August 2008, \"The Hollywood Reporter\" announced that Mythic Films had optioned the rights to the Perry Deane Young memoir, \"Two of the Missing\". At that time, Young was working on a screenplay with director Ralph Hemecker.\n\nIn 2011, a film inspired by Sean Flynn as a photojournalist entitled \"The Road to Freedom\" was filmed on Location in Cambodia by Director Brendan Moriarty \n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "885179", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=885179", "title": "Steve Peregrin Took", "text": "Steve Peregrin Took\n\nSteve Peregrin Took (born Stephen Ross Porter; 28 July 1949 – 27 October 1980) was an English musician and songwriter. He is best known for his membership of the duo Tyrannosaurus Rex with Marc Bolan. After breaking with Bolan, he concentrated on his own singer-songwriting activities, variously as a solo artist or as a frontman for several bands.\n\nTook was born Stephen Ross Porter in Eltham, London, on 28 July 1949, and attended Shooters Hill School. He took his name from the hobbit Peregrin Took in J. R. R. Tolkien's \"The Lord of the Rings\". At the age of 17, having played drums for some months with a mod band named the Waterproof Sparrows (bass player John Rains), he answered an advert in \"Melody Maker\" for Tyrannosaurus Rex, the electric band that Marc Bolan was forming following his departure from John's Children. After one disastrous concert at the Electric Garden in London, Bolan and Took reduced the band to a duo, busking in subways on acoustic guitar and bongos, Took having been obliged to sell his full drum kit to pay the rent until paying gigs started to come in.\n\nThe flower-power unit, championed by John Peel onto the club and stage circuit and thence into the record shops, released three albums and achieved two top 40 hits. Took contributed harmony backing vocals, which are more noticeable in live recordings than on studio recordings, and provided bongos, African drums, kazoo, pixiphone, and Chinese gong. Took's arrangements contributed to transforming Bolan's music from the straightforward rock 'n roll it had previously been into an exotic brew of musical styles designed to appeal to Bolan's new audience of hippies. Towards the end of his time in the band, as Bolan began returning to the electric guitar, Took returned to a full drum set and also contributed some bass guitar parts.\n\nThe band’s producer Tony Visconti credited Took with much of the sound and success of Tyrannosaurus Rex. In an interview for the documentary “Marc Bolan: The Final Word”, Visconti opined that “Marc and Steve were a true 50:50 partnership. Steve was a remarkable musician, he could play many instruments. He played percussion, he could pick up a bass or a guitar. He would also sometimes play some cello parts. And then his backing vocals were great too.” \n\nTook developed his own songwriting and in early 1969, with recording just complete on Tyrannosaurus Rex's third LP, \"Unicorn\", Took suggested to Bolan that the duo could perform some of his own material; Bolan refused. By this time, their lifestyles were in direct conflict. Bolan was living quietly with wife-to-be June Child, while Took was rapidly forging links with \"revolutionary\" underground acts, such as The Deviants and The Pretty Things. The relationship was deteriorating badly—Bolan barely tolerated Took's drug use, and Steve Mann recalled that it was clear they \"cordially detested each other\".\n\nIn addition, Took's friendship with Bolan's idol Syd Barrett had also developed through their shared interests in both LSD and \"strange musical noises\". Mick Farren, in his memoir \"Give The Anarchist A Cigarette\", recalled that Took would \"drag a bemused Syd Barrett along\" to events in Ladbroke Grove in the late 1960s; Took remained friends with Barrett well into the 1970s. Took worked with Syd Barrett on unreleased \"Ramadan\" tracks. While in Tyrannosaurus Rex, Took also appeared as a backing vocalist on a session for David Bowie, the results of which can be heard on the BBC sessions album \"Bowie at the Beeb\".\n\nEventually, Took donated two of his songs - Three Little Piggies and The Sparrow Is A Sign - to former Tomorrow and Pretty Things drummer Twink's 1969 solo album, \"Think Pink\".\nConsequently, before the first Tyrannosaurus Rex tour of America, Bolan and his management sacked Took. Another contributing factor was an incident at the launch party for the UK edition of \"Rolling Stone\", where jugs of punch prepared for the event were spiked with the hallucinogen STP. Took had already earned himself the nickname \"The Phantom Spiker\" (in which he rejoiced) through previous similar pranks. Bolan was severely affected by the spiked drink and considered Took to be the prime suspect.\n\nTook was contractually obliged to go on the US tour, but his heart was not in it and he attempted to cope through taking drugs. Additionally, the acoustic duo were overshadowed by the loud electric acts they were billed with. To counter this, he drew from the shock rock style of Iggy Pop; as Took explained to the NME in 1972 \"I took my shirt off in the Sunset Strip where we were playing and whipped myself till everybody shut up. With a belt, y'know, a bit of blood and the whole of Los Angeles shuts up. 'What's going on, man, there's some nutter attacking himself on stage.' I mean, Iggy Stooge had the same basic approach.\" This allowed the management to claim subsequently that it was Took's behaviour on stage which had caused the sacking. Bolan replaced Took with Mickey Finn, and after one further album renamed the duo T. Rex, later expanding to a full band again.\n\nAfter being sacked by Bolan, Took formed a prototype version of the Pink Fairies with Twink and Mick Farren, recently ousted from his own band, the Deviants. This band was named in honour of a drinking club of the same name the three had formed earlier that year, along with other leading lights of the underground scene. Together with Twink's girlfriend Silva Darling, they performed what Farren would later describe as \"less of a gig than a protracted harangue\" at the University of Manchester in October 1969, which rapidly dissolved into chaos. Took appeared prominently on Farren's first solo album \"Mona – The Carnivorous Circus\" (recorded December 1969, released 1970). Twink and the other ex-Deviants then formed a new band called the Pink Fairies (mark 2), without Took or Farren.\n\nIn February 1970, Farren and Took headhunted guitarist Larry (or \"Lazza\") Wallis and bassist Tim Taylor from their underground band, the Entire Sioux Nation. A month later, Farren dropped out, leaving Took in the role of bandleader for the first time in his career. With the addition of drummer Phil Lenoir, Shagrat was formed (named after an orc in \"The Lord of the Rings\"). They recorded three tracks, \"Peppermint Flickstick\", \"Boo! I Said Freeze\" and \"Steel Abortion\", at Strawberry Studios and played live at the Phun City festival, before Lenoir and Taylor left. Took and Wallis continued with drummer Dave Bidwell, rehearsing with various bass players and eventually forming an acoustic trio of Took on vocals and guitar, Wallis on acoustic bass and Bidwell on tambourine. This line-up recorded a set of (at least) four home demos, \"Amanda\", \"Strange Sister\", \"Still Yawning Stillborn\" and \"Beautiful Deceiver\", at Wallis's father's home studio in South London, which in the 1990s would be paired with the earlier electric studio session for limited edition vinyl release and later a CD album release in 2001.\n\nWallis would later take over the leadership of the Pink Fairies for their \"Kings of Oblivion\" LP, substantially transforming the sound and style of the band. He and Took would work together again at various intervals in 1972, 1975–76 and 1977.\n\nWith Wallis and Bidwell otherwise committed to UFO and Savoy Brown respectively, the acoustic Shagrat was effectively reduced down to just Took himself performing solo on an acoustic guitar, usually sitting on a stool interspersing his songs with jokes and other onstage monologues. In this format, Took made some headway as a live performer. \"Tookie\" appeared in frequent support slots for Hawkwind and the Pink Fairies, attracting some coverage in the UK music press and even performing a live session on Steve Bradshaw's \"Breakthrough\" programme on BBC Radio London. In December 1971, he headlined a three-date mini-tour of southwest England.\n\nHe also performed at various benefit events, including the \"Nasty Balls\" benefits for the Nasty Tales magazine (whose editors, including Farren, were on trial for obscenity) as well as the 1972 Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament festival at Aldermaston, Steve's account of which was reprinted by Charles Shaar Murray in his book \"Shots From The Hip\". Writing for the NME in 1972, Murray described Took and his stage act thus: \"Most people know who Steve Peregrine Took is, but few people know what he does. A few more know him as a somewhat bizarre figure who materialises at concerts, armed only with an Epiphone guitar, and performs a freeform set of songs, raps, jokes and anything else that flashes through his mind.\"\n\nDuring this time, Took could also often be seen participating in jamming sessions during encores at Hawkwind and Pink Fairies concerts. His contributions to these jams were in the role of third drummer, and he also once played bass guitar for the \"Pinks\", substituting for Duncan Sanderson.\n\nDuring 1972, Took was approached by Tony Secunda, recently fired as manager for T. Rex, with a view to recovering royalties owed to Took from the Tyrannosaurus Rex years. Emerging from these conversations, Secunda became Took's manager, with a view to leading him to stardom to spite Bolan. Initially, Took attempted to rerecord as a single the song \"Amanda\" from the 1971 acoustic Shagrat session (along with two other tracks, \"Blind Owl Blues\" and \"Mr Discrete\") with the assistance of the Pink Fairies rhythm section of Sanderson and Russell Hunter, whose band was temporarily defunct following the departure of Paul Rudolph. During this session, former Junior's Eyes/Bowie guitarist Mick Wayne was recruited as guitarist.\n\nHowever, none of these tracks were ever completed to Took's satisfaction, due to what Wayne later described as \"dope-induced thinking\" and consequently, Wayne, Sanderson and Hunter formed a new incarnation of the Pink Fairies. (Wayne was quickly supplanted by Wallis, leading to the Kings of Oblivion era as detailed above). Took and Secunda, meanwhile, embarked upon a different approach.\n\nTook moved into a basement flat beneath Secunda's Mayfair offices, which he set up as a live-in recording studio to demo material at his own ease. The flat rapidly became a magnet for the cream of musicians on the underground scene, who would contribute to the recordings while visiting Took. As well as old colleagues from Hawkwind and the Pink Fairies, Secunda reported that Took received visits from Syd Barrett, who at the time was living in Cambridge, but would shortly relocate back to London. From Secunda's account, it would appear likely that Barrett is on the recordings done in the flat by Took and his friends.\n\nHighlights of the session tapes were eventually released by Cleopatra Records in 1995, as \"The Missing Link To Tyrannosaurus Rex\". A new version of the 1971 acoustic Shagrat song \"Beautiful Deceiver\" is tracklisted on the CD as \"Syd's Wine\" and a credit for guitar and other noises is given to one Crazy Diamond, an allusion to the 1975 Pink Floyd track \"Shine On You Crazy Diamond\", written in tribute to Barrett. Stripped down versions of the track \"Syd's Wine\" reveal a second guitarist in the room and audible vocal noises.\n\nAfter splitting with Secunda, Took worked with a number of Hawkwind members, most notably Robert Calvert, Adrian Wagner, and Nik Turner. Took was scheduled to be the support act for Calvert's cancelled \"Captain Lockheed and the Starfighters\" tour. He and Bidwell formed at least two bands, the first with guitarist Eisuke Takahashi, the second with guitarist Hiroshi Kato and future Hawkwind bassist Adrian Shaw. The latter line-up recorded a session of four tracks in summer 1974 including Flophouse Blues (previously recorded twice in the 1972 Secunda sessions)\n\nFor some time around 1975, Took lived in the Kent towns of Canterbury and Margate, where he took on local musician and promoter Les Best as his manager. While down there, Took formed a new band, Jolly Roger And The Crimson Gash, with Takahashi now on bass and two local musicians, Brian East on drums and a guitarist called Phil. This band gigged locally and recorded at least four tracks, produced by Turner at his home studio in Westgate on Sea.\n\nBy 1976, Took was back in London and using the bandname Steve Took's Horns, so called after a horned pendant which he habitually wore. By mid 1977, this had solidified into a steady line-up featuring, in what would be the first of several bands together over many years, Trevor Thoms and Ermanno Ghisio-Erba, later better known to Inner City Unit (ICU) fans as Judge Trev and Dino Ferari.\n\nThis group, managed by Turner's friend since adolescence Tony Landau, recorded a session of three studio tracks – It's Over, Average Man and Woman I Need – at Pathway Studios on 29 November 1977, before going on to perform a gig on 18 June 1978 at The Roundhouse, as part of \"Nik Turner's Bohemian Love-In\". Took felt the gig went badly, and decide to split up the band. The Pathway Studios session would be released on CD by Cherry Red in 2004, as \"Blow It!!! The All New Adventures of Steve Took's Horns\", with the CD also featuring out-takes, remixes and fresh recordings of two other Took songs – Ooh My Heart and Too Bad – which the Horns had been rehearsing.\n\nDespite the break-up, Steve Took's Horns had made a considerable impression on Took's circle of acquaintances. Consequently, Nik Turner, having first drafted Ghisio-Erba/Ferari into his band Sphynx for a live festival LP recorded that August, went on in 1979 to incorporate the Thoms/Ghisio-Erba partnership into his new Inner City Unit.\n\nTook guested with ICU a number of times, reuniting with his old Horns sidemen; the last recorded dates being 16 June 1980 at London's Music Machine and sometime around 21 June 1980 at the Stonehenge Free Festival in Wiltshire – a festival frequented by other 'Festival Bands', most famously Took's old Ladbroke Grove cohorts Hawkwind. Bootleg recordings exist of the above-mentioned Music Machine show and also an open-air performance on 6 May 1980 at Meanwhile Gardens in Notting Hill Gate, on both of which Took can be heard performing lead vocals on a cover of The Beatles' version of Larry Williams' \"Slow Down\"\n\nTook had one son in the early 1970s with partner Lindsay Tunstall aka Lou, later the partner of Landau. Took also had relationships with, among others, Valerie \"Sam\" Billiet (1979-1980) drug baroness Gertrude de Freyne (1977-1978), a woman called Angie (1969-1971) and Tracy Inder, the mother of Lemmy's son Paul Inder, to whom Took was a stepfather figure during the relationship (1974-1976.) as he later also was to Billiet's daughter.\n\nSteve Took died on Monday 27 October 1980 at 14 Clydesdale House, 255 Westbourne Park Road, Notting Hill, London W11 1ED, aged 31, in the maisonette he shared with Billiet and her young daughter. As a consequence of intervention by Best, now once again Took's manager, royalty cheques for the Tyrannosaurus Rex 'Blue Thumb' American releases had been arriving periodically, and Took had received one that week. The day prior to his death, Took purchased morphine and hallucinogenic mushrooms for himself and Billiet, and the evening before Took died, they both injected themselves with the morphine. Took's death certificate records the cause of death as being asphyxiation after inhaling a cocktail cherry. Drugs were not listed as a contributory factor, even though Took's death is often listed as a \"drugs misadventure\". He was buried in Kensal Green Cemetery (Square 103, in the north-west quadrant of the infilled path around the Inner Circle).\n\n\n\nAs a singer songwriter, Took's two main guitars were an Epiphone acoustic guitar decorated with stickers (including one of Eddie Cochran) used for solo work, last known to have been in the possession of Billiet, and an electric Rickenbacker used as a rhythm guitar with Took's electric bands, currently owned by Best. Both guitars feature prominently in Keith Morris' early 1970s publicity photographs of Took.\n\nPreviously as a member of Tyrannosaurus Rex, Took's percussion and other equipment included bongos, tabla, finger cymbals, African talking drum, kazoos, a Chinese gong and a Pixiphone (toy xylophone). As the duo reverted to electric music in early 1969, Took also played a Höfner 500/1 bass and a Chad Valley toy drumkit. In later years, when performing solo support gigs for Hawkwind, Took would often include his bongos as part of his equipment itinery. so that, later in the evening, he could guest with Hawkwind on a few songs in their set.\n\n"}
{"id": "27695", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27695", "title": "Structured programming", "text": "Structured programming\n\nStructured programming is a programming paradigm aimed at improving the clarity, quality, and development time of a computer program by making extensive use of the structured control flow constructs of selection (if/then/else) and repetition (while and for), block structures, and subroutines.\n\nIt emerged in the late 1950s with the appearance of the ALGOL 58 and ALGOL 60 programming languages, with the latter including support for block structures. Contributing factors to its popularity and widespread acceptance, at first in academia and later among practitioners, include the discovery of what is now known as the structured program theorem in 1966, and the publication of the influential \"Go To Statement Considered Harmful\" open letter in 1968 by Dutch computer scientist Edsger W. Dijkstra, who coined the term \"structured programming\".\n\nStructured programming is most frequently used with deviations that allow for clearer programs in some particular cases, such as when exception handling has to be performed.\n\nFollowing the structured program theorem, all programs are seen as composed of control structures:\n\nSubroutines; callable units such as procedures, functions, methods, or subprograms are used to allow a sequence to be referred to by a single statement.\n\nBlocks are used to enable groups of statements to be treated as if they were one statement. \"Block-structured\" languages have a syntax for enclosing structures in some formal way, such as an if-statement bracketed by codice_6 as in ALGOL 68, or a code section bracketed by codice_7, as in PL/I and Pascal, whitespace indentation as in Python - or the curly braces codice_8 of C and many later languages.\n\nIt is possible to do structured programming in any programming language, though it is preferable to use something like a procedural programming language. Some of the languages initially used for structured programming include: ALGOL, Pascal, PL/I and Ada, but most new procedural programming languages since that time have included features to encourage structured programming, and sometimes deliberately left out features – notably GOTO – in an effort to make unstructured programming more difficult.\n\"Structured programming\" (sometimes known as modular programming) enforces a logical structure on the program being written to make it more efficient and easier to understand and modify.\n\nThe structured program theorem provides the theoretical basis of structured programming. It states that three ways of combining programs—sequencing, selection, and iteration—are sufficient to express any computable function. This observation did not originate with the structured programming movement; these structures are sufficient to describe the instruction cycle of a central processing unit, as well as the operation of a Turing machine. Therefore, a processor is always executing a \"structured program\" in this sense, even if the instructions it reads from memory are not part of a structured program. However, authors usually credit the result to a 1966 paper by Böhm and Jacopini, possibly because Dijkstra cited this paper himself. The structured program theorem does not address how to write and analyze a usefully structured program. These issues were addressed during the late 1960s and early 1970s, with major contributions by Dijkstra, Robert W. Floyd, Tony Hoare, Ole-Johan Dahl, and David Gries.\n\nP. J. Plauger, an early adopter of structured programming, described his reaction to the structured program theorem:\n\nDonald Knuth accepted the principle that programs must be written with provability in mind, but he disagreed (and still disagrees) with abolishing the GOTO statement. In his 1974 paper, \"Structured Programming with Goto Statements\", he gave examples where he believed that a direct jump leads to clearer and more efficient code without sacrificing provability. Knuth proposed a looser structural constraint: It should be possible to draw a program's flow chart with all forward branches on the left, all backward branches on the right, and no branches crossing each other. Many of those knowledgeable in compilers and graph theory have advocated allowing only reducible flow graphs.\n\nStructured programming theorists gained a major ally in the 1970s after IBM researcher Harlan Mills applied his interpretation of structured programming theory to the development of an indexing system for \"The New York Times\" research file. The project was a great engineering success, and managers at other companies cited it in support of adopting structured programming, although Dijkstra criticized the ways that Mills's interpretation differed from the published work.\n\nAs late as 1987 it was still possible to raise the question of structured programming in a computer science journal. Frank Rubin did so in that year with an open letter titled \"\"GOTO considered harmful\" considered harmful\". Numerous objections followed, including a response from Dijkstra that sharply criticized both Rubin and the concessions other writers made when responding to him.\n\nBy the end of the 20th century nearly all computer scientists were convinced that it is useful to learn and apply the concepts of structured programming. High-level programming languages that originally lacked programming structures, such as FORTRAN, COBOL, and BASIC, now have them.\n\nWhile goto has now largely been replaced by the structured constructs of selection (if/then/else) and repetition (while and for), few languages are purely structured. The most common deviation, found in many languages, is the use of a return statement for early exit from a subroutine. This results in multiple exit points, instead of the single exit point required by structured programming. There are other constructions to handle cases that are awkward in purely structured programming.\n\nThe most common deviation from structured programming is early exit from a function or loop. At the level of functions, this is a codice_9 statement. At the level of loops, this is a codice_10 statement (terminate the loop) or codice_11 statement (terminate the current iteration, proceed with next iteration). In structured programming, these can be replicated by adding additional branches or tests, but for returns from nested code this can add significant complexity. C is an early and prominent example of these constructs. Some newer languages also have \"labeled breaks\", which allow breaking out of more than just the innermost loop. Exceptions also allow early exit, but have further consequences, and thus are treated below.\n\nMultiple exits can arise for a variety of reasons, most often either that the subroutine has no more work to do (if returning a value, it has completed the calculation), or has encountered \"exceptional\" circumstances that prevent it from continuing, hence needing exception handling.\n\nThe most common problem in early exit is that cleanup or final statements are not executed – for example, allocated memory is not deallocated, or open files are not closed, causing memory leaks or resource leaks. These must be done at each return site, which is brittle and can easily result in bugs. For instance, in later development, a return statement could be overlooked by a developer, and an action which should be performed at the end of a subroutine (e.g., a trace statement) might not be performed in all cases. Languages without a return statement, such as standard Pascal, do not have this problem.\n\nMost modern languages provide language-level support to prevent such leaks; see detailed discussion at resource management. Most commonly this is done via unwind protection, which ensures that certain code is guaranteed to be run when execution exits a block; this is a structured alternative to having a cleanup block and a codice_12. This is most often known as codice_13 and considered a part of exception handling. Various techniques exist to encapsulate resource management. An alternative approach, found primarily in C++, is Resource Acquisition Is Initialization, which uses normal stack unwinding (variable deallocation) at function exit to call destructors on local variables to deallocate resources.\n\nKent Beck, Martin Fowler and co-authors have argued in their refactoring books that nested conditionals may be harder to understand than a certain type of flatter structure using multiple exits predicated by guard clauses. Their 2009 book flatly states that \"one exit point is really not a useful rule. Clarity is the key principle: If the method is clearer with one exit point, use one exit point; otherwise don’t\". They offer a cookbook solution for transforming a function consisting only of nested conditionals into a sequence of guarded return (or throw) statements, followed by a single unguarded block, which is intended to contain the code for the common case, while the guarded statements are supposed to deal with the less common ones (or with errors). Herb Sutter and Andrei Alexandrescu also argue in their 2004 C++ tips book that the single-exit point is an obsolete requirement.\n\nIn his 2004 textbook, David Watt writes that \"single-entry multi-exit control flows are often desirable\". Using Tennent's framework notion of sequencer, Watt uniformly describes the control flow constructs found in contemporary programming languages and attempts to explain why certain types of sequencers are preferable to others in the context of multi-exit control flows. Watt writes that unrestricted gotos (jump sequencers) are bad because the destination of the jump is not self-explanatory to the reader of a program until the reader finds and examines the actual label or address that is the target of the jump. In contrast, Watt argues that the conceptual intent of a return sequencer is clear from its own context, without having to examine its destination. Watt writes that a class of sequencers known as \"escape sequencers\", defined as a \"sequencer that terminates execution of a textually enclosing command or procedure\", encompasses both breaks from loops (including multi-level breaks) and return statements. Watt also notes that while jump sequencers (gotos) have been somewhat restricted in languages like C, where the target must be an inside the local block or an encompassing outer block, that restriction alone is not sufficient to make the intent of gotos in C self-describing and so they can still produce \"spaghetti code\". Watt also examines how exception sequencers differ from escape and jump sequencers; this is explained in the next section of this article.\n\nIn contrast to the above, Bertrand Meyer wrote in his 2009 textbook that instructions like codice_10 and codice_11 \"are just the old codice_12 in sheep's clothing\" and strongly advised against their use.\n\nBased on the coding error from the Ariane 501 disaster, software developer Jim Bonang argues that any exceptions thrown from a function violate the single-exit paradigm, and proposes that all inter-procedural exceptions should be forbidden. In C++ syntax, this is done by declaring all function signatures as codice_17 (since C++11) or codice_18. Bonang proposes that all single-exit conforming C++ should be written along the lines of:\n\nPeter Ritchie also notes that, in principle, even a single codice_19 right before the codice_9 in a function constitutes a violation of the single-exit principle, but argues that Dijkstra's rules were written in a time before exception handling became a paradigm in programming languages, so he proposes to allow any number of throw points in addition to a single return point. He notes that solutions which wrap exceptions for the sake of creating a single-exit have higher nesting depth and thus are more difficult to comprehend, and even accuses those who propose to apply such solutions to programming languages which support exceptions of engaging in cargo cult thinking.\n\nDavid Watt also analyzes exception handling in the framework of sequencers (introduced in this article in the previous section on early exits.) Watt notes that an abnormal situation (generally exemplified with arithmetic \noverflows or input/output failures like file not found) is a kind of error that \"is detected in some low-level program unit, but [for which] a handler is more naturally located in a high-level program unit\". For example, a program might contain several calls to read files, but the action to perform when a file is not found depends on the meaning (purpose) of the file in question to the program and thus a handling routine for this abnormal situation cannot be located in low-level system code. Watts further notes that introducing status flags testing in the caller, as single-exit structured programming or even (multi-exit) return sequencers would entail, results in a situation where \"the application code tends to get cluttered by tests of status flags\" and that \"the programmer might forgetfully or lazily omit to test a status flag. In fact, abnormal situations represented by status flags are by default ignored!\" He notes that in contrast to status flags testing, exceptions have the opposite default behavior, causing the program to terminate unless the programmer explicitly deals with the exception in some way, possibly by adding code to willfully ignore it. Based on these arguments, Watt concludes that jump sequencers or escape sequencers (discussed in the previous section) aren't as suitable as a dedicated exception sequencer with the semantics discussed above.\n\nThe textbook by Louden and Lambert emphasizes that exception handling differs from structured programming constructs like codice_2 loops because the transfer of control \"is set up at a different point in the program than that where the actual transfer takes place. At the point where the transfer actually occurs, there may be no syntactic indication that control will in fact be transferred.\" Computer science professor Arvind Kumar Bansal also notes that in languages which implement exception handling, even control structures like codice_4, which have the single-exit property in absence of exceptions, no longer have it in presence of exceptions, because an exception can prematurely cause an early exit in any part of the control structure; for instance if codice_23 throws an exception in codice_24, then the usual exit point after check() is not reached. Citing multiple prior studies by others (1999-2004) and their own results, Westley Weimer and George Necula wrote that a significant problem with exceptions is that they \"create hidden control-flow paths that are difficult for programmers to reason about\".\n\nThe necessity to limit code to single-exit points appears in some contemporary programming environments focused on parallel computing, such as OpenMP. The various parallel constructs from OpenMP, like codice_25, do not allow early exits from inside to the outside of the parallel construct; this restriction includes all manner of exits, from codice_10 to C++ exceptions, but all of these are permitted inside the parallel construct if the jump target is also inside it.\n\nMore rarely, subprograms allow multiple \"entry.\" This is most commonly only \"re\"-entry into a coroutine (or generator/semicoroutine), where a subprogram yields control (and possibly a value), but can then be resumed where it left off. There are a number of common uses of such programming, notably for streams (particularly input/output), state machines, and concurrency. From a code execution point of view, yielding from a coroutine is closer to structured programming than returning from a subroutine, as the subprogram has not actually terminated, and will continue when called again – it is not an early exit. However, coroutines mean that multiple subprograms have execution state – rather than a single call stack of subroutines – and thus introduce a different form of complexity.\n\nIt is very rare for subprograms to allow entry to an arbitrary position in the subprogram, as in this case the program state (such as variable values) is uninitialized or ambiguous, and this is very similar to a goto.\n\nSome programs, particularly parsers and communications protocols, have a number of states that follow each other in a way that is not easily reduced to the basic structures, and some programmers implement the state-changes with a jump to the new state. This type of state-switching is often used in the Linux kernel.\n\nHowever, it is possible to structure these systems by making each state-change a separate subprogram and using a variable to indicate the active state (see trampoline). Alternatively, these can be implemented via coroutines, which dispense with the trampoline.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "30044455", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30044455", "title": "Therapeutic abortion", "text": "Therapeutic abortion\n\nTherapeutic abortion is abortion induced following a diagnosis of medical necessity. Such abortions are carried out in order to avoid the risk of substantial harm to the mother or in cases of fetal unviability. In many countries therapeutic abortion is legal, including some where elective abortion is illegal.\n\nAccording to Robert E. Cooke, the word therapeutic means “pertaining to treatment or healing.” The word \"abortion\" in biology means \"the arrested development of an embryo or an organ at a more or less early stage.\"\n\nMany therapeutic abortions are performed today, with some degree of controversy regarding the quality of life, if the baby has a genetic condition which is thought likely to lead to a shorter life than that of a healthy child (among such conditions would be: severe cases of certain genetic conditions, conditions which entail the inability of certain vital organs such as the heart or liver to function without sustained support which are not amenable to surgical repair or transplantation, severe cases of profound mental impairment, the lack of portions of the brainstem or the higher brain, such as the cerebral hemispheres, or anencephaly, among others). \n\nThere is little evidence that a pregnancy with a disabled child is any more dangerous for the mother than that with a healthy child. All pregnancies pose some risk to maternal health, but it is extremely rare that a problem with the baby's health significantly increases the risk to the mother's health. In the vast majority of cases, pregnancies with babies with abnormalities progress without any extra risk to the mother. Hence the controversy of using the term \"therapeutic abortion\" as a justification for aborting a baby with abnormalities. Dangers in pregnancy to a mother's health normally are the result of some underlying medical condition of the mother's alone [citation needed]. \n\nIn developed countries in the West (i.e., most European countries and the United States, among others), the state of medical care for those pregnant women or those women who could become pregnant (who can get access to affordable contemporary care and are given it in a timely manner) is such the rare cases that would pose an indisputable threat to the mother's life (e.g., most cases of ectopic pregnancy, uterine cancer, and certain other causes) this can be diagnosed in a timely enough manner that a medical or surgical therapeutic abortion is performed before the situation becomes medically unstable. That is decidedly not the case in remote areas of the Third World (many areas of Asia and sub-Saharan Africa) with little access to advanced medical care, or in areas (or social, relational, and familial situations) where a woman's right to emergency medical care is violated. Many secular and religious ethical codes- even those that consider other abortions to be extremely immoral- will usually allow for an abortion, under the principle of double effect, where the medical crisis is the result of a natural biological phenomenon and is absolutely necessary to save the woman's life; disagreement persists, however, about what does or does not constitute an ethical justification for a non-elective therapeutic abortion, particularly regarding genetic disorders or mental impairment. There are many situations in which therapeutic abortions are performed that do not involve a grave threat to the pregnant woman's life, mobility, or physical health, and there are many cases where therapeutic abortions are performed in situations where the embryo or fetus is capable of surviving outside the mother's body, with or without assistance or significant impairments. In some developed societies, merely a pregnant woman's stated desire to terminate her pregnancy is the only criterion necessary for an abortion to be deemed \"therapeutic\", though this should not be confused with a therapeutic abortion performed because of a medical emergency.\n\nIn many societies, a woman could only have as many children as she and her husband could provide for. Since contraceptives first had their commercial boom in the 20th century, it was difficult for women to take preventative actions against getting pregnant. In the present day, it is still difficult for many women to obtain proper contraceptives because of the economic situation of themselves or their country. In cases where a woman is pregnant but could not provide for the child, it would often be considered necessary to abort the baby to save the other children from starvation. For example, a study was done in Tuscany, Italy in 1427 that showed that the number of children per family had a direct correlation to the “economic curve and survival conditions.\n\nEven in the 21st century there are still areas of the world that are in this situation. The nomadic hunter/gatherer people of the Kalahari Desert in Africa, called the Bushmen, can’t have another child until their next oldest one is weaned from its mother’s breast milk, which can be up to the age of 3 or 4. If a woman does get pregnant she “must think of the child she has already and act quickly,\" before her love of her baby renders her incapable of killing it and forces her to “wait and watch both of her children die.”\n\nParis said that “the universal desire among women to control births expresses today, as it always has, the knowledge that survival depends on the ability to give each child what it needs for its full development, whether it be the survival of a mother, a family, or a community.”\n\n\n"}

Ince\n\nThomas Harper Ince (November 16, 1880 – November 19, 1924) was an American silent film producer, director, screenwriter, and actor.\nInce was known as the \"Father of the Western\" and was responsible for making over 800 films. He revolutionized the motion picture industry by creating the first major Hollywood studio facility and invented movie production by introducing the \"assembly line\" system of filmmaking. He was the first mogul to build his own film studio dubbed \"Inceville\" in Palisades Highlands. Ince was also instrumental in developing the role of the producer in motion pictures. Two of his films, \"The Italian\" (1915), for which he wrote the screenplay, and \"Civilization\" (1916), which he directed, were selected for preservation by the National Film Registry. He later entered into a partnership with D.W. Griffith and Mack Sennett to form the Triangle Motion Picture Company, whose studios are the present-day site of Sony Pictures. He then built a new studio about a mile from Triangle, which is now the site of Culver Studios. Ince's untimely death at the height of his career, after he became severely ill aboard the private yacht of media tycoon William Randolph Hearst, has caused much speculation, although the official cause of his death was heart failure.\n\nThomas Harper Ince was born on November 16, 1880 in Newport, Rhode Island, the middle of three sons and a daughter raised by English immigrants, John E. and Emma Ince. His father was born in Wigan, Lancashire, England, in 1841, and was the youngest of nine boys who enlisted in the British Navy as a \"powder monkey\". He later disembarked at San Francisco, and found work as a reporter and coal miner. Around 1887, when Ince was about seven, the family moved to Manhattan to pursue theater work. Ince's father worked as both an actor and musical agent and his mother, Ince himself, sister Bertha and brothers, John and Ralph all worked as actors. Ince made his Broadway debut at 15 in a small role of a revival 1893 play, \"Shore Acres\" by James A. Herne. He appeared with several stock companies as a child and was later an office boy for theatrical manager Daniel Frohman. He later formed an unsuccessful Vaudeville company known as \"Thomas H. Ince and His Comedians\" in Atlantic Highlands, New Jersey. In 1907, Ince met actress Elinor Kershaw (\"Nell\") and they were married on October 19 of that year. They had three children.\n\nInce's directing career began in 1910 through a chance encounter in New York City with an employee from his old acting troupe, William S. Hart. Ince found his first film work as an actor for the Biograph Company, directed by his future partner, D.W. Griffith. Griffith was impressed enough with Ince to hire him as a Production coordinator at Biograph. This led to more work coordinating productions at Carl Laemmle's Independent Motion Pictures Co. (IMP). That same year, a director at IMP was unable to complete work on a small feature film, so in moment of bravado, Ince suggested to IMP's owner Laemmle of hiring him as a full-time director to complete the film. Impressed with the young man, Laemmle sent him to Cuba to make one-reel shorts with his new stars, Mary Pickford and Owen Moore, out of the reach of Thomas Edison's Motion Picture Patents Company-—the trust that was attempting to crush all independent production companies and corner the market on film production. Ince's output, however, was small. And, although he tackled many different subjects, he was strongly drawn to Westerns and American Civil War dramas.\n\nClashes between the trust and independent films became exacerbated, so Ince moved to California to escape these pressures. He hoped to achieve the effects accomplished with minimal facilities like Griffith, which he believed, could only be accomplished in Hollywood. After only a year with IMP, Ince quit. In September 1911, Ince walked into the offices of actor-financier Charles O. Baumann (1874-1931) who co-owned the New York Motion Picture Company (NYMP) with actor-writer Adam Kessel, Jr. (1866-1946). Ince had found out that NYMPC had recently established a West Coast studio named Bison Studios at 1719 Alessandro (now known as Glendale Blvd.) in Edendale (present-day Echo Park) to make westerns and he wanted to direct those pictures.\n\n\"The offer came as a distinct shock, but I kept cool and concealed my excitement. I tried to convey the impression that he would have to raise the ante a trifle if he wanted me. That also worked, and I signed a contract for three months at $150 a week. Very soon after that, with Mrs. Ince, my cameraman, property man and Ethel Grandin, my leading woman, I turned my face westward.\" \n\nTogether with his young wife and a small entourage, Ince moved to Bison Studios to begin work immediately. He was shocked, however, to discover that the studio was nothing more than a \"tract of land graced only by a four-room bungalow and a barn.\"\n\nInce's aspirations soon led him to leave the narrow confines of Edendale and find a location that would give him greater scope and variety. He settled upon a tract of land called \"Bison Ranch\" located at Sunset Blvd. and Pacific Coast Highway in the Santa Monica Mountains, (the present-day location of the Self-Realization Fellowship Lake Shrine) which he rented by the day. By 1912, he had earned enough money to purchase the ranch and was granted permission by NYMP to lease another in the Palisades Highlands stretching up Santa Ynez Canyon between Santa Monica and Malibu where Universal Studios was eventually established, which was owned by The Miller Bros out of Ponca City, Oklahoma. And it was here Ince built his first movie studio.\n\nThe \"Miller 101 Bison Ranch Studio\", which the Millers dubbed \"Inceville\" (and was later re-christened \"Triangle Ranch\") was the first of its kind in that it featured silent stages, production offices, printing labs, a commissary large enough to serve lunch to hundreds of workers, dressing rooms, props houses, elaborate sets, and other necessities - all in one location. While the site was under construction, Ince also leased the 101 Ranch and Wild West Show from the Miller Bros., bringing the whole troupe from Oklahoma out to California via train. The show consisted of 300 cowboys and cowgirls; 600 horses, cattle and other livestock (including steers and bison) and a whole Sioux Indian tribe (200 of them in all) who set up their teepees on the property. They were then renamed \"The Bison-101 Ranch Co.\", and specialized in making westerns released under the name World Famous Features.\n\nWhen construction was completed, the streets were lined with many types of structures, from humble cottages to mansions, mimicking the style and architecture of different countries. Extensive outdoor western sets were built and used on the site for several years. According to Katherine La Hue in her book, \"Pacific Palisades: Where the Mountains Meet the Sea\":\n\n\"Ince invested $35,000 in building, stages and sets ... a bit of Switzerland, a Puritan settlement, a Japanese village ... beyond the breakers, an ancient brigantine weighed anchor, cutlassed men swarming over the sides of the ship, while on the shore performing cowboys galloped about, twirling their lassos in pursuit of errant cattle ... The main herds were kept in the hills, where Ince also raised feed and garden produce. Supplies of every sort were needed to house and feed a veritable army of actors, directors and subordinates.\"\n\nWhile the cowboys, American Indians and assorted workmen lived at \"Inceville\", the main actors came from Los Angeles and other communities as needed, taking the red trolley cars to the Long Wharf at Temescal Canyon, where buckboards conveyed them to the set.\n\nInce lived in a house overlooking the vast studio, later the location of Marquez Knolls. Here he functioned as the central authority over multiple production units, changing the way films were made by organizing production methods into a disciplined system of filmmaking. Indeed, \"Inceville\" became a prototype for Hollywood film studios of the future, with a studio head (Ince), producers, directors, production managers, production staff, and writers all working together under one organization (the unit system) and under the supervision of a General Manager, Fred J. Balshofer.\n\nBefore this, the director and cameraman controlled the production of the picture, but Ince put the producer in charge of the film from inception to final product. He defined the producer's role in both a creative and industrial sense. He was also one of the first to hire a separate screenwriter, director, and editor (instead of the director doing everything themselves). By 1913, the concept of the production manager had been created. With the aid of George Stout, an accountant for NYMP, Ince re-organized how films were outputted to bring discipline to the process. After this adjustment the studio's weekly output increased from one to two, and later three two-reel pictures per week, released under such names as \"Kay-Bee\" (Kessel-Baumann), \"Domino\" (comedy), and \"Broncho\" (western) productions. These were written, produced, cut, and assembled, with the finished product delivered within a week. By enabling more than one film to be made at a time, Ince decentralized the process of movie production to meet the increased demand from theaters. This was the dawning of the assembly-line system that all studios eventually adopted.\n\nWith this model, developed between 1913 and 1918, Ince gradually exercised even more control over the film production process as a director-general. In 1913 alone, he made over 150 two-reeler movies, mostly Westerns, thereby anchoring the popularity of the genre for decades. While many of Ince's films were praised in Europe, many American critics did not share this high opinion. One such picture was \"The Battle of Gettysburg\" (1913) which was five reels long. The picture helped bring into vogue the idea of the feature-length film. Another important early movie for Ince was \"The Italian\" (1915), which depicted immigrant life in Manhattan. Two of his most successful films were among his first, \"War on the Plains\" (1912) and \"Custer's Last Fight\" (1912), which featured many Indians who had actually been in the battle.\n\nEven though he was the first producer-director and directed most of his early productions, by 1913 Ince eventually ceased full-time directing to concentrate on producing, transferring this responsibility to such proteges as Francis Ford and his brother John Ford, Jack Conway, William Desmond Taylor, Reginald Barker, Fred Niblo, Henry King and Frank Borzage. The story was the preeminent aspect of Ince’s pictures. Films such as The Italian, The Gangsters and the Girl (1914), and The Clodhopper (1917) are excellent examples of the dramatic structure that resulted from his masterful editing. Film preservationist David Shepard said of Ince in \"The American Film Heritage\":\n\nInce also discovered many talents, including his old actor friend, William S. Hart, who made some of the best early westerns, beginning in 1914. Later, a rift developed between the two over sharing of profits. Ironically, on January 16, 1916, a few days after the opening of his first Culver City studio, a fire broke out at \"Inceville\", the first of many that eventually destroyed all of the buildings.\nInce later gave up on the studio and sold it to Hart, who renamed it \"Hartville.\" Three years later, Hart sold the lot to Robertson-Cole Pictures Corporation, which continued filming there until 1922. La Hue writes that \"the place was virtually a ghost town when the last remnants of \"Inceville\" were burned on July 4, 1922, leaving only a \"weatherworn old church, which stood sentinel over the charred ruins.\"\n\nBy 1915, Ince was considered one of the best-known producer-directors. Around this time, real estate mogul Harry Culver noticed Ince shooting a western in Ballona Creek. Impressed with his talents, Culver convinced Ince to move from Inceville and re-locate to what was to become Culver City. Taking Culver's advice, Ince left NYMP and on July 19 partnered with D.W. Griffith and Mack Sennett to form The Triangle Motion Picture Company based on their prestige as producers. Triangle (so named because from an aerial point of view the property had a triangular shape) was built at 10202 W. Washington Boulevard (the present-day site of Sony Pictures Studios), which Ince insisted be named \"Ince-Triangle Studios\". Thus, the first Culver City movie studio took shape in the form of a Greek colonnade – the impressive entrance of which still stands today and is an historical landmark.\nWith Ince as its vice-president, Triangle announced that it would focus on feature-length \"epic and quality dramas\". Ince and his partners would charge more money for their prestige pictures based on their reputations as producers. The company was funded by Harry and Roy Aitken, two brothers from the farmlands of Wisconsin who also pioneered the studio system of Hollywood's Golden Age. Harry had been Griffith's partner at Reliance-Majestic Studios, but had been fired by the Mutual Film Corporation as a result the aftermath of Griffith's \"The Birth of a Nation.\" Although a box-office success, the film led to riots in major northern cities due to its controversial content.\n\nTriangle was one of the first vertically integrated film companies. By combining production, distribution, and theater operations under one roof, the partners created the most dynamic studio in Hollywood. They attracted directors and stars of the day, including Pickford, Lillian Gish, Roscoe \"Fatty\" Arbuckle, and Douglas Fairbanks, Sr. They also produced some of the most enduring films of the silent era, including the Keystone Kops comedy franchise. Originally a distributor of films produced by NYMP, the Reliance Motion Picture Corp., Majestic Motion Picture Co., and The Keystone Film Co., by November 1916 the company's distribution was handled by Triangle Distributing Corporation.\n\nThough Ince had many credits as a director at Triangle, he only supervised the production of most pictures, working primarily as executive producer. One of his important pictures as a director was \"Civilization\" (1916), an epic plea for peace and American neutrality set in a mythical country and dedicated to the mothers of those who died in World War I. The film competed with Griffith's famous epic, \"Intolerance\" and beat it at the box office. \"Civilization\" was selected for preservation in the National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".\n\nInce added a few stages and an administration building to Triangle Studios before selling his shares to Griffith and Sennett in 1918. Three years later, the studios were acquired by Goldwyn Pictures, and in 1924 the facility became Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer studios. Such classics as Gone with the Wind, King Kong, and Citizen Kane were later filmed on that same lot.\n\nFor a while, Ince joined competitor Adolph Zukor to form Paramount-Artcraft Pictures (later Paramount Pictures). However, he yearned to go back to running his own studio. On July 19, 1918, following Samuel Goldwyn’s acquisition of the Triangle lot, he purchased a 14-acre (57,000 m2) property at 9336 West Washington Blvd. on an option basis from Culver along with a $132,000 loan. Thus was formed \"Thomas H. Ince Studios\", which operated from 1919 to 1924. Known later as the \"40 Acres,\" it was to be another Culver City historic landmark. \nWhen Ince conceived the idea of building his own studio, he was determined to have it different from the others. Among plans submitted to him by architects Meyer & Holler, was one that suggested the whole front administrative building made a replica of George Washington's home at Mount Vernon. The resulting administration building, known as \"The Mansion\", was the first building on the lot. \n\nIn back of the impressive office building were approximately 40 buildings, most of which were designed in the Colonial Revival style. A small group of bungalows, built for various movie stars and designed in styles popular in the 1920s and '30s, were constructed on the west side of the lot. By 1920, two glass stages, a hospital, fire department, reservoir/swimming pool, and the back lot were completed. That same year, President Woodrow Wilson took a tour of the studios as did the King and Queen of Belgium, along with their son, Prince Leopold, among much pomp and ceremony.\n\nInce had two or three companies working continuously on the lot at any given time. According to film historian Marc Wanamaker, Ince worked with a team of eight directors but \"he retained creative control of his films, developing the shooting scripts\" and personally assembling each of his films. By now, Ince had drifted away from westerns in favor of social dramas and he made a few significant films including \"Anna Christie\" (1923), based on the play by Eugene O'Neill, and \"Human Wreckage\" (1923), which was an early anti-drug film starring Dorothy Davenport (widow of addicted star Wallace Reid).\n\nAlthough Ince found distribution for his films through Paramount and MGM, he was no longer as powerful as he once had been and tried to regain his status in Hollywood. In 1919, with several other independent entrepreneurs (notably his old partner at Triangle, Mack Sennett, Marshall Neilan, Allan Dwan and Maurice Tourneur) he co-founded the independent releasing company, Associated Producers, Inc., to distribute their films. However, Associated Producers merged with First National in 1922.\n\nThough Ince still made some significant motion pictures, the studio system was starting to take over Hollywood. With little room for an independent producer and despite his attempts, Ince could not regain the powerful standing he once held in the industry. He and other independent producers tried to form the Cinematic Finance Corporation in 1921, which made loans to producers who already had been successful, but only accomplished its goal in a limited sense.\n\nIn 1925, a year after Ince’s death, the studio was sold (with Pathé America) to Ince's friend Cecil B. Demille. Besides DeMille, among those who had offices on the lot were producer Howard Hughes and Selznick International Pictures. About four years later, DeMille sold his interest to Pathé and the studio became known as the Pathé Culver City Studio. By 1928 after mergers, the studio became RKO/Pathé. By 1957, a number of other studios followed: Desilu Culver, Culver City Studios, Laird International Studios, etc.\n\nIn 1991, Sony Pictures Entertainment purchased the property as the home for its television endeavors, renaming it Culver Studios, and eventually selling it in 2004 to a group of investors. In his honor, the street intersecting the studios was renamed Ince Blvd. The studio is still home to Brooksfilms today.\n\nInce's untimely death at the age of 44 has been the subject of much speculation and scandal, with rumors of murder, mystery, and jealousy. The official cause of his death was heart failure, and while witnesses (including his widow Nell) corroborate that his medical condition brought about his death, rumors and sensationalism continued decades later, fueled with the 2001 release of the movie \"The Cat's Meow\".\n\nPrior to the fatal event, Ince and William Randolph Hearst had been negotiating a deal whereby Hearst would use Ince's studio for filming of Hearst's Cosmopolitan Productions. Hearst visited Ince at his home, his \"Dias Dorados\" estate at 1051 Benedict Canyon Drive, on Saturday November 15 and invited him for a weekend cruise on his yacht to honor Ince's birthday and to work out details of the Ince/Cosmopolitan deal. The next day, Ince boarded Hearst's lavish yacht, the \"Oneida\", and set sail from San Pedro, California heading for San Diego. Among Hearst's guests that weekend were his mistress, Marion Davies, silent film star Charlie Chaplin, author Elinor Glyn, film actresses Aileen Pringle, Jacqueline Logan, Seena Owen, Margaret Livingston, and Julanne Johnston; actor, choreographer and ballet dancer Theodore Kosloff, and Dr. Daniel Carson Goodman, Hearst's film production manager. Ince, the guest in honor of his 44th birthday, was late since he was finalizing the production deal with Hearst and the yacht left without him. \nAccording to Ince's widow Nell, Ince took a train to San Diego, where he joined the guests the next morning. At dinner that Sunday night, the group celebrated his birthday but later Ince suffered an acute bout of indigestion due to his consumption of salted almonds and champagne, both forbidden as he had peptic ulcers. Accompanied by Dr. Goodman, a licensed though non-practicing physician, Ince traveled by train to Del Mar, where he was taken to a hotel and given medical treatment by a second doctor and a nurse. Ince then summoned his wife and Dr. Ida Cowan Glasgow (Ince's personal physician) to Del Mar with Ince's eldest son William accompanying them. The group traveled by train to his Los Angeles home where Ince died. Nell said that Ince had been treated for chest pains caused by angina, but years later his son William became a physician and said that his father's illness resembled thrombosis.\n\nDr. Glasgow signed the death certificate citing heart failure as the cause of death. The front page of the Wednesday morning \"Los Angeles Times\" supposedly sensationalized the story: '\"Movie Producer Shot on Hearst Yacht!\", but the headlines vanished in the evening edition. On November 20, the \"Los Angeles Times\" published Ince's obituary citing heart disease as the cause of death along with his failing health from an automobile accident two years earlier. A month later, the \"New York Times\" reported that the San Diego District Attorney announced that Ince's death was caused by heart failure and no further investigation was necessary. Both Ince and his wife were practicing Theosophists who preferred cremation and had arranged for it long before Ince's death. While rumors prevailed that Ince's widow suddenly departed the country after her husband's death, she actually left for Europe about seven months later in July 1925.\n\nBut several conflicting stories circulated about the incident, often revolving around a claim that Hearst shot Ince in the head mistaking him for Chaplin. Chaplin's valet, Toraichi Kono, claimed to have seen Ince when he came ashore via stretcher in San Diego. Kono told his wife that Ince's head was \"bleeding from a bullet wound.\" The story quickly spread among Japanese domestic workers throughout Beverly Hills. But during Ince's funeral, the \"Los Angeles Times\" noted that his casket would remain open for one hour \"to afford friends and studio employees to pass for one last glimpse of the man they loved and respected\", with no witnesses ever mentioning a bullet wound.\n\nMovie columnist Louella Parsons' name also figured into the Ince scandal, with some speculating that she had been aboard the \"Oneida\" that fatal day. When the \"Oneida\" sailed, Parsons was a New York movie columnist for one of Hearst's papers. Supposedly, after the Ince affair, Hearst gave her a lifetime contract and expanded her syndication. However, other sources show that Parsons did not gain her position with Hearst as part of \"hush money\" but had been the motion picture editor of the Hearst-owned \"New York American\" in December 1923 and her contract was signed a year before Ince's death. Another story circulated that Hearst provided Nell Ince with a trust fund just before she left for Europe and that Hearst paid off Ince's mortgage on his Château Élysée apartment building in Hollywood. But Nell was left a very wealthy woman and the Château Élysée was an apartment she had already owned and had built on the grounds where the Ince home once stood.\n\nYears later, Hearst spoke to a journalist about the rumor that he had murdered Tom Ince. \"Not only am I innocent of this Ince murder\", he said. \"So is everybody else\". Nell Ince herself was increasingly frustrated over the Hearst rumors surrounding her husband's death and remarked: \"Do you think I would have done nothing if I even suspected that my husband had been victim of foul play on anyone's part?\"\n\nBut the myth of Ince's death overshadowed his reputation as a pioneering filmmaker and his role in the growth of the film industry. His studio was sold soon after he died. His final film, \"Enticement\", a romance set in the French Alps, was released posthumously in 1925.\n\n\"Murder at San Simeon\" (Scribner), a 1996 novel by Patricia Hearst (William Randolph's granddaughter) and Cordelia Frances Biddle, is a mystery based on the 1924 death of producer Thomas Ince aboard the yacht of William Randolph Hearst. This fictitious version presents Chaplin and Davies as lovers and Hearst as the jealous old man unwilling to share his mistress.\n\n\"RKO 281\" is a 1999 film about the making of \"Citizen Kane\". The movie includes a scene depicting screenwriter Herman Mankiewicz telling director Orson Welles his account of the incident.\n\n\"The Cat's Meow\", the 2001 film directed by Peter Bogdanovich, is another fictitious version of Ince's death. Bogdanovich claims that he heard the story from director Orson Welles, who said he heard it from screenwriter Charles Lederer (Marion Davies's nephew). In Bogdanovich's film, Ince is portrayed by Cary Elwes. The movie was adapted by Steven Peros from his own play, which premiered in Los Angeles in 1997.\n\nInce's star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame is located at 6727 Hollywood Blvd. in Los Angeles.\n\nA studio publication promoting \"Thomas H.

Cosmonaut Andriyan Nikolayev orbited the Earth 64 times over nearly four days in space, August 11–15, 1962, a feat which would not be matched by NASA until the Gemini program (1965–1966).\n\nVostok 3 and Vostok 4 were launched a day apart on trajectories that brought the spacecraft within approximately of one another. The cosmonauts aboard the two capsules also communicated with each other via radio, the first ship-to-ship communications in space. These missions marked the first time that more than one manned spacecraft was in orbit at the same time, giving Soviet mission controllers the opportunity to learn to manage this scenario.\n\n\nGherman Titov had suffered space sickness during his record-breaking one-day mission aboard Vostok 2. This condition was unknown at the time, leading Soviet scientists to devote efforts to study the effect of spaceflight on the human body.\n\nIn 1961, Soviet rocket engineer Sergei Korolev pushed for a three-day spaceflight as a follow-up to Vostok 2. Such a mission was opposed by the head of cosmonaut training Nikolai Kamanin and the cosmonauts themselves, who were concerned about unforeseen health effects that might result from extending space flights too quickly. Plans for a three-day mission only went forward when the approval of Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev was obtained; in the end, Vostok 3 would last nearly four days.\n\nOne objective of the missions of Vostok 3 and Vostok 4 was the study of how the reactions of Nikolayev and Pavel Popovich might differ during a series of tests under similar circumstances. The close orbits and near-rendezvous of the two spacecraft would keep the number of variables to a minimum, allowing the measurement of individual differences in adaptation to spaceflight. The Vostok spacecraft were upgraded to increase the volume of information collected about the flight conditions and the crew.\n\nTraining was expanded to condition cosmonauts against space sickness and select those candidate spacefarers deemed least susceptible. Informed by Titov's experience in Vostok 2, Nikolayev and Popovich thoroughly rehearsed their spacecraft maneuvers and other planned activities in a simulator.\n\nThe Vostok 3/4 flights were originally scheduled for November 1961, which would have had the propaganda value of the Soviet program having flown four men in space along with a dual mission in the same calendar year when the United States had yet to orbit a single man, but Korolev's plans were frustrated by the Zenit photo reconnaissance satellite program which needed to use the R-7 pads at Baikonur. He then suggested launching at the end of December or the start of January, but Chief of Cosmonaut Training Nikolai Kamanin and the State Planning Commission opposed launching in the wintertime due to harsh weather conditions and instead suggested waiting until March.\n\nThe first Zenit launch took place on 11 December, but the Blok E stage malfunctioned and the satellite was destroyed. Since this was the same model of booster used by the Vostok (8K72K), it was a concern for the program. While engineers attempted to resolve the problem, Vostok 3/4's mission was pushed back a month to April. However, further delays happened when the second Zenit satellite (Kosmos 4) experienced problems with its orientation system, necessitating another test and further delays.\n\nOn 1 June, an attempted launch of a Zenit photo reconnaissance satellite ended with the booster crashing near the pad. One of the strap-ons had also fallen back onto LC-1 and burned, resulting in extensive damage that took over a month to repair. By mid-July, the pad had been restored to use, but another delay occurred when the United States carried out a high-altitude nuclear test on 9 July known as Starfish Prime. The radiation from the test had unexpected consequences in that it released high levels of radiation into the upper atmosphere and space, knocking out several satellites and making any manned space launch unsafe for at least a month. By the second week of August, radiation levels had diminished enough that the Vostok 3/4 mission could go ahead.\n\nThe Zenit launch accident had occurred in a new, uprated version of the R-7 launch vehicle (the 8A92) while the Vostok used the older 8K72K booster, so it was not a direct concern for the program. However, just to be cautious, it was decided to fly an additional Zenit satellite to verify the reliability of the R-7. In addition, since the Zenit satellite was essentially a modified Vostok, the flight doubled as an engineering test of certain Vostok components. This was done successfully on July 28, after which preparations at LC-1 began for Vostok 3.\n\nVostok 3 lifted off from Gagarin's Start at Baikonur Cosmodrome at on August 11, 1962 at 08:24 UTC atop a Vostok 8K72K rocket. During his first day in orbit, Nikolayev unstrapped himself from his seat and became the first spacefarer to float freely in conditions of microgravity in space.\n\nNikolayev's orbital companion Popovich was launched the next day aboard Vostok 4. The former adjusted his spacecraft's orientation to watch the launch, but failed to see anything despite reporting considerable details on the ground as he had passed over Turkey. Data on the two spacecraft's orbital parameters that were released periodically by Soviet news agency TASS seemed to indicate a change in Vostok 3's orbital trajectory within ten hours of Vostok 4's launch, leading to speculation that the former spacecraft modified its orbit to bring it closer to that of the latter. The Vostok spacecraft is not believed to have had the ability to modify its orbit. Plans were for the spacecraft to approach to , but the closest distance achieved was . At the start of Vostok 3's thirty-third orbit, this distance had diverged to , and to at the start of the 64th.\n\nNikolayev and Popovich made contact with one another via shortwave radio soon after their spacecraft approached one another; they would maintain regular ship-to-ship communications over the course of their mission in addition to their contact with the ground. Nikolayev reported sighting the Vostok 4 capsule after it entered orbit near him.\n\nThe mission led Western observers to speculate that the Soviets must already have spacecraft capable of in-orbit maneuvering. Official press releases naturally made no mention that the Vostok spacecraft lacked this ability or that the two Vostoks were able to attain such close approach due to their extremely precise launches.\n\nBoth Nikolayev and Popovich spent time out of their seats each day, conducting a series of tests to determine their ability to maneuver and work in conditions of weightlessness. Each test was said to last \"about one hour.\" The physical and mental state of the cosmonauts were monitored: biometric sensors relayed the cosmonauts' vital statistics to the ground; the cosmonauts' behavior and coordination was observed via a cabin-mounted video camera; and the cosmonauts' ability to perform various operations in coordination with ground controllers was considered. The cosmonauts' speech was monitored both by controllers on the ground and one another. The results of the tests were deemed positive, evidence of the ability of humans to function and work over longer periods in microgravity. Nikolayev also spoke with Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev over the radio, but interference was so bad that he couldn't hear most of the conversation.\n\nAttention was paid to the cosmonauts' ability to sleep, and their vital signs were monitored during their sleep periods. Nikolayev reported that he slept well, but always woke after only six hours of his scheduled eight-hour sleep period, feeling \"refreshed\".\n\nNikolayev fired his retrorocket pack and returned to Earth on August 15, 1962, landing at 06:52 UTC at , near Karaganda. As with Titov on Vostok 2—but unlike Gagarin on Vostok 1—Nikolayev would admit to reporters that he ejected and parachuted to earth separately from his spacecraft.\n"}

Petrou's testimony reveals that the training methods themselves were brutal and often torturous and was viewed as a necessity to ensure the robotic and brutal obedience of the trainees.\n\nDuring the dramatic recreation of the training camps, the directors draw parallels to modern military recruit trainings and the methods used in the training of soldiers.\n\n\"The New York Times\" columnist Lawrence Van Gelder noted that while the film was technically flawed it was at the same time \"memorable and unnerving\" in its depiction of both the victims of the torture as well as the ordeals of the torturers themselves, and claimed \"it is impossible to regard its torturers or its victims without realizing that the view may be a view into a mirror.\"\n\n"}
