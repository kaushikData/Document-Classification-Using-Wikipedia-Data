{"id": "2671", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2671", "title": "Abbahu", "text": "Abbahu\n\nAbbahu () was a Jewish Talmudist, known as an \"amora\", who lived in the Land of Israel, of the 3rd amoraic generation (about 279-320), sometimes cited as R. Abbahu of Caesarea (Ḳisrin). His rabbinic education was acquired mainly at Tiberias, in the academy presided over by R. Johanan, with whom his relations were almost those of a son. He frequently made pilgrimages to Tiberias, even after he had become well known as rector of the Caesarean Academy.\n\nAbbahu was an authority on weights and measures. He encouraged the study of Greek by Jews. He learned Greek himself in order to become useful to his people, then under the Roman \"proconsuls\", that language having become, to a considerable extent, the rival of the Hebrew even in prayer (\"Yer. Sotah\" chapter VII, 21b). In spite of the bitter protest of Simon b. Abba, he also taught his daughters Greek. Indeed, it was said of Abbahu that he was a living illustration of the maxim (Ecc.; compare Targum), \"It is good that thou shouldest take hold of this [the study of the Law]; yea, also from that [other branches of knowledge] withdraw not thine hand: for he that feareth God shall come forth of them all\" (\"Ecc. R.\" to 7:18).\n\nBeing wise, handsome, and wealthy, Abbahu became not only popular with his coreligionists, but also influential with the proconsular government. On one occasion, when his senior colleagues, Ḥiyya b. Abba, Rabbi Ammi, and Rabbi Assi, had punished a certain woman, and feared the wrath of the proconsul, Abbahu was deputed to intercede for them. He had, however, anticipated the rabbis' request, and wrote them that he had appeased the informers but not the accuser. The witty enigmatic letter describing this incident, preserved in the Talmud, is in the main pure Hebrew, and even includes Hebrew translations of Greek proper names, to avoid the danger of possible exposure should the letter have fallen into the hands of enemies and informers (compare \"Eruvin\" 53b).\n\nAfter his ordination he declined a teacher's position, recommending in his stead a more needy friend, R. Abba of Acre (Acco), as worthier than himself. He thereby illustrated his own doctrine that it is a divine virtue to sympathize with a friend in his troubles as well as to partake of his joys. Later he assumed the office of rector in Caesarea, the former seat of Hoshaiah Rabbah, and established himself at the so-called Kenishta Maradta (Insurrectionary Synagogue); from which some of the most prominent teachers of the next generation issued. He did not, however, confine his activity to Caesarea, where he originated several ritualistic rules, one of which—that regulating the sounding of the shofar—has since been universally adopted, and is referred to by medieval Jewish casuists as \"\"Takkanat R. Abbahu\" (the Enactment of R. Abbahu). He also visited and taught in many other Jewish towns.\n\nWhile on these journeys, Abbahu gathered so many \"Halakot\" that scholars turned to him for information on mooted questions. In the course of these travels he made a point of complying with all local enactments, even where such compliance laid him open to the charge of inconsistency. On the other hand, where circumstances required it, he did not spare even the princes of his people. Where, however, the rigorous exposition of laws worked hardship on the masses, he did not scruple to modify the decisions of his colleagues for the benefit of the community. As for himself, he was very strict in the observance of the laws. On one occasion he ordered some Samaritan wine, but subsequently learning that there were no longer any strict observers of the dietary laws among the Samaritans, with the assistance of his colleagues, Ḥiyya b. Abba, Rabbi Ammi, and Rabbi Assi, he investigated the report, and, ascertaining it to be well founded, did not hesitate to declare the Samaritans, for all ritualistic purposes, Gentiles.\n\nR. Abbahu's chief characteristic seems to have been modesty. While lecturing in different towns, he met R. Ḥiyya b. Abba, who was lecturing on intricate \"halakic\" themes. As Abbahu delivered popular sermons, the masses naturally crowded to hear him, and deserted the halakist. At this apparent slight, R. Ḥiyya manifested chagrin, and R. Abbahu hastened to comfort him by comparing himself to the pedler of glittering fineries that always attracted the eyes of the masses, while his rival was a trader in precious stones, the virtues and values of which were appreciated only by the connoisseur. This speech not having the desired effect, R. Abbahu showed special respect for his slighted colleague by following him for the remainder of that day. \"What,\" said Abbahu, \"is my modesty as compared with that of R. Abba of Acre (Acco), who does not even remonstrate with his interpreter for interpolating his own comments in the lecturer's expositions.\" When his wife reported to him that his interpreter's wife had boasted of her own husband's greatness, R. Abbahu simply said, \"What difference does it make which of us is really the greater, so long as through both of us heaven is glorified?\" (\"Sotah\" 40a). His principle of life he expressed in the maxim,\n\nR. Abbahu, though eminent as a halakist, was more distinguished as a haggadist and controversialist. He had many interesting disputes with the Christians of his day (\"Shab.\" 152b; \"San.\" 39a; \"Av. Zarah\" 4a). Sometimes these disputes were of a jocular nature. Thus, a heretic bearing the name of Sason (=Joy) once remarked to him, \"In the next world your people will have to draw water for me; for thus it is written in the Bible (Isaiah 12:3), 'With joy shall ye draw water.'\" To this R. Abbahu replied, \"Had the Bible said 'for joy' [\"le-sason\"], it would mean as thou sayest, but since it says 'with joy' [\"be-sason\"], it means that we shall make bottles of thy hide and fill them with water\" (\"Suk.\" 48b). These controversies, though forced on him, provoked resentment, and it is even related that his physician, Jacob the Schismatic (\"Minaah\"), was slowly poisoning him, but R. Ammi and R. Assi discovered the crime in time (\"Av. Zarah\" 28a).\n\nAbbahu had two sons, Zeira and Ḥanina. Some writers ascribe to him a third son, Abimi (Bacher, \"Agada der Babylonischen Amoräer\"). Abbahu sent Ḥanina to the academy at Tiberias, where he himself had studied, but the lad occupied himself with the burial of the dead, and on hearing of this, the father sent him a reproachful message in this laconic style: \"Is it because there are no graves in Cæsarea (compare Exodus 14:11) that I have sent thee off to Tiberias? Study must precede practice\" (\"Yer. Pesahim\" chapter III, 30b). Abbahu left behind him a number of disciples, the most prominent among whom were the leaders of the 4th amoraic generation, R. Jonah and R. Jose. At Abbahu's death the mourning was so great that it was said, \"Even the statues of Cæsarea shed tears\" (\"Mo'ed Katan\" 25b; \"Yer. Av. Zarah\" chapter III, 42c).\n\nThere are several other Abbahus mentioned in the Talmudim and Midrashim, prominent among whom is Abbahu (Abuha, Aibut) b. Ihi (Ittai), a Babylonian halakist, contemporary of Samuel and Anan (\"Eruvin\" 74a), and brother of Minyamin (Benjamin) b. Ihi. While this Abbahu repeatedly applied to Samuel for information, Samuel in return learned many Halakot from him (\"Naz.\" 24b; \"Bava Metzia\" 14a; 75a).\n\n\"When does your Messiah come?\" a Christian (\"Minaah\") once asked Abbahu in a tone of mockery, whereupon he replied: \"When you will be wrapped in darkness, for it says, 'Behold, darkness shall cover the earth, and gross darkness the nations; then shall the Lord rise upon thee and His glory shall be seen on thee' <nowiki>[</nowiki>Isaiah 60:2],\" (\"Sanhedrin\" 99a). A Christian came to Abbahu with the quibbling question: \"How could your God in His priestly holiness bury Moses without providing for purificatory rites, yet oceans are declared insufficient?\" (Isaiah 40:12). \"Why,\" said Abbahu, \"does it not say, 'The Lord cometh with fire'?\" (Isaiah 64:15). \"Fire is the true element of purification, according to Numbers 31:23,\" was his answer (\"Sanhedrin\" 39a). Another question of the same character: \"Why the boastful claim: 'What nation on earth is like Thy people Israel' (II Sam. 7:23), since we read, 'All the nations are as nothing before Him'?\" (Isaiah 40:17), to which Abbahu replied: \"Do we not read of Israel, he 'shall not be reckoned among the nations'?\", \"Sanhedrin\" as above).\n\nAbbahu made a notable exception with reference to the Tosefta's statement that the \"Gilionim\" (Evangels) and other books of the Mineans (\"Minnin\") are not to be saved from a conflagration on Sabbath: \"the books of those [written by \"Minnin\" for the purpose of debating with Jews] at Abidan may or may not be saved\" (\"Shab.\" 116a). In regard to the benediction \"\"Baruk Shem Kebod Malkuto\" (Blessed be the Name of His glorious Kingdom) after the \"Shema' Yisrael\",\" Abbahu says that in Palestine, where the Christians look for points of controversy, the words should be recited aloud (lest the Jews be accused of silently tampering with the unity of God proclaimed in the \"Shema\"), whereas in the Babylonian city of Nehardea, where there are no Christians, the words are recited with a low voice (\"Pesahim\" 56a). Preaching directly against the Christian dogma, Abbahu says: \"A king of flesh and blood may have a father, a brother, or a son to share in or dispute his sovereignty, but the Lord saith, 'I am the Lord thy God! I am the first; that is, I have no father, and I am the last; that is, I have no brother, and besides me there is no God; that is, I have no son'\" (Isaiah 44:6; \"Ex. R.\" 29). His comment on Numbers 23:19 has a still more polemical tone: \"God is not a man that he should lie; neither the son of man, that he should repent; if a man says: 'I am God,' he is a liar; if he says: 'I am a son of man,' he will have cause to regret it; and if he says, 'I will go up to heaven,' he has said [\"something\"] but will not keep his word\" (\"Yer. Ta'anit\" chapter II \"halachah\" 1, end, page 65b in Bomberg's Venice edition; 9a in current editions).\n\nSome of his controversies on Christian theological subjects, as on Adam (\"Yalḳ.\", Gen. 47), on Enoch (\"Gen. R.\" 25), and on the resurrection (\"Shab.\" 152b), are less clear and direct (see Bacher, \"Agada der Pal. Amor.\" ii. 97, 115-118).\n"}

{"id": "21771273", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21771273", "title": "Alvin Plantinga's free will defense", "text": "Alvin Plantinga's free will defense\n\nAlvin Plantinga's free will defense is a logical argument developed by American analytic philosopher Alvin Plantinga, the John A. O'Brien Professor of Philosophy Emeritus at the University of Notre Dame, and published in its final version in his 1977 book \"God, Freedom, and Evil\". Plantinga's argument is a defense against the logical problem of evil as formulated by philosopher J. L. Mackie beginning in 1955. Mackie's formulation of the logical problem of evil argued that three attributes of God, omniscience, omnipotence, and omnibenevolence, in orthodox Christian theism are logically incompatible with the existence of evil. In 1982, Mackie conceded that Plantinga's defense successfully refuted his argument in \"The Miracle of Theism,\" though he did not claim that the problem of evil had been put to rest.\n\nThe logical argument from evil argued by J. L. Mackie, and to which the free will defense responds, is an argument against the existence of the Christian God based on the idea that a logical contradiction exists between four theological tenets in orthodox Christian theology. Specifically, the argument from evil asserts that the following set of propositions are, by themselves, logically inconsistent or contradictory:\nMost orthodox Christian theologians agree with the first three propositions describing God as all-knowing (1), all-powerful (2), and morally perfect (3), and agree with the proposition that there is evil in the world, as described in proposition (4). The logical argument from evil asserts that a God with the attributes (1-3), must know about all evil, would be capable of preventing it, and as morally perfect would be motivated to do so. The argument from evil concludes that the existence of the orthodox Christian God is, therefore, incompatible with the existence of evil and can be logically ruled out.\n\nPlantinga's free will defense begins by asserting that Mackie's argument failed to establish an \"explicit\" logical contradiction between God and the existence of evil. In other words Plantinga shows that (1-4) are not on their own contradictory, and that any contradiction must originate from an atheologian's \"implicit\" unstated assumptions, assumptions representing premises not stated in the argument itself. With an \"explicit\" contradiction ruled out, an atheologian must add premises to the argument for it to succeed. Nonetheless, if Plantinga had offered no further argument then an atheologian's intuitive impressions that a contradiction must exist would have remained unanswered. Plantinga sought to resolve this by offering two further points.\n\nFirst, Plantinga pointed out that God, though omnipotent, could not be expected to do literally anything. God could not, for example, create square circles, act contrary to his nature, or, more relevantly, create beings with free will that would never choose evil. Taking this latter point further, Plantinga argued that the moral value of human free will is a credible offsetting justification that God could have as a morally justified reason for permitting the existence of evil. Plantinga did not claim to have shown that the conclusion of the logical problem is wrong, nor did he assert that God's reason for allowing evil is, in fact, to preserve free will. Instead, his argument sought only to show that the logical problem of evil was unsound.\n\nPlantinga's defense has received strong support among Christian academic philosophers and theologians. Contemporary atheologians have presented arguments claiming to have found the additional premises needed to create an explicitly contradictory theistic set by adding to the propositions 1-4. These arguments have not yet gained wider academic philosophical support.\n\nIn addition to Plantinga's free will defense, there are other arguments purporting to undermine or disprove the logical argument from evil. Plantinga's free will defense is the best known of these responses at least in part because of his thoroughness in describing and addressing the relevant questions and issues in \"God, Freedom, and Evil.\"\n\nAs opposed to a theodicy (a \"justification\" for God's actions), Plantinga puts forth a \"defense\", offering a new proposition that is intended to demonstrate that it is logically possible for an omnibenevolent, omnipotent and omniscient God to create a world that contains moral evil. Significantly, Plantinga does not need to assert that his new proposition is true, merely that it is logically valid. In this way Plantinga's approach differs from that of a traditional theodicy, which would strive to show not just that the new propositions are valid, but that the argument is sound, prima facie plausible, or that there are good grounds for making it. Thus the burden of proof on Plantinga is lessened, and yet his approach may still serve as a defense against the claim by Mackie that the simultaneous existence of evil and an omnipotent and omnibenevolent God is \"positively irrational\".\n\nAs Plantinga summarised his defense:\n\nA world containing creatures who are significantly free (and freely perform more good than evil actions) is more valuable, all else being equal, than a world containing no free creatures at all. Now God can create free creatures, but He can't \"cause\" or \"determine\" them to do only what is right. For if He does so, then they aren't significantly free after all; they do not do what is right \"freely\". To create creatures capable of \"moral good\", therefore, He must create creatures capable of moral evil; and He can't give these creatures the freedom to perform evil and at the same time prevent them from doing so. As it turned out, sadly enough, some of the free creatures God created went wrong in the exercise of their freedom; this is the source of moral evil. The fact that free creatures sometimes go wrong, however, counts neither against God's omnipotence nor against His goodness; for He could have forestalled the occurrence of moral evil only by removing the possibility of moral good.\n\nPlantinga's argument is that even though God is omnipotent, it is \"possible\" that it was not in his power to create a world containing moral good but no moral evil; therefore, there is no logical inconsistency involved when God, although wholly good, creates a world of free creatures who choose to do evil. The argument relies on the following propositions:\nPlantinga refers to the first statement as \"Leibniz's lapse\" as the opposite was assumed by Leibniz. The second proposition is more contentious. Plantinga rejects the compatibilist notion of freedom whereby God could directly cause agents to only do good without sacrificing their freedom. Although it would contradict a creature's freedom if God were to cause, or in Plantinga's terms \"strongly actualize\", a world where creatures only do good, an omniscient God would still know the circumstances under which creatures would go wrong. Thus, God could avoid creating such circumstances, thereby \"weakly actualizing\" a world with only moral good. Plantinga's crucial argument is that this possibility may not be available to God because all possible morally free creatures suffer from \"transworld depravity\".\n\nAccording to Chad Meister, professor of philosophy at Bethel College, most philosophers accept Plantinga's free will defense and thus see the logical problem of evil as having been sufficiently rebutted. Robert Adams says that \"it is fair to say that Plantinga has solved this problem. That is, he has argued convincingly for the consistency of God and evil.\" William Alston has said that \"Plantinga [...] has established the possibility that God could not actualize a world containing free creatures that always do the right thing.\" William L. Rowe has written \"granted incompatibilism, there is a fairly compelling argument for the view that the existence of evil is logically consistent with the existence of the theistic God\", referring to Plantinga's argument.\n\nIn \"Arguing about Gods\", Graham Oppy offers a dissent, acknowledging that \"[m]any philosophers seem to suppose that [Plantinga's free will defense] utterly demolishes the kinds of 'logical' arguments from evil developed by Mackie\" but continuing \"I am not sure this is a correct assessment of the current state of play\". Concurring with Oppy, A.M. Weisberger writes “contrary to popular theistic opinion, the logical form of the argument is still alive and beating.” Among contemporary philosophers, most discussion on the problem of evil presently revolves around the \"evidential\" problem of evil, namely that the existence of God is unlikely, rather than illogical.\n\nCritics of Plantinga's argument, such as philosopher Antony Flew, have responded that it presupposes a libertarian, incompatibilist view of free will (free will and determinism are metaphysically incompatible), while their view is a compatibilist view of free will (free will and determinism, whether physical or divine, are metaphysically compatible). The view of compatibilists is that God could have created a world containing moral good but no moral evil. In such a world people could have chosen to only perform good deeds, even though all their choices were predestined.\n\nPlantinga dismisses compatibilism, stating \"this objection... seems utterly implausible. One might as well claim that being in jail doesn't really limit one's freedom on the grounds that if one were not in jail, he'd be free to come and go as he pleased\".\n\nPlantinga's idea of weakly actualizing a world can be viewed as having God actualizing a subset of the world, letting the free choices of creatures complete the world. Therefore, it is certainly possible that a person completes the world by only making morally good choices; that is, there exist possible worlds where a person freely chooses to do no moral evil. However, it may be the case that for each such world, there is some morally significant choice that this person would do differently if these circumstances were to occur in the actual world. In other words, each such possible world contains a \"world segment\", meaning everything about that world up to the point where the person must make that critical choice, such that if that segment was part of the actual world, the person would instead go wrong in completing that world. Formally, \"transworld depravity\" is defined as follows:\n\nLess formally: Consider all possible (not actual) worlds in which someone always chooses the right. In all those, there will be a subpart of the world that says that person was free to choose a certain right or wrong action, but does not say whether they chose it. If that subpart were actual (in the real world), then they would choose the wrong.\n\nPlantinga responds that \"What is important about the idea of transworld depravity is that if a person suffers from it, then it wasn't within God's power to actualize any world in which that person is significantly free but does no wrong—that is, a world in which he produces moral good but no moral evil\" and that it is logically \"possible\" that every person suffers from transworld depravity.\n\n\n"}

He studied literature, philosophy, and jurisprudence, but at the age of eighteen he gave up his legal studies, went to Rome and for the remainder of his lifetime was devoted to archaeological work in the Roman catacombs. He died in Rome in 1629.\n\nThe accidental discovery in 1578 of an ancient subterranean cemetery on the Via Salaria had attracted general attention in Rome. Few, however, realized the importance of the discovery, and with the exception of three foreign scholars, Alfonso Chacon, the antiquarian Philips van Winghe (1560–1592) from Leuven and Jean L'Heureux (alias Macarius), no one seriously thought of pursuing further investigations. Bosio began the systematic exploration of subterranean Rome and thus became a precursor of the science of Christian archaeology, an inspiration to Giovanni Battista de Rossi. The young explorer realized that early Christian literature such as \"acta\" of the martyrs and accounts of the councils would offer clues to the locations of the catacombs; an idea of the vast scope of his reading is in two great folio volumes of his manuscript notes in the Vallicelliana library at Rome, each of which contains about a thousand pages.\n\nThe scholarly labors of Bosio accounted for only half of his time; after he had collected all the data possible relative to the location of a catacomb on one of the great Roman roads leading from Rome, Bosio would set out for the places indicated, and cover the ground carefully in the hope of discovering a forgotten stairway offering access, or a \"luminarium\" lighting the underground galleries of a cemetery. He had the sense to question the local peasants. He would then descend to the subterranean galleries and commence his explorations. Narrow passages led from one series of galleries to another. Years could pass without any new entrances being discovered.\n\nThis life work of Bosio was all but unknown until the publication three years after his death of his \"Roma Sotterranea, opera postuma di Antonio Bosio Romano, antiquario ecclesiastico singolare de' suoi tempi. Compita, disposta, et accresciuta dal M. R. P. Giovanni Severani da S. Severino\" (Rome, 1632), usually referred to as \"Roma Sotterranea\". The folio volume was brought out under the patronage of the Knights of Malta, edited by the Oratorian Severano, under the patronage of Cardinal Francesco Barberini. A Latin translation that appeared in 1651 took liberties with the text. Bosio's \"Roma Sotterranea\" is entirely devoted to a description of the cemeteries with the end of ascertaining all that was possible regarding the history of each cemetery, by what name it was known in antiquity, who its founders were, and what martyrs and illustrious Christians were interred there. Many of his conclusions have in modern times been found to be erroneous, but Bosio's method is acknowledged to have been scientific within the shortcomings of the infant science of archaeology. The engravings that accompanied the volume are of little use to the modern archaeologist.\n\nAn unfortunate result of the publication was that with the locations known, the catacombs were scoured for anything that might prove of value on the market; though much information on the condition of the catacombs and their inscriptions and frescoes in the early 17th century was preserved in Bosio's volume, much also was lost. Some of the catacombs Bosio described have since been destroyed by subsequent construction.\n\nThis book must have been rated highly by the English physician and philosopher Sir Thomas Browne, for copies in both Italian and Latin can be found in his library.\n\n\n"}

Maynard graduated from the University of California, Berkeley with a bachelor's degree in psychology in 2006 from the College of Letters and Science and the University of California, Irvine School of Education in 2010 with a master's degree in education. Interested in international travel since high school, Maynard taught at orphanages in Kathmandu, Nepal and traveled also to Vietnam, Cambodia, and other Southeast Asian countries.\n\nOn January 1, 2014, she was diagnosed with grade 2 astrocytoma, a form of brain cancer, and had a partial craniotomy and a partial resection of her temporal lobe. The cancer returned in April 2014, and her diagnosis was then elevated to grade 4 astrocytoma, also known as glioblastoma, with a prognosis of six months to live.\n\nShe moved from California to Oregon to take advantage of Oregon's Death with Dignity Law, saying she had decided that \"death with dignity was the best option for me and my family.\" She partnered with Compassion & Choices to create the Brittany Maynard Fund, which seeks to legalize assisted death in states where it is now illegal. She also wrote an opinion piece for CNN titled \"My Right to Death with Dignity at 29\".\n\nOn October 29, 2014, she stated that \"it doesn't seem like the right time right now\" but that she would still end her own life at some future point. Maynard planned to end her life on November 1, 2014, with drugs prescribed by her doctor.\n\nMaynard married Daniel Esteban \"Dan\" Diaz in September 2012, and before she received her diagnosis, they had hoped to have a family. In October 2014 she stated that she had checked off the last item on her bucket list by visiting the Grand Canyon. Aside from her husband, she was survived by her mother, Deborah Ziegler, and her stepfather, Gary Holmes.\n\nIt was reported on November 2, 2014, by \"People\" and various other media sources that Maynard had ended her life on November 1 surrounded by her loved ones. In accordance with Oregon state law regarding death with dignity, a brain tumor is the official cause of death on her death certificate.\n\nMaynard wrote in her final Facebook post: \"Goodbye to all my dear friends and family that I love. Today is the day I have chosen to pass away with dignity in the face of my terminal illness, this terrible brain cancer that has taken so much from me ... but would have taken so much more.\"\n\nIn the weeks leading up to her death, Maynard was said to have become the face of the United States right-to-die debate, commanding public attention, with over 16 million unique visitors reading her story on People.com. Arthur Caplan, of New York University's Division of Medical ethics, wrote that because Maynard was \"young, vivacious, attractive … and a very different kind of person\" from the average patient seeking physician-assisted dying—then averaging age 71 in Oregon—she \"changed the optics of the debate\" and got people in her generation interested in the issue. Marcia Angell, the former editor-in-chief of the \"New England Journal of Medicine\", wrote that Maynard was a \"new face\" of the assisted dying movement who had \"greatly helped future patients who want the same choice.\" However, several terminally ill individuals publicly criticized Maynard's promotion of assisted suicide. Terminal cancer patients Kara Tippetts and Maggie Karner both sent letters to Maynard asking her to reconsider.\n\nThree days after Maynard's death, a top Vatican official mentioned her decision to die in the context of reiterating the Catholic Church's position on the right-to-die debate, noting that, \"Suicide is not a good thing. It is a bad thing because it is saying no to life and to everything it means with respect to our mission in the world and toward those around us.\" The National Right to Life Committee (NRLC) asserted that from its perspective, Maynard's chosen non-profit, Compassion & Choices had \"exploited the illness of Brittany Maynard to promote legalization of doctor prescribed suicide in the states.\" Brittany's mother defended her daughter's decision via a letter released by Compassion & Choices, stating \"My twenty-nine-year-old daughter's choice to die gently rather than suffer physical and mental degradation and intense pain does not deserve to be labelled as reprehensible by strangers a continent away who do not know her or the particulars of her situation.\"\n\nAt the time of Maynard's death, only three states had death-with-dignity laws, with two others having court rulings protecting physicians who help patients die, and bills having been introduced in seven other states. Polls have found the American public divided on the introduction of such laws. Maynard's activism has been a strong focus of Connecticut's proposed assisted death legislation.\n\nMaynard's family have played video testimony that she recorded for proposed legislative change in her home state of California. On September 11, 2015, California lawmakers gave final approval to Senate Bill (SB 128) End of Life Option Act. A modified version of the bill, ABx2 15, was signed into law by Governor Jerry Brown on October 5, 2015. It went into effect on June 9, 2016. On May 15, 2018, a state judge struck down this law on the grounds that it was improper to consider a right-to-die bill during a special session of the state legislature that was supposed to be focused on health care spending and access issues. The law was reinstated by a state appeals court the following month.\n\nHawaii has become the seventh state to legalize medically assisted suicide. Hawaii Governor David Ige signed the bill into law in Honolulu on Thursday, April 5, 2018. The law will take effect on January 1, 2019.\n\n\n"}

He had long-term collaborations with film directors Michael Winner and J. Lee Thompson, and appeared in fifteen films alongside his second wife, Jill Ireland.\n\nBronson was born Charles Dennis Buchinsky, the 11th of 15 children, in a Roman Catholic family of Lithuanian descent in Ehrenfeld, Pennsylvania, in the coal region of the Allegheny Mountains north of Johnstown, Pennsylvania.\n\nHis father, Valteris P. Bučinskis, who later adjusted his name to Walter Buchinsky to sound more \"American\", was from Druskininkai in southern Lithuania. Bronson's mother, Mary (née Valinsky), whose parents were from Lithuania, was born in the coal mining town of Tamaqua, Pennsylvania. The family had Lipka Tatar roots.\n\nBronson learned to speak English when he was a teenager; before that, he spoke Lithuanian and Russian.\n\nBronson was the first member of his family to graduate from high school. When Bronson was 10 years old, his father died and he went to work in the coal mines, first in the mining office and then in the mine. He later said he earned one dollar for each ton of coal that he mined. He worked in the mine until he entered military service during World War II. His family was so poor that, at one time, he had to wear his sister's dress to school for lack of clothing.\n\nIn 1943, Bronson enlisted in the United States Army Air Forces and served in the 760th Flexible Gunnery Training Squadron, and in 1945 as a Boeing B-29 Superfortress aerial gunner with the Guam-based 61st Bombardment Squadron within the 39th Bombardment Group, which conducted combat missions against the Japanese home islands. He flew 25 missions and received a Purple Heart for wounds received in battle.\n\nAfter the end of World War II, Bronson worked at many odd jobs until joining a theatrical group in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. He later shared an apartment in New York City with Jack Klugman while both were aspiring to play on the stage. In 1950, he married and moved to Hollywood, where he enrolled in acting classes and began to find small roles.\n\nBronson's first film role — an uncredited one — was as a sailor in \"You're in the Navy Now\" in 1951, directed by Henry Hathaway. Other early screen appearances were in \"The Mob\" (1951); \"The People Against O'Hara\" (1951), directed by John Sturges; \"Bloodhounds of Broadway\" (1952); \"Battle Zone\" (1952); \"Pat and Mike\" (1952), as a boxer and mob enforcer; \"Diplomatic Courier\" (1952), another for Hathaway; \"My Six Convicts\" (1952); \"The Marrying Kind\" (1952); and \"Red Skies of Montana\" (1952).\n\nIn 1952, Bronson boxed in a ring with Roy Rogers in Rogers' show \"Knockout\". He appeared on an episode of \"The Red Skelton Show\" as a boxer in a skit with Skelton playing \"Cauliflower McPugg\". He appeared with fellow guest star Lee Marvin in an episode of \"Biff Baker, U.S.A.\", an espionage series on CBS starring Alan Hale, Jr.\n\nHe had small roles in \"Miss Sadie Thompson\" (1953); \"House of Wax\" (1953), directed by Andre DeToth; \"The Clown\" (1953); \"Torpedo Alley\" (1953); and \"Riding Shotgun\", starring Randolph Scott, directed by DeToth again.\n\nBronson had a notable support part as an Indian in \"Apache\" (1954) for director Robert Aldrich who then used him again in \"Vera Cruz\" (1954). Bronson then made a strong impact as the main villain in the Alan Ladd western \"Drum Beat\" as a murderous Modoc warrior, Captain Jack (based on a real person), who relishes wearing the tunics of soldiers he has killed.\n\nHe had roles in \"Tennessee Champ\" (1954) for MGM, and \"Crime Wave\" (1954) directed by de Toth.\n\nIn 1954, during the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) proceedings, he changed his surname from Buchinsky to Bronson at the suggestion of his agent, who feared that an Eastern European surname might damage his career.\n\nAs \"Charles Bronson\", he could be seen in \"Target Zero\" (1955), \"Big House, U.S.A.\" (1955), and \"Jubal\" (1956).\n\nBronson had the lead role of the episode \"The Apache Kid\" of the syndicated crime drama \"Sheriff of Cochise\", starring John Bromfield; Bronson was subsequently cast twice in 1959 after the series was renamed \"U.S. Marshal\".\n\nHe guest-starred in the short-lived CBS situation comedy, \"Hey, Jeannie!\" and in three episodes of \"Alfred Hitchcock Presents\": \"And So Died Riabouchinska\" (1956), \"There Was an Old Woman\" (1956), and \"The Woman Who Wanted to Live\" (1962).\n\nIn 1957, Bronson was cast in the Western series \"Colt .45\" as an outlaw named Danny Arnold in the episode \"Young Gun\". He had a support role in Sam Fuller's \"Run of the Arrow\" (1957).\n\nBronson scored the lead in his own ABC's detective series \"Man with a Camera\" (1958–1960), in which he portrayed Mike Kovac, a former combat photographer freelancing in New York City.\n\nHe was cast in leading man roles in some low budget films, notably, \"Machine-Gun Kelly\" (1958), a biopic of a real life gangster directed by Roger Corman. He also starred in \"Gang War\" (1958), \"When Hell Broke Loose\" (1958), and \"Showdown at Boot Hill\" (1959).\n\nOn television, he played Steve Ogrodowski, a naval intelligence officer, in two episodes of the CBS military sitcom/drama, \"Hennesey\", starring Jackie Cooper, and he played Rogue Donovan, an escaped murderer in \"Yancy Derringer\" (episode: \"Hell and High Water\"). Bronson starred alongside Elizabeth Montgomery in a \"Twilight Zone\" episode (\"Two\"; 1961). He appeared in five episodes of Richard Boone's \"Have Gun – Will Travel\" (1957–63).\n\nBronson had a support role in an expensive war film, \"Never So Few\" (1959), directed by John Sturges. Bronson was cast in the 1960 episode \"Zigzag\" of \"Riverboat\", starring Darren McGavin. That same year, he was cast as \"Dutch Malkin\" in the 1960 episode \"The Generous Politician\" of \"The Islanders\".\n\nIn 1960, he garnered attention in John Sturges' \"The Magnificent Seven\", in which he was cast as one of seven gunfighters taking up the cause of the defenseless. During filming, Bronson was a loner who kept to himself, according to Eli Wallach. He received $50,000 for this role. This role made him a favorite actor of many in the since disbanded Soviet Union, such as Vladimir Vysotsky.\n\nAIP put Bronson in the romantic lead of \"Master of the World\" (1961), supporting Vincent Price. He had a support role in MGM's \"A Thunder of Drums\" (1961) but a bigger part in \"X-15\" (1961).\n\nIn 1961, Bronson was nominated for an Emmy Award for his supporting role in an episode entitled \"Memory in White\" of CBS's \"General Electric Theater\", hosted by Ronald Reagan. In 1962, he appeared alongside Elvis Presley in \"Kid Galahad\". In 1963, he co-starred in the series \"Empire\".\n\nSturges cast Bronson for another Hollywood production, \"The Great Escape\" (1963), as claustrophobic Polish prisoner of war Flight Lieutenant Danny Velinski, nicknamed \"The Tunnel King\" (coincidentally, Bronson was really claustrophobic because of his childhood work in a mine). The film was a huge hit and Bronson had one of the leads, but he still found himself playing a villain in \"4 for Texas\" (1963) for Robert Aldrich.\n\nDuring the 1963–64 television season Bronson portrayed Linc, the stubborn wagonmaster in the ABC western series, \"The Travels of Jaimie McPheeters\".\n\nBronson had the lead in \"Guns of Diablo\" (1965), a Western. In the 1965–1966 season, he guest-starred in an episode of \"The Legend of Jesse James\". In 1965, Bronson was cast as a demolitions expert in an episode of ABC's \"Combat!\"\n\nHe had a relatively minor role in \"Battle of the Bulge\" (1965) and was billed fourth in MGM's \"The Sandpiper\" (1966), which the popularity of stars Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor propelled to a big success. He was billed third in \"This Property Is Condemned\" (1966).\n\nIn 1967, he guest-starred as Ralph Schuyler, an undercover government agent in the episode \"The One That Got Away\" on ABC's \"The Fugitive\".\n\nThat year Aldrich gave Bronson an excellent role in \"The Dirty Dozen\" (1967), where he played an Army death row convict conscripted into a suicide mission. It was a massive box office success but Bronson was only the third lead. He seemed unable to make the transition to star of major studio films in Hollywood. In \"Villa Rides\" (1968) he supported Robert Mitchum and Yul Brynner, playing the real-life Rodolfo Fierro.\n\nBronson made a serious name for himself in European films. He was making \"Villa Rides\" when approached by the producers of a French film \"Adieu l'ami\" looking for an American co-star for Alain Delon. Bronson's agent Paul Kohner later recalled the producer pitched the actor \"on the fact that in the American film industry all the money, all the publicity, goes to the pretty boy hero types. In Europe... the public is attracted by character, not face.\"\n\nThe film was a big success in Europe. Even more popular was \"Once Upon a Time in the West\" (1968) where Bronson played Harmonica. The director, Sergio Leone, once called him \"the greatest actor I ever worked with\", and had wanted to cast Bronson for the lead in 1964's \"A Fistful of Dollars\". Bronson turned him down and the role launched Clint Eastwood to film stardom. The film was the biggest hit of 1969 in France.\n\nBronson appeared in a French action film, \"Guns for San Sebastian\" (1968) alongside Anthony Quinn. In Britain, he was cast in the lead of \"Lola\" (1969), playing a middle-aged man in love with a 16-year-old girl. He then made a buddy comedy with Tony Curtis in Turkey, \"You Can't Win 'Em All\" (1970).\n\nBronson then played the lead in a French thriller, \"Rider on the Rain\" (1970) which was a big hit in France. It won a Hollywood Golden Globe Award for Best Foreign Language Film.\n\nBronson starred in some French-Italian action films, \"Violent City\" (1970) and \"Cold Sweat\" (1970), the latter directed by Terence Young. He was in a French thriller, \"Someone Behind the Door\" (1971) alongside Anthony Perkins, then starred in another directed by Young, the French-Spanish-Italian Western, \"Red Sun\" (1971). \"The Valachi Papers\" (1972) was a third with Young; Bronson played Joseph Valachi.\nThat year, this overseas fame earned him a special Golden Globe Henrietta Award for \"World Film Favorite - Male\" together with Sean Connery.\n\nIn 1972 Bronson began a string of successful action films for United Artists, beginning with \"Chato's Land\" (1972), although he had done several films for UA before this in the 1960s (\"The Magnificent Seven\", etc.).\n\n\"Chato's Land\" was the first film Bronson made with director Michael Winner. Winner was reunited with Bronson in \"The Mechanic\" (1972) and \"The Stone Killer\" (1973). Bronson worked with Sturges on \"Chino\" (1973), then did \"Mr. Majestyk\" (1974) with Richard Fleischer based on a book by Elmore Leonard.\n\nOne film UA brought into the domestic mainstream was \"Violent City\", an Italian-made film originally released overseas in 1970, but not issued in the U.S. until 1974 under the title \"The Family\".\n\nBronson's most famous role came when he was age 52, in \"Death Wish\", the most popular film with director Michael Winner. He played Paul Kersey, a successful New York architect who turns into a crime-fighting vigilante after his wife is murdered and his daughter sexually assaulted. This movie spawned four sequels over the next two decades, all starring Bronson.\n\nBronson starred in two films directed by Tom Gries: \"Breakout\" (1975), and \"Breakheart Pass\" (1975), a Western adapted from a novel by Alistair Maclean, which was a box office disappointment. He also starred in the directorial debut of Walter Hill, \"Hard Times\" (1975), playing a Depression-era street fighter making his living in illegal bare-knuckled matches in Louisiana. He earned good reviews. Bronson reached his pinnacle in box-office drawing power in 1975, when he was ranked 4th, behind only Robert Redford, Barbra Streisand, and Al Pacino.\n\nBronson did a Western comedy for UA, \"From Noon till Three\" (1976) but it was not well received. At Warner Bros he made \"St. Ives\" (1976), his first film with director J. Lee Thompson. He played Dan Shomron in \"Raid on Entebbe\" (1977), then was reunited with Thompson in \"The White Buffalo\" (1977), produced by Dino de Laurentiis for UA. UA also released \"Telefon\" (1977), directed by Don Siegel.\n\nBronson went on to make two films for ITC, \"Love and Bullets\" (1979) and \"Borderline\" (1980). He was reunited with Thompson on \"Caboblanco\" (1980), and played Albert Johnson in \"Death Hunt\" (1981), opposite Lee Marvin.\n\nIn the years between 1976 and 1994, Bronson commanded high salaries to star in numerous films made by smaller production companies, most notably Cannon Films, for whom some of his last films were made.\n\nBronson was paid $1.5 million by Cannon to star in \"Death Wish II\" (1982), directed by Michael Winner.\" In the story, architect Paul Kersey (Bronson) moves to Los Angeles with his daughter. After she is murdered at the hands of several gang members, Kersey is once again forced to become a vigilante. The film was a big success at the box office.\n\nCannon Films promptly hired Bronson for \"10 to Midnight\" (1983). The movie marks the fourth collaboration between Bronson and director J. Lee Thompson, where Bronson played a cop chasing a serial killer. The supporting cast that includes Lisa Eilbacher, Andrew Stevens, Gene Davis, Geoffrey Lewis, and Wilford Brimley.\n\nITC Entertainment hired Thompson and Bronson for \"The Evil That Men Do\" (1984), co-starring Theresa Saldana, and Joseph Maher. The film was adapted by David Lee Henry and John Crowther from the novel of the same name by R. Lance Hill. Bronson plays a former assassin, who comes out of retirement to avenge the death of his journalist friend.\n\nThen Cannon reunited Bronson and Winner for \"Death Wish 3\" (1985). It is the last to be directed by Michael Winner. Kersey returns to battle with New York street punk gangs while receiving tacit support from a local NYPD lieutenant (Ed Lauter).\n\nBronson did \"Murphy's Law\" (1986) for Cannon with Thompson. It co-stars Carrie Snodgress, and Kathleen Wilhoite. Jack Murphy (Bronson), a hardened, antisocial LAPD detective, frequently escapes the harsh reality that his ex-wife (Tompkins) has become a stripper and his career is going nowhere by drinking. His world is turned upside down, however, when he is framed by ex-convict Joan Freeman (Snodgress) for putting her in prison earlier in his career.\n\nBronson had a slight change of pace with a television film, \"Act of Vengeance\" (1986) playing real-life union worker Joseph Yablonski (Bronson) directed by John Mackenzie. The movie is based on the book, \"Act of Vengeance\" by Trevor Armbrister, a fact-based story about the corruption that occurred during the United Mine Workers' presidential elections in 1969. It premiered on April 21, 1986.\n\nMore typical of this period were four Cannon action films: \"Assassination\" (1987) directed by Peter Hunt, and three with Thompson: \"\" (1988), \"Messenger of Death\" (1989) and \"\" (1989).\n\nBronson's first non action film in a long time was \"The Indian Runner\" (1991), directed by Sean Penn. He followed this with some TV movies, \"Yes, Virginia, there is a Santa Claus\" and \"The Sea Wolf\" (1993).\n\nBronson's last starring role in a theatrically released film was 1994's \"\". His final films were the TV movies \"Family of Cops\" (1995), \"\" (1997) and \"Family of Cops 3\" (1999).\n\nIngmar Bergman wanted to make a film with Bronson but the actor turned him down. \"Everything is weakness and sickness with Bergman,\" he said.\n\nHe was considered for the role of Snake Plissken in \"Escape from New York\" (1981), but director John Carpenter thought he was too tough looking and too old for the part, and decided to cast Kurt Russell instead.\n\nBronson auditioned for the role of Superman for the 1978 film adaptation, but producer Ilya Salkind turned him down for being too earthy and decided to cast Christopher Reeve.\n\nHis first marriage was to Harriet Tendler, whom he met when both were fledgling actors in Philadelphia. They had two children before divorcing in 1965. She wrote in her memoir that she \"was an 18-year-old virgin when she met the 26-year-old Charlie Buchinsky at a Philadelphia acting school in 1947. Two years later, with the grudging consent of her father, a successful, Jewish dairy farmer, Tendler wed Buchinsky, a Catholic and a former coal miner. Tendler supported them both while she and Charlie pursued their acting dreams. On their first date, he had four cents in his pocket — and went on, now as Charles Bronson, to become one of the highest paid actors in the country.\" \n\nBronson was married to English actress Jill Ireland from October 5, 1968, until her death in 1990. He had met her in 1962, when she was married to Scottish actor David McCallum. At the time, Bronson (who shared the screen with McCallum in \"The Great Escape\") reportedly told him, \"I'm going to marry your wife\". The Bronsons lived in a grand Bel Air mansion in Los Angeles with seven children: two by his previous marriage, three by hers (one of whom was adopted) and two of their own (another one of whom was adopted). After they married, she often played his leading lady, and they starred in fourteen films together.\n\nTo maintain a close family, they would load up everyone and take them to wherever filming was taking place, so that they could all be together. They spent time in a colonial farmhouse on in West Windsor, Vermont, where Ireland raised horses and provided training for their daughter Zuleika so that she could perform at the higher levels of horse showing. The Vermont farm, \"Zuleika Farm\", was named for the only natural child between them. During the late 1980s through the mid-1990s Bronson regularly spent winter holidays vacationing with his family in Snowmass, Colorado.\n\nOn May 18, 1990, aged 54, after a long battle with breast cancer, Jill Ireland died of the disease at their home in Malibu, California. In December 1998, Bronson was married for a third time to Kim Weeks, a former employee of Dove Audio who had helped record Ireland in the production of her audiobooks. The couple were married for five years until Bronson's death in 2003.\n\nBronson's health deteriorated in his later years, and he retired from acting after undergoing hip-replacement surgery in August 1998. Bronson died at age 81 on August 30, 2003, at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles.\n\nAlthough pneumonia and/or Alzheimer's disease have been cited as his cause of death, neither appears on his death certificate, which cites \"respiratory failure\", \"metastatic lung cancer\", with, secondarily, \"chronic obstructive pulmonary disease\" and \"congestive cardiomyopathy\" as the causes of death. He was interred at Brownsville Cemetery in West Windsor, Vermont.\n\n"}
{"id": "555480", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=555480", "title": "Chromosome (genetic algorithm)", "text": "Chromosome (genetic algorithm)\n\nIn genetic algorithms, a chromosome (also sometimes called a genotype) is a set of parameters which define a proposed solution to the problem that the genetic algorithm is trying to solve. The set of all solutions is known as the \"population\". The chromosome is often represented as a binary string, although a wide variety of other data structures are also used.\n\nThe design of the chromosome and its parameters is by necessity specific to the problem to be solved. Traditionally, chromosomes are represented in binary as strings of 0s and 1s, however other encodings are also possible; almost any representation which allows the solution to be represented as a finite-length string can be used. Finding a suitable representation of the problem domain for a chromosome is an important consideration, as a good representation will make the search easier by limiting the search space; similarly, a poorer representation will allow a larger search space. The mutation operator and crossover operator employed by the genetic algorithm must also take into account the chromosome's design.\n\nSuppose the problem is to find the integer value of formula_1 between 0 and 255 that provides the maximal result for formula_2. The possible solutions for this problem are the integers from 0 to 255, which can all be represented as 8-digit binary strings. Thus, we might use an 8-digit binary string as our chromosome. If a given chromosome in the population represents the value 155, its chromosome would be codice_1.\n\nNote that this is not the type of problem that is normally solved by a genetic algorithm, since it can be trivially solved using numeric methods; it is only used to serve as a simple example.\n\nA more realistic problem we might wish to solve is the travelling salesman problem. In this problem, we seek an ordered list of cities that results in the shortest trip for the salesman to travel. Suppose there are six cities, which we'll call A, B, C, D, E, and F. A good design for our chromosome might be the ordered list we want to try. An example chromosome we might encounter in the population might be codice_2.\n\nIn each generation of the genetic algorithm, two parent chromosomes are selected based on their fitness values; these chromosomes are used by the mutation and crossover operators to produce two offspring chromosomes for the new population.\n"}
{"id": "6910", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6910", "title": "Cloning", "text": "Cloning\n\nCloning is the process of producing genetically identical individuals of an organism either naturally or artificially. In nature, many organisms produce clones through asexual reproduction. Cloning in biotechnology refers to the process of creating clones of organisms or copies of cells or DNA fragments (molecular cloning). Beyond biology, the term refers to the production of multiple copies of digital media or software.\n\nThe term clone, invented by J. B. S. Haldane, is derived from the Ancient Greek word κλών \"klōn\", \"twig\", referring to the process whereby a new plant can be created from a twig. In botany, the term lusus was traditionally used. In horticulture, the spelling \"clon\" was used until the twentieth century; the final \"e\" came into use to indicate the vowel is a \"long o\" instead of a \"short o\". Since the term entered the popular lexicon in a more general context, the spelling \"clone\" has been used exclusively.\n\nCloning is a natural form of reproduction that has allowed life forms to spread for hundreds of millions of years. It is the reproduction method used by plants, fungi, and bacteria, and is also the way that clonal colonies reproduce themselves. Examples of these organisms include blueberry plants, hazel trees, the Pando trees, the Kentucky coffeetree, \"Myrica\"s, and the American sweetgum.\n\nMolecular cloning refers to the process of making multiple molecules. Cloning is commonly used to amplify DNA fragments containing whole genes, but it can also be used to amplify any DNA sequence such as promoters, non-coding sequences and randomly fragmented DNA. It is used in a wide array of biological experiments and practical applications ranging from genetic fingerprinting to large scale protein production. Occasionally, the term cloning is misleadingly used to refer to the identification of the chromosomal location of a gene associated with a particular phenotype of interest, such as in positional cloning. In practice, localization of the gene to a chromosome or genomic region does not necessarily enable one to isolate or amplify the relevant genomic sequence. To amplify any DNA sequence in a living organism, that sequence must be linked to an origin of replication, which is a sequence of DNA capable of directing the propagation of itself and any linked sequence. However, a number of other features are needed, and a variety of specialised cloning vectors (small piece of DNA into which a foreign DNA fragment can be inserted) exist that allow protein production, affinity tagging, single stranded RNA or DNA production and a host of other molecular biology tools.\n\nCloning of any DNA fragment essentially involves four steps\n\nAlthough these steps are invariable among cloning procedures a number of alternative routes can be selected; these are summarized as a \"cloning strategy\".\n\nInitially, the DNA of interest needs to be isolated to provide a DNA segment of suitable size. Subsequently, a ligation procedure is used where the amplified fragment is inserted into a vector (piece of DNA). The vector (which is frequently circular) is linearised using restriction enzymes, and incubated with the fragment of interest under appropriate conditions with an enzyme called DNA ligase. Following ligation the vector with the insert of interest is transfected into cells. A number of alternative techniques are available, such as chemical sensitivation of cells, electroporation, optical injection and biolistics. Finally, the transfected cells are cultured. As the aforementioned procedures are of particularly low efficiency, there is a need to identify the cells that have been successfully transfected with the vector construct containing the desired insertion sequence in the required orientation. Modern cloning vectors include selectable antibiotic resistance markers, which allow only cells in which the vector has been transfected, to grow. Additionally, the cloning vectors may contain colour selection markers, which provide blue/white screening (alpha-factor complementation) on X-gal medium. Nevertheless, these selection steps do not absolutely guarantee that the DNA insert is present in the cells obtained. Further investigation of the resulting colonies must be required to confirm that cloning was successful. This may be accomplished by means of PCR, restriction fragment analysis and/or DNA sequencing.\n\nCloning a cell means to derive a population of cells from a single cell. In the case of unicellular organisms such as bacteria and yeast, this process is remarkably simple and essentially only requires the inoculation of the appropriate medium. However, in the case of cell cultures from multi-cellular organisms, cell cloning is an arduous task as these cells will not readily grow in standard media.\n\nA useful tissue culture technique used to clone distinct lineages of cell lines involves the use of cloning rings (cylinders). In this technique a single-cell suspension of cells that have been exposed to a mutagenic agent or drug used to drive selection is plated at high dilution to create isolated colonies, each arising from a single and potentially clonal distinct cell. At an early growth stage when colonies consist of only a few cells, sterile polystyrene rings (cloning rings), which have been dipped in grease, are placed over an individual colony and a small amount of trypsin is added. Cloned cells are collected from inside the ring and transferred to a new vessel for further growth.\n\nSomatic-cell nuclear transfer, known as SCNT, can also be used to create embryos for research or therapeutic purposes. The most likely purpose for this is to produce embryos for use in stem cell research. This process is also called \"research cloning\" or \"therapeutic cloning.\" The goal is not to create cloned human beings (called \"reproductive cloning\"), but rather to harvest stem cells that can be used to study human development and to potentially treat disease. While a clonal human blastocyst has been created, stem cell lines are yet to be isolated from a clonal source.\n\nTherapeutic cloning is achieved by creating embryonic stem cells in the hopes of treating diseases such as diabetes and Alzheimer's. The process begins by removing the nucleus (containing the DNA) from an egg cell and inserting a nucleus from the adult cell to be cloned. In the case of someone with Alzheimer's disease, the nucleus from a skin cell of that patient is placed into an empty egg. The reprogrammed cell begins to develop into an embryo because the egg reacts with the transferred nucleus. The embryo will become genetically identical to the patient. The embryo will then form a blastocyst which has the potential to form/become any cell in the body.\n\nThe reason why SCNT is used for cloning is because somatic cells can be easily acquired and cultured in the lab. This process can either add or delete specific genomes of farm animals. A key point to remember is that cloning is achieved when the oocyte maintains its normal functions and instead of using sperm and egg genomes to replicate, the oocyte is inserted into the donor's somatic cell nucleus. The oocyte will react on the somatic cell nucleus, the same way it would on sperm cells.\n\nThe process of cloning a particular farm animal using SCNT is relatively the same for all animals. The first step is to collect the somatic cells from the animal that will be cloned. The somatic cells could be used immediately or stored in the laboratory for later use. The hardest part of SCNT is removing maternal DNA from an oocyte at metaphase II. Once this has been done, the somatic nucleus can be inserted into an egg cytoplasm. This creates a one-cell embryo. The grouped somatic cell and egg cytoplasm are then introduced to an electrical current. This energy will hopefully allow the cloned embryo to begin development. The successfully developed embryos are then placed in surrogate recipients, such as a cow or sheep in the case of farm animals.\n\nSCNT is seen as a good method for producing agriculture animals for food consumption. It successfully cloned sheep, cattle, goats, and pigs. Another benefit is SCNT is seen as a solution to clone endangered species that are on the verge of going extinct. However, stresses placed on both the egg cell and the introduced nucleus can be enormous, which led to a high loss in resulting cells in early research. For example, the cloned sheep Dolly was born after 277 eggs were used for SCNT, which created 29 viable embryos. Only three of these embryos survived until birth, and only one survived to adulthood. As the procedure could not be automated, and had to be performed manually under a microscope, SCNT was very resource intensive. The biochemistry involved in reprogramming the differentiated somatic cell nucleus and activating the recipient egg was also far from being well understood. However, by 2014 researchers were reporting cloning success rates of seven to eight out of ten and in 2016, a Korean Company Sooam Biotech was reported to be producing 500 cloned embryos per day.\n\nIn SCNT, not all of the donor cell's genetic information is transferred, as the donor cell's mitochondria that contain their own mitochondrial DNA are left behind. The resulting hybrid cells retain those mitochondrial structures which originally belonged to the egg. As a consequence, clones such as Dolly that are born from SCNT are not perfect copies of the donor of the nucleus.\n\nOrganism cloning (also called reproductive cloning) refers to the procedure of creating a new multicellular organism, genetically identical to another. In essence this form of cloning is an asexual method of reproduction, where fertilization or inter-gamete contact does not take place. Asexual reproduction is a naturally occurring phenomenon in many species, including most plants and some insects. Scientists have made some major achievements with cloning, including the asexual reproduction of sheep and cows. There is a lot of ethical debate over whether or not cloning should be used. However, cloning, or asexual propagation, has been common practice in the horticultural world for hundreds of years.\n\nThe term \"clone\" is used in horticulture to refer to descendants of a single plant which were produced by vegetative reproduction or apomixis. Many horticultural plant cultivars are clones, having been derived from a single individual, multiplied by some process other than sexual reproduction. As an example, some European cultivars of grapes represent clones that have been propagated for over two millennia. Other examples are potato and banana. Grafting can be regarded as cloning, since all the shoots and branches coming from the graft are genetically a clone of a single individual, but this particular kind of cloning has not come under ethical scrutiny and is generally treated as an entirely different kind of operation.\n\nMany trees, shrubs, vines, ferns and other herbaceous perennials form clonal colonies naturally. Parts of an individual plant may become detached by fragmentation and grow on to become separate clonal individuals. A common example is in the vegetative reproduction of moss and liverwort gametophyte clones by means of gemmae. Some vascular plants e.g. dandelion and certain viviparous grasses also form seeds asexually, termed apomixis, resulting in clonal populations of genetically identical individuals.\n\nClonal derivation exists in nature in some animal species and is referred to as parthenogenesis (reproduction of an organism by itself without a mate). This is an asexual form of reproduction that is only found in females of some insects, crustaceans, nematodes, fish (for example the hammerhead shark), the Komodo dragon and lizards. The growth and development occurs without fertilization by a male. In plants, parthenogenesis means the development of an embryo from an unfertilized egg cell, and is a component process of apomixis. In species that use the XY sex-determination system, the offspring will always be female. An example is the little fire ant (\"Wasmannia auropunctata\"), which is native to Central and South America but has spread throughout many tropical environments.\n\nArtificial cloning of organisms may also be called \"reproductive cloning\".\n\nHans Spemann, a German embryologist was awarded a Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1935 for his discovery of the effect now known as embryonic induction, exercised by various parts of the embryo, that directs the development of groups of cells into particular tissues and organs. In 1928 he and his student, Hilde Mangold, were the first to perform somatic-cell nuclear transfer using amphibian embryos – one of the first steps towards cloning.\n\nReproductive cloning generally uses \"somatic cell nuclear transfer\" (SCNT) to create animals that are genetically identical. This process entails the transfer of a nucleus from a donor adult cell (somatic cell) to an egg from which the nucleus has been removed, or to a cell from a blastocyst from which the nucleus has been removed. If the egg begins to divide normally it is transferred into the uterus of the surrogate mother. Such clones are not strictly identical since the somatic cells may contain mutations in their nuclear DNA. Additionally, the mitochondria in the cytoplasm also contains DNA and during SCNT this mitochondrial DNA is wholly from the cytoplasmic donor's egg, thus the mitochondrial genome is not the same as that of the nucleus donor cell from which it was produced. This may have important implications for cross-species nuclear transfer in which nuclear-mitochondrial incompatibilities may lead to death.\n\nArtificial \"embryo splitting\" or \"embryo twinning\", a technique that creates monozygotic twins from a single embryo, is not considered in the same fashion as other methods of cloning. During that procedure, a donor embryo is split in two distinct embryos, that can then be transferred via embryo transfer. It is optimally performed at the 6- to 8-cell stage, where it can be used as an expansion of IVF to increase the number of available embryos. If both embryos are successful, it gives rise to monozygotic (identical) twins.\n\nDolly, a Finn-Dorset ewe, was the first mammal to have been successfully cloned from an adult somatic cell. Dolly was formed by taking a cell from the udder of her 6-year old biological mother. Dolly's embryo was created by taking the cell and inserting it into a sheep ovum. It took 434 attempts before an embryo was successful. The embryo was then placed inside a female sheep that went through a normal pregnancy. She was cloned at the Roslin Institute in Scotland by British scientists Sir Ian Wilmut and Keith Campbell and lived there from her birth in 1996 until her death in 2003 when she was six. She was born on 5 July 1996 but not announced to the world until 22 February 1997. Her stuffed remains were placed at Edinburgh's Royal Museum, part of the National Museums of Scotland.\n\nDolly was publicly significant because the effort showed that genetic material from a specific adult cell, programmed to express only a distinct subset of its genes, can be reprogrammed to grow an entirely new organism. Before this demonstration, it had been shown by John Gurdon that nuclei from differentiated cells could give rise to an entire organism after transplantation into an enucleated egg. However, this concept was not yet demonstrated in a mammalian system.\n\nThe first mammalian cloning (resulting in Dolly the sheep) had a success rate of 29 embryos per 277 fertilized eggs, which produced three lambs at birth, one of which lived. In a bovine experiment involving 70 cloned calves, one-third of the calves died young. The first successfully cloned horse, Prometea, took 814 attempts. Notably, although the first clones were frogs, no adult cloned frog has yet been produced from a somatic adult nucleus donor cell.\n\nThere were early claims that Dolly the sheep had pathologies resembling accelerated aging. Scientists speculated that Dolly's death in 2003 was related to the shortening of telomeres, DNA-protein complexes that protect the end of linear chromosomes. However, other researchers, including Ian Wilmut who led the team that successfully cloned Dolly, argue that Dolly's early death due to respiratory infection was unrelated to deficiencies with the cloning process. This idea that the nuclei have not irreversibly aged was shown in 2013 to be true for mice.\n\nDolly was named after performer Dolly Parton because the cells cloned to make her were from a mammary gland cell, and Parton is known for her ample cleavage.\n\nThe modern cloning techniques involving nuclear transfer have been successfully performed on several species. Notable experiments include:\n\nHuman cloning is the creation of a genetically identical copy of a human. The term is generally used to refer to artificial human cloning, which is the reproduction of human cells and tissues. It does not refer to the natural conception and delivery of identical twins. The possibility of human cloning has raised controversies. These ethical concerns have prompted several nations to pass legislation regarding human cloning and its legality. As of right now, scientists have no intention of trying to clone people and they believe their results should spark a wider discussion about the laws and regulations the world needs to regulate cloning.\n\nTwo commonly discussed types of theoretical human cloning are \"therapeutic cloning\" and \"reproductive cloning\". Therapeutic cloning would involve cloning cells from a human for use in medicine and transplants, and is an active area of research, but is not in medical practice anywhere in the world, . Two common methods of therapeutic cloning that are being researched are somatic-cell nuclear transfer and, more recently, pluripotent stem cell induction. Reproductive cloning would involve making an entire cloned human, instead of just specific cells or tissues.\n\nThere are a variety of ethical positions regarding the possibilities of cloning, especially human cloning. While many of these views are religious in origin, the questions raised by cloning are faced by secular perspectives as well. Perspectives on human cloning are theoretical, as human therapeutic and reproductive cloning are not commercially used; animals are currently cloned in laboratories and in livestock production.\n\nAdvocates support development of therapeutic cloning in order to generate tissues and whole organs to treat patients who otherwise cannot obtain transplants, to avoid the need for immunosuppressive drugs, and to stave off the effects of aging. Advocates for reproductive cloning believe that parents who cannot otherwise procreate should have access to the technology.\n\nOpponents of cloning have concerns that technology is not yet developed enough to be safe and that it could be prone to abuse (leading to the generation of humans from whom organs and tissues would be harvested), as well as concerns about how cloned individuals could integrate with families and with society at large.\n\nReligious groups are divided, with some opposing the technology as usurping \"God's place\" and, to the extent embryos are used, destroying a human life; others support therapeutic cloning's potential life-saving benefits.\n\nCloning of animals is opposed by animal-groups due to the number of cloned animals that suffer from malformations before they die, and while food from cloned animals has been approved by the US FDA, its use is opposed by groups concerned about food safety.\n\nCloning, or more precisely, the reconstruction of functional DNA from extinct species has, for decades, been a dream. Possible implications of this were dramatized in the 1984 novel \"Carnosaur\" and the 1990 novel \"Jurassic Park\". The best current cloning techniques have an average success rate of 9.4 percent (and as high as 25 percent) when working with familiar species such as mice, while cloning wild animals is usually less than 1 percent successful. Several tissue banks have come into existence, including the \"Frozen Zoo\" at the San Diego Zoo, to store frozen tissue from the world's rarest and most endangered species.\n\nIn 2001, a cow named Bessie gave birth to a cloned Asian gaur, an endangered species, but the calf died after two days. In 2003, a banteng was successfully cloned, followed by three African wildcats from a thawed frozen embryo. These successes provided hope that similar techniques (using surrogate mothers of another species) might be used to clone extinct species. Anticipating this possibility, tissue samples from the last \"bucardo\" (Pyrenean ibex) were frozen in liquid nitrogen immediately after it died in 2000. Researchers are also considering cloning endangered species such as the giant panda and cheetah.\n\nIn 2002, geneticists at the Australian Museum announced that they had replicated DNA of the thylacine (Tasmanian tiger), at the time extinct for about 65 years, using polymerase chain reaction. However, on 15 February 2005 the museum announced that it was stopping the project after tests showed the specimens' DNA had been too badly degraded by the (ethanol) preservative. On 15 May 2005 it was announced that the thylacine project would be revived, with new participation from researchers in New South Wales and Victoria.\n\nIn 2003, for the first time, an extinct animal, the Pyrenean ibex mentioned above was cloned, at the Centre of Food Technology and Research of Aragon, using the preserved frozen cell nucleus of the skin samples from 2001 and domestic goat egg-cells. The ibex died shortly after birth due to physical defects in its lungs.\n\nOne of the most anticipated targets for cloning was once the woolly mammoth, but attempts to extract DNA from frozen mammoths have been unsuccessful, though a joint Russo-Japanese team is currently working toward this goal. In January 2011, it was reported by Yomiuri Shimbun that a team of scientists headed by Akira Iritani of Kyoto University had built upon research by Dr. Wakayama, saying that they will extract DNA from a mammoth carcass that had been preserved in a Russian laboratory and insert it into the egg cells of an African elephant in hopes of producing a mammoth embryo. The researchers said they hoped to produce a baby mammoth within six years. It was noted, however that the result, if possible, would be an elephant-mammoth hybrid rather than a true mammoth. Another problem is the survival of the reconstructed mammoth: ruminants rely on a symbiosis with specific microbiota in their stomachs for digestion.\n\nScientists at the University of Newcastle and University of New South Wales announced in March 2013 that the very recently extinct gastric-brooding frog would be the subject of a cloning attempt to resurrect the species.\n\nMany such \"De-extinction\" projects are described in the Long Now Foundation's Revive and Restore Project.\n\nAfter an eight-year project involving the use of a pioneering cloning technique, Japanese researchers created 25 generations of healthy cloned mice with normal lifespans, demonstrating that clones are not intrinsically shorter-lived than naturally born animals. Other sources have noted that the offspring of clones tend to be healthier than the original clones and indistinguishable from animals produced naturally.\n\nDolly the sheep was created from a six year old cell sample from a mammary gland. Because of this, she aged quicker than other naturally born animals because she was started from already aging cells. She died prematurely at six years old, not only from her age but from respiratory issues and severe arthritis. \n\nA detailed study released in 2016 and less detailed studies by others suggest that once cloned animals get past the first month or two of life they are generally healthy. However, early pregnancy loss and neonatal losses are still greater with cloning than natural conception or assisted reproduction (IVF). Current research is attempting to overcome these problems.\n\nDiscussion of cloning in the popular media often presents the subject negatively. In an article in the 8 November 1993 article of \"Time\", cloning was portrayed in a negative way, modifying Michelangelo's \"Creation of Adam\" to depict Adam with five identical hands. \"Newsweek\" 10 March 1997 issue also critiqued the ethics of human cloning, and included a graphic depicting identical babies in beakers.\n\nThe concept of cloning, particularly human cloning, has featured a wide variety of science fiction works. An early fictional depiction of cloning is Bokanovsky's Process which features in Aldous Huxley's 1931 dystopian novel \"Brave New World\". The process is applied to fertilized human eggs \"in vitro\", causing them to split into identical genetic copies of the original. Following renewed interest in cloning in the 1950s, the subject was explored further in works such as Poul Anderson's 1953 story \"UN-Man\", which describes a technology called \"exogenesis\", and Gordon Rattray Taylor's book \"The Biological Time Bomb\", which popularised the term \"cloning\" in 1963.\n\nCloning is a recurring theme in a number of contemporary science fiction films, ranging from action films such as \"Jurassic Park\" (1993), \"Alien Resurrection\" (1997), \"The 6th Day\" (2000), \"Resident Evil\" (2002), \"\" (2002) and \"The Island\" (2005), to comedies such as Woody Allen's 1973 film \"Sleeper\".\n\nThe process of cloning is represented variously in fiction. Many works depict the artificial creation of humans by a method of growing cells from a tissue or DNA sample; the replication may be instantaneous, or take place through slow growth of human embryos in artificial wombs. In the long-running British television series \"Doctor Who\", the Fourth Doctor and his companion Leela were cloned in a matter of seconds from DNA samples (\"The Invisible Enemy\", 1977) and then — in an apparent homage to the 1966 film \"Fantastic Voyage\" — shrunk to microscopic size in order to enter the Doctor's body to combat an alien virus. The clones in this story are short-lived, and can only survive a matter of minutes before they expire. Science fiction films such as \"The Matrix\" and \"Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones\" have featured scenes of human foetuses being cultured on an industrial scale in mechanical tanks.\n\nCloning humans from body parts is also a common theme in science fiction. Cloning features strongly among the science fiction conventions parodied in Woody Allen's \"Sleeper\", the plot of which centres around an attempt to clone an assassinated dictator from his disembodied nose. In the 2008 \"Doctor Who\" story \"Journey's End\", a duplicate version of the Tenth Doctor spontaneously grows from his severed hand, which had been cut off in a sword fight during an earlier episode.\n\nAfter the death of her beloved 14-year old Coton de Tulear named Samantha in late 2017, Barbra Streisand announced that she had cloned the dog, and was now \"waiting for [the two cloned pups] to get older so [she] can see if they have [Samantha's] brown eyes and her seriousness.\" The operation cost $50,000 through the pet cloning company ViaGen.\n\nScience fiction has used cloning, most commonly and specifically human cloning, to raise the controversial questions of identity. \"A Number\" is a 2002 play by English playwright Caryl Churchill which addresses the subject of human cloning and identity, especially nature and nurture. The story, set in the near future, is structured around the conflict between a father (Salter) and his sons (Bernard 1, Bernard 2, and Michael Black) – two of whom are clones of the first one. \"A Number\" was adapted by Caryl Churchill for television, in a co-production between the BBC and HBO Films.\n\nIn 2012, a Japanese television series named \"Bunshin\" was created. The story's main character, Mariko, is a woman studying child welfare in Hokkaido. She grew up always doubtful about the love from her mother, who looked nothing like her and who died nine years before. One day, she finds some of her mother's belongings at a relative's house, and heads to Tokyo to seek out the truth behind her birth. She later discovered that she was a clone.\n\nIn the 2013 television series \"Orphan Black\", cloning is used as a scientific study on the behavioral adaptation of the clones. In a similar vein, the book \"The Double\" by Nobel Prize winner José Saramago explores the emotional experience of a man who discovers that he is a clone.\n\nCloning has been used in fiction as a way of recreating historical figures. In the 1976 Ira Levin novel \"The Boys from Brazil\" and its 1978 film adaptation, Josef Mengele uses cloning to create copies of Adolf Hitler.\n\nIn Michael Crichton's 1990 novel \"Jurassic Park\", which spawned a series of \"Jurassic Park\" feature films, a bioengineering company develops a technique to resurrect extinct species of dinosaurs by creating cloned creatures using DNA extracted from fossils. The cloned dinosaurs are used to populate the Jurassic Park wildlife park for the entertainment of visitors. The scheme goes disastrously wrong when the dinosaurs escape their enclosures. Despite being selectively cloned as females to prevent them from breeding, the dinosaurs develop the ability to reproduce through parthenogenesis.\n\nThe use of cloning for military purposes has also been explored in several fictional works. In \"Doctor Who\", an alien race of armour-clad, warlike beings called Sontarans was introduced in the 1973 serial \"The Time Warrior\". Sontarans are depicted as squat, bald creatures who have been genetically engineered for combat. Their weak spot is a \"probic vent\", a small socket at the back of their neck which is associated with the cloning process. The concept of cloned soldiers being bred for combat was revisited in \"The Doctor's Daughter\" (2008), when the Doctor's DNA is used to create a female warrior called Jenny.\n\nThe 1977 film \"Star Wars\" was set against the backdrop of a historical conflict called the Clone Wars. The events of this war were not fully explored until the prequel films \"\" (2002) and \"\" (2005), which depict a space war waged by a massive army of heavily armoured clone troopers that leads to the foundation of the Galactic Empire. Cloned soldiers are \"manufactured\" on an industrial scale, genetically conditioned for obedience and combat effectiveness. It is also revealed that the popular character Boba Fett originated as a clone of Jango Fett, a mercenary who served as the genetic template for the clone troopers.\n\nA recurring sub-theme of cloning fiction is the use of clones as a supply of organs for transplantation. The 2005 Kazuo Ishiguro novel \"Never Let Me Go\" and the 2010 film adaption are set in an alternate history in which cloned humans are created for the sole purpose of providing organ donations to naturally born humans, despite the fact that they are fully sentient and self-aware. The 2005 film \"The Island\" revolves around a similar plot, with the exception that the clones are unaware of the reason for their existence.\n\nThe exploitation of human clones for dangerous and undesirable work was examined in the 2009 British science fiction film \"Moon\". In the futuristic novel \"Cloud Atlas\" and subsequent film, one of the story lines focuses on a genetically-engineered fabricant clone named Sonmi~451, one of millions raised in an artificial \"wombtank,\" destined to serve from birth. She is one of thousands created for manual and emotional labor; Sonmi herself works as a server in a restaurant. She later discovers that the sole source of food for clones, called 'Soap', is manufactured from the clones themselves.\n\n\n\n"}

He was found in a modern peat harvesting machine, which was possibly responsible for the severing of his lower body. He had a squashed nose and crooked teeth. Pores are visible on the nose, and he had a thin beard.\n\nClonycavan Man has formed part of an exhibit in the National Museum of Ireland in Dublin - and featured in the exhibition \"Kingship and Sacrifice\", 2006-2007.\n\nIt has been suggested that Clonycavan Man had once been a king and was ritually sacrificed.\n\nClonycavan Man is believed to have been murdered, based on an examination of the evidence found on his body by the Garda Technical Bureau (Irish Police Forensic Division). His skull was split open by a sharp implement. There is a deep wound on the top of his head, and parts of his brain have been found in this wound. There is also a large laceration across the bridge of his nose leading under his right eye. This is believed to be the blow that killed him. Both injuries seem to have been caused by the same sharp implement, most likely an axe. His death is believed to be that of a ritual sacrifice. Radiocarbon dating has placed his death to between 392 BCE and 201 BCE, during the Iron Age of western Europe, making his remains around 2,300 years old.\n\nScientific study of his hair has shed light on Clonycavan Man's diet leading up to his death. His diet was rich in vegetables and proteins, which indicates that he may have been killed during the warmer summer months of the year. Clonycavan Man was also fairly young at the time of his death; he is believed to have been in his early twenties. Such sacrifices were performed due to the possible belief that the current king of a certain region was responsible for poor harvests or other attributes, and a sacrifice such as this would please the goddess of fertility. A hill that was likely used for kingship ceremonies was near the bog where Clonycavan Man was found; it may have been where he was initiated as a king.\n\nThe most distinguishing feature of the man was his hairstyle, which was raised upon his head with the help of a \"hair gel\" of plant oil and pine resin, imported from south-western France or Northern Spain. Remnants of a hair tie was also found on the corpse. This may attest to trade between Ireland and southern Europe in the fourth and third centuries BCE, before Roman influence was brought to bear on the Celts of Iberia. This could also suggest that he was wealthy, as few others would have been able to buy imported cosmetics. The hairstyle was possibly a way to make the man appear taller, as examination of his remains suggests that he was only five feet two inches tall (157.48 cm).\n\n"}

It rates an individual's degree of suicidal ideation on a scale, ranging from \"wish to be dead\" to \"active suicidal ideation with specific plan and intent and behaviors.\" Questions are phrased for use in an interview format, but the C-SSRS may be completed as a self-report measure if necessary. The scale identifies specific behaviors which may be indicative of an individual's intent to complete suicide. An individual exhibiting even a single behavior identified by the scale was 8 to 10 times more likely to complete suicide.\n\nPatients are asked about \"general non-specific thoughts of wanting to end one’s life/complete suicide\" and if they have had \"...thoughts of suicide and have thought of at least one method during the assessment period.\" They are asked if they have \"active suicidal thoughts of killing oneself...[and] any intent to act on such thoughts.\" They are asked how frequently they have these thoughts, how long the thoughts last and whether the thoughts can be controlled. They are asked about deterrent factors, and for the reasons for thinking of suicide. They are asked about \"Actual Attempt[s]\", which is a \"potentially self-injurious act completed with at least some wish to die, as a result of act. \"If person pulls trigger while gun is in mouth but gun is broken so no injury results, this is considered an attempt\".They are also asked about Aborted Attempt[s], Interrupted Attempt[s] and Preparatory Behavior[s].\"\n\nThe \"Lifetime/Recent version allows practitioners to gather lifetime history of suicidality as well as any recent suicidal ideation and/or behavior.\" The \"Since Last Visit version of the scale assesses suicidality since the patient’s last visit.\" The \"Screener version of the C-SSRS is a truncated form of the Full Version\" designed for \"first responders, in ER settings and crisis call centers, for non-mental health users like teachers or clergy or in situations where frequent monitoring is required.\" The \"Risk Assessment Page provides a checklist for protective and risk factors for suicidality.\" \n\nThe C-SSRS has been found to be reliable and valid in the identification of suicide risk in several research studies.\n\nThe Screener contains 6 \"yes\" or \"no\" questions in which respondents are asked to indicate whether they have experienced several thoughts or feelings relating to suicide over the past month and behaviors over their lifetime and past 3 months.

{"id": "322461", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=322461", "title": "Dealey Plaza", "text": "Dealey Plaza\n\nDealey Plaza is a city park in the West End district of downtown Dallas, Texas. It is sometimes called the \"birthplace of Dallas\". It also was the location of the assassination of U.S. President John F. Kennedy, on November 22, 1963. The Dealey Plaza Historic District was named a National Historic Landmark in 1993 to preserve Dealey Plaza, street rights-of-way, and buildings and structures by the plaza visible from the assassination site, that have been identified as witness locations or as possible locations for assassins.\n\nThe Dealey Plaza Historic District was added to the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) in 1993 and designated a National Historic Landmark the same year. The former county courthouse is individually listed on the National Register and is also designated a State Antiquities Landmark (SAL) and a Recorded Texas Historic Landmark (RTHL). Additional properties within the district are also RTHLs. The following are contributing properties and other significant buildings within the historic district.:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDealey Plaza and all of the contributing buildings are part of the Westend Historic District (NRHP #78002918, 1978; Dallas Landmark Historic District #H/2, 1975) with the single exception of the U.S. Post Office Terminal Annex which is outside of the boundaries of that district. The Kennedy Memorial and Plaza is the only contributing property not in existence at the time of the assassination nor in view of its site.\n\n\nDealey Plaza was built on land donated by early Dallas philanthropist and businesswoman Sarah Horton Cockrell. It was the location of the first home built in Dallas, which also became the first courthouse and post office, the first store, and the first fraternal lodge. It is sometimes called the \"birthplace of Dallas\". The plaza was completed in 1940 as a WPA project on the west edge of downtown Dallas where three streets converge (Main Street, Elm Street, and Commerce Street) to pass under a railroad bridge known locally as the \"triple underpass.\"\n\nThe plaza is named for George Bannerman Dealey (1859–1946), a civic leader and early publisher of \"The Dallas Morning News\", who had campaigned for the area's revitalization. Monuments outlining the plaza honor previous prominent Dallas residents and predate President John F. Kennedy's visit by many years. The monument honoring President Kennedy, in the form of a cenotaph, is one block away.\n\nDealey Plaza is bounded on the south, east, and north sides by 100+ foot (30+ m) tall buildings. One of those buildings is the former Texas School Book Depository building, from which, both the Warren Commission and the House Select Committee on Assassinations concluded, Lee Harvey Oswald fired a rifle that killed President Kennedy. There is also a grassy knoll on the northwest side of the plaza. At the plaza's west perimeter is a triple underpass beneath a railroad bridge, under which the motorcade raced after the shots were fired.\nToday, the plaza is typically visited daily by tourists. The Sixth Floor Museum now occupies the top two floors of the seven-story former Book Depository. Since 1989, more than six million people have visited the museum.\n\nThe National Park Service designated Dealey Plaza a National Historic Landmark District in 1993, roughly encompassing the area between Pacific Avenue, Market and Jackson Streets and the former railroad tracks. Therefore, nothing of significance has been torn down or rebuilt in the immediate area. (A small plaque commemorating the assassination is located in the plaza.)\n\nVisitors to Dealey Plaza today will see street lights and street signs that were in use in 1963, though some have been moved to different locations and others removed entirely. Buildings immediately surrounding the plaza have not been changed since 1963, presenting a stark contrast to the ultra-modern Dallas skyline that rises behind it.\n\nOver more than half-a-century, Elm Street has been resurfaced several times; street lane stripes have been relocated; sidewalk lamp posts have been moved and added; trees, bushes and hedges have grown; and some traffic sign locations have been changed, relocated or removed. In late 2003, the city of Dallas approved construction project plans to restore Dealey Plaza to its exact appearance on November 22, 1963. The first phase of the restoration, which spent $700,000 for repair work and plumbing along Houston Streets, was completed in 2008.\n\nThe grassy knoll is a small, sloping hill inside the plaza that became well known following the assassination of John F. Kennedy. The knoll was above Kennedy and to his right (west and north) during the assassination on November 22, 1963.\n\nThis north grassy knoll is adjacent by the former Texas School Book Depository building along the Elm Street abutment side street to the northeast, Elm Street, and a sidewalk to the south, a parking lot to the north and east and a railroad bridge atop the triple underpass convergence of Commerce, Main and Elm streets to the west.\nLocated near the north grassy knoll on November 22, 1963, there were several witnesses, three large traffic signposts, four sidewalk lamp posts, the John Neely Bryan north pergola concrete structure including its two enclosed shelters, a tool shed, one 3.3 foot (1 m) high concrete wall connected to each of the pergola shelters; ten tall, wide, low-hanging live oak trees; a five-foot (1.5 m) tall, wooden, cornered, stockade fenceline measured at approximately 169 feet (53.6 m) long; six street curb sewer openings, their sewer manholes and their interconnecting large pipes; and several 2 to 6 foot (0.6 to 1.8 m) tall bushes, trees and hedges.\n\nThe term \"grassy knoll\" were first used to describe this area by reporter Albert Merriman Smith of UPI, who was riding in the press \"pool car\" following the motorcade and had use of the car's radio-telephone. In his second dispatch from the car just 25 minutes after the shooting, he said, \"Some of the Secret Service agents thought the gunfire was from an automatic weapon fired to the right rear of the president's car, probably from a grassy knoll to which police rushed.\" These words were then repeated on national television by CBS News anchor Walter Cronkite in his second CBS bulletin on the shooting.\n\nOut of the 104 Dealey Plaza earwitness reports published by the Commission and elsewhere, 56 recorded testimony that they remembered hearing at least one shot fired from either the Depository or near the Houston/Elm Street intersection. 35 witnesses recorded testimony of at least one shot fired from either the grassy knoll or the triple underpass. Eight stated that they heard shots being fired from elsewhere, and five testified that the shots were fired from two different directions.\n\nBecause of the persistent debate, answered and unanswered questions, and conspiracy theories surrounding the Kennedy assassination as well as the possible related role of the grassy knoll, the term \"grassy knoll\" has come to also be a modern slang expression indicating suspicion, conspiracy, or a cover-up.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "10322886", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10322886", "title": "Erislandy Lara", "text": "Erislandy Lara\n\nErislandy Lara Santoya (born April 11, 1983) is a Cuban-American professional boxer. He held the WBA light middleweight title from 2014 to 2018 (promoted to Super champion in 2016), and the IBO light middleweight title from 2015 to 2018. As of April 2018, he is ranked as the world's third best active light middleweight by \"The Ring\" magazine, BoxRec, and Transnational Boxing Rankings Board.\n\nLara is widely regarded as one of the most technically skilled fighters in boxing today. He was captain of the Cuban national amateur team, winning a gold medal in the welterweight division at the 2005 World Championships as well as three consecutive Cuban national championships from 2005 to 2007.\n\nIn 2003 and 2004, Lara lost four times against two-time world champion Lorenzo Aragon.\n\nIn 2005 after Aragon stepped down, Lara bested his countryman Yudel Jhonson Cedeno repeatedly and was sent to the world championships. There he avenged an earlier loss to Russian Andrey Balanov, beat American Boyd Melson, upset top favorite and Olympic champion Bakhtiyar Artayev (31–22), and won Gold against Magomed Nurutdinov (BLR).\n\nLara has lost twice to another Kazakh, Bakhyt Sarsekbayev. In their only meeting, Lara beat American world champion Demetrius Andrade 9–4.\n\n\nErislandy Lara was considered a favorite to win the gold medal at the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games. However, in 2007, Lara and Guillermo Rigondeaux defected from Cuba during the Pan American Games in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Some weeks later, he was caught by Brazilian authorities and returned to Cuba where he was banned from practicing boxing indefinitely.\n\nIn 2008, Lara attempted a second defection, this time on a speed boat to Mexico. Lara was successful and made his way to Hamburg, Germany, where he joined former Olympic champions Odlanier Solis, Yan Barthelemy, and Yuriorkis Gamboa in the Arena Box-Promotion stable.\n\nOn January 1, 2009, Erislandy Lara made his ESPN debut and scored a first-round TKO against Rodrigo Aguiar. Lara's following fight came on February 20, 2009, against Keith Gross. Lara dropped Gross with a left hand, but Gross beat the count on wobbly legs. Lara continued unleashing combinations to the head and body. A left uppercut finished the fight within round one. On May 2, 2009, on the Pacquiao vs. Hatton undercard, Lara faced Chris Gray. Lara won the fight via unanimous decision. On May 22, 2009, Lara faced aging Edwin Vazquez. Lara finished the fight with good combinations, prompting the referee to stop the fight in round four. On that same night, fellow Cuban boxer Guillermo Rigondeaux made his pro debut, which he also won via referee stoppage in the third round. After beating Edwin Vazquez, Lara went on to win nine straight fights punctuated by four consecutive first-round knockout victories.\n\nOn March 25, 2011, at The Cosmopolitan in Las Vegas, Lara fought Carlos Molina to a ten-round majority draw. Lara started by frequently targeting Molina's body with the left uppercut when Molina would attempt to close the distance. Early on Molina seemed to predict and nullify much of Lara's attempted one-two combinations. Although Lara had trouble connecting his signature straight left hand initially, he found the distance by the middle rounds, began to mix in short hooks to the head, and blocked most of Molina's constant body work. Molina, on the other hand, was rarely able to find Lara's head throughout the entire fight. Relying on looping punches, Molina stayed close and took advantage of the clinches to land to the body. Visibly fatigued, Molina developed a cut under his left eye near the beginning of the ninth round as Lara landed a hard, clean straight left hand and pushed the pace. Molina's higher output and pressure were favored by one judge while Lara's cleaner, sharper output and defense went largely unnoticed by ringside commentators. The final scorecards read: 95–95, 95–95, and 97–93 in favor of Molina.\n\nLara fought former WBO welterweight champion Paul Williams on July 9, 2011, in Atlantic City where he lost a majority decision. Judges Don Givens (116–114) and Hilton Whitaker II (115–114) both favored Williams, while Al Bennett scored it even at 114–114. Most boxing analysts and fans believed that Lara clearly won the fight and had been unfairly judged. Lara was able to land hard, clean left hands throughout the fight while maintaining superb defense. Williams appeared hurt in the later rounds but did, however, keep up a high output of punches despite their relative ineffectiveness. CompuBox recorded Lara landing 49 percent of his power punches compared to 21 percent by Williams. Lara also landed seven more jabs and 17 more power punches than Williams, despite the near two-fold activity by Williams. Consequently, the New Jersey State Athletic Control Board suspended all three judges, and Lara received his first loss as a professional fighter in a highly controversial fashion.\n\nOn April 20, 2012, Lara made his comeback to the ring after nine months to fight Ronald Hearns for the WBC light middleweight semi-final eliminator spot at the Beau Rivage casino resort in Biloxi, Mississippi. The fight, which was scheduled to go ten rounds, simply lasted one minute and 34 seconds as Lara delivered an impressive TKO in the first round. Referee Keith Hughes decided to stop the fight after Lara had sent Hearns to the canvas once with a clean left hook that required count and immediately after delivered two fast combinations (one of which also required count) that seemed to be enough to overwhelm Hearns who seconds before the stop by the referee appeared to be defenseless upon Lara's final combination.\n\nOn November 10, 2012, at the Wynn Resort in Las Vegas, Lara faced Vanes Martirosyan, who was undeafeted at the time and known for his amateur wins over Andre Berto, Austin Trout, and Timothy Bradley. Lara connected on 42 percent of his power punches (40/95) while Martirosyan landed 16 percent of his (27/167) and only 6 jabs throughout the entire fight, according to CompuBox. Lara outlanded Martirosyan in overall punches, 74 to 33. After a clash of heads resulted in a gash over Martirosyan's left eye in the ninth round, the ringside doctor waved off the fight. The referee ordered the judges to score the final 26 seconds of the bout, which resulted in a technical draw (87–84 in favor of Lara, 86–85 in favor of Martirosyan, and 86–86). Dave Moretti was responsible for the tied scorecard and judged the ninth round as 10–10, disagreeing with the other two judges who scored the final 26 seconds as 10–9 for Lara.\n\nOn June 8, 2013, at the Home Depot Center in Carson, California, Lara received the first two knockdowns of his professional career en route to earning a TKO victory over Mexico's Alfredo Angulo along with the interim WBA light middleweight title. Angulo's left hook was vicious as he rushed in, guarded and low. Lara, in return, was able to utilize zigzag formations and vary the speed of his movement to bait Angulo's aggression. However, Lara struggled with the aggression of Angulo at times and was put on the canvas in rounds 4 and 9 courtesy of Angulo’s vaunted left hook. Lara landed 56 percent of his power punches while Angulo landed 31 percent of his, according to CompuBox. The fight was stopped in round ten when Angulo refused to continue after a straight left hand by Lara caused swelling around his right eye. Angulo's injury was later revealed to be a broken orbital bone.\n\nOn December 7, 2013, Lara fought Austin Trout at Barclays Center in Brooklyn, New York. Considered the favorite to win, Trout had recently beaten Miguel Cotto. Lara, however, put on a dominant performance as he immediately nullified Trout’s offense using deft footwork and clean punching. In outclassing Trout, Lara scored a knockdown in round eleven via straight left hand. Trout was hurt for the remainder of the round as Lara pressed the action. Lara cruised to the unanimous decision (117–111, 117–111, and 118–109) and retained his interim WBA light middleweight title.\n\nLara fought Saúl Álvarez on July 12, 2014, at the MGM Grand in a non-title match. Lara's WBA light middleweight title was not on the line as the fight took place at a 155-pound catchweight, and both fighters weighed in at precisely 155 pounds. Álvarez rehydrated to 171 pounds while Lara came into the ring at 166 pounds. In a very close and competitive fight that went to a split decision, Álvarez came out on top with the two judges scoring 115–113 in favor of each fighter and the final judge scoring 117–111 in favor of Álvarez. The final scorecard was controversial as many observers considered it far too wide. According to CompuBox, Lara landed 55 jabs to nine from Álvarez, who landed the jab at a five percent connect rate. Álvarez managed to land 88 power punches (73 to the body) while Lara landed 53 power punches all to the head. Lara's clean punching along with his defense and movement were weighed against Álvarez's effective aggressiveness. Lara came out in dominant fashion, utilizing a stick-and-move style and capturing the early rounds. Álvarez was later able to hammer away to the body when he had Lara on the ropes but never adjusted to Lara's one-two combinations. Lara's lead hand played a huge role in this combination's effectiveness, but his output dropped in the middle rounds. Álvarez was able to cut Lara with a lead left uppercut in the seventh round. Although the decision remains controversial, any talk of a rematch in the future was dismissed by Oscar De La Hoya who went on to say, \"No one wants a rematch.\" This fight resulted in Lara's second professional loss.\n\nOn December 12, 2014, at the Alamodome in San Antonio, Texas, Lara showcased his ability to move in range to punch and then swiftly escape without taking damage against Ishe Smith. Lara consistently landed the straight left hand after “blinding” or “occupying” Smith’s guard with the lead hand. Lara would move in a forward direction towards Smith and escape in a linear direction, oftentimes sidestepping, while landing the one-two combination. This lateral movement was enhanced by Lara’s wide boxing stance, which also enhanced Lara’s punching power. Lara was frequently able to turn Smith into additional punches by stepping around Smith’s lead foot, thus enabling Lara to set traps. Lara dominated the fight and successfully defended his WBA (Regular) light middleweight title by unanimous decision with the scorecards reading: 119–109, 119–109, and 117–111.\n\nOn June 12, 2015, Lara defended his WBA (Regular) light middleweight title and won the vacant IBO light middleweight title against Delvin Rodríguez at the UIC Pavilion in Chicago. In a technical exhibition, Lara's exquisite timing and fast hands allowed him to out land Rodríguez 233 to 63 in total punches and connect on 62 percent of his power punches. Lara was able to score a knockdown in round six via straight left hand. In a virtual shutout, Lara earned a unanimous decision with all three judges agreeing 120–107.\n\nOn November 25, 2015, Lara defended his WBA and IBO light middleweight titles against Jan Zaveck in Hialeah, Florida. On a wetted canvas due to prior heavy rain, Lara began by walking down Zaveck who was relying on wide punches. Lara continued to stay in the pocket and countered Zaveck, halting his aggression. At the end of round two, Zaveck was hurt after Lara split his jab with a clean left hand. Lara landed a straight left hand at the start of round three followed by a series of combinations punctuating with an uppercut at which point Zaveck put his hand out, turned away, and refused to continue. Zaveck appeared to be in quite a lot of pain after the fight, which was stopped 41 seconds into round three.\n\nIt was announced that Lara would be defending his titles in a rematch from 2012 with Vanes Martirosyan, which ended in a draw. The fight was to take place as part of a triple header also including the Charlo twins and Austin Trout. The fight took place on May 21, 2016 in Las Vegas. On fight night, Lara unofficially weighed 160.5 pounds while Martirosyan came in at 170 pounds. Martirosyan spent much of the fight attempting to impose his strength and body work on Lara. As a result, Martirosyan inadvertently landed multiple low blows until he was deducted a point in the eleventh round. The bout was also plagued by head clashes much like during their previous encounter. In the early rounds both men stayed in perfect range, each relying on their own reflexes and quick transitions from defense to offense. Lara found openings for his sharp punches. As the fight progressed, he was more mobile and dictated the pace, outmaneuvering Martirosyan while managing to land flashy 1-2-1 combinations. After seizing ring generalship, Paulie Malignaggi noted Lara's \"fluid footwork\" and a resemblance to Pernell Whitaker as he often ducked low and displayed tricky pivot moves to evade Martirosyan's punches by inches. Lara landed 63 jabs and 60% of his power punches to Martirosyan's 16 jabs and 23% power punch connect rate. The fight averaged 491,000 viewers and peaked at 545,000 viewers.\n\nEarly reports on November 30, 2016, stated that there were talks of Lara to defend his WBA and IBO titles against former WBA light middleweight champion Yuri Foreman (34-2, 10 KOs). Lara's team was also in talks with Luis Collazo. It was confirmed that the fight against Foreman would headline the Premier Boxing Champions on January 13, 2017. The fight was held at the Hialeah Park Racing and Casino in Miami, Florida, in front of a largely Cuban crowd. Foreman was knocked down in round three. Upon closer inspection, the fall could easily have been ruled a slip. Lara won the fight after delivering a knockout in the fourth round via left uppercut. Although Foreman beat the count, he was on unsteady legs after multiple attempts to get back up. The referee promptly waved off the bout. In the post-fight interview, Lara expressed his desire to finally face off with unified middleweight titlist Gennady Golovkin and rematch lineal middleweight titlist Canelo Álvarez. The fight averaged 547,000 viewers on Spike TV and peaked at 707,000.\n\nIt was confirmed on August 24, 2017, by Ringtv that Lara would fight former Olympian Terrell Gausha (20-0, 9 KOs) as part of a super welterweight triple header on October 14, 2017, at the Barclays Center in New York City. Other fights on the card would include Jermell Charlo's mandatory title defence against top prospect Erickson Lubin and Jarrett Hurd defending his IBF title against former champion Austin Trout. In front of 7,643, Lara knocked down Gausha en-route to a 12-round unanimous decision to retain his world titles. Lara used his accurate jab and left hand putting on a clinic winning with the scorecards 116-111 and 117-110 twice in his favour. Lara connected with a left hook followed by a left straight, which floored Gausha in the fourth round. Lara landed 121 of 528 punches (23%), while Gausha connected with 77 of 329 (23%), which appeared to do little damage. Lara praised his opponent in the post-fight interview, \"We want to give a lot of credit to Gausha. He's an Olympian. I take the rhythm of the boxing match, and that's when I take over. He's fighting with the best in the division. He's not a stupid fighter, but he knew who he was facing today.\" Lara earned $700,000 for the fight and Gausha had a $250,000 purse. This fight, which was the main event of a triple header, averaged 399,000 viewers and peaked at 476,000 viewers on Showtime.\n\nDemetrius Andrade vacated his WBA 'Regular' title on October 22, 2017 after making his debut at middleweight. The WBA, in their efforts to reduce the amount of titles in each weight division, promoted Interim titleholder Brian Castaño (14-0, 10 KOs) to 'Regular' champion. On October 29, the WBA ordered the fight between Lara and Castaño. On January 9, 2018 it was confirmed that a deal was being put in place for a unification fight between Lara and IBF light middleweight champion Jarrett Hurd (21-0, 15 KO) for April 2018 with Showtime televising the bout. On January 25, the fight was confirmed to take place on April 7. It was reported Lara would receive a purse of $1 million and Hurd would receive a $500,000 purse. Lara weighed 153.5 pounds and Hurd came in slightly lighter at 153 pounds.\n\nHurd won a 12 round split decision over Lara in what was a potential fight of a year candidate to become a unified light middleweight champion. With the fight in the balance, Hurd knocked Lara down with a short left hook in round 12 with a minute remaining. Lara was hurt from the knockdown, but was able to get up and still throw some nice shots. Hurd dominated the final round. Two judges scored the fight 114-113 for Hurd and the third judge had the same score for Lara, meaning the knockdown was the deciding factor in the fight. A lot of rounds where close with Lara using effective counter punching and combinations, whereas Hurd used his size to stalk Lara and land power shots. Lara's right eye began to swell from round 7 and was eventually cut at the start of round 12. Lara started the fight the better boxer of the two, due to Hurd not putting as much pressure on Lara until the later rounds. With the win, Hurd became seventh unified world title holder in light middleweight history, joining Hall of Famers Terry Norris, Félix Trinidad, Oscar De La Hoya and Winky Wright, as well as Floyd Mayweather Jr. and Canelo Álvarez.\n\nDespite the knockdown, Lara thought he had a good enough lead to win the fight. Had Lara not been knocked down, the fight would have finished a majority draw with both boxers keeping their respective belts. In regards to the decision, Lara said, \"Besides the last round, I thought I was winning this fight easily. That's not to decide the fight. One punch in a fight doesn't determine the fight. One hundred percent I want the rematch. The problem was the cut on the eye. I couldn't see in the last round.\" After the fight, Hurd said, \"It was a tough one, but I went out there and did exactly what I said I was going to do -- fight all 12 rounds and get the victory. I didn't feel like that [12th-round knockdown for the win]. I feel like I was in control the whole fight, applying the pressure.\" According to CompuBox statistics, Hurd landed 217 of 824 punches thrown (26%) and Lara landed 176 of his 572 thrown (31%). Hurd outlanded Lara 106-71 in the final four rounds, with 96 being power shots compared to Lara's 58 power punches. The fight, televised on Showtime, averaged 490,000 viewers and peaked at 521,000 viewers.\n\nAlthough the WBA ordered a direct rematch between Lara and Hurd, the latter rejected the idea stating he wanted to move on to bigger fights to become undisputed light middleweight champion.\n\nIn October 2018, at the WBC annual convention in Kiev, it was announced that Jermell Charlo would be allowed to make another voluntary defence and Lara was ordered to fight Julian Williams (25-1-1, 15 KOs, 1 NC) in a final eliminator. At the time, Williams was already IBF's #1 ranked. On October 30, according to Brian Castaño's manager Sebastian Contursis, a deal was being worked out to have Castaño fight Lara. A date in January 2019 was being discussed. In order for Castaño to defend his WBA 'Regular' belt against Lara, the WBA granted him a special permit.\n\n"}

Eutychus fell asleep due to the long nature of the discourse Paul was giving and fell from a windowsill out of the three-story building. Paul then embraced him, insisting that he was not dead, and they carried him back upstairs alive; those gathered then had a meal and a long talk which lasted until dawn. This is related in the New Testament book of the Acts of the Apostles 20:7-12.\n\nThough some (e.g. William Barclay, F. F. Bruce), do not believe that Eutychus died, Wayne Jackson observes the following facts: 1) the author Luke, a physician (Col. 4:14), plainly states that Eutychus was \"taken up dead\" (, \"erthe nekros\"); 2) after Paul embraces Eutychus, he says, \"Trouble not yourselves, for his life is in him\" (, \"he gar psuche autou en auto estin\"), not \"still in him\" as the Weymouth translation erroneously interprets; 3) Eutychus was then \"brought alive\" by which the others were \"not a little comforted,\" which words would make no sense if Eutychus had not died; and 4) Luke was fully capable of describing someone as only being \"supposedly dead\" (), as he did of Paul in , but he did not do so here. However, Eutychus' complete recovery from a three-story fall, regardless of the initial result, and Paul's attendance at the scene of the accident, appears to be the impact of the narrative. \n\nThe name \"Eutychus\" means \"fortunate\".\n\n\n"}

Grouches are a distinct species from the Sesame Street Monsters (including the Anything Monsters).\n\nBeing as grouchy and miserable as they possibly can be is any Grouch's main mission in life. They also feel that they have to make everyone else feel the same way. Even though that makes them happy, however, a Grouch will never admit to being happy no matter what the circumstances.\n\nGrouches like anything dirty or dingy or dusty, anything ragged or rotten or rusty or trashy. They will only buy non-functioning or malfunctioning appliances, they normally keep elephants, worms, pigs, goats, and donkeys as pets, dine on appalling cuisine (ice cream sundaes with pickles and sardines are a popular Grouch dish, as are mashed bananas with beef gravy and ice cubes), sing out-of-tune, play radios at the highest volume, and bathe in mud as they all love not being clean, and they get their fur styled -- or rather, disarrayed -- at \"ugly parlors\" instead of beauty parlors. Grouches also like to use phrases such as \"scram\", \"get lost\", \"go away\", \"beat it\", and \"buzz off.\" A Grouch will never miss an opportunity to make a snarky remark.\n\nAs seen in the 1985 film \"Follow That Bird\", a handful of human beings have embraced the Grouch way of life, proving themselves to be as hostile, surly, and filthy as any furry Grouch. Two such human Grouches were seen working at the Don't Drop Inn, a small googie-style Grouch diner with exaggerated greasy spoon service (inspired by Mel's Drive-In) whose patrons included both furry Grouches and disagreeable humans who might or might not themselves have been human Grouches. \n\nEven though Oscar the Grouch and his girlfriend Grundgetta are the most well-known Grouches, over the years a very large number of Grouches have been introduced.\n\nMost of the Grouches live in Grouchland USA (inspired by Brooklyn, New York) as seen in the film \"The Adventures of Elmo in Grouchland\". Though the Grouches there had to put up with having their stuff taken by a man named Huxley, Oscar the Grouch later convinced the inhabitants that even though Grouches hate working together, they had to cooperate just this once in order to take a stand against Huxley.\n\n"}

His career spanned almost thirty years, including service in both world wars. At the helm of HMAS \"Stuart\" in the Mediterranean from 1939 to 1941, he won recognition as a skilful ship's captain and flotilla commander. He then transferred to the South West Pacific as captain of the light cruiser HMAS \"Perth\", and went down with his ship against heavy odds during the Battle of Sunda Strait in early 1942.\n\nBorn in Benalla, Victoria, Waller entered the Royal Australian Naval College at the age of thirteen. After graduating, he served with the Royal Navy in the closing stages of World War I. Between the wars, he specialised in communications and was posted as signals officer to several British and Australian warships. He gained his first seagoing command in 1937, as captain of the destroyer HMS \"Brazen\". In September 1939, he took charge of HMAS \"Stuart\" and four other obsolete destroyers that together became known as the \"Scrap Iron Flotilla\". In 1940, these were augmented by other ships to form the 10th Destroyer Flotilla, supporting Allied troops in North Africa.\n\nWaller was awarded the Distinguished Service Order and Bar, and twice mentioned in despatches, for his achievements in the Mediterranean. He assumed command of HMAS \"Perth\" in October 1941, taking part in the Battle of the Java Sea shortly before his final action in Sunda Strait. He received a third mention in despatches posthumously, and in 2011 came under formal consideration for the award of the Victoria Cross for his performance as \"Perth\"'s captain. The submarine HMAS \"Waller\" is named in his honour.\n\nBorn on 4 April 1900 in Benalla, Victoria, Hector MacDonald Laws Waller was the son of William Frederick Waller, a grocer, and his wife Helen Waller (née Duncan). Hec Waller was named in honour of General Hector MacDonald, hero of the Boer War, and a forebear called Laws who was an admiral and a contemporary of Nelson. The youngest of ten children, of whom eight survived infancy, he attended Benalla Higher Elementary School.\n\nWaller entered the Royal Australian Naval College (RANC) as a cadet midshipman on 31 December 1913, aged thirteen. He gained recognition as a rugby player and became cadet captain. In 1917, his final year at the college, he was raised to chief cadet captain and won the King's Medal, awarded for \"gentlemanly bearing, character, good influence among his fellows and officer-like qualities\". Promoted to midshipman on 1 January 1918, he was posted to Britain where, in April, he was appointed to serve in the Royal Navy's (RN) Grand Fleet with the dreadnought HMS \"Agincourt\". The ship did not see combat while he was on board.\n\nIn February 1919, Waller was assigned to the light cruiser HMAS \"Melbourne\", and two months later returned to Australia. He transferred to the light cruiser HMAS \"Sydney as an acting sub-lieutenant in September; his rank was made substantive the following month. In April 1920 he was again posted aboard \"Melbourne\". Promoted to lieutenant in March 1921, he underwent further training in Britain before returning to join the staff of the RANC. Waller married Nancy Bowes, a minister's daughter, on 7 April 1923 in the Sydney suburb of Lewisham; the couple had two sons, Michael and John. In April 1924, he was posted to the light cruiser HMAS \"Adelaide\". Later that year, he began training as a signals officer in England; his classmates included Lord Louis Mountbatten. Waller finished at the top of the advanced course and, in May 1926, took charge of the Signals and Wireless-Telegraphy School at Flinders Naval Depot in Westernport, Victoria. From 1928 to 1930, he served with the RN as a signals officer aboard the destroyer HMS \"Broke\". He was promoted to lieutenant commander in March 1929.\n\nBy this stage of his career, Waller had acquired a strong reputation for his communications work. In July 1930, he was posted aboard the Royal Australian Navy's (RAN) flagship, the heavy cruiser HMAS \"Australia\", as squadron signals officer. He continued to perform this role upon transferring to \"Australia\"s sister ship, HMAS \"Canberra\", in May 1931. In early 1932, he was assigned to the Navy Office in Melbourne, returning to \"Canberra\" as squadron signals officer in August 1933. He was promoted to commander in June 1934 and the following month became executive officer of the RANC. Departing the college in July 1936, he returned to England and spent six months working in the British Naval Intelligence Division. A stint as executive officer of the repair ship HMS \"Resource\" followed. In November 1937, Waller was given his first command at sea, the RN destroyer HMS \"Brazen\". His ship handling was criticised early on, but was soon reported by his superiors as having \"improved greatly\". Stationed in the Mediterranean, \"Brazen\" monitored progress of the Spanish Civil War, a duty that included protecting British merchant vessels and rescuing the crews of sinking ships. By June 1939, Waller had returned to Australia to become Director of Signals and Communications at the Navy Office.\n\nAt the outbreak of World War II, Waller was appointed captain of HMAS \"Stuart\", taking charge of a group of four other obsolete ex-RN destroyers—HMA Ships \"Vampire\", \"Vendetta\", \"Voyager\", and \"Waterhen\"—that the Germans later nicknamed the \"Scrap Iron Flotilla\". The ships were en route to Singapore for training when the British and Australian governments agreed that they should be assigned to the Mediterranean as the 19th Destroyer Division, under Waller's control. Arriving at Malta in late December, Waller made a positive initial impression on senior RN commanders; this was soon borne out by his actions during the salvage of the \"Trocas\", a disabled tanker. In May 1940, he was appointed to command the 10th Destroyer Flotilla, which included the vessels of the \"Scrap Iron Flotilla\" plus four modern British destroyers, and a month later was promoted to captain.\n\nFollowing Italy's entry into the war on 10 June 1940, Waller was involved in the search for minefields off the North African coast. A keen shooter, he personally blew up floating mines using a rifle and armour-piercing bullets. On 21 June, \"Stuart\" shelled the Italian-held town of Bardia. The next month, his 10th Destroyer Flotilla participated in the Battle of Calabria. Waller's ships carried out bombardments on Fort Capuzzo on 17 August and an Italian seaplane base in the Gulf of Bomba one week later. In September, he was awarded the Distinguished Service Order (DSO) for \"courage, enterprise, and devotion to duty on recent engagements\"—in particular, his pinpointing of enemy minefields. The same month, he transferred to HMAS \"Vampire\" while \"Stuart\" went in for refit. As the Allied armies began to counterattack Italian forces in December 1940, the Commander-in-Chief of the Mediterranean Fleet, Admiral Sir Andrew Cunningham, gave Waller command of the newly formed Inshore Squadron, comprising destroyers, minesweepers, and auxiliaries. In his role as Cunningham's Senior Officer Afloat, Waller took charge of naval support for the attack on Bardia, which fell to the Allies on 5 January 1941. Shortly afterwards, he handed over command of the Inshore Squadron and transferred back aboard \"Stuart\".\n\n\"Stuart\" and other ships of Waller's 10th Destroyer Flotilla supported the assaults on Tobruk in January 1941 and Benghazi the following month. In March, \"Stuart\" escorted Allied troop transports to Greece as part of Operation Lustre, narrowly avoiding falling victim to Axis dive-bomber attacks. During the Battle of Cape Matapan at the end of the month, Waller's ships were credited with sinking two Italian destroyers. From May to July, the 10th Destroyer Flotilla made 139 ferry runs during the Siege of Tobruk, carrying supplies to the town's garrison and evacuating the wounded. Waller was mentioned in despatches twice during 1941: in July for his army cooperation role with the Inshore Squadron off the Libyan coast, and in November for his service during the Greek campaign. In January 1942, he was awarded a Bar to his DSO for \"bravery and enterprise in the Battle of Cape Matapan\".\n\nWaller earned the personal admiration of Admiral Cunningham, who described him as \"one of the finest types of Australian naval officers ... greatly loved and admired by everyone\". On the occasion of a visit to Alexandria by Australian Prime Minister Robert Menzies, Cunningham escorted him to \"Stuart\" and declared: \"And now you are going to meet one of the greatest captains who ever sailed the seas—his name is Waller\". According to author Ray Parkin, who began writing while a prisoner of war, \"Andrew Cunningham and Hector Waller were cast in the same mould: men would follow them, suffer, and be glad about it. These were both men made by Fate for those ever-recurring Saint Crispin's Days of human affairs\".\n\nDeparting the Mediterranean, Waller returned to Australia in August 1941 for service in the South West Pacific. On 24 October, he took command of the light cruiser HMAS \"Perth\", berthed in Sydney. \"Perth\" had also lately returned from action in the Mediterranean, where she had participated in the Greek, Cretan, and Syrian campaigns, and been damaged on two occasions by German bombers. Waller was reportedly \"tired\" and \"quite a sick man\" at this time, but nonetheless prepared \"Perth\" for action quickly. In January 1942, the ship was assigned to American-British-Dutch-Australian Command (ABDA) to help defend the Dutch East Indies. She set sail for the ABDA Area on 15 February, the day that Singapore surrendered.\n\nThe ABDA Striking Force that \"Perth\" had joined was crushed by an overwhelming Japanese force at the Battle of the Java Sea on 27 February. Low on ammunition, Waller made the decision to withdraw, accompanied by the cruiser USS \"Houston\" under the command of Captain Albert H. Rooks. Waller's action contravened the orders of his Dutch superior, Admiral Conrad Helfrich, to \"continue action whatever the cost, and till the bitter end\", but the Australian was convinced that further engagement would mean pointless sacrifice.\n\nOn the following night, 28 February, \"Perth\" and \"Houston\" were attempting to break through the Sunda Strait to Australia when they encountered a Japanese invasion fleet escorted by four cruisers and twelve destroyers. As senior officer, Waller was in the lead with \"Perth\", and gave the order to fire upon making contact with the enemy ships just after 11:00 pm. In the ensuing battle, the Allied cruisers sank four Japanese transports and a minesweeper before they themselves were sunk, shortly after midnight on 1 March 1942. Having fought to the last of its ammunition, \"Perth\" was struck by two torpedoes, losing over 350 of its complement of 680 as it keeled over. According to witnesses, Waller was last seen standing on the bridge after he had given the order to abandon ship, \"looking down at the silent turrets\". He was officially listed as missing, presumed killed, and was survived by his wife and sons. Admiral Cunningham described Waller's loss as \"a heavy deprivation for the young Navy of Australia\", and Rear Admiral James Goldrick subsequently called him \"the outstanding officer of his generation\".\n\nOn 15 March 1946, Waller was awarded a posthumous mention in despatches for \"gallantry and resolution\" aboard HMAS \"Perth\". His younger son John followed him into the Navy, entering the RANC in 1947. Graduating as chief cadet captain, John Waller became a weapons electrical engineer and attained the rank of commander in 1967, before transferring to the Emergency Reserve as a senior Navy research scientist.\n\nHec Waller's name appears on the Roll of Honour located at Panel 6 in the Commemorative Area at the Australian War Memorial, Canberra, and on the Plymouth Naval Memorial in Devon, England. He is also commemorated by Waller Crescent and Waller Place in the Canberra suburb of Campbell. The Benalla Costume and Pioneer Museum holds his medals and dress uniform. The Waller Division of the RAN Recruit School at HMAS \"Cerberus\", Victoria, was named in his honour until his name transferred to a division at RAN College in 2013.\n\nHMAS \"Waller\", the third of the RAN's \"Collins\"-class submarines to enter service, was commissioned on 10 July 1999. The attendees included John Waller, Michael Waller's wife, and surviving crewmen of HMAS \"Perth\". On 13 March 2010, a memorial to Waller was unveiled in his home town of Benalla. In April 2011, he was one of thirteen servicemen—eleven sailors and two soldiers, including Teddy Sheean, Robert Rankin, and John Simpson Kirkpatrick—named by the Australian government for consideration as possible recipients of the Victoria Cross for extreme valour in combat, under a review by the Defence Honours and Awards Appeals Tribunal; no RAN member had ever been awarded the decoration. Concluding its investigations in February 2013, the tribunal recommended that no further award be made to any of the thirteen servicemen, but that the name \"Waller\" (among others) should continue to be used for RAN ships after the current bearer was decommissioned.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "18101603", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18101603", "title": "High throughput biology", "text": "High throughput biology\n\nHigh throughput cell biology is the use of automation equipment with classical cell biology techniques to address biological questions that are otherwise unattainable using conventional methods. It may incorporate techniques from optics, chemistry, biology or image analysis to permit rapid, highly parallel research into how cells function, interact with each other and how pathogens exploit them in disease.\n\nHigh-throughput biology serves as one facet of what has also been called \"omics research\" - the interface between large scale biology (genome, proteome, transcriptome), technology and researchers. High throughput cell biology has a definite focus on the cell, and methods accessing the cell such as imaging, gene expression microarrays, or genome wide screening. The basic idea is to take methods normally performed on their own and do a very large number of them without impacting their quality.\n\nHigh throughput research can be defined as the automation of experiments such that large scale repetition becomes feasible. This is important because many of the questions faced by life science researchers now involve large numbers. For example, the Human Genome contains at least 21,000 genes, all of which can potentially contribute to cell function, or disease. To be able to capture an idea of how these genes interact with one another, which genes are involved in and where they are, methods that encompass from the cell to the genome are of interest.\n\nClassical High throughput screening robotics are now being tied closer to cell biology, principally using technologies such as High-content screening. High throughput cell biology dictates methods that can take routine cell biology from low scale research to the speed and scale necessary to investigate complex systems, achieve high sample size, or efficiently screen through a collection.\n\nIt has a greater emphasis on function rather than discovery, and will have its most significant impact in exploring biology as we progress toward models of the cell as a system rather than isolated pathways.\n\nHigh-content screening technology is mainly based on automated digital microscopy and flow cytometry, in combination with IT-systems for the analysis and storage of the data.\n\"High-content\" or visual biology technology has two purposes, first to acquire spatially or temporally resolved information on an event and second to automatically quantify it. Spatially resolved instruments are typically automated microscopes, and temporal resolution still requires some form of fluorescence measurement in most cases.This means that a lot of HCS instruments are (fluorescence) microscopes that are connected to some form of image analysis package. These take care of all the steps in taking fluorescent images of cells and provide rapid, automated and unbiased assessment of experiments.\n\nThe technology can be defined as being at the same development point as the first automated DNA sequencers in the early 1990s. Automated DNA sequencing was a disruptive technology when it became practical and -even if early devices had shortcomings- it enabled genome scale sequencing projects and created the field of bioinformatics. The impact of a similarly disruptive and powerful technology on molecular cell biology and translational research is hard to predict but what is clear is that it will cause a profound change in the way cell biologists research and medicines are discovered.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "17682942", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17682942", "title": "Human Flame", "text": "Human Flame\n\nThe Human Flame is a comic book character, a supervillain in DC Comics' main shared universe. He is mostly known as enemy of Martian Manhunter\n\nHe first appeared in \"Detective Comics\" #274 (December 1959), and was created by Jack Miller and Joe Certa.\n\nThe character was not used again for 48 years, before reappearing to play an important role in \"Final Crisis\". The writer, Grant Morrison, explained why he picked such an obscure character:\n\nHuman Flame is the featured character in the six-issue limited series \"Final Crisis Aftermath: Run!\", written by Lilah Sturges, with art by Freddie Williams.\n\nMichael Miller, the Human Flame, was a minor villain who, early in his career, was captured by the Martian Manhunter and incarcerated, He was the first actual supervillain the Manhunter faced. After this one off appearance, he was not seen in publication for nearly fifty years. In 2008's \"Justice League of America\" (vol. 2) #21, he was seen robbing a bank, leading to a reluctant confrontation with Red Arrow and Hawkgirl. It was stated in this issue that in the context of the DC Universe, eight years had passed since his arrest in \"Detective\" #274.\n\nHe enlisted with Libra and the Secret Society of Super Villains. As a reward for joining him, Libra promised him power and his heart's desire: \"revenge against the Martian Manhunter.\"\n\nFollowing the events of \"Salvation Run,\" the Martian Manhunter was released from his imprisonment on Cygnus 4019 by Libra at the behest of the Human Flame. Preaching about granting the Society's wildest dreams, Libra stabs the Manhunter with his flaming staff while the Human Flame looks on, his wish having been the first granted by Libra. He films the murder to post on the internet later. While dying, Martian Manhunter telepathically attacked the super villains present with visions of their deaths by their arch-rivals with Vandal Savage imagining being killed by Manhunter himself. However, the Human Flame is ignored and cowers from the side.\n\nThe Human Flame is given a new upgraded suit by Libra. The helmet Libra shoves onto Human Flame's head emits the Anti-Life Equation turning Human Flame into a mindless drone known as a Justifier. Libra even used the Human Flame amongst other Justifiers to persuade Lex Luthor to swear an allegiance to Darkseid or be turned into a Justifier. The Human Flame was among the Justifiers under Lex Luthor's control that were fighting the Female Furies.\n\nIn the limited series \"Final Crisis Aftermath: Run!\", it is revealed that the Human Flame had a wife and child, but was divorced. The Human Flame tries to hide while pursued by the Kyrgyzstani Mafia for stealing a cache of money, the villains that Libra enslaved during the Final Crisis, and the Justice League members John Stewart and Firestorm. However, his costume is badly damaged during a fight with the mob, and the Human Flame seeks out Heat Wave, hoping to purchase one of the latter's signature flamethrower guns. Heat Wave refuses, denouncing him as \"pathetic\", and gives him a harsh beating. Wounded and unable to afford health care, the Human Flame turns to General Immortus who turns him over to Professor Milo. Milo fixes his injuries, and adds cybernetic parts, adding strength and invulnerability, and implanted flamethrowers in his chest, mouth and arms. However, to ensure the Human Flame's loyalty, Immortus has his flamethrowers rigged to cause intense pain whenever he uses them, and orders him to kill Immortus' foe, N-Emy (whom General Immortus blamed for stealing something from him).\n\nThe Human Flame later attempts some freelance jobs, stealing from a bank with the help of Seductress (one of the augmented henchmen and lover of Immortus himself) and swaying her to his side. However, he's quickly discovered and charged with treason by Milo and Immortus, who try to shut down his powers with a remote control. With Seductress rushing again to his aid, the Human Flame is able to escape destroying the remote but injuring himself in the process.\n\nHowever, Human Flame discovers that his new cyborg body has uncanny recuperative abilities that fix the broken jaw suffered during his escape. He fights his former allies successfully, killing them all until Immortus shuts down his powers with a secondary, wireless remote. The Human Flame then regains his powers by sheer will (even the augmented powers), badly burning Immortus. He then tortures Professor Milo to get further augmentations to put him on par with the Justice League and everyone else wanting vengeance against him. Milo sends him to S.T.A.R. Labs to get himself infused with atomic energy in a new experimental process. There, Human Flame and Seductress are attacked by a \"Hyper-Griffin\", thus alerting S.T.A.R.'s security (actually one lone scientist) who agrees to give Human Flame the energy infusion to dispatch the Hyper-Griffin. However, the energy infusion is temporary unless Human Flame can reach a nearby nuclear power plant and bathe in its energies, even though he risks death and a deadly meltdown. Despite the risks, he leaves Seductress behind and dupes John Stewart into dunking him in the main reactor. As a result, the nuclear plant is engulfed in a fiery explosion.\n\nDespite the magnitude of the explosion, so powerful that the assembled heroes barely manage to contain it with their maximum efforts, Flame emerges as a fiery, radioactive being, in a molten approximation of a human body, able to increase his mass and density. Calling himself the \"Inhuman Flame\", he rampages through the city until he increases his mass to such a degree that he becomes basically immobile. Realizing that the Flame, in his quest for power, hadn't even taken into account the idea of becoming \"smaller,\" Firestorm, Red Tornado, and John Stewart take him to outer space, tethered to heat-dispersing rod to sap his thermic-based powers. As a final revenge, and to add insult to injury, Stewart creates a cell-phone construct and takes a photo of the captive Human Flame, stressing the similarities to Martian Manhunter's fate.\n\nWhen he first appears, Human Flame has no powers, but wears a costume with twelve flame throwing nozzles on the chest.\n\nAs a part of the \"Run\" series, he is shown being turned into a cyborg with an enhanced physique, partial body armor and a series of flame-spewing nozzles implanted in his chest, belly, face, mouth and hands. He further enhances his body by an experimental radioactive infusion process: as a result he gains a metahuman body composed of molten material, able to increase his mass and density at will and radiate high temperature radiations. In this new form he's shown to be unable, whether due to a physical limitation or simply because he is incapable of thinking that way, to reduce his increased mass, becoming in a short while a behemoth so heavy and dense that he loses the ability to move.\n\nThroughout his attempt to escape the heroes hunting him, he was represented as an incompetent crook who gets lucky because nobody expects anything of him, allowing him to evade capture as they cannot predict his methods, although his fixation on acquiring more power and anger at his own view of life's mistreatment of him eventually allow the heroes to catch up with him.\n\n"}

He helped thereafter loading the lifeboats. Despite repeated invitations of his colleagues, he refused to board a boat and died in the sinking.\n\nJames Paul Moody was born in Scarborough, England on 21 August 1887, the youngest of four children born to solicitor John Henry Moody and his wife Evelyn Louis Lammin. Moody's grandfather and namesake, John James Paul Moody, had been a prominent local figure. Moody attended the Rosebery House School before joining HMS \"Conway\" as a cadet in 1902. His two years in the ship, 1902-1903, counted as one years' sea time towards his Board of Trade Second Mate's Certification.\n\nIn 1904 he joined the William Thomas Line's \"Boadicea\" as an apprentice, and endured an horrific, storm-troubled voyage to New York, in which one of his fellow apprentices was driven to suicide.\n\nAfter attaining his Second Mate's Certification, Moody went into steam and sailed in cargo and early oil-tankers, eventually attaining his First Mate's Certificate. After very briefly attending the King Edward VII Nautical School in 1910, a nautical \"cram\" school preparing officers for their Board of Trade examinations, he successfully obtained his Ordinary Master's Certification, and in August 1911 joined the White Star Line's \"Oceanic\" as her Sixth Officer. In March 1912 he received word that he was to be assigned to as her Sixth Officer. Moody was somewhat reluctant to accept the assignment as he had hoped to spend a summer on the Atlantic aboard the \"Oceanic\", after having endured a harsh winter, and was also hoping to take leave. His request for leave was denied.\n\nAlong with the other junior officers, Moody received a message in March 1912 ordering him to report to White Star's Liverpool offices on 26 March. From there he travelled to board \"Titanic\" at the Harland & Wolff yard in Belfast. \"Titanic\" then sailed for Southampton to take on passengers. Moody's service as Sixth Officer earned him about $37 a month, although he was allowed his own cabin as compensation for his small salary.\n\nOn \"Titanic\"s sailing day, 10 April, Moody assisted, among other things, in aiding Fifth Officer Harold Lowe in lowering two of the starboard lifeboats to satisfy the Board of Trade that \"Titanic\" met safety standards. He was also in charge of closing the last gangway, and most likely saved the lives of six crewmen who arrived too late to board by turning them away. Once the ship had put to sea, Moody stood the 4–5 watch and both 8–12 watches, which meant that he was on watch with First Officer William Murdoch and Fourth Officer Joseph Boxhall when the \"Titanic\" struck an iceberg at 11:40 on 14 April. After spotting the iceberg, lookout Frederick Fleet rang the warning bell three times and phoned the bridge. It was Moody who answered the call, asking, \"What do you see?\" Fleet replied, \"Iceberg, right ahead!\".\n\nIn the ensuing evacuation, Moody helped in the loading of Lifeboats No. 9, 12, 13, 14, and 16. While loading No. 14, Fifth Officer Lowe remarked that an officer should man the lifeboat. While the lower-ranked Moody would traditionally have been given this task, he deferred to Lowe. It was a decision that would seal his fate. Moody went to the starboard side and gave Murdoch a hand until the water had come on the deck. Moody was last seen by the ship's lamp trimmer, Samuel Hemming, on top of the officers' quarters trying to launch Collapsible A, an emergency lifeboat, just a few minutes before the final sinking. Lightoller also said; \"Mr. Moody must have been standing quite close to me at the same time. He was on top of the quarters clearing away the collapsible boat on the starboard side, whilst Mr. Murdoch was working at the falls. If that is so, we were all practically in the water together.\"\n\nMoody was 24 at the time of his death. His body was never recovered. He was the only junior officer on the Titanic to die in the sinking.\n\nA monument in Woodland Cemetery, Scarborough, commemorates Moody's sacrifice on the \"Titanic\" with the Biblical quote, \"Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.\" (see )\n\nHe is also commemorated by a Blue Heritage Plaque at 17 Granville Road Scarborough, the house where he was born and a commemorative plaque in St Martin's Church in Scarborough.\n\nHe is also commemorated by a brass altar set presented by his aunt, Hannah Mountain, to the church of St Augustine of Hippo in Grimsby.\n\n\n"}

His brother was Thomas Arundel, Archbishop of Canterbury. His sister was Joan Fitzalan, Countess of Hereford.\n\nJohn was appointed Lord Marshal of England by Richard II of England in 1377, and summoned to the House of Lords on 4 August 1377, by writ directed \"Johanni de Arundell\". He served as Lord Marshal until 1379.\n\nOn 26 July 1379 he was given licence to crenellate (i.e., permission to fortify) a stone castle on the site of an 11th-century earthwork fortress in Surrey. Over the years since then the structure was rebuilt and remodelled and its remains are now known as Betchworth Castle.\n\nBeing in command of a naval expedition in aid to the Duke of Brittany, he defeated the French fleet off the coast of Cornwall.\n\nCommanding a force with the purpose of bringing relief to the Duke of Brittany, Sir John was compelled to wait for stronger winds. During this wait he decided to take refuge in a nunnery, where his men \"took no notice of the sanctity of the place and... violently assaulted and raped\" those they found inside. Further to this Sir John \"allowed his men to ransack the countryside as they liked and to impoverish the people\". When the force eventually set out to sea, carrying with them goods stolen from a nearby church and under a pronouncement of excommunication from the wronged priests, the expedition was caught in a storm. Thomas Walsingham reports that during the panic of the storm, Sir John murdered those of his men who refused to make for shore for fear of being shipwrecked upon the rocks. Subsequently, after safely arriving on an island off the Irish coast, Sir John and his boat captain were swept back into the sea and drowned.\n\nAccording to Thomas Walsingham's story, FitzAlan's men profaned a convent at or near Southampton, and abducted many of its occupants. The fleet was then pursued by a violent tempest, when the wretched nuns who had been carried off were thrown overboard to lighten the ships. The vessels were, however, wrecked on the Irish coast, near Scariff according to some authorities, but at Cape Clear Island according to others. Sir John Arundell, together with his esquires, and other men of high birth, were drowned, and twenty-five ships were lost with most of their crews. Froissart's account of the event differs essentially from Walsingham's, in the omission of the story of the desecration of the convent.\n\nHe was buried in Lewes, Sussex.\n\nHe was also an ancestor of the poet, Percy Bysshe Shelley.\n\nOn 17 February 1358, FitzAlan married Eleanor Maltravers (Mautravers) (1345 – 10 January 1404/1406), daughter of John Maltravers and Gwenthin. They had at least five children (some references list more):\n\n\n"}

His mother was Françoise de Chalus (bap. Château de Châlus-Chabrol, Châlus, Haute-Vienne, 24 February 1734 - Paris, 7 July 1821, daughter of Gabriel de Châlus, seigneur de Sansac, and Claire Gérault de Solages), one of the ladies-in-waiting of Elizabeth, Duchess of Parma and Chamberlain-Major of Princess Marie Adélaïde of France.<br> \nHer husband was a nobleman of Spanish descent Don Jean François, 1er duc de Narbonne-Lara Grandee of Spain 1st Class, Lieutenant General of the Army, Commander in Name of the King of the Dioceses of Castres, Albi and Lavaur, 1st Gentleman of the House of H.R.H. the Duke of Parma (Aubiac, Lot-et-Garonne, 27 December 1718 - 12 August 1806), son of François de Narbonne-Lara, seigneur d' Aubiac, and second wife Olympie Angélique de Goth. They married 10 July 1749, and had an older son Philippe, the 2e duc de Narbonne-Lara, without issue.<br> \nHowever, it is alleged that Louis XV himself was the real father. The coevals attribute the count's paternity to the King of France Louis XV for, according to documents of the Military Archive, the comte Jean François de Narbonne-Lara had been wounded 8 years earlier in the War of the Austrian Succession (1747) becoming from that moment on unable of having any offspring. The baptism of Louis, comte de Narbonne-Lara is another indication of that paternity. His wife became thus the King's mistress, and not only his name was also Louis but also his countemporaries always remarked about the similarities between Louis and the King.\n\nHe was brought up at Versailles with the Princesses of France. His education was princely, inclined mostly towards the Classical studies and a rigid military formation; he frequented the main Courts of Europe, where he was able to familiarize with the foreign languages (German and English), which also contributed to his diplomatic formation.\n\nHe was made Colonel of the Army at the age of twenty-five.\n\nHe married Marie Adélaïde (sometimes Adélaïde Marie) de Montholon (Mâcon, 11 or 16 October 1767 - 1848), Lady of \"Madame\" Victoire of France, daughter of Louis XV, on 16 April 1782 at Paris, France, with whom he had two daughters. She was the daughter of Nicolas de Montholon (son of Pierre de Montholon and Marguerite Baron, married on 11 June 1711) and Marguerite Fournier de la Chapelle (daughter of Charles Fournier de la Chapelle and Marie Louise Dureau). Their daughters were:\n\nOut of wedlock he had by Jeanne Pitrot-Verteil one son:\n\nAnd by Louise-Françoise Contat (16 June 1760 - 9 March 1813), actress with the Comédie-Française, one daughter:\n\nHe is found in 1785 as a Colonel of the Army and Honorary Chamberlain of Princess \"Madame\" Marie Adélaïde of France. In 1786 he was the Commander of an Infantry Regiment, and remained in that post until the evenings of the French Revolution.\n\nHis liberal ideas soon made him be one of the first inscribed in the Club de Valois, where the Duke of Orléans presided. He was afterwards appointed Commander of the National Guard in Franche-Comté. His friendship with Talleyrand brought him an appointment to command a special guard, composed of the most disciplined soldiers of the National Guard of Paris.\n\nThe comte de Narbonne-Lara always maintained his fidelity towards the King; a true idealist, he hoped for a Constitutional Monarchy.\n\nHe became maréchal de camp in 1791, and, through the influence of Madame de Staël, was appointed Minister of War of Louis XVI. In this office he tried at all cost to impose his constitutional project, helped by the Bishop of Autun, Baumetz and Chapelier. But he showed incapacity in this post, and gave in his resignation. Despite his efforts, he did not carry his point, for in March 1792 the King, moved by intrigues and by the intransigence of those who surrounded him, thought right to dismiss him from that Ministry. His resignation was the result of his disagreements with the Feuillants on the question of foreign war. Narbonne-Lara and his friends hoped to bring on the war with Austria, by which they hoped to restore the prestige of the monarchy. Narbonne-Lara made an alliance with the Marquis de Lafayette, but their schemes were defeated. After his resignation, he joined the Army of the North and, in May 1792, he was elevated to Lieutenant General of the Army. After less than six months from his dismissal, the French Monarchy was agonizing, the French Republic was proclaimed and the Royal Family was incarcerated. Later, Narbonne actually incurred suspicion as a Feuillant. The comte de Narbonne-Lara also had on him a prison warrant. Due to this, and also to questions about his policy at the war office, he managed to seek refuge at the Embassy of Sweden, emigrated after 10 August 1792, and later evaded to London and from there to Germany, having visited England, Switzerland and Germany. During the Consulate, his friends Talleyrand and Fouché managed to remove his name from the list of the wanted, and returned to France in 1801, where he was retired with the patent of Divisional General.\n\nIn 1809 Napoleon remembered him and called him into his service. Brilliant, cultivated and perfectly aware of the uses of the Ancien Régime, \"persona grata\" with the main Courts of Europe, skilled diplomat and military, he was the ideal person to be at his side. As such, he was reintegrated and re-entered the Army with his former post of Lieutenant General and appointed Governor of Raab, with the command of the whole part of Hungary occupied by the imperial troops. After signed the peace with Hungary, he was appointed Divisional General Commander of the 4th Military Division in Trieste. In that same year of 1809 he was sent to Vienna to arrange the marriage of the Emperor with Archduchess Marie Louise. In 1810 he was subsequently appointed Minister Plenipotentiary in Bavaria at Munich, next to King Maximilian I, whom he knew very well before the Revolution, and in 1811 \"aide-de-camp\" to Napoleon. He was created an Officer of the Legion of Honour and Grand Cross of the Order of Saint Hubert.\n\nIn 1812 he went on diplomatic mission to Prussia; this mission had the purpose of ascertaining King Frederick William III towards his attitude in case France went to war with Russia. In returning to Paris, de Narbonne-Lara advised Napoleon not to invade Russia, but his advice was not followed; and so he reassumed his place in the Imperial Army on the Russian border. When he arrived there, he was sent by Napoleon to the city of Wilna, where the Tsar was; the comte de Narbonne-Lara was the bearer of an ultimatum, to which Alexander I categorically refused.\n\nThe tragic outcome of the Russian Campaign did not minimize the action of the Officers of the Imperial Army. Among them, he was outstanding for his military uprightness and exemplary behaviour; in the whirl of the retreat, he appeared dauntless and serene, his presence imposed confidence and respect to the demoralized troops. Mounted on his horse beside the carriage of the defeated Napoleon, he was the personification of the dignity and honour of the \"Ancien Régime\".\n\nIn 1813 he was appointed and sent as French Ambassador at Vienna, where he was engaged in an unequal diplomatic duel with Metternich during the fateful months that witnessed the defection of Austria from the cause of Napoleon to that of the Allies, to confirm the alliance between France and Austria, objective he was not able to fulfill; the Empire had its days cut short. In that same year he was appointed Governor of the stronghold of Torgau (Saxony), one of the main strategic points for the defense of the Empire. On 17 November 1813, after reviewing the troops on horse, he died of typhus. His aide-de-camp, Captain comte de Rohan-Chabot, brought his heart back to France, and afterwards the name of the comte de Narbonne-Lara was inscribed on the east side of the Arc de Triomphe.\n\nSee AF Villemain, \"Souvenirs contemporains\" (Paris, 1854), Domingos de Araújo Afonso et alii, \"Le Sang de Louis XIV\" (Braga, 1961), Tome I, p. 276 and Filipe Folque de Mendoça, \"A Casa Loulé e Suas Alianças\", Livraria Bizantina, 1.ª Edição, Lisboa, 1995, pp. 171–172.\n"}

The emphasis is on the word \"wandering\" as an unplanned movement within a workplace, rather than a plan where employees expect a visit from managers at more systematic, pre-approved or scheduled times. \n\nThe expected benefit is that a manager, by random sampling of events or employee discussions, is more likely to facilitate improvements to the morale, sense of organizational purpose, productivity and total quality management of the organization, as compared to remaining in a specific office area and waiting for employees, or the delivery of status reports, to arrive there, as events warrant in the workplace.\n\n\"Management by wandering around\" very similar to the Japanese gemba walk method developed at Toyota.\n\nThe origin of the term has been traced to executives at the company Hewlett-Packard for management practices in the 1970s.

{"id": "26866", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26866", "title": "Seafood", "text": "Seafood\n\nSeafood is any form of sea life regarded as food by humans. Seafood prominently includes fish and shellfish.\nShellfish include various species of molluscs, crustaceans, and echinoderms. Historically, sea mammals such as whales and dolphins have been consumed as food, though that happens to a lesser extent in modern times. Edible sea plants, such as some seaweeds and microalgae, are widely eaten as seafood around the world, especially in Asia (see the ). In North America, although not generally in the United Kingdom, the term \"seafood\" is extended to fresh water organisms eaten by humans, so all edible aquatic life may be referred to as seafood. For the sake of completeness, this article includes all edible aquatic life.\n\nThe harvesting of wild seafood is usually known as fishing or hunting, and the cultivation and farming of seafood is known as aquaculture, or fish farming in the case of fish. Seafood is often distinguished from meat, although it is still animal and is excluded in a strict vegetarian diet. Seafood is an important source of protein in many diets around the world, especially in coastal areas.\n\nMost of the seafood harvest is consumed by humans, but a significant proportion is used as fish food to farm other fish or rear farm animals. Some seafoods (kelp) are used as food for other plants (fertilizer). In these ways, seafoods are indirectly used to produce further food for human consumption. Products, such as oil and spirulina tablets are also extracted from seafoods. Some seafood is fed to aquarium fish, or used to feed domestic pets, such as cats, and a small proportion is used in medicine, or is used industrially for non-food purposes (leather).\n\nThe harvesting, processing, and consuming of seafoods are ancient practices with archaeological evidence dating back well into the Paleolithic. Findings in a sea cave at Pinnacle Point in South Africa indicate \"Homo sapiens\" (modern humans) harvested marine life as early as 165,000 years ago, while the Neanderthals, an extinct human species contemporary with early \"Homo sapiens\", appear to have been eating seafood at sites along the Mediterranean coast beginning around the same time. Isotopic analysis of the skeletal remains of Tianyuan man, a 40,000-year-old anatomically modern human from eastern Asia, has shown that he regularly consumed freshwater fish. Archaeology features such as shell middens, discarded fish bones and cave paintings show that sea foods were important for survival and consumed in significant quantities. During this period, most people lived a hunter-gatherer lifestyle and were, of necessity, constantly on the move. However, where there are early examples of permanent settlements (though not necessarily permanently occupied) such as those at Lepenski Vir, they are almost always associated with fishing as a major source of food.\n\nThe ancient river Nile was full of fish; fresh and dried fish were a staple food for much of the population. The Egyptians had implements and methods for fishing and these are illustrated in tomb scenes, drawings, and papyrus documents. Some representations hint at fishing being pursued as a pastime.\n\nFishing scenes are rarely represented in ancient Greek culture, a reflection of the low social status of fishing. However, Oppian of Corycus, a Greek author wrote a major treatise on sea fishing, the \"Halieulica\" or \"Halieutika\", composed between 177 and 180. This is the earliest such work to have survived to the modern day. The consumption of fish varied in accordance with the wealth and location of the household. In the Greek islands and on the coast, fresh fish and seafood (squid, octopus, and shellfish) were common. They were eaten locally but more often transported inland. Sardines and anchovies were regular fare for the citizens of Athens. They were sometimes sold fresh, but more frequently salted. A stele of the late 3rd century BCE from the small Boeotian city of Akraiphia, on Lake Copais, provides us with a list of fish prices. The cheapest was \"skaren\" (probably parrotfish) whereas Atlantic bluefin tuna was three times as expensive. Common salt water fish were yellowfin tuna, red mullet, ray, swordfish or sturgeon, a delicacy which was eaten salted. Lake Copais itself was famous in all Greece for its eels, celebrated by the hero of \"The Acharnians\". Other fresh water fish were pike-fish, carp and the less appreciated catfish.\n\nPictorial evidence of Roman fishing comes from mosaics. At a certain time the goatfish was considered the epitome of luxury, above all because its scales exhibit a bright red color when it dies out of water. For this reason these fish were occasionally allowed to die slowly at the table. There even was a recipe where this would take place \"in garo\", in the sauce. At the beginning of the Imperial era, however, this custom suddenly came to an end, which is why \"mullus\" in the feast of Trimalchio (see \"the Satyricon\") could be shown as a characteristic of the \"parvenu\", who bores his guests with an unfashionable display of dying fish.\n\nIn medieval times, seafood was less prestigious than other animal meats, and often seen as merely an alternative to meat on fast days. Still, seafood was the mainstay of many coastal populations. Kippers made from herring caught in the North Sea could be found in markets as far away as Constantinople. While large quantities of fish were eaten fresh, a large proportion was salted, dried, and, to a lesser extent, smoked. Stockfish, cod that was split down the middle, fixed to a pole and dried, was very common, though preparation could be time-consuming, and meant beating the dried fish with a mallet before soaking it in water. A wide range of mollusks including oysters, mussels and scallops were eaten by coastal and river-dwelling populations, and freshwater crayfish were seen as a desirable alternative to meat during fish days. Compared to meat, fish was much more expensive for inland populations, especially in Central Europe, and therefore not an option for most.\n\nModern knowledge of the reproductive cycles of aquatic species has led to the development of hatcheries and improved techniques of fish farming and aquaculture. Better understanding of the hazards of eating raw and undercooked fish and shellfish has led to improved preservation methods and processing.\n\nThe following table is based on the ISSCAAP classification (International Standard Statistical Classification of Aquatic Animals and Plants) used by the FAO for the purposes of collecting and compiling fishery statistics. The production figures have been extracted from the FAO FishStat database, and include both capture from wild fisheries and aquaculture production.\n\nFish is a highly perishable product. The \"fishy\" smell of dead fish is due to the breakdown of amino acids into biogenic amines and ammonia.\n\nLive food fish are often transported in tanks at high expense for an international market that prefers its seafood killed immediately before it is cooked. This process originally was started by Lindeye. Delivery of live fish without water is also being explored. While some seafood restaurants keep live fish in aquaria for display purposes or for cultural beliefs, the majority of live fish are kept for dining customers. The live food fish trade in Hong Kong, for example, is estimated to have driven imports of live food fish to more than 15,000 tonnes in 2000. Worldwide sales that year were estimated at US$400 million, according to the World Resources Institute.\n\nIf the cool chain has not been adhered to correctly, food products generally decay and become harmful before the validity date printed on the package. As the potential harm for a consumer when eating rotten fish is much larger than for example with dairy products, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has introduced regulation in the USA requiring the use of a time temperature indicator on certain fresh chilled seafood products.\n\nFresh fish is a highly perishable food product, so it must be eaten promptly or discarded; it can be kept for only a short time. In many countries, fresh fish are filleted and displayed for sale on a bed of crushed ice or refrigerated. Fresh fish is most commonly found near bodies of water, but the advent of refrigerated train and truck transportation has made fresh fish more widely available inland.\n\nLong term preservation of fish is accomplished in a variety of ways. The oldest and still most widely used techniques are drying and salting. Desiccation (complete drying) is commonly used to preserve fish such as cod. Partial drying and salting is popular for the preservation of fish like herring and mackerel. Fish such as salmon, tuna, and herring are cooked and canned. Most fish are filleted prior to canning, but some small fish (e.g. sardines) are only decapitated and gutted prior to canning.\n\nSeafood is consumed all over the world; it provides the world's prime source of high-quality protein: 14–16% of the animal protein consumed worldwide; over one billion people rely on seafood as their primary source of animal protein. Fish is among the most common food allergens.\n\nIceland, Japan, and Portugal are the greatest consumers of seafood per capita in the world.\n\nThe UK Food Standards Agency recommends that at least two portions of seafood should be consumed each week, one of which should be oil-rich. There are over 100 different types of seafood available around the coast of the UK.\n\nOil-rich fish such as mackerel or herring are rich in long chain Omega-3 oils. These oils are found in every cell of the human body, and are required for human biological functions such as brain functionality.\n\nWhitefish such as haddock and cod are very low in fat and calories which, combined with oily fish rich in Omega-3 such as mackerel, sardines, fresh tuna, salmon and trout, can help to protect against coronary heart disease, as well as helping to develop strong bones and teeth.\n\nShellfish are particularly rich in zinc, which is essential for healthy skin and muscles as well as fertility. Casanova reputedly ate 50 oysters a day.\n\nOver 33,000 species of fish and many more marine invertebrate species have been described. Bromophenols, which are produced by marine algae, gives marine animals an odor and taste that is absent from freshwater fish and invertebrates. Also, a chemical substance called dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP) that is found in red and green algae is transferred to animals in the marine food chain. When broken down, dimethyl sulfide (DMS) is produced, and is often released during food preparation when fresh fish and shellfish are heated. In small quantities it creates a spesific smell one associates with the ocean, but which in larger quantities gives the impression of rotten seaweed and old fish. Another molecule known as TMAO occurs in fishes and give them a distinct smell. It also exists in freshwater species, but becomes more numerous in the cells of an animal the deeper it lives, so that fish from the deeper parts of the ocean has a stronger taste than species who lives in shallow water. However, only a small number of species are commonly eaten by humans.\n\nFish can form part of a nutritious diet and is a good source of vitamins and minerals; oily fish is rich in omega-3 fatty acid, which may benefit heart health.\n\nFish and shellfish have a natural tendency to concentrate mercury in their bodies, often in the form of methylmercury, a highly toxic organic compound of mercury. Species of fish that are high on the food chain, such as shark, swordfish, king mackerel, albacore tuna, and tilefish contain higher concentrations of mercury than others. This is because mercury is stored in the muscle tissues of fish, and when a predatory fish eats another fish, it assumes the entire body burden of mercury in the consumed fish. Since fish are less efficient at depurating than accumulating methylmercury, fish-tissue concentrations increase over time. Thus species that are high on the food chain amass body burdens of mercury that can be ten times higher than the species they consume. This process is called biomagnification. The first occurrence of widespread mercury poisoning in humans occurred this way in Minamata, Japan, now called Minamata disease.\n\nShellfish are among the more common food allergens.\nA common misconception is a cross-reactivity between seafood and iodinated radiocontrast agents.\n\nA 2013 study by Oceana found that one third of seafood sampled from the United States was incorrectly labelled. Snapper and tuna were particularly susceptible to mislabelling, and seafood substitution was the most common type of fraud. These practices can harm both the consumers' wallet and pose health risks. Another type of mislabelling is short-weighting, where practices such as overglazing or soaking can misleadingly increase the apparent weight of the fish. The detection of water retention agents helps identify the fraud and its origin.\n\nResearch into population trends of various species of seafood is pointing to a global collapse of seafood species by 2048. Such a collapse would occur due to pollution and overfishing, threatening oceanic ecosystems, according to some researchers.\n\nA major international scientific study released in November 2006 in the journal \"Science\" found that about one-third of all fishing stocks worldwide have collapsed (with a collapse being defined as a decline to less than 10% of their maximum observed abundance), and that if current trends continue all fish stocks worldwide will collapse within fifty years. In July 2009, Boris Worm of Dalhousie University, the author of the November 2006 study in \"Science\", co-authored an update on the state of the world's fisheries with one of the original study's critics, Ray Hilborn of the University of Washington at Seattle. The new study found that through good fisheries management techniques even depleted fish stocks can be revived and made commercially viable again.\n\nThe FAO State of World Fisheries and Aquaculture 2004 report estimates that in 2003, of the main fish stocks or groups of resources for which assessment information is available, \"approximately one-quarter were overexploited, depleted or recovering from depletion (16%, 7% and 1% respectively) and needed rebuilding.\"\n\nThe National Fisheries Institute, a trade advocacy group representing the United States seafood industry, disagree. They claim that currently observed declines in fish population are due to natural fluctuations and that enhanced technologies will eventually alleviate whatever impact humanity is having on oceanic life.\n\nFor the most part Islamic dietary laws allow the eating of seafood, though the Hanbali forbid eels, the Shafi forbid frogs and crocodiles, and the Hanafi forbid bottom feeders such as shellfish and carp. The Jewish laws of Kashrut forbid the eating of shellfish and eels. In the Old Testament, the Mosaic Covenant allowed the Israelites to eat finfish, but shellfish and eels were an abomination and not allowed. In ancient and medieval times, the Catholic Church forbade the practice of eating meat, eggs and dairy products during Lent. Thomas Aquinas argued that these \"afford greater pleasure as food [than fish], and greater nourishment to the human body, so that from their consumption there results a greater surplus available for seminal matter, which when abundant becomes a great incentive to lust.\" In the United States, the Catholic practice of abstaining from meat on Fridays during Lent has popularized the Friday fish fry, and parishes often sponsor a fish fry during Lent. In predominantly Roman Catholic areas, restaurants may adjust their menus during Lent by adding seafood items to the menu.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "37694", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37694", "title": "Seed", "text": "Seed\n\nA seed is an embryonic plant enclosed in a protective outer covering \n. The formation of the seed is part of the process of reproduction in seed plants, the spermatophytes, including the gymnosperm and angiosperm plants.\n\nSeeds are the product of the ripened ovule, after fertilization by pollen and some growth within the mother plant. The embryo is developed from the zygote and the seed coat from the integuments of the ovule.\n\nSeeds have been an important development in the reproduction and success of gymnosperm and angiosperm plants, relative to more primitive plants such as ferns, mosses and liverworts, which do not have seeds and use water-dependent means to propagate themselves. Seed plants now dominate biological niches on land, from forests to grasslands both in hot and cold climates.\n\nThe term \"seed\" also has a general meaning that antedates the above—anything that can be sown, e.g. \"seed\" potatoes, \"seeds\" of corn or sunflower \"seeds\". In the case of sunflower and corn \"seeds\", what is sown is the seed enclosed in a shell or husk, whereas the potato is a tuber.\n\nMany structures commonly referred to as \"seeds\" are actually dry fruits. Plants producing berries are called baccate. Sunflower seeds are sometimes sold commercially while still enclosed within the hard wall of the fruit, which must be split open to reach the seed. Different groups of plants have other modifications, the so-called stone fruits (such as the peach) have a hardened fruit layer (the endocarp) fused to and surrounding the actual seed. Nuts are the one-seeded, hard-shelled fruit of some plants with an indehiscent seed, such as an acorn or hazelnut.\n\nSeeds are produced in several related groups of plants, and their manner of production distinguishes the angiosperms (\"enclosed seeds\") from the gymnosperms (\"naked seeds\"). Angiosperm seeds are produced in a hard or fleshy structure called a fruit that encloses the seeds for protection in order to secure healthy growth. Some fruits have layers of both hard and fleshy material. In gymnosperms, no special structure develops to enclose the seeds, which begin their development \"naked\" on the bracts of cones. However, the seeds do become covered by the cone scales as they develop in some species of conifer.\n\nSeed production in natural plant populations varies widely from year to year in response to weather variables, insects and diseases, and internal cycles within the plants themselves. Over a 20-year period, for example, forests composed of loblolly pine and shortleaf pine produced from 0 to nearly 5 million sound pine seeds per hectare. Over this period, there were six bumper, five poor, and nine good seed crops, when evaluated for production of adequate seedlings for natural forest reproduction.\n\nAngiosperm (flowering plants) seeds consist of three genetically distinct constituents: (1) the embryo formed from the zygote, (2) the endosperm, which is normally triploid, (3) the seed coat from tissue derived from the maternal tissue of the ovule. In angiosperms, the process of seed development begins with double fertilization, which involves the fusion of two male gametes with the egg cell and the central cell to form the primary endosperm and the zygote. Right after fertilization, the zygote is mostly inactive, but the primary endosperm divides rapidly to form the endosperm tissue. This tissue becomes the food the young plant will consume until the roots have developed after germination.\n\nAfter fertilization the ovules develop into the seeds. The ovule consists of a number of components:\n\nThe shape of the ovules as they develop often affects the final shape of the seeds. Plants generally produce ovules of four shapes: the most common shape is called anatropous, with a curved shape. Orthotropous ovules are straight with all the parts of the ovule lined up in a long row producing an uncurved seed. Campylotropous ovules have a curved megagametophyte often giving the seed a tight \"C\" shape. The last ovule shape is called amphitropous, where the ovule is partly inverted and turned back 90 degrees on its stalk (the funicle or funiculus).\n\nIn the majority of flowering plants, the zygote's first division is transversely oriented in regards to the long axis, and this establishes the polarity of the embryo. The upper or chalazal pole becomes the main area of growth of the embryo, while the lower or micropylar pole produces the stalk-like suspensor that attaches to the micropyle. The suspensor absorbs and manufactures nutrients from the endosperm that are used during the embryo's growth.\n\nThe main components of the embryo are:\n\nMonocotyledonous plants have two additional structures in the form of sheaths. The plumule is covered with a coleoptile that forms the first leaf while the radicle is covered with a coleorhiza that connects to the primary root and adventitious roots form from the sides. Here the hypocotyl is a rudimentary axis between radicle and plumule. The seeds of corn are constructed with these structures; pericarp, scutellum (single large cotyledon) that absorbs nutrients from the endosperm, plumule, radicle, coleoptile and coleorhiza—these last two structures are sheath-like and enclose the plumule and radicle, acting as a protective covering.\n\nThe maturing ovule undergoes marked changes in the integuments, generally a reduction and disorganisation but occasionally a thickening. The seed coat forms from the two integuments or outer layers of cells of the ovule, which derive from tissue from the mother plant, the inner integument forms the tegmen and the outer forms the testa. (The seed coats of some mononocotyledon plants, such as the grasses, are not distinct structures, but are fused with the fruit wall to form a pericarp.) The testae of both monocots and dicots are often marked with patterns and textured markings, or have wings or tufts of hair. When the seed coat forms from only one layer, it is also called the testa, though not all such testae are homologous from one species to the next. The funiculus abscises (detaches at fixed point – abscission zone), the scar forming an oval depression, the hilum. Anatropous ovules have a portion of the funiculus that is adnate (fused to the seed coat), and which forms a longitudinal ridge, or raphe, just above the hilum. In bitegmic ovules (e.g. \"Gossypium\" described here) both inner and outer integuments contribute to the seed coat formation. With continuing maturation the cells enlarge in the outer integument. While the inner epidermis may remain a single layer, it may also divide to produce two to three layers and accumulates starch, and is referred to as the colourless layer. By contrast the outer epidermis becomes tanniferous. The inner integument may consist of eight to fifteen layers. (Kozlowski 1972)\n\nAs the cells enlarge, and starch is deposited in the outer layers of the pigmented zone below the outer epidermis, this zone begins to lignify, while the cells of the outer epidermis enlarge radially and their walls thicken, with nucleus and cytoplasm compressed into the outer layer. these cells which are broader on their inner surface are called palisade cells. In the inner epidermis the cells also enlarge radially with plate like thickening of the walls. The mature inner integument has a palisade layer, a pigmented zone with 15-20 layers, while the innermost layer is known as the fringe layer. (Kozlowski 1972)\n\nIn gymnosperms, which do not form ovaries, the ovules and hence the seeds are exposed. This is the basis for their nomenclature – naked seeded plants. Two sperm cells transferred from the pollen do not develop the seed by double fertilization, but one sperm nucleus unites with the egg nucleus and the other sperm is not used.\n\nA large number of terms are used to describe seed shapes, many of which are largely self-explanatory such as \"Bean-shaped\" (reniform) – resembling a kidney, with lobed ends on either side of the hilum, \"Square\" or \"Oblong\" – angular with all sides more or less equal or longer than wide, \"Triangular\" – three sided, broadest below middle, \"Elliptic\" or \"Ovate\" or \"Obovate\" – rounded at both ends, or egg shaped (ovate or obovate, broader at one end), being rounded but either symmetrical about the middle or broader below the middle or broader above the middle.\n\nOther less obvious terms include discoid (resembling a disc or plate, having both thickness and parallel faces and with a rounded margin), ellipsoid, globose (spherical), or subglobose (Inflated, but less than spherical), lenticular, oblong, ovoid, reniform and sectoroid. Striate seeds are striped with parallel, longitudinal lines or ridges. The commonest colours are brown and black, other colours are infrequent. The surface varies from highly polished to considerably roughened. The surface may have a variety of appendages (see Seed coat). A seed coat with the consistency of cork is referred to as suberose. Other terms include crustaceous (hard, thin or brittle).\n\nA typical seed includes two basic parts:\n\nIn addition, the endosperm forms a supply of nutrients for the embryo in most monocotyledons and the endospermic dicotyledons.\n\nSeeds have been considered to occur in many structurally different types (Martin 1946). These are based on a number of criteria, of which the dominant one is the embryo-to-seed size ratio. This reflects the degree to which the developing cotyledons absorb the nutrients of the endosperm, and thus obliterate it.\n\nSix types occur amongst the monocotyledons, ten in the dicotyledons, and two in the gymnosperms (linear and spatulate). This classification is based on three characteristics: embryo morphology, amount of endosperm and the position of the embryo relative to the endosperm.\n\nIn endospermic seeds, there are two distinct regions inside the seed coat, an upper and larger endosperm and a lower smaller embryo. The embryo is the fertilised ovule, an immature plant from which a new plant will grow under proper conditions. The embryo has one cotyledon or seed leaf in monocotyledons, two cotyledons in almost all dicotyledons and two or more in gymnosperms. In the fruit of grains (caryopses) the single monocotyledon is shield shaped and hence called a scutellum. The scutellum is pressed closely against the endosperm from which it absorbs food, and passes it to the growing parts. Embryo descriptors include small, straight, bent, curved and curled.\n\nWithin the seed, there usually is a store of nutrients for the seedling that will grow from the embryo. The form of the stored nutrition varies depending on the kind of plant. In angiosperms, the stored food begins as a tissue called the endosperm, which is derived from the mother plant and the pollen via double fertilization. It is usually triploid, and is rich in oil or starch, and protein. In gymnosperms, such as conifers, the food storage tissue (also called endosperm) is part of the female gametophyte, a haploid tissue. The endosperm is surrounded by the aleurone layer (peripheral endosperm), filled with proteinaceous aleurone grains.\n\nOriginally, by analogy with the animal ovum, the outer nucellus layer (perisperm) was referred to as albumen, and the inner endosperm layer as vitellus. Although misleading, the term began to be applied to all the nutrient matter. This terminology persists in referring to endospermic seeds as \"albuminous\". The nature of this material is used in both describing and classifying seeds, in addition to the embryo to endosperm size ratio. The endosperm may be considered to be farinaceous (or mealy) in which the cells are filled with starch, as for instance cereal grains, or not (non-farinaceous). The endosperm may also be referred to as \"fleshy\" or \"cartilaginous\" with thicker soft cells such as coconut, but may also be oily as in \"Ricinus\" (castor oil), \"Croton\" and Poppy. The endosperm is called \"horny\" when the cell walls are thicker such as date and coffee, or \"ruminated\" if mottled, as in nutmeg, palms and Annonaceae.\n\nIn most monocotyledons (such as grasses and palms) and some (endospermic or albuminous) dicotyledons (such as castor beans) the embryo is embedded in the endosperm (and nucellus), which the seedling will use upon germination. In the non-endospermic dicotyledons the endosperm is absorbed by the embryo as the latter grows within the developing seed, and the cotyledons of the embryo become filled with stored food. At maturity, seeds of these species have no endosperm and are also referred to as exalbuminous seeds. The exalbuminous seeds include the legumes (such as beans and peas), trees such as the oak and walnut, vegetables such as squash and radish, and sunflowers. According to Bewley and Black (1978), Brazil nut storage is in hypocotyl, this place of storage is uncommon among seeds. All gymnosperm seeds are albuminous.\n\nThe seed coat develops from the maternal tissue, the integuments, originally surrounding the ovule. The seed coat in the mature seed can be a paper-thin layer (e.g. peanut) or something more substantial (e.g. thick and hard in honey locust and coconut), or fleshy as in the sarcotesta of pomegranate. The seed coat helps protect the embryo from mechanical injury, predators and drying out. Depending on its development, the seed coat is either bitegmic or unitegmic. Bitegmic seeds form a testa from the outer integument and a tegmen from the inner integument while unitegmic seeds have only one integument. Usually parts of the testa or tegmen form a hard protective mechanical layer. The mechanical layer may prevent water penetration and germination. Amongst the barriers may be the presence of lignified sclereids.\n\nThe outer integument has a number of layers, generally between four and eight organised into three layers: (a) outer epidermis, (b) outer pigmented zone of two to five layers containing tannin and starch, and (c) inner epidermis. The endotegmen is derived from the inner epidermis of the inner integument, the exotegmen from the outer surface of the inner integument. The endotesta is derived from the inner epidermis of the outer integument, and the outer layer of the testa from the outer surface of the outer integument is referred to as the exotesta. If the exotesta is also the mechanical layer, this is called an exotestal seed, but if the mechanical layer is the endotegmen, then the seed is endotestal. The exotesta may consist of one or more rows of cells that are elongated and pallisade like (e.g. Fabaceae), hence 'palisade exotesta'.\n\nIn addition to the three basic seed parts, some seeds have an appendage, an aril, a fleshy outgrowth of the funicle (funiculus), (as in yew and nutmeg) or an oily appendage, an elaiosome (as in \"Corydalis\"), or hairs (trichomes). In the latter example these hairs are the source of the textile crop cotton. Other seed appendages include the raphe (a ridge), wings, caruncles (a soft spongy outgrowth from the outer integument in the vicinity of the micropyle), spines, or tubercles.\n\nA scar also may remain on the seed coat, called the hilum, where the seed was attached to the ovary wall by the funicle. Just below it is a small pore, representing the micropyle of the ovule.\n\nSeeds are very diverse in size. The dust-like orchid seeds are the smallest, with about one million seeds per gram; they are often embryonic seeds with immature embryos and no significant energy reserves. Orchids and a few other groups of plants are mycoheterotrophs which depend on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrition during germination and the early growth of the seedling. Some terrestrial orchid seedlings, in fact, spend the first few years of their lives deriving energy from the fungi and do not produce green leaves. At over 20 kg, the largest seed is the \"coco de mer\". Plants that produce smaller seeds can generate many more seeds per flower, while plants with larger seeds invest more resources into those seeds and normally produce fewer seeds. Small seeds are quicker to ripen and can be dispersed sooner, so fall blooming plants often have small seeds. Many annual plants produce great quantities of smaller seeds; this helps to ensure at least a few will end in a favorable place for growth. Herbaceous perennials and woody plants often have larger seeds; they can produce seeds over many years, and larger seeds have more energy reserves for germination and seedling growth and produce larger, more established seedlings after germination.\n\nSeeds serve several functions for the plants that produce them. Key among these functions are nourishment of the embryo, dispersal to a new location, and dormancy during unfavorable conditions. Seeds fundamentally are means of reproduction, and most seeds are the product of sexual reproduction which produces a remixing of genetic material and phenotype variability on which natural selection acts.\n\nSeeds protect and nourish the embryo or young plant. They usually give a seedling a faster start than a sporeling from a spore, because of the larger food reserves in the seed and the multicellularity of the enclosed embryo.\n\nUnlike animals, plants are limited in their ability to seek out favorable conditions for life and growth. As a result, plants have evolved many ways to disperse their offspring by dispersing their seeds (see also vegetative reproduction). A seed must somehow \"arrive\" at a location and be there at a time favorable for germination and growth. When the fruits open and release their seeds in a regular way, it is called dehiscent, which is often distinctive for related groups of plants; these fruits include capsules, follicles, legumes, silicles and siliques. When fruits do not open and release their seeds in a regular fashion, they are called indehiscent, which include the fruits achenes, caryopsis, nuts, samaras, and utricles.\n\n\nOther seeds are enclosed in fruit structures that aid wind dispersal in similar ways:\n\n\n\nMyrmecochory is the dispersal of seeds by ants. Foraging ants disperse seeds which have appendages called elaiosomes (e.g. bloodroot, trilliums, acacias, and many species of Proteaceae). Elaiosomes are soft, fleshy structures that contain nutrients for animals that eat them. The ants carry such seeds back to their nest, where the elaiosomes are eaten. The remainder of the seed, which is hard and inedible to the ants, then germinates either within the nest or at a removal site where the seed has been discarded by the ants. This dispersal relationship is an example of mutualism, since the plants depend upon the ants to disperse seeds, while the ants depend upon the plants seeds for food. As a result, a drop in numbers of one partner can reduce success of the other. In South Africa, the Argentine ant (\"Linepithema humile\") has invaded and displaced native species of ants. Unlike the native ant species, Argentine ants do not collect the seeds of \"Mimetes cucullatus\" or eat the elaiosomes. In areas where these ants have invaded, the numbers of \"Mimetes\" seedlings have dropped.\n\nSeed dormancy has two main functions: the first is synchronizing germination with the optimal conditions for survival of the resulting seedling; the second is spreading germination of a batch of seeds over time so a catastrophe (e.g. late frosts, drought, herbivory) does not result in the death of all offspring of a plant (bet-hedging). Seed dormancy is defined as a seed failing to germinate under environmental conditions optimal for germination, normally when the environment is at a suitable temperature with proper soil moisture. This true dormancy or innate dormancy is therefore caused by conditions within the seed that prevent germination. Thus dormancy is a state of the seed, not of the environment. Induced dormancy, enforced dormancy or seed quiescence occurs when a seed fails to germinate because the external environmental conditions are inappropriate for germination, mostly in response to conditions being too dark or light, too cold or hot, or too dry.\n\nSeed dormancy is not the same as seed persistence in the soil or on the plant, though even in scientific publications dormancy and persistence are often confused or used as synonyms.\n\nOften, seed dormancy is divided into four major categories: exogenous; endogenous; combinational; and secondary. A more recent system distinguishes five classes: morphological, physiological, morphophysiological, physical, and combinational dormancy.\n\nExogenous dormancy is caused by conditions outside the embryo, including:\n\nEndogenous dormancy is caused by conditions within the embryo itself, including:\n\nThe following types of seed dormancy do not involve seed dormancy, strictly speaking, as lack of germination is prevented by the environment, not by characteristics of the seed itself (see Germination):\n\nNot all seeds undergo a period of dormancy. Seeds of some mangroves are viviparous; they begin to germinate while still attached to the parent. The large, heavy root allows the seed to penetrate into the ground when it falls. Many garden plant seeds will germinate readily as soon as they have water and are warm enough; though their wild ancestors may have had dormancy, these cultivated plants lack it. After many generations of selective pressure by plant breeders and gardeners, dormancy has been selected out.\n\nFor annuals, seeds are a way for the species to survive dry or cold seasons. Ephemeral plants are usually annuals that can go from seed to seed in as few as six weeks.\n\nSeed germination is a process by which a seed embryo develops into a seedling. It involves the reactivation of the metabolic pathways that lead to growth and the emergence of the radicle or seed root and plumule or shoot. The emergence of the seedling above the soil surface is the next phase of the plant's growth and is called seedling establishment.\n\nThree fundamental conditions must exist before germination can occur. (1) The embryo must be alive, called seed viability. (2) Any dormancy requirements that prevent germination must be overcome. (3) The proper environmental conditions must exist for germination.\n\nSeed viability is the ability of the embryo to germinate and is affected by a number of different conditions. Some plants do not produce seeds that have functional complete embryos, or the seed may have no embryo at all, often called empty seeds. Predators and pathogens can damage or kill the seed while it is still in the fruit or after it is dispersed. Environmental conditions like flooding or heat can kill the seed before or during germination. The age of the seed affects its health and germination ability: since the seed has a living embryo, over time cells die and cannot be replaced. Some seeds can live for a long time before germination, while others can only survive for a short period after dispersal before they die.\n\nSeed vigor is a measure of the quality of seed, and involves the viability of the seed, the germination percentage, germination rate and the strength of the seedlings produced.\n\nThe germination percentage is simply the proportion of seeds that germinate from all seeds subject to the right conditions for growth. The germination rate is the length of time it takes for the seeds to germinate. Germination percentages and rates are affected by seed viability, dormancy and environmental effects that impact on the seed and seedling. In agriculture and horticulture quality seeds have high viability, measured by germination percentage plus the rate of germination. This is given as a percent of germination over a certain amount of time, 90% germination in 20 days, for example. 'Dormancy' is covered above; many plants produce seeds with varying degrees of dormancy, and different seeds from the same fruit can have different degrees of dormancy. It's possible to have seeds with no dormancy if they are dispersed right away and do not dry (if the seeds dry they go into physiological dormancy). There is great variation amongst plants and a dormant seed is still a viable seed even though the germination rate might be very low.\n\nEnvironmental conditions affecting seed germination include; water, oxygen, temperature and light.\n\nThree distinct phases of seed germination occur: water imbibition; lag phase; and radicle emergence.\n\nIn order for the seed coat to split, the embryo must imbibe (soak up water), which causes it to swell, splitting the seed coat. However, the nature of the seed coat determines how rapidly water can penetrate and subsequently initiate germination. The rate of imbibition is dependent on the permeability of the seed coat, amount of water in the environment and the area of contact the seed has to the source of water. For some seeds, imbibing too much water too quickly can kill the seed. For some seeds, once water is imbibed the germination process cannot be stopped, and drying then becomes fatal. Other seeds can imbibe and lose water a few times without causing ill effects, but drying can cause secondary dormancy.\n\nDuring seed dormancy, often associated with unpredictable and stressful environments, DNA damage accumulates as the seeds age. In rye seeds, the reduction of DNA integrity due to damage is associated with loss of seed viability during storage. Upon germination, seeds of \"Vicia faba\" undergo DNA repair. A plant DNA ligase that is involved in repair of single- and double-strand breaks during seed germination is an important determinant of seed longevity. Also, in Arabidopsis seeds, the activities of the DNA repair enzymes Poly ADP ribose polymerases (PARP) are likely needed for successful germination. Thus DNA damages that accumulate during dormancy appear to be a problem for seed survival, and the enzymatic repair of DNA damages during germination appears to be important for seed viability.\n\nA number of different strategies are used by gardeners and horticulturists to break seed dormancy.\n\nScarification allows water and gases to penetrate into the seed; it includes methods to physically break the hard seed coats or soften them by chemicals, such as soaking in hot water or poking holes in the seed with a pin or rubbing them on sandpaper or cracking with a press or hammer. Sometimes fruits are harvested while the seeds are still immature and the seed coat is not fully developed and sown right away before the seed coat become impermeable. Under natural conditions, seed coats are worn down by rodents chewing on the seed, the seeds rubbing against rocks (seeds are moved by the wind or water currents), by undergoing freezing and thawing of surface water, or passing through an animal's digestive tract. In the latter case, the seed coat protects the seed from digestion, while often weakening the seed coat such that the embryo is ready to sprout when it is deposited, along with a bit of fecal matter that acts as fertilizer, far from the parent plant. Microorganisms are often effective in breaking down hard seed coats and are sometimes used by people as a treatment; the seeds are stored in a moist warm sandy medium for several months under nonsterile conditions.\n\nStratification, also called moist-chilling, breaks down physiological dormancy, and involves the addition of moisture to the seeds so they absorb water, and they are then subjected to a period of moist chilling to after-ripen the embryo. Sowing in late summer and fall and allowing to overwinter under cool conditions is an effective way to stratify seeds; some seeds respond more favorably to periods of oscillating temperatures which are a part of the natural environment.\n\nLeaching or the soaking in water removes chemical inhibitors in some seeds that prevent germination. Rain and melting snow naturally accomplish this task. For seeds planted in gardens, running water is best—if soaked in a container, 12 to 24 hours of soaking is sufficient. Soaking longer, especially in stagnant water, can result in oxygen starvation and seed death. Seeds with hard seed coats can be soaked in hot water to break open the impermeable cell layers that prevent water intake.\n\nOther methods used to assist in the germination of seeds that have dormancy include prechilling, predrying, daily alternation of temperature, light exposure, potassium nitrate, the use of plant growth regulators, such as gibberellins, cytokinins, ethylene, thiourea, sodium hypochlorite, and others. Some seeds germinate best after a fire. For some seeds, fire cracks hard seed coats, while in others, chemical dormancy is broken in reaction to the presence of smoke. Liquid smoke is often used by gardeners to assist in the germination of these species.\n\nSeeds may be sterile for few reasons: they may have been irradiated, unpollinated, cells lived past expectancy, or bred for the purpose.\n\nThe origin of seed plants is a problem that still remains unsolved. However, more and more data tends to place this origin in the middle Devonian. The description in 2004 of the proto-seed \"Runcaria heinzelinii\" in the Givetian of Belgium is an indication of that ancient origin of seed-plants. As with modern ferns, most land plants before this time reproduced by sending spores into the air, that would land and become whole new plants.\n\nThe first \"true\" seeds are described from the upper Devonian, which is probably the theater of their true first evolutionary radiation. With this radiation came an evolution of seed size, shape, dispersal and eventually the radiation of gymnosperms and angiosperms and monocotyledons and dicotyledons. The seed plants progressively became one of the major elements of nearly all ecosystems.\n\nMany seeds are edible and the majority of human calories comes from seeds, especially from cereals, legumes and nuts. Seeds also provide most cooking oils, many beverages and spices and some important food additives. In different seeds the seed embryo or the endosperm dominates and provides most of the nutrients. The storage proteins of the embryo and endosperm differ in their amino acid content and physical properties. For example, the gluten of wheat, important in providing the elastic property to bread dough is strictly an endosperm protein.\n\nSeeds are used to propagate many crops such as cereals, legumes, forest trees, turfgrasses, and pasture grasses. Particularly in developing countries, a major constraint faced is the inadequacy of the marketing channels to get the seed to poor farmers. Thus the use of farmer-retained seed remains quite common.\n\nSeeds are also eaten by animals (seed predation), and are also fed to livestock or provided as birdseed.\n\nWhile some seeds are edible, others are harmful, poisonous or deadly. Plants and seeds often contain chemical compounds to discourage herbivores and seed predators. In some cases, these compounds simply taste bad (such as in mustard), but other compounds are toxic or break down into toxic compounds within the digestive system. Children, being smaller than adults, are more susceptible to poisoning by plants and seeds.\n\nA deadly poison, ricin, comes from seeds of the castor bean. Reported lethal doses are anywhere from two to eight seeds,\nthough only a few deaths have been reported when castor beans have been ingested by animals.\n\nIn addition, seeds containing amygdalin—apple, apricot, bitter almond, peach, plum, cherry, quince, and others—when consumed in sufficient amounts, may cause cyanide poisoning.\nOther seeds that contain poisons include annona, cotton, custard apple, datura, uncooked durian, golden chain, horse-chestnut, larkspur, locoweed, lychee, nectarine, rambutan, rosary pea, sour sop, sugar apple, wisteria, and yew. The seeds of the strychnine tree are also poisonous, containing the poison strychnine.\n\nThe seeds of many legumes, including the common bean (\"Phaseolus vulgaris\"), contain proteins called lectins which can cause gastric distress if the beans are eaten without cooking. The common bean and many others, including the soybean, also contain trypsin inhibitors which interfere with the action of the digestive enzyme trypsin. Normal cooking processes degrade lectins and trypsin inhibitors to harmless forms.\n\nPlease see the category for further relevant articles.\n\nCotton fiber grows attached to cotton plant seeds. Other seed fibers are from kapok and milkweed.\n\nMany important nonfood oils are extracted from seeds. Linseed oil is used in paints. Oil from jojoba and crambe are similar to whale oil.\n\nSeeds are the source of some medicines including castor oil, tea tree oil and the quack cancer drug Laetrile.\n\nMany seeds have been used as beads in necklaces and rosaries including Job's tears, Chinaberry, rosary pea, and castor bean. However, the latter three are also poisonous.\n\nOther seed uses include:\n\n\nThe Book of Genesis in the Old Testament begins with an explanation of how all plant forms began:\n\nAnd God said, Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind, whose seed is in itself, upon the earth: and it was so. And the earth brought forth grass, and herb yielding seed after its kind, and the tree yielding fruit, whose seed was in itself, after its kind: and God saw that it was good. And the evening and the morning were the third day.\n\nThe Quran speaks of seed germination thus:\n\nIt is Allah Who causeth the seed-grain and the date-stone to split and sprout. He causeth the living to issue from the dead, and He is the one to cause the dead to issue from the living. That is Allah: then how are ye deluded away from the truth?\n\n"}

Spiritual bypass can be addressed with various forms of psychotherapy, including focusing and motivational interviewing.\n\nSome neo-Advaita teachers, such as Jeff Foster and Andrew Cohen, have admitted that their own insight or \"awakening\" did not put an end to being a human being with personal, and even egoistical, feelings, aspirations and fears.

In August 1991, she was diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS or Lou Gehrig's disease) and was given two to five years to live. She ultimately made the decision to end her life and she sought the assistance of a doctor to that end. However, none would help her; under section 241(b) of the nation's Criminal Code, anyone who \"...aids or abets a person to commit suicide, whether suicide ensues or not, is guilty of an indictable offence and liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding fourteen years\". Rodriguez sought a legal exception in her home province, British Columbia, but was denied.\n\nThe British Columbia Civil Liberties Association (BCCLA) filed a lawsuit, \"Rodriguez v British Columbia (AG)\", that challenged section 241(b) as contrary to sections 7, 12, and 15 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. In a videotaped address to Parliament on November 24, 1992, Rodriguez famously asked, “If I cannot give consent to my own death, whose body is this? Who owns my life?” On May 20, 1993, her case was heard by the Supreme Court of Canada. On September 30 of that year, it decided against her 5-4.\n\nOn February 12, 1994, with the assistance of an anonymous doctor, Sue Rodriguez took her own life by ingesting a liquid mixture of morphine and secobarbital The doctor's intervention was arranged by MP Svend Robinson, who was regarded as one of Rodriguez's most prominent supporters. Robinson was present at her death. However, by her request, her ex-husband Henry and their son Cole were not. An investigation was undertaken, but no charges were laid. Robinson (who presently lives in Geneva, Switzerland) has vowed to never reveal the anonymous doctor's identity.\n\nAlmost 23 years later, on June 7, 2016, physician-assisted suicide became legal in Canada as the result of a similar Supreme Court case, \"Carter v Canada (AG)\". The Court unanimously struck down parts of section 241(b) and section 14 of the Criminal Code which the justices ruled unjustifiably infringed on section 7 of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms.\n\nSue Rodriguez was born in Winnipeg, Manitoba and grew up in the Toronto, suburb of Thornhill. She lived in California for a time before returning to Canada. Her first marriage to Henry Rodriguez ended after less than eight years, and she had a son.\n\nThe 1996 book \"Timely Death\" was inspired by the Sue Rodriguez story, and the 1998 film \"\", which stars Wendy Crewson as Sue Rodriguez, dramatizes her story.\n\nOn June 17, 2016, medically assisted dying became legal in Canada. An emotional Svend Robinson, who now lives in Geneva, Switzerland, told the press: “Today’s ruling is a victory for compassion, for justice and for humanity. And I pay tribute to the memory of Sue Rodriguez, who with courage, passion and dignity blazed the trail that led to this historic day. She would have been thrilled\".\n\n\n"}
{"id": "5913084", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5913084", "title": "Tokophobia", "text": "Tokophobia\n\nTokophobia is a significant fear of childbirth. It is the most common reason why some women request an elective cesarean section. The fear often includes fear of injury to the baby, genital tract, or death. Treatment may occur via counselling.\n\nIt is a type of specific phobia. In 2000, an article published in the \"British Journal of Psychiatry\" described the fear of childbirth as a psychological disorder that has received little attention and may be overlooked.\n\nPhobia of childbirth, as with any phobia, can manifest through a number of symptoms including nightmares, difficulty in concentrating on work or family activities, panic attacks and psychosomatic complaints. Often the fear of childbirth motivates a request for an elective caesarean section. Fear of labor pain is strongly associated with the fear of pain in general; a previous complicated childbirth, or inadequate pain relief, may cause the phobia to develop. A fear of pregnancy itself can result in an avoidance of pregnancy or even, as birth control methods are never 100% effective, an avoidance of sexual intercourse or asking for hysterectomy.\n\nTokophobia is a distressing psychological disorder which may be overlooked by medical professionals; as well as specific phobia and anxiety disorders, tokophobia may be associated with depression and post-traumatic stress disorder. Recognition of tokophobia and close liaison with obstetricians or other medical specialists can help to reduce its severity and ensure efficient treatment.\n\nReasons for tokophobia may be complex. Women may fear for the infant's life, fear the unknown and the uncertainty of the labour and birth process. Women may lack trust in obstetric services or fear being left alone in labour.\n\nPrimary tokophobia is the fear and deep-seated dread of childbirth in women who have never experienced birth. It may pre-date pregnancy and can start in adolescence or begin in pregnancy. This may relate back to their own mother's experience or be triggered by exposure to childbirth without adequate explanation at a young age. It may also be experienced by women who have been sexually abused or raped; childbirth could trigger flashbacks in women who are traumatised.\n\nSecondary tokophobia occurs in women who have experienced childbirth. The previous experience of birth may have been traumatic, or women may have experienced other upsetting events.\n\nThe term tokophobia was introduced in the medical literature in 2000. The word is from the Greek \"tokos\", meaning childbirth and \"phobos\", meaning fear.\n\nIt is also known as \"maleusiophobia\" (though this is certainly a variant of \"maieusiophobia\", from the Greek \"maieusis\", literally meaning \"delivery of a woman in childbirth\" but referring generally to midwifery), \"parturiphobia\" (from Latin \"parturire\", meaning \"to be pregnant\", and \"lockiophobia\".\n\n\n"}
{"id": "53301002", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=53301002", "title": "Tornado (bull)", "text": "Tornado (bull)\n\nTornado was a ProRodeo Hall of Fame bucking bull. He is also a Bull Riding Hall of Fame inductee. He bucked on the Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association (PRCA) circuit and went to the National Finals Rodeo (NFR) at least four times. He was voted Bucking Bull of the NFR four times consecutively from 1962 to 1965. Owned by rodeo champion Jim Shoulders, Tornado was named the \"meanest bull alive\" at the NFR four times. Tornado is best known for his matchup with ProRodeo Hall of Fame bull rider, Freckles Brown, which is most often referred to as \"The Ride.\" It was Brown who, in 1967, broke Tornado's undefeated streak of 220 buckoffs in six years. Tornado, Brown, and Shoulders all have been recorded in \"The Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture\" maintained online by the Oklahoma Historical Society.\n\nTornado was born in 1957 in Texas. The cowboy bull rider and stock contractor Jim Shoulders, of Henryetta, Oklahoma, owned and managed the bull; Shoulders actually maintained several quality bucking stock, which included the other \"weather\" bulls Cyclone, Hurricane, and Twister. According to Frank Boggs, an Oklahoman sports writer and columnist, Shoulders bought Tornado in South Texas when the bull was three years old. Tornado was a Brahma-Hereford crossbred bull, known as a Braford that generally weighed 1,850 pounds. He is described as red with a white face. Tornado first started bucking in Mesquite, Texas, in 1960. \n\nFrom Tornado's first rodeo in Mesquite, Texas, in 1960 through to the NFR in December 1967, he was undefeated, bucking off the toughest cowboys. There was a sign outside his pen at Shoulder's ranch in Henryetta: \"Warning: Enter at Your Own Risk.\" Shoulders declared that outside of the arena Tornado was tame, and he \"often walked up to Tornado in the pasture to pet him or feed him grass\". However, in the arena, \"Tornado transformed into a holy terror\".\n\nTornado qualified for the NFR every year from 1962 through 1966 and perhaps more. For those four years, he was the top-ranked bull on the bucking-stock list. For the first 220 attempts to ride him for a qualified ride, he remained undefeated. In addition to typical bucking abilities such as jumping, kicking, and spinning, Tornado also possessed something labeled \"clown-and-barrel fighting ability.\" His name came from his ability to quickly alter the direction of his spin. However, he used just enough energy as he needed to buck off the level of rider on him. Another hall of fame bull, Red Rock was known for using this strategy, and he was undefeated for his entire PRCA career of 309 attempts.\n\nTornado was sometimes referred to as \"unrideable\" by the cowboys. He was finally defeated in a famous ride with Brown. Cowboy songwriter and singer Red Steagall captured \"The Ride\" in his song \"The Ballad of Freckles Brown.\" Tornado (and Brown) are now documented in the Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture maintained online by the Oklahoma Historical Society.\nFor four of his trips to the NFR, Tornado was voted the Bucking Bull of the NFR and named \"The Meanest Bull Alive.\" Rodeo photographer Ferrell Butler, explained \"If you didn’t get out of there, he’d camp onto you something fierce. Then he’d go wipe out the barrel.\" Jim Shoulders’ wife Sharon said she did not consider him vicious; she believed that he “sized up” his riders, having noticed that he bucked harder with top riders than he did for locals.\n\nHalfway through his bucking career, in 1965, Shoulders put Tornado up for a $500 prize to anyone who could ride him at the 101 Wild West Ranch Rodeo. The offer was open to anyone, not just bull riders, as long as they were of legal age. No one won the prize. At the NFR in 1967 in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, ProRodeo Hall of Fame bull rider Myrtis Dightman tried to ride Tornado but failed. After \"The Ride,\" with Freckles Brown, Tornado was ridden four more times, once by Brown, and also by three other riders. The second time Brown rode him was in Miami, Florida. \n\nOn December 1, 1967, at the NFR in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, approximately 9,000 fans gathered in the Oklahoma State Fair Arena to watch 47-year-old Freckles Brown, the 1962 PRCA World Champion Bull Rider, attempt to ride Tornado. Brown had been studying the bull’s performance at many rodeos. However, his odds of success were considered to be slim: he was older than the typical cowboy and had had surgery on his neck.\n\nThe two were loaded into chute #2. After they were introduced, there was a great silence in the arena. Then Tornado exploded out of the gate, a moment seen in one of two iconic photographs of the event, taken by Ferrell Butler. Brown recounted the ride in detail, noting that he had a few seconds in the middle of the ride where he was concerned, but toward the end was confident that he would make it to the eight-second qualifying buzzer. Later, Brown said \"the crowd was so loud that he couldn't hear the whistle. However, he knew when the clowns moved in that he had successfully ridden the bull.\" The chute they had used was later exhibited in the office of the Chamber of Commerce.\n\nTornado was 11 years old by this time, yet he was still considered the most challenging bull. \"Tornado had such a reputation that most cowboys were thrown before they even got on him,\" says former state senator and Oklahoma Congressman Clem McSpadden, general manager of the NFR that year. \"But the bull was at a point in its career where it was fit to be ridden. Freckles got on him, bore down and ended up riding him pretty easy\".\n\n\"Radio icon Paul Harvey regaled a national audience for several minutes with details of Freckles Brown's historic ride on the fearsome Tornado. The publicity did wonders for the professional rodeo circuit.\" Butler noticed that before \"The Ride\", there would be modest crowds on the weekends, saying \"we couldn't get enough people in an arena to start a cussin' fight\", but afterwards, he saw crowd size increase noticeably.\n\nTornado was retired after the end of the 1968 rodeo season, to Shoulders' J Lazy S Ranch in Oklahoma. Shoulders stated that \"He enjoyed his prestigious position at the ranch and made it a point to attract attention when strangers were around by bellowing and throwing dirt – almost as though he wanted all to know he was still a champion\". Tornado died in spring 1972.\n\nShoulders died in 2007, but his wife Sharon loves to reminisce about him and Tornado, for example the cookies her two youngest daughters hand-fed Tornado while Jim was out touring. She claims Tornado was \"docile and gentle\" in the pasture, and still and relaxed in the chute until it was go time. \"He'd just stand there; he'd look out between the chute boards, almost like he was sizing up what he was going to do\".\n\nTornado is buried on the grounds of the National Cowboy and Western Heritage Museum in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, near the graves of two notable bucking horses. Apparently 18 acres at the museum are set aside for burial memorials of notable rodeo animals. To date, there have only been four animals buried there: Tornado, two notable bucking horses (Midnight and Five Minutes Til Midnight), and the museum's Longhorn mascot, Abilene. Tornado's spot has a huge memorial plague with a dedication. It appears on the Waymarking website.\n\n\n\nVideos:\n"}

In many legal jurisdictions, a murder involving \"exceptional brutality or cruelty\" will attract a harsher sentence.\n\nNotable individual incidents and successfully prosecuted cases are listed below but torture murder is much more common than this list may suggest. Lynching in the United States—extrajudicial killing by a mob, which often served as a means of racial terrorism—frequently involved public torture of the victim or victims, and was in many instances followed by human trophy collecting, too. Moreover, since industrial acid became available in quantity during the 19th century, acid attacks have become a globally widespread method of murder.\n\nIn the 21st century, many of the murders of foreigners in and citizens of Iraq and Syria committed by members of the terrorist organization Daesh were preceded by torture. Film footage of the persecution of Muslims in Myanmar documents the aftermath and testimony of torture murder by government forces, and evidence has demonstrated torture murder associated with many other massacres, war crimes, and genocides, both contemporary and historical.\n\nMurder laws worldwide vary a great deal, but a murder involving torture will generally attract a harsher penalty than a murder alone. Legal mechanisms of penalty enhancement vary between jurisdictions. In the laws of Italy, Germany, Norway, and many parts of the United States, there are two or more \"degrees\" of murder, with wording such as: \"...inflicting torture upon the victim prior to the victim's death\" typically used to rule that the highest degree should apply. In other jurisdictions, it may be that even if there was just one crime of murder, the sentencing practices and guidelines are such that the aggravating circumstance of any torture will nevertheless allow for a harsher than normal penalty.\n\nSome notable perpetrators and victims include the following.

It has been frequently represented in film and on television, in literature, on the Internet and in all kinds of games.\n\n\"Tyrannosaurus rex\" is unique among dinosaurs in its place in modern culture; paleontologist Robert Bakker has called it \"the most popular dinosaur among people of all ages, all cultures, and all nationalities\". From the beginning, it was embraced by the public. Henry Fairfield Osborn, the President of the American Museum of Natural History, billed it the greatest hunter to have ever walked the earth. He stated in 1905,\n\n\"Tyrannosaurus\" gained widespread public attention on December 30, 1905, when the \"New York Times\" hailed \"T. rex\" as \"the most formidable fighting animal of which there is any record whatever,\" the \"king of all kings in the domain of animal life,\" \"the absolute warlord of the earth,\" and a \"royal man-eater of the jungle.\" In 1906, \"Tyrannosaurus\" was dubbed the \"prize fighter of antiquity\" and the \"Last of the Great Reptiles and the King of Them All.\"\n\nIn 1927, Charles R. Knight painted a mural incorporating \"Tyrannosaurus\" facing a \"Triceratops\" in the Field Museum of Natural History, establishing the two dinosaurs as enemies in popular thought; paleontologist Phil Currie cites this mural as one of his inspirations to study dinosaurs. Bakker said of the imagined rivalry between \"Tyrannosaurus\" and \"Triceratops\", \"No matchup between predator and prey has ever been more dramatic. It's somehow fitting that those two massive antagonists lived out their co-evolutionary belligerence through the very last days of the very last epoch of the Age of Dinosaurs.\"\n\n\"Tyrannosaurus rex\" has played a major role in many films, starting in 1918 with \"The Ghost of Slumber Mountain\", written and directed by stop motion special effects pioneer Willis O'Brien. \"The Ghost of Slumber Mountain\" is also, and most likely, the first film showing \"Tyrannosaurus\" facing \"Triceratops\". The king of the tyrant lizards came back in 1925 with the classic adaptation of Arthur Conan Doyle's novel \"The Lost World\". \"Tyrannosaurus\" fossils weren't so famous at the time of the publication of the novel (1912), and the only main villain dinosaur on the book was \"Allosaurus\", with no appearance of \"Tyrannosaurus\", but this 1925 film featured \"Tyrannosaurus\" anyway, for a more dramatic and spectacular effect.\n\nStop motion animator Willis O'Brien, who had worked on \"The Ghost of Slumber Mountain\" and \"The Lost World\", was again responsible of special effects in the 1933 monster movie \"King Kong\", which featured a climactic battle between the giant ape and a \"Tyrannosaurus\". The \"Tyrannosaurus\" model was made using a cast based on an early painting by Charles R. Knight. O'Brien stated that the battle between Kong and the \"Tyrannosaurus\" was one of the most technically difficult scenes in the film to animate. Many early films depicted \"Tyrannosaurus\" with an upright posture based on the current thinking of the time. Most of these films inaccurately portrayed the dinosaur with three prominent fingers on each hand like \"Allosaurus\" (though \"Tyrannosaurus\" had a third, vestigial finger, it wouldn't have been noticeable at first glance); Walt Disney is reported to have informed dinosaur hunter Barnum Brown that \"it looked better that way,\" and the creature was depicted as such in Disney's \"Fantasia\". Since that time, \"T. rex\" has appeared in a great number of \"monster\" films and educational documentaries. One of the first appearances which portrayed a proper posture and anatomy of \"Tyrannosaurus\" is the 1984 short \"Prehistoric Beast\", fully conceived and made by Phil Tippett by means of his so-called go motion technique.\n\nOne of the most iconic depictions of \"Tyrannosaurus\" in film was in 1993's \"Jurassic Park\", where dinosaurs including \"T. rex\" are brought back to life using blood from fossilized mosquitoes. In the film, the dinosaur breaks free of its theme park enclosure, and proceeds to roam the park after attacking the visitors and killing one (a lawyer). In the film's finale, the \"Tyrannosaurus\" indirectly saves the main characters by killing the \"Velociraptors\", who had been hunting them through the visitor center. The popularity of \"T. rex\" has long had a reciprocal effect on dinosaur science; the popularity of \"Jurassic Park\" factored into the discovery of the dinosaur genus \"Scipionyx\"; fossils of this genus had lain in storage in a basement in Italy until the film's release attracted attention from the fossil owner. Two \"Tyrannosaurus\" appeared again as primary antagonists in \"\", the sequel to \"Jurassic Park\". In \"Jurassic Park III\", it appeared briefly in a confrontation against the main antagonist, \"Spinosaurus\", only to be killed by it. In a twist, the same \"Tyrannosaurus\" from the original 1993 film appears as the climactic protagonist in \"Jurassic World\" (2015), making an entrance by smashing through a \"Spinosaurus\" skeleton. Against the odds, it defeats the \"Indominus Rex,\" with the assistance of a \"Velociraptor\", dubbed \"Blue,\" and a \"Mosasaurus\". This specific \"Tyrannosaurus\" reappears in \"\".\n\n\"Tyrannosaurus\" is one of the three dinosaur types whose physical characteristics were combined by the designers at Toho, to create the Japanese monster Godzilla; the other two dinosaurs were \"Stegosaurus\" and \"Iguanodon\".\n\nAmong other appearances, \"Tyrannosaurus\" has made major appearances in many other films, including \"Dinosaurus!\" (1960), \"One Million Years B.C.\" (1966), \"The Last Dinosaur\" (1977), \"The Land Before Time\" (1988), \"We're Back! A Dinosaur's Story\" (1993), \"Toy Story\" (1995), \"\" (1997), \"Night at the Museum\" (2006), \"Meet the Robinsons\" (2007), \"\" (2009), and \"The Good Dinosaur\" (2015). The IMAX 3D film \"\" (1998) featured a \"Tyrannosaurus\" in various time travel sequences, as well as its discoverer, Barnum Brown\n\nSome Japanese animated films have a \"Tyrannosaurus\" as a main protagonist (\"You Are Umasou\", 2010), as the main villain (\"Daikyouryu no Jidai\", \"The Age of the Great Dinosaurs\", 1979), as a minor antagonist (\"Magic Tree House\", 2011), or as a neutral character (\"\", 1980, as well as its ).\n\n\"Tyrannosaurus\" has starred in several television series, including children's programs, both in those intended as fiction, and, more recently, documentaries.\n\nIn \"Barney & Friends\", Barney is a stylized \"Tyrannosaurus rex\". In the Australian children's show \"The Wiggles\", the character \"Dorothy the Dinosaur\" is a stylized adaptation of a \"Tyrannosaurus\". Some \"Tyrannosaurus\" characters appear in \"Dinosaur Train\", most prominently Buddy.\n\n\"Tyrannosaurus\" was one of several dinosaurs featured in the 1974 \"Doctor Who\" adventure \"Invasion of the Dinosaurs\", starring Jon Pertwee. A sleeping juvenile is also seen on the Silurian ark in \"Dinosaurs on a Spaceship\". A Time travelled \"Tyrannosaurus\" seen on London in \"Deep Breath\".\n\nIn 1985 the 1984 \"Prehistoric Beast\" short was served to Robert Guenette to direct a full length TV documentary titled \"Dinosaur!\", for which Phil Tippett made new \"Tyrannosaurus\" go motion sequences (chasing \"Hadrosaurus\") in addition to those he made for \"Prehistoric Beast\" (where \"Tyrannosaurus\" was chasing \"Monoclonius\").\n\nIn the 1985 cartoon \"Transformers\" the popular Autobot, Grimlock, transformed into a mechanical \"Tyrannosaurus\" and in later incarnations a \"Megaraptor.\" In the sequel series, \"Beast Wars\", Megatron, the leader of the Predacons, turned into a techno-organic \"Tyrannosaurus\".\n\nIn the cartoon \"The Terrible Thunderlizards\", 'Mr. T' plays a \"Tyrannosaurus rex\" called Mr. T-rex.

They also appear in their respective Power Rangers adaptations in Season One of \"Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers\", \"Power Rangers Time Force\", \"Power Rangers Dino Thunder\", \"Power Rangers Super Megaforce\" and \"Power Rangers Dino Charge\".\n\nA CGI animated \"Tyrannosaurus rex\" named Tina Rex is a bully in Gumball's school in the 2011–present animated series on Cartoon Network, \"The Amazing World of Gumball\".\n\nIn literature, a dominant representation of \"Tyrannosaurus\" since 1990 has been that of Michael Crichton's, as seen in the novel \"Jurassic Park\" and its sequel \"The Lost World\" (homage title to the 1912 novel by Arthur Conan Doyle, about scientists discovering a South American plateau where dinosaurs still exist). Its skeleton was also used to illustrate the covers of these books.\n\nA \"Tyrannosaurus rex\" was the protagonist of the children's book \"We're Back! A Dinosaur's Story\" (later adapted into a feature-length film of the same name). \"Tyrannosaurus\" has also been featured in the novel \"Primeval: Extinction Event\", by Dan Abnett.\n\n\"Tyrannosaurus\" has appeared in many media and is perhaps one of the most widely used dinosaurs. Various incarnations of, and creatures based on \"T. rex\" have appeared in video games, and several game series have featured \"Tyrannosaurus\" a centerpiece. These include \"3D Monster Maze\", the \"Dino Crisis\"/\"Dino Stalker\" line, various \"Jurassic Park\" tie-in games, the \"Turok\" game series, \"Tomb Raider\", the \"Zoo Tycoon\" series, the survival game \"\", the simulation games \"Saurian\" and \"The Isle\", and \"Super Mario Odyssey\".\n\nNumerous models and children's toys depicting \"Tyrannosaurus\" have been produced, particularly in promotion of the \"Jurassic Park\" films. The Carnegie Museum Dinosaur Collection toy line released two versions of the dinosaur, with the second brought in line with more modern scientific understanding. Sinclair Oil ads from the 1950s frequently featured \"T. rex\", and products from radio-controlled helicopter models to a rifle cartridge (the .577 T-Rex) have been named after the dinosaur. In music, the popular 1970s glam rock band T. Rex took their name from the famous dinosaur.\n\nIn the \"Calvin and Hobbes\" comics, fantasy sequences often featured \"Tyrannosaurus rex\". In one story arc, in which Calvin writes a school paper on the \"T. rex\" predator/scavenger debate, he argues that \"T. rex\" was a predator because \"They're so much cooler that way.\" \"T. rex\" is also featured as the protagonist in the long-running webcomic \"Dinosaur Comics\" by Ryan North. Various \"T. rex\" have featured in stories published in the British comic \"2000AD\".\n\nUrsula Dubosarsky's picture book, simply called \"Rex\" and illustrated by David Mackintosh, concerns a pet lizard who assumes the proportions of a \"T. rex\" in the imagination of a series of children.\n\nIn \"Pokémon X and Y\", there is an evolution family consisting of Tyrunt and Tyrantrum both of which are based on \"Tyrannosaurus\".\n\n"}

(; Chazeau, Loire 1798 – 1843 at sea) was a French Catholic missionary in the Eastern Pacific.\n\nFor the Congregation of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary, he served as Vicar Apostolic and Titular Bishop of Nilopolis from 1833 to 1843 of the Vicariate Apostolic of Oriental Oceania, from which were derived the Archdiocese of Pape‘ete, the Roman Catholic Diocese of Honolulu and the Diocese of Taiohae o Tefenuaenata in the Marquesas Islands. As a missionary bishop, Msgr. Rouchouze resided in Valparaíso, Chile and in Honolulu; he was responsible for the evangelization efforts of the Picpus Fathers in the Hawaiian Islands and eastern Pacific. His motto was \"Per aspera in astera\" (from hardship to the stars).\n\nPrior to his episcopal ministry, Pope Gregory XVI, on November 27, 1825, created the Prefecture Apostolic of the Sandwich Islands. Father Alexis Bachelot was subsequently appointed its first prefect on December 3, 1825.\n\nMsgr. Rouchouze was appointed Vicar Apostolic of Oriental Oceania and Titular Bishop of Nilopolis on June 14, 1833 with ordinary jurisdiction over the Hawai‘i prefecture apostolic. He was subsequently consecrated to the episcopate in Rome, on December 22, 1833 by the Prefect of the \"Propaganda Fide\", Cardinal Carlo Maria Pedicini. On June 29, 1834, in Golden Square in London, Msgr. Rouchouze served as principal co-consecrator in the episcopal ordination of Msgr. John Bede Polding, O.S.B., Titular Bishop of Hierocaesarea and Vicar Apostolic elect of New Holland.\n\nRouchouze left Le Havre on October 29, 1834 and arrived in Valparaíso, Chile on February 19, 1835. After staying a few months, he went on to Mangareva in the Gambier Islands on May 9, 1835. He baptized the island's king Maputeoa and his family on August 25, 1836. On April 4, 1839, Msgr. Rouchouze returned to blessed the first stone for the St. Michael's Cathedral, Rikitea in Mangareva. He said the first pontifical Mass in the Marquesas at Tahuata on February 6, 1839. He arrived in Honolulu on May 14, 1840.\n\nOn December 8, 1842, the ship \"Marie-Joseph\" was blessed in Saint Malo in Brittany. Shortly thereafter, Msgr. Rouchouze, accompanied by thirteen brothers and ten sisters, left Saint Malo for Oceania on the \"Marie-Joseph\". A nun died at sea. Unwilling to bury her at sea, they put into Island of Saint Catherine and buried her there. On February 19, 1843, Rouchouze and his twenty-two missionaries left the island on the \"Marie-Joseph\". The party stopped off in Florianópolis in Brazil to bury the body of Sister Caliste Le Gris, who had died on board. Evaristo, a Mangarevan youth, fell ill and also died while they were in Brazil. The ship was last sited off the Falkland Islands on March 13, 1843. Rouchouze and his companions were never seen again and were presumed to have perished at sea.\n\n\n\n"}
