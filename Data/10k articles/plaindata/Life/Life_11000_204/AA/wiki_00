He reigned from 1361 until his death.\n\nAlbert I was the eldest son of the Duke Ernest the elder of Grubenhagen and his wife, Adelheid of Eberstein. In 1359, his father made him co-ruler. After his father's death in 1361, he ruled the principality alone, except for a few possessions at Osterode and Herzberg, which he ceded to his brother Frederick. He lived alone at Salzderhelden Castle in Einbeck, which is why he was nicknamed \"Duke of Salt\".\n\nHe has been praised as a lover of history and science. Nevertheless, highway robbery flourished during his rule, and he may even have engaged in it himself, which got him into a dispute with his neighbours. On 28 Jun 1361, he shared a letter of tribute from the City of Brunswick with his brother John, but later that year, he got into a feud with Count Otto of Waldeck and his son Henry. In 1362, Albert and John were captured during the battle at Arnoldshausen. They were only released after they had sworn \"Urfehde\".\n\nThe territories of Landgrave Frederick III of Thuringia were particularly hard hit by the forays of Albert and his vassals. After several unsuccessful warnings, Frederick III attacked Grubenhagen in 1365 with what was then considered a major army. It has been claimed that the army numbered over eighteen thousand men. They made camp before Einbeck and Salzderhelden. However, after a few months, they had to leave without having accomplished anything. The account of this attack contains the first mention of a gun in Brunswick (\"diz waz die erste buchse, dy yn dessin landin vernommen wart\"). The Landgrave devastated towns and villages, and captured and tore down the robber castles of several of Albert's vassals and thereby forced him to sue for peace. Albert soon broke the peace again, the Landgrave devastated his country again, and Albert had to wait in Eisenach until the dispute was arbitrated.\n\nDue to these feuds, Albert was short of money and had to pledge some of his possessions. For example, in 1365 he pledged the bailiwick of Hamelin to Coun John of Spigelbert and in 1372, the city of Hamelin itself to Count Otto of Schaumburg and in 1370, to the City Council of Brunswick, his share of the precincts Altewiek and Sack, the judiciary, the Jewish tax and the mills of Brunswick. In 1381, he sold several villages located around Einbeck for 300 Rhenish florins to the Bishop of Hildesheim.\n\nAlbert was married with Agnes, daughter of Duke Magnus with the chain of Brunswick. They had one son: Eric I.\n\nAlbert probably died in 1383 and was buried in St. Alexandri Minster in Einbeck.\n"}

The death can be felt more intensely when the owner has made a decision to end the pet’s life through euthanasia. While there is strong evidence that animals can feel such loss for other animals, this article focuses on human feelings, when an animal is lost, dies or otherwise is departed.\n\nThere is no set amount of time for the grieving process to occur. However, mourning is much more intense for a pet upon whom the owner was emotionally dependent. Additionally, some pet owners may feel unable to express their grieving due to social mores surrounding pets. If the pet owner internalizes the grief, the suffering increases.\n\nThe stages of grief proposed by Elizabeth Kübler-Ross was designed in relation to human death, but can be adapted to describe the grief process for the death of a pet. Indeed, pet death includes several lessons: 1) the relationship rather than the object (the animal) is central to understand the loss; 2) the manner of death/loss will affect the grieving process; 3) the age and living situation of the bereaved will affect the grieving process.\n\nUniversity of Michigan did a study of grief over loss of a pet, the study included 174 adults who had lost their pets. Participants were administered a modified CENSHARE Pet Attachment Survey. Results indicate that initially 85.7% of owners experienced at least one symptom of grief, but the occurrence decreased to 35.1% at six months and to 22.4% at one year. Males and females reported different rates on six of 12 symptoms surveyed. The severity and length of symptoms is significantly correlated with the degree of attachment to the deceased pet. These findings indicate that pet loss can be a potential area of clinical concern, especially if the person's attachment to the pet was strong. \n\nThough well-meaning phrases like \"time heals all wounds\" can simply upset the grieving pet owner, it is true that the one factor required for all coping strategies is time. Coping also involves understanding the emotions surrounding the loss of a pet, and then accepting the emotions to focus towards positive solutions.\n\nCoping strategies may include:\n\n\nThere are several special types of loss:\n\nOne caveat is to carefully consider timing bringing a new pet into the home. Additionally, it is recommended to consider where the bereaved is in the grieving process. Choose the new pet for its own unique qualities rather than trying to replace the former pet.\n\nA recent trend has seen some pet owners getting clones made of their deceased pets. A new TLC show called \"I Cloned My Pet\" profiles some of these pet owners who want nothing more than the return of their original pets. For these pet owners, nothing will do but the original, and people will pay up to $100,000 for a cloning. Some people shown on the show waited for over ten years for the return of their pet.\n\nPet illness and death is gradually becoming recognized as similar to other forms of sickness and death in the family. In the UK, a variety of companies provide paid leave for such eventualities, with employment tribunals backing this in some instances where employment terms did not specifically mention pet loss.\n\nRecent studies by insurers suggest that up to one in four pet owners are sufficiently affected by pet loss or illness to take time off, but that many feel this will be treated lightly and hence simply state they were sick. According to Petplan, 35% of people admitted to taking time off work to either settle new pets into the home or care for sick pets, and half of those admitted taking a whole week off, and according to Direct Line one in four pet owners \"said they have been too upset to go into the workplace when their four legged friend died\" and \"many of those who did go into work after the death of their pet said they were unproductive.\" The latter survey also noted that pet owners in the UK take \"around 8 days off\" due to grief at the death of a pet, and that \"seventy-nine percent of people responding to the survey admitted they did not think their boss would be sympathetic, and the only way they could get time off work was by... pretending to be ill.\" \n\nResources for pet loss change regularly, but include grief counseling, support groups, online forums, hotlines and books. The Pet Loss Support Page maintains an updated list of recommended resources.\n\nResources include:\n\nSome world religions have held that beloved pets will join their families in an afterlife. Animal worship was common in the ancient world, influencing the burial practices of animals. Animal mummification was practiced in Ancient Egypt, and gave special significance to cats in some areas. Egyptians believed that mummification was imperative in order to gain admittance to the afterlife, and therefore the belief was that the mummification of these pets would ensure the animals’ immortality.\n\nSome Ancient Egyptian families believed that mummified pets would keep the deceased company in the afterlife. The most common Egyptian pets included cats, dogs, mongooses, monkeys, gazelles, and birds. Many Egyptians loved their pets, and the customary process of mourning the loss of a loved pet included crying and shaving one’s eyebrows. Ancient Egyptian pets were given names like we name our pets today, evidenced by over 70 names deciphered inscriptions identifying pet dog mummies.\n\nModern religions are divided as to whether non-human animals are believed to have souls, reincarnate or none, and also whether animals will exist in the afterlife.\n\nIn the absence of a common religious belief, many pet owners have embraced the concept of the Rainbow Bridge. The concept, the origin of which is not clearly known, speaks of a metaphorical or mythical place of reunion where pets that die live in a paradisical version of limbo, rejuvenated and free of pain and suffering, until their companion humans arrive upon their deaths. At this point, the pet(s) run to their companion humans, and they enter heaven together, never to be parted again.\n\nIn Mormonism, all organisms (as well as the entire planet Earth) are believed to have a spirit, but that beings without the gift of free agency (the ability to know and choose between right and wrong) are innocent and unblemished spirits who go straight to Heaven when they die. Animals will be resurrected.\n\nAnimal chaplains are becoming increasingly popular for helping the bereaved family members deal with the loss of their pet to provide memorial services, spiritual reassurance, and grief counseling.\n\n\n"}

She was reputed as one of the most beautiful and accomplished princesses of the Italian Renaissance. A member of the Este family, she was the younger daughter of Ercole I d'Este and the sister of Isabella d'Este and Alfonso d'Este. Along with her sister, Beatrice was noted for her excellent taste in fashion and for having invented new clothing styles.\n\nThe Ferrarese house of Este and the Milanese house of Sforza had always been on friendly terms and in 1490, in order to cement an alliance, Ludovico Sforza formally asked Ercole d'Este to give him the hand of his daughter in marriage. Ludovico, who was then duke of Bari and regent to the duke of Milan, had originally requested a betrothal to Isabella, Beatrice's older sister, but because she was already promised to Francesco Gonzaga, Ercole offered him Beatrice instead. Il Moro made no objection to the arrangement and Beatrice was married to him in January 1491.\n\nThe official nuptials were to have taken place in 1490 in a double wedding with Beatrice marrying Ludovico and Isabella marrying Francesco at the same time, but the Duke of Bari postponed it more than once. Finally, around a year later, they were wed in a double Sforza-Este wedding: Ludovico married Beatrice, while Beatrice's brother, Alfonso d'Este, married Anna Sforza, the sister of Gian Galeazzo Sforza. Leonardo da Vinci orchestrated the wedding celebration.\n\nBeatrice had been carefully educated, and availed herself of her position as mistress of one of the most splendid courts of Italy to gather around her learned men, poets and artists, such as Niccolò da Correggio, Bernardo Castiglione, Donato Bramante, Leonardo da Vinci, and many others.\n\nIn 1492 she visited Venice as ambassador for her husband in his political schemes, which consisted chiefly of a desire to be recognized as duke of Milan. On the death of Gian Galeazzo Sforza, Ludovico's usurpation was legalized, and after the Battle of Fornovo (1495), both he and his wife took part in the peace congress of Vercelli between Charles VIII of France and the Italian princes, at which Beatrice showed great political ability.\n\nHowever, her brilliant career was cut short by death through childbirth, on 3 January 1497 at the age of 21. In a letter written hours after her death, Ludovico informed his brother-in-law Francesco Gonzaga that his wife, \"gave back her spirit to God\" half an hour after midnight. Their child had been born at eleven at night and was a stillborn son.\n\n\nBeatrice d'Este belonged to the best class of Renaissance women, and was one of the cultural influences of the age; to a great extent, her patronage and good taste are responsible for the splendour of the Castello Sforzesco in Milan, the Certosa of Pavia, and many other famous buildings in Lombardy. Her tomb is preserved in the Certosa di Pavia where she is buried beside her husband Ludovico Sforza.\n\nBeatrice d'Este is very often mistaken as the sitter of \"\" by Ambrogio de Predis at the Pinacoteca Ambrosiana in Milan.

He was bred in the kennels of Kathleen, Duchess of Newcastle, and became the constant companion of the King. After the King's death in 1910, the dog attended the funeral and walked in the procession in prominence ahead of nine kings and other heads of state. Caesar has been the subject of paintings, and a hand crafted hardstone model created by the House of Fabergé.\n\nCaesar was born Caesar of Notts in 1898, and was sired by Cackler of Notts. He came from the kennels of Kathleen, Duchess of Newcastle, and was given to King Edward VII by Lord Dudley in 1902 to replace the King's dog Jack who had died after choking on food.\n\nDuring his life with the King, he had a footman assigned to him to clean him and was allowed to sleep on an easy chair next to the King's bed. He wore a collar that read \"I am Caesar. I belong to the King\".\n\nCaesar would always greet the King excitedly, and the King would often say \"Do you like your old master, then?\" while the dog was jumping up and down in excitement. Edward would never hit Caesar, but instead tell him off by shaking his walking stick at him while calling him a \"naughty dog\". Charles Hardinge, 1st Baron Hardinge of Penshurst, reminisced about spending time with the dog whilst on the royal yacht, \"Whenever I went into the King's cabin, this dog always went for my trousers and worried them, much to the King's delight. I used not to take the slightest notice and went on talking all the time to the King which I think amused His Majesty still more.\" Caesar frequently caused problems for the King, escaping in Marienbad whilst chasing white peafowl and on another occasion killing rabbits owned by Lord Redesdale's daughters. The King even considered Caesar to be an obstacle to the Entente Cordiale. He asked his personal attendant, Lawrence Wrightson, to look after Caesar should he die before the dog.\n\nThe King ordered hardstone models of his favourite dogs and racehorses from the House of Fabergé. Caesar was at the King's side on the Norfolk estate when the initial wax models were revealed by the company. The model of Caesar was made of chalcedony, rubies, enamel and gold, and included Caesar's collar in the design. The finished model did not arrive until after the King's death, and was purchased by Dame Margaret Greville, who gave the figure to Queen Alexandra. A painting of the dog was also created by Reuben Ward Binks for the King.\n\nAfter the death of the King on 6 May 1910, Caesar refused to eat, and would spend time whining outside the King's bedroom. At one point, he managed to sneak into the King's bedroom and was found hiding under his bed by Queen Alexandra. The Queen encouraged him to eat once more and restored him to his normal self. Caesar attended the funeral of Edward VII, and led the funeral procession with a highlander walking behind the carriage that carried the King's coffin. He was placed ahead of the heads of state in the procession, including King George V and eight other Kings, an act of which Kaiser Wilhelm II of the German Empire disapproved.\n\nWithin a month of the funeral an unofficial book was published, \"Where's Master?\", giving a first person account of Caesar from the king's death up to the funeral, something which made Queen Mary furious. The book was successful, running to nine reprints in the first year. After the King's death, a portrait of the dog was painted once more, this time by Maud Earl. The painting entitled \"Silent Sorrow\", features Caesar resting his head on the King's favourite chair. The Steiff company produced stuffed toys based on Caesar around 1910.\n\nHe remained in the Royal household after the death of the king, although Alice Keppel, long-time mistress to the King, had enquired of Queen Alexandria about what was to happen to Caesar. Despite her previous dislike of the dog, the Queen took interest in the terrier's care and tended to spoil him with treats, confessing to a friend that she was making up for the King being so strict towards him. Caesar died following an operation in April 1914. The Fabergé figurine now forms part of the Royal Collection, while Caesar was included in the sculptor of the King and Queen atop their tomb in St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle. In the sculpture, Caesar lies at the feet of the king.\n\n"}

He next joined Haverly's United Mastodon Minstrels as manager, touring the U.S. and Europe. Then for a time he was associated with his brothers Daniel and Gustave in managing the Madison Square Theatre, New York. He began to produce plays by 1886.\n\nFrohman's first success as a producer was with Bronson Howard's play \"Shenandoah\" (1889). Frohman founded the Empire Theatre Stock Company to acquire his first Broadway theatre, the Empire, in 1892. The following year, he produced his first Broadway play, Clyde Fitch's \"Masked Ball\". In this piece, Maude Adams first played opposite John Drew, which led to many future successes. Soon Frohman acquired five other New York City theaters, including the Garrick and Criterion Theatres. Working with William Harris and Isaac B. Rich, he became part owner of their theatres in Boston (the Columbia Theatre, Park, Hollis Street, Colonial, Boston and Tremont). In 1895, he produced the New York premiere of \"The Importance of Being Earnest\", by Oscar Wilde. The same year, he produced \"The Shop Girl\".\n\nFrohman was known for his ability to develop talent. His stars included William Gillette, John Drew, Jr., Ethel Barrymore, Billie Burke, E. H. Sothern, Julia Marlowe, Maude Adams, Paul Gilmore, Evelyn Millard, Henry Miller and Walter E. Perkins. In 1896, Frohman, Al Hayman, Abe Erlanger, Mark Klaw, Samuel F. Nixon, and Fred Zimmerman formed the Theatrical Syndicate. Their organization established systemized booking networks throughout the United States and created a monopoly that controlled every aspect of contracts and bookings until the late 1910s, when the Shubert brothers broke their stranglehold on the industry.\n\nIn 1897, Frohman leased the Duke of York's Theatre in London, introducing plays there as well as in the United States. Clyde Fitch, J. M. Barrie and Edmond Rostand were among the playwrights he promoted. As a producer, among Frohman's most famous successes was Barrie's \"Peter Pan, or The Boy Who Wouldn't Grow Up\", which he premiered at the Duke of York's in December 1904 starring Nina Boucicault, and produced in January 1905 in the U.S. starring Maude Adams. In the early years of the 20th century, Frohman also established a successful partnership with English actor-producer Seymour Hicks to produce musicals and other comedies in London, including \"Quality Street\" in 1902, \"The Admirable Crichton\" in 1903, \"The Catch of the Season\" in 1904, \"The Beauty of Bath\" in 1906, \"The Gay Gordons\" in 1907, and \"A Waltz Dream\" in 1908, among others. He also partnered with other London theatre managers. The system of exchange of successful plays between London and New York was effected largely as a result of his efforts. In 1910, Frohman attempted a repertory scheme of producing plays at the Duke of York's. He advertised a bill of plays by J. M. Barrie, John Galsworthy, Harley Granville Barker, and others. The venture began tentatively, and while it may have proved successful, Frohman canceled the scheme when London theatres closed at the death of King Edward VII in May 1910.\n\nOther Frohman hits included \"The Dollar Princess\" (1909), \"The Arcadians\" (1910), \"The Sunshine Girl\" (1913) and \"The Girl From Utah\" (1914). By 1915, Frohman had produced more than 700 shows, employed an average of 10,000 people per season, 700 of them actors, and paid salaries totaling $35 million a year (the equivalent of more than $700 million in 2010 dollars). Frohman controlled five theaters in London, six in New York City, and over two hundred throughout the rest of the United States. His longtime live-in companion, theatre critic Charles Dillingham (1868–1934), also became a well-known producer.\n\nFrohman made his annual trip to Europe in May 1915 to oversee his London and Paris \"play markets\", sailing on the Cunard Line's RMS \"Lusitania\". Songwriter Jerome Kern was meant to accompany him on the voyage, but overslept after being kept up late playing requests at a party. William Gillette was also to have accompanied him, but was forced to fulfill a contracted appearance in Philadelphia.\n\nFrohman's rheumatic knee, from a fall three years earlier, had been ailing for most of the voyage, but he was feeling better on the morning of May 7, a bright, sunny day. He entertained guests in his suite and later at his table. He was regaling them with tales of his life in the theater when, at 2:10 in the afternoon, within fourteen miles of the Old Head of Kinsale, with the coast of Ireland in sight, a torpedo from the German U-boat \"U-20\" struck the \"Lusitania\" on the starboard side. Within a minute, there was a second explosion, followed by several smaller ones.\n\nAs passengers began to panic, Frohman stood on the promenade deck, chatting with friends and smoking a cigar. He calmly remarked, \"This is going to be a close call.\" Frohman, with a disabled leg and walking with a cane, could not have jumped from the deck into a lifeboat, so he was trapped. Instead, he and millionaire Alfred Vanderbilt tied lifejackets to \"Moses baskets\" containing infants who had been asleep in the nursery when the torpedo struck. Frohman then went out onto the deck, where he was joined by actress Rita Jolivet, her brother-in-law George Vernon and Captain Alick Scott. In the final moments, they clasped hands and Frohman paraphrased his greatest hit, \"Peter Pan\": \"Why fear death? It is the most beautiful adventure that life gives us.\" Jolivet, the only survivor of Frohman's party, was standing with Frohman as the ship sank. She later said, \"with a tremendous roar a great wave swept along the deck. We were all divided in a moment, and I have not seen any of those brave men alive since.\"\n\nFrohman died a month and a week short of his fifty-ninth birthday. His body was later washed ashore below the Old Head of Kinsale, and it was later determined that he was killed by a heavy object falling on him, rather than by drowning. His body lay among 147 others awaiting identification, where a rescued American identified it from newspaper photographs. His body, alone among all the others, was not disfigured. His funeral service was held on May 25 at the Temple Emanu-El in New York City, and he was buried in the Union Field Cemetery in Ridgewood, Queens, New York. Services were also arranged by some of his stars in other American cities: by Maude Adams in Los Angeles, by John Drew in San Francisco, by Billie Burke in Tacoma, and by Donald Brian, Joseph Cawthorn and Julia Sanderson in Providence, as well as memorial services at both St Paul's Cathedral and the Church of St Martin-in-the-Fields in London. Frohman was also eulogized by the French Academy of Authors in Paris.\n\nA memorial to Frohman is located on The Causeway at Marlow on Thames. The site features a fountain with a sculptured nymph and inscription.\n\nFrohman was portrayed by Harry Hayden in the film \"Till the Clouds Roll By\" in 1946. He was played by William Hootkins in the BBC mini-series \"The Lost Boys\" in 1978. He was portrayed by Nehemiah Persoff in \"Ziegfeld: The Man & His Women\" also in 1978 on television. In the 1980 film \"Somewhere in Time\", the character William Fawcett Robinson, played by Christopher Plummer, was based on Frohman. In 2004, Dustin Hoffman portrayed him in the film \"Finding Neverland\", while Kelsey Grammer played him in the musical of the same name on Broadway in 2015.\n\n\n\n"}

The classical limit is used with physical theories that predict non-classical behavior.\n\nA heuristic postulate called the correspondence principle was introduced to quantum theory by Niels Bohr: in effect it states that some kind of continuity argument should apply to the classical limit of quantum systems as the value of Planck's constant normalized by the action of these systems becomes very small. Often, this is approached through \"quasi-classical\" techniques (cf. WKB approximation).\n\nMore rigorously, the mathematical operation involved in classical limits is a group contraction, approximating physical systems where the relevant action is much larger than Planck's constant , so the \"deformation parameter\" / can be effectively taken to be zero (cf. Weyl quantization.) Thus typically, quantum commutators (equivalently, Moyal brackets) reduce to Poisson brackets, in a group contraction.\n\nIn quantum mechanics, due to Heisenberg's uncertainty principle, an electron can never be at rest; it must always have a non-zero kinetic energy, a result not found in classical mechanics. For example, if we consider something very large relative to an electron, like a baseball, the uncertainty principle predicts that it cannot really have zero kinetic energy, but the uncertainty in kinetic energy is so small that the baseball can effectively appear to be at rest, and hence it appears to obey classical mechanics. In general, if large energies and large objects (relative to the size and energy levels of an electron) are considered in quantum mechanics, the result will appear to obey classical mechanics. The typical occupation numbers involved are huge: a macroscopic harmonic oscillator with  = 2 Hz,  = 10 g, and maximum amplitude  = 10 cm, has  = , so that  ≃ 10. Further see coherent states. It is less clear, however, how the classical limit applies to chaotic systems, a field known as quantum chaos.\n\nQuantum mechanics and classical mechanics are usually treated with entirely different formalisms: quantum theory using Hilbert space, and classical mechanics using a representation in phase space. One can bring the two into a common mathematical framework in various ways. In the phase space formulation of quantum mechanics, which is statistical in nature, logical connections between quantum mechanics and classical statistical mechanics are made, enabling natural comparisons between them.\n\nIn a crucial paper (1933), Dirac explained how classical mechanics is an emergent phenomenon of quantum mechanics: destructive interference among paths with non-extremal macroscopic actions  »  obliterate amplitude contributions in the path integral he introduced, leaving the extremal action , thus the classical action path as the dominant contribution, an observation further elaborated by Feynman in his 1942 PhD dissertation. (Further see quantum decoherence.)\n\nOne simple way to compare classical to quantum mechanics is to consider the time-evolution of the \"expected\" position and \"expected\" momentum, which can then be compared to the time-evolution of the ordinary position and momentum in classical mechanics. The quantum expectation values satisfy the Ehrenfest theorem. For a one-dimensional quantum particle moving in a potential formula_1, the Ehrenfest theorem says\nAlthough the first of these equations is consistent with the classical mechanics, the second is not: If the pair formula_3 were to satisfy Newton's second law, the right-hand side of the second equation would have read\nBut in most cases,\nIf for example, the potential formula_1 is cubic, then formula_7 is quadratic, in which case, we are talking about the distinction between formula_8 and formula_9, which differ by formula_10.\n\nAn exception occurs in case when the classical equations of motion are linear, that is, when formula_1 is quadratic and formula_7 is linear. In that special case, formula_13 and formula_14 do agree. In particular, for a free particle or a quantum harmonic oscillator, the expected position and expected momentum exactly follows solutions of Newton's equations.\n\nFor general systems, the best we can hope for is that the expected position and momentum will \"approximately\" follow the classical trajectories. If the wave function is highly concentrated around a point formula_15, then formula_13 and formula_14 will be \"almost\" the same, since both will be approximately equal to formula_18. In that case, the expected position and expected momentum will remain very close to the classical trajectories, at least \"for as long as\" the wave function remains highly localized in position. \n\nNow, if the initial state is very localized in position, it will be very spread out in momentum, and thus we expect that the wave function will rapidly spread out, and the connection with the classical trajectories will be lost. When Planck's constant is small, however, it is possible to have a state that is well localized in \"both\" position and momentum. The small uncertainty in momentum ensures that the particle \"remains\" well localized in position for a long time, so that expected position and momentum continue to closely track the classical trajectories for a long time.\n\nOther familiar deformations in physics involve:\n\n\n"}

Seurat's tours across Europe aroused controversy and because of the publicity, there was extensive interest in his life, particularly from the medical establishment. An account, for instance, cited that Seurat was born healthy and was normal like other children except for his depressed chest. By age 14, his health dwindled so that his frame already became skeletal in form. When he visited London for a tour in 1825, Seurat was described having normal height, being between and , but with an emaciated body; at the time, he weighed .

A series of surgeries at a young age complicated this, leaving him blind in his right eye, and weakened in his left. Counts was initially located in Austin, Texas.\n\nIn the 1990s, Counts became notorious with his prank phone calls to the Austin Community Access Center, in particular Alex Jones's show. An incident occurred - though with varying claims from both sides - in which Counts was involved in the assault of Jones in a parking lot with three other individuals. As a follow-up, it was claimed that Jones used FBI connections to label Counts a terrorist and claimed he possessed child pornography. Federal agents raided the FringeWare Review bookstore, headquarters of an early cyberculture magazine that Counts wrote articles for. The case was later dropped.\n\nIn 2000, Counts relocated to Chicago. Whilst there, he met Neil Keener, who would later join Counts in the band Bull of Heaven.\n\nIn the 2000s, Counts worked as a DJ to afford a living. He worked at various clubs, including Lava, Whiskey Sky, Reserve, Darkroom, the Allstate Arena, as well as performing at private functions. In July 2005, Counts was again involved in an incident - this time the alleged battery of a bouncer at the Lava club. Much like the Alex Jones incident in 2000, there are two sides to this story; Counts claims that he was told the set he was playing was \"too loud\" by club owner Brian Sarpalius (aka Phantom 45), who then subsequently interfered with and eventually unplugged Counts' equipment prior to having him removed by a bouncer. Sarpalius claims that it was actually Counts who caused a scene, and damaged the club's equipment. Counts allegedly discharged a can of mace at the bouncer's feet as a warning shot, though the stories of this differ from both sides. Later in the night, Counts was arrested, and his equipment was lost for several days whilst it was in possession of another club-goer the night of the incident. Counts had been DJing at the Lava club for four years prior to Sarpalius becoming the new owner, and this incident ending his shows there. The charges against Counts were dropped after a lengthy court case.\n\nIn September 2006, Counts gained notoriety when he created a mash-up of The Beach Boys' \"Pet Sounds\" with The Beatles' \"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\", aptly titled \"Sgt. Petsound's Lonely Hearts Club Band\" and credited to the band The Beachles. The mash-up album was created in conjunction with the 40th anniversary of Pet Sounds, and was favoured by various sites. This popularity reached EMI, who in turn issued Counts a cease and desist notice, demanded the IP addresses of everyone who downloaded it through his blog, and attempted to sue him for upwards of $30 mil. However, upon deletion of the album, the case was dropped.\n\nIn December, Counts' site announced his death, which was later revealed to be a hoax.\n\nIn 2008, Counts along with Neil Keener founded the band Bull of Heaven. Their first piece, \"001: Weed Problem\", was released on January 30, 2008. Since then, the band has released more than 300 numbered pieces, a second set of 100 pieces numbered in Roman numerals, many pieces of notable length, as well as a variety of untitled tracks, sound puzzles, and anti-music. On 21 January 2009, Counts was featured as the cover of the Denver Post's arts section, performing a solo piano composition. In 2012, the band's site suffered some downtime, and has been going through various issues since. In July, they announced that a \"Series 2\" of music would be coming. In 2013, the band announced that new material was nearing completion, and have since added new pieces to their Facebook page and Internet Archive collection. As of 2014, the band are still releasing music regularly with Counts giving an interview in February to Vice in the Netherlands and the band performing at the Lemp Neighborhood Arts Center in St. Louis.\n\n\n\"See Bull of Heaven discography for concise discography of Bull of Heaven.\"\n\n\n\n"}

Eleven mathematicians and scientists were originally planned to be attendees, and while not all attended, more than ten others came for short times.\n\nIn the early 1950s, there were various names for the field of \"thinking machines\" such as cybernetics, automata theory, and complex information processing. These indicate how different the ideas were on what such machines would be like.\n\nIn 1955 John McCarthy, then a young Assistant Professor of Mathematics at Dartmouth College, decided to organize a group to clarify and develop ideas about thinking machines. He picked the name 'Artificial Intelligence' for the new field. He chose the name partly for its neutrality; avoiding a focus on narrow automata theory, and avoiding cybernetics which was heavily focused on analog feedback, as well as him potentially having to accept the assertive Norbert Wiener as guru or having to argue with him.\n\nIn early 1955, McCarthy approached the Rockefeller Foundation to request funding for a summer seminar at Dartmouth for about 10 participants. In June, he and Claude Shannon, a founder of Information Theory then at Bell Labs, met with Robert Morison, Director of Biological and Medical Research to discuss the idea and possible funding, though Morison, was unsure whether money would be made available for such a visionary project.\n\nOn September 2, 1955, the project was formally proposed by McCarthy, Marvin Minsky, Nathaniel Rochester and Claude Shannon. The proposal is credited with introducing the term 'artificial intelligence'.\n\nThe Proposal states\n\nThe proposal goes on to discuss computers, natural language processing, neural networks, theory of computation, abstraction and creativity (these areas within the field of artificial intelligence are considered still relevant to the work of the field). \nOn May 26, 1956, McCarthy notified Robert Morison of the planned 11 attendees:\n\nFor the full period:\n\nFor four weeks:\n\nFor the first two weeks:\n\nHe noted, \"we will concentrate on a problem of devising a way of programming a calculator to form concepts and to form generalizations. This of course is subject to change when the group gets together.\"\n\nAccording to Stottler Henke Associates, besides the proposal's authors, attendees at the conference included Ray Solomonoff, Oliver Selfridge, Trenchard More, Arthur Samuel, Herbert A. Simon, and Allen Newell.\n\nThe actual participants came at different times, mostly for much shorter times. Trenchard More replaced Rochester for three weeks and MacKay and Holland did not attend --- but the project was set to begin. \nAround June 18, 1956, the earliest participants (perhaps only Ray Solomonoff, maybe with Tom Etter) arrived at the Dartmouth campus in Hanover, N.H., to join John McCarthy who already had an apartment there. Ray and Marvin stayed at Professors' apartments, but most would stay at the Hanover Inn.\n\nThe Dartmouth Workshop is said to have run for six weeks in the summer of 1956. Ray Solomonoff's notes written during the Workshop, however, say it ran for roughly eight weeks, from about June 18 to August 17.\nSolomonoff's Dartmouth notes start on June 22; June 28 mentions Minsky, June 30 mentions Hanover, N.H., July 1 mentions Tom Etter. On August 17, Ray gave a final talk.\n\nInitially, McCarthy lost his list of attendees. Instead, after the workshop, McCarthy sent Ray a preliminary list of participants and visitors plus those interested in the subject. There were 47 people listed.\n\nSolomonoff, however, made a complete list in his notes of the summer project:\n\n\nShannon attended Ray's talk on July 10 and Bigelow gave a talk on August 15. Ray doesn't mention Bernard Widrow, but apparently he visited, along with W.A. Clark and B.G. Farley. Trenchard mentions R. Culver and Ray mentions Bill Shutz. Herb Gelernter didn't attend, but was influenced later by what Rochester learned. Gloria Minsky also commuted there (with their part-beagle dog, Senje, who would start out in the car back seat and end up curled around her like a scarf), and attended some sessions (without Senje).\n\nRay Solomonoff, Marvin Minsky, and John McCarthy were the only three who stayed for the full-time. Trenchard took attendance during two weeks of his three-week visit. From three to about eight people would attend the daily sessions.\n\nThey had the entire top floor of the Dartmouth Math Department to themselves, and most weekdays they would meet at the main math classroom where someone might lead a discussion focusing on his/her ideas, or more frequently, a general discussion would be held.\n\nIt was not a directed group research project, discussions covered many topics but several directions are considered to have been initiated or encouraged by the Workshop: the rise of symbolic methods, systems focussed on limited domains (early Expert Systems), and deductive systems versus inductive systems. One participant, Arthur Samuel said, \"It was very interesting, very stimulating, very exciting\".\n\nRay Solomonoff kept notes giving his impression of the talks and the ideas from various discussions.\n\n\n"}

It would be composed of two elements: an Orion capsule and a propelled habitation module. As of April 2018, the DST is still a concept to be studied, and NASA has not officially proposed the project in an annual U.S. federal government budget cycle.\n\nThe DST vehicle would depart and return from the Lunar Orbital Platform-Gateway (LOP-G) to be serviced and reused for a new Mars mission.\n\nBoth the Gateway and the DST would be fitted with the International Docking System Standard. The DST spacecraft would comprise two elements: an Orion capsule and a habitation module that would be propelled by both electric propulsion and chemical propulsion, and carry a crew of four in a medium-sized habitat. The fully assembled spacecraft with the Orion capsule mated, would have a mass of about 100 metric tones. The spacecraft's habitat portion will likely be fabricated using tooling and structures developed for the SLS propellant tank; it would be in diameter and in length.\n\nThe habitat portion of the DST spacecraft may also be equipped with a laboratory with research instrumentation for physical sciences, electron microscopy, chemical analyses, freezers, medical research, small live animal quarters, plant growth chambers, and 3-D printing. External payloads might include cameras, telescopes, detectors, and a robotic arm.\n\nWhen performing a lunar flyby for increased velocity, the initial target for exploration is Mars (flyby or orbit), and other suggested destinations are Venus (flyby or orbit), and a sample return from a large asteroid. If the DST spacecraft was to orbit Mars, it would enable opportunities for real-time remote operation of equipment on the Martian surface, such as a human-assisted Mars sample return. Patrick Troutman serves as the lead for strategic assessments for the Deep Space Transport and the Lunar Orbital Platform-Gateway.\n\nIf funded, the DST would be launched toward the Lunar Gateway in one SLS cargo flight, probably in 2027. The spacecraft is expected to undergo 100-300 days of DST Habitat crewed operation before it starts a one-year long flight test (shakedown cruise) in cislunar space in 2029. It is expected to start a crewed mission to orbit Mars, but not land, in 2033. Its first mission would likely involve a Venus flyby and a short stay around Mars. Additional developments and vehicles would be required for a Mars human surface mission.\n\n\n"}

He proposes and they marry (portrayed in something resembling a ‘dream’ sequence), honeymoon, and are immediately pressured by family to have children. Nathalie takes a new job, hired partially because her new boss is sexually interested in her. One day, François goes out to jog and is killed in a traffic accident. Nathalie is devastated.\n\nAfter wallowing in pity from the tragedy for several days, she collects most of François' stuff (reminders of him) in their apartment and tosses it into the garbage. Her friends and family are very concerned about her. She eventually returns to work, exciting her (married) boss as to her new ‘availability’. Time passes. On the job for three years and focusing solely on her work, she has gone without any other romantic relationship. One evening her boss takes her to dinner to celebrate getting a big contract and he hits on her. She is not attracted to him, and tells him so, but that they can still respect each other and work together.\n\nOne day at work, Markus, a subordinate on her work-team (unseen until now) enters her office to discuss a case, and she, in a trance-like state, just walks up to him and passionately kisses him. He is pleasantly stunned, and later leaves work confident and happy, passing several beautiful women in the street as they (in his mind) ‘ogle’ him. That night, he thinks about what happened and tries to imagine what Nathalie is doing.\n\nHis confusion about this incident is because he is a native Swede (who has worked in France the past 15 years, with his parents living nearby), balding, an average looking guy, maybe 40 years old, and cannot possibly imagine why someone like Nathalie would be interested in someone like him.\n\nThe next day at work he asks Nathalie why she kissed him, and she seems to not remember. She tells him she must have been ‘elsewhere’ and to forget it. He tells her he cannot. She says her behavior was inappropriate and that she was daydreaming, and he leaves her office. She tells her friend about the exchange. The first thing her friend asks her is \"Is he hot?\"\n\nThe next day at 5 pm at work Markus goes to see Nathalie and kisses her; she is surprised, but then enjoys kissing him, as they embrace. He leaves, and she goes to find him. They talk and agree to go to dinner. They seem to connect well. Markus still cannot believe this is happening.\n\nThey go to a play together a few nights later. As he walks her home, he realizes he is falling in love, and tells her that, and that it’s \"ridiculous\" and he doesn't want to get hurt, then runs away, leaving Nathalie puzzled.\n\nThe next day at work Markus purposely ignores her, to her annoyance. Nathalie lets slip to her assistant that they went to see that play, and office gossip about them being a ‘couple’ soon spreads. Nathalie goes to find Markus and tells him she enjoyed being together, but he still ignores her. Later that day, at an office birthday party for the assistant, Nathalie confronts Markus about his attitude in front of everyone, leading to further gossip. They reconcile, and he gives her a particularly sentimental gift. Later, Nathalie goes home to her father and cries.\n\nNathalie and Markus go on another date, where a guy openly hits on Nathalie, not believing she would be with a guy like Markus, and Markus and he fight. The next day at work, her boss asks about her new relationship, hinting at his disapproval, and infuriating her. The boss then calls Markus into his office to talk to him; they later have dinner, so the boss can figure out what Nathalie sees in Markus, discovering he is just a nice guy and a ‘poetic’ thinker. Markus puts the drunken boss into a cab, then goes to meet up with Nathalie at her friend's home, where there is a small party occurring. Nathalie is happy to see him and to introduce him to her 'crowd', but they, all ‘attractive people’, cannot see what she sees in him, either. Markus is very uncomfortable at this, and Nathalie senses that, so they leave and go home to her place, where they just fall asleep in separate chairs, holding hands. At breakfast they talk about the \"relationship\" they are not having, which everyone else thinks they are in, and her annoying boss.\n\nAt work she confronts her boss about his meeting with Markus. Her boss calls Markus an \"ugly, insignificant guy\", and she tells him off. After further insulting words are put forth, including a comment about her ‘unfaithfulness’ to her deceased husband, Nathalie walks out, ignoring a major project meeting. She drives to the countryside where she grew up and where François was from too, even though they did not know each other then. Nathalie phones and then picks up Markus in a small town, and takes him to the cemetery where François is buried, but it is locked.

Their traditional common English name \"elephant shrew\" comes from a fancied resemblance between their long noses and the trunk of an elephant, and their superficial similarity with shrews (family Soricidae) in the order Eulipotyphla. However, phylogenetic analysis revealed that elephant shrews are not classified with true shrews, but are in fact more closely related to elephants than shrews. In 1997 the biologist Jonathan Kingdon proposed that they instead be called \"sengis\" (singular \"sengi\"), a term derived from the Bantu languages of Africa, and in 1998 they were classified into the new clade Afrotheria.\n\nThey are widely distributed across the southern part of Africa, and although common nowhere, can be found in almost any type of habitat, from the Namib Desert to boulder-strewn outcrops in South Africa to thick forest. One species, the North African elephant shrew, remains in the semiarid, mountainous country in the far northwest of the continent.\n\nThe creature is one of the fastest small mammals, having been recorded to reach speeds of .\n\nElephant shrews are small, quadrupedal, insectivorous mammals resembling rodents or opossums, with scaly tails, elongated snouts, and rather long legs for their size, which are used to move in a hopping fashion like rabbits. They vary in size from about , from . The short-eared elephant shrew has an average size of . Although the size of the trunk varies among species, all are able to twist it about in search of food. Their lifespans are about two and a half to four years in the wild. They have large canine teeth, and also high-crowned cheek teeth similar to those of ungulates. Their dental formula is \n\nAlthough mostly diurnal and very active, they are difficult to trap and very seldom seen; elephant shrews are wary, well camouflaged, and adept at dashing away from threats. Several species make a series of cleared pathways through the undergrowth and spend their day patrolling them for insect life. If the animal is disturbed, the pathway provides an obstacle-free escape route.\n\nElephant shrews are not highly social animals, but many live in monogamous pairs, which share and defend their home territory, marked using scent glands. \"Rhynchocyon\" species also dig small conical holes in the soil, bandicoot-style, but others may make use of natural crevices, or make leaf nests.\n\nShort-eared elephant shrews inhabit the dry steppes and stone deserts of southwestern Africa. They can even be found in the Namib Desert, one of the driest regions of the earth. Females drive away other females, while males try to ward off other males. Although they live in pairs, the partners do not care much for each other and their sole purpose of even associating with the opposite sex is for reproduction. Social behaviors are not very common and they even have separate nests. The one or two young are well developed at birth; they are able to run within a few hours.\nFemale elephant shrews undergo a menstrual cycle similar to that of human females and the species is one of the few nonprimate mammals to do so. The elephant shrew mating period lasts for several days. After mating, the pair will return to their solitary habits. After a gestation period varying from 45 to 60 days, the female will bear litters of one to three young several times a year. The young are born relatively well developed, but remain in the nest for several days before venturing outside.\n\nAfter five days, the young's milk diet is supplemented with mashed insects, which are collected and transported in the cheek pouches of the female. The young then slowly start to explore their environment and hunt for insects. After about 15 days, the young will begin the migratory phase of their lives, which lessens their dependency on their mother. The young will then establish their own home ranges (about ) and will become sexually active within 41–46 days.\n\nElephant shrews mainly eat insects, spiders, centipedes, millipedes, and earthworms. An elephant shrew uses its nose to find prey and uses its tongue to flick small food into its mouth, much like an anteater. Eating large prey can pose a challenge; an elephant shrew struggling with an earthworm must first pin its prey to the ground with a forefoot. Then, turning its head to one side, it chews pieces off with its cheek teeth, much like a dog chewing a bone. This is a sloppy process, and many small pieces of worm drop to the ground; these are simply flicked up with the tongue. Some elephant shrews also feed on small amounts of plant matter, especially new leaves, seeds, and small fruits.\n\nA number of fossil species are known, all from Africa. They were separate from the similar-appearing order Leptictida. A considerable diversification of macroscelids occurred in the Paleogene Era. Some, such as \"Myohyrax\", were so similar to hyraxes that they were initially included with that group, while others, such as \"Mylomygale\", were relatively rodent-like. These unusual forms all died out by the Pleistocene. Although macroscelids have been classified with many groups, often on the basis of superficial characteristics, considerable morphological and molecular evidence now indicates placing them within Afrotheria, probably close to the base of Paenungulata.\n\nIn the past, elephant shrews have been classified with the shrews and hedgehogs as part of the Insectivora; regarded as distant relatives of the ungulates; grouped with the treeshrews; and lumped in with the hares and rabbits in the Lagomorpha. Recent molecular evidence, however, strongly supports a superorder Afrotheria that unites elephant shrews with tenrecs and golden moles as well as certain mammals previously presumed to be ungulates, including hyraxes, sirenians, aardvarks and elephants.\n\nThe 19 species of elephant shrew are placed in five genera, two of which are monotypic:\n\n"}

P. Lovecraft for the Cthulhu Mythos. Lovecraft introduced the creatures in his 1936 novella \"The Shadow out of Time\". \"Flying polyp\" is a term of convenience, since Lovecraft never published a name for the creatures.\n\nThe flying polyps came to Earth from space as conquerors about seven hundred fifty million years ago. They also inhabited three other planets in the solar system, including possibly Yaksh (Neptune) and Tond (though Tond itself may lie outside the solar system, or may be possibly referring to Pluto, which was discovered only 6 years before the publication of the story). On Earth, they built basalt cities with high windowless towers. When they attempted to colonize the oceans, the polyps were driven back by the Elder Things. Thereafter, they restricted their habitats to the surface world. \nTheir senses did not include sight, but what senses they had could penetrate all material obstructions. They were only partially matter, but still solid enough to affect and be stopped by normal materials; this additionally gave them resistance, if not outright invulnerability, to normal means of damage, though they could be destroyed by certain forms of electrical energy. Their minds were so strange that the Great Race of Yith could not perform psychic transfers with them.\n\nThey are able to levitate and fly despite lacking any visible means of doing so, and leave telltale massive footprints when on the ground. Their amorphous bodies can turn invisible at will, though this ability appears somewhat negated by whistling noises associated with them in general. In battle, their ability to control and direct powerful winds is put to use as a weapon.\n\nWhen the Great Race of Yith came to Earth, they warred with the polyps and soon drove them underground with their advanced technology. The Great Race then sealed the entryways to the polyps' subterranean abode with trapdoors, which afterwards were diligently guarded. The polyps' cities were left abandoned, perhaps as a reminder of the horrors that dwelt below.\n\nEventually, the polyps rose up and almost exterminated the Great Race, afterwards returning to their subterranean haunts. Having no conception of light, the polyps seem content to remain there, annihilating the few intruders that chance upon them. The entrances to their dwellings are mostly deep within ancient ruins where there are great wells sealed over with stone. Inside these wells still dwell the polyps.\n\n\n"}

At a meeting in rural Maryland, he was covertly dosed with LSD by his CIA supervisor and, nine days later, plunged to his death from the window of a 13th-story New York City hotel room. The U.S. government first described his death as a suicide, and then as misadventure, while others allege murder. The Rockefeller Commission report on the CIA in 1975 acknowledged their having conducted drug studies.\n\nOlson was born in Hurley, Iron County, Wisconsin, and earned both B.S. and Ph.D. degrees (Bacteriology, 1938) at the University of Wisconsin. He married and had three children: Eric, Nils, and Lisa. Olson worked for a time at Purdue University in West Lafayette, Indiana, and then served as a captain in the U.S. Army Chemical Corps.\n\nAs a civilian, he was recruited to Camp Detrick, and to the U.S. Army Biological Warfare Laboratories, by the distinguished UW scientist Ira Baldwin, the technical director there. (Baldwin had been his departmental advisor at UW.) At Camp Detrick, Baldwin worked with industrial partners such as George W. Merck and the U.S. military to establish the top secret U.S. bioweapons program beginning in 1943, during World War II, a time when interest in applying modern technology to warfare was high. Olson's duties included experiments with aerosolized anthrax. There were allegations that the US used biological warfare during the Korean War but the government denied this. After 10 years, Olson was a senior bacteriologist at the program.\n\nAt some point while assigned as a civilian U.S. Army contractor, Olson began working as a CIA employee with the CIA's Technical Services Staff (TSS), run by Sidney Gottlieb and his deputy Robert Lashbrook. Some of his CIA colleagues were involved in the MKNAOMI-MKULTRA program, previously known as Project Artichoke and, earlier, Project Bluebird. It was a program to explore the possible espionage and military uses of psychotropic drugs.\n\nThe author Ed Regis reports that the meeting at which Olson was dosed with LSD took place at Deep Creek Lake, Maryland:\n\nOlson asked to quit the biowarfare program the week after the retreat:\n\nOlson subsequently suffered severe paranoia and a nervous breakdown. The CIA sent him to New York City to see one of their physicians, who recommended that Olson be placed into a mental institution for recovery. This was Harold Abramson, an allergist-pediatrician, who was helping the CIA with the psychotropic research into the effects of the drug.\n\nThe ensuing police report said that on his last night in Manhattan, Olson purposely threw himself out of the window of his tenth-floor hotel room at the Hotel Statler, which he had been sharing with Lashbrook, and died shortly after impact.\n\nAlthough Olson's family told friends that Olson had suffered \"a fatal nervous breakdown\" which resulted in the fall, the family had no knowledge of the specific details surrounding the tragedy until the Rockefeller Commission uncovered some of the CIA's MKULTRA activities in 1975. That year, the government admitted that Olson had been dosed with LSD, without his knowledge, nine days before his death. After the family announced they planned to sue the Agency over Olson's \"wrongful death,\" the government offered them an out-of-court settlement of $1,250,000, later reduced to $750,000, which they accepted. The family received apologies from President Gerald Ford and then-CIA director William Colby.\n\nIn 1994, Eric Olson had his father's body exhumed to be buried with his mother. The family decided to have a second autopsy performed. The 1953 medical report done immediately after Dr. Olson's death indicated that there were cuts and abrasions on the body. Theories sparked about Olson having been assassinated by the CIA. When the second autopsy was performed by James Starrs, Professor of Law and Forensic Science at the George Washington University National Law Center, his team searched the body for any cuts and abrasions and found none. Starrs found a large hematoma on the left side of Olson's head and a large injury on his chest. Most of the team concluded that the blunt-force trauma to the head and the injury to the chest had not occurred during the fall, but most likely in the room before the fall (one team member dissented). Starrs called the evidence \"rankly and starkly suggestive of homicide.\"\n\nIn 1996, Eric approached the U.S. District Attorney in Manhattan, Robert Morgenthau, to see if his office would open a new investigation. Stephen Saracco and Daniel Bibb of the office's \"cold case\" unit collected preliminary information, including a deposition of Lashbrook, but concluded that there was no compelling case to send to a grand jury. In 2001, Canadian historian and former politician Michael Ignatieff wrote an account of Eric's decades-long campaign to clear his father's name for \"The New York Times Magazine\".\n\nEric Olson said the forensic evidence of death is suggestive of a method used by the CIA found in the first manual of assassination that says \"The most efficient accident, in simple assassination, is a fall of 75 feet or more onto a hard surface.\"\n\nOn November 28, 2012, sons Eric and Nils Olson filed suit in the US District Court in Washington, D.C., seeking unspecified compensatory damages as well as access to documents related to their father's death and other matters that they claimed the CIA had withheld from them. The case was dismissed in July 2013, due in part to the 1976 settlement between the family and government. In the decision dismissing the suit, U.S. District Judge James Boasberg wrote, \"While the court must limit its analysis to the four corners of the complaint, the skeptical reader may wish to know that the public record supports many of the allegations [in the family's suit], farfetched as they may sound.\"\n\nNetflix released a documentary miniseries, entitled \"Wormwood\" (2017), based on the mystery of Olson's death; it was directed by Errol Morris. In the miniseries, journalist Seymour Hersh says the government had a security process to identify and execute domestic dissidents (perceived to pose a risk). He said that Frank Olson was a victim of this and an ongoing cover-up after his death. If this is correct, then the U.S. government in this case considered an accidental death as a result of illegal human experimentation to be an appropriate, effective, and less-damning cover story than the truth. However, Hersh explained that he cannot elaborate or publish on the facts because it would compromise his source.\n\n\n\n"}

He was one of the Four Chaplains who gave their lives to save other soldiers during the sinking of the troop transport during World War II.\n\nGeorge L. Fox was born in Lewistown, Pennsylvania in 1900, one of five children. At 17 he ran away to join the army and served on the Western Front during World War I as a medical orderly, receiving the Silver Star, the Purple Heart and the Croix de Guerre for his meritorious service. Following the war, Fox completed high school and briefly worked for a Trust Company. Fox married in 1923 and his son, Wyatt Ray was born a year later. Fox studied at Moody Bible Institute and Illinois Wesleyan University, graduating in 1931. Following graduation, Fox became an itinerant Methodist preacher, holding posts in Downs, Illinois and Rye, New Hampshire before joining the Boston University School of Theology and becoming an ordained minister in 1934.\n\nThat same year, he took over the church in Waits River, Vermont, and his daughter, Mary Elizabeth, was born. He remained in Vermont, moving church twice and becoming the state chaplain and historian for the American Legion. Fox joined the army again in 1942. His son enlisted in the Marine Corps on the same day. Fox was united with the other Four Chaplains for his voyage to Europe later that year following a position in the chaplain's school in Harvard, and departed with over 900 soldiers on the \"Dorchester\" in January 1943.\n\nIn late 1942, Fox was transferred to Camp Myles Standish in Taunton, Massachusetts and attended Chaplains School at Harvard University. There he met fellow chaplains Alexander D. Goode, Clark V. Poling and John P. Washington. In January 1943, the chaplains embarked on board a Navy transport ship, the SS Dorchester, which was carrying over 900 soldiers to the United Kingdom, via Greenland.\n\nOn February 2, 1943 the German submarine \"U-223\" spotted the convoy and fired a torpedo which struck the Dorchester shortly after midnight. Hundreds of men packed the decks of the rapidly sinking ship and scrambled for the lifeboats. Several of the lifeboats had been damaged and the four chaplains began to organize frightened soldiers. They distributed life jackets from a locker; when the supply of life jackets ran out, each of the chaplains gave theirs to other soldiers. When the last lifeboats were away, the chaplains prayed with those unable to escape the sinking ship. 27 minutes after the torpedo struck, the \"Dorchester\" disappeared below the waves with 672 men still aboard. The last anyone saw of the four chaplains, they were standing on the deck, arms linked and praying together.\n\nThe four chaplains were all awarded the Distinguished Service Cross and the Purple Heart and received national acclaim for their courage and self-sacrifice. A chapel in their honor was dedicated on February 3, 1951 by President Harry S. Truman at Grace Baptist Church of Philadelphia. The Four Chaplains' Medal was established by act of Congress on July 14, 1960, and was presented posthumously to their next of kin by Secretary of the Army Wilber M. Brucker at Ft. Myer, Virginia on January 18, 1961.\n\nFox is honored with a feast day along with the other Four Chaplains on the liturgical of the Episcopal Church in the United States of America on February 3.\n\n"}

After six bouts, he stopped boxing when he was offered a position training wrestlers at St. Matthew's Lyceum in his native Hastings-on-Hudson.\n\nStanislaus Zbyszko convinced Kulky to compete professionally in 1939. Moving to Argentina, Kulky competed throughout South America under the ring name Bomber Kulkavich. The number of matches in which he competed is uncertain; one claim states that he won 172 of 175 matches. Kulky, however, claims that he won nearly all of 7,000 matches. While in South America, he is also said to have won the continent's judo crown.\n\nLike most wrestlers who turned to acting in the 1950s he owed his big break to Mike Mazurki. The two appeared in several parts in the 1940s and 1950s, with Mazurki's agent getting him a part in \"Call Northside 777\".\n\nBecause of his rather tough guy image, Kulky became typecast as military men, thugs, gangsters, bartenders, wrestlers and other \"strong guys\" who were at times quite friendly and lovable characters contrasting strongly with the tough guy image. From 1953 to 1958, he played Otto Schmidlap in the television series, \"The Life of Riley\". In the series, Kulky portrayed a co-worker of series character Chester Riley, a wing riveter at an aircraft plant. In 1952 he appeared in an episode (#11) of Adventures of Superman, as a wrestler working for a crooked promoter. In 1954 he appeared in an episode (#141) of The Lone Ranger.

In other words, they exhibit characteristics of both poikilothermy and homeothermy.\n\nHeterothermic animals are those that can switch between poikilothermic and homeothermic strategies. These changes in strategies typically occur on a daily basis or on an annual basis. More often than not, it is used as a way to dissociate the fluctuating metabolic rates seen in some small mammals and birds (e.g. bats and hummingbirds), from those of traditional cold blooded animals. In many bat species, body temperature and metabolic rate are elevated only during activity. When at rest, these animals reduce their metabolisms drastically, which results in their body temperature dropping to that of the surrounding environment. This makes them homeothermic when active, and poikilothermic when at rest. This phenomenon has been termed 'daily torpor' and was intensively studied in the Djungarian hamster. During the hibernation season, this animal shows strongly reduced metabolism each day during the rest phase while they revert to endothermic metabolism during their active phase, leading to normal euthermic body temperatures (around 38 °C).\n\nLarger mammals (e.g. ground squirrels) and bats show multi-day torpor bouts during hibernation (up to several weeks) in winter. During these multi-day torpor bouts, body temperature drops to ~1 °C above ambient temperature and metabolism may drop to about 1% of the normal endothermic metabolic rate. Even in these deep hibernators, the long periods of torpor is interrupted by bouts of endothermic metabolism, called arousals (typically lasting between 4–20 hours). These metabolic arousals cause body temperature to return to euthermic levels 35-37 °C. Most of the energy spent during hibernation is spent in arousals (70-80%), but their function remains unresolved.\n\nShallow hibernation patterns without arousals have been described in large mammals (like the black bear,) or under special environmental circumstances.\n\nRegional heterothermy describes organisms that are able to maintain different temperature \"zones\" in different regions of the body. This usually occurs in the limbs, and is made possible through the use of counter-current heat exchangers, such as the rete mirabile found in tuna and certain birds. These exchangers equalize the temperature between hot arterial blood going out to the extremities and cold venous blood coming back, thus reducing heat loss. Penguins and many arctic birds use these exchangers to keep their feet at roughly the same temperature as the surrounding ice. This keeps the birds from getting stuck on an ice sheet. Other animals, like the Leatherback Sea Turtle, use the heat exchangers to gather, and retain heat generated by their muscular flippers. There are even some insects which possess this mechanism (see insect thermoregulation), the best-known example being bumblebees, which exhibit counter-current heat exchange at the point of constriction between the mesosoma (\"thorax\") and metasoma (\"abdomen\"); heat is retained in the thorax and lost from the abdomen. Using a very similar mechanism, the internal temperature of a honeybee's thorax can exceed 45 °C while in flight.\n\n\n"}

It can be an oogonium, an oocyte, or an ootid. An oocyte, in turn, can be either primary or secondary, depending on how far it has come in its process of meiosis.\n\nOogonia are the cells that turn into primary oocytes in oogenesis. They are diploid, i.e. containing both pairs of homologous chromosomes. There are 23 chromosome pairs. Thus, there are 46 chromosomes. Each chromosome, however, hasn't yet duplicated itself. As such, there is only one chromatid on each chromosome, making the total quantity of chromatids 46. This is twice the number of chromosome pairs (2N).\n\nOogonia are created in early embryonic life. All have turned into primary oocytes at late fetal age.\n\nThe primary oocyte is defined by its process of ootidogenesis, which is meiosis. It has duplicated its DNA, so that each chromosome has two chromatids, i.e. 92 chromatids all in all (4C).\n\nWhen meiosis I is completed, one secondary oocyte and one polar body is created.\n\nPrimary oocytes have been created in late fetal life. This is the stage where immature ova spend most of their lifetime, more specifically in prophase I of meiosis. The halt is called dictyate. Most degenerate by atresia, but a few go through ovulation, and that's the trigger to the next step. Thus, an immature ovum can spend up to ~55 years as a primary oocyte (the last ovulation before menopause).\n\nThe secondary oocyte is the cell that is formed by meiosis I in oogenesis. Thus, it has only one of each pair of homologous chromosomes. In other words, it is haploid. However, each chromosome still has two chromatids, making a total of 46 chromatids (1N but 2C). The secondary oocyte continues the second stage of meiosis (meiosis II), and the daughter cells are one ootid and one polar body.\n\nSecondary oocytes are the immature ovum shortly after ovulation, to fertilization, where it turns into an ootid. Thus, the time as a secondary oocyte is measured in days.\n\nThe secondary oocyte is the largest cell in the body, and in humans is just visible to the naked eye.\n\nAn \"ootid\" is the haploid result of ootidogenesis. In oogenesis, it doesn't really have any significance in itself, since it is very similar to the ovum. However, it fills the purpose as the female counterpart of the male spermatid in spermatogenesis.\n\nEach chromosome is split between the two ootids, leaving only one chromatid per chromosome. Thus, there are 23 chromatids in total (1N).\n\nIn other words, the ootid is the immature ovum formed shortly after fertilization, but before complete maturation into an ovum. Thus, the time spent as an ootid is measured in minutes.\n\nThe ootid matures into an ovum.\n"}

Some reports of \"jauhar\" mention women committing self-immolation along with their children. This practice was historically observed in northwest regions of India, with most famous Jauhars in recorded history occurring during wars between Hindu Rajput kingdoms in Rajasthan and the Muslim armies. \"Jauhar\" is related to \"sati\", and sometimes referred in scholarly literature as \"jauhar sati\".\n\nAccording to Veena Oldenburg, the roots of this practice \"almost certainly\" lie in the internecine warfare among different Rajput kingdoms. In contrast, Kaushik Roy said that the \"jauhar\" custom was observed only during Hindu-Muslim wars, but not during internecine Hindu-Hindu wars among the Rajputs.\n\nThe term \"jauhar\" sometimes connotes with both \"jauhar\"-immolation and \"saka\" ritual. During the Jauhar, Rajput women committed suicide with their children and valuables in massive fire, to avoid capture and abuse in the face of inescapable military defeat and capture. Simultaneously or thereafter, the men would ritually march to the battlefield expecting certain death, which in the regional tradition is called \"saka\".\n\n\"Jauhar\" by Hindu kingdoms has been documented by Islamic historians of the Delhi Sultanate, and the Mughal Empire. Among the oft cited example of \"jauhar\" has been the mass suicide committed in 1303 CE by the women of Chittorgarh fort in Rajasthan, faced with invading army of Khalji dynasty of the Delhi Sultanate. The \"jauhar\" phenomenon was also observed in other parts of India, such as in the Kampili kingdom of northern Karnataka when it fell in 1327 to Delhi Sultanate armies.\n\nThe word \"jauhar\" is connected to Sanskrit \"jatugr̥ha\" \"house plastered with lac and other combustible materials for burning people alive in\".\n\nThe practice of Jauhar is culturally related to \"Sati\" with both a form of suicide by women, although it occurred for different reasons. Sati was the custom of a widow to commit suicide by self-immolation on her husband's funeral pyre, while Jauhar was collective self-immolation by women to escape abuse and rape and slavery, when they expected certain defeat at the hands of enemy.\n\nScholars disagree about the roots of this custom. Veena Oldenburg states that the roots of this practice \"almost certainly\" lie in the internecine Rajput warfare. Kaushik Roy states, in contrast, that the \"jauhar\" custom was observed only during Hindu-Muslim wars, but not during internecine Hindu-Hindu wars among the Rajputs.\n\nThe phenomenon of \"jauhar\" has been reported by Hindus and Muslims differently. In the Hindu traditions, \"jauhar\" was a heroic act by a community facing certain defeat and abuse by the enemy. For some Muslim historians, it was unwilling and a throwing away of lives. But Amir Khusrau described it, states Arvind Sharma – a professor of Comparative Religion, as \"no doubt magical and superstitious; nevertheless they are heroic\".\n\nAmong the more cited cases of Jauhar are the three occurrences at the fort of Chittaur (Chittaurgarh, Chittorgarh), in Rajasthan, in 1303, 1535, and 1568 CE. Jaisalmer has witnessed two occurrences of Jauhar, one in the year 1295 CE during the reign of the Khalji dynasty, and another during the reign of the Tughlaq dynasty in 1326. Jauhar and Saka were considered heroic acts and the practice was glorified in the local ballads and folklore of Rajasthan.\n\nThe mass self-immolation by the Agalassoi tribe of northwest India is mentioned in Book 6 of \"The Anabasis of Alexander\", Arrian's 2nd-century CE military history of Alexander the Great between 336 and 323 BCE. Arrian mentions Alexander's army conquering and enslaving peoples of the northwest Indian subcontinent. During a war that killed many in the Macedonian and Agalossoi armies, the civilians despaired of defeat. Some 20,000 men, women and children of an Agalossoi town set fire to the town and cast themselves into the flames.\n\nIn 712, Muhammed bin Qasim with his army attacked kingdoms of western regions of the Indian subcontinent. He laid siege to the capital of Dahir, then the Hindu king in a part of Sind. After Dahir had been killed, the queen coordinated the defense of the capital for several months. As the food supplies ran out, she and the women of the capital refused to surrender, lit pyres and committed \"jauhar\". The remaining men walked out to their death at the hands of the invading army.\n\nShams ud-Din Iltutmish of the Delhi Sultanate attacked Gwalior in 1232, then under control of the Rajputs. The Rajput women committed jauhar instead of submitting to Iltutmish's army. The place where the women committed mass suicide is known as Jauhar-tal (or Johar kund, Jauhar Tank) in the northern end of the Gwalior fort.\n\nIn 1301, Alauddin Khalji of Delhi Sultanate besieged and conquered the Ranthambore fort. When faced with a certain defeat, the defending ruler Hammiradeva decided to fight to death with his soldiers, and his minister Jaja supervised the organization of a \"jauhar\". The queens, daughters and other female relatives of Hammiradeva committed suicide in this jauhar. The \"jauhar\" at Ranthambore has been described by Alauddin's courtier Amir Khusrau, which makes it the first \"jauhar\" to be described in a Persian language text.\n\nAccording to many scholars, the first jauhar of Chittorgarh occurred during the 1303 siege of the Chittor fort. This \"jauhar\" became a subject of legendary Rajasthani poems, with Rani Padmini the main character, wherein she and other Rajput women commit \"jauhar\" to avoid being captured by Alauddin Khalji of Delhi Sultanate.The historicity of the first jauhar of Chittor is based on Rajasthani traditional belief as well as Sufi Islamic literature such as Padmaavat by Malik Muhammed Jayasi. \n\nHowever, Kalika Qanungo states that like most of Indian history and the historic claims on Hindu social practices, this evidence is not certain. Padmini may be mythical, states Qanungo, a queen who never existed but her love story and willingness to die for her values inspired many. The Rajput tradition believes that there were three sacks of the Chittor fortress with jauhar, states Lindsey Harlan, and this has been remembered in Rajasthan with an annual festival of Jauhar Mela.\n\nThe Hindu women of the Kampili kingdom of northern Karnataka committed \"jauhar\" when it fell in 1327 to Delhi Sultanate armies of Muhammad bin Tughluq.\n\nThe Hindu king Medini Rao ruled over Chanderi in northern Madhya Pradesh in early 16th century. He tried to help Rana Sanga in the Battle of Khanua against the Muslim armies of Babur, the founder of the Mughal Empire. In January 1528 CE, his fort was overwhelmed by the invading forces of Babur. The women and children of the Chanderi fort committed \"jauhar\", the men dressed up in saffron garments and walked the ritual of \"saka\" on 29 January.\n\nRana Sanga died in 1528 CE after the Battle of Khanwa. Shortly afterwards, Mewar and Chittor came under the regency of his widow, Rani Karnavati. The kingdom was besieged by Bahadur Shah of Gujarat. Rani committed Jauhar with other women on 8 March 1535, while the Rajput army rallied out to meet the besieging Muslim army and committed saka.\n\nAs Chittorgarh faced an imminent attack from the Sultan of Gujarat, Karnavati sought the assistance of the Mughal emperor Humayun by sending him a \"rakhi\". Before Humayun could reach Chittorgarh, Bahadur Shah sacked the fort for the second time. Rani Karnavati with 13,000 women shut themselves with gunpowder, lit it and thus committed mass suicide.\n\nThe armies of Mughal Emperor Akbar besieged the Rajput fort of Chittor in September 1567. After his army conquered Chittorgarh in Rajasthan, Hindu women committed \"jauhar\" in spring of 1568 CE, and the next morning, thousands of Rajput men walked the saka ritual. The Mughal army killed all the Rajputs who walked out the fort. Abu'l-Fazl ibn Mubarak, who was not an immediate witness, gave a hearsay account of the event as seen by Akbar and his army. Abu'l-Fazl states that the women were victims of Rajput men and unwilling participants, and these Rajputs came out walking to die, throwing away their lives. According to David Smith, when Akbar entered the Chittorgarh fort in 1568, it was \"nothing but an immense crematorium\".\n\nAccording to Lindsey Harlan, the \"jauhar\" of 1568 is a part of regional legend and is locally remembered on the Hindu festival of Holi as a day of Chittorgarh massacre by the Akbar army, with \"the red color signifying the blood that flowed on that day\".\n\nRaisen in Madhya Pradesh was repeatedly attacked by the Mughal Army in the early 16th century. In 1528, the first \"jauhar\" was led by Rani Chanderi. After the Mughal army left, the kingdom refused to accept orders from Delhi. After a long siege of Raisen fort, that exhausted all supplies within the fort, Rani Durgavati and 700 Raisen women committed the second \"jauhar\" in 1532, the men led by Lakshman Tuar committed \"saka\". This refusal to submit to Mughal rule repeated, and in 1543 the third \"jauhar\" was led by Rani Ratnavali.\n\nAurangzeb with three army battalions lay siege of Bundela in Madhya Pradesh in December 1634 CE. The resident women committed \"jauhar\" as the fort fell. Aurangzeb's army entered the fort. Those who had not completed the ritual and survived the \"jauhar\" in progress were forced into the harem, men were forced to convert to Islam, those who refused were executed.\n\n"}

The user holds the wide end of the horn against the pregnant woman's abdomen, and listens through the other end.\n\nThe Pinard horn was invented by Dr. Adolphe Pinard, a French obstetrician, during the 19th century. Pinard was an early supporter of advancements in prenatal care, including closer fetal health monitoring.\n\nPinard horns continue to be used around the world, particularly by midwives, but also by doctors and nurses. Pinard horns are the most common fetal stethoscopes in much of Europe, even today, which surprises some doctors from the United States, where a Doppler fetal monitor is standard. It provides an alternative to more expensive Doppler. Another alternative is the fetoscope, which is a stethoscope designed for auscultating fetuses. A midwife in Mexico describes using the Pinard horn:\nA Pinard horn may be used to determine the position of the fetus. A Pinard horn is more precise than a Doppler device for this purpose. A Doppler device detects a heart tone farther away from the location of origin. A Pinard horn must be pressed to a location very close to the fetal heart in order to detect it, providing a more accurate indication of fetal position. A doctor, nurse, or midwife can also use palpation and auscultation to determine fetal position.\n\n"}

The player takes the role of Jade as she attends the Sycamore Riding School in Scotland. Throughout the game, the player is able to train, care for, and compete with their horse while interacting with the other students in the Academy, and solving a mystery.\n\nThe game is named after famous horse riders in Europe: Pippa Funnell (Great Britain) and Alexandra Ledermann (France), and is part of a series of games.\n\nTo begin the game, the player must choose a name for themselves and select the horse they will use. There are many breeds to choose from, as well as colours, but none have impact on performance. After the horse is named, the story begins with Jade on her way to the Academy. Throughout the game, the students and Jade travel to the USA and Morocco to train and compete against other riding schools.\n\nThe player (as Jade) must take \"classes\" to progress through the week, with a competition to prepare for each weekend. Training for each riding discipline (dressage, show-jumping, and cross-country) and horse care must be done at least twice each week, in addition to maintaining a high social rating by interacting with the other students and wearing stylish clothes.\n\nOccasionally, an event may take place that overrides the class chosen. In these events the player may be helped by a \"voice\" with the name Elsys. The player should be mindful to do required activities earlier in the week to ensure they are completed before the competition. If the player does not score high enough in one or more of the required activities, the week must be repeated.\n\nHorse Care: The player is able to care for their horse by mucking the stall, picking the hoofs, bathing, and grooming him. It is best to complete this activity 4-5 times per week to maintain the best happiness levels for the horse.\n\nFoal Care: After obtaining the foal, it must be cared for. The foal will perform three actions, and the player must give the foal what it needs based on them. The player can find clues about what each action means by reading books in the library.\n\nCross-Country: The player rides their horse through an outdoor, long-distance jumping course than uses solid objects, such as fencing or logs, as jumps. The event is timed, with a time-limit, and the rider with the least number of faults and fastest time wins. When approaching a jump, wait for the circle in front to turn green, then press the spacebar (X button for PlayStation 2) to attempt the jump. If the circle is not green, or the jump is approached at an angle, the horse will refuse, resulting in faults and lost time. Too many refusals and the rider will be disqualified.\n\nShow-Jumping: This takes place in the arena, using jumps that will fall if knocked. Similar to cross-country, faults are given for refusals and knocking down rails, and the event is timed. Instead of circles in front of the jumps, there is a bar that changes from red to green. Approach the jump straight and press the spacebar (X button) when the bar is green coloured to clear the jump.\n\nDressage: Use the arrow keys to follow the path on the ground, while maintaining the correct gait. In the first few weeks, it is recommended that the player read the dressage books in the library to learn how to perform the different maneuvers required in later weeks.\n\nWalk: The player takes their horse out for a trail ride, and can explore the grounds around the Academy, or the local areas while abroad. There is no time limits or other requirements, but it will improve the horse's happiness. It can be helpful to use this activity to become somewhat familiar with each area, as later events in the game can take place there.\n\nRest Room: This activity is for raising popularity with the other students by talking with them. The player can talk to two students (or one student twice) each time this activity is chosen. Use this time to learn about each student's personality and other helpful tips for the mystery part of the game.\n\nBedroom: The player can change their clothes (casual, and for each riding event) as well as their horse's equipment to try to earn more popularity points. Jade has a laptop that may also be used for research and online shopping. Websites can be found throughout the game.\n\nLibrary: Here the player can read up on dressage moves or how to care for their horse and foal.\n\nCompetitions: At the end of each week, a competition is held that the player must perform well at to get the best ending. There are three rounds to each competition: dressage, cross-country, and show-jumping. Each event's scores are added together to produce an overall standing. Each week features different courses, increasing in difficulty as the games progresses.\n\nJade: The main character that the player controls. She has short red hair, grey eyes, and freckles. She has a strong personality, but is overall friendly and kind.\n\nSpike: Male with spikey blonde hair. He has a bit of a dangerous background, and is only at the Academy because of his parents. A bit of a rebel, he doesn't hold back what he wants to say.\n\nGinger: Female with long blonde hair and fair skin. She is fun-loving but strong enough to deal with the others.\n\nEsteban: Spanish male with short black hair, blue eyes, and tanned skin. He has a gentle and welcoming personality and likes to dress with a bit of class.\n\nKiew: Asian female with long black hair. She is very competitive and takes every chance she can to race the others, either on horseback or in the swimming pool. She does not like to be defeated.\n\nDirector: The director of the academy, He has balding white hair and mustache and beard. He appears at the beginning of the game and before competitions.\n\nHarry: Short white hair and mustache/beard. He is a bit gruff, but instructs the students on how to properly care for their horses.\n\nThere are two direct sequels to this game: \"\" (\"Horsez\" in North America), and \"\" (\"Horsez 2\"). In \"Golden Stirrup Challenge\", the player attends Jade's new riding school as a new character Flora. In \"Secrets of the Ranch\", Flora owns a farm that the player works at as another new character Emma.\n\n"}
{"id": "6527160", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6527160", "title": "Pregnancy options counseling", "text": "Pregnancy options counseling\n\nPregnancy options counseling is a form of counseling that provides information and support regarding a women's pregnancy. Woman seeking pregnancy options counseling are typically doing so in the case of an unintended pregnancy. Limited access to birth control and family planning resources, as well as misuse of birth control are some of the major contributing factors to unintended pregnancies around the world. In 2012, the global rate of unintended pregnancies was estimated to be 40 percent, or eighty-five million pregnancies.\n\nPregnancy options counselors educate women about the different options that are available and help guide them to a decision on how to proceed with their pregnancy. The options include abortion, adoption, or parenting. The job of a pregnancy options counselor is to neither encourage nor discourage a woman’s particular decision, nor do they profit from the woman’s choice. Rather, they present unbiased information about each of the options non-judgmentally, then help the woman explore her feelings and come to a decision that fits her best based on her values, culture, future plans, etc. Pregnancy options counseling centers are not the same thing as crisis pregnancy centers, which may not provide unbiased information.\n\nOne option that a woman with an unplanned pregnancy may consider is abortion, the deliberate termination of a pregnancy. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), about 40–50 million abortions are performed worldwide each year. About 20 million of these abortions are considered unsafe and result in around 67,000 deaths each year. Abortion rates are similar across countries despite its being legal in some and illegal in others. In other words, just as many women get abortions in countries where it is illegal as in countries where it is legal. The only difference is that they proceed with illegal abortions, which are more likely to be provided under unsafe conditions by poorly trained providers. A woman’s pregnancy options in regards to abortion would be presented differently by her counselor, depending on the country they are in. The Mexico City Policy is an example of governments restricting this aspect of pregnancy options counseling.\n\nDifferent countries have different abortion policies, which are based on the extent to which the unplanned pregnancy is affecting mother and fetus. 96 percent of countries allow abortions to save a woman whose life is at risk. Six countries in the world do not permit the termination of a pregnancy under any circumstance; that is 3% of the worlds countries that don't allow abortion at all. There are 50 countries (26%) that allow an abortion only if it is to save the mother’s life, 82 countries (42%) that allow abortion to save the mother’s life or for at least one of the following reasons: to preserve the woman’s physical health, to preserve the woman’s mental health, in the case of rape or incest, to avoid fetal impairment, or for economic or social reasons. Lastly, 58 countries (30%) allow abortions on request for any reason, though these countries usually do not allow the pregnancy to be terminated beyond a certain stage.\n\nShould a pregnant woman’s country allow her to get an abortion, a pregnancy counselor can help her to address the tough questions that might arise and give her information on the types of abortion. Once a woman has decided on abortion, there are two ways in which one can be induced. The first type of abortion is a medical abortion that involves the use of drugs. This option is only feasible within the first 9 weeks of pregnancy. After that, the only other option is a surgical abortion which involves the removal of the placenta and fetus.\n\nAdoption is a permanent, legal transfer of parental rights and responsibilities from child’s birth parents to the adoptive parents. Pregnant women looking to place their child up for adoption have many options as to how much involvement they wish to have in choosing the adoptive parents and to some degree. Nonetheless, birthmothers choosing to put their child up for adoption are legally terminating their parental rights to the child. Adoption laws differ state by state; adoption agencies, counselors, and lawyers can be used to provide information to the birth parents and adoptive parents about this process.\n\nThere are two general types of adoption to choose from: closed adoption, and open adoption. Closed adoptions are when the birthmother and adoptive parents have no contact with one another. In this case, the records of the biological parents are kept sealed. Closed adoptions are becoming less common within the United States but are still prevalent in international adoptions. Open adoptions occur when the biological mother and adoptive parents chose to keep in touch, though the amount and type of contact varies case by case, depending on what both parties agree on.\n\nIf a pregnant woman seeking pregnancy options counseling is considering completing her pregnancy, whether it be in the case of adoption or that she is choosing to parent, her next step would be to start prenatal care. Prenatal care is a type of preventative healthcare which serves to prevent potential health problems and promote a healthy lifestyle during the pregnancy.\n\nIf a mother choses to parent her child, she should also expect to make some lifestyle changes to ensure the health and safety of her unborn child. The suggested lifestyle changes include stopping the consumption of caffeine, alcohol, cigarettes, marijuana, recreational drugs, and prescription drugs. The mother is also encouraged to have a healthy diet and excursive regularly.\n\n\n"}

His career in national politics spanned from 1914 to 1935, after which he spent much of his life in exile.\n\nBrache was born in Moca, but lived in La Vega from an early age and considered that to be his home town. He was elected to the National Congress in 1914, aged 25, but resigned the following year to enter the diplomatic corps. Brache later worked as a senior civil servant for a period, and then in 1924 returned to the National Congress. He supported Rafael Trujillo's coup in 1930, and during the early years of his regime served as a diplomat and government minister. He was Ambassador to the United States from 1930 to 1931 and from 1934 to 1935, Ambassador to the United Kingdom from 1931 to 1933, and Secretary of Finance from 1933 to 1934. He remained in the U.S. after being dismissed as ambassador, and in 1937 was declared a \"traitor to the homeland\" for his opposition to Trujillo.\n\nBrache was born in Moca to María Apolonia Ramírez Melert and Elías Brache Soriano. His father, who was born in Santo Domingo, was a music teacher and bandleader. Brache moved to La Vega when he was a small child, and attended school there. He followed his older brother Elías into politics, becoming chairman of the local municipal council at the age of 21. In 1914, aged 25, Brache was elected to represent La Vega in the Chamber of Deputies, the lower house of the National Congress. He resigned the following year to take up the position of Consul-General in London (the equivalent of ambassador), and had his credentials received in February 1916.\n\nAs a result of his country's loss of sovereignty during the American military occupation, Brache served in London for only two years before being recalled. He returned to the National Congress at the 1924 general election, as a representative of the Patriotic Coalition of Citizens. Brache was a director of the party's newspaper, \"El Siglo\" (\"The Century\"), and also served for periods as Chief of the Bureau of Internal Revenue, Director-General of Immigration, and as a delegate to the Inter-Parliamentary Union.\n\nIn March 1930, President Horacio Vásquez was overthrown in a coup led by Rafael Estrella Ureña and General Rafael Trujillo. Estrella Ureña succeeded Vásquez as provisional president, and with Trujillo worked out an arrangement whereby the pair would stand on the same ticket at the 1930 presidential election (with Trujillo running for president and Estrella Ureña for vice-president). Brache, a supporter of the coup, reputedly clung to Trujillo \"like a leech\", and was appointed as the new Ambassador to the United States.\n\nBrache's first task as ambassador was to persuade the American government to endorse Trujillo's candidacy. On April 23, 1930, he met with Joseph P. Cotton, the Under Secretary of State. He told Cotton that Trujillo was a \"very able man, a good organizer, very clever, intelligent and honest\", and secured reluctant approval for the new regime. A report was immediately sent back to Santo Domingo, and the following day Trujillo gave a major speech in which he publicly announced his election manifesto. However, the extent to which Brache was actually able to influence the U.S. government's position is uncertain. One contemporary commentator believed that Trujillo had made a deal with the Americans in the days after the coup, and suggested that Branche had effectively been sent on a fool's errand.\n\nBrache was recalled from the United States in early 1931, apparently for failing to secure a loan from the American government. Later in the year, he was instead appointed Ambassador to the United Kingdom, taking up that post in December 1931. He was also accredited as the non-resident ambassador to Denmark and the Netherlands. In 1933, Brache returned to Santo Domingo to become Finance Secretary. He was re-appointed Ambassador to the United States in November 1934, presenting his credentials the following month. Brache's second term in Washington was largely devoted to improving Trujillo's public reputation, which had suffered due to reports of political assassinations and media suppression. He argued publicly and privately that the Dominican government was being unfair criticised, and praised Trujillo's personal accomplishments. In a 1935 address to the Pan-American Union, he praised Trujillo's \"firm love of peace\" and \"eloquence of deeds\", and said he was deserving of \"the gratitude of the world\".\n\nBrache was dismissed as ambassador in November 1935, apparently due to rumours of involvement with some of Trujillo's exiled opponents. He was summoned back to the Dominican Republic to face a government tribunal, but chose to remain in the United States and eventually had his passport revoked. Brache resigned from the Dominican Party in March 1936, although his resignation was refused. In November 1937, the National Congress declared he and three others to be \"unworthy Dominicans\" and \"traitors to the homeland\". This was in response to their public condemnation of Trujillo's attempted genocide of Haitians (the \"parsley massacre\") earlier in the year. Brache was prominent in the Dominican community in New York, and during the 1940s lived on Riverside Drive, Manhattan, with his family and their live-in servants. He was only able to return to the Dominican Republic after Trujillo's assassination in 1961, when President Joaquín Balaguer revoked the earlier decree.\n\nBrache married Dolores Grecia Bernard González, with whom he had nine children. In 1947, one of his sons, Rafael Jr., was involved in the abortive Cayo Confites expedition, in which Dominican and Cuban insurrectionaries (including a young Fidel Castro) sought to overthrow Trujillo by force. Most of Brache's children remained in the United States, and a grandson, Tom Perez, became Secretary of Labor in the Obama Administration and in 2017, he became the Democratic National Committee Chair. Perez has frequently mentioned his grandfather in political speeches, including in his Senate confirmation hearing. A July 2016 piece in \"The Wall Street Journal\" suggested that he had downplayed or misrepresented Brache's connections with Trujillo. In response, Perez implied that the article had been produced as an attempt to smear him while he was under consideration for the Democratic Party's vice-president nomination.\n\n"}

The murders were planned and committed by the family's 12-year-old daughter Jasmine and her 23-year-old boyfriend Jeremy Steinke, now going by the name Jackson May. Jasmine and Steinke were each convicted on three counts of first-degree murder. The daughter, who had turned 13 before being convicted, is thought to be the youngest person in Canada ever convicted of multiple first-degree murder counts. Her 10-year sentence was completed on May 6, 2016.\n\nAt 1:00 p.m. on April 23, 2006, the bodies of husband Marc Richardson, 42, and wife Debra, 48, were found in the basement of their home, and the body of their son Tyler Jacob, 8, was discovered upstairs. Absent from the home at that time was the couple's 12-year-old daughter Jasmine. For a time it was feared that she might have also been a victim, but she was arrested the following day in the community of Leader, Saskatchewan, about away, with her 23-year-old boyfriend Jeremy Allan Steinke. Both were charged with the three murders. Later, on May 3, 2006, Steinke's friend Kacy Lancaster, 19, was charged with being an accessory, for driving them away in her pickup truck later in the day and for disposing of evidence.\n\nAccording to friends of Jasmine, the girl's parents had punished her for dating Steinke due to the age disparity. Her friends had also criticized their relationship. Shortly after her arrest, Steinke asked her to marry him, and she agreed. According to friends of Steinke, he told them he was a 300-year-old werewolf. He allegedly told his friends that he liked the taste of blood, and wore a small vial of blood around his neck. He also had a user account at the VampireFreaks.com website. The girl had a page at the same site, leading to speculation they met there. However, an acquaintance of Steinke later said the couple actually met at a punk rock show in early 2006. The couple were also found to be communicating at Nexopia, a popular website for young Canadians. Various messages they sent to each other were available to the public, before the accounts were removed by Nexopia staff.\n\nJasmine's user page, under the name \"runawaydevil\", falsely said she was 15 and ended with the text \"Welcome to my tragic end\". Just hours prior to committing the murders, Steinke and some friends reportedly watched the 1994 film \"Natural Born Killers\", about a young couple who go on a violent killing spree. Steinke told his friends that he and his girlfriend should go about their plans in a similar manner, but without sparing her young brother. Steinke also said to an undercover officer: 'You ever watch the movie \"Natural Born Killers\"?... I think that's the best love story of all time...'.\n\nUnder the Youth Criminal Justice Act, Jasmine's name could no longer be published in Canada after she became a suspect. Under the same act, twelve is the youngest possible age at which a person can be charged with a crime; convicts who were under fourteen years of age at the time they committed a crime cannot be sentenced as adults, and cannot be given more than a ten-year sentence. On July 9, 2007, Jasmine, who had by then turned 13, was found guilty of three counts of first-degree murder in the killings. She is believed to be the youngest person ever convicted of a multiple murder in Canada.\n\nOn November 8, 2007, she was sentenced to the maximum penalty of ten years' imprisonment. Her sentence included credit for eighteen months already spent in custody, to be followed by four years in a psychiatric institution and four-and-a-half years under conditional supervision in the community.\n\nIn September 2011, Jasmine began attending classes at Mount Royal University in Calgary, Alberta during the final years of her sentence. She was released from a ten-year sentence at a psychiatric hospital in the fall of 2011, and in October 2012 it was reported her rehabilitation was going well, and she expressed remorse for her actions that experts considered genuine.\n\nIn May 2016 her sentence was completed, and she was freed of any further court-ordered conditions, restrictions or supervision after a final sentence review on May 6, 2016.\n\nSteinke allegedly admitted to the murder of the parents in conversation with an undercover police officer while in custody. He was tried in November 2008 and found guilty by a jury on three counts of first-degree murder for the killings of the three Richardson victims. On December 15, 2008, Steinke was sentenced to three life sentences, one for each first-degree murder count. The sentences are to be served concurrently, and Steinke will be eligible for parole after serving twenty-five years.\n\nThe accessory to murder charge against the couple's friend Kacy Lancaster was dropped, and she pleaded guilty to an obstruction charge in Medicine Hat provincial court. She received one year house arrest as part of the plea bargain, and was ordered to refrain from drugs and alcohol.\n\n"}

While sexual assault and other forms of interpersonal violence can occur in all forms of relationships, it is found that sexual minorities experience it at rates that are equal to or higher than their heterosexual counterparts. There is a lack of research on this specific problem for the LGBT population as a whole, but there does exist a substantial amount of research on college LGBT students who have experienced sexual assault. \n\nThere are varying definitions as to what sexual assault is defined as. According to the United States Department of Justice:\"The term 'sexual assault' means any nonconsensual sexual act proscribed by Federal, tribal, or State law, including when the victim lacks capacity to consent.\"Definitions and laws of sexual assault vary from state to state. The website FindLaw allows users to click on their corresponding to state to read about how their state defines what sexual assault is, as well as what laws and limitations exist. Sexual assault of LGBT individuals refers to the act of sexual violence against persons who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender amongst other sexualities and sexual minorities. \n\nThe Rape, Abuse and Incest National Network, also known as RAINN, puts out general statistics of sexual assault, including:\n\n\nAccording to a 2010 findings on The National Intimate Partner and Sexual Violence Survey, put out by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, it concluded that:\n\n\nIn a paper done by Emily Rothman, Deinera Exner, and Allyson Baughman, it was found that, in regard to lifetime sexual assault victimization, the estimated prevalence for lesbian and bisexual women was approximately 12.6 - 85%. For gay and bisexual men, it was 11.8-54.0%.\n\nThe underlying issues of sexual assault against LGBT persons includes homophobia and transphobia among other forms of prejudice against sexual minorities. These forms of prejudice end up creating unsafe spaces for LGBT persons where they do not feel comfortable expressing themselves or do not feel safe living as their authentic self. \n\nAccording to the Pride Resource Center at Colorado State University, homophobia is defined as:\"Homophobia is a pervasive, irrational fear of homosexuality. Homophobia includes the fear heterosexuals have of any homosexual feelings within themselves, any overt mannerisms or actions that would suggest homosexuality, and the resulting desire to suppress or stamp out homosexuality. And it also includes the self-hatred and self-denial of homosexuals who know what they are but have been taught all their lives by a heterosexual society that people like themselves are sick, sinful and criminal.”According to Planned Parenthood, transphobia is defined as:\"Transphobia is the fear, hatred, disbelief, or mistrust of people who are transgender, thought to be transgender, or whose gender expression doesn’t conform to traditional gender roles. Transphobia can prevent transgender and gender nonconforming people from living full lives free from harm.\"These phobias, as well as myths centered around LGBT individuals, influence a culture that holds back persons from identifying how they choose and places them into a binary that doesn't encompass all possible ways of identifying. One of the main myths that can harm LGBT individuals is the idea that they have not met the right guy/girl yet. This perpetuates heterosexism and denies the possibility of one having attraction to the same gender. \n\nOne of the biggest misconceptions that comes out of transphobia centers around the use of bathrooms. Made popular by North Carolina's \"Bathroom Bill\", it brought up the concern that by allowing individuals to use the bathroom that corresponds to the gender they identify as, predators could easily enter bathrooms and take advantage of individuals claiming that they identify as the gender the bathroom is. Legislation, such as House Bill 2, only perpetuate the discrimination of transgender individuals, rather than give them support to live their lives as the gender by which they identify. Laws have always existed that prohibit individuals from entering bathrooms with the purpose of harming others.\n"}

The content can be a plea for absolution or blaming family, friends or society for life's failings. A suicide message can be a written note, an audio message, or a video.\n\nSome fields of study, such as sociology, psychiatry and graphology, have investigated the reasons why people who die by, or attempt, suicide leave a note.\n\nAccording to Lenora Olsen, the most common reasons that people contemplating suicide choose to write a suicide note include one or more of the following:\n\nSometimes there is also a message in the case of murder–suicide, explaining the reason(s) for the murder(s), see for example, Marc Lépine's suicide statement and videotaped statements of the 7 July 2005 London bombers.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "419259", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=419259", "title": "Survival analysis", "text": "Survival analysis\n\nSurvival analysis is a branch of statistics for analyzing the expected duration of time until one or more events happen, such as death in biological organisms and failure in mechanical systems. This topic is called reliability theory or reliability analysis in engineering, duration analysis or duration modelling in economics, and event history analysis in sociology. Survival analysis attempts to answer questions such as: what is the proportion of a population which will survive past a certain time? Of those that survive, at what rate will they die or fail? Can multiple causes of death or failure be taken into account? How do particular circumstances or characteristics increase or decrease the probability of survival?\n\nTo answer such questions, it is necessary to define \"lifetime\". In the case of biological survival, death is unambiguous, but for mechanical reliability, failure may not be well-defined, for there may well be mechanical systems in which failure is partial, a matter of degree, or not otherwise localized in time. Even in biological problems, some events (for example, heart attack or other organ failure) may have the same ambiguity. The theory outlined below assumes well-defined events at specific times; other cases may be better treated by models which explicitly account for ambiguous events.\n\nMore generally, survival analysis involves the modelling of time to event data; in this context, death or failure is considered an \"event\" in the survival analysis literature – traditionally only a single event occurs for each subject, after which the organism or mechanism is dead or broken. \"Recurring event\" or \"repeated event\" models relax that assumption. The study of recurring events is relevant in systems reliability, and in many areas of social sciences and medical research.\n\nSurvival analysis is used in several ways:\n\n\nThe following terms are commonly used in survival analyses:\n\n\nThis example uses the Acute Myelogenous Leukemia survival data set \"aml\" from the \"survival\" package in R. The data set is from Miller (1997) and the question is whether the standard course of chemotherapy should be extended ('maintained') for additional cycles.\n\nThe aml data set sorted by survival time is shown in the box.\n\n\nThe last observation (11), at 161 weeks, is censored. Censoring indicates that the patient did not have an event (no recurrence of aml cancer). Another subject, observation 3, was censored at 13 weeks (indicated by status=0). This subject was only in the study for 13 weeks, and the aml cancer did not recur during those 13 weeks. It is possible that this patient was enrolled near the end of the study, so that they could only be observed for 13 weeks. It is also possible that the patient was enrolled early in the study, but was lost to follow up or withdrew from the study. The table shows that other subjects were censored at 16, 28, and 45 weeks (observations 17, 6, and 9 with status=0). The remaining subjects all experienced events (recurrence of aml cancer) while in the study. The question of interest is whether recurrence occurs later in maintained patients than in non-maintained patients.\n\nThe Survival function S(t), is the probability that a subject survives longer than time t. S(t) is theoretically a smooth curve, but it is usually estimated using the Kaplan-Meier (KM) curve. The graph shows the KM plot for the aml data and can be interpreted as follows:\n\n\nA life table summarizes survival data in terms of the number of events and the proportion surviving at each event time point. The life table for the aml data, created using the R software, is shown.\n\nThe life table summarizes the events and the proportion surviving at each event time point. The columns in the life table have the following interpretation:\n\n\nThe log-rank test compares the survival times of two or more groups. This example uses a log-rank test for a difference in survival in the maintained versus non-maintained treatment groups in the aml data. The graph shows KM plots for the aml data broken out by treatment group, which is indicated by the variable \"x\" in the data.\n\nThe null hypothesis for a log-rank test is that the groups have the same survival. The expected number of subjects surviving at each time point in each is adjusted for the number of subjects at risk in the groups at each event time. The log-rank test determines if the observed number of events in each group is significantly different from the expected number. The formal test is based on a chi-squared statistic. When the log-rank statistic is large, it is evidence for a difference in the survival times between the groups. The log-rank statistic approximately has a chi-squared distribution with one degree of freedom, and the p-value is calculated using the chi-squared distribution.\n\nFor the example data, the log-rank test for difference in survival gives a p-value of p=0.0653, indicating that the treatment groups do not differ significantly in survival, assuming an alpha level of 0.05. The sample size of 23 subjects is modest, so there is little power to detect differences between the treatment groups. The chi-squared test is based on asymptotic approximation, so the p-value should be regarded with caution for small sample sizes.\n\nKaplan-Meier curves and log-rank tests are most useful when the predictor variable is categorical (e.g., drug vs. placebo), or takes a small number of values (e.g., drug doses 0, 20, 50, and 100 mg/day) that can be treated as categorical. The log-rank test and KM curves don’t work easily with quantitative predictors such as gene expression, white blood count, or age. For quantitative predictor variables, an alternative method is Cox proportional hazards regression analysis. Cox PH models work also with categorical predictor variables, which are encoded as {0,1} indicator or dummy variables. The log-rank test is a special case of a Cox PH analysis, and can be performed using Cox PH software.\n\nThis example uses the melanoma data set from Dalgaard Chapter 12.\nData are in the R package ISwR. The Cox proportional hazards regression using R gives the results shown in the box.\n\nThe Cox regression results are interpreted as follows.\n\n\nThe summary output also gives upper and lower 95% confidence intervals for the hazard ratio: lower 95% bound = 1.15; upper 95% bound = 3.26.\n\nFinally, the output gives p-values for three alternative tests for overall significance of the model:\n\n\nThese three methods are asymptotically equivalent. For large enough N, they will give similar results. For small N, they may differ somewhat. The last row, \"Score (logrank) test\" is the result for the log-rank test, with p=0.011, the same result as the log-rank test, because the log-rank test is a special case of a Cox PH regression. The Likelihood ratio test has better behavior for small sample sizes, so it is generally preferred.\n\nThe Cox model extends the log-rank test by allowing the inclusion of additional covariates. This example use the melanom data set where the predictor variables include a continuous covariate, the thickness of the tumor (variable name = “thick”).\n\nIn the histograms, the thickness values don’t look normally distributed. Regression models, including the Cox model, generally give more reliable results with normally-distributed variables. For this example use a log transform. The log of the thickness of the tumor looks to be more normally distributed, so the Cox models will use log thickness. The Cox PH analysis gives the results in the box.\n\nThe p-value for all three overall tests (likelihood, Wald, and score) are significant, indicating that the model is significant. The p-value for log(thick) is 6.9e-07, with a hazard ratio HR = exp(coef) = 2.18, indicating a strong relationship between the thickness of the tumor and increased risk of death.\n\nBy contrast, the p-value for sex is now p=0.088. The hazard ratio HR = exp(coef) = 1.58, with a 95% confidence interval of 0.934 to 2.68. Because the confidence interval for HR includes 1, these results indicate that sex makes a smaller contribution to the difference in the HR after controlling for the thickness of the tumor, and only trend toward significance. Examination of graphs of log(thickness) by sex and a t-test of log(thickness) by sex both indicate that there is a significant difference between men and women in the thickness of the tumor when they first see the clinician.\n\nThe Cox model assumes that the hazards are proportional. The proportional hazard assumption may be tested using the R function cox.zph(). A p-value is less than 0.05 indicates that the hazards are not proportional. For the melanoma data, p=0.222, indicating that the hazards are, at least approximately, proportional. Additional tests and graphs for examining a Cox model are described in the textbooks cited.\n\nCox models can be extended to deal with variations on the simple analysis. \n\nThe Cox PH regression model is a linear model. It is similar to linear regression and logistic regression. Specifically, these methods assume that a single line, curve, plane, or surface is sufficient to separate groups (alive, dead) or to estimate a quantitative response (survival time).\n\nIn some cases alternative partitions give more accurate classification or quantitative estimates. One set of alternative methods are tree-structured survival models, including survival random forests. Tree-structured survival models may give more accurate predictions than Cox models. Examining both types of models for a given data set is a reasonable strategy.\n\nThis example of a survival tree analysis uses the R package \"rpart\". The example is based on 146 stage C prostate cancer patients in the data set stagec in rpart. Rpart and the stagec example are described in the PDF document \"An Introduction to Recursive Partitioning Using the RPART Routines\". Terry M. Therneau, Elizabeth J. Atkinson, Mayo Foundation. September 3, 1997.\n\nThe variables in stagec are:\n\nThe survival tree produced by the analysis is shown in the figure.\n\nEach branch in the tree indicates a split on the value of a variable. For example, the root of the tree splits subjects with grade < 2.5 versus subjects with grade 2.5 or greater. The terminal nodes indicate the number of subjects in the node, the number of subjects who have events, and the relative event rate compared to the root. In the node on the far left, the values 1/33 indicate that 1 of the 33 subjects in the node had an event, and that the relative event rate is 0.122. In the node on the far right bottom, the values 11/15 indicate that 11 of 15 subjects in the node had an event, and the relative event rate is 2.7.\n\nAn alternative to building a single survival tree is to build many survival trees, where each tree is constructed using a sample of the data, and average the trees to predict survival. This is the method underlying the survival random forest models. Survival random forest analysis is available in the R package \"randomForestSRC\".\n\nThe randomForestSRC package includes an example survival random forest analysis using the data set pbc. This data is from the Mayo Clinic Primary Biliary Cirrhosis (PBC) trial of the liver conducted between 1974 and 1984. In the example, the random forest survival model gives more accurate predictions of survival than the Cox PH model. The prediction errors are estimated by bootstrap re-sampling.\n\nThe object of primary interest is the survival function, conventionally denoted \"S\", which is defined as\n\nwhere \"t\" is some time, \"T\" is a random variable denoting the time of death, and \"Pr\" stands for probability. That is, the survival function is the probability that the time of death is later than some specified time \"t\".\nThe survival function is also called the \"survivor function\" or \"survivorship function\" in problems of biological survival, and the \"reliability function\" in mechanical survival problems. In the latter case, the reliability function is denoted \"R\"(\"t\").\n\nUsually one assumes \"S\"(0) = 1, although it could be less than 1 if there is the possibility of immediate death or failure.\n\nThe survival function must be non-increasing: \"S\"(\"u\") ≤ \"S\"(\"t\") if \"u\" ≥ \"t\". This property follows directly because \"T\">\"u\" implies \"T\">\"t\". This reflects the notion that survival to a later age is only possible if all younger ages are attained. Given this property, the lifetime distribution function and event density (\"F\" and \"f\" below) are well-defined.\n\nThe survival function is usually assumed to approach zero as age increases without bound, i.e., \"S\"(\"t\") → 0 as \"t\" → ∞, although the limit could be greater than zero if eternal life is possible. For instance, we could apply survival analysis to a mixture of stable and unstable carbon isotopes; unstable isotopes would decay sooner or later, but the stable isotopes would last indefinitely.\n\nRelated quantities are defined in terms of the survival function.\n\nThe lifetime distribution function, conventionally denoted \"F\", is defined as the complement of the survival function,\n\nIf \"F\" is differentiable then the derivative, which is the density function of the lifetime distribution, is conventionally denoted \"f\",\n\nThe function \"f\" is sometimes called the event density; it is the rate of death or failure events per unit time.\n\nThe survival function can be expressed in terms of probability distribution and probability density functions\n\nSimilarly, a survival event density function can be defined as\n\nIn other fields, such as statistical physics, the survival event density function is known as the first passage time density.\n\nThe hazard function, conventionally denoted formula_6, is defined as the event rate at time \"t\" conditional on survival until time \"t\" or later (that is, \"T\" ≥ \"t\"). Suppose that an item has survived for a time t and we desire the probability that it will not survive for an additional time \"dt\":\n\nForce of mortality is a synonym of \"hazard function\" which is used particularly in demography and actuarial science, where it is denoted by formula_8. The term \"hazard rate\" is another synonym.\n\nThe force of mortality of the survival function is defined as formula_9\n\nThe force of mortality is also called the force of failure. It is the probability density function of the distribution of mortality.\n\nIn actuarial science, the hazard rate is the rate of death for lives aged x. For a life aged x, the force of mortality t years later is the force of mortality for a (x + t)–year old. The hazard rate is also called the failure rate. Hazard rate and failure rate are names used in reliability theory.\n\nAny function \"h\" is a hazard function if and only if it satisfies the following properties:\n\n\nIn fact, the hazard rate is usually more informative about the underlying mechanism of failure than the other representatives of a lifetime distribution.\n\nThe hazard function must be non-negative, λ(\"t\") ≥ 0, and its integral over formula_12 must be infinite, but is not otherwise constrained; it may be increasing or decreasing, non-monotonic, or discontinuous.\nAn example is the bathtub curve hazard function, which is large for small values of \"t\", decreasing to some minimum, and thereafter increasing again; this can model the property of some mechanical systems to either fail soon after operation, or much later, as the system ages.\n\nThe hazard function can alternatively be represented in terms of the cumulative hazard function, conventionally denoted formula_13:\n\nso transposing signs and exponentiating\n\nor differentiating (with the chain rule)\n\nThe name \"cumulative hazard function\" is derived from the fact that\n\nwhich is the \"accumulation\" of the hazard over time.\n\nFrom the definition of formula_18, we see that it increases without bound as \"t\" tends to infinity (assuming that \"S\"(\"t\") tends to zero). This implies that formula_19 must not decrease too quickly, since, by definition, the cumulative hazard has to diverge. For example, formula_20 is not the hazard function of any survival distribution, because its integral converges to 1.\n\nThe survival function \"S\"(\"t\"), the cumulative hazard function Λ(\"t\"), the density \"f\"(\"t\"), and the hazard function λ(\"t\") are related through\n\nFuture lifetime at a given time formula_22 is the time remaining until death, given survival to age formula_22. Thus, it is formula_24 in the present notation. The expected future lifetime is the expected value of future lifetime. The probability of death at or before age formula_25, given survival until age formula_22, is just\n\nTherefore, the probability density of future lifetime is\n\nand the expected future lifetime is\n\nwhere the second expression is obtained using integration by parts.\n\nFor formula_30, that is, at birth, this reduces to the expected lifetime.\n\nIn reliability problems, the expected lifetime is called the \"mean time to failure\", and the expected future lifetime is called the \"mean residual lifetime\".\n\nAs the probability of an individual surviving until age \"t\" or later is \"S\"(\"t\"), by definition, the expected number of survivors at age \"t\" out of an initial population of \"n\" newborns is \"n\" × \"S\"(\"t\"), assuming the same survival function for all individuals. Thus the expected proportion of survivors is \"S\"(\"t\").\nIf the survival of different individuals is independent, the number of survivors at age \"t\" has a binomial distribution with parameters \"n\" and \"S\"(\"t\"), and the variance of the proportion of survivors is \"S\"(\"t\") × (1-\"S\"(\"t\"))/\"n\".\n\nThe age at which a specified proportion of survivors remain can be found by solving the equation \"S\"(\"t\") = \"q\" for \"t\", where \"q\" is the quantile in question. Typically one is interested in the median lifetime, for which \"q\" = 1/2, or other quantiles such as \"q\" = 0.90 or \"q\" = 0.99.\n\nOne can also make more complex inferences from the survival distribution. In mechanical reliability problems, one can bring cost (or, more generally, utility) into consideration, and thus solve problems concerning repair or replacement. This leads to the study of renewal theory and reliability theory of ageing and longevity.\n\nCensoring is a form of missing data problem in which time to event is not observed for reasons such as termination of study before all recruited subjects have shown the event of interest or the subject has left the study prior to experiencing an event. Censoring is common in survival analysis.\n\nIf only the lower limit \"l\" for the true event time \"T\" is known such that \"T\" > \"l\", this is called \"right censoring\". Right censoring will occur, for example, for those subjects whose birth date is known but who are still alive when they are lost to follow-up or when the study ends. We generally encounter right-censored data.\n\nIf the event of interest has already happened before the subject is included in the study but it is not known when it occurred, the data is said to be \"left-censored\". When it can only be said that the event happened between two observations or examinations, this is \"interval censoring\".\n\nLeft censoring occurs for example when a permanent tooth has already emerged prior to the start of a dental study that aims to estimate its emergence distribution. In the same study, an emergence time is interval-censored when the permanent tooth is present in the mouth at the current examination but not yet at the previous examination. Interval censoring often occurs in HIV/AIDS studies. Indeed, time to HIV seroconversion can only be determined by a laboratory assessment which is usually initiated after a visit to the physician. Then one can only conclude that HIV seroconversion has happened between two examinations. The same is true for the diagnosis of AIDS, which is based on clinical symptoms and needs to be confirmed by a medical examination.\n\nIt may also happen that subjects with a lifetime less than some threshold may not be observed at all: this is called \"truncation\". Note that truncation is different from left censoring, since for a left censored datum, we know the subject exists, but for a truncated datum, we may be completely unaware of the subject. Truncation is also common. In a so-called \"delayed entry\" study, subjects are not observed at all until they have reached a certain age. For example, people may not be observed until they have reached the age to enter school. Any deceased subjects in the pre-school age group would be unknown. Left-truncated data are common in actuarial work for life insurance and pensions.\n\nLeft-censored data can occur when a person's survival time becomes incomplete on the left side of the follow-up period for the person. For example, in an epidemiological example, we may monitor a patient for an infectious disorder starting from the time when he or she is tested positive for the infection. Although we may know the right-hand side of the duration of interest, we may never know the exact time of exposure to the infectious agent.\n\nSurvival models can be usefully viewed as ordinary regression models in which the response variable is time. However, computing the likelihood function (needed for fitting parameters or making other kinds of inferences) is complicated by the censoring. The likelihood function for a survival model, in the presence of censored data, is formulated as follows. By definition the likelihood function is the conditional probability of the data given the parameters of the model.\nIt is customary to assume that the data are independent given the parameters. Then the likelihood function is the product of the likelihood of each datum. It is convenient to partition the data into four categories: uncensored, left censored, right censored, and interval censored. These are denoted \"unc.\", \"l.c.\", \"r.c.\", and \"i.c.\" in the equation below.\n\nFor uncensored data, with formula_32 equal to the age at death, we have\n\nFor left-censored data, such that the age at death is known to be less than formula_32, we have\n\nFor right-censored data, such that the age at death is known to be greater than formula_32, we have\n\nFor an interval censored datum, such that the age at death is known to be less than formula_38 and greater than formula_39, we have\n\nAn important application where interval-censored data arises is current status data, where an event formula_41 is known not to have occurred before an observation time and to have occurred before the next observation time.\n\nThe Kaplan-Meier estimator can be used to estimate the survival function. The Nelson–Aalen estimator can be used to provide a non-parametric estimate of the cumulative hazard rate function.\n\nThe UCLA website http://www.ats.ucla.edu/stat/ has numerous examples of statistical analyses using SAS, R, SPSS and STATA, including survival analyses.\n\nThe textbook by Kleinbaum \n\nhas examples of survival analyses using SAS, R, and other packages.

It is founded by Hermann Haken, inspired by the laser theory. Haken's interpretation of the laser principles as self-organization of non-equilibrium systems paved the way at the end of the 1960s to the development of synergetics. One of his successful popular books is \"Erfolgsgeheimnisse der Natur\", translated into English as \"The Science of Structure: Synergetics\".\n\nSelf-organization requires a 'macroscopic' system, consisting of many nonlinearly interacting subsystems. Depending on the external control parameters (environment, energy-fluxes) self-organization takes place.\n\nEssential in synergetics is the order-parameter concept which was originally introduced in the Ginzburg-Landau theory in order to describe phase-transitions in thermodynamics. The order parameter concept is generalized by Haken to the \"enslaving-principle\" saying that the dynamics of fast-relaxing (stable) modes is completely determined by the 'slow' dynamics of as a rule only a few 'order-parameters' (unstable modes). The order parameters can be interpreted as the amplitudes of the unstable modes determining the macroscopic pattern.\n\nAs a consequence, self-organization means an enormous reduction of degrees of freedom (entropy) of the system which macroscopically reveals an increase of 'order' (pattern-formation). This far-reaching macroscopic order is independent of the details of the microscopic interactions of the subsystems. This supposedly explains the self-organization of patterns in so many different systems in physics, chemistry and biology.\n\n\"[...] the statistical properties of laser light change qualitatively at the laser threshold. Below laser threshold noise increases more and more while above threshold it decreases again. [...] Below laser threshold, light consists of individual wave tracks which are emitted from the individual atoms independently of each other. Above laser threshold, a practically infinitely long wave track is produced. In order to make contact with other processes of self-organization let us interpret the processes in a lamp or in a laser by means of Bohr's model of the atom. A lamp produces its light in such a way that the excited electrons of the atoms make their transitions from the outer orbit to the inner orbit entirely independently of each other. On the other hand, the properties of laser light can be understood only if we assume that the transitions of the individual electrons occur in a correlated fashion. [...] Above laser threshold the coherent field grows more and more and it can slave the degrees of freedom of the dipole moments and of the inversion. Within synergetics it has turned out that is a quite typical equation describing effects of self-organization. [...] This equation tells us that the amplitude of the dipoles, which is proportional to A, is instantaneously given by the field amplitude B(t) (and by the fluctuating force). This is probably the simplest example of a principle which has turned out to be of fundamental importance in synergetics and which is called the slaving principle.\" (\"Light: Waves, Photons, and Atoms \", vol. 2; Laser light dynamics - chapter 13)\n\n\n\n"}

Since 1956, all the dogs serving as Uga have been part of a lineage of English Bulldogs owned by Sonny Seiler.\n\nThe Uga mascot line first started in 1956 when Seiler brought a bulldog that was given to him as a wedding present by Frank Heard to Georgia's first home game of the season. Afterwards, head coach Wally Butts asked his permission to use the dog as Georgia's mascot, and around the same time a college friend, Billy Young, suggested that he name it Uga, a play on the common abbreviation of the University of Georgia, UGA. Since then, every Uga has been owned by and lived with the Seiler family in Savannah, Georgia. Even to this day, Uga is owned by the Seiler family, who take care of him when he isn't acting as the mascot on the field. They also transport him to and from the events he attends as mascot.\n\nTraditionally, the current Uga is present at every Georgia Bulldogs home football game, many away games, and other University-related functions and sports events, and usually wears a spiked collar and red jersey with varsity letter. The red jersey is Uga's typical \"uniform,\" though he wears a green jersey on St. Patrick's Day. Other special appearances include 1982, when Uga IV attended the Heisman Trophy Ceremony in New York City wearing a tuxedo, and 2007, when Uga VI wore a black jersey for the \"blackout\" game against Auburn University. Uga's jersey is made from the same fabric as the players' official game jerseys, and he even has an official student identification card. He has a custom-built air conditioned dog house at Sanford Stadium and typically sits on or near bags of ice at games, as bulldogs are susceptible to heat stroke (a problem in the humid southeastern United States).\n\nTo date, 10 dogs have carried the name \"Uga\", which is derived from an abbreviation for the \"U\"niversity of \"G\"eorgi\"a\". Each has been descended from the original Uga, and has frequently been the son of the predecessor.\n\nDeceased Ugas are interred in a mausoleum near the main entrance at the southwest corner of Sanford Stadium. A bronze plaque describing each dog's tenure and including an epitaph is engraved in front of each tomb. The tomb's original location was at the east end of Sanford Stadium, and Ugas I and II were originally buried there. Prior to its 1981 enclosure, the University moved the Uga graves to the west end. When the west endzone was enclosed in 1992, the Ugas were entombed in their current resting place, and a bronze, life-sized statue representing Uga was placed in front of the mausoleum. On game days, fans bring flowers and gifts to leave at the tombs of the past bulldogs who served as their team's mascot.\n\nSeveral Ugas have retired as part of pre-game ceremonies, during which there is a \"passing of the collar\" and the new Uga begins his reign. During these ceremonies, the fans typically chant \"Damn good dog,\" a tradition dating back to Uga I.\n\nThe costumed character representing the University of Georgia is named Hairy Dawg and, while also a bulldog, should not be confused with the Ugas.\n\nUga has been considered a part of the football team since the day Uga I, Sonny, was asked to be the official mascot. Uga has his own custom made jersey to wear at every game day that is made with the same materials as the football players' jerseys. His jersey also has his name stitched on the back. When Uga gets a new jersey, or another Uga is named the official mascot, the old jerseys are destroyed.\n\nUga officially becomes a part of the team through a ceremony on the football field before a game. The head coach will officially welcome the next Uga by placing the well-known spiked collar on the bulldog. Uga X, the current Uga was coronated on November 21, 2015 before the Georgia Southern game. \n\nIn addition, Uga receives a varsity letter in the form of a plaque for his endless support for the athletes. The plaque is identical to those received by the athletes at the end of each season.\n\nUga even travels with the team, and stays in the same hotel as the players with his own room, with the Seilers. Uga attended the Rose Bowl in 2018, becoming the first ever playoff Uga. Uga X flew to Pasadena, CA with the team, attending all team events, supporting the football team through their playoff run in the 2017-2018 season.\n\n\nSince 1956, four other bulldogs (three of which were from the Uga family line) have served as temporary sideline mascots when the current Uga was not available. The bulldog later known as Uga IX served two terms as an interim mascot before officially becoming Uga IX.\n\nGeorgia officially claims the following animals as live mascots prior to the introduction of the Uga line in 1956.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "202358", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=202358", "title": "Vogon", "text": "Vogon\n\nThe Vogons are a fictional alien race from the planet Vogsphere in \"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\"—initially a BBC Radio series by Douglas Adams—who are responsible for the destruction of the Earth, in order to facilitate an intergalactic highway construction project for a hyperspace express route. Vogons are slug-like but vaguely humanoid, are bulkier than humans, and have green skin. Vogons are described as \"one of the most unpleasant races in the galaxy—not actually evil, but bad-tempered, bureaucratic, officious and callous\", and having \"as much sex appeal as a road accident\" as well as being the authors of \"the third worst poetry in the universe\". They are employed as the galactic government's bureaucrats. According to Marvin the Paranoid Android, they are also the worst marksmen in the galaxy.\n\nGuide Description:\n\nVogons are roughly human-sized, although much bulkier, with green or grey skin. Their noses are above their eyebrows, which are either ginger (in the television series) or white (in the film). The film's commentary states that the idea behind the high flat noses was that they evolved both the noses and the severe bureaucracy from being repeatedly whacked by the paddle creatures under the sand on Vogsphere whenever they had an independent thought (in the film, the Vogon bureaucracy is centred on Vogsphere). In the radio series it is said that \"Their highly domed nose rises above their small piggy forehead\".\n\nGarth Jennings deliberately based his conception of the Vogons on the work of cartoonist James Gillray (1757–1815). \"His creations were so grotesque...when we looked at them, we realised they \"were\" the Vogons\".\n\nThe series tells that, far back in prehistory, when the first primeval Vogons crawled out of the sea, evolution gave up on them. Through sheer obstinacy, though, the Vogons survived (partly by adapting a misplaced, badly malformed, and dyspeptic liver into a brain). As the radio show says: \"What nature refused to give to them, they did without. Until their myriad anatomical deficiencies could be rectified with surgery. They then emigrated \"en masse\" to the MeagaBrantis star cluster (although the film has them staying on Vogsphere), the political hub of the galaxy. They banish the ruling philosophers to the tax office to lick stamps and within a few short Voge years took over pretty much all of the galactic civil service, where they form most of the Galactic bureaucracy, most notably in the Vogon Constructor Fleets (which, despite their name, patrol the galaxy demolishing planets). The only named Vogons in the stories are Jeltz (see below), Kwaltz (who appears in the film), Zarniwoop, revealed to be a Vogon in the Quintessential Phase, and Jeltz's son Constant Mown.\n\nVogons are described as officiously bureaucratic, a line of work at which they perform so well that the entire galactic bureaucracy is run by them. \n\nOn Vogsphere, the Vogons would sit upon very elegant and beautiful gazelle-like creatures, whose backs would snap instantly if the Vogons tried to ride them. The Vogons were perfectly happy with just sitting on them. Another favourite Vogon pastime is to import millions of beautiful jewel-backed scuttling crabs from their native planet, cut down giant trees of breathtaking beauty, and spend a happy drunken night smashing the crabs to bits with iron mallets and cooking the crab meat by burning the trees. In the movie, the Vogons seem to smash the crabs for no apparent reason besides pure pleasure at killing something. \n\nThe Vogons' battle-cry, and counter-argument to dissent, is \"resistance is useless!\" (cf. \"Resistance is futile\").\n\nVogon poetry is described as \"the third worst poetry in the Universe\" behind that of the Azgoths of Kria; four members of an audience died of internal haemorrhaging during a recitation by their poet master Grunthos the Flatulent of his poem \"Ode to a Small Lump of Green Putty I Found in My Armpit One Midsummer Morning\" while the President of the Mid-Galactic Arts Nobbling Council survived by gnawing one of his own legs off. Grunthos himself was later killed by his own major intestine, which leaped up through his neck and throttled his brain when he attempted to read his twelve-book epic \"My Favourite Bathtime Gurgles\". Their poetry was also behind that of Paula Nancy Millstone Jennings of Sussex, which was destroyed when the Earth was. The main example used in the story is a short piece composed by Jeltz, which roughly emulates nonsense verse in style (example below).\nThe story relates that listening to it is an experience similar to torture as demonstrated when Arthur Dent and Ford Prefect are forced to listen to the poetry (and say how much they liked it) prior to being thrown out of an airlock.\n\nA second example of Vogon poetry is found in the Hitchhiker's Guide interactive fiction game that was produced by Infocom. The first verse is as above; one version of the second verse follows:\n\nAn unused extended version of the poem is also excerpted in Neil Gaiman's book \"\", in Appendix III.\n\nA third example appears in \"The Quintessential Phase\" of the radio series, again written by Jeltz.\n\nA fourth example appears in \"And Another Thing...\", the sixth book in the trilogy written by Eoin Colfer. The poem is also written by Jeltz.\n\nThe Vogon Captain in charge of overseeing the destruction of the Earth, Prostetnic Vogon Jeltz is sadistic and unpleasant to look at, even by Vogon standards. He enjoys shouting at or executing members of his own crew for insubordination, and takes professional pride in his job of demolishing planets. He very rarely smiles: \"Prostetnic Vogon Jeltz smiled very slowly. This was done not so much for effect as because he was trying to remember the sequence of muscle movements.\" \n\nIt is revealed in \"The Restaurant at the End of the Universe\" that Jeltz had been hired by Gag Halfrunt to destroy the Earth (though in the film it was Zaphod who gave the order by mistake). Halfrunt had been acting on behalf of a consortium of psychiatrists and the Imperial Galactic Government in order to prevent the discovery of the Ultimate Question. When Halfrunt learns that Arthur Dent escaped the planet's destruction, Jeltz is dispatched to track him down and destroy him. Jeltz is unable to complete this task, due to the intervention of Zaphod Beeblebrox the Fourth, Zaphod's great-grandfather.\n\nIn \"Mostly Harmless\", Jeltz is once again responsible for the destruction of the Earth, after the Vogons infiltrate the Hitchhikers' Guide company offices to turn the Guide into a device capable of destroying all Earths in every dimension, this time presumably killing Arthur, Ford, Trillian, and Arthur's daughter, Random—a fate dodged by the characters in the Quintessential Phase.\n\n\"Prostetnic Vogon\" may be a title, rather than part of his name, since during the second episode of the third radio series (Fit the Fourteenth), two other Prostetnic Vogons are heard from. Also, in \"The Restaurant at the End of the Universe\", Gag Halfrunt refers to Jeltz as \"Captain of Vogons Prostetnic\" (although this may have been a play on Halfrunt's accent).\n\nJeltz appears in:\n\n\nIn the first radio series, he was played by Bill Wallis. On television, it was Martin Benson. In the third, fourth and fifth radio series, he was played by Toby Longworth, although Longworth did not receive a credit for the role during the third series. In the film, he is voiced by Richard Griffiths. In cartoon he is voiced by Rupert Degas.\n\nThe ships of the Vogon Constructor Fleet were described as \"impossibly huge yellow somethings\" (the colour being a parallel to bulldozers that demolish Arthur's house) that \"looked more like they had been congealed than constructed\" and \"hung in the air in much the same way that bricks don't\"; they are said to be undetectable to radar and capable of travel through hyperspace. They are not crewed exclusively by Vogons; a species known as the Dentrassi are responsible for on-board catering. \n\nIn the television version of the story, the craft are shaped like battleships, albeit with a flat bottom through which the demolition beams are fired. In the film version, the craft are grey and cubic, a continuation of the emphasis on bureaucracy in the Vogons' conception: \"Douglas [Adams]'s description of the Vogon ships hanging in the air in much the same way that bricks don't [led to] these Vogon ships which are these massive concrete tower blocks, with hardly any windows, they just have a few doors around the base,\" says Joel Collins.\n\n"}
