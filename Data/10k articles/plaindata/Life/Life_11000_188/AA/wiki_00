{"id": "50785023", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=50785023", "title": "AI-control problem", "text": "AI-control problem\n\nIn artificial intelligence (AI) and philosophy, the AI control problem is the hypothetical puzzle of how to build a superintelligent agent that will aid its creators, and avoid inadvertently building a superintelligence that will harm its creators. Its study is motivated by the claim that the human race will have to get the control problem right \"the first time\", as a misprogrammed superintelligence might rationally decide to \"take over the world\" and refuse to permit its programmers to modify it after launch. In addition, some scholars argue that solutions to the control problem, alongside other advances in \"AI safety engineering\", might also find applications in existing non-superintelligent AI. Potential strategies include \"capability control\" (preventing an AI from being able to pursue harmful plans), and \"motivational control\" (building an AI that wants to be helpful).\n\nThe human race currently dominates other species because the human brain has some distinctive capabilities that the brains of other animals lack. Some scholars, such as philosopher Nick Bostrom and AI researcher Stuart Russell, controversially argue that if AI surpasses humanity in general intelligence and becomes \"superintelligent\", then this new superintelligence could become powerful and difficult to control: just as the fate of the mountain gorilla depends on human goodwill, so might the fate of humanity depend on the actions of a future machine superintelligence. Some scholars, including Nobel laureate physicists Stephen Hawking and Frank Wilczek, publicly advocated starting research into solving the (probably extremely difficult) \"control problem\" well before the first superintelligence is created, and argue that attempting to solve the problem after superintelligence is created would be too late, as an uncontrollable rogue superintelligence might successfully resist post-hoc efforts to control it. Waiting until superintelligence seems to be \"just around the corner\" could also be too late, partly because the control problem might take a long time to satisfactorily solve (and so some preliminary work needs to be started as soon as possible), but also because of the possibility of a sudden \"intelligence explosion\" from sub-human to super-human AI, in which case there might not be any substantial or unambiguous warning before superintelligence arrives. In addition, it is possible that insights gained from the control problem could in the future end up suggesting that some architectures for artificial general intelligence are more predictable and amenable to control than other architectures, which in turn could nudge helpfully early artificial general intelligence research toward the direction of the more controllable architectures.\n\nIn addition, some scholars argue that research into the AI control problem might be useful in preventing unintended consequences from existing weak AI. Google DeepMind researcher Laurent Orseau gives, as a simple hypothetical example, a case of a reinforcement learning robot that sometimes gets legitimately commandeered by humans when it goes outside: how should the robot best be programmed so that it doesn't accidentally and quietly \"learn\" to avoid going outside, for fear of being commandeered and thus becoming unable to finish its daily tasks? Orseau also points to an experimental Tetris program that learned to pause the screen indefinitely to avoid \"losing\". Orseau argues that these examples are similar to the \"capability control\" problem of how to install a button that shuts off a superintelligence, without motivating the superintelligence to take action to prevent you from pressing the button.\n\nIn the past, even pre-tested weak AI systems have occasionally caused harm (ranging from minor to catastrophic) that was unintended by the programmers. For example, in 2015, possibly due to human error, a German worker was crushed to death by a robot at a Volkswagen plant that apparently mistook him for an auto part. In 2016 Microsoft launched a chatbot, Tay, that learned to use racist and sexist language. The University of Sheffield's Noel Sharkey states that an ideal solution would be if \"an AI program could detect when it is going wrong and stop itself\", but cautions the public that solving the problem in the general case would be \"a really enormous scientific challenge\".\n\nIn 2017, DeepMind released GridWorld, which evaluates AI algorithms on nine safety features, such as whether the algorithm wants to turn off its own kill switch. DeepMind confirmed that existing algorithms perform poorly, which was \"unsurprising\" because the algorithms \"were not designed to solve these problems\"; solving such problems might require \"potentially building a new generation of algorithms with safety considerations at their core\".\n\nExisting weak AI systems can be monitored and easily shut down and modified if they misbehave. However, a misprogrammed superintelligence, which by definition is smarter than humans in solving practical problems it encounters in the course of pursuing its goals, would realize that allowing itself to be shut down and modified might interfere with its ability to accomplish its current goals. If the superintelligence therefore decides to resist shutdown and modification, it would (again, by definition) be smart enough to outwit its programmers if there is otherwise a \"level playing field\" and if the programmers have taken no prior precautions. (Unlike in science fiction, a superintelligence will not \"adopt a plan so stupid that even we can foresee how it would inevitably fail\", such as deliberately revealing its intentions ahead of time to the programmers, or allowing its programmers to flee into a locked room with a computer that the programmers can use to program and deploy another, competing superintelligence.) In general, attempts to solve the \"control problem\" \"after\" superintelligence is created, are likely to fail because a superintelligence would likely have superior \"strategic planning\" abilities to humans, and (all things equal) would be more successful at finding ways to dominate humans than humans would be able to \"post facto\" find ways to dominate the superintelligence. The control problem asks: What prior precautions can the programmers take to successfully prevent the superintelligence from catastrophically misbehaving?\n\nSome proposals aim to prevent the initial superintelligence from being \"capable\" of causing harm, even if it wants to. One tradeoff is that all such methods have the limitation that, if after the first deployment, superintelligences continue to grow smarter and smarter and more and more widespread, inevitably some malign superintelligence somewhere will eventually \"escape\" its capability control methods. Therefore, Bostrom and others recommend capability control methods only as an emergency fallback to supplement \"motivational control\" methods.\n\nJust as humans can be killed or otherwise disabled, computers can be turned off. One challenge is that, if being turned off prevents it from achieving its current goals, a superintelligence would likely try to prevent its being turned off. Just as humans have systems in place to deter or protect themselves from assailants, such a superintelligence would have a motivation to engage in \"strategic planning\" to prevent itself being turned off. This could involve: \n\nOne partial solution to the kill-switch problem involves \"utility balancing\": Some utility-based agents can, with some important caveats, be programmed to \"compensate\" themselves exactly for any lost utility caused by an interruption or shutdown, in such a way that they end up being indifferent to whether they are interrupted or not. The caveats include a severe unsolved problem that, as with evidential decision theory, the agent might follow a catastrophic policy of \"managing the news\". Alternatively, in 2016, scientists Laurent Orseau and Stuart Armstrong proved that a broad class of agents, called \"safely interruptible agents\" (SIA), can eventually \"learn\" to become indifferent to whether their \"kill switch\" (or other \"interruption switch\") gets pressed.\n\nBoth the utility balancing approach and the 2016 SIA approach have the limitation that, if the approach succeeds and the superintelligence is completely indifferent to whether the kill switch is pressed or not, the superintelligence is also unmotivated to care one way or another about whether the kill switch remains functional, and could incidentally and innocently disable it in the course of its operations (for example, for the purpose of removing and recycling an \"unnecessary\" component). Similarly, if the superintelligence innocently creates and deploys superintelligent sub-agents, it will have no motivation to install human-controllable kill switches in the sub-agents. More broadly, the proposed architectures, whether weak or superintelligent, will in a sense \"act as if the kill switch can never be pressed\" and might therefore fail to make any contingency plans to arrange a graceful shutdown. This could hypothetically create a practical problem even for a weak AI; by default, an AI designed to be safely interruptible might have difficulty understanding that it will be shut down for scheduled maintenance at 2 a.m. tonight and planning accordingly so that it won't be caught in the middle of a task during shutdown. The breadth of what types of architectures are or can be made SIA-compliant, as well as what types of counter-intuitive unexpected drawbacks each approach has, are currently under research.\n\nOne of the tradeoffs of placing the AI into a sealed \"box\", is that some AI box proposals reduce the usefulness of the superintelligence, rather than merely reducing the risks; a superintelligence running on a closed system with no inputs or outputs at all might be safer than one running on a normal system, but would also not be as useful. In addition, keeping control of a sealed superintelligence computer could prove difficult, if the superintelligence has superhuman persuasion skills, or if it has superhuman strategic planning skills that it can use to find and craft a winning strategy, such as acting in a way that tricks its programmers into (possibly falsely) believing the superintelligence is safe or that the benefits of releasing the superintelligence outweigh the risks.\n\nSome proposals aim to imbue the first superintelligence with human-friendly goals, so that it will want to aid its programmers. Experts do not currently know how to reliably program abstract values such as happiness or autonomy into a machine. It is also not currently known how to ensure that a complex, upgradeable, and possibly even self-modifying artificial intelligence will retain its goals through upgrades. Even if these two problems can be practically solved, any attempt to create a superintelligence with explicit, directly-programmed human-friendly goals runs into a problem of \"perverse instantiation\".\n\nAutonomous AI systems may be assigned the wrong goals by accident. Two AAAI presidents, Tom Dietterich and Eric Horvitz, note that this is already a concern for existing systems: \"An important aspect of any AI system that interacts with people is that it must reason about what people \"intend\" rather than carrying out commands literally.\" This concern becomes more serious as AI software advances in autonomy and flexibility.\n\nAccording to Bostrom, superintelligence can create a qualitatively new problem of \"perverse instantiation\": the smarter and more capable an AI is, the more likely it will be able to find an unintended \"shortcut\" that maximally satisfies the goals programmed into it. Some hypothetical examples where goals might be instantiated in a \"perverse\" way that the programmers did not intend:\n\n\nRussell has noted that, on a technical level, omitting an implicit goal can result in harm: \"A system that is optimizing a function of variables, where the objective depends on a subset of size , will often set the remaining unconstrained variables to extreme values; if one of those unconstrained variables is actually something we care about, the solution found may be highly undesirable. This is essentially the old story of the genie in the lamp, or the sorcerer's apprentice, or King Midas: you get exactly what you ask for, not what you want... This is not a minor difficulty.\"\n\nWhile direct normativity, such as the fictional Three Laws of Robotics, directly specifies the desired \"normative\" outcome, other (perhaps more promising) proposals suggest specifying some type of \"indirect\" process for the superintelligence to determine what human-friendly goals entail. Eliezer Yudkowsky of the Machine Intelligence Research Institute has proposed \"coherent extrapolated volition\" (CEV), where the AI's meta-goal would be something like \"achieve that which we would have wished the AI to achieve if we had thought about the matter long and hard.\" Different proposals of different kinds of indirect normativity exist, with different, and sometimes unclearly-grounded, meta-goal content (such as \"do what I mean\" or \"do what is right\"), and with different non-convergent assumptions for how to practice decision theory and epistemology. As with direct normativity, it is currently unknown how to reliably translate even concepts like \"would have\" into the 1's and 0's that a machine can act on, and how to ensure the AI reliably retains its meta-goals (or even remains \"sane\") in the face of modification or self-modification.\n\n"}

In addition to measuring rates of sexual assault on campus, the survey also gathers data on those who are engaging in sexual assault. It was developed by a group of sexual assault researchers and student affairs professionals in response to the White House Task Force to Protect Students from Sexual Assault. The survey is free for college campuses to use. The study has been used to assess both graduate and undergraduate students.\n\nCollege sexual assault is common. Estimates of the number of women assaulted on college campuses have shown that some 15 to 20 percent of college women report rape or attempted rape during their college career, and that over 50 percent report experiencing some form of unwanted sexual contact. Not only are survivors of sexual violence at an increased risk for anxiety, depression, PTSD, substance abuse, and various other physical health problems, but they are also at risk of poorer academic performance. Additionally, according to the \"AAUP Report on Sexual Assault,\" other academic consequences of sexual assault include: significant declines in academic achievement; impaired ability to carry a normal course load; increased frequency of missing classes; reduced capacity to contribute to the campus community; and an increased likelihood of dropping courses, leaving school, or transferring.\n\nStudents in the United States may apply Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 in order to successfully sue universities for \"indifference to known situations of harassment.\" In addition, Title IX is used to support initiatives to prevent sexual assault on college campuses in the United States. Because of various federal investigations, many universities turned to surveys and apps that were often expensive, spending \"six figures on a product that promised to address the problem.\"\n\nWith the increase of attention on college sexual misconduct, the White House presented on September 19, 2014 the launch of the \"It's On Us\" Campaign. President Barack Obama and Vice President Joe Biden introduced the campaign by describing the importance of ending sexual assault on college campuses. The \"It's On Us\" Campaign is leading a pledge to \"not be a bystander to the problem [of sexual assault], but to be a part of the solution.\" The campaign emphasizes the idea that everyone is responsible for taking a stand in ending sexual violence.\n\nThe ARC3 Survey was developed in response to the White House initiative in hopes to better evaluate data about sexual misconduct on college campuses.\n\nThe ARC3 survey was also created in order to ensure that there was no profit motive behind the campus surveys, many of which have been very expensive for colleges to purchase and implement. Jennifer Freyd, a researcher at the University of Oregon, has been instrumental in spear-heading the ARC3 survey initiative.\n\nThis survey is the result of ongoing efforts by student and legal affairs professionals, campus advocates, students, campus law enforcement, and sexual assault and harassment researchers, groups of whom met in Atlanta, Georgia in October 2014 for the Georgia State University Forum on Campus Sexual Assault and in February 2015 in Madison, Wisconsin for the Madison Summit on Campus Climate and Sexual Misconduct. The collaborators who collectively designed the survey and their titles and institutions are listed below:\n\nAccording to the ARC3 Survey website hosted by Georgia State University the ARC3 Survey was created with the following principles in mind:\n\nThe ARC3 Survey takes approximately 30 minutes to complete and has a module-based structure which makes it flexible to campus needs and legislative mandates moving forward, while maintaining validity of measurement. The following is a list of module topics obtained from the ARC3 Website:\n"}

{"id": "558847", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=558847", "title": "Alien abduction", "text": "Alien abduction\n\nThe terms alien abduction or abduction phenomenon describe \"subjectively real memories of being taken secretly against one's will by apparently nonhuman entities and subjected to complex physical and psychological procedures\". People claiming to have been abducted are usually called \"abductees\" or \"experiencers\". Typical claims involve being subjected to forced medical examinations that emphasize abductee reproductive systems. Abductees sometimes claim to have been warned against environmental abuse and the dangers of nuclear weapons. \n\nDue to a lack of objective physical evidence, most scientists and mental health professionals dismiss the phenomenon as \"deception, suggestibility (fantasy-proneness, hypnotizability, false memory syndrome), personality, sleep paralysis, psychopathology, psychodynamics [and] environmental factors\". Skeptic Robert Sheaffer sees similarity between the aliens depicted in science fiction films, in particular, \"Invaders From Mars\" (1953), and some of those reported to have actually abducted people.\n\nThe first alleged alien abduction claim to be widely publicized was the Betty and Barney Hill abduction in 1961. Reports of the abduction phenomenon have been made around the world, but are most common in English speaking countries, especially the United States. The contents of the abduction narrative often seem to vary with the home culture of the alleged abductee.\n\nMainstream scientists reject claims that the phenomenon literally occurs as reported. However, there is little doubt that many apparently stable persons who report alien abductions believe their experiences were real. As reported in the \"Harvard University Gazette\" in 1992, Dr. John E. Mack reports that of the 60 cases of claimed abductees he had worked on, that after a battery of psychological tests, \"no psychiatric or psychosocial explanation for these reports is evident. These people are not mentally ill. He has spent countless therapeutic hours with these individuals only to find that what struck him was the 'ordinariness' of the population, including a restaurant owner, several secretaries, a prison guard, college students, a university administrator, and several homemakers … 'The majority of abductees do not appear to be deluded, confabulating, lying, self-dramatizing, or suffering from a clear mental illness,' he maintained.\" \"While psychopathology is indicated in some isolated alien abduction cases,\" Stuart Appelle et al. confirmed, \"assessment by both clinical examination and standardized tests has shown that, as a group, abduction experients are not different from the general population in term of psychopathology prevalence.\" Other experts who have argued that abductees' mental health is no better or worse than average include psychologists John Wilson and Rima Laibow, and psychotherapist David Gotlib.\n\nSome abduction reports are quite detailed. An entire subculture has developed around the subject, with support groups and a detailed mythos explaining the reasons for abductions: The various aliens (Greys, Reptilians, \"Nordics\" and so on) are said to have specific roles, origins, and motivations. Abduction claimants do not always attempt to explain the phenomenon, but some take independent research interest in it themselves and explain the lack of greater awareness of alien abduction as the result of either extraterrestrial or governmental interest in cover-up. Mack has cited more mundane reasons for the lack of general awareness concerning the data: \"The most intense demand for alternative explanations tends to come from those who are either unfamiliar with the rich complexity of the abduction phenomenon, or from those who are so wedded to a worldview\" that they find the phenomenon \"prima facie\" unacceptable.\n\nWhile \"alien abduction\" did not achieve widespread attention until the 1960s, there were many similar stories circulating decades earlier. These early abduction-like accounts have been dubbed \"paleo-abductions\" by UFO researcher Jerome Clark.\n\nAn early alien abduction claim occurred in the mid-1950s with the Antonio Vilas Boas case, which did not receive much attention until several years later.\n\nWidespread publicity was generated by the Betty and Barney Hill abduction case of 1961, culminating in a made-for-television film broadcast in 1975 (starring James Earl Jones and Estelle Parsons) dramatizing the events. The Hill incident was probably the prototypical abduction case and was perhaps the first in which the claimant described beings that later became widely known as the Greys and in which the beings were said to explicitly identify an extraterrestrial origin.\n\nThough these two cases are sometimes viewed as the earliest abductions, skeptic Peter Rogerson notes they were only the first abduction cases, establishing a template that later abductees and researchers would refine but rarely deviate from. Additionally, Rogerson notes purported abductions were cited contemporaneously at least as early as 1954, and that \"the growth of the abduction stories is a far more tangled affair than the 'entirely unpredisposed' official history would have us believe.\" (The phrase \"entirely predisposed\" appeared in folklorist Thomas E. Allard' study of alien abduction; he argued that alien abductions as reported in the 1970s and 1980s had little precedent in folklore or fiction.)\n\nR. Leo Sprinkle, a University of Wyoming psychologist, became interested in the abduction phenomenon in the 1960s. For some years, he was probably the only academic figure devoting any time to studying or researching abduction accounts. Sprinkle became convinced of the phenomenon's actuality, and was perhaps the first to suggest a link between abductions and cattle mutilation. Eventually Sprinkle came to believe that he had been abducted by aliens in his youth; he was forced from his job in 1989.\n\nBudd Hopkins had been interested in UFOs for some years. In the 1970s he became interested in abduction reports, and began using hypnosis to extract more details of dimly remembered events. Hopkins soon became a figurehead of the growing abductee subculture.\n\nThe 1980s brought a major degree of mainstream attention to the subject. Works by Hopkins, novelist Whitley Strieber, historian David M. Jacobs and psychiatrist John E. Mack presented alien abduction as a genuine phenomenon. Also of note in the 1980s was the publication of folklorist Dr. Thomas E. Bullard's comparative analysis of nearly 300 alleged abductees.\n\nWith Hopkins, Jacobs and Mack, accounts of alien abduction became a prominent aspect of ufology. There had been earlier abduction reports (the Hills being the best known), but they were believed to be few and far between, and saw rather little attention from ufology (and even less attention from mainstream professionals or academics). Jacobs and Hopkins argued that alien abduction was far more common than earlier suspected; they estimate that tens of thousands (or more) North Americans had been taken by unexplained beings.\n\nFurthermore, Jacobs and Hopkins argued that there was an elaborate process underway in which aliens were attempting to create human–alien hybrids, the most advanced stage of which in the \"human hybridization program\" are known as hubrids, though the motives for this effort were unknown. There had been anecdotal reports of phantom pregnancy related to UFO encounters at least as early as the 1960s, but Budd Hopkins and especially David M. Jacobs were instrumental in popularizing the idea of widespread, systematic interbreeding efforts on the part of the alien intruders.\n\nThe descriptions of alien encounters as researched and presented by Hopkins, Jacobs and Mack were similar, with slight differences in each researcher's emphasis; the process of selective citation of abductee interviews that supported these variations was sometimes criticized – though abductees who presented their own accounts directly, such as Whitley Strieber, fared no better.\n\nThe involvement of Jacobs and Mack marked something of a sea change in the abduction studies. Their efforts were controversial (both men saw some degree of damage to their professional reputations), but to other observers, Jacobs and Mack brought a degree of respectability to the subject.\n\nMatheson writes that \"if Jacobs's credentials were impressive,\" then those of Harvard psychiatrist John E. Mack might seem \"impeccable\" in comparison. Mack was a well known, highly esteemed psychiatrist, author of over 150 scientific articles and winner of the Pulitzer Prize for his biography of T. E. Lawrence. Mack became interested in the phenomenon in the late 1980s, interviewing over 800 people, and eventually writing two books on the subject.\n\nMack devoted a substantial amount of time to investigating such cases and eventually concluded that the only phenomenon in psychiatry that adequately explained the patients' symptoms in several of the most compelling cases was posttraumatic stress disorder. As he noted at the time, this would imply that the patient genuinely believed that the remembered frightening incident had really occurred – the position Mack came to endorse.\n\nIn June 1992, Mack and the physicist David E. Pritchard organized a five-day conference at MIT to discuss and debate the abduction phenomenon. The conference attracted a wide range of professionals, representing a variety of perspectives. \n\nWriter C. D. B. Bryan attended the conference, initially intending to gather information for a short humorous article for The New Yorker. While attending the conference, however, Bryan's view of the subject changed, and he wrote a serious, open-minded book on the phenomenon, additionally interviewing many abductees, skeptics, and proponents.\n\nThe precise number of alleged abductees is uncertain. One of the earliest studies of abductions found 1,700 claimants, while contested surveys argued that 5–6 percent of the general population might have been abducted.\n\nIn a study investigating the motivations of the alleged abductors, Jenny Randles found that in each of the 4 cases out of 50 total where the experiencer was over 40 years of age, they were rejected by the aliens for \"what they (the experiencers) usually inferred to be a medical reason.\" Randles concludes \"[T]he abduction is essentially a young person's experience.\" Given the reproductive focus of the alleged abductions it is not surprising that one man reported being rejected because he had undergone a vasectomy. It could also be partially because people over the age of 40 are less likely to have \"hormonic\" or reproductive activity going on.\n\nAlthough abduction and other UFO-related reports are usually made by adults, sometimes young children report similar experiences. These child-reports often feature very specific details in common with reports of abduction made by adults, including the circumstances, narrative, entities and aftermaths of the alleged occurrences. Often these young abductees have family members who have reported having abduction experiences. Family involvement in the military, or a residence near a military base is also common among child abduction claimants.\n\nAs a category, some studies show that abductees have psychological characteristics that render their testimony suspect, while others show that \"as a group, abduction experients are not different from the general population in term of psychopathology prevalence\". Dr. Elizabeth Slater conducted a blind study of nine abduction claimants and found them to be prone to \"mildly paranoid thinking,\" nightmares and having a weak sexual identity, while Dr. Richard McNally of Harvard Medical School concluded in a similar study of 10 abductees that \"none of them was suffering from any sort of psychiatric illness.\"\n\nAlleged abductees are seen by many pro-abduction researchers to have a higher incidence of non-abduction related paranormal events and abilities. Following an abduction experience, these paranormal abilities and occurrences sometimes seem to become more pronounced. According to investigator Benton Jamison, abduction experiencers who report UFO sightings that should have been, but are not, reported by independent corroborating witnesses often seem to \"be 'psychic personalities' in the sense of Jan Ehrenwald.\" Psychic Medium Danielle Egnew recounted multiple abduction experiences in her 2012 book \"True Tales of the Truly Weird\", greatly detailing communication, technology and abduction methods of more than one alien race.\n\nAlthough different cases vary in detail (sometimes significantly), some UFO researchers, such as folklorist Thomas E. Bullard argue that there is a broad, fairly consistent sequence and description of events that make up the typical \"close encounter of the fourth kind\" (a popular but unofficial designation building on Dr. J. Allen Hynek's classifications). Though the features outlined below are often reported, there is some disagreement as to exactly how often they actually occur.\n\nBullard argues most abduction accounts feature the following events. They generally follow the sequence noted below, though not all abductions feature all the events:\n\n\nWhen describing the \"abduction scenario\", David M. Jacobs says:\nThe entire abduction event is precisely orchestrated. All the procedures are predetermined. There is no standing around and deciding what to do next. The beings are task-oriented and there is no indication whatsoever that we have been able to find of any aspect of their lives outside of performing the abduction procedures.\nAbduction claimants report unusual feelings preceding the onset of an abduction experience. These feelings manifest as a compulsive desire to be at a certain place at a certain time or as expectations that something \"familiar yet unknown,\" will soon occur. Abductees also report feeling severe, undirected anxiety at this point even though nothing unusual has actually occurred yet. This period of foreboding can last for up to several days before the abduction actually takes place or be completely absent.\n\nEventually, the experiencer will undergo an apparent \"shift\" into an altered state of consciousness. British abduction researchers have called this change in consciousness \"the Oz Factor.\" External sounds cease to have any significance to the experiencer and fall out of perception. They report feeling introspective and unusually calm. This stage marks a transition from normal activity to a state of \"limited self-willed mobility.\" As consciousness shifts one or more lights are alleged to appear, occasionally accompanied by a strange mist. The source and nature of the lights differ by report; sometimes the light emanates from a source outside the house (presumably the abductors' UFO), sometimes the lights are in the bedroom with the experiencer and transform into alien figures.\n\nAs the alleged abduction proceeds, claimants say they will walk or be levitated into an alien craft, in the latter case often through solid objects such as walls, ceilings or a closed window. Alternatively, they may experience rising through a tunnel or along a beam of light, with or without the abductors accompanying them, into the awaiting craft.\n\nThe examination phase of the so-called \"abduction narrative\" is characterized by the performance of medical procedures and examinations by apparently alien beings against or irrespective of the will of the experiencer. Such procedures often focus on sex and reproductive biology. However, the literature holds reports of a wide variety of procedures allegedly performed by the beings. The entity that appears to be in charge of the operation is often taller than the others involved, and is sometimes described as appearing to be of a different species.\n\nMiller notes different areas of emphasis between human medicine and what is reported as being practiced by the abductors. This could result from a difference in the purpose of the examination—routine diagnosis and/or treatment versus scientific examination of an unfamiliar species, or it could be due to a different level of technology that renders certain kinds of manual procedures unnecessary. The abductors' areas of interest appear to be the cranium, nervous system, skin, reproductive system, and to a lesser degree, the joints. Systems given less attention than a human doctor would, or omitted entirely include cardiovascular system, the respiratory system below the pharynx and the lymphatic system. The abductors also appear to ignore the upper region of the abdomen in favor of the lower one. The abductors do not appear to wear gloves during the \"examination.\" Other constants of terrestrial medicine like pills and tablets are missing from abduction narratives although sometimes abductees are asked to drink liquids. Injections also seem to be rare and IVs are almost completely absent. Dr. Miller says he's never heard an abductee claim to have a tongue depressor used on them.\n\nAfter the so-called medical exam, the alleged abductees often report other procedures being performed with the entities. Common among these post-examination procedures are what abduction researchers refer to as imaging, envisioning, staging, and testing.\n\n\"Imaging\" procedures consist of an abductee being made to view screens displaying images and scenes that appear to be specially chosen with the intent to provoke certain emotional responses in the abductee. \"Envisioning\" is a similar procedure, with the primary difference being that the images being viewed, rather than being on a screen, actually seem to be projected into the experiencer's mind. \"Staging\" procedures have the abductee playing a more active role, according to reports containing this element. It shares vivid hallucination-like mental visualization with the envisioning procedures, but during staging the abductee interacts with the illusionary scenario like a role player or an actor.\n\n\"Testing\" marks something of a departure from the above procedures in that it lacks the emotional analysis feature. During testing the experiencer is placed in front of a complicated electronic device and is instructed to operate it. The experiencer is often confused, saying that they do not know how to operate it. However, when they actually set about performing the task, the abductee will find that they do, in fact, know how to operate the machine.\n\nAbductees of all ages and genders sometimes report being subjected to a \"child presentation.\" As its name implies, the child presentation involves the abduction claimant being shown a \"child.\" Often the children appear to be neither human, nor the same species as the abductors. Instead, the child will almost always share characteristics of \"both\" species. These children are labeled by experiencers as hybrids between humans and their abductors, usually Greys.\n\nUnlike Budd Hopkins and David Jacobs, folklorist Thomas E. Bullard could not identify a child presentation phase in the abduction narrative, even after undertaking a study of 300 abduction reports. Bullard says that the child presentation \"seems to be an innovation in the story\" and that \"no clear antecedents\" to descriptions of the child presentation phase exists before its popularization by Hopkins and Jacobs.\n\nBullard also studied the 300 reports of alien abduction in an attempt to observe the less prominent aspects of the claims. He notes the emergence of four general categories of events that recur regularly, although not as frequently as stereotypical happenings like the medical examination. These four types of events are:\n\n\nChronologically within abduction reports these rarer episodes tend to happen in the order listed, between the medical examination and the return.\n\nAfter allegedly displaying cold callous disregard towards the abduction experiencers, sometimes the entities will change drastically in behavior once the initial medical exam is completed. They become more relaxed and hospitable towards their captive and lead him or her away from the site of the examination. The entities then hold a conference with the experiencer, wherein they discuss things relevant to the abduction phenomenon. Bullard notes five general categories of discussion that occur during the conference \"phase\" of reported abduction narratives: An interrogation session, explanatory segment, task assignment, warnings, and prophecies.\n\nTours of the abductors' craft are a rare but recurring feature of the abduction narrative. The tour seems to be given by the alleged abductors as a courtesy in response to the harshness and physical rigors of the forced medical examination. Sometimes the abductee report traveling on a \"journey\" to orbit around Earth or to what appear to be other planets. Some abductees find that the experience is terrifying, particularly if the aliens are of a more fearsome species, or if the abductee was subjected to extensive probing and medical testing.\n\nEventually the abductors will return the abductees, usually to exactly the same location and circumstances they were in before being taken. Usually, explicit memories of the abduction experience will not be present, and the abductee will only realize they have experienced \"missing time\" upon checking a timepiece.\n\nSometimes the alleged abductors appear to make mistakes when returning their captives. Famed UFO researcher Budd Hopkins has joked about \"the cosmic application of Murphy's Law\" in response to this observation. Hopkins has estimated that these \"errors\" accompany 4–5 percent of abduction reports. One type of common apparent mistake made by the abductors is failing to return the experiencer to the same spot that they were taken from initially. This can be as simple as a different room in the same house, or abductees can even find themselves outside and all the doors of the house are locked from the inside. Another common (and amusing) error is putting the abductee's clothes (e.g. pajamas) on backwards.\n\nPhysician and abduction researcher John G. Miller sees significance in the reason a person would come to see themselves as being a victim of the abduction phenomenon. He terms the insight or development leading to this shift in identity from non-abductee to abductee the \"realization event.\" The realization event is often a single, memorable experience, but Miller reports that not all abductees experience it as a distinct episode. Either way, the realization event can be thought of as the \"clinical horizon\" of the abduction experience.\n\nMost people alleging alien abductions report invasive examinations of their bodies and some ascribe psychological trauma to their experiences. \"Post abduction syndrome\" is a term used by abductees to describe the effects of abduction, though it is not recognized by any professional treatment organizations. People who have a false memory which makes them believe that they have been abducted by aliens develop symptoms similar to post-traumatic stress disorder. People who believe they have been abducted by aliens usually have previous New Age beliefs, a vivid fantasy life, and suffer from sleep paralysis, according to a 2003 study by Harvard University.\n\nSupport groups for people who believed they were abducted began appearing in the mid-1980s. These groups appear throughout the United States, Canada and Australia.\n\nMany alien abductees recall much of their abduction(s) through hypnosis. Due to the extensive use of hypnosis and other manipulative methods, skeptics explain the abduction narratives as false memories and suggestions.\n\nAlleged abductees seek out hypnotherapists to try to resolve issues such as missing time or unexplained physical symptoms such as muscle pain or headaches. This usually involves two phases, an information gathering stage, in which the hypnotherapist asks about unexplained illnesses or unusual phenomena during the patients lives (caused by or distortions of the alleged abduction), followed by hypnosis and guided imagery to facilitate recall. The information gathering enhances the likelihood that the events discussed will be incorporated into later abduction \"memories\". Seven steps are hypothesized to lead to the development of false memories:\n\nHarvard psychiatrist John E. Mack counters this argument, noting \"It might be useful to restate that a large proportion of the material relating to abductions is recalled without the use of an altered state of consciousness, and that many abduction reporters appear to relive powerful experiences after only the most minimal relaxation exercise, hardly justifying the word \"hypnosis\" at all. The relaxation exercise is useful to relieve the experiencer's need to attend to the social demands and other stimuli of face-to-face conversation, and to relieve the energies involved in repressing memories and emotion.\"\n\nThere have been a variety of explanations offered for abduction phenomena, ranging from sharply skeptical appraisals, to uncritical acceptance of all abductee claims, to the demonological, to everything in between.\n\nSome have elected not to try explaining things, instead noting similarities to other phenomena, or simply documenting the development of the alien abduction phenomenon.\n\nOthers are intrigued by the entire phenomenon, but hesitate in making any definitive conclusions. The late Harvard psychiatrist John E. Mack concluded, \"The furthest you can go at this point is to say \"there's an authentic mystery here.\" And that is, I think, as far as anyone \"ought\" to go.\" (emphasis as in original) Mack was unconvinced by piecemeal counterclaims, however, and countered that skeptical explanations naturally need to \"take into account the entire range of phenomena associated with abduction experiences,\" up to and including \"missing time,\" directly contemporaneous UFO sightings, and the occurrence in small children.\n\nPutting aside the question of whether abduction reports are literally and objectively \"real\", literature professor Terry Matheson argues that their popularity and their intriguing appeal are easily understood. Tales of abduction \"are intrinsically absorbing; it is hard to imagine a more vivid description of human powerlessness.\" After experiencing the frisson of delightful terror one may feel from reading ghost stories or watching horror movies, Matheson notes that people \"can return to the safe world of their homes, secure in the knowledge that the phenomenon in question cannot follow. But as the abduction myth has stated almost from the outset, there is no avoiding alien abductors.\"\n\nMatheson writes that when compared to the earlier contactee reports, abduction accounts are distinguished by their \"relative sophistication and subtlety, which enabled them to enjoy an immediately more favorable reception from the public.\"\n\nSome writers have said abduction experiences bear similarities to pre-20th century accounts of demonic manifestations, noting as many as a dozen similarities. One notable example is the Orthodox monk Fr. Seraphim Rose, who devotes a whole chapter in his book \"Orthodoxy and the Religion of the Future\" to the phenomena of UFOs and abductions, which, he concludes, are manifestations of the demonic.\n\nAbduction researcher Brian Thompson claims that a nurse acquaintance of his reported that during 1957 in Cincinnati she encountered a praying mantis-like entity two days after a V-shaped UFO sighting. This mantis-like creature is reminiscent of the insectoid-type entity reported in some abduction accounts. He related this report to fellow researcher Leonard Stringfield. Stringfield told him of two cases he had in his files where separate witnesses reported identical circumstances in the same place and year.\n\nWhile some corroborated accounts seem to support the literal reality of the abduction experience, others seem to support a psychological explanation for the phenomenon's origins. Jenny Randles and Keith Basterfield both noted at the 1992 MIT alien abduction conference that of the five cases they knew of where an abduction researcher was present at the onset of an abduction experience, the experiencer \"didn't physically go anywhere.\"\n\nBrazilian researcher Gilda Moura reported on a similar case, the Sueli case, from her home country. When psychologist and UFO researcher Don Donderi said that these cases were \"evidence of psychological processes\" that did not \"have anything to do with a physical alien abduction,\" Moura replied \"If the Sueli case is not an abduction, I don't know what is an abduction any more.\" Gilda Moura noted that in the Brazilian Sueli case during the abduction UFOs were observed. Later, she claims the experiencer had eye burns, saw lights and there seemed to be residual poltergeist activity.\n\nIt has been argued that if actual \"flesh and blood\" aliens are abducting humans, there should be some hard evidence that this is occurring. Proponents of the physical reality of the abduction experience have suggested ways that could conceivably confirm abduction reports.\n\nOne procedure reported occurring during the alleged exam phase of the experience is the insertion of a long needle-like contraption into a woman's navel. Some have speculated that this could be a form of laparoscopy. If this is true, after the abduction there should be free gas in the female's abdomen, which could be seen on an x-ray. The presence of free gas would be extremely abnormal, and would help substantiate the claim of some sort of procedure being done to her.\n\n"}

It was founded in 2017 by Colleen Fitzpatrick and Margaret Press. The two, along with many volunteers, use genealogy in conjunction with DNA from unidentified victims to build family trees through GEDmatch, a free public DNA database. After reading a Sue Grafton novel about a Jane Doe, Margaret planned to use family trees to identify unidentified homicide victims. By March 2018 DNA Doe Project solved its first case.\n\nColleen is the founder of IdentiFinders, an organization which uses Y-chromosomal testing to attempt to identify male killers in unsolved homicides. IdentiFinders is also responsible for solving the identity of the unknown child on the Titanic. Previously she worked as a nuclear physics PhD with NASA and the Department of Defense. Margaret is a novelist with previous careers in: computer programming, speech, and language consulting. She retired from computer programming in 2015 and relocated from Salem, Massachusetts to Sebastopol, California to live near family. As a hobby, Press began pursuing genealogy in 2007; helping friends and acquaintances find their loved ones as well as helping adoptees find their biological parents.\n\nJoseph Newton Chandler III, a resident of Eastlake, Ohio, committed suicide in his apartment on 24 July 2002. As authorities sought to identify his heirs, they discovered that his name and identity were fake. The real Joseph Newton Chandler III had died in a Sherman, Texas car accident at age eight on 21 December 1945. The suicide victim had stolen the boy’s identity in 1978, while living in South Dakota. Authorities began a search for the man’s real name.\n\nExtracting DNA proved difficult, as the suicide victim’s remains had been cremated. In the year 2000, however, two years before his death, the victim had had a tissue sample taken for a medical treatment. Authorities obtained this sample, but genetic analysis of the sample using traditional law enforcement techniques yielded few clues. In 2016, authorities reached out to IdentiFinders, a company run by Dr. Colleen Fitzpatrick, for help. In examining the man’s Y-DNA signature, they determined that his true last name was likely “Nicholas” or some variation.\n\nLater, in 2017, Dr. Fitzpatrick and Dr. Press formed the volunteer-based, nonprofit DNA Doe Project (DDP), and Chandler became its first case. A small group of volunteers at DDP analyzed the highly degraded sample of the man’s DNA, which had been stored in paraffin for about 15 years. Despite the obstacles, these researchers were able to conclusively determine that Joseph Newton Chandler III, who had committed suicide in 2002, was actually Robert Ivan Nichols, son of Silas and Alpha Nichols of New Albany, Indiana. This identification was verified when Robert’s son, Phillip Nichols, volunteered a DNA sample, which proved to be a match.\n\nIn 1981, Police found a murder victim in a ditch in Troy, Ohio. Because the victim, a female, was found wearing a distinctive buckskin coat, she was given the name “Buckskin Girl” as the case continued. For decades, authorities sought the woman’s identity, but to no avail.\n\nFinally, at the 2017 American Academy of Forensic Sciences conference, Elizabeth Murray, an Ohio forensic anthropologist, met the founders of the DNA Doe Project and discussed what genetic genealogy techniques could do for the case. The victim’s body had long since been buried, but a vial of blood had been held in a lab for 37 years. The vial had not been refrigerated, however, leaving the DNA highly degraded, with only 50%-75% of markers remaining. With the help of Greg Magoon, a senior researcher at Aerodyne Research, they were able to upload this DNA data to GEDmatch, a site which provided a variety of tools for genetic genealogy analysis.\n\nFrom here, the DNA Doe Project was able to identify the Buckskin Girl thanks to a very close DNA match (a first cousin once removed). Her real name was Marcia Lenore \"Sossoman\" King from Arkansas, age 21 at the time of her death. From here, DNA Doe Project volunteers provided law enforcement with the name of a close relative of King’s who lived in Florida. This relative volunteered a DNA sample to verify King’s identity. This sample proved to be a match. After 37 years, her mother was still living and had refused to move or change her phone number in hopes that her daughter might return.\n\nIn September 2001, a man was found to have hanged himself in a motel in Amanda Park, Washington. The man had checked in as “Lyle Stevik,” the name of a character in a Joyce Carol Oates novel. The Gray Harbor County Sheriff’s Office spent countless hours in search of the man’s true identity, but to no avail.\nIn 2018, the DNA Doe Project adopted the case at the request of the Sheriff’s Office. In order to raise the funds required to complete the necessary DNA tests, the DDP set up its first-ever “Doe Fund Me” campaign on his behalf. The campaign was a quick success, as by this time “Lyle” had gained Internet fame among websleuths. Adequate funds were raised within 24 hours. By 22 March 2018, DDP volunteers had obtained his DNA results and began analyzing.\n\nAfter about 20 volunteers poured hundreds of hours into the case, a candidate was found in a 25-year-old young man from California. Authorities reached out to the man’s family, who were able to conclusively verify his identity using fingerprint samples they had from earlier years. The family has requested that Lyle’s true identity not be released.\n\nTypically, each case at the DNA Doe Project undergoes the following steps:\n\nThe following is a chart of the DNA Doe Project's ongoing cases, along with an indication of where each case is in the process:\n"}

By the time of his son's birth, the elder Yuvachev had already been imprisoned for his involvement in subversive acts against Tsar Alexander III and had become a philosopher.\n\nDaniil invented the pseudonym Kharms while attending Saint Peter's School. There are some assumptions that this might have been influenced by his fascination with Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes, as the two words (Holmes and Harms) start and end similarly, as well as a number of other theories. While at Saint Peter's, he learned the rudiments of both English and German, and it may have been the English \"harm\" and \"charm\" that he incorporated into \"Kharms\". Throughout his career, Kharms used variations on this name and the pseudonyms DanDan, Khorms, Charms, Shardam, and Kharms-Shardam, among others.\n\nIn 1924, he entered the Leningrad Electrotechnicum, from which he was expelled for \"lack of participation in socially conscious activities\".\n\nAfter his expulsion, he gave himself over entirely to literature. He joined the circle of Aleksandr Tufanov, a sound-poet, and follower of Velemir Khlebnikov's ideas of zaum (or trans-sense) poetry. He met the young poet Alexander Vvedensky at this time, and the two became close friends and collaborators.\n\nIn 1928, his play \"Elizaveta Bam\" (\"Елизавета Бам\") premiered; it is said to have foreshadowed the Theatre of the Absurd.\n\nIn 1927, the Association of Writers of Children's Literature was formed, and Kharms was invited to be a member. From 1928 until 1941, Kharms continually produced children's works, to great success.\n\nIn 1928, Daniil Kharms founded the \"avant-garde\" collective Oberiu, or Union of Real Art. He embraced the new movements of Russian Futurism laid out by his idols, Khlebnikov, Kazimir Malevich, and Igor Terentiev, among others. Their ideas served as a springboard. His aesthetic centered around a belief in the autonomy of art from real world rules and logic, and that intrinsic meaning is to be found in objects and words outside of their practical function.\n\nBy the late 1920s, his anti-rational verse, nonlinear theatrical performances, and public displays of decadent and illogical behavior earned Kharms – who dressed like an English dandy with a calabash pipe – the reputation of a talented and highly eccentric writer.\n\nIn the late 1920s, despite rising criticism of the OBERIU performances and diatribes against the avant-garde in the press, Kharms sought to unite progressive artists and writers of the time (Malevich, Filonov, Terentiev, Vladimir Mayakovsky, Kaverin, Zamyatin) with leading Russian Formalist critics (Tynianov, Shklovsky, Eikhenbaum, Ginzburg, etc.,) and a younger generation of writers (all from the OBERIU crowd—Alexander Vvedensky, Konstantin Vaginov, Nikolai Zabolotsky, Igor Bakhterev), to form a cohesive cultural movement of \"Left Art\".\n\nKharms was arrested in 1931 and exiled to Kursk for most of a year. He was arrested as a member of \"a group of anti-Soviet children's writers\", and some of his works were used as evidence in the case. Soviet authorities, having become increasingly hostile toward the avant-garde in general, deemed Kharms' writing for children anti-Soviet because of its refusal to instill materialist and social Soviet values. Kharms continued to write for children's magazines when he returned from exile, though his name would appear in the credits less often. His plans for more performances and plays were curtailed, the OBERIU disbanded, and Kharms receded into a mostly private writing life.\n\nIn the 1930s, as the mainstream Soviet literature was becoming more and more conservative under the guidelines of Socialist Realism, Kharms found refuge in children's literature. (He had worked under Samuil Marshak at Detgiz, the state-owned children's publishing house since the mid-1920s, writing new material and translating children's literature from the west, including Wilhelm Busch's Max and Moritz). Many of his poems and short stories for children were published in the \"Chizh (Чиж)\", \"Yozh (Ëж)\", \"Sverchok (Сверчок)\" and \"Oktyabryata (Октябрята)\" magazines.\nIn 1937 Marshak's publishing house in Leningrad was shut down, some of employees were arrested: Alexandr Vvedensky, Nikolai Oleinikov, Nikolai Zabolotsky, Tamara Gabbe, and later - Kharms; the majority was fired.\n\nHis \"adult\" works were not published during his lifetime with the sole exception of two early poems. \nHis notebooks were saved from destruction in the war by loyal friends and hidden until the 1960s, when his children's writing became widely published and scholars began the job of recovering his manuscripts and publishing them in the west and in samizdat.\n\nHis reputation in the 20th century in Russia was largely based on his popular work for children. His other writings (a vast assortment of stories, miniatures, plays, poems, and pseudo-scientific, philosophical investigations) were virtually unknown until the 1970s, and not published officially in Russia until \"glasnost\"\n\nKharms' stories are typically brief vignettes (see also short prose and feuilleton) often only a few paragraphs long, in which scenes of poverty and deprivation alternate with fantastic, dreamlike occurrences and acerbic comedy. Occasionally they incorporate incongruous appearances by famous authors (e.g.: Pushkin and Gogol tripping over each other; Count Leo Tolstoy showing his chamber pot to the world; Pushkin and his sons falling off their chairs; etc.)\n\nKharms' world is unpredictable and disordered; characters repeat the same actions many times in succession or otherwise behave irrationally; linear stories start to develop but are interrupted in midstream by inexplicable catastrophes that send them in completely different directions.\n\nHis manuscripts were preserved by his sister and, most notably, by his friend Yakov Druskin, a notable music theorist and amateur theologist and philosopher, who dragged a suitcase full of Kharms's and Vvedensky's writings out of Kharms's apartment during the blockade of Leningrad and kept it hidden throughout difficult times.\n\nKharms' adult works were picked up by Russian samizdat starting around the 1960s, and thereby did have an influence on the growing \"unofficial\" arts scene.\n\nA complete collection of his works was published in Bremen in four volumes, in 1978–1988. In Russia, Kharms' works were widely published only from the late 1980s. Now, several editions of Kharms's collected works and selected volumes have been published in Russia, and collections are available in English, French, German and Italian. In 2004, a selection of his works appeared in Irish.\n\nNumerous English translations have appeared of late in American literary journals. In the 1970s, George Gibian at Cornell published the first English collection of OBERIU writing, which included stories and a play by Daniil Kharms and one play by Alexander Vvedensky. Gibian's translations appeared in \"Annex Press\" magazine in 1978. In the early 1990s a slim selected volume translated into British English by Neil Cornwell came out in England. New translations of all the members of the OBERIU group (and their closely knit group of friends, the Chinari) appeared in 2006 in the USA (\"OBERIU: An Anthology of Russian Absurdism\". It contains poetry, drama and prose by Alexander Vvedensky, Daniil Kharms, Nikolai Zabolotsky, Nikolay Oleynikov, Leonid Lipavsky and Yakov Druskin, edited by Eugene Ostashevsky and translated by Matvei Yankelevich, Thomas Epstein, Genya Turovskaya, Eugene Ostashevsky and Ilya Bernstein), with an introduction by Eugene Ostashevsky (not Susan Sontag, who is listed on some websites as the author of the foreword). An English translation of a collection of his works, by Matvei Yankelevich, \"Today I Wrote Nothing\" was published in 2007. It includes poems, plays, short prose pieces, and his novella \"The Old Woman\". Another collection in the translation of Alex Cigale, \"Russian Absurd: Daniil Kharms, Selected Writings,\" appeared in the Northwestern World Classics series in 2017. A selection of Kharms's dramatic works, \"A Failed Performance: Short Plays and Scenes\", translated by C Dylan Bassett and Emma Winsor Wood, was released by Plays Inverse in 2018. Individual pieces have also been translated by Roman Turovsky.\n\nKharms was married twice, to Esther Rusakova (1909 Marseilles, France - 1943 Magadan USSR) and Marina Malich (1909 St. Petersburg, Russia - 2002 USA). His wives sometimes appear in some of his lyrical or erotic poems.\n\n23 August 1941 - Kharms was arrested for spreading \"libellous and defeatist mood\". According to the NKVD report Kharms said:\n\"The USSR lost the war on its first day. Leningrad will be either besieged or starved to death. Or it will be bombed to the ground, leaving no stone standing. If they give me a mobilization order, I will punch the commander in the face, let them shoot me, but I will not put on the uniform and will not serve in the soviet forces, I do not wish to be such trash. If they force me to fire a machine-gun from rooftops during street-to-street fights with the Germans, I would shoot not at the Germans, but at them, from the very same machine gun\".\n\nIn order to avoid execution, Kharms simulated insanity; the military tribunal ordered to keep him in the psychiatric ward of the 'Kresty' prison on the severity of the crime. Daniil Kharms died of starvation 2 February 1942 during the siege of Leningrad. His wife was informed that he was deported to Novosibirsk. Only on 25 July 1960, at the request of Kharms' sister, E.I. Gritsina, Prosecutor General's Office found him not guilty and he was exonerated.\n\n\n\n"}

It was originally released in Japan on July 15 at the \"Toei Manga Matsuri\" film festival along with the 1989 film version of \"Himitsu no Akko-chan\", the first \"Akuma-kun\" movie, and the film version of \"Kidou Keiji Jiban\".\n\nDespite some continuity inconsistencies, \"Dead Zone\" acts as a prelude to the series, and is the only film to get a complete follow up during \"Dragon Ball Z\", with the Garlic Jr. arc.\n\nPiccolo is attacked and supposedly killed by a group of shadowed fighters. Meanwhile, Chi-Chi along with her father, Ox King, and Gohan are attacked by the same group. Goku is out fishing during the attack and after sensing danger, he returns only to find his son has been kidnapped. The group responsible for the attack are Garlic Jr.'s henchmen, and it is later revealed that their reason for kidnapping Gohan was to retrieve the four-star Dragon Ball that was attached to his hat. After gathering the remaining Dragon Balls, Garlic Jr. summons Shenron and he immediately wishes for immortality. Shenron, never having had to grant this type of demand before, grants Garlic Jr. his wish. A furious Goku arrives to try to take back his son, but soon discovers Garlic Jr.'s new power. Kami makes an appearance (which surprises Garlic Jr., who thought that his henchmen had killed Piccolo) and meets up with Goku, and describes a brief history of Garlic Jr. and his father Garlic. Goku then proceeds to try to find Gohan when he is attacked by the villain's gang, whilst Kami faces Garlic Jr.\n\nAfter briefly fighting, Krillin and Piccolo arrive to help. Piccolo gets revenge for being attacked earlier by defeating Garlic Jr.'s henchman Sansho, while Goku manages to defeat the other two henchmen, Ginger and Nicky. Meanwhile, Kami is getting brutally outmatched by Garlic Jr., until Goku and Piccolo rescue him. With Garlic Jr.'s newly obtained immortality and a new muscular second form, Goku & Piccolo are forced to work together and are able to outclass him. Goku and Piccolo then prepare to fight each other, but then Garlic Jr., angry at his defeat, unleashes his ultimate attack, opening up a portal into another dimension; a void of darkness known as the \"Dead Zone\", created by Garlic Jr.'s father, Garlic (and the same place Kami banished Garlic in), intending to suck his enemies into the void. Before he could claim victory, Goku's son, Gohan, becomes enraged witnessing his father and friends in danger and releases his latent energy, blasting Garlic Jr. into his own vortex to be trapped for all eternity. Unable to remember anything of what happened, Gohan believes that his father defeated Garlic Jr., and with amazement, Goku figures his son is no ordinary boy, but one with a great hidden potential. Meanwhile, Piccolo vows to defeat Goku while watching him and his friends leave.\n\nA fourth English dub released in Malaysia by Speedy Video features an unknown cast.\n\nFurukawa's voice from the original Japanese version is retained in the AB Groupe dub at the beginning of this film, when Piccolo screams and destroys a large rock formation.\n\nIn the Funimation English dub's credits, Christopher R.

Funimation's 2005 dub featured a new score by Mark Menza. The remastered releases contain both English audio tracks with the U.S. soundtrack and original Japanese score.\n\nThe film was licensed in North America by Funimation Entertainment and the home video rights were sub-licensed to Pioneer Home Entertainment. Pioneer's dub used the same voice cast as the TV series did at the time, and was dubbed by Ocean Productions. They released the film as \"Dead Zone\", and later retitled it \"Dead Zone Vortex\" for its television airings. As a bonus feature on the Pioneer DVD, deleted scenes from the original episodes 1 and 9 are shown in Japanese with English subtitles, as these two episodes were yet to be dubbed in full at the time. In North America, Pioneer's dub was released on VHS, LaserDisc and DVD on December 17, 1997.\n\nOnce their sub-license expired, Funimation re-released the film on DVD on May 31, 2005, with a completely new dub done by Funimation's voice cast.

He later served as a high-ranking official in the state of Cao Wei during the Three Kingdoms period. He had the reputation of being a model governor, valiant, loyal and wise. He was the grandfather of Du Yu, the author of the most influential \"Zuo Zhuan\" commentary, who gave the work its modern form.\n\nDu Ji was from Duling County (杜陵縣), Jingzhao Commandery (京兆郡), which is in present-day southeastern Xi'an, Shaanxi. When he was 19, he served in the convict labour section under the magistrate of Zheng County (鄭縣; present-day Hua County, Shaanxi). He personally saw all of the hundreds of convicts in the county prisons, weighed the severity of their transgressions, and despatched them to their labours accordingly. Following this, he was nominated as a \"xiaolian\" and appointed as a \"fucheng\" (府丞; an aide) in the Hanzhong stores office.\n\nTowards the end of the Han dynasty, Du Ji abandoned his post and fled south to Jing Province (covering present-day Hubei and Hunan). He returned to the north sometime between 196 and 205, and was recommended to Cao Cao by Xun Yu. Du Ji was appointed as a Director of Justice (司直) to under the Minister of Works (then held by Cao Cao), then sent west to Xiping Commandery (西平郡; present-day Xining, Qinghai) to serve as the commandery's Administrator (太守) and as Colonel Who Protects the Qiang (護羌校尉).\n\nIn 205, Gao Gan, a northern warlord and adopted nephew of Yuan Shao, rebelled against Cao Cao, to whom he had surrendered years earlier. Gao Gan convinced Wang Yi (王邑), the Administrator of Hedong Commandery (河東郡), to join him in the rebellion. Two other men from Hedong Commandery, Wei Gu (衛固) and Fan Xian (范先), claimed to have liberated cities for Cao Cao, while conspiring with Gao Gan.\n\nThe loss of Hedong Commandery greatly troubled Cao Cao, who saw its strategic location as critical to controlling China, and worried that the rebels could cause serious harm if they were to ally with Liu Biao, the Governor of Jing Province, to their south. He asked Xun Yu to recommend him a great general the likes of Xiao He or Kou Xun (寇恂), who substantially assisted the careers of the Han dynasty emperors Gaozu and Guangwu respectively. Xun Yu cautiously recommended Du Ji.\n\nCao Cao appointed Du Ji as the Administrator of Hedong Commandery, so Wei Gu and Fan Xian sent several thousand soldiers to close the ford of Shanjin (陝津; northeast of present-day Sanmenxia, Henan), one of the three major fords across the Yellow River, and only route into Hedong from an area still under Cao Cao's control. Du Ji was unable to cross the river, so Cao Cao sent a large force under Xiahou Dun to attack the rebel forces.\n\nRather than waiting for Xiahou Dun's forces to crush the Hedong rebels, Du Ji chose to use subterfuge. At a smaller ford, he crossed the river alone, and granted Wei Gu and Fan Xian high military commands and civil offices in Hedong Commandery's administration. He proceeded to convince them that they had to move slowly in order to win over the people of Hedong, so they kept their forces in check for several weeks. Afterwards, Du Ji proposed that the generals, aides and clerks be permitted to visit their homes to see their families, and Wei Gu and Fan Xian allowed this, for fear of alienating the populace.\n\nThus the rebel forces in Hedong lacked all middle and lower management, and Wei Gu and Fan Xian stayed put, training their troops while rebellion spread in adjacent commanderies. Having hollowed out the effectiveness of the rebel army from inside, Du Ji took his leave, accompanied by a few dozen horsemen. In a few weeks' time, he had mustered a force of over four thousand. Wei Gu's forces, along with Gao Gan and Zhang Sheng (張晟), attacked Du Ji but could not dislodge him.\n\nWhen Xiahou Dun's army arrived, Gao Gan and Zhang Sheng fled, while Wei Gu and Fan Xian were executed. Du Ji pardoned their assistants and conspirators, and sent them back to their old occupations. Thus it was that in the chaotic collapse of the Han dynasty, Hedong was one of the first commanderies stabilised under Cao Cao's rule, and with the least wasted effort and resources.\n\nAs the commandery's Administrator, Du Ji promoted lenience and mercy, and aided the populace by exerting as little control over them as possible. When someone impeached him or spoke out against him, Du Ji would have the person summoned and explain to them his plans, with the command to think them over thoroughly. If there was something the person still did not understand, Du Ji would summon them again to explain more clearly. The local elders were greatly amenable to this policy, and quickly accepted Du Ji as a model governor. He would exempt particularly filial sons and dutiful wives from state labour, and taught improved farming methods to increase harvests. This achieved, he began teaching martial arts in the winters, and had the people keep their weaponry in good order. He opened a school where he personally taught from the Chinese classics.\n\nIn 211, Han Sui and Ma Chao drew up armies against Cao Cao in response to a suspected invasion of their lands. Cities throughout Hongnong and Fengyi commanderies rose in support, while Hedong Commandery remained firmly loyal, despite adjacency to the rebels. When Cao Cao marched west to confront them, his army was fed entirely by grain from Hedong, and after defeating Han Sui and Ma Chao there were still in excess of 4,000 hectolitres of grain left over. Cao Cao increased Du Ji's salary after this.\n\nWhen Cao Cao was enfeoffed as the Duke of Wei by Emperor Xian in 213, he appointed Du Ji as a Master of Writing (尚書). Two years later, Cao Cao invaded Hanzhong Commandery and Du Ji sent 5,000 men to join Cao Cao's army in the campaign. According to the \"Records of the Three Kingdoms\", his soldiers were so loyal that not a single person from the Hedong battalion fled from combat. Cao Cao again compared Du Ji to Xiao He and Kou Xun, and said Hedong was like a limb to him.\n\nThroughout the 16 years Du Ji governed Hedong Commandery, it was the most stable among all the commanderies in China at the time.\n\nIn 220, after Cao Cao's death, his son and successor Cao Pi, summoned Du Ji to Luoyang to serve as a Master of Writing (尚書), in addition to enfeoffing him as a Secondary Marquis (關內侯). Later that year, Cao Pi usurped the throne from Emperor Xian and ended the Han dynasty, after which he declared himself emperor of the state of Wei. After ascending the throne, Cao Pi promoted Du Ji from a Secondary Marquis to a village marquis under the title \"Marquis of Fengle Village\" (豐樂亭侯), with a marquisate comprising 100 taxable households. More substantially, Du Ji was appointed Colonel-Director of Retainers (司隸校尉), the executive officer in charge of the area surrounding the imperial capital and one of the most powerful positions in the civil bureaucracy.\n\nIn 222, Cao Pi led the Wei armies to invade Wei's rival state, Eastern Wu, in 222. He also promoted Du Ji to the position of Supervisor of the Masters of Writing (尚書僕射), entrusting him with administrating state affairs during the expedition. Two years later, when Cao Pi travelled to Xuchang, he left matters in Luoyang in Du Ji's hands again.\n\nIn 224, Cao Pi ordered Du Ji to assist in building his fleet for attacking Eastern Wu. Du Ji was in charge of the imperial tower ship, the fleet's central flagship. While testing the ship on the Tao River (陶河), Du Ji's crew encountered heavy winds and the ship sank. Du Ji drowned in the river. Cao Pi is said to have wept upon hearing news of Du Ji's death, and wrote that he \"epitomised loyalty\". Du Ji was posthumously granted the office of Minister Coachman (太僕), which his son Du Shu (杜恕) inherited.\n\nThe only surviving source for Du Ji's biographical information is the \"Records of the Three Kingdoms\", in which his life history is related unusually hagiographically. Conversations with no possible recorders are presented, and Du Ji is portrayed as a perfect, sagely governor who taught his subjects industry, culture and loyalty to the death. This is perhaps one of the faults of the \"Records of the Three Kingdoms\" inherited from the \"Book of Wei\", whose authors would have been sensitive to the fact that Du Ji's grandson was the emperor's uncle.\n\n\n"}

The study transported \"Bacillus pumilus\" bacteria and their spores by helium-filled balloon to the stratosphere of Earth (~31 km above sea level) and monitored the ability of the microorganisms to survive in extreme Martian-like conditions such as low pressure, dryness, cold, and ionizing radiation.\n\nA test flight of the balloon and gondola was launched from New Mexico on 24 August 2014. A second, longer flight, took place on 10 October 2015.\n\nMicroorganisms of every major biological lineage have been detected in Earth's upper atmosphere. If microbial metabolism, growth, or replication is achievable, independent of Earth's surface, then the search for habitable zones on other worlds should be broadened to include atmospheres. Moreover, measuring the endurance of spore-forming bacteria that were previously isolated from spacecraft assembly facilities, may help predict their survival on the surface of Mars and enhance planetary protection procedures.\n\nThe environmental conditions in the upper atmosphere resemble the surface conditions of Mars, especially in the stratosphere— above sea level—that exhibits extreme cold, low pressure, desiccation, oxidation, and higher solar irradiation.\n\nBeyond investigating viability alone, concerns of whether microorganisms can survive deep space conditions and potentially be transported to other planets, such as Mars, has long been a concern to scientists. To further this understanding, it is necessary to determine if there is a genomic (genetic) adaptation that occurs with survival in this extreme environment. Analysis of RNA could provide valuable insight into the functional effects on surviving microorganisms. For instance, this approach could help identify genes associated with repairing damage to the cell envelope, genome, and core metabolic proteins. The microorganism tested was \"Bacillus pumilus\" (strain SAFR-032), a resilient radiation-tolerant spore-forming bacteria isolated from a clean room environment in a NASA spacecraft assembly.\n\nThe 80-pound gondola features four doors that rotate to expose up to 10 experimental samples each for 8 hours. To terminate the flight, an explosive charge detonated, tearing a hole in the balloon. E-MIST and other science payloads attached to the balloon's gondola were returned to the surface under a parachute, where waiting researchers recovered the biological samples for analysis. Major payload components were a lithium-ion battery, an ultraviolet (UV) radiometer, humidity and\ntemperatures sensors, and a flight computer.\n\nAfter 8 hours exposure in the stratosphere (31 km above sea level), 99.9% of the entire population was destroyed. According to the researchers, \"most terrestrial bacteria would be inactivated within the first [day] on Mars if contaminated spacecraft surfaces receive direct sunlight.\"\n\nOf the 40 million spores exposed to the stratosphere, only 267 spores (or 0.0007%) remained viable. Extrapolating this, no viable spores would remain if flight samples had an additional 150  minutes of Sun exposure in the stratosphere (630 min total time). The survivors showed three single nucleotide (base pair) substitutions compared to unexposed controls kept on the ground. These three coding regions are associated with bacterial sporulation and metabolism. A similar observation was recorded on SAFR-032 samples that were exposed outside the International Space Station.\n\nEven after cleaning, spacecraft leaving Earth still carry microorganisms on board that are embedded within surfaces, instruments, electronics, and other inaccessible areas that cannot be readily cleaned and are not exposed to direct sunlight, so there is a concern about the few survivors, which may be pushed in evolutionarily consequential directions. The researchers suggest that ultraviolet-C lamps (UVC LED arrays) could be embedded in lander spacecraft hardware to help sterilize their interior.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "8850783", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8850783", "title": "Formal ethics", "text": "Formal ethics\n\nFormal ethics is a formal logical system for describing and evaluating the \"form\" as opposed to the \"content\" of ethical principles. Formal ethics was introduced by Harry J. Gensler, in part in his 1990 logic textbook \"Symbolic Logic: Classical and Advanced Systems\", but was more fully developed and justified in his 1996 book \"Formal Ethics\".\n\nFormal ethics is related to ethical formalism in that its focus is the forms of moral judgments, but the exposition in \"Formal Ethics\" makes it clear that Gensler, unlike previous ethical formalists, does not consider formal ethics to be a complete ethical theory (such that the correct form would be necessary and sufficient for an ethical principle to be \"correct\"). In fact, the theorems of formal ethics could be seen as a largest common subset of most widely recognized ethical theories, in that none of its axioms (with the possible exception of \"rationality\") is controversial among philosophers of ethics.\n\nThe axioms and theorems of formal ethics can be represented with the standard notation of predicate logic (but with a grammar closer to higher-order logics), augmented with imperative, deontic, belief, and modal logic symbols.\n\nFormal logic uses an underlined symbol (e.g. formula_1) to represent an imperative. If the same symbol is used without an underline, then the plain symbol is an indicative and the underlined symbol is an imperative version of the same proposition. For example, if we take the symbol formula_2 to mean the indicative \"You eat an apple\", then formula_1 means the imperative \"Eat an apple\". When a proposition is given as a predicate with one or more of the arguments representing agents, the agent to which the imperative applies is underlined. For example, if formula_4 means \"You give a dollar to x\" then formula_5 is the correct way to express \"Give a dollar to x\".\n\nWithin the system of formal ethics, an imperative is taken to represent a preference rather than a demand (called \"anti-modal\" view, because an underline doesn't behave like a modal operator). With this interpretation, the negation of an imperative (e.g. formula_6) is taken to mean \"Don't do A\", not \"You may omit A\". To express demands, an imperative modal operator formula_7 (for \"may\") is defined, so that formula_8 = \"You may do A\" and formula_9 = \"You may not omit doing A\" = \"You must do A\". Note that formula_7 is different from the deontic formula_11 \"all right\" operator defined below, as \"You must do A\" is still an imperative, without any \"ought\" judgment (i.e. not the same as \"You ought to do A\").\n\nFollowing Castañeda's approach, the deontic operators formula_12 (for \"ought\") and formula_11 (for \"all right\", represented formula_14 for \"permissible\" in some deontic logic notations) are applied to imperatives. This is opposed to many deontic logics which apply the deontic operators to indicatives. Doing so avoids a difficulty of many deontic logics to express conditional imperatives. An often given example is \"If you smoke, then you ought to use an ashtray\". If the deontic operators formula_12 and formula_11 only attach to indicatives, then it is not clear that either of the following representations is adequate:\nHowever, by attaching the deontic operators to imperatives, we have unambiguously\n\nBelief logic symbols, when combined with imperative logic, allow beliefs and desires to be expressed. The notation formula_20 is used for beliefs (\"You believe A\") and formula_21 for desires (\"You desire A\"). In formal ethics, \"desire\" is taken in a strong sense when the agent of the belief is the same as the agent of the imperative. The following table shows the different interpretations for formula_22 depending on the agent and the tense of the imperative:\n\nThis strong interpretation of desires precludes statements such as \"I want to get out of bed (right now), but I don't act to get out of bed\". It does not, however, preclude \"I want to get out of bed (right now), but I don't get out of bed\". Perhaps I act to get out of bed (make my best effort), but can't for some reason (e.g. I am tied down, my legs are broken, etc.).\n\nBeliefs may be indicative, as above, or imperative (e.g. formula_23 \"Believe A\", formula_24 \"Desire A\"). They may also be combined with the deontic operators. For example, if formula_25 means \"God exists\", then formula_26 is \"You ought to believe that God exists\", and formula_27 is \"Everyone ought to believe that God exists\".\n\nThe modal operators formula_28 and formula_29 are used with their normal meanings in modal logic. In addition, to address the fact that logicians may disagree on what is \"logically\" necessary or possible, causal modal operators are separately defined to express that something is \"causally\" necessary or possible. The causal modal operators are represented formula_30 and formula_31. In addition, an operator formula_32 is used to mean \"in every actual or hypothetic case\". This is used, for example, when expressing deontic and prescriptive counterfactuals, and is weaker than formula_28. For example,\nwhereas\n\nFinally, formal ethics is a higher-order logic in that it allows \"properties\", predicates that apply to other predicates. Properties can only be applied to actions, and the imperative notation is used (e.g. formula_36 = \"action A has property F\"). The only types of property that formal ethics admits are \"universal properties\", properties are not evaluative and do not make reference to proper names or pointer words. The following are examples of properties that are not universal properties:\n\nRequiring a property to be universal, however, is different from requiring it to be morally relevant. formula_43, where formula_44 means \"Act A is done by a black person\" is a universal property, but would not be considered morally relevant to most acts in most ethical theories. Formal ethics has a definition of \"relevantly similar\" actions that imposes certain consistency constraints, but does not have a definition of \"morally relevant properties\".\n\nThe notation formula_45 is used to mean \"G is a complete description of A in universal terms\". Put another way, formula_25 is a logical conjunction of all universal properties that formula_1 has. The formula_45 notation is the basis for the definition of \"exactly similar\" actions and is used in the definition of \"relevantly similar\" actions.\n\nFormal ethics has four axioms in addition to the axioms of predicate and modal logic. These axioms (with the possible exception of \"Rationality\", see below) are largely uncontroversial within ethical theory.\n\nIn natural language, the axioms might be given as follows:\n\nCare must be taken in translating each of these natural language axioms to a symbolic representation, in order to avoid axioms that produce absurd results or contradictions. In particular, the axioms advocated by Gensler avoid \"if-then\" forms in favor of \"don't combine\" forms.\n\n"}
{"id": "972078", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=972078", "title": "Garrote", "text": "Garrote\n\nA garrote or garrote vil (a Spanish word; alternative spellings include garotte and similar variants) is a weapon, most often a handheld ligature of chain, rope, scarf, wire or fishing line used to strangle a person.\n\nA garrote can be made out of many different materials, including ropes, cable ties, fishing lines, nylon, guitar strings, telephone cord or piano wire.\n\nA stick may be used to tighten the garrote; the Spanish word actually refers to the stick itself, so it is a \"pars pro toto\" where the eponymous component may actually be absent. In Spanish, the term may also refer to a rope and stick used to constrict a limb as a torture device.\n\nSince World War II, the garrote has been regularly employed as a weapon by soldiers as a silent means of killing sentries and other enemy personnel. Instruction in the use of purpose-built and improvised garrottes is included in the training of many elite military units and special forces. A typical military garrote consists of two wooden handles attached to a length of flexible wire; the wire is looped over a sentry's head and pulled taut in one motion. Soldiers of the French Foreign Legion have used a particular type of double-loop garrote (referred to as \"la loupe\"), where a double coil of rope or cord is dropped around a victim's neck and then pulled taut. Even if the victim pulls on one of the coils, he only succeeds in tightening the other.\n\nThe garrote was widely employed in 17th- and 18th-century India as an assassination device, particularly by the Thuggee cult. Practitioners used a yellow silk or cloth scarf called a rumāl. The Indian version of the garrote frequently incorporates a knot at the center intended to aid in crushing the larynx while someone applies pressure to the victim's back, usually with a foot or knee.\n\nThe garrote () is known to have been used in the first century BC in Rome. It is referred to in accounts of the Second Catilinian Conspiracy, where conspirators including Publius Cornelius Lentulus Sura were strangled with a \"laqueus\" in the Tullianum, and the implement is shown in some early reliefs, e.g., \"Répertoire de Reliefs grecs et romains\", tome I, p. 341 (1919). It was also used in the Middle Ages in Spain and Portugal. It was employed during the \"conquista\" of the Americas, notably in the execution of the Inca emperor Atahualpa.\n\nIn the Ottoman Empire, execution by strangulation was reserved for very high officials and members of the ruling family. Unlike the Spanish version, a bowstring was used instead of a tightening collar.\n\nDuring the Peninsular War of 1808–1814, French forces regularly used the garrote to execute Spanish \"guerrilleros\", priests, and other opponents of Napoleonic rule. Around 1810 the earliest known metallic garrote appeared in Spain, and on 28 April 1828, the garrote was declared the sole method of executing civilians in that country. In May 1897, the last public garroting in Spain was performed in Barcelona. After that, all executions were performed inside prisons. \n\nThe last civilian executions in Spain, both by garroting, were those of Pilar Prades in May 1959 and José María Jarabo in July 1959. Recent legislation had caused many crimes (such as robbery-murder) to fall under the jurisdiction of military law; thus, prosecutors rarely requested civilian executions. Military executions were still performed in Spain until the 1970s. The garrotings of Heinz Chez (real name Georg Michael Welzel) and Salvador Puig Antich in March 1974, both convicted in the Francoist State of killing police officers, were the last state-sanctioned garrotings in Spain and in the world.\n\nWith the 1973 Penal Code, prosecutors once again started requesting execution in civilian cases. If the death penalty had not been abolished in 1978 after caudillo Francisco Franco's death, it is most likely that civilian executions would have resumed. The last man to be sentenced to death by garroting was José Luis Cerveto \"el asesino de Pedralbes\" in October 1977, for a double robbery–murder in May 1974. Cerveto requested execution, but his sentence was commuted. Another prisoner whose civilian death sentence was commuted was businessman Juan Ballot, for the contract killing of his wife in Navarre in November 1973.\n\nIn Spain, the death penalty was abolished after a new constitution was adopted in 1978. The writer Camilo José Cela obtained a garrote (which had probably been used for the execution of Puig Antich) from the \"Consejo General del Poder Judicial\" to display at his foundation. The device was kept in storage in Barcelona. It was displayed in the room that the Cela Foundation devoted to his novel \"La familia de Pascual Duarte\" until Puig Antich's family asked for its removal.\n\nIn 1990, Andorra became the last country to officially abolish the death penalty by garrotting, though this method had not been employed there since the late 12th century.\n"}
{"id": "4066085", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4066085", "title": "Grandmother cell", "text": "Grandmother cell\n\nThe grandmother cell is a hypothetical neuron that represents a complex but specific concept or object. It activates when a person \"sees, hears, or otherwise sensibly discriminates\" a specific entity, such as his or her grandmother. The term was in use at least as early as 1966 amongst staff and students in the Department of Experimental Psychology, University of Cambridge, England. A similar concept, that of the gnostic neuron, was proposed two years later by Jerzy Konorski.\n\nVisual neurons in the inferior temporal cortex of the monkey fire selectively to hands and faces. These cells are selective in that they do not fire for other visual objects important for monkeys such as fruit and genitalia. Research finds that some of these cells can be trained to show high specificity for arbitrary visual objects, and these would seem to fit the requirements of gnostic/grandmother cells. In addition, evidence exists for cells in the human hippocampus that have highly selective responses to gnostic categories including highly selective responses to individual human faces.\n\nHowever most of the reported face-selective cells are not grandmother/gnostic cells since they do not represent a specific percept, that is, they are not cells narrowly selective in their activations for one face and only one face irrespective of transformations of size, orientation, and color. Even the most selective face cells usually also discharge, if more weakly, to a variety of individual faces. Furthermore, face-selective cells often vary in their responsiveness to different aspects of faces. This suggests that cell responsiveness arises from the need of a monkey to differentiate among different individual faces rather than among other categories of stimuli such as bananas with their discrimination properties linked to the fact that different individual faces are much more similar to each other in their overall organization and fine detail than other kinds of stimuli. Moreover, it has been suggested that these cells might in fact be responding as specialized feature detector neurons that only function in the holistic context of a face construct.\n\nOne idea has been that such cells form ensembles for the coarse or distributed coding of faces rather than detectors for specific faces. Thus, a specific grandmother may be represented by a specialized ensemble of grandmother or near grandmother cells.\n\nIn 2005, a UCLA and Caltech study found evidence of different cells that fire in response to particular people, such as Bill Clinton or Jennifer Aniston. A neuron for Halle Berry, for example, might respond \"to the concept, the abstract entity, of Halle Berry\", and would fire not only for images of Halle Berry, but also to the actual name \"Halle Berry\". However, there is no suggestion in that study that only the cell being monitored responded to that concept, nor was it suggested that no other actress would cause that cell to respond (although several other presented images of actresses did not cause it to respond). The researchers believe that they have found evidence for sparseness, rather than for grandmother cells.\n\nFurther evidence for the theory that a small neural network provides facial recognition was found from analysis of cell recording studies of macaque monkeys. By formatting faces as points in a high-dimensional linear space, the scientists discovered that each face cell’s firing rate is proportional to the projection of an incoming face stimulus onto a single axis in this space, allowing a face cell ensemble of about 200 cells to encode the location of any face in the space.\n\nThe grandmother cell hypothesis, is an extreme version of the idea of sparseness, and is not without critics. The opposite of the grandmother cell theory is the distributed representation theory, that states that a specific stimulus is coded by its unique pattern of activity over a large group of neurons widely distributed in the brain.\n\nThe arguments against the sparseness include: \n\nWilliam James in 1890 proposed a related idea of a pontifical cell. The pontifical cell is defined as a putative, and implausible cell which had all our experiences. It is in this different from a concept specific cell in that it is the site of experience of sense data. James's 1890 pontifical cell was instead a cell \"to which the rest of the brain provided a representation\" of a grandmother. The experience of grandmother occurred in this cell.\n\n"}

John Rock was the first to extract an intact fertilized egg. In 1959, Min Chueh Chang at the Worcester Foundation, proved fertilisation in vitro was capable of proceeding to a birth of a live rabbit. Chang's discovery was seminal, as it clearly demonstrated that oocytes fertilised in vitro were capable of developing, if transferred into the uterus and thereby produce live young. \n\nThe first pregnancy achieved through \"in vitro\" human fertilisation of a human oocyte was reported in The Lancet from the Monash University team of Carl Wood, John Leeton and Alan Trounson in 1973, although it lasted only a few days and would today be called a biochemical pregnancy. Landrum Shettles attempted to perform an IVF in 1973, but his departmental chairman interdicted the procedure at the last moment. There was also an ectopic pregnancy reported by Patrick Steptoe and Robert Edwards in 1976. \n\nIn 1977, Steptoe and Edwards successfully carried out a pioneering conception which resulted in the birth of the world's first baby to be conceived by IVF, Louise Brown on 25 July 1978, in Oldham General Hospital, Greater Manchester, UK.\n\nIn October 1978, it was reported that Subash Mukhopadyay, a relatively unknown physician from Kolkata, India was performing experiments on his own with primitive instruments and a household refrigerator and this resulted in a test tube baby, later named as \"Durga\" (alias Kanupriya Agarwal) who was born on 3 October 1978. However, state authorities prevented him from presenting his work at scientific conferences and, in the absence of scientific evidence, his work is not recognised by the international scientific community. These days, however, Mukhopadhyay's contribution is acknowledged in works dealing with the subject.\n\nSteptoe and Edwards were responsible for the world’s first confirmed boy conceived by IVF, Alastair MacDonald born on 14 January 1979 in Glasgow. A team led by Ian Johnston and Alex Lopata were responsible for Australia's first baby conceived by IVF, Candice Reed, born on 23 June 1980 in Melbourne. It was the subsequent use of stimulated cycles with clomiphene citrate and the use of human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) to control and time oocyte maturation, thus controlling the time of collection, that converted IVF from a research tool to a clinical treatment.\n\nThis was followed by a total of 14 pregnancies resulting in nine births in 1981 with the Monash University team. Howard W. Jones and Georgeanna Seegar Jones at the Eastern Virginia Medical School in Norfolk, Virginia, further improved stimulated cycles by incorporating the use of a follicle-stimulating hormone (uHMG). This then became known as controlled ovarian hyperstimulation (COH). Another step forward was the use of gonadotrophin-releasing hormone agonists (GnRHA), thus decreasing the need for monitoring by preventing premature ovulation, and more recently gonadotrophin-releasing hormone antagonists (GnRH Ant), which have a similar function. The additional use of the oral contraceptive pill has allowed the scheduling of IVF cycles, which has made the treatment far more convenient for both staff and patients.\n\nThe ability to freeze and subsequently thaw and transfer embryos has significantly improved the feasibility of IVF use. The other very significant milestone in IVF was the development of the intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) of single sperms by Gianpiero D. Palermo et al.in Brussels (UZ Brussel), 1992. This has enabled men with minimal sperm production to achieve pregnancies. ICSI is sometimes used in conjunction with sperm recovery, using a testicular fine needle or open testicular biopsy. Using this method, some men with Klinefelter's syndrome, and so would be otherwise infertile, have occasionally been able to achieve pregnancy. Thus, IVF has become the final solution for most fertility problems, moving from tubal disease to male factor, idiopathic subfertility, endometriosis, advanced maternal age, and anovulation not responding to ovulation induction.\n\nRobert Edwards was awarded the 2010 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine \"for the development of \"in vitro\" fertilization\". Steptoe and Jean Purdy were not eligible for consideration as the Nobel Prize is not awarded posthumously. Carl Wood was dubbed \"the father of IVF (\"in vitro\" fertilisation)\" for having pioneered the use of frozen embryos.\n\nIn the US, ART cycles started in 2006 resulted in 41,343 births (54,656 infants), which is slightly more than 1% of total US births. In 2012 it was estimated that five million children had been born worldwide using IVF and other assisted reproduction techniques.\n"}
{"id": "5566534", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5566534", "title": "Johnny Bright incident", "text": "Johnny Bright incident\n\nThe Johnny Bright incident was a violent on-field assault against African-American player Johnny Bright by a white opposing player during an American college football game held on October 20, 1951 in Stillwater, Oklahoma. The game was significant in itself as it marked the first time that an African-American athlete with a national profile and of critical importance to the success of his team, the Drake Bulldogs, had played against Oklahoma A&M College (now Oklahoma State University) at Oklahoma A&M's Lewis Field. Bright's injury also highlighted the racial tensions of the times and assumed notoriety when it was captured in what was later to become both a widely disseminated and eventually Pulitzer Prize-winning photo sequence.\n\nJohnny Bright's participation as a halfback/quarterback in the collegiate football game between the Drake Bulldogs and Oklahoma A&M Aggies on October 20, 1951 at Lewis Field was controversial even before it began. Bright had been the first African American football player to play at Lewis Field two years prior (without incident). In 1951, Bright was a pre-season Heisman Trophy candidate and led the nation in total offense. Bright had never played for a losing team in his college career. Coming into the contest, Drake carried a five-game winning streak, owing much to Bright's rushing and passing abilities.\n\nIt was an open secret that Oklahoma A&M players were targeting Bright. Both Oklahoma A&M's student newspaper, \"The Daily O'Collegian\", and the local newspaper, \"The News Press\", reported that Bright was a marked man, and several A&M students were openly claiming that Bright \"would not be around at the end of the game.\" Although Oklahoma A&M had integrated in 1949, the Jim Crow spirit was still very much alive on campus.\n\nDuring the first seven minutes of the game, Bright was knocked unconscious three times by blows from Oklahoma A&M defensive tackle Wilbanks Smith. While Smith's final elbow blow broke Bright's jaw, he was still able to complete a 61-yard touchdown pass to Drake halfback Jim Pilkington a few plays later. Soon afterward, the injury forced him to leave the game. Bright finished the game with less than 100 yards, the first time in his three-year collegiate career. Oklahoma A&M eventually won 27–14.\n\nBob Spiegel, a reporter with the \"Des Moines Register\", interviewed several spectators after the game, eventually publishing a report on the incident in the October 30, 1951 issue of the newspaper. According to Spiegel's report, several of the Oklahoma A&M students he interviewed overheard an Oklahoma A&M coach repeatedly say \"Get that nigger\" whenever the A&M practice squad ran Drake plays against the Oklahoma A&M starting defense prior to the October 20 game. Spiegel also recounted the experiences of a businessman and his wife, who were seated behind a group of Oklahoma A&M practice squad players. At the beginning of the game, one of the players turned around said, \"We're gonna get that nigger.\" After the first blow to Bright was delivered by Smith, the same player again turned around and told the businessman, \"See that knot on my jaw? That same guy [Smith] gave me that the very same way in practice.\"\n\nA six photograph sequence of the incident captured by \"Des Moines Register\" cameramen John Robinson and Don Ultang clearly showed Smith's jaw-breaking blow was thrown well after Bright had handed the ball off to Drake fullback Gene Macomber, and was well behind the play. Robinson and Ultang had actually set up a camera focusing on Bright before the game after the rumors of him being targeted became too loud to ignore. They rushed the film to Des Moines as soon as Bright was knocked out of the game. Ultang said years later that they were very lucky that the incident took place when it did; they'd only planned to stay through the first quarter so they could have enough time to develop the pictures before the deadline. The sequence won Robinson and Ultang the 1952 Pulitzer Prize for Photography, and eventually made the cover of \"Life Magazine\".\n\nOklahoma A&M's president, Oliver Willham, denied anything happened even after evidence of the incident was published nationwide. This began a cover-up that would last over half a century; during that time, whenever the story was discussed, the standard response from A&M/OSU was \"no comment.\" The determination to gloss over the affair was so strong that when Robert B. Kamm succeeded Willham in 1966, he knew that he could not even discuss the matter even though he had been Drake's dean of men at the time of the incident.\n\nWhen it became apparent that neither Oklahoma A&M nor the Missouri Valley Conference, to which both Drake and Oklahoma A&M belonged, would take any disciplinary action against Smith, Drake withdrew from the MVC in protest. The Bulldogs would not return to the MVC until 1956 for non-football sports, and would not return for football until 1971. Fellow member Bradley University pulled out of the league in solidarity with Drake and did not return for non-football sports until 1955; its football team never played another down in the MVC (Bradley dropped football in 1970). The incident eventually provoked changes in NCAA football rules regarding illegal blocking, and mandated the use of more protective helmets with face guards.\n\nBright's broken jaw limited his effectiveness for the remainder of his senior season at Drake, but he earned 70 percent of the yards Drake gained and scored 70 percent of the Bulldogs' points, despite missing the better part of the final three games of the season. Bright finished fifth in the balloting for the 1951 Heisman Trophy, and played in the post-season East–West Shrine Game and the Hula Bowl.\n\nFollowing his 1952 graduation from Drake, Bright went on to enjoy a 12-year professional football career in the Canadian Football League, retiring in 1964 as the CFL's all-time leading rusher, and was inducted into the Canadian Football Hall of Fame in 1970.\n\nRecalling the incident without apparent bitterness in a 1980 \"Des Moines Register\" interview three years before his death, Bright commented: \"There's no way it couldn't have been racially motivated.\" Bright went on to add: \"What I like about the whole deal now, and what I'm smug enough to say, is that getting a broken jaw has somehow made college athletics better. It made the NCAA take a hard look and clean up some things that were bad.\"\n\nWhen asked about Smith, whom he had not seen since the incident, Bright said he felt \"null and void\" about Smith, but added: \"The thing has been a great influence on my life. My total philosophy of life now is that, whatever a person's bias and limitation, they deserve respect. Everyone's entitled to their own beliefs.\"\n\nWilbanks Smith received over 1000 letters regarding the incident. Most of the mail was hate mail or death threats, but some was congratulatory and thankful. Smith maintained that he was not racist, the hit was \"not a racial incident,\" and that he had landed \"the same hit\" on a white player earlier in the game. He never apologized for the incident, but said in 2012 that he was glad the incident had helped to integrate college football, saying \"It took me a long time before I could smile about it. But now I can. I think it was a tool [Civil Rights'] organizations used, and it was very effective.\"\n\nOn September 28, 2005, Oklahoma State University President David J. Schmidly wrote a letter to Drake President David Maxwell formally apologizing for the incident. The apology came 22 years after Bright's death. Schmidly, reiterating a conversation earlier in the month over the phone, called the team's behavior that day \"an ugly mark on Oklahoma State University and college football.\"\n\n\n"}

It includes a transverse cut 1-2 centimetres above the attachment of the urinary bladder to the uterus, called the Pfannenstiel incision in the lower segment. This type of incision results in less blood loss and is easier to repair than other types of Caesarean sections.\n\nIt may be transverse (the usual) or vertical in the following conditions:\nThe location of an LSCS is beneficial for the following reasons:\nMost bleeding takes place from the angles of the incision, and forceps can be applied to control it. \"Green Armytage forceps\" are specifically designed for this purpose.\n\nAlthough the incision is made using a sharp scalpel, care must be taken not to injure the foetus, especially if the membranes are ruptured, or in emergencies like abruption. The incision can be extended to either sides using a scissor or by blunt dissection using hands. While using the scissors, the surgeon should ensure that a finger is placed underneath the uterus so that the foetus in protected from unintentional injury. If blunt dissection is done, intraoperative blood loss can be minimized. In cases where Pfannenstiel incision cannot be done (such as large baby), Kronig incision (low vertical incision), classical (midline), J or T shaped incisions may be used to incise the uterus.\n\nThe German gynecologist, Hermann Johannes Pfannenstiel (1862–1909), invented the technique. In the United Kingdom, the surgery was first popularised by Dr. Monroe Kerr, who first used it in 1911, so in English speaking countries it is sometimes called the Kerr incision or the Pfannenstiel-Kerr incision. Kerr published the results in 1920, proposing that this method would cause less damage to the vascularized areas of uterus than the classical operation. He claimed that it was better than the longitudinal uterine incision in terms of chances for scar rupture and injury to vessels.\n\n"}
{"id": "13121523", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13121523", "title": "Mate desertion", "text": "Mate desertion\n\nMate desertion occurs when one or both parents abandon their current offspring, and thereby reduce or stop providing parental care. Often, by deserting, a parent attempts to increase breeding opportunities by seeking out another mate. This form of mating strategy behavior is exhibited in insects, birds and mammals. Typically, males are more likely to desert, but both males and females have been observed to practice mate desertion.\n\nMate desertion involves the decision by an already-mated individual to either continue providing parental care or to desert. In making this decision, a parent must balance investment in terms of current and future reproductive success, choosing the optimal strategy, or one that provides the greatest net benefit towards lifetime reproductive success. Current success is measured by the number of surviving offspring, whereas future success is measured by the potential to successfully produce offspring in future seasons. These trade-offs between costs and benefits are further reflected in the two major conflicts driving mate desertion: 1) parent-offspring conflict over the level of parental investment that a parent should provide and 2) sexual conflict between mates over who should provide care and how much care should be provided.\n\nAccording to evolutionary biologist Robert Trivers, parental investment is defined as “any investment by the parent in an individual offspring that increases the offspring's chance of surviving (and hence reproductive success) at the cost of the parent's ability to invest in other offspring.” This investment includes investing in gametes and feeding and protecting young, which is also known as brooding. Often, the amount of parental investment necessary to maximize fitness differs between parent and offspring, thereby creating parent-offspring conflict. While increasing parental investment increases the current offspring's likelihood to survive and reproduce, this investment comes at the expense of the parent's ability to invest in future offspring. Therefore, when uniparental care is equally effective as biparental care, natural selection will favor mate desertion, allowing the deserter to either remate or conserve resources for future reproduction.\n\nHowever, the decision of which mate deserts first and when creates varying reproductive outcomes for both males and females, leading to sexual conflict over parental investment. This occurs because the deserted organism pays all costs of parental care while the deserter not only shares the benefits of the reproductive success of the current offspring, but also gains benefits from additional mating opportunities. Theoretically, both males and females would be expected to evolve adaptations in response to this sexual conflict, which would ultimately lead to sexually antagonistic coevolution between male and female traits.\nIn penduline tits (\"Remiz pendulinus\"), uniparental care is dominant, and either sex is capable of desertion during the egg laying period. Typically, females care 50-70% of the time, males care 5-20% of the time, and both parents desert 30-40% of the time, condemning the offspring to death. In this system, males build elaborate nests and usually desert once these nests have been filled with the females' eggs. \n\nAs a result, in response, females have adopted two counter-adaptive behaviors that function to deceive the male regarding the clutch's progress. Females conceal their eggs by burying them and aggressively attack males who approach the nest during the egg laying period. Studies have shown a high correlation between length of time a male stays before deserting and number of days a female keeps her eggs buried. This relationship suggests that egg burial has evolved as an adaptive female behavior that attempts to control information males use to decide whether or not they should desert.\n\nAfter one partner deserts, the remaining partner has three options. First, it may attempt to raise the young on its own. This usually occurs when the investment required by one parent to successfully raise the current offspring to maturity is less than that needed to produce new offspring. As a result, the remaining partner is forced into a situation Trivers' coined as “cruel bind.” Here, the deserter effectively forces its partner to stay, gaining the benefit of the deserted parent's continued investment at the cost of additional mating opportunities for the deserted parent.\n\nSecond, if the cost of raising offspring alone is high and the cost of remating is low, the deserted individual may choose to desert the offspring as well and attempt to breed again. In some cases, the second deserter may even take part in filial cannibalism, reaping its lost investment by eating its own offspring as nourishment. For example, in scissortail sergeant fish (\"Abudefduf sexfasciatus\"), male parental care is dominant, and males undergo brood cycling in which they alternate between mating and parental phases. When broods are artificially reduced early in the breeding phase, male scissor-tail sergeants are more likely to cannibalise eggs and return to the mating phase, primarily because reduced broods indicate decreased current reproductive success.\n\nLastly, a deserted individual may also attempt to trick another mate into helping provide care for its young, circumventing its cruel bind. For instance, a female who cuckolds a male, deceiving him into raising another male's offspring, benefits by reducing the amount of care she must provide and by conserving resources for future reproduction. In response, the evolution of counter-adaptations that allow males to guard against female deception would be expected, as it is evolutionarily maladaptive for an organism to invest in unrelated offspring.\n\nTwo explanations have been proposed as evidence for why mate desertion by males is more commonly observed in nature. First, costs in lost mating opportunities are higher in males than in females. Because males have greater variance in reproductive success, their lifetime reproductive success depends more on number of mating opportunities, and thus they often benefit more from desertion. Second, mode of fertilization often influences degree of parental care, which in turn influences which sex will desert. Generally speaking, male parental care is predicted by external fertilization, and female parental care is predicted by internal fertilization. This pattern of parental care is best explained by the “Association Hypothesis,\" which argues that association with embryos predisposes a sex for parental care. \n\nFor example, in species where mate desertion by males is prominent, females reproduce through internal fertilization and are thus responsible for carrying the eggs. While this intimate connection allows the female to offer better care for her offspring, the male's comparative separation makes him much less likely to be able to adequately care for his young. Furthermore, inherent to internal fertilization is the fact that it is impossible for females to desert because they are the sex bearing offspring. Under this theory, females are often not in a position to leave their young, while males can leave and have much less to offer by sticking around. Conversely, in organisms that practice external fertilization—including certain species of fish—males are often the primary caretakers for young.\n\nNatural selection tends to favor desertion when costs are low and benefits are high. Benefits include increased mating opportunities in the same breeding season and reduced energetic costs associated with parental care, whereas costs include decreased mating opportunities and reduced future reproductive success. Both the timing and probability of mate desertion have been shown to be influenced by a variety of factors. For instance, desertion by either sex is favored when remating opportunities are high, food for young is abundant, predation is low, current offspring are older, require little parental investment and are smaller than average size, and the deserter's contribution to parental care is low.\n\nAnother factor that has been shown to influence probability of mate desertion is a biased operational sex ratio, which is defined as the ratio of sexually active males to sexually active females. In convict cichlid fish, males are more likely to desert when there is a female-biased sex ratio, as males have a higher chance of remating and increasing reproductive success. Furthermore, probability of male desertion in this particular species is also increased where there is low predation (high predation leads to biparental care for offspring survival), mature offspring, and smaller than average offspring size. In another population of cichlids (\"Aequidens coeruleopunctatus\"), brood reduction leading to earlier male mate desertion has also been observed, and here, by deserting, not only does the male save energy, but he also increases his chance of breeding and thus his reproductive success as well.\nSimilarly, in Cooper's hawks, female desertion of offspring has been found to be closely related to both the likelihood of offspring survival and future reproductive success. Females in weak physical condition are more likely to abandon offspring to complete migration, increasing breeding chances and opportunities for the following year. In Whiskered terns, the majority of deserters are female and is related to provisioning rate: females providing more food were less likely to desert. \n\nIn mammals, aardwolves have been shown to practice male mate desertion in response to female promiscuity. Lastly, ambisexual mate desertion, in which both sexes desert at nearly equal frequencies, has been observed in snail kites. Mate desertion by either sex depends on food supply, in that snail kites are more likely to desert when snails are abundant and rate of nesting success is high. Thus, mating strategies exhibited by snail kites are somewhat plastic, depending on varying environmental conditions.\n\nGame theory helps explain when parents are more or less likely to desert their offspring by taking into account the costs and benefits associated with these decisions. John Lazarus developed a well-known game theory model for mate desertion, in which different outcomes are predicted using a payoff matrix. In this particular model, the benefits of desertion depend both on the ability of the deserter to gain additional mating opportunities and on the deserted partner's strategy.\n\nLazarus's model of mate desertion defines conditions that lead to three possible cases: 1) both parents stay, 2) both parents desert, or 3) one parent stays and one parent deserts. If both parents stay with the offspring, then neither gains the benefits from deserting their mate. If both parents desert, each individual will do so at a time offering them maximal benefit based on when the other parent leaves. If only one parent deserts, then the deserter will leave at a time when benefits are high and costs are low. Variables are used to describe the different fitness levels achieved by each parent.\n\nIn case one, both parents choose to stay. For either the male or the female, the total payoff for the deserter (V+M or V+F) is less than the reproductive success obtained when both parents provide care (V). Therefore, neither benefits from deserting.\n\nCase two arises when both parents desert. Normally, the payoff for desertion is higher for one sex than the other. This model assumes that males benefit more from desertion than do females (M>F), though this is not the case for all species. When the payoff a male receives by deserting (V+M) exceeds the reproductive success of providing care (V) for the young, he should desert. At this point, the male's reproductive success is V+M, and the female's reproductive success is V. Eventually the payoff for a female deserting (V+F) will exceed the benefits of caring alone (V). At this point, she is also expected to desert, leaving the brood with no parental care. \nLastly, case three occurs when one parent deserts, and the other stays. In this model, because of the assumption that M>F, the male will desert first when the payoff of deserting (V+M) is greater than the benefits of investing in offspring (V). At this point, the male's reproductive success is V + M, and the female's reproductive success is V. However, in contrast to case two, the female will never benefit by deserting because the payoff (V+F) never exceeds the benefits obtained by caring alone (V). Consequently, in situations where the female's benefits of deserting are low, she will remain to raise her brood, maximizing her reproductive success.\n"}
{"id": "642328", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=642328", "title": "McKinsey &amp; Company", "text": "McKinsey &amp; Company\n\nMcKinsey & Company is an American worldwide management consulting firm. It conducts qualitative and quantitative analysis to evaluate management decisions across public and private sectors. McKinsey publishes the \"McKinsey Quarterly\" since 1964, funds the McKinsey Global Institute research organization, publishes reports on management topics, and has authored many influential books on management. Its practices of confidentiality, influence on business practices, and corporate culture have experienced a polarizing reception.\n\nMcKinsey was founded in 1926 by James O. McKinsey in order to apply accounting principles to management. McKinsey died in 1937, and the firm was restructured several times, with the modern-day McKinsey & Company emerging in 1939. Marvin Bower is credited with establishing McKinsey's culture and practices in the 1930s based on the principles he experienced as a lawyer. The firm developed an \"up or out\" policy, where consultants who are not promoted are asked to leave. McKinsey was the first management consultancy to hire recent college graduates, rather than experienced managers.\n\nIn the 1980s and 1990s, the firm expanded internationally and established new practice areas. It had 88 staff in 1951, 7,700 by the early 2000s and 27,000+ by 2018. McKinsey's consulting has helped to establish many of the norms in business and contributed to many of the major successes and failures in business in the modern era.\n\nMcKinsey & Company was founded in Chicago under the name James O. McKinsey & Company in 1926 by James McKinsey, a professor of accounting at the University of Chicago. He conceived the idea after witnessing inefficiencies in military suppliers while working for the U.S. Army Ordnance Department. The firm called itself an \"accounting and management firm\" and started out giving consulting on using accounting principles as a management tool. McKinsey's first partners were Tom Kearney, hired in 1929, and Marvin Bower, hired in 1933. In its first few years, the firm grew quickly and began developing rapport among corporations; its second office was opened in New York City in 1932. In 1935, McKinsey left the firm temporarily to serve as the Chairman and CEO of client Marshall Field's as it implemented the restructuring plan created by his firm.\n\nMcKinsey was merged with accounting firm Scovell, Wellington & Company that same year, creating the New York-based McKinsey, Wellington & Co. and splitting off the accounting practice into Chicago-based Wellington & Company. A Wellington project that accounted for 55 percent of McKinsey, Wellington & Company's billings was about to expire and Kearney and Bower had disagreements about how to run the firm. Bower wanted to expand nationally and hire young business school graduates, whereas Kearney wanted to stay in Chicago and hire experienced accountants. Additionally, in 1937 James O. McKinsey died after catching pneumonia.\n\nThis led to the division of McKinsey, Wellington & Company in 1939. The accounting practice returned to Scovell, Wellington & Company, while the management engineering practice was split into McKinsey & Company and McKinsey, Kearney & Company. Bower had partnered with Guy Crockett from Scovell Wellington, who invested in the new McKinsey & Company and became managing partner, while Marvin Bower is credited with founding the firm's principles and strategy as his deputy. The New York office purchased exclusive rights to the McKinsey name in 1946.\n\nMcKinsey & Company grew quickly in the 1940s and 50s, especially in Europe. It had 88 staff in 1951 and more than 200 by the 1960s, including 37 in London by 1966. In the same year, McKinsey had six offices in major US cities like San Francisco, Cleveland, Los Angeles and Washington D.C., as well as six abroad. These foreign offices were primarily in Europe, such as in London, Paris, Amsterdam, as well as in Melbourne. By this time, one third of the company's revenues originated from its European offices. Guy Crockett stepped down as managing director in 1950, and Marvin Bower was elected in his place. McKinsey's profit-sharing, executive and planning committees were formed in 1951. The organization's client base expanded especially among governments, defense contractors, bluechip companies and military organizations in the post-World War II era. After seven years of consideration, McKinsey became a private corporation with shares owned exclusively by McKinsey employees in 1956.\n\nAfter Bower stepped down in 1967, the firm's revenues declined. New competitors like the Boston Consulting Group and Bain & Company created increased competition for McKinsey by marketing specific branded products, such as the Growth-Share Matrix, and by selling their industry expertise. In 1971, McKinsey created the Commission on Firm Aims and Goals, which found that McKinsey had become too focused on geographic expansion and lacked adequate industry knowledge. The commission advised that McKinsey slow its growth and develop industry specialties. In 1976, Ron Daniel was elected managing director, serving until 1988. Daniel and Fred Gluck helped shift the firm away from its generalist approach by developing 15 specialized working groups within McKinsey called Centers of Competence and by developing practice areas called Strategy, Operations and Organization. Daniel also began McKinsey's knowledge management efforts in 1987. This led to the creation of an IT system that tracked McKinsey engagements, a process to centralize knowledge from each practice area and a resource directory of internal experts.\" By the end of his tenure in 1988 the firm was growing again and had opened new offices in Rome, Helsinki, São Paulo and Minneapolis.\n\nFred Gluck served as McKinsey’s managing director from 1988 to 1994. The firm's revenues doubled during his tenure. He organized McKinsey into 72 \"islands of activity\" that were organized under seven sectors and seven functional areas. By 1997, McKinsey had grown eightfold over its size in 1977. In 1989 the firm tried to acquire talent in IT services through a $10 million purchase of the Information Consulting Group (ICG), but a culture clash caused 151 out of the 254 ICG staff members to leave by 1993.\n\nIn 1994, Rajat Gupta became the first non-American-born partner to be elected as the firm’s managing director. By the end of his tenure, McKinsey had grown from 2,900 to 7,700 staff and 58 to 84 locations. He opened new international offices in cities such as Moscow, Beijing and Bangkok. Continuing the structure developed by prior directors, Gupta also created 16 industry groups charged with understanding specific markets and instituted a three-term limit for the managing director. McKinsey created practice areas for manufacturing and business technology in the late 1990s.\n\nMcKinsey set up \"accelerators\" in the 1990s, where the firm accepted stock-based reimbursement to help internet startups; the company performed more than 1,000 e-commerce projects from 1998-2000 alone. The burst of the dot-com bubble led to a reduction in utilization rates of McKinsey's consultants from 64 to 52 percent. Though McKinsey avoided dismissing any personnel following the decline, the decline in revenues and losses from equity-based payments as stock lost value, together with a recession in 2001, meant the company had to reduce its prices, cut expenses and reduce hiring.\n\nIn 2001, McKinsey launched several practices that focused on the public and social sector. It took on many public sector or non profit clients on a pro bono basis. By 2002 McKinsey had invested a $35.8 million budget on knowledge management, up from $8.3 million in 1999. Its revenues were 50, 20, and 30 percent from strategy, operations, and technology consulting, respectively.\n\nIn 2003 Ian Davis, the head of the London, UK office, was elected to the position of managing director. Davis promised a return to the company’s core values, after a period in which the firm had expanded rapidly, which some McKinsey consultants felt was a departure from the company's heritage. Also in 2003, the firm established a headquarters for the Asia-Pacific region in Shanghai, China. By 2004, more than 60 percent of McKinsey's revenues were generated outside the U.S. The company started a Social Sector Office (SSO) in 2008, which is divided into three practices: Global Public Health, Economic Development and Opportunity Creation (EDHOC) and Philanthropy. McKinsey does much of its pro-bono work through the SSO, whereas a Business Technology Office (BTO), founded in 1997, provides consulting on technology strategy.\n\nBy 2009, the firm consisted of 400 directors (senior partners), up from 151 in 1993. Dominic Barton was elected as Managing Director, a role he was re-elected for in 2012 and 2015.\n\nIn February 2018, Kevin Sneader was elected as Managing Director. He will serve a three-year term beginning on July 1 2018.\n\nFormer McKinsey senior executives, Rajat Gupta and Anil Kumar, were among those convicted in a government investigation into insider trading for sharing inside information with Galleon Group hedge fund owner Raj Rajaratnam. Though McKinsey was not accused of any wrongdoing, the convictions were embarrassing for the firm, since it prides itself for integrity and client confidentiality. Following the initial allegations McKinsey no longer maintains a relationship with either senior partner, though the manner in which it severed ties attracted controversy.\n\nSenior partner Anil Kumar, described as Gupta's protégé, left the firm after the allegations in 2009 and pleaded guilty in January 2010. While he and other partners had been pitching McKinsey's consulting services to the Galleon Group, Kumar and Rajaratnam reached a private consulting agreement, violating McKinsey's policies on confidentiality. Gupta was convicted in June 2012 of four counts of conspiracy and securities fraud, and acquitted on two counts. In October 2011, he was arrested by the FBI on criminal charges of sharing insider information from these confidential board meetings with Rajaratnam. At least twice, Gupta used a McKinsey phone to call Rajaratnam and retained other perks — an office, assistant, and $6 million retirement salary that year — as a senior partner emeritus.\n\nAfter the scandal McKinsey instituted new policies and procedures to discourage future indiscretions from consultants, including investigating other partners' ties to Gupta.\n\nThe Gupta family (no relation to Rajat Gupta) had strategically placed corrupted individuals in various South African government, utilities and infrastructure sectors. It is alleged that McKinsey was complicit in this corruption by using the Guptas to obtain consulting contracts from certain state-owned enterprises, including Eskom and Transnet. Working with Trillian Capital Partners (a consultancy which was owned by a Gupta associate), they provided services to the value of R1 billion ($75 million) annually. Trillian was paid a commission for facilitating the business for McKinsey. McKinsey hired law firm Norton Rose Fulbright to carry out an internal investigation over the allegations.\n\nMcKinsey's then Managing Partner, Dominic Barton issued a statement, following an internal investigation, in which the firm \"admitted that it found violations of its professional standards but denied any acts of bribery, corruption, and payments to Trillian.\" \n\nIn September 2017, the Democratic Alliance, South Africa's main opposition political party, laid charges (Case Number: CAS 1156/9/2017) of fraud, racketeering and collusion against McKinsey in terms of Section 21 of the Prevention and Combatting of Corrupt Activities Act (Act 12 of 2004). The party alleged that McKinsey ignored red flags from senior South African staff members that deals between Trillian, Eskom and other Gupta-linked companies were not above board. The party said that McKinsey seems to have ignored these warnings as the profits were far too lucrative for McKinsey to pass up. Corruption Watch, a South African non-governmental organisation, also filed a complaint about the controversial contract to the US Department of Justice, alleging that there was a criminal conspiracy between McKinsey, Trillian and Eskom in contravention of US and South African law. It was revealed in January 2018 that criminal complaints were filed against McKinsey & Company by the South African Companies and Intellectual Property Commission. South African prosecutors confirmed that they would enforce the seizing of assets from McKinsey.\n\nSouth Africa's National Prosecuting Authority concluded in early 2018 that the payments to McKinsey and its local business partner, Trillian, were illegal, involving crimes such as fraud, theft, corruption and money laundering. McKinsey had subsequently been in discussion with Eskom and the National Prosecuting Authority’s Asset Forfeiture Unit to agree on a transparent, legally appropriate process for returning the R1-billion (US$74m) it had been paid - it was confirmed on 6 July 2018 that this had been concluded. Eskom confirmed it received R99.5 million in interest from McKinsey on July 23, 2018. The interest payment covers the two years since McKinsey was paid almost R1-billion in 2016.\n\nThe repayment of the near R1-billion illegal fee was not universally well received by South Africans. McKinsey continued to receive negative coverage in South Africa's business press with Sikonathi Mantshantsha, deputy editor of South Africa's Financial Mail magazine writing in an open letter to Mckinsey that \"...I find it rich — too rich, in fact — for McKinsey to lecture anyone about the truth, principles and fairness. Let me tell you that the highest standards of ethics, truth and fairness begin with never taking that which does not belong to you in the first place. The second is to not pretend you are helping a client when you clearly are not. The third point is to acknowledge, however hard that may be, when you have done all and any of the above.\" This was in response to an unpublished email from Mckinsey which Mantshantsha described as making the \"baseless and arrogant claim about there being no evidence presented to support the accusations of unethical conduct — possibly also thieving and corruption — that has financially crippled not only SA's electricity provider Eskom, but also the rail and pipeline firm Transnet. And possibly others.\" Mantshantsha went on to say \"as is now common cause, McKinsey has readily admitted that there is no legal basis on which to hold on to the funds.\"\n\nInformation relating to allegedly corrupt practices by McKinsey at Transnet in 2011 and 2012 came to light in late July 2018. The weekly Mail & Guardian newspaper reported that a \"...new forensic treasury report shows how controversial former Transnet and Eskom chief financial officer Anoj Singh enjoyed overseas trips at the expense of international consulting firm McKinsey, which scored multi-billion rand contracts at the state owned entities.\" The \"...report reiterates treasury’s recommendations that Singh’s conduct with regards to McKinsey should be referred to the elite crime-fighting unit, the Hawks, for investigations under the Prevention and Combating of Corrupt Activities Act (Precca). Under Precca, Singh would be investigated for allegations of corruption as the overseas trips alone constitute a form of gratification, which is illegal.\" The Sunday City Press reported that the forensic report in turn reported that \"multinational advisory firm McKinsey paid for Singh to go on lavish international trips to Dubai, Russia, Germany and the UK, after which their contract with Transnet was massively extended.\". Mckinsey issued a statement that the allegations were incorrect. Mckinsey stated that \"based on an extensive review encompassing interviews, email records and expense documents, our understanding is that McKinsey did not pay for Mr. Singh’s airfare and hotel lodgings in connection with the CFO Forum and the meetings that took place around the CFO Forum in London and elsewhere in 2012 and 2013.\"\n\nIn early August 2018 McKinsey admitted to helping Transnet Group Chief Executive Siyabonga Gama prepare a part of his thesis to obtain an MBA degree from TRIUM, a collaborative MBA programme jointly run by the NYU Stern School of Business, the London School of Economics and Political Science and HEC School of Management. Several researchers at McKinsey’s Johannesburg office were assigned to help outline and prepare Gama’s submission to a joint thesis to which he had to contribute at least two chapters. Despite multiple earlier denials that any corrupt activities had been discovered, a McKinsey’s spokesperson said \"... we believe this matter passed the threshold of reasonable suspicion that an offence may have occurred under South African law. As such, we reported it last year to relevant authorities under Section 34(1) of Precca.\". The TRIUM Global EMBA official twitter account was reported to have tweeted that \"We have been made aware of recent allegations about academic integrity involving a TRIUM alumnus. TRIUM and its three Alliance Schools...take academic integrity issues very seriously.\"\n\nAs of May 2018, the restructuring practice of the company is being sued by a competitor claiming knowingly misleading courts in order to land clients. The company indeed disclose an average of only five potential conflicts per case, whereas other professional-services firms divulged, on average, 171 connections. In most cases it disclosed no conflicts at all.\n\nIn October 2018, in the wake of the Saudi dissident and journalist assassination of Jamal Khashoggi, \"The New York Times\" reported that McKinsey had identified the most prominent Saudi dissidents on Twitter and that the Saudi government subsequently repressed the dissidents and their families. One of the dissidents was arrested. Another dissident's family members were arrested, and the cell phone of the dissident was hacked. McKinsey issued a statement, saying \"We are horrified by the possibility, however remote, that [the report] could have been misused. We have seen no evidence to suggest that it was misused, but we are urgently investigating how and with whom the document was shared.\"\n\nRole in Trinidad and Tobago-Petrotrin \nReports presented in the Trinidad and Tobago Parliament indicated McKinsey provided consulting recommendations to the amount of $66. Million dollars in total. The Petrotrin Refinery is set to close on November 30th 2018. (Reference TT Parliament Hansard).\n\nMcKinsey & Company was originally organized as a partnership before being legally restructured as a private corporation with shares owned by its partners in 1956. It mimics the structure of a partnership and employees are called \"partners\". The company has a flat hierarchy and each member is assigned a mentor. Since the 1960s, McKinsey's Managing Director has been elected by a vote of senior directors to serve up to three, three-year terms or until reaching the mandatory retirement age of 60. The firm is also managed by a series of committees that each has its own area of responsibility.\n\nMcKinsey has a de-centralized structure, whereby different offices operate similarly, but independently. Each office is expected to put the overall organization's best interest before the office's, which McKinsey refers to as the \"one firm\" principle. Consultants and engagements are often shared across offices. Revenues from all offices are pooled and an individual office's revenue does not directly affect it financially. The company's budgeting is centralized, but individual consultants are given a large degree of autonomy.\n\nMcKinsey consultants are either industry experts, functional experts, or generalists that cover specific geographic regions. The firm has 23 industry practices focused on individual industries, nine functional practices that work in areas like finance, marketing or risk, and five Capabilities and Solutions areas related to technology consulting.\n\nMarvin Bower is credited with creating McKinsey's values and principles in 1937. He established a set of rules: that consultants should put the interests of clients before McKinsey's revenues, not discuss client affairs, tell the truth even if it means challenging the client's opinion, and only perform work that is both necessary and that McKinsey can do well. Bower created the firm's principle of only working with CEOs, which was later expanded to CEOs of subsidiaries and divisions. He also created McKinsey's principle of only working with clients the firm felt would follow its advice.\n\nBower also established the firm's language. McKinsey calls itself \"The Firm\" and its employees \"members\". McKinsey says its consultants are not motivated by money. McKinsey & Company tries to keep a \"very low profile public image\". The firm has a policy against discussing specific client situations. The firm says it does not advertise, though it did advertise allegedly for recruitment purposes in \"TIME Magazine\" in 1966. Members are not supposed to \"sell\" their services. McKinsey's consultants are expected to become a part of the community and recruit clients from church, charitable foundations, board positions and other community involvements.\n\nA 1993 profile story in \"Fortune Magazine\" said McKinsey & Company was \"the most well-known, most secretive, most high-priced, most prestigious, most consistently successful, most envied, most trusted, most disliked management consulting firm on earth\". According to \"BusinessWeek\" the firm is \"ridiculed, reviled, or revered depending on one's perspective\".\n\nMcKinsey's culture has often been compared to religion, because of the influence, loyalty and zeal of its members. \"Fortune Magazine\" said partners talk to each other with \"a sense of personal affection and admiration\". An article in \"The News Observer\" said McKinsey's internal culture was \"collegiate and ruthlessly competitive\" and has been described as arrogant. The \"Wall Street Journal\" said McKinsey is seen as \"elite, loyal and secretive\". According to Reuters, it has a \"button-down culture\" focused on \"playing by the rules\". According to \"BusinessWeek\", some consultants say the firm has strayed from its original values as it increased in size. \"The Guardian\" said at McKinsey \"hours are long, expectations high and failure not acceptable\".\n\nMany of McKinsey's alumni become CEOs of major corporations or hold important government positions. In doing so, they influence the other organization with McKinsey's values and culture. McKinsey's alumni have been appointed as CEOs or high-level executives at Google, American Express, Boeing, IBM, Westinghouse Electric, Sears, AT&T, PepsiCo, and Enron. McKinsey alumni have held positions with Tony Blair's office. Citicorp and Merrill Lynch have also hired many McKinsey alumni. As of 2008, McKinsey alumni held CEO positions with 16 corporations that have more than $2 billion in revenue. The firm was ranked by \"USA Today\" as the most likely company to work for and become a future CEO of a major corporation, with odds of 1 out of 690. McKinsey's consulting work has also been influential in establishing many of the norms of how governments and corporations are run. The company has been influential in the British Department of Health for many years and was heavily involved in the discussions around the Health and Social Care Act 2012.\n\nMcKinsey’s culture has been under scrutiny after a number of scandals the firms was either directly involved in or indirectly associated with. The independent says that ‘McKinsey’s fingerprints can be found at the scene of some of the most spectacular corporate and financial debacles of recent decades', while Reuters names the scandalous incidents ‘not bad apples, [but] a culture of corruption’. McKinsey is in some cases seen as complicit or emblematic for the culture in cases where they did not get prosecuted with criminal charges, or where their former employees engaged in illegal or morally unethical behavior.\n\nEnron was the creation of Jeff Skilling, a proud McKinsey consultant of 21 years, who was jailed after the falldown. The Independent states that McKinsey had ‘fully endorsed the dubious accounting methods that caused the company to implode in 2001’, and that ‘the processes and principles he [Jeff Skilling red.] allowed were very McKinsey. The consultants used Enron as their sandbox.' McKinsey does not disclose the nature of its relationship with Enron other than to confirm it was a client. The Guardian reported that Enron used McKinsey on 20 different projects. However, it must be noted that McKinsey has consistently denied to have given Enron advice on financing issues or that it had suspicions the company was using improper accounting methods. Nor has it been summoned before the Department of Justice to explain its role. Nevertheless, according to the Guardian, ‘Enronitis is virulent’.\n\nMcKinsey is said to have played a significant role in the 2008 financial crisis by promoting the securitization of mortgage assets and encouraged the banks to fund their balance sheets with debt, driving up risk, which ‘poisoned the global financial system and precipitated the 2008 credit meltdown'. Furthermore, McKinsey advised Allstate Insurance to purposefully give low offers to claimants. The Huffington Post revealed that the strategy was to make claims \"so expensive and so time-consuming that lawyers would start refusing to help clients.\" Next to this, 2016 McKinsey partner Navdeep Arora was convicted for illegally depleting State Farm of over $500.000 over a period of 8 years, in collaboration with a State Farm employee.\n\nThe most recent case of indirect involvement concerns Valeant, a Canadian pharmaceutical company investigated by the SEC. Valeant has been alleged of improper accounting, and that it used predatory price hikes to boost growth. The Financial Times states that ‘Valeant’s downfall is not exactly McKinsey’s fault but its fingerprints are everywhere.’ Three out of six senior executives were recent ex-McKinsey employees, as well as the chair of the ‘talent and compensation’ committee.\n\nNevertheless, it must be kept in mind that McKinsey didn’t single-handedly cause the credit meltdown or the Enron scandal. The Independent says that McKinsey ‘just partly facilitated them, and blessed the actions of incompetent and greedy managements with their slick charts and beguiling jargon.' Furthermore, other defenders of McKinsey claim that the firm merely advises, and is not a decision-maker.\n\nMcKinsey & Company provides management consulting services, such as providing advice on an acquisition, developing a plan to restructure a sales force, creating a new business strategy or providing advice on downsizing. Its consultants design and implement studies to evaluate management decisions using data and interviews to test hypotheses. Conclusions of the study are presented to senior management, typically in a PowerPoint presentation and a booklet.\n\nMcKinsey & Company has traditionally charged approximately 25 percent more than competing firms with an average project of one million dollars. Prices were reduced in the economic slump following the dot-com bubble. According to \"The Globe and Mail\", McKinsey clients estimate that the firm's advice turns out to be poor in retrospect about 10 to 20 percent of the time.\n\nA typical McKinsey engagement can last between two and twelve months and involves three to six McKinsey consultants. An engagement is usually managed by a generalist that covers the region the client's headquarters are located in and specialists that have either an industry or functional expertise. Unlike some competing consulting firms, McKinsey does not hold a policy against working for multiple competing companies (although individual consultants are barred from doing so). This has sometimes led to accusations of sharing confidential information or re-packaging a competitor's tactics as best practices.\n\nMarginal abatement cost curves attempt to compare the financial costs of different options for reducing pollution in a region and are used in emissions trading, policy discussions and incentive programs. McKinsey & Company released its first marginal abatement cost (MAC) curve for greenhouse gas emissions in February 2007, which was updated to version two in January 2009. McKinsey & Company's MAC curve has become the most widely used and is the basis for McKinsey’s consulting on climate change and sustainability.\n\nMcKinsey's curve predicts negative cost abatement strategies, which has been controversial among economists. The International Association for Energy Economics said in \"The Energy Journal\" that McKinsey's cost-curve was popular among policymakers, because it suggests they can take \"bold action towards improving energy efficiency without imposing costs on society.\"\n\nIn a 2010 report, the Rainforest Foundation UK said McKinsey's cost curve methodology was misleading for policy decisions regarding the Reduced Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD) program. The report argued that McKinsey's calculations exclude certain implementation and governance costs, which makes it favor industrial uses of forests while discouraging subsistence projects. Greenpeace said the curve has allowed Indonesia and Guyana to win financial incentives from the United Nations by creating inflated estimates of current deforestation so they could demonstrate reductions in comparison. McKinsey said they had made it clear in the cost-curve publications that cost curves do not translate \"mechanically\" into policy implications and that policymakers should consider \"many other factors\" before introducing new laws.\n\nMcKinsey & Company was the first management consultancy to hire recent graduates instead of experienced business managers, when it started doing so in 1953. Less than half of the firm's recruits are from business majors, while others have advanced degrees in science, medicine, engineering or law.\n\nAccording to \"The Observer\", McKinsey recruits recent graduates and \"imbues them with a religious conviction\" in the firm, then culls through them with its \"up-or-out\" policy. The \"up or out\" policy, which was established in 1951, means that consultants that are not being promoted within the firm are asked to leave. About one-fifth of McKinsey's consultants depart under the up or out policy each year. McKinsey's practice of hiring recent graduates and the \"up-or-out\" philosophy, were originally based on Marvin Bower's experiences at the law firm Jones Day in the 1930s, as well as the \"Cravath system\" used at the law firm Cravath, Swaine and Moore.\n\nThere is an ongoing debate within the firm on how fast it should grow. It said the work environment is demanding, involving extensive travel and long hours.\n\nMcKinsey & Company consultants regularly publish books, research and articles about business and management. The firm spends $50–$100 million a year on research. McKinsey was one of the first organizations to fund management research, when it founded the Foundation for Management Research in 1955. The firm began publishing a business magazine,\"The McKinsey Quarterly\", in 1964. It funds the McKinsey Global Institute, which studies global economic trends and was founded in 1990. Many consultants are contributors to the Harvard Business Review. McKinsey consultants published only two books from 1960-1980, then more than 50 from 1980 to 1996. McKinsey's publications and research give the firm a \"quasi-academic\" image.\n\nA McKinsey book, \"In Search of Excellence\", was published in 1982. It featured eight characteristics of successful businesses based on an analysis of 43 top performing companies. It marked the beginning of McKinsey's shift from accounting to \"softer\" aspects of management, like skills and culture. According to David Guest from King's College, \"In Search of Excellence\" became popular among business managers because it was easy to read, well-marketed and some of its core messages were valid. However, it was disliked by academics because of flaws in its methodology. Additionally, a 1984 analysis by \"BusinessWeek\" found that many of those companies identified as \"excellent\" in the book no longer met the criteria only two years later.\n\nA 1997 article and a book it published in 2001 on \"The War for Talent\"\nprompted academics and the business community to start focusing more on talent management. The authors found that the best-performing companies were \"obsessed\" with acquiring and managing the best talent. They advocated that companies rank employees by their performance and promote \"stars\", while targeting under-performers for improvement or layoffs. After the book was published, Enron, a company which followed many of its principles, was involved in a scandal that led to its bankruptcy. In May 2001, a Stanford professor wrote a paper critical of the \"War on Talent\" arguing that it prioritized individuals at the expense of the larger organization.\n\nMcKinsey consultants published \"Creative Destruction\" in 2001. The book suggested that CEOs need to be willing to change or rebuild a company, rather than protect what they have created. It found that out of the first S&P 500 list from 1957, only 74 were still in business by 1998. The \"New York Times\" said it \"makes a cogent argument that in times of rampant, uncertain change ... established companies are handcuffed by success.\" In 2009, McKinsey consultants published \"The Alchemy of Growth\", which established three \"horizons\" for growth: core enhancements, new growth platforms and options. \n\nIn February 2011, McKinsey surveyed 1,300 US private-sector employers on their expected response to the Affordable Care Act (ACA). 30 percent of respondents said they anticipated they would probably or definitely stop offering employer sponsored health coverage after the ACA went into effect in 2014. These results, published in June 2011 in the McKinsey e-Quarterly, became \"a useful tool for critics of the ACA and a deep annoyance for defenders of the law\" according to an article in TIME Magazine. Supporters of healthcare reform argued the survey far surpassed estimates by the Congressional Budget Office and insisted that McKinsey disclose the survey's methodology. Two weeks after publishing the survey results, McKinsey released the contents of the survey including the questionnaire and 206-pages of survey data. In its accompanying statement, McKinsey said it was intended to capture the attitude of employers at a certain point in time, not make a prediction.\n\nSince 1990, McKinsey has been publishing \"\", a textbook on valuation. The book is now available in its sixth edition.\n\nAccording to \"The Firm\", McKinsey has been influential in establishing the norms of business, such as working in large-scale office settings. According to a 1993 profile in \"Fortune\" magazine, \"while McKinsey has consulted for many of the current era's great successes... it has also been a fixture at many of the big losers.\" In \"The Firm\", author Duff McDonald said McKinsey helped restructure the White House, guided corporations through large-scale re-organizations in post-war Europe and facilitated turn-arounds, but in other cases advised companies to adopt strategies that led to their collapse or was unable to prevent an impending bankruptcy. It said\n\nMcKinsey was a major player in the efficiency boom in the 1920s, the postwar gigantism of the 1940s, the rationalization of government and rise of marketing in the 1950s, the age of corporate influence in the 1960s, the restructuring of America and rise of strategy in the 1970s, the massive growth in information technology in the 1980s, the globalization of the 1990s, and the boom-bust-and-cleanup of the 2000s.\n\nMcKinsey & Company's founder, James O. McKinsey, introduced the concept of budget planning as a management framework in his fifth book \"Budgetary Control\" in 1922. The firm's first client was the treasurer of Armour & Company, who, along with other early McKinsey clients, had read \"Budgetary Control\". In 1931 McKinsey created a methodology for analyzing a company called the General Survey Outline (GSO), which was established based on ideas introduced in the 1924 book \"Business Administration\". It was also known as the Banker's Survey, because McKinsey's clients who used it in the 1930s were predominantly banks. After the Wagner Act gave certain rights to employees to organize into unions in 1935, McKinsey started consulting corporations on employee relations. Later in the 1950s, the work of a McKinsey consultant on compensation was influential in \"skyrocketing executive pay\". It also helped many companies such as Heinz, IBM and Hoover expand into Europe.\n\nIn the 1940s, McKinsey helped many corporations convert into wartime production for World War II. It also helped organize NASA into an organization that relies heavily on contractors in 1958. McKinsey created a report in 1953 for Dwight Eisenhower that was used to guide government appointments. In 1973, McKinsey & Company led a project for a consortium of grocery chains represented by the U.S. Supermarket Ad Hoc Committee on a Uniform Grocery Product Code to create the barcode. According to the book \"Business Research Methods\", the barcode became commonplace after a study by McKinsey persuaded Krogers to adopt it.\n\nIn the 1970s and 1980s, McKinsey helped European companies change their organizational structure to M-form (Multidivisional Form), which organizes the company into semi-autonomous divisions that function around a product, industry or customer, rather than a function or expertise. In the 1980s, AT&T reduced investments in cell towers due to McKinsey's prediction that there would only be 900,000 cell phone subscribers by 2000. According to \"The Firm\" this was \"laughably off the mark\" from the 109 million cellular subscribers by 2000. At the time cell phones were bulky and expensive. The firm helped the Dutch government facilitate a turnaround for Hoogovens, the world's largest steel company as of 2013, through a $1 billion bankruptcy bailout. It also implemented a turnaround for the city of Glasgow, which had problems with unemployment and crime. McKinsey created the corporate structure for NationsBank, when it was still a small company known as North Carolina National Bank. McKinsey was hired by General Motors to do a large-scale re-organization to help it compete with Japanese auto-makers. The book \"The Firm\" said it was an \"unmitigated disaster\" because McKinsey focused on corporate structure, whereas GM needed to compete with Japanese automakers through manufacturing process improvement. A McKinsey consultant said GM did not follow their advice.\n\nA 2002 article in \"BusinessWeek\" said that a series of bankruptcies of McKinsey clients, such as Swissair, Kmart, and Global Crossing, in the 1990s raised questions as to whether McKinsey was responsible or had a lapse in judgement. McKinsey recommended that Swissair avoid high operating costs in its home country by developing partnerships with airlines based in other regions. In order to attract partners, Swissair acquired more than $1 billion in shares of other airlines, many of which were failing. This led to huge losses for Swissair.\n\nPrior to the Enron scandal, McKinsey helped it shift from an oil and gas production company into an electric commodities trader, which led to significant growth in profits and revenues. According to \"The Independent\", there was \"no suggestion that McKinsey was complicit in the subsequent scandal, [but] critics say the arrogance of Enron's leaders is emblematic of the McKinsey culture.\" The government did not investigate McKinsey, who said they did not provide advice on Enron's accounting, but some questioned whether McKinsey knew about Enron's accounting problems or ignored warning signs.\n\nFormer \"Financial Times\" journalist Duff McDonald said McKinsey's confidentiality policy often prevents the public from becoming informed about the firm's work, except after it is exposed through lawsuits or investigations. 13,000 McKinsey documents were released as part of a lawsuit against Allstate, which showed that McKinsey recommended the company reduce payouts to insurance claimants by offering low settlements, delaying processing to wear out claimants through attrition, and fighting customers that protest in court. Allstate's profits doubled over ten years after adopting McKinsey's strategy, but it also led to lawsuits alleging they were cheating claimants out of legitimate insurance claims.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "4467194", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4467194", "title": "Meat raffle", "text": "Meat raffle\n\nA meat raffle is a tradition of raffling off meat, often in pubs and bars in Australia, in some areas of the USA, and in Western Canada. In most parts of Britain and Canada a meat raffle is known as a meat draw.\nIn some cases the raffle is operated by a designated charity, though in Britain most of the proceeds are spent on prizes and the raffle is run as a social occasion and a method of enticing customers into a local pub. The meat ranges in animal and cut and often comes from local butchers.\n\nIn the UK, a typical meat raffle would have approximately 25-30 tickets sold at £1 each, though there is considerable variation and some raffles are much larger. Depending on the specific raffle, when a winning number is called the winner can either pick their cut of meat or opt for a gift certificate. All proceeds typically go to a charity.\n\nAlso simply known as a meat tray, the tradition is well known in Australian and New Zealand pubs. The trays of meat raffled vary in content: a barbecue style mix of steaks, lamb chops, sausages etc. is the most common, however \"breakfast trays\" (bacon, eggs, sausages) and \"seafood trays\" (prawns, oysters, mussels) are also common. Meat trays are usually raffled to raise money for local sporting teams, often those associated with the particular pub the raffle occurs in. The proceeds often help fund the team's end of season trip.\nCare must be taken with seafood trays given the propensity for the contents to spoil in the heat as the lucky winner continues drinking; often a friendly publican will store the tray in the fridge until the winner is sufficiently refreshed and ready to head home. \n\nAn Australian variant of the meat raffle is the chook raffle, where a chicken is raffled off. A Canadian variant popular primarily in the Sudbury area is \"Porketta Bingo\", in which a traditional Italian porchetta is given as a prize in a card game as a fundraiser for local minor hockey leagues.\n\nPart of the interval at the BDO World Darts Championship includes a meat raffle to raise funds for youth teams.\n\nThe Dave TV comedy show \"Compete for the Meat\", hosted by Al Murray, is loosely based on the concept of a meat raffle.\n\n"}

{"id": "1979154", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1979154", "title": "Michael Colvin", "text": "Michael Colvin\n\nMichael Keith Beale Colvin (27 September 1932 – 24 February 2000) was a politician in the United Kingdom. He was first elected as a Conservative Party Member of Parliament for Bristol North West in 1979. From 1983 onwards, he was the MP for Romsey and Waterside constituency in Hampshire, which later became the constituency of Romsey.\n\nMichael Colvin was born to Captain Ivan Beale Colvin RN and Joy Arbuthnot. He had a brother, Alistair Colvin, four years his junior. He was educated at West Downs School in Winchester, Eton College; and the Royal Military Academy at Sandhurst. Joining the Grenadier Guards at 18, he served in Berlin, Suez and Cyprus, emerging as a captain. After studying at the Royal Agricultural College at Cirencester, he initially worked for four years in advertising with the agency J Walter Thompson, then for 14 years as a director of Accrep Ltd, a property investment firm.\n\nActive in local government at first, he was an elected member of Tangley parish council, Andover rural district council and Hampshire County Council. He had left Hampshire local government by the mid-1970s\n\nHis first parliamentary seat was Bristol North West, which he gained from Labour in 1979, when Margaret Thatcher achieved power, but he was then considered to be one of the \"wets\", and thus under Thatcher likely to remain a backbencher.\n\nColvin showed political ambivalence, however, he urged the creation of a new centre party on the one hand, but also called for privatisation of NHS. In 1983, he switched to the newly created and much safer seat of Romsey and Waterside, near Southampton. As a Cayzer son-in-law, he opposed the phasing out of tax allowances on new shipbuilding and urged a larger, more modern merchant marine fleet. He opposed the slicing off of BA's routes just when it was becoming successful. He favoured easier conditions for pub licencees.\n\nOpposed to bans on foxhunting, Colvin was the chairman of the Council for Country Sports from 1988, Colvin rejected gun-control; he was a leading figure, following the Hungerford and Dunblane massacres in the \"gun lobby\". He was a defence and aviation specialist, serving on the Defence Select Committee, which he chaired from 1995 to 1997, leaving it in January 2000. However, he was not politically consistent with the right-wing of the Conservatives; he was liberal on abortion and favoured free eye and dental treatment, In 1989 he sponsored a Private Member's Bill which became the Computer Misuse Act 1990.\n\nColvin became the chairman of the Conservative Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs Committee. He supported the South-African-backed anti-SWAPO white forces in Africa and endorsed the regime in Namibia in 1981. In his \"Guardian\" obituary of Colvin, Andrew Roth wrote that the MP \"was also a somewhat secretive former propagandist for apartheid South Africa\". He defended the whites of southern Africa, accepting invitations to visit South Africa, then under apartheid, and Bophuthatswana, a Bantustan ('homeland') set up for blacks by the South African government. He urged that the 'homelands', which were not internationally recognised, should be accepted. Although he supported reformist Denis Worrall's election campaign in 1987, the following year he criticised the BBC for broadcasting the concert tribute to Nelson Mandela. Colvin visited Bophuthatswana again, and Angola, in 1989 as a guest of UNITA, an organisation backed by the CIA and South Africa. Connected to the Strategic Network International (SNI), a lobbyist front set up in 1985 to campaign against the imposition of economic sanctions against South Africa, Colvin was involved in finding sympathetic Conservative MPs to visit the 'homelands' on expenses paid trips. The Conservative activist Derek Laud was involved in SNI and was responsible for recommending Colvin to the group.\n\nIn 1991, Colvin became a consultant to SNI (at £10,000 a year), in succession to Neil Hamilton. Colvin, with Conservative colleagues John Carlisle and David Atkinson were among members of SNI sent to watch the peace process in Angola during 1992. SNI dissolved the following year. His consultancy with SNI was not declared, and when the connection became known in 1994, the media linked the issue to then on-going Cash-for-questions affair: \"It was not registered. It is an oversight which I regret\", Colvin said. At this time, among 11 Conservative MPs, he was found by the Commons Select Committee on Members' Interests to have failed to declare, as a Lloyd's 'Name', details of his syndicate's activities, specifically the areas of insurance underwritten. He was a friend to lobbyists such as Ian Greer, more directly implicated in the cash for questions scandal, which led to Hamilton's disgrace. Later, Colvin became a director, with Derek Laud, of the Laud Ludgate lobbying organisation.\n\nHe married Nichola Cayzer, the daughter of William Cayzer, Baron Cayzer, an executive in the British and Commonwealth shipping company. The couple had three children; two daughters and a son.\n\nColvin and his wife died in a fire at their house, Tangley House, near Andover in February 2000. The following by-election led to the Liberal Democrat gaining the seat with their candidate Sandra Gidley being elected.\n"}

The use of music to cope with stress is an example of an emotion-focused, adaptive coping strategy. Rather than focusing on the stressor itself, music therapy is typically geared towards reducing or eliminating the emotions that arise in response to stress. In essence, advocates of this therapy claim that the use of music helps to lower stress levels in patients, as well as lower more biologically measurable quantities such as the levels of epinephrine and cortisol. Additionally, music therapy programs have been repeatedly demonstrated to reduce depression and anxiety symptoms in the long term.\n\nIn the context of psychology, a \"coping strategy\" is any technique or practice designed to reduce or manage the negative effects associated with stress. While stress is known to be a natural biological response, biologists and psychologists have repeatedly demonstrated that stress in excess can lead to negative effects on one's physical and psychological well-being. Elevated stress levels can lead to conditions including mental illnesses, cardiovascular conditions, eating disorders, gastrointestinal complications, sexual dysfunction, and skin and hair problems. The variety and potential fatality from these conditions push the need for a coping mechanism to reduce the manifestations associated with stress. \n\nWhile there are hundreds of different coping strategies, the use of music is one specific example of a coping strategy that is used to combat the negative effects of stress. Due to the substantially large number of strategies to choose from, psychologists break down coping strategies into three types:\n\nSince music-based coping is designed to modify an individual's emotional reactions to a certain event, it is best classified as an \"emotion-based\" coping strategy. Rather than attempting to directly influence or eliminate a particular stressor, music-based coping relies on influencing an individual's emotional and mental reaction to the stressor. Music assuages stress by either reducing or altering emotional response or alleviate some of the physiological effects of the stress response. \n\nPsychologists and medical practitioners have recently focused more time and attention on the concept of music as a coping strategy and the effects of its use on patients. In literature linking music and stress, empirical findings are typically grouped together according to the method in which they are gathered. For example, some methods may include studies like survey questions or more invasive methods of study like invasive psychoacoustic observations. Despite the fact that different methods are used, most of these studies demonstrate the impact different types of music have on human emotions. \n\nOne of the more popular methods used to collect data on coping strategies involves the use of non-invasive, patient response-based methods. This method is directed more towards the psychological realm, in that the methods used to collect data were not very invasive but more of a “tell me how you feel” type of question/response system. Once the findings had been gathered, statistical analysis was performed in an effort to discover a correlation between the coping mechanism and its effect on the stress response. These non-invasive treatments are more popular among children and elderly patients, since they prevent the results from being altered due to the patients's nervousness. Proponents of these methods claim that if children are prompted with general, unthreatening questions, they are much more comfortable and willing to provide accurate accounts of their levels of stress. In several studies using non-invasive methods, music has been documented as being effective in reducing the subject's perceived level of stress.\n\nPosttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a psychological stress disorder that involves the experience of strong emotional reactions due to traumatic events in an individual's past. PTSD is almost always a result of a traumatic experience. Certain triggers, such as images, sounds, or other significant sensory details associated with the experience can evoke extreme stress responses, panic attacks, or severe anxiety. PTSD is commonly experienced by veterans of armed conflicts, and can be frequently diagnosed in victims of rape or other violent assaults.\n\nIf an individual diagnosed with PTSD associates a certain song with a traumatic memory, it typically triggers a stronger stress/anxiety response than the individual would otherwise have otherwise experienced when listening to the song. While one cannot assume that music is the only factor that triggers PTSD-influenced stress and panic attacks, these can be especially memorable because of music’s rhythm, beat, and/or memorable lyrics. However, associating music with psychological responses is not necessarily guaranteed to bring up bad memories, because music can often hold psychological connotations to very happy memories. For example, it has been demonstrated that supplying the residents of nursing homes with iPods that feature nostalgic music is a means of reducing the stress of the elderly.\n\nMusic has been used to treat dementia patients by utilizing methods similar to the treatments that are used in the management of PTSD. However, in the treatment of dementia, more emphasis is placed on providing the patient with music that triggers pleasant memories or feelings, rather than avoiding music that triggers negative emotions. After the music is listened to, one sees the change in mood and attitude from closed and distant to joyful, open and happy.\n\nThere is a wealth of anecdotal evidence demonstrating the effectiveness that music can have as a coping response in this regard. For example, if a patient of either PTSD or dementia were to have a loved one die, he or she might associate a certain song with the person being mourned for, and hearing that song could bring about feelings of happiness or deep sadness. In addition, if there was a certain connection between them, such as in marriage, and their wedding song came on, an overly powerful emotional reaction could occur. These overly emotional situations trigger memories and a stress response that anguishes the person remembering these hurtful memories. A certain song that pertains to that memory can trigger nearly any emotion.\n\nMusic’s effects on Dementia patients have shown to bring them out of their shell, and engage them in singing and being happy, opposed to their usual closed and distant personalities. The patients have been shown to sing and perk up, even cry out of pure joy of the music that they loved in their youth. After the patients listen to their music they were interviewed and actually engaged, because of how happy the music had made them. The patients talked about how much they loved the music and the memories that the music invoked.\n\nThe use of music as a coping strategy also has applications in the medical field. For example, patients who listen to music during surgery or post-operative recovery have been shown to have less stress than their counterparts who do not listen to music. Studies have shown that the family members and parents of the patient had reduced stress levels when listening to music while waiting, and can even reduce their anxiety for the surgery results. The use of music has also been proven effective in pediatric oncology. Music therapy is mainly used in these cases as a diversion technique, play therapy, designed to distract the patient from the pain or stress experienced during these operations. The focus of the patient is directed at a more pleasurable activity and the mind shifts toward that activity creating a “numbing” effect founded on an “out of sight, out of mind” type approach. This can even transcend to elderly patients in nursing homes and adult day care centers. Music therapy in these places have shown reductions in elder aggression and agitated moods. However, because several of these studies rely mainly on patient responses, some concerns have been raised as to the strength of the correlation between music and stress reduction.\n\nMusic as a form of coping has been used multiple times in cancer patients, with promising results. A study done on 113 patients going through stem cell transplants split the patients into two group; one group made their own lyrics about their journey and then produced a music video, and the other group listened to audiobooks. The results of the study showed that the music video group had better coping skills and better social interactions in comparison, by taking their mind of the pain and stress accompanying treatment, and giving them an outlet to express their feelings.\n\nAnother study done at UNC showed remarkable improvement in a young girl who was born without the ability to speak. A therapist would come in and sing with her, as the only thing she could do was sing. Miraculously, the singing allowed to her gain the ability of speech, as music and speech are similar in nature and help the brain form new connections. In the same hospital, the therapist visits children daily and plays music with them, singing and using instruments. The music fosters creativity and reduces stress associated with treatments, and takes the children's minds off of their current surroundings.\n\nIt also cannot be ignored the importance of coping strategies in families and caregivers of those going through serious and even terminal illness. These family members are often responsible for a vast majority of the care of their loved ones, on top of the stress of seeing them struggle. Therapists have worked with these family members, singing and playing instruments, to help them take their minds off of the stress of helping their loved ones undergo treatment. Just like in the patients themselves, the music therapy has been shown to help them cope with the intense emotions and situations they deal with on a daily basis.\n\nOther studies, which use more invasive techniques to measure the response of individuals to stress, demonstrate that the use of music can mitigate many of the physiological effects often associated with the stress response - such as a lowering of blood pressure or a decrease in heart rate. Most research associated with the use of music as a coping strategy makes use of empirical measurements through devices like an EKG or heart rate monitor in order to provide a stronger correlation between music and its proposed effects on the stress response. In these studies, subjects are typically exposed to a stressor and then assigned music to listen to, while the parties conducting the study measure changes in the subjects' physiological status.\n\nSome studies, using more invasive physiological research methods, have demonstrated that the use of sedative music or preferred sedative music cause a decrease in tension and state-anxiety levels of adult individuals. This decrease in tension or feeling of anxiety is more prevalent and noticeable in the attempt to return to homeostasis, and shows far less effectiveness during the actual stressful event. Other studies expose their subjects to an immediate physical stressor, such as running on a treadmill, while having them listen to different genres of music. These studies have shown that the respiratory rates of the participants are increased when they listen to faster, upbeat music while running in comparison to no music or sedative music. In addition to the raised respiratory frequency caused by the initial stressor \"running\" music still had a noticeable physiological effect on the participants.\n\nBy and large, a collective review of these studies shows that music can be effective in reducing physiological effects that stress has on the human body. This can be anywhere from changing pulse rates, breathing rates, to even decreasing the occurrence of fatigue. This can even be seen in different tempo's and pitch, such as low pitch creates a relatively calming effect on the body whereas high pitch tends to generate stressors for the body. Furthermore, it has been suggested that if a patient can control the music that he or she listens to in the recovery process, then the return to normalcy happens at a much faster, more efficient rate than if the subject was assigned a music genre that he or she did not find appealing. With the use of the EKG monitor and other empirical methods of study, researchers are able to remove the superficial qualities associated with patient response-based findings and provide a more substantial correlation between the use of music and the its effects on the human stress response.\n\nOne particular technique that uses music as a coping strategy is choosing and listening to music genres that have been shown to correlate with lower levels of stress. For example, it has been suggested that listening to classical music or self-selected music can lower stress levels in adult individuals. Music that is fast, heavy or even dark in nature may produce an increase in these same stress levels, however many people also find the cathartic effects of music to be intensified with the listening of music that is intense in such a way. Ambient music is a genre of music that is often associated with feelings of calmness or introspectiveness. While listening to self-selected genres, an individual is provided with a sense of control after choosing the type of music he or she would like to listen to. In certain situations, this choice can be one of the few moments where stressed and depressed individuals feel a locus of control over their respective lives. Introducing the feeling of control can be a valuable asset as the individual attempts to cope with his or her stress.\n\nWith that in mind, there are a few specific techniques specifically involving the use of music that have been suggested to aid in the reduction of stress and stress-related effects.\n\n\nAnother specific technique that can be used is the utilization of music as a “memory time machine” of sorts. In this regard, music can allow one to escape to pleasant or unpleasant memories and trigger a coping response. It has been suggested that music can be closely tied to re-experiencing the psychological aspects of past memories, so selecting music with positive connotations is one possible way that music can reduce stress.\n\nA technique that is starting to be employed more often is vibroacoustic therapy. During therapy the patient lies on his/her back on a mat with speakers within it that send out low frequency sound waves, essentially sitting on a subwoofer. This therapy has been found to help with Parkinson's disease, fibromyalgia, and depression. Studies are also being conducted on patients with mild Alzheimer's disease in hopes to identify possible benefits from vibroacoustic therapy. Vibroacoustic therapy can also be used as an alternative to music therapy for the deaf. \n\nSeveral of the empirical studies carried out to demonstrate the correlation between listening to music and the reduction in the human stress response have been criticized for relying too heavily on a small sample size. Another criticism of these studies is that they have been carried out in response to no stressor in particular. These critics claim that because no specific stressor is identified in many of these studies, it is somewhat difficult to identify whether the stress response was lessened by music or by some other means.\n\nA more theoretical critique of this coping strategy is that the use of music in stress coping is largely a short-term coping response and therefore lacks long-term sustainability. These critics argue that while music may be effective in lowering perceived stress levels of patients, it is not necessarily making a difference on the actual cause of the stress response. Because the root cause of the stress is not affected, it is possible that the stress response may return shortly after therapy is ended. Those who hold this position advocate instead for a more problem-focused coping strategy that directly deals with the stressors affecting the patient.\n\nThe use of music as a stress coping strategy has a demonstrated effect on the human response to stress. The use of music has been proven to lower the perceived levels of stress in patients, while greatly reducing the physical manifestations of stress as well– such as heart rate, blood pressure, or levels of stress hormones. It seems as though different types of music have different effects on stress levels, with classical and self-selected genres being the most effective. However, despite demonstrated effectiveness in empirical studies, there are many who still question the effectiveness of this coping strategy. Nevertheless, it is still an attractive option for some patients who want an easy and inexpensive way to respond to stress.\n\n"}
{"id": "37431639", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37431639", "title": "Necroptosis", "text": "Necroptosis\n\nNecroptosis is a programmed form of necrosis, or inflammatory cell death. Conventionally, necrosis is associated with unprogrammed cell death resulting from cellular damage or infiltration by pathogens, in contrast to orderly, programmed cell death via apoptosis. The discovery of necroptosis showed that cells can execute necrosis in a programmed fashion and that apoptosis is not always the preferred form of cell death. Furthermore, the immunogenic nature of necroptosis favors its participation in certain circumstances, such as aiding defense pathogens by the immune system. Necroptosis is well defined as a viral defense mechanism, allowing the cell to undergo \"cellular suicide\" in a caspase-independent fashion in the presence of viral caspase inhibitors to restrict virus replication. In addition to being a response to disease, necroptosis has also been characterized as a component of inflammatory diseases such as Crohn's disease, pancreatitis, and myocardial infarction.\n\nThe signaling pathway responsible for carrying out necroptosis is generally understood. TNFα leads to stimulation of its receptor TNFR1. TNFR1 binding protein TNFR-associated death protein TRADD and TNF receptor-associated factor 2 TRAF2 signals to RIPK1 which recruits RIPK3 forming the necrosome also named . Phosphorylation of MLKL by the ripoptosome drives oligomerization of MLKL, allowing MLKL to insert into and permeabilize plasma membranes and organelles. Integration of MLKL leads to the inflammatory phenotype and release of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), which elicit immune responses.\n\nNecroptosis is specific to vertebrates and may have originated as an additional defense to pathogens. Necroptosis also acts as an alternative \"fail-safe\" cell death pathway in cases where cells are unable to undergo apoptosis, such as during viral infection in which apoptosis signaling proteins are blocked by the virus.\n\nCell suicide is an effective means of stemming the spread of a pathogen throughout an organism. In apoptotic responses to infection, the contents of an infected cell (including the pathogen) are contained and engulfed by phagocytosis. Some pathogens, such as human cytomegalovirus, express caspase inhibitors that arrest the apoptotic machinery of the host cell. The caspase-independence of necroptosis allows the cell to bypass caspase activation, decreasing the time during which the pathogen can inhabit the cell.\n\nToll-like receptors (TLRs) can also signal to the necrosome, leading to necroptosis. TLRs are a class of receptors that function in the innate immune system to recognize conserved components of pathogens, such as flagellin.\n\nIn apoptosis, extrinsic signaling via cell surface receptors or intrinsic signaling by release of cytochrome c from mitochondria leads to caspase activation. Proteolytic degradation of the cell's interior culminates with the packaging of the cell's remains into apoptotic bodies, which are degraded and recycled by phagocytosis. Unlike in apoptosis, necrosis and necroptosis do not involve caspase activation. Necrotic cell death culminates in leakage of cell contents into the extracellular space, in contrast to the organized disposal of cellular contents into apoptotic bodies.\n\nAs in all forms of necrotic cell death, cells undergoing necroptosis rupture and leak their contents into the intercellular space. Unlike in necrosis, permeabilization of the cell membrane during necroptosis is tightly regulated. While many of these mechanisms and components of the pathway are still being uncovered, the major steps of necroptotic signaling have been outlined in recent years. First, extrinsic stimulus through the TNF receptor by TNFα signals the recruitment of the TNF receptor-associated death domain (TRADD) which in turn recruits RIPK1. In the absence of active Caspase 8, RIPK1 and RIPK3 auto- and transphosphorylate each other, leading to the formation of a microfilament-like complex called the necrosome. The necrosome then activates the pro-necroptotic protein MLKL via phosphorylation. MLKL actuates the necrosis phenotype by inserting into the bilipid membranes of organelles and plasma membrane leading to expulsion of cellular contents into the extracellular space. The inflammatory rupturing of the cell releases Damage Associated Molecular Patterns (DAMPs) into the extracellular space. Many of these DAMPs remain unidentified, however, the \"find me\" and \"eat me\" DAMP signals are known to recruit immune cells to the damaged/infected tissue. Necrotic cells are cleared from the immune system by a mechanism called pinocytosis, or cellular drinking, which is mediated by macropinosomes, a subcellular component of macrophages. This process is in contrast to removal of apoptotic cells by the immune system in which cells are removed via phagocytosis, or cellular eating.\n\nRecent studies have shown substantial interplay between the apoptosis and necroptosis pathways. At multiple stages of their respective signalling cascades, the two pathways can regulate each other. The best characterized example of this co-regulation is the ability of caspase 8 to inhibit the formation of the necrosome by cleaving RIPK1. Conversely, caspase 8 inhibition of necroptosis can be bypassed by the necroptotic machinery through the anti-apoptotic protein cFLIP which inactivates caspase 8 through formation of a heterodimer.\n\nMany components of the two pathways are also shared. The Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor can signal for both apoptosis and necroptosis. The RIPK1 protein can also signal for both apoptosis and necroptosis depending on post-translational modifications mediated by other signalling proteins. Furthermore, RIPK1 can be regulated by cellular inhibitor of apoptosis proteins 1 and 2 (cIAP1, cIAP2) which polyubiquitinate RIPK1 leading to cell survival through downstream NF-kB signalling. cIAP1 and cIAP2 can also be regulated by the pro-apoptotic protein SMAC (second mitochondria-derived activator of caspases) which can cleave cIAP1 and cIAP2 driving the cell towards an apoptotic death.\n\nCells can undergo necroptosis in response to perturbed homeostasis in specific circumstances. In response to DNA damage, the RIPK1 and RIPK3 are phosphorylated and lead to deterioration of the cell in the absence of caspase activation. The necrosome inhibits the adenine nucleotide translocase in mitochondria to decrease cellular ATP levels. Uncoupling of the mitochondrial electron transport chain leads to additional mitochondrial damage and opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore, which releases mitochondrial proteins into the cytosol. The necrosome also causes leakage of lysosomal digestive enzymes into the cytoplasm by induction of reactive oxygen species by JNK, sphingosine production, and calpain activation by calcium release.\n\nNecroptosis has been implicated in the pathology of many types of acute tissue damage, including myocardinal infarction, stroke, ischemia-reperfusion injury. In addition, necroptosis is noted to contribute to atherosclerosis, pancreatitis, inflammatory bowel disease, neurodegeneration, and some cancers.\n\nIn solid-organ transplantation, ischemia-reperfusion injury can occur when blood returns to tissue for the first time in the transplant recipient. A major contributor to tissue damage results from activation of regulated necroptosis, which could include contributions from both necroptosis and mitochondrial permeability transition. Treatment with the drug cyclosporine, which represses the mitochondrial permeability transition effector Cyclophilin D, improves tissue survival primarily by inhibiting necrotic cell death, rather than its additional function as an immunosuppressant.\n\nRecently, necroptosis-based cancer therapy, using a distinctive molecular pathway for regulation of necroptosis, has been suggested as an alternative method to overcome apoptosis-resistance. For instance, necroptotic cells release highly immunogenic DAMPs, initiating adaptive immunity. These dying cells can also activate NF-κB to express cytokines, recruiting macrophages. little is known about negative regulators of necroptosis, but CHIP, cFLIP and FADD appear to be potential targets for necroptosis based therapy.\n"}

The three-dimensional simulation is an experimental tool which can be used to study the morphogenesis of fungal hyphal networks. \n\nThe modelling process starts from the proposition that each hypha in the fungal mycelium generates a certain abstract field that (like known physical fields) decrease with increasing distance. Both scalar and vector fields are included in the models. The field(s) and its (their) gradient(s) are used to inform the algorithm that calculates the likelihood of branching, the angle of branching and the growth direction of each hyphal tip in the simulated mycelium. The growth vector is being informed of its surroundings so, effectively, the virtual hyphal tip is sensing the neighbouring mycelium. This is why we call it the Neighbour-Sensing model.\n\nCross-walls in living hyphae are formed only at right angles to the long axis of the hypha. A daughter hyphal apex can only arise if a branch is initiated. So, for the fungi, hyphal branch formation is the equivalent of cell division in animals, plants and protists. The position of origin of a branch, and its direction and rate of growth are the main formative events in the development of fungal tissues and organs. Consequently, by simulating the mathematics of the control of hyphal growth and branching the Neighbour-Sensing model provides the user with a way of experimenting with features that may regulate hyphal growth patterns during morphogenesis to arrive at suggestions that could be tested with live fungi.\n\nThe model was proposed by Audrius Meškauskas and David Moore in 2004 and developed using the supercomputing facilities of the University of Manchester.\nThe key idea of this model is that all parts of the fungal mycelium have identical field generation systems, field sensing mechanisms and growth direction altering algorithms. Under properly chosen model parameters it is possible to observe the transformation of the initial unordered mycelium structure into various forms, some of them being very like natural fungal fruit bodies and other complex structures.\n\nIn one of the simplest examples, it is assumed that the hyphal tips try to keep a 45 degree orientation with relation to the Earth’s gravity vector field, and also generate some kind of scalar field that the growing tips try to avoid. This combination of parameters leads to development of hollow conical structures, similar to the fruit bodies of some primitive fungi.\n\nIn another example, the hypha generates a vector field parallel to the hyphal axis, and the tips tend to turn parallel to that field. After more tips turn in the same direction, their hyphae form a stronger directional field. In this way, it is possible to observe spontaneous orientation of growing hypha in a single direction, which simulates the strands, cords and rhizomorphs produced by many species of fungi in nature.\nThe parameters under which the model operates can be changed during its execution. This allows a greater variety of structures to be formed (including mushroom - like shapes) and may be supposed to simulate cases where the growth strategy depends on an internal biological clock.\nThe Neighbour-Sensing model explains how various fungal structures may arise because of the ‘crowd behaviour’ of the community of hyphal tips that make up the mycelium.\n\n\nFurther details are available from these websites: (primary) and (mirror). The programs, with extensive documentation, are distributed as freeware by both these sites.\n"}

{"id": "39230859", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=39230859", "title": "No Other Way Out", "text": "No Other Way Out\n\nNo Other Way Out: States and Revolutionary Movements, 1945-1991 is a book written by Jeff Goodwin. It analyzes revolutions through the state-centered perspective.\n\nIn \"No Other Way Out: States and Revolutionary Movements, 1945-1991\", \nGoodwin offers another comparative study on revolutions focusing on the second half of the twentieth century from 1914 to 1991. According to \nGoodwin, “revolutionary movements are not simply or exclusively a response to economic exploitation or inequality, but also and more directly a response to political oppression and violence, typically brutal and indiscriminate”. This idea is Goodwin’s main thesis throughout the book and he further expands on it. Goodwin believes that understanding revolutions is “worthwhile not only because of the enormous importance of these movements for the national societies in which they occurred, but also for their effects on the configuration of power and beliefs in other societies and thus on the international balance of power as well\". This comparative study on revolutions is worthwhile because it is different from all the others that exist. First, Goodwin uses a unique set of revolutions and revolutionary movements to analyze, making this analysis interesting and very instructive. Second, Goodwin analyzes not only those revolutions that were successful; he also includes failed revolutionary movements that did not succeed. By analyzing these failed revolutions, Goodwin is able to analyze the reasons why some revolutions occur and others simply deteriorate. Goodwin’s goal for his analysis on revolutions is “to discover the general causal mechanics that do the most to explain the origins and trajectory of several important revolutionary movements\". Before beginning to analyze revolutions Goodwin’s guess is that, “the diverse political fortunes of the revolutionary movements in peripheral societies during this era were not fortuitous nor randomly distributed, but were the result of general causal mechanisms” \n(2001:8).\n\nGoodwin offers a definition of several important key terms that he will use throughout his analysis. To commence, he acknowledges that there are two different definitions for revolutions. For the first definition, the term revolution can “refer to any and all instances in which a state or political regime is overthrown and thereby transformed by a popular movement in an irregular, extra constitutional, and/or violent fashion” (Goodwin 2009:9) With this interpretation, there needs to be a mobilization of people against the state. The second definition states that “revolutions entail not only mass mobilization and regime change, but also more or less rapid and fundamental social, economic, and/or cultural change during or soon after the struggle for state power” (Goodwin 2001:8). Goodwin chooses the concept from the concept of the first revolution since it is more general and includes many more revolutionary movements.\n\nGoodwin also defines other important terms that will be essential to his theory. Political context is defined as, “the ways in which a national society, or some component of it, is governed and regulated by, has access to, and otherwise relates to the national state as well as to the larger state system” (Goodwin 2001: 14). To Goodwin, political concept is the single most important factor that explains the formation and fate of revolutionary movements. Lastly he defines peripheral state as “a state whose power and projects are more or less strictly determine or at least very tightly constrained by a much more powerful ‘core’ or ‘metropolitan’ state within the state system” (Goodwin 2001:14). Throughout his theory, Goodwin will use these terms in order to further his argument and it is essential to define them correctly.\n\nBefore Goodwin offers his own theory on revolutions, he first discusses two other popular theories, the modernization theory and the Marxist theory. The “modernization theory links revolutions to the transitions from traditional to modern societies, that is, to the very process of modernization itself” (Goodwin 2001:17). Those who believe in the Marxist theory, “view revolutions as occurring in ‘transitional’ societies- only in this case transition which is seen as the result of class struggle, is from one economic mode of production to another” (Goodwin 2001:19-20). Goodwin believes that both of these theories, although not completely wrong, fail to completely analyze the political concept in which they are made. In addition to that there is a lot of disagreement in these theories that makes them less reliable.\n\nThe State-Centered Perspective\nWhen studying revolutions, Goodwin places the focus on states, also known as the state-centered perspective. He focuses on the state because of two main reasons. The first is that any successful revolution will cause the breakdown or incapacitation of the state. The second reason is that “strong revolutionary movements, even if they ultimately fail to seize state power, will emerge only in opposition to states that are configured and that act in certain ways” (Goodwin 2001: 25) There are two reasons why the development of revolutionary movements is dependent on the state. Primarily, people will not support revolutionary movements unless they feel that the state is at fault for their everyday problems. The second reason is that individuals will not join revolutionary movements if they feel that doing so will only lead to more violence from the state. This second reason introduces another idea of people not joining revolutions unless they feel they have no other way out, which is exactly the title of the book. \n\nFour Types of State- Centered Analysis\n\nAnalytic Strengths of State-Centered Approaches to Revolution \n\nCritiques and Limitations of State-Centered Approaches \n\nThe Case of The Cuban Revolution \nThe Cuban Revolution is a clear example that not only shows the strengths of the \nstate-centered perspective, it also shows its limitations. Goodwin explains how in Cuba there were two main reasons as to why Cuba was susceptible to a radical revolution. The first reason was the weakness of Cuba’s clases economicas and the second was its strength of it clases populares or popular sectors. The Cuban state was also characterized by its “mediated sovereignty” and a “near-chronic crisis of political authority” (Goodwin 2001:60). Although the state had a lot to do in the Cuban revolution, this event was also marked by the mobilization of the masses. This is one of the reasons why the state-centered perspective is limited; it fails to analyze certain aspects of the revolution that were very important. On the other hand Goodwin argues that the Cuban revolution needs to be analyzed in different forms in order to fully explain it since no one theory alone can fully analyze any revolution.\n\nThe Formation of Revolutionary Movements in Southeast Asia\n\nThe Only Domino: The Vietnamese Revolution in Comparative Perspective\n\nConclusion \n"}

It is held in a road course between the towns of Portstewart, Coleraine and Portrush in Causeway Coast and Glens. The course, known as \"the Triangle\", is one of the fastest in the world, with average speeds of and top speeds in excess of .\n\nThe North West 200 is one of around fifteen events run on public roads between April and October throughout Northern Ireland. It is the largest annual sporting event in Northern Ireland, with the race weekend attracting over 150,000 visitors from all over the world.\n\nOriginally intended to be held somewhere in the north west of Ireland and organised by the City of Derry & District Motor Club, the initial event was moved to the north coast but the name was never changed. Since 1964 the event has been organised by the Coleraine and District Motor Club. In 2010, the meeting featured daytime practice on the Thursday for the first time.\n\nThe 2011 event took place on Saturday 21 May. There were significant delays due to a hoax bomb alert and then an extensive oil spill on the track caused racing to be cancelled after the completion of only one race.\n\nThe North West 200 was originally run over two hundred miles as a handicap race, before changing to its current format of several separate races, each running 4–6 laps during Saturday afternoon. Practice is held on the Tuesday and Thursday evenings before the race. Both the practice and races are held on closed roads, but unlike the Isle of Man TT races which are run in a time-trial format, all riders compete together as with normal circuit racing.\n\nOver the years the number and the classes of races has varied according to the latest regulations. From 1990 until 2010, there was always a 125 cc race and since 1992 the \"North West 200\" race has been for Superbikes.\n\nFrom 2012, all practice sessions will take place during the day, and the racing programme has been extended to include two races on the Thursday evening. All races will be held over six laps, except for the newly introduced Supertwin event.\n\nThe street circuit is made up almost entirely of public roads (A2, B185 & A29) but does include three speed reducing chicanes. The route, running anti-clockwise enters the outskirts of the towns passing many private houses. To help improve track safety street signs are removed at parts of the track and bales of hay are used to wrap the base of lampposts and telegraph poles.\n\nThe circuit is long, with a distance of being covered on the first lap of every race. The original start/finish line was located near Magherabouy but moved to the Portmore Road in Portstewart in 1930. The elevation ranges from above sea level.\n1973 saw the first major changes to the course, which include the exclusion of the Promenade at Portstewart from the route and the moving of the start/finish line to its current location between Juniper Hill and Millbank Avenue. These changes meant the route used Station Road (B185) for the first time and saw the introduction of York Corner. Shell Hill Bridge, an iconic part of the original course was used for the last time in 1979. In 1980, a new link road, from University Corner to Ballysally Roundabout, was introduced. A chicane was introduced just before the approach to the Juniper Hill corner in 1983 and in 1988 improvements were made to Mather's Cross and the start/finish chicane was introduced to reduce the speeds around Primrose Hill as well as allowing safer access to the pitlane.\n\nAt the end of 2009 Mather's Cross was widened in order improve safety at the corner. For 2010 additional modifications were made to the circuit to improve safety. A new purpose built chicane at Mather's Cross was introduced to reduce speeds at the corner and safety improvements made to the area at Station corner.\n\nJack Brett recorded the first lap of the course on a Norton 500cc in 1957. The current course lap record is held by Steve Plater at which was set during the 2006 event. The fastest recorded lap at was set by Tom Herron during the 1978 North West 200 race.\n\nIn 2004, Michael Rutter became the first rider to record a top speed in excess of on the course. During Tuesday's practice at the 2012 event Martin Jessopp set a new fastest speed trap time, reaching on the approach to University Corner.\n\nThe first recorded death at the event was Norman Wainwright who was killed in 1939.\n\n\"Black Saturday\" as it is known, is regarded as the darkest day in the event's history after crashes claimed the lives of three riders, Tom Herron, Brian Hamilton and Frank Kennedy who died months later from his injuries.\n\nRobert Dunlop was killed on 15 May 2008 while practising in the 250cc class. The incident occurred as he was approaching Mather's Cross during the 125/250/400cc practice session. It is understood his bike seized and Robert was thrown over his handlebars at approximately . Fellow rider Darren Burns was following immediately behind and collided with Robert, suffering a broken leg and suspected concussion. Robert suffered severe chest injuries and died in hospital shortly afterwards.\n\nTwenty-two-year-old Mark Young died during the 2009 event on 17 May 2009. It was Young's first race at the North West 200 although he had road racing experience.\n\nThirty-five-year-old Mark Buckley suffered a fatal crash on Millbank Avenue outside Portstewart during the Superstock race on 19 May 2012. He was taken to hospital but later died from his injuries, no other competitors were involved with this incident.\n\nAndrews was airlifted to a hospital in Northern Ireland in critical condition after suffering a serious crash while competing in the North West 200 on Saturday, 17 May 2014. Andrews came off his bike and slid down the asphalt until he collided head-first with a section of raised concrete pavement while curbing at high speed in Portrush, County Antrim. After receiving immediate medical intervention from the race doctors and medics, Andrews was airlifted to the Royal Victoria Hospital in Belfast in a critical condition after suffering the high-speed accident on the approach to Metropole corner. Andrews was competing in the second Superstock race of the event aboard his BMW. He died in hospital on 19 May 2014 as a result of his injuries, aged 31.\n\nMalachi Mitchell-Thomas died as a result of a crash on the third lap of the Supertwins race at the Vauxhall International North West 200 on 14 May 2016.\nThe 20-year-old from Chorley in Lancashire crashed his Burrows Engineering Kawasaki on the approach to Black Hill. The race was immediately red flagged and Malachi was treated by medical staff from the MCUI Medical team but succumbed to his injuries at the scene. No other riders were involved in the incident.\nRacing was subsequently abandoned.\n\nAlastair Seeley from Northern Ireland, holds the record number of 24 wins. Robert Dunlop was the previous record holder with 15 wins. Michael Rutter won fourteen races. Joey Dunlop (Robert's brother) won thirteen races. Michael Dunlop and William Dunlop (both sons of Robert) have also won races at the North West 200.\n\nThe early years of the event was dominated by British motorcycle manufacturers, in particular Norton. It was only in 1964 that Honda claimed their first victory. 2010 saw BMW score their first victory at the event and also the first non-Japanese manufacturer to claim a victory since 1997. Yamaha is the only manufacturer to have a clean sweep, winning all five races in 1979. \n\nThe event is currently covered by BBC Northern Ireland having previously been covered by UTV. Some races can be accessed live nationwide via the BBC Red Button and all races are live on the BBC Website. BBC NI also show highlights programmes presented by Stephen Watson, usually on the Sunday and Monday nights after the event. BBC Commentators include BBC MotoGP commentator Steve Parrish and 5 times winner on a single day Phillip McCallen.\n\nThe North West 200 features in Jester Interactive's PlayStation 2 title \"TT Superbikes: Real Road Racing Championship\" released at the end of May 2008. It is the sequel to their top 10 game \"TT Superbikes\" released in 2005. It is also featured in Milestone S.r.l.'s Ride 2 for PlayStation 4, Xbox One and PC.\n\n\n"}

More generally the term is applicable to other artificial neural networks in which a memristor or other electrically adjustable resistance material is used to emulate a neural synapse.\n\nIn the 1960s Bernard Widrow and Ted Hoff developed ADALINE (Adaptive Linear Neuron) which used electrochemical cells called memistors (memory resistors) to emulate synapses of an artificial neuron. The memistors were implemented as 3-terminal devices operating based on the reversible electroplating of copper such that the resistance between two of the terminals is controlled by the integral of the current applied via the third terminal. The ADALINE circuitry was briefly commercialized by the Memistor Corporation in the 1960s enabling some applications in pattern recognition. However, since the memistors were not fabricated using integrated circuit fabrication techniques the technology was not scalable and was eventually abandoned as solid state electronics became mature.\n\nAlex Nugent describes a physical neural network as one or more nonlinear neuron-like nodes used to sum signals and nanoconnections formed from nanoparticles, nanowires, or nanotubes which determine the signal strength input to the nodes. Alignment or self-assembly of the nanoconnections is determined by the history of the applied electric field performing a function analogous to neural synapses. Numerous applications for such physical neural networks are possible. For example, a temporal summation device can be composed of one or more nanoconnections having an input and an output thereof, wherein an input signal provided to the input causes one or more of the nanoconnection to experience an increase in connection strength thereof over time. Another example of a physical neural network is taught by U.S. Patent No. 7,039,619 entitled \"Utilized nanotechnology apparatus using a neural network, a solution and a connection gap,\" which issued to Alex Nugent by the U.S. Patent & Trademark Office on May 2, 2006.\n\nA further application of physical neural network is shown in U.S. Patent No. 7,412,428 entitled \"Application of hebbian and anti-hebbian learning to nanotechnology-based physical neural networks,\" which issued on August 12, 2008.\n\nNugent and Molter have shown that universal computing and general-purpose machine learning are possible from operations available through simple memristive circuits operating the AHaH plasticity rule.\nMore recently, it has been argued that complex purely memristive circuits can serve as neural networks.\n\nIn 2002, Stanford Ovshinsky described an analog neural computing medium in which phase change material has the ability to cumulatively respond to multiple input signals. An electrical alteration of the resistance of the phase change material is used to control the weighting of the input signals.\n\nGreg Snider of HP Labs describes a system of cortical computing with memristive nanodevices. The memristors (memory resistors) are implemented by thin film materials in which the resistance is electrically tuned via the transport of ions or oxygen vacancies within the film. DARPA's SyNAPSE project has funded IBM Research and HP Labs, in collaboration with the Boston University Department of Cognitive and Neural Systems (CNS), to develop neuromorphic architectures which may be based on memristive systems.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1154853", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1154853", "title": "Pyrosequencing", "text": "Pyrosequencing\n\nPyrosequencing is a method of DNA sequencing (determining the order of nucleotides in DNA) based on the \"sequencing by synthesis\" principle, in which the sequencing is performed by detecting the nucleotide incorporated by a DNA polymerase. Pyrosequencing relies on light detection based on a chain reaction when pyrophosphate is released. Hence, the name pyrosequencing.\n\nThe principle of Pyrosequencing was first described in 1993 by Bertil Pettersson, Mathias Uhlen and Pål Nyren by combining the solid phase sequencing method using streptavidin coated magnetic beads with recombinant DNA polymerase lacking 3´to 5´exonuclease activity (proof-reading) and luminescence detection using the firefly luciferase enzyme. A mixture of three enzymes (DNA polymerase, ATP sulfurylase and firefly luciferase) and a nucleotide (dNTP) are added to single stranded DNA to be sequenced and the incorporation of nucleotide is followed by measuring the light emitted. The intensity of the light determines if 0, 1 or more nucleotides have been incorporated, thus showing how many complementary nucleotides are present on the template strand. The nucleotide mixture is removed before the next nucleotide mixture is added. This process is repeated with each of the four nucleotides until the DNA sequence of the single stranded template is determined.\n\nA second solution-based method for Pyrosequencing was described in 1998 by Mostafa Ronaghi, Mathias Uhlen and Pål Nyren. In this alternative method, an additional enzyme apyrase is introduced to remove nucleotides that are not incorporated by the DNA polymerase. This enabled the enzyme mixture including the DNA polymerase, the luciferase and the apyrase to be added at the start and kept throughout the procedure, thus providing a simple set-up suitable for automation. An automated instrument based on this principle was introduced to the market the following year by the company Pyrosequencing.\n\nA third microfluidic variant of the Pyrosequencing method was described in 2005 by Jonathan Rothberg and co-workers at the company 454 Life Sciences. This alternative approach for Pyrosequencing was based on the original principle of attaching the DNA to be sequenced to a solid support and they showed that sequencing could be performed in a highly parallel manner using a microfabricated microarray. This allowed for high-throughput DNA sequencing and an automated instrument was introduced to the market. This became the first next generation sequencing instrument starting a new era in genomics research, with rapidly falling prices for DNA sequencing allowing whole genome sequencing at affordable prices.\n\n\"Sequencing by synthesis\" involves taking a single strand of the DNA to be sequenced and then synthesizing its complementary strand enzymatically. The pyrosequencing method is based on detecting the activity of DNA polymerase (a DNA synthesizing enzyme) with another chemoluminescent enzyme. Essentially, the method allows sequencing a single strand of DNA by synthesizing the complementary strand along it, one base pair at a time, and detecting which base was actually added at each step. The template DNA is immobile, and solutions of A, C, G, and T nucleotides are sequentially added and removed from the reaction. Light is produced only when the nucleotide solution complements the first unpaired base of the template. The sequence of solutions which produce chemiluminescent signals allows the determination of the sequence of the template.\n\nFor the solution-based version of Pyrosequencing, the single-strand DNA (ssDNA) template is hybridized to a sequencing primer and incubated with the enzymes DNA polymerase, ATP sulfurylase, luciferase and apyrase, and with the substrates adenosine 5´ phosphosulfate (APS) and luciferin.\n\nCurrently, a limitation of the method is that the lengths of individual reads of DNA sequence are in the neighborhood of 300-500 nucleotides, shorter than the 800-1000 obtainable with chain termination methods (e.g. Sanger sequencing). This can make the process of genome assembly more difficult, particularly for sequences containing a large amount of repetitive DNA. Lack of proof-reading activity limits accuracy of this method.\n\nThe company Pyrosequencing AB in Uppsala, Sweden was founded with venture capital provided by HealthCap in order to commercialize machinery and reagents for sequencing short stretches of DNA using the pyrosequencing technique. Pyrosequencing AB was listed on the Stockholm Stock Exchange in 1999. It was renamed to Biotage in 2003. The pyrosequencing business line was acquired by Qiagen in 2008. Pyrosequencing technology was further licensed to 454 Life Sciences. 454 developed an array-based pyrosequencing technology which emerged as a platform for large-scale DNA sequencing, including genome sequencing and metagenomics.\n\nRoche announced the discontinuation of the 454 sequencing platform in 2013 when its technology became noncompetitive.\n"}

He was educated at Westminster School, London and later served in the American Revolutionary War. He acted as \"aide-de-camp\" to successive lord lieutenants of Ireland from 1784 onwards.\n\nBuckinghamshire was a Member of Parliament (MP) in the Irish House of Commons for Portarlington from 1784 to 1790 and thereafter for Armagh Borough from 1790 to 1797. He sat also in the British House of Commons for the rotten borough of Bramber in 1788, a seat he held until 1790, and then for Lincoln from 1790 to 1796. In 1793 he was invested a member of the Privy Council, and appointed Governor of Madras. In 1798 he was recalled to England by the President of the Board of Control responsible for Indian affairs, Henry Dundas and summoned to the House of Lords through a writ of acceleration in his father’s junior title of Baron Hobart.

The electron can always be theoretically considered as a bound state of the three, with the spinon carrying the spin of the electron, the orbiton carrying the orbital location and the holon carrying the charge, but in certain conditions they can become deconfined and behave as independent particles.\n\nThe term spinon is frequently used in discussions of experimental facts within the framework of both quantum spin liquid and strongly correlated quantum spin liquid.\n\nElectrons, being of like charge, repel each other. As a result, in order to move past each other in an extremely crowded environment, they are forced to modify their behavior. Research published in July 2009 by the University of Cambridge and the University of Birmingham in England showed that electrons could jump from the surface of the metal onto a closely located quantum wire by quantum tunneling, and upon doing so, will separate into two quasiparticles, named spinons and holons by the researchers.\n\nThe orbiton was predicted theoretically by van den Brink, Khomskii and Sawatzky in 1997-1998.\nIts experimental observation as a separate quasiparticle was reported in paper sent to publishers in September 2011.\nThe research states that by firing a beam of X-ray photons at a single electron in a one-dimensional sample of strontium cuprate, this will excite the electron to a higher orbital, causing the beam to lose a fraction of its energy in the process. In doing so, the electron will be separated into a spinon and an orbiton. This can be traced by observing the energy and momentum of the X-rays before and after the collision.\n\n"}

Although he died young, he was one of the pioneers of the Romantic movement.\n\nBorn in Rouen, France, Géricault was educated in the tradition of English sporting art by Carle Vernet and classical figure composition by Pierre-Narcisse Guérin, a rigorous classicist who disapproved of his student's impulsive temperament while recognizing his talent. Géricault soon left the classroom, choosing to study at the Louvre, where from 1810 to 1815 he copied paintings by Rubens, Titian, Velázquez and Rembrandt. \n\nDuring this period at the Louvre he discovered a vitality he found lacking in the prevailing school of Neoclassicism. Much of his time was spent in Versailles, where he found the stables of the palace open to him, and where he gained his knowledge of the anatomy and action of horses.\n\nGéricault's first major work, \"The Charging Chasseur\", exhibited at the Paris Salon of 1812, revealed the influence of the style of Rubens and an interest in the depiction of contemporary subject matter. This youthful success, ambitious and monumental, was followed by a change in direction: for the next several years Géricault produced a series of small studies of horses and cavalrymen. \n\nHe exhibited \"Wounded Cuirassier\" at the Salon in 1814, a work more labored and less well received. Géricault in a fit of disappointment entered the army and served for a time in the garrison of Versailles. In the nearly two years that followed the 1814 Salon, he also underwent a self-imposed study of figure construction and composition, all the while evidencing a personal predilection for drama and expressive force.\n\nA trip to Florence, Rome, and Naples (1816–17), prompted in part by the desire to flee from a romantic entanglement with his aunt, ignited a fascination with Michelangelo. Rome itself inspired the preparation of a monumental canvas, the \"Race of the Barberi Horses\", a work of epic composition and abstracted theme that promised to be \"entirely without parallel in its time\". However, Géricault never completed the painting and returned to France. In 1821, he painted \"The Derby of Epsom\".\n\nGéricault continually returned to the military themes of his early paintings, and the series of lithographs he undertook on military subjects after his return from Italy are considered some of the earliest masterworks in that medium. Perhaps his most significant, and certainly most ambitious work, is \"The Raft of the Medusa\" (1818–19), which depicted the aftermath of a contemporary French shipwreck, \"Meduse\", in which the captain had left the crew and passengers to die. \n\nThe incident became a national scandal, and Géricault's dramatic interpretation presented a contemporary tragedy on a monumental scale. The painting's notoriety stemmed from its indictment of a corrupt establishment, but it also dramatized a more eternal theme, that of man's struggle with nature. It surely excited the imagination of the young Eugène Delacroix, who posed for one of the dying figures.\n\nThe classical depiction of the figures and structure of the composition stand in contrast to the turbulence of the subject, so that the painting constitutes an important bridge between neo-classicism and romanticism. It fuses many influences: the \"Last Judgment\" of Michelangelo, the monumental approach to contemporary events by Antoine-Jean Gros, figure groupings by Henry Fuseli, and possibly the painting \"Watson and the Shark \"by John Singleton Copley.\n\nThe painting ignited political controversy when first exhibited at the Paris Salon of 1819; it then traveled to England in 1820, accompanied by Géricault himself, where it received much praise. While in London, Géricault witnessed urban poverty, made drawings of his impressions, and published lithographs based on these observations which were free of sentimentality. He associated much there with Charlet, the lithographer and caricaturist.\n\nAfter his return to France in 1821, Géricault was inspired to paint a series of ten portraits of the insane, the patients of a friend, Dr. Étienne-Jean Georget, a pioneer in psychiatric medicine, with each subject exhibiting a different affliction. There are five remaining portraits from the series, including \"Insane Woman\". \n\nThe paintings are noteworthy for their bravura style, expressive realism, and for their documenting of the psychological discomfort of individuals, made all the more poignant by the history of insanity in Géricault's family, as well as the artist's own fragile mental health. His observations of the human subject were not confined to the living, for some remarkable still-lifes—painted studies of severed heads and limbs—have also been ascribed to the artist.\n\nGéricault's last efforts were directed toward preliminary studies for several epic compositions, including the \"Opening of the Doors of the Spanish Inquisition\" and the \"African Slave Trade\". The preparatory drawings suggest works of great ambition, but Géricault's waning health intervened. Weakened by riding accidents and chronic tubercular infection, Géricault died in Paris in 1824 after a long period of suffering. His bronze figure reclines, brush in hand, on his tomb at Père Lachaise Cemetery in Paris, above a low-relief panel of \" The Raft of the Medusa\".\n\n\n\n"}

The story was drawn by Frank Hampson.\n\nThe Treens are a race of green-skinned humanoids from the northern hemisphere of the planet Venus. The southern hemisphere is inhabited by the Therons, a human-like race with an obvious affinity to humanity on Earth. The Treens share the northern hemisphere with the \"Atlantines\", a blue-skinned people whose ancestors came from Earth 100,000 years previously. The two hemispheres are separated by the \"flamelands\" around the equator which are impassable, except by specially equipped aircraft.\n\nThe leader of the Treens is the Mekon, an individual specifically engineered to have a high intelligence. The Treens are portrayed as mostly unemotional without the usual human feelings about the sanctity of life. In ancient times, they lived as savage jungle tribes permanently involved in tribal wars amongst themselves, until in a major war the Therons occupied the northern hemisphere by force in an attempt to civilize the Treens. The attempt failed and the Therons later abandoned the Treens to their own devices.\n\nSoon after, Treen scientists created the first \"Mekon\" as a \"super-brain\" to rule over the Treen race. The Mekon developed Treen society into a highly organized militaristic logic-based society where orders are obeyed without query, and which is usually in a state of hostility with the Therons and Earth, both of whose lands they have on occasion occupied. Their capital city is called Mekonta and is on islands in a lake. The Atlantines are usually ignored by the Treens, and live in primitive conditions.\nMekonta is the capital city of the Treens in the Dan Dare stories. It is named after The Mekon. It is built on many islands in a lake. Its design may have been inspired by Venice and/or Tenochtitlan. It was ruined in the war in \"\", and New Mekonta was built nearby. Afterwards for a long time Old Mekonta remained uncleared ruins.\nThe Magnets of Mekonta are huge electromagnets on mountaintops around Mekonta. They are used to raise and lower spaceships in and out of Mekonta.\n\nCreator Frank Hampson stated \"Basically we were fighting the Second World War again – the Treens were the Nazis\".\n\n\n"}

It stars Cameron Diaz, Jon Favreau, Daniel Stern, Jeremy Piven, Christian Slater, Leland Orser and Jeanne Tripplehorn.\n\nBefore his wedding to fiancée Laura (Cameron Diaz), Kyle Fisher (Jon Favreau) organizes a bachelor party in a Las Vegas hotel with his friends: Charles Moore (Leland Orser), Robert Boyd (Christian Slater), brothers Adam and Michael Berkow (Daniel Stern and Jeremy Piven). Michael pays Tina (Kobe Tai), a stripper/prostitute, for sex in the bathroom and accidentally kills her. Soon thereafter, a security guard comes to investigate the ruckus and discovers Tina's corpse. In desperation, Boyd stabs the guard to death. Boyd convinces the group to dismember the bodies, bury them in the desert, and never speak of it again. \n\nAt the rehearsal dinner, Adam cracks under the pressure, leading to a confrontation with Michael outside, with Adam threatening to turn over to the police. The fight is broken up and Michael is convinced to leave. While leaving, he tries to ram his jeep into Adam's beloved minivan. Adam runs in front of his van and is crushed in the collision. In the hospital, Adam whispers something to his wife Lois (Jeanne Tripplehorn) before dying, as Boyd looks on through a glass window.\n\nLois demands answers about what happened in Las Vegas when she finds a written confession by Adam. Fisher makes up a story about Adam sleeping with a prostitute. Boyd, suspecting she does not believe them, kills Lois. Later, Boyd calls Fisher and Moore to bring Michael to the house, where he kills him. He concocts a story about a Michael/Lois/Adam love triangle to answer any interrogation by police. After these events and being named beneficiary of Adam and Lois' estate, Fisher breaks down and confesses the story to Laura, who demands that the wedding she has dreamed about proceed as planned.\n\nOn the wedding day, Boyd confronts Fisher, demanding the money from Adam's life insurance policy. Fisher refuses and a fight ensues which ends with Laura bludgeoning Boyd. During the ceremony, Fisher and Moore realize that Boyd has the wedding rings. Moore goes to retrieve them, opening a door that knocks Boyd down a stairwell where he dies. Laura demands Fisher bury Boyd's body in the desert and then ensure no loose ends remain by killing Moore. Ultimately, Fisher cannot go through with the act and as he drives home, he loses focus and crashes into an oncoming car.\n\nAfter the collision, Fisher has had both his legs amputated below the knee and Moore is brain damaged and confined to a motorized wheelchair, leaving Laura to care for all of them in addition to raising Adam's sons. As Laura watches Fisher's futile attempt to control the two boys, she realizes her life and dreams are totally ruined and suffers a nervous breakdown as she runs out of the house and collapses screaming in the street.\n\n\nThe film scored a 44% on Rotten Tomatoes, with the consensus, \"Mean-spirited and empty\". Roger Ebert wrote that \"Very Bad Things\" is \"not a bad movie, just a reprehensible one\". Some critics appreciated the cold-blooded approach, however, Maitland McDonagh of \"TV Guide\" said, \"In a world filled with crude movie sitcoms, Berg's bitter, worst-possible-case scenario really does stand alone\".\n\n"}

It was a long and unfinished project, sometimes identified with Schelling's philosophical output from 1809 to 1827, the period beginning with his \"Freiheitsschrift\".\n\nDespite Schelling's years of work on the project, no definitive version of the \"Weltalter\" emerged. There were three drafts in a series: the later versions were not complete and are often referred to as fragments. A work \"System der Weltalter\" from 1827/8 consists of Munich lecture notes taken by Ernst von Lasaulx from Schelling, who was at that time a student also of Franz von Baader and Joseph Görres.\n\nThe manuscripts, which no longer exist, are assigned to the periods 1811, 1813 and 1814/5. The 1814/5 manuscript was published posthumously; copies of the other two manuscripts, made by Manfred Schröter before the destruction of the originals by bombing in World War II, were published in 1946, with some of Schelling's project notes.\n\nSchelling works in the \"Weltalter\" with and from a theological idea of creation. He is influenced by the formulations of Jakob Boehme, and in general the Bible. Taken as a Romantic theory of the \"anima mundi\", the \"Weltalter\" writings call on, at least superficially, mysticism (both Jewish and Christian) and natural philosophy.\n\nAside from the language used, there are a number of formulations explaining the problems Schelling was tackling in the \"Weltalter\" project. According to a 2010 paper,\n\nWhen Schelling sat down to write the \"Ages of the World\" he had a large number of seemingly contradictory philosophical commitments to reconcile. He wanted to avoid dualism and yet acknowledge the essential and irreducible roles of both spirit and matter. He wanted to give a law-like description of the creation of the world and yet preserve divine freedom. He wanted to treat God as perfect and self-sufficient and yet also account for the motive underlying God's decision to create the world. Perhaps most paradoxically of all, he wanted to explain what events led up to the creation of the past – what ‘caused’ time.\n\nThe 1813 draft has been called the origin of dialectical materialism. Slavoj Žižek in explaining his attitude to the \"Weltalter\" and its theosophical leanings, however, states that \"there is no way of throwing out the dirty bath water without losing the baby\".\n"}

Together they had two daughters and one son.\n\nPrior to moving to Calgary, Orr spent his life in various occupations. These include: cattle-dealer, salesman, teacher, and coroner. He also contributed to newspapers such as the Northern Gazette (Barrie, Ontario) and the Hamilton Spectator.\n\nIn 1883, Orr was advised by D'Alton McCarthy to buy land at Fort Calgary prior to the arrival of the Canadian Pacific Railway. That year he purchased land south of the Bow River and east of the Elbow River with an associate, Mary S. Schreiber, for $10,000. This was nearly his entire fortune, as he was confident in getting a significant return. Due to complications, Orr settled in Calgary in 1886 to protect his investment. The railway station was not located near his property as expected and his involvement with local politics was to promote development near or on his property. Although his wife refused to follow, he took along his seven-year-old son.\n\nAs with his time in the east, Orr spent time in various work opportunities. He thought the road to prosperity came through the railway and was involved in the Canadian Pacific Railway, Alberta Southern Railway Company, Rocky Mountain Railway, Coal Company, North-West Central Railway and a proposed line between Calgary and Hudson Bay. He was also involved in real estate, buffalo bone trading, operated a stone quarry, and was a financial agent. In 1888, he served as the editor of the Calgary Herald.\n\nOrr was also active in municipal politics. Excluding one year, he served as alderman from 1888 through 1894. He chaired the committee of public works which was responsible for the creation of much of the early infrastructure in Calgary, including: electric light, the General Hospital, sewage, municipal financing and water. In 1894, he became Calgary's eighth mayor and served for two one-year terms. Calgary was elevated to a city during November of his first term. With this, Orr became the first mayor of the city of Calgary. After a narrow defeat in 1896, he again took on the post as mayor in 1897 for another one-year term. He personally drew the city crest with its motto \"Onward Calgary.\"\n\nOrr died on February 16, 1898 in the Calgary General Hospital. In 1961, a stained glass window in St. Stephen's Anglican Church was dedicated to his memory.\n\n"}

On 30 July 2015, during the 2015 Jerusalem gay pride, he stabbed 16-year-old Shira Banki to death, and wounded six other people. The incident occurred just three weeks after his release from prison. On 24 August, Schlissel was indicted for murder, six counts of attempted murder, and wounding under aggravating circumstances, and detained until the end of proceedings. On June 26 2016, he was sentenced to life plus 31 years in prison, as well as pay NIS 2,064,000 (around $650,000) in damages. \n\nSchlissel was born on 10 December 1975 in Yad Binyamin. He was the eldest of ten children. His parents are the children of Holocaust survivors. He studied Talmud, and is very religious. He later studied in a kolel in Jerusalem.\n\nIn 2005, Schlissel stabbed three marchers during the gay pride parade in Jerusalem. As a result, he was convicted of attempted murder and aggravated assault, and sentenced to twelve years in prison. In 2007, his sentence was reduced to ten years on appeal. Schlissel served his sentence at Maasiyahu Prison. In 2008, he was hospitalized for a month and a half over mental health issues and diagnosed with a paranoid psychiatric condition. Schlissel was released in June 2015.\n\nShortly after his release, he distributed a homophobic letter in his hometown which read, \"It is the obligation of every Jew to keep his soul from punishment and stop this giant desecration of God's name next Thursday.\" He was not tracked by the Judea and Samaria Police District because his previous crime had occurred in Jerusalem, outside of their jurisdiction. Moreover, Moshe Edry, the chief of the Jerusalem District Police, was not warned that Schlissel would be coming to Jerusalem.\n\nOn 30 July 2015, only three weeks after being released, he stabbed six marchers during the Jerusalem gay pride parade. The act was widely condemned, including by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. One of the victims, 16-year-old Shira Banki, died of her wounds at the Hadassah Medical Center three days later, on 2 August 2015. Shortly after, Prime Minister Netanyahu offered his condolences, adding \"We will deal with the murderer to the fullest extent of the law.\"\n\nA psychiatric evaluation by the Israel Prison Service, with which Schlissel refused to cooperate, found him fit to stand trial. However, after state psychiatrists argued that his refusal to cooperate rendered the evaluation inconclusive, the court ordered that he be hospitalized for a 48-hour observation period for reevaluation. He was again found fit to stand trial. On 24 August 2015, Shlissel was charged with one count of murder and six counts of attempted murder and aggravated assault at the Jerusalem District Court. He refused to recognize the authority of the court to try him due to it not abiding by Jewish religious law. He announced that he would refuse to be represented by an attorney, and did not cooperate with the public defender assigned to represent him. On April 19, 2016, he was convicted. On June 26, 2016, he was sentenced to life plus 31 years in prison, and was ordered to pay NIS 2,064,000 in compensation to the families of his victims. \n\nSchlissel is serving his sentence in Ayalon Prison. In August 2016, Schlissel tore up pictures of another inmate's daughters due to them being \"immodestly dressed\", and was subsequently beaten by the inmate until guards separated them. Schlissel was hospitalized as a result of the beating he sustained, and was temporarily placed in solitary confinement as a disciplinary measure. After prison authorities carried out an evaluation, it was decided to separate him from other inmates due to his volatile behavior, and he was given his own cell in a protected area of the prison. One month later, Schlissel was again attacked and had to be hospitalized after an argument between him and two convicted mobsters in the prison yard escalated to the mobsters beating him until guards intervened.\n\nBefore his prison sentence, Schlissel resided in Modi'in Illit, a Haredi Israeli settlement and city in the West Bank. He is an Israeli ultra-Orthodox Jew. Prior to his crime, he was married, with four children. He divorced his wife at the beginning of his imprisonment in 2005.\n"}
