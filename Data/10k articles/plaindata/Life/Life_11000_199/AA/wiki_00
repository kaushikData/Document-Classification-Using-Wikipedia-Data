Ronald Walton (1943 – September 5, 1996) was professor of Chinese language and linguistics at the University of Maryland, who was regarded as an expert in language pedagogy, policy, and planning. He was known for his promotion of the teaching of foreign languages and was the Deputy Director of the National Foreign Language Center in Washington, D.C. from its inception in 1987 until his death.\n\nWalton graduated from the University of Texas in 1967 with a bachelor's degree in general linguistics, before proceeding to complete an M.A. and Ph.D. at Cornell University in general and Chinese linguistics. He then commenced his academic career by teaching Chinese language and linguistics, specializing in research into Chinese dialectology and phonology. Walton was the Deputy Director and Acting Director of Cornell’s intensive Chinese language program from 1972 to 1975, before transferring to the State University of New York at Albany, the University of Pennsylvania, and in 1983, to the University of Maryland, where he stayed for the rest of his life. Walton remained a core member of the University of Maryland faculty despite his wide responsibilities in various organizations. He was instrumental in creating the Language Center and was its Director from 1991 to 1993. In the Department of Asian and East European Languages and Cultures, he devoted a substantial amount of time to shaping the language curriculum, and to formulating M.A. programs for training language teachers who could understand and attend to the needs of the future. Walton compiled two monographs on Chinese phonology: \"Phonological Redundancy in Shanghai\" (1976) and \"Tone, Segment and Syllable in Chinese: A Polydimensional Approach to Surface Phonetic Structure\" (1983); both appeared as part of the Cornell East Asia Papers Series.\n\nIn the first part of the 1980s, Walton's professional interests changed direction. He penned a self-study guide to accompany a widely used Japanese language text, before coauthoring a three-volume text, \"A Course in Business Chinese\". Following his completion of the books, he began work as a consultant and reviewer of language curricula and programs, in Chinese and other languages as well. It was in this field that he quickly established a reputation as one of the best in the business.\n\nIn 1987, Walton was one of the main forces behind the creation of the National Foreign Language Center in Washington, D.C.. He was the inaugural Deputy Director, serving in the role until his death. It was in this role that Walton left his deepest imprint on national language policy and standards in the field of foreign language education. Working with ACTFL, the US Department of Education, the College Board, among other organizations, Walton helped to formulate nationwide standards for Japanese, French, Hebrew German, Spanish Chinese and Korean.\n\nAs a co-Director of the \"National Council of Organizations of Less Commonly Taught Languages\" (NCOLCTL), Walton a key figure in creating national teachers’ organizations for African, Southeast and South Asian languages, and Korean. Walton penned ten articles and two monographs on language assessment, policy, and standards; lecturing about these topics on a regular basis. Walton was the main investigator or co-investigator, for more than fifteen major grants shaping a new vision for language in the United States. Despite this, Walton retained his lifelong commitment to his first interest, Chinese language education; at the time of his death he was contracted to Yale University to develop a new textbook in basic Chinese.\n\nHis mother, Lavera, raised Ron and his sister as a single mom in the late forties and fifties. He married his high school sweetheart, Karen. They were married for nine years and had a daughter, Kris. Walton died of acute coronary thrombosis on September 5, 1996, while visiting his mother in Austin, Texas, at the age of 53.\n"}

Belyavsky was also the first presenter of the popular TV Show \"The 13 Chairs Tavern\". In 1988 he was designated The Meritorious Artist of Russia; in 2003, he was named a People's Artist of Russia.\n\nAlexander Belyavsky was born in Moscow, to Boris Moiseyevich Belyavsky and his wife Lyubov Alexandrovna. He was the family's eldest child, with two younger siblings. After finishing school in 1949 he enrolled into the Geological research faculty of the Moscow's Gold and Non-ferrous metals Institute where he studied up until 1955, making frequent trips to the Central Asian Soviet republics for professional practice. After the graduation Belyavsky spent several years in Irkutsk, working for the East-Siberian Geological department. He made his debut as an actor at the Irkutsk Drama Theatre, playing Molchalin in Alexander Griboyedov's \"Woe from Wit\". Back in Moscow Belyavsky continued working as a geology engineer, occasionally taking part in amateur theatrical productions staged by The Teachers' House. He decided then to quit his regular job, enrolled into the Boris Shchukin Theatre Institute, and joined Vladimir Etush's class at the Vakhtangov Theatre. In summer 1957 Belyavsky made his debut on screen in \"Tales About Lenin\" (as a young worker Kolya). Three years later, still a student, he appeared in the Kiev Studio's film \"Save Our Souls\" (1960).\n\nIn 1961 Belyavsky graduated the Shchukin Theatre Institute with honors and was invited to join the Moscow Satire Theatre. In 1964 the Polish director Leonard Buczkowski cast him in the film \"Przerwany lot\" (Aborted Flight). While working in Warsaw Belyavsky learned the Polish language and later appeared in five more Polish films, including the popular TV wartime thriller series \"The Four Tankmen and a Dog\" (as a Soviet captain Pavlov). In 1964 he left the Satire Theatre but never severed ties with its troupe, having become the co-director (with Georgy Zelinsky) and the first presenter of the popular TV series \"13 Chairs Tavern\". It was Belyavsky who came up with the idea of staging a satirical TV series ridiculing a good-for-nothing 'firm' (apparently based in Poland), members of which meet at the tavern to discuss their (highly ridiculous) problems and perform Polish (later West European) pop songs in a karaoke-style.\n\nIn 1964 Belyavsky joined the Stanislavsky and Nemirovich-Danchenko Theatre, then moved in 1966 to the Theatre-Studio of a Cinema Actor. All in all he appeared in more than one hundred films (working in Poland, East Germany, North Korea, Finland, France, Chekhoslovakia, United States), one of his best-known roles being that of villainous Fox in Stanislav Govorukhin's \"The Meeting Place Cannot Be Changed\" (1979). In the 1990s Belyavsky hosted several TV shows; he played Leonid Brezhnev in Igor Gostev's \"Grey Wolves\" (1993). In 1999 he returned to the theatre and in 2003 was awarded the title of The People's Artist of Russia.\n\nIn December 2003, Alexander Belyavsky suffered a stroke which left him incapacitated. On September 8, 2012, he was found on the ground by the house where he lived, having fallen, apparently, from the staircase window between the 5th and the 6th floor of the house he lived in. The initial police reports implied it was suicide; later it was suggested the fall might have been accidental. Alexander Belyavsky was buried in Kuzminskoye Cemetery in Moscow.\n\nAlexander Belyavsky was married twice. In his first marriage, to Valentina Viktorovna he fathered a son, Boris (born on March 22, 1973, drowned aged two) and daughter Nadezhda (born in 1976). With his second wife Lyudmila Tikhonovna they had a daughter, Alexandra, born on August 28, 2003, just three months prior to his suffering a stroke.\n\n\n"}

But his mother Alexandra (63 BC – 28 BC), through intercession with Cleopatra and Mark Antony, compelled Herod to remove Ananelus from the office of High Priest and appoint Aristobulus instead.\n\nTo secure himself against danger from Aristobulus, Herod instituted a system of espionage against him and his mother. This surveillance proved so onerous that they sought to gain their freedom by taking refuge with Cleopatra. As told by the Roman Jewish historian Josephus, their plans were betrayed and the disclosure had the effect of greatly increasing Herod's suspicions against his brother-in-law.

The result is an \"encyclopedic dictionary\" that provides concepts and named entities lexicalized in many languages and connected with large amounts of semantic relations. Additional lexicalizations and definitions are added by linking to free-license wordnets, OmegaWiki, the English Wiktionary, Wikidata, FrameNet, VerbNet and others.

For each Babel synset, BabelNet provides short definitions (called glosses) in many languages harvested from both WordNet and Wikipedia.\n\n, BabelNet (version 4.0) covers 284 languages, including all European languages, most Asian languages, and Latin. BabelNet 4.0 contains almost 16 million synsets and about 833 million word senses (regardless of their language). Each Babel synset contains 2 synonyms per language, i.e., word senses, on average. The semantic network includes all the lexico-semantic relations from WordNet (hypernymy and hyponymy, meronymy and holonymy, antonymy and synonymy, etc., totaling around 364,000 relation edges) as well as an underspecified relatedness relation from Wikipedia (totaling around 1,3 bilion edges).

When a second rat was unable to choose the correct lever, the first rat noticed (not getting a second reward), and produced a round of task-related neuron firing that made the second rat more likely to choose the correct lever.\n\nIn 2013, Rajesh Rao was able to use electrical brain recordings and a form of magnetic stimulation to send a brain signal to Andrea Stocco on the other side of the University of Washington campus. In 2015, researchers linked up multiple brains, of both monkeys and rats, to form an “organic computer.\n\nIt is hypothesized that by using brain-to-brain interfaces (BTBIs) a biological computer, or brain-net, could be constructed using animal brains as its computational units. Initial exploratory work demonstrated collaboration between rats in distant cages linked by signals from cortical microelectrode arrays implanted in their brains. The rats were rewarded when actions were performed by the \"decoding rat\" which conformed to incoming signals and when signals were transmitted by the \"encoding rat\" which resulted in the desired action. In the initial experiment the rewarded action was pushing a lever in the remote location corresponding to the position of a lever near a lighted LED at the home location.

Instead, we have already proposed that, in theory, channel accuracy can be increased if instead of a dyad a whole grid of multiple reciprocally interconnected brains are employed. Such a computing structure could define the first example of an organic computer capable of solving heuristic problems that would be deemed non-computable by a general Turing-machine.

{"id": "6299994", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6299994", "title": "Cable theory", "text": "Cable theory\n\nClassical cable theory uses mathematical models to calculate the electric current (and accompanying voltage) along passive neurites, particularly the dendrites that receive synaptic inputs at different sites and times. Estimates are made by modeling dendrites and axons as cylinders composed of segments with capacitances formula_1 and resistances formula_2 combined in parallel (see Fig. 1). The capacitance of a neuronal fiber comes about because electrostatic forces are acting through the very thin lipid bilayer (see Figure 2). The resistance in series along the fiber formula_3 is due to the axoplasm's significant resistance to movement of electric charge.\n\nCable theory in computational neuroscience has roots leading back to the 1850s, when Professor William Thomson (later known as Lord Kelvin) began developing mathematical models of signal decay in submarine (underwater) telegraphic cables. The models resembled the partial differential equations used by Fourier to describe heat conduction in a wire.\n\nThe 1870s saw the first attempts by Hermann to model neuronal electrotonic potentials also by focusing on analogies with heat conduction. However, it was Hoorweg who first discovered the analogies with Kelvin's undersea cables in 1898 and then Hermann and Cremer who independently developed the cable theory for neuronal fibers in the early 20th century. Further mathematical theories of nerve fiber conduction based on cable theory were developed by Cole and Hodgkin (1920s–1930s), Offner et al. (1940), and Rushton (1951).\n\nExperimental evidence for the importance of cable theory in modelling the behavior of axons began surfacing in the 1930s from work done by Cole, Curtis, Hodgkin, Sir Bernard Katz, Rushton, Tasaki and others. Two key papers from this era are those of Davis and Lorente de Nó (1947) and Hodgkin and Rushton (1946).\n\nThe 1950s saw improvements in techniques for measuring the electric activity of individual neurons. Thus cable theory became important for analyzing data collected from intracellular microelectrode recordings and for analyzing the electrical properties of neuronal dendrites. Scientists like Coombs, Eccles, Fatt, Frank, Fuortes and others now relied heavily on cable theory to obtain functional insights of neurons and for guiding them in the design of new experiments.\n\nLater, cable theory with its mathematical derivatives allowed ever more sophisticated neuron models to be explored by workers such as Jack, Rall, Redman, Rinzel, Idan Segev, Tuckwell, Bell, and Iannella.\n\nNote, various conventions of \"r\" exist.\nHere \"r\" and \"c\", as introduced above, are measured per membrane-length unit (per meter (m)). Thus \"r\" is measured in ohm·meters (Ω·m) and \"c\" in farads per meter (F/m). This is in contrast to \"R\" (in Ω·m²) and \"C\" (in F/m²), which represent the specific resistance and capacitance respectively of one unit area of membrane (in m). Thus, if the radius, \"a\", of the axon is known, then its circumference is 2\"πa\", and its \"r\", and its \"c\" values can be calculated as:\n\nThese relationships make sense intuitively, because the greater the circumference of the axon, the greater the area for charge to escape through its membrane, and therefore the lower the membrane resistance (dividing \"R\" by 2\"πa\"); and the more membrane available to store charge (multiplying \"C\" by 2\"πa\").\nSimilarly, the specific resistance, \"R\", of the axoplasm allows one to calculate the longitudinal intracellular resistance per unit length, \"r\", (in Ω·m) by the equation:\nThe greater the cross sectional area of the axon, \"πa\"², the greater the number of paths for the charge to flow through its axoplasm, and the lower the axoplasmic resistance.\n\nSeveral important avenues of extending classical cable theory have recently seen the introduction of endogenous structures in order to analyze the effects of protein polarization within dendrites and different synaptic input distributions over the dendritic surface of a neuron.\n\nTo better understand how the cable equation is derived, first simplify the theoretical neuron even further and pretend it has a perfectly sealed membrane (\"r\"=∞) with no loss of current to the outside, and no capacitance (\"c\" = 0). A current injected into the fiber at position \"x\" = 0 would move along the inside of the fiber unchanged. Moving away from the point of injection and by using Ohm's law (\"V\" = \"IR\") we can calculate the voltage change as:\n\nLetting Δ\"x\" go towards zero and having infinitely small increments of \"x\", one can write () as:\n\nor\n\nBringing \"r\" back into the picture is like making holes in a garden hose. The more holes, the faster the water will escape from the hose, and the less water will travel all the way from the beginning of the hose to the end. Similarly, in an axon, some of the current traveling longitudinally through the axoplasm will escape through the membrane.\n\nIf \"i\" is the current escaping through the membrane per length unit, m, then the total current escaping along \"y\" units must be \"y·i\". Thus, the change of current in the axoplasm, Δ\"i\", at distance, Δ\"x\", from position \"x\"=0 can be written as:\n\nor, using continuous, infinitesimally small increments:\n\nformula_4 can be expressed with yet another formula, by including the capacitance. The capacitance will cause a flow of charge (a current) towards the membrane on the side of the cytoplasm. This current is usually referred to as displacement current (here denoted formula_5.) The flow will only take place as long as the membrane's storage capacity has not been reached. formula_5 can then be expressed as:\n\nwhere formula_1 is the membrane's capacitance and formula_8 is the change in voltage over time. \nThe current that passes the membrane (formula_9) can be expressed as:\n\nand because formula_10 the following equation for formula_4 can be derived if no additional current is added from an electrode:\nwhere formula_12 represents the change per unit length of the longitudinal current.\n\nCombining equations () and () gives a first version of a cable equation:\n\nwhich is a second-order partial differential equation (PDE).\n\nBy a simple rearrangement of equation () (see later) it is possible to make two important terms appear, namely the length constant (sometimes referred to as the space constant) denoted formula_13 and the time constant denoted formula_14. The following sections focus on these terms.\n\nThe length constant, formula_13 (lambda), is a parameter that indicates how far a stationary current will influence the voltage along the cable. The larger the value of formula_13, the farther the charge will flow. The length constant can be expressed as:\n\nThe larger the membrane resistance, \"r\", the greater the value of formula_13, and the more current will remain inside the axoplasm to travel longitudinally through the axon. The higher the axoplasmic resistance, formula_3, the smaller the value of formula_13, the harder it will be for current to travel through the axoplasm, and the shorter the current will be able to travel.\nIt is possible to solve equation () and arrive at the following equation (which is valid in steady-state conditions, i.e. when time approaches infinity):\n\nWhere formula_20 is the depolarization at formula_21 (point of current injection), \"e\" is the exponential constant (approximate value 2.71828) and formula_22 is the voltage at a given distance \"x\" from \"x\"=0. When formula_23 then\n\nand\n\nwhich means that when we measure formula_24 at distance formula_13 from formula_21 we get\n\nThus formula_27 is always 36.8 percent of formula_20.\n\nNeuroscientists are often interested in knowing how fast the membrane potential, formula_29, of an axon changes in response to changes in the current injected into the axoplasm. The time constant, formula_14, is an index that provides information about that value. formula_14 can be calculated as:\n\nThe larger the membrane capacitance, formula_1, the more current it takes to charge and discharge a patch of membrane and the longer this process will take. The larger the membrane resistance formula_33, the harder it is for a current to induce a change in membrane potential. So the higher the formula_34 the slower the nerve impulse can travel. That means, membrane potential (voltage across the membrane) lags more behind current injections. Response times vary from 1–2 milliseconds in neurons that are processing information that needs high temporal precision to 100 milliseconds or longer. A typical response time is around 20 milliseconds.\n\nIf one multiplies equation () by formula_2 on both sides of the equal sign we get:\n\nand recognize formula_36 on the left side and formula_37 on the right side. The cable equation can now be written in its perhaps best known form:\n\nThis is a 1D Heat equation or Diffusion Equation for which many solution methods, such as Green's functions and Fourier methods, have been developed.\n\nIt is also a special case of the Telegrapher's equation.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "17729026", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17729026", "title": "Cell-free protein synthesis", "text": "Cell-free protein synthesis\n\nCell-free protein synthesis, also known as \"in vitro\" protein synthesis or CFPS, is the production of protein using biological machinery in a cell-free system, that is, without the use of living cells. The \"in vitro\" protein synthesis environment is not constrained by a cell wall or homeostasis conditions necessary to maintain cell viability. Thus, CFPS enables direct access and control of the translation environment which is advantageous for a number of applications including co-translational solubilisation of membrane proteins, optimisation of protein production, incorporation of non-natural amino acids, selective and site-specific labelling. Due to the open nature of the system, different expression conditions such as pH, redox potentials, temperatures, and chaperones can be screened. Since there is no need to maintain cell viability, toxic proteins can be produced. \n\nCommon components of a cell-free reaction include a cell extract, an energy source, a supply of amino acids, cofactors such as magnesium, and the DNA with the desired genes. A cell extract is obtained by lysing the cell of interest and centrifuging out the cell walls, DNA genome, and other debris. The remains are the necessary cell machinery including ribosomes, aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, translation initiation and elongation factors, nucleases, etc.\n\nTwo types of DNA can be used in CFPS: plasmids and linear expression templates (LETs). Plasmids are circular, and only made inside cells. LETs can be made much more effectively via PCR , which replicates DNA much faster than raising cells in an incubator. While LETs are easier and faster to make, plasmid yields are usually much higher in CFPS. Because of this, much research today is focused on optimizing CFPS LET yields to approach the yields of CFPS with plasmids.\n\nAn energy source is an important part of a cell-free reaction. Usually, a separate mixture containing the needed energy source, along with a supply of amino acids, is added to the extract for the reaction. Common sources are phosphoenol pyruvate, acetyl phosphate, and creatine phosphate.\n\nCFPS has many advantages over the traditional \"in vivo\" synthesis of proteins. Most notably, a cell-free reaction, including extract preparation, usually takes 1 –2 days, whereas \"in vivo\" protein expression may take 1–2 weeks.\n\nCFPS is an open reaction. The lack of cell wall allows direct manipulation of the chemical environment. Samples are easily taken, concentrations optimized, and the reaction can be monitored. In contrast, once DNA is inserted into live cells, the reaction cannot be accessed until it is over and the cells are lysed.\n\nAnother advantage to CFPS is the lack of concern for toxicity. Some desired proteins and labeled proteins are toxic to cells when synthesized.\nSince live cells are not being used, the toxicity of the product protein is not a significant concern.\n\nA major application of CFPS is incorporation of unnatural amino acids into protein structures (see expanded genetic code). The openness of the reaction is ideal for inserting the modified tRNAs and unnatural amino acids required for such a reaction.\n\nSynthetic biology has many other uses and is a bright future in fields such as protein evolution, nanomachines, nucleic acid circuits, and synthesis of virus-like particles for vaccines and drug therapy.\n\nOne challenge associated with CFPS is the degradation of the DNA by endogenous nucleases in the cell extract. This is particularly problematic with LETs. Cells have endonucleases that attack random sites of a DNA strands; however, much more common are the exonucleases which attack DNA from the ends. Since plasmids are circular and have no end to which the exonucleases may attach, they are not affected by the latter. LETs, however, are susceptible to both. Because of LET vulnerability, much research today is focused on optimizing CFPS LET yields to approach the yields of CFPS using plasmids.\n\nOne example of this improved protection with plasmids is use of the bacteriophage lambda gam protein. Gam is an inhibitor of RecBCD, an exonuclease found in \"Escherichia coli\" (\"E. coli\"). With the use of gam, CFPS yields with LETs were greatly increased, and were comparable to CFPS yields with plasmids. PURE extracts can also be made, eliminating the concern of exonucleases. These extracts are expensive to make and are not currently an economical solution to the issue of exogenous DNA degradation.\n\nCommon cell extracts in use today are made from \"E. coli\" (ECE), rabbit reticulocytes (RRL), wheat germ (WGE), and insect cells (ICE). All of these extracts are commercially available.\n\nECE is the most popular lysate for several reasons. It is the most inexpensive extract and the least time intensive to create. Also, large amounts of \"E. coli\" are easily grown, and then easily lysed through use of a homogenizer. ECE also provides the highest protein yields. However, high yield production can limit the complexity of the synthesized protein, particularly in post-translational modification. In that regard, the lower efficient eukaryotic systems could be advantageous, provided that modifying enzyme systems have been maintained in the extracts.\n\nEach eukaryotic system has their advantages and disadvantages. For example, WGE extract produces the highest yields of the three eukaryotic extracts; however, it is not as effective for some post-translational modifications such as glycosylation. When choosing an extract, the type of post-translational modification, desired yields, and cost should be taken into account.\n\nThe first elucidation of a codon was done by Marshall Nirenberg and Heinrich J. Matthaei in 1961 at the National Institutes of Health. They used a cell-free system to translate a poly-uracil RNA sequence (or UUUUU... in biochemical terms) and discovered that the polypeptide they had synthesized consisted of only the amino acid phenylalanine. They thereby deduced from this poly-phenylalanine that the codon UUU specified the amino-acid phenylalanine. Extending this work, Nirenberg and his coworkers were able to determine the nucleotide makeup of each codon.\n\n"}

This document will review the current state of research into electrode failure, focusing on recording electrodes as opposed to stimulating electrodes.\n\nChronic brain-computer interfaces come in two varieties, stimulating and recording. Applications for stimulating interfaces include sensory prosthetics (cochlear implants, for example, are the most successful variety of sensory prosthetics) and deep brain stimulation therapies, while recording interfaces can be used for research applications and to record the activity of speech or motor centers directly from the brain. In principle these systems are susceptible to the same tissue response that causes failure in implanted electrodes, but stimulating interfaces can overcome this problem by increasing signal strength.

Research towards this end can be divided into two primary categories: characterizing the specific causes of recording failure, and techniques for preventing or delaying electrode failure.\n\nAs mentioned above, if there is to be significant progress towards long-term implantable electrodes, an important step is documenting the response of living tissue to electrode implantation in both the acute and chronic timelines. It is ultimately this tissue response that causes electrodes to fail by encapsulating the electrode itself in a protective layer called a “glial scar,” (see 2.2). One serious impediment to understanding the tissue response is the lack of true standardization of implantation technique or of electrode materials. Common materials for electrode or probe construction include silicon, platinum, iridium, polyimide, ceramic, gold, as well as others. In addition to the variety of materials used, electrodes are constructed in many different shapes, including planar shanks, simple uniform microwires, and probes that taper to a thin tip from a wider base. Implantable electrode research also employs many different techniques for surgically implanting the electrodes; the most critical differences are whether or not the implant is anchored across the skull and the speed of insertion. The overall observed tissue response is caused by a combination of the traumatic injury of electrode insertion and the persistent presence of a foreign body in the neural tissue.\n\nDamage caused by electrodes in the short term is caused by the insertion into the tissue. Consequently, research into minimizing this is focused on the geometry of the electrode and the proper technique for insertion. Short term effects of electrode insertion on surrounding tissue have been documented extensively. They include cell death (both neuronal and glial), severed neuronal processes and blood vessels, mechanical tissue compression, and collection of debris resulting from cell death.\n\nIn the Bjornsson et al. 2006 study, an ex vivo apparatus was constructed explicitly to study the deformation of and damage to neural tissue during electrode insertion. Electrodes were constructed from silicon wafers to have three different sharpnesses (interior angle of 5° for sharp, 90° for medium, 150° for blunt). Insertion speed was also presented at three speeds, 2 mm/s, 0.5 mm/s, and 0.125 mm/s. Qualitative assessments of vascular damage were made by taking real-time images of electrodes being inserted into 500 um thick coronal brain slices. To facilitate direct visualization of vascular deformation, tissue was labeled with fluorescent dextran and microbeads before viewing. The fluorescent dextran filled the blood vessels, allowing initial geometry to be visualized along with any distortions or breakages. Fluorescent microbeads lodged throughout the tissue, providing discrete coordinates that aided in computerized calculations of strain and deformation. Analysis of the images prompted the division of tissue damage into 4 categories:\nFluid displacement by device insertion frequently resulted in ruptured vessels. Severing and dragging were consistently present along the insertion track, but did not correlate with tip geometry. Rather, these features were correlated with insertion speed, being more prevalent at medium and slow insertion speeds. Faster insertion of sharp probes was the only condition resulting in no reported vascular damage.\n\nWhen implanted in neural tissue in the long term, microelectrodes stimulate a sort of foreign body response, primarily effected by astrocytes and microglia. Each cell-type performs many functions in supporting healthy, uninjured neural tissue, and each is also ‘activated’ by injury related mechanisms that result in changes in morphology, expression profile, and function. Tissue response has also been shown to be greater in situation where the electrodes are anchored through the subject’s skull; the tethering forces aggravate the injury caused by the electrode’s insertion and sustain the tissue response.\n\nOne function taken on by microglia when activated is to cluster around foreign bodies and degrade them enzymatically. It has been proposed that when the foreign body cannot be degraded, as in the case of implanted electrodes whose material composition is resistant to such enzymatic dissolution, this ‘frustrated phagocytosis’ contributes to the failure of recordings, releasing necrotic substances into the immediate vicinity and contributing to cell death around the electrode.\n\nActivated astrocytes form the major component of the encapsulating tissue that forms around implanted electrodes. “\"Current theories hold that glial encapsulation, i.e. gliosis, insulates the electrode from nearby neurons, thereby hindering diffusion and increasing impedance, extends the distance between the electrode and its nearest target neurons, or creates an inhibitory environment for neurite extension, thus repelling regenerating neural processes away from recording sites\"”. Either activated astrocytes or buildup of cellular debris from cell death around the electrode would act to insulate the recording sites from other, active neurons. Even very small increases in the separation between the electrode and local nerve population can insulate the electrode completely, as electrodes must be within 100 um to get a signal.\n\nAnother recent study addresses the problem of the tissue response. Michigan-type electrodes (see article for detailed dimensions) were surgically inserted into the brains of Adult male Fischer 344 rats; a control population was treated with the same surgical procedures, but the electrode was implanted and immediately removed so that a comparison could be made between tissue response to acute injury and chronic presence. Animal subjects were sacrificed at 2 and 4 weeks after implantation to quantify the tissue response with histological and immunostaining techniques. Samples were stained for ED1 and GFAP presence. ED1+ reading is indicative of the presence of macrophages, and was observed in a densely packed region within approximately 50 um of the electrode surface. ED1+ cells were present at both 2 and 4 weeks after implantation, with no significant difference between the time points. Presence of GFAP indicates presence of reactive astrocytes, and was seen at 2 and 4 weeks after implantation, extending more than 500 um from the electrode surface. Stab controls showed signs of inflammation and reactive gliosis as well, however signals were significantly lower in intensity than those found in chronic test subjects, and diminished noticeably from 2 weeks to 4 weeks. This is strong evidence that glial scarring and the encapsulation, and eventual isolation, of implanted microelectrodes is primarily a result of chronic implantation, and not the acute injury.\n\nAnother recent study addressing the impact of chronically implanted electrodes points that tungsten-coated electrodes seem to be well tolerated by the nervous tissue, inducing a small and circumscribed inflammatory response only in the vicinity of the implant, associated with a small cell death .\n\nTechniques for combating long-term failure of electrodes are understandably focused on disarming the foreign body response. This can most obviously be achieved by improving the biocompatibility of the electrode itself, thus reducing the tissue’s perception of the electrode as a foreign substance. As a result, much of the research towards alleviating the tissue response is focused on improved biocompatibility.\n\nIt is difficult to effectively evaluate progress towards improved electrode biocompatibility because of the variety of research in this field.\n\nThis section loosely categorizes different approaches to improving biocompatibility seen in the literature. Descriptions of the research are limited to a brief summary of the theory and technique, not the results, which are presented in detail in the original publications. Thus far, no technique has achieved results drastic and sweeping enough to change the fact of the encapsulation response.\n\nResearch focusing on bioactive coatings to alleviate the tissue response is conducted primarily on silicon-based electrodes. Techniques include the following: \n\nAnother body of research dedicated to improving the biocompatibility of electrodes focuses on functionalizing the electrode surface with relevant protein sequences. Studies have demonstrated that surfaces functionalized with sequences taken from adhesive peptides will decrease cellular motility and support higher neuronal populations.\nIt has also been shown that peptides can be selected to specifically support neuronal growth or glial growth, and that peptides can be deposited in patterns to guide cellular outgrowth. If populations of neurons can be induced to grow onto inserted electrodes, electrode failure should be minimized.\n\nKennedy’s research details the use of a glass cone electrode which contains a microwire built inside of it. The microwire is used for recording, and the cone is filled with neurotrophic substances or neural tissue in order to promote growth of local neurons into the electrode to allow for recording. This approach overcomes tissue response by encouraging neurons to grow closer to recording surface.\n\nSome notable success has also been made in developing microfluid delivery mechanisms that could ostensibly deliver targeted pharmacological agents to electrode implantation sites to alleviate the tissue response.\n\nJust as in other fields, some effort is devoted explicitly to the development of standardized research tools. The goal of these tools is to provide a powerful, objective way of analyzing the failure of chronic neural electrodes in order to improve the reliability of the technology.\n\nOne such effort describes the development of an \"in vitro\" model to study the tissue response phenomenon. Midbrains are surgically removed from day 14 Fischer 344 rats and grown in culture to create a confluent layer of neurons, microglia, and astrocytes. This confluent layer can be used to study the foreign body response by scrape-injury or depositing electrode microwires on the monolayer, fixing the culture at defined time points after insertion/injury and studying tissue response with histological methods.\nAnother research tool is a numerical model of the mechanical electrode-tissue interface. The goal of this model is not to detail the electrical or chemical characteristics of the interface, but the mechanical ones created by electrode-tissue adhesion, tethering forces, and strain mismatch. This model can be used to predict forces generated at the interface by electrodes of different material stiffnesses or geometries.\n\nFor studies requiring a massive quantity of identical electrodes, a bench-top technique has been demonstrated in the literature to use a silicon shape as a master to produce multiple copies out of polymeric materials via a PDMS intermediate. This is exceptionally useful for material studies or for labs who need a high volume of electrodes but cannot afford to buy them all.\n\n\n"}

Its mission is “to teach, practice, and disseminate The Religion of The Stars, a way of life for the Aquarian Age, as set forth in writings of C.C. Zain.” The Church is the continuation of an initiatic organization, the Brotherhood of Light, established in the same city in 1915. The 1932 reorganization as The Church of Light was a response to ordinances passed that year by Los Angeles County “prohibiting both the teaching and practice of astrology.” \n\nThe Church is the continuation of an initiatic organization, the Brotherhood of Light, established also in Los Angeles in 1915. The Brotherhood of Light lessons, on the three branches of occult science, were written between the spring of 1910 and 1950 by Elbert Benjamine (also known as C.C. Zain, born Benjamin Parker Williams). Benjamine had been invited in 1909 by the leaders of the Hermetic Brotherhood of Luxor (HBofL) in Denver to join them as successor to Minnie Higgin, who had been the order’s astrologer until her death that year. The surviving Council members proposed to Benjamine that he rewrite the order’s teachings in a systematic form as the basis for a new organization that would “bring occultism to the life of ordinary people.” This change was inspired by orders from Max Theon to close the Hermetic Brotherhood of Luxor following the death of his wife the previous year. After five years of preparation and study, Elbert Benjamine came to Los Angeles in 1915 and began to hold meetings. “At that point it still operated as a secret society. On November 11, 1918, the Brotherhood of Light opened its doors to the public, offering classes and a home-study course.” \n\nAstro-Philosophical Publications, founded in Denver in 1892, was a publishing arm of the Hermetic Brotherhood of Luxor created by Henry and Belle Wagner. The authors it published included Thomas H. Burgoyne and Sarah Stanley Grimke, both cited by Benjamine as sources of Brotherhood teachings. He accorded the same status to \"Ghost Land\" and \"Art Magic\" by Emma Hardinge Britten. Another early HBofL member, Genevieve Stebbins, relocated to California from England in 1917 with her husband Norman Astley, and provided assistance to the Benjamines in establishing the Brotherhood of Light.\n\nThe 1932 reorganization as The Church of Light was a response to ordinances passed that year by Los Angeles County “prohibiting both the teaching and practice of astrology.” The three founding officers were \n\n\nFollowing the 1943 remarriage of Elbert Benjamine, his son and heir apparent Will Benjamine departed in acrimony and established the Stellar Ministry, “a short-lived religious group that taught a mixture of Hermeticism and Christianity.” Despite this interim disharmony, Church of Light membership continues to steadily grow with continual newcomers.\n\nThe 21 volume Brotherhood of Light lessons are publicly accessible to nonmembers of the church, but only members participate in a system of written examinations covering each volume. Each examination passed advances the member one degree. Seven volumes each are devoted to astrology, alchemy, and magic. Students who complete all 21 degrees (including examinations) are awarded a “Hermetician’s Certificate.”\n\nChurch headquarters were located through 1999 at 117 (later 2341) Coral Street in Los Angeles, which had been the home of the Benjamines. After several years based in Brea, California, in 2005 it relocated to Albuquerque, New Mexico. Regular classes and services are held at its headquarters, 2119 Gold Avenue, many of which are viewable as live streams and archived on the church website.

Criminal intelligence is developed by using surveillance, informants, interrogation, and research, or may be just picked up on the \"street\" by individual police officers.\n\nSome larger law enforcement agencies have a department, division or section specifically designed to gather disparate pieces of information and develop criminal intelligence. One of the most effective ways of applying criminal intelligence is first to record it (store in a computer system) which can be \"mined\" (searched) for specific information.\n\nCriminal intelligence:\n\nCRIMINT is the result of the collection, analysis, and interpretation of all available information concerning known and potential criminal threats and vulnerabilities of supported organizations. Army law enforcement agencies are the primary liaison representatives of the Army to federal, state, local, and host nation (HN) agencies for exchanging police intelligence. They collect criminal intelligence (\"CRIMINT\") and human intelligence (HUMINT) within the provisions of applicable statutes and regulations. Army law enforcement agencies have the capability to analyze and disseminate collected time-sensitive information concerning a criminal threat against Army interests. The value of such intelligence cannot be overemphasized; it not only serves the purpose of police investigations, it also contributes to the development of countermeasures to safeguard Army personnel, materials, information, and other resources.\n\nThe CRIMINT process is effective intelligence results from a series of interrelated activities. The intelligence process is a continuous process of collecting and converting data into intelligence products to be integrated into operations. The process consists of several phases with continuous evaluation and feedback at each phase and at the end of the process. With the minor modification of adding “reporting” to the second phase, the following text outlines the intelligence process as discussed in Army Regulation (AR) 525-13.\n\n\n\"Criminal intelligence analysis\" has been recognized by law enforcement as a useful support tool for over twenty-five years and is successfully used within the international community. International organizations, such as the International Police (INTERPOL), European Police (EUROPOL) and the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY), and while there are many definitions of Criminal Intelligence Analysis in use throughout the world, the one definition agreed in June 1992 by an international group of twelve European INTERPOL member countries and subsequently adopted by other countries is as follows:\n\nThe identification of and provision of insight into the relationship between crime data and other potentially relevant data with a view to police and judicial practice.\n\nAs such, criminal intelligence is a more intense or specific application towards investigations than criminology.\n\nThere are several techniques intended for criminal investigation analysis. One of them is link analysis which is dedicated to evaluate relationships between nodes. In this specific category there are several applications such as IBM i2 that provides integrated tools to support crime investigators and next-generation, single platforms as DataWalk that imports, integrates and links structured and unstructured data at massive scale for further visual analysis, investigation and collaboration.\n\n"}
{"id": "229468", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=229468", "title": "Cyberman", "text": "Cyberman\n\nThe Cybermen are a fictional race of cyborgs who are among the most persistent enemies of the Doctor in the British science fiction television programme, \"Doctor Who\". Within the context of the series, the Cybermen are a species of emotionless space-faring cyborgs who look to co-opt human beings or other similar species to join and populate their ranks. First appearing in 1966, the Cybermen were created by Dr. Kit Pedler (the unofficial scientific advisor to the show) and story editor Gerry Davis.\n\nThe Cybermen have seen many redesigns and costume changes over \"Doctor Who\"s long run. Over the years, the show and its many spin-offs in other media have also presented a number of varying origin stories for the species. In their first appearance, \"The Tenth Planet\" (1966), they are explained as being the product of humans from Earth's nearly identical \"twin planet\" of Mondas who upgraded themselves into cyborgs in a bid for self-preservation. Forty years later, \"The Age of Steel\" (2006) depicted the Cybermen's separate emergence on a parallel universe version of Earth. \"Doctor Who\" audio dramas, novels, and comic books have also elaborated on the origins for the Cybermen, or presented alternative origin stories. \n\nIn the show's 2017 episode \"The Doctor Falls\", it is stated that the Cybermen are the universe's great example of parallel evolution, due to the inevitability of humans and human-like species attempting to upgrade themselves through technology, thereby resolving continuity tensions in the history of the Cybermen.\n\nA mainstay of \"Doctor Who\" since the 1960s, the Cybermen have also made appearances in related programs and spin-off media, including novels, audiobooks, comic books, and video games. Cybermen stories continued to be produced in officially licensed \"Doctor Who\" productions between 1989 and 2005, when the TV show was off the air, with many writers choosing to fill in gaps in the history of the Cybermen or depict new encounters between them and the Doctor. The species also appeared in the \"Doctor Who\" TV spin-off \"Torchwood\", appearing in the fourth episode, \"Cyberwoman\" (2006).\n\nThe name \"Cyberman\" comes from cybernetics, a term used in Norbert Wiener's book \"Cybernetics or Control and Communication in the Animal and the Machine\" (MIT Press, 1948). Wiener used the term in reference to the control of complex systems in the animal world and in mechanical networks, in particular self-regulating control systems. By 1960, doctors were performing research into surgically or mechanically augmenting humans or animals to operate machinery in space, leading to the portmanteau \"cyborg\", for \"cybernetic organism\".\n\nIn the 1960s, \"spare-part\" surgery was starting out, with the first, gigantic heart-lung machines being developed. There were also serious suggestions of wiring the nerve endings of amputees directly into machines for quicker response. In 1963, Kit Pedler had a conversation with his wife (who was also a doctor) about what would happen if a person had so many prostheses that they could no longer distinguish themselves between man and machine. He got the opportunity to develop this idea when, in 1966, after an appearance on the BBC science programmes \"Tomorrow's World\" and \"Horizon\", the BBC hired him to help on the \"Doctor Who\" serial \"The War Machines\" (1966). That eventually led to him writing, with Gerry Davis' help, \"The Tenth Planet\" (1966) for \"Doctor Who\".\n\nPedler, influenced by the logic-driven Treens from the \"Dan Dare\" comic strip, originally envisaged the Cybermen as \"space monks\", but was persuaded by Davis to concentrate on his fears about the direction of spare-part surgery. The original Cybermen were imagined as human, but with plastic and metal prostheses. The Cybermen of \"The Tenth Planet\" still have human hands, and their facial structures are visible beneath the masks they wear. However, over time, they evolved into metallic, more robot-like designs.\n\nThe Cybermen first appear in the serial \"The Tenth Planet\" in 1966, set in 1986, in which their origin story is given as follows. Millions of years ago, during prehistoric times, Earth had a twin planet known as Mondas. Mondas was knocked out of solar orbit and drifted into deep space. The Mondasians, already far in advance of Earth's technology and fearful for their race's survival, their lifespans shortening, replaced most of their bodies with cybernetic parts. Having eventually removed all emotion from their brains, to maintain their sanity, the natives installed a drive propulsion system so they could pilot the planet itself through space. As the original race was limited in numbers and were continually being depleted, the Mondasians – now Cybermen – became a race of conquerors who reproduced by taking other organic beings and forcibly changing them into Cybermen. These Cybermen fight against the First Doctor (William Hartnell) when the Cybermen attempt to drain the Earth's energy to make way for Mondas' return to the solar system. However, Mondas absorbs too much energy from Earth, destroying it and those Cybermen on Earth. The adventure takes its physical toll on the Doctor, forcing him to regenerate for the first time, becoming the Second Doctor (Patrick Troughton).\nRedesigned Cybermen next appear in \"The Moonbase\" (1967), set in 2070, opposite the Second Doctor, who discovers a crypt containing Cybermen during a visit to the Moon. They attempt to remotely destroy the Earth by affecting its weather patterns with a device called the Gravitron. However, the Gravitron is used against them, hurling them into space. Later that year, \"The Tomb of the Cybermen\" sees a 25th Century human expedition discover sarcophagi containing hibernating Cybermen on the planet Telos, where the creatures arise and attack. This episode introduces the cybermats, small mechanical scouts used by the Cybermen, as well as their leader, the Cyber Controller. In \"The Wheel in Space\" (1968), the Doctor and his crew face off against the Cybermen on a marooned Earth space station in the 21st Century. This episode introduces the Cyber-Planner, an immobile unit which directs the Cybermen. The Cybermen plan to take over the space station, after which their fleet will invade Earth. The Doctor uses an x-ray laser to destroy the Cybermen. In \"The Invasion\" that same year, the Doctor and his companions visit late 20th century England where he discovers an army of Cybermen are hidden on Earth, working with magnate Tobias Vaughn (Kevin Stoney) for their fleet to invade Earth. Their invasion is defeated by the Doctor and the military support of the newly formed United Nations Intelligence Taskforce.\n\nThe Cybermen were not shown to face the Third Doctor (Jon Pertwee) during his original run, but one is shown as part of an exhibit in \"Carnival of Monsters\" (1973). The Fourth Doctor (Tom Baker) is next to encounter a small group of Cybermen in \"Revenge of the Cybermen\" (1975), for which they were once again redesigned. These Cybermen are depicted as the wandering remnants of a fallen empire, ravaged by the so-called Cyber-Wars against victorious humanity, which had crucially exploited the Cybermen's weakness to gold. These Cybermen attempt to restore the glory of their race by destroying the humans' gold-rich asteroid Voga. Another long hiatus preceded \"Earthshock\" (1982), in which the Fifth Doctor (Peter Davison) encounters Cybermen in Earth in the year 2526, who seek to destroy the planet with a large bomb while alien dignitaries visit Earth to discuss the ongoing Cyber-Wars. After the Doctor foils this plan, they decide to crash their freighter into the planet to much the same effect. The Doctor's companion, boy genius Adric (Matthew Waterhouse), is trapped on board and attempts to escape from the freighter, but inadvertently causes it to hurtle back in time. The freighter crashes into prehistoric Earth, killing Adric and triggering the K-T extinction event. The Cybermen appear once more in the Fifth Doctor's era, alongside the four previous Doctors, in \"The Five Doctors\" (1983), when they are all transported alongside other nemeses of the Doctor to his home planet of Gallifrey by the Time Lord President Borusa (Philip Latham).\n\n\"Attack of the Cybermen\" (1985) is set much earlier in the Cyber-Wars than \"Revenge\", during a time in which the Cybermen faced defeat following the human invention of the glittergun and the discovery of gold-rich Voga. The Cybermen attempt to use a time machine to avert the destruction of Mondas. Their plan fails, and they also lose their adopted homeworld of Telos to its original inhabitants, the Cryons, following the intervention of the Sixth Doctor (Colin Baker). The Cybermen appeared for a final time in the classic series in \"Silver Nemesis\" (1988), in which a fleet of Cybermen warships assemble to convert Earth into a new Mondas. A Cybermen scouting party is sent to Earth in search of the legendary Nemesis statue, a Time Lord artefact of immense power, made of the \"living metal\" validium. The intervention of the Seventh Doctor (Sylvester McCoy) and his companion Ace (Sophie Aldred), however, ensures that the Nemesis destroys the entire cyber-fleet instead. Between the series' cancellation and its subsequent revival, they make one other brief appearance in the 1993 Children in Need special \"Dimensions in Time\", as one of several enemies used by evil Time Lady the Rani (Kate O'Mara) to hunt the Doctor.\n\"Doctor Who\" was revived after a long hiatus by new showrunner Russell T Davies in 2005. By then, development of CGI let script-writers include large numbers of Cybermen or Daleks in stories. In the first series of the revived programme, the Cybermen do not appear except for the inactive head of one, which is seen in a private museum of alien artefacts on Earth in the episode \"Dalek\". For series 2 in 2006, Cybermen were reintroduced with a new origin story set in a parallel universe. In the \"Rise of the Cybermen\"/\"The Age of Steel\" two-part story, the Tenth Doctor (David Tennant) and his companions crash land in a parallel London where the Cybermen are being created on modern-day Earth. The Cybermen are created by the owner of Cybus Industries, the dying transhumanist mad scientist John Lumic (Roger Lloyd-Pack). Lumic's Cybermen successfully convert much of the world's population by placing their human brains into robotic shells. The Doctor and his friends free London from their control. A human resistance group, the Preachers, then sets about to clean up the remainder of Lumic's factories around the world. The Cybermen reappear in the 2006 finale \"Army of Ghosts\"/\"Doomsday\", exploiting a breach between universes to invade the Doctor's Earth. This breach is caused by a transport device belonging to the Daleks, who reveal themselves and trigger all-out war between the two species. The Doctor ultimately re-opens the breach, causing the Cybermen and all but a few Daleks to become trapped inside before it is re-sealed. Cybermen next appear in the 2008 \"Doctor Who\" Christmas special \"The Next Doctor\", emerging in 1851 London after the Daleks damaged the walls of reality in the previous episode. They attempt to raise a new army on Earth using period technology, but are again foiled by the Doctor.\n\nAfter Steven Moffat took over the role of executive producer in 2010, Cyberman of essentially the design introduced by Davies continued to appear. No explicit reference is made to their origin, but generally the stylised 'c' (for Cybus Corporation) on their breastplate had been replaced by a plain circle, implying that they were not from the parallel universe. They appear in \"The Pandorica Opens\" (2010) alongside many of the Doctor's recurring enemies as part of an alliance dedicated to stopping him, arriving in cyber ships in 102 CE. They appear again in \"A Good Man Goes to War\" (2011), when the Eleventh Doctor's (Matt Smith) companion Rory (Arthur Darvill) demands the location of a secret asteroid base in a quadrant of space which they monitor in the 52nd century. The Doctor destroys a large fleet of their spaceships to indicate their seriousness. In \"Closing Time\", an ancient slumbering cyber ship is awakened in 2011 Colchester, and the Doctor and his friend Craig (James Corden) work together to repel a Cyberman invasion. This episode also reintroduces cybermats to the series. Neil Gaiman's episode \"Nightmare in Silver\" (2013) depicts the re-emergence of the Cybermen in the distant future, following what was believed to be their complete eradication by humankind. These redesigned Cybermen have discarded many of their limitations, exhibiting increased speed, rapid upgrading to overcome weaknesses, and the ability to cyberconvert any biological organism into their ranks. The Eleventh Doctor undergoes a partial cyberconversion, and mentally duels with a Cyber-Planner for control of his body. The emperor of the galaxy (Warwick Davis) orders a planet's destruction to wipe out the Cyberman, but one intact cybermite (new, minuscule cybermat variants) is later seen floating through space. A dead Cyberman head is briefly shown in the UNIT Black Archive in \"The Day of the Doctor\", and in \"The Time of the Doctor\" they are among the many species which besiege the planet Trenzalore for centuries. In the latter episode, the Doctor also uses a disembodied Cyberman head, devoid of any remaining organic parts; named \"Handles\", he serves as the Doctor's personal assistant and confidant for several centuries until his eventual 'death' brings the Doctor to tears.\n\nIn the finale of the 2014 series, \"Dark Water\"/\"Death in Heaven\", the Twelfth Doctor (Peter Capaldi) learns too late that the Cybermen have formed an alliance with Missy (the current, female, incarnation of the Master) (Michelle Gomez), who is converting the stolen bodies of the dead into an army. A cyberconversion process begins on all of Earth's dead. Missy offers the Doctor control of the Cybermen army so they can rule the universe together, but her plan is foiled when Danny (Samuel Anderson), the cyber-converted boyfriend of the Doctor's companion Clara Oswald (Jenna Coleman), resists his programming and destroys himself along with all the other Cybermen. Cybermen are next seen in \"Face the Raven\" (2015), among the various alien refugees hiding in London, and in series finale \"Hell Bent\", in which a rusted Cyberman is imprisoned in the Cloisters of Gallifrey. The origin of the Cybermen of Mondas is told in the two-episode series 10 finale \"World Enough and Time\" / \"The Doctor Falls\", when a Mondasian colony ship is stuck escaping the gravity of a black hole for many years. The human-like Mondasians, assisted unknowingly by the Master (John Simm), begin upgrading their population to adapt to life aboard the decaying ship. The Doctor reflects on all the societies that have created Cybermen and concludes that the Cybermen is an example of parallel evolution: a concept that is waiting to impose itself on human-like species across the universe. Ultimately, this encounter with the Cybermen proves brutal: the Doctor's companion Bill Potts (Pearl Mackie) is cyberconverted; two incarnations of the Master (Simm and Gomez) kill one another in a disagreement over standing alongside the Doctor; and the Doctor's companion Nardole (Matt Lucas) is left behind on the ship to look after human colonists, for whom inevitable cyberconversion has been delayed but not averted. The Doctor, exhausted to a point of nearing death, awakens in his TARDIS and begins to regenerate.\n\nThe Cybermen have appeared in various spin-off media.\n\nThe Cybermen were also featured in the novel \"Iceberg\" by actor David Banks, who played the Cyber Leader in the television series from \"Earthshock\" to \"Silver Nemesis\". Banks had previously written, in 1988, \"Cybermen\", a fictional history of the Cybermen which included a \"future\" design for them. The Missing Adventure Novel \"Killing Ground\" also features Cybermen of the type seen in \"Revenge of the Cybermen\". During this novel, the Sixth Doctor's new companion Grant Markham returns to his home planet and learns that a group of Cybermen have hidden on it for centuries, with his robophobia being based around the repressed memory of witnessing a Cyberman kill his mother before he escaped.\n\nIn two Virgin Missing Adventures novels by Craig Hinton, the Cybermen become Cyberlords at some point in their history. They are mentioned in passing in Hinton's \"The Crystal Bucephalus\", where the Cyberlord Hegemony is a peaceful future version of the Cybermen who have an empire in the Milky Way; their description was modelled after Banks's designs. In \"The Quantum Archangel\", there are numerous unexplained references to the Cyberlords as an extremely advanced race. At one point, they are referred to as the Time Lords' greatest ally in the Millennium War, though because that war was supposed to have taken place a very long time before the modern era, it is unclear how this bit of Cyberhistory fits in or whether or not they have achieved advanced time travel capabilities. While not explicitly mentioned, Hinton may have adopted this idea from the aborted script for the Five Doctors by Robert Holmes (scriptwriter), which would have had the Cybermen adopting Time Lord DNA to achieve their higher state of being.\n\nThe Past Doctor Adventures novel \"Illegal Alien\" featured Cybermen and Cybermats in London during the Blitz. Cyber-technology left over from that adventure was subsequently misused in \"Loving the Alien\", written by the same authors. The Fifth Doctor story \"Warmonger\" by Terrance Dicks has the Cybermen join the Doctor's alliance against Morbius. The First Doctor story \"The Time Travellers\" by Simon Guerrier, set in an alternate reality, has the Cybermen (who are never named) living at the South Pole and trading advanced technology to South Africa. The Eighth Doctor Adventures novel \"Hope\" by Mark Clapham features the Silverati, a group of cybernetically enhanced humans heavily reminiscent of the Cybermen, in existence in the very far future as the universe approaches its end, with some evidence suggesting that the Silverati were adapted from remnants of the Cybermen of the present.\n\nThe Cybermen have appeared in several Big Finish audio plays battling the Doctor, the first of which was \"Sword of Orion\" (released on CD in 2001 and broadcast on BBC 7 in 2005), where the Eighth Doctor deals with humans and androids engaged in a war who seek Cyber-technology to improve their sides. The 2002 play \"Spare Parts\" explored aspects of the Cybermen's origin, revealing that the design was ironically only perfected after their creator, Doctorman Allan, studied the biology of the Fifth Doctor and duplicated a third lobe to the Doctor's brain that controlled his body functions. They were the villains in the company's BBCi webcast \"Real Time\" in 2002 and appeared in a linked trilogy of plays entitled \"The Harvest\" (2004), \"The Reaping\" (2006) and \"The Gathering\" (2006), where small groups of Cybermen attempt to manipulate humans into setting up conversion factories on Earth. They appear in \"Human Resources\", which Big Finish produced for radio BBC 7 and subsequently released on CD, and sees the Eighth Doctor averting a plan to take control of a new weapons system. In the Fourth Doctor Adventures audio \"The Fate of Krelos\"/\"Return to Telos\", the Fourth Doctor, Leela and K9 discover that the Cybermen planted nanobots on Jamie during their past trip to Telos that allow the Cybermen to infect K9 and subsequently use the TARDIS to take over the machinery of the planet Krelos, but the Doctor is able to use a robot drone to go back to his original trip to Telos and prevent Jamie being exposed to the nanites, undoing these events. The Sixth Doctor joins forces with the Second Doctor's companions Jamie and Zoe to deal with two different Cybermen assaults in \"Legend of the Cybermen\" and \"Last of the Cybermen\"; \"Legend\" sees Zoe made into the new Mistress of the Land of Fiction, bringing in the Sixth Doctor and a fictional version of Jamie to stop the Cybermen conquering the Land, and \"Last\" depicts the Sixth swapping places with the Second just as the younger Doctor discovers a Cybermen plot to alter the outcome of the last battle of the Cyber-Wars. \n\nThe first instalment of a four-CD series titled \"Cyberman\", which does not feature the Doctor, was released in September 2005. \"Sword of Orion\" and the \"Cyberman\" series are set around the \"Great Orion Cyber-Wars\" of the 26th century, when androids rebelled against humanity in the Orion System and both human and android turned to the Cybermen to gain a military advantage. In \"Sword Of Orion\", the Cybermen are still entombed on Telos and are mostly forgotten, setting it before \"Earthshock\"; by the time of \"Cyberman\", Telos has been destroyed by an asteroid collision, placing that series after \"Attack of the Cybermen\". The Bernice Summerfield play \"The Crystal of Cantus\" features a former human colony turned into Cybermen, with Irving Braxiatel planning to use them as a private army. A Cyberman tomb also appeared in the Bernice Summerfield play \"Silver Lining\", which came free with \"Doctor Who Magazine\" #351.\n\nThey have also appeared in the various \"Doctor Who\" comic strips, beginning with \"The Coming of the Cybermen\" in \"TV Comic\" #824-#827. TV Comic cashed in on their frequent presence in the TV series in the late 1960s by featuring them regularly, and they appeared in \"Flower Power\" (TVC #832-#835), \"Cyber-Mole\" (TVC #842-#845), \"The Cyber Empire\" (TVC #850-#853), \"Eskimo Joe\" (TVC #903-#906), \"Masquerade\" (TVC Holiday Special 1968), \"The Time Museum\" (TVC Annual 1969), \"The Champion\" (TVC Holiday Special 1969) and \"Test-Flight\" (TVC Annual 1970). Their absence from the TV show for most of the 1970s was reflected in a lack of appearances in the strip: they eventually returned in the early 1980s in the \"Doctor Who Monthly\" strip \"Junk-Yard Demon\" (DWM #58-#59). They made further appearances after the publication was re-titled \"Doctor Who Magazine\": \"Exodus\"/\"Revelation\"/\"Genesis\" (DWM #108-#110), \"The World Shapers\" (DWM #127-#129, written by Grant Morrison, which revealed that the Voord were the race that evolved into the Cybermen and that Mondas was previously the planet Marinus), \"The Good Soldier\" (DWM #175-#178) and \"The Flood\" (DWM #346-#353). In addition, a Cyberman named Kroton, who originally appeared in a couple of \"Doctor Who Weekly\" back-up strips called \"Throwback: The Soul of a Cyberman\" (DWW #5-#7) and \"Ship of Fools\" (DWW #23-#24), was reintroduced in \"Unnatural Born Killers\" (DWM #277) and was briefly a companion of the Eighth Doctor in \"The Company of Thieves\" (DWM #284-#286) and \"The Glorious Dead\" (DWM #287-#296). The Cybermen had their own one-page strip in DWM from issues #215-#238, written by Alan Barnes and drawn by Adrian Salmon.\n\nIn 1996, the \"Radio Times\" published a \"Doctor Who\" comic strip. The first story, entitled \"Dreadnought\", featured the Cybermen attacking a human starship in 2220 and introduced the strip companion Stacy Townsend.\n\nIn the \"Doctor Who\"/\"Star Trek\" crossover, , the Cybermen join forces with the Borg, forcing the Eleventh Doctor to join forces with the crew of the \"Enterprise\"-D to stop them. The Borg and Cybermen have begun to attack and convert worlds without warning, with the apparent 'leader' being a Cyber-Controller with Borg components. The Doctor also recalls a past incident where he helped the crew of the original \"Enterprise\" defeat a Cyberman infiltration of a Federation outpost in his fourth incarnation, although it would appear that this is a recent addition to his past history as the Eleventh Doctor also remembers \"not\" remembering that encounter. The Cybermen attempt to subvert and take over the Borg Collective, forcing the Doctor and the \"Enterprise\" to ally with the Borg to stop the Cybermen and restore the Collective to normal.\n\nThe Cybermen also feature in the Titan Comics 2016 multi-Doctor event story \"Supremacy of the Cybermen\", which depicts the last Cybermen at the end of the universe forming an alliance with Rassilon- after he was exiled from Gallifrey by the Twelfth Doctor in \"Hell Bent\"- with the goal of conquering Gallifrey and using Time Lord energy to regenerate the universe into one under Cyber-control. Although Rassilon's insight allows the Cybermen to conquer history and defeat all of the past Doctors, the Twelfth Doctor is able to convince Rassilon to help him after the Cybermen betray Rassilon, the two turning the Cybermens' equipment against them so that the universe is 'regenerated' to a point before the Cybermen conquered Gallifrey, with only the Twelfth Doctor (and possibly Rassilon) remembering these events.\n\nThe 2010 video game \"\", features Cybermen of the 2006 design without the Cybus Industries chest plate. These Cybermen are unearthed in the Arctic in 2010; their ship is said to have been damaged by a time-storm and crashed 10,000 years earlier. The player plays as the Eleventh Doctor and his companion Amy, who work to defeat the Cybermen. They also appear on Telos in both the android games \"\" and Doctor Who And The Dalek.\n\nThe Cybermen appear as enemies in \"Lego Dimensions\", and one was added as a playable character in Wave 3.\n\nWhile the Doctor's archenemy, the Daleks, were on the whole unchanged during the original series's 26-season run, the Cybermen were seen to change with almost every encounter. The Cybermen are humanoid, but have been altered until they have few remaining organic parts. They retain living human brains. In their first appearance in the series, the only parts of their bodies that still seemed human were their hands; by their next appearance in \"The Moonbase\" (1967), their bodies were entirely covered in their metallic suits, with their hands replaced by three finger claws, but they changed back to regular five-fingered hands in \"The Invasion\" (1968). As they are relatively few, the Cybermen tend towards covert activity, scheming from hiding and using human pawns or robots to act in their place until they need to appear. They also seek to increase their numbers by converting others into Cybermen (a process known as \"cyber-conversion\" or Cybernisation\" in the older episodes and \"upgrading\" in the newer episodes), an often painful process as body parts are removed and replaced with cybernetic replacements.\n\nIt is implied that there are still organic components beneath their suits, meaning they are cyborgs, not robots: in \"The Tenth Planet\", a Cyberman tells a group of humans that \"our brains are just like yours\", although by the time of \"Attack of the Cybermen\" (1985), their brains seem to have been replaced with electronics. Also in this story, two human slave-prisoners of the Cybermen on the planet Telos, named Bates and Stratton, reveal that their organic arms and legs have been removed by the Cybermen and replaced by cyber-substitutes. In \"Earthshock\" (1982), the actors' chins were vaguely visible through a clear perspex area on the helmet to suggest some kind of organic matter. In \"The Tomb of the Cybermen\" (1967), veins and brains were visible through the domed head of the Cyber-Controller, and similarly, in \"Attack of the Cybermen\" (1985) and \"The Age of Steel\" (2006), the Cyber-Controller's brain is visible through the dome. The first is a Mondas Cyber Controller, and the second involves alternative Earth's John Lumic. However, in \"Revenge of the Cybermen\" (1975), the Doctor says they are \"total machine creatures\".\n\nThe audio play \"Real Time\" implies that the converted victim's face remains beneath the Cyberman faceplate, although the audio plays, like all non-televised spin-off media, are of uncertain canonicity with regard to the television series. In the 2014's \"Death in Heaven\", Danny Pink removes the faceplate showing his face underneath. The Virgin New Adventures novel \"Iceberg\" by David Banks states that some Cybermen experience rare flashes of emotional memory from the time before they were converted; these flashes are then usually suppressed. The Cybermen in the revived series are usually constructed from human brains bonded to a Cyberman exoskeletal shell with an artificially-grown nervous system threaded throughout (\"The Age of Steel\"), although direct grafting of cyber-components is another method of conversion (\"Cyberwoman\"). In \"The Pandorica Opens\", a Cyberman head is shown to open up, revealing an entire human skull, not just the brain.\nAlthough the Cybermen often claim that they have done away with human emotion, they have exhibited emotions ranging from anger to smug satisfaction in their confrontations with the Doctor. Some Cybermen in the early stories were even given individual names such as \"Krang\". Some parallel Earth Cybermen did retain some memories of their pre-conversion lives, although their emotional response varied. In \"Cyberwoman\", the partial conversion led to a degree of insanity in Lisa Hallett, which was retained even after she transferred her brain into a fully human body. In \"Doomsday\", Yvonne Hartman retains at least some elements of her personality (including her voice being heard over the usual Cyberman voice) to prevent the advance of a group of other Cybermen, and is last seen weeping what appears to be either an oil-like substance or blood. In the same episode, the Cyber-Leader expresses clear frustration at the humans' refusal to surrender, although in a later scene he criticises the Doctor for showing emotion. In \"The Age of Steel\", the Doctor defeats the Cybermen by shutting down their emotional inhibitors, enabling them to \"see\" what had become of them. Their realisation of what they had become led them to either simply shut down out of sheer horror, or partially explode. Lastly, when the first Cyber Leader is killed, his head explodes with some white liquid leaking down his body; there are references in that episode to a patented Cybus Industries mixture of chemicals used to preserve the brain. In \"Death in Heaven\", Danny Pink also retains some of his personality traits, including shock at seeing his reflection and what he's become, but also his love for Clara Oswald. The Doctor turns it on to gain intelligence and reveal that the Cybermen have developed a way to cyber-convert dead human remains. Only then does the Doctor exploit Danny's keeping of his personality traits, even under the inhibitor, to command the Cyber-Army. In \"The Doctor Falls\", the Doctor's companion Bill retains her complete sense of self and identity, even to the point of not initially seeing herself as a Cyberman, as a result of her experiences resisting mind control and telepathic suggestions in a past adventure. However, Cyberman program does manifest in her bursts of anger and she says her mind cannot hold on forever.\n\nThe Virgin Missing Adventures novel \"Killing Ground\", by Steve Lyons suggests that some Cybermen imitate emotions to intimidate and unnerve their victims. The Big Finish Productions audio play \"Spare Parts\" (set on Mondas in the early days of Cyber-conversion) suggests that the Cybermen deliberately remove their emotions as part of the conversion process to stifle the physical and emotional trauma of becoming a Cyberman.\n\nThis motive behind the removal of emotions is made more explicit in \"The Age of Steel\", where it is done by an emotional inhibitor. In that episode, deactivating their emotional inhibitors causes the converted Cybermen to realise what they have become, driving them insane and killing them. \n\nThe Cybermen have had a number of weaknesses since their introduction. The most notable weakness of the original Cybermen is the element gold. Their aversion to gold was not mentioned until they try to destroy the planetoid Voga (the so-called \"Planet of Gold\") in \"Revenge of the Cybermen\" (1975). Initially, it was explained that, due to its non-corrodible nature, gold essentially chokes their respiratory systems. For example, the glittergun, a weapon used during the Cyber-Wars in the future, fired gold dust at its targets. However, in later serials, gold appeared to affect them rather as silver affects werewolves, with gold coins or gold-tipped bullets fired at them having the same effect. The revived series's Cybermen have no such weakness, though the tie-in website for the episode mentions it. Cybermen are also efficiently killed when shot with their own guns, or by a Dalek. Other weaknesses from early stories include solvents, gravity based technology, and excessive levels of radiation. In \"The Age of Steel\", an EMP grenade is shown to disable a Cyberman and shut down its emotional inhibitor. The vulnerability to gold is clearly not present in some early Cyberman types, for example the type seen in the 1968 serial \"The Invasion\" were unlikely to possess it, or perhaps more likely the weakness is not known, otherwise the Doctor/UNIT would simply have used it and not needed the elaborate plan involving the assistance of a Russian missile base and the Cybermen's puppet ally, Tobias Vaughn. In \"Nightmare in Silver\", the Doctor uses gold to slow down though not destroy some circuitry of technologically advanced Cybermen in the distant future. It is unclear precisely how many of the different types, and which types, of Cyberman are vulnerable to gold.\n\nTheir armour is often depicted as flexible and resistant to bullets, but can be penetrated by gold arrows and projectiles made of gold. The Cybus Cybermen are bullet-proof and are very resilient, but are not indestructible — they are vulnerable to high explosives, electromagnetic pulses, specialised weaponry and Dalek weapons.\n\nFor \"The Tenth Planet\", the original Cyberman costumes, including the \"handle\" shapes on their heads, were designed by Sandra Reid. The masks and one-piece bodystockings were made from jersey fabric, with holes trimmed with vinyl where the Cybermen \"eyes\" and \"mouths\" were; the actors' features were darkened to hide their faces. The fabric of the costumes were coloured a faint blue so they could show up on black and white television cameras. Over the top of the stockings, the Cybermen wore polythene suits ribbed with metal wings, along with epaulettes made of metal, and plastic piping. Their boots were short Wellington boots, painted silver. In a 2016 interview, Reid, by then going by the name Alexandra Tynan, described the motivation behind her designs was \"I had a planning meeting that I had to be at, and I had to have a design drawing with me. My motivation was the clock on the wall!\" Although the script specified the Cybermen should keep their human hands, Reid wanted them to wear gloves. However, Reid mistakenly forgot she said she would make special gloves for the Cybermen until the first day in the studio. Instead, make-up designer Gillian James hastily added silver paint to the actors' human hands. The chest units and \"handles\" were built by Shawcraft of Uxbridge. The handles were adapted from lorry headlamps, while the chest units used a lot of clear plastic and had battery-powered flashing mechanisms. The handles were intended as the housing for wires that lit up the lamps, but in a test shot the bulb exploded and the idea was dropped. Tynan explained in 2016, \"I indicated that there was going to be a chest unit there, but I didn't do any designs for them, because I knew that the units were going to be a props thing.\"\n\nProducer Innes Lloyd's production team wished to update the Cybermen for \"The Moonbase\" and make them look more sophisticated and robotic. Sandra Reid designed new costumes for this serial. These were based on a one-piece silver jumpsuit made from vinyl fabric, and the Cybermen were given gloves with three-fingered hands. Their boots were lace-up army boots painted silver. Fibreglass helmets and chest units made from aluminium were built by freelance prop makers Jack and John Lovell. Silver tape was added around the eye and mouth area for emphasis, and on Reid's instruction, the Lovells attached \"hydraulic joints\" consisting of tubing from a vacuum cleaner manufacturer and plastic practice golf balls. Costume designer Daphne Dare, consulting with Reid over the phone, took over midway through production of \"The Moonbase\" while Reid was recovering from surgery. Eight of these costumes were reused, with slight repainting and additions, for \"The Tomb of the Cybermen\", Reid's final \"Doctor Who\" serial, and a new costume was built for the Cyber Controller, with a red-domed cranium built that was intended to light up, but the lighting mechanism failed.\n\nFor the filmed inserts in \"The Wheel in Space\", Martin Baugh supervised the creation of the costumes, made from a thinner one-piece material. Junction boxes, linked by steel rods, were used at the joints and near the neck to give the impression of something more technological and functional than was seen in \"The Moonbase\" and \"The Tomb of the Cybermen\". The same chest units from before were used, with the lamp at the bottom of the unit. New helmets were cast with simpler handles that extended out further from the head. These introduced a \"teardrop\" shape to the Cybermen's eyes. An unmodified \"Tomb of the Cybermen\" suit was also used to swell the Cybermen's numbers during the spacewalk scene, and was positioned at the back to hide the difference from the other two costumes. Mid-production, the suits were redesigned again for the more extensive recordings of \"The Wheel in Space\" in the studio. Baugh's solution was to spray-paint two padded wet suits to make them look bulkier, with the helmets, junction boxes and rods from the filmed inserts modified or removed to make the actors move more freely. The hands from the earlier \"Wheel in Space\" costumes were cut off and used as gloves for the new costumes. The chest units were turned upside down so the lamps, mounted beneath the Cybermen's chins, could be fired as a weapon in a tighter shot.\n\nFor \"The Invasion\", costume designer Bobi Bartlett ordered a resculpt of the helmet moulds with more head space for the actors to be done by outside company Trading Post. This included the sculpting of two large \"ear muffs\". The helmet was made of a light fibreglass. The costumes featured army boots, and now had five-fingered gloves, rather than three. Wetsuits were reused for this serial, and a simpler and sturdier version of the chest units, with the light at the top of the unit as before, was commissioned. At each of the joints there were now domes connected by a set of ribbed rods.\n\nWhile production notes in \"Doctor Who: The Complete History\" claimed that the brief appearance of a Cyberman in \"Carnival of Monsters\" consisted of a diving suit from \"The Invasion\", Gavin Rymill in \"Doctor Who Magazine\" wrote that this Cyberman was a Cyber Controller costume from \"The Tomb of the Cybermen\". Both sources concurred that the helmet originated from \"The Invasion\", and the back of the helmet was left unfastened.\n\nPrue Handley was the costume designer on \"Revenge of the Cybermen\". The costumes were built by freelance prop company Alister Bowtell, and were again based on wet suits, with rubber tubing along the arms and at the knees and elbow. The chest unit props from \"The Moonbase\" returned, and included bits of broken television sets. New, larger fibreglass helmets were made, and the costumes had silver gloves and Wellington boots.\n\nThe \"Earthshock\" designs by Dinah Collin included a set of Mk 2C RAF flight suits with built-in pipes used to pump cool air around. The \"Revenge of the Cybermen\" head was reshaped and recut by Richard Gregory of the freelance company Imagineering to add more details. There was a transparent section in the face through where the actor's moving jaw could be seen. New chest units were made in fibreglass, and they were decorated with ammunition trays. Also worn with the costumes were padded zip-back gloves and Tecnica Moon Boots. For \"The Five Doctors\" and \"Attack of the Cybermen\", the jaw area was sprayed silver, and less ostentatious boots were worn. Anushia Nieradzik was the costume designer on \"Attack of the Cybermen\". A specially modified Cyber Controller costume with a tall silver dome on its head was made for \"Attack of the Cybermen\"; as with the Controller costume used in \"The Tomb of the Cybermen\", its helmet had no handles. For \"Silver Nemesis\", the same head and chest pieces returned with a dappled plastic jaw and the removal of the ammunition trays. A plainer type of flight suit without built-in pipes was used for the bodies, and cable junction boxes with plastic tubes were added to the limbs for more detail. The costumes had cricket gloves sprayed silver, and Dr. Martens boots.\n\nThe redesign of the Cybermen in \"Rise of the Cybermen\" and \"The Age of Steel\" was a month-long process involving nearly every part of the design team. The production team decided on an Art Deco approach, and the final design was handed to Neill Gorton's team at Millennium FX, who also built the final costumes. The head was designed to be able to be turned independently from the body; such movement had not been possible in previous helmets. Millennium's Martin Rezard was the lead sculptor of a full-sized clay Cyberman, from which moulds were taken to create over forty fibreglass pieces to make up the head and body of each costume. Powdered aluminium was added to the final layer of the fibreglass, and each component was hand polished until it gleamed. Each of the fibreglass pieces were clipped onto a basic Lycra suit assembled by Jo Glover. The gloves and neck were cast in a soft silver-tinted silicone by Helen Rowe and Alex Whathey. Ten Cyberman costumes were made, including the Cyber Controller, which had a visible brain and pipes connecting him to his life support systems. In \"A Good Man Goes to War\" the costumes no longer had the Cybus Industries \"C\" logo introduced in \"Rise of the Cybermen\".\n\nThe sleeker and more elegant design introduced in \"Nightmare in Silver\" was made by the Millennium FX team from flexible polyurethane rubber, painted to look metallic using a new process originally developed for use in the car industry.\n\nThe \"Mondasian Cybermen\" in \"World Enough and Time\" and \"The Doctor Falls\" were created by the Millennium FX team, and were an updated version of Sandra Reid's 1966 design of the Cybermen for \"The Tenth Planet\". The chest units were built by Rocky Marshall out of cardboard, plastic and \"other bits that he'd found\". The costumes themselves were built from a silver latex fabric by costume designer Robin Archer. The Cybermen's hands were covered by rubber gloves. Millennium also created the transitional \"patients\" that evolve into Cybermen from the two-parter. Despite the \"Tenth Planet\" Cybermen not having gloves, director Rachel Talalay said that the reason for adding them to the Mondasian Cybermen in the series 10 two-part finale was \"partially an issue because of skintone\" with Pearl Mackie's Cyberman, but also to \"get a scarier feel and something more artificial by putting the gloves on them\". She further explained that in \"The Tenth Planet\" it was hard to tell if they had skintone gloves or not to justify their addition.\n\nUnlike the Doctor's other foes, the Cybermen costumes have changed substantially in appearance over the years, looking more and more modern, although retaining certain commonalities of design, the most iconic being the \"handles\" attached to Cybermen heads. Other design elements include their round eyeholes and their chest units.\n\nAside from these changes, variations in design between rank-and-file Cybermen and their leaders have been seen. In \"The Wheel in Space\" and \"The Invasion\" (both 1968), the Cyber Director was depicted as an immobile mechanism. The Cyber Leader in \"The Next Doctor\" sports a transparent brain casing.\n\nBecause the Doctor is a time traveller, he meets the Cybermen at various points in their history out of sequence from the order the serials were made. This can be confusing since Cybermen from serials set in \"earlier\" periods of history can sometimes look more sophisticated than those from \"later\" periods. Lawrence Miles suggests in his reference work \"About Time 5\" that the anachronistically designed Cybermen of \"Earthshock\" and \"Silver Nemesis\" are time travellers, like those in \"Attack of the Cybermen\". The Doctor Who Role Playing Game \"Cyber Files\" worked around the contradiction by stating that in \"The Tenth Planet\", the oldest designs of Cybermen were used for the attack while the later more sophisticated models remained on Mondas.\n\nThe \"Torchwood\" episode \"Cyberwoman\" features a partially cyber-converted woman who lacks the outer plating of a fully converted Cyberman. Her body is encased in metal structures but much of her flesh, including her face, is visible. She also has clearly visible metallic breasts, though it is not clear how much of her own flesh has been replaced and how much is merely covered. Another character speculates she could be 40–45% human, and 55–60% Cyberman.\n\nEarly Cybermen had an unsettling, sing-song voice, constructed by placing the inflections of words on the wrong syllables. In their first appearance, the effect of this was augmented by having a Cyberman abruptly open his mouth wide and keep it open, without moving his tongue or lips, while the separately recorded voice would be playing, and then shut it quickly when the line was finished. Although the cloth-like masks of the first Cybermen were soon replaced by a full helmet, a similar physical effect involving the mouth \"hatch\" opening and then shutting when the line was finished was used until \"The Wheel in Space\" (1968).\n\nLater, the production team used special effects from its Radiophonic Workshop by adding first a mechanical larynx, then a vocoder, to modify speech to make it sound more artificial. In later stories of the original series and in the audio plays, two copies of the voice track were sampled and pitch-shifted downwards by differing amounts and layered to produce the effect, sometimes with the addition of a small amount of flanging. From \"Revenge of the Cybermen\" to \"Silver Nemesis\" (1988) the actors provided the voices themselves, using microphones and transmitters in the chest units.\n\nThe voices for the 2006 return of the Cybermen are similar to the buzzing electronic monotone voices of the Cybermen used in \"The Invasion\". They were provided by Nicholas Briggs. As shown in the second series of \"Doctor Who Confidential\", the timbre was created by processing Briggs' voice through a Moog moogerfooger ring modulator. Unusually, in \"The Age of Steel\", the Cyber-Controller (John Lumic, played by Roger Lloyd-Pack) retains his voice after being upgraded, but it is still electronic. In \"Doomsday\", a Cyberman which contains the brain of Torchwood Institute director Yvonne Hartman retains a female-sounding though still electronic voice, as does the partially converted Lisa Hallett in \"Cyberwoman\" when her Cyberman personality is dominant. In an effect reminiscent of the earliest Cybermen's mouths snapping open while speaking, the new Cybermen have a blue light in their \"mouths\" (or \"teeth\") which blinks in synchronisation with their speech.\n\nSince \"The Age of Steel\" in 2006, the Cybermen have had nasally-sounding electronic voices; this continued all the way until \"Closing Time\" in 2011. Following this, since the 2013 episode \"Nightmare in Silver\", the Cybermen (continuing to be voiced by Briggs) now have deep, almost growl-like voices. Their mouths retain a blue light-up effect but flicker luminously instead of staying lit as opposed to the 2006 design.\n\nSome Cybermen are given titles, being credited as \"Cyber Leader\" (or variants thereof), \"Cyber Lieutenant\", \"Cyber Scout\" or the \"Cyber Controller\".\n\nAn immobile computer, referred to as the \"Cyber Planner\", appears in \"The Wheel in Space\" and \"The Invasion\". A Cyber Planner also takes over the Eleventh Doctor's body in \"Nightmare in Silver\".\n\nThe original Controller is seen (and destroyed) in two serials, \"Tomb of the Cybermen\" and \"Attack of the Cybermen\", and in each may or may not be the same consciousness in different bodies; it appears to recognise and remember the Doctor from previous encounters. In the Virgin New Adventures novel \"Iceberg\", the first Cyber Controller is created by implanting a Cyber Director, or Cyber Planner, into the skull of a recently converted Cyberman.\n\nThe parallel universe Cyber Controller in \"The Age of Steel\" uses the brain of John Lumic, the creator of the Cybermen in that parallel reality.\n\nIn \"Doomsday\", a Cyber Leader appears, and when he is destroyed, mention is made of downloading his data files into another Cyberman unit, which is then upgraded to Cyber Leader.\n\nThe 2008 Christmas special, \"The Next Doctor\", featured a new, more agile variant called a Cybershade. The Doctor theorises that it is a more primitive version of a Cyberman, using the brain of a cat, and they physically resemble animals as they cannot speak and walk on all fours. In the same story a \"Cyber-King\" appears; according to the Doctor, it is a \"Dreadnought-class\" ship for use in invasions resembling a Cyberman hundreds of feet tall, and contains a Cyber-factory in its chest. It is controlled from within its mouth. Its right arm can be converted into a cannon, and its left into a laser.\n\n\"The Time of the Doctor\" introduced a unique prototype Cyberman that was made of wood to avoid detection by the Church of the Papal Mainframe and equipped with blowtorches.\n\nAfter Bill Potts is wounded on the bridge of a Mondasian colony ship, and taken down the ship's lifts to be surgically repaired, she encounters half converted Mondasians referred to only as 'The Patients'. They wore grey surgical robes and their faces were entirely covered with cloth bags, save for a nasal canulla that administered fluids and all were hooked up to IV drips. Most remained stationary; confined to wheelchairs in the \"out ward\" while some walked the hospital grounds; being prepped for additional surgery and rounding up humans in the city and leading them to the hospital. During the early stages of these experiments (a precursor to cyber-conversion), The Patients were shown to feel the pain caused by this process, with some even begging for death, twisting in their chairs and jabbing at their speech keyboards. They were capable of attacking, following commands (such as restraining Bill) and possessed great strength. They could be incapacitated, though not killed by gunfire\nCybermen technology is almost completely oriented towards weaponry, apart from their own bodies. When originally seen in \"The Tenth Planet\", they had large energy weapons that attached to their chests. In \"The Moonbase\", the Cybermen had two types of weaponry: an electrical discharge from their hands, which stunned the target, and a type of gun. They also made use of a large laser cannon with which they attempted to attack the base itself.\n\nThe hand discharge was also present in \"The Tomb of the Cybermen\", which featured a smaller, hand-held Cyber-weapon shaped like a pistol that was described as an X-ray laser. In \"The Wheel in Space\", the Cybermen could use the discharge to also operate machinery, and had death rays built into their chest units. They displayed the same units in \"The Invasion\" as well as carrying large rifles for medium distance combat. In \"Revenge of the Cybermen\" and the audio play \"Real Time\", their weapons were built into their helmets. \"Killing Ground\" indicates that this type of Cybermen also have more powerful hand weapons. Subsequent appearances have shown them armed almost exclusively with hand-held cyberguns.\n\nThe Cybermen have access to weapons of mass destruction known as cobalt bombs, also sometimes as Cyber-bombs, which were banned by the galactic Armageddon Convention (\"Revenge of the Cybermen\"). A \"Cyber-megatron bomb\" was mentioned in \"The Invasion\", supposedly powerful enough to destroy all life on Earth. In \"Earthshock\", the Cybermen also used android drones as part of their plans to invade Earth.\n\nThe revived programme Cybermen electrocute their victims by touching them and at first carried no other weaponry. In \"Army of Ghosts\" and \"Doomsday\", the Cybermen are equipped with retractable energy weapons housed within their forearms (these were actually first shown in \"The Age of Steel\", but only very briefly and were not used during that episode), but also use advanced human weapons to battle the Daleks. The arm mounted guns prove effective against humans but are unable to penetrate Dalek shields. Two Cybermen sent to parley with Dalek Thay at the Battle of Canary Wharf shot the Dalek but were promptly exterminated. In the \"Torchwood\" episode \"Cyberwoman\", the partially converted Lisa Hallett used her electrical touch against the Torchwood team, as well as an energy beam fired from her arm which could only stun the part of the body at which it was aimed. In \"The Pandorica Opens\", the Cybermen again have the wrist-blaster, but also regain the modified human weapons. In \"Nightmare in Silver\", the Cybermen have the ability to move at a warp-like speed. At this speed they appear as blurry after images. Cyberman had also overcome the weakness of solely being able to convert human-like species; the Doctor had been safe from being in danger of conversion until this point.\n\nThe Mondasian Cybermen from The Tenth Planet were updated for the Series 10 Finale. As opposed to shooting from their chest pieces they used their lanterns as weapons. This was in the Novelisation for The Tenth Planet. They also had the ability to emit electricity.\n\nThe Cybermen also use smaller, cybernetic creatures called \"cybermats\" as weapons of attack. In their first appearance in \"The Tomb of the Cybermen\", they resembled oversized metallic silverfish and had segmented bodies with hair-like tactile sensor probes along the base of their heads, which were topped with crystalline eyes. The Second Doctor described them as a \"form of metallic life,\" implying that they may be semi-organic like the Cybermen, and that they too attack by feeding off brain waves.\n\nThe second model of Cybermat seen in \"The Wheel in Space\" was used for sabotage, able to tune in on human brainwaves. They were carried to the \"Wheel\" in small but high-density sacs that sank through the hull of the space station, causing drops in air pressure. These Cybermats had solid photoreceptors for eyes instead of crystals. The Second Doctor used an audio frequency to jam them, causing them to spin, crash and disintegrate.\n\nThe third model, seen in \"Revenge of the Cybermen\", was a much larger, snake-like cybermat that could be remotely controlled and could inject poison into its victims. It had no visible eyes or other features, and was as vulnerable to gold dust as the Cybermen were.\n\nThe original model was later mentioned in a conversation between the Doctor and his double during \"The Rebel Flesh\", reaffirming that that model of Cybermat killed by feeding on brainwaves.\n\nThe fourth model of cybermat appears for the first time in the revived series in the 2011 episode \"Closing Time\", where it is shown to have an organic mouth full of sharp teeth, and transmits power to a crashed cyber-ship.\n\nIn the audio play \"Spare Parts\", \"mats\" are cybernetically augmented creatures, sometimes kept as pets. Cybermats of a different design are used for surveillance by Mondas' Central Committee. The creatures occasionally go wild, chewing on power sources, and must be rounded up by a \"mat-catcher.\" In the Past Doctor Adventures novel \"Illegal Alien\" by Mike Tucker and Robert Perry, set in the 1940s, the Cybermen create cybermats by cyber-converting local animals like cats or birds, possibly because of lack of technological resources.\n\nIn the Bernice Summerfield audio adventure \"The Crystal of Cantus\", a Cyberman reveals that the organs of children who are too small to be fully cyber-converted are used in the creation of cybermats.\n\nThe cybermats appeared in the video game \"Blood of the Cybermen\" where instead of killing, they turned individuals into cyberslaves. The slaves have mostly human bodies, but have Cyberman heads and arms. The Cybermen see the cyberslaves as inferior, and delete them once they have served their purpose.\n\nAn upgraded form of cybermats appeared in \"Nightmare in Silver\". They were incredibly small mechanical insects that were more versatile and were able to partially convert other lifeforms into Cybermen. They were referred to as cybermites.\n\n\n<br>\n\n"}

{"id": "5247268", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5247268", "title": "Dracorex", "text": "Dracorex\n\nDracorex is a controversial dinosaur genus of the family Pachycephalosauridae, from the Late Cretaceous of North America. The type (and only known) species is \"Dracorex hogwartsia\", meaning \"dragon king of Hogwarts\". This dinosaur is named for the wizard school in the \"Harry Potter\" books. It is known from one nearly complete skull (the holotype TCMI 2004.17.1), as well as four cervical vertebrae: the atlas, third, eighth and ninth. These were discovered in the Hell Creek Formation in South Dakota by three amateur paleontologists from Sioux City, in the U.S. state of Iowa. The skull was subsequently donated to the Children's Museum of Indianapolis for study in 2004, and was formally described by Bob Bakker and Robert Sullivan in 2006. However, Jack Horner \"et al.\" suspect that it is a juvenile \"Pachycephalosaurus\" and an analysis of pachycephalosaur fossils by a joint team from the University of California, Berkeley and the Museum of the Rockies has questioned the validity of two named genera of pachycephalosaur, \"Dracorex\" and \"Stygimoloch\". According to the team, specimens of \"Dracorex\" and \"Stygimoloch\" might actually represent earlier growth stages of \"Pachycephalosaurus\". This has been supported in a 2016 analysis of the youngest \"Pachycephalosaurus\" material known, which indicates that the unique features of \"Dracorex\" represent instead ontogenetically variant features on a \"Pachycephalosaurus\" growth curve.\n\n\"Dracorex\", a herbivore, had a skull with spiky horns, bumps, and a long muzzle. The species also sports well-developed supratemporal fenestrae and a heavily armored flat skull—lacking the characteristic pachycephalosaurid dome. Coupled with these two features is the excessive number of osteoderms in the form of irregular osteodermal crust: a number of nodes, larger hornlets, and spikes. Disregarding this, \"Dracorex\" is physically comparable to \"Stygimoloch\".\n\nIn the Pachycephalosauridae, the Asian taxa include a number of (somewhat) flat-headed pachycephalosaurs (\"Homalocephale calathocercos\", \"Goyocephale lattimorei\", and \"Wannanosaurus yansiensis\"). However, prior to the discovery of \"Dracorex\", the only semi-flat-headed pachycephalosaur from North America was \"Stegoceras validum\" (inclusive of \"Ornatotholus browni\"). Even then, the semi-flat-headed trait was only present in juveniles of the species.\n\nAside from having a flat, nodal skull, the most prominent feature of \"Dracorex\" is the pair of huge and unrestricted superior temporal openings. The supratemporal fenestrae are much larger front-to-back and side-to-side than in \"Homalocephale\", and larger than in \"Goyocephale\". Only a fragmentary \"Wannanosaurus\" skull shows fenestrae as large as those of \"Dracorex\". This fenestral architecture has been seen in ancient archosaurs, but not in other pachycephalosaurs.\n\nConsequently, if unreduced superior fenestrae are morphologically primitive, then \"Dracorex\" is more primitive in the temporal region than any other known pachycephalosaur. However, Sullivan (2003, 2006) demonstrated that the oldest-known pachycephalosaurs were, in fact, fully domed, and that the flat-headed morphology appeared later in the fossil record. This suggests that doming may be primitive for pachycephalosaurs and that a reversion to the non-domed, flat-headed state is a secondary (derived) character reversion, coupled with the re-opening of the supratemporal fenestrae. Indeed, while \"Stegoceras\" has been considered to be transitional between domed and flat-headed taxa, it may indicate the beginning of a character reversion to suppression of doming and opening of the supratemporal fenestrae in some taxa.\n\nThe excavated specimen was most likely a young adult. However, based on the beginning of ossification of the mid-cervical arch with the centrum, it was near maturity. It was about long.\n\n\"Dracorex\" may actually be an individual of the closely related \"Stygimoloch\" and/or \"Pachycephalosaurus\" in which the dome and horns are not well-developed, either because the animal was a juvenile or a female. This consideration was supported at the 2007 annual meeting of the Society of Vertebrate Paleontology. Jack Horner of Montana State University presented evidence, from analysis of the skull of the single existing \"Dracorex\" specimen, that this dinosaur may well be a juvenile form of \"Stygimoloch\". In addition, he presented data that indicates that both \"Stygimoloch\" and \"Dracorex\" may be juvenile forms of \"Pachycephalosaurus\". Horner and M.B. Goodwin published their findings in 2009, showing that the spike/node and skull dome bones of all three 'species' exhibit extreme plasticity, and that both \"Dracorex\" and \"Stygimoloch\" are known only from juvenile specimens, while \"Pachycephalosaurus\" is known only from adult specimens. These observations, in addition to the fact that all three forms lived in the same time and place, lead them to conclude that \"Dracorex\" and \"Stygimoloch\" may have simply been juvenile \"Pachycephalosaurs\" that had lost their spikes and grew domes as they aged. The researchers were unable to destructively sample the \"Dracorex\" skull, and had to use a cast of the skull for descriptive purposes. A 2010 study by Nick Longrich and colleagues also supported the hypothesis that all flat-skulled pachycephalosaurs were juveniles, suggesting that flat-skulled forms, like \"Goyocephale\" and \"Homalocephale\", represent juveniles of dome-skulled adults.\n\nIn 2016, Goodwin and Evans analyzed the youngest-known ontogimorphs of \"Pachycephalosaurus\", collected from the Hell Creek Formation. While this material would normally be referred to \"Dracorex\", as it represented one or more individuals younger than the only known \"Dracorex\" individual and displayed similar features, the elements showed that the unique characters in \"Dracorex\" and \"Stygimoloch\" represent instead consistent morphological characters on a morphological continuum for \"Pachycephalosaurus\". In other words, this younger individual(s) displayed that the features of Dracorex were most likely transient, and can be plotted easily on a growth curve for \"Pachycephalosaurus\", where \"Stygimoloch\" and \"Dracorex\" are incorporated within this genus. As such, \"Dracorex\" likely is not a unique species, but instead a junior synonym of \"Pachycephalosaurus\".\n\nThe name \"Dracorex hogwartsia\" was inspired by young visitors to the Children's Museum of Indianapolis as a tribute to both dragons (\"Dracorex\" means \"dragon king\"), which the animal resembled, as well as the \"Harry Potter\" series of books by J. K. Rowling (\"hogwartsia\" for the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, the fictional school from the popular series). The writer declared:\n\n\n"}

Guy the Gorilla was one of London Zoo's best-loved animals. The exact day of Guy's birth was never known, but the official birthday was set by the Zoo as May 30, and he received large numbers of cards every year.\n\nGuy arrived at the zoo on 5 November 1947, Guy Fawkes Night, hence his name. He was a tiny baby, weighing just 23 lb (10 kg) and holding a small tin hot-water bottle. Guy was the replacement for the zoo's previous gorilla, Meng, who had died in 1941. Guy was captured in the French Cameroons on behalf of Paris Zoo and was traded for a tiger from Calcutta Zoo. It was arranged that London Zoo would have Guy. The Paris Zoo Director sent instructions to their game department in West Africa to find a suitable female to mate with him.\n\nLondon sent a request to a variety of animal dealers and zoos worldwide to find a mate, and in 1969 the zoo was offered Lomie, a five-year-old female who had been living in nearby Chessington Zoo. She then lived for a year in the old Monkey House in London Zoo before being introduced to Guy. When the new Ape and Monkey House, the Michael Sobell Pavilion, was opened in 1971, Guy and Lomie were finally introduced. However, after 25 years of isolation, it was too late; they never produced any offspring.\n\nLowland gorillas are the world's largest primates. Males can weigh between 140 and 275 kg. Guy's dimensions as silverback were measured in 1966 and 1971: he weighed 520 lb (240 kg), was 5 ft 4 in (1.63 m) tall, and had an arm span of 9 ft (2.7 m). His upper arm had a circumference of 23.5 in (58 cm), his thighs 28 in (70 cm), and his neck 36 in (90 cm).\n\nHis appearance was fearsome, yet his nature was very gentle; when small birds flew into his cage, he was often seen to lift them on his hands and examine them softly. This gentleness is said to have been a major part of his great popularity.\n\nGuy died aged 31 or 32, in 1978 of a heart attack during an operation on his infected teeth. His tooth decay had been caused by the fact that visitors were allowed to feed him sweets. By this time he had become an icon. Public awareness of animal behaviour had been growing, thanks to the ever-improving natural history programmes on television, while studies of wild apes by scientists like Jane Goodall, Biruté Galdikas and Dian Fossey were changing the public's attitude towards primates.\n\nDuring pre-production for the film \"\" (1968), Dan Richter — who played the lead ape-man (\"Moonwatcher\") in the film — studied Guy intently and modelled his acting and mime performance partly on Guy's behaviour.\n\n\n"}

After his PhD (Dr.-Ing.) in 1970, he wrote his Habilitation thesis in Philosophy und Sociology at Karlsruhe University 1978 under the supervision of Hans Lenk. His work dealt with the systems theory of \"Technik\" (engl. \"technique\"), leading to the concept of general technology. \nIn 1979, Ropohl became Professor at the Universität Karlsruhe (TH). Soon after, in 1981, he became Professor for Allgemeine Technologie (general technology) and philosophy of technology at the Johann Wolfgang Goethe-Universität in Frankfurt am Main, Germany (until 2004). In the 1980s, he visited his colleague and friend Carl Mitcham in the United States. From 1983 to 1991, i.e. during the period of the Cold War, he was course director and visiting lecturer at the Inter-University Centre Dubrovnik (Croatia). In 1988, he was invited as visiting professor at the Rochester Institute of Technology, Rochester NY.\nRopohl was an honorary member of the German Engineering Association (VDI), due to his interdisciplinary engagement for the philosophy of technology.

{"id": "20933351", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20933351", "title": "Hybrid inviability", "text": "Hybrid inviability\n\nHybrid inviability is a post-zygotic barrier, which reduces a hybrid's capacity to mature into a healthy, fit adult. The relatively low health of these hybrids relative to pure-breed individuals prevents gene flow between species. Thus, hybrid inviability acts as an isolating mechanism, limiting hybridization and allowing for the differentiation of species.\nThe barrier of hybrid inviability occurs after mating species overcome pre-zygotic barriers (behavioral, mechanical, etc.) to produce a zygote. The barrier emerges from the cumulative effect of parental genes; these conflicting genes interfere with the embryo's development and prevents its maturation. Most often, the hybrid embryo dies before birth. However, sometimes, the offspring develops fully with mixed traits, forming a frail, often infertile adult. This hybrid displays reduced fitness, marked by decreased rates of survival and reproduction relative to the parent species. The offspring fails to compete with purebred individuals, limiting genes flow between species.\n\nIn the 1970s, Allan C. Wilson and his colleagues first investigated the evolution of hybrid inviability in tetrapods, specifically mammals, birds, and frogs.\nRecognizing that hybrid viability decreases with time, the researchers used molecular clocks to quantify divergence time. They identified how long ago the common ancestor of hybridizing species diverged into two lines, and found that bird and frog species can produce viable hybrids up to twenty million years after speciation. In addition, the researchers showed that mammal species can only produce viable hybrids up to two or three million years after speciation.\n\nWilson et al. (1974) proposes two hypotheses to explain the relatively faster evolution of hybrid inviability in mammals: the Regulatory and the Immunological Hypotheses. Subsequent research finds support for these hypotheses.\n\nThe Regulatory Hypothesis accounts for two characteristics of mammals, and explains the general formation of hybrid inviability in mammals, birds, and frogs.\n\nFirst, mammals display relatively lower protein diversity than frogs. As Wilson et al. (1974) suggests, “mammals that can hybridize with each other differ only slightly at the protein level, whereas frogs that differ substantially in protein sequence hybridize readily.” This analysis suggests that gene divergence is not the only determinate of hybridization in mammals, birds, or frogs.\nSecond, the evolution of anatomical diversity occurred far faster in mammals than in either birds or frogs. As Fitzpatrick (2004) indicates, “the morphological disparities among bats, mole-rats, and whales are more dramatic than any disparities in birds and frogs.” This anatomical diversity is evidence for the diversification of regulatory systems. This mammalian characteristic suggests that, although mammals are genetically similar, dramatic changes in regulatory genes caused distinct developmental differences.\n\nThe Regulatory Hypotheses specifically attributes hybrid inviability in mammals, birds, and frogs to differences in gene regulation. It proposes that hybrid inviability evolved faster in mammalian taxa because mammals have accumulated significantly more changes in regulatory systems than birds or frogs, and it suggests that organisms with distinctly different systems of gene regulation may not produce viable hybrids.\n\nWilson et al. (1974) recognizes that the development of embryos in the mammalian placenta requires regulatory compatibility. Both the regulatory genes of the sperm and egg contribute to the expression of other protein-coding genes in the zygote; if certain regulatory genes are not expressed or are expressed at the wrong time, the inter-specific zygote will abort or develop unhealthy traits. Moreover, because the development of the zygote depends on maternal characteristics, such as cytoplasmic determinants, the regulatory traits of the mother may not support the hybrid's developmental needs. \n\nThe Immunological Hypothesis proposes that the divergence of certain protein structures associated with mother and child causes hybrid inviability. The hypothesis applies only to mammals, where fertilization and development is internal. In birds and in frogs, fertilization is primarily external, and the mother’s immune system does not interfere with fetal development. \n\nThis hypothesis stems from the immunological characteristics of the placenta, where the growing fetus is in constant contact with the fluids and tissues of the mother. Variation within species and variation between species may contribute to fetal-maternal incompatibility, and according to the hypothesis, if the proteins of the fetus varies significantly from the proteins of the placenta, the mother may produce anti-bodies that will attack and abort the fetus. Therefore, if the fetal proteins of the father species are incompatible the mother's placental proteins, the mother's immune system may abort the embryo.\nEvidence for the Immunological Hypothesis varies considerably. Wilson et al. (1974) recognizes studies that provide no support to the Immunological Hypotheses. In these experiments, the use of immunological suppressants provided no additional viability to inter-specific hybrids. In contrast, Elliot and Crespi (2006) documents the effects of placental immunology on hybrid inviability, showing that mammals with hemochorial placentas more readily hybridize than mammals with epitheliochorial or endotheliochorial placentas. These different placenta types possess divergent immunological systems, and consequently, they cause varying degrees of hybrid inviability.\n"}

Practically, all information related to the research is public. Only documents that comprise information related to financial data or information that could negatively influence the competitiveness and law enforcement capabilities of parties involved in the project are not published. This follows regulations and practices applied in EU research projects.\n\nThe main end-user of INDECT solutions are police forces and security services.\n\nThe principle of operation of the project is detecting threats and identifying source of threats, without monitoring and searching for particular citizens or groups of citizens. Then, the system operator (i.e. police officer) decides whether an intervention of services responsible for public security are required or not. Further investigation eventually leading to persons related to threats are performed, preserving the presumption of innocence, on the basis of existing procedures already used by police services and prosecutors.

{"id": "42946330", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=42946330", "title": "Interpersonal theory of suicide", "text": "Interpersonal theory of suicide\n\nThe interpersonal theory of suicide attempts to explain why individuals engage in suicidal behavior and to identify individuals who are at risk. It was developed by Thomas Joiner and is outlined in \"Why People Die By Suicide\". The theory consists of three components that together lead to suicide attempts. According to the theory, the simultaneous presence of thwarted belongingness and perceived burdensomeness produce the desire for suicide. While the desire for suicide is necessary, it alone will not result in death by suicide. Rather, Joiner asserts that one must also have acquired capability (that is, the acquired ability to overcome one's natural fear of death).\n\nA number of risk factors have been linked to suicidal behavior, and there are many theories of suicide that integrate these established risk factors, but few are capable of explaining all of the phenomena associated with suicidal behavior as the interpersonal theory of suicide does. Another strength of this theory lies in its ability to be tested empirically. It is constructed in a way that allows for falsifiability. A number of studies have found at least partial support for the interpersonal theory of suicide. Specifically, a systematic review of 66 studies using the interpersonal theory of suicide found that the effect of perceived burdensomeness on suicide ideation was the most tested and supported relationship. The theory’s other predictions, particularly in terms of critical interaction effects, are less strongly supported.\n\nBelongingness—feeling accepted by others—is believed to be a fundamental need, something that is essential for an individual's psychological health and well-being. Increased social connectedness—a construct related to belongingness—has been shown to lower risk for suicide. More specifically, being married, having children, and having more friends are associated with a lower risk of suicidal behavior. Additionally, \"pulling together\" (e.g., gathering for sporting events, celebrations) with others has been shown to have a preventive effect. For example, suicide rates have been lower on Super Bowl Sundays than other Sundays, and it is believed that the social connectedness that occurs from being a fan of a sport's team increases one's feeling of belongingness. In contrast, social isolation is frequently reported by those who die by suicide prior to death.\n\nPerceived burdensomeness is the belief that one is a burden on others or society. Joiner describes perceived burdensomeness as the belief that \"my death is worth more than my life\". Unemployment, medical or health problems, and incarceration are examples of situations in which a person may feel like they are a burden to others. It is important to note that the burdensomeness is \"perceived\", and is often a false belief. According to the theory, thwarted belongingness and perceived burdensomeness together constitute the desire for suicide.\n\nJoiner terms this \"acquired\" capability because it is not an ability with which humans are born. Rather, this ability to engage in suicidal behaviors is only acquired through life experiences. Fear of death is a natural and powerful instinct. According to the theory, one's fear of death is weakened when one is exposed to physical pain or provocative life experiences as these experiences often lead to fearlessness and pain insensitivity. These experiences could include childhood trauma, witnessing a traumatic event, suffering from a severe illness, or engaging in self-harm behaviors.\n\nThese behaviors are thought to result in the desensitization to painful stimuli and to increase one's ability to engage in suicidal behaviors. This component is important in identifying individuals who are likely to attempt or die by suicide. For example, certain professions (e.g., soldiers, surgeons, and police officers) are exposed to physical pain or provocative experiences. More specifically, soldiers with a history of combat have likely been exposed to grave injuries, witnessing the death of others, and are habituated to fear of painful experiences. This is consistent with data indicating an increased rate of suicide in soldiers. Additionally, past attempts of suicide has been found to be the number one predictor of future attempts. This is consistent with Joiner's theory; individuals who attempt suicide will habituate to the fear of death, and this weakened fear will make an individual more likely to make a subsequent attempt.\n\nA survey study of a large population-based cohort provides support for the interpersonal theory in that the interaction between thwarted belongingness and perceived burdensomeness predicted suicidal ideation, and suicidal ideation and ability predicted plans to attempt suicide and actual attempts.\n\nThe interpersonal theory of suicide identifies factors clinicians should assess for increased suicide risk and factors that should be targeted in prevention and treatment. Furthermore, the theory provides avenues of future research for scientists.\n"}

{"id": "4265777", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4265777", "title": "John Brown (British Army soldier)", "text": "John Brown (British Army soldier)\n\nJohn Henry Owen \"Busty\" Brown DCM (died 1964) was a Quartermaster Sergeant in the Royal Artillery in the British Army, who served in France at the beginning of the Second World War. He was one of Britain's most successful espionage agents as a prisoner of war following his capture by German forces, and, following the war's conclusion, acted as a prosecution witness in trials for treason.\n\nBefore he left England he had been sent on a special course for spies operating in enemy hands. He was told that he would be of more use as a POW than as a combat soldier.\n\nHe was captured at Dunkirk on 29 May 1940 and remained a prisoner of war until 1945. He volunteered to serve at the Blechhammer POW camp in Upper Silesia, and the fact that he had been a member of the British Union of Fascists before the war helped him ingratiate himself with the Germans and strike up a relationship with the camp commandant.\n\nIn the summer of 1942 a special camp was established to separate potential collaborators from other British POWs, Stalag III-D near Berlin. This in turn was divided into Special Detachment 999 (an officers' camp) and Special Detachment 517 (for other ranks). Both were presented by the Germans as \"holiday camps\" away from the poor rations, hard work and cold of normal camps, but the camp security was run by the Abwehr.\n\nBrown was one of the prisoners sent to Freigegeben (Open Prison) Stalag III-D for an initial examination. A former member of the British Union of Fascists, he had developed a good relationship with the Germans, which he exploited to run a very efficient blackmarket operation among the conscripted foreign workers, using some of the profits to buy \"luxury\" items such as extra food, medicine for the camp hospital and even musical instruments for the camp band. Brown also had a hidden radio so was aware of the course of the war.\n\nAt Stalag III-D Brown quickly realised something was wrong, and after his visit he returned to Blechhammer. There he had met Captain Julius Green, a Jewish-Glaswegian officer who was the camp's dentist. Green gave Brown the codes and the means to pass intelligence back to London through MI9's Escape and Evasion Network.\n\nBrown decided to return to Stalag III-D as soon as possible; not only were the conditions better, he was suspicious of what the Germans were planning. After a carefully orchestrated row with the senior British NCOs at Blechhammer he persuaded the Commandant, Rittmeister Prinz Von Hohenlohe, to transfer him back to Stalag III-D. He arrived on 12 June 1943 where he was selected by Major Heimpel of the Gestapo to be senior British NCO of Special Detachment 517 based at Genshagen, in the Teltow-Fläming district of Berlin.\n\nThroughout all this time, while being distrusted by the British P.O.W.s, he was reporting to MI6 by coded letters, giving guidance on targets for bomber attacks. More particularly he was engaged in subverting the German proposal to form a British Free Corps to fight for Germany. His cohorts included opera singer Margery Booth, a fellow British spy, who on one occasion whilst entertaining the camp inmates sang before Hitler just after Brown had hidden secret documents in her dress; Hitler subsequently sent her red roses wrapped in a Swastika flag. Brown was instrumental in identifying the British traitor John Amery, and both Brown and Booth had contact with William Joyce (Lord Haw-Haw), and were recruited by Joyce as a broadcaster on the German Concordia radio service; both later identified him post war, and were witnesses at his trial.\n\nAt one point Brown was confronted by Major Heimpel with a statement from a traitor giving details of Brown's espionage activities, but Brown blamed it on some of the Jewish inmates, saying they were out to destroy the idea of a British Free Corps. The Germans believed him, but Heimpel still believed that he was a secret agent, and when the British Free Corps were disbanded Himmler ordered Brown's arrest.\n\nAs the Allied forces entered Germany, Brown and a friend managed to kill an SS Colonel, steal his car and make contact with US Army forces. However, once back with British forces he found himself facing a charge of aiding the enemy. Word of his secret work for the Allies soon came from London, and he was awarded the Distinguished Conduct Medal in recognition of his achievements. After the war he was the chief prosecution witness at 20 treason trials.\n\nHe wrote of his wartime exploits in a book, \"In Durance Vile\" (Hale 1981), concluding \"...I was only able to do what I did because of my Christian belief which sustained me in my durance vile through not only the danger, but the hopeless dreariness of prisoner-of-war life\". \n\nBrown's story is recounted from the perspective of Reg Beattie, one of the members of his team, in the book about Reg's POW diary entitled \"Captive Plans\".\n\nAfter working as a businessman in Newcastle, he moved to Dorset, where he died in 1964.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "316400", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=316400", "title": "Judas Maccabeus", "text": "Judas Maccabeus\n\nJudah Maccabee (or Judas Maccabeus, also spelled Machabeus, or Maccabaeus, Hebrew: יהודה המכבי, \"Yehudah ha-Makabi\") was a Jewish priest (\"kohen\") and a son of the priest Mattathias. He led the Maccabean Revolt against the Seleucid Empire (167–160 BCE).\n\nThe Jewish holiday of Hanukkah (\"Dedication\") commemorates the restoration of Jewish worship at the temple in Jerusalem in 164 BCE, after Judah Maccabeus removed all of the statues depicting Greek gods and goddesses and purified it. \n\nJudah was the third son of Mattathias the Hasmonean, a Jewish priest from the village of Modiin. In 167 BCE Mattathias, together with his sons Judah, Eleazar, Simon, John, and Jonathan, started a revolt against the Seleucid ruler Antiochus IV Epiphanes, who since 175 BCE had issued decrees that forbade Jewish religious practices. After Mattathias's death in 166 BCE, Judah assumed leadership of the revolt in accordance with the deathbed disposition of his father. The First Book of Maccabees praises Judah's valor and military talent, suggesting that those qualities made Judah a natural choice for the new commander.\n\nIn the early days of the rebellion, Judah received a surname Maccabee. Several explanations have been put forward for this surname. One suggestion is that the name derives from the Aramaic \"maqqaba\" (\"makebet\" in modern Hebrew), \"hammer\" or \"sledgehammer\" (cf. the cognomen of Charles Martel, the 8th century Frankish leader), in recognition of his ferocity in battle. Others believe it is in reference to his weapon of choice. \n\nIt is also possible that the name Maccabee is an acronym for the Torah verse \"Mi kamokha ba'elim Adonai\", \"Who among the gods is like you, O Adonai?\", his battle-cry to motivate troops. (Exodus 15:11). Rabbi Moshe Schreiber writes that it is an acronym for his father's name Mattityahu Kohen Ben Yochanan. Some scholars maintain that the name is a shortened form of the Hebrew \"maqqab-ya ¯hû\" (from \"na ¯qab\", ‘‘to\nmark, to designate’’), meaning ‘‘the one designated by Yahweh.’\n\nMindful of the superiority of Seleucid forces during the first two years of the revolt, Judah's strategy was to avoid any engagement with their regular army, and to resort to guerrilla warfare, in order to give them a feeling of insecurity. The strategy enabled Judah to win a string of victories. At the battle of Nahal el-Haramiah (wadi haramia), he defeated a small Seleucid force under the command of Apollonius, governor of Samaria, who was killed. Judah took possession of Apollonius's sword and used it until his death as a symbol of vengeance. After Nahal el-Haramiah, recruits flocked to the Jewish cause.\n\nShortly thereafter, Judah routed a larger Seleucid army under the command of Seron near Beth-Horon, largely thanks to a good choice of battlefield. Then in the Battle of Emmaus, Judah proceeded to defeat the Seleucid forces led by generals Nicanor and Gorgias. This force was dispatched by Lysias, whom Antiochus left as viceroy after departing on a campaign against the Parthians. By a forced night march, Judah succeeded in eluding Gorgias, who had intended to attack and destroy the Jewish forces in their camp with his cavalry. While Gorgias was searching for him in the mountains, Judah made a surprise attack upon the Seleucid camp and defeated the Seleucids at the Battle of Emmaus. The Seleucid commander had no alternative but to withdraw to the coast.\n\nThe defeat at Emmaus convinced Lysias that he must prepare for a serious and prolonged war. He accordingly assembled a new and larger army and marched with it on Judea from the south via Idumea. After several years of conflict Judah drove out his foes from Jerusalem, except for the garrison in the citadel of Acra. He purified the defiled Temple of Jerusalem and on the 25th of Kislev (December 14, 164 BCE) restored the service in the Temple. The reconsecration of the Temple became a permanent Jewish holiday, Hanukkah, which continued even after the Temple was destroyed in 70 CE. Hanukkah is still celebrated annually. The liberation of Jerusalem was the first step on the road to ultimate independence.\n\nUpon hearing the news that the Jewish communities in Gilead, Transjordan, and Galilee were under attack by neighboring Greek cities, Judah immediately went to their aid. Judah sent his brother, Simeon, to Galilee at the head of 3,000 men; Simeon proceeded to successfully fulfill his task, achieving numerous victories and transplanted a substantial portion of the Jewish settlements, including women and children, to Judea. Judah personally led the campaign in Transjordan, taking with him his brother Jonathan. After fierce fighting, he defeated the Transjordanian tribes and rescued the Jews concentrated in fortified towns in Gilead. The Jewish population of the areas taken by the Maccabees was evacuated to Judea. At the conclusion of the fighting in Transjordan, Judah turned against the Edomites in the south, captured and destroyed Hebron and Maresha. He then marched on the coast of the Mediterranean, destroyed the altars and statues of the pagan gods in Ashdod, and returned to Judea with much spoils.\n\nJudah then laid siege to the Seleucid garrison at the Acra, the Seleucid citadel of Jerusalem. The besieged, who included not only Syrian-Greek troops but also Hellenistic Jews, appealed for help to Lysias, who effectively became the regent of the young king Antiochus V Eupator after the death of Antiochus Epiphanes at the end of 164 BCE during the Parthian campaign. Lysias together with Eupator set out for a new campaign in Judea. Lysias skirted Judea as he had done in his first campaign, entering it from the south, and besieged Beth-Zur. Judah raised the siege of the Acra and went to meet Lysias. In the Battle of Beth-zechariah, south of Bethlehem, the Seleucids achieved their first major victory over the Maccabees, and Judah was forced to withdraw to Jerusalem. Beth-Zur was compelled to surrender and Lysias reached Jerusalem, laying siege to the city. The defenders found themselves in a precarious situation because their provisions were exhausted, it being a sabbatical year during which the fields were left uncultivated. However, just as capitulation seemed imminent, Lysias and Eupator had to withdraw when Antiochus Epiphanes's commander-in-chief Philip, whom the late ruler appointed regent before his death, rebelled against Lysias and was about to enter Antioch and seize power. Lysias decided to propose a peaceful settlement, which was concluded at the end of 163 BCE. The terms of peace were based on the restoration of religious freedom, the permission for the Jews to live in accordance with their own laws, and the official return of the Temple to the Jews. Lysias defeated Philip, only to be overthrown by Demetrius, son of the late Seleucus IV Philopator; returned from years as a hostage in Rome. Demetrius appointed Alcimus (Jakim), a Hellenist Jew, as high priest, a choice the Hasidim (Pietists) might have accepted since he was of priestly descent.\n\nWhen war against the external enemy came to an end, an internal struggle broke out between the party led by Judah and the Hellenist party. The influence of the Hellenizers all but collapsed in the wake of the Seleucid defeat. The Hellenizing High Priest Menelaus was removed from office and executed. His successor was another Hellenizer Alcimus. When Alcimus executed sixty priests who were opposed to him, he found himself in open conflict with the Maccabees. Alcimus fled from Jerusalem and went to the Seleucid king, asking for help.\n\nMeanwhile, Demetrius I Soter, son of Seleucus IV Philopator and nephew of the late Antiochus IV Epiphanes, fled from Rome in defiance of the Roman Senate, arrived in Syria. Declaring himself the rightful king, he captured and killed Lysias and Antiochus Eupator, taking the throne. It was thus Demetrius to whom the delegation led by Alcimus, complained of the persecution of the Hellenist party in Judea. Demetrius granted Alcimus's request to be appointed High Priest under the protection of the king's army and sent to Judea an army led by Bacchides. The weaker Jewish army couldn't oppose the enemy and withdrew from Jerusalem, so Judah returned to wage guerrilla warfare. Soon after, it was necessary for the Seleucid Army to return to Antioch because of the turbulent political situation. Judah's forces returned to Jerusalem and the Seleucids dispatched another army, again led by Nicanor. In a battle near Adasa, on the 13th Adar 161 BCE, the Seleucid army was destroyed and Nicanor was killed. The annual \"Day of Nicanor\" was instituted to commemorate this victory.\n\nThe Roman-Jewish Treaty was an agreement made between Judah Maccabee and the Roman Republic in 161 BCE according to and Josephus. It was the first recorded contract between the Jewish people and the Romans.\n\nThe agreement with Rome failed to have any effect on Demetrius' policy. On receipt of the news of Nicanor's defeat, he dispatched a new army, again commanded by Bacchides. This time the Seleucid forces of 20,000 men were numerically so superior that most of Judah's men left the field of battle and advised their leader to do likewise and to await a more favorable opportunity. However, Judah decided to stand his ground.\n\nIn the Battle of Elasa, Judah and those who remained faithful to him were killed. His body was taken by his brothers from the battlefield and buried in the family sepulchre at Modiin. The death of Judah Maccabee (d. 160 BCE) stirred the Jews to renewed resistance. After several additional years of war under the leadership of two of Mattathias' other sons (Jonathan and Simon), the Jews finally achieved independence and the liberty to worship freely.\n\nAs warrior hero and national liberator, Judah Maccabee has inspired many writers, and several artists and composers. In the Divine Comedy, Dante sees his spirit in the Heaven of Mars with the other \"heroes of the true faith\". In Shakespeare's Love's Labour's Lost, he is enacted along with the other Nine Worthies, but heckled for sharing a name with Judas Iscariot. Most significant works dedicated solely to him date from the 17th century onwards. William Houghton's \"Judas Maccabaeus\", performed in about 1601 but now lost, is thought to have been the first drama on the theme; however, \"Judas Macabeo,\" an early \"comedia\" by crucial Spanish playwright Pedro Calderón de la Barca is extant. Fernando Rodríguez-Gallego details its history in his critical edition: the play was performed in the 1620s in different versions and finally published as part of an anthology by Vera Tassis in 1637. Following on its heels is \"El Macabeo\" (Naples, 1638), a Castilian epic by the Portuguese Marrano Miguel de Silveyra. Two other 17th century works are \"La chevalerie de Judas Macabé\" by French poet Pierre du Ryer (c. 1600–1658) and the anonymous neo-Latin work \"Judas Machabaeus\" (Rome, 1695). Handel wrote his \"Judas Maccabaeus\" oratorio (1746) on the subject.\n\nThere has been interest in Judah in every century. \"Giuda Macabeo, ossia la morte di Nicanore...\" (1839), is an Italian \"azione sacra\" based on which Vallicella composed an oratorio. One of the best-known literary works on the theme is \"Judas Maccabaeus\" (1872), a five-act verse tragedy by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow. A Hebrew version of Longfellow's play was published in 1900. Two later 19th-century interpretations of the story are \"Judas Makkabaeus\", a novella by the German writer Josef Eduard Konrad Bischoff, which appeared in \"Der Gefangene von Kuestrin\" (1885), and \"The Hammer\" (1890), a book by Alfred J. Church and Richmond Seeley.\n\nSeveral 20th-century Jewish authors have also written works devoted to Judah Maccabee and the Maccabeean Revolt. Jacob Benjamin Katznelson (1855–1930) wrote the poem, \"Alilot Gibbor ha-Yehudim Yehudah ha-Makkabi le-Veit ha-Hashmona'im\" (1922); the Yiddish writer Moses Schulstein wrote the dramatic poem, \"Yehudah ha-Makkabi\" (in \"A Layter tsu der Zun\", 1954); Jacob Fichmann's \"Yehudah ha-Makkabi\" is one of the heroic tales included in \"Sippurim le-Mofet\" (1954). Amit Arad's historical novel \"Lions of Judea - The miraculous story of the Maccabees\" (2014). Many children's plays have also been written on the theme by various Jewish authors.\n\nIn addition, the American writer Howard Fast penned the historical novel, \"My Glorious Brothers\", which was published in 1948, during the Israeli War of Independence.\n\nDuring World War II the Swiss-German writer Karl Boxler published his novel \"Judas Makkabaeus; ein Kleinvolk kaempft um Glaube und Heimat\" (1943), the subtitle of which suggests that Swiss democrats then drew a parallel between their own national hero, William Tell, and the leader of the Maccabean revolt against foreign tyranny.\n\nThe modern play \"Playing Dreidel with Judah Maccabee\" by Edward Einhorn is about a contemporary boy who meets the historical figure.\n\nIn the medieval Christian art, Judah Maccabee was regarded as one of the heroes of the Old Testament. He figures in a tenth-century illustrated manuscript \"Libri Maccabaeorum\". The late medieval French artist Jean Fouquet painted an illustration of Judah triumphing over his enemies for his famous manuscript of Josephus. Rubens painted Judah Maccabee praying for the dead; the painting illustrates an episode from 2 Maccabees 12:39–48 in which Judah's troops find stolen idolatrous charms on the corpses of Jewish warriors slain on the battlefield. He therefore offers prayers and an expiatory sacrifice for these warriors who have died in a state of sin. During the Counter-Reformation the passage was used by Catholics against Protestants in order to justify the doctrine of purgatory. Accordingly, Rubens painted the scene for the Chapel of the Dead in Tournai cathedral. In the 19th century, Paul Gustave Doré executed an engraving of Judah Maccabee victoriously pursuing the shattered troops of the Syrian enemy.\n\nIn music, almost all the compositions inspired by the Hasmonean rebellion revolve around Judah. In 1746, the composer George Frideric Handel composed his oratorio \"Judas Maccabeus,\" putting the biblical story in the context of the Jacobite rising of 1745. This work, with libretto by Thomas Morell, had been written for the celebrations following the Duke of Cumberland's victory over the Scottish Jacobite rebels at the Battle of Culloden in 1746. The oratorio's most famous chorus is \"See, the conqu'ring hero comes\". The tune of this chorus was later adopted as a Christian Easter hymn tune \"Thine Be The Glory, Risen Conquering Son\". A Hebrew translation of Handel's \"Judas Maccabaeus\" was prepared for the 1932 Maccabiah Games and is now popular in Israel with the motif of \"conqu'ring hero\" becoming a Hanukkah song. Beethoven composed a set of theme and variations 12 Variations on 'See the conqu'ring hero comes' for Cello and Piano, WoO 45.\n\nTom Lehrer refers to Judas Maccabeus in his song \"Hanukkah in Santa Monica\".\n\nMirah refers to Judah Maccabee in her song \"Jerusalem\".\n\nIn \"The Goldbergs Mixtape\", a parody song is named \"Judah Macabee\".\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "431483", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=431483", "title": "Magpie goose", "text": "Magpie goose\n\nThe magpie goose (\"Anseranas semipalmata\") is the sole living representative species of the family Anseranatidae. This common waterbird is found in northern Australia and southern New Guinea. As the species is prone to wandering, especially when not breeding, it is sometimes recorded outside its core range. The species was once also widespread in southern Australia, but disappeared from there largely due to the drainage of the wetlands where the birds once bred. The Kunwinjku of western Arnhem Land know this bird as Manimanuk. It became an important food item with the formation of wetlands about 1500 ya, and is depicted in rock art from this period. Mimi figures are often shown holding goose-feather fans (Goodfellow & Stott, 2001; 2005).\n\nMagpie geese are unmistakable birds with their black and white plumage and yellowish legs. The feet are only partially webbed, and the magpie goose feeds on vegetable matter in the water, as well as on land. Males are larger than females. Unlike true geese, their moult is gradual, so no flightless period results. Their voice is a loud honking.\n\nThis species is placed in the order Anseriformes, having the characteristic bill structure, but is considered to be distinct from the other species in this taxon. The related and extant families, Anhimidae (screamers) and Anatidae (ducks, geese, and swans), contain all the other taxa. The magpie goose is contained in the genus \"Anseranas\" and family Anseranatidae, which are monotypic now.\nA cladistic study of the morphology of waterfowl found that the magpie goose was an early and distinctive offshoot, diverging after screamers and before all other ducks, geese, and swans.\n\nThis family is quite old, a living fossil, having apparently diverged before the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event — the relative \"Vegavis iaai\" lived some 68-67 million years ago. The fossil record is limited, nonetheless. The enigmatic genus \"Anatalavis\" (Hornerstown Late Cretaceous or Early Paleocene of New Jersey, USA - London Clay Early Eocene of Walton-on-the-Naze, England) is sometimes considered to be the earliest known anseranatid. Other Paleogene birds sometimes considered magpie-geese are the genera \"Geranopsis\" from the Hordwell Formation Late Eocene to the Early Oligocene of England and \"Anserpica\" from the Late Oligocene of Billy-Créchy (France). The earliest known member of the group in Australia is an unnamed species represented by fossils found in the late Oligocene Carl Creek Limestone of Queensland. Additional fossils from North America and Europe suggest that the family was spread across the globe during the late Paleogene period. The Australian distribution of the living species ties in well with the presumed Gondwanan origin of Anseriformes, but Northern Hemisphere fossils are puzzling. Perhaps the magpie geese were one of the dominant groups of Paleogene waterfowl, only to become largely extinct later.\n\nThe magpie goose is found in a variety of open wetland areas such as floodplains and swamps. It is fairly sedentary apart from some movement during the dry season. They are colonial breeders and are gregarious outside of the breeding season when they can form large and noisy flocks of up to a few thousand individuals. Its nest is on the ground, and a typical clutch is 5-14 eggs. Some males mate with two females, all of which raise the young, unlike some other polygamous birds. This may be beneficial when predation of young is high as chicks raised by trios are more likely to survive.\n\nThis species is plentiful across its range, although this is significantly reduced in comparison to the range at time of European settlement. The range once extended as far south as the Coorong and the wetlands of the southeast of South Australia and Western Victoria. For Australia as a whole, it is not threatened and has a controlled hunting season when numbers are large. However, most of the southern populations were extirpated in the mid-20th century by overhunting and habitat destruction. The species has been subject to reintroduction projects such as Bool Lagoon between Penola and Naracoorte. Populations in more northern areas have again reached a level where it can be regularly utilized by hunters, although not in the example provided. In Victoria, the magpie goose was listed as near threatened on the 2007 advisory list of threatened vertebrate fauna in Victoria. In the December 2007 Flora and Fauna Guarantee Act list of threatened fauna, it is also listed. As of early 2008, an Action Statement for the recovery and future management of this species had not been prepared. \n\nWith the advent of climate change, and more frequent seawater inundations of the current extensive freshwater floodplains, CSIRO scientists argue that Magpie geese populations may be at risk.\n\n<Goodfellow, D.L. & M.

Stepanek, was an American poet (or as he wanted to be remembered as \"a poet, a peacemaker, and a philosopher who played\") who published seven best-selling books of poetry and peace essays. Before his death (at the age of 13) he had become known as a peace advocate and motivational speaker.\n\nMatthew Stepanek was born on July 17, 1990. Stepanek's parents divorced when he was a child. He was raised in Upper Marlboro, Maryland and later lived in Rockville, Maryland. His hero was former U.S. President Jimmy Carter, who described Stepanek as \"the most extraordinary person whom I have ever known\".\n\nStepanek suffered from a rare disorder, dysautonomic mitochondrial myopathy. His three older siblings died from dysautonomic mitochondrial myopathy, too. The condition was unknown until his mother was diagnosed with mitochondrial disease in 1992, after all four of the children had been born.\n\nStepanek was a poet and speaker, penning six volumes of bestselling Heartsongs poetry books, and a collection of peace essays that also became a bestseller. He was the lyricist for . The album was produced by Sony, was released in 2003 and performed by Billy Gilman, and which debuted at number 109 on the Billboard 200 and at number 15 on Hot Country Songs.\n\nStepanek died at age 13 at Children's National Medical Center in Washington, D.C., on June 22, 2004. He was interred at Gate of Heaven Cemetery in Silver Spring, Maryland.\n\nShortly after Stepanek's death in 2004, the non-profit Mattie J.T. Stepanek Foundation was established by a group of citizens in Rockville, Maryland where he lived.\n\nIn 2008, the We Are Family Foundation hosted the first annual international Three Dot Dash 'Just Peace Summit' based on the message Stepanek offered in his book \"Just Peace\".\n\nOn October 21, 2008, the Mattie J.T Stepanek Park was dedicated in Rockville, Maryland at an event attended by Oprah Winfrey, Nile Rodgers, Billy Gilman and others. Pepper Choplin set words from Stepanek's final peace speech to music, and a 100-voice choir performed the debut of \"Look Up Way Down\". Central to the park is the \"Peace Garden\", which was designed based on the peace imagery Stepanek used in his essay book, \"Just Peace: A Message of Hope\". In the Peace Garden there is a life-size bronze statue of Stepanek and his service dog, Micah, surrounded by chess tables. Throughout the park are quotes and soundbites from Stepanek.\n\nOn June 6, 2010, a performance of \"Heartsongs\" took place at Carnegie Hall, NY, featuring Stepanek's poetry set to music by composer Joseph Martin, and performed by a 200 voice combined Children's Choir and other members of the Distinguished Concerts Singers International under the direction of conductor Stephen Roddy.\n\nIn 2011, Oprah Winfrey named Stepanek as one of her all time most memorable guests in the 25 year history of her show. During the final studio audience taping, Stepanek's mother and Oprah shared memories of Stepanek, discussed his life story in the \"Messenger\" book, and Oprah called him \"a messenger for our times.\"\n\nOn September 21, 2012, the Feast of St. Matthew the Apostle, the Mattie J.T. Stepanek Guild was officially initiated. The purpose of the Guild is to gather information and investigate Stepanek's life for the possible Cause of Canonization in the Catholic Church. In 2013, the National Catholic Partnership on Disability posthumously honored Stepanek with the Youth/Young Adult Leadership Award. On June 22, 2014, a Memorial Mass at the Franciscan Monastery in Washington, DC commemorated Stepanek's ten year death anniversary. It was con-celebrated by several priests from the Archdiocese of Washington, DC.\n\nAt the behest of the Mattie J.T. Stepanek Foundation, in 2013, Barbara Mikulski, a United States Senator from Maryland, sent a letter to US President Barack Obama, wanting to declare July 17 (Stepanek's birthday) a national peace day in Stepanek's honor. In July 2014, Ben Cardin, a junior United States Senator from Maryland, joined Mikulski in introducing a House Resolution (#509), which was approved by the Senate and honors Stepanek's life and peace legacy. In 2017, the City of Rockville, Maryland voted to declare Mattie's July 17 birthday as \"Peace Day\" at a local level in perpetua, as a statement of support for the National Peace Day Campaign.\n\n\n"}

However, there is a much greater chance that consumption will lead to death or transformation into a damned creature known as a Lost Soul (or Deformed Ones in the English dub). Mermaid Saga tells the tale of Yuta, an immortal who has been alive for five hundred years. Throughout the series, he wanders across Japan searching for a cure and meets others whose lives have also been ruined by mermaid flesh.\n\n\"Note: In some cases a character is portrayed by a different voice actor in the OVAs. These voice actors are also added.\"\n\n\n\nThe original manga was serialised in \"Shōnen Sunday\", starting in 1984. In total there are 9 stories told in 16 episodes.\n\nThe first tankōbon was \"Ningyo no Mori\", named after the third story within it (or \"Rumic World: Ningyo no Mori\" in its OVA adaptation.) The second tankōbon, \"Ningyo no Kizu\" was then released in Japan, leaving out two stories (4 episodes): \"Yasha no Hitomi\" and \"Saigo no Kao\". These stories were not available then the book came out. The series was re-released in Shinsoban format in 2003, now in three volumes and with all episodes. Later a new edition, in four volumes, with the same 16 episodes were released.\n\nMermaid Forest began serialisation by Viz Media in Animerica's first issue. Matt Thorn provided the translation.\n\nIn the U.S., the manga was first released in three volumes, called \"Mermaid Forest\", \"Mermaid's Scar\" and \"Mermaid's Gaze\". Later in four books, simply named \"Mermaid Saga\" volume 1-4.\n\nThe first OVA, Mermaid Forest, was released in Japan in August 1991. A subtitled VHS release was released in North America by US Manga Corps on March 3, 1993. It was marketed as one of the \"Rumik World\" anime (along with \"Maris the Chojo\", \"Fire Tripper\", and \"Laughing Target\").\n\n\"Mermaid's Scar\", was released in Japan on VHS and Laserdisc by Madhouse on September 24, 1993. Viz media published a dubbed release on VHS on November 21, 1995.\n\nIn 2003 the animation company Tokyo Movie Shinsha produced a 13 episodes TV series based on Takahashi's short stories as part of the Takahashi Rumiko Gekijō series. All but \"Mermaid's Gaze\" were animated. While closely following the story of the original manga (more so than the OVA versions), many of the violent aspects of the stories were toned down. Only eleven episodes were shown on Japanese TV, with the final two episodes (\"Mermaid's Scar\") released direct to video, allegedly because this particular story was too violent for TV. It was released in North America by Geneon.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "54009168", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54009168", "title": "Murder of Edna Phillips", "text": "Murder of Edna Phillips\n\nEdna Phillips was a 70-year-old woman who was murdered on 16 July 1992 by two teenage girls, one of them her next-door neighbour, at her home on a council estate in Penywaun in South Wales. The details of the crime were made public soon after the start of the trial of the two boys who murdered two-year-old James Bulger in Merseyside, which contributed to the resulting moral panic in the United Kingdom.\n\nPhillips lived on the Penywaun council estate, which had become increasingly dangerous since unemployment increased in the Cynon Valley and the local police station was closed as a cost-saving measure. The Rossi family moved into the house next door when their daughter, Maria, was a toddler. Phillips took Maria for walks when she was young, but later made complaints about loud music and drunkenness at the Rossi house, and reported Maria to the police; after that the Rossis despised her, rubbish was dumped in her garden, and Maria threw stones at her, called her a \"fucking bitch\" in the street, smeared faeces on her house and committed other vandalism, stole her money, and mistreated her dog, Chum. In 1987, Phillips began asking to be moved to another house, but her request was not granted. In 1992, after Maria burgled her house, she wrote to her MP, Ann Clwyd; the police then put her in touch with Victims' Services and installed a burglar alarm, and a deputy divisional commander wrote to Clwyd that \"All matters raised within the letter [had] been satisfactorily addressed.\"\n\nLate in the evening of 16 July 1992, under the influences of cider and drugs, Maria Rossi and her friend, Christina \"Tina\" Molloy, both 17, saw Phillips, who was then 70 and partially sighted, calling for Chum to come in; they forced her back into her house, where they strangled her with the dog's chain, slashed her 35 times in the face with a utility knife, scissors and a piece of broken glass, stabbed her 86 times and stamped on her chest, breaking five ribs, broke her nose and attempted to scalp her, and broke eggs over her body. They stole her vacuum cleaner and radio and her money. The next morning Maria was heard singing \"Ding, dong, Edna's dead\" or \"We've killed Edna\".\n\nA crowd of 300 people attacked the Rossi house after discovery of the murder, throwing stones, destroying a greenhouse belonging to Maria Rossi's grandparents and uprooting the plants. 'Murderer' was painted on the house and Molloy's parents' house was also wrecked; both families had to be taken to safety and their new addresses kept secret.\n\nOn 8 March 1993, both Rossi, who had previous convictions for theft and drug offenses, and Molloy, who had two previous convictions for assault and criminal damage, were given indefinite sentences. In sentencing, Judge Baker described them as \"evil products of a modern age\" and said: \"If as youngsters some discipline had been imposed upon you, whether in the home, at school or through the courts, you might not be standing in the dock for this dreadful offense.\"\n\nDetails of the crime were first made public at the sentencing, which followed by less than three weeks the start of the trial of two ten-year-old boys for murdering two-year-old James Bulger. It contributed to a moral panic in the UK concerning young killers, who, the sociologist Colin Hay pointed out in a 1995 article, were particularly disturbing since they did not constitute a clear \"folk devil\".\n\nMolloy and Rossi were sentenced to a 'tariff' (minimum term) of 15 years. In April 1999 the Home Secretary, Jack Straw, reduced Rossi's to 13 years, but the Lord Chief Justice, Lord Woolf, refused to reduce it further, while reducing Molloy's to 12 years. In a case brought on behalf of Rossi and of Anthony Dudson, who was 16 when he participated in the murder of Suzanne Capper in Manchester in December 1992, the High Court ruled that the Home Secretary must regularly review all sentences of those in prison for murders committed when they were juveniles; this ruling was affirmed in February 2004 over the objections of the then Home Secretary, David Blunkett. Rossi was then known as Maria Smith. People in Penywaun warned that neither of them would be welcome to return.\n\nChristina Molloy was found dead in May 2017.\n"}

The girl had been murdered and decapitated (between 12 and 48 hours prior to discovery). The body was naked and the head was wrapped in a trash bag and dumped nearby. The brutality of the crime, and the fact that the child went unidentified for a long period, sparked national interest. In an effort to identify the girl, police released sketches, computerized likenesses, and at least two busts depicting the victim.\n\nOn April 28, 2001, Erica's body was found, missing the head, near Hibbs Park at 59th Street and Kensington Avenue, Kansas City, Missouri. The young girl's head was found approximately 150 to 200 yards southeast of the body recovery site on May 1, 2001. It was determined that she had been beaten with an ashtray (which was found with the body, but lacked DNA or fingerprints), and kicked several times, causing brutal injuries all over her body. The girl had been decapitated in an effort to keep police from being able to identify the body.\n\nThe case was featured on the TV programs \"America's Most Wanted\"\nand \"Cold Case Files\" several times.\n\nOn May 5, 2005, the body was identified as Erica Green, age three, and her mother Michelle Johnson (also known as Michelle Pierce) and stepfather Harrell Johnson were charged with her murder and extradited from Oklahoma to face charges in Missouri. Michelle Johnson's eight other children were taken into state custody or placed with relatives. On December 3, 2005, prosecutors announced that they would seek the death penalty against Erica's stepfather, Harrell Johnson.\nPolice have said that Erica died when Harrell Johnson used hedge clippers to sever her head. Johnson's cousin, Lawanda Driskell, said that Erica's mother helped Harrell dispose of the body by taking Erica from the house as if sleeping in a stroller and telling Driskell she had given Erica to the woman who had raised her while Johnson was in prison.\n\nOn October 8, 2008, Harrell Johnson was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to life in prison. On October 22, 2008, Michelle Johnson was sentenced to 25 years in prison, in exchange for her 2007 guilty plea to second-degree murder and testimony against her husband.\n\n\n"}

Symptoms present in the baby shortly after birth from a prior nuchal cord may include duskiness of face, facial petechia, and bleeding in the whites of the eye. Complications can include meconium, respiratory distress, anemia, and stillbirth. Multiple wraps are associated with greater risk.\nThe diagnosis may be suspected if there is a decrease in the babies heart rate during delivery. Nuchal cords are typically checked for by running the finger over the baby's neck once the head has delivered. Ultrasound may pick up the condition before labor.\nIf detected during delivery, management includes trying to unwrap the cord or if this is not possible clamping and cutting the cord. Delivery can typically take place as normal and outcomes are generally good. Rarely long term brain damage or cerebral palsy may occur. Nuchal cords occur in about a quarter of deliveries. The condition has been described at least as early as 300 BC by Hippocrates.\n\nSymptoms of a prior nuchal cord shortly after birth in the baby may include duskiness of face, facial petechia, and bleeding in the whites of the eye. Complications can include meconium, respiratory disease, anemia, and still birth.\n\nIn 1962, J. Selwyn Crawford MD from the British Research Council defined a nuchal cord as one that is wrapped 360 degrees around the fetal neck. Crawford commented \"It is all the more remarkable, therefore, that little work has been done ... to analyze its effects during labor and delivery\". To date, there is no prospective case control double-blind study looking at nuchal cords and observational studies vary in opinion as to the degree of poor outcomes. Also not included in these studies is which umbilical cord form (of the 8 different possible structures) was considered a nuchal cord.\n\nUltrasound diagnosis of a cord around the neck was first described in 1982. “Coils occur in about 25% of cases and ordinarily do no harm, but occasionally they may be so tight that constriction of the umbilical vessels and consequent hypoxia result.” Williams Obstetrics 16th Edition, has only one single sentence in the entire textbook regarding cords around the neck. By contrast, the First Edition of the Encyclopædia Britannica from 1770 had 20 pages of information about Umbilical Cord Pathology with drawings of Umbilical Cord Entanglement. The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists has these images on its brochure. There are currently three recent texts on ultrasonography which demonstrate the ability of ultrasound to identify umbilical cord issues with reliability as of 2009.\n\nA study published in 2004 was done to establish the sensitivity of ultrasound in the diagnosis of a nuchal cord. Each of 289 women, induced the same day, underwent a transabdominal ultrasound scan with an Aloka 1700 ultrasound machine with a 3.5 MHz abdominal probe, using gray-scale and color Doppler imaging immediately prior to induction of labor. Presence of the cord was sought in the transverse and sagittal plane of the neck. A nuchal cord was diagnosed if the cord was visualized lying around at least 3 of the 4 sides of the neck. A cord was actually present at delivery in 52 of the 289 women. Only 18 of the 52 cords or 35% of the nuchal cords were detected on ultrasound done immediately before delivery, and 65% of nuchal cords were not detected. Of the 237 cases where there was no cord at delivery, ultrasound had false positive results, i.e. diagnosed a cord in 44 of the 237 cases (19%) in which there was no cord present at all. In this study, ultrasound was only 35% accurate at finding a single loop, and only 60% accurate at detecting a nuchal cord wrapped multiple times around the neck.\n\nIn no study was it possible by ultrasound to distinguish between a loose or a tight cord, although at least 3 attempted to do so. Peregrine concludes that ultrasound diagnosis of nuchal cords will only be useful if doctors are able to do so reliably and predict which of those fetuses are likely to have a problem., However, perinatologists routinely look for umbilical cord issues in monoamniotic twins. Studies have shown an improvement in outcomes where cord entanglement was prenatally identified in these cases. Ultrasound measurement of the velocity of flow in the cord may be useful in the management of twins and chronically growth-retarded fetuses. Of course this depends on the training of the sonographer. To date there are no ultrasound courses which teach the identification of nuchal cord to physicians or technicians. A recent review by Wilson of the American Academy of Ultrasonography Technicians recommends the documentation of umbilical cord issues.\n\n\nManagement of a presenting nuchal cord should be tailored to prevent umbilical cord compression whenever possible. Techniques to preserve an intact nuchal cord depend on how tightly the cord is wrapped around the infant’s neck. If the cord is loose, it can easily be slipped over the infant’s head. The infant can be delivered normally and placed on maternal abdomen as desired. If the cord is too tight to go over the infant’s head, the provider may be able to slip it over the infant’s shoulders and deliver the body through the cord. The cord can then be unwrapped from around the baby after birth. Finally, if the cord is too tight to slip back over the shoulders, one may use the somersault maneuver to allow the body to be delivered. The birth attendant may also choose to clamp and cut the umbilical cord to allow for vaginal delivery if other methods of nuchal cord management are not feasible.\n\nRetrospective data of over 182,000 births, with the statistical power to determine even mild associations, suggest that a single or multiple nuchal cords at the time of delivery is not associated with adverse perinatal outcomes, is associated with higher birthweights and fewer caesarean sections in births. Although some studies have found that a tight nuchal cord is associated with short term morbidity, it is unclear whether such outcomes are actually a result of the presence of the nuchal cord itself, or as a result of clamping and cutting the cord \n"}

He predicts that Artificial Intelligence would outsmart the human brain in computational capabilities by mid-21st century. His first book, \"The Age of Intelligent Machines\", published in 1990, put forth his theories on the results of the increasing use of technology and predicted the explosive growth in the internet, among other predictions. Later works, 1999's \"The Age of Spiritual Machines\" and 2005's \"The Singularity is Near\" outlined other theories including the rise of clouds of nano-robots (nanobots) called foglets and the development of Human Body 2.0 and 3.0, whereby nanotechnology is incorporated into many internal organs.\n\nKurzweil's first book, \"The Age of Intelligent Machines\", was published in 1990. It forecast the demise of the already crumpling Soviet Union due to new technologies such as cellular phones and fax machines disempowering authoritarian governments by removing state control over the flow of information. In 2005, Mikhail Gorbachev told Kurzweil that emerging decentralized electronic communication \"was a big factor\" for fostering democracy in the Soviet Union.\n\nKurzweil extrapolated the performance of chess software to predict that computers would beat the best human players \"by the year 2000\". In May 1997 chess World Champion Garry Kasparov was defeated by IBM's Deep Blue computer in a well-publicized chess tournament.\n\nPerhaps most significantly, Kurzweil foresaw the explosive growth in worldwide Internet use that began in the 1990s. At the time of the publication of \"The Age of Intelligent Machines\", there were only 2.6 million Internet users in the world, and the medium was often unreliable outside academic, military, corporate and other heavily invested settings, difficult for non-technical users to use, and mostly lacking a broad range of content. He also stated that the Internet would explode not only in the number of users but in content as well, eventually granting users access \"to international networks of libraries, data bases, and information services\". Additionally, Kurzweil correctly foresaw that the preferred mode of Internet access would inevitably be through wireless systems, and he was also correct to estimate that the latter would become practical for widespread use in the early 21st century.\n\nIn 1999, Kurzweil published a second book titled \"The Age of Spiritual Machines\", which goes into more depth explaining his futurist ideas. The third and final section of the book is devoted to elucidating the specific course of technological advancements Kurzweil believes the world will experience over the next century. Titled \"To Face the Future\", the section is divided into four chapters respectively named \"2009\", \"2019\", \"2029\", and \"2099\". For every chapter, Kurzweil issues predictions about what life and technology will be like in that year.\n\nKurzweil restated his earlier prediction from \"The Age of Intelligent Machines\" regarding the advent of pocket-sized, cheap, text-to-speech converters for the blind by 2009. The \"Kurzweil-National Federation of the Blind Reader\" (K-NFB Reader) was introduced in 2005 at a price of $3,495. The device was portable, but not the cheap, pocket-sized device of the prediction. By 2008, a software version for the (pocket-sized) Nokia N82 smartphone was available for $1,595. A version for iOS phones was released for $99 in 2014 and Android for $75 in 2015.\n\nWhile this book focuses on the future of technology and the human race as \"The Age of Intelligent Machines\" and \"The Age of Spiritual Machines\" did, Kurzweil makes very few concrete, short-term predictions in \"The Singularity Is Near\", though longer-term visions abound.\n\nKurzweil predicted that, in 2005, supercomputers with the \"computational capacities\" to simulate protein folding will be introduced. In 2010, a supercomputer simulated protein folding for a very small protein at an atomic level over a period of a millisecond. The protein folded and unfolded, with the results closely matching experimental data.\nThe biyearly protein structure prediction contest CASP shows that the current algorithms for structure prediction are still impractical for determining the previously unknown structure of most proteins.\n\nIn an October 2002 article published on his website, Kurzweil stated that \"Deep Fritz-like chess programs running on ordinary personal computers will routinely defeat all humans later in this decade.\" Deep Fritz is a computer chess program—generally considered superior to the older Deep Blue — that has defeated or tied a number of human chess masters and opposing chess programs. Due to advances in personal computer performance, the Deep Fritz program can now run on ordinary personal computers, and different versions of it are available for purchase. In September 2002, \"Chessmaster 9000\", a widely available chess playing game from Ubisoft, defeated the then U.S. Chess Champion and International Grandmaster Larry Christiansen in a four-game match. In 2006 reigning World Champion Vladimir Kramnik was defeated 4:2 by Deep Fritz, running on a multiprocessor personal computer.\n\nAccording to Ray Kurzweil, 89 out of 108 predictions he made were entirely correct by the end of 2009. Kurzweil later released a more detailed analysis of the accuracy of his predictions up to 2009, arguing that most were correct.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKurzweil has even wagered that his predictions will be true, on the site Long Bets Betting against Mitchell Kapor, founder of Lotus Software Corporation for a payout of $20,000, or $10,000 each.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10 terabytes of storage (not memory) have been already reached for $535 (Seagate Barracuda 10TB) in mid 2016.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKurzweil said in a 2006 C-SPAN2 interview that \"nanotechnology-based\" flying cars would be available in 20 years.\n\nKurzweil has said that by 2014, humanity will reach a \"tipping point\" where the cost-per-watt from solar energy is cheaper than from coal and oil: By capturing only 0.03 percent of the sun's energy that falls on Earth, humanity could meet virtually all of its projected energy needs up to 2030 (thirty trillion watts); this will be capable through with extremely inexpensive, lightweight, and efficient nano-engineered solar panels together with nano-fuel cells to store and distribute the captured energy. Kurzweil believes, by the end of the 2020s, humans will be able to completely replace fossil fuels.\n\nKurzweil has said that by the 2030s, people will be able to send nano-bots into their brains through their capillaries. The nano-bots will take up positions in close physical proximity to each interneuronal connection coming from each physical sense and cause the firing of neurons to result in full-immersion virtual reality, similar to the way psychedelic drugs alter consciousness. The nano-bots will also allow people to \"connect their neocortex to the cloud\". This technology is based on “neuron transistors” developed by scientists at the Max Planck Institute that can control the firing of neurons.\n\nKurzweil said the following in a November 2007 \"Computerworld\" interview:\n\nIn the cover article of the December 2010 issue of \"IEEE Spectrum\", John Rennie criticized Kurzweil's predictions: \"On close examination, his clearest and most successful predictions often lack originality or profundity. And most of his predictions come with so many loopholes that they border on the unfalsifiable.\"\n"}

In 1945, he was drafted to the Volkssturm and assigned as an anti-aircraft battery assistant.\n\nAfter the war's end, he began working as property master and stage manager in a theater in his native Magdeburg, while studying acting in a local studio. After completion, he went to appear on the stages of theaters in Salzwedel, Stendal, Staßfurt, Güstrow and also in the Kleist Theater in Frankfurt am Oder.\n\nHerricht first met fellow actor Hans-Joachim Preil in 1951, while they both worked in Bernburg. The two formed the 'Herricht and Preil' comedy duo, staging their first sketch, 'The Chess Match', in 1953. In the sketch, Preil vainly attempts to play chess with Herricht, who is completely oblivious to the rules of the game. In their act, Herricht played the 'funny man', while Preil served as the 'straight man'. The pair were active until Herricht's passing away.\n\nIn 1957, Herricht returned to the Magdeburg Theater, where he remained until 1961. He mainly played comical characters, like the scribe in \"The Beaver Coat\" and the drunkard from Auerbach's Cellar in \"Faust I\".\n\nDuring his time in Magdeburg, he also worked in the radio. He and Preil first performed on television when one of their sketches was broadcast by Deutscher Fernsehfunk in 1959. The show was well received by the audience and the two began making regular appearances on TV. Herricht and Preil became the German Democratic Republic's most celebrated comedians.\n\nHerricht made his film debut in DEFA's 1959 comedy \"Before the Lightning Strikes\", playing a minor part of a locomotive constructor. Herricht later appeared in some twenty cinema productions, while also playing in many television films. In 1964, he joined the regular cast of the Metropol Theater in Berlin. He also had a career as a singer.\n\nHerricht appeared on screen in relatively minor roles until writer Maurycy Janowski and director Gottfried Kolditz decided to create a film the plot of which would be based on his comical skill, the 1964 \"Geliebte weiße Maus\". Herricht portrayed a traffic policeman who falls in love with a woman and only dares speak to her when she makes an accident on the road. The picture met with considerable success. Herricht starred in several other popular DEFA comedies during the 1960s and the 1970s: among others, he played the erratic National People's Army reserve soldier Ralf Horricht in the 1965 \"Der Reserveheld\" and the last-minute-travel-guide Hurtig in the 1967 \"Meine Freundin Sybille\". His 1965 \"Hände hoch oder ich schieße\", in which he again appeared as an eccentric policeman, was banned at the 11th plenary session of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany and only released in 2009, 28 years after his death.\n\nHerricht was twice awarded the Art Prize of the German Democratic Republic: on 17 May 1973 and on 13 May 1977.\n\nHe died of a heart attack at the age of 53, while performing the role of one of the gangsters in \"Kiss Me, Kate\" on the stage of the Metropol. He is buried in Berlin's I Französischer Friedhof.\n\n\n\n\n"}

His feast day is generally placed on 17 November, although the Demetian Calendar formerly used in southern Wales placed it on the 16th; it is no longer observed by either the Anglican or Catholic church in Wales.\nAfan as a man's name in Wales is probably a loan from the Latin \"Amandus\". In Welsh, he is sometimes known as ' (\"Bishop Afan\") from his title and as ' or \"\" from his diocese around Builth in Brycheiniog.\n\nSaint Afan was the son of Cedig ap Ceredig, son of Cunedda Wledig, king of Gwynedd. Through this line, he was a cousin of Saint David, patron saint of Wales. Afan's mother is variously given as Dwywai, Degfed (\"Tenth\"), Tegfedd, or Tegwedd, all said to have been daughters of Tegid the Bald, a lord of Penllyn in Meirionnydd who was the husband of the sorceress Ceridwen in Welsh legend.\n\nAfan was the founder of a Llanafan in Ceredigion and two others (Llanafan Fawr and Llanafan Fechan) in Brecknockshire. He is recorded as a bishop, although his diocese remains unknown. He may have been the third bishop of Llanbadarn in Ceredigion, bishop over Builth with his seat at Llanafan Fawr, or held the title without any purview beyond his own parish. His death was credited to martyrdom at the hand of Irish or Danish pirates on the banks of the River Chwefru. He was claimed as an ancestor of the 10th-century bishop Ieuan who was also martyred by Viking marauders.\n\nA miracle recounted by Gerald of Wales claimed that the Anglo-Norman lord Philip de Braose was struck blind and saw his hunting dogs go mad when he disrespectfully used church in Brecknockshire as a makeshift hostel one night. He was told that his vision would only return if he resolved to leave his estates and fight in the Crusades. Some say his sight was restored upon his pledge but Gerald records that he traveled to the Holy Land and fought blind, where he was \"immediately struck down by a blow from a sword and so ended his life with honour\".\nSaint Afan was said to have founded the parish of Llanafan in Ceredigion (now Llanafan y Trawsgoed), whose present church serves as the chapel for the village of Llanafan and the nearby Trawsgoed Estate. Its grounds house the family crypt of the earls of Lisburne.\n\nTwo churches were dedicated to him in the deanery of Builth: Llanafan Fawr (\"Great Llanafan\") and Llanafan Fechan or Fach (\"Lesser Llanafan\"), which eventually became known as Llanfechan. His relics are claimed by Llanafan Fawr, which served as a pilgrimage site during the Middle Ages. Saint Afan's grave in the churchyard there is inscribed (\"Here lies Saint Avan, bishop\") in deeply cut, slightly ornamented Lombardic script. The present tomb, however, is not older than the late 13th century.\n\nBrowne Willis also considered the \"Saint Afran\" honored at Llantrisant on Anglesey to be a corruption of Afan.\n\n\n\n"}

The tree was at least tall and approximately 180 to 200 years old. The tree played a central role in the film's plot and was one of the most popular tourist sites connected to it. The tree was split by lightning on July 29, 2011, and was eventually knocked down by strong winds on or around July 22, 2016.\n\nThe tree was a major tourist attraction for fans of the film, although located on private property at Malabar Farm. The tree was part of \"The Shawshank Trail\" which features many of the film's iconic locations and attracts up to 35,000 visitors annually. The farm where the tree was located sometimes is a venue for weddings.\n\nOn July 29, 2011, half of the tree fell due to trunk rot from ants after being hit by lightning. News of the event became viral, appearing in news outlets in the United Kingdom and India. The tree's fate was uncertain at the time, and officials were pessimistic about its chances of survival, but it was found to be alive. The tree was further damaged in July 2016 due to strong winds. The event caused a major increase in Internet traffic to the Mansfield and Richland County Convention and Visitors Bureau website and general interest in the Shawshank Trail. The remaining portions of the tree were cut down on April 9, 2017, by the property's current owner.\n\nThough the film is set in Maine, much of the filming took place in Mansfield, Ohio, and nearby locations. The oak appears near the end of \"The Shawshank Redemption\" when Red (played by Morgan Freeman) follows clues left by Andy Dufresne (played by Tim Robbins) to its location. Red finds a box buried at the base of a stone wall in the shade of the oak. The box contains a letter from Andy and cash to buy a bus ticket to visit him in Mexico. In the film, Andy describes the tree as \"like something out of a Robert Frost poem\".\n\nThe oak has been described as among the most iconic trees in film history.\n"}

Designers need better ways to design responsibly and to avoid unintended side-effects. \nSystemic design intends to develop methodologies and approaches that help to integrate systems thinking with design towards sustainability at environmental, social and economic level. It is a pluralistic initiative where many different approaches are encouraged to thrive and where dialogue and organic development of new practices is central.\n\nThe systemic design dialogue is driven by the Relating Systems Thinking and Design (RSD) symposium series resulting in published proceedings and several special issues on systemic design in the scientific design research journal FORMakademisk.\n\nSystemic design is being developed within the design practice and through the Systemic Design Research Network, focusing on different aspects of the issue. Different academic groups have been facing Systemic Design both in their teaching and researching activities:\n\nThe theories about complexity help the management of an entire system and the suggested design approaches help the planning of different divergent elements. The complexity theories evolved on the basis that living systems continually draw upon external sources of energy and maintain a stable state of low entropy, on the basis of the General Systems Theory by Karl Ludwig von Bertalanffy (1968). Some of the next rationales applied those theories also on artificial systems: complexity models of living systems address also productive models with their organizations and management, where the relationships between parts are more important than the parts themselves. Treating productive organizations as complex adaptive systems allows a new management model to emerge in economical, social and environmental benefits (Pisek and Wilson, 2001 ). In that field, Cluster Theory (Porter, 1990 ) evolved in more environmentally sensitive theories, like Industrial Ecology (Frosh and Gallopoulos, 1989 ) and Industrial Symbiosis (Chertow, 2000 ). \nIn 1994, Gunter Pauli and Heitor Gurgulino de Souza founded the research institute Zero Emission Research and Initiatives (ZERI), starting from the idea that progress should embed respect for the environment and natural techniques that will allow production processes to be part of the ecosystem.\nThe design thinking, as Buchanan (1992) said, means the way to creatively and strategically reconfigure a design concept on a situation with systemic integration. This needs a strong inter- and trans-disciplinarity during the design phase (Fuller, 1981 ), with the increasing involvement of different disciplines including urban planning, public policy, business management and environmental sciences (Chertow et al., 2004 ). Systems and complexity theories and design thinking redesign a pretty new discipline: the Systemic Design, which is located as a human-centred systems-oriented design practice (Bistagnino, 2011; Sevaldson, 2011; Nelson and Stolterman, 2012; Jones, 2014; Toso at al., 2012 ).\n\nThe contemporary debate on Systemic design started with the Relating Systems Thinking and Design Symposia series (RSD) on the initiative of Birger Sevaldson at the Oslo School of Architecture and Design in 2012. Amongst the invited participants were Harold Nelson, Peter H. Jones and Alex Ryan. An initial meeting was held in Oslo to consolidate the possibility of building a future network. Other participants were Michael Hensel, Colleen Ponto and others. The RSD seminars started in the context of Systems Oriented Design (SOD). In 2013-14 a discussion was initiated by Birger Sevaldson questioning the framework of the new emerging network. The network changed its name to Systemic Design allowing it to grow more pluralistically while SOD could develop more specially. The Systemic Design Research Network was founded shortly after on the initiative of Peter H. Jones and with Harold Nelson, Alex Ryan and Birger Sevaldson as co-founders.\n\nSystems thinking in design has a long history with people like Christpher Alexander, Horst Rittel, Russl Ackoff, Bela Banathy, Ranulph Glanville, M.P.Ranjan, Harold Nelson and others. Also the main systems theories and models were known and applied in design since their beginning. Despite this Systems Thinking has never become mainstream in design. The reasons for this might be that the prescribed techniques and approaches were too technical and did not fit well to an organic design process.\n\nThe systemic design initiative is addressing this problem by seeking new connections and relations between systems thinking and designerly ways of working.\n\n"}
{"id": "57795660", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=57795660", "title": "Tham Luang cave rescue", "text": "Tham Luang cave rescue\n\nIn June and July 2018, a widely publicised cave rescue successfully extracted members of a junior football team trapped in Tham Luang Nang Non cave in Chiang Rai Province, Thailand. Twelve members of the team, aged eleven to seventeen, and their 25-year-old assistant coach entered the cave on 23 June after football practice. Shortly afterwards, heavy rains partially flooded the cave, trapping the group inside.\n\nEfforts to locate the group were hampered by rising water levels and strong currents, and no contact was made for more than a week. The rescue effort expanded into a massive operation amid intense worldwide public interest. On 2 July, after advancing through narrow passages and muddy waters, British divers John Volanthen and Richard Stanton found the group alive on an elevated rock about from the cave mouth. Rescue organisers discussed various options for extracting the group, including whether to teach them basic diving skills to enable their early rescue, wait until a new entrance was found or drilled, or wait for the floodwaters to subside at the end of the monsoon season months later. After days of pumping water from the cave system and a respite from rain, the rescue teams hastened to get everyone out before the next monsoon rain, which was expected to bring a potential of additional rainfall and was predicted to start around 11 July. \nBetween 8 and 10 July, all of the boys and their coach were rescued from the cave by an international team.\n\nThe rescue effort involved more than 10,000 people, including over 100 divers, many rescue workers, representatives from about 100 governmental agencies, 900 police officers and 2,000 soldiers, and required ten police helicopters, seven police ambulances, more than 700 diving cylinders, and the pumping of more than a billion litres of water out of the caves.\n\nThere was one fatality, Saman Kunan, a 37-year-old former Thai Navy SEAL who died of asphyxiation on 6 July while returning to a staging base in the cave after delivering supplies of air.\n\nTham Luang Nang Non is a karstic cave complex beneath Doi Nang Non, a mountain range on the border between Thailand and Myanmar. The system is long and has many deep recesses, narrow passages and tunnels winding under hundreds of metres of limestone strata. Since part of the cave system is seasonally flooded, a sign advising against entering the caves during the rainy season (July–November) is posted at the entrance.\n\nOn Saturday 23 June 2018, a group of twelve boys aged between 11 and 17 from a local junior football team named the \"Wild Boars\" and their 25-year-old assistant coach, Ekkaphon Chanthawong, went missing after setting out to explore the cave. According to early news reports, they planned to have a birthday party in the cave after the football practice, and spent a significant sum of money on food, but they refuted this in a news conference after the rescue. The team was stranded in the tunnels by sudden and continuous rainfall after they had entered the cave. They had to leave some food supplies behind when fleeing the rising water.\n\nAround 7 p.m., head coach Nopparat Khanthawong () checked his phone, finding about twenty missed calls from parents worried that their children had not come home. Nopparat dialed assistant coach Chanthawong, followed by a number of the boys in quick succession. Eventually, he reached Songpon Kanthawong, a 13-year-old member of the team who mentioned he was picked up after practice, and that the rest of the boys had gone exploring in the Tham Luang caves. The coach raced up to the caves finding abandoned bicycles and bags near the entrance, with water seeping out of the muddy pathway. He alerted authorities to the missing group after seeing their unclaimed belongings.\n\nThe members of the trapped team were as follows:\n\nThe assistant coach and three of the boys had no nationality. Nopparat Khanthavong, the founder of the \"Wild Boars\" team, explained that they are from tribes in an area that extends across Thailand, Myanmar, Laos, and China. This region has no clear borders and people are not assigned passports. Their statelessness deprived them of basic benefits and rights, including the possibility to leave the Chiang Rai province. \"To get nationality is the biggest hope for the boys\", Khanthavong said. \"In the past, these boys have problems traveling to play matches outside of Chiang Rai because of their nationless status.\" Following the team's rescue, Thai officials promised to provide the three boys and the coach with legal assistance in obtaining Thai citizenship, a process which they said could take up to six months. On 26 September, the boys and the coach were granted Thai citizenship.\n\nBritish caver Vern Unsworth, who lives in Chiang Rai and has detailed knowledge of the cave complex, was scheduled to make a solo venture into the cave on 24 June when he received a call about the missing boys. Unsworth advised the Thai government to request assistance from the British Cave Rescue Council (BCRC). On 25 June, Thai Navy SEALs divers arrived and began searching the cave. A Thai Navy SEAL said the water was so murky that even with lights they could not see where they were going underwater. After continuous rain, which further flooded the entrance, the search had to be periodically interrupted. On 27 June, three BCRC cave divers arrived with specialist equipment including Heyphone LF radios, followed by separate teams of open water divers. On 28 June, a United States Air Force team of 31st Rescue Squadron Pararescue divers joined them. By 29 June, an Australian Federal Police team of Specialist Response Group divers had arrived and on Sunday a Chinese team of divers from the Beijing Peaceland Foundation. \n\nMeanwhile, policemen with sniffer dogs searched the surface above for shaft openings that could provide alternative entrances to the cave system below. Drones and robots were also used in the search, but no technology existed to scan for people deep underground. \n\nBCRC divers Richard Stanton and John Volanthen advanced through the cave complex placing diving guidelines, supported by Thailand-based Belgian cave diver Ben Reymenants. The search had to be suspended due to the weather, as rainfall increased the flow of water in the cave where the divers were battling strong currents and poor visibility. The search resumed on 2 July after the weather improved. The twelve boys and the coach were discovered at approximately 22:00, by Stanton and Volanthen, whose efforts were overseen from outside by BCRC diver Robert Harper. The boys and coach were on a narrow rock shelf about beyond the \"Pattaya Beach\" chamber, named after an above-ground beach in Thailand. Volanthen had been placing guidelines in the cave to assist others in navigation when he ran out of line. He then swam to the surface and soon found the missing group, smelling them before hearing or seeing them. The ledge where they were found is about from the cave mouth. A video of the encounter, showing the boys and their interactions with the divers, was posted on Facebook by the Thai Navy SEALs. In the video, the dazed boys are uncertain how long they have been trapped, as they ask the divers what day it is. Former Chiang Rai provincial governor , who was in charge of rescue work, said \"We found them safe. But the operation isn't over.\" The Thai, US, Australian and Chinese diving teams supported the BCRC divers began transporting diving bottles into the cave system and established an air supply storage area in Chamber 3. \n\nOn 3 July the trapped group were joined by three Thai Navy SEALs who supported them until the rescue. The SEALS included Thai Army doctor Lt. Col. Pak Loharachun of the 3rd Medical Battalion, who had completed the Navy SEALs course. Thai officials told reporters that rescuers were providing health checks and treatment and keeping the boys entertained, and that none of those trapped was in serious condition. \"They have been fed with easy-to-digest, high-energy food with vitamins and minerals, under the supervision of a doctor\", Rear Admiral Apagorn Youkonggaew, head of the Thai Navy's Special Forces, told reporters. A video made by the rescuers, and shared a few hours later by the Thai Navy SEALs, showed all twelve boys and their coach introducing themselves and stating their age. Wrapped in emergency blankets and appearing frail, they all said hello to the outside world. \"Sawatdi khrap\", each boy said with his palms together in \"wai\", the traditional Thai greeting. A second video shows a medic treating them. It was believed that some of the group could not swim, complicating what would already be a difficult rescue. The Army doctor discovered that they had attempted to dig their way out of the cave. The team members had used rock fragments to dig every day, creating a hole five metres deep.\n\nBCRC diver Jason Mallinson offered the boys and coach an opportunity to send messages to relatives by using his wet notes pad. Many of the notes said they were safe, reassured family members that everything was fine, and included words of love, reassurance and encouragement.\n\nA logistics camp was established at the cave entrance, which accommodated hundreds of volunteers and journalists in addition to the rescue workers. The site was divided into several zones: restricted areas for the Thai Navy SEALs, other military personnel, and civilian rescuers, an area for the relatives to give them privacy, and areas for the press and for the general public.\n\nAn estimated 10,000 people contributed to the rescue effort, including more than 100 divers, representatives from about 100 government agencies, 900 police officers, 2,000 soldiers and numerous volunteers. Equipment included ten police helicopters, seven police ambulances, and more than 700 diving cylinders, of which more than 500 were in the cave at any time while another 200 were in the queue to be refilled. More than a billion litres of water (the equivalent of 400 Olympic-size swimming pools) were removed.\n\nThe point where the boys became stranded was about from the entrance and below the top of the mountain. The route to them had several flooded sections, some with strong currents and zero visibility, and some extremely narrow parts, the smallest measuring only .\n\nThe journey through the cave to the team took six hours against the current and five hours to exit with the current, even for experienced divers.\nFrom the outset rescue workers battled rising water levels. In an effort to de-water the cave, a stone diversion dam was built upstream and systems were installed to pump water out of the cave and divert flows that were entering it. On 4 July, it was estimated that the pumps were removing from the cave, ruining nearby farm fields in the process. For a time, well-meaning volunteers inadvertently pumped water back into the groundwater supply. Helped by a spell of unseasonably dry weather, these efforts reduced water levels by per hour on 5 July, enabling rescue teams to walk into the cave. However, heavy rains forecast for 8 July were expected to halt or reverse this process and could even flood the position where the team were trapped. \n\nOn 6 July, the oxygen level in the cave was detected to have dropped, raising fears that the boys might develop hypoxia if they remained for a prolonged time. By 8 July the oxygen level was measured to be 15%; the level needed to maintain normal function for humans is between 19.5% and 23.5%. Thai military engineers attempted to install an air supply line to the boys, but the effort was abandoned as impractical.\n\nAs the crisis unfolded, rescuers planned several different methods to save the team and coach. The principal options were to:\n\nMultiple dangers—the threat of more heavy rain, dropping oxygen levels, and the difficulty or impossibility of finding or drilling an escape passage—forced rescuers to make the decision to bring out the team and coach with experienced divers. The Thai Navy SEALs and US Air Force rescue experts met with the Thai Minister of the Interior who approved the plan. Ninety divers worked in the cave system, forty from Thailand and fifty from other countries. Rescuers at first considered teaching the boys basic diving skills to enable them to make the journey. Organisers built a mock-up of a tight passage with chairs, and divers practiced with local boys in a school swimming pool. Thai SEALs and US Air Force experts then refined the plan to use teams of divers to bring out the weakened boys.\n\nOn 5 July at 8.37pm, Saman Kunan (), a 37-year-old former Thai Navy SEAL, made a dive from Chamber 3 to the T Junction close to Pattaya Beach to deliver three air tanks. During his return he lost consciousness underwater. His dive buddy attempted CPR without success. Kunan was brought to Chamber 3 where CPR was attempted again, but he could not be resuscitated and was pronounced dead about 1 am on 6 July. \n\nA member of Thai Navy SEALs class 30, Kunan had left the SEALs in 2006 at the rank of Petty Officer 1st class and was working in security at the Suvarnabhumi Airport when he volunteered to assist the cave rescue. He was posthumously promoted to Lieutenant Commander by the Commander-in-Chief of the Royal Thai Navy, an unprecedented rise of seven ranks. A funeral sponsored and attended by the Thai royal family was held on 14 July. On the same day, he was also awarded the Knight Grand Cross (first class) of the Most Exalted Order of the White Elephant by King Vajiralongkorn. A memorial statue of him may form a part of a proposed tourist attraction at the site. Kunan was survived by his wife, Valeepoan Kunan.\n\nOn the morning of 8 July, officials instructed the media and all non-essential personnel around the cave entrance to clear the area as a rescue operation was imminent, due to the threat of monsoon rains later in the week, which were expected to flood the cave until October. \n\nFor the first part of the extraction, eighteen rescue divers consisting of thirteen international cave divers and five Thai Navy SEALs were sent into the caves to retrieve the boys, with one diver to accompany each boy on the dive out. There were conflicting reports that the boys were rescued with the weakest first or strongest first. In fact, the order was which boy volunteered first. The international cave diving team was led by four British divers John Volanthen, Richard Stanton, Jason Mallinson, Chris Jewell each assigned a boy and two Australians, doctor Richard Harris, a physician specializing in anesthesia, and Craig Challen. Their portion of the journey would stretch over 1 kilometre going through submerged routes while being supported by 90 Thai and foreign divers at various points performing medical check-ups, resupplying air-tanks for the main divers and other emergency roles.\n\nThe boys were dressed in a wetsuit, buoyancy jacket, harness and a positive pressure full face mask. A cylinder with 80% oxygen was clipped to their front, a handle attached to their back and they were tethered to a diver in case they were lost in the poor visibility. The rescue divers described them as \"a package.\" Dr Harris administered anaesthetic to the boys before the journey, rendering them unconscious, to prevent them from panicking on the journey and risking the lives of their rescuers. The Thai government provided doctor Harris and two medical assistants with diplomatic immunity if something went wrong. The anaesthetic lasted between 45 minutes to an hour, requiring divers, who Dr Harris had trained, to re-sedate the boys during the three hour journey. The boys were manoeuvred out by the swimming divers who held onto their back or chest, with each boy on either the right or left side of the diver, depending on the guideline; in very narrow spots divers pushed the boys from behind. The divers navigated them through tight passages carefully to avoid dislodging their full face mask against rocks. The divers kept their heads higher than the boys so that in poor visibility the diver would hit their head against the rocks first. After a short dive to a dry section, the divers and boys were met by three divers, and the boys' dive gear was removed. The boys were then transported on a drag stretcher over 200m of rocks and sand hills. Craig Challen assessed them, and their dive gear was put back on before they were re-submerged for the next section. The boys arrived at 45 minute intervals. The divers knew the boys were breathing from their exhaust bubbles, which they could see and feel.\n\nAfter being delivered by the divers into the staging base in Chamber 3, the boys were then passed along a 'daisy chain' by hundreds of rescuers stationed along the treacherous path out of the cave. The boys, wrapped in 'sked' stretchers, would alternately be carried, slid and zip-lined over a complex network of pulleys installed by rock-climbers. Many areas from Chamber 3 to the entrance of the cave were still partially submerged and rescuers described having to transport the boys over slippery rocks and through muddy water for hours. The journey from Chamber 3 to the cave entrance took about four to five hours initially, but was reduced to less than an hour after a week of draining and clearing the mud path using shovels.\n\nThe authorities warned that extracting everyone would take several days, because crews had to replace air tanks, gear, and other supplies, requiring ten to twenty hours between each run. Shortly after 19:00, local officials said that two boys had been rescued and taken to Chiangrai Prachanukroh Hospital. Shortly after, two more boys exited the cave and were assessed by medical officials. Low water levels had reduced the time required for the rescues. The lower water was due to improved weather and the construction of a weir outside the cave to help control the water.\n\nOn 9 July, four more boys were rescued from the cave. On 10 July, the last four boys and their coach were rescued from the cave. Experience helped streamline the rescue procedure, so the total time to extract a boy was reduced from three hours on the first day to just over two hours on the final day, allowing four boys and the coach to be rescued. The three Thai Navy SEALs and the Army doctor who had stayed with the boys the entire time were the last to dive out. Three of these divers made it to Chamber 3, joining waiting rescuers when the pumps shut off for an uncertain reason, possibly due to a burst water pipe. Water levels in Chamber 3 started to rise, which would have cut off rescuers' access to Chamber 2, Chamber 1 and the entrance of the cave. \"All of a sudden a water pipe burst and the main pump stopped working\", a diver stated. \"We really had to run from the third chamber to the entrance because the water level was rising very quickly – like 50cm every 10 minutes.\" This forced up to 100 rescuers still located more than inside the cave to evacuate in a hurry, abandoning the rescue equipment inside the cave. The last diver made it back to Chamber 3 as everyone was preparing to leave. The rescuers managed to rush to the cave exit in under an hour.\n\nA number of news outlets reported on the role of coach Ekkaphon during the rescue. The coach had previously been a Buddhist monk, and had guided meditation for the children during the ordeal. He also passed on a message in which he apologised for putting the children in danger.\n\nThai authorities said the rescued boys were able to eat rice porridge, but more complex foods would be withheld for ten days. The Thai Health Ministry said the boys lost an average of each, but were in \"good condition\". The boys were quarantined while health workers determined whether they had caught any infectious diseases, and they were expected to remain hospitalised for at least one week. Due to the prolonged stay in the damp cave environment, officials were worried about potential infections such as histoplasmosis or leptospirosis. Parents of the team members initially visited looking through a window, but if laboratory results proved negative, they would be allowed to visit in person while wearing a medical gown, face mask and hair cap.\n\nThe boys wore sunglasses as a precaution while their eyes adjusted to daylight. Detailed tests of their eyes, nutrition, mental health and blood were carried out. A Health Ministry physician said all the boys showed an increase in white blood cells, so preventive antibiotic doses were given to the entire team.\n\nResidents of Chiang Rai province volunteered to cook, clean for, and otherwise support the missing team's families and the rescue teams at the encampment by the cave mouth. Social media were used to draw attention to the rescue attempts. Classmates and teachers of the team spent time chanting and praying for the missing boys. Classmates of one of the boys made 1,000 paper cranes for him, while praying for his safe return. Local schools donated money to help the parents with living costs, as many of them stopped working in order to follow the rescue attempts. \n\nOn 29 June, Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha visited the search site and told the families of the boys not to give up hope. Following the death of Saman Kunan, King Rama X announced that he would sponsor Kunan's funeral.\n\nAfter the rescue was completed, the boys' families, the rescue commander, military officials, and the thousands of volunteers gathered at the cave entrance. The group gave thanks for the lives saved and asked forgiveness from the cave goddess \"Jao Mae Tham\" for the intrusion of pumps, ropes and people during the rescue.\n\nSome observers, primarily in Western media, questioned whether assistant coach Ekkaphon Chanthawong should face criminal charges for leading the group into the caves, despite the warning sign at the entrance stating that it is dangerous to enter between July and November. The boys had entered the cave on 23 June, one week before the advised period. Local communities, as well as the boys' parents, emphasised that they did not blame the boys or their coach, as the rain had arrived a month earlier than usual. Vern Unsworth, a British caver mapping the cave, stated, \"Nobody’s to blame, not the coach, not the boys. They were just very unlucky ... It wasn’t just the rain that day, the mountain is like a sponge and waters from earlier rain were raising the levels\". Unsworth said that he himself had been planning to make a solo venture into the complex on 24 June, when he received a telephone call saying the boys were missing there.\n\nWhile the police chief told the newspaper \"Khao Sod\" that he \"hadn't ruled out\" pressing negligence charges against the coach for putting the team in danger, no calls were made to take legal action against him. A number of lawyers stated that the coach would probably not face criminal charges, since Thai law also takes into consideration whether a person has malicious intent. In mainstream media, Ekkaphon has widely been held 'a hero' and was a \"calm voice [that] helped boys to beat despair in the darkness.\" The coach was reported to have treated the boys with care, giving them his food, helping them remain calm, and instructing them to drink the relatively clean water dripping from the cave walls, instead of the murky floodwaters that trapped them. \n\nWhen asked if Ekkaphon should be held legally responsible for negligence, Mongkhon Bunpiam, the father of 12-year-old Mongkhon, rejected the suggestion: “We would never do that...the boys love their coach...and we as parents don’t want it either. Coach Ekk has been good to my boy, and now I hear how he gave them hope, and kept them calm for so many days without food. I have great admiration for him.” Tanawut Vibulrungruang, father of 11-year old Chanin, was reported to be \"touched by the actions of the team's coach. Without him...he doesn't know how the kids could have survived.\" The team's head coach, Nopparat Kanthawong, said he would not have approved of the hike, but was confident in Ekkaphon's ability to take care of the boys. Prime minister Prayut Chan-o-cha said that the emphasis should be on the rescue and the recovery of the team, and he asked the public to avoid a rush to judgment.\n\nOver the course of two weeks, hundreds of volunteers, military specialists and corporate experts arrived from around the world to offer assistance in the rescue.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVolunteers, teams and technical specialists from countries including Germany, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Spain, Sweden, and Ukraine, also participated in the operation. France offered to send a team of specialists and equipment, but Thai authorities believed that adequate resources were already on site.\n\nThe ordeal captured the media's attention from around the world. Over a period of three weeks, articles relating to the incident dominated the top stories section at many major news publications.\n\nTesla chief executive Elon Musk contacted James Yenbamroong, CEO of Thailand-based satellite company mu Space Corp, to get him connected with the Thai government. He then ordered engineers from two of his companies to design a \"kid-sized\" submarine to help the rescue effort. Thai authorities decided not to use the submarine.\nFIFA, via a letter from its president Gianni Infantino to the president of the Football Association of Thailand, invited the children and coach to the World Cup final if circumstances allowed. The entire team was expected to remain hospitalised for at least a week, and watched the final on television instead. FC Barcelona invited the team to play in their international academy tournament in 2019 and to watch a first-team game at their home stadium Camp Nou. England and Manchester City F.C. defender Kyle Walker said he wanted to send them shirts, after spotting that one of the rescued boys was wearing a \"Three Lions\" jersey. In October 2018 the boys traveled to the UK as guests at Old Trafford for the Manchester United F.C. home match against Everton F.C. in the Premier League. The boys were invited by the IOC to the opening ceremony of the 2018 Summer Youth Olympics in Buenos Aires.\n\n23 June: The team entered the Tham Luang cave shortly after practice and prior to heavy rain. Later, the mother of one of the boys reported to local police that her son was missing after he failed to arrive home. Local police investigated and found shoes and bicycles near the entrance of the cave after rumors spread about them going into the Tham Luang cave.\n\n24 June: Handprints and footprints of the boys were found by officials. A vigil is held outside the cave by relatives.\n\n25 June: Thai Navy SEAL divers enter the cave to search for the team.\n\n26 June: Having arrived at a T-junction, divers were pushed back due to floodwaters. The floodwaters blocked an elevated air pocket near Pattaya Beach, where divers believe the team may have been stranded.\n\n27 June: British and a US military team of divers and experts were sent to Thailand to help with the search. Divers re-entered but quickly retreated due to another flooding.\n\n28 June: Heavy rains caused the rescue operation to stop temporarily. In order to drain the water, pumps were delivered. Drones were dispatched to assist more than 600 people in search of new vents in the cave roof.\n\n29 June: Thai Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha visited the site.\n\n30 June: The search resumed after divers took advantage of a brief pause in the rainfall. They advanced further, but still were far from where they believed the boys might be stranded.\n\n1 July: As divers went deeper into the cave, they used Chamber 3 as an operating base to store diving cylinders and other supplies which were replenished by support divers transiting back and forth to the entrance.\n\n2 July: The team were found alive on elevated land in the evening at around 20:20 by the British diving team, including Richard Stanton and John Volanthen, further than Pattaya Beach. Communication was difficult since only Adun spoke English.\n\n3 July: Seven Thai Navy divers, including Doctor Pak Loharnshoon and a medic, went to deliver food, medicine and supplies to the boys, including high calorie gels and paracetamol. Four of them, including Loharnshoon, volunteered to stay with the boys inside the cave for a week until all 12 were extracted. They would be the last people to exit the cave. \n\n4 July: The team were taught how to use a full face diving mask and breathing apparatus as none of the boys knew how to swim. Rescue teams worked on continuing to pumping water from the cave, they had already pumped out over 30 million gallons.\n\n5 July: The rescue was forced to move more quickly due to expected rain. Another group searched the mountains for any new cracks or openings.\n\n6 July: Saman Kunan, a former Thai navy diver and volunteer of the rescue mission, died between 01:00 to 02:00 after losing consciousness while placing diving cylinders underwater along the route to the stranded boys. Authorities urged that the rescue happen faster, due to oxygen levels falling to 15%, well below the 21% \"safe zone.\" \n\n7 July: The rescue chief claimed that it was not suitable for the team to dive yet. More than 100 vents were being drilled in a third attempt to reach the team. However, an accident to a rescue vehicle injured six people, and the effort was called off. A letter appeared from the coach of the team, apologising to the boys' parents along with letters from the boys to their parents.\n\n8 July: Thirteen international divers, led by four British and two Australian divers, and five Thai military SEALs divers went into the cave to begin bringing the boys to safety. The boys were each to be accompanied by 3 divers as they made their way out of the cave. The boys were also sedated to prevent any panic. The first boy was reported to have come out about 17:40, and the fourth one was reported to have exited about 19:50, though not all sources agree. The four boys were taken to Chiang Rai Prachanukroh, a local hospital. It was announced that divers would not resume the rescue for at least another 10 hours, as they needed to replenish supplies.\n\n9 July: Four more boys were confirmed to be out of the cave and then taken to the hospital. It was also announced that the boys would be kept in quarantine.\n\n10 July: The remaining four boys and their coach were rescued. It was later confirmed that all of the rescue divers had also successfully exited the cave.\n\nThe head of the rescue mission and former governor of Chiang Rai province, , said that the cave system would be turned into a living museum to highlight how the operation unfolded. Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha acknowledged the statement but highlighted the concerns for tourist safety, stating that precautions would have to be added and correctly implemented both inside and outside to safeguard tourists.\n\nFollowing the incident, Thailand's Navy SEALs will include cave-diving in their training regimen to be better prepared for similar emergencies.\n\nThree of the boys and their assistant coach were stateless, and officials promised that they would be granted Thai citizenship within six months. On 26 September, the four were granted Thai citizenship. The Thai government has vowed to end statelessness by 2024.\n\nOn 10 July, a managing partner of US film production company Pure Flix announced that the firm was planning to create a feature film based on the rescue, with potential for worldwide release. Ivanhoe Pictures of SK Global Entertainment also expressed interest in a separate project, with Jon Chu slated as the director.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "440392", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=440392", "title": "Todd Bertuzzi", "text": "Todd Bertuzzi\n\nTodd Bertuzzi (born February 2, 1975) is a Canadian retired professional ice hockey winger of the National Hockey League (NHL). Known as a power forward, he has played in the NHL for the New York Islanders, Vancouver Canucks, Florida Panthers, Anaheim Ducks, Calgary Flames and Detroit Red Wings.\n\nSelected 23rd overall by the New York Islanders in the 1993 NHL Entry Draft, he played at the junior level with the Guelph Storm of the Ontario Hockey League (OHL) for four seasons. In 1995–96, he played his rookie season with the Islanders. After two-and-a-half seasons with the Islanders, he was traded to the Vancouver Canucks. Bertuzzi enjoyed the most successful seasons of his career with the Canucks—his longest tenured team in the NHL—including NHL First Team All-Star honours in 2003.\n\nAfter seven-and-a-half seasons with Vancouver, Bertuzzi was dealt to the Florida Panthers, with whom he briefly played for until being traded again to the Red Wings. He then played single seasons with the Anaheim Ducks and the Calgary Flames before returning to Detroit in 2009 and finishing his career there. Internationally, Bertuzzi has competed for Team Canada at the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin, as well as the 1998 and 2000 World Championships.\n\nAfter playing for two minor hockey teams based out of Sudbury, Ontario in 1990–91, Bertuzzi was selected in the first round (fifth overall) by the Guelph Storm in the 1991 Ontario Hockey League (OHL) Priority Selection. His future coach with the Vancouver Canucks, Marc Crawford, passed on Bertuzzi during the draft while he was general manager of the Cornwall Royals; he has recalled not selecting him due to \"maturity issues\" and that he was \"a big kid who hadn't grown into his body yet.\" Bertuzzi started his OHL career for Guelph in 1991–92, recording 21 points over 42 games as a rookie. He missed the last 15 games of the regular season due to suspension as a result of kicking opposing defenceman Brad Barton during a contest between the Storm and Kitchener Rangers. After improving to 58 points over 60 games in 1992–93, he was selected 23rd overall by the New York Islanders in the 1993 NHL Entry Draft. The NHL Central Scouting Bureau described Bertuzzi as a physical and strong player with good skating who checks hard and is offensively effective in close proximity to the net.\n\nFollowing his NHL draft, he underwent surgery for chipped bones in his left elbow in August 1993. As a result, he was unable to participate in the Islanders' training camp in September and was returned to the OHL. Playing in his third season for Guelph, he improved to 28 goals and 82 points over 61 games. Bertuzzi competed for an Islanders' roster spot at their 1994 training camp, but was sent back to his junior team after going scoreless in three exhibition games.\n\nDuring his last campaign with Guelph in 1994–95, he recorded 119 points – sixth overall in the league. His 54 goals established a single-season team record, beating Mike Prokopec's mark, set the previous year, by two goals. The Storm's forward tandem of Bertuzzi and Jeff O'Neill, who finished fourth in league scoring, led the club to the best regular season record in the league. He went on to add a team-leading 33 points in 14 playoff games, en route to an OHL Finals loss to the Detroit Junior Red Wings. After four seasons with Guelph, he left the club ranked third all-time in career points with 280, behind O'Neill and Martin St. Pierre.\n\nTwo years after his draft, Bertuzzi and the Islanders had not yet been agreed to a contract. With Bertuzzi eligible to re-enter the draft if the Islanders did not sign him by July 7, 1995, general manager Don Maloney made it apparent that he would use the team's second overall pick in the 1995 NHL Entry Draft to select him again if a contract could not be agreed upon by the required date. Moments before the midnight deadline, the Islanders were able to sign Bertuzzi to a four-year, US$4.6 million contract. His agent, Pat Morris, had reportedly wanted a similar deal to that of fellow Islanders prospect Brett Lindros – a five-year, $6.7 million contract signed the previous summer.\n\nDuring training camp in September 1995, Islanders head coach Mike Milbury heralded Bertuzzi as the team's best performing forward. Making his NHL debut on October 7, 1995, he scored a wrap around goal against goaltender Blaine Lacher in a 4–4 tie with the Boston Bruins. Beginning the season on the team's top line with Žigmund Pálffy and Travis Green, Bertuzzi finished his rookie year with 18 goals and 39 points over 76 games. The following season, Bertuzzi recorded 23 points in 64 games. The Islanders did not qualify for the playoffs in either of his two full seasons with the club, ranking second-last in the Eastern Conference in 1995–96 and 1996–97.\n\nBertuzzi's playing style as a power forward resulted in comparisons to former Islander Clark Gillies. As a result, the club hired Gillies to personally mentor Bertuzzi. Failing to meet lofty expectations from the club, Gillies once said of Bertuzzi, \"If you're built like a freight train, you can't drive around like a Volkswagen.\" Feeling burdened with the pressure of playing up to the club's expectations while his offensive production diminished, he requested to be traded away at one point during the 1996–97 season. In response, Milbury, who had also taken over general manager duties the previous season, demoted Bertuzzi to the Islanders' minor league affiliate, the Utah Grizzlies of the International Hockey League (IHL). Playing 13 games in the minors, he registered 10 points before being called back up to the NHL. During the 1997–98 campaign, he continued to score below his pace as a rookie. On February 6, 1998, he was traded along with defenceman Bryan McCabe and a third-round selection in the 1998 NHL Entry Draft (Jarkko Ruutu) to the Vancouver Canucks in exchange for veteran forward Trevor Linden. The deal was made prior to the NHL's roster freeze in preparation for the 1998 Winter Olympics.\n\nBertuzzi and McCabe had both been widely regarded as the players of the future for New York after their respective drafts in 1993. While Milbury expressed regret at having to trade McCabe, relations between Bertuzzi and the club were strained. Welcoming the trade, Bertuzzi commented that \"things weren't working out [in New York].\"\n\nBertuzzi immediately began producing with Vancouver, tallying 15 points in 22 games after the trade. Combined with his totals from New York, he finished with 33 points over 74 games in 1997–98. Contrasting his strained relationship with Milbury in New York, Canucks head coach Mike Keenan has recalled his experience with Bertuzzi upon his arrival as positive: \"He came as a young player and he was very open-minded about learning about the game.\" Similar to the Islanders, Bertuzzi joined a struggling club in Vancouver; the team finished last in the Western Conference in his first two seasons after the trade.\n\nAfter beginning the 1998–99 season on the Canucks' top line, Bertuzzi was limited to 32 games due to injuries, the first of which was a fractured tibia. He suffered the injury on November 1, 1998, after a shot by teammate Mattias Öhlund hit him in the leg. His season was later ended with a torn anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) in his left knee, suffered during a game on March 5, 1999. He recorded 8 goals and 16 points in 1998–99. In the off-season, Bertuzzi became a restricted free agent and was re-signed by the Canucks to a two-year contract in September 1999. The deal was reported by \"The Vancouver Sun\" to be worth a little over $2 million.\n\nReturning from injury the following season, Bertuzzi emerged as one of the Canucks' best offensive contributors, finishing with 25 goals (second on the team to Markus Näslund) and 50 points in 1999–2000. At the end of the season, he received the team's Most Exciting Player Award, as voted by the fans. He received the distinction three more times during his career with the Canucks from 2002 to 2004). Meanwhile, the Canucks began improving as a team, finishing four points out of a playoff spot in the West in 2000.\n\nThe following season, Bertuzzi recorded his first career NHL hat trick, recording all three goals on the power play against San Jose Sharks goaltender Evgeni Nabokov in a 6–3 win on December 30, 2000. Bertuzzi recorded a second consecutive 25-goal season in 2000–01, adding 30 assists for 55 points, third in team scoring behind Näslund and Andrew Cassels. His -18 plus-minus rating, however, was a team-worst. The Canucks continued to improve, qualifying for the post-season for the first time in five years. Entering the 2001 playoffs as the final and eighth seed in the West, they were eliminated in the first round by the Colorado Avalanche. Bertuzzi scored two goals and two assists over four games in his first NHL post-season appearance. In the off-season, Bertuzzi filed for salary arbitration after initially failing to come to terms on a new contract with the Canucks. Both sides avoided arbitration by agreeing to a three-year deal on July 26, 2001.\nIn the first month of the 2001–02 season, Bertuzzi received an automatic 10-game suspension from the league (forfeiting $118,557 in salary) after leaving the bench to help teammate Ed Jovanovski in a fight. The incident occurred during a game against the Colorado Avalanche in which opposing coach Bob Hartley sent enforcer Scott Parker onto the ice as the extra attacker during a delayed penalty. Parker proceeded to physically engage Jovanovski, at which point Bertuzzi left the bench to help his teammate. Vancouver struggled with him out of the lineup, winning 3 games during the 10-game span. Two months after returning from suspension, Bertuzzi went 15 consecutive games with at least a point, scoring 7 goals and 12 assists from January 3 – February 4, 2002. The streak tied Petr Nedvěd for the longest in Canucks history. During that span, in a game on January 9, Canucks head coach Marc Crawford replaced Andrew Cassels with Brendan Morrison, marking the beginning of what was considered by many to be the most effective line combination in the league for several seasons. Bertuzzi had emerged as an effective power forward, able to use his size and strength to position himself in front of the net, with good stickhandling ability. According to Canucks assistant coach Jack McIlhargey, Bertuzzi's skill set favourably complemented Näslund's goal-scoring and Morrison's playmaking abilities. The trio were dubbed by Vancouver media as the \"West Coast Express\", named after the city's commuter rail service of the same name.\n\nLate in the 2001–02 season, Bertuzzi recorded his second career hat-trick on March 19, 2002, during a win against the New York Rangers. He scored his first two goals of the game against Dan Blackburn and his third into an empty net. Despite missing ten games from his suspension, Bertuzzi finished the 2001–02 season third in league-scoring with 85 points, behind Näslund and Calgary Flames forward Jarome Iginla. His 1.18 points-per-game average ranked second in the NHL behind Mario Lemieux, who played 48 fewer games than Bertuzzi. He also improved his plus-minus rating by 39 points from the previous season, finishing a career-high +21. Although the Canucks were the league's highest scoring team, they finished with the final seed in the West for the 2002 playoffs, ranking eighth in their conference. Facing the Detroit Red Wings in the opening round, they were eliminated in six games. Bertuzzi recorded four points in the series.\n\nThe following season, Bertuzzi appeared in his first NHL All-Star Game. He was joined by fellow Canucks Markus Näslund, defenceman Ed Jovanovski and head coach Marc Crawford, helping the Western Conference to a 6–5 shootout win against the East. He played on a line with Näslund and Peter Forsberg. Later in the season, he scored his third career hat-trick on March 17, 2003, scoring three goals against Ron Tugnutt in a game against the Dallas Stars. He finished the season with career-highs of 46 goals (third in the league), 51 assists and 97 points (fifth in the league). His 25 power play goals led the NHL and tied Pavel Bure for the Canucks' single-season record. Linemates Näslund and Morrison also recorded personal bests with 104 and 71 points, respectively. Meanwhile, the Canucks emerged as a top team in the West. Losing the Northwest Division title to the Avalanche by one point in the regular season, they finished as the fourth seed in their conference. After going down three-games-to-one in the opening round against the St. Louis Blues, Vancouver won three straight games to advance to the second round. Facing the Minnesota Wild, the Canucks gave up their own three-games-to-one series lead and were eliminated in seven games. During the series, Bertuzzi had reportedly walked by the Xcel Energy Center box office and told Wild fans they would not need their Game 6 tickets because Minnesota would be eliminated by then. In another on-ice incident, he skated by the opposing bench during Game 7 when the Canucks were winning 2–0, telling Wild players to \"get [their] golf clubs\". Despite his successful regular season, Bertuzzi struggled to score in the playoffs, recording 6 points in 14 games. In the off-season, Bertuzzi was named with Näslund to the NHL First All-Star Team.\nWith Bertuzzi entering the final year of his contract, the Canucks began negotiating a contract extension prior to the 2003–04 season. Despite Bertuzzi's agent, Pat Morris, declaring that they would cease negotiations once the season began, Bertuzzi signed a four-year, $27.8 million deal with the Canucks on October 23, 2003. The contract took effect immediately, erasing the last year on his previous contract, and included a $3 million signing bonus ($2.5 million paid in the first year and $500,000 in the second). The deal paid him $4.3 million the first year, $6.633 million the second year and $6.933 million for the third and fourth years.\n\nIn January 2004, Bertuzzi was voted by league fans to the starting lineup of the NHL All-Star Game. Representing the Western Conference alongside Näslund and Canucks head coach Marc Crawford, they were defeated by the East 6–4. Bertuzzi had two assists while playing on a line with Näslund and Joe Sakic. Nearing the end of the 2003–04 season, Bertuzzi was indefinitely suspended by the NHL for punching Colorado Avalanche forward Steve Moore from behind during a game on March 8, 2004. His actions were a retaliation to a hit from Moore on Näslund during a previous game. Sitting out the remainder of the regular season and playoffs due to his suspension, he finished 2003–04 with 60 points over 69 games. Vancouver replaced Bertuzzi on the team's top line with Matt Cooke and went on to their first Northwest Division title, before being eliminated in the first round of the 2004 playoffs by the Calgary Flames.\n\nInactive in 2004–05 due to the players lockout and his ongoing suspension, which had been extended internationally, Bertuzzi returned to the Canucks in 2005–06, as the league ended his playing ban. He recorded 25 goals and 71 points, including two hat tricks (November 13, 2005, against the Detroit Red Wings and January 14, 2006, against the New York Islanders). Though he ranked third in team scoring, Crawford has recalled that by the end of the season, Näslund and Bertuzzi had been eclipsed by Daniel and Henrik Sedin as the team's offensive leaders.\n\nThere was speculation that the effects of the Steve Moore incident, which included assault charges and constant media coverage, were negatively affecting his play. While on the road, he was consistently heckled and booed by fans throughout the NHL. Näslund, a close friend of Bertuzzi's, later expressed sympathy for him, saying in a 2008 interview, \"It still bothers me what Todd has had to go through...There's no question he was standing up for me...it all went too far.\"\n\nBeyond the negative impact on Bertuzzi's individual play, the media speculated that the fallout from the Moore incident had become a distraction to the organization as a whole. Compounding the situation in Vancouver, the Canucks had missed the playoffs for the first time in four years. As such, general manager Dave Nonis spent the off-season making significant changes to the Canucks lineup. On June 23, 2006, he traded Bertuzzi to the Florida Panthers, along with goaltender Alex Auld and defenceman Bryan Allen, in exchange for goaltender Roberto Luongo, defenceman Lukáš Krajíček and a sixth-round selection in the 2006 NHL Entry Draft (Sergei Shirokov). After seven-and-a-half seasons with the Canucks, Bertuzzi left the club ranked seventh all-time among franchise scoring leaders with 449 points.\n\nInstrumental in facilitating the trade to Florida was Bertuzzi's positive relationship with Panthers general manager Mike Keenan, who was his first coach in Vancouver. Debuting with the Panthers on October 6, 2006, Bertuzzi scored a goal and three assists in an 8–3 win against the Boston Bruins. He appeared in six more games for Florida, notching seven points total, before being sidelined with back spasms. After being diagnosed with a herniated disc in early-November, Bertuzzi opted for surgery, which kept him out of the lineup for five months. While recovering, the Panthers dealt him to the Detroit Red Wings at the trade deadline in exchange for forward prospect Shawn Matthias and conditional draft picks. Bertuzzi was in the last year of his contract with no guarantee he would re-sign with Florida in the off-season.\nBertuzzi returned to action on March 22, 2007, debuting with his new team in a 2–1 shootout loss to the Columbus Blue Jackets. Eight days later, he scored his first goal as a Red Wing in a 4–3 shootout loss to the Dallas Stars. On April 7, he suffered a neck injury that kept him out of the lineup for the last game of the regular season and the first two games of the 2007 playoffs. He finished the campaign with 11 points in 15 games split between Florida and Detroit. During the playoffs, the Red Wings advanced to the Western Conference Finals, where they lost in six games to the Anaheim Ducks, who went on to win the Stanley Cup. Bertuzzi recorded 7 points in 16 playoff games.\n\nBecoming an unrestricted free agent in the off-season, Bertuzzi agreed to a two-year, $8 million contract with the Anaheim Ducks on July 2, 2007. Signing him was Ducks general manager Brian Burke, who had served as the Canucks general manager during Bertuzzi's time in Vancouver. Bertuzzi had reportedly been in negotiations to re-sign with Detroit, but the club only wanted a one-year deal. Playing the Red Wings in the Ducks' first game of the regular season on October 3, 2007, he registered a goal and an assist in a 3–2 shootout loss. In the first month of the 2007–08 campaign, he suffered a concussion and was sidelined for 14 games in October and November 2007. Bertuzzi returned to the lineup in time for the Ducks' away game against the Canucks on November 27, which marked his first NHL game in Vancouver since being traded away. Bertuzzi was received warmly by Canucks fans, as the Ducks lost the game 4–0. Playing in 68 contests over the season, he registered 40 points with Anaheim. Entering the 2008 playoffs as the defending champions, the Ducks were eliminated in the first round four games to two by the Dallas Stars. In six playoff contests, Bertuzzi recorded two assists.\n\nDuring the subsequent summer, several Ducks players were set to become free agents, including high-profile forward Corey Perry. Requiring additional salary cap space to make room for defenceman Scott Niedermayer, who announced he was returning for another season, Bertuzzi was placed on unconditional waivers with the intention of buying out the remaining year on his contract. Addressing Bertuzzi's buy out with the media, Burke asserted that he \"believe[d] [Bertuzzi] can still play at the NHL level,\" and that the Ducks were merely \"handcuffed by [their] salary cap situation.\" Bertuzzi once again became an unrestricted free agent and signed a one-year, $1.95 million contract with the Calgary Flames on July 7, 2008. Joining Calgary, he was reunited with Flames coach Mike Keenan. Before the start of the 2008–09 season, Bertuzzi switched jersey numbers from 4 to 7, in honour of his boyhood idol, Phil Esposito. The numbers 44, which Bertuzzi wore in New York, Vancouver and Detroit, and 4, which he wore in Anaheim, were already taken in Calgary.\n\nBertuzzi scored his first goal with the Flames, deflecting a Dion Phaneuf shot, on October 12, 2008, in a 5-4 overtime loss to the Vancouver Canucks. While initial fan reaction to Bertuzzi was negative due to his previous role with the division-rival Canucks, as well as his reputation following the Steve Moore incident, he was eventually accepted in Calgary. In January 2009, he missed five games due to a back injury. Several months later, he was sidelined again with a knee injury and underwent arthroscopic surgery to repair damaged cartilage on March 3, 2009. Missing 11 games, he returned in time for the 2009 playoffs, where the Flames were eliminated by the Chicago Blackhawks in the opening round. He finished his only season in Calgary with 44 points in 66 regular season games, while adding a goal and an assist in six playoff contests.\n\nOn August 18, 2009, Bertuzzi re-joined the Red Wings by accepting a one-year contract with the club worth $1.5 million. He recorded 44 points (18 goals and 26 assists) in 2009–10, ranking fifth in team scoring. During the second round of the 2010 playoffs, Bertuzzi recorded a career-high five-point contest (a goal and four assists) in a Game 4 victory against the San Jose Sharks. Bertuzzi finished with a playoffs career-high 11 points in 12 games.\n\nIn the off-season, Bertuzzi signed a two-year, $3.875 million contract extension with the Red Wings on June 16, 2010. During the 2010–11 season, he appeared in his 1,000th NHL game on February 20, 2011, against the Minnesota Wild. Bertuzzi scored a shootout goal to help Detroit win the game 2–1. Dressing for 81 games that season, he ranked seventh in team scoring with 45 points (16 goals and 29 assists). During the 2011 playoffs, he added 6 points (2 goals and 4 assists) over 11 games as the Red Wings were eliminated in the second round by the San Jose Sharks.\n\nOn February 23, 2012 Bertuzzi re-signed with the Red Wings for $4.15 million over two years. He dressed for seven games in the lockout-shortened 2012-2013 regular season due to injuries, producing three points, and was held pointless over six games in the playoffs. In the 2013-2014 season he played 59 games and produced 16 points, but was a healthy scratch 15 times; he played one playoff game without a point.\n\nDuring his time with Detroit, he earned praise from head coach Mike Babcock and teammates for adapting his playing style to be more defensively responsible. Bertuzzi credited the influence of teammates Pavel Datsyuk and Henrik Zetterberg, both successful two-way players in the league.\n\nOn January 9, 2015 he signed a professional tryout contract with the Ottawa Senators AHL affiliate the Binghamton Senators in hopes to get a contract with Ottawa.\nBertuzzi was released from his professional tryout offer with Binghamton on January 21, 2015, after posting no points and a minus-3 rating in his 2 games played with the Senators. He subsequently retired that year.\n\nBertuzzi debuted internationally for Team Canada at the 1998 World Championships in Switzerland. He was among the youngest players selected to the team, along with Canucks teammate Bryan McCabe and Chicago Blackhawks forward Eric Dazé, who were all born in 1975 (third-string goaltender Christian Bronsard was two years younger, but did not play in any games). In six games, he recorded three points, as Canada failed to qualify for the medal rounds.\n\nTwo years later, Bertuzzi competed at the 2000 World Championships in St. Petersburg, Russia. One of five Canucks players chosen to the national team, he was joined by Adrian Aucoin, Ed Jovanovski, Brendan Morrison and Peter Schaefer. His second tournament appearance was more productive, as he scored nine points in nine games – first among Canadian players and fourth overall – while also leading the tournament in penalty minutes with 47. Canada did not medal, losing to Finland in the bronze medal game by a 2–1 score. His 63 total penalty minutes from both tournament appearances set an all-time Canadian record for World Championship competitors since 1977 (when Canada resumed competing in the tournament).\n\nIn December 2005, Bertuzzi was controversially selected to play for Team Canada at the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin, Italy. His inclusion, along with that of Dany Heatley and Shane Doan, was discussed at length by the Canadian Olympic Committee (COC). The committee had concerns stemming from the Steve Moore incident and Bertuzzi's probationary status, but subsequently approved his representation of Canada at the Olympics. According to a Canadian Press article, \"[COC president] Chambers said the [unusual meeting] was prompted by some media concerns raised over the three athletes participating in the Games. The fact it took the committee so long to approve the list means there was some debate.\"\n\nBertuzzi went on to post three points (all assists) at the 2006 Olympics, tying for second in team scoring with nine other players. Canada failed to advance past the quarterfinal, losing to Russia by a 2–0 score. They finished in seventh place overall after winning gold at the previous Winter Olympics in 2002.\n\nOn February 16, 2004, during a game between Vancouver and Colorado, Avalanche center Steve Moore checked Markus Näslund in the head, causing a minor concussion and a bone chip in his elbow. Näslund missed three games as a result of the hit. In a rematch, Bertuzzi began following Moore around the ice, attempting to provoke him into another fight. With Moore ignoring him, Bertuzzi grabbed Moore's jersey from behind and punched him in the back of the head, with Moore's face hitting the ice as they both fell down. Bertuzzi, as well as several other players from both teams, landed atop Moore as he fell to the ice. Bertuzzi was assessed a match penalty and ejected from the game. Per league rules, he was also suspended indefinitely pending a ruling from league commissioner Gary Bettman.\n\nAfter lying on the ice for approximately 10 minutes, Moore was removed from the playing surface on a stretcher. He was treated for three fractured vertebrae in his neck, a grade three concussion, vertebral ligament damage, stretching of the brachial plexus nerves, and facial lacerations. He was also suffering from amnesia. Bertuzzi apologized to Moore and his family, as well as to Burke, Canucks owner John McCaw, Jr., the Canucks organization, his teammates, and the fans in a press conference two days later.\n\nOn March 11, 2004, the league ruled he would remain suspended for at least the remainder of the Canucks' season, which ultimately cost him the final 13 games of the regular season plus seven playoff games. The Canucks were additionally fined $250,000. While the following NHL season was suspended due to the 2004–05 lockout, Bertuzzi intended to play in Europe, but the International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF) extended his NHL suspension to cover their jurisdiction. Bertuzzi remained professionally inactive during the 2004–05 season. The IIHF's sanction also kept him from representing Canada in the 2004 and 2005 World Championships, as well as the 2004 World Cup.\n\nBettman scheduled a reinstatement hearing for Bertuzzi on April 26, 2005. The hearing was attended separately by Bertuzzi and Moore. Prior to the 2005–06 season, Bettman announced Bertuzzi's reinstatement on August 8, citing that \"Mr. Bertuzzi had paid a very significant price for his conduct,\" adding that he felt Bertuzzi was \"genuinely remorseful and apologetic.\" Bertuzzi's 17-month suspension caused him to miss a total of 20 games—the fourth-longest suspension in NHL history at the time. The suspension accounted for $501,926.39 in forfeited salary, as well as an approximate $350,000 in lost endorsements. On the day of his reinstatement, Team Canada's executive director, Wayne Gretzky, offered him a spot on the national team's summer orientation camp in preparation for the 2006 Winter Olympics.\n\nAfter a four-month investigation, the criminal justice branch of the Attorney General of British Columbia announced formal charges of assault causing bodily harm against Bertuzzi on June 24, 2004. With the charge, Bertuzzi faced up to one-and-a-half years in prison. Bertuzzi pleaded guilty to the assault charge on December 22 after arranging a plea bargain with prosecutors. He was given a conditional discharge requiring 80 hours of community service and one year's probation that additionally prohibited him from playing in any hockey game Moore was competing in. Under Canadian law, Bertuzzi's successful completion of his probationary period precluded him from a criminal record. Moore expressed disappointment regarding Bertuzzi's discharge and was upset that he was unable to attend the court date, having to issue a written victim statement instead. Moore's lawyer, Tim Danson, was given one day's notice of the court date following Bertuzzi's plea bargain, which he said was insufficient time for Moore to travel to Vancouver.\n\nOn February 17, 2005, Moore filed a lawsuit in a Colorado court against Bertuzzi, numerous individuals within the Canucks organization, including Brad May (Bertuzzi's teammate at the time who was quoted as saying that there would \"definitely be a price on Moore's head\" after Moore's hit on Näslund), Brian Burke, Marc Crawford, as well as the Canucks organization as a whole and the Orca Bay Sports and Entertainment company that owned the team. The lawsuit was thrown out in October 2005, as the Colorado judge ruled the case was better suited for Canadian courts, as Moore and all the defendants were Canadian citizens. Planning to appeal the decision, Danson stated publicly the following month that Moore had begun skating and doing regular workouts, but continued to suffer concussion-related symptoms.\n\nOn February 16, 2006, Moore filed another lawsuit in the Ontario Superior Court against Bertuzzi, the Canucks, and Orca Bay, seeking CAD$15 million in pecuniary damages for loss of income, CAD$1 million for aggravated damages, and CAD$2 million for punitive damages. Moore's parents, who were watching their son on television when the attack happened, also sued, seeking CAD$1.5 million for \"negligent infliction of nervous shock and mental distress\". In December 2006, Bettman and top lieutenant Bill Daly facilitated a meeting between Moore's representatives and the defendants in hopes of agreeing on an out-of-court settlement. An out-of-court settlement was reached in Moore's lawsuit in October 2014. Terms of the settlement are confidential.\n\nBertuzzi was born and raised in Sudbury, Ontario. His father, Albert Bertuzzi, is an Italian-Canadian who worked in the window-washing business. When Bertuzzi was a teenager, Albert survived a near-fatal car accident in which he was thrown from the vehicle through the windshield. His father has stated that he was proud of his own local reputation as a \"dirty player\" and referred to it as a \"Bertuzzi trait\". He has said that Bertuzzi takes after him in regards to his toughness and aggression. Bertuzzi's great-uncle, Larry Bertuzzi, is a Toronto-based lawyer who has done arbitration work for the NHL, including on the Eric Lindros trade.\n\nGrowing up, Bertuzzi played minor hockey with the Nickel Centre and Sudbury Minor Hockey programs. In 1990–91, Bertuzzi played as an underaged player in the major midget ranks with the Sudbury Capitals AAA team. Physically built as a power forward throughout his youth, he stood 6 feet and 2 inches (1.88 metres) and weighed 195 pounds (88.5 kilograms) by age 15.\n\nBertuzzi and his wife, Julie, were married in July 1996. They have two children born one-and-a-half years apart in Vancouver, a son named Tag and a daughter named Jaden. His son, Tag Bertuzzi, was drafted into the OHL by the Guelph Storm, 2nd overall in 2017. Bertuzzi is a recreational golfer and has credited the sport with allowing him to relax more as a hockey player. During his 10-game suspension from the NHL in October and November 2001, he played golf to focus his energy. Afterwards, he made it a custom to go to the driving range before every game.\n\nBertuzzi's nephew, Tyler Bertuzzi, is a hockey player for the Detroit Red Wings.\n\n\n\n\n"}

As with his kinsmen, the principal source for his life is Byrhtferth's life of Oswald of Worcester. Æthelwine founded Ramsey Abbey in 969, and Byrhtferth and Ramsey Abbey remembered him as \"Dei amicus\" (friend to God), but the monks of nearby Ely saw him as an enemy who had seized their lands.\n\nÆthelwine was a son of Æthelstan Half-King, but probably not the eldest son as his brother Æthelwald seems to have succeeded their father on his retirement in 956. Æthelwine appears to have followed Æthelwald in office from 962. He was a benefactor of the New Minster at Winchester, and of Ramsey Abbey.\n\nFollowing the death of King Edgar, Æthelwine was, with Oswald of Worcester and Dunstan, a leader among the supporters of Edgar's oldest son Edward, which placed him in opposition to his former sister-in-law Dowager Queen Ælfthryth and Ælfhere, Ealdorman of Mercia. During the anti-monastic reaction in Edward's short reign, Æthelwine is portrayed as a stalwart supporter of the monks, but the record suggests that he took advantage of the weakness of royal government to dispossess the monks of Ely of lands.\n\nFollowing the death of Ælfhere in 983, and the withdrawal of the queen-mother from court soon after the death of Bishop Æthelwald of Winchester in 984, Æthelwine became the leading lay figure at the court of the young King Æthelred. His death in 992 probably marks the beginning of Æthelred's personal reign.\n\nÆthelwine's death is recorded by the \"Anglo-Saxon Chronicle\". Byrhtferth provides more detail, reporting that, perhaps following a lengthy illness, Æthelwine was attended at his death by Germann, Abbot of Ramsey, and Ælfheah, later Archbishop of Canterbury. His remains were moved to Ramsey where the monks kept a vigil overnight before he was buried there.\n\nThe name of Æthelwine's wife is not recorded, but the names of three sons are known. Byrhtferth mentions Edwin; another son named Leofric appears to have witnessed a will in 986, while Æthelweard was killed fighting for Edmund Ironside at the battle of Ashingdon in 1016.\n\n"}
