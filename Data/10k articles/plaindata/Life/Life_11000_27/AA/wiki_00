He completed a Senior Cambridge certificate as a cub reporter at the daily newspaper, \"Utusan Melayu\", where he began his career in journalism in 1940.\n\nSamad's family is \"very conscious\" of their Javanese heritage, and Samad himself spoke English with thick Javanese accent.\n\nDuring the Japanese occupation of Malaya during World War II, Samad worked for the Japanese-supported newspaper, \"Berita Malai\". He became editor of \"Berita Malai\" when he was just 21 years old. The British, who controlled Malaysia during the colonial era, returned following the Japanese defeat and briefly imprisoned Samad. He was released after a short time and returned to work at the \"Utusan Melayu\".\n\nSamad wrote extensively in support of Malaysian independence from the United Kingdom. He often met with the Malay supporters of independence, as well as the separatists who were against Dutch rule in nearby Indonesia. For his actions, Samad was arrested by the British authorities again in 1951. He was released from prison in 1953 and again returned to work at \"Utusan Melayu\".\n\nSamad founded the People's Action Party (PAP) with Lee Kuan Yew, the future Prime Minister of Singapore. However, disagreements between Samad and both Lee and the \"Utusan Melayu\" resulted in his move to the city of Kuala Lumpur. While in Kuala Lumpur, Samad became the head of the \"Berita Harian\" newspaper and the managing editor of the New Straits Times Press (NSTP) group.\n\nSamad promoted several social causes within his writing in post-independence Malaysia. He drew attention to social inequalities within Malaysian society, called for the national standardisation of the Malay language and reported on the sometimes complex relationship between race and Malaysian politics.\n\nFor his writings on social issues, which were popular with the public, Samad was arrested in 1976 under the Internal Security Act. He was finally released from prison five years later in 1981.\n\nSamad rejoined the New Straits Times Press group following his release from prison as an editorial adviser. He retired from full-time journalism in 1988.\n\nHe was honoured for his contribution in 1992 by the King of Malaysia, who at the time was Sultan Azlan Shah of Perak. Samad also separately received the Pejuang Sastera (Literature Champion) for literature and journalism.\n\nHe was also awarded the Ramon Magsaysay Award for Journalism, Literature and Creative Communications Arts in 1994 for his efforts in support of Malaysian independence, democratic nation building and Malay cultural revival in Malaysia.\nSamad died quietly on the evening 4 September 2008, at Pantai Medical Centre in Kuala Lumpur. He succumbed from a severe lung infection and kidney failure at the age of 84. Prior to this, he had been hospitalised in the intensive care unit since 24 August 2008, due to breathing difficulties.\n\nLee Kuan Yew sent his condolences to Samad's son, describing him as able and shrewd though with an innate ability to accept changed realities. In the condolence letter, Lee said that they were friends even though they had parted company politically. When Samad wanted to visit his family in Singapore, Lee had recommended that the entry ban on Samad be lifted.\n\nSamad was survived by his children (whom he had with his first wife, Hamidah Hassan), as well as his grandchildren & great grandchildren. He had ten children during his life, eight of whom are still living. He had two sons, Hamed and Kamal, and daughters Maria, Norlin, Nuraina, Norazah, Nurazlin and Nurazrina. Maria and Nuraina (http://nursamad.blogspot.com) are former journalists and are active bloggers.\n\nHe was buried at the Muslim cemetery in Bukit Kiara, where Hamidah was also buried.\n\n\n"}

They can be a factor in aging and in the development or worsening of many degenerative diseases, such as diabetes, atherosclerosis, chronic kidney disease, and Alzheimer's disease.\n\nAnimal-derived foods that are high in fat and protein are generally AGE-rich and are prone to further AGE formation during cooking.\n\nAGEs affect nearly every type of cell and molecule in the body and are thought to be one factor in aging and some age-related chronic diseases. They are also believed to play a causative role in the vascular complications of diabetes mellitus.\n\nUnder certain pathologic conditions, such as oxidative stress due to hyperglycemia in patients with diabetes, and hyperlipidemia, AGE formation can be increased beyond normal levels. AGEs are now known to play a role as proinflammatory mediators in gestational diabetes as well.\n\nThe animal and human evidence is that significant amounts of dietary advanced glycation end-products (dAGEs) are absorbed, and that dAGEs contribute to the body's burden of AGE, and are associated with diseases such as atherosclerosis and kidney disease.\n\nIn the context of cardiovascular disease, AGEs can induce crosslinking of collagen which can cause vascular stiffening and entrapment of low-density lipoprotein particles (LDL) in the artery walls. AGEs can also cause glycation of LDL which can promote its oxidation. Oxidized LDL is one of the major factors in the development of atherosclerosis. Finally, AGEs can bind to RAGE (receptor for advanced glycation end products) and cause oxidative stress as well as activation of inflammatory pathways in vascular endothelial cells.\n\nThe formation and accumulation of advanced glycation endproducts (AGEs) has been implicated in the progression of age-related diseases. AGEs have been implicated in Alzheimer's Disease, cardiovascular disease, and stroke. The mechanism by which AGEs induce damage is through a process called cross-linking that causes intracellular damage and apoptosis. They form photosensitizers in the crystalline lens, which has implications for cataract development. Reduced muscle function is also associated with AGEs. \nAGEs have a range of pathological effects, such as:\n\nProteins are usually glycated through their lysine residues. In humans, histones in the cell nucleus are richest in lysine, and therefore form the glycated protein N(6)-Carboxymethyllysine (CML).\n\nA receptor (biochemistry) nicknamed RAGE, from receptor for advanced glycation end products, is found on many cells, including endothelial cells, smooth muscle, cells of the immune system from tissue such as lung, liver, and kidney. This receptor, when binding AGEs, contributes to age- and diabetes-related chronic inflammatory diseases such as atherosclerosis, asthma, arthritis, myocardial infarction, nephropathy, retinopathy, periodontitis and neuropathy. The pathogenesis of this process hypothesized to activation of the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) following AGE binding. NF-κB controls several genes which are involved in inflammation. \n\nIn clearance, or the rate at which a substance is removed or cleared from the body, it has been found that the cellular proteolysis of AGEs—the breakdown of proteins—produces AGE peptides and \"AGE free adducts\" (AGE adducts bound to single amino acids). These latter, after being released into the plasma, can be excreted in the urine.\nNevertheless, the resistance of extracellular matrix proteins to proteolysis renders their advanced glycation end products less conducive to being eliminated. While the AGE free adducts are released directly into the urine, AGE peptides are endocytosed by the epithelial cells of the proximal tubule and then degraded by the endolysosomal system to produce AGE amino acids. It is thought that these acids are then returned to the kidney's inside space, or lumen, for excretion.\nAGE free adducts are the major form through which AGEs are excreted in urine, with AGE-peptides occurring to a lesser extent but accumulating in the plasma of patients with chronic kidney failure.\n\nLarger, extracellularly derived AGE proteins cannot pass through the basement membrane of the renal corpuscle and must first be degraded into AGE peptides and AGE free adducts. Peripheral macrophage as well as liver sinusoidal endothelial cells and Kupffer cells\nhave been implicated in this process, although the real-life involvement of the liver has been disputed.\n\nLarge AGE proteins unable to enter the Bowman's capsule are capable of binding to receptors on endothelial and mesangial cells and to the mesangial matrix. Activation of RAGE induces production of a variety of cytokines, including TNFβ, which mediates an inhibition of metalloproteinase and increases production of mesangial matrix, leading to glomerulosclerosis and decreasing kidney function in patients with unusually high AGE levels.\n\nAlthough the only form suitable for urinary excretion, the breakdown products of AGE—that is, peptides and free adducts—are more aggressive than the AGE proteins from which they are derived, and they can perpetuate related pathology in diabetic patients, even after hyperglycemia has been brought under control.\n\nSome AGEs have an innate catalytic oxidative capacity, while activation of NAD(P)H oxidase through activation of RAGE and damage to mitochondrial proteins leading to mitochondrial dysfunction can also induce oxidative stress. A 2007 study found that AGEs could significantly increase expression of TGF-β1, CTGF, Fn mRNA in NRK-49F cells through enhancement of oxidative stress, and suggested that inhibition of oxidative stress might underlie the effect of ginkgo biloba extract in diabetic nephropathy. The authors suggested that antioxidant therapy might help prevent the accumulation of AGEs and induced damage. In the end, effective clearance is necessary, and those suffering AGE increases because of kidney dysfunction might require a kidney transplant.\n\nIn diabetics who have an increased production of an AGE, kidney damage reduces the subsequent urinary removal of AGEs, forming a positive feedback loop that increases the rate of damage. In a 1997 study, diabetic and healthy subjects were given a single meal of egg white (56 g protein), cooked with or without 100 g of fructose; there was a greater than 200-fold increase in AGE immunoreactivity from the meal with fructose.\n\nAGEs are the subject of ongoing research. There are three therapeutic approaches: preventing the formation of AGEs, breaking crosslinks after they are formed and preventing their negative effects.\n\nCompounds that have been found to inhibit AGE formation in the laboratory include Vitamin C, benfotiamine, pyridoxamine, alpha-lipoic acid, taurine, pimagedine, aspirin, carnosine, metformin, pioglitazone, and pentoxifylline.\n\nStudies in rats and mice have found that natural phenols such as resveratrol and curcumin can prevent the negative effects of the AGEs.\n\nCompounds that are thought to break some existing AGE crosslinks include Alagebrium (and related ALT-462, ALT-486, and ALT-946) and N-phenacyl thiazolium bromide. One in vitro study shows that rosmarinic acid out performs the AGE breaking potential of ALT-711.\nThere is, however, no agent known that can break down the most common AGE, glucosepane, which appears 10 to 1,000 times more common in human tissue than any other cross-linking AGE.\n\nSome chemicals, on the other hand, like aminoguanidine, might limit the formation of AGEs by reacting with 3-deoxyglucosone.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "9955511", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9955511", "title": "Aetius (philosopher)", "text": "Aetius (philosopher)\n\nAetius (; ) was a 1st- or 2nd-century AD doxographer and Eclectic philosopher.\n\nNone of Aetius' works survive today, but he solves a mystery about two major compilations of philosophical quotes. There are two extant books named \"De Placita Philosophorum\" (Περὶ τῶν ἀρεσκόντων φιλοσόφοις φυσικῶν δογμάτων, \"Opinions of the Philosophers\") and \"Eclogae Physicae\" (Ἐκλογαὶ φυσικαὶ καὶ ἠθικαί, \"Physical and Moral Extracts\"). The first of these is Pseudo-Plutarch and the second is by Stobaeus. They are clearly both abridgements of a larger work. Hermann Diels, in his great \"Doxographi Graeci\" (1879), discovered that the 5th-century theologician Theodoret had full versions of the quotes which were shortened in the abridgements. This means that Theodoret had managed to procure the original book which Pseudo-Plutarch and Stobeaus had shortened. He calls this book \"\"Aetiou tên peri areskontôn sunagôgên\" (Ἀετίου περὶ τῶν Ἀρεσκόντων Συναγωγήν)\" and therefore we ascribe the original \"Placita\" to Aetius.\n\nDiels claimed that Aetius himself was merely abridging a work which Diels (1879) called \"Oldest Tenets\" or, in Latin, \"Vetusta Placita\". Unlike Aetius, whose existence is attested by Theodoret, the \"Vetusta Placita\" is Diels' invention and is generally disregarded by modern classicists, e.g., the 1999 \"Cambridge History of Hellenistic Philosophy\".\n\nQuotes which are ascribed to Aetius in scholarly essays were actually discovered in either the abridgements of Pseudo-Plutarch or Stobaeus, or Theodoret's full quotes in rare cases, or finally one of several ancient authors who provided corrections to misquotes in one of these works.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "612467", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=612467", "title": "Alien (creature in Alien franchise)", "text": "Alien (creature in Alien franchise)\n\nThe \"Alien\" (colloquial: \"Xenomorph XX121\"; binomial: \"Internecivus raptus [\"murderous thief\"]\") is a fictional endoparasitoid extraterrestrial species that is the eponymous antagonist of the \"Alien\" film series. The species made its debut in the film \"Alien\" (1979) and reappeared in the sequels \"Aliens\" (1986), \"Alien 3\" (1992), and \"Alien Resurrection\" (1997), as well as the crossover films \"Alien vs. Predator\" (2004) and \"\" (2007).\n\nThe \"Alien\" design is credited to Swiss surrealist and artist H. R. Giger, originating in a lithograph titled \"Necronom IV\" and refined for the series' first film, \"Alien\". The practical effects for the Alien's head were designed and constructed by Italian special effects designer Carlo Rambaldi. The species' design and life cycle have been extensively augmented, sometimes inconsistently, throughout each film.\n\nSimilar creatures of a slightly different designs named the \"Deacon\" makes a brief appearance in the Ridley Scott film \"Prometheus\" (2012). Two species, one being a different but similar creature called a \"Neomorph\" and the other being a variation of the Xenomorph XX121 species appear in the sequel to \"Prometheus\", \"\" (2017), which reveals the potential origin of the species. In addition, the Alien appears in various literature and video game spin-offs from the franchises.\n\nUnlike many other extraterrestrial races in science fiction, the Aliens are not sapient \"tool-makers\"; they lack a technological civilization. They are predatory creatures with no higher goals than the propagation and self-preservation of their species. Like wasps or termites, Aliens are eusocial, with a single fertile queen breeding a caste of warriors, workers, or other specialists strains. The Aliens' biological life cycle involves traumatic implantation of endoparasitoid larvae inside living hosts; these \"chestburster\" larvae erupt from the host's body after a short incubation period, rapidly mature from juvenile into adulthood within hours, and seek out more hosts for implantation.\n\nThe script for the 1979 film \"Alien\" was initially drafted by Dan O'Bannon and Ronald Shusett. Dan O'Bannon drafted an opening in which the crew of a mining ship are sent to investigate a mysterious message on an alien planet. He eventually settled on the threat being an alien creature; however, he could not conceive of an interesting way for it to get onto the ship. Inspired after waking from a dream, Shusett said, \"I have an idea: the monster screws one of them\", planting its egg in his body, and then bursting out of his chest. Both realized the idea had never been done before, and it subsequently became the core of the film. \"This is a movie about alien interspecies rape,\" O'Bannon said in the documentary \"Alien Evolution\". \"That's scary because it hits all of our buttons.\" O'Bannon felt that the symbolism of \"homosexual oral rape\" was an effective means of discomforting male viewers.\nThe title of the film was decided late in the script's development. O'Bannon had quickly dropped the film's original title, \"Star Beast\", but could not think of a name to replace it. \"I was running through titles, and they all stank\", O'Bannon said in an interview, \"when suddenly, that word \"alien\" just came out of the typewriter at me. \"Alien\". It's a noun and it's an adjective.\" The word \"alien\" subsequently became the title of the film and, by extension, the name of the creature itself.\n\nPrior to writing the script to \"Alien\", O'Bannon had been working in France for Chilean cult director Alejandro Jodorowsky's planned adaptation of Frank Herbert's classic science-fiction novel \"Dune\". Also hired for the project was Swiss surrealist artist H. R. Giger. Giger showed O'Bannon his nightmarish, monochromatic artwork, which left O'Bannon deeply disturbed. \"I had never seen anything that was quite as horrible and at the same time as beautiful as his work\" he remembered later. The \"Dune\" film collapsed, but O'Bannon would remember Giger when \"Alien\" was greenlit, and suggested to director Ridley Scott that he be brought on to design the Alien, saying that if he were to design a monster, it would be truly original.\nAfter O'Bannon handed him a copy of Giger's book \"Necronomicon\", Scott immediately saw the potential for Giger's designs, and chose \"Necronom IV\", a print Giger completed in 1976, as the basis for the Alien's design, citing its beauty and strong sexual overtones. That the creature could just as easily have been male or female was also a strong factor in the decision to use it. \"It could just as easily fuck you before it killed you,\" said line producer Ivor Powell, \"[which] made it all the more disconcerting.\" Fox Studios were initially wary of allowing Giger onto the project, saying that his works would be too disturbing for audiences, but eventually relented. Giger initially offered to completely design the Alien from scratch, but Scott mandated that he base his work on \"Necronom IV\", saying that to start over from the beginning would be too time-consuming. Giger signed on to design the adult, egg and chestburster forms, but ultimately also designed the alien planetoid LV-426 and the Space Jockey alien vessel.\n\nGiger conceived the Alien as being vaguely human but a human in full armor, protected from all outside forces. He mandated that the creature have no eyes, because he felt that it made them much more frightening if you could not tell they were looking at you. Giger also gave the Alien's mouth a second inner set of pharyngeal jaws located at the tip of a long, tongue-like proboscis which could extend rapidly for use as a weapon. His design for the creature was heavily influenced by an aesthetic he had created and termed \"biomechanical\", a fusion of the organic and the mechanic. His mock-up of the Alien was created using parts from an old Rolls Royce car, rib bones and the vertebrae from a snake, molded with plasticine. The Alien's animatronic head, which contained 900 moving parts, was designed and constructed by special effects designer Carlo Rambaldi. Giger and Rambaldi together would win the 1980 Academy Award for Visual Effects for their design of the Alien.\nScott decided on the man-in-suit approach for creating the creature onscreen. Initially circus performers were tried, then multiple actors together in the same costume, but neither proved scary. Deciding that the creature would be scarier the closer it appeared to a human, Scott decided that a single, very tall, very thin man be used. Scott was inspired by a photograph of Leni Riefenstahl standing next to a 6'4\" (1.93 m) Nuba man. The casting director found 6'10\" (2.08 m), rail-thin graphic designer Bolaji Badejo in a local pub. Badejo went to tai chi and mime classes to learn how to slow down his movements.\n\nGiger's design for the Alien evoked many contradictory sexual images. As critic Ximena Gallardo notes, the creature's combination of sexually evocative physical and behavioral characteristics creates \"a nightmare vision of sex and death. It subdues and opens the male body to make it pregnant, and then explodes it in birth. In its adult form, the alien strikes its victims with a rigid phallic tongue that breaks through skin and bone. More than a phallus, however, the retractable tongue has its own set of snapping, metallic teeth that connects it to the castrating vagina dentata.\"\n\nThis creature is named Xenomorph XX121, and has been referred to most often onscreen, and in the credits of each film, simply as the \"Alien\". It was called an alien, and an organism, in the first film. It has also been referred to as a creature, a serpent, a beast, a dragon, a monster, a nasty, or simply, a thing. The term \"xenomorph\" (lit. \"alien form\"—from Greek \"xeno-\", which translates as either \"other\" or \"strange\", and \"-morph\", which denotes shape) was first used by the character Lieutenant Gorman in \"Aliens\" with reference to generic extraterrestrial life. The term was erroneously assumed by some fans to refer specifically to this creature, and the word was used by the producers of some merchandise. The species' binomial names are given in Latin as either \"Internecivus raptus\" (meant as \"murderous thief\") in the \"Alien Quadrilogy\" DVD or \"Lingua foeda acheronsis\" (meant as \"foul tongue from Acheron\") in some comic books. The main Alien from \"Alien vs. Predator\" is listed in the credits as \"Grid\", after a grid-like wound received during the film from a Predator's razor net. \"\" actually credits the Alien as Xenomorph, while also listing a different variety of the creature as the Neomorph. In \"The Weyland-Yutani Report\", the Alien was specifically referred to as \"Xenomorph XX121\".\n\nAs the film series has progressed, the creature's design has been modified in many ways, including differing numbers of fingers and limb joints, and variations in the design of the Alien's head.\n\nWhen standing upright, the Aliens are bipedal in form, though depending on their host species, they will either adopt a more hunched stance, or remain quadrupedal when walking or sprinting. Their overall stance and general behavior is a result of the mixture of the DNA of the embryo and the host. They have a skeletal, biomechanical appearance and are usually colored in muted shades of black, gray or bronze. Their body heat matches the ambient temperature of the environment in which they are found, so they do not radiate heat, making them indistinguishable from their surroundings through thermal imaging. In most of the films, adult Aliens are capable of running and crawling along ceilings and walls. They have great physical strength, having been shown to be capable of breaking through welded steel doors in numbers.\n\nAliens have segmented, blade-tipped tails. The sharp tip was initially a small, scorpion-like barb, but from \"Aliens\" onwards the blade design increased in size and changed in appearance to more closely resemble a slashing weapon. From \"Alien: Resurrection\" onwards, the tails have a flat ridge of spines at the base of the blade. This was introduced to help them swim convincingly, and was left intact in the subsequent crossovers. The original shooting script for \"Aliens\" and the novelization both featured a scene in which Lieutenant Gorman is \"stung\" by the barb tail and rendered unconscious; in the final cut of the movie, Gorman is knocked out by falling crates. As a weapon, the strength of the tail is very effective, having been shown to be strong enough to impale and lift a Predator with seemingly little effort.\n\nThey have elongated, cylindrical skulls, but possess no visible eyes, though in the original \"Alien\" film, the top of the creature's head was translucent, with empty, human-looking eye sockets within. In the novelization of \"Alien\", the character Ash speculates that the Xenomorphs \"see\" by way of electrical impulse, similar to a shark's lateral line. This method is illustrated in the original \"Alien vs Predator\" PC game and reused for the \"Predalien\" 28 years later. There is a cyclopean species of Xenomorph, which is the creature in its original form; it has a single large eye under its natural silicon/keratin forehead which can give the creature 180-degree vision. The Aliens' inner set of jaws are powerful enough to smash through bone and metal. How the creatures see is uncertain; in \"Alien 3\", a spherical lens was used to illustrate the Alien's point of view, so, when the film was projected anamorphically, the image exhibited severe distortion. In the novelization of the movie \"Alien\", the creature is held mesmerized by a spinning green light for several minutes.\n\nIn \"Aliens\", the adult creatures have a more textured head rather than a smooth carapace. In the commentary for \"Aliens\", it was speculated that this was part of the maturation of the creatures, as they had been alive far longer than the original Alien, although James Cameron stated that he simply left the carapace off because he liked them better that way. The smooth design of the carapace would be used again in \"Alien 3\" and \"Alien: Resurrection\", although made narrower with a longer muzzle and more prominent chin. This design would be kept in \"Alien versus Predator\", and abandoned in \"Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem\" in favor of the ribbed design.\n\nThroughout their appearances, human-spawned Aliens have been shown to have different numbers of fingers. In \"Alien\", the creature has webbed, six-fingered hands. In \"Aliens\", the number of fingers is reduced to three (two \"paired\" and a single, opposable thumb), and they are shown to be much longer and more skeletal. In \"Alien: Resurrection\", the number of digits is increased to four, with two long middle fingers and a pair of thumbs. This design is kept in the \"Alien vs. Predator\" films, though the hands were made bulkier in order to make the Aliens seem more formidable against the Predators.\n\nAliens have been alternatively portrayed as both plantigrade and digitigrade organisms, usually relative to their host. Human-spawned Aliens were usually portrayed as having humanoid hind limbs, while in \"Alien 3\", the featured Alien sported double-jointed legs due to its quadrupedal host. This characteristic would be continued in \"Alien: Resurrection\" for the human-spawned Aliens. Tom Woodruff, who had previously played the \"dog-alien\" in \"Alien 3\", described the human-spawned Aliens in \"Resurrection\" as feeling more like a dog than the previous creature, despite having been born from human hosts. The human-spawned Alien warriors would revert to a plantigrade posture in \"Alien vs. Predator\".\n\nAlien blood is an extremely potent acid and is capable of corroding almost any substance on contact with alarming speed. It is dull yellow in color, and appears to be pressurized inside the body so that it spurts out with great force when the creature is wounded. Ron Cobb suggested the idea of the Alien having acid blood as a plausible means to make the creature \"unkillable\"; if one were to use traditional firearms or explosives to attack it, its blood would eat through the hull of the ship. The \"Alien\" novelization suggests that, at least at the \"facehugger\" stage, the acid is not blood but a fluid maintained under pressure between a double layer of skin. In the \"Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem\" documentary: \"Science of the Alien\", it is hypothesized that the Aliens' acid blood could be some type of \"hydrosulphuric acid\" compound due to its corrosiveness and the conspicuously toxic effects on living human tissue. The documentary also speculates that Aliens are immune to their own acidic and toxic liquids due to an endobiological build-up, similar to the human stomach's ability to protect itself from its own digestive fluids. The documentary takes this hypothesis one step further and speculates that the Alien organisms' protection system against its own toxic hydrosulphuric acid is basically a bio-organically produced Teflon insulation. In the original \"Alien\", the facehugger is shown to be able to \"spit\" acid, dissolving the faceplate of Kane's helmet and allowing the creature immediate access inside. This ability is also exhibited by adult Aliens in \"Alien 3\" and \"Alien: Resurrection\"; much like a spitting cobra, they use it to blind and immobilize their victims.\n\nAliens can produce a thick, strong resin that they use to build their hives and to cocoon their victims, and they can use the walls of their hives as camouflage. Aliens also salivate heavily in the form of a sticky, clear slime; while not a toxic substance in and of itself, it is common for the \"Alien\" films to use it as a suspense-building device, wherein a character will notice the falling saliva before noticing its source lying in wait above them.\n\nDuring various events in \"Aliens\" on the LV-426 colony Hadley's Hope, in \"Alien: Resurrection\" on the \"USM Auriga\", and in the crossover movie \"Alien vs Predator\", the species displayed observational learning and problem-solving skills, and in the former two cases the Aliens learned how to operate machinery at a very basic level. On LV-426, they were able to cut power in a section of the complex to gain access to the humans, and the Alien queen learns to board an elevator by observing Ripley and Newt escaping in the one beside it. The novelization of the film notes that the queen establishing her \"nest\" at the base's main power plant could have been chosen either for the feral, animal reason of the warmth that it would provide or for the rational reason of selecting a location where any attackers would be unable to destroy her without destroying the entire facility. In the director's commentary for \"Aliens\", James Cameron noted that the creatures in \"Aliens\" had been alive for far longer than the Alien in the original, and had more time to learn about their environment. On the \"USM Auriga\" in \"Alien: Resurrection\", the Aliens kill one of their own, using its blood to melt through their enclosure and escape; in \"Alien vs. Predator\", they use a similar strategy to free the queen from her chains. An Alien also uses acid spurting from its severed tail as an improvised weapon, indicating they are fully aware of the effects of their acid blood.\n\nAliens are eusocial life-forms with a caste system ruled over by a queen. Their life cycle comprises several distinct stages: they begin their lives as an egg, which hatches a parasitoid larval form known as a facehugger, which then attaches itself to a living host by, as its name suggests, latching onto its face. In the \"Alien 3\" novelization, Ripley commented that this parasitoid would probably be able to use a host as small as a cat or as large as an elephant.\n\nThe facehugger then \"impregnates\" the host with an embryo, known as a \"chestburster\", which, after a period of gestation, erupts violently from the host's chest, resulting in the death of the host.\n\nThe chestburster then matures to an adult phase, shedding its skin and replacing its cells with polarized silicon. Due to horizontal gene transfer during the gestation period, the Alien also takes on some of the basic physical attributes of the host from which it was born, allowing the individual alien to adapt to the host's environment.\n\nThe adult phase of the Alien is known by various different names. The adult Aliens have been referred to as \"drones\", \"warriors\", \"workers\", and sometimes \"soldiers\", similar to the way ants have been defined. The names of the adult phase have also been used to name different types of adult phases of the Alien in numerous sources, including video games, comic books, novels, and the films, but only in the commentaries by the team who created the films. No official name has been given to the adult stage of the Alien in the films themselves.\n\nQueen Aliens are significantly larger and stronger than the normal adults, being approximately tall. Their body structure differs also, having two pairs of arms, one large and one small. The queen's head is larger than those of other adult Aliens and is protected by a large, flat crest, like a crown, which varies from queen to queen. Unlike other aliens, the queen's external mouth is separately segmented from the rest of her head, allowing her to turn her mouth left and right almost to the point where it is facing perpendicular to the direction of the rest of her head. In the second film, \"Aliens\", unlike other adults and queens, the queen had high-heel protrusions from her feet.\n\nEgg-laying Alien queens possess an immense ovipositor attached to their lower torso, similar to a queen termite's. Unlike insect queens, there appears to be no need for an Alien queen's eggs to be fertilized. When attached to her ovipositor, the queen is supported by a \"biomechanical throne\" that consists of a lattice of struts resembling massive insect legs.\n\nIn the original cut of \"Alien\", the Alien possessed a complete lifecycle, with the still-living bodies of its victims converted into eggs. However, the scene showing the crew converted into eggs was cut for reasons of pacing, leaving the ultimate origin of the eggs obscure. This allowed \"Aliens\" director James Cameron to introduce a concept he had initially conceived for a spec script called \"Mother\", a massive mother Alien queen which laid eggs and formed the basis for the Aliens' life cycle. Cameron conceived the queen as a monstrous analogue to Ripley's own maternal role in the film. In that vein, some critics have compared it to Grendel's mother.\n\nThe queen was designed by Cameron in collaboration with special effects artist Stan Winston, based upon an initial painting Cameron had done at the start of the project. The Winston Studio created a test foamcore queen before constructing the full hydraulic puppet which was used for most of the scenes involving the large Alien. Two people were inside working the twin sets of arms, and puppeteers off-screen worked its jaws and head. Although at the end of the film, the queen was presented full-body fighting the power-loader, the audience never sees the legs of the queen, save those of the small-scale puppet that appears only briefly. In \"Aliens\", Cameron used very selective camera-angles on the queen, using the 'less is more' style of photography. Subsequently, the movie won an Oscar for Visual Effects. An adult queen was to reappear in \"Alien Resurrection\". The original mechanical head previously used in \"Aliens\" was provided by Bob Burns and was an altered design. It was repainted with a blend of green and brown, giving it a shimmering, insect-like quality. This color concept would be abandoned in \"Alien vs. Predator\" in favour of the original black color scheme.\n\nIn the climax of \"Alien vs. Predator\", the queen's basic design was altered to make her more \"streamlined\" in appearance and her overall size was increased to six meters (20 feet) tall. Other changes include the removal of the \"high-heel\" protrusions on her legs, including additional spines on her head and making her waist thinner because there was no need for puppeteers inside her chest. The animatronic queen had 47 points of hydraulic motion.\n\n\"Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem\" (2007) introduced a younger form of the full-grown queen, albeit with traits inherited from its Predator host. Recalling the facehugger's method of embryo implantation, the Predalien uses its inner mouth to directly deposit multiple chestburster embryos into pregnant female hosts, also using its mandibles to latch on the faces of said hosts, completely bypassing the need for facehuggers. This is explained by the Brothers Strause as a means of quickly building an army of Aliens before the young queen evolves into its sedentary, egg-laying state.\n\nThe eggs laid by the queen are ellipsoidal, leathery objects between one-half and one meter (two and three feet) high with a four-lobed opening at the top. The eggs can remain in a stasis mode for years, possibly indefinitely, until nearby movement is detected. As a potential host approaches, the egg's lobes unfold like flower petals, and the parasitic facehugger extracts itself from the egg and attaches itself to the potential host. Giger initially designed the eggs with a much more obvious vaginal appearance, complete with an \"inner and outer vulva\". The producers complained that Catholic countries would ban the film if the allusion was too strong, so Giger doubled the lobes to four so that, in his words, \"seen from above, they would form the cross that people in Catholic countries are so fond of looking at\". The interior of the original egg was composed of \"Nottingham lace\" (caul fat), which is the lining of a cow's stomach. In the first film, the quick shot of the facehugger erupting from the egg was done with sheep's intestine. Initially, the egg remained totally stationary except for the hydraulic movement of the lobes; however, by \"Alien: Resurrection\", the entire egg was made to ripple as it opened. In Alien, the Director's Cut, an additional scene shows still living crew members being cocooned into new eggs, either morphing into a new embryo or acting as a food source for the facehugger inside the egg.\n\nA facehugger is the second stage in the Alien's life cycle. It has eight long, finger-like legs, which allow it to crawl rapidly, and a long tail adapted for making great leaps. These particular appendages give it an appearance somewhat comparable to chelicerate arthropods such as arachnids and horseshoe crabs.\n\nThe facehugger is a parasitoid; its only purpose is to make contact with the host's mouth for the implantation process by gripping its legs around the victim's head and wrapping its tail around the host's neck. Upon making contact, the facehugger administers a cynose-based paralytic in order to render it unconscious and immobile. During a successful attachment, the facehugger will insert a proboscis down the host's throat while simultaneously implanting an embryo. The host is kept alive, and the creature breathes for the host. Attempts to remove facehuggers generally prove fatal, as the parasitoid will respond by tightening its tail around the host's neck, and its acidic blood prevents it from being cut away. In addition, its grip on the host's head is strong enough to tear the host's face off if it is forcibly removed.\n\nOnce the Alien embryo is implanted, the facehugger will remain attached until the implant is secure, which can take anywhere from less than a minute to 16 hours. Once this happens, the parasite detaches, crawls away, and dies. The victim awakens with no awareness of the implantation, believing themselves to have been asleep, and appears to have a normal, healthy bodily function.\n\nAccording to \"AVPR: Science of the Xenomorph\", a behind-the-scenes documentary on \"Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem\", it is theorized that facehuggers may implant a viral agent that \"commands\" the host's cells to grow the chestburster, as opposed to an implanted embryo. This would explain how the resulting alien is able to adopt the characteristics of its host.\n\nGiger's original design for the facehugger was a much larger creature with eyes and a spring-loaded tail. Later, in response to comments from the filmmakers, Giger reduced the creature's size substantially. At first, Giger assumed that the facehugger would wrap around the outside of the astronaut's helmet, but Scott decided that it would have far more impact if the facehugger were revealed once the helmet was removed. Scott and Giger realized that the facehugger should burn through the helmet's faceplate with its acid blood; subsequent redesigns of the space helmet included a far larger faceplate to allow for this. Dan O'Bannon initially conceived the facehugger as somewhat resembling an octopus, possessing tentacles. However, when he received H. R. Giger's designs, which substituted tentacles with fingerlike digits, he found Giger's design concept to be superior. Since no one was available at the time, O'Bannon decided to design the facehugger prop himself. The technical elements of the musculature and bone were added by Ron Cobb. Giger's initial design for the smaller facehugger had the fingers facing forward, but O'Bannon's redesign shifted the legs to the side. When the foam rubber sculpture of the facehugger was produced, O'Bannon asked that it should remain unpainted, believing the rubber, which resembled human skin, was more plausible.\n\nIn \"Aliens\", the facehuggers were redesigned by Stan Winston so that they would be capable of movement. Unlike the creatures in the first film, the creatures would take a much more active role in impregnating their victims. When Ripley throws one off her, the facehugger was now capable of scuttling across the floor and leaping at its prey, wrapping its tail around the victim's throat. The facehugger is also shown to be capable of independently surviving outside of its egg. Due to the film's budget, only two fully working facehuggers were built.\n\nIn \"Alien 3\", another addition, a \"super-facehugger\" that would carry the embryo of the queen Alien, was planned, but ultimately dropped. The super-facehugger is briefly glimpsed in the Assembly cut of \"Alien 3\", but not identified as such. It made a brief appearance in the canonical \"Alien\" book called \"Alien: Sea of Sorrows\", set a while after the events of \"Alien Resurrection\", about the grandson of Ripley Clone 8, Ellen Ripley's clone.\n\nAfter implantation, facehuggers die and the embryo's host wakes up afterward, showing no considerable outward negative symptoms and a degree of amnesia regarding events at the time of implantation. Symptoms build acutely after detachment of the facehugger, the most common being sore throat, slight nausea, increased congestion, and moderate to extreme hunger. In later stages where the incubation period is extended in preparation of a queen birth, symptoms will include a shortness of breath, exhaustion, and hemorrhaging (detectable through biological scanners and present in nosebleeds or other seemingly random bleeding incidents), as well as chest pains inflicted, either in lack of chest space due to the chestburster's presence or even premature attempts to escape the host. The incubating embryo takes on some of the host's DNA or traits, such as bipedalism, quadrupedalism, possessing the mandibles of a Predator, and other structural changes. According to Weyland-Yutani scientists in \"Aliens: Colonial Marines\", the chestburster will draw nutrients from the host's body in order to develop a placenta as it grows, attaching itself to several major organs in the process. The placenta has cancerous qualities, such that even if the embryo were removed surgically, the placenta would simply cause the affected organs to shut down, resulting in death. Over the course of one to 24 hours—indeterminable in some cases, and sometimes up to a week, in the case of some queens—the embryo develops into a chestburster, at which point, it emerges, violently and fatally ripping open the chest of the host. There is no on-screen explanation of the reasons for the different incubation times. Fully-grown aliens may avoid harming species acting as hosts for un-emerged chestbursters, though this may only be in the case of a queen embryo.\n\nThe emerging alien varies in size from a guinea pig to a large dog, depending on the size and species of the host, and its appearance and adaptive characteristics are also determined by the host. Typically, its first instinct upon emerging is to flee and hide until full maturation.\n\nThe chestburster was designed by \"Alien\" director Ridley Scott and constructed by special effects artist Roger Dicken. Giger had produced a model of a chestburster that resembled a \"degenerate plucked turkey\" and was far too large to fit inside a ribcage. Much to Giger's dismay, his model reduced the production team to fits of laughter on sight. Scott drafted a series of alternative designs for the chestburster based on the philosophy of working \"back [from the adult] to the child\" and ultimately produced \"something phallic\". The chestburster in the original \"Alien\" was armless, but arms were added in \"Aliens\" to facilitate the creature crawling its way out of its host's corpse. This concept would be abandoned in \"Alien: Resurrection\", but return in \"Alien: Covenant\".\n\nWhen a chestburster erupts from the body of its host, it is less than tall. However, it soon undergoes a dramatic growth spurt, reaching adult size in a matter of hours; in \"Alien\", the chestburster had grown to in height by the time the \"Nostromo\" crew located it again. The chestburster is shown to have molted before reaching maturity. In \"Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem\", Alien warriors are shown who are still growing, showing shedding skin. In the unrated cut, the Predalien is shown wiping off its final molted skin at the film's start.\n\nAliens take on various forms depending on the characteristics of their hosts. Most of the Aliens seen to date have been human-spawned, but a number of Aliens born from other hosts have also been seen. Some of these are also a different variants or species altogether such the Neomorph and Deacon.\n\nThe \"Dog Alien\" or \"Ox Alien\", (also known as \"Runner Alien\" in the expanded universe stories) and referred to in-film as \"Dragon\", was introduced in \"Alien 3\". The creature itself shares the same basic physical configuration and instincts as the other Aliens shown in the previous films, although there are several differences due to the host it was spawned from (a dog in the theatrical cut, an ox in the DVD assembly cut). The dog Alien in its chestburster form is a miniature version of the adult, unlike the larval human- and Predator-spawned chestbursters. The adult is primarily quadrupedal, has digitigrade hind legs, and lacks the dorsal tubes of the human-spawned variety. The only differences behavior-wise was that this Alien behaved more like a dog or another quadrupedal animal that generally is prone to using its mouth instead of its front legs as its primary weapon to attack and maul its victims with its teeth. This Alien, even when actively provoked, would not attack or kill Ripley, due to the queen growing inside her. This, however, changed towards the movie's climax, at which point the monster, after surviving a torrent of molten lead, burst from the liquid and went into a rampage, pursuing Ripley and presumably attempting to kill her until she destroyed it by showering it with freezing water, causing it to explode from thermal shock.\n\nOriginally, H. R. Giger was approached on July 28, 1990, by David Fincher and Tim Zinnemann, and was asked to redesign his own creations for \"Alien 3\". Giger's new designs included an aquatic face-hugger and a four-legged version of the adult Alien. Giger said in an interview \"I had special ideas to make it more interesting. I designed a new creature, which was much more elegant and beastly, compared to my original. It was a four-legged Alien, more like a lethal feline—a panther or something. It had a kind of skin that was built up from other creatures—much like a symbiosis.\" However, when Tom Woodruff and Alec Gillis of Amalgamated Dynamics told Giger that they had their own design, Giger expressed himself as \"very upset\" and that the creature he had especially designed was his \"baby\". Even after the production severed contact, Giger continued to fax suggestions to Fincher and made full-scale drawings and a sculpt of the Alien, all of which were rejected.\n\nGiger would later be angered by the end credits of the released film presenting him as merely the creator of the original creature, and the fact that ADI personnel gave a series of interviews that minimized Giger's contribution. Fox eventually reimbursed Giger, but only after he refused to be interviewed for their behind-the-scenes documentary of \"Alien 3\".\n\nHowever, Giger would comment that he thought the resulting film was \"okay\" and that the Alien was \"better than in the second film\".\n\nIn \"Alien Resurrection\", due to significant genetic tampering in an attempt to recover DNA from the deceased Ellen Ripley and the Alien queen within her, the resulting cloned Aliens show a number of minor human traits. The cloned queen inherits a perversion of a human womb, and as a result, it ceases to lay eggs and gives birth to a humanoid mutant hybrid. Physically, the human/Alien Newborn is very different from other alien young, being larger, with pale, translucent skin, a skull-shaped face with eyes, a human tongue, and a complete absence of a tail. The Newborn fails to bond with its Alien queen mother, killing it, and imprinting on the Ripley clone instead.\n\nThe Newborn creature was originally scripted by Joss Whedon as being an eyeless, ivory-white quadruped with red veins running along the sides of its head. It had an inner jaw, with the addition of a pair of pincers on the sides of its head. These pincers would have been used to immobilize its prey as it drained it of blood through the inner jaw. The creature was originally going to rival the queen in size, but Jean-Pierre Jeunet asked ADI to make the human/Alien hybrid, known as the Newborn, more human than Alien. The Newborn's eyes and nose were added to improve its expressions to make it a character, rather than just a \"killing machine\", and give it depth as a human-like creature.\n\nThis variation is the result of a facehugger impregnating a Predator. The \"Predalien\" was first depicted in a painting by Dave Dorman, and subsequently featured in the \"Aliens versus Predator\" comics and games. A Predalien chestburster debuted in the final scene of \"Alien vs. Predator\" (2004), but did not make a film appearance until \"\" (2007).\n\nThe Predalien shares many characteristics with its hosts, such as long hair-like appendages, mandibles, skin color, and similar vocalizations. It is a large, bulky creature, and possesses physical strength greater than that of human-spawned Aliens. Like human-born Aliens, it is also shown to be stronger than its host species, as evidenced by its ability to pin, push, and knock a Predator away with ease.\n\nThe dark-blue Deacon is a different species that makes an appearance in \"Prometheus\", though it clearly shares traits similar to the Xenomorph, including a similar life-cycle. The Deacon is the result of a Trilobite, which is a large facehugger-like creature, attacking and impregnating an Engineer. After some time, it will burst out of its host, with the notable difference that it is \"born\" almost fully developed in regards to its limbs and structure. Its fate is unknown, though the tie-in comic book \"Prometheus: Fire and Stone\", also set on LV-223, features a mutated mountain, with acidic veins which are implied to be the heavily mutated Deacon.\n\nThe pale-white Neomorph is featured in \"\". It was created through exposure to spores found growing on the Engineer homeworld. The embryonic Neomorph then gestates inside the host until it bursts out of its host's back, throat, or possibly other areas, using mostly its head, which is sharp and pointed, similar to the Deacon. Like the Xenomorph, the Neomorph has a tail which is strong enough to tear off a human jaw. The Neomorph is a less weaponized version of the Xenomorph and lacks the facial features and biomechanical traits of the latter. The Neomorph is far more feral than the traditional Xenomorph; they are voracious predators, often eating the corpses of their victims. Unlike the Xenomorph, the Neomorph appears to lack a hive structure since they propagate through mutated animal life.\n\nIn the years since the release of \"Alien\", the Alien has become one of the world's most recognized movie monsters and a popular-cultural icon. In 2003, the Alien was voted as the 14th most memorable screen villain by the American Film Institute.\nBlondie co-founder Chris Stein, who was a friend of Giger, pondered in an interview:\n\n\"I'd like to see someone even vaguely compile how many versions of the Alien are floating around the world in models and stuff; there must be close to 100,000–little toys, things. All the Japanese horror comics just plunder his style.\"\n\nExamples of Alien-inspired works include the classic video games \"Contra\" and \"Metroid\". The Aliens (both grown-up versions and facehuggers) also appear in the second-last stage of and as a boss figure in \"Mega Turrican\".\n\nIn the classic parody film \"Spaceballs\", in the final sequence, a chestbuster is born in a space restaurant and starts dancing and singing, while the 2009 film \"Planet 51\" features small dog-like Xenomorphs with acid urine.\n\nHeinrich, the final boss in the 2001 comedic video game \"Conker's Bad Fur Day\" (and its 2005 remake \"\"), is a parody of the Alien queen as it appeared in \"Aliens\". Heinrich not only looks very similar to the queen in design, but the reference is further alluded when Conker uses a yellow, mechanical exoskeleton to defeat it, as well as using the line \"Get away from her, you bitch!\" as Heinrich looked down upon Berri's body, which is a direct reference to Ellen Ripley battling the queen during the film's final act.\n\nThe Aliens have appeared in many crossovers (including a large number of intercompany crossovers) in comic books and other media such as novels, toys, and video games. The largest of these crossovers is the \"Alien vs. Predator\" franchise, in which the Aliens battle the Predators. This was an idea that came to comic book artist Chris Warner in early 1989. He and other people at Dark Horse Comics were trying to come up with a good character combo for a new comics series. Dark Horse had been publishing \"Aliens\" comic book under license from 20th Century Fox since 1987. In 1990, the first depiction of the idea in film appeared in \"Predator 2\", when an Alien skull, sculpted by Kevin Hudson, appeared as one of the trophies in the Predator spacecraft.\n\nIn the 1995 film \"Toy Story\", one of the games at Pizza Planet, Whack-a-Alien, features aliens similar to the chestbursters.\n\nBecause Dark Horse possessed the rights to the franchise in comics, it has been able to feature likenesses of the alien in its other licensed comic books. For example, it did this in a mini-issue of \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season Nine\" which was billed in the media as an \"Alien\" crossover and an \"Animaniacs\" episode also featured it. A variation of the alien appears in the \"Regular Show\" episode Terror Tales of the Park VI in the \"Alien Roommate\" segment. A new variation of an Alien is featured as a guest character in the 2015 fighting game \"Mortal Kombat X\", opposite the Predator. This version uses retractable blades in its arms, similar to \"Mortal Kombat\"s Tarkatan species, due to having strains of Tarkatan's DNA.\n\nA variant of the Xenomorph facehuggers makes a guest appearance in the Japanese light novel franchise \"Gate: Jieitai Kano Chi nite, Kaku Tatakaeri\".\n\nGiger's Alien was iconic enough to have an audio-animatronic version of it appear in The Great Movie Ride at Disney's Hollywood Studios at Walt Disney World. The Alien appeared with the attraction's opening in 1989 until the rides closure in 2017. An \"Alien\"-based attraction at the Magic Kingdom entered early development stages before being reworked into ExtraTERRORestrial Alien Encounter. The Alien has a brief cameo in an episode of \"Zig and Sharko\".\n\n\n"}

It features an ensemble cast including Ethan Hawke, Josh Hamilton, Vincent Spano, Bruce Ramsay, John Haymes Newton, Illeana Douglas, and Danny Nucci. One of the survivors, Nando Parrado (portrayed by Hawke in the film), served as the technical advisor for the film.\n\nThe film opens with a collection of photographs of the Stella Maris College's Old Christians Rugby Team. Carlitos Páez points out several members of the team and reflects on the accident in a brief monologue.\n\nUruguayan Air Force Flight 571 flies over the Andes on October 13, 1972. The raucous rugby players and a few of their relatives and friends are eagerly looking forward to an upcoming match in Chile.\n\nUpon emerging from clouds, the plane encounters turbulence and collides with a mountain. The wings and tail are separated from the fuselage, which slides down a mountain slope before coming to a stop. Six passengers and one flight attendant are ejected from the plane and die. Antonio, the team captain, coordinates efforts to help the injured. Roberto Canessa and Gustavo Zerbino, both medical students, aid the injured. Another six passengers soon die, including both pilots and Nando's mother, Eugenia. Nando, who sustained a head injury, falls into a coma, and his sister Susana has suffered harsh internal injuries.\n\nAs the sun sets, the survivors make preparations for the night. Canessa discovers that the seat covers can be unzipped and used as blankets. The survivors go inside the fuselage and curl up beside one another to stay warm. Antonio, Roy Harley, and Rafael Cano plug the gaping hole at the end of the fuselage with luggage to keep out the wind. Two passengers die overnight. With nothing to hunt or gather on the mountain, Antonio declares they will use rationing when the survivors find a tin of chocolates and a case of wine. After seeing a plane fly past, they think it dips its wing, and the survivors celebrate. Expecting to be rescued the next day, everyone except Javier, his wife Liliana, and Antonio eat the remaining chocolates. This causes a quarrel among Antonio and several others.\n\nNando regains consciousness. After learning of his mother's death, Nando watches over Susana vigilantly. Knowing she will die of her injuries within a few days, he vows to set off on foot and find a way out of the mountains. When Carlitos reminds him that he will need food, Nando suggests eating the flesh of the deceased pilots to give him the strength to survive the journey to find help. Susana dies from her injuries. The survivors listen to a radio for word of their rescue but are devastated to hear the search called off after nine days.\n\nAfter great debate, the starving passengers decide to eat the flesh of their dead relatives and friends. Zerbino, Rafael, and Juan Martino set off to search for the tail of the plane in hopes of finding batteries for the plane's radio to transmit their location. Among pieces of the wreckage, the teammates find additional corpses, but return to the group with news that the tail of the plane is likely a little farther away. Later in the week, an avalanche strikes the plane and fills much of the interior with snow. Eight of the survivors are smothered by the snow or freeze to death. A second team, made up of Nando, Canessa, and Antonio \"Tintin\" Vizintin, sets out and find the tail of the plane. Unable to bring the batteries to the fuselage, they return to the fuselage to get Roy, who is thought to have experience with electrical equipment. They bring him to the tail of the plane to see whether he can fix the radio. When Roy is unsuccessful, the team returns to the fuselage.\n\nFederico and Alberto die from their injuries, as does Rafael, leading Nando to convince a reluctant Canessa to search for a way out of the mountains, taking Tintin with them. Two days into the journey, they send Tintin back to the fuselage so they can appropriate his rations and continue on their own. After a 12-day trek, the two escape the mountains and alert the authorities of their companions' location. As helicopters land on the mountain, the remaining 14 survivors celebrate.\n\nIn the present, Carlitos describes how the survivors later returned to the site of the crash and buried the corpses under a pile of stones, marked with a cross. The memorial to the 29 deceased and 16 survivors is shown.\n\nRotten Tomatoes, a review aggregator, reports that 64% of 25 surveyed critics gave the film a positive review; the average rating is 6.3/10.\n\nDavid Ansen of \"Newsweek\" said that, while, \"Piers Paul Read's acclaimed book ... paid special attention to the social structure that evolved among the group ... Marshall ... downplays the fascinating sociological details—and the ambiguities of character—in favor of action, heroism and a vague religiosity that's sprinkled over the story like powdered sugar.\"\n\nOthers, such as Ray Green, praised the tactful nature of the film stating that, \"despite the potential for lurid sensationalism, Marshall manages to keep his and the film's dignity by steering an effectively downbeat course through some grim goings on thanks in no small manner to the almost allegorical ring of Shanley's stylized dialogue.\" Green continues by describing the film as, \"thrilling and engrossing as it is at times, \"Alive\" is more than an action film—in its own way it is also a drama of ideas, and of the human spirit as well.\"\n\nRoger Ebert wrote \"There are some stories you simply can't tell. The story of the Andes survivors may be one of them.\" He also questioned the realism of how normal the actors' bodies looked after portraying two months of near starvation.\n\nA companion documentary, \"\", was released at the same time as the film. It includes interviews with the survivors, as well as documentary footage of the rescue. The 30th Anniversary Edition of \"Alive: The Miracle of the Andes\" (on DVD) includes this documentary in the \"Extras\" section.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "52875786", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=52875786", "title": "Chinese alchemical elixir poisoning", "text": "Chinese alchemical elixir poisoning\n\nIn Chinese alchemy, elixir poisoning refers to the toxic effects from elixirs of immortality that contained metals and minerals such as mercury and arsenic. The official \"Twenty-Four Histories\" record numerous Chinese emperors, nobles, and officials who died from taking elixirs in order to prolong their lifespans. The first emperor to die from elixir poisoning was likely Qin Shi Huang (d. 210 BCE) and the last was Yongzheng (d. 1735). Despite common knowledge that immortality potions could be deadly, fangshi and Daoist alchemists continued the elixir-making practice for two millennia.\nThe etymology of English elixir derives from Medieval Latin \"elixir\", from Arabic إكسير (\"al-ʾiksīr\"), probably from Ancient Greek ξήριον (\"xḗrion\" \"a desiccative powder for wounds\"). \"Elixir\" originated in medieval European alchemy meaning \"A preparation by the use of which it was sought to change metals into gold\" (elixir stone or philosopher's stone) or \"A supposed drug or essence with the property of indefinitely prolonging life\" (elixir of life). The word was figuratively extended to mean \"A sovereign remedy for disease. Hence adopted as a name for quack medicines\" (e.g., Daffy's Elixir) and \"The quintessence or soul of a thing; its kernel or secret principle\". In modern usage, \"elixir\" is a pharmaceutical term for \"A sweetened aromatic solution of alcohol and water, serving as a vehicle for medicine\" (\"Oxford English Dictionary\", 2nd ed., 2009). Outside of Chinese cultural contexts, English \"elixir poisoning\" usually refers to accidental contamination, such as the 1937 elixir sulfanilamide mass poisoning in the United States.\n\n\"Dān\" 丹 \"cinnabar; vermillion; elixir; alchemy\" is the keyword for Chinese immortality elixirs. The red mineral cinnabar (\"dānshā\" 丹砂 lit. \"cinnabar sand\") was anciently used to produce the pigment vermilion (\"zhūhóng\" 朱紅) and the element mercury (\"shuǐyín\" 水銀 \"watery silver\" or \"gǒng\" 汞).\n\nAccording to the \"ABC Etymological Dictionary of Old Chinese\", the etymology of Modern Standard Chinese \"dān\" from Old Chinese \"*tān\" (< *\"tlan\" ?) 丹 \"red; vermillion; cinnabar\", \"gān\" 矸 in \"dāngān\" 丹矸 from *\"tân-kân\" (< *\"tlan-klan\" ?) \"cinnabar; vermillion ore\", and \"zhān\" from *\"tan\" 旃 \"a red flag\" derive from Proto-Kam-Sui *\"h-lan\" \"red\" or Proto-Sino-Tibetan *\"tja-n\" or *\"tya-n\" \"red\". The *\"t-\" initial and *\"t-\" or *\"k-\" doublets indicate that Old Chinese borrowed this item. (Schuessler 2007: 204).\nAlthough the word \"dan\" 丹 \"cinnabar; red\" frequently occurs in oracle script from the late Shang Dynasty (c. 1600–1046 BCE) and bronzeware script and seal script from the Zhou Dynasty (1045–256 BCE), paleographers disagree about the graphic origins of the logograph 丹 and its ancient variants 𠁿 and 𠕑. Early scripts combine a 丶 dot or ⼀ stroke (depicting a piece of cinnabar) in the middle of a surrounding frame, which is said to represent: \n\nMany Chinese elixir names are compounds of \"dan\", such as \"jīndān\" 金丹 (with \"gold\") meaning \"golden elixir; elixir of immortality; potable gold\" and \"xiāndān\" 仙丹 (with \"Daoist immortal\") \"elixir of immortality; panacea\", and \"shéndān\" 神丹 (with \"spirit; god\") \"divine elixir\". \"Bùsǐ zhī yào\" 不死之藥 \"drug of deathlessness\" was another early name for the elixir of immortality. Chinese alchemists would \"liàndān\" 煉丹 (with \"smelt; refine\") \"concoct pills of immortality\" using a \"dāndǐng\" 丹鼎 (with \"tripod cooking vessel; cauldron\") \"furnace for concocting pills of immortality\". In addition, the ancient Chinese believed that other substances provided longevity and immortality, notably the \"língzhī\" 靈芝 \"\"Ganoderma\" mushroom\".\n\nThe transformation from chemistry-based \"waidan\" 外丹 \"external elixir/alchemy\" to physiology-based \"neidan\" 內丹 \"internal elixir/alchemy\" gave new analogous meanings to old terms. The human body metaphorically becomes a \"ding\" \"cauldron\" in which the adept forges the Three Treasures (essence, life-force, and spirit) within the \"jindan\" Golden Elixir within the \"dāntián\" 丹田 (with \"field\") \"lower part of the abdomen\".\n\nIn early China, alchemists and pharmacists were one and the same. Traditional Chinese medicine also used less concentrated cinnabar and mercury preparations, and \"dan\" means \"pill; medicine\" in general, for example, \"dānfāng\" 丹方 semantically changed from \"prescription for elixir of immortality\" to \"medical prescription\". \"Dan\" was lexicalized into medical terms such as \" dānjì\" 丹劑 \"pill preparation\" and \"dānyào\" 丹藥 \"pill medicine\".\n\nThe Chinese names for immortality elixirs have parallels in other cultures and languages, for example, Indo-Iranian \"soma\" or \"haoma\", Sanskrit \"amrita\", and Greek \"ambrosia\".\n\nIn Chinese history, the alchemical practice of concocting elixirs of immortality from metallic and mineral substances began circa the 4th century BCE in the late Warring states period, reached a peak in the 9th century CE Tang dynasty when five emperors died, and, despite common knowledge of the dangers, elixir poisoning continued until the 18th century Qing dynasty.\n\nThe earliest mention of alchemy in China occurs in connection with \"fangshi\" (\"masters of the methods\") specialists in cosmological and esoteric arts employed by rulers from the 4th century BCE (De Woskin 1981: 19).\n\nThe 3rd-century BCE \"Zhanguo Ce\" and \"Han Feizi\" both record a story about King Qingxiang of Chu (r. 298–263 BCE) being presented a \"busi zhi yao\" 不死之藥 \"immortality medicine\". As the chamberlain was taking the elixir into the palace, a guard asked if it was edible and when he answered yes, the guard grabbed and ate it. The king was angered and condemned the guard to death. A friend of the guard tried to persuade the king, saying, \"After all the guard did ask the chamberlain whether it could be eaten before he ate it. Hence the blame attaches to the chamberlain and not to him. Besides what the guest presented was an elixir of life, but if you now execute your servant after eating it, it will be an elixir of death (and the guest will be a liar). Now rather than killing an innocent officer in order to demonstrate a guest's false claim, it would be better to release the guard.\" This logic convinced the king to let the guard live (Needham and Ho 1970: 316).\n\nQin Shi Huang, the founder of the Qin dynasty (221–206 BCE), feared death and spent the last part of his life seeking the elixir of life, and reportedly died from elixir poisoning (Wright 2001: 49). The first emperor also sent Xu Fu to sail an expeditionary fleet into the Pacific in order to find the legendary Mount Penglai where the \"busi zhi shu\" 不死之樹 \"tree of deathlessness\" grew, but they never returned.\n\nInterest in elixirs of immortality increased during the Han dynasty (206 BC–220 AD). Emperor Wu (156–87 BCE) employed many \"fangshi\" alchemists who claimed they could produce the legendary substance. The \"Book of Han\" says that around 133 BCE the \"fangshi\" Li Shaojun said to Emperor Wu, \"Sacrifice to the stove [\"zao\" 竈] and you will be able to summon ' things ' [i.e. spirits]. Summon spirits and you will be able to change cinnabar powder into yellow gold. With this yellow gold you may make vessels to eat and drink out of. You will then increase your span of life. Having increased your span of life, you will be able to see the [\"xian\" 仙] of [Penglai] that is in the midst of the sea. Then you may perform the sacrifices \"feng\" [封] and \"shan\" [禅], and escape death.\" (tr. Waley 1930: 2).\n\nWei Boyang's c. 142 \"Cantong qi\", which is regarded as the oldest complete alchemical book extant in any culture, influenced developments in elixir alchemy. It listed mercury and lead as the prime ingredients for elixirs, which limited later potential experiments and resulted in numerous cases of poisoning. It is quite possible that \"many of the most brilliant and creative alchemists fell victim to their own experiments by taking dangerous elixirs\" (Needham et al. 1976: 74). There is a famous story about animal testing of elixirs by Wei Boyang. Wei entered the mountains to prepare the elixir of immortality, accompanied by three disciples, two of whom were skeptical. When the alchemy was completed he said, \"Although the gold elixir is now accomplished we ought first to test it by feeding it to a white dog. If the dog can fly after taking it then it is edible for man; if the dog dies then it is not.\" The dog fell over and died, but Wei and his disciple Yu took the medicine and immediately died, after which the two cautious disciples fled. Wei and Yu later revived, rejoiced in their faith, took more of the elixir and became immortals (Needham and Ho 1970: 322).\n\nElixir ingestion is first mentioned in the c. 81 BCE \"Discourses on Salt and Iron\" (Pregadio 2000: 166).\n\nDuring the turbulent Six dynasties period (220–589), self-experimentation with drugs became commonplace, and many people tried taking poisonous elixirs of immortality as well as the psychoactive drug Cold-Food Powder. At this time, Daoist alchemists began to record the often fatal side effects of elixirs. In an unusual case of involuntary elixir poisoning, Empress Jia Nanfeng (257–300) was forced to commit suicide by drinking \"jinxiaojiu\" 金屑酒 \"wine with gold fragments\" (Needham and Ho 1970: 326).\n\nThe Daoist scholar Ge Hong's c. 320 \"Baopuzi\" lists 56 chemical preparations and elixirs, 8 of which were poisonous, with visions from mercury poisoning the most commonly reported symptom (Needham et al. 1976: 89–96).\n\nThe individuals who experimented with Six Dynasties alchemy often had different understandings and intentions. A single alchemical formula could be interpreted as being \"suicidal, therapeutic, or symbolic and contemplative\", and its implementation might be \"a unique, decisive event or a repeated, ritual phantasmagoria\" (Strickmann 1979: 192).\n\nEmperor Ai of Jin (r. 361–365) died at the age of twenty-five, as the result of his desire to avoid growing old. The \"Book of Jin\" says the emperor practiced \"bigu\" \"grain avoidance\" and consumed alchemical elixirs, but was poisoned from an overdose and \"no longer knew what was going on around him\" (Needham and Ho 1970: 317). In a sardonic sense, the emperor fulfilled his desire since the elixir \"did actually prevent him from growing any older\" (Ho 2000: 184).\n\nEmperor Daowu (r. 371–409), founder of the Northern Wei dynasty, was cautiously interested in alchemy and used condemned criminals for clinical trials of immortality elixirs (like Mithridates VI of Pontus r. 120–63 BCE) . The \"Book of Wei\" records that in 400, he instituted the office of the Royal Alchemist, built an imperial laboratory for the preparation of drugs and elixirs, and reserved the Western mountains for the supply of firewood (used in the alchemical furnaces). \"Furthermore, he ordered criminals who had been sentenced to death to test (the products) against their will. Many of them died and (the experiments gave) no decisive result.\" (tr. Needham and Ho 1970: 321).\n\nMany texts from the Six dynasties period specifically warned about the toxicity of elixirs. For instance, the Shangqing School Daoist pharmacologist Tao Hongjing's 499 \"Zhen'gao\" (真誥, Declarations of the Perfected) describes taking a White Powder elixir.\nWhen you have taken a spatulaful of it, you will feel an intense pain in your heart, as if you had been stabbed there with a knife. After three days you will want to drink, and when you have drunk a full \"hu\" 斛 [about 50 liters] your breath will be cut off. When that happens, it will mean that you are dead. When your body has been laid out, it will suddenly disappear, and only your clothing will remain. Thus you will be an immortal released in broad daylight by means of his waistband. If one knows the name of the drug [or, perhaps, the secret names of its ingredients] he will not feel the pain in his heart, but after he has drunk a full \"hu\" he will still die. When he is dead, he will become aware that he has left his corpse below him on the ground. At the proper time, jade youths and maidens will come with an azure carriage to take it away. If one wishes to linger on in the world, he should strictly regulate his drinking during the three days when he feels the pain in his heart. This formula may be used by the whole family. (tr. Strickmann 1979: 137–138) \nWithin this context, Strickmann says a prospective Daoist alchemist must have been strongly motivated by faith and a firm confidence in his posthumous destiny, in effect, \"he would be committing suicide by consecrated means.\" Tao Hongjing's disciple Zhou Ziliang 周子良 (497–516) had repeated visions of Maoshan divinities who said his destiny was to become an immortal, and instructed him to commit ritual suicide with a poisonous elixir composed of mushrooms and cinnabar (Strickmann 1994: 40). In 517, Tao edited the \"Zhoushi mingtong ji\" 周氏冥通記 (Records of Mr. Zhou's Communications with the Unseen) detailing his disciples visions.\n\nThe Liang dynasty founder Emperor Wu (r. 502–549) was cautious about taking elixirs of immortality. He and Tao Hongjing were old friends, and the \"History of the Southern Dynasties\" says the emperor requested him to study elixir alchemy. After Tao had learned the secret art of making elixirs, he was worried about the shortage of materials. \"So the emperor supplied him with gold, cinnabar, copper sulphate, realgar, and so forth. When the process was accomplished the elixirs had the appearance of frost and snow and really did make the body feel lighter. The emperor took an elixir and found it effective.\" (tr. Needham et al. 1976: 120). Tao spent his last years working on different elixirs and presented three to the emperor, who had refused immortality elixirs from Deng Yu 鄧郁 (who claimed to have lived 30 years without food, only consuming pieces of mica in stream water).\n\nEmperor Wenxuan (r. 550–559) of the Northern Qi dynasty was an early skeptic about immortality elixirs. He ordered alchemists to make the \"jiuhuan jindan\" 九還金丹 (Ninefold Cyclically Transformed Elixir), which he kept in a jade box, and explained, \"I am still too fond of the pleasures of the world to take flight to the heavens immediately—I intend to consume the elixir only when I am about to die.\" (tr. Needham and Ho 1970: 320).\n\nAt least five Tang dynasty (618–907) emperors were incapacitated and killed by immortality elixirs. In the 9th century Tang imperial order of succession, two father-son emperor pairs died from elixirs: first Xianzong (r. 805–820) and Muzong (r. 820–824), then Wuzong (r. 840–846) and Xuanzong (r. 847–859). In historic recurrences, the newly enthroned emperor understandably executed the Daoist alchemists whose elixirs had killed his father, and then subsequently came to believe in other charlatans enough to consume their poisonous elixirs (Ho 2000: 184).\n\nEmperor Xianzong (r. 805–820) indirectly lost his life due to elixir poisoning. The \"Xu Tongzhi\" (Supplement to the Historical Collections) says, \"Deluded by the sayings of the alchemists, [Xianzong] ingested gold elixirs and his behaviour became very abnormal. He was easily offended by those officials whom he daily met, and thus the prisons were left with little vacant space.\" (tr. Needham and Ho 1970: 317). In response, an official wrote an 819 memorial to the throne that said:\nOf late years, however, (the capital) has been overrun by a host of pharmacists and alchemists ... recommending one another right and left with ever wilder and more extravagant claims. Now if there really were immortals, and scholars possessing the Tao, would they not conceal their names and hide themselves in mountain recesses far from the ken of man? ... The medicines of the sages of old were meant to cure bodily illnesses, and were not meant to be taken constantly like food. How much less so these metallic and mineral substances which are full of burning poison! ... Of old, as the \"Li Chi\" says, when the prince took physic, his minister tasted it first, and when a parent was sick, his son did likewise. Ministers and sons are in the same position. I humbly pray that all those persons who have elixirs made from transformed metals and minerals, and also those who recommend them, may be compelled to consume (their own elixirs) first for the space of one year. Such an investigation will distinguish truth from falsehood, and automatically clarify the matter by experiment. (abridged, tr. Needham and Ho 1970: 318) \nAfter the emperor rejected this appeal, the palace eunuchs Wang Shoucheng and Chen Hongzhi 陳弘志 assassinated him in 820.\n\nWhen Xianzong's son and successor Emperor Muzong (r. 820–824) came to the throne, he executed the alchemists who had poisoned his father, but later began to take immortality elixirs himself. An official wrote Muzong an 823 memorial that warned:\nMedicines are for use against illnesses, and should not be taken as food. … Even when one is ill medicines must be used with great circumspection; how much more so when one is not ill. If this is true for the common people how much more so will it be for the emperor! Your imperial predecessor believed the nonsense of the alchemists and thus became ill; this your majesty already knows only too well. How could your majesty still repeat the same mistake? (tr. Needham and Ho 1970: 319) \nThe emperor appreciated this reasoning but soon afterwards fell ill and died from poisoning. Palace eunuchs supposedly used poisonous elixirs to assassinate Muzong's young successor Emperor Jingzong (r. 824–827) (Needham et al. 1976: 151, 182).\n\nThe next Tang emperor to die from elixir poisoning was Wuzong (r. 840–846). According to the \"Old Book of Tang\", \"The emperor [Wuzong] favoured alchemists, took some of their elixirs, cultivated the arts of longevity and personally accepted (Taoist) talismans. The medicines made him very irritable, losing all normal self-control in joy or anger; finally when his illness took a turn for the worse he could not speak for ten days at a time.\" Chancellor Li Deyu and others requested audiences with the emperor, but he refused and subsequently died in 846 (Needham and Ho 1970: 319).\n\nWuzong's successor Emperor Xuānzong (r. 846–849) astonishingly also died of elixir poisoning. Xuānzong made himself the patron of some Daoists who concocted immortality elixirs of vegetable origin, possibly because his father Wuzong had died from metallic and mineral elixir poisoning (Needham et al. 1976: 146). The \"New Book of Tang\" records that the emperor received a wine tincture of ivy (常春藤, \"Hedera helix\") that the Daoist adept Jiang Lu 姜攎 claimed would turn white hair black and provide longevity. However, when the emperor heard that many people died a violent death after drinking ivy tincture, he stopped taking it. Jiang was publicly shamed and the emperor granted his request to search in the mountains for the right plant, but he never appeared again (Needham et al. 1976: 147). According to the 890 \"Dongguan zuoji\" (Record of Memorials from the Eastern Library), \"A medical official, Li [Xuanbo], presented to the emperor [Xuanzong] cinnabar which had been heated and subdued by fire, in order to gain favour from him. Thus the ulcerous disease of the emperor was all attributable to his crime.\" (tr. Needham and Ho 1970: 319).\n\nBesides emperors, many Tang literati were interested in alchemy. Both Li Bai (Waley 1950: 55–56) and Bai Juyi (Ho, Goh, and Parker 1974) wrote poems about the \"Cantong qi\" and alchemical elixirs. Other poets, including Meng Haoran, Liu Yuxi, and Liu Zongyuan also referred to elixir compounding in their works (Pregadio 2000: 171).\n\nThe influential Tang physician and alchemist Sun Simiao's c. 640 alchemical \"Taiqing zhenren dadan\" 太清真人大丹 (Great Purity Essentials of Elixir Manuals for Oral Transmission) recommends 14 elixir formulas he found successful, most of which seem poisonous, containing mercury and lead, if not arsenic, as ingredients (Needham et al. 1976: 133). Sun's medical c. 659 \"Qianjin yifang\" 千金要方 (Supplement to the Thousand Golden Remedies) categorically states that mercury, realgar, orpiment, sulphur, gold, silver, and vitriol are poisonous, but prescribed them in much larger amounts for elixirs than for medicines. In contrast to drinking soluble arsenic (as in groundwater), when powdered arsenic is eaten \"astonishing degrees of tolerance can be achieved\", and Sun Simiao might have thought that when human beings reached to a level \"approaching that of the immortals their bodies would no longer be susceptible to poison\" (Needham et al. 1976: 135).\n\nTang alchemists were well aware of elixir poisoning. The c. 8th–9th century \"Zhenyuan miaodao yaolüe\" 真元妙道要略 (Synopsis of the Essentials of the Mysterious Dao of the True Origin) lists 35 common mistakes in elixir preparation: cases where people died from eating elixirs made from cinnabar, mercury, lead, and silver; cases where people suffered from boils on the head and sores on the back by ingesting cinnabar prepared by roasting together mercury and sulphur, and cases where people became seriously ill through drinking melted \"liquid lead\" (Needham and Ho 1970: 330). The c. 850 \"Xuanjie lu\" 玄解錄 (Record of Mysterious Antidotes)—which is notable as the world's oldest printed book on a scientific subject—recommends a potent herbal composition that serves both as an elixir and as an antidote for common elixir poisoning (Needham and Ho 1970: 335). The procedure to make \"Shouxian wuzi wan\" 守仙五子丸 (Five-herbs Immortality-safeguarding Pills) is to take 5 ounces each of Indian gooseberry, wild raspberry, dodder, five-flavor berry, and broadleaf plantain and pound them into flour. Mix it with boxthorn juice and false daisy juice and dry. Heat almonds and good wine in a silver vessel, and add \"foxglove\", tofu, and \"deer glue\". Combine this with the five herbs, and dry into small pills. The usual dosage is 30 pills a day taken with wine, but one should avoid eating pork, garlic, mustard, and turnips when taking the medicine (Needham and Ho 1970: 335).\n\nDuring the Tang period, Chinese alchemists divided into two schools of thought about elixir poisoning. The first altogether ignored the poison danger and considered the unpleasant symptoms after taking an elixir as signs of its efficacy. The c. 6th century \"Taiqing shibi ji\" 太清石壁記 (Records of the Rock Chamber) described away the side effects and recommended methods of bringing relief. \nAfter taking an elixir, if your face and body itch as though insects were crawling over them, if your hands and feet swell dropsically, if you cannot stand the smell of food and bring it up after you have eaten it, if you feel as though you were going to be sick most of the time, if you experience weakness in the four limbs, if you have to go often to the latrine, or if your head or stomach violently ache—do not be alarmed or disturbed. All these effects are merely proofs that the elixir you are taking is successfully dispelling your latent disorders. (tr. Needham and Lu 1974: 283) \nMany of these symptoms are characteristic of metallic poisoning: formication, edema, and weakness of the extremities, later leading to infected boils and ulcers, nausea, vomiting, gastric and abdominal pain, diarrhea, and headaches (Needham and Lu 1974: 283). For relieving the side-effects when the elixir takes effect, the \"Taiqing shibi ji\" recommends that one should take hot and cold baths, and drink a mixture of scallion, soy sauce, and wine. If that does not bring relief, then one should combine and boil a hornets' nest, spurge, Solomon's seal, and ephedra into a medicine and take one dose (Needham and Ho 1970: 331).\n\nThe second school of alchemists, admitted that some metal and mineral elixir constituents were poisonous and tried either to neutralize them or to replace them with less dangerous herbal substances (Needham et al. 1976: 182). For instance, the 8th-century \"Zhang zhenren jinshi lingsha lun\" 張真人金石靈沙論 (The Adept Zhang's Discourse on Metals, Minerals, and Cinnabar) emphasized the poisonous nature of gold, silver, lead, mercury, and arsenic, and described witnessing many cases of premature death brought about by consuming cinnabar. Zhang believed however that the poisons could be rendered harmless by properly choosing and combining adjuvant and complimentary ingredients; for example gold should always be used together with mercury, while silver can only be used when combined with gold, copper carbonate, and realgar for the preparation of the \"jindan\" Golden Elixir (tr. Needham and Ho 1970: 331). Many Tang alchemical writers returned to the fashion of using obscure synonyms for ingredients, perhaps because of the alarming number of elixir poisonings, and the desire to dissuade amateur alchemists from experimenting on themselves (Needham et al. 1976: 138). By the end of the Yuan dynasty (1271–1368), the more cautious alchemists had generally changed the elixirs ingredients from minerals and metals to plants and animals (Ho and Lisowski 1997: 39).\n\nThe late Tang or early Song \"Huangdi jiuding shendan jingjue\" 黄帝九鼎神丹經訣 (Explanation of the Yellow Emperor's Manual of the Nine-Vessel Magical Elixir) says, \"The ancient masters (lit. sages) all attained longevity and preserved their lives (lit. bones) by consuming elixirs. But later disciples (lit. scholars) have suffered loss of life and decay of their bones as the result of taking them.\" The treatise explains the secret ancient methods for rendering elixir ingredients harmless by treating them with wine made from \"chastetree\" leaves and roots, or with saltpeter and vinegar. Another method of supposedly removing the poison from mercury was to put it in three-year-old wine, add sal ammoniac and boil it for 100 days (Needham and Ho 1970: 332–3).\n\nTwo rulers died from elixir poisoning during the Five Dynasties period (907–979) of political turmoil after the overthrow of the Tang dynasty. Zhu Wen or Emperor Taizu (r. 907–912), the founder of the Later Liang dynasty, became seriously incapacitated as a result of elixir poisoning, and fell victim to an assassination plot. Li Bian or Emperor Liezu (r. 937–943), the founder of the Southern Tang kingdom, took immortality elixirs that made him irritable and deathly ill (Needham et al. 1976: 180).\n\nThe Daoist adept Chen Tuan (d. 989) advised two emperors that they should not worry about elixirs but direct their minds to improving the state administration, Chai Rong or Emperor Shizong of Later Zhou in 956, and then Emperor Taizu of Song in 976 (Needham et al. 1976: 194).\n\nAfter its heyday in the Tang dynasty Daoist alchemy continued to flourish during the Song dynasty (960–1279) period. However, since six Tang emperors and many court officials died from elixir poisoning, Song alchemists exercised more caution, not only in the composition of the elixirs themselves, but also in attempts to find pharmaceutical methods of counteracting the toxic effects. The number of ingredients used in elixir formulas was reduced and there was a tendency to return to the ancient and difficult terminology of the \"Cantongqi\", perhaps to conceal the processes from rash and ignorant operators. Psycho-physiological \"neidan\" alchemy became steadily more popular than laboratory \"waidan\" alchemy (Needham et al. 1976: 208).\n\nDuring the Song dynasty, the practice of consuming metallic elixirs was not confined to the imperial court and expanded to anyone wealthy enough to pay. The author and official Ye Mengde (1077–1148) described how two of his friends had died from elixirs of immortality in one decade. First, Lin Yanzhen, who boasted about his health and muscular strength, took an elixir for three years, \"Whereupon ulcers developed in his chest, first near the hairs as large as rice-grains, then after a couple of days his neck swelled up so that chin and chest seemed continuous.\" Lin died after ten months of suffering, and his doctors discovered cinnabar powder had accumulated in his pus and blood. Second, whenever Xie Renbo \"heard of anyone who had some cinnabar subdued by fire he went after it, caring nothing about the distance, and his only fear was that he would not have enough.\" He also developed ulcers on the chest. Although his friends noticed changes in his appearance and behavior, Xie did not recognize that he had been poisoned, \"till suddenly it came upon him like a storm of wind and rain, and he died in a single night.\" (tr. Needham and Ho 1970: 320)\n\nThe scientist and statesman Shen Kuo's 1088 \"Dream Pool Essays\" suggested that mercury compounds might be medicinally valuable and needed further study—foreshadowing the use of metallic compounds in modern medicine, such as mercury in salvarsan for syphilis or antimony for visceral leishmaniasis. Shen says his cousin once transformed cinnabar into an elixir, but one of his students mistakenly ate a leftover piece, became delirious, and died the next day.\nNow cinnabar is an extremely good drug and can be taken even by a newborn baby, but once it has been changed by heat it can kill an (adult) person. If we consider the change and transformation of opposites into one another, since (cinnabar) can be changed into a deadly poison why should it not also be changed into something of extreme benefit? Since it can change into something which kills, there is good reason to believe that it may have the pattern-principle [\"li\"] of saving life; it is simply that we have not yet found out the art (of doing this). Thus we cannot deny the possibility of the existence of methods for transforming people into feathered immortals, but we have to be very careful about what we do. (tr. Needham and Ho 1970: 327). \n\nSu Shi (1037–1101), the Song dynasty scholar and pharmacologist, was familiar with the life-prolonging claims of alchemists, but wrote in a letter that, \"I have recently received some cinnabar (elixir) which shows a most remarkable colour, but I cannot summon up enough courage to try it.\" (tr. Needham and Ho 1970: 320).\n\nThe forensic medical expert Song Ci was familiar with the effects of metal poisoning, and his c. 1235 \"Collected Cases of Injustice Rectified\" handbook for coroners gives a test for mercury poisoning: plunge a piece of gold into the intestine or tissues and see if a superficial amalgam forms. He also describes the colic, cramps, and discharge of blood from arsenic poisoning, and gives several antidotes including emetics.\n\nMing dynasty (1368–1644) authorities strongly disapproved of immortality elixirs, but the Jiajing Emperor (r. 1521–1567) supposedly died from consuming them. The emperor was interested in the art of immortality and put great confidence in Daoist physicians, magicians, and alchemists. One named Wang Jin 王金, who was appointed a Physician-in-Attendance in the Imperial Academy of Medicine, convinced the emperor that eating and drinking from vessels made of alchemical gold and silver would bring about immortality, but it only resulted in his death. Wang fled but was caught and exiled to the frontiers in 1570 (Needham et al. 1976: 212).\n\nLi Shizhen's classic 1578 \"Compendium of Materia Medica\" discusses the historical tradition of producing gold and cinnabar elixirs, and concludes, \"(the alchemists) will never realise that the human body, which thrives on water and the cereals, is unable to sustain such heavy substances as gold and other minerals within the stomach and intestines for any length of time. How blind it is, in the pursuit of longevity, to lose one's life instead!\" (tr. Needham and Ho 1970: 325–326). In another section, Li criticizes alchemists and pharmacologists for perpetuating the belief in mercury elixirs.\nI am not able to tell the number of people who since the Six Dynasties period (3rd to 6th centuries) so coveted life that they took (mercury), but all that happened was that they impaired their health permanently or lost their lives. I need not bother to mention the alchemists, but I cannot bear to see these false statements made in pharmacopoeias. However, while mercury is not to be taken orally, its use as a medicine must not be ignored. (tr. Needham and Ho 1970: 325–326) \n\nThe Qing dynasty Yongzheng Emperor (r. 1722–1735) was the last Chinese ruler known to die from elixir poisoning. He was a superstitious man, affected by portents and omens, and a firm believer in Daoist longevity techniques. Taking immortality elixirs is thought to have caused his sudden death in 1735 (Zelin 2002: 229).\n\nThe Chinese tradition of using toxic heavy metals in elixirs of immortality has historical parallels in Ayurvedic medicine. Rasa shastra is the practice of adding metals and minerals to herbal medicines, rasayana is an alchemical tradition that used mercury and cinnabar for lengthening lifespan, raseśvara is a tradition that advocated the use of mercury to make the body immortal, and samskara is a process said to detoxify heavy metals and toxic herbs.\n\nThe historians of Chinese science Joseph Needham and Ho Peng-Yoke wrote a seminal article about poisonous alchemical elixirs (1959, 1970). Based upon early Chinese descriptions of elixir poisoning, they decisively demonstrated a close correspondence with the known medical symptoms of mercury poisoning, lead poisoning, and arsenic poisoning. Compare the historical descriptions of Jin Emperor Ai (d. 365) who \"no longer knew what was going on around him\" and Tang Emperor Wuzong (d. 846) who was \"very irritable, losing all normal self-control in joy or anger ... he could not speak for ten days at a time\" with the distinctive psychological effects of mercury poisoning: progressing from \"abnormal irritability to idiotic, melancholic, or manic conditions\" (1970: 327). Needham and his collaborators further discussed elixir poisoning in the \"Science and Civilisation in China\" series, particularly Needham and Lu Gwei-djen (1974), and Needham, Ho, and Lu (1976).\n\nAlthough Chinese elixir poisoning may lead some to dismiss Chinese alchemy as another example of human follies in history, Ho Peng-Yoke and F. Peter Lisowski note its positive aspect upon Chinese medicine. The caution given to elixir poisoning later led Chinese alchemy to \"shade imperceptibly\" into iatrochemistry, the preparation of medicine by chemical methods, \"in other words chemotherapy\" (1997: 39).\n\nA recent study found that Chinese emperors lived comparatively short lives, with a mean age at death of emperors at 41.3, which was significantly lower than that of Buddhist monks at 66.9 and traditional Chinese doctors at 75.1. Causes of imperial death were natural disease (66.4%), homicide (28.2%), drug toxicity (3.3%), and suicide (2.1%). Homicide resulted in a significantly lower age of death (mean age 31.1) than disease (45.6), suicide (38.8), or drug toxicity (43.1, mentioning Qin Shi Huang taking mercury pills of immortality). Lifestyles seem to have been a determining factor, and 93.2% of the emperors studied were overindulgent in drinking alcohol, sexual activity, or both (Zhao et al. 2006: 1295). The study does not refer to the Chinese belief that the arsenic sulphides realgar and orpiment, frequently used in immortality elixirs, had aphrodisiac properties (Needham and Lu 1974: 285).\n\nA significant question remains unanswered. If the insidious dangers of alchemical elixir poisoning were common knowledge, why did people continue to consume them for centuries? Joseph Needham and his collaborators suggested three hypothetical explanations, and Michel Strickmann proposed another.\n\nNeedham and Lu's first explanation is that many alchemical mineral preparations were capable of giving an \"initial exhilaration\" or transient sense of well-being, usually involving weight loss and increased libido. These preliminary tonic effects could have acted as a kind of \"bait\" inveigling an elixir-taker deeper into substance intoxication, even to the point of death (1974: 282). Chinese medical texts recorded that realgar (arsenic disulphide) and orpiment (arsenic trisulphide) were aphrodisiacs and stimulated fertility, while cinnabar and sulphur elixirs increased longevity, averted hunger, and \"lightened the body\" (namely, \"qīngshēn\" 輕身, which is a common description of elixir effects) (1974: 285).\n\nWine, as mentioned above, was both prescribed to be drunk when taking elixir pills and to relieve the unpleasant side-effects of elixir poisoning. Needham and Lu further suggest the possibility that elixir alchemy included hallucinogenic drugs, tentatively identifying the \"busi zhi yao\" 不死之藥 \"drug of deathlessness\" as fly-agaric and \"busi zhi shu\" 不死之樹 \"tree of deathlessness\" as birch (1974: 117). The elixir that Tao Hongjing's disciple Zhou Ziliang took to commit suicide \"probably had hallucinogenic and toxic mushrooms\" (1974: 296). In the present day, realgar wine is traditionally consumed as part of the Dragon Boat Festival.\n\nThe apparent incorruptibility of an elixir-taker's corpse is Needham and Lu's second explanation for the persistent belief in immortality elixirs. They suggest that in some cases a body did not decompose because the deceased had died from mercury or arsenic poisoning, which is forensically known to often preserve a corpse from decay. For a believer in Daoist immortality drugs, even when an elixir-taker had unmistakably died, if the corpse was comparatively undecomposed, that could be interpreted as proof that the adept had become a \"xian\" immortal, as well as evidence for the alchemical elixir's efficacy. (1974: 298).\n\nTerminal incorruptibility was an ancient Chinese belief associated with jade, gold, and cinnabar. The \"Baopuzi\" says, \"When gold and jade are inserted into the nine orifices, corpses do not decay. When salt and brine are absorbed into flesh and marrow, dried meats do not spoil. So when men ingest substances which are able to benefit their bodies and lengthen their days, why should it be strange that (some of these) should confer life perpetual?\" The abolition of decay was believed to demonstrate the power of elixirs, \"the corruptible had put on incorruptibility\" (Needham and Lu 1974: 284). Chinese jade burial suits are a better known example of using a mineral to preserve corpses.\n\nThere is a possibility that Sun Simiao (above) died from taking mercury elixirs (Needham and Ho 1970: 330). According to Sun's hagiography in the 10th-century \"Xuxian zhuan\" 續仙傳 (Further Biographies of the Immortals), after his death in 682 there was no visible sign of putrefaction, \"After more than a month had passed there was no change in his appearance, and when the corpse was raised to be placed in the coffin it was as light as (a bundle of) empty clothes.\" (tr. Needham and Lu 1974:298).\n\nThe incorruptibility stories about elixir users were not all myth, and recent archeological evidence showed that the ancient Chinese knew how \"to achieve an almost perpetual conservation\". The 1972 excavation of a tomb at Mawangdui discovered the extremely well-preserved body of Xin Zhui or Lady Dai, which resembled that of \"a person who had died only a week or two before\" (Needham and Lu 1974: 303–304). A subsequent autopsy on her corpse found \"abnormally high levels\" of mercury and lead in her internal organs (Brown 2002: 213).\n\nNeedham and Lu's third justification for taking poisonous elixirs is a drug-induced \"temporary death\", possibly a trance or coma. In the classic legend (above) about Wei Boyang drinking an elixir of immortality, he appears to die, subsequently revives, and takes more elixir to achieve immortality.\n\nThe \"Baopuzi\" describes a Five Mineral-based multicolored Ninefold Radiance Elixir that can bring a corpse back to life: \"If you wish to raise a body that has not been dead for fully three days, bathe the corpse with a solution of one spatula of the blue elixir, open its mouth, and insert another spatula full; it will revive immediately.\" (tr. Ware 1966:82).\n\nA Tang Daoist text prescribes taking an elixir in doses half the size of a millet grain, but adds, \"If one is sincerely determined, and dares to take a whole spatula-full all at once, one will temporarily die [\"zànsǐ\" 暫死] for half a day or so, and then be restored to life like someone waking from sleep. This however is perilous in the extreme.\" (tr. Needham and Lu 1974: 295).\n\nMichel Strickmann, a scholar of Daoist and Buddhist studies, analyzed the well-documented Shangqing School's alchemy in the Maoshan revelations and in the life of Tao Hongjing, and concluded that scholars need to reexamine the Western stereotype of \"accidental elixir poisoning\" that supposedly applied to \"misguided alchemists and their unwitting imperial patrons\". Since Six Dynasties and Tang period Daoist literature thoroughly, \"even rapturously\", described the deadly toxic qualities of many elixirs, and Strickmann proposed that some of the recorded alchemical deaths were intentional ritual suicide (1979: 191). Two reviewers disagreed about Strickmann's conclusions. The first questions why he defends the logic of alchemical suicide rather than simply accepting the idea of accidental elixir poisoning, and says Tao Hongjing never experimented with alchemy seriously enough to achieve suicide himself—but fails to mention Strickmann's prime example: Tao's disciple Zhou Ziliang whom Shangqing deities reportedly instructed to prepare a poisonous elixir and commit suicide in order to achieve immortality (Chen 1981: 547). The second describes Strickmann's chapter as \"one of the most thorough and useful\" in the volume, and says he proves that it is \"almost ludicrous to assume that a Taoist (commoner or emperor) could have died from \"accidental\" elixir poisoning\" (Cass 1982: 92–93).\n\n\n"}

{"id": "16300571", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16300571", "title": "Computational creativity", "text": "Computational creativity\n\nComputational creativity (also known as artificial creativity, mechanical creativity, creative computing or creative computation) is a multidisciplinary endeavour that is located at the intersection of the fields of artificial intelligence, cognitive psychology, philosophy, and the arts.\n\nThe goal of computational creativity is to model, simulate or replicate creativity using a computer, to achieve one of several ends:\n\n\nThe field of computational creativity concerns itself with theoretical and practical issues in the study of creativity. Theoretical work on the nature and proper definition of creativity is performed in parallel with practical work on the implementation of systems that exhibit creativity, with one strand of work informing the other.\n\nAs measured by the amount of activity in the field (e.g., publications, conferences and workshops), computational creativity is a growing area of research. But the field is still hampered by a number of fundamental problems. Creativity is very difficult, perhaps even impossible, to define in objective terms. Is it a state of mind, a talent or ability, or a process? Creativity takes many forms in human activity, some \"eminent\" (sometimes referred to as \"Creativity\" with a capital C) and some \"mundane\".\n\nThese are problems that complicate the study of creativity in general, but certain problems attach themselves specifically to \"computational\" creativity:\n\n\nIndeed, not all computer theorists would agree with the premise that computers can only do what they are programmed to do—a key point in favor of computational creativity.\n\nBecause no single perspective or definition seems to offer a complete picture of creativity, the AI researchers Newell, Shaw and Simon developed the combination of novelty and usefulness into the cornerstone of a multi-pronged view of creativity, one that uses the following four criteria to categorize a given answer or solution as creative:\n\n\nWhereas the above reflects a \"top-down\" approach to computational creativity, an alternative thread has developed among \"bottom-up\" computational psychologists involved in artificial neural network research. During the late 1980s and early 1990s, for example, such generative neural systems were driven by genetic algorithms. Experiments involving recurrent nets were successful in hybridizing simple musical melodies and predicting listener expectations.\n\nConcurrent with such research, a number of computational psychologists took the perspective, popularized by Stephen Wolfram, that system behaviors perceived as complex, including the mind's creative output, could arise from what would be considered simple algorithms. As neuro-philosophical thinking matured, it also became evident that language actually presented an obstacle to producing a scientific model of cognition, creative or not, since it carried with it so many unscientific aggrandizements that were more uplifting than accurate. Thus questions naturally arose as to how \"rich,\" \"complex,\" and \"wonderful\" creative cognition actually was.\n\nBefore 1989, artificial neural networks have been used to model certain aspects of creativity. Peter Todd (1989) first trained a neural network to reproduce musical melodies from a training set of musical pieces. Then he used a change algorithm to modify the network's input parameters. The network was able to randomly generate new music in a highly uncontrolled manner. In 1992, Todd\nextended this work, using the so-called distal teacher approach that had been developed by\nPaul Munro, Paul Werbos, D. Nguyen and Bernard Widrow, Michael I. Jordan and David Rumelhart. In the new approach there are two neural networks, one of which is supplying training patterns to another. \nIn later efforts by Todd, a composer would select a set of melodies that define the melody space, position them on a 2-d plane with a mouse-based graphic interface, and train a connectionist network to produce those melodies, and listen to the new \"interpolated\" melodies that the network generates corresponding to intermediate points in the 2-d plane.\n\nMore recently a neurodynamical model of semantic networks has been developed to study how the connectivity structure of these networks relates to the richness of the semantic constructs, or ideas, they can generate. It was demonstrated that semantic neural networks that have richer semantic dynamics than those with other connectivity structures may provide insight into the important issue of how the physical structure of the brain determines one of the most profound features of the human mind – its capacity for creative thought.\n\nSome high-level and philosophical themes recur throughout the field of computational creativity.\n\nMargaret Boden refers to creativity that is novel \"merely to the agent that produces it\" as \"P-creativity\" (or \"psychological creativity\"), and refers to creativity that is recognized as novel \"by society at large\" as \"H-creativity\" (or \"historical creativity\"). Stephen Thaler has suggested a new category he calls \"V-\" or \"Visceral creativity\" wherein significance is invented to raw sensory inputs to a Creativity Machine architecture, with the \"gateway\" nets perturbed to produce alternative interpretations, and downstream nets shifting such interpretations to fit the overarching context. An important variety of such V-creativity is consciousness itself, wherein meaning is reflexively invented to activation turnover within the brain.\n\nBoden also distinguishes between the creativity that arises from an exploration within an established conceptual space, and the creativity that arises from a deliberate transformation or transcendence of this space. She labels the former as \"exploratory creativity\" and the latter as \"transformational creativity\", seeing the latter as a form of creativity far more radical, challenging, and rarer than the former. Following the criteria from Newell and Simon elaborated above, we can see that both forms of creativity should produce results that are appreciably novel and useful (criterion 1), but exploratory creativity is more likely to arise from a thorough and persistent search of a well-understood space (criterion 3) -- while transformational creativity should involve the rejection of some of the constraints that define this space (criterion 2) or some of the assumptions that define the problem itself (criterion 4). Boden's insights have guided work in computational creativity at a very general level, providing more an inspirational touchstone for development work than a technical framework of algorithmic substance. However, Boden's insights are more recently also the subject of formalization, most notably in the work by Geraint Wiggins.\n\nThe criterion that creative products should be novel and useful means that creative computational systems are typically structured into two phases, generation and evaluation. In the first phase, novel (to the system itself, thus P-Creative) constructs are generated; unoriginal constructs that are already known to the system are filtered at this stage. This body of potentially creative constructs are then evaluated, to determine which are meaningful and useful and which are not. This two-phase structure conforms to the Geneplore model of Finke, Ward and Smith, which is a psychological model of creative generation based on empirical observation of human creativity.\n\nA great deal, perhaps all, of human creativity can be understood as a novel combination of pre-existing ideas or objects . Common strategies for combinatorial creativity include:\nThe combinatorial perspective allows us to model creativity as a search process through the space of possible combinations. The combinations can arise from composition or concatenation of different representations, or through a rule-based or stochastic transformation of initial and intermediate representations. Genetic algorithms and neural networks can be used to generate blended or crossover representations that capture a combination of different inputs.\n\nMark Turner and Gilles Fauconnier propose a model called Conceptual Integration Networks that elaborates upon Arthur Koestler's ideas about creativity as well as more recent work by Lakoff and Johnson, by synthesizing ideas from Cognitive Linguistic research into mental spaces and conceptual metaphors. Their basic model defines an integration network as four connected spaces:\n\n\nFauconnier and Turner describe a collection of optimality principles that are claimed to guide the construction of a well-formed integration network. In essence, they see blending as a compression mechanism in which two or more input structures are compressed into a single blend structure. This compression operates on the level of conceptual relations. For example, a series of similarity relations between the input spaces can be compressed into a single identity relationship in the blend.\n\nSome computational success has been achieved with the blending model by extending pre-existing computational models of analogical mapping that are compatible by virtue of their emphasis on connected semantic structures. More recently, Francisco Câmara Pereira presented an implementation of blending theory that employs ideas both from GOFAI and genetic algorithms to realize some aspects of blending theory in a practical form; his example domains range from the linguistic to the visual, and the latter most notably includes the creation of mythical monsters by combining 3-D graphical models.\n\nLanguage provides continuous opportunity for creativity, evident in the generation of novel sentences, phrasings, puns, neologisms, rhymes, allusions, sarcasm, irony, similes, metaphors, analogies, witticisms, and jokes. Native speakers of morphologically rich languages frequently create new word-forms that are easily understood, although they will never find their way to the dictionary. The area of natural language generation has been well studied, but these creative aspects of everyday language have yet to be incorporated with any robustness or scale.\n\nSubstantial work has been conducted in this area of linguistic creation since the 1970s, with the development of James Meehan's TALE-SPIN\n\nThe company Narrative Science makes computer generated news and reports commercially available, including summarizing team sporting events based on statistical data from the game. It also creates financial reports and real estate analyses.\n\nExample of a metaphor: \"She was an ape.\"\n\nExample of a simile: \"Felt like a tiger-fur blanket.\"\nThe computational study of these phenomena has mainly focused on interpretation as a knowledge-based process. Computationalists such as Yorick Wilks, James Martin, Dan Fass, John Barnden, and Mark Lee have developed knowledge-based approaches to the processing of metaphors, either at a linguistic level or a logical level. Tony Veale and Yanfen Hao have developed a system, called Sardonicus, that acquires a comprehensive database of explicit similes from the web; these similes are then tagged as bona-fide (e.g., \"as hard as steel\") or ironic (e.g., \"as hairy as a bowling ball\", \"as pleasant as a root canal\"); similes of either type can be retrieved on demand for any given adjective. They use these similes as the basis of an on-line metaphor generation system called Aristotle that can suggest lexical metaphors for a given descriptive goal (e.g., to describe a supermodel as skinny, the source terms \"pencil\", \"whip\", \"whippet\", \"rope\", \"stick-insect\" and \"snake\" are suggested).\n\nThe process of analogical reasoning has been studied from both a mapping and a retrieval perspective, the latter being key to the generation of novel analogies. The dominant school of research, as advanced by Dedre Gentner, views analogy as a structure-preserving process; this view has been implemented in the structure mapping engine or SME, the MAC/FAC retrieval engine (Many Are Called, Few Are Chosen), ACME (Analogical Constraint Mapping Engine) and ARCS (Analogical Retrieval Constraint System). Other mapping-based approaches include Sapper, which situates the mapping process in a semantic-network model of memory. Analogy is a very active sub-area of creative computation and creative cognition; active figures in this sub-area include Douglas Hofstadter, Paul Thagard, and Keith Holyoak. Also worthy of note here is Peter Turney and Michael Littman's machine learning approach to the solving of SAT-style analogy problems; their approach achieves a score that compares well with average scores achieved by humans on these tests.\n\nHumour is an especially knowledge-hungry process, and the most successful joke-generation systems to date have focussed on pun-generation, as exemplified by the work of Kim Binsted and Graeme Ritchie. This work includes the JAPE system, which can generate a wide range of puns that are consistently evaluated as novel and humorous by young children. An improved version of JAPE has been developed in the guise of the STANDUP system, which has been experimentally deployed as a means of enhancing linguistic interaction with children with communication disabilities. Some limited progress has been made in generating humour that involves other aspects of natural language, such as the deliberate misunderstanding of pronominal reference (in the work of Hans Wim Tinholt and Anton Nijholt), as well as in the generation of humorous acronyms in the HAHAcronym system of Oliviero Stock and Carlo Strapparava.\n\nThe blending of multiple word forms is a dominant force for new word creation in language; these new words are commonly called \"blends\" or \"portmanteau words\" (after Lewis Carroll). Tony Veale has developed a system called ZeitGeist that harvests neological headwords from Wikipedia and interprets them relative to their local context in Wikipedia and relative to specific word senses in WordNet. ZeitGeist has been extended to generate neologisms of its own; the approach combines elements from an inventory of word parts that are harvested from WordNet, and simultaneously determines likely glosses for these new words (e.g., \"food traveller\" for \"gastronaut\" and \"time traveller\" for \"chrononaut\"). It then uses Web search to determine which glosses are meaningful and which neologisms have not been used before; this search identifies the subset of generated words that are both novel (\"H-creative\") and useful. Neurolinguistic inspirations have been used to analyze the process of novel word creation in the brain, understand neurocognitive processes responsible for intuition, insight, imagination and creativity and to create a server that invents novel names for products, based on their description. Further, the system Nehovah blends two source words into a neologism that blends the meanings of the two source words. Nehovah searches WordNet for synonyms and TheTopTens.com for pop culture hyponyms. The synonyms and hyponyms are blended together to create a set of candidate neologisms. The neologisms are then scored based on their word structure, how unique the word is, how apparent the concepts are conveyed, and if the neologism has a pop culture reference. Nehovah loosely follows conceptual blending.\n\nLike jokes, poems involve a complex interaction of different constraints, and no general-purpose poem generator adequately combines the meaning, phrasing, structure and rhyme aspects of poetry. Nonetheless, Pablo Gervás has developed a noteworthy system called ASPERA that employs a case-based reasoning (CBR) approach to generating poetic formulations of a given input text via a composition of poetic fragments that are retrieved from a case-base of existing poems. Each poem fragment in the ASPERA case-base is annotated with a prose string that expresses the meaning of the fragment, and this prose string is used as the retrieval key for each fragment. Metrical rules are then used to combine these fragments into a well-formed poetic structure. Racter is an example of such a software project.\n\nComputational creativity in the music domain has focused both on the generation of musical scores for use by human musicians, and on the generation of music for performance by computers. The domain of generation has included classical music (with software that generates music in the style of Mozart and Bach) and jazz. Most notably, David Cope has written a software system called \"Experiments in Musical Intelligence\" (or \"EMI\") that is capable of analyzing and generalizing from existing music by a human composer to generate novel musical compositions in the same style. EMI's output is convincing enough to persuade human listeners that its music is human-generated to a high level of competence.\n\nIn the field of contemporary classical music, Iamus is the first computer that composes from scratch, and produces final scores that professional interpreters can play. The London Symphony Orchestra played a piece for full orchestra, included in Iamus' debut CD, which \"New Scientist\" described as \"The first major work composed by a computer and performed by a full orchestra\". Melomics, the technology behind Iamus, is able to generate pieces in different styles of music with a similar level of quality.\n\nCreativity research in jazz has focused on the process of improvisation and the cognitive demands that this places on a musical agent: reasoning about time, remembering and conceptualizing what has already been played, and planning ahead for what might be played next. The robot Shimon, developed by Gil Weinberg of Georgia Tech, has demonstrated jazz improvisation. Virtual improvisation software based on machine learning models of musical style include OMax, SoMax and PyOracle, are used to create improvisations in real-time by re-injecting variable length sequences learned on the fly from live performer.\n\nIn 1994, a Creativity Machine architecture (see above) was able to generate 11,000 musical hooks by training a synaptically perturbed neural net on 100 melodies that had appeared on the top ten list over the last 30 years. In 1996, a self-bootstrapping Creativity Machine observed audience facial expressions through an advanced machine vision system and perfected its musical talents to generate an album entitled \"Song of the Neurons\"\n\nIn the field of musical composition, the patented works by René-Louis Baron allowed to make a robot that can create and play a multitude of orchestrated melodies so-called \"coherent\" in any musical style. All outdoor physical parameter associated with one or more specific musical parameters, can influence and develop each of these songs (in real time while listening to the song). The patented invention \"Medal-Composer\" raises problems of copyright.\n\nComputational creativity in the generation of visual art has had some notable successes in the creation of both abstract art and representational art. The most famous program in this domain is Harold Cohen's AARON, which has been continuously developed and augmented since 1973. Though formulaic, Aaron exhibits a range of outputs, generating black-and-white drawings or colour paintings that incorporate human figures (such as dancers), potted plants, rocks, and other elements of background imagery. These images are of a sufficiently high quality to be displayed in reputable galleries.\n\nOther software artists of note include the NEvAr system (for \"Neuro-Evolutionary Art\") of Penousal Machado. NEvAr uses a genetic algorithm to derive a mathematical function that is then used to generate a coloured three-dimensional surface. A human user is allowed to select the best pictures after each phase of the genetic algorithm, and these preferences are used to guide successive phases, thereby pushing NEvAr's search into pockets of the search space that are considered most appealing to the user.\n\nThe Painting Fool, developed by Simon Colton originated as a system for overpainting digital images of a given scene in a choice of different painting styles, colour palettes and brush types. Given its dependence on an input source image to work with, the earliest iterations of the Painting Fool raised questions about the extent of, or lack of, creativity in a computational art system. Nonetheless, in more recent work, The Painting Fool has been extended to create novel images, much as AARON does, from its own limited imagination. Images in this vein include cityscapes and forests, which are generated by a process of constraint satisfaction from some basic scenarios provided by the user (e.g., these scenarios allow the system to infer that objects closer to the viewing plane should be larger and more color-saturated, while those further away should be less saturated and appear smaller). Artistically, the images now created by the Painting Fool appear on a par with those created by Aaron, though the extensible mechanisms employed by the former (constraint satisfaction, etc.) may well allow it to develop into a more elaborate and sophisticated painter.\n\nThe artist Krasimira Dimtchevska and the software developer Svillen Ranev have created a computational system combining a rule-based generator of English sentences and a visual composition builder that converts sentences generated by the system into abstract art. The software generates automatically indefinite number of different images using different color, shape and size palettes. The software also allows the user to select the subject of the generated sentences or/and the one or more of the palettes used by the visual composition builder.\n\nAn emerging area of computational creativity is that of video games. ANGELINA is a system for creatively developing video games in Java by Michael Cook. One important aspect is Mechanic Miner, a system which can generate short segments of code which act as simple game mechanics. ANGELINA can evaluate these mechanics for usefulness by playing simple unsolvable game levels and testing to see if the new mechanic makes the level solvable. Sometimes Mechanic Miner discovers bugs in the code and exploits these to make new mechanics for the player to solve problems with.\n\nIn July 2015 Google released \"DeepDream\" – an open source computer vision program, created to detect faces and other patterns in images with the aim of automatically classifying images, which uses a convolutional neural network to find and enhance patterns in images via algorithmic pareidolia, thus creating a dreamlike psychedelic appearance in the deliberately over-processed images.\n\nIn August 2015 researchers from Tübingen, Germany created a convolutional neural network that uses neural representations to separate and recombine content and style of arbitrary images which is able to turn images into stylistic imitations of works of art by artists such as a Picasso or Van Gogh in about an hour. Their algorithm is put into use in the website DeepArt that allows users to create unique artistic images by their algorithm.\n\nIn early 2016, a global team of researchers explained how a new computational creativity approach known as the Digital Synaptic Neural Substrate (DSNS) could be used to generate original chess puzzles that were not derived from endgame databases. The DSNS is able to combine features of different objects (e.g. chess problems, paintings, music) using stochastic methods in order to derive new feature specifications which can be used to generate objects in any of the original domains. The generated chess puzzles have also been featured on YouTube.\n\nCreativity is also useful in allowing for unusual solutions in problem solving. In psychology and cognitive science, this research area is called creative problem solving. The Explicit-Implicit Interaction (EII) theory of creativity has recently been implemented using a CLARION-based computational model that allows for the simulation of incubation and insight in problem solving. The emphasis of this computational creativity project is not on performance per se (as in artificial intelligence projects) but rather on the explanation of the psychological processes leading to human creativity and the reproduction of data collected in psychology experiments. So far, this project has been successful in providing an explanation for incubation effects in simple memory experiments, insight in problem solving, and reproducing the overshadowing effect in problem solving.\n\nSome researchers feel that creativity is a complex phenomenon whose study is further complicated by the plasticity of the language we use to describe it. We can describe not just the agent of creativity as \"creative\" but also the product and the method. Consequently, it could be claimed that it is unrealistic to speak of a \"general theory of creativity\". Nonetheless, some generative principles are more general than others, leading some advocates to claim that certain computational approaches are \"general theories\". Stephen Thaler, for instance, proposes that certain modalities of neural networks are generative enough, and general enough, to manifest a high degree of creative capabilities. Likewise, the Formal Theory of Creativity is based on a simple computational principle published by Jürgen Schmidhuber in 1991. The theory postulates that creativity and curiosity and selective attention in general are by-products of a simple algorithmic principle for measuring and optimizing learning progress.\n\nTraditional computers, as mainly used in the computational creativity application, do not support creativity, as they fundamentally transform a set of discrete, limited domain of input parameters into a set of discrete, limited domain of output parameters using a limited set of computational functions . As such, a computer cannot be creative, as everything in the output must have been already present in the input data or the algorithms . For some related discussions and references to related work are captured in some recent work on philosophical foundations of simulation.\n\nMathematically, the same set of arguments against creativity has been made by Chaitin. Similar observations come from a Model Theory perspective. All this criticism emphasizes that computational creativity is useful and may look like creativity, but it is not real creativity, as nothing new is created, just transformed in well defined algorithms.\n\nThe International Conference on Computational Creativity (ICCC) occurs annually, organized by The Association for Computational Creativity. Events in the series include:\n\nPreviously, the community of computational creativity has held a dedicated workshop, the International Joint Workshop on Computational Creativity, every year since 1999. Previous events in this series include:\n\n\nThe 1st Conference on Computer Simulation of Musical Creativity will be held\n\nDesign Computing and Cognition is one conference that addresses computational creativity. The ACM Creativity and Cognition conference is another forum for issues related to computational creativity. Journées d'Informatique Musicale 2016 keynote by Shlomo Dubnov was on Information Theoretic Creativity.\n\nA number of recent books provide either a good introduction or a good overview of the field of Computational Creativity. These include:\n\n\nIn addition to the proceedings of conferences and workshops, the computational creativity community has thus far produced these special journal issues dedicated to the topic:\n\n\nIn addition to these, a new journal has started which focuses on computational creativity within the field of music.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "9015", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9015", "title": "DNA replication", "text": "DNA replication\n\nIn molecular biology, DNA replication is the biological process of producing two identical replicas of DNA from one original DNA molecule. This process occurs in all living organisms and is the basis for biological inheritance. The cell possesses the distinctive property of division, which makes replication of DNA essential.\n\nDNA is made up of a double helix of two complementary strands. During replication, these strands are separated. Each strand of the original DNA molecule then serves as a template for the production of its counterpart, a process referred to as semiconservative replication. As a result of semi-conservative replication, the new helix will be composed of an original DNA strand as well as a newly synthesized strand. Cellular proofreading and error-checking mechanisms ensure near perfect fidelity for DNA replication.\n\nIn a cell, DNA replication begins at specific locations, or origins of replication, in the genome. Unwinding of DNA at the origin and synthesis of new strands, accommodated by an enzyme known as helicase, results in replication forks growing bi-directionally from the origin. A number of proteins are associated with the replication fork to help in the initiation and continuation of DNA synthesis. Most prominently, DNA polymerase synthesizes the new strands by adding nucleotides that complement each (template) strand. DNA replication occurs during the S-stage of interphase.\n\nDNA replication (DNA amplification) can also be performed \"in vitro\" (artificially, outside a cell). DNA polymerases isolated from cells and artificial DNA primers can be used to initiate DNA synthesis at known sequences in a template DNA molecule. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR), ligase chain reaction (LCR), and transcription-mediated amplification (TMA) are examples.\n\nDNA exists as a double-stranded structure, with both strands coiled together to form the characteristic double-helix. Each single strand of DNA is a chain of four types of nucleotides. Nucleotides in DNA contain a deoxyribose sugar, a phosphate, and a nucleobase. The four types of nucleotide correspond to the four nucleobases adenine, cytosine, guanine, and thymine, commonly abbreviated as A, C, G and T. Adenine and guanine are purine bases, while cytosine and thymine are pyrimidines. These nucleotides form phosphodiester bonds, creating the phosphate-deoxyribose backbone of the DNA double helix with the nucleobases pointing inward (i.e., toward the opposing strand). Nucleobases are matched between strands through hydrogen bonds to form base pairs. Adenine pairs with thymine (two hydrogen bonds), and guanine pairs with cytosine (three hydrogen bonds).\n\nDNA strands have a directionality, and the different ends of a single strand are called the \"3' (three-prime) end\" and the \"5' (five-prime) end\". By convention, if the base sequence of a single strand of DNA is given, the left end of the sequence is the 5' end, while the right end of the sequence is the 3' end. The strands of the double helix are anti-parallel with one being 5' to 3', and the opposite strand 3' to 5'. These terms refer to the carbon atom in deoxyribose to which the next phosphate in the chain attaches. Directionality has consequences in DNA synthesis, because DNA polymerase can synthesize DNA in only one direction by adding nucleotides to the 3' end of a DNA strand.\n\nThe pairing of complementary bases in DNA (through hydrogen bonding) means that the information contained within each strand is useless. phosphoodiester (intra-strand) bonds are stronger than hydrogen (inter-strand) bonds. This allows the strands to be separated from one another. The nucleotides on a single strand can therefore be used to reconstruct nucleotides on a newly synthesized partner strand.\n\nDNA polymerases are a family of enzymes that carry out all forms of DNA replication. DNA polymerases in general cannot initiate synthesis of new strands, but can only extend an existing DNA or RNA strand paired with a template strand. To begin synthesis, a short fragment of RNA, called a primer, must be created and paired with the template DNA strand.\n\nDNA polymerase adds a new strand of DNA by extending the 3' end of an existing nucleotide chain, adding new nucleotides matched to the template strand one at a time via the creation of phosphodiester bonds. The energy for this process of DNA polymerization comes from hydrolysis of the high-energy phosphate (phosphoanhydride) bonds between the three phosphates attached to each unincorporated base. Free bases with their attached phosphate groups are called nucleotides; in particular, bases with three attached phosphate groups are called nucleoside triphosphates. When a nucleotide is being added to a growing DNA strand, the formation of a phosphodiester bond between the proximal phosphate of the nucleotide to the growing chain is accompanied by hydrolysis of a high-energy phosphate bond with release of the two distal phosphates as a pyrophosphate. Enzymatic hydrolysis of the resulting pyrophosphate into inorganic phosphate consumes a second high-energy phosphate bond and renders the reaction effectively irreversible.\n\nIn general, DNA polymerases are highly accurate, with an intrinsic error rate of less than one mistake for every 10 nucleotides added. In addition, some DNA polymerases also have proofreading ability; they can remove nucleotides from the end of a growing strand in order to correct mismatched bases. Finally, post-replication mismatch repair mechanisms monitor the DNA for errors, being capable of distinguishing mismatches in the newly synthesized DNA strand from the original strand sequence. Together, these three discrimination steps enable replication fidelity of less than one mistake for every 10 nucleotides added.\n\nThe rate of DNA replication in a living cell was first measured as the rate of phage T4 DNA elongation in phage-infected \"E. coli\". During the period of exponential DNA increase at 37 °C, the rate was 749 nucleotides per second. The mutation rate per base pair per replication during phage T4 DNA synthesis is 1.7 per 10.\n\nDNA replication, like all biological polymerization processes, proceeds in three enzymatically catalyzed and coordinated steps: initiation, elongation and termination.\n\nFor a cell to divide, it must first replicate its DNA. This process is initiated at particular points in the DNA, known as \"origins\", which are targeted by initiator proteins. In \"E. coli\" this protein is DnaA; in yeast, this is the origin recognition complex. Sequences used by initiator proteins tend to be \"AT-rich\" (rich in adenine and thymine bases), because A-T base pairs have two hydrogen bonds (rather than the three formed in a C-G pair) and thus are easier to strand-separate. Once the origin has been located, these initiators recruit other proteins and form the pre-replication complex, which unwinds the double-stranded DNA.\n\nDNA polymerase has 5′–3′ activity.\nAll known DNA replication systems require a free 3' hydroxyl group before synthesis can be initiated (note: the DNA template is read in 3′ to 5′ direction whereas a new strand is synthesized in the 5′ to 3′ direction—this is often confused). Four distinct mechanisms for DNA synthesis are recognized:\n\nThe first is the best known of these mechanisms and is used by the cellular organisms. In this mechanism, once the two strands are separated, primase adds RNA primers to the template strands. The leading strand receives one RNA primer while the lagging strand receives several. The leading strand is continuously extended from the primer by a DNA polymerase with high processivity, while the lagging strand is extended discontinuously from each primer forming Okazaki fragments. RNase removes the primer RNA fragments, and a low processivity DNA polymerase distinct from the replicative polymerase enters to fill the gaps. When this is complete, a single nick on the leading strand and several nicks on the lagging strand can be found. Ligase works to fill these nicks in, thus completing the newly replicated DNA molecule.\n\nThe primase used in this process differs significantly between bacteria and archaea/eukaryotes. Bacteria use a primase belonging to the DnaG protein superfamily which contains a catalytic domain of the TOPRIM fold type. The TOPRIM fold contains an α/β core with four conserved strands in a Rossmann-like topology. This structure is also found in the catalytic domains of topoisomerase Ia, topoisomerase II, the OLD-family nucleases and DNA repair proteins related to the RecR protein.\n\nThe primase used by archaea and eukaryotes, in contrast, contains a highly derived version of the RNA recognition motif (RRM). This primase is structurally similar to many viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerases, reverse transcriptases, cyclic nucleotide generating cyclases and DNA polymerases of the A/B/Y families that are involved in DNA replication and repair. In eukaryotic replication, the primase forms a complex with Pol α.\n\nMultiple DNA polymerases take on different roles in the DNA replication process. In \"E. coli\", DNA Pol III is the polymerase enzyme primarily responsible for DNA replication. It assembles into a replication complex at the replication fork that exhibits extremely high processivity, remaining intact for the entire replication cycle. In contrast, DNA Pol I is the enzyme responsible for replacing RNA primers with DNA. DNA Pol I has a 5′ to 3′ exonuclease activity in addition to its polymerase activity, and uses its exonuclease activity to degrade the RNA primers ahead of it as it extends the DNA strand behind it, in a process called nick translation. Pol I is much less processive than Pol III because its primary function in DNA replication is to create many short DNA regions rather than a few very long regions.\n\nIn eukaryotes, the low-processivity enzyme, Pol α, helps to initiate replication because it forms a complex with primase. In eukaryotes, leading strand synthesis is thought to be conducted by Pol ε; however, this view has recently been challenged, suggesting a role for Pol δ. Primer removal is completed Pol δ while repair of DNA during replication is completed by Pol ε.\n\nAs DNA synthesis continues, the original DNA strands continue to unwind on each side of the bubble, forming a replication fork with two prongs. In bacteria, which have a single origin of replication on their circular chromosome, this process creates a \"theta structure\" (resembling the Greek letter theta: θ). In contrast, eukaryotes have longer linear chromosomes and initiate replication at multiple origins within these.\n\nThe replication fork is a structure that forms within the nucleus during DNA replication. It is created by helicases, which break the hydrogen bonds holding the two DNA strands together. The resulting structure has two branching \"prongs\", each one made up of a single strand of DNA. These two strands serve as the template for the leading and lagging strands, which will be created as DNA polymerase matches complementary nucleotides to the templates; the templates may be properly referred to as the leading strand template and the lagging strand template.\n\nDNA is always synthesized in the 5' to 3' direction. Since the leading and lagging strand templates are oriented in opposite directions at the replication fork, a major issue is how to achieve synthesis of nascent (new) lagging strand DNA, whose direction of synthesis is opposite to the direction of the growing replication fork.\n\nThe leading strand is the strand of nascent DNA which is being synthesized in the same direction as the growing replication fork. This sort of DNA replication is continuous.\n\nThe lagging strand is the strand of nascent DNA whose direction of synthesis is opposite to the direction of the growing replication fork. Because of its orientation, replication of the lagging strand is more complicated as compared to that of the leading strand. As a consequence, the DNA polymerase on this strand is seen to \"lag behind\" the other strand.\n\nThe lagging strand is synthesized in short, separated segments. On the lagging strand \"template\", a primase \"reads\" the template DNA and initiates synthesis of a short complementary RNA primer. A DNA polymerase extends the primed segments, forming Okazaki fragments. The RNA primers are then removed and replaced with DNA, and the fragments of DNA are joined together by DNA ligase.\n\nAs helicase unwinds DNA at the replication fork, the DNA ahead is forced to rotate. This process results in a build-up of twists in the DNA ahead. This build-up forms a torsional resistance that would eventually halt the progress of the replication fork. Topoisomerases are enzymes that temporarily break the strands of DNA, relieving the tension caused by unwinding the two strands of the DNA helix; topoisomerases (including DNA gyrase) achieve this by adding negative supercoils to the DNA helix.\n\nBare single-stranded DNA tends to fold back on itself forming secondary structures; these structures can interfere with the movement of DNA polymerase. To prevent this, single-strand binding proteins bind to the DNA until a second strand is synthesized, preventing secondary structure formation.\n\nClamp proteins form a sliding clamp around DNA, helping the DNA polymerase maintain contact with its template, thereby assisting with processivity. The inner face of the clamp enables DNA to be threaded through it. Once the polymerase reaches the end of the template or detects double-stranded DNA, the sliding clamp undergoes a conformational change that releases the DNA polymerase. Clamp-loading proteins are used to initially load the clamp, recognizing the junction between template and RNA primers.\n\nAt the replication fork, many replication enzymes assemble on the DNA into a complex molecular machine called the replisome. The following is a list of major DNA replication enzymes that participate in the replisome:\n\nReplication machineries consist of factors involved in DNA replication and appearing on template ssDNAs. Replication machineries include primosotors are replication enzymes; DNA polymerase, DNA helicases, DNA clamps and DNA topoisomerases, and replication proteins; e.g. single-stranded DNA binding proteins (SSB). In the replication machineries these components coordinate. In most of the bacteria, all of the factors involved in DNA replication are located on replication forks and the complexes stay on the forks during DNA replication. These replication machineries are called replisomes or DNA replicase systems. These terms are generic terms for proteins located on replication forks. In eukaryotic and some bacterial cells the replisomes are not formed.\n\nSince replication machineries do not move relatively to template DNAs such as factories, they are called a replication factory. In an alternative figure, DNA factories are similar to projectors and DNAs are like as cinematic films passing constantly into the projectors. In the replication factory model, after both DNA helicases for leading strands and lagging strands are loaded on the template DNAs, the helicases run along the DNAs into each other. The helicases remain associated for the remainder of replication process. Peter Meister et al. observed directly replication sites in budding yeast by monitoring green fluorescent protein(GFP)-tagged DNA polymerases α. They detected DNA replication of pairs of the tagged loci spaced apart symmetrically from a replication origin and found that the distance between the pairs decreased markedly by time. This finding suggests that the mechanism of DNA replication goes with DNA factories. That is, couples of replication factories are loaded on replication origins and the factories associated with each other. Also, template DNAs move into the factories, which bring extrusion of the template ssDNAs and nascent DNAs. Meister’s finding is the first direct evidence of replication factory model. Subsequent research has shown that DNA helicases form dimers in many eukaryotic cells and bacterial replication machineries stay in single intranuclear location during DNA synthesis.\n\nThe replication factories perform disentanglement of sister chromatids. The disentanglement is essential for distributing the chromatids into daughter cells after DNA replication. Because sister chromatids after DNA replication hold each other by Cohesin rings, there is the only chance for the disentanglement in DNA replication. Fixing of replication machineries as replication factories can improve the success rate of DNA replication. If replication forks move freely in chromosomes, catenation of nuclei is aggravated and impedes mitotic segregation.\n\nEukaryotes initiate DNA replication at multiple points in the chromosome, so replication forks meet and terminate at many points in the chromosome. Because eukaryotes have linear chromosomes, DNA replication is unable to reach the very end of the chromosomes. Due to this problem, DNA is lost each replication cycle from the end of the chromosome. Telomeres are regions of repetitive DNA close to the ends and help prevent loss of genes due to this shortening. Shortening of the telomeres is a normal process in somatic cells. This shortens the telomeres of the daughter DNA chromosome. As a result, cells can only divide a certain number of times before the DNA loss prevents further division. (This is known as the Hayflick limit.) Within the germ cell line, which passes DNA to the next generation, telomerase extends the repetitive sequences of the telomere region to prevent degradation. Telomerase can become mistakenly active in somatic cells, sometimes leading to cancer formation. Increased telomerase activity is one of the hallmarks of cancer.\n\nTermination requires that the progress of the DNA replication fork must stop or be blocked. Termination at a specific locus, when it occurs, involves the interaction between two components: (1) a termination site sequence in the DNA, and (2) a protein which binds to this sequence to physically stop DNA replication. In various bacterial species, this is named the DNA replication terminus site-binding protein, or Ter protein.\n\nBecause bacteria have circular chromosomes, termination of replication occurs when the two replication forks meet each other on the opposite end of the parental chromosome. \"E. coli\" regulates this process through the use of termination sequences that, when bound by the Tus protein, enable only one direction of replication fork to pass through. As a result, the replication forks are constrained to always meet within the termination region of the chromosome.\n\nWithin eukaryotes, DNA replication is controlled within the context of the cell cycle. As the cell grows and divides, it progresses through stages in the cell cycle; DNA replication takes place during the S phase (synthesis phase). The progress of the eukaryotic cell through the cycle is controlled by cell cycle checkpoints. Progression through checkpoints is controlled through complex interactions between various proteins, including cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinases. Unlike bacteria, eukaryotic DNA replicates in the confines of the nucleus.\n\nThe G1/S checkpoint (or restriction checkpoint) regulates whether eukaryotic cells enter the process of DNA replication and subsequent division. Cells that do not proceed through this checkpoint remain in the G0 stage and do not replicate their DNA.\n\nReplication of chloroplast and mitochondrial genomes occurs independently of the cell cycle, through the process of D-loop replication.\n\nIn vertebrate cells, replication sites concentrate into positions called replication foci. Replication sites can be detected by immunostaining daughter strands and replication enzymes and monitoring GFP-tagged replication factors. By these methods it is found that replication foci of varying size and positions appear in S phase of cell division and their number per nucleus is far smaller than the number of genomic replication forks.\n\nP. Heun et al.(2001) tracked GFP-tagged replication foci in budding yeast cells and revealed that replication origins move constantly in G1 and S phase and the dynamics decreased significantly in S phase. Traditionally, replication sites were fixed on spatial structure of chromosomes by nuclear matrix or lamins. The Heun’s results denied the traditional concepts, budding yeasts don't have lamins, and support that replication origins self-assemble and form replication foci.\n\nBy firing of replication origins, controlled spatially and temporally, the formation of replication foci is regulated. D. A. Jackson et al.(1998) revealed that neighboring origins fire simultaneously in mammalian cells. Spatial juxtaposition of replication sites brings clustering of replication forks. The clustering do rescue of stalled replication forks and favors normal progress of replication forks. Progress of replication forks is inhibited by many factors; collision with proteins or with complexes binding strongly on DNA, deficiency of dNTPs, nicks on template DNAs and so on. If replication forks stall and the remaining sequences from the stalled forks are not replicated, the daughter strands have nick obtained un-replicated sites. The un-replicated sites on one parent's strand hold the other strand together but not daughter strands. Therefore, the resulting sister chromatids cannot separate from each other and cannot divide into 2 daughter cells. When neighboring origins fire and a fork from one origin is stalled, fork from other origin access on an opposite direction of the stalled fork and duplicate the un-replicated sites. As other mechanism of the rescue there is application of dormant replication origins that excess origins don't fire in normal DNA replication.\n\nMost bacteria do not go through a well-defined cell cycle but instead continuously copy their DNA; during rapid growth, this can result in the concurrent occurrence of multiple rounds of replication. In \"E. coli\", the best-characterized bacteria, DNA replication is regulated through several mechanisms, including: the hemimethylation and sequestering of the origin sequence, the ratio of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to adenosine diphosphate (ADP), and the levels of protein DnaA. All these control the binding of initiator proteins to the origin sequences.\n\nBecause \"E. coli\" methylates GATC DNA sequences, DNA synthesis results in hemimethylated sequences. This hemimethylated DNA is recognized by the protein SeqA, which binds and sequesters the origin sequence; in addition, DnaA (required for initiation of replication) binds less well to hemimethylated DNA. As a result, newly replicated origins are prevented from immediately initiating another round of DNA replication.\n\nATP builds up when the cell is in a rich medium, triggering DNA replication once the cell has reached a specific size. ATP competes with ADP to bind to DnaA, and the DnaA-ATP complex is able to initiate replication. A certain number of DnaA proteins are also required for DNA replication — each time the origin is copied, the number of binding sites for DnaA doubles, requiring the synthesis of more DnaA to enable another initiation of replication.\n\nResearchers commonly replicate DNA \"in vitro\" using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). PCR uses a pair of primers to span a target region in template DNA, and then polymerizes partner strands in each direction from these primers using a thermostable DNA polymerase. Repeating this process through multiple cycles amplifies the targeted DNA region. At the start of each cycle, the mixture of template and primers is heated, separating the newly synthesized molecule and template. Then, as the mixture cools, both of these become templates for annealing of new primers, and the polymerase extends from these. As a result, the number of copies of the target region doubles each round, increasing exponentially.\n\n"}
{"id": "33476062", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=33476062", "title": "Death of Muammar Gaddafi", "text": "Death of Muammar Gaddafi\n\nMuammar Gaddafi, the deposed leader of Libya, was captured and killed on 20 October 2011 during the Battle of Sirte. Gaddafi was found hiding in a culvert west of Sirte and captured by National Transitional Council forces. He was killed shortly afterwards. The NTC initially claimed he died from injuries sustained in a firefight when loyalist forces attempted to free him, although a graphic video of his last moments show rebel fighters beating him and one of them sodomizing him with a bayonet before he was shot several times as he pleaded for his life.\n\nAfter the fall of Tripoli to forces of the opposition National Transitional Council (NTC) in August 2011, Gaddafi and his family escaped the Libyan capital. He was widely rumoured to have taken refuge in the south of the country. In fact, though, Gaddafi had fled in a small convoy to Sirte on the day Tripoli fell. His son Mutassim Gaddafi followed in a second convoy.\n\nOn 19 October 2011, Libya's prime minister Mahmoud Jibril said that the former leader was believed to be in the southern desert, reestablishing his government among pro-Gaddafi tribes in the region. By that point the NTC had just taken control of the pro-Gaddafi town of Bani Walid and were close to taking control of Gaddafi's home town, the tribal heartland of Sirte east of Tripoli. According to most accounts, Gaddafi had been with heavily armed regime loyalists in several buildings in Sirte for several months as NTC forces took the city. Mansour Dhao, a member of Gaddafi's inner circle and leader of the regime's People's Guard, said that Gaddafi was \"very delusional\" and complained about the lack of electricity and water. Attempts to persuade him to flee the country and give up power were ignored. As the last loyalist district of Sirte fell, Gaddafi and other members of the government attempted to flee.\n\nAt around 01:30 local time (03:30 UTC) on 20 October 2011, Gaddafi, his army chief Abu-Bakr Yunis Jabr, his security chief Mansour Dhao, and a group of loyalists attempted to escape the violence in a convoy of 75 vehicles. A Royal Air Force reconnaissance aircraft spotted the convoy moving at high speed, after NATO forces intercepted a satellite phone call made by Gaddafi.\n\nNATO aircraft then fired on 21 of the vehicles, destroying one. A U.S. Predator drone operated from a base near Las Vegas fired the first missiles at the convoy, hitting its target about west of Sirte. Moments later, French Air Force Rafale fighter jets continued the bombing. The NATO bombing immobilized much of the convoy and killed dozens of loyalist fighters. Following the first strike, some 11 vehicles broke away from the main group and continued moving south. A second NATO airstrike damaged or destroyed 20 of these vehicles. Rebel units on the ground also struck the convoy.\n\nAccording to their statement, NATO was not aware at the time of the strike that Gaddafi was in the convoy. NATO stated that in accordance with Security Council Resolution 1973, it does not target individuals but only military assets that pose a threat. NATO later learned, \"from open sources and Allied intelligence\", that Gaddafi was in the convoy and that the strike likely contributed to his capture.\n\nAfter the airstrike, which destroyed the vehicle in front of Muammar Gaddafi's car, he and his son Mutassim, and former defence minister Abu-Bakr Yunis Jabr, took shelter in a nearby house, which was then shelled by NTC forces.\n\nMutassim then took 20 fighters and went to look for undamaged cars, having persuaded his father to come too. \"The group belly-crawled to a sand berm,\" a UN report, released in March 2012 said, and then through two drainage pipes and set up a defensive position.\n\nOne of Gaddafi's guards threw a grenade at advancing rebels on the road above, but it hit a concrete wall above the pipes and fell in front of Gaddafi. The guard tried to pick it up, but it exploded, killing both the guard and Yunis Jabr.\n\nGaddafi took refuge in a large drainage pipe with several loyalist bodyguards. A nearby group of NTC fighters opened fire, wounding Gaddafi with gunshots to his leg and back. According to one unnamed NTC fighter, one of Gaddafi's own loyalists also shot him, apparently to spare him from being captured. It is unclear if NATO aircraft were involved in helping secure Gaddafi's capture by Libyan forces on the ground. A group of rebels approached the pipe where Gaddafi was hiding and ordered him to come out, which he slowly did. He was then dragged up to his feet as rebels shouted \"Muammar, Muammar!\"\n\nHowever, a UN report released in March 2012 revealed a different account of Gaddafi's capture. Gaddafi was wounded by grenade fragmentation, from a grenade thrown by one of his own men, that bounced off a wall and fell in front of Gaddafi, that shredded his flak jacket. He sat on the floor dazed and in shock, bleeding from a wound in the left temple. Then one of his group waved a white turban in surrender.\n\nGaddafi was killed shortly afterwards. There are conflicting reports; according to one report, Gaddafi said \"Please don't shoot!\" prior to being shot, and when questioned by Misratan rebel fighters about the damage done to Misrata by his forces, denied any involvement, and begged his captors not to hit him or kill him. One fighter demanded Gaddafi stand up, but he struggled to do so. Gaddafi can be heard in one video saying \"God forbids this\" and \"Do you know right from wrong?\" when being shouted at by his captors. In a video of his arrest he can be seen draped on the hood of a car, held by rebel fighters. A senior NTC official said that no order was given to execute Gaddafi. According to another NTC source, \"they captured him alive and while he was being taken away, they beat him and then they killed him\". Mahmoud Jibril gave an alternative account, stating that \"when the car was moving it was caught in crossfire between the revolutionaries and Gaddafi forces in which he was hit by a bullet in the head.\"\n\nSeveral videos related to the death were broadcast by news channels and circulated via the Internet. The first shows footage of Gaddafi alive, his face and shirt bloodied, stumbling and being dragged toward an ambulance by armed militants chanting \"God is great\" in Arabic. The video shows Gaddafi being sodomized with a bayonet. Another shows Gaddafi, stripped to the waist, suffering from an apparent gunshot wound to the head, and in a pool of blood, together with jubilant fighters firing automatic weapons in the air. A third video, posted on YouTube, shows fighters \"hovering around his lifeless-looking body, posing for photographs and yanking his limp head up and down by the hair.\" Another video shows him being stripped naked and verbally abused by his captors.\n\nIt was stated in an October 2012 report that Gaddafi had not been killed in crossfire during his capture. He may have been executed without trial, along with 66 others, including one of his sons.\n\nGaddafi's body was taken to Misrata, where a doctor's examination disclosed he had been shot in the head and abdomen.\n\nThe interim Libyan authorities decided to keep Gaddafi's body \"for a few days\", NTC oil minister Ali Tarhouni said, \"to make sure that everybody knows he is dead.\" The body was moved to an industrial freezer where members of the public were permitted to view it until 24 October. Video shows Gaddafi's body on display in the center of an emptied public freezer in Misrata. Some people traveled hundreds of kilometres to see proof that Gaddafi was dead; one said, \"God made the pharaoh as an example to the others. If he had been a good man, we would have buried him. But he chose this destiny for himself.\" One reporter observed gunshot residue on the wounds, consistent with shots at close range.\n\nGaddafi's body was displayed alongside that of his son, Mutassim Gaddafi, who also died in the custody of Misratan fighters after his capture in Sirte on 20 October. The younger Gaddafi's body was removed from the refrigerator for burial at the same time as his father's on 24 October.\n\nAlthough an NTC spokesman said Gaddafi's body would be returned to his family with a directive to keep his burial site secret after an autopsy had determined the cause of death, the semi-autonomous military council in Misrata said it would be buried quickly instead, vetoing the idea of an autopsy. Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch called for an independent autopsy and an investigation into how Gaddafi died, but Jibril said neither step was necessary.\n\nOn 25 October, NTC representatives announced that Gaddafi's body had been buried in an unknown location in the desert early that morning, together with those of his son Mutassim Gaddafi and the regime's defense minister Abu-Bakr Yunis Jabr. A Dubai-based satellite TV channel Al Aan TV showed amateur footage of the funeral taking place at an unknown location where Islamic prayers were read. Libya's Minister for Information Mahmoud Shammam said that a fatwa had declared that \"Gaddafi should not be buried in Muslim cemeteries and should not be buried in a known place to avoid any sedition.\"\n\nMoments after it was reported that Gaddafi was killed, Fox News published an article titled \"U.S. Drone Involved in Final Qaddafi Strike, as Obama Heralds Regime's 'End'\", noting that a U.S. Predator drone was involved in the airstrike on Gaddafi's convoy in the moments before his death. An anonymous US official subsequently described their policy in hindsight as \"lead[ing] from behind\".\n\nBecause Libyan rebels had consistently told American government officials that they did not want overt foreign military assistance in toppling Gaddafi, covert military assistance was used (including arms shipments to opposition). The plan following Gaddafi's death was to immediately begin flowing humanitarian assistance to eastern Libya and later western Libya, as the symbolism would be critically important. US sources stressed it as important that they would \"not allow Turkey, Italy and others to steal a march on it\".\n\nNational Transitional Council officials also announced that one of Gaddafi's sons, Mutassim Gaddafi, once the Libyan national security advisor, was killed in Sirte the same day. A video later surfaced showing Mutassim's body lying in an ambulance. A video aired on Al Arrai television showed Mutassim alive and talking to his captors. The circumstances of his death are unclear.\n\nAnother son, Saif al-Islam Gaddafi, was captured almost a month after his father's death, whilst trying to flee to Niger.\n\nFootage had emerged earlier on 20 October of the body of Gaddafi's defence minister, Abu-Bakr Yunis Jabr. Abdul Hakim Al Jalil, the commander of the NTC's 11th brigade, stated that former Gaddafi spokesman Moussa Ibrahim had been captured near Sirte. Reports indicate that Ahmed Ibrahim, one of Gaddafi's cousins, was also captured.\n\nNumerous organizations, including the United Nations and the U.S. and UK governments, have called for an investigation of the exact circumstances of Gaddafi's death, amid controversy that it was an extrajudicial killing and a war crime. The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Navi Pillay, had said there should be a full investigation.\n\nThe UN Human Rights Office spokesperson said that he expects the UN commission already investigating potential human rights abuse in Libya would look into the case. Waheed Burshan, a member of the NTC, said that an investigation should happen.\n\nOn 24 October 2011, the NTC announced that it had ordered an investigation in response to the international calls and that it would prosecute the killers if the investigation showed he died after his capture.\nAlmost a year later, on 17 October 2012, new evidence was revealed by Human Rights Watch showing that mass killings occurred at the site of Gaddafi's death.\n\nIn its immediate aftermath, the controversial killing of Gaddafi was thought to have significant implications in the Middle East, as a critical part of the wider 'Arab Spring'. Former CIA analyst Bruce Riedel speculated that the death would intensify protesting in Syria and Yemen, and French officials stated that because of this they were \"watching the Algerian situation\".\n\nOmran Shaban, the Misrata fighter who discovered Gaddafi in the drain pipe and who had posed in photos with his golden gun, was captured by Green Resistance soldiers in Bani Walid. He was then paralysed and severely tortured. The interim president of Libya secured his release but he died some days later from his wounds in France.\n\nPrime Minister Mahmoud Jibril said he wished Gaddafi had remained alive so he could be tried for crimes against humanity, saying he had wanted to serve as Gaddafi's prosecutor, but now that he was dead, Libya would need a meticulous plan for the transition to democracy.\n\nThe unelected head of state said, \"Our forces' resistance to Gaddafi ended well, with the help of God.\" He declared Libya to be \"liberated\" at a ceremony in Benghazi on 23 October, three days after Gaddafi's death.\n\nNTC official Ali Tarhouni said on 22 October that he had instructed the military council in Misrata to keep Gaddafi's body preserved for several days in a commercial freezer \"to make sure that everybody knows he is dead\". Two days later, Tarhouni admitted that there had been human rights abuses in the Battle of Sirte, which he said the NTC condemned, and claimed the Executive Board \"did not want to put an end to that tyrant's life before bringing him to trial and making him answer questions that have always haunted Libyans\".\n\nA spokesman for the Misrata military council, Fathi Bashagha, stated the council was confident Gaddafi was dead and that he had died of wounds sustained during fighting before his capture.\n\nSaadi Gaddafi, one of Muammar Gaddafi's surviving sons in exile in Niger, said through an attorney that he was \"shocked and outraged by vicious brutality\" toward his father and his brother, Mutassim Gaddafi, and that the killing showed that the new Libyan leadership could not be trusted to hold fair trials.\n\nMany leaders and foreign ministers of European countries, as well as fellow Western countries like Australia, Canada, and the United States, made statements hailing Gaddafi's death as a positive development for Libya. The city-state of Vatican City responded to the event by declaring it recognised the National Transitional Council as Libya's legitimate government. World leaders such as Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, and Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard suggested that the death of Gaddafi meant the Libyan Civil War was over. Some officials, such as UK Foreign Secretary William Hague, expressed disappointment that Gaddafi was not brought back alive and allowed to stand trial. The United States' Secretary of State at the time, Hillary Clinton, laughingly stated \"We came. We saw. He died.\"\n\nReaction from the governments of countries including Cuba, Russia, Venezuela, Nicaragua, was negative. Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez described the former Libyan leader's death as an \"assassination\" and an \"outrage\", and Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega later called his killing a \"crime\" during his inauguration on 10 January 2012. Officials of Iran showed considerably diverse reactions.\n\nThe video reportedly left a particularly strong, and consequential, impression on Russia's Vladimir Putin. A senior diplomat who had served at the US embassy in Moscow under the Obama administration reportedly claimed that \"Putin had been appalled by Gaddafi’s fate\" to the extent that \"Putin had watched a video of Gaddafi’s savage death three times, a video that shows him being sodomised with a bayonet.\" Referring to the U.S. coalition's lobbying efforts for the airstrikes at the U.N., the U.S. diplomat is quoted as saying that a later U.S. intelligence assessment concluded that \"Putin blamed himself for letting Gaddafi go, for not playing a strong role behind the scenes\" and that the video may have even influenced Putin's decision to support Syrian President Bashar al-Assad during the Syrian civil war since \"Putin believed that unless he got engaged Bashar would suffer the same fate – mutilated – and he’d see the destruction of his allies in Syria.\"\nPutin also lashed out at the U.S. for the illegal killing of Gaddafi and asked \"They showed to the whole world how he (Gaddafi) was killed; there was blood all over. Is that what they call a democracy?\"\n\nImmediately after Gaddafi's death, NATO released a statement denying it knew beforehand that Gaddafi was travelling in the convoy it struck. Admiral James G. Stavridis, NATO's top officer, said the death of Gaddafi meant that NATO would likely wind down its operations in Libya. Anders Fogh Rasmussen, the NATO secretary-general, said NATO would \"terminate [its] mission in coordination with the United Nations and the National Transitional Council\".\n"}
{"id": "2209444", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2209444", "title": "Disappearance of Etan Patz", "text": "Disappearance of Etan Patz\n\nEtan Kalil Patz (; October 9, 1972 – May 25, 1979; declared legally dead in 2001) was an American boy who was six years old on May 25, 1979, when he disappeared on his way to his school bus stop in the SoHo neighborhood of Lower Manhattan. His disappearance helped launch the missing children movement, which included new legislation and new methods for tracking down missing children. Several years after he disappeared, Patz was one of the first children to be profiled on the \"photo on a milk carton\" campaigns of the early 1980s. In 1983, President Ronald Reagan designated May 25—the anniversary of Etan's disappearance—as National Missing Children's Day in the United States.\n\nDecades later, it was determined that Etan had been abducted and murdered the same day that he went missing. The case was reopened in 2010 by the Manhattan District Attorney's office. In 2012, the FBI excavated the basement of the alleged crime scene near the Patz residence but discovered no new evidence. Pedro Hernandez—a suspect who confessed— was charged and indicted later that year on charges of second-degree murder and first-degree kidnapping. In 2014, the case went through a series of hearings to determine whether or not Hernandez's statements before he received his Miranda rights were legally admissible at trial. His trial began in January 2015 and ended in a mistrial that May, when one of the 12 jurors held out. The retrial began on October 19, 2016, and concluded on February 14, 2017, after nine days of deliberations, when the jury found Hernandez guilty of murder and kidnapping. Hernandez was sentenced to 25-years-to-life in prison on April 18, 2017. Hernandez will not be eligible for parole for 25 years.\n\nOn the morning of May 25, 1979, Etan left his SoHo apartment at 113 Prince Street by himself for the first time, planning to walk two blocks to board a school bus at West Broadway and Prince Street. He was wearing a black \"Future Flight Captain\" pilot cap, a blue corduroy jacket, blue jeans and blue sneakers with fluorescent stripes. He never got on the bus.\n\nAt school, Etan's teacher noticed his absence but did not report it to the principal. When Etan did not return home after school, his mother Julie called the police. At first, detectives considered the Patzes to be possible suspects but quickly determined they had no involvement. An intense search began that evening, using nearly 100 police officers and a team of bloodhounds. The search continued for weeks. Neighbors and police canvassed the city and placed missing-child posters featuring Etan's portrait, but this resulted in few leads.\n\nEtan's father Stanley was a professional photographer and had a collection of photographs he had taken of his son. His photos of Etan were printed on countless missing-child posters and milk cartons. They were also projected on screens in Times Square.\n\nAssistant United States Attorney Stuart R. GraBois received the case in 1985 and identified Jose Antonio Ramos, a convicted child sexual abuser who had been a friend of Etan's former babysitters, as the primary suspect. In 1982, multiple boys had accused Ramos of trying to lure them into a drain pipe in the area where Ramos was living. When police searched the drain pipe, they found photographs of Ramos and young boys who resembled Etan. GraBois eventually found out that Ramos had been in custody in Pennsylvania in connection with an unrelated child molestation case. In 1990, GraBois was deputized as a deputy state attorney general in Pennsylvania to help prosecute a case against Ramos for sexually abusing children and to obtain further information about Etan's case. When first questioned by GraBois, Ramos stated that, on the day when Etan disappeared, he had taken a young boy back to his apartment to rape him. Ramos said that he was \"90 percent sure\" it was the boy whom he later saw on television. However, Ramos did not use Etan's name. He also claimed he had \"put the boy on a subway\".\n\nIn 1991, while Ramos was incarcerated, a jailhouse informant told GraBois and FBI agent Mary Galligan that Ramos had told him he knew what had happened to Etan. Ramos even drew a map of Etan's school bus route, indicating that he knew that Etan's bus stop was the third one on the route. In a special feature on missing children, the \"New York Post\" reported on October 21, 1999, that Ramos was the prime suspect in Etan's disappearance. Ramos had been known by the Patz family and was the prime suspect all along, but in the early 1980s authorities were unable to prosecute Ramos.\n\nEtan's body was never found; he was declared legally dead in 2001. Stan and Julie Patz pursued and won a civil case against Ramos in 2004. They were awarded a symbolic sum of $2 million, which they have never collected. Ramos has never been criminally prosecuted for the murder of Etan. Every year, on Etan's birthday and the anniversary of his disappearance, Stan Patz sent Ramos a copy of his son's missing-child poster. On the back, he typed the same message: \"What did you do to my little boy?\"\n\nRamos has denied that he killed Etan. He served a 20-year prison sentence in the State Correctional Institution in Dallas, Pennsylvania, for child molestation. He was released from prison on November 7, 2012. Soon after his release he was arrested on a Megan's Law violation.\n\nStan and Julie Patz had the 2004 judgment against Ramos dismissed after the 2015 trial of Pedro Hernandez convinced them that Ramos was not responsible for their son's death.\n\nManhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance, Jr. officially reopened the case on May 25, 2010. On April 19, 2012, Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and New York City Police Department (NYPD) investigators began the SoHo basement of 127-B Prince Street, near the Patz home. This residence had been newly refurbished shortly after Etan's disappearance in 1979, and the basement had been the workshop and storage space of a handyman. After a four-day search, investigators announced that there was \"nothing conclusive found.\"\n\nOn May 24, 2012, New York Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly announced that a man was in custody who had implicated himself in Etan's disappearance. According to \"The New York Times\", a law enforcement official identified the man as 51-year-old Pedro Hernandez of Maple Shade, New Jersey, and said that he had confessed to strangling the child. He stated in his written confession to police, \"I’m sorry, I shoke [sic] him.\" According to a 2009 book about the case, \"After Etan\", Etan had a dollar and had told his parents he planned to buy a soda to drink with his lunch. At the time of Etan's disappearance, Hernandez was an 18-year-old convenience store worker in a neighborhood bodega. Hernandez said that he later threw Etan's remains into the garbage. Hernandez was charged with second-degree murder. According to a \"New York Times\" report from May 25, 2012, the police at that time had no physical evidence to corroborate his confession.\n\nIn 2012 a man from New Jersey, Jose Lopez, reached out to investigators: He believed that Hernandez, Lopez's brother-in-law, was in fact responsible for Etan's disappearance. Statements by Hernandez's sister, Nina Hernandez, and Tomas Rivera, leader of a Charismatic Christianity group at St. Anthony of Padua, a Roman Catholic church in Camden, New Jersey, indicated that Hernandez may have publicly confessed to murdering Etan in the presence of fellow parishioners in the early 1980s. According to Hernandez's sister, it was an \"open family secret that he had confessed in the church.\" A New York grand jury indicted Hernandez on November 14, 2012, on charges of second-degree murder and first-degree kidnapping. His lawyer has stated that Hernandez was diagnosed with schizotypal personality disorder, which includes hallucinations. The lawyer has also said his client has a low intelligence quotient (IQ) of around 70, \"at the border of intellectual disability.\"\n\nOn December 12, 2012, Hernandez pleaded not guilty to two counts of murder and one count of kidnapping in a New York court. In April 2013, Harvey Fishbein, Hernandez's legal aid criminal defense lawyer, filed a motion to dismiss the case, citing that Hernandez's \"confession in one of the nation's most notorious child disappearances was false, peppered with questionable claims and made after almost seven hours of police questioning\". The next month, however, New York Supreme Court Justice Maxwell Wiley ruled that the evidence was \"legally sufficient to support the charges\" and that the case could move forward. He also ordered a hearing to determine whether the defendant's statements could be used at trial.\n\nHernandez had a hearing in September 2014 about whether his statements made prior to police giving him his Miranda rights were legally admissible at trial. This would be influenced by whether or not he felt free to leave during the time before he was informed of his Miranda rights. The hearing was also to determine whether or not he understood the significance of the Miranda rights and was competent to waive them when he did so. This was significant because it would decide whether any statements made after that point by Hernandez were legally admissible at trial. The actual truth or falsehood of the statements was not the focus of the hearing; rather, the question of the statements' truthfulness was to be discussed in the trial, which began on January 5, 2015.\n\nThe case resulted in a mistrial in May 2015 due to a hung jury, which was deadlocked 11 against 1 for conviction. A retrial began on October 19, 2016, in a New York City court, with jury deliberations in February 2017. On February 14, 2017, Hernandez was found guilty of kidnapping and felony murder. Sentencing was scheduled on February 28, with Hernandez facing up to 25 years to life in prison. However, Hernandez's attorneys were granted a delay so as to be able to challenge the verdict, and no new sentencing date was set.\n\nOn April 18, 2017, Hernandez was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole for 25 years.\n\nIn 1983, the May 25 anniversary of Etan Patz's disappearance was designated National Missing Children's Day in the United States. In 2001, the tribute spread worldwide. The International Centre for Missing & Exploited Children (ICMEC) coordinates the \"Help Bring Them Home\" campaign in 22 countries in conjunction with International Missing Children's Day.\n\nThe extensive media attention given to Etan's disappearance has been credited with creating greater attention to missing children, resulting in changes such as less willingness to allow children to walk to school, photos of missing children being printed on milk cartons, and promotion of the concept of \"stranger danger\", the idea that all adults not known to the child must be regarded as potential sources of danger.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "48081", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=48081", "title": "Essentialism", "text": "Essentialism\n\nEssentialism is the view that every entity has a set of attributes that are necessary to its identity and function. In early Western thought Plato's idealism held that all things have such an \"essence\"—an \"idea\" or \"form\". In \"Categories\", Aristotle similarly proposed that all objects have a substance that, as George Lakoff put it \"make the thing what it is, and without which it would be not \"that\" kind of thing\". The contrary view—non-essentialism—denies the need to posit such an \"essence'\".\n\nEssentialism has been controversial from its beginning. Plato, in the \"Parmenides Dialogue\", depicts Socrates questioning the notion, suggesting that if we accept the idea that every beautiful thing or just action partakes of an essence to be beautiful or just, we must also accept the \"existence of separate essences for hair, mud, and dirt\" . In biology and other natural sciences, essentialism provided the rationale for taxonomy at least until the time of Charles Darwin; the role and importance of essentialism in biology is still a matter of debate.\nIn gender studies the essentialist idea that men and women are fundamentally different continues to be a matter of contention.\n\nAn \"essence\" characterizes a substance or a form, in the sense of the forms and ideas in Platonic idealism. It is permanent, unalterable, and eternal, is and present in every possible world. Classical humanism has an essentialist conception of the human, in its endorsement of the notion of an eternal and unchangeable human nature. This has been criticized by Kierkegaard, Marx, Heidegger, Sartre, and many other existential and materialist thinkers.\n\nIn Plato's philosophy (in particular, the \"Timaeus\" and the \"Philebus\"), things were said to come into being by the action of a demiurge who works to form chaos into ordered entities. Many definitions of \"essence\" hark back to the ancient Greek hylomorphic understanding of the formation of the things. According to that account, the structure and real existence of any thing can be understood by analogy to an artefact produced by a craftsperson. The craftsperson requires \"hyle\" (timber or wood) and a model, plan or idea in her own mind, according to which the wood is worked to give it the indicated contour or form (\"morphe\"). Aristotle was the first to use the terms \"hyle\" and \"morphe\". According to his explanation, all entities have two aspects: \"matter\" and \"form\". It is the particular form imposed that gives some matter its identity—its quiddity or \"whatness\" (i.e., its \"what it is\").\n\nPlato was one of the first essentialists, postulating the concept of ideal forms—an abstract entity of which individual objects are mere facsimiles. To give an example: the ideal form of a circle is a perfect circle, something that is physically impossible to make manifest; yet the circles we draw and observe clearly have some \"idea\" in common—the ideal form. Plato proposed that these ideas are eternal and vastly superior to their manifestations, and that we understand these manifestations in the material world by comparing and relating them to their respective ideal form. Plato's forms are regarded as patriarchs to essentialist dogma simply because they are a case of what is intrinsic and a-contextual of objects—the abstract properties that makes them what they are. (For more on forms, read Plato's parable of the cave.)\n\nKarl Popper splits the ambiguous term \"realism\" into \"essentialism\" and \"realism\". He uses \"essentialism\" whenever he means the opposite of nominalism, and \"realism\" only as opposed to idealism. Popper himself is a realist as opposed to an idealist, but a methodological nominalist as opposed to an essentialist. For example, statements like \"a puppy is a young dog\" should be read from right to left, as an answer to \"What shall we call a young dog\"; never from left to right as an answer to \"What is a puppy?\"\n\nEssentialism, in its broadest sense, is any philosophy that acknowledges the primacy of \"essence\". Unlike existentialism, which posits \"being\" as the fundamental reality, the essentialist ontology must be approached from a metaphysical perspective. Empirical knowledge is developed from experience of a relational universe whose components and attributes are defined and measured in terms of intellectually constructed laws. Thus, for the scientist, reality is explored as an evolutionary system of diverse entities, the order of which is determined by the principle of causality.\n\nPlato believed that the universe was perfect and that its observed imperfections came from man's limited perception of it. For Plato, there were two realities: the \"essential\" or ideal and the \"perceived\". Aristotle (384–322 B.C.) applied the term \"essence\" to that which things in a category have in common and without which they cannot be members of that category (for example, \"rationality\" is the essence of man; without rationality a creature cannot be a man). In his critique of Aristotle's philosophy, Bertrand Russell said that his concept of essence transferred to metaphysics what was only a verbal convenience and that it confused the properties of language with the properties of the world. In fact, a thing's \"essence\" consisted in those defining properties without which we could not use the \"name\" for it. Although the concept of essence was \"hopelessly muddled\" it became part of every philosophy until modern times.\n\nThe Egyptian-born philosopher Plotinus (204–270 CE) brought idealism to the Roman Empire as Neoplatonism, and with it the concept that not only do all existents emanate from a \"primary essence\" but that the mind plays an active role in shaping or ordering the objects of perception, rather than passively receiving empirical data.\n\nDespite the metaphysical basis for the term, academics in science, aesthetics, heuristics, psychology, and gender-based sociological studies have advanced their causes under the banner of essentialism. Possibly the clearest definition for this philosophy was offered by gay/lesbian rights advocate Diana Fuss, who wrote: \"Essentialism is most commonly understood as a belief in the real, true essence of things, the invariable and fixed properties which define the 'whatness' of a given entity.\" Metaphysical essentialism stands diametrically opposed to existential realism in that finite existence is only differentiated appearance, whereas \"ultimate reality\" is held to be absolute essence.\n\nAmong contemporary essentialists, what all existing things have in common is \"the power to exist\", which defines their \"uncreated\" Essence.\n\nIn 2010, an article by Gerald B. Folland in the \"Notices of the American Mathematical Society\" stated, \"It is a truth universally acknowledged that almost all mathematicians are Platonists, at least when they are actually doing mathematics …\" This refers to their implicit embrace of essentialism, which he finds revealed in mathematicians peculiar use of language. Whereas physicists define Lie algebra as a rule they can apply to facts, mathematicians define it as an essence of a structure, independent of any circumstance.\n\nThere is a difference between metaphysical essentialism (see above) and psychological essentialism, the latter referring not to an actual claim about the world but a claim about a way of representing entities in cognitions (Medin, 1989). Influential in this area is Susan Gelman, who has outlined many domains in which children and adults construe classes of entities, particularly biological entities, in essentialist terms—i.e., as if they had an immutable underlying essence which can be used to predict unobserved similarities between members of that class. (Toosi & Ambady, 2011). This causal relationship is unidirectional; an observable feature of an entity does not define the underlying essence (Dar-Nimrod & Heine, 2011).\n\nEssentialism has emerged as an important concept in psychology, particularly developmental psychology. Gelman and Kremer (1991) studied the extent to which children from 4–7 years old demonstrate essentialism. Children were able to identify the cause of behaviour in living and non-living objects. Children understood that underlying essences predicted observable behaviours. Participants could correctly describe living objects' behaviour as self-perpetuated and non-living objects as a result of an adult influencing the object's actions. This is a biological way of representing essential features in cognitions. Understanding the underlying causal mechanism for behaviour suggests essentialist thinking (Rangel and Keller, 2011).\nYounger children were unable to identify causal mechanisms of behaviour whereas older children were able to. This suggests that essentialism is rooted in cognitive development. It can be argued that there is a shift in the way that children represent entities, from not understanding the causal mechanism of the underlying essence to showing sufficient understanding (Demoulin, Leyens & Yzerbyt, 2006).\n\nThere are four key criteria which constitute essentialist thinking. The first facet is the aforementioned individual causal mechanisms (del Rio & Strasser, 2011). The second is innate potential: the assumption that an object will fulfill its predetermined course of development (Kanovsky, 2007). According to this criterion, essences predict developments in entities that will occur throughout its lifespan. The third is immutability (Holtz & Wagner, 2009). Despite altering the superficial appearance of an object it does not remove its essence. Observable changes in features of an entity are not salient enough to alter its essential characteristics. The fourth is inductive potential (Birnbaum, Deeb, Segall, Ben-Aliyahu & Diesendruck, 2010). This suggests that entities may share common features but are essentially different. However similar two beings may be, their characteristics will be at most analogous, differing most importantly in essences.\n\nThe implications of psychological essentialism are numerous. Prejudiced individuals have been found to endorse exceptionally essential ways of thinking, suggesting that essentialism may perpetuate exclusion among social groups (Morton, Hornsey & Postmes, 2009). This may be due to an over-extension of an essential-biological mode of thinking stemming from cognitive development. Paul Bloom of Yale University has stated that \"one of the most exciting ideas in cognitive science is the theory that people have a default assumption that things, people and events have invisible essences that make them what they are. Experimental psychologists have argued that essentialism underlies our understanding of the physical and social worlds, and developmental and cross-cultural psychologists have proposed that it is instinctive and universal. We are natural-born essentialists.\" Scholars suggest that the categorical nature of essentialist thinking predicts the use of stereotypes and can be targeted in the application of stereotype prevention (Bastian & Haslam, 2006).\n\nClassical essentialists claim that some things are wrong in an absolute sense. For example murder breaks a universal, objective and natural moral law and not merely an advantageous, socially or ethically constructed one.\n\nMany modern essentialists claim that right and wrong are moral boundaries that are individually constructed; in other words, things that are ethically right or wrong are actions that the individual deems to be beneficial or harmful, respectively.\n\nOne possibility is that before evolution was developed as a scientific theory, there existed an essentialist view of biology that posited all species to be unchanging throughout time. The historian Mary P. Winsor has argued that biologists such as Louis Agassiz in the 19th century believed that taxa such as species and genus were fixed, reflecting the mind of the creator. Some religious opponents of evolution continue to maintain this view of biology.\n\nRecent work by historians of systematic biology has, however, cast doubt upon this view of pre-Darwinian thinkers. Winsor, Ron Amundson and Staffan Müller-Wille have each argued that in fact the usual suspects (such as Linnaeus and the Ideal Morphologists) were very far from being essentialists, and it appears that the so-called \"essentialism story\" (or \"myth\") in biology is a result of conflating the views expressed by philosophers from Aristotle onwards through to John Stuart Mill and William Whewell in the immediately pre-Darwinian period, using biological examples, with the use of terms in biology like species.\n\nIn feminist theory and gender studies, gender essentialism is the attribution of a fixed essence to women. Women's essence is assumed to be universal and is generally identified with those characteristics viewed as being specifically feminine. These ideas of femininity are usually biologized and are often preoccupied with psychological characteristics, such as nurturance, empathy, support, and non-competitiveness, etc. Feminist theorist Elizabeth Grosz states in her 1995 publication \"Space, time and perversion: essays on the politics of bodies\" that essentialism \"entails the belief that those characteristics defined as women's essence are shared in common by all women at all times. It implies a limit of the variations and possibilities of change—it is not possible for a subject to act in a manner contrary to her essence. Her essence underlies all the apparent variations differentiating women from each other. Essentialism thus refers to the existence of fixed characteristic, given attributes, and ahistorical functions that limit the possibilities of change and thus of social reorganization.\"\n\nGender essentialism is pervasive in popular culture, as illustrated by the #1 \"New York Times\" best seller \"Men Are from Mars, Women Are from Venus\", but this essentialism is routinely critiqued in introductory women studies textbooks such as \"Women: Images & Realities\".\n\nStarting in the 1980s, some feminist writers have put forward essentialist theories about gender and science. Evelyn Fox Keller, Sandra Harding,\n\nEssentialism in history as a field of study entails discerning and listing essential cultural characteristics of a particular nation or culture, in the belief that a people or culture can be understood in this way. Sometimes such essentialism leads to claims of a praiseworthy national or cultural identity, or to its opposite, the condemnation of a culture based on presumed essential characteristics. Herodotus, for example, claims that Egyptian culture is essentially feminized and possesses a \"softness\" which has made Egypt easy to conquer. To what extent Herodotus was an essentialist is a matter of debate; he is also credited with not essentializing the concept of the Athenian identity, or differences between the Greeks and the Persians that are the subject of his \"Histories\".\n\nEssentialism had been operative in colonialism as well as in critiques of colonialism.\n\nPost-colonial theorists such as Edward Said insisted that essentialism was the \"defining mode\" of \"Western\" historiography and ethnography until the nineteenth century and even after, according to Touraj Atabaki, manifesting itself in the historiography of the Middle East and Central Asia as Eurocentrism, over-generalization, and reductionism.\n\nMost historians reject essentialism because it \"dehistoricizes the process of social and cultural changes\" and tends to see non-Western societies as historically unchanging; in India this led to the anti-essentialist (even anti-historiographical) school of Subaltern Studies.\n\n\n\n\n"}

On May 18, 1994, the FDA completed its evaluation of the Flavr Savr tomato and the use of APH(3')II, concluding that the tomato \"is as safe as tomatoes bred by conventional means\" and \"that the use of aminoglycoside 3'-phosphotransferase II is safe for use as a processing aid in the development of new varieties of tomato, rapeseed oil, and cotton intended for food use.\" It was first sold in 1994, and was only available for a few years before production ceased in 1997. Calgene made history, but mounting costs prevented the company from becoming profitable, and it was eventually acquired by Monsanto Company.\n\nThrough genetic engineering, Calgene hoped to slow down the ripening process of the tomato and thus prevent it from softening, while still allowing the tomato to retain its natural colour and flavour. The tomato was made more resistant to rotting by adding an antisense gene which interferes with the production of the enzyme polygalacturonase. The enzyme normally degrades pectin in the cell walls and results in the softening of fruit which makes them more susceptible to being damaged by fungal infections. Some unmodified tomatoes are picked before fully ripened and are then artificially ripened using ethylene gas which acts as a plant hormone. Picking the fruit while unripe allows for easier handling and extended shelf-life. Flavr Savr tomatoes, on the other hand, could be allowed to ripen on the vine, without compromising their shelf-life. The intended effect of slowing down the softening of Flavr Savr tomatoes would allow the vine-ripe fruits to be harvested like green tomatoes without greater damage to the tomato itself. The Flavr Savr turned out to disappoint researchers in that respect, as the antisensed PG gene had a positive effect on shelf life, but not on the fruit's firmness, so the tomatoes still had to be harvested like any other unmodified vine-ripe tomatoes. An improved flavor, later achieved through traditional breeding of Flavr Savr and better tasting varieties, would also contribute to selling Flavr Savr at a premium price at the supermarket.\n\nThe FDA stated that special labeling for these modified tomatoes was not necessary because they have the essential characteristics of non-modified tomatoes. Specifically, there was no evidence for health risks, and the nutritional content was unchanged.\n\nThe failure of the Flavr Savr has been attributed to Calgene's inexperience in the business of growing and shipping tomatoes.\n\nIn the UK, Zeneca produced a tomato paste that used technology similar to the Flavr Savr. Don Grierson was involved in the research to make the genetically modified tomato. Due to the characteristics of the tomato, it was cheaper to produce than conventional tomato paste, resulting in the product being 20% cheaper. Between 1996 and 1999, 1.8 million cans, clearly labelled as genetically engineered, were sold in the major supermarket chains Sainsbury's and Safeway UK. At one point the paste outsold normal tomato paste but sales fell in the autumn of 1998.\n\nThe House of Commons of the United Kingdom published a report in which they stated that the decline in sales during this period was linked to changing consumer perceptions of genetically modified crops. The report identified several possible factors, including product labeling and perception of choice, lobbying campaigns, and media attention. It concluded that the tone of media reports on the subject underwent a \"fundamental shift\" in response to a high-profile incident in which Dr. Arpad Pusztai, a researcher for Rowett Research Institute, was fired after making a televised claim about detrimental health effects in lab rats fed a diet of genetically modified potatoes (see the Pusztai affair). Subsequent peer review and testimony by Dr. Pusztai led the House Science and Technology Select Committee to conclude that his initial claim was \"contradicted by his own evidence.\" In the intervening period, Sainsbury's and Safeway both pledged that none of their house brand products would contain genetically modified ingredients.\n\n"}

Grant\n\nGeorge McInvale Grant (July 11, 1897 – November 4, 1982) was a Democratic Representative from Alabama.\n\nGrant was born in Louisville, Alabama. He obtained a law degree from University of Alabama in 1922. He was admitted to the bar the same year and opened a law practice in Troy, Alabama, near Montgomery.\n\nHe was a private and aviation cadet in the aviation section of the Signal Corps of the United States Army in 1918 and 1919. He was county solicitor (district attorney) of Pike County, Alabama from 1927 to 1937.\n\nWhen Representative Lister Hill was appointed to the US Senate in 1938, Grant won the Democratic nomination to succeed him in the special election. Then, Democratic nomination was tantamount to election in Alabama, and he took office on June 14. He won a full term that November and was reelected 11 more times from the Montgomery-based district. In 1957, he voted against the Civil Rights Act of 1957.\n\nIn 1964, Grant faced his first credible opponent in the Democratic primary when former Rear Admiral John G. Crommelin challenged him. Crommelin ran well to Grant's right, giving speeches full of racist and anti-Semitic rhetoric. Grant managed to fend him off, but in November, he faced a Republican for the first time ever in William Louis Dickinson. Grant lost by a shocking 25-point margin, which was all the more remarkable since most of the district's living residents had never been represented by a Republican. However, most of the 2nd's residents turned against the Democrats because of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, a major factor behind Barry Goldwater carrying the state that year. The 2nd District remained in Republican hands until 2008 and regained it in 2010.\n\nGrant returned to his law practice in Troy, but later moved to Washington, D.C. and became a lobbyist. He lived in Washington until the time of his death on November 4, 1982, at sea, aboard the Queen Elizabeth II. He was interred at Arlington National Cemetery, Arlington, Virginia.\n"}
{"id": "30294906", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30294906", "title": "Gravity (2013 film)", "text": "Gravity (2013 film)\n\nGravity is a 2013 science fiction thriller film directed, co-written, co-edited, and produced by Alfonso Cuarón. It stars Sandra Bullock and George Clooney as American astronauts who are stranded in space after the mid-orbit destruction of their space shuttle, and their subsequent attempt to return to Earth.\n\nCuarón wrote the screenplay with his son Jonás and attempted to develop the film at Universal Pictures. Later, the distribution rights were acquired by Warner Bros. Pictures. David Heyman, who previously worked with Cuarón on \"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban\" (2004), produced the film with him. \"Gravity\" was produced entirely in the United Kingdom, where British visual effects company Framestore spent more than three years creating most of the film's visual effects, which make up over 80 of its 91 minutes.\n\n\"Gravity\" opened the 70th Venice International Film Festival on August 28, 2013 and had its North American premiere three days later at the Telluride Film Festival. Upon its release, \"Gravity\" was met with critical acclaim. Particular praise was given to Emmanuel Lubezki's cinematography, Steven Price's musical score, Cuarón's direction, Bullock's performance, Framestore's visual effects, and its use of 3D. Considered one of the best films of 2013, it appeared on numerous critics' year-end lists, and was selected by the American Film Institute in their annual \"Movies of the Year\" list. The film became the eighth highest-grossing film of 2013 with a worldwide gross of over $723 million, against a production budget of $100 million.\n\nThe film earned accolades from numerous critics and guilds. At the 86th Academy Awards, \"Gravity\" received ten nominations, including Best Actress for Bullock and Best Picture, and won seven awards, including Best Director, Best Original Score, Best Cinematography and Best Visual Effects. The film was also awarded six BAFTA Awards, including Outstanding British Film and Best Director, the Golden Globe Award for Best Director, seven Critics' Choice Movie Awards, and the 2013 Ray Bradbury Award.\n\nNASA Space Shuttle \"Explorer\", commanded by veteran astronaut Matt Kowalski, is in Earth orbit on mission STS-157 to service the Hubble Space Telescope. Dr. Ryan Stone is aboard on her first space mission as a mission specialist, her job being to perform a set of hardware upgrades on the Hubble. During a spacewalk, Mission Control in Houston warns \"Explorer's\" crew about a Russian missile strike on a defunct satellite, which has inadvertently caused a chain reaction forming a rapidly-expanding cloud of space debris, ordering the crew to return to Earth immediately. Communication with Mission Control is lost shortly thereafter as more and more communication satellites are knocked out by the debris.\n\nHigh-speed debris strikes the \"Explorer\" and Hubble, tearing Stone from the shuttle and leaving her tumbling through space. Kowalski, using a Manned Maneuvering Unit (MMU), rescues Stone, and they return to the \"Explorer\", soon discovering that the Shuttle has suffered catastrophic damage and the rest of the crew are dead. Stone and Kowalski decide to use the MMU to reach the International Space Station, which is in orbit about away, Kowalski estimating that they have 90 minutes before the debris field completes an orbit and threatens them again.\n\nOn their way to the International Space Station (ISS), the two discuss Stone's home life and her daughter, who died young in an accident. As they approach the station, they see that the ISS's crew has evacuated into one of its two Soyuz spacecraft, the remaining Soyuz's parachute being prematurely deployed, rendering it unable to return to Earth. Kowalski suggests using it to travel to the nearby Chinese space station \"Tiangong\", away, in order to board its Shenzhou spacecraft and return safely to Earth in the re-entry capsule. Out of air and maneuvering fuel, the two try to grab onto the ISS; Stone's leg gets entangled in the Soyuz's parachute cords and she grabs a strap on Kowalski's suit, but it soon becomes clear that the cords will not support them both. Despite Stone's protests, Kowalski detaches himself from the tether to save her from drifting away with him. Stone is pulled back towards the ISS, while Kowalski floats away.\n\nStone enters the space station via the airlock of the Pirs Docking Compartment. She cannot re-establish communication with Kowalski nor Earth and concludes that she is now the sole survivor. Inside the station, a fire breaks out, forcing her to rush to the Soyuz. As she maneuvers the Soyuz away from the ISS, the tangled parachute tethers snag, preventing the spacecraft from leaving; Stone performs a spacewalk to cut the cables, succeeding just as the debris field returns, destroying the station. Stone angles the Soyuz towards \"Tiangong\", but soon discovers that the Soyuz's engine has no fuel.\n\nAfter a poignant attempt at radio communication with an Eskimo on Earth, Stone resigns herself to her fate and shuts down the cabin's oxygen supply to commit suicide. As she begins to lose consciousness, Kowalski enters the capsule, scolding her for giving up. He tells her to rig the Soyuz's soft landing rockets to propel the capsule toward \"Tiangong\" before disappearing. Realizing Kowalski's appearance was a hallucination, Stone regains the will to go on, restoring the spacecraft's oxygen flow and rigging the landing rockets to propel the capsule towards \"Tiangong\".\n\nUnable to dock with Tiangong, Stone ejects herself from the Soyuz and uses a fire extinguisher as a makeshift thruster to travel to the rapidly deorbiting \"Tiangong\". Stone manages to enter \"Tiangong's\" Shenzhou spacecraft just as the station enters the upper atmosphere, unlocking its re-entry capsule just in time.\n\nThe \"Shenzhou\" capsule re-enters the atmosphere successfully; however, during the descent it is damaged by debris from the disintegrating Tiangong and a fire starts inside the capsule. The capsule lands in a lake, but dense smoke forces Stone to evacuate immediately after splashdown, shedding her spacesuit and swimming ashore. Stone shakily takes her first steps back on land.\n\n\nAlthough \"Gravity\" is often referred to in the media as a science fiction film, Cuarón told BBC that he sees the film rather as \"a drama of a woman in space\". According to him, the main theme of the film was \"adversity\" and he uses the debris as a metaphor for this.\n\nDespite being set in space, the film uses motifs from shipwreck and wilderness survival stories about psychological change and resilience in the aftermath of a catastrophe. Cuarón uses the character, Stone, to illustrate clarity of mind, persistence, training, and improvisation in the face of isolation and the consequences of a relentless Murphy's law. The film incorporates spiritual or existential themes, in the facts of Stone's daughter's accidental and meaningless death, and in the necessity of summoning the will to survive in the face of overwhelming odds, without future certainties, and with the impossibility of rescue from personal dissolution without finding this willpower. Calamities occur but only the surviving astronauts see them.\n\nThe impact of scenes is heightened by alternating between objective and subjective perspectives, the warm face of the Earth and the depths of dark space, the chaos and unpredictability of the debris field, and silence in the vacuum of space with the background score giving the desired effect. The film uses very long, uninterrupted shots throughout to draw the audience into the action, but contrasts these with claustrophobic shots within space suits and capsules.\n\nHuman evolution and the resilience of life may also be seen as key themes of \"Gravity\". The film opens with the exploration of spacethe vanguard of human civilizationand ends with an allegory of the dawn of mankind when Dr. Ryan Stone fights her way out of the water after the crash-landing, passing a frog, grabs the soil, and slowly regains her capacity to stand upright and walk. Director Cuarón said, \"She's in these murky waters almost like an amniotic fluid or a primordial soup, in which you see amphibians swimming. She crawls out of the water, not unlike early creatures in evolution. And then she goes on all fours. And after going on all fours she's a bit curved until she is completely erect. It was the evolution of life in one, quick shot\". Other imagery depicting the formation of life includes a scene in which Stone rests in an embryonic position, surrounded by a rope strongly resembling an umbilical cord. Stone's return from space, accompanied by meteorite-like debris, may be seen as a hint that elements essential to the development of life on Earth may have come from outer space in the form of meteorites.\nThe film also suggests themes of humanity's ubiquitous strategy of existential resilience; that, across cultures, individuals must postulate meaning, beyond material existence, wherever none can be perceived.\n\nSome commentators have noted possible religious themes in the film. For instance, Fr. Robert Barron in \"The Catholic Register\" summarizes the tension between \"Gravity\"'s technology and religious symbolism. He said, \"The technology which this film legitimately celebrates ... can't save us, and it can't provide the means by which we establish real contact with each other. The Ganges in the sun, the St. Christopher icon, the statue of Budai, and above all, a visit from a denizen of heaven, signal that there is a dimension of reality that lies beyond what technology can master or access  ...  the reality of God\".\n\nAs a child, Alfonso Cuarón had an affinity for space programs and dreamed of becoming an astronaut and would watch live moon landings on television. He was 8 years old when Apollo 11 landed on the moon in 1969 and was profoundly influenced by Neil Armstrong. At that time his grandmother bought a new color TV in order to be able to see the moon landing that was in black and white. He watched space films like \"A Trip to the Moon\" (1902) and was further drawn to films featuring the technology of space exploration, and trying to honor the laws of physics such as \"Marooned\" (1969) and \"Woman in the Moon\" (1929). After Cuarón and his son, Jonás finished the screenplay, Cuarón attempted to develop his project at Universal Pictures, where it stayed in development for several years. After the rights to the project were sold, it began development at Warner Bros.\n\nCuarón co-wrote the screenplay with his son Jonás Cuarón. However, Cuarón never intended to make a space film. Before conceiving the story, he started out with a theme; the theme of adversity. He would discuss survival scenarios with Jonás in hostile, isolated locations, such as the desert (Jonás wrote a desert film, \"Desierto\", which was released in 2015). Finally, he decided to take it to an extreme place where there's nothing, \"I had this image of an astronaut spinning into space away from human communication. The metaphor was already so obvious.\"\n\nFor the female lead, no fewer than ten actresses were considered to play the role before finally the choice of Sandra Bullock in October 2010. In 2010, Angelina Jolie, who had rejected a sequel to \"Wanted\" (2008), was in contact with Warner Bros. to star in the film. Scheduling conflicts involving Jolie's Bosnian war film \"In the Land of Blood and Honey\" (2011) and a possible \"Salt\" (2009) sequel led Jolie to exit her involvement with \"Gravity\", leaving Warner Bros. with doubts that the film would get made. The studio approached her for a second time to reconsider her former decision to which Jolie again declined. In mid-2010, Marion Cotillard screen tested the part but instead went on to accept a role in another sci-fi film, \"Inception\", alongside Leonardo DiCaprio and the comedy drama \"Little White Lies\". Scheduling conflicts with the TV series \"Gossip Girl\" in Manhattan and the acclaimed film \"The Town\" in Boston prevented actress Blake Lively from getting the part. For the female role, Cuarón was in search of a lead who was akin to Tom Hanks' character in \"Cast Away\" and began looking at a wide range of thespians for the role. Other stars who were considered for the role includes Naomi Watts, Carey Mulligan, Scarlett Johansson, Sienna Miller, Abbie Cornish, Rebecca Hall, and Olivia Wilde.\n\nIn March, Robert Downey Jr. entered discussions to be cast in the male lead role. In September, Cuarón received approval from Warner Bros. to offer the role without a screen test to Natalie Portman, who was praised for her performance in \"Black Swan\" (2010) at that time. Portman rejected the project because of scheduling conflicts, and Warner Bros. then approached Sandra Bullock for the role. In November 2010, Downey left the project to star in \"How to Talk to Girls\"a project in development with Shawn Levy attached to direct. The following December, with Bullock signed for the co-lead role, George Clooney replaced Downey.\n\nMade on a production budget of , \"Gravity\" was filmed digitally on multiple Arri Alexa cameras. CG elements were shot at Pinewood and Shepperton Studios in the United Kingdom. The landing scene was filmed at Lake Powell, Arizonawhere the astronauts' landing scene in \"Planet of the Apes\" (1968) was also filmed.\n\nPrincipal photography began in London in May 2011. The film contains 156 shots, with an average length of 45 secondsfewer and longer shots than in most films of its length. Although the first trailer had audible explosions and other sounds, these scenes are silent in the finished film. Cuarón said, \"They put in explosions [in the trailer]. As we know, there is no sound in space. In the film, we don't do that.\" The soundtrack in the film's space scenes consists of the musical score and sounds astronauts would hear in their suits or in the space vehicles.\n\nFor most of Bullock's shots, she was placed inside a giant, mechanical rig. Getting into the rig took a significant amount of time, so Bullock chose to stay in it for up to 10 hours a day, communicating with others through a headset. Costume Designer Jany Temime said the spacesuits were fictitious – \"no space suit opens up at the front – but we had to do that in order for her to get out. So I had to redesign it and readapt all the functions of the suit for front opening.\"\n\nCuarón said his biggest challenge was to make the set feel as inviting and non-claustrophobic as possible. The team attempted to do this by having a celebration each day when Bullock arrived. They nicknamed the rig \"Sandy's cage\" and gave it a lighted sign. Most of the film was shot digitally using Arri Alexa Classics cameras equipped with wide Arri Master Prime lenses. The final scene, which takes place on Earth, was shot on an Arri 765 camera using 65mm film to provide the sequence with a visual contrast to the rest of the film.\n\nShooting long scenes in a zero-g environment was a challenge. Eventually, the team decided to use computer-generated imagery for the spacewalk scenes and automotive robots to move Bullock's character for interior space station scenes. This meant that shots and blocking had to be planned well in advance for the robots to be programmed. It also made the production period much longer than expected. When the script was finalized, Cuarón assumed it would take about a year to complete the film, but it took four and a half years.\n\nCuarón wanted to do tracking shots, in part because the producers wanted to film it like an IMAX-style Discovery Channel documentary. Like his previous films, Emmanuel Lubezki did not use prior footage as the starting point of his work on \"Gravity\". Instead, he carried out a search of images from NASA and Roscosmos. He and his team put together a large collection of photographs and picked what was best for the film. Lubezki said that they based the visuals on descriptions from astronauts, with some artistic license in depicting how the stars looked during the daytime in space. He wanted to incorporate the stars as much as possible to feel as deep as possible and avoid plain darkness and two dimensional feeling.\n\nCuarón asked Lubezki to start the film with a brightly lit Earth. This scene was challenging for the team to shoot because the light was constantly changing from one frame to the other with the earth and ISS moving, and the sun changing its position all simultaneously. It took many months to design it and years to shoot it. When the team designed the sequence, Lubezki had in mind one of his favorite cinematographers, Vittorio Storaro, and how he utilized lighting in his films.\n\nVisual effects were supervised by Tim Webber at the London-based VFX company Framestore, which was responsible for creating most of the film's visual effectsexcept for 17 shots. Framestore was also heavily involved in the art direction and, along with The Third Floor, the previsualization. Tim Webber stated that 80 percent of the film consisted of CGIcompared to James Cameron's \"Avatar\" (2009), which was 60 percent CGI. To simulate the authenticity and reflection of unfiltered light in space, a manually controlled lighting system consisting of 1.8 million individually controlled LED lights was built. The 3D imagery was designed and supervised by Chris Parks. The majority of the 3D was created by stereo rendering the CGI at Framestore. The remaining footage was converted into 3D in post-productionprincipally at Prime Focus, London, with additional conversion work by Framestore. Prime Focus's supervisor was Richard Baker.\n\nSteven Price composed the incidental music for \"Gravity\". In early September 2013, a 23-minute preview of the soundtrack was released online. A soundtrack album was released digitally on September 17, 2013, and in physical formats on October 1, 2013, by WaterTower Music. Songs featured in the film include:\nIn most of the film's official trailers, \"Spiegel im Spiegel\", written by Estonian composer Arvo Pärt in 1978, was used.\n\n\"Gravity\" had its world premiere at the 70th Venice International Film Festival on August 28, 2013, and had its North American premiere three days later at the Telluride Film Festival. It was released in the US in 3D and IMAX 3D on October 4, 2013 and in the UK on November 8, 2013. The film's US release coincided with the beginning of World Space Week, which was observed from October 4 to 10. The film was originally scheduled to be released in the US on November 21, 2012, before being rescheduled for a 2013 release to allow the completion of extensive post-production work.\n\n\"Gravity\" emerged as one of the most successful sci-fi films of all time and the biggest box office hit of both Sandra Bullock's and George Clooney's careers. It became the highest-grossing feature film in October history, topping the animated \"Puss in Boots\", which took in $555 million globally in 2011. Bullock's previous highest-grossing film was \"Speed\" ($350.2 million) while Clooney's benchmark was \"Ocean's Eleven\" ($450.6 million).\n\nPreliminary reports predicted the film would open with takings of over $40 million in the US and Canada. The film earned $1.4 million from its Thursday night showings, and reached $17.5 million on Friday. \"Gravity\" topped the box office and broke the record held by \"Paranormal Activity 3\" (2011) as the highest-earning October and autumn openings, grossing $55.8 million from 3,575 theaters. 80 percent of the film's opening weekend gross came from its 3D showings, which grossed $44.2 million from 3,150 theaters. $11.2 million20 percent of the receiptscame from IMAX 3D showings, the highest percentage for a film opening of more than $50 million. The film stayed at number one at the box office during its second and third weekends. IMAX alone generated $34.7 million from 323 theaters, a record for IMAX opening in October.\n\n\"Gravity\" earned $27.4 million in its opening weekend overseas from 27 countries with $2.8 million from roughly 4,763 screens. Warner Bros. said the 3D showing \"exceeded all expectations\" and generated 70% of the opening grosses. In China, its second largest market, the film opened on November 19, 2013 and faced competition with \"\" which opened on November 21, 2013. At the end of the weekend \"Gravity\" emerged victorious, generating $35.76 million in six days. It opened at number one in the United Kingdom, taking over the first weekend of release, and remained there for the second week. The film's high notable openings were in Russia and the CIS ($8.1 million), Germany ($3.8 million), Australia ($3.2 million), Italy ($2.6 million) and Spain ($2.3 million). The film's largest markets outside North America were China ($71.2 million), the United Kingdom ($47 million) and France ($38.2 million). By February 17, 2014, the film had grossed $700 million worldwide. \"Gravity\" grossed $274,092,705 in North America and $449,100,000 in other countries, making a worldwide gross of $723,192,705making it the eighth-highest-grossing film of 2013. Calculating in all expenses, \"Deadline Hollywood\" estimated that the film made a profit of $209.2 million.\n\nAccording to the tracking site Excipio, \"Gravity\" was one of the most copyright-infringed films of 2014 with over 29.3 million downloads via torrent sites.\n\n\"Gravity\" received critical acclaim. Critics praised the acting, direction, cinematography, visual effects, and use of 3D. Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes records a 95% proportion of positive reviews based on 328 critics, and an average score of 9/10. The website's critical consensus states: \"Alfonso Cuarón's \"Gravity\" is an eerie, tense sci-fi thriller that's masterfully directed and visually stunning.\" On Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 based on reviews from critics, the film has a score of 96 based on 49 reviews, indicating \"universal acclaim\", making it the second-highest scoring widely released film of its year. In CinemaScore polls conducted during the opening weekend, cinema audiences gave \"Gravity\" an average grade of A- on an A+ to F scale. CinemaScore later issued an apology for the grade, saying they should have limited the poll to 3D showings instead of both 2D and 3D screenings (\"The Hollywood Reporter\" said the film was \"playing like\" an A+ film).\n\nMatt Zoller Seitz, writing on RogerEbert.com, gave the film four out of four stars, calling it \"a huge and technically dazzling film and that the film's panoramas of astronauts tumbling against starfields and floating through space station interiors are at once informative and lovely\". Justin Chang, writing for \"Variety,\" said that the film \"restores a sense of wonder, terror and possibility to the big screen that should inspire awe among critics and audiences worldwide\". Richard Corliss of \"Time\" praised Cuarón for playing \"daringly and dexterously with point-of-view: at one moment you're inside Ryan's helmet as she surveys the bleak silence, then in a subtle shift you're outside to gauge her reaction. The 3-D effects, added in post-production, provide their own extraterrestrial startle: a hailstorm of debris hurtles at you, as do a space traveler's thoughts at the realization of being truly alone in the universe.\"\n\nPeter Bradshaw of \"The Guardian\" gave the film five out of five stars, writing \"a brilliant and inspired movie-cyclorama ... a glorious imaginary creation that engulfs you utterly.\" Robbie Collin of \"The Daily Telegraph\" also awarded the film five out of five stars.\n\nPeter Travers of \"Rolling Stone\" gave the film four out of four stars, stating that the film was \"more than a movie. It's some kind of miracle.\" A. O. Scott, writing for \"The New York Times,\" highlighted the use of 3-D which he said, \"surpasses even what James Cameron accomplished in the flight sequences of \"Avatar\"\". Scott also said that the film \"in a little more than 90 minutes rewrites the rules of cinema as we have known them\". Quentin Tarantino said it was one of his top ten films of 2013. \"Empire\", \"Time\", and \"Total Film\" ranked the film as the best of 2013.\n\nSome critics have compared \"Gravity\" with other notable films set in space. Lindsey Weber of Vulture.com said the choice of Ed Harris for the voice of Mission Control is a reference to \"Apollo 13\". Todd McCarthy of \"The Hollywood Reporter\" suggests the way \"a weightless Stone goes floating about in nothing but her underwear\" references \"Alien\" (1979). Other critics made connections with \"\" (1968). James Cameron praised the film and stated, \"I think it's the best space photography ever done, I think it's the best space film ever done, and it's the movie I've been hungry to see for an awful long time\". Empire Online, Ask Men and \"The Huffington Post\" also considered \"Gravity\" to be one of the best space films ever made, though \"The Huffington Post\" later included \"Gravity\" on their list of \"8 Movies from the Last 15 Years That Are Super Overrated\".\n\n\"Gravity\" was ranked second on Metacritic's Film Critic Top Ten List scorecard for 2013: it appeared on 93 critic's lists, 22 of whom named it their best film of the year.\n\n\"Gravity\" received ten nominations at the 86th Academy Awards; together with \"American Hustle\" it received the greatest number of nominations for the 2014 ceremony, including Best Picture, Best Actress for Bullock, and Best Production Design. The film won the most of the night with seven Academy Awards: for Best Director, Best Cinematography, Best Visual Effects, Best Film Editing, Best Original Score, Best Sound Editing, and Best Sound Mixing. The film is second only to \"Cabaret\" (1972) to receive the most Academy Awards in its year without winning Best Picture, and to date is the most awarded film since 2008's \"Slumdog Millionaire\".\n\nCuarón won the Golden Globe Award for Best Director, and the film was also nominated for Best Motion Picture – Drama, Best Actress – Drama for Bullock and Best Original Score.\n\n\"Gravity\" received eleven nominations at the 67th British Academy Film Awards, more than any other film of 2013. Its nominations included Best Film, Outstanding British Film, Best Director, Best Original Screenplay, and Best Actress in a Leading Role. Cuarón was the most-nominated person at the awards; he was nominated for five awards, including his nominations as producer for Best Film awards and editor. Despite not winning Best Film, \"Gravity\" won six awards, the greatest number of awards in 2013. It won the awards for Outstanding British Film, Best Direction, Best Original Music, Best Cinematography, Best Sound, and Best Visual Effects.\n\n\"Gravity\" also won the 2014 Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation, Long Form.\n\n\"Gravity\" was released on digital download on February 11, 2014, and was released on DVD, Blu-ray and Blu-ray 3D on February 25, 2014, in the United States and on March 3, 2014, in the United Kingdom. , \"Gravity\" has sold 908,756 DVDs along with 957,355 Blu-ray discs for $16,465,600 and $22,183,843, respectively, for a total of $38,649,443. \"Gravity\" was also offered for free in HD on Google Play and Nexus devices from late October 2014 to early November 2014.\n\nA \"special edition\" Blu-ray was released on March 31, 2015. The release includes a \"Silent Space Version\" of the film which omits the score composed by Steven Price.\n\nCuarón has stated that \"Gravity\" is not always scientifically accurate and that some liberties were needed to sustain the story. \"This is not a documentary,\" Cuarón said. \"It is a piece of fiction.\" The film has been praised for the realism of its premises and its overall adherence to physical principles, despite several inaccuracies and exaggerations. According to NASA Astronaut Michael J. Massimino, who took part in Hubble Space Telescope Servicing Missions STS-109 and STS-125, \"nothing was out of place, nothing was missing. There was a one-of-a-kind wirecutter we used on one of my spacewalks and sure enough they had that wirecutter in the movie.\"\n\nAstronaut Buzz Aldrin called the visual effects \"remarkable\", and said, \"I was so extravagantly impressed by the portrayal of the reality of zero gravity. Going through the space station was done just the way that I've seen people do it in reality. The spinning is going to happen—maybe not quite that vigorous—but certainly we've been fortunate that people haven't been in those situations yet. I think it reminds us that there really are hazards in the space business, especially in activities outside the spacecraft.\" Former NASA astronaut Garrett Reisman said, \"The pace and story was definitely engaging and I think it was the best use of the 3-D IMAX medium to date. Rather than using the medium as a gimmick, \"Gravity\" uses it to depict a real environment that is completely alien to most people. But the question that most people want me to answer is, how realistic was it? The very fact that the question is being asked so earnestly is a testament to the verisimilitude of the movie. When a bad science fiction movie comes out, no one bothers to ask me if it reminded me of the real thing.\"\n\nAstrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson, astronomer and skeptic Phil Plait, and veteran NASA astronaut and spacewalker Scott E. Parazynski have offered comments about some of the most \"glaring\" inaccuracies. \"The Dissolve\" characterized these complaints as \"absurd\", problems \"only an astrophysicist would find\".\n\nExamples of differences from reality include:\n\nDespite the inaccuracies in \"Gravity\", Tyson, Plait and Parazynski said they enjoyed watching the film. Aldrin said he hoped that the film would stimulate the public to find an interest in space again, after decades of diminishing investments into advancements in the field.\n\n"}

This is a very ancient practice, and the special reverence shown towards the heart is doubtless due to its early association with the soul, affections, courage and conscience of man.\nIn medieval Europe heart-burial was fairly common. Some of the more notable cases of this include:\n\n\nA more modern example is that of Thomas Hardy whose ashes were interred in Poets' Corner of Westminster Abbey whilst his heart was buried in his beloved Wessex alongside his first wife. A recent biography of Hardy details the arguments over the decision, and addresses the long-standing rumour that the heart was stolen by a pet cat so that a pig's heart had to be used as a replacement.\n\nAnother is John Crichton-Stuart, 3rd Marquess of Bute, scholar, art patron and Catholic convert, whose heart was buried in 1900 on the Mount of Olives in Jerusalem.\n\nAnother famous heart-burial figure is music composer Frédéric Chopin. Before the funeral, pursuant to his dying wish, his heart was removed. It was preserved in alcohol (perhaps brandy) to be returned to his homeland, as he had requested. His sister smuggled it in an urn to Warsaw, where it was later sealed within a pillar of the Holy Cross Church on Krakowskie Przedmieście, beneath an epitaph sculpted by Leonard Marconi, bearing an inscription from Matthew VI:21: \"For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.\" Chopin's heart has reposed there – except for a period during World War II, when it was removed for safekeeping – within the church that was rebuilt after its virtual destruction during the 1944 Warsaw Uprising. The church stands only a short distance from Chopin's last Polish residence, the Krasiński Palace at Krakowskie Przedmieście.\n\nThe most recent notable case of heart burial was of Otto von Habsburg, former head of the House of Habsburg, whose heart was buried at the Pannonhalma Archabbey in Hungary in 2011.\n\nIn the 1994 movie \"Legends of the Fall\", the character Samuel (Henry Thomas) is killed while serving in the Canadian army in World War I. His brother (Brad Pitt) cuts the heart out of the body and sends it home to be buried on his father's ranch in Montana.\n\n\n"}

He also attended the Graduate School of Arts and Science at NYU and Harvard from 1939 to 1940. After the war he spent time studying under Léon Barzin and Pierre Monteux.\n\nSternberg's conducting debut took place on December 7, 1941 at the helm of the National Youth Administration Symphony Orchestra. Shortly thereafter he entered military service in the US Army, and at the end of the war he became conductor of the Shanghai Symphony Orchestra. After returning to the US he traveled to Austria, where in 1947 he made his debut conducting the Vienna Symphony Orchestra. He was the conductor on the first recording by the pianist Alfred Brendel of Prokofiev's \"Fifth Concerto\". Around this time Sternberg collaborated with H.C.

He won an Oscar for his performance as Captain Alfred Dreyfus in the film \"The Life of Emile Zola\" (1937), later he was nominated for a Golden Globe for his performance as Otto Frank in the film \"The Diary of Anne Frank\" (1959) and a Primetime Emmy for his performance as Rabbi Gottlieb in a 1962 episode of the television series \"Sam Benedict\".\n\nSchildkraut was born in Vienna, Austria, the son of Erna (née Weinstein) and stage (and later motion picture) actor Rudolph Schildkraut. His family was Jewish. The younger Schildkraut moved to the United States in the early 1900s. He appeared in many Broadway productions. Among the plays that he starred in was a notable production of \"Peer Gynt\".\n\nIn 1921, Schildkraut played the title role in the first American stage production of Ferenc Molnár's \"Liliom\", the play that would eventually become the basis for Rodgers and Hammerstein's \"Carousel\". He then began working in silent movies, although he did return to the stage occasionally. He had early success in film as the Chevalier de Vaudrey in D. W. Griffith's \"Orphans of the Storm\" with Lillian Gish. Later, he was featured in Cecil B. DeMille's epic 1927 film \"The King of Kings\", as Judas Iscariot. Schildraut's father Rudolf also appeared in the film. Joseph Schildkraut also played a Viennese-accented, non-singing Gaylord Ravenal in the 1929 part-talkie film version of Edna Ferber's \"Show Boat\". The character as written in the 1929 film was much closer to Ferber's original than to the depiction of him in the classic Kern and Hammerstein musical play based on the novel as well as the 1936 and 1951 film versions of the musical, but the 1929 film was not a critical or box-office success.\n\nSchildkraut received an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his role as Alfred Dreyfus in \"The Life of Emile Zola\" (1937). He gained further fame for playing the ambitious duc d'Orléans in the historical epic \"Marie Antoinette\" (1938), opposite Norma Shearer, Tyrone Power, John Barrymore and Robert Morley, and gave a notable performance as the villainous Nicolas Fouquet in \"The Man in the Iron Mask\" (1939).\n\nSchildkraut is perhaps best remembered today for playing the role of Otto Frank in both the original stage production and film version of \"The Diary of Anne Frank\" (1959). He was also an active character actor and appeared in guest roles on several early television shows, including the \"Hallmark Hall of Fame\", in which he played Claudius in the 1953 television production of \"Hamlet\", with Maurice Evans in the title role. Schildkraut also hosted and starred in \"Joseph Schildkraut Presents\", a short-lived series on the DuMont Television Network from October 1953 to January 1954.\n\nIn 1961, during the 3rd season of \"The Twilight Zone\", he made his first appearance on episode 9, \"Deaths-Head Revisited\". He later played an elderly man in \"The Trade-Ins\" in season 3, episode 31 of the same show. In 1963, he was nominated for a Best Actor Emmy Award for his performance in a guest starring role on NBC's \"Sam Benedict\" legal drama which starred Edmond O'Brien and Richard Rust.\n\nSchildkraut was married three times. His first marriage was to actress Elise Bartlett in 1923; they divorced in 1931. He married Mary McKay in 1932, until her death on February 17, 1962. In 1963, Schildkraut married Leonora Rogers, who survived him. Schildkraut died at his home in New York City of a heart attack. His father also died at the same age, also of a heart attack.\n\nFor his contributions to the motion picture industry, Schildkraut has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6780 Hollywood Boulevard. He is interred in the Hollywood Forever Cemetery.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "493517", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=493517", "title": "K-PAX", "text": "K-PAX\n\nK-PAX is an American science fiction novel by Gene Brewer, the first in the K-PAX series.\n\nThe series deals with the experiences on Earth of a man named Prot (rhymes with \"wrote\"). It is written in the first person from the point of view of Prot's psychiatrist.\n\n\"K-PAX\" was adapted into a theatrical film of the same name, released in 2001.\n\n\nIn 1990, a white male is picked up by the New York Police after being found bending over the victim of a mugging at Grand Central Terminal in midtown Manhattan. After responding to the police questions with somewhat strange answers, he is transferred to Bellevue Hospital for evaluation. Although not physically ill, he is found to harbour the strange delusion that he is from a planet called K-PAX in the constellation of Lyra. The patient, who calls himself \"prot\" (intentionally lower-case to reflect the insignificance of an individual life form in the universe), is eventually transferred to the Manhattan Psychiatric Institute (MPI), where he becomes the patient of Dr. Gene Brewer.\n\nProt (capitalized here to begin a sentence) is extremely fond of fruit, including banana skins and apple cores, which he eats during each session. He tells Brewer that he is 337 (Earth) years old, that he has visited Earth often, and that on this visit he has traveled to most of the world's countries for the past 4 years and 9 months. He exhibits a sense of humor: during their first session, he says to Brewer, \"But don't worry - I'm not going to leap out of your chest,\" an allusion to the film \"Alien\". Brewer discovers that prot is also a savant who possesses arcane information about astronomy that excites a group of astronomers who meet him. Prot states that he possesses at least rudimentary conversational knowledge of most human languages as well as the languages of animals, including whale song, and the apparent gibberish of some of the patients with schizophrenia.\n\nThough prot's dialogue is usually satirical, he turns out to be highly suggestible and easily hypnotized. Once Brewer learns this, he begins more serious therapy.\n\nBrewer, with the help of a journalist named Giselle Griffin, discovers that prot may be an alter ego (the result of Dissociative identity disorder) of Robert Porter, whose life was devastated by the murder of his wife and child and his subsequent killing of the perpetrator. Brewer speculates that the name prot is derived from Porter's surname.\n\nWhen prot \"returns\" to his own planet, Robert Porter is left in a catatonic state. However, Bess, another patient prot had promised to take with him, disappears along with a box of souvenirs prot has been collecting.\n\nProt promises to return in \"about five of your years.\"\n\nK-PAXian is the term used in the books to refer to the inhabitants of the planet K-PAX. Their language is pax-o. In the book, all knowledge of K-PAX and its attendant species comes from the individual known as prot.\n\nIn the books, prot notes that Jane Goodall, John Lennon, Henry David Thoreau, Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi and Albert Schweitzer are among the most K-PAXian (famous) humans on Earth.\n\nK-PAXians' forefathers were something like worms and lived in the ground, whereas humans' forefathers were fish and other aquatic beings.\n\nThe conditions on the planet K-PAX are used in the books to explain a number of Prot's oddities.\n\nK-PAX is seated far from the two stars it orbits: K-MON and K-RIL. Thus, K-PAXians experience an eternal dusk as K-PAX orbits in a helix around the two celestial bodies. These stars are also not like the Sun because they are not main sequence stars. From the descriptions in the novel it is assumed that they are protostars nearing their inevitable collapse. The constant phase shift of light on K-PAX and the lack of light made it necessary to evolve the ability to detect shorter wavelengths of electromagnetic radiation, i.e., ultraviolet. This explains prot's need to wear his sunglasses in all but very dim conditions. In the book, when Prot is questioned as to why a K-PAXian appears human on Earth, he responds, \"Why is a soap bubble round?\" He explains that K-PAXians appear human because the humanoid form is the most efficient shape to explore the planet. The method of reproduction of the dremers (prot's species, a term used in the book), unlike human sexual intercourse, is considered extremely unpleasant, due to intense feelings of pain and horrible smells, among other unpleasant sensations. Prot is completely uninterested in flirtation. Prot can age to a thousand years, like his parents, who are in their late six-hundreds. Prot's age contributes to his knowledge base, and on Earth, prot is considered a savant, although it is never specified whether dremer intelligence is inherent or a result of K-PAXian society. Prot makes it clear that dremers make every attempt to improve and disseminate their understanding of truth. Prot ultimately communicates that sentient beings on K-PAX have such a universal awareness of life that it would seem a majority of human endeavor is benign, but he is excited for us because our race has a bright future if only we disregard our primitive misconceptions of our surroundings.\n\nIn K-PAXian society, sex is considered unpleasant (although not by all species), veganism is preferred, speciesism has been overcome. Eating meat is never considered and there are no formal laws (e.g. police officers), governments (in other words - anarchy), schools, or religion. The anarchy on K-PAX is a non-destructive, non-violent, and peaceful one; it's a self-harmonizing, ordered anarchy. The beings reason with those beings who engage in destructive or immoral behaviour, although such instances are extremely rare. All living beings, from worm-beings to the more humanoid dremers (prot's kind), are regarded as civilized parts of the planet's community. Some readers view this as a more advanced society, or utopia, with individuals living in peace and harmony with each other, without the need for law. K-PAXians have no fixed abode and instead live a sort of nomadic life, drifting between certain settlements/villages where food, clothing, and other things are stored. K-PAXians do not have a set occupation; day-to-day tasks such as cleaning, infrastructure maintenance, and harvesting food are handled by all K-PAXians when they need to be done. Children may or may not know their parents, but this is unimportant as they are raised by their society as a whole. K-PAXians do not develop strong interpersonal bonds, but view all beings with great compassion. Despite a lack of major cities, K-PAX does feature a number of large library type structures for the dissemination of knowledge. K-PAXians are far more technologically advanced than humans. K-PAXian society seems very similar to that described by Sir Thomas More in his novel \"Utopia.\"\n\nIt seems that truth, with its absolute nature, is very desirable for prot. Readers can infer that knowledge of truth is something like a divine state of being for the K-PAXian society, considering prot's vast knowledge, scientific aptitude, and admiration for the arts. In this light, truth becomes as important to prot as it was for Mohandas Gandhi. Besides truth's revered status in K-PAXian society, the notion of \"God\" (anthropomorphic) or \"gods\" is seen as illusive and false conformity. It can thus be assumed that K-PAXian society is agnostic. K-PAXian society does not have a need for jokes or games, because life on K-PAX is considered to be fun and interesting anyway. Prot also mentions that our planet just arrived at a minor stage of planetary evolution - he thinks we are as yet children. The K-PAXians arrived at \"K\" on an alphabetic development-scale (A-K), meaning perfect stability and peace, whereas Earth is a class \"B\" planet. Class \"A\" planets used to be \"B\" planets but were destroyed by their own inhabitants.\n\nProt even says that humans do not have a good sense of humor; games and jokes are seen as obsolete on K-PAX and even as mindless by prot (to some degree). K-PAXians enjoy time with meditative walks in the woods, community needs, the arts (sculpturing, painting, music, etc.), scientific observations, conversation about ideas and information, and journeys to other planets.\n\nThe whole civilization of K-PAX despises and does not use any kind of violent or revengeful punishment or ostracism, as prot states, the mystery of life contains non-violence. K-PAXians do not domesticate each other (for example, dremers do not domesticate the ruli species, nor amps the worm beings).\n\nDespite living a fairly agrarian lifestyle, K-PAXians are highly technologically advanced. Most notable is their ability to travel faster than the speed of light both around and between planets. K-PAXians have developed computers with complete holography. These computers engage all senses and reproduce events of the history of K-PAX or other inhabited planets. K-PAXian villages contain laboratories in which the components of herbs and other plants are analyzed for medicine, resulting in cures of every existing ailment. K-PAXians do not need to synthesize these components into new products, as they have mastered chemistry to gain any needed substance directly from the plants. They do not have the need to create genetically new forms either. K-PAXians use two types of solar energy, having moved beyond their previous use of bacterial decay, gravitational energy and muscle force as energy. Prot describes Nuclear Fusion and Solar Energy as the only viable types of energy, as together they balance out each other's side effects. Prot warns Gene Brewer about the use of nuclear fission, informing him that it creates too much dangerous waste product.\n\nThe 2001 film \"K-PAX\" was directed by Iain Softley and is based on the first book in this series. Kevin Spacey portrays Prot, and Jeff Bridges plays the psychiatrist.\n\n\"K-PAX\" was made into a stage play, also written by Gene Brewer, and has been performed at the Lion and Unicorn Theatre, directed by Victor Sobchak. In 2010, the play made its North American debut at The Geneva Underground Playhouse in Geneva, Illinois directed by Eric Peter Schwartz.\n\n\"Booklist\" called the novel \"fascinating\". Psychiatrist Allan Beveridge wrote that the novel is a good example of \"why psychiatrists should read fiction\", saying that it shows \"how to approach moral quandaries and decision-making\". Science fiction scholar David Ketterer compares it with the novel \"Star-Begotten\" by H. G. Wells. Reviewer Michael Berry wrote, \"There aren't many possible denouements for a book like this, and Brewer steers a middle course between the extremes of outright fantasy and predictable mundaneness. \"K-PAX\" displays the mildly off-putting attitude found in such movies as \"Rain Man\" and \"Forrest Gump\", that we all can learn so much about ourselves from the simple-minded, but one can't deny that some of the story's episodes are genuinely funny and touching.\" Reviewer Lisa Koosis wrote that Prot \"is one of the more extraordinary characters found in current science fiction\" and that the author, \"without actually having the characters set foot on another planet, manages to bring an alien world to life\".\n\n\n"}

The then-Maharaja of Jaipur, Sawai Madho Singh II, had been born the son of a former Thakur of Isarda and had been adopted into the ruling family of Jaipur. After giving him up for adoption, Madho Singh's actual father had in turn lacked for an heir. He adopted the son of a distant kinsman and was succeeded by that lad as Thakur of Isarda. That lad was Sawai Singh, father of Mor Mukut Singh. In this manner, Mor Mukut could be reckoned near kin to Maharaja Madho Singh II of Jaipur.\n\nAfter being adopted to become Maharaja of Jaipur, Madho Singh II had numerous (no less than 65) children by various concubines, but the highly superstitious Maharaja was warned by a sage against having legitimate heirs and thus took great care not to impregnate his five wives. On 24 March 1921, Madho Singh II adopted Mor Mukut to be his son and heir. The boy was given the name \"Man Singh\" upon his adoption. Madho Singh II died on 7 September 1922 and was succeeded by Man Singh as Maharaja of Jaipur and head of the Kachwaha clan of Rajputs. The new Maharaja was ten years old.\n\nUpon obtaining his ruling powers, Man Singh embarked on a programme of modernisation, creating infrastructure and founding numerous public institutions that would later result in Jaipur being selected the capital of Rajasthan. At the time of India's Independence in 1947, the maharaja acceded Jaipur to the Dominion of India and in March 1949 he merged the princely state with the new state of Rajasthan, surrendering his sovereignty and accepting the appointment of Rajpramukh of that state until the office was abolished when the Indian states were further re-organised in 1956. Although the Indian princes had relinquished their ruling powers, they remained entitled to their titles, privy purses and other privileges until the adoption of the 26th amendment to the Constitution of India on 28 December 1971. Accordingly, Sir Man Singh II remained Maharaja of Jaipur until his death.\n\nIn 1958, Sir Man Singh was one of several rulers who realised the potential of tourism in Rajasthan, turning Rambagh Palace into a luxury hotel. Under his rule various laws of land reform were first introduced in his state, such as the Jaipur Tenancy Act. Later in 1956, the \"Jagidari\" (feudal) form of political administration were abolished during the government of the Congress Party in India. In 1962 he was elected to Council of States, the Rajya Sabha the Upper House of Indian Parliament with term till 1968, however in 1965, the Indian government appointed Sawai Man Singh, Indian Ambassador to Spain. Utilising his various contacts in Europe, he spent much of his time in Europe to ensue new military technology and arms-deal for the Indian army (Crewe).\n\nHe was especially noted as an enthusiastic (10-Goal) polo player, winning among other trophies the World Cup in 1933. During the 1950s, Man Singh owned Saint Hill Manor in East Grinstead, West Sussex, which was sold to L. Ron Hubbard, founder of Scientology in 1959.\n\nMan Singh II was married three times, and his three wives lived in the same household together, as per Indian custom. His first two marriages were to suitable brides chosen from the royal family of Jodhpur, whose Rajput heritage and social ranking were similar to his own. The senior Maharani, known within the palace as 'First her Highness,' was Marudhar Kunwar, sister of Sumer Singh, Maharaja of Jodhpur. She was about twelve years older than him and bore him two children, first a daughter, Prem Kumari and then his eldest son and heir, Bhawani Singh. His second wife was Maharani Kishore Kanwar, niece of his first wife and daughter of Maharaja Sumer Singh of Jodhpur. She was five years younger than him and bore him two sons. He was briefly involved with English socialite Lady Ursula Manners. In 1940, Man Singh II married for the third and last time. His bride was the legendary beauty, Gayatri Devi of Cooch Behar, daughter of Maharaja Jitendra Narayan of Cooch Behar and Maharani Indira Devi, a princess of Baroda. She stands out among the Maharanis of Jaipur for having become a public figure and a celebrity of sorts, initially for being a fashion-conscious beauty and later for becoming a politician and parliamentarian. She bore him one son and survived him by thirty-nine years, dying in 2009.\n\nMan Singh was the father of four sons and a daughter, bore to him by his three wives. They were:\n\n\n(one son)\n\n\nIn 1970, Man Singh had an accident while playing polo in Cirencester, England. He died later the same day. He was survived by his four sons. He was succeeded as Maharaja of Jaipur and head of the Kachwaha clan by his eldest son, Maharaja Sawai Bhawani Singh of Jaipur. Following his death Indira Gandhi was finally able to repress the power of India's former rulers in democratic India as they formed a large bulk of her opposition party, the Swatantra party.\n\nA statue of Sawai Man Singh was installed at the Ram Niwas Bagh in Jaipur, the statue was unveiled at a grand function on 30 March 2005. A Cricket Stadium in Jaipur was named after him.\n\nHis successor, Maharaja Sawai Bhawani Singh of Jaipur died on 17 April 2011, aged 79.\n\n"}

{"id": "37304", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37304", "title": "Martin Heidegger", "text": "Martin Heidegger\n\nMartin Heidegger (; ; 26 September 188926 May 1976) was a German philosopher and a seminal thinker in the Continental tradition and philosophical hermeneutics, and is \"widely acknowledged to be one of the most original and important philosophers of the 20th century.\" Heidegger is best known for his contributions to phenomenology and existentialism, though as the \"Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy\" cautions, \"his thinking should be identified as part of such philosophical movements only with extreme care and qualification\". Heidegger's membership in and public support for the Nazi Party has been the subject of widespread controversy regarding the extent to which his Nazism influenced his philosophy.\n\nHis first and best known book, \"Being and Time\" (1927), though unfinished, is one of the central philosophical works of the 20th century. In its first part, Heidegger attempted to turn away from \"ontic\" questions about beings to ontological questions about Being, and recover the most fundamental philosophical question: the question of Being, of what it means for something to be. Heidegger approached the question through an inquiry into the being that has an understanding of Being, and asks the question about it, namely, Human being, which he called \"Dasein\" (\"being-there\"). Heidegger argued that \"Dasein\" is defined by Care, its practically engaged and concernful mode of being-in-the-world, in opposition to such Rationalist thinkers as René Descartes who located the essence of man in his thinking abilities.\n\nFor Heidegger thinking is thinking \"about\" things originally discovered in our everyday practical engagements. The consequence of this is that our capacity to think cannot be the most central quality of our being because thinking is a reflecting upon this more original way of discovering the world. In the second part of his book, Heidegger argues that human being is even more fundamentally structured by its Temporality, or its concern with, and relationship to time, existing as a structurally open \"possibility-for-being\". He emphasized the importance of Authenticity in human existence, involving a truthful relationship to our thrownness into a world which we are \"always already\" concerned with, and to our being-towards-death, the Finitude of the time and being we are given, and the closing down of our various possibilities for being through time.\n\nHeidegger also made critical contributions to philosophical conceptions of truth, arguing that its original meaning was unconcealment, to philosophical analyses of art as a site of the revelation of truth, and to philosophical understanding of language as the \"house of being.\" Heidegger's later work includes criticisms of technology's instrumentalist understanding in the Western tradition as \"enframing\", treating all of Nature as a \"standing reserve\" on call for human purposes. Heidegger is a controversial figure, largely for his affiliation with Nazism, as Rector of the University of Freiburg for 11 months, before his resignation in April 1934, for which he neither apologized nor publicly expressed regret.\n\nHeidegger was born in rural Meßkirch, Baden-Württemberg, the son of Johanna (Kempf) and Friedrich Heidegger. Raised a Roman Catholic, he was the son of the sexton of the village church that adhered to the First Vatican Council of 1870, which was observed mainly by the poorer class of Meßkirch. His family could not afford to send him to university, so he entered a Jesuit seminary, though he was turned away within weeks because of the health requirement and what the director and doctor of the seminary described as a psychosomatic heart condition. Heidegger was short and sinewy, with dark piercing eyes. He enjoyed outdoor pursuits, being especially proficient at skiing.\n\nStudying theology at the University of Freiburg while supported by the church, later he switched his field of study to philosophy. Heidegger completed his doctoral thesis on psychologism in 1914, influenced by Neo-Thomism and Neo-Kantianism, directed by Arthur Schneider. In 1916, he finished his \"venia legendi\" with a habilitation thesis on Duns Scotus directed by Heinrich Rickert and influenced by Edmund Husserl's phenomenology.\n\nIn the two years following, he worked first as an unsalaried Privatdozent then served as a soldier during the final year of World War I; serving \"the last ten months of the war\" with \"the last three of those in a meteorological unit on the western front\".\n\nIn 1923, Heidegger was elected to an extraordinary Professorship in Philosophy at the University of Marburg. His colleagues there included Rudolf Bultmann, Nicolai Hartmann, and Paul Natorp. Heidegger's students at Marburg included Hans-Georg Gadamer, Hannah Arendt, Karl Löwith, Gerhard Krüger, Leo Strauss, Jacob Klein, Gunther (Stern) Anders, and Hans Jonas. Following on from Aristotle, he began to develop in his lectures the main theme of his philosophy: the question of the sense of being. He extended the concept of subject to the dimension of history and concrete existence, which he found prefigured in such Christian thinkers as Saint Paul, Augustine of Hippo, Luther, and Kierkegaard. He also read the works of Wilhelm Dilthey, Husserl, Max Scheler, and Friedrich Nietzsche.\n\nIn 1927, Heidegger published his main work \"Sein und Zeit\" (\"Being and Time\"). When Husserl retired as Professor of Philosophy in 1928, Heidegger accepted Freiburg's election to be his successor, in spite of a counter-offer by Marburg. Heidegger remained at Freiburg im Breisgau for the rest of his life, declining a number of later offers, including one from Humboldt University of Berlin. His students at Freiburg included Arendt, Günther Anders, Hans Jonas, Karl Löwith, Charles Malik, Herbert Marcuse and Ernst Nolte. Emmanuel Levinas attended his lecture courses during his stay in Freiburg in 1928.\n\nHeidegger was elected rector of the University on 21 April 1933, and joined the National Socialist German Workers' (Nazi) Party on 1 May. In his inaugural address as rector on 27 May he expressed his support of a German revolution, and in an article and a speech to the students from the same year he also supported Adolf Hitler. \n\nIn November 1933, Heidegger signed the \"Loyalty Oath of German Professors to Adolf Hitler and the National Socialist State\". He resigned the rectorate in April 1934, but remained a member of the Nazi Party until 1945 even though (as Julian Young asserts) the Nazis eventually prevented him from publishing. In the autumn of 1944, Heidegger was drafted into the \"Volkssturm\", assigned to dig anti-tank ditches along the Rhine.\n\nAccording to historian Richard J. Evans, Heidegger was not only a member of the Nazi Party, but \"enthusiastic\" about participating. He wanted to position himself as the philosopher of the Party, but the highly abstract nature of his work and the opposition of Alfred Rosenberg, who himself aspired to act in that position, limited Heidegger's role. His resignation from the rectorate owed more to his frustration as an administrator than to any principled opposition to the Nazis, according to historians.\n\nHeidegger's \"Black Notebooks\", written between 1931 and 1941 and first published in 2014, contain several expressions of anti-semitic sentiments, which have led to a re-evaluation of Heidegger's relation to Nazism.\n\nIn late 1946, as France engaged in \"épuration légale\" in its Occupation zone, the French military authorities determined that Heidegger should be blocked from teaching or participating in any university activities because of his association with the Nazi Party. The denazification procedures against Heidegger continued until March 1949 when he was finally pronounced a \"Mitläufer\" (the second lowest of five categories of \"incrimination\" by association with the Nazi regime). No punitive measures against him were proposed. This opened the way for his readmission to teaching at Freiburg University in the winter semester of 1950–51. He was granted emeritus status and then taught regularly from 1951 until 1958, and by invitation until 1967.\n\nHeidegger married Elfride Petri on 21 March 1917, in a Catholic ceremony officiated by his friend , and a week later in a Protestant ceremony in the presence of her parents. Their first son, Jörg, was born in 1919. Elfride then gave birth to in 1920. Heidegger knew that he was not Hermann's biological father but raised him as his son. Hermann's biological father, who became godfather to his son, was family friend and doctor Friedel Caesar. Hermann was told of this at the age of 14. Hermann became a historian and would later serve as the executor of Heidegger's will.\n\nHeidegger had a long romantic relationship with Hannah Arendt and a steamy affair (over many decades) with Elisabeth Blochmann, both students of his. Arendt was Jewish, and Blochmann had one Jewish parent, making them subject to severe persecution by the Nazi authorities. He helped Blochmann emigrate from Germany before the start of World War II and resumed contact with both of them after the war. Heidegger's letters to his wife contain information about several other affairs of his.\n\nHeidegger spent much time at his vacation home at Todtnauberg, on the edge of the Black Forest. He considered the seclusion provided by the forest to be the best environment in which to engage in philosophical thought.\nA few months before his death, he met with Bernhard Welte, a Catholic priest, Freiburg university professor and earlier correspondent. The exact nature of the conversation is not known, but what is known is that it included talk of Heidegger's relationship to the Catholic Church and subsequent Christian burial at which the priest officiated. Heidegger died on 26 May 1976, and was buried in the Meßkirch cemetery, beside his parents and brother.\n\nHeidegger's philosophy is founded on the attempt to conjoin what he considers two fundamental insights: the first is his observation that, in the course of over 2,000 years of history, philosophy has attended to all the beings that can be found in the world (including the world itself), but has forgotten to ask what Being itself is. Heidegger thought the presence of things for us is not their being, but merely them interpreted as equipment according to a particular system of meaning and purpose. For instance, when a hammer is efficiently used to knock in nails, we cease to be aware of it. This is termed \"ready to hand\", and Heidegger considers it an authentic mode, saying that the given (\"past\") has presence in an oversimplified way when reduced to possible future usefulness to us.\n\nHeidegger claimed philosophy and science since ancient Greece had reduced things to their presence, which was a superficial way of understanding them. One crucial source of this insight was Heidegger's reading of Franz Brentano's treatise on Aristotle's manifold uses of the word \"being\", a work which provoked Heidegger to ask what kind of unity underlies this multiplicity of uses. Heidegger opens his magnum opus, \"Being and Time\", with a citation from Plato's \"Sophist\" indicating that Western philosophy has neglected Being because it was considered too obvious to question. Heidegger's intuition about the question of Being is thus a historical argument, which in his later work becomes his concern with the \"history of Being\", that is, the history of the forgetting of Being, which according to Heidegger requires that philosophy retrace its footsteps through a productive destruction of the history of philosophy.\n\nThe second intuition animating Heidegger's philosophy derives from the influence of Edmund Husserl, a philosopher largely uninterested in questions of philosophical history. Rather, Husserl argued that all that philosophy could and should be is a description of experience (hence the phenomenological slogan, \"to the things themselves\"). But for Heidegger, this meant understanding that experience is always already situated in a world and in ways of being. Thus Husserl's understanding that all consciousness is \"intentional\" (in the sense that it is always intended \"toward\" something, and is always \"about\" something) is transformed in Heidegger's philosophy, becoming the thought that all experience is grounded in \"care\". This is the basis of Heidegger's \"existential analytic\", as he develops it in \"Being and Time\". Heidegger argues that describing experience properly entails finding the being for whom such a description might matter. Heidegger thus conducts his description of experience with reference to \"\"Dasein\", the being for whom Being is a question. In everyday German, \"Dasein\"\" means \"existence.\" It is composed of \"\"Da\" (here/there) and \"Sein\"\" (being). \"Dasein\" is transformed in Heidegger's usage from its everyday meaning to refer, rather, to that being that is \"there\" in its world, that is, the being for whom being matters. In later publications Heidegger writes the term in hyphenated form as \"Da-sein\", thus emphasizing the distance from the word's ordinary usage.\n\nIn \"Being and Time\", Heidegger criticized the abstract and metaphysical character of traditional ways of grasping human existence as rational animal, person, man, soul, spirit, or subject. \"Dasein\", then, is not intended as a way of conducting a philosophical anthropology, but is rather understood by Heidegger to be the condition of possibility for anything \"like\" a philosophical anthropology. \"Dasein\", according to Heidegger, \"is\" care. In the course of his existential analytic, Heidegger argues that \"Dasein\", who finds itself thrown into the world (\"Geworfenheit\") amidst things and with others, is thrown into its possibilities, including the possibility and inevitability of one's own mortality. The need for \"Dasein\" to assume these possibilities, that is, the need to be responsible for one's own existence, is the basis of Heidegger's notions of authenticity and resoluteness—that is, of those specific possibilities for \"Dasein\" which depend on escaping the \"vulgar\" temporality of calculation and of public life.\n\nThe marriage of these two observations depends on the fact that each of them is essentially concerned with time. That \"Dasein\" is thrown into an already existing world and thus into its mortal possibilities does not only mean that \"Dasein\" is an essentially temporal being; it also implies that the description of \"Dasein\" can only be carried out in terms inherited from the Western tradition itself. For Heidegger, unlike for Husserl, philosophical terminology could not be divorced from the history of the use of that terminology, and thus genuine philosophy could not avoid confronting questions of language and meaning. The existential analytic of \"Being and Time\" was thus always only a first step in Heidegger's philosophy, to be followed by the \"dismantling\" (\"Destruktion\") of the history of philosophy, that is, a transformation of its language and meaning, that would have made of the existential analytic only a kind of \"limit case\" (in the sense in which special relativity is a limit case of general relativity).\n\nThat Heidegger did not write this second part of \"Being and Time\", and that the existential analytic was left behind in the course of Heidegger's subsequent writings on the history of being, might be interpreted as a failure to conjugate his account of \"individual\" experience with his account of the vicissitudes of the \"collective\" human adventure that he understands the Western philosophical tradition to be. And this would in turn raise the question of whether this failure is due to a flaw in Heidegger's account of temporality, that is, of whether Heidegger was correct to oppose vulgar and authentic time. There are also recent critiques in this regard that were directed at Heidegger's focus on time instead of primarily thinking about being in relation to place and space, and to the notion of dwelling, with connections too to architectural theory as impacted by phenomenology.\n\n\"Being and Time\" (German title: \"Sein und Zeit\"), published in 1927, was Heidegger's first academic book. He had been under pressure to publish in order to qualify for Husserl's (to whom he dedicated the work) chair at the University of Freiburg and the success of this work ensured his appointment to the post.\n\nIn \"Being and Time\", Heidegger investigates the question of Being by asking about the being for whom Being is a question. Heidegger names this being \"Dasein\" (see above), and he pursues his investigation through themes such as mortality, care, anxiety, temporality, and historicity. It was Heidegger's original intention to write a second half of the book, consisting of a \"Destruktion\" of the history of philosophy—that is, the transformation of philosophy by re-tracing its history—but he never completed this project.\n\n\"Being and Time\" influenced many thinkers, including such existentialist thinkers as Jean-Paul Sartre (although Heidegger distanced himself from existentialism—see below).\n\nHeidegger's later works, beginning by 1930 and largely established by the early 1940s, seem to many commentators (e.g. William J. Richardson) to at least reflect a shift of focus, if not indeed a major change in his philosophical outlook, which is known as \"the turn\" (\"die Kehre\"). One way this has been understood is as a shift from \"doing\" to \"dwelling\" (\"Wohnen\") and from \"Being and Time\" to \"Time and Being\" (This aspect had a particular influence on architectural theorists in their focus on place and space in thinking about dwelling. Such is the case with the work of Christian Norberg-Schulz and the philosopher-architect Nader El-Bizri.) However, others feel that this is to overstate the difference. For example, in 2011 Mark Wrathall argued that Heidegger pursued and refined the central notion of unconcealment throughout his life as a philosopher. Its importance and continuity in his thinking, Wrathall states, shows that he did not have a \"turn\". A reviewer of Wrathall's book stated: \"An ontology of unconcealment [...] means a description and analysis of the broad contexts in which entities show up as meaningful to us, as well as the conditions under which such contexts, or worlds, emerge and fade.\"\n\nHeidegger focuses less on the way in which the structures of being are revealed in everyday behavior, and more on the way in which behaviour itself depends on a prior \"openness to being.\" The essence of being human is the maintenance of this openness. Heidegger contrasts this openness to the \"will to power\" of the modern human subject, which is one way of forgetting this originary openness.\n\nHeidegger understands the commencement of the history of Western philosophy as a brief period of authentic openness to being, during the time of the pre-Socratics, especially Anaximander, Heraclitus, and Parmenides. This was followed, according to Heidegger, by a long period increasingly dominated by the forgetting of this initial openness, a period which commences with Plato, and which occurs in different ways throughout Western history.\n\nTwo recurring themes of Heidegger's later writings are poetry and technology. Heidegger sees poetry and technology as two contrasting ways of \"revealing.\" Poetry reveals being in the way in which, if it is genuine poetry, it commences something new. Technology, on the other hand, when it gets going, inaugurates the world of the dichotomous subject and object, which modern philosophy commencing with Descartes also reveals. But with \"modern\" technology a new stage of revealing is reached, in which the subject-object distinction is overcome even in the \"material\" world of technology. The essence of modern technology is the conversion of the whole universe of beings into an undifferentiated \"standing reserve\" (\"Bestand\") of energy available for any use to which humans choose to put it. Heidegger described the essence of modern technology as \"Gestell\", or \"enframing.\" Heidegger does not unequivocally condemn technology: while he acknowledges that modern technology contains grave dangers, Heidegger nevertheless also argues that it may constitute a chance for human beings to enter a new epoch in their relation to being. Despite this, some commentators have insisted that an agrarian nostalgia permeates his later work.\n\nIn a 1950 lecture he formulated the famous saying \"Language speaks\", later published in the 1959 essays collection \"Unterwegs zur Sprache\", and collected in the 1971 English book \"Poetry, Language, Thought\".\n\nHeidegger's later works include \"Vom Wesen der Wahrheit\" (\"On the Essence of Truth\", 1930), \"Der Ursprung des Kunstwerkes\" (\"The Origin of the Work of Art\", 1935), \"Einführung in die Metaphysik\" (\"Introduction to Metaphysics\", 1935), \"Bauen Wohnen Denken\" (\"Building Dwelling Thinking\", 1951), and \"Die Frage nach der Technik\" (\"The Question Concerning Technology\", 1954) and \"Was heisst Denken?\" (\"What Is Called Thinking?\" 1954). Also \"Beiträge zur Philosophie (Vom Ereignis)\" (\"Contributions to Philosophy (From Enowning)\"), composed in the years 1936–38 but not published until 1989, on the centennial of Heidegger's birth.\n\nHeidegger believed the Western world to be on a trajectory headed for total war, and on the brink of profound nihilism (the rejection of all religious and moral principles), which would be the purest and highest revelation of Being itself, offering a horrifying crossroads of either salvation or the end of metaphysics and modernity; rendering the West a wasteland populated by tool-using brutes, characterized by an unprecedented ignorance and barbarism in which everything is permitted.\n\nHe thought the latter possibility would degenerate mankind generally into scientists, workers and brutes; living under the last mantle of one of three ideologies, Americanism, Marxism or Nazism (which he deemed metaphysically identical, as avatars of subjectivity and institutionalized nihilism), and an unfettered totalitarian world technology.\nSupposedly, this epoch would be ironically celebrated, as the most enlightened and glorious in human history.\n\nHe envisaged this abyss to be the greatest event in the West's history because it would enable Humanity to comprehend Being more profoundly and primordially than the Pre-Socratics.\n\nRecent scholarship has shown that Heidegger was substantially influenced by St. Augustine of Hippo and that \"Being and Time\" would not have been possible without the influence of Augustine's thought. Augustine's \"Confessions\" was particularly influential in shaping Heidegger's thought.\n\nAugustine viewed time as relative and subjective, and that being and time were bound up together. Heidegger adopted similar views, e.g. that time was the horizon of Being: ' ...time temporalizes itself only as long as there are human beings.'\n\nHeidegger was influenced at an early age by Aristotle, mediated through Catholic theology, medieval philosophy and Franz Brentano. Aristotle's ethical, logical, and metaphysical works were crucial to the development of his thought in the crucial period of the 1920s. Although he later worked less on Aristotle, Heidegger recommended postponing reading Nietzsche, and to \"first study Aristotle for ten to fifteen years\". In reading Aristotle, Heidegger increasingly contested the traditional Latin translation and scholastic interpretation of his thought. Particularly important (not least for its influence upon others, both in their interpretation of Aristotle and in rehabilitating a neo-Aristotelian \"practical philosophy\") was his radical reinterpretation of Book Six of Aristotle's \"Nicomachean Ethics\" and several books of the \"Metaphysics\". Both informed the argument of \"Being and Time\". Heidegger's thought is original in being an authentic retrieval of the past, a repetition of the possibilities handed down by the tradition.\n\nThe idea of asking about being may be traced back via Aristotle to Parmenides. Heidegger claimed to have revived the question of being, the question having been largely forgotten by the metaphysical tradition extending from Plato to Descartes, a forgetfulness extending to the Age of Enlightenment and then to modern science and technology. In pursuit of the retrieval of this question, Heidegger spent considerable time reflecting on ancient Greek thought, in particular on Plato, Parmenides, Heraclitus, and Anaximander, as well as on the tragic playwright Sophocles.\n\nHeidegger's very early project of developing a \"hermeneutics of factical life\" and his hermeneutical transformation of phenomenology was influenced in part by his reading of the works of Wilhelm Dilthey.\n\nOf the influence of Dilthey, Hans-Georg Gadamer writes the following: \"As far as Dilthey is concerned, we all know today what I have known for a long time: namely that it is a mistake to conclude on the basis of the citation in \"Being and Time\" that Dilthey was especially influential in the development of Heidegger's thinking in the mid-1920s. This dating of the influence is much too late.\" He adds that by the fall of 1923 it was plain that Heidegger felt \"the clear superiority of Count Yorck over the famous scholar, Dilthey.\" Gadamer nevertheless makes clear that Dilthey's influence was important in helping the youthful Heidegger \"in distancing himself from the systematic ideal of Neo-Kantianism, as Heidegger acknowledges in \"Being and Time\".\" Based on Heidegger's earliest lecture courses, in which Heidegger already engages Dilthey's thought prior to the period Gadamer mentions as \"too late\", scholars as diverse as Theodore Kisiel and David Farrell Krell have argued for the importance of Diltheyan concepts and strategies in the formation of Heidegger's thought.\n\nEven though Gadamer's interpretation of Heidegger has been questioned, there is little doubt that Heidegger seized upon Dilthey's concept of hermeneutics. Heidegger's novel ideas about ontology required a \"gestalt\" formation, not merely a series of logical arguments, in order to demonstrate his fundamentally new paradigm of thinking, and the hermeneutic circle offered a new and powerful tool for the articulation and realization of these ideas.\n\nThere is disagreement over the degree of influence that Husserl had on Heidegger's philosophical development, just as there is disagreement about the degree to which Heidegger's philosophy is grounded in phenomenology. These disagreements centre upon how much of Husserlian phenomenology is contested by Heidegger, and how much this phenomenology in fact informs Heidegger's own understanding.\n\nOn the relation between the two figures, Gadamer wrote: \"When asked about phenomenology, Husserl was quite right to answer as he used to in the period directly after World War I: 'Phenomenology, that is me and Heidegger'.\" Nevertheless, Gadamer noted that Heidegger was no patient collaborator with Husserl, and that Heidegger's \"rash ascent to the top, the incomparable fascination he aroused, and his stormy temperament surely must have made Husserl, the patient one, as suspicious of Heidegger as he always had been of Max Scheler's volcanic fire.\"\n\nRobert J. Dostal understood the importance of Husserl to be profound:\nHeidegger himself, who is supposed to have broken with Husserl, bases his hermeneutics on an account of time that not only parallels Husserl's account in many ways but seems to have been arrived at through the same phenomenological method as was used by Husserl... The differences between Husserl and Heidegger are significant, but if we do not see how much it is the case that Husserlian phenomenology provides the framework for Heidegger's approach, we will not be able to appreciate the exact nature of Heidegger's project in \"Being and Time\" or why he left it unfinished.\n\nDaniel O. Dahlstrom saw Heidegger's presentation of his work as a departure from Husserl as unfairly misrepresenting Husserl's own work. Dahlstrom concluded his consideration of the relation between Heidegger and Husserl as follows:\n\nHeidegger's silence about the stark similarities between his account of temporality and Husserl's investigation of internal time-consciousness contributes to a \"misrepresentation\" of Husserl's account of intentionality. Contrary to the criticisms Heidegger advances in his lectures, intentionality (and, by implication, the meaning of 'to be') in the final analysis is not construed by Husserl as sheer presence (be it the presence of a fact or object, act or event). Yet for all its \"dangerous closeness\" to what Heidegger understands by temporality, Husserl's account of internal time-consciousness does differ fundamentally. In Husserl's account the structure of protentions is accorded neither the finitude nor the primacy that Heidegger claims are central to the original future of ecstatic-horizonal temporality.\n\nHeideggerians regarded Søren Kierkegaard as, by far, the greatest philosophical contributor to Heidegger's own existentialist concepts. Heidegger's concepts of anxiety (\"Angst\") and mortality draw on Kierkegaard and are indebted to the way in which the latter lays out the importance of our subjective relation to truth, our existence in the face of death, the temporality of existence, and the importance of passionate affirmation of one's individual being-in-the-world.\n\nFriedrich Hölderlin and Friedrich Nietzsche were both important influences on Heidegger, and many of his lecture courses were devoted to one or the other, especially in the 1930s and 1940s. The lectures on Nietzsche focused on fragments posthumously published under the title \"The Will to Power\", rather than on Nietzsche's published works. Heidegger read \"The Will to Power\" as the culminating expression of Western metaphysics, and the lectures are a kind of dialogue between the two thinkers.\n\nThe fundamental differences between the philosophical delineations of Heidegger and Adorno can be found in their contrasting views of Hölderlin's poetical works and to a lesser extent in their divergent views on German romanticism in general. For Heidegger, Hölderlin expressed the intuitive necessity of metaphysical concepts as a guide for ethical paradigms, devoid of reflection. Adorno, on the other hand, pointed to the dialectic reflection of historical situations, the sociological interpretations of future outcomes, and therefore opposed the liberating principles of intuitive concepts because they negatively surpassed the perception of societal realities. Nevertheless, it was Heidegger's rationalization and later work on Hölderlin's poems as well as on Parmenides (\"For to be aware and to be are the same,\" DK B 3) and his consistent understanding of Nietzsche's thought that formed the foundation of postmodern existentialism.\n\nThis is also the case for the lecture courses devoted to the poetry of Friedrich Hölderlin, which became an increasingly central focus of Heidegger's work and thought. Heidegger grants to Hölderlin a singular place within the history of being and the history of Germany, as a herald whose thought is yet to be \"heard\" in Germany or the West. Many of Heidegger's works from the 1930s onwards include meditations on lines from Hölderlin's poetry, and several of the lecture courses are devoted to the reading of a single poem (see, for example, \"Hölderlin's Hymn \"The Ister\"\").\n\nSome writers on Heidegger's work see possibilities within it for dialogue with traditions of thought outside of Western philosophy, particularly East Asian thinking. Despite perceived differences between Eastern and Western philosophy, some of Heidegger's later work, particularly \"A Dialogue on Language between a Japanese and an Inquirer\", does show an interest in initiating such a dialogue. Heidegger himself had contact with a number of leading Japanese intellectuals, including members of the Kyoto School, notably Hajime Tanabe and Kuki Shūzō. It has also been claimed that a number of elements within Heidegger's thought bear a close parallel to Eastern philosophical ideas, particularly Zen Buddhism and Taoism. Reinhard May refers to Chang Chung-Yuan who stated \"Heidegger is the only Western Philosopher who not only intellectually understands Tao, but has intuitively experienced the essence of it as well.\" May sees great influence of Taoism and Japanese scholars in Heidegger's work, although this influence is not acknowledged by the author. He asserts: \"The investigation concludes that Heidegger’s work was significantly influenced by East Asian sources. It can be shown, moreover, that in particular instances Heidegger even appropriated wholesale and almost verbatim major ideas from the German translations of Daoist and Zen Buddhist classics. This clandestine textual appropriation of non-Western spirituality, the extent of which has gone undiscovered for so long, seems quite unparalleled, with far-reaching implications for our future interpretation of Heidegger’s work.\"\n\nHeidegger has been influential in research on the relationship between Western philosophy and the history of ideas in Islam, particularly for some scholars interested in Arabic philosophical medieval sources. These include the Lebanese philosopher and architectural theorist Nader El-Bizri, who, as well as focusing on the critique of the history of metaphysics (as an 'Arab Heideggerian'), also moves towards rethinking the notion of \"dwelling\" in the epoch of the modern unfolding of the essence of technology and \"Gestell\", and realizing what can be described as a \"confluence of Western and Eastern thought\" as well. El-Bizri has also taken a new direction in his engagement in 'Heidegger Studies' by way of probing the Arab/Levantine Anglophone reception of \"Sein und Zeit\" in 1937 as set in the Harvard doctoral thesis of the 20th century Lebanese/Arab thinker and diplomat Charles Malik.\n\nIt is also claimed that the works of counter-enlightenment philosophers such as Heidegger, along with Friedrich Nietzsche and Joseph de Maistre, influenced Iran's Shia Islamist scholars, notably Ali Shariati. A clearer impact of Heidegger in Iran is associated with thinkers such as Ahmad Fardid and Reza Davari Ardakani who have been closely associated with the unfolding of philosophical thinking in a Muslim modern theological legacy in Iran. This included the construction of the ideological foundations of the Iranian Revolution and modern political Islam in its connections with theology.\n\nHeidegger's thought influenced some architectural theorists in a direct manner, or through an impact via his reflections on 'dwelling', the 'origin of the work of art', 'the essence of technology', and the unfolding of a broad interest in phenomenology within the contemporary circles of architectural theory. This is for instance evident in the works and profiles of theorists such as Christian Norberg-Schulz, Dalibor Vesely, Nader El-Bizri, Karsten Harries, Neil Leach, Adam Sharr, etc., within what is known as Architectural phenomenology and in contemporary architectural theory in general.\n\nAdolf Hitler was sworn in as Chancellor of Germany on January 30, 1933. Heidegger was elected rector of the University of Freiburg on April 21, 1933, and assumed the position the following day. On May 1, he joined the Nazi Party.\n\nHeidegger delivered his inaugural address, the \"Rektoratsrede\", on \"Die Selbstbehauptung der Deutschen Universität\" (\"The Self-assertion of the German University\") on 27 May.\n\nHis tenure as rector was fraught with difficulties from the outset. Some National Socialist education officials viewed him as a rival, while others saw his efforts as comical. Some of Heidegger's fellow National Socialists also ridiculed his philosophical writings as gibberish. He finally offered his resignation on 23 April 1934, and it was accepted on 27 April. Heidegger remained a member of both the academic faculty and of the Nazi Party until the end of the war.\n\nPhilosophical historian Hans Sluga wrote:\n\nThough as rector he prevented students from displaying an anti-Semitic poster at the entrance to the university and from holding a book burning, he kept in close contact with the Nazi student leaders and clearly signaled to them his sympathy with their activism.\n\nIn 1945, Heidegger wrote of his term as rector, giving the writing to his son Hermann; it was published in 1983:\n\nThe rectorate was an attempt to see something in the movement that had come to power, beyond all its failings and crudeness, that was much more far-reaching and that could perhaps one day bring a concentration on the Germans' Western historical essence. It will in no way be denied that at the time I believed in such possibilities and for that reason renounced the actual vocation of thinking in favor of being effective in an official capacity. In no way will what was caused by my own inadequacy in office be played down. But these points of view do not capture what is essential and what moved me to accept the rectorate.\n\nBeginning in 1917, German-Jewish philosopher Edmund Husserl championed Heidegger's work, and helped him secure the retiring Husserl's chair in Philosophy at the University of Freiburg.\n\nOn 6 April 1933, the Reichskommissar of Baden Province, Robert Wagner, suspended all Jewish government employees, including present and retired faculty at the University of Freiburg. Heidegger's predecessor as Rector formally notified Husserl of his \"enforced leave of absence\" on 14 April 1933.\n\nHeidegger became Rector of the University of Freiburg on 22 April 1933. The following week the national Reich law of 28 April 1933, replaced Reichskommissar Wagner's decree. The Reich law required the firing of Jewish professors from German universities, including those, such as Husserl, who had converted to Christianity. The termination of the retired professor Husserl's academic privileges thus did not involve any specific action on Heidegger's part.\n\nHeidegger had by then broken off contact with Husserl, other than through intermediaries. Heidegger later claimed that his relationship with Husserl had already become strained after Husserl publicly \"settled accounts\" with Heidegger and Max Scheler in the early 1930s.\n\nHeidegger did not attend his former mentor's cremation in 1938. In 1941, under pressure from publisher Max Niemeyer, Heidegger agreed to remove the dedication to Husserl from \"Being and Time\" (restored in post-war editions).\n\nHeidegger's behavior towards Husserl has evoked controversy. Arendt initially suggested that Heidegger's behavior precipitated Husserl's death. She called Heidegger a \"potential murderer.\" However, she later recanted her accusation.\n\nIn 1939, only a year after Husserl's death, Heidegger wrote in his \"Black Notebooks\": \"The more original and inceptive the coming decisions and questions become, the more inaccessible will they remain to this [Jewish] 'race'. (Thus, Husserl’s step toward phenomenological observation, and his rejection of psychological explanations and historiological reckoning of opinions, are of enduring importance—yet it never reaches into the domains of essential decisions\", seeming to imply that Husserl's philosophy was limited purely because he was Jewish.\n\nAfter the failure of Heidegger's rectorship, he withdrew from most political activity, without canceling his membership in the NSDAP (Nazi Party). References to National Socialism continued to appear in his work.\n\nThe most controversial such reference occurred during a 1935 lecture which was published in 1953 as part of the book \"Introduction to Metaphysics\". In the published version, Heidegger refers to the \"inner truth and greatness\" of the National Socialist movement (\"die innere Wahrheit und Größe dieser Bewegung\"), but he then adds a qualifying statement in parentheses: \"namely, the confrontation of planetary technology and modern humanity\" (\"nämlich die Begegnung der planetarisch bestimmten Technik und des neuzeitlichen Menschen\"). However, it subsequently transpired that this qualification had not been made during the original lecture, although Heidegger claimed that it had been. This has led scholars to argue that Heidegger still supported the Nazi party in 1935 but that he did not want to admit this after the war, and so he attempted to silently correct his earlier statement.\n\nIn private notes written in 1939, Heidegger took a strongly critical view of Hitler's ideology; however, in public lectures, he seems to have continued to make ambiguous comments which, if they expressed criticism of the regime, did so only in the context of praising its ideals. For instance, in a 1942 lecture, published posthumously, Heidegger said of recent German classics scholarship:\n\nIn the majority of \"research results,\" the Greeks appear as pure National Socialists. This overenthusiasm on the part of academics seems not even to notice that with such \"results\" it does National Socialism and its historical uniqueness no service at all, not that it needs this anyhow.\n\nAn important witness to Heidegger's continued allegiance to National Socialism during the post-rectorship period is his former student Karl Löwith, who met Heidegger in 1936 while Heidegger was visiting Rome. In an account set down in 1940 (though not intended for publication), Löwith recalled that Heidegger wore a swastika pin to their meeting, though Heidegger knew that Löwith was Jewish. Löwith also recalled that Heidegger \"left no doubt about his faith in Hitler\", and stated that his support for National Socialism was in agreement with the essence of his philosophy.\n\nAfter the end of World War II, Heidegger was summoned to appear at a denazification hearing. Heidegger's former lover Arendt spoke on his behalf at this hearing, while Jaspers spoke against him. He was charged on four counts, dismissed from the university and declared a \"follower\" (\"Mitläufer\") of Nazism. Heidegger was forbidden to teach between 1945 and 1951. One consequence of this teaching ban was that Heidegger began to engage far more in the French philosophical scene.\n\nIn his postwar thinking, Heidegger distanced himself from Nazism, but his critical comments about Nazism seem \"scandalous\" to some since they tend to equate the Nazi war atrocities with other inhumane practices related to rationalisation and industrialisation, including the treatment of animals by factory farming. For instance in a lecture delivered at Bremen in 1949, Heidegger said: \"Agriculture is now a motorized food industry, the same thing in its essence as the production of corpses in the gas chambers and the extermination camps, the same thing as blockades and the reduction of countries to famine, the same thing as the manufacture of hydrogen bombs.\"\n\nIn 1967 Heidegger met with the Jewish poet Paul Celan, a concentration camp survivor. Celan visited Heidegger at his country retreat and wrote an enigmatic poem about the meeting, which some interpret as Celan's wish for Heidegger to apologize for his behavior during the Nazi era.\n\nOn 23 September 1966, Heidegger was interviewed by Rudolf Augstein and Georg Wolff for \"Der Spiegel\" magazine, in which he agreed to discuss his political past provided that the interview be published posthumously. (It was published five days after his death, on 31 May 1976.) In the interview, Heidegger defended his entanglement with National Socialism in two ways: first, he argued that there was no alternative, saying that he was trying to save the university (and science in general) from being politicized and thus had to compromise with the Nazi administration. Second, he admitted that he saw an \"awakening\" (\"Aufbruch\") which might help to find a \"new national and social approach,\" but said that he changed his mind about this in 1934, largely prompted by the violence of the Night of the Long Knives.\n\nIn his interview Heidegger defended as double-speak his 1935 lecture describing the \"inner truth and greatness of this movement.\" He affirmed that Nazi informants who observed his lectures would understand that by \"movement\" he meant National Socialism. However, Heidegger asserted that his dedicated students would know this statement was no eulogy for the NSDAP. Rather, he meant it as he expressed it in the parenthetical clarification later added to \"Introduction to Metaphysics\" (1953), namely, \"the confrontation of planetary technology and modern humanity.\"\n\nThe Löwith account from 1936 has been cited to contradict the account given in the \"Der Spiegel\" interview in two ways: that he did not make any decisive break with National Socialism in 1934, and that Heidegger was willing to entertain more profound relations between his philosophy and political involvement. The \"Der Spiegel\" interviewers did not bring up Heidegger's 1949 quotation comparing the industrialization of agriculture to the extermination camps. In fact, the interviewers were not in possession of much of the evidence now known for Heidegger's Nazi sympathies. \"Der Spiegel\" journalist Georg Wolff had been an SS-Hauptsturmführer with the Sicherheitsdienst, stationed in Oslo during World War II, and had been writing articles with antisemitic and racist overtones in \"Der Spiegel\" since war’s end.\n\nHeidegger was one of the most influential philosophers of the 20th century, and his ideas have penetrated into many areas, but in France there is a very long and particular history of reading and interpreting his work which in itself resulted in deepening the impact of his thought in Continental Philosophy. He influenced Jean Beaufret, , Dominique Janicaud, Jean-Luc Marion, and others.\n\nHeidegger's influence on French philosophy began in the 1930s, when \"Being and Time\", \"What is Metaphysics?\" and other Heideggerian texts were read by Jean-Paul Sartre and other existentialists, as well as by thinkers such as Alexandre Kojève, Georges Bataille and Emmanuel Levinas. Because Heidegger's discussion of ontology (the study of being) is rooted in an analysis of the mode of existence of individual human beings (\"Da-sein\", or there-being), his work has often been associated with existentialism. The influence of Heidegger on Sartre's \"Being and Nothingness\" is marked, but Heidegger felt that Sartre had misread his work, as he argued in later texts such as the \"Letter on Humanism\" In that text, intended for a French audience, Heidegger explained this misreading in the following terms:\n\nSartre's key proposition about the priority of \"existentia\" over \"essentia\" [that is, Sartre's statement that \"existence precedes essence\"] does, however, justify using the name \"existentialism\" as an appropriate title for a philosophy of this sort. But the basic tenet of \"existentialism\" has nothing at all in common with the statement from \"Being and Time\" [that \"the 'essence' of Dasein lies in its existence\"]—apart from the fact that in \"Being and Time\" no statement about the relation of \"essentia\" and \"existentia\" can yet be expressed, since there it is still a question of preparing something precursory.\n\n\"Letter on 'Humanism'\" is often seen as a direct response to Sartre's 1945 lecture \"Existentialism Is a Humanism\". Aside from merely disputing readings of his own work, however, in the \"Letter on Humanism\" Heidegger asserts that \"Every humanism is either grounded in a metaphysics or is itself made to be the ground of one.\" Heidegger's largest issue with Sartre's existential humanism is that, while it does make a humanistic 'move' in privileging existence over essence, \"the reversal of a metaphysical statement remains a metaphysical statement.\" From this point onward in his thought, Heidegger attempted to think beyond metaphysics to a place where the articulation of the fundamental questions of ontology were fundamentally possible: only from this point can we restore (that is, re-give [redonner]) any possible meaning to the word \"humanism\".\n\nAfter the war, Heidegger was banned from university teaching for a period on account of his activities as Rector of Freiburg University. He developed a number of contacts in France, where his work continued to be taught, and a number of French students visited him at Todtnauberg (see, for example, Jean-François Lyotard's brief account in \"Heidegger and \"the Jews\"\", which discusses a Franco-German conference held in Freiburg in 1947, one step toward bringing together French and German students). Heidegger subsequently made several visits to France, and made efforts to keep abreast of developments in French philosophy by way of correspondence with Jean Beaufret, an early French translator of Heidegger, and with Lucien Braun.\n\nDeconstruction came to Heidegger's attention in 1967 by way of Lucien Braun's recommendation of Jacques Derrida's work (Hans-Georg Gadamer was present at an initial discussion and indicated to Heidegger that Derrida's work came to his attention by way of an assistant). Heidegger expressed interest in meeting Derrida personally after the latter sent him some of his work. There was discussion of a meeting in 1972, but this failed to take place. Heidegger's interest in Derrida is said by Braun to have been considerable (as is evident in two letters, of September 29, 1967 and May 16, 1972, from Heidegger to Braun). Braun also brought to Heidegger's attention the work of Michel Foucault. Foucault's relation to Heidegger is a matter of considerable difficulty; Foucault acknowledged Heidegger as a philosopher whom he read but never wrote about. (For more on this see \"Penser à Strasbourg,\" Jacques Derrida, et al., which includes reproductions of both letters and an account by Braun, \"À mi-chemin entre Heidegger et Derrida\").\n\nDerrida attempted to displace the understanding of Heidegger's work that had been prevalent in France from the period of the ban against Heidegger teaching in German universities, which amounted to an almost wholesale rejection of the influence of Jean-Paul Sartre and existentialist terms. In Derrida's view, deconstruction is a tradition inherited via Heidegger (the French term \"déconstruction\" is a term coined to translate Heidegger's use of the words \"Destruktion\"—literally \"destruction\"—and \"Abbau\"—more literally \"de-building\"). According to Derrida, Sartre's interpretation of Dasein and other key Heideggerian concerns is overly psychologistic, anthropocentric, and misses the historicality central to \"Dasein\" in \"Being and Time\".\n\nJacques Derrida, Philippe Lacoue-Labarthe, and Jean-François Lyotard, among others, all engaged in debate and disagreement about the relation between Heidegger's philosophy and his Nazi politics. These debates included the question of whether it was possible to do without Heidegger's philosophy, a position which Derrida in particular rejected. Forums where these debates took place include the proceedings of the first conference dedicated to Derrida's work, published as \"Les Fins de l'homme à partir du travail de Jacques Derrida: colloque de Cerisy, 23 juillet-2 août 1980\", Derrida's \"Feu la cendre/cio' che resta del fuoco\", and the studies on Paul Celan by Lacoue-Labarthe and Derrida which shortly preceded the detailed studies of Heidegger's politics published in and after 1987.\n\nWhen in 1987 Víctor Farías published his book \"Heidegger et le nazisme\", this debate was taken up by many others, some of whom were inclined to disparage so-called \"deconstructionists\" for their association with Heidegger's philosophy. Derrida and others not only continued to defend the importance of reading Heidegger, but attacked Farías on the grounds of poor scholarship and for what they saw as the sensationalism of his approach. Not all scholars agreed with this negative assessment: Richard Rorty, for example, declared that \"[Farías'] book includes more concrete information relevant to Heidegger's relations with the Nazis than anything else available, and it is an excellent antidote to the evasive apologetics that are still being published.\"\n\nMore recently, Heidegger's thought has considerably influenced the work of the French philosopher Bernard Stiegler. This is evident even from the title of Stiegler's multi-volume \"magnum opus\", \"La technique et le temps\" (volume one translated into English as \"Technics and Time, 1: The Fault of Epimetheus\"). Stiegler offers an original reading of Heidegger, arguing that there can be no access to \"originary temporality\" other than via material, that is, technical, supports, and that Heidegger recognised this in the form of his account of world historicality, yet in the end suppressed that fact. Stiegler understands the existential analytic of \"Being and Time\" as an account of psychic individuation, and his later \"history of being\" as an account of collective individuation. He understands many of the problems of Heidegger's philosophy and politics as the consequence of Heidegger's inability to integrate the two.\n\nHeidegger has been very influential on the work of Italian philosopher Giorgio Agamben. Agamben attended seminars in France led by Heidegger in the late 1960s.\n\nHeidegger's influence upon 20th century continental philosophy is unquestioned and has produced a variety of critical responses.\n\nAccording to Husserl, \"Being and Time\" claimed to deal with ontology but only did so in the first few pages of the book. Having nothing further to contribute to an ontology independent of human existence, Heidegger changed the topic to \"Dasein\". Whereas Heidegger argued that the question of human existence is central to the pursuit of the question of being, Husserl criticized this as reducing phenomenology to \"philosophical anthropology\" and offering an abstract and incorrect portrait of the human being.\n\nThe Neo-Kantian Ernst Cassirer and Heidegger engaged in an influential debate located in Davos in 1929, concerning the significance of Kantian notions of freedom and rationality (see Cassirer–Heidegger debate). Whereas Cassirer defended the role of rationality in Kant, Heidegger argued for the priority of the imagination.\n\nDilthey's student Georg Misch wrote the first extended critical appropriation of Heidegger in \"Lebensphilosophie und Phänomenologie. Eine Auseinandersetzung der Diltheyschen Richtung mit Heidegger und Husserl\", Leipzig 1930 (3rd ed. Stuttgart 1964).\n\nHegel-influenced Marxist thinkers, especially György Lukács and the Frankfurt School, associated the style and content of Heidegger's thought with German irrationalism and criticized its political implications.\n\nInitially members of the Frankfurt School were positively disposed to Heidegger, becoming more critical at the beginning of the 1930s. Heidegger's student Herbert Marcuse became associated with the Frankfurt School. Initially striving for a synthesis between Hegelian Marxism and Heidegger's phenomenology, Marcuse later rejected Heidegger's thought for its \"false concreteness\" and \"revolutionary conservativism.\" Theodor Adorno wrote an extended critique of the ideological character of Heidegger's early and later use of language in the \"Jargon of Authenticity\". Contemporary social theorists associated with the Frankfurt School have remained largely critical of Heidegger's works and influence. In particular, Jürgen Habermas admonishes the influence of Heidegger on recent French philosophy in his polemic against \"postmodernism\" in \"The Philosophical Discourse of Modernity\" (1985). However, recent work by philosopher and critical theorist Nikolas Kompridis tries to show that Heidegger's insights into world disclosure are badly misunderstood and mishandled by Habermas, and are of vital importance for critical theory, offering an important way of renewing that tradition.\n\nCriticism of Heidegger's philosophy has also come from analytic philosophy, beginning with logical positivism. In \"The Elimination of Metaphysics Through Logical Analysis of Language\" (1932), Rudolf Carnap accused Heidegger of offering an \"illusory\" ontology, criticizing him for committing the fallacy of reification and for wrongly dismissing the logical treatment of language which, according to Carnap, can only lead to writing \"nonsensical pseudo-propositions.\"\n\nThe British logical positivist A. J. Ayer was strongly critical of Heidegger's philosophy. In Ayer's view, Heidegger proposed vast, overarching theories regarding existence, which are completely unverifiable through empirical demonstration and logical analysis. For Ayer, this sort of philosophy was a poisonous strain in modern thought. He considered Heidegger to be the worst example of such philosophy, which Ayer believed to be entirely useless.\n\nBertrand Russell commented, expressing the sentiments of many mid-20th-century analytic philosophers, that:\nHighly eccentric in its terminology, his philosophy is extremely obscure. One cannot help suspecting that language is here running riot. An interesting point in his speculations is the insistence that nothingness is something positive. As with much else in Existentialism, this is a psychological observation made to pass for logic.\n\nRoger Scruton stated that: \"His major work \"Being and Time\" is formidably difficult—unless it is utter nonsense, in which case it is laughably easy. I am not sure how to judge it, and have read no commentator who even begins to make sense of it\".\n\nThe analytic tradition values clarity of expression. Heidegger, however, has on occasion appeared to take an opposing view, stating for example:\n\nthose in the crossing must in the end know what is mistaken by all urging for intelligibility: that every thinking of being, all philosophy, can \"never\" be confirmed by \"facts,\" i.e., by beings. Making itself intelligible is suicide for philosophy. Those who idolize \"facts\" never notice that their idols only shine in a borrowed light. They are also meant not to notice this; for thereupon they would have to be at a loss and therefore useless. But idolizers and idols are used wherever gods are in flight and so announce \"their\" nearness.\n\nApart from the charge of obscurantism, other analytic philosophers considered the actual content of Heidegger's work to be either faulty and meaningless, vapid or uninteresting. However, not all analytic philosophers have been as hostile. Gilbert Ryle wrote a critical yet positive review of \"Being and Time\". Ludwig Wittgenstein made a remark recorded by Friedrich Waismann: \"To be sure, I can imagine what Heidegger means by being and anxiety\" which has been construed by some commentators as sympathetic to Heidegger's philosophical approach. These positive and negative analytic evaluations have been collected in Michael Murray (ed.), \"Heidegger and Modern Philosophy: Critical Essays\" (Yale University Press, 1978). Heidegger's reputation within English-language philosophy has slightly improved in philosophical terms in some part through the efforts of Hubert Dreyfus, Richard Rorty, and a recent generation of analytically oriented phenomenology scholars. Pragmatist Rorty claimed that Heidegger's approach to philosophy in the first half of his career has much in common with that of the latter-day Ludwig Wittgenstein. Nevertheless, Rorty asserted that what Heidegger had constructed in his writings was a myth of being rather than an account of it.\n\nThe Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy states that Heidegger's writing is \"notoriously difficult\", possibly because his thinking was \"original\" and clearly on obscure and innovative topics.\n\nEven though Heidegger is considered by many observers to be the most influential philosopher of the 20th century in continental philosophy, aspects of his work have been criticised by those who nevertheless acknowledge this influence, such as Hans-Georg Gadamer and Jacques Derrida. Some questions raised about Heidegger's philosophy include the priority of ontology, the status of animals, the nature of the religious, Heidegger's supposed neglect of ethics (Levinas), the body (Maurice Merleau-Ponty), sexual difference (Luce Irigaray), or space (Peter Sloterdijk).\n\nLevinas was deeply influenced by Heidegger, and yet became one of his fiercest critics, contrasting the infinity of the good beyond being with the immanence and totality of ontology. Levinas also condemned Heidegger's involvement with National Socialism, stating: \"One can forgive many Germans, but there are some Germans it is difficult to forgive. It is difficult to forgive Heidegger.\"\n\nHeidegger's defenders, notably Arendt, see his support for Nazism as arguably a personal \" 'error' \" (a word which Arendt placed in quotation marks when referring to Heidegger's Nazi-era politics). Defenders think this error was irrelevant to Heidegger's philosophy. Critics such as Levinas, Karl Löwith, and Theodor Adorno claim that Heidegger's support for National Socialism revealed flaws inherent in his thought.\n\n\nHeidegger's collected works are published by Vittorio Klostermann. The \"Gesamtausgabe\" was begun during Heidegger's lifetime. He defined the order of publication and dictated that the principle of editing should be \"ways not works.\" Publication has not yet been completed.\n\nThe contents are listed here: \"Heidegger Gesamtausgabe\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

It is a modification of the standard Hebb's Rule (see Hebbian learning) that, through multiplicative normalization, solves all stability problems and generates an algorithm for principal components analysis. This is a computational form of an effect which is believed to happen in biological neurons.\n\nOja's rule requires a number of simplifications to derive, but in its final form it is demonstrably stable, unlike Hebb's rule. It is a single-neuron special case of the Generalized Hebbian Algorithm. However, Oja's rule can also be generalized in other ways to varying degrees of stability and success.\n\nOja's rule defines the change in presynaptic weights given the output response formula_1 of a neuron to its inputs to be\n\nwhere is the \"learning rate\" which can also change with time. Note that the bold symbols are vectors and defines a discrete time iteration. The rule can also be made for continuous iterations as\n\nThe simplest learning rule known is Hebb's rule, which states in conceptual terms that \"neurons that fire together, wire together\". In component form as a difference equation, it is written\n\nor in scalar form with implicit -dependence,\n\nwhere is again the output, this time explicitly dependent on its input vector .\n\nHebb's rule has synaptic weights approaching infinity with a positive learning rate. We can stop this by normalizing the weights so that each weight's magnitude is restricted between 0, corresponding to no weight, and 1, corresponding to being the only input neuron with any weight. We do this by normalizing the weight vector to be of length one:\n\nNote that in Oja's original paper, , corresponding to quadrature (root sum of squares), which is the familiar Cartesian normalization rule. However, any type of normalization, even linear, will give the same result without loss of generality.\n\nFor a small learning rate formula_7 the equation can be expanded as a Power series in formula_8.\n\nFor small , our higher-order terms go to zero. We again make the specification of a linear neuron, that is, the output of the neuron is equal to the sum of the product of each input and its synaptic weight, or\n\nWe also specify that our weights normalize to , which will be a necessary condition for stability, so\n\nwhich, when substituted into our expansion, gives Oja's rule, or\n\nIn analyzing the convergence of a single neuron evolving by Oja's rule, one extracts the first \"principal component\", or feature, of a data set. Furthermore, with extensions using the Generalized Hebbian Algorithm, one can create a multi-Oja neural network that can extract as many features as desired, allowing for principal components analysis.\n\nA principal component is extracted from a dataset through some associated vector , or , and we can restore our original dataset by taking\n\nIn the case of a single neuron trained by Oja's rule, we find the weight vector converges to , or the first principal component, as time or number of iterations approaches infinity. We can also define, given a set of input vectors , that its correlation matrix has an associated eigenvector given by with eigenvalue . The variance of outputs of our Oja neuron then converges with time iterations to the principal eigenvalue, or\n\nThese results are derived using Lyapunov function analysis, and they show that Oja's neuron necessarily converges on strictly the first principal component if certain conditions are met in our original learning rule. Most importantly, our learning rate is allowed to vary with time, but only such that its sum is \"divergent\" but its power sum is \"convergent\", that is\n\nOur output activation function is also allowed to be nonlinear and nonstatic, but it must be continuously differentiable in both and and have derivatives bounded in time.\n\nRecently, in the context of associative learning, it has been shown that the Hebbian rule, which is similar to Oja's rule, can be generalized using an Ising-like model: The main idea of the generalization is based on formulating energy function like in Ising model and then applying stochastic gradient descent algorithm to this energy function. The energy function and the update rule corresponding to following the derivative are given by:\n\nwhere:\nformula_18, formula_19 is the coupling among inputs, formula_20 is the correlation strength between the model and the output, formula_21 corresponds to the presence of an external magnetic field, formula_22 determines the connections among inputs.\n\nThen, for formula_23, formula_24, and formula_25 we get the Hebbian rule, and for formula_23, formula_27, formula_25, and formula_29, where formula_30 is an identity matrix, introduce weight decay. The formula then reduces to:\n\nOja's rule was originally described in Oja's 1982 paper, but the principle of self-organization to which it is applied is first attributed to Alan Turing in 1952. PCA has also had a long history of use before Oja's rule formalized its use in network computation in 1989. The model can thus be applied to any problem of self-organizing mapping, in particular those in which feature extraction is of primary interest. Therefore, Oja's rule has an important place in image and speech processing. It is also useful as it expands easily to higher dimensions of processing, thus being able to integrate multiple outputs quickly. A canonical example is its use in binocular vision.\n\nThere is clear evidence for both long-term potentiation and long-term depression in biological neural networks, along with a normalization effect in both input weights and neuron outputs. However, while there is no direct experimental evidence yet of Oja's rule active in a biological neural network, a biophysical derivation of a generalization of the rule is possible. Such a derivation requires retrograde signalling from the postsynaptic neuron, which is biologically plausible (see neural backpropagation), and takes the form of\n\nwhere as before is the synaptic weight between the th input and th output neurons, is the input, is the postsynaptic output, and we define to be a constant analogous the learning rate, and and are presynaptic and postsynaptic functions that model the weakening of signals over time.

By taking the pre- and post-synaptic functions into frequency space and combining integration terms with the convolution, we find that this gives an arbitrary-dimensional generalization of Oja's rule known as Oja's Subspace, namely\n\n\n"}

This form of dementia is not the true form and does not result from the same cognitive changes. Once the depression is properly treated or the medication therapy is changed, the cognitive impairment can be effectively reversed. True dementia involves a steady and irreversible cognitive decline. In addition, diminished mental capacity and social withdrawal are commonly identified as symptoms in the elderly but oftentimes is due to symptoms of depression. As a result, elderly patients are often misdiagnosed especially when healthcare professionals do not make an accurate assessment.\n\nPseudodementia is a phenotype approximated by a wide variety of underlying disorders. Data indicate that some of the disorders that can convert to a pseudodementia-like presentation include depression (mood), schizophrenia, mania, dissociative disorders, Ganser syndrome, conversion reaction, and psychoactive drugs. Although the frequency distribution of disorders presenting as pseudodementia remains unclear, what is clear is that depressive pseudodementia, synonymously referred to as depressive dementia or major depression with depressive dementia, represents a major subclass of the overarching category of pseudodementia. It has long been observed that in the differential diagnosis between dementia and pseudodementia, depressive pseudodementia appears to be the single most difficult disorder to distinguish from nosologically established \"organic\" categories of dementia, especially degenerative dementia of the Alzheimer type. \"Depressive pseudodementia\" is a syndrome seen in older people in which they exhibit symptoms consistent with dementia but the cause is actually depression.\n\nOlder people with predominantly cognitive symptoms such as loss of memory, and vagueness, as well as prominent slowing of movement and reduced or slowed speech, were sometimes misdiagnosed as having dementia when further investigation showed they were suffering from a major depressive episode. This was an important distinction as the former was untreatable and progressive and the latter treatable with antidepressant therapy, electroconvulsive therapy, or both. In contrast to major depression, dementia is a progressive neurodegenerative syndrome involving a pervasive impairment of higher cortical functions resulting from widespread brain pathology.\n\nIf effective medical treatment for depression is given, this can aid in the distinction between pseudodementia and dementia. Antidepressants have been found to assist in the elimination of cognitive dysfunction associated with depression, whereas cognitive dysfunction associated with true dementia continues along a steady gradient.  In cases where antidepressant therapy is not well tolerated, patients can consider electroconvulsive therapy as a possible alternative. However, studies have revealed that patients who displayed cognitive dysfunction related to depression eventually developed dementia later on in their lives.\n\nThe development of treatments for dementia has not been as fast as those for depression. Thus far, cholinesterase inhibitors is the most popular drug used to combat dementia and provides improvement in cognitive function.\n\nThe term was first coined in 1961 by psychiatrist Leslie Kiloh, who noticed patients with cognitive symptoms consistent with dementia who improved with treatment. Reversible causes of true dementia must be excluded. His term was mainly descriptive. The clinical phenomenon, however, was well-known since the late 19th century as melancholic dementia.\n\nDoubts about the classification and features of the syndrome, and the misleading nature of the name, led to proposals that the term be dropped. However, proponents argue that although it is not a defined singular concept with a precise set of symptoms, it is a practical and useful term which has held up well in clinical practice, and also highlights those who may have a treatable condition.\n\nThe history of disturbance in pseudodementia is often short and abrupt onset, while dementia is more often insidious. Clinically, people with pseudodementia differ from those with true dementia when their memory is tested. They will often answer that they don't know the answer to a question, and their attention and concentration are often intact, and they may appear upset or distressed. Those with true dementia will often give wrong answers, have poor attention and concentration, and appear indifferent or unconcerned.\n\nThe implementation and application of existing collaborative care models such as DICE can aid in avoiding misdiagnosis. Comorbidities (such as vascular, infectious, traumatic, autoimmune, idiopathic, or even malnourishment) have the potential to mimic symptoms of dementia. For instance, studies have also shown a relationship between depression and its cognitive effects on everyday functioning and distortions of memory. \n\nInvestigations such as PET and SPECT imaging of the brain show reduced blood flow in areas of the brain in people with Alzheimer's disease, compared with a more normal blood flow in those with pseudodementia.\n"}

Public executions also permitted the state to project its superiority over political opponents. Thus, when Charles I of England was beheaded, the reduced height of the block meant that he could not assume the normal kneeling pose, but was forced to lie in a face-down position considered to be especially humiliating.\n\nIn Europe and in the northern U.S., the 19th and early 20th centuries saw a shift away from the spectacle of public capital punishment and toward administration of punishment via the deprivation of liberty. While some reformers opposed capital punishment, public executions remained common throughout the 19th and early 20th centuries. Social historians note that beginning in the 20th century in the U.S. and western Europe death in general became increasingly shielded from public view, occurring more and more behind the closed doors of the hospital. Executions were likewise moved behind the walls of the penitentiary. The last formal public executions occurred in 1868 in Britain, in 1936 in the U.S. and in 1939 in France.\n\nAccording to Amnesty International, in 2012 \"public executions were known to have been carried out in Iran, North Korea, Saudi Arabia and Somalia.\" Amnesty International does not include Syria, Afghanistan, and Yemen in their list of public execution countries, but there have been reports of public executions carried out there by state and non-state actors, such as ISIS. Executions which can be classified as public were also carried out in the U.S. states of Florida and Utah as of 1992. \n\n"}

The procedure is also called multifetal reduction. The procedure is most commonly done to reduce the number of fetuses in a multiple pregnancy to a safe number, when the multiple pregnancy is the result of use of assisted reproductive technology; outcomes for both the mother and the babies are generally worse, the higher the number of fetuses. The procedure is also used in multiple pregnancies when one of the fetuses has a serious and incurable disease, or in the case where one of the fetuses is outside the uterus, in which case it is called selective termination.\n\nThe procedure generally takes two days; the first day for testing in order to select which fetuses to reduce, and the second day for the procedure itself, in which potassium chloride is injected into the heart of each selected fetus under the guidance of ultrasound imaging. Risks of the procedure include bleeding requiring transfusion, rupture of the uterus, retained placenta, infection, a miscarriage, and prelabor rupture of membranes. Each of these appears to be rare.\n\nSelective reduction was developed in the mid-1980s, as people in the field of assisted reproductive technology became aware of the risks that multiple pregnancies carried for the mother and for the fetuses.\n\nSelective reduction is used when a mother is carrying an unsafe or undesirable number of fetuses in a multiple pregnancy, which are common in medically-assisted pregnancies, in order to reduce the number of fetuses to a number that is relatively safe for the mother and the remaining fetuses. It is also used in cases of multiple pregnancy where at least one of the fetuses is implanted outside the uterus to preserve the life of the mother and the fetus in the uterus, and when one or more of the fetuses has a serious and incurable disease.\n\nWhile the data is weak, due to the small sizes of studies and the lack of randomized controlled trials, as of 2017 it appeared that when short term perinatal outcomes in multiple pregnancies reduced to twins are compared to those of non-reduced triplets, there were fewer deaths among the reduced babies, the twins were born later and were less likely to be premature, and had higher birthweight. As of 2017 longterm outcomes were not well understood. A 2015 Cochrane review found no randomized clinical trials to evaluate.\n\nGenerally selective reduction reduces the risk of preterm birth, leading to better outcomes for both mothers and the newborns.\n\nGenerally selective reduction reduces the risk of preterm birth, leading to better outcomes for both mothers and the newborns.\n\nIt appears that reduction of triplets, where each triplet is in its own placenta, to twins results in a lower risk of preterm birth and does not increase the risk of miscarriage. In triplets where two of the fetuses share a placenta and each has its own amniotic sac, it appears, with less certainty, that there is also a lower risk of preterm birth and no increase in the risk of miscarriage.\n\nRisks of the procedure include bleeding requiring transfusion, rupture of the uterus, retained placenta, infection, a miscarriage, and prelabor rupture of membranes. Each of these appears to be rare.\n\nThe reduction procedure is generally carried out during the first trimester of pregnancy. The procedure often takes two days; the first day is for testing, and the procedure happens on the second day. The fetuses are evaluated, first by ultrasound, then often by testing the amniotic fluid and chorionic villus sampling; these tests help determine which fetuses are accessible for the procedure, and whether any fetuses are unhealthy. Once the specific fetuses to be reduced are identified, potassium chloride is injected into the heart of each selected fetus under the guidance of ultrasound imaging; the heart stops and the fetus dies as a result. Generally, the fetal material is reabsorbed into the woman's body.\n\nSelective reduction was developed in the mid-1980s, as people in the field of assisted reproductive technology became aware of the risks that multiple pregnancies carried for the mother and for the fetuses. The procedure was somewhat controversial from the beginning, and drew some attention from anti-abortion activists. \n\nA set of ethical guidelines was developed in collaboration with a bioethicist from NIH and was published in 1988; it justified reducing pregnancies with more than three fetuses to two or three.\n\nOver time, more and more women sought to become pregnant when they were older, having the first child when they were over forty years old. At the same time, the field of ART matured, and massively multiple pregnancies became more rare. Both trends led to more women asking for reduction to one fetus, which was very controversial at first, but has gradually become more accepted. Sex-selective reduction is widely considered to be unethical in making decisions about which fetus to keep.\n\n"}

He also appeared, sometimes as a hero and sometimes as a bad guy, in the major big-screen productions \"Les bijoutiers du clair de lune\" (1958), \"The Bravados\" (1958), \"Imperial Venus\" (1962), \"The Fall of the Roman Empire\" (1964), \"Genghis Khan\" (1965), \"Fantastic Voyage\" (1966) and \"Shalako\" (1968).\n\nStephen Boyd – real name William Millar – was born in a house, long demolished, at the corner of the Doagh Road, Whitehouse on July 4, 1931. Boyd was the youngest of nine siblings born to Irish/Canadian parents, James Alexander Millar and his wife Martha Boyd. At a very early age, William, or Billy as he was known, moved with the family to live in Glengormley. Boyd attended the local Public Elementary School and Ballyclare High School, but at the age of fourteen Boyd quit school to take up other jobs to help support his family. He eventually joined the Ulster Group Theater where he learned the behind the scenes tasks of the theater. He became well known in Belfast for his contributions as a gravel-voiced policeman on the Ulster Radio program \"The McCooeys\", the story of a Belfast family written by Joseph Tomelty. Boyd eventually worked his way up to character parts and then starring roles. By nineteen he had toured Canada with summer stock companies. In 1950 he made a coast to coast tour of America with the Clare Tree Major Company, 1956 performing \"A Streetcar Named Desire\" in the lead role as Stanley Kowalski. Boyd would later recall this as \"the best performance I ever gave in my life.\" \n\nBy the time he was twenty, Boyd had a wide range of theater experience, but he longed for the big stage. In 1952 Boyd moved to London and worked in a cafeteria and busked outside a cinema in Leicester Square to get money as he was literally close to starvation. Boyd caught his first break as a doorman at the Odeon Theatre. The Leicester Square Cinema across the street recruited him to usher attendees during the British Academy Awards in the early 1950s. During the awards ceremony he was noticed by actor Sir Michael Redgrave, who used his connections to introduce Boyd to the director of the Windsor Repertory Group. At this point Boyd's stage career in the U.K. began to flourish with performances in \"The Deep Blue Sea\" and \"Barnett's Folly\" \n\nBoyd's first role which brought him acclaim was as an Irish spy in the movie \"The Man Who Never Was\", based on the book by Ewen Montagu. The movie was released in April 1956.\n\nShortly thereafter he signed a ten-year contract with 20th Century Fox studios, who began prepping him for Hollywood. But it would be a while until Boyd actually set foot on a Hollywood back-lot. Boyd's next stop was Portugal to make \"Hell in Korea\", which also featured future stars Michael Caine and Robert Shaw. In June 1956, Boyd was cast in the nautical, ship-wreck adventure \"Abandon Ship!\" for Columbia Studios starring Tyrone Power. This was filmed in the summer of 1956 in London where the British Navy built a huge 35,000 gallon water tank for the movie.\n\nIn November 1956, for Twentieth Century Fox, Boyd traveled to the British West Indies as part of a large ensemble cast in Darryl Zanuck's racially provocative film \"Island in the Sun\", based on the Alec Waugh novel. Boyd portrayed a young English aristocrat who becomes the lover of Joan Collins. Boyd would be loaned out to the J. Arthur Rank production of \"Seven Thunders (Beast of Marseilles)\", a World War II romance set in Nazi-occupied Marseilles. This movie was filmed on location in Marseilles and at Pinewood Studios in London in the spring of 1957 and featured Boyd in his most prominent starring film role yet.\n\nAround the same time French actress Brigitte Bardot was given the opportunity to cast her own leading man in her next movie after her success in Roger Vadim's \"And God Created Woman\", and she chose Boyd. From August to October 1957, Bardot, Boyd and Alida Valli filmed the lusty romance \"The Night Heaven Fell\", directed by Roger Vadim in Paris and in the region of Málaga, Spain, specifically the small, white-washed town of Mijas. Being in the Bardot spotlight added much to Boyd's film credit, in addition to bringing him notice in Hollywood.\n\nStephen Boyd finally arrived in Hollywood in January 1958 to take on his first true Hollywood role as the leader of a quartet of renegade outlaws in the Twentieth Century Fox western \"The Bravados\", which starred Gregory Peck and Joan Collins. Even though this was a Hollywood production, the actual filming took place in Morelia, Mexico.\n\nAfter the filming of \"The Bravados\" was complete in late March 1958, Stephen Boyd returned to Hollywood to audition for the coveted role of Messala in MGM's upcoming epic \"Ben-Hur\". Many other actors, including Victor Mature, Kirk Douglas, Leslie Nielsen and Stewart Granger had been considered for the part, but Stephen Boyd's screen test convinced director William Wyler that he had found the perfect villain for his epic, as Wyler had also admired Boyd's performance in \"The Man Who Never Was\" the previous year. Boyd was hurried off to join actor Charlton Heston in Rome in May 1958 to learn the chariot racing aspect of his role. Heston had already been practicing behind the chariot for weeks, so Boyd needed to learn quickly. Boyd was also required to wear brown contact lenses as Messala, which irritated his eyes and caused vision problems for a few months after the movie was completed. Despite this, Boyd described the filming experience of \"Ben-Hur\" (which took place in Cinecittà Studios in Rome), as the most exciting experience of his life.\n\nYears after the movie was released, interim \"Ben-Hur\" screenwriter and novelist Gore Vidal revealed that Boyd had portrayed his famous character Messala in \"Ben-Hur\" with an underlying homosexual energy, as instructed to by Gore Vidal when he greets Ben-Hur Charlton Heston in the opening sequence. In Gore Vidal's autobiography \"Palimpsest,\" Vidal describes his discussion first with director William Wyler, concerning Messala's underlying motivation, namely that Messala and Judah Ben-Hur had previously been lovers. This was based on an idea by Vidal to enhance the tension between the two main antagonists. Wyler specifically told Vidal, \"You talk to Boyd. But don't \"you\" say a word to Chuck or he'll fall apart.\" In \"Palimpsest\", Vidal said, \"Over the next few years, whenever we met (William Wyler), we quarreled amiably over what I had put in the scene and what Steven Boyd is clearly playing.\" Vidal would later come into conflict with actor Charlton Heston about his version of the Messala/Ben-Hur relationship and the implications surrounding Ben-Hur.\n\nAfter the filming of \"Ben-Hur\" was completed Boyd returned to Hollywood in early 1959 to star with Academy Award winner Susan Hayward in the Canadian-based drama \"Woman Obsessed\". Some advertisements for this movie labeled Boyd as \"The New Gable.\" He was then part of another excellent ensemble cast in the adaptation of Rona Jaffe's novel \"The Best of Everything\", filmed in May and June 1959 at Fox Studios in Hollywood and on location in New York City.\n\n\"Ben-Hur\" was released in December 1959 and immediately made Boyd an international star. His portrayal of the Roman tribune Messala brought in rave reviews. Press columnist Erskine Johnson wrote, \"A brass hat and the armor of a Roman warrior in \"Ben-Hur\" does for Stephen Boyd what a tight dress does for Marilyn Monroe.\" Ruth Waterbury, in her Boyd feature in the Pittsburgh Post Gazette, would describe Boyd's character as \"the dangerously masculine and quite magnificent Messala.\" \"Modern Screen\" magazine in 1960 stated that Boyd's ruthless Messala had \"lost the chariot race but captured the sympathy and sex appeal of \"Ben-Hur\".\"\n\nBoyd was featured in the popular TV program \"This Is Your Life\" on 3 February 1960, which featured many of Boyd's family members and acquaintances (including Michael Redgrave) telling stories about his early life and film career. This should be some indication of how \"Stephen Boyd fever\" was catching. Newspaper columnists were getting swarmed with letters from female fans of all ages wanting to know more about Boyd. He was being sent dozens of starring roles, most of which he had to turn down due to other obligations. He opted out of the biblical epic \"The Story of Ruth\", which didn't please Fox studios, and he was one of the front-runners to star with Marilyn Monroe in her picture \"Let's Make Love\".\n\nIn early 1960 Boyd won the Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor – Motion Picture for his performance in \"Ben-Hur\". In January 1960 Boyd made a guest appearance alongside the silent-era \"Ben-Hur\" stars Ramon Novarro and Francis X. Bushman on Hedda Hopper's special television programme \"Hedda Hopper's Hollywood\". In February 1960 he starred in the Playhouse 90 television performance called \"The Sound of Trumpets\" with Dolores Hart, which garnered good reviews. He also appeared as a singing guest on The Dinah Shore Chevy Show on March 13, 1960 where he performed two Irish folk songs with Dinah Shore, \"The Leprechaun Song\" and \"Molly Malone\", and an Irish step dance.\n\nBoyd himself chose to do roles which he felt comfortable in. His next choice was \"The Big Gamble\", which featured Darryl F. Zanuck's current paramour and French icon Juliette Gréco. It was filmed on the Ivory Coast of West Africa, Dublin and the southern part of France in the spring and summer of 1961. The adventure of making this film almost outdid the adventure in the film itself as the crew slept in tents in the jungle that were guarded by natives on parole for cannibalism. Boyd nearly drowned in the Ardèche river during the making of the film. Luckily he was saved by his co-star and excellent swimmer David Wayne. Boyd spoke about this incident during his appearance on the popular TV programme \"What's My Line?\" which aired on 11 December 1960.\n\nBoyd was originally chosen to play Mark Antony opposite Elizabeth Taylor in 20th Century Fox's epic production of \"Cleopatra\" (1963) under the direction of Rouben Mamoulian. He began film work in September 1960 but eventually withdrew from the problem-plagued production after Elizabeth Taylor's severe illness postponed the film for months. (\"Cleopatra\" was later directed by Joseph L. Mankiewicz, and the role of Mark Antony went to Richard Burton.) During this period of waiting in April 1961 Stephen Boyd was sent to Cairo, Egypt on a publicity tour by Twentieth Century Fox along with fellow actors Julie Newmar and Barbara Eden to attend the inaugural ceremony of the sound and light show at the pyramids of Giza.\n\nAfter several months without active work, Boyd was thrilled to finally get his first post-Cleopatra role. The film was \"The Inspector\", renamed \"Lisa\" for the American release. It was based on the novel by Jan de Hartog and co- starred actress Dolores Hart. The film was made in Amsterdam , London and Wales during the summer of 1961. On January 9, 1962, Boyd was featured in a television film from General Electric Theater called \"The Wall Between\", co-starring Ronald Reagan and Gloria Talbott. Next, Boyd was again loaned out to MGM Studios to star with Doris Day in the circus musical \"Billy Rose's Jumbo\", filmed during the early part of 1962; the role earned Boyd a nomination for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy.\n\nBoyd flew to Rome in the summer of 1962 to act with Italian superstar Gina Lollobrigida in her long-time pet project \"Imperial Venus\", a romantic epic about the many loves of Pauline Bonaparte, the sister of Napoleon. This film was the first film to be banned by the Motion Picture Association of America for male nudity. Boyd appeared in a humorous bedroom scene, naked, but covered by a sheet. The suggestion of nudity was too much for the censors and the movie was never released in the United States. Boyd returned to the States briefly after finishing Imperial Venus where he appeared for the second time on The Dinah Shore Chevy Show, which aired on November 11, 1962. For thus program Boyd was a last minute replacement for actor James Garner and joined Shore and entertainer Dean Martin for a few musical numbers.\n\nBoyd arrived in Spain in early 1963 to begin work on Samuel Bronston's massive production of the\"The Fall of the Roman Empire\", directed by Anthony Mann. This was filmed during a severely cold winter in Europe and the production in the Sierra de Guadarrama of Spain encountered several challenges with the snow. Boyd's co-star was another Italian legend, Sophia Loren. Boyd also had the opportunity to ride another chariot in this film. Although the movie did well internationally when it was released in April 1964, it was a box office failure in the United States and signaled the end of Roman epics in the 1960s. More appreciated with the passing of time, \"The Fall of the Roman Empire\" was also recognized by critics as being a major inspiration for Ridley Scott's Academy Award winning movie \"Gladiator.\"\nBoyd flew back to Hollywood in the summer to star in a Bob Hope Presents the Chrysler Theatre TV Program with Louis Jourdan called \"War of Nerves\", which aired on January 3, 1964. He then returned to Europe to film the suspenseful \"The Third Secret (film)\" starring Pamela Franklin and Diane Cilento.\n\nOn December 23, 1963, Stephen Boyd became a naturalized U.S. citizen during a ceremony at the Federal Building in Los Angeles, California.\n\nStephen Boyd was originally cast as the lead in Anthony Mann's WWII drama \"The Unknown Battle\", which was set to film in early 1964 with co-stars Elke Sommer and Anthony Perkins in Norway. After several weeks of waiting, studio funding for the project fell though. Boyd sued Mann for $500,000 for a breach of contract, missed time and other lost film opportunities. The project was finally completed by Mann a year later and released as \"Heroes of Telemark\" with Kirk Douglas replacing Boyd as the lead. \n\nIn 1964 Boyd continued to make films in Europe, traveling to Yugoslavia to star as the villain Jamuga in the epic \"Genghis Khan\". Boyd was the top billed and therefore the top paid star in the epic, and this apparently caused friction with up-and-coming star Omar Sharif. After completing \"Genghis Khan\", Boyd trekked to Cairo, Egypt for a brief appearance as the regal King Nimrod at The Tower of Babel in Dino de Laurentiis's production of \"\", directed by John Huston. \n\nAfter all this globe-trotting, the world weary Boyd was very happy to return to the United States to start work on the Twentieth Century Fox science fiction adventure \"Fantastic Voyage\", co-starring with soon-to-be icon Raquel Welch. This was filmed in the early part of 1965. In the summer of 1965, Boyd joined German star Elke Sommer and music legend Tony Bennett to film the Hollywood drama \"The Oscar\", based on the eponymous Richard Sale novel. The movie was a popular success, but maligned by film critics. Boyd would make a 10-day visit to Iran in December 1965 to film his scenes for the United Nations film project \"The Poppy Is Also a Flower\", written by James Bond creator Ian Fleming.\n\nIn 1966 the producer of \"The Oscar\", Joseph Levine, hired Boyd for his next film project, \"The Caper of the Golden Bulls\", based on a William McGivern novel. This movie was partly filmed on location in Spain in the summer of 1966. The actors, including Boyd, took part in the famous Feria del Toro de San Fermin festival in Pamplona (known as the Running of the Bulls).\n\nTwo of Boyd's projects were ranked among the top twenty-five grossing films of 1966; \"\" at number one and \"Fantastic Voyage\" at twenty-two.\n\nNext, Boyd starred in a spy thriller \"Assignment K\" with Swedish model/actress Camilla Sparv, which was filmed in Germany, Austria and London during February and March 1967. Boyd grew a full beard for his next role as the iconic Irish playwright and critic George Bernard Shaw in the Off-Broadway play called \"The Bashful Genius\" written by Harold Callen. This was Boyd's first return to the stage since the mid-1950s, and the experience for Boyd was immensely rewarding on a personal level. He received excellent reviews for his nuanced performance of the multi-faceted Shaw. The play had a very brief run during the summer of 1967 in Denver, Philadelphia and Falmouth, Massachusetts.\n\nIn early 1968 Boyd was cast as the heavy opposite Sean Connery and Brigitte Bardot in the western adventure \"\"Shalako\" (film)\", based on the Louis L'Amour novel. \"Shalako\" was filmed in the early part of 1968 in Almería, Spain. After returning to the United States, Boyd took the role of the cruel slave master Nathan MacKay in the Southern \"Slavesploitation\" drama \"Slaves\", also starring Ossie Davis and songstress Dionne Warwick. The film was loosely based on the famous Harriet Beecher Stowe novel \"Uncle Tom's Cabin\". It was filmed during the summer of 1968 at the supposedly haunted Buena Vista plantation near Shreveport, Louisiana . The film was released during the volatile civil rights era and in May 1969 Boyd attended the premiere alongside Dionne Warwick in Baltimore, Maryland Closely following \"Slaves\", Boyd starred in another story about racial tension, this time a World War II made-for-television drama called \"Carter's Army\" (or \"Black Brigade\") which aired in August 1970, featuring a young Richard Pryor.\n\nIt was around this time that Boyd began his interest in L. Ron Hubbard's Church of Scientology, which would make him one of the first Hollywood stars to be involved in it. Boyd had always expressed an interest in esoteric religions. In an interview in August 1969 with the Detroit Free Press, Boyd explained that Scientology had helped him through the filming of \"Slaves\", and that to him Scientology was \"a process used to make you capable of learning. Scientology is nothing. It means only what you want it to. It is not a church you go to pray, but a church that you go to learn. It is no good unless you apply it. It is the application.\" Boyd apparently had been elevated to a Scientology Status of OC 6, a position beneath that of Clear. Boyd would actually go on to star and narrate a Scientology recruiting film called \"Freedom\" in 1970. A copy of this film can be found at the Library of Congress, but it is not available online via any Scientology resource, which may indicate a falling out Boyd had with Scientology using his name for recruiting purposes. There is no documentation of his later involvement with Scientology after the early 1970s.\n\nDuring the 1970s the demand for Boyd in Hollywood diminished, so he focused his attention on European films and several television pilots and shows. He made three films in Spain with director José Antonio Nieves Conde, including \"Marta\" in 1970, \"The Great Swindle\" in 1971, and \"Casa Manchada\" in 1975. He worked with cult director Romain Gary in the drug thriller \"Kill!\" in 1971. He also made several Westerns, including \"Hannie Caulder\" with Raquel Welch in 1971, \"The Man Called Noon\" in 1973, \"Those Dirty Dogs\" in 1973, and \"Potato Fritz\" in 1976. Boyd continued to travel to a wide variety of locations to work, including Australia for \"The Hands of Cormac Joyce\" in 1972, South Africa for \"Control Factor\" and \"The Manipulator\" in 1972-1973, Jamaica for the scuba diving adventure \"The Treasure of Jamaica Reef\" in 1972, Florida for the television pilot \"Key West\" in 1973, and Hawaii in his last acting stint as a guest star on the popular television show \"Hawaii Five-O\" in 1977. The episode \"Up the Rebels\" was the premiere episode of \"Hawaii Five-O\"&apos;s tenth season, and it aired after Boyd's death on 15 September 1977. His most critically acclaimed role during the 1970s was as a colourful Irish gangster in the UK crime thriller \"The Squeeze\" in 1977.\n\nA letter from film producer Euan Lloyd (who produced such films as \"Shalako\", \"The Man Called Noon\" and \"The Wild Geese\"), states that \"Stephen Boyd was one of the nicest, kindest people I have met in my lifetime, rare in this profession.\"\n\nAlthough Boyd spent most of his adult life traveling abroad for film work, he made his permanent home in southern California. At one point in the 1960s, he had three homes there — one above the Sunset Strip, one in Tarzana and another in Palm Springs, where he enjoyed his favorite pastime, golf. He would make frequent trips back to his hometown of Belfast in Northern Ireland. to visit his family. On one particular visit to Belfast in 1971, Boyd exclaimed his dismay about the situation in Northern Ireland at that time: \"Because of the divisiveness, the potential for displaying to the world all that is good in that lovely land is lost, perhaps even destroyed.\" Boyd was valued so highly by his native city of Belfast that during his visits he was always given a military escort from the airport to his home for security reasons during The Troubles.\n\nBoyd died suddenly of a massive heart attack on 2 June 1977 at the age of 45 while playing golf with his wife Elizabeth Mills at the Porter Valley Country Club in Northridge, California. \"Stephen and Elizabeth were in a golf cart between the fifth and sixth tees when suddenly he said. 'I don't feel well. I don't think we should go on' and slumped over. Elizabeth dragged him out of the cart and gave him artificial respiration, but it was too late.\" He was in talks to play the role of the Regimental Sergeant Major in Euan Lloyd's \"The Wild Geese\" before his death.\n\nBoyd was cremated and his ashes were interred in Oakwood Memorial Park Cemetery in Chatsworth, California. His wife Elizabeth Mills Boyd was interred with him at the time of her death in 2007. Boyd is also remembered on his parents' grave in the Clandeboye Cemetery, Bangor, U.K.\n\nOn July 4, 2018, the Ulster History Circle, a voluntary organization which erects plaques across the province of Ulster to celebrate people of achievement, commemorated Stephen Boyd with a blue plaque close to his birthplace at 'Moygara', Shore Road, Whitehouse (Belfast, Northern Ireland).\n\n\"Silver Screen\" Magazine in 1960 wrote this about Boyd:\n\nJournalist Florabel Muir described Boyd's appeal in a feature from 1966. \"I would think it has to be his ruggedly masculine good looks. Strong, even craggy features, a wide sympathetic mouth, firm chin, athletic build, wavy dark brown hair, roving 185-lb. frame – all that plus a musical voice and the savoir faire of a much-traveled fellow – his films have taken him to many places in the world, and a rolling stone acquires a high polish.\" \n\nPersonally, Boyd was popular with Hollywood columnists, including his friend Hedda Hopper, as well as fellow actors and other members of the entertainment industry because of his charm and sense of humor. \"Boyd is the kind of a man who was born to make friends and he has been doing it most of his life...Boyd is a blue-eyed, curly-haired chunk of masculinity, who makes no attempt to hide the fact that he just plain likes people. On the set of \"Ben-Hur\" he rarely occupied the fancy portable dressing room set aside for his use. Instead, he spent his time between scenes sitting around and chatting with electricians, carpenters and his fellow actors. He will discuss any subject and enjoys a good argument. He can, like most Irishmen, sprinkle his talk with wit as well as sagacity.\" \n\nBoyd was first married in 1958 to Italian-born MCA executive Mariella Di Sarzana during the filming of \"Ben-Hur\". They separated after just three weeks. Concerning his short-lived marriage to Sarzana, Boyd would explain, \"It was my fault. I'm an Irish so-and-so when I'm working. I hadn't been married a week when we both knew we had made a mistake. She is a nice girl but we were just not meant for each other. I suppose I wasn't ready for marriage. Maybe I was still too much of an adolescent.\" They officially divorced in early 1959.\n\nBoyd lived as a bachelor for most of his life and was wary of marriage after his first experience. His secretary Elizabeth Mills was a permanent resident at his Tarzana home during these years, though the two did not marry until 1974.\n\nBoyd had a deep and lasting friendship with actress and French icon Brigitte Bardot. Boyd starred in two movies with Bardot — \"The Night Heaven Fell\" in 1958 and \"Shalako\" in 1968. During the filming of \"Shalako\" in Almeria, Spain, Bardot and Boyd's close relationship and open affection for each other sparked numerous rumors of a possible affair. It even caused Brigitte's husband at the time, Gunter Sachs, to ask for a divorce. In Bardot's autobiography, she described the events and states that Boyd \"was never her lover, but a tender and attentive friend.\" In an interview with \"Photoplay Film\" in 1968, Boyd said, \"Bardot is always Bardot. She's marvelous. She's an enormous star and she's a unique, marvelous woman. I adore her.\" Even though both actors denied the affair, the press was \"convinced there was a romance afoot, that Brigitte and Boyd openly displayed their affection for each other, but that publication of the report on their romance cooled it.\" \nBoyd also had a close relationship with actress Dolores Hart. Hart describes what would be her only romance with a co-star in her autobiography \"The Ear of the Heart\". Boyd eventually rejected her advances, but they remained close friends even after she turned to the cloistered life of a nun in 1963. He visited her in 1966 at the Abbey of Regina Laudis in Connecticut and remained in communication with her up until the early 1970s.\n\nStephen Boyd's most passionate affair seems to have been with beautiful Austrian actress Marisa Mell. They met while filming the movie \"Marta\" in 1970. Boyd initially dodged Marisa Mell's amorous advances, but during the second film they made together, \"The Great Swindle\", the two became inseparable lovers. They married in a gypsy camp on the outskirts of Madrid in late 1971. The ceremony included a wrist cutting exchange of blood to seal their bond. The marriage was not considered legal, but Marisa Mell said, \"Who cares? In our minds it will be real.\" According to Marisa Mell, their affair was so intense that while living in Rome they made a trip to the Italian town of Sarsina for a ritual exorcism at the Cathedral of St. Vicinius. Boyd abruptly broke off the affair after the intensity apparently became too much to bear. In early 1972, after Boyd's departure, Mell had this to say about the break-up of their relationship: \"We both believe in reincarnation, and we realized we've already been lovers in three different lifetimes, and in each one I made him suffer terribly.\" For her part, Mell would fondly remember Boyd many years later in her autobiography 'Cover Love' from 1990, dedicating a whole chapter to their affair.\n\nBoyd's last marriage took place in 1974 to Elizabeth Mills, a secretary at the British Arts Council, whom he had known since 1953. Elizabeth Mills followed Boyd to the United States in the late 1950s and was his personal assistant, friend and confidante for many years before marrying him in the mid- 1970s.\n\n"}
{"id": "33835047", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=33835047", "title": "Synthetic biological circuit", "text": "Synthetic biological circuit\n\nSynthetic biological circuits are an application of synthetic biology where biological parts inside a cell are designed to perform logical functions mimicking those observed in electronic circuits. The applications range from simply inducing production to adding a measurable element, like GFP, to an existing natural biological circuit, to implementing completely new systems of many parts.\n\nThe goal of synthetic biology is to generate an array of tunable and characterized parts, or modules, with which any desirable synthetic biological circuit can be easily designed and implemented. These circuits can serve as a method to modify cellular functions, create cellular responses to environmental conditions, or influence cellular development. By implementing rational, controllable logic elements in cellular systems, researchers can use living systems as engineered \"biological machines\" to perform a vast range of useful functions.\n\nThe first natural gene circuit studied in detail was the lac operon. In studies of diauxic growth of \"E. coli\" on two-sugar media, Jacques Monod and Francois Jacob discovered that \"E.coli\" preferentially consumes the more easily processed glucose before switching to lactose metabolism. They discovered that the mechanism that controlled the metabolic \"switching\" function was a two-part control mechanism on the lac operon. When lactose is present in the cell the enzyme β-galactosidase is produced to convert lactose into glucose or galactose. When lactose is absent in the cell the lac repressor inhibits the production of the enzyme β-galactosidase to prevent any inefficient processes within the cell.\n\nThe lac operon is used in the biotechnology industry for production of recombinant proteins for therapeutic use. The gene or genes for producing an exogenous protein are placed on a plasmid under the control of the lac promoter. Initially the cells are grown in a medium that does not contain lactose or other sugars, so the new genes are not expressed. Once the cells reach a certain point in their growth, Isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) is added. IPTG, a molecule similar to lactose, but with a sulfur bond that is not hydrolyzable so that E. Coli does not digest it, is used to activate or \"induce\" the production of the new protein. Once the cells are induced, it is difficult to remove IPTG from the cells and therefore it is difficult to stop expression.\n\nAn early example of a synthetic biological circuit was published in Nature in 2000 by Tim Gardner, Charles Cantor, and Jim Collins working at Boston University. They were able to create a \"bistable\" switch in E. Coli. The switch is turned on by heating the culture of bacteria and turned off by addition of IPTG. They used GFP as a reporter for their system.\n\nCurrently, synthetic circuits are a burgeoning area of research in systems biology with more publications detailing synthetic biological circuits published every year. There has been significant interest in encouraging education and outreach as well: the International Genetically Engineered Machines Competition manages the creation and standardization of BioBrick parts as a means to allow undergraduate and high school students to design their own synthetic biological circuits.\n\nBoth immediate and long term applications exist for the use of synthetic biological circuits, including different applications for metabolic engineering, and synthetic biology. Those demonstrated successfully include pharmaceutical production, and fuel production. However methods involving direct genetic introduction are not inherently effective without invoking the basic principles of synthetic cellular circuits. For example, each of these successful systems employs a method to introduce all-or-none induction or expression. This is a biological circuit where a simple repressor or promoter is introduced to facilitate creation of the product, or inhibition of a competing pathway. However, with the limited understanding of cellular networks and natural circuitry, implementation of more robust schemes with more precise control and feedback is hindered. Therein lies the immediate interest in synthetic cellular circuits.\n\nDevelopment in understanding cellular circuitry can lead to exciting new modifications, such as cells which can respond to environmental stimuli. For example, cells could be developed that signal toxic surroundings and react by activating pathways used to degrade the perceived toxin. To develop such a cell, it is necessary to create a complex synthetic cellular circuit which can respond appropriately to a given stimulus.\n\nGiven synthetic cellular circuits represent a form of control for cellular activities, it can be reasoned that with complete understanding of cellular pathways, \"plug and play\" cells with well defined genetic circuitry can be engineered. It is widely believed that if a proper toolbox of parts is generated, synthetic cells can be developed implementing only the pathways necessary for cell survival reproduction. From this cell, to be thought of as a minimal genome cell, one can add pieces from the toolbox to create a well defined pathway with appropriate synthetic circuitry for an effective feedback system. Because of the basic ground up construction method, and the proposed database of mapped circuitry pieces, techniques mirroring those used to model computer or electronic circuits can be used to redesign cells and model cells for easy troubleshooting and predictive behavior and yields.\n\nList of currently published circuits:\n\nEngineered systems are the result of implementation of combinations of different logical control mechanisms. Gardner et al. used a cascading response of multiple control units to create an implementation of a toggle switch capable of controlling metabolism by a stepwise function. Elowitz et al. and Fung et al. created oscillatory circuits that use multiple self-regulating mechanisms to create a time-dependent oscillation of gene product expression. A limited counting mechanism was implemented by a pulse-controlled gene cascade and application of logic elements enables genetic \"programming\" of cells as in the research of Tabor et al., which synthesized a photosensitive bacterial edge detection program.\n\nRecent developments in artificial gene synthesis and the corresponding increase in competition within the industry have led to a significant drop in price and wait time of gene synthesis and helped improve methods used in circuit design. At the moment, circuit design is improving at a slow pace because of insufficient organization of known multiple gene interactions and mathematical models. This issue is being addressed by applying computer-aided design (CAD) software to provide multimedia representations of circuits through images, text and programming language applied to biological circuits. Some of the more well known CAD programs include GenoCAD, Clotho framework and j5. GenoCAD uses grammars, which are either opensource or user generated \"rules\" which include the available genes and known gene interactions for cloning organisms. Clotho framework uses the Biobrick standard rules.\n\n"}

{"id": "27698024", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27698024", "title": "Tich Gwilym", "text": "Tich Gwilym\n\nTich Gwilym (10 September 1950 – 19 June 2005), born Robert Gwilliam, was a Welsh rock guitarist who was most notable for his Hendrix inspired version of the Welsh national anthem, \"Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau\", considered one of the most famous renditions of the song.\n\nTich was born in Llwynypia, in the Rhondda Valley on 10 September 1950. One of Tich's earliest bands was Kimla Taz, who he played with during the late 1960s. Although the band never gained any mainstream success, they were popular in South Wales and in 1969 played at the Croeso '69 Blues Festival at Abergavenny, alongside the likes of Fleetwood Mac and Jethro Tull.\n\nTich found fame in the 1970s, when as part of Geraint Jarman a'r Cynganeddwyr, he recorded the Welsh national anthem on the electric guitar. The Jimi Hendrix inspired version, which first appeared on Jarman's 1978 album also called \"Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau\", became synonymous with Tich and has appeared on compilation albums of Welsh artists. In 2006, an eight track recording of the Welsh national anthem was 'discovered' in London. At the time it was alleged that this was a lost version by Hendrix, though others claimed that it was a rendition by Tich. When approached, ex-band member Gerarint Jarman dismissed both claims, stating that 'It's definitely not Tich because his style was more like Hendrix's than the actual tape'. It was later discovered that the version was a hoax, perpetrated by record producer Martin Davies and ex-guitarist of The Vibrators, John Ellis.\n\nIn 1989, Tich formed the Superclarkes with Burke Shelley of Welsh band Budgie. Burke played guitar and Peter Morgan played bass in the Superclarkes. The band lasted until 1993 when Morgan moved to the USA. In the 1990s Tich also played alongside Welsh folk singer Siân James, joining her on a tour of Japan in 1998.\n\nIn 2005, Tich was staying in a house in Canton in Cardiff. A fire broke out, after an unattended candle lit by the owner accidentally set clothes alight. Tich became trapped in the attic and was overcome by thick smoke and poisonous gases. An inquest into the fire in 2006 recorded a verdict of accidental death. A memorial concert was held for Tich at the Coal Exchange in Cardiff, and featured Welsh acts such as Man and Racing Cars.\n"}

It was released after \"Petz 5\", and is therefore part of the second Petz series. Players take on the roles of Enzo and Anna, two young animal trainers who travel the world, training animals to earn money for their family company.\n\nTigerz is also known as Petz Wild Animals: Tigerz in North America or Tigerz: Circus Adventures in Europe (outside the UK).\n\nThe game starts when Enzo and Anna, two young animal trainers, are given two tigers by their grandfather. In order to save their family company of animal trainers from bankruptcy, they travel the world, training several show animals, to earn money.\n\nThe player's goal in the game is to train show animals, and care for the pair of tigers that have been given to the player. By use of the touchscreen and the built-in microphone, players can touch and talk to the animals to interact with them. The key part to the training is a combination of leading the animals in doing the tricks, and finding out what distracts the animals, to help them concentrate.\n\nBesides the animal training, there is a bit of strategy that comes into play with running the animal training agency. Some people the player meet could use bad training methods with their animals or wish the player's training agency to close.\n\nEventually, the player works towards their own animal reserve step by step that will be able to help endangered animals all around the world.\n\nThere are 8 main missions, in which the player trains certain animals around the world, that are in trouble.\n\n"}

In other words, a transhuman is a being that resembles a human in most respects but who has powers and abilities beyond those of standard humans. These abilities might include improved intelligence, awareness, strength, or durability. Transhumans sometimes appear in science-fiction as cyborgs or genetically-enhanced humans.\n\nThe use of the term \"transhuman\" goes back to French philosopher Pierre Teilhard de Chardin, who wrote in his 1949 book \"The Future of Mankind\":\n\nAnd in a 1951 unpublished revision of the same book:\n\nIn 1957 book \"New Bottles for New Wine\", English evolutionary biologist Julian Huxley wrote:\n\nOne of the first professors of futurology, FM-2030, who taught \"new concepts of the Human\" at The New School of New York City in the 1960s, used \"transhuman\" as shorthand for \"transitional human\". Calling transhumans the \"earliest manifestation of new evolutionary beings\", FM argued that signs of transhumans included physical and mental augmentations including prostheses, reconstructive surgery, intensive use of telecommunications, a cosmopolitan outlook and a globetrotting lifestyle, androgyny, mediated reproduction (such as in vitro fertilisation), absence of religious beliefs, and a rejection of traditional family values.\n\nFM-2030 used the concept of transhuman as an evolutionary transition, outside the confines of academia, in his contributing final chapter to the 1972 anthology \"Woman, Year 2000\". In the same year, American cryonics pioneer Robert Ettinger contributed to conceptualization of \"transhumanity\" in his book \"Man into Superman\". In 1982, American Natasha Vita-More authored a statement titled \"Transhumanist Arts Statement\" and outlined what she perceived as an emerging transhuman culture.\n\nJacques Attali, writing in 2006, envisaged transhumans as an altruistic vanguard of the later 21st century:\nVanguard players (I shall call them \"transhumans\") will run (they are already running) \"relational enterprises\" in which profit will be no more than a hindrance, not a final goal. Each of these transhumans will be altruistic, a citizen of the planet, at once nomadic and sedentary, his neighbor's equal in rights and obligations, hospitable and respectful of the world. Together, transhumans will give birth to planetary institutions and change the course of industrial enterprises.\nIn March 2007, American physicist Gregory Cochran and paleoanthropologist John Hawks published a study, alongside other recent research on which it builds, which amounts to a radical reappraisal of traditional views, which tended to assume that humans have reached an evolutionary endpoint. Physical anthropologist Jeffrey McKee argued the new findings of accelerated evolution bear out predictions he made in a 2000 book \"The Riddled Chain\". Based on computer models, he argued that evolution should speed up as a population grows because population growth creates more opportunities for new mutations; and the expanded population occupies new environmental niches, which would drive evolution in new directions. Whatever the implications of the recent findings, McKee concludes that they highlight a ubiquitous point about evolution: \"every species is a transitional species\".\n\n"}

Gagarin State Scientific Research-and-Testing Cosmonaut Training Center (GCTC; Russian: Центр подготовки космонавтов имени Ю. А. Гагарина) is a Russian training facility responsible for training cosmonauts for their space missions. It is in Star City of Moscow Oblast, a name which may refer to the facility itself or to its grounds.\n\nThe facility was originally known only as Military Unit 26266 or в/ч 26266, and was a secret training base for Soviet Cosmonaut candidates. The site was chosen for its proximity to Moscow and other infrastructure that would be essential for its function: Chkalovsky Airbase, and the Yaroslavl railroad. The densely forested area was originally a radar range with some existing infrastructure.\n\nMilitary physician Colonel Yevgeny Karpov was appointed as the first chief of the cosmonaut training centre or \"Tsentr Podgotovki Kosmonavtov\" (TsPK) on February 24, 1960. The centre was home to approximately 250 personnel divided into various departments who were responsible for the development of all aspects of the space program ranging from equipment to the well being of the cosmonauts. These included specialists in heat exchange and hygiene, survival clothing, surgery, and training staff. Initially cosmonaut candidates were housed at the nearby Frunze Central Airfield (Moscow), followed by an apartment block in Chkalovsky before eventually moving to the newly built apartments on site where they would remain with their families throughout training.\n\nUntil April 2009 the center was owned and operated by the Russian Ministry of Defense in cooperation with Russian Federal Space Agency. On April 2009, Russia President Dmitry Medvedev signed a presidential decree transferring the center from the Defence Ministry to the Russian Federal Space Agency (Roskosmos)\n\nThe Cosmonaut Training Center was inaugurated on January 11, 1960 in Star City outside Moscow. \nIn 1969 it was named after Yuri Gagarin, the first man to fly in space. In 1995 the Cosmonaut Training Center and Air Force Test and Training regiment were merged and reorganized into its current form.\n\nThe facility contains infrastructure essential for the training of cosmonauts across a wide range of experiences, including simulating g-loads, mission specific/suit training, medical observation/testing and astronavigation.\n\nKey GCTC facilities include:\n\n"}
