In Western art, graphic depictions of the Passion of Christ have long been portrayed, as have a wide range of depictions of warfare by later painters and graphic artists. Theater and, in modern times, cinema have often featured battles and violent crimes, while images and descriptions of violence have always been a part of literature. Margaret Bruder states that the aestheticization of violence in film is the depiction of violence in a \"stylistically excessive\", \"significant and sustained way\" in which audience members are able to connect references from the \"play of images and signs\" to artworks, genre conventions, cultural symbols, or concepts.\n\nHigh culture forms such as fine art and literature have aestheticized violence into a form of autonomous art. In 1991, University of Georgia literature professor Joel Black stated that \"(if) any human act evokes the aesthetic experience of the sublime, certainly it is the act of murder\". Black notes that \"...if murder can be experienced aesthetically, the murderer can in turn be regarded as a kind of artist—a performance artist or anti-artist whose specialty is not creation but destruction\" (1991: 14). This conception of an aesthetic element of murder has a long history; in the 19th century, Thomas de Quincey wrote that \n\"Everything in this world has two handles. Murder, for instance, may be laid hold of by its moral handle... and that, I confess, is its weak side; or it may also be treated aesthetically, as the Germans call it—that is, in relation to good taste.\"\n\nIn addition to high culture aestheticizations of violence, mass media forms such as newspaper and television news reporting have produced sensationalized reports on crime and warfare. Maria Tatar's book \"Lustmord: Sexual Murder in Weimar Germany\" analyzes murders in pre-Hitler Germany and their artistic representations, investigating \"the chilling motives behind representations that aestheticize violence, and that turn the mutilated female body into an object of fascination\".\nLilie Chouliaraki's article, \"The aestheticization of suffering on television\" (2006), analyzes \"an example of war footage in order to trace the ways in which the tension between presenting airwar as an 'objective' piece of news and as an instance of intense human suffering is resolved in television's strategies of mediation\". For example, Chouliaraki argues that the \"bombardment of Baghdad in 2003 during the Iraq war was filmed in long-shot and presented in a quasiliterary narrative that capitalized on an aesthetics of horror, on sublime spectacle (Boltanski). She says that the \"aestheticization of suffering on television is thus produced by a visual and linguistic complex that eliminates the human pain aspect of suffering, whilst retaining the phantasmagoric effects of a tableau vivant\", producing an \"aestheticization of suffering [that] manages simultaneously to preserve an aura of objectivity and impartiality, and to take a pro-war side in the war footage\".\n\nA number of filmmakers from the 20th century have used aestheticized depictions of violence. According to James Fox, filmmaker Donald Cammell \"...looked upon violence as an artist might look on paint. [He asked:] What are its components? What's its nature? Its glamour?\"\nThomas Harris created a fictional character called Hannibal Lecter, a cannibal and aesthete killer. In the films adapted from his work, \"The Silence of the Lambs\" (1991) and \"Hannibal\" (2001), directors Jonathan Demme and Ridley Scott, respectively intentionally generate excitement and anticipation when Lecter is about to kill (and eat) a victim. Lecter was portrayed by Anthony Hopkins. In David Lynch's \"Blue Velvet\" (1986), the villain of the film, Frank Booth, is an excessively violent man who obsesses over small fetishes (such as blue velvet) when he is attacking and raping his victims; his obsessions help him achieve orgasm.\n\nIn the film \"Man on Fire,\" which tells the story of a burnt-out former Black Ops agent who seeks to avenge the kidnappers of a young girl he was bodyguarding, a character says that the agent is an \"artist\" in killing. He says the man is about to \"paint his masterpiece\" as he seeks out and kills all of the members of the criminal organization who were connected with the child abduction.\n\nIn Xavier Morales' review of Quentin Tarantino's \"\", entitled \"Beauty and violence\", he calls the film \"a groundbreaking aestheticization of violence\". Morales says that the film, which he calls \"easily one of the most violent movies ever made\", \"a breathtaking landscape in which art and violence coalesce into one unforgettable aesthetic experience\".\n\nMorales argues that \"... Tarantino manages to do precisely what Alex de Large was trying to do in Stanley Kubrick's \"A Clockwork Orange:\" he presents violence as a form of expressive art...[in which the]...violence is so physically graceful, visually dazzling and meticulously executed that our instinctual, emotional responses undermine any rational objections we may have. Tarantino is able to transform an object of moral outrage into one of aesthetic beauty...[, in which,]...like all art forms, the violence serves a communicative purpose apart from its aesthetic value\". When the female sword-wielding protagonist \"...skillfully slices and dices her way through...[the opposing fighters]...we get a sense that she is using them as a kind of canvas for her expression of revenge...[,]...like an artist who expresses herself through brush and paint...[she]...expresses herself through sword and blood\".\n\nFilm critics analyzing violent film images that seek to aesthetically please the viewer mainly fall into two categories. Critics who see depictions of violence in film as superficial and exploitative argue that it leads audience members to become desensitized to brutality, thus increasing their aggression. On the other hand, critics who view violence as a type of content, or as a theme, claim it is cathartic and provides \"acceptable outlets for anti-social impulses\".\n\nAdrian Martin argues that critics who hold violent cinema in high regard have developed a response to anti-violence advocates, \"those who decry everything from \"Taxi Driver\" to \"Terminator 2\" as dehumanising, desensitising cultural influences\". Martin claims that critics who value aestheticized violence defend shocking depictions onscreen on the grounds that \"screen violence is not real violence, and should never be confused with it\". He claims that their rebuttal also claims that \"movie violence is fun, spectacle, make-believe; it's dramatic metaphor, or a necessary catharsis akin to that provided by Jacobean theatre; it's generic, pure sensation, pure fantasy. It has its own changing history, its codes, its precise aesthetic uses.\"\n\nMargaret Bruder, a film studies professor at Indiana University and the author of \"Aestheticizing Violence, or How To Do Things with Style,\" proposes that there is a distinction between aestheticized violence and the use of gore and blood in mass market action or war films. She argues that \"aestheticized violence is not merely the excessive use of violence in a film\". Movies such as the popular action film \"Die Hard 2\" are very violent, but they do \"not fall into the category of aestheticized violence because it is not stylistically excessive in a significant and sustained way\".\n\nBut Bruder classifies films as using \"stylized [e.g. aestheticized] violence if they \"revel in guns, gore and explosions, exploiting mise-en-scene not so much to provide narrative environment as to create the appearance of a 'movie' atmosphere against which specifically cinematic spectacle can unfold\". In movies with aestheticized violence, she argues that the \"standard realist modes of editing and cinematography are violated in order to spectacularize the action being played out on the screen\"; directors use \"quick and awkward editing\", \"canted framings\", shock cuts, and slow motion, to emphasize the impacts of bullets or the \"spurting of blood\".\n\nFor viewers of films with aestheticized violence, such as John Woo's movies, she claims that \"One of the many pleasures\" from watching Woo's films, such as \"Hard Target\" is that it gets viewers to recognize how Woo plays with conventions \"from other Woo films\" and how it \"connects up with films...which include imitations of or homages to Woo\". Bruder argues that films with aestheticized violence such as \"\"Hard Target\", \"True Romance\" and \"Tombstone\" are [filled] with... signs\" and indicators, so that \"the stylized violence they contain ultimately serves as...another interruption in the narrative drive\" of the film.\n\nWriting in \"The New York Times\", Dwight Garner reviews the controversy and moral panic surrounding the 1991 novel and 2000 film \"American Psycho\", which concerns Patrick Bateman, \"an Exeter and Harvard grad, a gourmand, a tanning enthusiast and a ruthless fashion critic\" who is also a serial killer. Garner concludes that the film was a \"coal-black satire\" in which \"dire comedy mixes with Grand Guignol. There's demented opera in some of its scenes.\" The book, meanwhile, has acquired \"grudging respect\" and is \"seen as a transgressive bag of broken glass that can be talked about alongside plasma-soaked trips like Anthony Burgess's \"A Clockwork Orange\"\".\n\nGarner claims that the novel's author, Bret Easton Ellis, \"was racing ahead of the culture\" and that his book \"was ahead of its time\": \"The culture has shifted to make room for Bateman. We've developed a taste for barbaric libertines with twinkling eyes and some zing in their tortured souls. Tony Soprano, Walter White from \"\"Breaking Bad\", Hannibal Lecter (who predates \"American Psycho\"\")—here are the most significant pop culture characters of the past 30 years... Thanks to these characters, and to first-person shooter video games, we’ve learned to identify with the bearer of violence and not just cower before him or her.\"\n\nPlato proposed to ban poets from his ideal republic because he feared that their aesthetic ability to construct attractive narratives about immoral behaviour would corrupt young minds. Plato's writings refer to poetry as a kind of rhetoric, whose \"...influence is pervasive and often harmful\". Plato believed that poetry that was \"unregulated by philosophy is a danger to soul and community\". He warned that tragic poetry can produce \"a disordered psychic regime or constitution\" by inducing \"a dream-like, uncritical state in which we lose ourselves in ...sorrow, grief, anger, [and] resentment\". As such, Plato was in effect arguing that \"What goes on in the theater, in your home, in your fantasy life, are connected\" to what one does in real life.\n\nAristotle, though, advocated a useful role for music, drama, and tragedy: a way for people to purge their negative emotions. Aristotle mentions catharsis at the end of his \"Politics\", where he notes that after people listen to music that elicits pity and fear, they \"are liable to become possessed\" by these negative emotions. However, afterwards, Aristotle points out that these people return to \"a normal condition as if they had been medically treated and undergone a purge [catharsis] ... All experience a certain purge [catharsis] and pleasant relief. In the same manner cathartic melodies give innocent joy to men\" (from \"Politics\" VIII:7; 1341b 35-1342a 8).\n\nThe artist Hieronymus Bosch, from the 15th and 16th centuries, used images of demons, half-human animals and machines to evoke fear and confusion to portray the evil of man. The 16th-century artist Pieter Brueghel the Elder depicted \"...the nightmarish imagery that reflect, if in an extreme fashion, popular dread of the Apocalypse and Hell\".\nMathis Gothart-Neithart, a German artist known as \"Grünewald\" (1480–1528) depicted \"intense emotion, especially painful emotion\". His painting of the Crucifixion \"...does not spare the beholder. Grünewald relentlessly brings out all the marks of terrible suffering and agony, induced by the cruelty and torture of the executioners...[vividly conveying] a sense of horror and pain\".\nGrünewald's 'Isenheim Altarpiece' also shows a violent image of Jesus on the cross, \"with his body covered in wounds\", with the focus on \"... Jesus' suffering and his death\".\n\nIn the mid-18th century, Giovanni Battista Piranesi, an Italian etcher, archaeologist and architect active from 1740, did imaginary etchings of prisons that depicted people \"stretched on racks or trapped like rats in maze-like dungeons\", an \"aestheticization of violence and suffering\".\nIn 1849, as revolutions raged in European streets and authorities were putting down protests and consolidating state powers, composer Richard Wagner wrote: \"I have an enormous desire to practice a little artistic terrorism.\"\n\nLaurent Tailhade is reputed to have stated, after Auguste Vaillant bombed the Chamber of Deputies in 1893: \" [What do the victims matter, so long as the gesture is beautiful].\" In 1929 André Breton's Second Manifesto on surrealist art stated that \"\" [The simplest Surrealist act consists of running down into the street, pistols in hand, and firing blindly, as fast as you can pull the trigger, into the crowd].\"\n\nFrench postmodernist theorist Jean Baudrillard argues that whereas modern societies were \"...organized around the production and consumption of commodities\", \"postmodern societies are organized around simulation and the play of images and signs\". As such, in \"...the postmodern media and consumer society, everything becomes an image, a sign, a spectacle\". For Baudrillard, the West's \"commercialization of the whole world...will turn out rather to have been the aestheticization of the whole world—its cosmopolitan spectacularization, its transformation into images, its semiological organization\". As a result, the \"previously separate domains of the economy, art, politics, and sexuality\" become \"collapsed into each other\", and art penetrates \"all spheres of existence.\" Thus, Baudrillard argues that \"[o]ur society has given rise to a general aestheticization: all forms of culture—not excluding anti-cultural ones—are promoted and all models of representation and anti-representation are taken on board\".\n\nWhen a person views an isolated painting, photograph or cartoon, they are viewing a static image. If a photographer takes a still photo of a police officer's struggle to arrest a young man, for example, the denotative meaning might be \"there was a man dressed as a police officer placing his hand on the shoulder of another man of a certain age whilst a photographer took a picture\". On the other hand, the connotative meanings might range from, \"law enforcement in action\" to \"a heroic fight to subdue a dangerous terrorist about to release sarin gas\", to \"police use excessive force to arrest non-violent protesters\", to \"fancy dress party ends badly\". The attribution of the specific subtext is left to the caption writer, the text accompanying the photo, and the audience.\n\nCritic Susan Sontag argued that, through repeated exposure, certain well-known photographs have become \"ethical reference points\", such as the many images depicting the victims and liberation of the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp (1977). From this perspective, the subtext of such images, though still connotatively open to interpretation, has been somewhat restrained by familiarity, predominant cultural beliefs regarding the Holocaust, and perhaps by overusage.\n\nIf there is a motion picture or video recording of the previously described scenario of a police officer arresting a man, the filmmakers, videographers, and editors may reframe this scene, by fragmenting the recording, depicting it from different vantage points, editing the material, and reassembling these components. A film editor can produce a non-realistic sequence of intercut, edited images, which forces the audience to interpret those images according to a different set of semiotic rules. Even without editing or alteration, a film or video recordings' \"mise en scène\" and non-verbal signs become much more explicit and enable the audience to attribute meaning to the scenario.\nThe value of this video as a signifier will be determined by its relation to the other signifiers in the system. Thus, if the video is included in a reputable television news program, it will acquire a greater claim to be indexical and its status is more likely to be considered reliable \"evidence\" of real world events. In semiotic terms, the words spoken by the television presenter will be symbolic, and the images will have both iconic and indexical qualities.\n\nThe \"semiotic value\" of the video will change if it is transposed into a polemical or satirical programme, presented by a commentator, or screened with on-screen captions (e.g., \"Crime Wave in the Streets\", or \"Protesters Brutalized by Police\"). These substitute contexts form modality indicators that may help the viewer to assess the plausibility, credibility, or truthfulness of the content. The violence shown on-screen can be aestheticized by the values of the symbolical signs used by the news presenter, by captions placed on-screen, or by the relations with other signifiers in the same programme (e.g., if the arrest video is preceded by a report about \"antisocial and criminal behaviour\").\n\nIf a film or television director staged a similar fictional scene, the audience will be predisposed to consider it less \"real\". They know that the scenario is being filtered through the film maker's sensibilities and the outcome will reflect the director's motives. Hence, the lighting, makeup, costumes, acting methods, cutting, and soundtrack music selection are understood to be combined to inform the audience about the film maker's intentions.\n\nThe culture industry's mass-produced texts and images about crime, violence, and war have been consolidated into genres. Film makers typically choose from a predictable range of narrative conventions and use stereotyped characters, and clichéd symbols and metaphors. Over time, certain styles and conventions of filming and editing are standardised within a medium or a genre. Some conventions tend to naturalise the content and make it seem more real. Other methods deliberately breach convention to create an effect, such as the canted angles, rapid edits, and slow motion shots used in films with aestheticized violence.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "729812", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=729812", "title": "Amaurosis fugax", "text": "Amaurosis fugax\n\nAmaurosis fugax (Latin \"fugax\" meaning \"fleeting\", Greek \"amaurosis\" meaning \"darkening\", \"dark\", or \"obscure\") is a painless temporary loss of vision in one or both eyes.\n\nThe experience of amaurosis fugax is classically described as a temporary loss of vision in one or both eyes that appears as a black \"curtain coming down vertically into the field of vision in one eye;\" however, this altitudinal visual loss is relatively uncommon. In one study, only 23.8 percent of patients with transient monocular vision loss experienced the classic \"curtain\" or \"shade\" descending over their vision. Other descriptions of this experience include a monocular blindness, dimming, fogging, or blurring. Total or sectorial vision loss typically lasts only a few seconds, but may last minutes or even hours. Duration depends on the cause of the vision loss. Obscured vision due to papilledema may last only seconds, while a severely atherosclerotic carotid artery may be associated with a duration of one to ten minutes. Certainly, additional symptoms may be present with the amaurosis fugax, and those findings will depend on the cause of the transient monocular vision loss.\n\nPrior to 1990, amaurosis fugax could, \"clinically, be divided into four identifiable symptom complexes, each with its underlying pathoetiology: embolic, hypoperfusion, angiospasm, and unknown\". In 1990, the causes of amaurosis fugax were better refined by the Amaurosis Fugax Study Group, which has defined five distinct classes of transient monocular blindness based on their supposed cause: embolic, hemodynamic, ocular, neurologic, and idiopathic (or \"no cause identified\") Concerning the pathology underlying these causes (except idiopathic), \"some of the more frequent causes include atheromatous disease of the internal carotid or ophthalmic artery, vasospasm, optic neuropathies, giant cell arteritis, angle-closure glaucoma, increased intracranial pressure, orbital compressive disease, a steal phenomenon, and blood hyperviscosity or hypercoagulability.\"\n\nWith respect to embolic and hemodynamic causes, this transient monocular visual loss ultimately occurs due to a temporary reduction in retinal artery, ophthalmic artery, or ciliary artery blood flow, leading to a decrease in retinal circulation which, in turn, causes retinal hypoxia. While, most commonly, emboli causing amaurosis fugax are described as coming from an atherosclerotic carotid artery, any emboli arising from vasculature preceding the retinal artery, ophthalmic artery, or ciliary arteries may cause this transient monocular blindness.\n\n\nOcular causes include:\n\nNeurological causes include:\n\nDespite the temporary nature of the vision loss, those experiencing amaurosis fugax are usually advised to consult a physician immediately as it is a symptom that may herald serious vascular events, including stroke. Restated, “because of the brief interval between the transient event and a stroke or blindness from temporal arteritis, the workup for transient monocular blindness should be undertaken without delay.” If the patient has no history of giant cell arteritis, the probability of vision preservation is high; however, the chance of a stroke reaches that for a hemispheric TIA. Therefore, investigation of cardiac disease is justified.\n\nA diagnostic evaluation should begin with the patient's history, followed by a physical exam, with particular importance being paid to the ophthalmic examination with regards to signs of ocular ischemia. When investigating amaurosis fugax, an ophthalmologic consult is absolutely warranted if available. Several concomitant laboratory tests should also be ordered to investigate some of the more common, systemic causes listed above, including a complete blood count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, lipid panel, and blood glucose level. If a particular cause is suspected based on the history and physical, additional relevant labs should be ordered.\n\nIf laboratory tests are abnormal, a systemic disease process is likely, and, if the ophthalmologic examination is abnormal, ocular disease is likely. However, in the event that both of these routes of investigation yield normal findings or an inadequate explanation, noninvasive duplex ultrasound studies are recommended to identify carotid artery disease. Most episodes of amaurosis fugax are the result of stenosis of the ipsilateral carotid artery. With that being the case, researchers investigated how best to evaluate these episodes of vision loss, and concluded that for patients ranging from 36–74 years old, \"...carotid artery duplex scanning should be performed...as this investigation is more likely to provide useful information than an extensive cardiac screening (ECG, Holter 24-hour monitoring, and precordial echocardiography).\" Additionally, concomitant head CT or MRI imaging is also recommended to investigate the presence of a “clinically silent cerebral embolism.”\n\nIf the results of the ultrasound and intracranial imaging are normal, “renewed diagnostic efforts may be made,” during which fluorescein angiography is an appropriate consideration. However, carotid angiography is not advisable in the presence of a normal ultrasound and CT.\n\nIf the diagnostic workup reveals a systemic disease process, directed therapies to treat that underlying cause should be initiated. If the amaurosis fugax is caused by an atherosclerotic lesion, aspirin is indicated, and a carotid endarterectomy considered based on the location and grade of the stenosis. Generally, if the carotid artery is still patent, the greater the stenosis, the greater the indication for endarterectomy. \"Amaurosis fugax appears to be a particularly favorable indication for carotid endarterectomy. Left untreated, this event carries a high risk of stroke; after carotid endarterectomy, which has a low operative risk, there is a very low postoperative stroke rate.\" However, the rate of subsequent stroke after amaurosis is significantly less than after a hemispheric TIA, therefore there remains debate as to the precise indications for which a carotid endarterectomy should be performed. If the full diagnostic workup is completely normal, patient observation is recommended.\n\n"}

Influenced by house music, Detroit techno, and disco, she released several recordings on the independent dance music label 100% Silk, including \"Queen of Cups\", \"Far Away So Close\", and \"Memory of Water\", reissued in 2017. KQED named Cherushii's album \"Meow Wolf’s Arcade Soundtracks: Wiggy’s Plasma Plex\" one of the 10 best Bay Area albums of 2016. While Cherushii has received little recognition from mainstream media, her music is of enormous influence in the underground music scene. Fellow electronic musician Maria Minerva has called Cherushii \"criminally underrated\".\n\nDolan was one of 36 victims of a fire that broke out at an underground venue and artist collective in Oakland, California commonly referred to as the Ghost Ship warehouse on December 2, 2016.\n\nCherushii was born Chelsea Faith Dolan on September 14, 1983. She grew up in Marin County, California and began playing music around the age of 6, when she was gifted a Casio keyboard. She was classically trained at the San Francisco Conservatory of Music as a teenager. After years of written correspondence with Japanese pen pals Chelsea traveled to Japan, where she adopted the moniker Cherushii because it was easier to pronounce than her name. Her introduction to electronic music at raves in the early 2000s set the path for her career as an electronic musician. Cherushii was a champion of women in electronic music and recognized their contributions as a source of influence in a field that often lacks recognition for women. In an interview with Chicago's Reader about the influence of Detroit DJ and producer Kelli Hand (aka K-Hand) Cherushii said \"I deeply admire her for all the work she's done, and yet her lack of recognition is so discouraging. In a culture as supposedly forward-thinking as electronic music, women are still so often invisible.\"\nFrom January 2014 to December 2016 Cherushii was host of radio shows on UC Berkeley's community radio station KALX, where she devoted sets to Italo Disco, Detroit techno, or contemporaries in the local electronic music scene such as David Last and Roche. In August 2015 Cherushii co-founded a dance music night called \"Run the Length of Your Wildness\" to provide a space for local electronic musicians to showcase their music.\n\nCherushii was scheduled to perform at the Ghost Ship warehouse on December 2, 2016 as part of fellow music producer Golden Donna's (Joel Shanahan) tour. At approximately 11:20 pm a fire started inside the warehouse, trapping attendees inside. The Alameda County Coroner's Bureau confirmed 36 people trapped inside, including Cherushii, died of smoke inhalation. A public memorial was held on December 17, 2016 at Public Works in San Francisco.\n\nIn 2013 Cherushii signed with 100% Silk and released \"Queen of Cups\", a four track album described as an \"expansive blueprint of slow-burn deep house but threads it through with waves of synth wash, acid flash, and simmering strobe glow, for a loose yet composed suite of 21st-century free-spirit pulse generation.\" In 2015 Cherushii released \"Starlight Express\", \"Nobody's Fool\", and \"Far Away So Close\", 3 EPs. In 2016 Cherushii released \"Manic\". \nAfter Cherushii's death 100% Silk released a memorial edition tape of \"Memory of Water\", previously out of print.\n\nCherushii opted for hardware analog gear at a time when laptops were transforming electronic music production and was known to carry heavy suitcases full of equipment to her shows. She used a Yamaha RS7000 before advancing onto the Elektron Octatrack of which she was quoted as saying: \"Like most Elektron gear, learning to play it is an ongoing journey that you definitely won't complete in the first few months. But its ability to sequence both audio and MIDI makes it a great machine for live sets, and you can't beat its compact size for travel.\" Cherushii also used the compact Access Virus TI,a digital multitimbral polyphonic synth. Among her gear was also a hand built and highly modified X0xb0x (analog Roland TB-303 hardware clone), which she received as a gift from fellow musicians.\n\nAlbums: \nSingles and EPs:\n"}

It became recurrent in debates on the topic of evolution between creationists and proponents of science, being used as a symbol directed at those who do not understand the basic principles of evolution.\n\nThe concept of a crocoduck was used by young-Earth creationists and certain other creationists to claim that the absence of any half-crocodile, half-duck creature disproves evolution, an argument that quickly became a meme used to ridicule a common misrepresentation of the theory of evolution, namely, that the theory predicts forms intermediate between any two currently living organisms.\n\nIn 2007 young-Earth creationists Kirk Cameron and Ray Comfort participated in a televised debate, parts of which were aired on \"ABC Nightline\", on the existence of God. Kirk Cameron held up composite pictures of what \"we imagined would be genuine species-to-species transitional forms. They called one a 'crocoduck' and another was called a 'birddog'.\" The \"crocoduck\" was an animal with the head of a crocodile and the body of a duck, the \"bullfrog\" was an animal with the head of a bull and the body of a frog, and the \"sheepdog\" was an animal with the head of a dog and the body of a sheep. These pictures were used as a straw man argument to ridicule the theory of evolution as represented by Cameron and Comfort.\n\nThis claim was widely publicized and ridiculed as an example of creationist misconceptions. In \"\", the evolutionary scientist Richard Dawkins included a section titled 'Show me your crocoduck!' in which he compared this to the question put by another creationist as to why there was no transitional fossil \"fronkey\" between frogs and monkeys, and described it as a warped misunderstanding of evolution. Modern species share a common ancestor, but are neither descended from each other nor from some crude composite chimera, and ducks are not descended from crocodiles. An illustration shows the Crocoduck Tie, designed by web designer Josh Timonen in commemoration of this misconception. Dawkins has stated that \"There are only two in existence. PZ Myers has one. I'm proud to say I have the other.\" Dawkins' tie made a prominent appearance on an episode of \"The Colbert Report\".\n\nIn 2003, new fossils of several types of ancient crocodile were found, including one with a flat broad snout reminiscent of a duck's bill, though it has teeth and is obviously crocodilian rather than bird-like. This genus has been named \"Anatosuchus\" or \"DuckCroc\", and it had an upright stance rather than the sprawled legs of modern crocodiles. Pelagornithid seabirds are also compared to aquatic crocodilians and are in fact recovered as stem-waterfowl, rendering them literal crocoducks.\n\nThe most recent common ancestor of duck and crocodiles is the base of the Archosauria clade, and was probably superficially similar to modern crocodiles. No fossil of this common ancestor are known to exist, but groups such as Phytosauria and Proterochampsia are near to the base of the archosaur clade.

The result might look like an avatar behaving, reacting, and thinking like a person on the basis of that person's digital archive. After the death of the individual, this avatar could remain static or continue to learn and develop autonomously.\n\nA considerable portion of transhumanists and singularitarians place great hope into the belief that they may become immortal by the year 2045, by creating one or many non-biological functional copies of their brains, thereby leaving their \"biological shell\". These copies may then \"live eternally\" in a version of digital \"heaven\" or paradise.\n\nThe National Science Foundation has awarded a half-million-dollar grant to the universities of Central Florida at Orlando and Illinois at Chicago to explore how researchers might use artificial intelligence, archiving, and computer imaging to create convincing, digital versions of real people, a possible first step toward virtual immortality.\n\nThe Digital Immortality Institute explores three factors necessary for digital immortality. First, at whatever level of implementation, avatars require guaranteed Internet accessibility. Next, avatars must be what users specify, and they must remain so. Finally, future representations must be secured before the living users are no more.\n\nThe aim of Dmitry Itskov's 2045 Initiative is to \"create technologies enabling the transfer of an individual’s personality to a non-biological carrier, and extending existence, including to the point of immortality\".\n\nReaching digital immortality is a two-step process:\n\nAccording to Gordon Bell and Jim Gray from Microsoft Research, retaining every conversation that a person has ever heard is already realistic: it needs less than a terabyte of storage (for adequate quality). The speech or text recognition technologies are one of the biggest challenges of the concept.\n\nA second possibility would be to archive and analyze social Internet use to map the personality of people. By analyzing social Internet use during 50 years, it would be possible to model a society's culture, a society's way of thinking, and a society's interests.\n\nRothblatt envisions the creation of \"mindfiles\" – collections of data from all kinds of sources, including the photos we upload to Facebook, the discussions and opinions we share on forums or blogs, and other social media interactions that reflect our life experiences and our unique self.\n\nRichard Grandmorin summarized the concept of digital immortality by the following equation: \"semantic analysis + social internet use + Artificial Intelligence = immortality\".\n\nSome find that photos, videos, soundclips, social media posts and other data of oneself could already be regarded as such an archiving.\n\nSusanne Asche states:\nDefining the avatar to be alive allows it to communicate with the future in the sense that it continues to learn, evolve and interact with people, if they still exist. Technically, the operation exists to implement an artificial intelligence system to the avatar. This artificial intelligence system is then assumed to think and will react on the base of the archive.\n\nRothblatt proposes the term \"mindware\" for software that is being developed with the goal of generating conscious AIs. Such software would read a person's \"mindfile\" to generate a \"mindclone.\" Rothblatt also proposes a certain level of governmental approval for mindware, like an FDA certification, to ensure that the resulting mindclones are well made.\n\nDuring the calibration process, the biological people are living at the same time as their artifact in silicon. The artifact in silicon is calibrated to be as close as possible to the person in question.\nDuring this process ongoing updates, synchronization, and interaction between the two minds would maintain the twin minds as one.\n\n\n"}

Although officially an accident, suspicions of suicide surrounded his death, which occurred just days before the beginning of the Allied counterattack which would eventually defeat the German army.\n\nBorn to George and Louisa Cox of Islington, Middlesex in North London in May 1882, Edgar Cox was educated at Christ's Hospital in Newgate and in 1900 was commissioned as a junior officer into the Royal Engineers. After coming head of his class at the Royal Military Academy at Woolwich and receiving several awards, both there and at the School of Military Engineering he was sent, following training and home service, to the British colony of Sierra Leone to help delineate the boundary with neighbouring Liberia. This task occupied him until 1903, when he joined an Anglo-Portuguese boundary commission in Angola. In 1906 he left this post to conduct a three-year survey of the East African Protectorate (later to become Kenya). Back in Britain and serving at Aldershot barracks, he was promoted to captain, married the South African Nora and became a governor of his former school, which had by this time moved to Horsham. He also became a fellow of the Royal Geographical Society and was one of their delegates at the Paris International Map Conference in 1913.\n\nBetween 1912 and 1914, Cox demonstrated a talent for staff work and was assigned to the War Office as a staff officer (3rd class), gaining valuable experience in military intelligence and learning fluent French and German. His work was good enough that in August 1914 he was attached to the staff of Sir John French in charge of the British Expeditionary Force sent to France to counter the German invasion at the start of World War I.\n\nIn France he continued his staff duties under French throughout 1914 and 1915, participating in the planning and execution of several large offensives, but sharing in the reassignments at the start of 1916 following French's replacement by Douglas Haig, although he was compensated by a promotion to Major later in the year. During his service on the general staff he was awarded the Distinguished Service Order and was admitted into the Legion of Honour with a Croix de Chevalier. He would later also be awarded the Belgian Order of the Crown and the Italian Order of Saints Maurice and Lazarus for his war service.\n\nThrough 1916 and 1917 he served in the War Office as staff officer 2nd class to the Director of Military Intelligence and in January 1918 was recalled to France by Field Marshal Haig to take over his military intelligence department from Brigadier-General John Charteris. He was also given fast brevet promotions to Lieutenant Colonel, Colonel and Brigadier General to facilitate his position at this post. Within two months of his arrival, on 21 March, the Germans launched the surprise Operation Michael which recaptured all the ground gained during the battle of the Somme two years before and nearly drove a hole right through the Allied line. Two weeks later, Operation Georgette wiped out the British advances of the Third Battle of Ypres in 1917, seemingly undoing two years of bitter fighting in one blow.\n\nBy the time the German Spring Offensive petered out in July 1918, they had reached the closest point to Paris of the entire war and had come close to breaking the Allied armies and winning the conflict. 850,000 British and French soldiers had been wounded killed or captured in just four months. Although the Hundred Days Offensive which would eventually defeat the German army began two weeks later, the damage to Edgar Cox was done. During the months of the Spring Offensive he had worked feverishly to discover the locations and details of the next attacks and had deteriorated both mentally and physically in the process. Cox was knocked out by the influenza pandemic for much of June and did not return to duty until mid-August. He had become a heavy smoker and by August was no longer eating or sleeping, suffering severely from nervous exhaustion. On 26 August 1918 he announced that he would go for a swim and was driven down to Berck Plage near GHQ at Étaples. He entered the water alone and his body was recovered from the sea some time later. He was buried in Étaples Military Cemetery with full military honours. Following his death, the Royal Geographic Society reported that the British nation in the First World War had \"\"suffered no more grievous loss than in the death of General Cox\",\" and that \"He was one of those men, of whom there are very few, of whom nothing but praise was ever heard.\"\n\nAlthough officially his death was reported and recorded as an accident, suspicions of suicide have remained given Cox's disturbed state of mind in the days before his fatal swim. The turmoil of this period was recorded by one of his subordinates, a junior officer named Howard Spring who would later become a famous novelist and who recounted the last days of Brigadier-General Cox in his autobiography \"In the meantime\":\n"}

The drug is Immutep's lead compound.\n\nEftilagimod alpha (lab name: IMP321) is soluble version of the immune checkpoint molecule LAG3, used to increase an immune response to tumours. The drug is administered by subcutaneous injection. Eftilagimod alpha has two intended clinical settings, 'low dose' (for example 250 µg) as adjuvant to cancer vaccines and 'high dose' (such as 12 injections of 6 mg each) as first-line 'chemo-immunotherapy', that is, combined with standard chemotherapy. Eftilagimod alpha has been and is in Phase II clinical testing. The product has been shown to be non-immunogenic, that is, no anti-IMP321 antibodies have been detected in clinical trials. Currently the main indication for the drug is metastatic breast cancer.\n\nEftilagimod alpha is a 200 kDA soluble dimeric recombinant fusion protein of the extracellular portion of LAG3 with immunoglobulin, designed to activate antigen presenting cells. LAG3 is expressed on various cells in the immune system including activated T cells, Natural Killer cells (NK cells), B cells and dendritic cells, being a ligand for MHC class II molecules. On T cells LAG-3 is an inhibitory receptor. However, on dendritic cells LAG-3 is an activator, causing increased antigen presentation to cytotoxic CD8+ T cells when it binds to MHC Class II. Eftilagimod alpha is designed to harness this activation capacity as a 'chemo-immunotherapeutic', increasing antigen presentation in the wake of tumor debris created by chemotherapy.\n\nSoluble LAG3 was first established as a dendritic cell activator in the late 1990s. Frédéric Triebel, who discovered LAG3 in 1990, worked through the 1990s at his laboratory at the Institut Gustave Roussy, in collaboration with INSERM and Merck Serono, to elucidate LAG-3’s role in the immune system. Triebel et al. had successfully produced a soluble fusion protein of LAG3 and immunoglobulin around 1995 and had initially envisaged its use as an immunosuppressant after evidence that its interaction with MHC class II molecules leads to the down-regulation of CD4+ antigen-specific T cell clone proliferation and cytokine secretion, and that it inhibited the alloresponses of naive peripheral blood lymphocytes. However, in March 1999 a key paper in the \"Journal of Immunology\" from scientists at the University of Montreal, on which Triebel was listed as a co-author, demonstrated soluble LAG3's role as a dendritic cell activator. Shortly after this, in 2001, Triebel formed a biotechnology company called Immutep SA in 2001 in order to develop the therapeutic potential of LAG3 including soluble LAG3. Immutep called its product 'ImmuFact IMP321', the 'act' part of ImmuFact referring to the products immune activating properties. By 2010 there was a large body of evidence of the efficacy of IMP321 in cancer. Immutep was acquired by Prima BioMed in 2014 and as a result IMP321 became Prima BioMed's lead compound. In 2017 Prima Biomed changed its name to Immutep as consequence of their developmental Focus on LAG-3 based products.\n\nThe years 2000 to 2008 saw a number of demonstrations of IMP321's effectiveness \"in vitro\" and \"in vivo\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImmutep conducted two Phase I studies with IMP321 designed to evaluate the safety as well as immune response profile of IMP321 in humans\n\n\n\nImmutep's first serious clinical study of IMP321 was an open label study in 21 metastatic renal cell carcinoma patients, with the drug being used as a monotherapy (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT00351949, Immutep code name P003). These patients were known to be immunocompromised. The study, which initiated in late 2005 saw patients administered ascending doses of IMP321 up to 30 mg per injection fortnightly for six injections subcutaneously. The drug appeared to work at the two highest doses of 6 mg and 30 mg, with two notable outcomes for the eight patients who received these doses:\n\n\nThe results were published online in the journal \"Clinical Cancer Research\" in September 2009.\n\nA 30-patient Phase IIa open label study in HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT00349934, Immutep code name P005) has suggested that IMP321 works as a chemo-immunotherapeutic in breast cancer, where chemotherapy creates tumor debris, and IMP321 increases activation of APCs as they take up that debris. This trial arose in part from the findings of a June 2005 online paper in the journal Cancer Letters by two researchers at the Centre René Huguenin in Saint-Cloud near Paris who had collaborated with Frédéric Triebel. That paper demonstrated that soluble LAG3 correlated with improved survival in breast cancer patients whose tumors were estrogen or progesterone receptor positive. The Phase IIa study which partly confirmed this finding was initiated by Immutep around August 2006 and was conducted at the René Huguenin as well as two other Paris hospitals - the Hôpital Européen Georges-Pompidou (15th arrondissement) and the Hôpital Tenon (20th arrondissement). In the study, patients on paclitaxel were administered ascending subcutaneous doses of IMP321 on days 2 and 16 of a 28-day cycle of paclitaxel over six cycles. The maximum IMP321 dose was 6.25 mg. Paclitaxel was given on days 1, 8 and 15, meaning patients got IMP321 the day after paclitaxel had created tumor debris. There were two notable outcomes to this study:\n\n\n\nThe results of this study were reported in January 2010, and following an oral presentation at the ASCO Annual Meeting in June 2010 the results were published in July 2010 in the \"Journal of Translational Medicine\". The study provided the basis of a new patent filing for IMP321\n\nIn April 2009 Immutep announced its involvement in a Phase I study in pancreatic cancer conducted at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis. This 18-patient study (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT00732082, Immutep code name P008) evaluated for safety the combination of IMP321 with gemcitabine at doses up to 2 mg. The combination was found to be safe however no significant differences were observed when comparing pre- and post-treatment levels of monocytes, dendritic cells to T cells, probably due to sub-optimal dosing. The results of the study were reported online in the journal \"Investigational New Drugs\" in August 2012.\n\nIn September 2006 Immutep announced its involvement in a Phase I study being conducted at the Cancer Centre at the St Luc University Clinic in Brussels. This 20-patient study (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT00365937, Immutep code name P006) was a randomised open-label four-arm trial comparing a selected set of 8 HLA-A2 melanoma peptide antigens with or without IMP321 and/or Montanide ISA 51, a vaccine adjuvant composed of a light mineral oil and a surfactant system designed to make a water-in-oil emulsion. In this study all patients randomized in the peptides-alone arm relapsed\nduring the first year whereas a majority of patients in the three other groups were still disease-free at follow-up, when the median disease-free survival follow-up was 33 months. The results of this study were presented to the 25th Annual Scientific Meeting of the International Society for Biological Therapy of Cancer in Washington, DC in October 2010.\n\nIn August 2007 Immutep announced its involvement in a Phase I study being conducted at the University Hospital of Lausanne in Switzerland where a group was working on adoptive T cell transfer after transient lymphodepletion associated with peptide vaccination. This study recruited 12 patients (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT00324623, Immutep code name P007) where the patient's lymphocytes were depleted using chemotherapy, after which patients were given their own peripheral mononuclear cells, enriched with tumour-specific CD8 T cells. During the immune reconstitution period the patients were given a cancer vaccine containing a peptide melanoma antigen called MART1, adjuvanted with incomplete Freund’s adjuvant and, in half the patients, IMP321. While there was no confirmed responses as per the RECIST criteria for the 12 patients recruited, the investigators noted a significant expansion of MART-1-specific CD8 T cells in the IMP321 group, where there was also a higher proportions of effector cells and a significantly reduced expansion of regulatory T cells. These results were published in the \"Journal of Translational Medicine\" in April 2014.\n\nA third melanoma trial, also at the University Hospital of Lausanne (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT01308294, Immutep code name P009) was designed to assess the effectiveness of IMP321 when combined with the melanoma peptides NA-17, MAGE-3.A2, NY-ESO-1, Melan-A and MAGE-A3-DP4. This study has been terminated due to a low enrollment rate and has not reported any data.\n\nIn 2010 scientists at the Istituto Nazionale dei Tumori initiated a 20-patient open label study in prostate cancer patients that combined peptides from survivin with IMP321 (EudraCT Number 2009-017798-39, Immutep code name P010). The peptides, restricted for different HLA-I alleles, are emulsified in Montanide ISA 51. This study has yet to report any data.\n\nAs of October 2018 three clinical studies are ongoing.\n\nIn the AIPAC study IMP321 is administered in combination with Paclitaxel to woman with HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer who progressed after endocrine therapy. This Phase IIb trial is a randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled study aiming to enroll 241 patients.\n\nThe TACTImel Phase I study is investigating safety and possible synergies with the anti-programmed cell death antibody pembrolizumab in unresectable or metastatic melanoma.\n\nThe INSIGHT Phase I study is investigating feasibility and safety of different routes of drug application (e.g. intra tumoral, intra peritoneal and sub cutaneous).\n\nPrima (now Immutep) announced in late May 2015 that it had filed a provisional patent application over the use of IMP321 in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors, following on from pre-clinical work showing higher response rates from the combinations.\n\nIn May 2015 Prima announced a collaboration with NEC Corporation and Yamaguchi University in Japan in which Yamaguchi researchers will be combining IMP321 with a peptide vaccine they have developed as a potential therapeutic for hepatocellular carcinoma.\n\nImmutep granted the rights to IMP321 in mainland China, Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan in October 2013 to Eddingpharm, a privately held Chinese pharmaceutical company.\n\nIMP321 is manufactured in CHO cells. Immutep worked with Lonza in 2012 on cell line selection, master cell banking and process development for IMP321 after which the Shanghai-based WuXi PharmaTech was retained as contract manufacture.\n"}

She was powered by a pair of four-cylinder triple-expansion steam engines, each driving one shaft, which developed a total of and gave a maximum speed of . The engines were powered by 24 Yarrow water-tube boilers. The ship carried a maximum of of coal and an additional of fuel oil that was sprayed on the coal to increase its burn rate. At full capacity, she could steam for at a speed of . \"Defence\" was designed to carry 779 officers and men.\n\nThe ship's main armament consisted of four BL 9.2-inch Mark X guns in two twin-gun turrets, one each fore and aft. Her secondary armament of ten BL 7.5-inch Mark II guns were mounted amidships in single turrets. Anti-torpedo boat defence was provided by sixteen QF 12-pounder (three-inch) 18-cwt guns. \"Defence\" also mounted five submerged 17.7-inch torpedo tubes, one of which was mounted in the stern.\n\nThe waterline belt consisted of of Krupp cemented armour roughly between the fore and aft 7.5-inch gun turrets, but was reduced in steps to three inches to the ends of the ship. The gun turrets and barbettes were protected by of armour. The thickness of the lower deck was . The armour of the conning tower was thick.\n\n\"Defence\" was ordered as part of the 1904–05 naval construction programme as the last of three armoured cruisers. She was laid down on 22 February 1905 at the Royal Dockyard in Pembroke Dock, Wales. She was christened on 27 April 1907 by Lady Cawdor and commissioned on 3 February 1909 at the cost of £1,362,970. The ship was briefly assigned to the 5th Cruiser Squadron of the Home Fleet until she was transferred to the 2nd Cruiser Squadron when the Home Fleet reorganised on 23 March 1909. Three months later \"Defence\" was reassigned to the 1st Cruiser Squadron. She escorted the ocean liner in 1911–1912 while the latter ship served as the royal yacht for the newly crowned King George V's trip to India to attend the Delhi Durbar. After the ship returned to Plymouth in early 1912, \"Defence\" was transferred to the China Station, where she remained until December when she was ordered to rejoin the 1st Cruiser Squadron in the Mediterranean as flagship.\nAt the start of the First World War, she was involved in the pursuit of the German warships \"Goeben\" and \"Breslau\", but Rear-Admiral Ernest Troubridge decided not to engage \"Goeben\" due to the latter's more powerful guns, heavier armour and faster speed. She then blockaded the German ships inside the Dardanelles until the ship was ordered on 10 September to the South Atlantic to take part in the hunt for Admiral Graf von Spee's East Asia Squadron. The order was cancelled on 14 September when it became clear that the German squadron was still in the Eastern Pacific and \"Defence\" returned to the Dardanelles. The Admiralty again ordered the ship to the South Atlantic in October to join Rear-Admiral Christopher Cradock's squadron searching for the German ships. \"Defence\", however, had only reached Montevideo, Uruguay by 3 November 1914 when she received word that most of Admiral Cradock's squadron had been destroyed two days previously at the Battle of Coronel. The ship rendezvoused with the battlecruisers and later that month and transferred her long-range radio equipment to \"Invincible\" before sailing to South Africa to escort a troop convoy to Great Britain. \"Defence\" departed Table Bay, Cape Town on 8 December and rejoined the 1st Cruiser Squadron of the Grand Fleet as its flagship upon her arrival.\n\n\"Defence\" received a QF 12-pounder (3-inch) 12 cwt anti-aircraft (AA) gun and a QF 3-pounder (47 mm) AA gun in 1915–16. The 12-pounder gun was mounted on the aft superstructure and the 3-pounder on the quarterdeck at the extreme rear.\n\nDuring the Battle of Jutland on 31 May 1916, she was the flagship of Rear-Admiral Sir Robert Arbuthnot, leading the First Cruiser Squadron. The squadron formed the starboard flank of the cruiser screen, ahead of the main body of the Grand Fleet. \"Defence\" was just to the right of the centre of the line. At 5:47 p.m., \"Defence\", and , the leading two ships of the squadron, spotted the German II Scouting Group and opened fire. Their shells fell short and the two ships turned to port in pursuit, cutting in front of the battlecruiser , which was forced to turn away to avoid a collision. Shortly afterwards, they spotted the disabled German light cruiser and closed to engage. When the two ships reached a range of from \"Wiesbaden\" they were spotted in turn at 6:05 by the German battlecruiser and four battleships who were less than away. The fire from the German ships was heavy and \"Defence\" was hit by two salvoes from the German ships that caused the aft 9.2-inch magazine to explode. The resulting fire spread via the ammunition passages to the adjacent 7.5-inch magazines which detonated in turn. The ship exploded at 6:20 with the loss of all men on board; between 893 and 903 men were killed.\n\nAt the time, it was believed that \"Defence\" had been reduced to fragments by the explosion, but the wreck was discovered in mid-1984 by Clive Cussler and a NUMA survey of the North Sea and English Channel at coordinates . It was dived upon in 2001 by a team led by nautical archaeologist Innes McCartney and found to be largely intact, despite the violence of her sinking. \"Defence\", along with the other Jutland wrecks, was belatedly declared a protected place under the Protection of Military Remains Act 1986, to discourage further damage to the resting place of approximately 900 men.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1201014", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1201014", "title": "Issy Smith", "text": "Issy Smith\n\nIssy Smith, VC ( – 11 September 1940) was a British-Australian recipient of the Victoria Cross (VC), the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to eligible forces of the Commonwealth and United Kingdom. In recognition of his VC, he was also awarded the French Croix de Guerre and Russian Cross of St. George (4th class) by the respective governments.\n\nBorn Ishroulch Shmeilowitz (and other renderings), to parents residing in Egypt, Smith travelled to Britain as a child stowaway and first volunteered to serve in the British Army in 1904. He emigrated to Australia after discharge, where he remained until mobilised as a reservist in 1914. As a corporal in the 1st Battalion, The Manchester Regiment, Smith was engaged in the Second Battle of Ypres. On 26 April 1915, Smith, on his own initiative, recovered wounded soldiers while exposed to sustained fire and attended to them \"with the greatest devotion to duty regardless of personal risk\". His conduct secured a recommendation for the Victoria Cross, which was awarded to Smith in August 1915.\n\nAfter his demobilisation, Smith returned to Australia with his wife and daughter. He became a prominent figure in Melbourne's Jewish community, was appointed a Justice of the Peace, and unsuccessfully stood as a candidate for the United Australia Party in the 1931 general election.\n\nSmith was born in Alexandria, the son of French citizens Moses and Eva Shmeilowitz, who were of Russian origin. His father was employed by the French Consulate-General as a clerk. Aged 11, Smith embarked as a stowaway aboard a vessel proceeding to London. Undaunted by this unfamiliar environment, Smith attended Berner Street School, Commercial Street, and worked as a deliverer in the East End, then an impoverished ghetto where Yiddish was the predominant spoken language. Persecution and extreme deprivation had compelled millions of Eastern European Jews to migrate to Western Europe, the Americas, and elsewhere. By the time of Issy Smith's arrival, Jewish immigration to Britain had peaked and was further curtailed by the enactment of the Aliens Act in 1905.\n\nHe joined the British Army in 1904, becoming a private in the Manchester Regiment. The pseudonym Issy Smith was adopted in the process of enlisting at the behest of a recruiting sergeant. Smith completed his training, serving in South Africa and India with the 1st Battalion. He boxed competitively, winning the British Army's middleweight championship, and played football. While in India, Smith was present at the Delhi Durbar parade, in which the 1st Manchesters participated, and was thus awarded the Delhi Durbar Medal.\n\nAccepting his discharge in 1912, Smith emigrated to Australia after brief employment in London. He lived in the Melbourne suburb of Ascot Vale while working for the city's gas company. Retained as a reservist, Smith was mobilised by the British Army after the commencement of hostilities in August 1914. Some sources state that Smith was present at the capture of German New Guinea by the Australian Naval and Military Expeditionary Force.\n\nThe 1st Manchester Regiment, stationed in India, sailed from Karachi for France on 29 August 1914 as the constituent British battalion of the Jullundur Brigade, 3rd (Lahore) Division. The battalion disembarked at Marseilles in late September, but was not deployed to the front until 26 October 1914, when it occupied trenches east of Festubert.\n\nActively engaged in the battles of Givenchy and Neuve Chapelle, the 1st Manchesters had incurred hundreds of casualties by the beginning of \"Second Ypres\" on 22 April 1915. Chemical warfare first emerged on the Western Front during the German offensive, and Smith himself would be temporarily incapacitated by gas. The 1st Manchesters were involved in an initially successful counter-attack conducted by the Jullundur and Ferozepore brigades on 26 April 1915, near Wieltje, in conjunction with other Allied units. Rudimentary forms of protection against the chlorine gas proved ineffectual, limiting the advance and causing many soldiers to succumb to its effects.\n\nDuring the Allied counter-attack, Smith, of his own volition, ventured towards a German position to attend to a severely wounded soldier. He carried him some to relative safety while exposed to intense German fire. According to the Victoria Cross citation, he brought in \"many more wounded men\" throughout the day under similarly perilous conditions \"regardless of personal risk\". Recounting his own rescue by Smith to a \"Daily Mail\" correspondent, Sergeant Rooke said of the corporal: \"He behaved with wonderful coolness and presence of mind the whole time, and no man deserved a Victoria Cross more thoroughly than he did\".\nSmith was hospitalised in Dublin, where he recuperated from his gassing. His Victoria Cross was later presented to him at Buckingham Palace by King George V. He was feted by publications such as \"The Jewish Chronicle\", and his status as a recipient of the VC was utilised by the British government for the purposes of stimulating further recruitment. His visits to Jewish communities in the United Kingdom generated much interest, attracting dignitaries and large crowds in the process. On one such occasion, in September 1915, he was invited back to his old school in the East End to receive a gold watch and chain in honour of his Victoria Cross from his former schoolmates. Also that month, Smith was received at Mansion House, Dublin, by the Under-Secretary for Ireland, Matthew Nathan, who took advantage of the occasion to reaffirm loyalty to both Britain and Ireland. Contemporaries, however, continued to report instances of discrimination against Jewish servicemen, including an incident involving Issy Smith in Leeds. While documenting his recruitment drive, \"The Jewish Chronicle\" reported that the proprietor of the Grand Restaurant had refused to serve Smith during his tour of Yorkshire because he was Jewish, while indicating the staff were prepared to accept his non-Jewish acquaintance. Smith's tour continued without disruption, taking him to Edinburgh, Scotland.\n\nMeanwhile, on the Western Front, the demoralised and depleted Indian Corps fought its final European battle at Loos. With the exception of two cavalry divisions, the Indian Corps in Europe redeployed to the Middle East theatre, sailing from Marseilles on 10 December 1915 and arriving in Basra on 8 January 1916 to be integrated into the Mesopotamian Expeditionary Force. Smith returned to active duty as a sergeant, serving in Mesopotamia and Palestine until the cessation of hostilities with the Ottoman Empire and Germany on 30 October and 11 November respectively. He had been wounded five times.\n\nDemobilised after the war, Smith returned to London. As a war hero, he was intermittently invited to social functions. In June 1920, he attended a garden party at Buckingham Palace, given by the king for all surviving Victoria Cross recipients. They included veterans of the Indian Mutiny, Rorke's Drift, Relief of General Gordon, the First and Second Boer Wars, countless campaigns on the borders of the empire, and dozens from the Great War. In October 1921, with Harry Kenny, he unveiled the Hackney War Memorial. In 1922, he attended \"The Pilgrimage to Ypres\", in Belgium, laying a wreath at the Cloth Hall there.\n\nDespite his fame and popularity, like many former servicemen contending with post-war economic hardship, Smith struggled financially – a predicament compounded by illness. As a consequence he pawned his medals for £20, only for them to be recovered by the Jewish Historical Society on the urging of the wife of Chief Rabbi Joseph Hertz and ultimately reunited with Smith. Smith's varied occupations in post-war Britain included work as an actor with a theatre troupe. He emigrated to Australia in 1925 with his wife Elsie (née McKechnie), whom he had married at Camberwell Register Office. Marriage to Elsie produced two children (Olive and Maurice) and reputedly angered his parents despite the couple's later observance of Jewish religious tradition in a formal ceremony held at Central Synagogue, Hallam Street.\n\nThe family settled in Moonee Ponds, Melbourne, where Smith's standing in the Jewish community became high. There he joined the Essendon sub branch of the RSL. He was appointed manager of British International Pictures in Melbourne, in 1928, worked for Dunlop Rubber Company, and was finally employed by the Civil Aviation Board at Essendon Airport. Appointed a Justice of the Peace in 1930, Smith tried politics as a candidate in the 1931 federal election for the United Australia Party contesting the seat of Melbourne in the House of Representatives, and \"seriously challenged the hitherto unassailable Dr Maloney\".\n\nSmith died of coronary thrombosis in September 1940. He was buried in the Jewish section of Fawkner Cemetery with full military honours. His Victoria Cross was sold by his family in 1990 and later auctioned as part of a collection of Smith's medals, selling for approximately £30,000 (US$60,000).\n\nFollowing representations from the Association of Jewish Ex-Servicemen and Women, in September 2013 Communities Secretary Eric Pickles announced that the plan to memorialise British-born First World War Victoria Cross medal holders by laying commemorative paving stones in their home towns would be extended to include Smith, who was born in Egypt.\n\n\n"}

He was a second cousin of William B. Travis and was a messenger of the Battle of the Alamo. His younger brother, Milledge Luke Bonham, was a brigadier general in the Confederate States Army in the American Civil War, and served as Governor of South Carolina from 1862 to 1864.\n\nBonham was born, along with his sibling (Milledge Luke Bonham) in the Redbank area (present day Saluda County) on February 20, 1807. The son of James and Sophia Butler (Smith) Bonham.\n\nBonham entered South Carolina College in 1824. In 1827, in his senior year, he led a student protest over harsh attendance regulations and the poor food served at the college boardinghouse. He was expelled, along with the entire senior class. In 1830, Bonham practiced law in Pendleton, but was found in contempt of court after caning an attorney who had insulted one of Bonham's clients. When ordered to apologize by the sitting judge, he refused and threatened to tweak the judge’s nose. Bonham was sentenced to ninety days for contempt of court.\n\nHe served as an aide to Governor James Hamilton Jr. during the Nullification Crisis in 1832. Bonham brandished a sword and pistol, condemning Andrew Jackson and the Washington politicians. His outspoken position brought him the rank of lieutenant colonel. At the same time he served as captain of a Charleston artillery company.\n\nIn October 1834, Bonham moved to Montgomery, Alabama, where relatives lived. The following year he went to Mobile, where he helped organize a company of militia cavalry called the \"Mobile Greys\" to serve in Texas. The company reached San Felipe, Texas in November 1835, and Bonham was commissioned a lieutenant in the Texian Cavalry on December 3.\n\nOn December 1, 1835, he wrote to Sam Houston from San Felipe volunteering his services for Texas and declining all pay, lands, or rations in return. In December 1835, he was commissioned a second lieutenant in the Texas cavalry, but apparently was not assigned to any specific unit. He had time to set up a law practice in Brazoria and was advertising the fact in the Telegraph and Texas Register by January 2, 1836.\n\nBonham and Houston quickly developed a mutual admiration. After being in Texas for only one month Bonham recommended to Houston that William S. Blount of North Carolina be granted a commission as a captain in the Texas cavalry. On January 11, 1836, Houston recommended to James W. Robinson that Bonham be promoted to major, for \"His influence in the army is great, more so than some who `would be generals'.\" Bonham probably traveled to San Antonio de Béxar and the Alamo with James Bowie and arrived on January 19, 1836. On January 26 he was appointed one of a committee of seven to draft a preamble and resolutions on behalf of the garrison in support of Governor Henry Smith. On February 1 he was an unsuccessful candidate in the election of delegates to represent the Bexar garrison at the Texas constitutional convention.\n\nHe was sent by Travis to obtain aid for the garrison at Bexar on or about February 16, 1836. He visited Goliad, but the commander of the forces there, James Fannin, was unable to provide assistance. Bonham's inimitable spirit is best described by T.R. Fehrenbach in his Texas opus, Lone Star: A History of Texas and the Texans: \"\"At the end, the weary Bonham, a lawyer, a Carolinian of exulted family and a friend of Travis, turned his mount around and rode back toward San Antonio. He was told it was useless to throw away his life. He answered back that Buck Travis deserved to know the answer to his appeals, spat upon the ground, and galloped west into his own immortality.\" Thus, Bonham returned to the Alamo on March 3, bearing through the Mexican lines a letter from Robert McAlpin Williamson assuring Travis that help was on its way and urging him to hold out. Bonham died in the battle of the Alamo on March 6, 1836. James Bonham was 29 at the time, he is believed to have died manning one of the cannons in the interior of the Alamo chapel.\n\nThe town of Bonham, Texas, is named for him. Bonham is the county seat of Fannin County, named for the commander who Bonham tried to enjoin for assistance at the Alamo. A 1936 Texas Centennial Marker was placed on the courthouse square in the city of Bonham. The monument displays a statue of Bonham by Texas sculptor Allie Tennant. Many Texas schools are named after James Bonham, for example, in the cities of Abilene, Amarillo, Bryan, Dallas, El Paso, Houston, McAllen, Midland, Odessa, San Angelo, San Antonio, and Temple.\n\n\"Flat Grove,\" Bonham's home in Saluda, is the only known birthplace of an Alamo defender still in existence. It is maintained as a museum.\nBeginning in 2014, Texas A&M University and Bonham's alma mater, the University of South Carolina will begin an SEC cross-divisional rivalry with both schools competing for the Bonham trophy.\n\n\n Theo Chau 2012\n\n"}

After Huntly's defeat at Corrichie, he went into exile, and shortly after his return to Scotland he was murdered by a kinswoman.\n\nJohn Gordon was the son of Alexander Gordon, Master of Sutherland and Lady Janet Stewart. His father Alexander was the son of Lady Elizabeth de Moravia, 10th Countess of Sutherland (sister of John de Moravia, 9th Earl of Sutherland) and Adam Gordon, younger son of George Gordon, 2nd Earl of Huntly. His mother Janet was the daughter of John Stewart, 2nd Earl of Atholl and Margaret Douglas, Fair Maid of Galloway. Elizabeth de Moravia and her husband Adam quashed a rival claimant to the earldom of Sutherland in 1518, at the Battle of Alltachuilain.\n\nAlexander Gordon was made Earl of Sutherland in December 1527, when his mother, the Countess Elizabeth de Moravia, resigned her rights. Alexander died in 1530, and Lady Janet Stewart married Hugh Kennedy of Girvanmains, and subsequently, Henry Stewart, 1st Lord Methven.\n\nJohn, although still a minor, attended the Parliament of Scotland, in December 1543, that rejected the Treaty of Greenwich.

They sailed in the \"Lion\" and captured Borve Castle, Sutherland. Kennedy subsequently captured Iye Mackay and brought him to Edinburgh.\n\nIn September 1562, Mary, Queen of Scots and her half-brother James Stewart newly made Earl of Moray came north to Inverness and Aberdeen. Their discussions with John's cousin the Earl of Huntly led to armed conflict. After the battle of Corrichie, secret letters between John Gordon and the Earl of Huntly were discovered. John Gordon fled to Louvain in Flanders. At the Parliament of Scotland on 28 May 1563, in the presence of Queen Mary, Huntly and Sutherland were forfeited. In 1565 Queen Mary of Scotland restored the Earls of Huntly, Sutherland and others of the name Gordon who had been forfeited.\n\nThe Earl of Sutherland was invited to return to Scotland. The Earl of Bedford, Governor of Berwick on Tweed sent a privateer called Wilson who carried Swedish letters of marque to intercept his ship, and the Earl was imprisoned at Berwick. Sutherland was considered a danger to English policy in Scotland. Mary, Queen of Scots, demanded the release of the Earl, who was now sick with an ague. Bedford wrote to Elizabeth on his behalf. The Earl was released in February 1566 after the assurance that he was reconciled with the Earl of Moray. On his return he married Marie Seton, daughter of Lord Seton.

That year, the company began paying a cash dividend to shareholders.\n\nIn 1991, National Health Laboratories moved from the NASDAQ OTC exchange to the New York Stock Exchange, where it began to trade under the new ticker symbol NH. Up until that time the company had performed very well, including through the 1990-1991 recession. Its earnings peaked that year at almost US$90 million, and its stock price had risen from its low within the prior few years by several-fold.\n\nHowever, beginning in 1991 the company became embroiled in Operation \"Labscam,\" a nationwide crackdown on fraud in the health-care system, initiated by the U.S. Attorney's Office in San Diego, California. The charges were that the company and others routinely submitted false claims to the government health-care agencies Medicare and Medicaid for unnecessary tests which physicians had never ordered. In 1992, National Health Laboratories became the first of the companies to be prosecuted in the government operation.\n\nIn 1992, the company reported revenues of over US$720 million, however with earnings of only US$40 million. The small gain that year reflected a fourth quarter charge of US$80 million, which the company paid in a settlement agreement with state and federal governments related to the LABSCAM investigation. The total payments made by National Health Laboratories in the settlement came to US$111 million that year, and ultimately reached US$173 million.\n\nIn 1993, revenues were up to US$761 million, with new peak earnings of nearly US$113 million. By that time the company had 22 major laboratories. The stock price reached a new all-time high in 1993, which became the peak for the next couple of years, and the company was added to the S&P MidCap 400 list.\n\nOn March 8, 1994 National Health Laboratories Inc. reorganized as a holding company, National Health Laboratories Holdings Inc.\n\nBy 1994, MacAndrews & Forbes Holdings Inc. then owned the Revlon Holdings Group's former 24 percent of National Health Laboratories Holdings. That company was a distributor of licorice extract and chocolate, which had previously been taken over, along with Revlon, by Ronald Perelman in the 1980s.\n\nOn May 4, 1994, National Health Laboratories announced that it would acquire Allied Clinical Laboratories, Inc. of Nashville, Tennessee, reducing their takeover offer to $204 million after federal officials issued new subpoenas in an investigation of Medicare billing practices at Allied Clinical Laboratories Inc. In 1993, Allied generated revenues of US$163 million. The former President and CEO of Allied Clinical, Haywood D. Cochrane, Jr., then became Vice Chairman of National Health Laboratories. In order to complete the cash transaction, the company discontinued paying its dividend at that time.\n\nBy the end of 1994, the company had run into financial difficulty again, as it struggled through the economic soft landing that year. Its earnings dropped by over two-thirds, to only US$30 million. The stock never traded that year at more than half of its 1993 peak, and at its 1994 low, it was down by nearly two-thirds from the all-time high.\n\nOn April 28, 1995 National Health Laboratories Holdings Inc. merged with Roche Biomedical Laboratories, Inc. and changed its name to Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings. It began trading under its new ticker symbol LH. Shareholders of National Health Laboratories received 0.72 shares of the new company, plus $5.60 in cash, for a 50.1 percent interest in the new company. At the time, James R. Maher was President and Chief Executive Officer of National Health Laboratories. Following the merger, Maher relinquished those positions, and instead became Chairman of the new company, succeeding the financier Ronald O. Perelman in that position. Perelman received about US$100 million from the deal, which made the new company the largest blood-testing company in the United States.\n\nThe merged company created revenues of US$1.7 billion. National Health Laboratories already held long-term debt of US$351 million. Together with the Roche debt, the combined companies owed US$590 million prior to the merger. Another US$288 million was added to help finance the payout to shareholders. By year-end 1995, the new company's total debt reached US$959 million.\n\nRoche Biomedical Laboratories had been created by and was a wholly owned subsidiary of Hoffmann-La Roche, Inc., the American arm of the Swiss medical conglomerate, Roche Holding, Limited. Before 1982, the core of Roche Biomedical Laboratories had been Biomedical Reference Laboratories, which dated from the late 1960s, and was located in Burlington, North Carolina. That core company had become publicly traded in 1979. Hoffman-La Roche acquired it for US$163.5 million in 1982 and then merged it with all of its laboratories, and incorporated the merged company that year as Roche Biomedical Laboratories, Inc. in Burlington. By the early 1990s, Roche Biomedical had become one of the largest clinical laboratory networks in the United States, with US$600 million in sales.\n\nBy 1993 Roche Biomedical Laboratories had revenues of US$712 million, with 17 major laboratories. Dr. James Powell was President of Roche Biomedical, and after the merger with National Health Laboratories he became President and CEO of the new company, Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings, which then relocated from La Jolla, California to the Roche Biomedical headquarters in Burlington, North Carolina. Hoffmann-La Roche also contributed US$186.7 million in cash to the deal, and retained 49.9 interest in the new merged company.\n\nBy year-end 1995, the new Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings suffered a marginal loss of a few million dollars. The stock price dropped by almost half again through the year, to within 10% of its all-time low since going public a half dozen years earlier. By early the next year, it broke marginally below that level, and set a new all-time low.\n\nIn July 1998, LabCorp acquired the Michigan-based laboratory division of \"Universal Standard Healthcare\" (UHCI). LabCorp also acquired an equity position in Universal Standard Healthcare and has become UHCI's clinical laboratory long-term testing provider but terminated this agreement one year later.\n\nIn June 2000, LabCorp completed the acquisition of San Diego-based \"Pathology Medical Laboratories\" for an undisclosed amount.\n\nIn 2000, LabCorp generated revenues of US$1.9 billion with over 18,000 employees.\n\nIn May 2001, LabCorp completed its acquisition of \"Path Lab Holdings Inc.\", the largest regional laboratory in New England, and just a few weeks later the acquisition of Minneapolis-based \"ViroMed Inc.\", specialized on clinical diagnostic testing in virology, molecular biology, serology, microbiology, mycology and mycobacteriology, as well as in tissue/eye bank testing, for an undisclosed amount.\n\nIn December 2001, LabCorp became the exclusive marketer for genomics and proteomics predictive cancer test products made by Myriad Genetics, Inc.\n\nIn May 2002, LabCorp announced the acquisition of all outstanding Shares of Canadian medical laboratory services company Dynacare Inc. for $480 million in cash and own shares.\n\nIn January 2003, LabCorp acquired all of the outstanding shares of \"Dianon\", a provider of anatomical pathology and oncology testing]] services, for $598 million in cash.\n\nIn 2005, LabCorp's revenues totaled $3.3 billion; in 2006, revenues were $3.6 billion; and in 2007, revenues reached $4.1 billion.\n\nIn March 2005, LabCorp announced the acquisition of all outstanding Shares of \"Esoterix, Inc.\", a leading provider of specialty reference testing, for approximately $150 million in cash from private equity firm \"Behrman Capital\".\n\nIn November 2006, LabCorp acquired \"Litholink Corporation\", a kidney stone analysis laboratory.\n\nIn December 2007, LabCorp acquired \"Tandem Labs\", a Contract research organization specializing in advanced mass spectrometry, immunoanalytical support, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics, headquartered in Salt Lake City, UT for an undisclosed amount.\n\nIn June 2009, LabCorp acquired Monogram Biosciences, a diagnostic lab specializing in HIV resistance testing, headquartered in South San Francisco, CA, in a cash tender of $4.55 per share for approximately $155 million including debt.\n\nIn May 2010, LabCorp acquired the assets of its Santa Ana, California-based rival \"Westcliff Medical Laboratory\" which had just filed a Chapter 11 bankruptcy action in federal court. The FTC challenged this acquisition but lost in court.\n\nIn September 2010, LabCorp announced the acquisition of \"Genzyme Genetics\", formerly a division of Genzyme, with 9 testing laboratories and approximately 1900 employees, for $925 million in cash.\n\nIn June 2011, LabCorp acquired their Canadian central labs partner \"Clearstone\" from investment firm \"Czura Thornton\" for an undisclosed amount, thus adding Clearstone's global network of central laboratories, including sites in China, France, Singapore and Canada, and the central laboratory protocol management system APOLLO CLPM to their portfolio.\n\nIn November 2011, LabCorp completed the acquisition of more than 90% of the shares of DNA testing company \"Orchid Cellmark\" for $85 million but had to sell parts of Orchid's paternity business to \"DNA Diagnostics Center\".\n\nIn May 2012, LabCorp Clinical Trials sold its European biological sampling kit building operation located in Hamburg to clinical supply chain solutions provider \"Marken\".\n\nIn August 2012, LabCorp completed the acquisition of rival testing lab \"Medtox Scientific\" for $241 million.\n\nIn September 2013, LabCorp acquired \"MuirLab\", the clinical laboratory outreach business from John Muir Health.\n\nIn October 2014, LabCorp announced it had entered into an agreement to acquire Covance Inc. for approximately $6.1 billion. Just a few weeks later, LabCorp completed its $85.3 million acquisition of \"LipoScience\", a developer of diagnostic tests based on nuclear magnetic resonance technology measuring heart disease risk.\n\nIn December 2014, LabCorp announced the completion of its acquisition of \"Bode Technology Group, Inc.\", a provider of forensic DNA analysis, DNA collection products, and relationship testing, \"from SolutionPoint International, Inc.\" for an undisclosed amount.\n\nIn October 2015, LabCorp announced the acquisition of \"Safe Foods International Holdings, LLC\" and its two operating companies, \"International Food Network\" and \"The National Food Laboratory\" for an undisclosed amount, thus expanding their capabilities in food and beverage product-development and product-integrity.\n\nIn March 2016, LabCorp completed the acquisition of Torrance, CA-based laboratory firm \"Pathology Inc.\", a provider of expertise in reproductive FDA donor testing as well as anatomic, molecular and digital pathology services, for an undisclosed amount.\n\nIn August 2016, LabCorp announced it would acquire Sequenom for $371 million including debt, thus expanding its reach overseas, especially in Europe and Asia.\n\nIn October 2016, LabCorp acquired \"ClearPath Diagnostics\", a provider of laboratory diagnostic services in the Northeastern United States, from private equity firm \"Shore Capital Partners\" for an undisclosed amount.\n\nIn May 2017, LabCorp acquired the Pathology Associates Medical Laboratories in Spokane, WA from Providence Health & Services and Catholic Health Initiatives for an undisclosed sum.\n\nIn July 2017, LabCorp acquired the contract research organisation (CRO) \"Chiltern\" for $1.2 Billion.\n\nThe following is an illustration of the company's major mergers and acquisitions and historical predecessors (this is not a comprehensive list):\n\nLabCorp has been criticized for its practice of paying the salaries of genetic counselors in hospitals and doctors' offices, which is perceived to be a possible conflict of interest.\n\nIn July 2018, LabCorp was hit with a ransomware attack.\n\n, the LabCorp Board of Directors includes Garheng Kong.\nIn 1997 Roche owned 49.7% of LabCorp but sold all of their LabCorp stock until 2002.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "5345336", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5345336", "title": "Life review", "text": "Life review\n\nA life review is a phenomenon widely reported as occurring during near-death experiences, in which a person rapidly sees much or the totality of their life history. It is often referred to by people having experienced this phenomenon as having their life \"flash before their eyes\". The life review is discussed in some detail by near-death experience scholars such as Raymond Moody, Kenneth Ring, and Barbara Rommer. A reformatory purpose seems commonly implicit in accounts, though not necessarily for earthly purpose, since return from a near-death experience may reportedly entail individual choice.\n\nExperiences number up to eight million in the United States. Although rare, there are also a few accounts of life reviews or similar experiences without a near-death experience, such as during the simpler out-of-body experience or when under circumstances of intense threat or duress. \n\nThe perception of time appears to be subjective and has been described as from lasting less than a few seconds to instantaneous. Accounts differ as to what phase of a near-death experience a review might take place in.\n\nSubjects frequently describe their experience as panoramic, 3-D or holographic. During a life review, the subject's perception is reported to include not only their own perspective in increased vividness, as if they were reliving a given episode itself, but that of all other parties they interact with at each point being reviewed. \n\nThe term 3D is employed to approximate the inclusion of different physical perspectives onto a scene; the intensity of a life review was described by one individual as enabling him to count every nearby mosquito; but equally common is the description of feeling the emotional experience of the other parties, including in one case virtually everyone in a room. While some accounts appear to describe scenes as selected, others more commonly narrate the experience as including things they had, probably naturally, long ago entirely forgotten, with \"nothing left out\". Experiencers commonly describe the intense vividness and detail as making them feel more alive than when normally conscious:\n\nThe effect of a life review is often a strongly transformative experience. Experiencers describe them as extremely unpleasant from the perspective of the unhappiness they had inflicted on others, including feelings they had never dreamed of as resulting, and equally pleasant from the perspective of the good feeling they had brought to others' lives, extending to the littlest forgotten details. To some extent, this experience resembles purgatory. The Tibetan Buddhist understanding can be found in The Tibetan Book of The Dead, and is known as \"Bardo Thodol\" (the stage between life and afterlife).\n\nExperiencers often report a sharp drop in materialistic outlook (both acquisitive and philosophical), an intensified compassion for others and sense of interconnectedness, newfound altruistic activities, personality changes (though occasionally entailing divorce), a new interest in self-education and spirituality, and so on. Dannion Brinkley as one instance described himself as putting off previously deep-rooted sociopathic traits ingrained from a difficult childhood through his work as a sniper in the Vietnam War. A frequent comment by experiencers is that they later strongly avoided unethical or inconsiderate actions because they wanted to avoid painfully reliving the receiving end of the action which they knew would await them.\n\nThe transformative effect is in fact so statistically uniform in comparison with other areas of demographic study that some near-death experience investigators point to it as much as to experiencer accounts' detail as evidence for the empirical reality of the phenomenon itself. Kenneth Ring's book \"Lessons from the Light\" includes numerous accounts of a near-death experience permitting people hitherto blind, including cases from birth, as enabled to see (and interpret) vision during the experience.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "72819", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=72819", "title": "Mass murder", "text": "Mass murder\n\nMass murder is the act of murdering a number of people, typically simultaneously or over a relatively short period of time and in close geographic proximity. The FBI defines mass murder as murdering four or more persons during an event with no \"cooling-off period\" between the murders. A mass murder typically occurs in a single location where one or more people kill several others. \n\nA mass murder may be committed by individuals or organizations whereas a spree killing is committed by one or two individuals. Mass murderers differ from spree killers, who kill at two or more locations with almost no time break between murders and are not defined by the number of victims, and serial killers, who may kill people over long periods of time. Mass murder is a hypernym of genocide, which requires additional criteria.\n\nMany terrorist groups in recent times have used the tactic of killing many victims to fulfill their political aims. Such incidents have included the Beirut barracks bombings in October 1983 by IJO, the Başbağlar attack by the PKK in 1993, the September 11 attacks in September 2001, the 2004 Madrid train bombings in May 2004 by Al-Qaeda, Mumbai attacks in November 2008 by Lashkar-e-Taiba, and the November 2015 Paris attacks in November 2015 by ISIL.\n\nCertain cults, especially religious cults, have committed a number of mass killings and mass murder-suicides. These include Jim Jones' Peoples Temple in Jonestown, Guyana, where 919 people died in 1978; the Order of the Solar Temple in Canada, Switzerland, and France, where 75 died in 1994, 1995, and 1997; Shoko Asahara's Aum Shinrikyo, which killed 12 in Tokyo, Japan, in 1995; Marshall Applewhite's Heaven's Gate in San Diego, California, where 39 died in 1997; and the Movement for the Restoration of the Ten Commandments of God in Uganda, where 778 died in 2000.\n\nMass murderers may fall into any of a number of categories, including killers of family, of coworkers, of students, and of random strangers. Their motives for murder vary. A notable motivation for mass murder is revenge, but other motivations are possible, including the need for attention or fame.\n\nExamples of mass murderers include Mohamed Lahouaiej-Bouhlel, Anders Behring Breivik, Timothy McVeigh, Jack Gilbert Graham, Adam Lanza, Seung-Hui Cho, Devin Patrick Kelley, Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, Julio González, Robert Steinhäuser, Pekka-Eric Auvinen, Matti Juhani Saari, Thomas Watt Hamilton, Tim Kretschmer, Richard Speck, Marc Lépine, Aaron Alexis, William Unek, Friedrich Leibacher, Campo Elías Delgado, Derrick Bird, Jeff Weise, Jiverly Antares Wong, Farda Gadirov, Michael McLendon, Woo Bum-kon, Martin Bryant, Ahmed Ibragimov, Alexandre Bissonnette, Baruch Goldstein, Wellington Menezes de Oliveira, Robert Bales, Jared Lee Loughner, David A. Burke, Omar Thornton, James Huberty, Andrew Kehoe, Christopher Harper-Mercer, Charles Lightoller, George Hennard, Stephen Paddock, Omar Mateen, Nidal Hasan, James Holmes, Dylann Roof, Andreas Lubitz, Nikolas Cruz, Dimitrios Pagourtzis, Vladislav Roslyakov and Elliot Rodger.\n\nActing on the orders of Joseph Stalin, Vasili Blokhin's war crime killing of 7,000 Polish prisoners of war, shot in 28 days, is notable as one of the most organized and protracted mass murders by a single individual on record.\n\nAnalysis of the Columbine High School massacre and other incidents where law enforcement officers waited for backup has resulted in changed recommendations regarding what victims, bystanders, and law enforcement officers should do. Average response time by law enforcement to a mass shooting is typically much longer than the time the shooter is engaged in killing. While immediate action may be extremely dangerous, it may save lives which would be lost if victims and bystanders involved in the situation remain passive, or law enforcement response is delayed until overwhelming force can be deployed. It is recommended that victims and bystanders involved in the incident take active steps to flee, hide, or fight the shooter and that law enforcement officers present or first arriving at the scene attempt immediately to engage the shooter. In many instances, immediate action by victims, bystanders, or law enforcement officers has saved lives.\n\nCommentators have pointed out that there are a wide variety of ways that homicides with more than several victims might be classified. Such incidents can be, and have been even in recent decades, classified many different ways including \"as a \"mass shooting\"; as a \"school shooting\"; as \"mass murder\"; as \"workplace violence\"...; as \"a crime involving an assault rifle\"; as \"a case of a mentally ill person committing acts of violence\"; and so on.\"\n\nHow such rarely occurring incidents of homicide are classified tends to change significantly with time. \"In the 1960s and 1970s... it was understood that the key feature of [a number of such] cases was a high body count. These early discussions of mass murder lumped together [a variety of] cases that varied along what would come to be seen as important dimensions:\nIn the late decades of the 20th century and early years of the 2000s, the most popular classifications moved to include method, time and place.\nWhile such classifications may assist in gaining human meaning, as human-selected categories, they can also carry significant meaning and reflect a particular point of view of the commentator who assigned the descriptor.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "6583790", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6583790", "title": "Namus", "text": "Namus\n\nNāmūs is the Arabic word (Greek \"νόμος\") of a concept of an ethical category, a virtue, in Middle Eastern patriarchal character. Literally translated as \"virtue\", it is now more popularly used in a strong gender-specific context of relations within a family described in terms of honor, attention, respect/respectability, and modesty.\n\nThe concept of \"namus\" in respect to sexual integrity of family members is an ancient, exclusively cultural concept which predates Islam, Judaism, and Christianity.\n\nThe Arabic word \"nāmūs\" () may mean \"law\", \"custom\" or \"honor\". The Ancient Greek word \"nómos\" (νόμος) means \"law, custom\".\n\n\"Namus\" has been translated into English from the Turkish language with different meanings. Honor is used to mean \"namus\" in the English language translation of Filiz Kardam's 2005 paper on \"namus cinayetleri\" (literally \"namus\" murders), but Nüket Kardam has written that chastity is a more accurate translation than honor. By the latter definition, honor is seen as an imperfect translation because the concept of \"namus\" implies the idea that men have a right to insist on feminine chastity. This is built into the legal system which permits reduced sentences for honor killings. \n\nThe Turkish language has multiple words to describe related concepts of honor including \"namus\", \"onur\" and \"şeref\". Though \"namus\" is often understood as feminine sexual virtue or chastity, this definition is becoming outdated amongst some members of Turkish society. The official definition of \"namus\" from the Foundation of Turkish Language is \"the attachment of a society to moral rules\". \n\nWomen's premarital virginity is still regarded as a matter of honor by some families. These cultural perceptions persist in modern metropolitan areas, as well as in the more traditional areas of the rural countryside. Some old-fashioned customs continue to endure, such as requiring proof of virginity in the form of blooded sheets, or in some cases by medical examination. Though Kemalism has contributed to the rapid modernization of the country in many aspects, traditional sexual mores have proven to be resilient. Even those families who encouraged their daughters to pursue professional careers as teachers, doctors or lawyers maintained the expectation that these women would continue to conduct themselves virtuously as \"dedicated mothers, and modest housewives\".\n\nIn some societies, e.g., in Pashtun tribes of Afghanistan, \"namus\" goes beyond the basic family and is common for a \"plarina\", a unit of the tribe that has a common ancestral father.\n\nThe \"namus\" of a man is violated if, for example, a daughter is born into the family instead of a son, or if an adult daughter is not dressed \"appropriately\", or if he tolerates an offense without reaction.\n\nAmong Pashtuns an encroachment on a man's plot of land also signifies violation of his \"namus\".\n\nAccording to those who adhere to this concept, a man is supposed to control the women in his family. If he loses control of them (his wife, sisters, daughters), his \"namus\" is lost in the eyes of the community and he has to cleanse his (and his family's) honor. This is often done by abortion, murder or forced suicide.\n\nIn the Western world, such cases are especially visible in immigrant societies when a girl faces the conflict between her choice of the culture of the new home society and the traditions of the old home.\n\nIn cases of rape, the woman is not seen as a victim. Instead, it is considered that the \"namus\" of the whole family has been violated, and to restore it, an honor killing of the raped woman may happen (estimated 5,000 victims yearly and on the rise worldwide). The raped woman may also commit forced suicide. In Pakistan, acid is often thrown on the victim's face to disfigure her as an alternative to murder.\n\nIn British Bangladeshi immigrant culture and in Anatolian Turkish culture the violation of namus can result in the murder of the male involved with the female family member.\n\nMeanwhile, in cases of \"namus\" loss due to the arrival of a female child into the family, infanticide or sex-selective abortion may occur.\n\nThe United Nations Commission on Human Rights gathered reports from several countries and considering only the countries that submitted reports it was shown that honor killings have occurred in Bangladesh, Great Britain, Brazil, Ecuador, Egypt, India, Israel, Italy, Jordan, Pakistan, Morocco, Sweden, Turkey, United States, Canada and Uganda.\nIn 2002 international attention was drawn to the murder of Fadime Şahindal, of the Kurdish minority in Sweden, who violated \"namus\" by suing her father and brother for threats made against her and then rejecting the marriage arranged for her.\n\nSome Jordanian Islamic groups say that punishment of adulterous wives should be left to the state, while others say Islam advocates that male relatives should carry out the punishment. Yotam Feldner writes, \"if honor killing originated in pre-Islamic Arab tribalism, it has long since been incorporated into Islamic society and thereby become common throughout the Muslim world\". However, \"'Izzat Muhaysin, a psychiatrist at the Gaza Program for Mental Health, [...] says that the culture of the society perceives one who refrains from 'washing shame with blood' as 'a coward who is not worthy of living.'\n\nHundreds, if not thousands, of women are murdered by their families each year in the name of family 'honor'.\n\nThe 1925 Armenian silent film \"Namus\" tells the ill fate of two lovers, who were betrothed by their families to each other since childhood, but because of violations of \"namus\", the girl was married by her father to another person. In 2006 it was restored, digitized and dubbed in French. Abdullah Goran (1904–1962), the modern Kurdish poet, condemned honour killing in his poem \"Berde-nûsêk\" (\"A Tomb-Stone\").\n\nIn France and in Germany, where there is a large Middle Eastern Muslim diaspora, the women sometimes may resort cosmetic surgery.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "56165296", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=56165296", "title": "Paulette Gebara Farah", "text": "Paulette Gebara Farah\n\nPaulette Gebara Farah (20 July 2005 – 22 March 2010) was a four-year-old Mexican girl, with a physical disability and a language disorder, who was found dead in her room in her family home located in Huixquilucan, State of Mexico, on 31 March 2010.\n\nPaulette was reported to have disappeared from her home on 22 March 2010, and her family began a campaign through media, advertisements, and social networks to find Paulette. Paulette's body was “accidentally” found in her own room wrapped in sheets between the mattress of her bed and the foot, the same place where her mother had offered interviews, and where experts from various agencies and even dogs trained to find her had come. However, no one noticed the existence of the corpse, until it was discovered on 31 March due to the smell of putrefaction. Her death was ruled \"accidental\" by Alberto Bazbaz, attorney general for the state of Mexico, who said his investigation concluded that Paulette died during the night after she turned herself around in bed, ended up at the foot, and died by a suffocation described as \"mechanical asphyxia by obstruction of the nasal cavities and thorax-abdominal compression\".\n\nPaulette's body was buried at Panteón Francés in Mexico City in 2010, before her remains were exhumed and cremated on 3 May 2017, after authorities considered that the remains were no longer objects of evidence for the investigation of the case.\n\nOn the night of Sunday 21 March 2010, Paulette arrived from Valle de Bravo to her home, located in Huixquilucan, accompanied by her sister and her father, Mauricio Gebara. The mother of the girls, Lizette Farah, awaited their arrival to put them to bed, which she did.\n\nOn the morning of 22 March one of Paulette's two nannies, Erika, entered the room to wake her, but finding her to be apparently missing she notified Mrs. Lizette and began a search in the building located on Hacienda del Cuervo street. Mauricio Gebara notified his sister of the disappearance of his daughter, and his sister informed the Huixquilucan authorities. Later, the mayor notified the Attorney General of State of Mexico.\n\nAfter the initial search of the apartment building, Paulette's family claimed they could not find her. There were no signs of theft or kidnapping; the locks were intact, as were the windows and all entries to the home. The housing complex had surveillance, but no evidence of Paulette leaving or being taken were found. Paulette could not go out alone, they said, due to a motor and language disability.\n\nIn the afternoon, the Attorney General of the State of Mexico disseminated a poster with a photo of Paulette and some information about her age, appearance and physical deficiencies. Paulette's aunt, Arlette Farah, sent mailings and uploaded the photo of the girl to social networks, where the news quickly spread, prompting a large response. In the evening, Lizette Farah called the alleged abductor, asked that her daughter be returned to her that she be left in a shopping center or a crowded place and assured, on television, that there would be no reprisals. Lizette did not cry, but she looked nervous in the videos. After the announcement, she distributed flyers with Paulette's face, she had billboards put up, as well as advertisements on television and public transport.\n\nMauricio also appeared in the media, asking that his daughter be returned to him. He recalled that he had gone out to work on the morning of Monday 22 March, when Paulette had apparently disappeared. On 29 March, The Attorney General of the State of Mexico announced that Mauricio Gebara and Lizette Farah, parents of Paulette, as well as the sisters Erika and Martha Casimiro, Paulette's nannies, would be placed under a restriction order due to falsehoods and inconsistencies in the statements.\n\nOn 30 March, Paulette's parents spent a few hours at the Procuraduría Mexiquense, and then they were transferred to a hotel where they would fulfill their restriction order. That same day, experts from the unit placed blankets at the home to carry out the reconstruction of the events with the presence of the parents.\n\nOn 31 March at around 2:00 am, Paulette's dead body was found in her bedroom, where previously experts had come with trained dogs and where her mother had given interviews. Paulette had died accidentally due to \"mechanical asphyxia due to obstruction of the nasal cavities and thorax-abdominal compression\", said Alberto Bazbaz.\n\nAn autopsy revealed that Paulette slept with an \"orthopedic cloth\" over her mouth, which was placed every night to prevent her from sleeping with her mouth open; that her body was not manipulated after her death; and that she had eaten food at least five hours before her death. The corpse had two segments of rectangular adhesive cloth in vertical position on both cheeks, in addition to signs of a blow to the left elbow and knee. The findings revealed no signs of physical or sexual violence. The autopsy also established that her death occurred between five and nine days before the analysis was made. This was reported on 31 March, although they failed to reveal the exact date and hour of her death.\n\nThe investigators also found no traces of drugs or toxic substances in the body that could have affected the girl's consciousness. The conclusion was that Paulette \"by her own means\" moved on the bed and accidentally fell headlong into a space at the foot of her bed, where she died of asphyxiation, and subsequently remained there unnoticed for nine days.\n\nOn 3 April, Paulette's mother, Lizette Farah, initiated an amparo proceeding against the restriction order, claiming that she had not been involved in the events that caused her daughter's death. Specialists indicated that the woman suffered from personality disorders. During the procedure, Mrs. Farah became subject to indictment. On 4 April a judge granted freedom to Paulette's parents and nannies. Mauricio Gebara left the hotel where he was staying at 10:20; Lizette Farah, main suspect, at 11:00; and the nannies, Erika and Martha Casimiro, at noon. None could leave the country because the inquiries continued. On 5 April, in separate interviews, Mauricio Gebara and Lizette Farah accused each other, Lizette claiming that her husband blamed her for Paulette's death, Mauricio that the death could not have been just an accident and that he could not put his hands in the fire for his wife.\n\nOn 6 April, Paulette's body was buried at Panteón Francés in Mexico City. The funeral procession was headed by the girl's mother; the Gebara family did not go to the burial for an \"agreement\".\n\nOn 7 April, The Gebara family denied Lizette Farah's request to see her other daughter, Lizette, seven years old, who had stayed with her father's family since Sunday, 4 April. On 10 May, The Attorney General of the Federal District, who also collaborated in the case at the request of her counterpart in the State of Mexico, granted the custody of Paulette's sister to her mother, Lizette Farah, who brought a complaint against her husband demanding custody of the girl. On 26 May, although Alberto Bazbaz defended the investigation and conclusions of the case, he resigned his position as head of the Attorney General of the State of Mexico, saying that a Procuraduría needs confidence to act effectively and that he had lost this confidence due to the questioning of his actions in the investigation of the death of Paulette Gebara Farah.\n\nMore than seven years later on 3 May 2017, Paulette's body was exhumed from her grave and cremated, since authorities considered that her remains were no longer objects of evidence for the investigation of the case.\n\nPaulette's nannies, Ericka and Martha Casimiro, insisted that the girl's body was not under her mattress, with Casimiro stating:\n\nand Ericka stating:\n\nDuring the investigation of the case, a recording between Paulette's mother, Lizette, and her then 7-year-old sister, also named Lizette, was released, in which she tells her daughter not to say anything of Paulette's disappearance, so that they would not be blamed, with the following words:\n\nAt first Lizette denied this, saying that the recording was edited so it sounded like she was telling her daughter to hide any information. Later, however, she accepted that these were the words she said, stating, \"I had the conversation with my daughter, but not in the context they showed it.\"\n\nIn 2010 via YouTube, a video entitled 'El extraño caso de la pijama de Paulette' (Spanish for: 'The strange case of Paulette's pajamas') with photographs of her body dressed in pajamas with reindeer figures, taken by experts and disseminated in some media, seconds later, they show a video of an interview with the mother of the little girl made by the program Hechos de Fuerza Informativa Azteca in which the same pajamas appear on the girl's bed.\n\n"}

It generally includes a pre-conception risk assessment for any potential complications of pregnancy as well as modifications of risk factors, such as increasing folic acid intake to reduce the risk of neural tube defects and counseling on smoking cessation, alcohol reduction, and medications that may compromise fetal development. Physicians, midwives and baby experts recommend that a woman visit them as soon as the woman is contemplating having a child, and optimally around 3 to 6 months before actual attempts are made to conceive. This time frame allows a woman to better prepare her body for successful conception (fertilization) and pregnancy, and allows her to reduce any health risks which are within her control. Agencies such as the March of Dimes have developed screening tools that healthcare providers can use with their patients. In addition, obstetricians or midwives (see Obstetrics, Midwifery, General Practitioner) have developed comprehensive check-lists and assessments for the woman who is planning to become pregnant.\n\nIn one sense, pre-conception counseling and assessment can be compared to a well-baby visit in which a baby is screened for normal health, normal development, with the benefit of identifying emerging problems that may have gone unnoticed in an infant. For a woman, the Pre-Conception Counseling Assessment and Screening is intended to assess normal health of a child-bearing woman, while at the same time identifying:\n\n\nA common obstacle to pre-conception counseling and assessment is that many pregnancies are still unplanned. Globally, 38% of pregnancies are unintended. For this reason, many experts recommend that all women of childbearing age be offered preconception care counseling regardless of intent to become pregnant.\n\nAnother common obstacle to pre-conception counseling and assessment is of women not knowing, realizing, or understanding the benefits of visiting their physician or midwife before trying to become pregnant. Most women still take for granted the biological aspects of becoming pregnant, and do not consider the value of pre-screening before becoming pregnant. Most women who want and anticipate having a baby are naturally prone to thinking in terms of having a well baby. In the majority of cases, women do not think about having a baby who has any kind of problem. Most women do not know how their own medical history could pose risks to a developing fetus. Likewise, they may not understand that pregnancy carries a certain number of risks as well. When family history risks and pregnancy risks are considered together, it may point to potential problems for that particular woman, or to her unborn baby once she becomes pregnant.\n\nPre-screening covers many body-system areas (not just the reproductive organs), as well as aspects of the woman's lifestyle, and family history information. It begins with basic information and becomes more in-depth, especially if the woman has had previous illnesses, diseases, etc. Pre-screening assessments begin with a questionnaire which the woman fills out, generally before seeing the physician or midwife. Some offices have the woman go over parts of the questionnaire with a Nurse Practitioner, if available.\n\nCertain blood work may be ordered. This often includes a CBC (Complete Blood Count) which can show anemia. A CBC includes WBC (White Blood Cell Count) which can show the presence of infection. Anemia and infection, indicating problems with the woman's overall health at that moment, can both affect a woman's ability to become pregnant at that time as well as affect the stability of the pregnancy and health of the fetus. In the majority of cases both infection and anemia can be treated once the cause is identified. Anemia may require ongoing evaluation and iron supplement.\n\nUrine sample or urinalysis can reveal the presence of proteinuria (protein in the urine), a possible indicator of infection or kidney disease, or the presence of blood which can indicate a urinary tract infection. Urinalysis might also show the presence of glucose (glycosuria), but women of child-bearing age are unlikely to have undiagnosed diabetes (this is separate from gestational diabetes that may occasionally develop during the course of a subsequent pregnancy).\n\nWhen women have pre-existing illnesses / conditions / diseases, these may add to pre-natal risks and will need ongoing evaluation. Also any medications which are used to treat these conditions will need monitored and possibly reduced or increased.\n\nThe presence of Diabetes remains a huge risk for the unborn child, and a woman will be screened specifically for this condition. Known diabetics will need monitored closely. For more information, see this online article Diabetes and Diabetic risks.\n\nA woman may need to adjust certain aspects of her health and well-being which are in her control. These usually include aspects of lifestyle, drug and alcohol use, exercise, rest and stress reduction. In addition, she may need to discontinue certain herbs or over-the-counter medications as recommended by her healthcare provider. Many physicians will also recommend pre-natal vitamins before a woman actually conceives in order to boost her overall health.\n\nPre-conception counseling in the United States is recommended to include:\n\n"}

Guards and other authorities may use verbal abuse as a means of frightening or demoralizing prisoners to make them more compliant, or simply out of sadism.\n\nPrisoners are sometimes intentionally housed with inmates known to have raped other prisoners, or protection from known rapists may be purposely withheld from the prisoners.

{"id": "32458701", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=32458701", "title": "Program for Torture Victims", "text": "Program for Torture Victims\n\nThe Program for Torture Victims (PTV) is a non-profit organization that provides medical, psychological, case management and legal services to torture survivors. PTV serves more than 300 victims of state-sponsored torture from over 65 countries annually.\n\nThe Program for Torture Victims (PTV) was founded in 1980 by Dr. José Quiroga and Ana Deutsch.\n\nQuiroga and Deutsch, both who sought asylum in the United States, met in Los Angeles in 1979. They began working on a campaign against torture with the Los Angeles Amnesty International Medical Group. The organization was conducting a study documenting cases of torture and the consequences for refugees and asylum-seekers in the United States. Quiroga assessed the medical consequences of torture while Deutsch assessed the victims' psychological well-being. However, Amnesty International decided that they, as an organization, were unable to provide direct treatment to torture survivors. Quiroga and Deutsch knew that the torture survivors with whom they had been working needed rehabilitation services and decided to start the Program for Torture Victims.\n\nAfter the study by the Amnesty International Medical Group was completed, Quiroga presented it to the American Psychological Association. This was among the first research on the medical and psychological consequences of torture. Quiroga and Deutsch quickly became known as professionals treating victims of torture. It wasn’t until 1987, years after PTV began, that the United Nations Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment was enforced and torture was legally recognized and defined for the first time\n\nQuiroga and Deutsch began to treat clients in local clinics and in their own homes. Partnering with organizations such as Clinica Monseñor Oscar A. Romero, El Rescate, CARECEN and Amanecer, PTV quickly became well known in the Central American refugee community. Quiroga, having already been a volunteer at Venice Family Clinic for years, formed a partnership in which he was able to use their facilities to see PTV patients. Based in a small apartment at the time, Venice Family Clinic is now the largest community clinic in the U.S. and still home to PTV’s medical office.\n\nIn 1994, PTV received its first grant from the United Nations Voluntary Fund for Victims of Torture and was incorporated as a 501 (c)3 non-profit organization. Several years later, in 2000, PTV received a federal grant for $2 million over a four-year period, allowing PTV to add staff and relocate the administrative office from Ms. Deutsch’s home to downtown Los Angeles. With paid staff and a central office, PTV was finally able to expand its scope to include areas like research and evaluation.\n\nAccording to a report by the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program (USRAP), 48,217 refugees were admitted into the U.S. in 2007. Of that total, 2,619 (5.43%) resettled in Florida, 2,978 (6.18%) relocated to New York and 6,699 (13.89%) chose to resettle in California; making California home to more incoming refugees than the next two states combined. Of all those who sought to make California their new home, 4,645 (69%) resettled in the five counties PTV serves - Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino, and Ventura. Out of all of the counties in California, The Los Angeles Federal Immigration Court had greatest number of asylum seekers with 4,064. Between 2002 and 2008, the L.A. Federal Immigration Court adjudicated the highest number of asylum applications of any immigration court in California with 69,172 cases - 63% of the state total. As states, Florida and New York had 75,499 and 73,746 applications for asylum, respectively; just a fraction more than L.A. County alone.\n\nThe demographic makeup of PTV's client population is ever-changing, as global, regional, and national sociopolitical dynamics are constantly in flux. Thus far, PTV has served clients from over 65 countries.\n\nThe Program for Torture Victims (PTV) has developed an integrated, comprehensive approach to rehabilitation. Clients see a PTV case manager, physician and psychotherapist. PTV partners with some of the region’s leading service providers, including the Venice Family Clinic, Clinica Oscar Romero, the Legal Aid Foundation of Los Angeles and Public Counsel, among others.\n\nClients are evaluated by a PTV physician. When specialized procedures are needed, a wide network of physicians at the Venice Family Clinic and other local health care organizations are utilized at no cost to the client. PTV also offers ongoing consultation and trains health and mental health care providers on treating survivors of torture.\n\nPTV uses an integrated approach to rehabilitation that addresses the needs of torture survivors. This includes psychological evaluation, individual and family psychotherapy, psychiatric evaluation and follow-up, and psychological affidavits for asylum seekers in immigration court.\n\nMost of PTV's clients seek refuge in the United States as asylum seekers. As the largest port of entry to torture survivors, Los Angeles has the highest number of asylum claims filed in the United States.\n\nPTV's staff prepares forensic medical and psychological evaluations and serve as expert witnesses in federal immigration court. Reliving horrific experiences through testimony can be extremely traumatic to the survivor. The PTV clinical staff prepares the client for the emotional responses they might have on the stand. The presence of a trusted PTV volunteer or staff member can provide the extra moral support a client needs to answer questions clearly and in the necessary detail about the experience.\n\nPTV also works with an extensive network of attorneys to ensure legal assistance for clients.\n\nPTV provides emergency assistance with referrals for temporary shelter, food and other basic needs, as well as support in finding permanent housing and good jobs. They have also established support groups that create a sense of community for clients, address their various needs and help them become spokespeople against torture.\n\nSocial Services offered:\n\nPTV is a resource for research information on torture survivors. They have created an extensive database with information on treatment outcomes for torture survivors, and are working to create a powerful resource for lawmakers to address policy issues related to the asylum process.\n\nPTV initiates public programs to educate the general public about the use of torture worldwide and its consequences for individuals and society. They also engage elected officials and policymakers in efforts to combat torture and advocate for resources to facilitate the healing of torture survivors and their families.\n\nPTV also collaborates with local organizations to host public programs for events such as the United Nations International Day in Support of Victims of Torture.\n"}

Rider Haggard, first serialised in \"The Graphic\" magazine from October 1886 to January 1887. \"She\" was extraordinarily popular upon its release and has never been out of print.\n\nThe story is a first-person narrative that follows the journey of Horace Holly and his ward Leo Vincey to a lost kingdom in the African interior. There they encounter a primitive race of natives and a mysterious white queen named Ayesha who reigns as the all-powerful \"She\", or \"She-who-must-be-obeyed\". In this work, Rider Haggard developed the conventions of the Lost World subgenre, which many later authors emulated.\n\n\"She\" is placed firmly in the imperialist literature of nineteenth-century England, and inspired by Rider Haggard's experiences of South Africa and British colonialism. The story expresses numerous racial and evolutionary conceptions of the late Victorians, especially notions of degeneration and racial decline prominent during the \"fin de siècle\". In the figure of She, the novel notably explored themes of female authority and feminine behaviour. It has received praise and criticism alike for its representation of womanhood.\n\nA young Cambridge University professor, Horace Holly, is visited by a colleague, Vincey, who reveals that he will soon die. Vincey proceeds to tell Holly a fantastical tale of his family heritage. He charges Holly with the task of raising his young son, Leo (whom he has never seen) and gives Holly a locked iron box, with instructions that it is not to be opened until Leo turns 25. Holly agrees, and indeed Vincey is found dead the next day. Holly raises the boy as his own; when the box is opened on Leo's 25th birthday they discover the ancient and mysterious \"Sherd of Amenartas\", which seems to corroborate Leo's father's story. Holly, Leo and their servant, Job, follow instructions on the Sherd and travel to eastern Africa but are shipwrecked. They alone survive, together with their Arab captain, Mahomed; after a perilous journey into an uncharted region of the African interior, they are captured by the savage Amahagger people. The adventurers learn that the natives are ruled by a fearsome white queen, who is worshipped as \"Hiya\" or \"She-who-must-be-obeyed\". The Amahagger are curious about the white-skinned interlopers, having been warned of their coming by the mysterious queen.\n\nBillali, the chief elder of one of the Amahagger tribes, takes charge of the three men, introducing them to the ways of his people. One of the Amahagger maidens, Ustane, takes a liking to Leo and, by kissing him and embracing him publicly, weds him according to Amahagger customs. Leo, likewise, grows very fond of her.\n\nBillali tells Holly that he needs to go and report the white men's arrival to She. In his absence, some of the Amahagger become restless and seize Mahomed, intending to eat him as part of a ritual \"hot pot\". Realising what is about to happen, Holly shoots several of the Amahagger. Mahomed dies in the effort to save him from the hot pot, when a bullet passes through one of the Amahagger and kills him as well. In the ensuing struggle Leo is gravely wounded, but Ustane saves his life by throwing herself onto his prostrate body to shield him from spears. All seems lost as the Amahagger resolve to kill Ustane along with the white men but Billali returns in the nick of time and declares that the three men are under the protection of She. Leo's condition, however, worsens and he eventually nears death as Ustane faithfully attends to him.\n\nThey are taken to the home of the queen, which lies near the ruins of the lost city of Kôr, a once mighty civilisation that predated the Egyptians. The queen and her retinue live under a dormant volcano in a series of catacombs built as tombs for the people of Kôr. There, Holly is presented to the queen, a white sorceress named Ayesha. Her beauty is so great that it enchants any man who beholds it. She, who is veiled and lies behind a partition, warns Holly that the power of her splendour arouses both desire and fear, but he is dubious. When she shows herself, however, Holly is enraptured and prostrates himself before her. Ayesha reveals that she has learned the secret of immortality and that she possesses other supernatural powers including the ability to read the minds of others, a form of clairvoyance and the ability to heal wounds and cure illness; she is also revealed to have a tremendous knowledge of chemistry, but is notably unable to see into the future. She tells Holly that she has lived in the realm of Kôr for more than two millennia, awaiting the reincarnated return of her lover, Kallikrates (whom she had slain in a fit of jealous rage). Later, when Holly inadvertently and secretly discovers Ayesha in her hidden chamber, he learns that she may have some degree of power to reanimate the dead.\n\nThe next evening She visits Leo to heal him. But upon seeing his face, she is stunned and declares him to be the reincarnation of Kallikrates. She saves him and becomes jealous of Ustane. The latter is ordered to leave Leo and never to set her eyes on him again. Ustane refuses, however, and Ayesha eventually strikes her dead with magic. Despite the murder of their friend, Holly and Leo cannot free themselves from the power of Ayesha's beauty and Leo becomes bewitched. In explaining her history, Ayesha shows Leo the perfectly preserved body of Kallikrates, which she has kept with her, but she then dissolves the remains with a powerful acid, confident that Leo is indeed the reincarnation of her former lover.\n\nIn the climax of the novel, Ayesha takes the two men to see the Pillar of Fire, passing through the ruined city of Kôr into the heart of the ancient volcano. She is determined that Leo should bathe in the fire to become immortal and remain with her forever, and that together they can become the immortal and all-powerful rulers of the world. After a perilous journey, they come to a great cavern, but at the last Leo doubts the safety of entering the flame. To allay his fears, Ayesha steps into the Spirit of Life, but with this second immersion, the life-preserving power is lost and Ayesha begins to revert to her true age. Holly speculates that it may be that a second exposure undoes the effects of the previous or the Spirit of Life spews death on occasion. Before their eyes, Ayesha withers away in the fire, and her body shrinks. The sight is so shocking that Job dies in fright. Before dying, She tells Leo, \"Forget me not. I shall come again!\"\n\n\nIn 1875, Haggard was sent to Cape Town, South Africa as secretary to Sir Henry Bulwer, the lieutenant-governor of Natal. Haggard wrote in his memoirs of his aspirations to become a colonial governor himself, and of his youthful excitement at the prospects. The major event during his time in Africa was Britain's annexation of the Transvaal in 1877. Haggard was part of the expedition that established British control over the Boer republic, and which helped raise the Union flag over the capital of Pretoria on 24 May 1877. Writing of the moment, Haggard declared:\n\nHaggard had advocated the British annexation of the Boer republic in a journal article entitled \"The Transvaal\", published in the May 1877 issue of \"Macmillan's Magazine\". He maintained that it was Britain's \"mission to conquer and hold in subjection\" lesser races, \"not from thirst of conquest but for the sake of law, justice, and order\". However, Boer resistance to British rule and the resulting Anglo-Zulu war caused the imperial government in London to withdraw from pursuing British sovereignty over the South African interior. Haggard considered this to be a \"great betrayal\" by Prime Minister Gladstone and the Liberal Party, which \"no lapse of time ever can solace or even alleviate\". He became increasingly disillusioned with the realities of colonial Africa. Victorian scholar Patrick Brantlinger notes in his introduction to \"She\": \"Little that Haggard witnessed matched the romantic depictions of 'the dark continent' in boys' adventure novels, in the press, and even in such bestselling explorers' journals as David Livingstone's \"Missionary Travels and Researches in South Africa\" (1857).\"\n\nDuring his time in South Africa, Haggard developed an intense hatred for the Boers, but also came to admire the Zulus. However, his admiration of the Zulus did not extend to other African peoples; rather, he shared many of the assumptions that underlay contemporary Victorian politics and philosophy, such as those expressed by James Hunt, the President of the Anthropological Society of London: \"the Negro is inferior intellectually to the European...[and] can only be humanised and civilised by Europeans. The analogies are far more numerous between the Negro and apes, than between the European and apes.\" The Victorian belief in the inherent inferiority of the 'darker races' made them the object of a civilising impulse in the European Scramble for Africa. Although disenchanted with the colonial effort, Haggard remained committed to this ideology. He believed that the British \"alone of all the nations in the world appear to be able to control coloured races without the exercise of cruelty\".\n\nRider Haggard returned to Britain in 1881. At the time, England was increasingly beset by the social and cultural anxieties that marked the \"fin de siècle\". One of the most prominent concerns was the fear of political and racial decline, encapsulated in Max Nordau's \"Degeneration\" (1895). Barely half a century earlier, Thomas Babington Macaulay had declared \"the history of England\" to be \"emphatically the history of progress\", but late-Victorians living in the wake of Darwinian evolution had lost the earlier positivism of their age. Uncertainty over the immutability of Britain's historical identity, what historian Tim Murray has called the \"threat of the past\", was manifested in the Victorian obsession with ancient times and archaeology. Haggard was greatly interested in the ruins discovered at Zimbabwe in the 1870s. In 1896, he provided the preface to a monograph that detailed a history of the site, declaring:\n\nBy the time that Haggard began writing \"She\", society had more anxiety about the role of women. Debates regarding \"The Woman Question\" dominated Britain during the \"fin de siècle\", as well as anxieties over the increasing position and independence of the \"New Woman\". Alarm over social degeneration and societal decadence further fanned concerns over the woman's movement and female liberalisation, which challenged the traditional conception of Victorian womanhood. The role and rights of women had changed dramatically since the early part of the century, as they entered the workforce, received better education, and gained more political and legal independence. Writing in 1894, Haggard believed that marriage was the natural state for women: \"Notwithstanding the energetic repudiations of the fact that confront us at every turn, it may be taken for granted that in most cases it is the natural mission of women to marry; that – always in most cases – if they do not marry they become narrowed, live a half life only, and suffer in health of body and of mind.\" He created the character of \"She-who-must-be-obeyed\" \"who provided a touchstone for many of the anxieties surrounding the New Woman in late-Victorian England\".\n\nAccording to Haggard's daughter Lilias, the phrase \"She-who-must-be-obeyed\" originated from his childhood and \"the particularly hideous aspect\" of one rag-doll: \"This doll was something of a fetish, and Rider, as a small child, was terrified of her, a fact soon discovered by an unscrupulous nurse who made full use of it to frighten him into obedience. Why or how it came to be called She-Who-Must-Be-Obeyed he could not remember.\" Haggard wrote that \"the title \"She\"\" was taken \"from a certain rag doll, so named, which a nurse at Bradenham used to bring out of some dark recess in order to terrify those of my brothers and sisters who were in her charge.\"\n\nIn his autobiography, Haggard spoke of how he composed \"She\" within a six-week period of February and March 1886, having just completed \"Jess\", which was published in 1887. Haggard claimed that this period was an intensely creative moment: the text \"was never rewritten, and the manuscript carries but few corrections\". Haggard went on to declare: \"The fact is that it was written at white heat, almost without rest, and that is the best way to compose.\" He admitted to having had no clear story in mind when he began writing:\n\nVarious scholars have detected a number of analogues to \"She\" in earlier literature. According to Brantlinger, Haggard certainly read and was aware of the stories of Edward Bulwer-Lytton, in particular \"A Strange Story\" (1862) which includes a mysterious, veiled woman called \"Ayesha\", and \"The Coming Race\" (1871) about the discovery of a subterranean civilisation. Similarly, the name of the underground civilisation in \"She\", known as Kôr, is derived from Norse mythological romance, where the \"deathbed\" of the goddess Hel is called Kör and means \"disease\" in Old Norse. In \"She\", a plague destroyed the original inhabitants of Kôr.\n\nAccording to Haggard, he wrote the final scene of Ayesha's demise while waiting for his literary agent, A. P. Watt, to return to his offices. Upon completion, he entered Watt's office and threw the manuscript \"...on the table with the remark: 'There is what I shall be remembered by'\".\n\nAn obscure reference to \"She\" appears in Lieut. George Witton's 1907 book, \"Scapegoats of the Empire; The True Story of the Bushveldt Carbineers\":\n\n\"She\" was first published as a serial story in the \"Graphic\", a large folio magazine printed weekly in London, between October 1886 and January 1887. The serialisation was accompanied with illustrations by E. K. Johnson. An American edition was published by Harper and Bros. in New York on 24 December 1886; this included the Johnson illustrations. On 1 January 1887, an English edition was published by Longmans, Green, and Co., but without any images. It was the first publication of \"She\" in book format, and featured significant textual revisions from the \"Graphic\" serial made by Haggard. He made further revisions for an 1888 edition, which included illustrations by Maurice Greiffenhagen and C. H. M. Kerr. In 2006 a Broadview publication of \"She\" became the first edition to reproduce the \"Graphic\" serial text since 1887.\n\nHaggard contended that romances such as \"She\" or \"King Solomon's Mines\" were best left unrevised, because \"wine of this character loses its bouquet when it is poured from glass to glass.\" However, he made a number of alterations to the original \"Graphic\" version of \"She\" before its publication as a novel in 1887. One of the most significant was to the third chapter concerning the sherd, which was substantially expanded from the original to include the tale of Amenartas in uncial and cursive Greek scripts. Facsimile illustrations were also included of an antique vase, made-up by Haggard's sister-in-law Agnes Barber to resemble the sherd of Amenartas. A number of footnotes were also included containing historical references from the narrator. Haggard was keen to stress the historicity of the narrative, improving some of the information about geography and the history of ancient civilisations in chapters 4, 13, and 17.\n\nThe 1887 novel also featured a substantial rewrite of the \"hotpot\" scene in chapter eight, when Mahomed is killed. In the original serialisation of \"She\", the cannibal Amahagger grow restless and hungry and place a large heated pot over the head of Mahomed, enacting the hotpotting ritual before eating him. Haggard's stories were criticised at the time for their violence, and he toned down this scene for the novel publication. The novel revised the hotpotting incident, with Mahomed dying instead when Holly shoots him accidentally in the scuffle with the Amahagger. Comparing the serial and novel editions of \"She\", Stauffer describes the more compact narrative of the original as a reflection of the intense but short burst of creativity in which Haggard composed the story, arguing that \"the style and grammar of the \"Graphic\" [edition] is more energetic and immediate\", although as he noted, \"sometimes more flawed\".\n\nHaggard continued to revise \"She\" for later publications, with the \"New Edition\" of 1888 containing over 400 minor alterations. The last revision by Haggard to be published was in 1896.\n\n\"She\" is one of the foundational works of fantasy literature, coming around the time of \"The Princess and the Goblin\" (1858) by George MacDonald, William Morris' \"The Wood Beyond the World\" and \"The Well at the World's End\", and the short stories of Lord Dunsany. It is marked by a strong element of \"the marvelous\" in the figure of Ayesha, a two-thousand-year-old sorceress, and the 'Spirit of the World', an undying fire that confers immortality. Indeed, Haggard's story is one of the first in modern literature to feature \"a slight intrusion of something unreal\" into a very real world – a hallmark of the fantasy genre. Similarly, the carefully constructed \"fantasy history\" of \"She\" foreshadows the use of this technique that characterises later fantasies such as \"The Lord of the Rings\" and \"The Wheel of Time\" series, and which imparts a \"degree of security\" to the secondary world. However, the story of \"She\" is firmly ensconced in what fantasy theorists call 'primary world reality', with the lost kingdom of Kôr, the realm ruled by the supernatural She, a fantastic \"Tertiary World\" at once directly part of and at the same time indirectly set apart from normative \"primary\" reality. Along with Haggard's prior novel, \"King Solomon's Mines\", \"She\" laid the blueprints for the \"Lost World\" subgenre in fantasy literature, as well as the convention of the \"lost race\". As Brantlinger has noted of the novel's importance to the development of the \"secondary world\" in fantasy literature: \"Haggard may seem peripheral to the development of science fiction, and yet his African quest romances could easily be transposed to other planets and galaxies\". In his history of science fiction, \"Billion Year Spree\", Brian Aldiss notes the frequency with which Ayesha's death in the Pillar of Fire has been imitated by later science fiction and fantasy writers: \"From Haggard on, crumbling women, priestesses, or empresses – all symbols of women as Untouchable and Unmakeable – fill the pages of many a scientific romance\".\n\n\"She\" is part of the adventure subgenre of literature which was especially popular at the end of the 19th century, but which remains an important form of fiction to the present day. Along with works such as \"Treasure Island\" (1883) and \"Prince Otto\" (1885) by Robert Louis Stevenson, and Jules Verne's \"A Journey to the Center of the Earth\" (1871) and \"Around the World in Eighty Days\" (1875), \"She\" had an important formative effect on the development of the adventure novel. Indeed, Rider Haggard is credited with inventing the romance of archaeological exploration which began in \"King Solomon's Mines\" and crystallised in \"She\". One of the most notable modern forms of this genre is the \"Indiana Jones\" movie series, as well as the Tarzan novels by Edgar Rice Burroughs and recently Alan Moore's \"The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen\" (2000). In such fictional narratives the explorer is the hero, with the drama unfolding as they are cast into \"the nostrum of the living past\". Holly and Leo are prototypes of the adventurer, who has become a critical figure in modern fiction.\n\n\"She\" is also one of the central texts in the development of Imperial Gothic. Many late-Victorian authors during the \"fin de siècle\" employed Gothic conventions and motifs in their writing, stressing and alluding to the supernatural, the ghostly, and the demonic. As Brantlinger has noted, \"Connected to imperialist adventure fiction, these interests often imply anxieties about the stability of Britain, of the British Empire, or, more generally, of Western civilisation\". Novels like \"Dracula\" and \"Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde\" present depictions of repressed, foreign, and demonic forces at the heart of the imperial polity. In \"She\" the danger is raised in the form of Ayesha herself:\n\nShe's threat to replace Queen Victoria with herself echoes the underlying anxiety over imperialism and European colonialism emblematic of the Imperial Gothic genre. Indeed, Judith Wilt characterises the narrative of \"She\", in which British imperialist penetration of Africa (represented by Holly, Leo, and Job) suddenly suffers a potential \"counter-attack\" (from Ayesha), as one of the archetypal illustrations of the \"reverse colonalism\" motif in Victorian Gothic. Similarly, \"She\" marks one of the first fictional examples to raise the spectre of the natural decline of civilisation, and by extension, British imperial power, which would become an increasingly frequent theme in Gothic and invasion literature until the onset of World War I.\n\nRider Haggard's writing style was the source of much criticism in reviews of \"She\" and his other works. His harshest critic was Augustus Moore, who wrote \"God help English literature when English people lay aside their Waverley novels, and the works of Defoe, Swift, Thackeray, Charlotte Brontë, George Eliot, and even Charles Reade for the penny dreadfuls of Mr Haggard\"; adding, \"The man who could write 'he spoke to She' can have no ear at all\". A more common sentiment was expressed by the review of \"She\" in \"Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine\": \"Mr. Rider Haggard is not an exquisite workman like Mr. [Robert Louis] Stevenson, but he has a great deal of power in his way, and rougher qualities which are more likely, perhaps, to 'take the town' than skill more delicate\".\n\nModern literary criticism has tended to be more circumspect. As Victorian scholar Daniel Karlin has noted, \"That Haggard's style is frequently bathetic or clumsy cannot be denied; but the matter is not so easily settled\". Stauffer cites the passage where Holly is meditating as he tries to fall asleep as emblematic of \"the charges against\" Haggard's writing. In this scene, Holly lies down,\n\nThe passage concludes with a wry remark from Holly, \"I at last managed to get to sleep, a fact for which anybody who reads this narrative, if anybody ever does, may very probably be thankful\". According to Stauffer, \"the disarming deflation of the passage goes a long way toward redeeming it, and is typical of the winning contradictions of the narrator's style\". Tom Pocock in \"Rider Haggard and the Lost Empire\" has also highlighted the \"literary framework\" that Haggard constructs throughout much of the narrative, referencing Keats, Shakespeare, and Classical literature to imbue the story with a \"Gothic sensibility\". Yet as Stauffer notes, \"Ultimately, however, one thinks of Haggard's plots, episodes, and images as the source of his lasting reputation and influence.\n\n\"She\" is set firmly in the imperialist literature of the late-Victorian period. The so-called \"New Imperialism\" marking the last quarter of the 19th century witnessed a further expansion of British power, particularly on the African continent, and was characterised by a seemingly confident sentiment in the merits of empire and English civilisation. Thus \"She\" \"invokes a particularly British view of the world\" as Rider Haggard projects concepts of the English self against the foreign otherness of Africa. One such example occurs when Holly is first ushered into the presence of Ayesha, walking into the chamber behind a grovelling Billali who warns Holly to follow his example, or \"a surety she will blast thee where thou standest\". Indeed, \"She\" is preoccupied with stressing quintessential British qualities through the \"adventure\" of empire, usually in contrast to foreign barbarism. However, the notion of imperialism is further compounded by the figure of She, who is herself a foreign colonising force. \"In a sense then\", writes Stauffer, \"a single property line divides the realm of Queen Victoria and that of \"She-who-must-be-obeyed\", two white queens who rule dark-skinned natives of the African continent\".\n\nLike many of his Victorian contemporaries, Rider Haggard \"proceeds on the assumption that whites are naturally superior to blacks, and that Britain's imperial extensions into Africa are a noble, civilising enterprise\". Although Haggard penned a number of novels that portrayed Africans in a comparatively realistic light, \"She\" was not among their number. Even in \"King Solomon's Mines\", the representation of Umbopa (who was based on an actual warrior) and the Kukuanas, drew upon Haggard's knowledge and understanding of the Zulus. In contrast, \"She\" makes no such distinctions. Ayesha, the English travellers, and the ancient inhabitants of Kôr are all white embodiments of civilisation, while the darker Amahagger, as a people, illustrate notions of savagery, barbarity, and superstition. Nonetheless, the \"racial politics of the novel are more complex than they first appear\", given that Ayesha is in origin an ancient Arabian, Leo is descended from, and physically resembles a blond Hellenistic Greek, while Holly is said to resemble a baboon in facial appearance – an animal Victorians typically associated with black Africans. Whilst critics like Wendy Katz, Patricia Murphy, and Susan Gubar have analysed the strong racist undercurrent in \"She\", Andrew Stauffer has taken note of the qualifications through which \"the novel suggests deeper connections among the races, an ancient genealogy of ethnicities and civilizations in which every character is a hybrid\".\n\nIndeed, there is a strong Darwinian undercurrent framing the representation of race in \"She\", stemming from Haggard's own interest in evolutionary theory and archaeological history. In particular the theme of racial degeneration is a prominent aspect in the novel. Moving into the \"fin de siècle\", late-Victorians were increasingly concerned about cultural and national decline resulting from racial decay. In \"She\", this evolutionary concept of degeneration is manifested in Ayesha and the Amahagger. Haggard represents the Amahagger as a debased mixture of ethnicities, \"a curious mingling of races\", originally descended from the inhabitants of Kôr but having intermarried with Arabs and Africans. Racial hybridisation of any kind \"entailed degeneration\" to Victorians, a \"decline from the pure blood\" of the initial races, and thus \"an aspect of their degeneration is the idea that the Amahagger have lost whatever elements of civilization their Kôr ancestors may have imparted to them\". Thus, Ayesha proudly proclaims her own racial purity as a quality to be admired: \"for Arabian am I by birth, even 'al Arab al Ariba' (an Arab of the Arabs), and of the race of our father Yárab, the son of Khâtan[...] of the true Arab blood\". However, the novel's starkest evocation of the evolutionary principle occurs in the regressive demise of Ayesha. Stepping into the Pillar of Fire, the immortal She begins to wither and decay, undergoing as death what Judith Wilt describes as the \"ultimate Darwinian nightmare\", evolution in reverse.\n\nWhen Rider Haggard first conceived of \"She\" he began with the theme of \"an immortal woman inspired by an immortal love\". Although ostensibly a romance, the novel is part of the wider discourse regarding women and womanhood in late-Victorian Britain. Many scholars have noted how \"She\" was published as a book in 1887, the year of Queen Victoria's Golden Jubilee, and Adrienne Munich argues that Haggard's story \"could fittingly be considered an ominous literary monument to Victoria after fifty years of her reign\". Indeed, in her devotion to Kallikrates (two thousand years after his death), Ayesha echoes the long-lasting fidelity of Victoria to her husband, Albert. However, unlike the \"benign\" Victoria, the question of female authority is realised to the extreme in the figure of \"She-who-must-be-obeyed\", whose autonomous will seemingly embodies Victorian anti-feminist fears of New Women desiring 'absolute personal independence coupled with supreme power over men'. Haggard constantly emphasises this anxiety over female authority in \"She\", so that even the rationally minded and misogynistic Holly, who has put his \"heart away from such vanity as woman's loveliness\", ultimately falls upon his knees and worships Ayesha \"as never woman was worshipped\". Similarly, although the masculine and chivalric Leo is determined to reject Ayesha for killing the devoted native girl Ustane, he too quickly falls under her will. In fact, Ayesha's absolute command over the male sex is one of the most startling and unnerving aspects of the story.\n\nIn her role as the seductive \"femme fatale\", Ayesha is part of \"a long tradition of male fantasy that includes Homer's Circe, Shakespeare's Cleopatra, and Keats's 'La Belle Dame sans Merci'\". Brantlinger identifies the theme of \"the white (or at least light-skinned) queen ruling a black or brown-skinned savage race\" as \"a powerfully erotic one\" with its opposite being \"the image of the helpless white woman captured by savages and threatened, at least, with rape\". The figure of She both inspires male desire and dominates male sovereignty, represented in her conquest of the enlightened Victorians Holly and Leo. The two Englishmen embody the powers of manhood, with Leo a reflection of masculine physicality and Holly a representation of man's intellectual strength; but both are conquered by the feminine powers of She, who rules as much through sex-appeal as through sorcery, immortality, and will. Thus Steven Arata describes her as \"the veiled woman, that ubiquitous nineteenth-century figure of male desire and anxiety, whose body is Truth but a Truth that blasts\". Similarly, Sarah Gilbert sees the theme of feminine sexuality and authority realised in Ayesha as critical to the novel's success: \"Unlike the women earlier Victorian writers had idealised or excoriated, She was neither an angel nor a monster. Rather, She was an odd but significant blend of the two types – an angelically chaste woman with monstrous powers, a monstrously passionate woman with angelic charms\".\n\nAfter its publication in 1887 \"She\" became an immediate success. According to \"The Literary World\" \"Mr. Rider Haggard has made for himself a new field in fiction\". Comparing the novel to \"King Solomon's Mines\" the review declared: \"The book before us displays all the same qualities, and we anticipate for it a similar popularity. There is even more imagination in the later than in the earlier story; it contains scenes of greater sensuous beauty and also of more gruesome horror\". The \"Public Opinion\" was equally rapturous in its praise:\n\nThe fantasy of \"She\" received particular acclaim from Victorian readers and critics. The review appearing in \"The Academy\" on 15 January was impressed by the \"grown-up\" vision of the novel, declaring \"the more impossible it gets the better Mr. Haggard does it... his astonishing imagination, and a certain \"vraisemblance\" [\"verisimilitude\" (French)] makes the most impossible adventures appear true\". This sentiment was echoed in \"The Queen: The Lady's Newspaper\", with the reviewer pronouncing that \"this is a tale in the hands of a writer not so able as Mr. Haggard might easily have become absurd; but he has treated it with so much vividness and picturesque power as to invest it with unflagging interest, and given to the mystery a port of philosophic possibility that makes us quite willing to submit to the illusion.\n\n\"The Spectator\" was more equivocal in its appraisal of \"She\". The review described the narrative as \"very stirring\" and \"exciting\" and of \"remarkable imaginative power\", adding: \"The ingenuity of the story... is as subtle as ever romancer invented, and from the day when Leo and Holly land on the coast of Africa, to the day when the Pillar of Fire is revealed to them by the all but immortal 'She-who-must-be-obeyed', the interest of the tale rises higher and higher with every new turn in its course\". However, the review took issue with the characterisation of She and the manner of her demise: \"To the present writer there is a sense of the ludicrous in the end of \"She\" that spoiled, instead of concluding with imaginative fitness, the thread of the impossible worked into the substance of this vivid and brilliantly told story\". Haggard was moved to respond to the criticism of Ayesha's death, writing that \"in the insolence of her strength and loveliness, she lifts herself up against the Omnipotent. Therefore, at the appointed time she is swept away by It... Vengeance, more heavy because more long delayed, strikes her in her proudest part – her beauty\".\n\nA number of reviews were more critical of Haggard's work. Although the reviewer of \"She\" in \"Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine\" considered it better than \"King Solomon's Mines\", he opined, \"Mr. Rider Haggard has not proved as yet that he has anything that can be called imagination at all... It might be wrought up into an unparalleled stage effect: but it is rather a failure in pen and ink. The more fearful and wonderful such circumstances are intended to be, the more absurd is the failure of them\". Even more scathing was Augustus Moore in the May edition of \"Time: A Monthly Miscellany\", who declared: \"In Mr Haggard's book I find none of the powerful imagination, the elaborate detail, the vivid English which would entitle his work to be described as a romance... [rather] it seems to me to be the method of the modern melodrama\". Moore was particularly dismissive of the novel's style and prose: \"Mr Haggard cannot write English at all. I do not merely refer to his bad grammar, which a boy at a Boarding School would deserve to be birched for... It can only have been written by a man who not only knew nothing, but cared nothing for 'English undefiled'.\" Haggard's English was a common source of criticisms, but Moore was even dismissive of the character of She who widely garnered universal praise. \"Ayesha\", Moore declares, \"is about as impressive as the singing chambermaid who represents the naughty fairy of a pantomime in tights and a tow wig\". Concluding his review, Moore wondered at the success that had greeted \"She\":\n\nDespite such criticism, the reception that met \"She\" was overwhelmingly positive and echoed the sentiments expressed by anthropologist and literary critic Andrew Lang before the story's first publication: \"I think \"She\" is one of the most astonishing romances I ever read. The more impossible it is, the better you do it, till it seems like a story from the literature of another planet\".\n\nFeminist literary historians have tended to define the figure of She as a literary manifestation of male alarm over the \"learned and crusading new woman\". In this view, Ayesha is a terrifying and dominant figure, a prominent and influential rendering of the misogynistic \"fictive explorations of female authority\" undertaken by male writers that ushered in literary modernism. Ann Ardis, for instance, views the fears Holly harbours over Ayesha's plan to return to England as being \"exactly those voiced about the New Woman's entrance in the public arena\". According to the feminist interpretation of the narrative, the death of She acts as a kind of teleological \"judgement\" of her transgression of Victorian gender boundaries, with Ardis likening it to a \"witch-burning\". However, to Rider Haggard, \"She\" was an investigation into love and immortality and the demise of Ayesha the moral end of this exploration:\n\nIndeed, far from being a radical or threatening manifestation of womanhood, recent academics have noted the extent to which the character of She conforms to traditional conceptions of Victorian femininity; in particular her deferring devotion to Kallikrates/Leo, whom she swears wifely obedience to at the story's climax: \"'Behold!' and she took his [Leo's] hand and placed it upon her shapely head, and then bent herself slowly down till one knee for an instant touched the ground – 'Behold! in token of submission do I bow me to my lord! Behold!' and she kissed him on the lips, 'in token of my wifely love do I kiss my lord'.\" Ayesha declares this to be the \"first most holy hour of completed womanhood\".\n\n\"She\" is one of the most influential novels in modern literature, with authors like Rudyard Kipling, Henry Miller, Graham Greene, J.R.R. Tolkien, and Margaret Atwood all acknowledging the importance of the work to their own and others' writing. With over 83 million copies sold, the work is one of the biggest selling fictional titles of all time and has been translated into 44 languages. According to Stauffer, \"\"She\" has always been Rider Haggard's most popular and influential novel, challenged only by \"King Solomon's Mines\" in this regard\". Such was the popularity and influence of the novel that it was cited in the psychoanalytical theories of Sigmund Freud and Carl Jung, the latter describing the character of She as a manifestation of the anima figure.\n\nThe story is one of the most important texts of imaginative literature and had a lasting impact on the fantasy genre, directly giving rise to the 'lost civilisation' tales of Edgar Rice Burroughs and Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, and the creation of mythologised locations such as Shangri-la. Tolkien recognised the importance of \"She\" to his own fantasy works, especially in its foregrounding of a fictional history and narrative. The figure of She is also considered by many scholars to be a formative influence on Galadriel in \"The Lord of the Rings\" – Ayesha's reflecting pool seems to be a direct precursor of Galadriel's mirror. Other characters in Tolkien's Legendarium also seem to have been influenced, including Shelob (who is referred to as \"She\" and \"Her\" in the text), and the escape across the chasm is highly reminiscent of the escape of the Fellowship of the Ring across the chasm in Moria. Similarly, the Hot Pot ritual of Haggard's Amahagger people appears to have been an inspiration or predecessor of the death of Viserys Targaryen in George R. R. Martin's \"A Game of Thrones\"; and Daenerys Targaryen, Cersei Lannister, and especially Melisandre of Asshai, priestess of the god R'hllor, might be seen as characters in the tradition beginning with Ayesha. Indeed, Haggard's characterisation of Ayesha became the prototype of the female antagonist in modern fantasy literature, most famously realised in the figure of the White Witch, Jadis, from C. S. Lewis's \"The Chronicles of Narnia\". \nKor and Ayesha appear in Alan Moore's \"Nemo: Heart of Ice\". The name Ayesha is used in Marvel comics for the female superheroine Ayesha, leader of the Sovereign race, also known as Kismet. Her portrayal in the film \"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2\" 2017 as a beautiful, powerful yet ruthless and cold empress in a grand court recalls Haggard's characterisation of Ayesha.\n\n\"She\" became so well known that the novel also had influence outside of the world of fantasy literature. At the World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago (1893), the H. Jay Smith Exploring Company presented an exhibit of artifacts from the American Southwest featuring objects and human remains of the Basketmaker and Cliff Dweller (Ancestral Puebloan) Cultures. The exhibit featured a mummy preserved naturally by the southwestern climate that was given the name \"She\".\n\n\"She\" has been adapted for the cinema at least eleven times, beginning with the 1899 short film \"The Pillar of Fire\", directed by Georges Méliès. A 1911 version starred Marguerite Snow, a British-produced version appeared in 1916 and in 1917 Valeska Suratt appeared in a production for Fox which is lost. In 1925 a silent film of \"She\", starring Betty Blythe, was produced with the active participation of Rider Haggard, who wrote the intertitles. The film combines elements from all the books in the series.\n\nA decade later another cinematic version of the novel was released, featuring Helen Gahagan, Randolph Scott and Nigel Bruce. This 1935 adaptation was set in the Arctic, rather than Africa, and depicts the ancient civilisation of the story in an Art Deco style, with music by Max Steiner.\n\nThe 1965 film, \"She\", was produced by Hammer Film Productions and starred Ursula Andress as Ayesha and John Richardson as her reincarnated love, with Peter Cushing as Holly, Christopher Lee as Billali, and Bernard Cribbins as Job.\n\nIn 2001 another adaption was released direct-to-video with Ian Duncan as Leo Vincey, Ophélie Winter as Ayesha and Marie Bäumer as Roxane.\n\nTim McInnerny starred as Holly with Mia Soteriou as Ayesha and Oliver Chris as Leo in a two-part adaptation on BBC Radio 4's \"Classic Serial\", originally broadcast on 2 July and 9 July 2006.\n\nIn 2007 a rock-opera/musical version of \"She\" was recorded live at the Wyspianski Theatre, Katowice, Poland by Clive Nolan and was released on DVD. In February 2012 the Nolan version of \"She\" had its first UK performance at the Playhouse in Cheltenham.\n\nAccording to \"Financial Times\" reviewer James Lovegrove, Juliet E. McKenna's 2012 \"She-who-thinks-for-herself,\" is \"a cunning, funny... feminist rewrite\" of \"She\".\n\n\n"}

Some sources show her year of birth as 1935, but a contemporary account shows she was 23 or 24 on arrival in Britain and, as she had completed tertiary studies in Australia, the earlier date seems more likely. She was the only daughter of a Wing Commander in the RAAF.\n\nShe resided in Adelaide prior to pursuing studies at the Sydney Conservatorium of Music and/or Sydney University (as with her year of birth, accounts differ), where she studied philosophy, languages and the arts. She sung in under-graduate revues.\n\nWhile studying in Sydney she began singing at parties and private functions to support her studies, accompanying herself on the zither. Self-taught, she is said to have found the zither whilst rummaging in a cupboard as a small child. She then entered and won a Sydney radio talent quest. This led to offers of engagements on radio and in theatre and cabaret.\n\nAbicair, a typist, became popular in Sydney in the late 1940s.\n\nAround 1952, she left Sydney for London. She was photographed by a newspaper photographer looking for pretty faces while disembarking at London Airport. Her photo was spotted by a radio producer in the newspaper and within weeks this led to her appearing on BBC Television. Not much later that year she had her own programme in which she sang and played the zither. In December, she also appeared in the title role of the pantomime \"Cinderella\" with George Martin, the Casual Comedian, at the Brixton Empress Theatre. The zither was, along with her Australian-ness, to become her trademark. She released her first record \"Careless Love\" that year. In 1953 the Empire theater in Nottingham billed her as \"TV's zither girl\". During 1954 she co-starred with comedian Norman Wisdom in the film \"One Good Turn\".\n\nIn 1956, she recorded (with George Martin (later the Beatles' producer) producing) the title song for the soundtrack of the classic Australian film \"Smiley\". On 26 March 1956, Abicair appeared on BBC TV \"Off The Record\". Through the middle/late 1950s she hosted (with help from her puppet friends, Australian indigenous children, Tea Cup and Clothespeg), a series called Children's Hour, a children's TV show. In the process she became an unofficial ambassador and promoter of Australia to a generation of British children. This Australian image was reinforced by her release of records with titles such as \"(I Love You) Fair Dinkum\" and \"Botany Bay\". Her rendering of the Australian folk song \"Little Boy Fishing off a Wooden Pier\", released in 1956, become a regular on the BBCs Children's Favourites request program. During 1959 she returned to Australia briefly to record a series of television documentary films she had conceived, based on Australian folk songs, entitled \"Shirley Abicair in Australia\", for the Australian ABC TV network.\n\nIn 1961, Abicair accepted a request to perform at The Variety Club of Great Britain eighth annual Star Gala at the Festival Gardens, Battersea Park, London, Saturday 13 May 1961. In 1962, she toured the Soviet Union, and in the same year she gave a recital at the Festival Hall in London. Later that year in October she visited the United States for performances. It was in 1962 as well that her children's book, \"Tales of Tumbarumba\" was published. In June 1963, in the US, she appeared with the Smothers Brothers on Hootenanny and the panel game show \"To Tell the Truth\", with Cicely Tyson 25 March 1963. In December, for ABC Australia, she appeared on \"Comedy Bandbox\". \n\n1965 saw her put out an EP, \"\"On the Nursery Beat\", which was a number of nursery rhymes put to a Mersey beat. During 1965 she did a tour with British comedian Frankie Howerd to entertain the HMS Albion (R07) and 848 Naval Air Squadron, at Sibu airfield, Malaysia, and other British forces stationed on the Malay Peninsula and in Sarawak, Borneo, during the unrest there. This tour was filmed and later released as a TV special \"East of Howerd\"\". During 1966–67 she released a number of more mature songs on record including her version of the Gerry Goffin–Carole King song \"So Goes Love'\" and Paul Simon's \"Flowers Never Bend with the Rainfall\". She had previously, in the early 1960s, released three albums of folk songs.\n\nShe joined up with harmonica player Larry Adler in 1968 to do a children's theatre show. She began her own one-woman theatre show in 1969 at the Arts Theatre in London.\n\nIn 1971, she moved to Oregon in the United States, where she appeared in a series of college concerts with the American writer Ken Kesey. Abicair currently (2002-2007) lived in London and divides her time between Britain, the USA and Australia.\n\nNamechecked in Ian Dury’s \"Common as muck\".\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1745670", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1745670", "title": "Social choice theory", "text": "Social choice theory\n\nSocial choice theory or social choice is a theoretical framework for analysis of combining individual opinions, preferences, interests, or welfares to reach a \"collective decision\" or \"social welfare\" in some sense. A non-theoretical example of a collective decision is enacting a law or set of laws under a constitution. Social choice theory dates from Condorcet's formulation of the voting paradox. Kenneth Arrow's \"Social Choice and Individual Values\" (1951) and Arrow's impossibility theorem in it are generally acknowledged as the basis of the modern social choice theory. In addition to Arrow's theorem and the voting paradox, the Gibbard–Satterthwaite theorem, the Condorcet jury theorem, the median voter theorem, and May's theorem are among the more well known results from social choice theory.\n\nSocial choice blends elements of welfare economics and voting theory. It is methodologically individualistic, in that it aggregates preferences and behaviors of individual members of society. Using elements of formal logic for generality, analysis proceeds from a set of seemingly reasonable axioms of social choice to form a \"social welfare function\" (or \"constitution\"). Results uncovered the logical incompatibility of various axioms, as in Arrow's theorem, revealing an aggregation problem and suggesting reformulation or theoretical triage in dropping some axiom(s).\n\nLater work also considers approaches to compensations and fairness, liberty and rights, axiomatic domain restrictions on preferences of agents, variable populations, strategy-proofing of social-choice mechanisms, natural resources, capabilities and functionings, and welfare, justice, and poverty.\n\nSocial choice and public choice theory may overlap but are disjoint if narrowly construed. The Journal of Economic Literature classification codes place Social Choice under Microeconomics at (with Clubs, Committees, and Associations) whereas most Public Choice subcategories are in JEL D72 (Economic Models of Political Processes: Rent-Seeking, Elections, Legislatures, and Voting Behavior).\n\nSocial choice theory depends upon the ability to aggregate, or sum up, individual preferences into a combined social welfare function. Individual preference can be modeled in terms of an economic utility function. The ability to sum utility functions of different individuals depends on the utility functions being comparable to each other; informally, individuals' preferences must be measured with the same yardstick. Then the ability to create a social welfare function depends crucially on the ability to compare utility functions. This is called \"interpersonal utility comparison\".\n\nFollowing Jeremy Bentham, utilitarians have argued that preferences and utility functions of individuals are interpersonally comparable and may therefore be added together to arrive at a measure of aggregate utility. Utilitarian ethics call for maximizing this aggregate.\n\nLionel Robbins questioned whether mental states, and the utilities they reflect, can be measured and, \"a fortiori\", interpersonal \"comparisons\" of utility as well as the social choice theory on which it is based. Consider for instance the law of diminishing marginal utility, according to which utility of an added quantity of a good decreases with the amount of the good that is already in possession of the individual. It has been used to defend transfers of wealth from the \"rich\" to the \"poor\" on the premise that the former do not derive as much utility as the latter from an extra unit of income. Robbins (1935, pp. 138–40) argues that this notion is beyond positive science; that is, one cannot measure changes in the utility of someone else, nor is it required by positive theory.\n\nApologists of the interpersonal comparison of utility have argued that Robbins claimed too much. John Harsanyi agrees that full comparability of mental states such as utility is never possible but believes, however, that human beings are able to make some interpersonal comparisons of utility because they share some common backgrounds, cultural experiences, etc. In the example from Amartya Sen (1970, p. 99), it should be possible to say that Emperor Nero's gain from burning Rome was outweighed by the loss incurred by the rest of the Romans. Harsanyi and Sen thus argue that at least partial comparability of utility is possible, and social choice theory proceeds under that assumption.\n\nSen proposes, however, that comparability of interpersonal utility need not be partial. Under Sen's theory of informational broadening, even complete interpersonal comparison of utility would lead to socially suboptimal choices because mental states are malleable. A starving peasant may have a particularly sunny disposition and thereby derive high utility from a small income. This fact should not nullify, however, his claim to compensation or equality in the realm of social choice.\n\nSocial decisions should accordingly be based on immalleable factors. Sen proposes interpersonal utility comparisons based on a wide range of data. His theory is concerned with access to advantage, viewed as an individual's access to goods that satisfy basic needs (e.g., food), freedoms (in the labor market, for instance), and capabilities. We can proceed to make social choices based on real variables, and thereby address actual position, and access to advantage. Sen's method of informational broadening allows social choice theory to escape the objections of Robbins, which looked as though they would permanently harm social choice theory.\n\nAdditionally, since the seminal results of Arrow's impossibility theorem and the Gibbard–Satterthwaite theorem, many positive results focusing on the restriction of the domain of preferences of individuals have elucidated such topics as optimal voting. The initial results emphasized the impossibility of satisfactorily providing a social choice function free of dictatorship and inefficiency in the most general settings. Later results have found natural restrictions that can accommodate many desirable properties.\n\n\n"}

In this context, following Fischer (2007) SEA may be seen as:\n\n\nEffective SEA works within a structured and tiered decision framework, aiming to support more effective and efficient decision-making for sustainable development and improved governance by providing for a substantive focus regarding questions, issues and alternatives to be considered in policy, plan and programme (PPP) making.\n\nSEA is an evidence-based instrument, aiming to add scientific rigour to PPP making, by using suitable assessment methods and techniques. Ahmed and Sanchez Triana (2008) developed an approach to the design and implementation of public policies that follows a continuous process rather than as a discrete intervention.\n\nThe European Union Directive on Environmental Impact Assessments (85/337/EEC, known as the \"EIA Directive\") only applied to certain projects. This was seen as deficient as it only dealt with specific effects at the local level whereas many environmentally damaging decisions had already been made at a more strategic level (for example the fact that new infrastructure may generate an increased demand for travel).\n\nThe concept of strategic assessments originated from regional development / land use planning in the developed world. In 1981 the \"U.S. Housing and Urban Development Department\" published the \"Area-wide Impact Assessment Guidebook\". In Europe the \"Convention on Environmental Impact Assessment in a Transboundary Context\" the so-called \"Espoo Convention\" laid the foundations for the introduction of SEA in 1991. In 2003, the Espoo Convention was supplemented by a Protocol on Strategic Environmental Assessment.\n\nThe European SEA Directive 2001/42/EC required that all member states of the European Union should have ratified the Directive into their own country's law by 21 July 2004.\n\nCountries of the EU started implementing the land use aspects of SEA first, some took longer to adopt the directive than others, but the implementation of the directive can now be seen as completed. Many EU nations have a longer history of strong Environmental Appraisal including Denmark, the Netherlands, Finland and Sweden. The newer member states to the EU have hurried in implementing the directive.\n\nFor the most part, an SEA is conducted before a corresponding EIA is undertaken. This means that information on the environmental impact of a plan can cascade down through the tiers of decision making and can be used in an EIA at a later stage. This should reduce the amount of work that needs to be undertaken. A handover procedure is foreseen.\n\nThe SEA Directive only applies to plans and programmes, not policies, although policies within plans are likely to be assessed and SEA can be applied to policies if needed and in the UK certainly, very often is.\n\nThe structure of SEA (under the Directive) is based on the following phases:\n\nThe EU directive also includes other impacts besides the environmental, such as material assets and archaeological sites. In most western European states this has been broadened further to include economic and social aspects of sustainability.\n\nSEA should ensure that plans and programmes take into consideration the environmental effects they cause. If those environmental effects are part of the overall decision taking it is called \"Strategic Impact Assessment\".\n\nSEA is a legally enforced assessment procedure required by Directive 2001/42/EC (known as the SEA Directive). The SEA Directive aims at introducing systematic assessment of the environmental effects of strategic land use related plans and programs. It typically applies to regional and local, development, waste and transport plans, within the European Union. Some plans, such as finance and budget plans or civil defence plans are exempt from the SEA Directive, it also only applies to plans that are required by law, which excludes national government's plans and programs, as their plans are 'voluntary', whereas local and regional governments are usually required to prepare theirs.\n\nSEA within the UK is complicated by different Regulations, guidance and practice between England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. In particular the SEA Legislation in Scotland (and in Northern Ireland, which specifically refers to the Regional Development Strategy) contains an expectation that SEA will apply to strategies as well as plans and programmes. In the UK, SEA is inseparable from the term 'sustainability', and an SEA is expected to be carried out as part of a wider Sustainability Appraisal (SA), which was already a requirement for many types of plan before the SEA directive and includes social, and economic factors in addition to environmental. Essentially an SA is intended to better inform decision makers on the sustainability aspects of the plan and ensure the full impact of the plan on sustainability is understood.\n\nThe United Kingdom in its strategy for sustainable development, \"A Better Quality of Life\" (May 1999), explained sustainable development in terms of four objectives. These are:\n\n\nThese headline objectives are usually used and applied to local situations in order to assess the impact of the plan or program.\n\nThe Protocol on Strategic Environmental Assessment was negotiated by the member States of the UNECE (in this instance Europe, Caucasus and Central Asia). It required ratification by 16 States to come into force, which it did in July 2010. It is now open to all UN Member States. Besides its potentially broader geographical application (global), the Protocol differs from the corresponding European Union Directive in its non-mandatory application to policies and legislation – not just plans and programmes. The Protocol also places a strong emphasis on the consideration of health, and there are other more subtle differences between the two instruments.\n\nSEA in New Zealand is part of an integrated planning and assessment process and unlike the US is not used in the manner of Environmental impact assessment. The Resource Management Act 1991 has, as a principal objective, the aim of sustainable management. SEA is increasingly being considered for transportation projects.\nDevelopment assistance is increasingly being provided through strategic-level interventions, aimed to make aid more effective. SEA meets the need to ensure environmental considerations are taken into account in this new aid context. Applying SEA to development co-operation provides the environmental evidence to support more informed decision making, and to identify new opportunities by encouraging a systematic and thorough examination of development options.\n\nThe OECD Development Assistance Committee (DAC) Task Team on SEA has developed guidance on how to apply SEA to development co-operation. The document explains the benefits of using SEA in development co-operation and sets out key steps for its application, based on recent experiences.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "355914", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=355914", "title": "Super Metroid", "text": "Super Metroid\n\nSuper Metroid is an action-adventure game developed and published by Nintendo for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System in 1994. It is the third installment in the \"Metroid\" series, following the events of the Game Boy game \"\" (1991). Players control bounty hunter Samus Aran, who travels to planet Zebes to retrieve an infant Metroid creature stolen by the Space Pirate leader Ridley. It was released through Nintendo's Virtual Console in 2007 and as part of the Super NES Classic Edition microconsole in 2017.\n\nThe gameplay focuses on exploration, with the player searching for power-ups that are used to reach previously inaccessible areas. It features new concepts to the series, such as the inventory screen, an automap, and the ability to fire in all directions. The development staff from previous \"Metroid\" games—including Yoshio Sakamoto, Makoto Kano and Gunpei Yokoi—returned to develop \"Super Metroid\" over the course of two years, with half a year earlier to gain approval for the initial idea. The developers wanted to make a true action game, and to set the stage for Samus's reappearance.\n\nThe game received critical acclaim, praising its atmosphere, gameplay, music and graphics. It is often described as one of the best video games of all time. Although the game did not sell well in Japan, it fared better in North America, and had shipped 1.42 million copies worldwide by late 2003. \"Super Metroid\", alongside \"\" (1997), is credited for establishing the \"Metroidvania\" subgenre, and has inspired other games within the genre. It also became popular among players for speedrunning. The game was followed by the 2002 release of \"Metroid Fusion\" and \"Metroid Prime\", ending the series' eight-year hiatus.\n\n\"Super Metroid\" is a 2D, side-scrolling action-adventure game, which primarily takes place on the fictional planet Zebes—a large, open-ended world with areas connected by doors and elevators. The player controls Samus Aran as she searches the planet for a Metroid that has been stolen by Ridley, the leader of the Space Pirates. Samus can run, jump, crouch, and fire a weapon in eight directions; she can also perform other actions, such as wall jumping—jumping from one wall to another in rapid succession to reach higher areas. The \"Moon Walk\" ability, named after the popular dance move of the same name, allows Samus to walk backwards while firing or charging her weapon.\n\nThroughout the course of the game, the player can acquire power-ups that enhance Samus's armor and weaponry, as well as grant her special abilities, allowing them to gain access to areas that were previously inaccessible. The Morphing Ball allows Samus to curl into a ball, roll into tight places and plant bombs; the Spring Ball adds an ability to jump while in Morphing Ball form. The Speed Booster can be used to run at high speeds, and can crash onto barriers and enemies. The Space Jump allows Samus to jump infinite times to cover great distances, and the Hi-Jump Boots allow for a higher jump. The Grapple Beam can be used to swing across open areas. The X-ray Scope is used to see items and passages through hidden walls and other surfaces.\n\nThe heads-up display shows Samus's health, the supply mode for Reserve Tanks, icons that represent weapons, and a map display showing her location and its surroundings. The inventory screen allows the player to enable and disable weapons and abilities. While the beam weapon can be combined, the Spazer and Plasma beams cannot be used simultaneously. The backup units called Reserve Tanks can be used automatically when Samus's health is depleted. The game also features an automap to help players navigate the different areas of the game. Additionally, the player can use the map computer found in each part of the planet to reveal unexplored areas. To save their progress, the player must find and use one of the save stations scattered around the planet. The game can also be saved at Samus's gunship, which fully recharges her health and ammunition as well. \"Super Metroid\" has three endings based on the time taken to complete the game, which determine whether Samus poses with or without her suit. The best ending is achieved when the game is completed under three hours.\n\nAfter bringing a Metroid larva to Ceres Space Colony for study, bounty hunter Samus Aran receives a distress call. She returns to find the scientists dead and the larva stolen by Ridley, leader of the Space Pirates. Samus escapes from the colony and follows Ridley to the planet Zebes. She searches the planet for the larva and finds that the Space Pirates have rebuilt their base there.\n\nSamus defeats the four Space Pirate bosses, including Kraid and Ridley. In Tourian, the heart of the Space Pirate base, she encounters the Metroid larva, which has grown to an enormous size. It almost kills Samus, but remembers her and departs. Samus confronts Mother Brain, the biomechanical creature that controls the Zebes systems. Mother Brain is about to kill Samus, but is attacked by the Metroid larva, which drains its energy and transfers it to Samus. Mother Brain destroys the Metroid, but is defeated by Samus with the Hyper Beam, a powerful weapon created from the energy given to her by the Metroid. Samus escapes before Zebes self-destructs.\n\n\"Super Metroid\" was developed by Nintendo R&D1 with a staff of 15 managed by Gunpei Yokoi. It was written and directed by Yoshio Sakamoto, and produced by Makoto Kano. Intelligent Systems, who co-developed the original \"Metroid\" with R&D1, handled the programming. The opening was narrated by Dan Owsen, a Nintendo of America employee. \n\n\"Super Metroid\" was released almost a decade after the original \"Metroid.\" Sakamoto said: \"We wanted to wait until a \"true\" action game was needed. [...] And also to set the stage for the reappearance of Samus Aran.\"\"\" It took half a year for Nintendo to approve the project, and two further years to develop.\n\nThe developers' primary goal was to make a \"good action game\". It is the first \"Metroid\" game to let Samus fire in all directions while moving. It is also among the first open-world games with a map feature, which shows the outlines of rooms and indicates important locations and items. The team wanted to create a large map, but found it difficult to organize the amount of graphic data involved, and so broke it into smaller parts. Areas from previous \"Metroid\" games were included to create a sense of familiarity.\n\nShortly before the game's release, the North American Entertainment Software Rating Board, a self-regulating organization, was formed in response to the increasing violence in games such as \"Mortal Kombat\" (1992). Asked whether he thought the controversy would cause a backlash for \"Super Metroid\", Sakamoto explained that Samus's purpose is to maintain peace in the galaxy, saying: \"It's not violence for the sake of violence.\" The game was demonstrated at the Winter 1994 Consumer Electronics Show, and was named the best SNES game at the show by \"GamePro\".\n\nThe music for \"Super Metroid\" was composed by Kenji Yamamoto and Minako Hamano, and uses 16-bit versions of music from previous games. The SNES sound hardware allowed the use of recorded sounds simultaneously on eight channels, as opposed to three PSG channels and one noise channel of the NES. Yamamoto decided that rich and expressive sounds, such as a female chorus, would be required to portray the setting realistically. He composed the main theme by humming while riding his motorcycle from work.\n\nYamamoto also served as a sound programmer, and wrote a program that sends sound data to the audio chip. He also created sound effects, including those created for an infant Metroid to convey different emotions. The simultaneous roles as a composer, a sound programmer and a sound effect creator gave Yamamoto ideas to produce a distinct \"Metroid\" soundtrack \"with a sound programmer's ear, with a sound effect creator's ear, and with the approach methodology and theory of a composer.\" The arrangements and remixes of the game's themes were used in \"Metroid Prime\" and its sequels, because Yamamoto wanted to satisfy old \"Metroid\" fans, describing it as a \"present\" for them.\n\nA soundtrack album, \"Super Metroid: Sound in Action\", was published by Sony Records on June 22, 1994. It contains 38 tracks and has a running time of 58:49. It includes the original \"Metroid\" soundtrack by Hirokazu Tanaka, and additional tracks arranged by Yoshiyuki Ito and Masumi Ito.\n\nThe game was released by Nintendo in Japan on March 19, 1994, in North America on April 18, and in Europe on July 28. It was distributed on a 24-megabit cartridge, making it the largest Super NES game of its time. It was re-released through the Nintendo Power service in Japan on September 30, 1997. \"Super Metroid\" became available as a Wii Virtual Console title in North America on August 20, 2007, in Japan on September 20, and in Europe on October 12. In \"Super Smash Bros. Brawl\", it is also one of the trial games available in the \"Masterpieces\" section, which uses Virtual Console technology to emulate older hardware and have time constraints. The game was later released on the Wii U Virtual Console in May 2013, initially available during the trial campaign for a cheaper price before reverting to its regular price the next month. The New Nintendo 3DS-specific Virtual Console also received the release in April 2016. \"Super Metroid\" is one of the compilation titles playable on Nintendo's Super NES Classic Edition revival microconsole, released in September 2017.\n\n\"Super Metroid\" was met with critical acclaim. Chris Slate of the \"Game Players\" video game magazine thoroughly enjoyed \"Super Metroid\", claiming that it \"easily lives up to everyone's high expectations\". He was satisfied with how Nintendo mixed complex gameplay with \"state-of-the-art\" graphics and sound. Slate found the newly added auto-mapping feature something that players really needed, saying that it was the only feature in \"Super Metroid\" that the original \"Metroid\" should have had. Concluding his review, Slate stated, \"Action fans can't afford to miss \"Super Metroid\". [...] You'll want to play through again and again even after you've beaten it.\" \"Nintendo Power\" mentioned that the game \"may well be the best action adventure game ever\", calling it the \"wave of the future\". They praised the game's graphics, sound, and controls, while their only negative comment was, \"Even 100 megabits of \"Metroid\" wouldn't be enough.\" \"Electronic Gaming Monthly\" gave \"Super Metroid\" their \"Game of the Month\" award, comparing it favorably to the original \"Metroid\" and applauding the graphics, the many weapons and items available, and the music. Each of the four reviewers gave it scores of nine out of ten. \"GamePro\" criticized that the controls are often awkward or difficult and that many of the power-ups are either lifted from other SNES games or simple upgrades of other power-ups in the game, but praised the game's massive size along with the auto-mapping feature, saying it \"makes a potentially frustrating game accessible to a far wider audience.\" Andy Robinson of GamesRadar was pleased with the game's \"phenomenal\" soundtrack, complimenting it as \"one of the best videogame scores of all time\".\n\nThe former British video game publication \"Super Play\", which had three editors review the game, also enjoyed it. The magazine's Zy Nicholson noted that the game was better than his favorite game, \"Mega Man X\", describing \"Super Metroid\" as \"more of an experience than a game\". Comparing the game to the 1986 film \"Aliens\", Nicholson felt that the game was best experienced when played in the dark with the volume turned up. He found the game so compulsive that he was tempted to play \"without eating or sleeping\". The publication's Tony Mott named the game's atmosphere its best aspect, calling the game a mix of \"Turrican\" (1990), \"Aliens\", \"Exile\" (1989), and \"Nodes of Yesod\" (1985). Appreciating the game's controls, Mott applauded Nintendo's ability to create a refined gameplay. He concluded his review by calling \"Super Metroid\" \"undoubtedly the best game I've played this year so far\", predicting that anyone who plays the game would be \"playing a game destined for classic status\". The third reviewer, James Leach, agreed with Nicholson and Mott that \"Super Metroid\" was what \"Mega Man X\" should have been. Concluding his review, Leach wrote that \"Super Metroid\" contained everything he looked for in a video game: \"playability, hidden tricks, powerful weapons and steamingly evil baddies\". After summarizing the reviews, the magazine's verdict was, \"We all love this game. \"Super Metroid\" is absolutely marvelous and \"you\" should own it.\"\n\nIGN called \"Super Metroid\"s Virtual Console version a \"must-own\", commenting that although the game was released nine months after the Wii launched, they felt that it was worth the wait. For players who have never played \"Super Metroid\", IGN claims that they owe themselves as gamers to \"finally find out about what you've been missing all these years\". In his review for GameSpot, Frank Provo found it \"absolutely astonishing that Nintendo let 13 years go by before making \"Super Metroid\" readily available again\", but considered the most important thing was that players \"can now play this masterpiece without having to track down the original Super Nintendo Entertainment System cartridge or fumble with legally questionable emulators\". Despite admitting that the Virtual Console version was essentially \"nothing more than a no-frills, emulated version of a 13-year-old SNES game\" that was no longer cutting-edge, he was still pleased with it and reiterated his belief that \"Super Metroid\" is \"one of the best 2D action adventure games ever produced\".\n\nAlthough \"Super Metroid\" received critical acclaim, Rus McLaughlin of IGN said that the \"Metroid\" series \"still fell down on the timing, arriving too late in the SNES lifecycle to earn big sales.\" Robinson similarly noted that, in a series tradition, the game was released \"at the wrong place, at the wrong time.\" He also added that it did not sell well in Japan after struggling against more commercially popular games, such as \"Donkey Kong Country\", along with the launch of the PlayStation and Sega Saturn consoles. With the help of strong marketing from Nintendo, \"Super Metroid\" sold better in North America, and a year after its release, Nintendo placed it on their Player's Choice marketing label. By late 2003, the game had shipped 1.42 million copies worldwide.\n\nSuper Metroid collected several awards and honors. \"Electronic Gaming Monthly\" named \"Super Metroid\" a Game of the Month for May 1994, gave it an Editors' Choice award, awarded it as the Best Action Game of 1994, and named it the best game of all time in 2003. IGN ranked \"Super Metroid\" 3rd (2003), 10th (2005) and 7th (2007) in its top 100 games of all time lists. Likewise, IGN readers ranked the game 11th in its top 99 games of all-time list in 2005, and 4th in its top 100 games in 2006. Richard George of IGN also ranked \"Super Metroid\" 3rd in its top 100 SNES games, crediting its \"flawless action, impeccable level design, out-of-this-world atmosphere, a totally badass heroine and an enormous overworld to explore.\" GamesRadar named \"Super Metroid\" the best SNES game of all time, while \"Nintendo Power\" named it the best game in the \"Metroid\" series, beating out \"Metroid Prime\" and \"\". \"GamePro\" listed \"Super Metroid\" as one of the fifteen must-play retro games on the Wii.\n\n\"Super Metroid\" is often regarded as one of the best games of all time. Jeremy Parish of USgamer remarked that \"Super Metroid\" is a \"kind of game you can return to time and again and always come away with some fresh insight or observation.\" Andrew Webster of \"Ars Technica\" found the game's atmosphere impressive, and noted that the developers had perfected the aspect on solitude, a concept introduced in the first \"Metroid\" game. \"Game Informer\" writer Joe Juba cited the game's ending as \"one of the most memorable and empowering moments in gaming history.\"\n\nAs \"Super Metroid\" gave players awards based on how long it took them to complete the game, it has become a popular choice for speedrunning, a style of play in which the player intends to complete the game as quickly as possible for the purpose of competition. \"Super Metroid\", alongside Konami's 1997 game \"\", is also credited for establishing the \"Metroidvania\" genre. The game would also inspire other Metroidvania games, including \"Shadow Complex\", \"Axiom Verge\", and \"Ghost Song: A Journey of Hope\".\n\nSeveral ROM hacks for \"Super Metroid\" were released by fans, which added new features that are not included in the original game. \"Super Metroid: Redesign\", created by \"drewseph\" in 2006, features new items, expanded areas and modified physics. In 2011, a Japanese hacker named \"SB\" released a ROM hack titled \"Metroid: Super Zero Mission\", which intends to combine elements from \"Super Metroid\" and the later-released \"\".\n\nAfter \"Super Metroid\"s release, there would not be another sequel for eight years, as none of the games in the \"Metroid\" series up to this point had enjoyed the level of success that the \"Mario\" and \"The Legend of Zelda\" franchises had. \"Metroid\" series producer Gunpei Yokoi left Nintendo in August 1996, amid the failure of the Virtual Boy, and later died in a car accident in October 1997. \n\nDuring the series' hiatus, fans eagerly awaited a \"Metroid\" game for the Nintendo 64 (N64). According to Shigeru Miyamoto, Nintendo did not develop a \"Metroid\" game for the N64 as they \"couldn't come out with any concrete ideas\". Sakamoto said he could not imagine how the N64 controller could be used to control Samus. Nintendo approached another company to make an N64 \"Metroid\", but the offer was declined because the developers thought they could not make a game that could equal \"Super Metroid\"s standards.\n\nIn late 2002, two new \"Metroid\" games were released by Nintendo, marking the return of the series after an eight-year hiatus. The games were \"Metroid Fusion\", a 2D side-scroller developed for the Game Boy Advance by Nintendo R&D1, the same team that developed \"Super Metroid\"; and \"Metroid Prime\", a first-person action-adventure game developed for the GameCube by the American company Retro Studios and the first \"Metroid\" game to use 3D graphics. Both \"Fusion\" and \"Prime\" garnered critical acclaim, with the latter winning several Game of the Year awards. After \"Metroid Prime\", three more games in the first-person perspective and a pinball spin-off were released, including its sequel, \"\" (2004).\n\n"}
{"id": "761788", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=761788", "title": "The Blob", "text": "The Blob\n\nThe Blob is a 1958 independently made American science-fiction horror film in color by De Luxe, produced by Jack H. Harris, directed by Irvin Yeaworth, and written by Kay Linaker and Theodore Simonson. The film stars Steve McQueen (in his starring feature film debut, as Steven McQueen) and Aneta Corsaut and co-stars Earl Rowe and Olin Howland. \"The Blob\" was distributed by Paramount Pictures as a double feature with \"I Married a Monster from Outer Space\". \n\nThe storyline concerns a growing, corrosive, alien amoeboidal entity that crashes to Earth from outer space inside a meteorite. It devours and dissolves citizens in the small communities of Phoenixville and Downingtown, PA, growing larger, redder, and more aggressive each time it does so, eventually becoming larger than a building. \n\nIn a small rural Pennsylvania town in July 1957, teenager Steve Andrews (Steve McQueen) and his girlfriend, Jane Martin (Aneta Corsaut), are kissing at a lovers' lane when they see a meteorite crash beyond the next hill; Steve decides to look for it. An old man (Olin Howland) living nearby finds it first. When he pokes the meteorite with a stick, it breaks open, and a small jelly-like globule inside attaches itself to his hand. In pain and unable to scrape or shake it loose, the old man runs onto the road, where he is nearly struck by Steve's car; Steve and Jane take him to Doctor Hallen (Stephen Chase).\n\nDoctor Hallen anesthetizes the man and sends Steve and Jane back to locate the impact site and gather information. Hallen decides he must amputate the man's arm since it is being consumed. Before he can, The Blob completely consumes the old man, then Hallen's nurse, and finally the doctor himself, all the while continuing to grow.\nSteve and Jane return in time for Steve to witness the doctor trying to get out the window with the creature on his head. They leave and go to the police station and return with Lieutenant Dave (Earl Rowe) and Sergeant Bert (John Benson). There is no sign, however, of The Blob or its victims, and Bert dismisses Steve's story as a teenage prank. Steve and Jane are taken home by their parents, but they later sneak out.\n\nIn the meantime, the creature consumes a mechanic at a repair shop and grows in size every time it consumes something. At the Colonial Theater, which is showing a midnight screening of \"Daughter of Horror\", Steve recruits Tony (Robert Fields) and some of his friends to warn people about The Blob. When Steve notices that his father's grocery store is unlocked, he and Jane go inside. The janitor is nowhere to be seen. Then the couple are cornered by the creature; they seek refuge in the walk-in freezer. The Blob oozes in under the door, but quickly retreats. Steve and Jane gather their friends and set off the town's fire and air-raid alarms. The townspeople and police still refuse to believe Steve. Meanwhile, the creature enters the Colonial Theater and engulfs and devours the projectionist before oozing into the auditorium, consuming a number of the audience. Steve is finally vindicated when screaming people leave the theater in blind panic.\n\nJane, Danny, and Steve become trapped in the diner, along with the manager and a waitress. The Blob, now enormous and blood red from the people it has consumed, has engulfed the building. Dave has a connection made from his police radio to the diner's telephone, telling those in the diner to get into the cellar before they bring down a live power line onto the diner.\n\nWhen the live wire lands, it discharges a massive electrical current into The Blob, but it is unaffected and the diner is set ablaze. When the diner manager uses a carbon dioxide extinguisher on the fire, Steve notices that this causes the creature to recoil. Steve remembers that it also retreated from the freezer, saying \"That's why it didn't come in the ice box after us. It can't stand cold\"! Shouting in hopes of being picked up on the open phone line, Steve tells Dave about The Blob's vulnerability to cold. Jane's father, Mr. Martin (Elbert Smith), leads Steve's friends to the high school to retrieve the twenty fire extinguishers there. Returning, the brigade of fire extinguisher-armed students and police first drive the creature away from the diner, then freeze it, saving Steve, Jane, and the others.\n\nDave requests authorities send an Air Force heavy-lift cargo aircraft to transport the Blob to the Arctic, where it is later parachuted down to the ice and snow pack. Dave says that while the creature is not dead, at least it has been stopped. To this, Steve Andrews replies, \"Yeah, as long as the Arctic stays cold\".\n\nThe film was originally titled \"The Molten Meteor\" until producers overheard screenwriter Kay Linaker refer to the film's monster as \"the blob\". Other sources give a different account, saying that the film went through a number of title changes (the monster was called \"the mass\" in the shooting script) before the makers settled on \"The Glob\". After hearing that cartoonist Walt Kelly had used \"The Glob\" as a title for his Pogo children's book, they mistakenly believed that they could no longer use that title, so they changed it to \"The Blob\".\n\n\"The Blob\" was directed by Irvin Yeaworth, who had directed more than 400 films for motivational, educational, and religious purposes. Though the budget was set at $120,000 it ended up costing only $110,000. Filmed in and around Valley Forge, Pennsylvania, principal photography took place at Valley Forge Studios. Several scenes were filmed in the towns of Chester Springs, Downingtown, Phoenixville, and Royersford, including the basement of a local restaurant which is today named Downingtown Diner. For the diner scene, a photograph of the building was put on a gyroscopically operated table onto which cameras had been mounted. The table was shaken and the Blob rolled off. When the film negative was printed in reverse, it appeared to be oozing over the building. \"The Blob\" was filmed in color by De Luxe and widescreen.\n\n28-year-old Steve McQueen received $3,000 for his starring role. He turned down an offer for a smaller up-front fee in return for a 10% percent share of profits, thinking that the film would never make money; he needed his signing fee immediately to pay for food and rent. However, \"The Blob\" ended up a hit, grossing $4 million at the box office.\n\nThe film's tongue-in-cheek title song, \"Beware of The Blob\", was written by Burt Bacharach and Mack David and became a nationwide hit in the U.S., peaking at number 33 on the \"Billboard\" chart on 9 November, 1958. The song was recorded by studio group the Five Blobs (actually singer Bernie Knee overdubbing himself). Though legend has it that the opening novelty song was composed by a young and unknown Burt Bacharach, along with Bacharach's famous songwriting partner, Hal David, David's brother Mack composed the lyrics and by that time Bacharach had already achieved some measure of success when the film was released.\n\nThe background score for \"The Blob\" was composed by Ralph Carmichael. It was one of just a few film scores that Carmichael wrote. Carmichael is best known for his musical associations with Billy Graham and for arranging \"The Magic of Christmas\" for Nat King Cole. Carmichael also composed the original theme for the film, entitled \"Violence\" on the soundtrack album, which started the film on a serious and frightening note. It was against the director's wishes to replace the original theme song with that by Bacharach/David. However, because the latter encourages audiences to view \"The Blob\" as campy fun, it has contributed to the film's enduring popularity. Both Carmichael's score and Bacharach/David's song were released in 2008 by the Monstrous Movie Music soundtrack label.\n\nAccording to Tim Dirks, the film was one of a wave of \"cheap teen movies\" released for the drive-in market. They consisted of \"exploitative, cheap fare created especially for [young people] in a newly-established teen/drive-in genre.\"\n\n\"The Blob\" was released theatrically in 1958 on a double bill with \"I Married a Monster from Outer Space\".\n\nWhen \"The Blob\" first premiered as the B film on a double feature with \"I Married a Monster from Outer Space\", it was quickly moved up to be the main feature. While audiences liked it, critics were not as kind. The review in \"The New York Times\" highlighted some of the problems and identified some positives, although Steve McQueen's debut was not one of them. Concentrating on director Irvin Yeaworth's work, \"Unfortunately, his picture talks itself to death, even with the blob nibbling away at everybody in sight. And most of his trick effects, under the direction of Irvin S. Yeaworth Jr., look pretty phony\".\n\nThe review continued with, \"On the credit side, the camera very snugly frames the small town background — a store, a church spire, several homes and a theatre. The color is quite good (the blob rolls around in at least a dozen horrible-looking flavors, including raspberry). The acting is pretty terrible itself, there is not a single becomingly familiar face in the cast, headed by young Steven McQueen and Aneta Corseaut.\"\n\n\"Variety\" had a similar reaction, seeing McQueen as the star, gamely \"giving the old college try\" but that the \"... Star performers, however, are the camerawork of Thomas Spalding and Barton Sloane’s special effects\".\n\nIn a discussion with biologist Richard Dawkins, astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson stated that among all Hollywood aliens, which were usually disappointing from a scientific perspective, \"The Blob\" was his favorite.\n\nThe film review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported a 68% approval rating based on 31 reviews, with an average rating of 6.3/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \"In spite of its chortle-worthy premise and dated special effects, \"The Blob\" remains a prime example of how satisfying cheesy B-movie monster thrills can be\".\n\n\"The Blob\" has been released as part of the Criterion Collection on three formats. First in 1988 on LaserDisc, then in 2000 on DVD, and in 2013 on Blu-ray. The film, together with \"Son of Blob\", was released on DVD in Australia by Umbrella Entertainment in September 2011. The DVD is compatible with all region codes and includes special features such as audio commentaries with Jack H. Harris, Bruce Eder, Irvin Yeaworth, and Robert Fields. In November 2016, Umbrella released a 2-disc Blu-ray titled \"The Blob Collection\", featuring the 1988 version of \"The Blob\" on disc one, and the 1958 version and \"Son of Blob\" on disc two. Disc two plays the Criterion Collection's opening identification, although the release was distributed by Umbrella Entertainment with no mention of Criterion on the disc sleeve.\n\nA comedy sequel, \"Beware! The Blob\", was made in 1972, directed by Larry Hagman. Home video releases used the tagline \"The Movie That J.R. Shot\", in reference to his character's near-demise in the television series \"Dallas\".\n\nIn 1988, a remake with the same name was made and directed by Chuck Russell. \n\nIn August 2009, it was revealed that musician-turned-director Rob Zombie was working on another remake, but he later ceased working on this project. In January 2015, Zombie was replaced by Simon West as director of the remake. It was announced that the film would be produced by Richard Saperstein and Brian Witten, together with the producer of the original, Jack H. Harris, as executive producer.\n\nThe 1999 John Lafia film \"Monster!\" included a theater scene apparently inspired by the one from \"The Blob\".\n\nThe movie \"Monsters vs. Aliens\" had characters based on classic 1950s movie monsters including B.O.B. (Benzoate Ostylezene Bicarbonate), an amoeboid creature.\n\nSince 2000, the town of Phoenixville, Pennsylvania, one of the filming locations, has held an annual \"Blobfest\". Activities include a re-enactment of the scene in which moviegoers run screaming from the town's Colonial Theatre, which has recently been restored. Chef's Diner in Downingtown is also restored, and is open for business for photographs of the basement on weekday mornings only.\n\nThe Blob itself was made from silicone, with increasing amounts of red vegetable dye added as it \"absorbed\" people. In 1965, it was bought by film collector Wes Shank, who has written a book about the making of \"The Blob\".\n\nAccording to Jeff Sharlet in his book \"The Family\", \"The Blob\" was \"about the creeping horrors of communism\" only defeated \"by freezing it — the Cold War writ small and literal\". Rudy Nelson, one of the scriptwriters for the film, has denied many of Sharlet's assertions, saying \"What on earth can Sharlet say about the movie that will fill 23 pages—especially when what he thinks he knows is all wrong\"?\n\nIn 1997, film historians Kim R. Holston and Tom Winchester noted that the film was \"Filmed in southeastern Pennsylvania at Valley Forge Studios, (and) this very famous piece of pop culture is a model of a decent movie on a small budget\".\n\nThe poster for \"The Blob\" was briefly shown in Steven Spielberg's 2017 film \"The Post\" starring Tom Hanks and Meryl Streep.\n\nThe film is recognized by American Film Institute in these lists:\n\n\n"}

Tzazo died on 15 December 533 during the Battle of Tricamarum, which finally brought to an end the Vandal Kingdom in North Africa.\n\nTzazo had not been involved in the earlier Battle of Ad Decimum because Godas, instigated by the Byzantine Emperor Justinian the Great, had declared the Vandal province on the island of Sardinia independent from Carthage. King Gelimer had been unaware of the approaching Byzantines and sent Tzazo to repress the rebellion, which he did.\n\nAfter his defeat at Ad Decimum, Gelimer knew that in his current state he would not be able to face Belisarius's forces, so he sent messengers to Tzazo to return from Sardinia with his expeditionary force of over 120 ships and 5,000 Vandals. Tzazo and his army joined Gelimer early in December, at which point Gelimer felt his forces were strong enough to take the offensive. \n\nTheir joined forces immediately marched on Carthage, pausing on the way to demolish the great aqueduct on which the capital chiefly depended for its water supply. Belisarius had spent the weeks since the Battle of Ad Decimum strengthening the city defences; he did not want to face a siege and he was beginning to grow suspicious of the loyalty of the Huns and other barbarians under his command, knowing some of his army was being approached by agents of Gelimer. He gave the order to march to meet the Vandals in battle putting the Huns and barbarians in the rear of his force. \n\nThe Battle of Tricamarum took place on December 15, 533 between the armies of the Vandals, commanded by King Gelimer and his brother Tzazo, and the Byzantines commanded by Belisarius.

In the third charge, Tzazo was cut down in front of Gelimer, who lost heart and fled to the mountains of Numidia.

{"id": "25849636", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25849636", "title": "Yank Adams", "text": "Yank Adams\n\nFrank B. Adams (December 19, 1847 – after January 1923), commonly known as Yank Adams, was a professional carom billiards player who specialized in finger billiards, in which a player directly manipulates the balls with his or her hands, instead of using an implement such as a cue stick, often by twisting the ball between one's thumb and middle finger. Adams, who was sometimes billed as the \"Digital Billiard Wonder\", has been called the \"greatest of all digit billiards players\", and the \"champion digital billiardist of the World.\" George F. Slosson, a top billiards player of Adams' era, named him the \"greatest exhibition player who ever lived.\" Adams' exhibitions drew audiences of 1,000 or more, leaving standing room only, even in small venues.\n\nAdams' career began when he found his aptitude for bowling translated to the playing of billiards. One day when he was 25 years old, he picked up some billiard balls and began to \"bowl\" on the table and soon discovered he could manipulate the balls with great accuracy in this manner. Largely self-taught, Adams thereafter amassed a large repertoire of finger billiards shots. He engaged a manager and began to give performances, his first was at an engagement in New York City. Later, Adams traveled extensively, giving exhibitions and taking on challengers in cities across the United States and some in Europe. During his travels, Adams performed before the Vanderbilts, the Goulds, three U.S. Presidents, the Prince of Wales in London, and the Comte de Paris in Paris. One of the largest matches ever played of any form of billiards took place at Manhattan's Gilmore's Gardens in 1878. Adams played using his fingers against William Sexton, the reigning cue champion of the world, who used a cue; Adams won the three-day competition in the game of straight rail.\n\nAdams was raised in Norwich, Connecticut, which led to him being nicknamed \"Yank\" later in life. From a young age, he exhibited the substantial hand strength required for finger billiards. When he was less than a year old, he could hurt his mother with his grip; she gave him chunks of bread to squeeze instead. Adams was large for his age, and in 1863, he disguised his youth, and joined the Eighteenth Connecticut Volunteers, with whom he served for three years, fighting for the Union in the American Civil War. After being discharged, Adams worked as a carpenter from 1872 to 1875, and then became a traveling salesman for the American Sterling-Silver Company.\n\nAdams finger billiards and exhibition work had its germination in his early bowling interest. By the time he was 17, Adams was an adept bowler; he often gave informal exhibitions of bowling tricks such as \"cocked hat\", \"back frame\", and letting the head pin remain standing. In a 1913 interview, Adams said that, \"[i]n those days we rolled what was termed 'skew ball', similar to the put on a cue ball in Billiards.\"\n\nWhen Adams was 25 he was employed as a traveling salesman for the Derby Silver Company in New York. One day, while he was waiting for customers in a Poughkeepsie hotel, he strolled into a billiard room, took six pool balls over to a billiard table, and commenced\nto \"bowl\". The attention of everyone in the room was attracted by the manner in which Adams made the ball travel. One man asked for the privilege of placing the balls in a certain position for Adams to bowl at; Adams made the shot easily. This started Adams' career as a finger billiard expert. In the next town he traveled to, he hired a table, performed the same stunts with the balls, and added a few new shots. For three months after that Adams practiced various shots each day, and some of the shots he developed during that time became part of his regular exhibition repertoire.\n\nWhen he returned to New York, Adams met with Maurice Daly, then the \"dean of billiards\". Daly listened to Adams' story, and said that he was not aware that any startling shots could be accomplished using only the hands. Daly offered Adams a set of four balls, and sat down to watch Adams. After 12 shots, Daly became greatly interested, often asking Adams to repeat shots. At the end of the performance, Daly told Adams that if he ever entertained any idea of entering the billiards field he would give Adams an engagement at his room.\n\nAs Adams became more involved with billiards, he gave up his job with the silver company. Adams went to Sexton's billiard parlor in the Bowery and Sexton employed Adams at Miner's Bowery Theater at $115 a week. Adams sought to employ a manager as was typical of billiards professionals of the time; he was taken on by Billy O'Brien, a well known sports authority and one-time pugilist who managed Dominick McCaffrey later in his career. O'Brien organized an exhibition tour of the United States for Adams. Three months into the tour, Adams reached Chicago, where he played a three-week engagement for Billy Emmett at $500 a week. After leaving the stage, Adams opened at O'Connor's billiard room, at Fourteenth Street and Fourth Avenue, where he played nightly for a year. Adams then resumed traveling, and gave exhibitions in nearly every city in the United States and a large number of cities in Europe.\nIn 1868 Adams appeared before the Prince of Wales in London and the Comte de Paris in Paris. While in London, John Roberts, Jr. offered Adams $300 per week for one year to play afternoon and evening at his Argyle Rooms. After playing for the Comte de Paris, the Frenchmen wanted Adams to state his figures for an indefinite period. Adams also played for three Presidents of the United States; while in New York he was paid $100 per night by the Vanderbilt and Gould families. \"Bullocks Billiard Guide\" said that Adams had earned more than $70,000 for exhibition alone over seven years, which was more than the combined earnings of all other listed billiardists. Though champion players with cues sometimes dabbled in finger billiards, it was said even of such greats as Jacob Schaefer, George Slosson, and Eugene Carter that \"their work, compared with that of the Finger Wonder, is like a novice playing an expert.\"\n\nAdams' first major public exhibition in New York was held on January 31, 1878, at the Union Square Billiard Rooms before a large audience; he performed there nightly for a week. Reporting on the first night of the event, \"The New York Times\" wrote:The intricacy of the various shots he played, as well as the marvelous accuracy with which they were executed, frequently roused the spectators to an unusual pitch of enthusiasm... Many of Adams' shots are entirely new, never having been attempted before by any billiards expert. Among them may be mentioned the wonderful \"bottle\" shot with which last evening's exhibition was brought to a close. Two soda-water bottles were placed at the head of the left-hand rail, about a foot apart, a red ball being placed in the mouth of each bottle. A white ball was next placed against the right-hand rail, directly opposite the lower bottle. Everything being in readiness, Adams then took the remaining white ball in his hand, and masseing upon the ball in the mouth of the upper bottle, jumped his ball to the ball in the mouth of the other bottle, whence, falling upon the table it was carried by a reverse \"English\" to the middle of the top rail, whence it glided with unerring accuracy to the right-hand rail and caromed upon the first-mentioned white ball, its successful execution being greeted with great applause.\n\nPrior to Adams' performances, finger billiards had been demonstrated in New York by French player M. Adrien Izar, who had astonished spectators with an exhibition held on September 20, 1875, before which the game was little known in the United States. In France and England, Izar was considered the game's champion player. The night before his 1878 exhibition, Adams received a telegram in which Izar challenged him to play for the championship and named Chicago as the venue for contest. Adams replied that he was unwilling to leave New York at that time, but that he would pay Izar's expenses to travel to New York. Adams later issued the following statement to newspapers:I have never intended to play a public match in my line, having never arrogated to myself a superiority above other hand billiard players, although I have deemed myself the equal of any one living in my line, not excepting Mons. Izar, by whom continually letters are written, whose contents have for their purpose a derogation of my skill. That this may be checked, and summarily, I would state that I am willing to play Mons. Izar a match game for $500 a side, in New York City, Boston or Chicago, on a 5x10 table, full size balls and Collender cushion; the championship and gate money to be awarded the player showing the greatest variety of shots in connection with accuracy, and in all giving the most interesting exhibition of finger billiards.\n\nOn March 15, 1878, a billiards match of straight rail began that lasted three days at the game The match was between Adams and William Sexton, then the cue champion of the world, at Manhattan's Gilmore's Gardens—the predecessor venue of Madison Square Garden. The match pitted Adams' finger billiards against Sexton using a cue, for a purse of $500. The audience was one of the largest that had ever witnessed a billiards game. The terms of the contest stated that on each day of the match, Adams was required to score 2,000 points, while Sexton needed only 1,000.\n\nOn the first day of the match, Adams scored 1,110 points using finger billiards. Despite Adams' impressive opening performance, by the third day of the match, Sexton was far in the lead. In Dewey-Defeats-Truman-style, many newspapers reported that Sexton won the tournament, as their reporters left the venue at a time when Sexton had a seemingly indomitable lead and before the match was over. \"The New York Times\", for example, reported that Sexton won the match, though they leavened the result by reporting that despite the prize fund, it was a \"friendly match\", geared toward exhibition, and that \"Adams could undoubtedly have run the game out on three occasions, but preferred to make 'display' shots in place of his usual \"nurse\" play, against which a cue player stands no chance whatever.\" However, with Sexton needed only seven points to win the championship, Adams stepped to the table and ran out, making 1,181 points in a row to win the match.\n\nAdams' chief professional rivalry in later years was with Louis Shaw. In 1891 Adams and Shaw disagreed about the format of the finger billiards championship which they would both contest that year. Adams wanted the match to be played for a $500 stake, while Shaw wanted the receipts to be donated to the local firemen's fund.\n\nIn 1879, Adams was chosen to be the official referee for the championship Collender Billiard Tournament held at Tammany Hall. It was contested by top players Marice Daly, Albert Garnier, Eugene Carter, A. P. Rudolphe, Randolph Heiser, William Sexton, George F. Slosson, and \"the Wizard\", Jacob Schaefer, Sr. at the newly introduced carom billiards discipline called the champion's game, an intermediary game between straight rail and balkine.\n\nIn 1889, Adams broke the world record run for successive straight rail points in a match with champion player Jacob Schaefer, Sr., in which Adams scored 4,962 counts in a row, which was 2,400 points more than any prior competition high run, albeit with his fingers rather than with a cue. Adams stated in an interview in his later years that his personal high run was 6,900 consecutive straight rail counts.\n\nIn 1890, Adams returned to Paris after signing a contract with Eugene Carter to play at Carter's billiard academy for thirteen weeks at 1,000 francs (approximately $200) per week. Afterwards, Adams went in London, under the management of M. Farini, to play at the room of John Roberts, Jr. On a previous trip to London in 1887, Roberts offered Adams £60 a week for six months to give exhibitions, but Adams declined, citing a need to superintend his sporting journal.\n\nAdams was the editor and proprietor of \"The Chicago Sporting Journal\", and the general manager of the \"New York Sporting and Theatrical Journal\". Through his association with the sporting journals, Adams was an intermediary for the issuance of challenge matches, such as boxing bouts. He held the winning stake and distributed the winnings upon the event's conclusion. Adams owned a number of billiard parlors during his lifetime, including two in Chicago—one named the White Elephant, another called the Academy Billiard Hall, and one on Union Square at 60 East 14th Street in New York City. Adams' business cards, in 1877, said, \"Yank Adams, champion finger billiardist of the world. Residence immaterial.\"\n\nAdams continued to give exhibitions and was still able to perform well into his later years. For example, the New Rochelle Pioneer newspaper reported that Adams gave an exhibition on December 21, 1915 at 68 years of age, at Chamberlain's Derby Billiard Academy in New Rochelle, New York, and that he was \"at his best and made some exceptionally brilliant shots in the presence of 300 lovers of the game. While at the table he kept up a continuous humorous monologue to the great pleasure of his audience.\" In 1919, when Adans was 71, the Brooklyn Daily Eagle reported that he gave an exhibition before a large audience at Lawler Brothers Billiard Academy of Brooklyn.\n\nIn 1923, when Adams was 76, the following newspaper story appeared in \"The Salt Lake Tribune\", telling of his whereabouts:Perhaps you old fellows, too, thought Yank had passed on, but he turned up in New York the other day and is now spending his last days in a Bronx flat. There was a time when Yank Adams was known in every billiard room in America. He was as much at home in Eddie Graney's room at San Francisco as at Tom Foley's in Chicago of Maurice Daly's in New York, and he knew all the billiard players and big and little room keepers from coast to coast. When the history of billiards is written and the names of Willie Hoppe, old and young Jake Schaefer and Welker Cochran are included with others of the great exponents of the indoor sport, there will be a distinct division for one man—the man who did the impossible, who could make the ivories travel the wrong way, or, in the language of the billiard realm, \"make 'em talk all languages.\" That man is Frank B. Adams, known the world over as \"Yank\" Adams, at one time and even now the world's only finger billiardist who can make all the apparently impossible shots on the table without the aid of a cue. Adams is 76 years old, and after fifty years of exhibitions all over the world has retired from active work to live in the Bronx and conduct a billiard academy of his own at Burnside and Creston avenues in New York with his business manager for the last ten years, Samuel Polakoff. Yank now lives at 635 West 136th street In New York. When I told Tom Foley, the daddy of all the roommkeepers, that Yank Adams was back in the business he laughed and said: \"I thought Yank had cashed in. But he's like all those billiard players. They never die.\"\n\nAdams played only with his fingers, disdaining the cue stick entirely. He was known for his skill at finger billiards and for the quickness of his play. In exhibitions it was sometimes advertised that Adams would attempt to make 100 shots in 100 seconds. He would always begin by \"feeling out\" the cushions on the table, as the speed of the tables varied almost nightly, some fast and some slow.\n\nAdams would sometimes accept challenge matches at his performances. For example, at an exhibition held in Omaha, Nebraska, on November 20, 1889, Adams played against twenty of the best players in the city. Adams manipulated the balls with his fingers, while his opponents used cues and were given a handicap equivalent to a 1,000 point lead.\n\nAdams performed about 80 shots per exhibition. He had a large repertoire of practiced shots—more than 500—affording him the luxury to not having to repeat a single shot during a week-long exhibition. The abundance of shots was unusual, and was described by one sports writer as \"more extensive than the entire billiard fraternity put together\". The following description of Adams' shots appeared in an 1891 newspaper article, which highlighted them as, \"among his difficult feats\":Two quart wine bottles are placed at the short end of the table, three feet apart; a ball is placed on the top of each bottle, and a third ball, six feet from the bottles in the opposite corner. Adams makes the hand ball jump from bottle to bottle then to take an English in space, counting on the third bail, a double shot.Fifteen balls are placed in a line, three inches apart. On the last ball is placed a piece of chalk, while two feet from the other end, at a square angle, is placed a single ball. Yank drops the hand ball with a Massé twist, which, after hitting the single ball, describes a semi-circle, taken the cushion first, then makes a carrom on the fifteen balls, but is played with such a delicate calculation as barely to reach the last ball; in fact, freezes against it so gently as not to dislodge the chalk previously placed thereon.A derby hat is placed on the table, under which is a ball. One foot from the hat are two balls a foot apart, which he carroms on, the hand ball continues striking the rim of the hat, forces it up, and goes under making the stroke on the third ball, then returns from under the hat when it rocks the second time.He also stand at the head of the table, throwing the balls with a hundred-yard force but has them stop eight feet away in such a position as to spell his name.\nIn an article in the St. Paul \"Daily Globe\", the reporter summed up the events of Adams' exhibition on April 26, 1888:The great finger billiard exhibition came off last night at the Standard billiard hall to a packed house, and those who saw Yank Adams handle the spheres were more than delighted... Shot after shot were made in lightning rapidity, spotting the ball, running the whole length of the rail, crossing over, with two cushions and counting, going under hats and in between them, cutting the letter S and making the carom, jump shots, masses and hundreds of others too complicated to put in type. Mr. A.M. Doherty played a game with the exhibitor, and at twenty-eight points left the balls in a scattered position, which were gathered at one shot by Mr. Adams, who made fifty shots in sixty seconds. What seemed his most difficult shot was that of placing fifteen balls in a line, and a piece of chalk on the last ball. The hand ball was then dropped a distance of two feet, described a semi-circle, making a carom on all of the balls and freezing against the last ball. Adams' finger shots discount Schaeffer, Slosson and J. Carter combined.\n\nThe public flocked to Adams' exhibitions; often the pool room where he was performing could barely contain the crowd. When Adams performed in Rochester, New York in 1892, the local paper reported that \"[n]o man in these broad acres can draw the crowd \"Yank\" Adams does when an exhibition with the ivories is the card. Last night's crowd was banked up, against the walls, twenty deep in someplaces and many witnessed the exhibition from the table tops and window ledges.\"\n"}

The series ran in syndication until 1985. Zuma's body has a snake part/protrusion on both his shoulders. As told in the comics, Zuma is a demigod and the son of the Aztec serpent god Kukulkan (\"Plumed Serpent\", \"Feathered Serpent\"). He had been entombed in a buried Aztec pyramid until unearthed by an archaeological expedition team. Unleashed into the modern world, Zuma goes on a murderous rampage, preying particularly on virgin women who he rips and eats the hearts of.\n\nZuma first appeared in the comics series \"Aztec\". The character reached the peak of his popularity in the 1980s with the series \"Anak ni Zuma\" (\"Offspring of Zuma\") in Aliwan Komiks magazine. It spawned a spin-off prequel \"Angkan ni Zuma\" (Clan of Zuma), chronicling Zuma's adventures in ancient times. \"Zuma-Maria\" was a science-fiction tale about Zuma's future descendant.\n\nIn the mid-1990s, Zuma was revived in a short-lived comic book series, \"Zuma Komiks\" (Zuma Comics).\n\nThere have only been two Philippine Zuma movies to date, \"Zuma\" (1985) and \"Anak ni Zuma\" (1988), both starring actor Max Laurel in the title role. Snooky Serna played Galema, Zuma's daughter, only in the first film; the role was played in the sequel by a lesser-known actress named Jenny Lyn. Max Laurel appeared in other films only as a character actor.\n\nZuma also appeared in the 2013 series \"\".\n\n\n"}
